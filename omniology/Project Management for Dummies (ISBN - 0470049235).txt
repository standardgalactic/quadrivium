Introduction
P
rojects have been around since ancient times. Noah building the ark,
Leonardo da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa, Edward Gibbon writing The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Jonas Salk developing the polio vaccine —
all projects. And, as you know, these have been masterful successes. (Well,
the products were a spectacular success, even if schedules and resource
budgets were drastically overrun!)
Why, then, is the topic of project management of such great interest today?
The answer is simple: The audience has changed and the stakes are higher.
Historically, projects were large, complex undertakings. The first project to
use modern project-management techniques — the Polaris weapons system
in the early 1950s — was a technical and administrative nightmare. Teams of
specialists planned and tracked the myriad of research, development, and
production activities. And they produced mountains of paper to document
the intricate work. As a result, people started to view project management as
a highly technical discipline with confusing charts and graphs; they saw it as
inordinately time-consuming, specialist-driven, and definitely off-limits for the
common man or woman!
Because the world has a growing array of huge, complex, and technically
challenging projects, people are still needed who want to devote their
careers to planning and managing them. But over the past 15 to 20 years, the
number of projects in the regular workplace has skyrocketed. Projects of all
types and sizes are now the way that organizations accomplish their work.
At the same time, a new breed of project manager has emerged. These people
may not have set career goals to become project managers — many don’t
even consider themselves to be project managers. But they do know they
must successfully manage projects in order to move ahead in their careers. In
other words, project management has become a critical skill, not a career
choice.
Even though these people are realizing they need special tools, techniques,
and knowledge to handle their new types of assignments, they may not be
able or willing to devote large amounts of time to acquiring them. I devote
this book to that silent majority of project managers.

About This Book
This book helps you recognize that the basic tenets of successful project
management are simple. The most complex analytical technique takes less
than ten minutes to master! In this book, I introduce information that’s neces-
sary to plan and manage projects, and I provide important guidelines for
developing and using this information. You discover that the real challenge to
a successful project is dealing with the multitude of people whom a project
may affect or need for support. I present plenty of tips, hints, and guidelines
for identifying key players and then involving them.
But knowledge alone won’t make you a successful project manager — you
need to apply it. This book’s theme is that project-management skills and
techniques aren’t burdensome tasks you perform because some process
requires it. Rather, they’re a way of thinking, communicating, and behaving.
They’re an integral part of how we approach all aspects of our work every day.
So I’ve written the book to be direct and (relatively) easy to understand. But
don’t be misled — the simple text still navigates all the critical tools and
techniques you’ll need to support your project planning, scheduling, budget-
ing, organizing, and controlling. So buckle up!
I present this information in a logical and modular progression. Examples and
illustrations are plentiful — so are the tips and hints. And I inject humor from
time to time to keep it all doable. My goal is that you finish this book feeling
that good project management is a necessity and that you’re determined to
practice it!
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book, I use the following conventions to
help you find your way:
 Every time I introduce a new word, I italicize it and then define it.
 I use bold text to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or to highlight
action parts in numbered lists.
 I put all Web sites in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, I want you to read every single word, but I understand your life is
busy and you may only have time to read what’s relevant to your experience.

Project Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

In that case, feel free to skip the sidebars. Although the sidebars offer inter-
esting and real-life stories of my own experiences, they’re not vital to grasp-
ing the concepts. If you do have the time though, read them for some
interesting anecdotes.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I’ve assumed a widely diverse group of people will
read it, including the following:
 Senior managers and junior assistants (the senior managers of tomorrow)
 Experienced project managers and people who’ve never been on a pro-
ject team
 People who’ve had significant project-management training and people
who’ve had none
 People who’ve had years of real-world business and government experi-
ence and people who’ve just entered the workforce
I assume that you have a desire to take control of your environment. After
reading this book, I hope you wonder (and rightfully so) why all projects
aren’t well managed — because you’ll think these techniques are so logical,
straightforward, and easy to use. But I also assume you recognize there’s a
big difference between knowing what to do and doing it. And I assume you
realize you’ll have to work hard to overcome the forces that conspire to pre-
vent you from using these tools and techniques.
Finally, I assume you’ll realize that you can read this book repeatedly and
learn something new and different each time, thinking of this book as a friend
or a comfortable resource that has more to share, as you read between the
lines and experience new situations.
How This Book Is Organized
Like every other For Dummies book, each chapter is self-contained, so you
can read the chapters first that interest you the most. The book is divided
into the following six parts.
3
Introduction

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The
Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
In this part, I discuss the unique characteristics of projects and key issues
that you may encounter in a project-oriented organization. I also show you
how to clearly define your project’s proposed results, how to identify the
people who will play a role, and how to determine your project’s work.
Part II: Determining When and How Much
In this part, I cover how to develop the project schedule and estimate the
resources you need. I also show you how to identify and manage project risks.
Part III: Putting Your Team Together
I show you how to identify, organize, and deal with people who play a part in
your project’s success. I explain how to define team members’ roles and get
your project off to a positive start.
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your
Project to Success
In this part, I explain how to monitor, track, analyze, and report on your pro-
ject’s activities. Then I discuss how to bring your project to a successful closure.
Part V: Taking Your Project Management
to the Next Level
I discuss how to deal with a multiple-project environment, use available tech-
nology to help you plan, organize and control your project, and introduce
your new project-management skills and knowledge into your environment. I
also discuss a technique for evaluating activity performance and resource
expenditures on larger projects.

Project Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has this fun part that gives you tidbits of informa-
tion in an easy-to-chew format. In this part, I share tips on how to plan a pro-
ject and how to be a better project manager. This part also has two additional
nuggets of information: Appendix A is a comprehensive list of the most
common project-management terms and definitions, and Appendix B is an
illustration of the steps for planning your project and for using the essential
controls that I discuss throughout the book.
Icons Used in This Book
I include small icons in the left margins of the book to alert you to special
information in the text. Here’s what they mean:
This icon highlights techniques or approaches to improve your project-
management practices.
I use this icon to point out project-management terms or issues that are a bit
more technical.
This icon leads into real-world and hypothetical situations illustrating tech-
niques and issues.
This icon highlights potential pitfalls and danger spots.
I use this icon to show important information to keep in mind as you apply
the techniques and approaches.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
You can read this book in many ways, depending on your own project-
management knowledge and experience and your current needs. However, 
I suggest you first take a minute to scan the Table of Contents and thumb
through the sections of the book to get a feeling for the topics I address.
If you’re new to project management and are just beginning to form a plan for
a project, first read Parts I and II, which explain how to plan outcomes, activi-
ties, schedules, and resources. If you want to find out how to identify and
organize your project’s team and other key people, start with Chapter 4 and
Part III. If you’re ready to begin work or you’re already in the midst of your
project, you may want to start with Part IV. Or, feel free to jump back and
forth, hitting the chapters with topics that interest you the most.
The most widely recognized reference of project-management best practices
is A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), published
by the Project Management Institute (PMI). The Project Management
Professional (PMP) certification — the most recognized project-management
credential throughout the world — includes an examination (administered by
PMI) with questions based on PMBOK.
Because I base my book on best practices for project-management activities,
the tools and techniques I offer are in accordance with the most recent ver-
sion of PMBOK. However, if you’re preparing to take the PMP examination,
use my book as a companion to PMBOK, not as a substitute for it.
The two books have some significant differences. 
 First and foremost, PMBOK identifies what best practices are but doesn’t
address in detail how to perform them or deal with difficulties you may
encounter as you try to perform them. In contrast, my book focuses
heavily on how to perform the project-management techniques and
processes.
 Second, PMBOK often contains highly technical language and detailed
processes, which people mistakenly dismiss as requirements for larger
projects. My book, however, deliberately frames terms and discussions
to be user-friendly. As a result, people who work on projects of all sizes
can understand how to apply the tools and techniques presented.
In any case, plan on reading all the chapters more than once — the more you
read a chapter, the more sense its approaches and techniques will make. And
who knows? A change in your job responsibilities may create a need for cer-
tain techniques you’ve never used before. Have fun and good luck!

Part I
Understanding
Expectations (The
Who, What, and Why
of Your Project)

In this part . . .
T
he most difficult part of a new project often is decid-
ing where to begin. Expectations are high, while time
and resources are frequently low.
In this part, I identify how a project differs from other
activities you perform in your organization, and I present
a snapshot of the steps you take to plan, organize, and
control your project. I offer you specific techniques and
approaches to clearly define what you want your project
to accomplish and who needs to be involved. Finally, I
show you how to determine the work you’ll have to do to
meet the expectations for your project.

Chapter 1
Project Management: The Key to
Achieving Results
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing projects
 Breaking down project management
 Coming to grips with the project manager’s role
 Cycling through the phases of a project
 Eyeing potential problems with your project
 Examining the requirements for project success
S
uccessful organizations create projects that produce desired results 
in established time frames with assigned resources. As a result, businesses
are increasingly driven to find individuals who can excel in this project-oriented
environment.
Because you’re reading this book, chances are good that you’ve been asked to
manage a project. So, hang on tight — you’re going to need a new set of skills
and techniques to steer that project to successful completion. But not to
worry! This chapter gets you off to a smooth start by showing you what pro-
jects and project management really are and helping you separate projects
from nonproject assignments. The chapter also offers the rationale for why
projects succeed or fail and gets you into the project-management mindset.
What Exactly Is a Project?
No matter what your job, you handle a myriad of assignments every day: 
prepare a memo, hold a meeting, design a sales campaign, or move to new
offices. Or maybe your day sounds more like this: make the information 
systems more user-friendly, develop a research compound in the laboratory,
or improve the organization’s public image. Not all of these assignments are
projects. How can you tell which ones are? This section can help.

Large or small, a project always has the following ingredients:
 Specific outcomes: Products or results (check out Chapter 2 for more on
describing desired results)
 Definite start and end dates: Projects don’t go on forever (refer to
Chapter 5 for developing a schedule for your project)
 Established budgets: Required amounts of people (see Chapter 6), funds
(see Chapter 7), equipment (see Chapter 7), facilities (see Chapter 7),
and information (see Chapter 7)
Each ingredient affects the other two. Expanding specific outcomes may
require more time (a later end date) or more resources. Moving up the end
date may necessitate paring down the results or increasing project expendi-
tures (exceeding the established budgets) by paying overtime to project
staff. Within this three-part project definition, you perform work to achieve
your desired results.
Projects come in a wide assortment of shapes and sizes:
 Large or small
• Installing a new subway system, which may cost more than $1 bil-
lion and take 10 to 15 years to complete, is a project
• Preparing a report of monthly sales figures, which may take you
one day to complete, is a project
 Involving many people or just you
• Training all 10,000 of your organization’s staff in a new affirmative-
action policy is a project
• Rearranging the furniture and equipment in your office is a project
 Defined by a legal contract or an informal agreement
• A signed contract between you and a customer that requires you
to build a house defines a project
• An informal promise you make to install a new software package
on your colleague’s computer defines a project
 Business-related or personal
• Conducting your organization’s annual blood drive is a project
• Having a dinner party for 15 people is a project
No matter what the individual characteristics of your project are, you define
it by the same three ingredients: outcomes, start and end dates, and resources.
The information you need to plan and manage your project is the same,
although the ease and the time to develop it may differ. The more thoroughly
you plan and manage your projects, the more likely you are to succeed.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Defining Project Management
Project management is the process of guiding a project from its beginning
through its performance to its closure. Project management includes three
basic operations:
 Planning: Specifying the desired results, determining the schedules, and
estimating the resources
 Organizing: Defining people’s roles and responsibilities
 Controlling: Reconfirming people’s expected performances, monitoring
actions and results, addressing problems, and sharing information with
interested people
Successfully performing these activities requires:
 Information: Accurate, timely, and complete data for the planning, per-
formance monitoring, and final assessment
 Communication: Clear, open, and timely sharing of information with
appropriate individuals and groups
 Commitment: Team members’ personal promises to produce the agreed-
upon results on time and within budget
11
Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
A project by any other name — just isn’t a project
People often confuse two other terms with 
project:
 A process is a series of routine steps to per-
form a particular function, such as a pro-
curement process or a budget process. A
process isn’t a one-time activity that
achieves a specific result; instead it defines
how a particular function is to be done
every time. Processes like the activities to
buy materials are often parts of projects.
 A program can describe two different situa-
tions. First, it’s a set of goals that gives rise
to specific projects but it can never be com-
pletely accomplished. A health-awareness
program and an employee-morale program
are examples. These programs never com-
pletely achieve their goal (for example, the
public will never be totally aware of all
health issues as a result of a health-aware-
ness program), but one or more projects
may accomplish specific results related to
the program’s goal (such as a workshop on
minimizing the risk of heart disease).
Second, a program sometimes refers to a
group of specified projects that achieve a
common goal.

Projects are temporary, created to achieve particular results. So when the
results are achieved, the project should end. But this transitory nature of pro-
jects may create some challenges such as the following:
 Additional assignments: Project managers may be asked to accept 
a new project in addition to — not in lieu of — existing assignments. 
And they may not be asked how the new work may affect their existing
projects. (Higher management may just assume the project manager 
can handle it all.) When conflicts arise over a person’s time, the guide-
lines or procedures to resolve those conflicts may not exist or may be
inadequate.
 New people on new teams: On small projects, project managers often
seek the help of other people. But on larger efforts, people who haven’t
worked together before may be formally assigned to a project team. In
fact, some people may not even know each other. These unfamiliar rela-
tionships may slow the project down because team members may
• Have different operating and communicating styles.
• Use different procedures for performing the same type of activity.
• Not have had the time to develop mutual respect and trust.
 No direct authority: For most projects, the project manager and team
members have no direct authority over each other. Therefore, the
rewards that usually encourage top performance (such as salary
increases, superior performance appraisals, and job promotions) aren’t
available. In addition, conflicts over time commitments or technical
direction may require input from a number of sources. As a result, they
can’t be settled with one, unilateral decision.
Knowing the Project Manager’s Role
The project manager’s job is challenging. She often coordinates technically
specialized professionals — who may have limited experience working
together — to achieve a common goal. The project manager’s own work expe-
rience is often technical in nature, yet her success requires a keen ability to
identify and resolve sensitive organizational and interpersonal issues.
Looking at the project manager’s tasks
Historically, the performance rules in traditional organizations were simple:
Your boss made assignments; you carried them out. Questioning your assign-
ments was a sign of insubordination or incompetence.
12
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

But these rules have changed. Today, your boss may generate ideas, but you
assess how to implement them. You confirm that a project meets his real
need and then determine the necessary work, schedules, and resources.
It doesn’t make sense to handle a project any other way. The project manager
must be involved in developing the plans because she needs the opportunity
to clarify expectations and proposed approaches and then raise any questions.
The key to project success is to be proactive. Instead of waiting for others to
tell you what to do,
 Seek out information because you know you need it.
 Follow the plan because you believe it’s the best way.
 Involve people who you know are important for the project.
 Raise issues and risks, analyze them, and elicit support to address them.
 Share information with the people you know should have it.
 Put all important information in writing.
 Commit to your project’s success; ask and expect other people to do the
same.
Staving off potential excuses
Be prepared for other people to fight your attempts to be proactive. And
trust me, you’ll have to be prepared for everything! This short section pro-
vides a few examples of excuses that you may encounter as a project man-
ager and the appropriate responses you can give to keep the project on track.
 Excuse: Our projects are all crises; we have no time to plan.
Response: Unfortunately, this logic is illogical! In a crisis, you can’t
afford not to plan. Why? Because you have a critical situation that you
have to address with limited time and resources. You can’t afford to
make mistakes. And acting under pressure and emotion (the two charac-
teristics of crises) practically guarantees that mistakes will occur.
 Excuse: Structured project management is only for large projects.
Response: No matter what size the project, the information you need to
perform it is the same. What are you to produce? What work has to be
done? Who’s going to do it? When will it end? Have you met expectations?
Large projects may require many weeks or months to develop satisfac-
tory answers to these questions. Small projects that last a few days or
less may take 15 minutes. But you still have to answer the questions.
13
Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results

 Excuse: These projects require creativity and new development. They
can’t be predicted with any certainty.
Response: Some projects are more predictable than others. However,
people awaiting the outcomes still have expectations for what they’ll get
and when. Therefore, a project with many uncertainties needs a man-
ager to develop and share initial plans and then assess and communi-
cate the effects of unexpected occurrences.
You may never encounter these specific excuses or you may encounter them
on a regular basis. No matter. Adapt these response examples to address
your own situations.
Considering the Life and 
Times of Your Project
Do you have a good grasp of what a project manager does and what makes a
good project manager? If so, you’re ready for the basics of a project. Every
project, whether large or small, entails five distinct types of work:
 Conceive: Coming up with the idea
 Define: Developing a plan
 Start: Forming a team
 Perform: Doing the work
 Close: Ending the project
For small projects, this entire process can take a few days. Larger projects
may take many years! No matter how simple or complex the project, how-
ever, the process is the same. (Check out Figure 1-1.)

14
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

The conceive phase: In the beginning . . .
All projects begin with an idea. Perhaps your organization’s client identifies a
need, or maybe your boss thinks of a new market to explore, or maybe you
think of a way to refine your organization’s procurement process. When an
idea forms, your project has entered the conceive phase.
Sometimes this phase is informal. For a small project it may just consist of a
discussion and a verbal agreement. In other instances, especially for larger
projects, a project requires a formal review and decision.
Decision-makers consider the following two questions when deciding
whether to move ahead with a project:
 Should we do it? Are the benefits we expect to achieve worth the costs
we’ll have to pay?
 Can we do it? Is the project technically feasible? Are the required
resources available?
If the answer to both questions is “Yes,” the project can proceed to the define
phase (see the following section) where a project plan is developed. If the
answer to either question is a definite, iron-clad “No!” then under no circum-
stances should the project go any farther. If nothing can be done to make it
feasible and desirable, it should be cancelled now. Doing anything else guar-
antees wasted resources, lost opportunities, and a frustrated staff.
Suppose you’re in charge of the publications department in your organiza-
tion. You’ve just received a request to have a 20,000-page document printed
in ten minutes, which requires equipment that can reproduce at the rate of
2,000 pages per minute.
You check with your staff and confirm that your document-reproducing
equipment has a top speed of 500 pages per minute. You check with your
suppliers and find out that the fastest document-reproducing equipment
available today has a top speed of 1,000 pages per minute. Would you agree
to plan and perform this project when you can’t possibly meet the request?
Of course not.
Rather than promising something you know you can’t achieve, consider
asking your customer whether she can change the request. For example, can
she accept the document in 20 minutes? Can you reproduce certain parts of
the document in the first 10 minutes and the rest later?
Sometimes you’re convinced that you can’t meet a request or that the bene-
fits aren’t worth the cost. Be sure to check with the people who developed or
approved the request. They may have information that you don’t, or you may
have additional information that they weren’t aware of.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 
Performing a benefit-cost analysis
A benefit-cost analysis is a comparative assess-
ment of all benefits you anticipate from your pro-
ject with all the costs to introduce the project,
perform it, and support the changes resulting
from it. Benefit-cost analyses help you to
 Decide whether to undertake a project or
decide which of several projects to under-
take
 Frame appropriate project objectives
 Develop appropriate before and after mea-
sures of project success
You can express some anticipated benefits in
monetary equivalents (such as reduced operat-
ing costs or increased revenue). For other ben-
efits, numerical measures can approximate
some, but not all, aspects. If your project is to
improve staff morale, for example, you may con-
sider associated benefits to include reduced
turnover, 
increased 
productivity, 
fewer
absences, and fewer formal grievances. But,
whenever possible, express benefits and costs
in monetary terms to facilitate the assessment
of a project’s net value.
Consider costs for all phases of the project.
Such costs may be nonrecurring (such as labor,
capital investment, and certain operations and
services) or recurring (such as changes in per-
sonnel, supplies, and materials or maintenance
and repair). In addition, consider:
 The potential costs of not doing the project
 The potential costs if the project fails
 Opportunity costs (the potential benefits if
you had spent your funds successfully per-
forming a different project)
The farther into the future you look when per-
forming your analysis, the more important it is
to convert your estimates of benefits over costs
into today’s dollars. Unfortunately, the farther
you look, the less confident you can be of your
estimates. For example, you may expect to reap
benefits for years from a new computer system,
but changing technology may make your new
system obsolete after one year.
Therefore, two key factors influence the results
of a benefit-cost analysis:
 How far into the future you look to identify
benefits
 The assumptions on which you base your
analysis
Although you may not want to go out and design
a cost-benefit analysis by yourself, you defi-
nitely want to see whether your project already
has one and, if so, what the specific results
were.
The excess of a project’s expected benefits over
its estimated costs in today’s dollars is its net
present value (NPV). The net present value is
based on two premises:
 Inflation: The purchasing power of a dollar
will be less one year from now that it is
today. If the rate of inflation is 3 percent for
the next 12 months, a dollar today will be
worth $.97 12 months from today. In other
words, 12 months from now, you’ll pay $1 to
buy what you paid $.97 for today.
 Lost return on investment: The amount you
can earn if you invest your money conserv-
atively today. For example, if you put $1 in a
bank and received simple interest at the
rate of 3 percent compounded annually, 12
months from today you’ll have $1.03 (assum-
ing 0 percent inflation).
To address these considerations when deter-
mining net present value, you specify the fol-
lowing numbers:

Beware of assumptions that you or other people make when assessing your
project’s potential value, cost, and feasibility. For example, just because your
requests for overtime have been turned down in the past doesn’t guarantee
they’ll be turned down again this time.
The define phase: Establish the plan
When you know what you hope to accomplish and you believe it’s possible,
you need a detailed plan to describe how you and your team will make it
happen.
Include the following in your project plan:
 An overview of the reasons for your project (Chapter 2 tells you what to
include)
 A detailed description of results (Chapter 2 explains how to describe
desired results)
 A list of all work (Chapter 4 illustrates how to identify all required pro-
ject work)
 The roles you and your team members will play (Chapter 10 explains
how to describe roles and responsibilities)
 A detailed project schedule (Chapter 5 explains how to develop your
schedule)
 Budgets for required personnel, funds, equipment, facilities, and infor-
mation (Chapter 6 illustrates how to estimate resource needs)
 Assumptions (Chapter 2 discusses how to frame assumptions)
17
Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
 Discount rate: The factor that reflects the
future value of $1 in today’s dollars, consid-
ering the effects of both inflation and lost
return on investment.
 Allowable payback period: The length of
time for anticipated benefits and estimated
costs.
In addition to determining the NPV for different
discount rates and payback periods, figure the
project’s internal rate of return (the value of dis-
count rate that would yield an NPV of 0) for each
payback period.

In addition, be sure to identify and describe how you plan to manage any sig-
nificant risks and uncertainties. (Chapter 8 explains how to identify and plan
for risks.)
Always put your plans in writing; it helps you to clarify details and reduces
the chances that you’ll forget something. Plans for large projects can take
hundreds of pages, although a plan for a small project can take a few lines on
a piece of paper (or a tablecloth!).
The success of your project depends on the clarity and accuracy of your plan
and whether people believe they can achieve it. Whenever you consider past
experience, your plan is more realistic; and whenever you involve people in
the plan’s development, you encourage their commitment to achieving it.
Often the pressure to get fast results encourages people to skip the planning
and get right to the tasks. This strategy can create a lot of immediate activity,
but it also creates significant chances for waste and mistakes.
Be sure your project’s drivers and supporters review and approve the plan in
writing (see Chapter 3) before you begin your project. For a small project,
you may only need a brief e-mail or someone’s initials on the plans.
The start phase: Get ready, get set
Preparing project work requires the following (see Chapter 11 for details):
 Assigning people to all project roles: Identify the individuals who’ll per-
form the project work and negotiate agreements to assure they’ll be
available to work on the project team.
 Giving and explaining tasks to all team members: Describe to each
team member the work that he or she is to produce and how the team
members will coordinate their efforts.
 Defining how the team will perform the necessary tasks: Decide how
the team will handle routine communications, make different project
decisions, and resolve conflicts.
 Setting up necessary tracking systems: Decide which system(s) and
accounts you’ll use to track schedules, work effort, and expenditures.
 Announcing the project to the organization: Let the necessary people
know that your project exists, what it will produce, and when it will
begin and end.
18
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Suppose you don’t join your project team until the start phase. Your first task
is to understand how people decided (during the conceive phase) that the
project was possible and desirable. If people have overlooked important
issues, you need to raise them now. When searching for the project’s history,
check minutes from meetings, memos, letters, e-mails, and technical reports.
Then consult with all of the people involved in the decision.
The perform phase: Go!
Finally you get to perform the project work! This phase entails the following
(see Chapters 12, 13, and 14 for more details):
 Doing the tasks: Perform the work that’s in your plan.
 Continually comparing performance with plans: Collect information on
outcomes, schedule achievements, and resource expenditures; identify
deviations from your plan; and develop corrective actions.
 Fixing problems that arise: Change tasks, schedules, or resources to
bring project performance back on track with the existing plan, or nego-
tiate agreed-upon changes to the plan itself.
 Keeping everyone informed: Tell people about the team’s achieve-
ments, project problems, and necessary revisions to the established
plan.
The close phase: Stop!
Finishing your assigned tasks is only part of bringing your project to a close.
In addition, you must do the following (see Chapter 15 for discussions on
each of these points):
 Get your clients’ approvals of the final results.
 Close all project accounts (if you’ve been charging time and money to
special project accounts).
 Help people move on to their next assignments.
 Hold a postproject evaluation to recognize project achievements and to
discuss lessons you can apply to the next project. (At the very least,
make informal notes about these lessons and how you’ll use them in the
future.) See Chapter 15 for how to prepare, design, and conduct a post-
project evaluation.

Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results

Anticipating the Most Common Mistakes
The short-term pressures of your job may encourage you to act today in
ways that cause you to pay a price tomorrow. Especially with smaller, less
formal projects, you may feel no need for organized planning and control.
Don’t be seduced into the following, seemingly-easier shortcuts:
 Jumping directly from the conceive phase to the perform phase: You
have an idea and your project’s on a short schedule. Why not just start
doing the work? Sounds good, but you haven’t defined the activities!
Other variations on this shortcut include the following:
• “Our project’s been done many times before, so why do I have to
plan it out again?”
Even though projects can be similar to past ones, some elements
are always different. Perhaps you’re working with some new
people, using a new piece of equipment, and so on. Take a moment
now to be sure your plan addresses the current situation.
• “Our project’s different from before, so what good is trying to
plan?”
This is like saying you’re traveling in an unknown area, so why try
to lay out your route on a road map? Planning for a new project is
important because no one’s taken this particular path before.
Although your initial plan may have to be revised during the pro-
ject, you and your team need to have a clear statement of your
intended plan.
 Omitting the start phase completely: Time pressure is often the culprit
here. People don’t appreciate the need to define procedures and rela-
tionships before jumping into the actual project work. See Chapter 11 for
a discussion of why this phase is so important — and get tips on how to
complete it.
 Jumping into the work when you join the project during the start
phase: The plan has already been developed, so why go back and revisit
the conceive and define phases? Actually, you do this for two reasons:
• To identify any issues that the developers may have overlooked
• To understand the reasoning behind the plan and decide whether
you feel the plan is achievable
 Only partially completing the close phase: At the end of one project,
you often move right on to the next. Scarce resources and short dead-
lines encourage this, and a new project is always more challenging than
wrapping up an old one.

However, you never really know how successful your project is if you
don’t take the time to ensure that all tasks are complete and that you’ve
satisfied your clients. And if you don’t take positive steps to apply the
lessons this project’s taught you, you’re likely to make the same mis-
takes again or fail to repeat this project’s successful approaches.
Do I Have What It Takes to Be an
Effective Project Manager?
You’re reading this book because you want to be a better project manager.
However, before you really jump in, I suggest you do a quick self-evaluation to
see what your strengths and weaknesses are. By answering these ten ques-
tions, you’ll get an idea of what subjects to spend more time on so you can be
as effective as possible. Good luck.
Questions
1. Are you more concerned about being everyone’s friend or getting a job
done right?
2. Do you prefer to do technical work or manage other people doing tech-
nical work?
3. Do you think the best way to get a tough task done is to do it yourself?
4. Do you prefer your work to be predictable or constantly changing?
5. Do you prefer to spend your time developing ideas instead of explaining
those ideas to other people?
6. Do you handle crises well?
7. Do you prefer to work by yourself or with others?
8. Do you think you shouldn’t have to monitor people after they’ve
promised to do a task for you?
9. Do you believe people should be self-motivated to perform their jobs?
10. Are you comfortable dealing with people at all organizational levels?
Answers
1. Although maintaining good working relations is important, the project
manager often must make decisions for the good of the project that
some people don’t agree with.
21
Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results

2. Most project managers achieved their position because of their strong
performance on technical tasks. However, after you become a project
manager, your job is to encourage other people to produce high-quality
technical work rather than to do it all yourself.
3. Believing in yourself is important. However, the project manager’s task is
to help other people develop to the point where they can perform tasks
with the highest quality.
4. The project manager tries to minimize unexpected problems and situa-
tions through responsive planning and timely control. However, when
problems do occur, the project manager must deal with them promptly
to minimize their impact on the project.
5. Though coming up with ideas can help your project, the project man-
ager’s main responsibility is to ensure everyone correctly understands
all ideas that are developed.
6. The project manager’s job is to provide a cool head to size up the situa-
tion, choose the best action, and encourage all members to do their
parts in implementing the solution.
7. Self-reliance and self-motivation are important characteristics for a pro-
ject manager. However, the key to her success is to facilitate interaction
among a diverse group of technical specialists.
8. Although you may feel that honoring one’s commitments is a fundamen-
tal element of professional behavior, the project manager should ensure
that people maintain their focus and should model how to cooperatively
work with others.
9. They should be, but the project manager should encourage them to
remain motivated by their job assignments and related opportunities.
10. The project manager deals with people at all levels, from upper manage-
ment to support staff, who perform project-related activities.

Clarifying What You’re Trying
to Accomplish — and Why
In This Chapter
 Understanding your project’s Statement of Work (SOW)
 Clarifying the need for the project
 Handling the unknowns
 Forming your own Statement of Work
A
ll projects are created for a reason. Someone identifies a need and
devises a project to address that need. How well the project ultimately
addresses that need defines the project’s success or failure.
This chapter helps you develop a mutual agreement between the project’s
requesters and the project team about your project’s goals. It also helps you
establish the conditions necessary to perform the project work.
Defining Your Project with
a Statement of Work
A Statement of Work (SOW) is a written confirmation of what your project will
produce and the terms and conditions under which you will perform your
work. Both the people who requested the project and the project team
should agree to all terms in the SOW before actual project work begins.

Your SOW includes the following information:
 Purpose: How and why your project came to be, the scope of your pro-
ject, and its general approach
 Objectives: Specific outcomes you’ll produce
 Constraints: Restrictions that will limit what you achieve, how and when
you can achieve it, and their cost
 Assumptions: Statements about how you will address uncertain informa-
tion as you conceive, plan, and perform your project
24
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 
Kissing cousins: Documents closely related 
to a Statement of Work
Your organization may use a number of other
documents that address issues similar to those
in the Statement of Work (SOW). If you use
these as sources of information to prepare or
describe your project plan, be careful to note
how they differ from your SOW.
 Market requirements document: A formal
request to develop or modify a product. This
document (typically a member of your orga-
nization’s sales and marketing group pre-
pares it) may lead to the creation of a
project. However, in its original form, this
document only reflects the desires of the
person who wrote it. It doesn’t reflect an
assessment of whether it’s possible or in
the company’s best interest to meet the
request, nor is it a commitment to meet it.
 Business requirements document:
A
description of the business needs that a
requested product, service, or system must
address.
 Project request: A written request for a pro-
ject by a group within the organization. The
project request indicates a desire for a project
rather than a mutual agreement and com-
mitment to perform it.
 Project charter: A document issued by
upper management that formally estab-
lishes a project and authorizes the project
manager to use organizational resources to
perform project activities.
 Project profile: Highlights of key informa-
tion about a project. Sometimes this is also
called a project summary or a project
abstract.
 Work order: A written description of work
that people or groups within your organiza-
tion will perform in support of your project.
The signed work order focuses on work
performance rather than overall project
outcomes.
 Contract: A legal agreement for goods or
services from an external vendor or con-
tractor. On occasion, the term Statement of
Work refers to the part of a contract that
describes these goods and services.

Think of your SOW as a binding agreement.
 You and your team commit to producing certain results.
Your project’s requesters commit that they’ll consider your project 100
percent successful if you produce these results.
 You and your team identify all restrictions regarding your approach to
the work and what you need to support your work.
Your project’s requesters agree there are no restrictions other than the
ones you have identified and that they’ll provide you the support you
declare you need.
 You and your team identify all assumptions you made when agreeing to
the terms of your SOW.
Of course, predicting the future is impossible. In fact, the farther into the
future you try to look, the less certain your predictions can be. However,
your SOW represents your project commitments based on what you know
today and expect to be true in the future. If and when situations change,
you’ll assess the effect of the changes on your SOW and propose the neces-
sary corresponding changes to your project. Your project’s requesters always
have the option of accepting your proposed changes (allowing the project to
continue) or canceling your project.
Looking at the Big Picture: 
How Your Project Fits In
Understanding the situation and thought processes that led to your project
helps ensure that your project successfully meets people’s expectations.
Your project’s purpose statement should include the following information:
 Background: Why people authorized your project
 Scope: What work will be performed
 Strategy: How you’ll approach the major work of this project
This section helps you identify all the people who may use your project’s
results and their specific expectations, needs, and interests. The section also
helps you clarify the extent of the project’s work and describe your strategies
for accomplishing major project activities.
25
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

Figuring out why you’re doing this project
When you take on a project, why you’re doing it may seem obvious —
because your boss told you to. The real question, though, is not why you
choose to accept the assignment but why the project must be done in the
first place.
The following sections help you identify people who may benefit from your
project so you can then determine their specific expectations and needs
regarding the project.
Identifying the initiator
As your first task, determine who had the original idea that led to your pro-
ject. Project success requires that, at a minimum, you meet this person’s
needs and expectations.
Identifying your project’s initiator is easy when he directly assigns it to you.
More likely, however, the person who assigns the project is passing along an
assignment he received from someone else. If your project has passed
through several people before it reaches you, you may have difficulty deter-
mining who really had the initial idea. Further, the original intent may have
become blurred if every person in the chain purposely or inadvertently
changed the assignment a little as he passed it on.
Take the following steps to determine who came up with the original idea for
your project.
1. Ask the person who assigns you the project whether she originated
the idea.
2. If that person’s didn’t initiate the idea, ask:
Who gave her the assignment?
Who else, if anyone, was involved in passing the assignment to
her?
Who had the original idea for the project?
3. Check with any other people you identified in Step 2 and ask them the
same questions.
4. Check the following written records that may confirm who originally
had the idea:
Minutes from division-, department-, and organization-wide plan-
ning and budget sessions
Correspondence and e-mail referring to the project
Reports of planning or feasibility studies
26
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

A feasibility study is a formal investigation to determine the likely suc-
cess of performing certain work or achieving certain results.
In addition to helping you identify the people who initiated your project,
these sources may shed light on what these people hope to get from it.
5. Consult with people who may be affected by or need to support your
project; they may know who originated the idea.
Identify your project initiator by name and position description. In other
words, don’t write “The sales department requested promotional literature
for product Alpha,” but write “Mary Smith, the sales representative for the
northeast region, requested promotional literature for product Alpha.”
Distinguish between drivers and supporters as you seek to find your project
initiator. (See Chapter 3 for more information about drivers and supporters.)
 Drivers have some say when defining the results of the project. They tell
you what you should do.
 Supporters help you perform your project. They tell you what you can do.
For example, suppose the vice president of finance requests a project to
upgrade the organization’s financial information systems — she’s a project
driver. The manager of the computer center must provide staff and resources
to upgrade the organization’s information systems — he’s a project supporter.
Sometimes supporters claim to be drivers. For example, when the manager of
the computer center is asked, he may say he initiated the project. In reality,
the manager authorized the people and funds to perform the project, but the
vice president of finance initiated it.
Recognizing other people who may benefit from your project
Although they may not have initiated the idea, other people may benefit from
your completed project. They may be people who work with, support, or are
clients of your project’s drivers, or they may have performed similar pro-
jects. They may have expressed interests or needs in areas addressed by
your project in meetings, correspondence, or informal conversations.
Identify these people as soon as possible to determine their particular needs
and interests and how you can appropriately address them. These additional
audiences may include people who
 Know the project exists and have expressed an interest in it.
 Know it exists but don’t realize it can benefit them.
 Are unaware of your project.
27
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

Identify these additional audiences by
 Reviewing all written materials related to your project.
 Consulting with your project’s drivers and supporters.
 Encouraging everyone that you speak to about the project to identify
others they think may benefit from it.
As you identify people who can benefit from your project, also identify people
who strongly oppose it. Figure out why they oppose your project and whether
you can address their concerns. Take the time to determine whether they
may be able to derive any benefits from your project and, if so, explain these
benefits to them. If they continue to oppose your project, make note in your
risk-management plan of their opposition and how you plan to deal with it
(see Chapter 8 for how to analyze and plan for project risks and uncertainties).
Distinguishing the project champion
A project champion is a person in a high position in the organization who
strongly supports your project; advocates for your project in disputes, plan-
ning meetings, and review sessions; and takes necessary actions to help
ensure that your project is successful. (See Chapter 3 for more discussion
about a project champion.)
Sometimes the best champion is one whose support you never have to use.
Just knowing that this person supports your project helps other people
appreciate its importance and encourages them to work diligently to ensure
its success.
Check with your project’s drivers and supporters to find out whether your
project already has a champion. If it doesn’t, work hard to recruit one by
looking for people who can reap benefits from your project and who have suf-
ficient power and influence to encourage serious, ongoing organizational
commitment to your project. Explain to these people why the success of your
project is in their best interest and how you may need their specific help as
your project progresses. Assess how interested they are in your project and
how much help they’re willing to provide.
Considering people who’ll implement the results of your project
Most projects create a product or service to achieve a desired result. Often,
however, the person who asks you to create the product or service isn’t the
one who’ll actually use it.
Suppose your organization’s director of sales and marketing wants to
increase annual sales by 10 percent in the next fiscal year. She decides that
developing and introducing a new product, XYZ, will allow her to achieve this
goal. However, she won’t actually go to all of your organization’s customers
and sell them XYZ; her sales staff will. Even though they didn’t come up with
28
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

the idea to develop XYZ, the sales staff may have strong opinions about the
characteristics XYZ should have — and so will the customers who ultimately
buy (or don’t buy!) the product.
To identify the users of project products and services, try to
 Clarify the products and services that you anticipate producing.
 Identify exactly who will use these products and services and how
they’ll use them.
After you identify these people, consult with them to determine any addi-
tional interests or needs they may have that your project should also
address.
Determining your project drivers’ real expectations and needs
The needs that your project addresses may not always be obvious. Suppose,
for example, that your organization decides to sponsor a blood drive. Does
this project address the shortage of blood in the local hospital or does it
improve your organization’s image in the local community?
When you clearly understand the needs your project must satisfy, you can
 Choose project activities that enable you to accomplish the true desired
results (see Chapter 4 for information on identifying project activities).
 Monitor performance during and at the end of the project to ensure that
you’re meeting the real needs (see Chapter 12 for more information on
how to track a project during performance).
 Realize when the project isn’t meeting the real needs and suggest modi-
fying or canceling it.
You hope that you’re told what the project should produce and the needs it
should address when you’re initially assigned the project. However, usually
you’re told what to produce (the outcomes), and you have to figure out the
needs yourself. Check out the sidebar “Know your project’s true measure of
success” in this chapter for an example.
Consider the following questions as you work to define the needs:
 What needs do people want your project to address? Don’t worry at
this point whether your project actually can address these needs or
whether it’s the best way to address the needs. You’re just trying to
identify the hopes and expectations that led up to this project.
 How do you know that the needs you identify are the real hopes and
expectations that people have for your project? Determining people’s
real thoughts and feelings can be difficult. Sometimes they don’t want to
share them; sometimes they don’t know how to express them clearly.
29
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

When speaking with people to determine the needs your project should
address, try the following suggestions:
 Encourage them to speak at length about their needs and expectations.
 Listen carefully for any contradictions
 Encourage them to clarify vague ideas.
 Try to confirm your information from two or more sources.
See whether your organization performed a formal benefit-cost analysis for
your project. A benefit-cost analysis (see Chapter 1 for further details) is a
formal identification and assessment of
 The benefits anticipated from your project
 The costs for
• Performing your project
• Using and supporting the products or services produced by your
project
The benefit-cost analysis documents the results that people were counting on
when they decided to proceed with your project. Therefore, the analysis is an
important source for the real needs that your project should address.
30
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 
Know your project’s true measure of success
A friend of mine received an assignment to
develop a new product from his boss, who had
just returned from an upper-management
retreat. Max knew that company sales had
been dipping and that the purpose of the retreat
was to discuss possible approaches for revers-
ing the trend. He also knew that the company’s
highly skilled market-research department had
been investigating new product ideas for the
past six months. Max assumed, therefore, that
upper management had established this project
to increase sales in the coming year, based on
recommendations from the market research
department.
Max’s conclusion was reasonable but com-
pletely wrong. In reality, right before the retreat,
the company president had received a call from
a friend who asked whether the company mar-
keted a product like XYZ. Instead of admitting
that his company wasn’t state-of-the-art, the
president promised to provide the product. In
fact, no one had any idea whether anyone other
than the president’s friend would ever buy the
product! When Max found out the truth, he real-
ized that this project’s true measure of success
was the president’s friend’s reaction to XYZ —
not the sales increase as a result of introducing
XYZ into the company’s product line.

Assuring that your project addresses people’s needs
Although needs may be thoroughly documented, you may have difficulty
determining whether your project can successfully address those needs. On
occasion, companies fund formal feasibility studies to determine whether a
project can successfully address a particular need.
Other times, however, your project may be the result of a brainstorming ses-
sion or someone’s creative vision. In this case, you may have less confidence
that your project can accomplish expected results. Don’t automatically reject
a project at this point but aggressively determine the chances for success
and how you can increase these chances. If you can’t find sufficient informa-
tion to support your analysis, consider asking for a formal feasibility study.
If you feel the risk of project failure is too great, share your concerns with the
key decision makers and explain why you recommend not proceeding. See
the discussion of risk management in Chapter 8 for more information.
Uncovering other activities that relate to your project
Your project doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It may require results from other pro-
jects, it may generate products that other projects will use, and it may
address needs that other projects also address. You should identify projects
related to yours as soon as possible so you can coordinate the use of shared
personnel and resources and minimize unintended overlap in project activi-
ties and results.
Emphasizing the importance of your project to the organization
How much importance the organization places on your project directly influ-
ences the chances for your project’s success. When conflicting demands for
scarce resources arise, resources usually go to those projects that can pro-
duce the greatest benefits for the organization.
Your project’s perceived value depends on its intended benefits and people’s
awareness of those benefits. Take the following steps to help people under-
stand how your project will support the organization’s priorities:
 Look for existing statements that confirm your project’s support of
organization’s priorities. Consult the following sources to find out more
about your organization’s priorities:
• Long-range plan: A formal report that identifies your organiza-
tion’s overall direction, specific performance targets, and individ-
ual initiatives for the next one to five years
• Annual budget: The detailed list of categories and individual initia-
tives that require organization funds during the year
31
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

• Capital appropriations plan: The itemized list of all planned
expenditures (over an established minimum amount) for facilities
and equipment purchases, renovations, and repairs during the
year
• Your organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Performance measures that describe your organization’s progress
towards its goals
When you review these documents, note whether your project or its
intended outcome is specifically mentioned.
In addition, determine whether your organization has made specific
commitments to external customers or upper management related to
your project’s completion.
 Describe in the Background portion of your purpose statement how
your project relates to the organization’s priorities. Include existing
discussions of your project from the information sources mentioned pre-
viously. If your project isn’t specifically referenced in these sources, pre-
pare a written explanation of how your project and its results will impact
the organization’s priorities.
Occasionally you may find it difficult to identify specific results that people
expect your project to generate. Perhaps the person who initiated the project
has assumed different responsibilities and no longer has any interest in it, or
maybe the original need the project was designed to address has changed. If
people have trouble telling you how your project will help your organization,
ask them what would happen if you didn’t perform your project. If everyone
concludes that it wouldn’t make a difference, ask them how your project can
be modified to benefit the organization. If they feel it can’t be changed to pro-
duce useful results, consider suggesting that the project be cancelled.
Organizations are consistently overworked and understaffed. Spending pre-
cious time and resources on a project that everyone agrees will make no dif-
ference is the last thing the organization needs or wants.
More likely, people do realize that your project can have a positive impact on
the organization. Your job, then, is to help these people consistently focus on
these valuable results.
Being exhaustive in your search for information
You’re seeking information that’s sensitive, sometimes contradictory, and
often verbal (not in writing). Getting the information isn’t always easy, but
these tips can help:
32
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Try to find several sources for the same piece of information. The
greater the number of independent sources that contain the same infor-
mation, the more likely the information is correct.
 Whenever possible, get information from primary sources. A primary
source contains the original information. A secondary source is someone
else’s report of the information from the primary source.
Suppose you need information from a recently completed study. You can
get the information from the primary source (which is the actual report
of the study by the scientists who performed it), or you can get it from
secondary sources (such as articles in magazines or scientific journals
by authors who paraphrased and summarized the original information).
The farther your source is from the primary source, the more likely the
secondary information differs from the real information.
 Written sources are the best. Check relevant minutes from meetings,
correspondence, e-mail, reports from other projects, long-range plans,
budgets, capital improvement plans, market-requirement documents,
and benefit-cost analyses.
 Speak to two or more people from the same area to confirm informa-
tion. Different people have different styles of communication as well as
different perceptions of the same situation. Speak with more than one
person and compare their messages to determine any contradictions.
If you get different stories, speak with the people again to verify their ini-
tial information. Determine whether the people you consulted are pri-
mary or secondary sources (primary sources tend to be more accurate
than secondary ones). Ask the people you consulted to explain or recon-
cile any remaining differences.
 When speaking with people about important information, arrange to
have at least one other person present. Doing so allows two different
people to interpret what they heard from the same individual.
 Write down all information you obtain from personal meetings. Share
your written notes and summaries with other people who were present
at the meeting to ensure that your interpretation was correct and to
serve as a reminder of agreements.
 Plan to meet at least two times with key audiences. Your first meeting
starts them thinking about issues. Allow some time for them to think
over your initial discussions and to think of new ideas related to those
issues. A second meeting also gives you a chance to clarify any ambigui-
ties or inconsistencies from the first session. (See Chapter 3 for more
information on project audiences.)
 Wherever possible, confirm what you heard in personal meetings
with written sources. When you talk with people, they share their per-
ceptions and opinions. Compare those perceptions and opinions with
written, factual data (from primary sources, if possible). Discuss any dis-
crepancies with those same people.
33
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

Drawing the line: Where your 
project starts and stops
Sometimes your project stands alone, but more often it’s one part of related
efforts to achieve a common result. You want to avoid duplicating the work of
these other projects, and, where appropriate, you want to coordinate your
work with theirs.
Your project’s statement of scope should clearly describe where your project
starts and where it ends. Suppose your project develops a new product for
your organization. You may describe your project’s scope as follows:
This project entails designing, developing, and testing a new product.
If you feel your statement is in any way ambiguous, you may clarify your
scope further by stating what you will not do:
This project won’t include finalizing the market requirements or launch-
ing the new product.
To make sure your scope description is clear,
 Check for hidden inferences. Suppose your boss has asked you to
design and develop a new product. Check to be sure she doesn’t assume
you’ll also perform the market research to determine the new product’s
characteristics.
 Use words that clearly describe intended activities. Suppose your
project includes the implementation of a new information system. Are
you sure that everyone defines implementation in the same way? For
instance, do people expect it to include installing the new software,
training people to use it, evaluating its performance, fixing problems
with it, or something else?
 Confirm your understanding of your project’s scope with your
project’s drivers and supporters.
A colleague of mine had an assignment to prepare for the competitive
acquisition of certain equipment. She developed a plan to include the
selection of the vendor, award of the contract, and production and deliv-
ery of the equipment. Her boss was stunned with my colleague’s project
estimate of six months and $500,000. He thought it would take less than
two months and cost less than $25,000.
After a brief discussion with her boss, my colleague realized she was
only to select the potential vendor, not actually place the order and have
34
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

the equipment delivered. Although she clarified her misunderstanding,
she still wondered aloud, “But why would we select a vendor if we didn’t
want to actually buy the equipment?”
Of course, she missed the point. The question wasn’t whether the com-
pany planned to buy the equipment. (Certainly the intention to buy the
equipment was the reason for her project.) The real question was
whether her project or a different project in the future would purchase
the equipment.
Designing your approach to project work
Your project strategy is the general approach you plan to take to perform the
work in your project scope. Examples of a project strategy include the 
following:
 We’ll buy the needed supplies from an outside vendor.
 We’ll conduct our training in instructor-led sessions.
Your project strategy can help determine whether you’re able to meet the
demands and expectations of your audiences. As early as possible, find out
whether any of your audiences has preconceived ideas about how to — or
how not to — approach the project. If you feel your client’s approaches will
work, consider using them. If you feel they won’t, explain why to your client
and explain the strategies you will use.
When selecting a strategy,
 Consider your organization’s usual approaches for handling similar
projects. Chances of a mistake are smaller if you ask people to use
processes or procedures they’ve used before.
 Where possible, choose a strategy with the fewest risks, uncertainties,
and uncontrollables. You don’t want a strategy that may work; you want
one with the greatest chance that it will work.
 For riskier projects, consider developing backup strategies in case
your primary strategy runs into problems. A different strategy may be
the simple answer for meeting an unachievable expectation.
A strategy isn’t a detailed list of activities. You derive activity lists from your
project Work Breakdown Structure, which Chapter 4 describes in detail. If
you haven’t chosen a strategy before you prepare your SOW, make a note in
the SOW that the strategy is to be determined (TBD). This note can remind
you that you’re actually going to do it at some future point!

Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

Specifying your project’s objectives
Objectives are outcomes your project will produce. These outcomes may be
products or services you develop or the results of using these products and
services. The more clearly you define your project’s objectives, the more
likely you’ll achieve them.
Include the following elements to make your objectives clear and specific:
 Statement: A brief narrative description of what you want to achieve
 Measures: Indicators you’ll use to assess your achievement
 Performance targets: The value of each measure that defines success
Suppose you take on a project to reformat a report that summarizes monthly
sales activity. You may frame your project’s objective as shown in Table 2-1.
36
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 
Facing challenging expectations
When you plan to perform an activity that you’ve
successfully done before, you often use the
same strategy that worked in the past. That
strategy is fine if it allows you to meet your cur-
rent project’s requirements and expectations. If
it doesn’t, however, you must explore different
approaches. When you have challenging
expectations, try the following:
 Be careful not to assume a particular
approach just because you’ve always used
it in the past. A client of mine was criticized
for buying a piece of equipment from a
vendor that charged 20 percent more for
the item than other vendors. When asked
why he hadn’t checked out the other ven-
dors, he replied that the organization had
used this vendor for years and no one had
complained before.
 Be careful not to prejudge other people’s
willingness to use different approaches.
Years ago I had to get a proposal out the
door by the end of the week, and I needed a
full day of secretarial support to meet my
deadline. However, the company’s secre-
taries were all tied up with other assign-
ments. When I told my boss we couldn’t get
the proposal out on time, he asked me why.
I explained that all the secretaries were
busy and the company had always turned
down requests for temporary secretarial
help. He stunned me by saying that, if the
choice was between hiring a temp and
missing the due date, I should hire a temp!

Sometimes people try to avoid setting a specific target by only establishing a
range. But a range just avoids the issue.
Suppose you’re a sales representative and your boss says you’ll be successful
if you achieve $20 million to $25 million in sales for the year. As far as you’re
concerned, you’ll be 100 percent successful as soon as you reach $20 million.
Most likely, however, your boss will consider you 100 percent successful only
when you reach $25 million. Although you and your boss appeared to reach
agreement, you didn’t.
Making your objectives clear and specific
You need to be crystal clear when stating your project’s objectives. The more
specific your project objectives, the greater your chances are of achieving
them. Here are some tips for developing clear objectives:
 Be brief when describing an objective. If you take an entire page to
describe a single objective, most people won’t read it. Even if they do
read it, your objective probably won’t be clear and may have multiple
interpretations.
37
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

 Don’t use technical jargon. Each industry (such as pharmaceuticals,
telecommunications, finance, and insurance) has its own vocabulary
and so does each company within that industry. Within companies, dif-
ferent departments (such as accounting, legal, and information services)
also have their own jargon. The same three-letter acronym (TLA) can
have two or more meanings in the same organization!
 Make your objectives SMART, as follows:
• Specific: Define your objective clearly, in detail, with no room for
misinterpretation.
• Measurable: Specify the measures or indicators you’ll use to deter-
mine whether you’ve met your objective.
• Aggressive: Set challenging objectives that encourage people to
stretch beyond their comfort zones.
• Realistic: Set objectives the project team believes it can achieve.
• Time-sensitive: Include the date by which you’ll achieve the 
objective.
 Make your objectives controllable. Make sure that you and your team
believe you can influence the success of each objective. If you don’t
believe you can, you may not commit to achieve it (and most likely you
won’t even try). In that case, it becomes a wish, not an objective.
 Identify all objectives. Time and resources are always scarce, so if you
don’t specify an objective, you won’t (and shouldn’t) work to achieve it.
 Be sure drivers and supporters agree on your project’s objectives.
When drivers buy into your objectives, you feel confident that achieving
the objectives constitutes true project success. And when supporters
buy into your objectives, you have the greatest chance that people will
work their hardest to achieve them.
If drivers don’t agree with your objectives, revise them until they do agree.
After all, your drivers’ needs are the whole reason for your project! If sup-
porters don’t buy into your objectives, work with them to identify their con-
cerns and develop approaches they think can work.
Probing for all types of objectives
When you start a project, the person who makes the request often tells you
the major results he wants to achieve. However, he may want the project to
address other items that he forgot to mention. And other (as yet unidentified)
people may also want your project to accomplish certain results.
You need to identify all project objectives as early as possible so you can
plan for and devote the necessary time and resources to accomplish each
one. When you probe to identify all possible objectives, consider that pro-
jects may have objectives in the following three categories:
38
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 A physical product or service
 The effect of a product or service
 A general organizational benefit that wasn’t the original reason for the
project
Consider that your Information Technology (IT) department is about to pur-
chase and install a new software package for searching and analyzing infor-
mation in the company’s parts-inventory database. The following are
examples of objectives this project may have in each category:
 Product or service: The completed installation and integration of the
new software package with the parts-inventory database
 An effect of the product or service: Reduced inventory storage-costs
due to timelier ordering with the new software
 A general organizational benefit: Use of the new software with other
company databases.
An objective is different from a serendipity (a chance occurrence or coinci-
dence). In the previous example of the new software package, consider that
one project driver won’t be completely satisfied unless the software for the
parts-inventory database is also installed and integrated with the company’s
product-inventory database. In this case, installing the system on the com-
pany’s product-inventory database must be an objective of your project so
you must devote specific time and resources to accomplish it. On the other
hand, if your audience will be happy whether you do or don’t install the soft-
ware on the second database, then being able to use the software on that
database is a serendipity — so you shouldn’t devote any time or resources
specifically to accomplishing it.
Determining all project objectives requires you to identify all drivers who
may have specific expectations for your project. See Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of the different types of audiences and how to identify them all.
Anticipating resistance to clearly defined objectives
Some people are uncomfortable committing to specific objectives because
they’re concerned they may not achieve them. Unfortunately, no matter what
the reason, not having specific objectives makes it more difficult to know
whether you’re addressing your drivers’ true expectations and whether
you’re meeting those expectations. In other words, when you have no spe-
cific objectives, you increase the chances that your project won’t succeed.
Here are some excuses people give for not being too specific along with sug-
gestions for addressing those excuses.
39
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

 Excuse 1: Too much specificity stifles creativity.
The response: Creativity should be encouraged — the question is
where and when. You want your project’s drivers to be clear and pre-
cise when stating their objectives; you want your project’s supporters to
be creative when figuring ways to meet these objectives. You want to
understand what people do expect from your project, not what they may
expect. The more clearly you can describe their actual objectives, the
easier it is to determine whether (and how) you can meet them.
 Excuse 2: Your project entails research and new development, and
you can’t tell today what you’ll be able to accomplish.
The response: Objectives are targets, not guarantees. Certain projects
have more risks than others. When you haven’t done a task before, you
don’t know whether it’s possible. And, if it is possible, you don’t know
how long it’ll take and how much it’ll cost. But you must state at the
outset exactly what you want to achieve and what you think is possible,
even though you may have to change your objectives as the project 
progresses.
 Excuse 3: What if interests or needs change?
The response: Objectives are targets based on what you know and
expect today. If conditions change in the future, you may have to revisit
one or more objectives to see whether they’re still relevant and feasible
or whether they, too, must change.
 Excuse 4: The requestor doesn’t know what he specifically wants his
project to achieve.
The response: Ask him to come back when he does. If you begin work-
ing on his project now, you have a greater chance of wasting time and
resources to produce results that he later decides he doesn’t want.
 Excuse 5: Even though specific objectives help determine when you’ve
succeeded, they also make it easier to determine when you haven’t.
The response: Yep. That’s true.
Marking the Boundaries
You want to operate in a world where everything is possible — that is, where
you can do anything necessary to achieve your desired results. Your clients
and your organization, on the other hand, want to believe that you can
achieve everything with minimal or no cost to them. Of course, neither situa-
tion is true.
40
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Defining the restrictions on your approach introduces reality to your plans
and helps clarifies expectations. Think in terms of the following:
 Limitations: Restrictions that other people place on the results you have
to achieve, the time frames you have to meet, the resources you can use,
and the way you can approach your tasks
 Needs: Requirements that you specify to achieve project success
This section helps you determine your project’s limitations and needs.
Working within limitations
Project limitations may influence how you perform your project and may
even determine whether to proceed with your project. Consult with your pro-
ject’s drivers and supporters to identify limitations as early as possible so
you can design your plan to accommodate them.
Understanding the types of limitations
Project limitations typically fall into several categories. By recognizing these
categories, you can focus your investigations and thereby increase the
chances that you’ll discover any limitations. Your project’s drivers and sup-
porters may have preset expectations or requirements regarding
 Results: The products and effect of your project. For example, the new
item must cost no more than $300 per item to manufacture or the book
must be less than 384 pages in length.
 Time frames: When you must produce certain results. For example, your
project must be done by June 30. You don’t know whether it’s possible
to finish by June 30; you just know that someone expects the product
then.
 Resources: The type, amount, and availability of resources to perform
your project work. Resources can include people, funds, equipment, raw
materials, facilities, information, and so on. Examples are: You have a
budget of $100,000; you can have two people full time for three months;
or you can’t use the test laboratory during the first week in June.
 Activity performance: The strategies for performing different tasks. For
example, you understand that you must use your organization’s printing
department to reproduce the new user’s manuals for the system you’re
developing. You don’t know what the manual will look like, how many
pages it’ll be, the number of copies you’ll need, or when you’ll need
them. Therefore, you can’t know whether your organization’s printing
department is up to the task. But at this point, you do know that some-
one expects you to have the printing department do the work.
41
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

Be careful of a vague limitation; it provides poor guidance for what you can
or can’t do, and it can demoralize people who have to deal with it. Here are
some examples:
 Schedule limitation:
• Vague: “Finish this project as soon as possible.” This statement
tells you nothing. With this limitation, your audience may suddenly
demand your project’s final results — with no advance warning.
• Specific: “Finish this project by close of business June 30.”
 Resource limitation:
• Vague: “You can have an analyst part-time in May.” How heavily
can you count on this analyst? From the analyst’s point of view,
how can she juggle all of her assignments in that period if she has
no idea how long each one will take?
When people aren’t specific about a constraint, you can’t be sure
whether you can honor their request. The longer people wait to be
specific, the less likely you can adhere to the limitation and suc-
cessfully complete your project.
• Specific: “You can have an analyst four hours per day for the first
two weeks in May.”
Looking for project limitations
Determining limitations is a fact-finding mission, so your job is to identify and
examine all possible sources of information. You don’t want to miss anything
and you want to clarify any conflicting information. After you know what
people expect, you can determine how (or whether) you can meet those
expectations. Try the following approaches:
 Consult your audiences. Check with drivers about limitations regarding
desired outcomes; check with supporters about limitations concerning
work approach and resources.
 Review relevant written materials. These materials may include long-
range plans, annual budgets and capital-appropriations plans, benefit-
cost analyses, feasibility studies, reports of related projects, minutes of
meetings, and individuals’ performance objectives.
 When you identify a limitation, be sure to note its source. Confirming a
limitation from different sources increases your confidence in its accu-
racy. Resolve conflicting opinions about a limitation as soon as possible.
42
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Addressing limitations in your plan
List all project limitations in your SOW. If you have to explore ways to modify
your project plan in the future, the list can help define alternatives that you
can and cannot consider.
You can reflect limitations in your project in two ways. First, you can incorpo-
rate them directly into your plan. For example, if a key driver says you have
to finish your project by September 30, you may choose to set September 30
as your project’s completion date. Of course, because September 30 is the
outside limit, you may choose to set a completion date of August 31. In this
case, the limitation influences your target but isn’t equivalent to it.
Second, you can identify any project risks that result from a limitation. For
example, if you feel the target completion date is unusually aggressive, the
risk of missing that date may be significant. You’ll want to develop plans to
minimize and manage that risk throughout your project. (See Chapter 8 for
more information on how to assess and plan for risks and uncertainties.)
Dealing with needs
As soon as possible, consider the situations or conditions necessary for your
project’s success. Most of these needs relate to project resources. The follow-
ing are examples:
 Personnel: “I need a technical editor for a total of 40 hours in August.”
 Budget: “I need a budget of $10,000 for computer peripherals.”
 Other resources: “I need access to the test laboratory during June.”
Be as clear as possible when describing your project’s needs. The more spe-
cific you are, the more likely other people will understand and meet those
needs.
Sometimes you can identify needs very early. More often, however, particular
needs surface as you create a plan that addresses the drivers’ expectations.
Your list of needs grows as you continue to plan your project.
Facing the Unknowns When Planning
As you proceed through your planning process, you can identify issues or
questions that may affect your project’s performance. Unfortunately, just
identifying these issues or questions doesn’t help you address them.
43
Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why

For every issue you identify, make assumptions regarding unknowns associ-
ated with it. Then use these assumptions as you plan your project. Consider
the following examples:
 Issue: How much money will you get to perform your project?
Approach: Assume you’ll get $50,000 for your project. Plan for your pro-
ject to spend up to, but no more than, $50,000. Develop detailed informa-
tion to demonstrate why your project budget must be $50,000 and share
that information with key decision makers.
 Issue: When will you get authorization to start work on your project?
Approach: Assume you’ll receive authorization to start work on August
1. Plan your project work so that no activities start before August 1.
Explain to key people why your project must start on August 1 and work
with them to facilitate your project’s approval by that date.
Consider all project assumptions when you develop your project’s risk man-
agement plan. See Chapter 8 for more info.

 Figuring out your project’s diverse audiences

 Determining who has authority in your project
O
ften a project is like an iceberg: Nine-tenths of it lurks below the surface.
You receive an assignment and you think you know what it entails and
who needs to be involved. Then, as the project unfolds, new people emerge —
one by one — people who will affect your goals and your approach to the
project.
You run two risks when you don’t involve key people or groups in your pro-
ject in a timely manner. First, you may miss important information that can
affect the project’s performance and ultimate success. Second, and some-
times more painful, you may insult someone. And you can be sure that, when
someone feels slighted or insulted, he’ll take steps to make sure you don’t do
it again!
As soon as you begin to think about your project, start to identify people who
may play a role. This chapter shows you how to identify these candidates;
how to decide whether, when, and how to involve them; and how to deter-
mine who has the authority to make critical decisions.
Understanding Your Project’s Audiences
A project audience is any person or group that supports, is affected by, or is
interested in your project. Your project audiences can be inside or outside
your organization. Knowing your project’s audiences helps you to

 Plan whether, when, and how to involve them.
 Determine whether the scope of the project is bigger or smaller than
you originally anticipated.
You may hear other terms used in the business world for project audiences,
but each term addresses only some of the people from your complete project
audience list. Here are some examples:
 A stakeholder list identifies people and groups who’ll support or be
affected by your project. The stakeholder list doesn’t usually include
people who are merely interested in your project.
 A distribution list identifies people who receive copies of written project
communications, and the lists are often out of date. Some people are on
the list simply because no one removes them; other people are on the
list because no one wants to run the risk of insulting them by removing
them. In either case, their name on this list doesn’t ensure that they
actually support, are affected by, or are interested in your project.
 Team members are people whom the project manager directs. All team
members are stakeholders and, as such, they’re part of the project audi-
ence, but the audience list includes more than just the team members.
As you identify the different audiences for your project, write them in an
audience list. Check out the next section for more information on how to pre-
pare this list.
Developing an Audience List
A project audience list is a living document. Start to develop your list as soon
as you begin to think about your project. Write down any names that occur to
you; when you discuss your project with other people, ask them who they
think may be affected or interested. Then select a small group of people and
conduct a formal brainstorming session. Continue to add and subtract names
until the list is complete. To increase your chances of identifying all appropri-
ate people, develop your audience list in categories. For example, you’re less
likely to overlook people if you consider them department by department or
group by group instead of trying to identify all of the people from the entire
organization at the same time.
Start your audience list by developing a hierarchical grouping of categories
that covers the universe of people who may be affected by, needed for their
support, or interested in your project. I often use the following list:
46
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Internal: People and groups inside your organization
Upper management: Executive-level management responsible for
the general oversight of all organization operations
Requester: The person who came up with the idea for your project
and all people through whom the request passed before you
received it
Project manager: The person with overall responsibility for suc-
cessfully completing the project
Team members: People whose work the project manager directs
Groups normally involved: Groups typically involved in most pro-
jects in the organization, such as human resources, finance, con-
tracts, and the legal department
Groups needed just for this project: Groups or people with special
knowledge related to this project
 External: People and groups outside your organization
Clients or customers: People or groups that buy or use your orga-
nization’s products and services
Collaborators: Groups or organizations with whom you may
pursue joint ventures related to your project
Vendors, suppliers, and contractors: Organizations that provide
human, physical, or financial resources to help you perform your
project’s work
Regulators: Government agencies that establish regulations and
guidelines that govern some aspect of your project work
47
Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
Categorize, categorize, categorize
A client of mine asked me to review an audi-
ence list he had prepared for a multiyear pro-
ject that would touch every aspect of his
organization. His list included more than 300
names, organized alphabetically, and he asked
me whether I thought anyone was missing. The
problem was that I had no way of knowing
whether anyone was missing. Because the list
had 300 uncategorized names, I had no idea
why the people were on the list or what areas
they represented.
If the names in the list were categorized by
department or group, I could have easily
checked to see whether the areas of the com-
pany that I thought should be involved were rep-
resented. I could also tell when one person
represented two or more different areas.
Unfortunately, the list’s format made it impossi-
ble to tell whether audiences had been over-
looked or whether people on the list really didn’t
belong there.

Professional societies: Groups of professionals that may influence
or be interested in your project
The public: The local, national, and international community of
people who may be affected by or interested in your project
Continue to develop your audience list by subdividing these categories fur-
ther until you arrive at position descriptions and the names of the people
who occupy them.
As you develop your audience list, be sure not to overlook the following
potential audiences:
 All support groups: These people don’t tell you what you should do;
instead, they help you accomplish the project’s goals. If support groups
know about your project early, they can fit you into their work schedules
more readily. They can also tell you information about their capabilities
and processes that may influence what your project can accomplish and
by when. Such groups include
• Facilities
• Finance
• Human resources
• Information services
• Legal services
• Procurement or contracting
• Quality
• Security
 End-users of your project’s products: In some cases, you may omit end-
users on your audience list because you don’t know who they are. In
other situations, you may think you have taken them into account
through liaisons — people who represent the interests of the end-users.
(Check out the nearby sidebar “Discovering the real end users” for a
costly example.)
 People who will maintain or support the final product: People who will
service your project’s products affect the continuing success of these
products. Involving these people throughout your project gives them a
chance to make your project’s products easier to maintain and support.
Their involvement also allows them to become familiar with the prod-
ucts and effectively build their maintenance into existing procedures.

Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
Dealing with reality rather than ignoring it
A number of years ago, I ran into a woman who
had attended one of my project-management
training sessions. Although she felt the session
had been very helpful and she had already put
several techniques into practice, she said the
audience list seemed to be useless.
She then explained what had happened. Her
boss had assigned her a project that she had to
finish in two months. She immediately devel-
oped an audience list, but, much to her horror,
the list included more than 150 names! How, she
wondered, was she supposed to involve more
than 150 people in a two-month project? She
concluded that the audience list was clearly
useless.
In fact, her audience list had fulfilled its purpose
perfectly. Apparently she initially felt that each
of the people on her list would affect the suc-
cess of her project. Identifying them at the start
of her project gave her three options:
 She could plan how and when to involve
each person during the project.
 She could assess the potential conse-
quences of not involving one or more of her
audiences.
 She could discuss extending the project
deadline or reducing its scope with her
boss if she felt she couldn’t ignore any of
the audiences.
The audience list itself doesn’t decide who you
should involve in your project. Instead, it speci-
fies the people to consider involving by weigh-
ing the benefits and the costs.
Discovering the real end-users
A major international bank had spent millions of
dollars revising and upgrading its information
system. The people in charge of the project had
worked closely with special liaisons in Europe
who represented the interests of the local bank
personnel — the people who would enter and
retrieve data from the system. When the system
became operable, they discovered a fatal prob-
lem: More than 90 percent of the local bank per-
sonnel in Europe were non-English speaking,
but the system documentation was in English.
The entire system was unusable!
The system designers had spent substantial time
and money working with the liaisons to identify
and address the interests and needs of the users.
However, the liaisons had identified issues from
their own experience instead of identifying and
sharing the needs and concerns of the local
bank personnel. Because English was the pri-
mary language of all the liaisons, the issue of lan-
guage never came up. Putting both the liaisons
and the local bank personnel on the audience list
would have reminded the project staff to con-
sider the concerns of the local bank personnel.

Suppose you’re asked to coordinate your organization’s annual blood drive.

Ensuring your audience list is 
complete and up-to-date
A wide range of people influences the success of your project. Knowing who
these people are allows you to plan to involve them at the appropriate times
during your project. Therefore, identifying all project audiences as soon as pos-
sible and reflecting any changes as soon as they occur are important steps.
50
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

To ensure your audience list is complete, consider the following guidelines:
 Eventually identify each audience by position description and name.
You may, for example, initially identify people from sales and marketing
as an audience. Eventually, however, you want to specify the particular
people from that group, such as brand manager for XYZ product, Sharon
Wilson.
 Speak with a wide range of people. Check with people in different orga-
nizational units, from different disciplines, and with different tenures in
the organization. Ask every person whether he can think of anyone else
that you should speak with. The more people you speak with, the less
likely you are to overlook someone important.
 Allow sufficient time to develop your audience list. Start to develop
your list as soon as you become project manager. The longer you think
about your project, the more potential audiences you can identify.
Throughout the project, continue to check with people about additional
audiences.
 Include audiences who may play a role at any time during your pro-
ject. Your only job at this stage is to identify names so you don’t forget
them. At a later point, you can decide whether, when, and how to
involve these people (see the “Identifying the Drivers, Supporters, and
Observers in Your Audience” section later in this chapter).
 Include team members’ functional managers. Include the people to
whom the project manager and team members directly report. Even
though functional managers don’t directly perform project tasks, they
can help ensure that the project manager and team members devote the
time they originally promised to the project.
 Include a person’s name on the audience list for every role she plays.
Suppose your boss will also provide expert technical advice to your pro-
ject team. Include your boss’s name twice — once as your direct super-
visor and once as the technical expert. If your boss is promoted but
continues to serve as a technical advisor to your project, the separate
listings remind you that a new person now occupies your direct supervi-
sor’s slot.
 Continue to add and remove names from your audience list through-
out your project. Your audience list evolves as you understand more
about your project and as your project changes. Encourage people
involved in your project to continually identify new candidates as they
think of them.
 When in doubt, write down a person’s name. Your goal is to avoid
overlooking someone who may play an important part in your project.
Identifying a potential audience doesn’t mean you have to involve that
person; it means that you must consider him. Eliminating the name of
someone who won’t be involved is a lot easier than trying to add a name
of someone who should be.

Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People

Making an audience list template
An audience list template is a predesigned audience list that contains typical
audiences for projects similar to yours. The template reflects the cumulative
experiences of a particular type of project. As you perform more projects,
you can add audiences to the template that you overlooked in earlier pro-
jects and remove audiences that proved unnecessary. Using templates can
save you time and improve your accuracy.
Suppose you prepare the budget for your department each quarter. After
doing a number of these budgets, you know most of the people who give you
the necessary information, who draft and print the document, and who have
to approve the final budget. Each time you finish another budget, you revise
your audience list template to include new information from that project. The
next time you prepare your quarterly budget, you begin your audience list
with that template. You then add and subtract names as appropriate for this
particular budget preparation.
When using audience list templates, keep the following in mind:
 Develop templates for frequently performed tasks and for entire pro-
jects. Templates for kicking off the annual blood drive or submitting a
newly developed drug to the Food and Drug Administration are valuable.
But so are templates for individual tasks that are part of these projects,
such as awarding a competitive contract or printing a document. Many
times projects that appear totally new contain some tasks that you’ve
done before. You can still reap the benefits of your prior experience by
including the audience list templates for these tasks into your overall
project audience list.
 Focus on position descriptions rather than the names of prior audi-
ences. Identify an audience as accounts payable manager rather than Bill
Miller. People come and go, but functions endure. For each specific pro-
ject, you can fill in the appropriate names.
 Develop and modify your audience list template from previous pro-
jects that actually worked, not from plans that looked good. Often you
develop a detailed audience list at the start of your project but don’t
revise the list during the project or add audiences that you overlooked
in your initial planning. If you only update your template with informa-
tion from an initial list, your template can’t reflect the discoveries you
made throughout the project.
 Use templates as starting points, not ending points. Make clear to your
team that the template isn’t the final list. Every project differs in some
ways from similar ones. If you don’t critically examine the template, you
may miss people who weren’t involved in previous projects but whom
you need to consider for this one.
52
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Continually update your templates to reflect the experiences from dif-
ferent projects. The postproject evaluation (see Chapter 15) is an excel-
lent time to review and critique your original audience list, so take a
moment to be sure your template reflects your experience.
Templates can save time and improve accuracy. However, starting with a tem-
plate that’s too polished can suggest you’ve made up your mind about its
contents, which may discourage people from sharing their thoughts freely
about the list. Their lack of involvement may lead to their lack of commit-
ment to the project’s success.
Identifying the Drivers, Supporters, and
Observers in Your Audience
After identifying everyone in your project audience, determine which of the
following groups they fall into. Then you can decide whether to involve them
and, if so, how and when.
 Drivers: People who have some say in defining the results of your pro-
ject. You’re performing your project for these people.
 Supporters: The people who help you perform your project. Supporters
include individuals who authorize the resources for your project and
who actually work on it.
 Observers: People who are interested in the activities and results of
your project. Observers have no say in your project and they’re not
actively involved in it. However, your project may affect them at some
point in the future.
Categorizing audiences in this way helps you decide what information to seek
from and share with each one and helps them clarify which project decisions
to be involved in.
Consider that an information technology group has the job of modifying the
layout and content of a monthly sales report for all sales representatives. The
vice president of sales requested the project, and the chief information offi-
cer (CIO — the boss of the head of the information technology group)
approved it. If you were the project manager for this project, you may con-
sider categorizing your project’s audiences as follows:
 Drivers: The vice president of sales is a driver because he has specific
reasons for revising the report. The CIO is a potential driver because she
may hope to develop certain new capabilities for her group through this
project. Individual sales representatives are all drivers for this project
because they’ll use the redesigned report to support their work.
53
Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People

 Supporters: The systems analyst who designs the revised report, the
training specialist who trains the users, and the vice president of finance
who authorizes the funds for printing the changes in the manual are all
supporters.
 Observers: The head of the customer service department is a potential
observer because he hopes your project will improve the chances for an
improved problem-tracking system this year.
Beware of supporters who try to act like drivers. In the previous example, the
analyst that finalizes the content and format of the report may try to include
certain items that she thinks are helpful. However, only the drivers should
determine the specific data that go into the report. The analyst just deter-
mines whether it’s possible to include the desired data and what it will cost.
Keep in mind that one person can be both a driver and a supporter. The vice
president of sales is a driver for the project to develop a revised monthly
sales report. But this same person is also a supporter if he has to transfer
funds from the sales department budget to pay for developing the report.
This section helps you identify when you need to involve drivers, supporters,
and observers, and the best ways to keep them involved.
Deciding when to involve them
Projects pass through the following five stages as they progress from an ini-
tial idea to completion (see Chapter 1 for detailed explanations of these
phases):
 Conceive
 Define
 Start
 Perform
 Close
Plan to involve drivers, supporters, and observers in each phase.
Drivers
Involve drivers from the start to the finish of your project. Keeping them
involved is critical because they define what your project should produce,
and they evaluate your project’s success when it’s finished. Check out Table
3-2 to see how to keep drivers involved during the five phases.

that the members can successfully com-
plete the project.

Include a project champion
A project champion is a person in a high posi-
tion in the organization who strongly supports
your project; advocates for your project in dis-
putes, planning meetings, and review sessions;
and takes whatever actions are necessary to
help ensure the successful completion of your
project.
As soon as you start planning, find out whether
your project has a champion. If it doesn’t, try to
recruit one. An effective champion has the fol-
lowing characteristics:
 Sufficient power and authority to resolve
conflicts over resources, schedules, and
technical issues
 A keen interest in the results of your project
 A willingness to have his or her name cited
as a strong supporter of your project.

Have drivers assess the project’s results
and determine whether their needs and

Supporters
Just as with drivers, involve supporters from start to finish. Because they
perform and support the project work, they need to know about changing
requirements so they can promptly identify and address problems.
Involvement also sustains their ongoing motivation and commitment to the
project. Check out Table 3-3 to see how to keep supporters involved during
the five phases.

57
Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People

stimulate a group’s continued interest and encourage them to actively sup-
port your work. Consider the following approaches for keeping your project
audiences involved throughout your project:
 One-on-one meetings: One-on-one meetings (formal or informal discus-
sions with one or two other people about project issues) are particularly
useful for interactively exploring and clarifying special issues of interest
to a small number of people.
 Group meetings: These are planned sessions for some or all team mem-
bers or audiences. Smaller meetings are useful to brainstorm project
issues, reinforce team-member roles, and develop mutual trust and
respect among team members. Larger meetings are useful to present
information of general interest.
 Informal written correspondence: Informal written correspondence
(notes, memos, letters, and e-mail) helps you document informal discus-
sions and share important project information.
 Written approvals: Written approvals (such as a technical approach to
project work or formal agreements about a product, schedule, or
resource commitment) serve as a record of project decisions and
achievements.
To maximize your audiences’ contributions, consider the following guidelines
throughout your project:
 Involve an audience early in planning if they have a role later on.
Give your audience the option to participate in planning even if they
don’t perform until later in the project. Sometimes they can share infor-
mation that’ll make their tasks easier. At the least, they can reserve time
to provide their services when you need them.
 If you’re concerned with the legality of involving a specific audience,
check with your legal department or contracts office. Suppose you’re
planning to award a competitive contract to buy certain equipment. You
want to know whether prospective bidders typically have this equip-
ment on hand and how long it’ll take to receive it after you award the
contract. However, you’re concerned that speaking to potential contrac-
tors in the planning stage may tip them off about the procurement and
lead to charges of favoritism by unsuccessful bidders who didn’t know
about the procurement in advance. Instead of ignoring this important
audience, check with your contracts office or legal department to deter-
mine how you can get the information you want and still maintain the
integrity of the bidding process.
 Develop a plan with each key audience to meet their information
needs and interests as well as yours. Determine the information they
want and the information you believe they need. Also decide when to
provide that information and in what format. Finally, clarify what you
want from them and how and when they can provide it.
58
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Always be sure you understand each audience’s What’s In It For Me
(WIIFM). Clarify why it’s in each audience’s interest to see your project
succeed. Throughout your project, keep reminding them of the benefits
they’ll realize when your project’s complete and the progress your pro-
ject’s made towards achieving those benefits. See more about identifying
project benefits for different audiences in Chapter 14.
Getting People with Sufficient Authority
Authority is the right to make project decisions that others must follow.
Having opinions about how an aspect should be addressed is different from
having the authority to decide how it will be addressed. Mistaking a person’s
level of authority can lead to frustration as well as wasted time and money.
Confirm that the people you’ve identified as audiences can make the neces-
sary decisions to perform their tasks. If they don’t have that authority, find
out who does and how to bring those people into the process. (Check out the
nearby sidebar “Avoid a headache — involve the people who really have the
authority” for an example.)
59
Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
Avoid a headache — involve the people who
really have the authority
A client of mine attended a meeting to choose
the color of his group’s new offices. All of the
people working on the project to renovate and
upgrade his group’s offices were present. After
intense discussions, they agreed the walls
should be light gray.
One week later, the team member from the facil-
ities department informed the rest of the team
that his boss had decided that color was too
expensive and that they’d have to choose
another one. The entire meeting a week earlier
had been a complete waste of time. They had
assumed that every member of the group had
the necessary authority to support the group’s
decision. If they had they known that the facili-
ties department rep didn’t have this authority,
they could have
 Asked the representative from the facilities
department to find out the criteria for the
color
 Developed and prioritized two or more
alternatives and asked the rep to present
them to his boss for final approval
 Invited the person who did have the authority
 Postponed the meeting until the right
people could attend

In your own projects, take the following steps to define each audience
member’s authority:
1. Clarify each person’s tasks and decisions.
Define with each person his tasks and his role in those tasks. Will he
only work on the task, or will he also approve the schedules, resource
expenditures, and work approaches?
2. Ask each person her authority regarding each decision and task.
Ask about individual tasks rather than all issues in a particular area. For
example, a person can be more confident about her authority to
approve supply purchases up to $5,000 than about her authority to
approve all equipment purchases, no matter the type or amount.
Clarify decisions that the person can make herself. For decisions need-
ing someone else’s approval, find out whose approval she needs. (Ask,
never assume!)
3. Ask people how they know what authority they have.
Does a written policy, procedure, or guideline confirm the authority? Did
the person’s boss tell him in conversation? Is the person just assuming?
If the person has no specific confirming information, encourage him to
check with the above sources to get it.
4. Check the history.
Have you or other people worked with this person in the past? Has he
been overruled on decisions that he said he was authorized to make? If
so, ask him why he believes he won’t be similarly overruled this time.
5. Verify whether anything has recently changed.
Is there any reason to believe that this person’s authority has changed?
Is the person new to his current group? To his current position? Has the
person recently started working for a new boss? If any of these situa-
tions is true, encourage the person to find specific documentation to
confirm his authority for his benefit as well as yours.
Reconfirm the information in these steps when the audience’s decision-
making assignments change. Suppose, for example, that you initially expect
all individual purchases on your project to be at or under $2,500. Bill, the
team representative from the finance group, assures you that he has the
authority to approve such purchases for your project without checking with
his boss. Midway through the project, you find that you have to purchase a
piece of equipment for $5,000. Be sure to verify with Bill that he can person-
ally authorize this larger expenditure. If he can’t, find out whose approval you
need and plan how to get it.

T
he keys to successful project planning and performance are complete-
ness and continuity. You want to identify all important information in
your project plan, and you want to address all aspects of your plan during
project performance.
Your description of project work provides the basis for: scheduling and
resource planning, defining roles and responsibilities, assigning work to team
members, capturing key project performance data, and reporting on com-
pleted project work. This chapter gets you on the right track.
Dividing and Conquering: Working on
Your Project in Manageable Chunks
One of my major concerns when I start a new project is remembering to plan
for all important pieces of work. Another concern is accurately estimating
required time and resources. To address both issues, I develop a logical
framework to define all work that is necessary to complete the project.

I have a friend who loves jigsaw puzzles. A while back, he told me about an
acquaintance who had asked him to assemble a 5,000-piece puzzle of the
United States. When his acquaintance suggested that he should determine
whether any pieces were missing, my friend laughed. He had always deter-
mined whether a piece was missing by assembling the puzzle and then noting
whether the picture had any holes. How else could he do it?
You’ve probably had the same experience with your project assignments.
Suppose you’re asked to design and present a training program. You and a
colleague work intensely for a couple of months developing the content and
materials, arranging for the facilities, and inviting the participants. A week
before the session, you ask your colleague whether he’s made arrangements
to print the training manuals. He says he hadn’t thought about it, and you say
you hadn’t either because you thought he was dealing with the final details.
Unfortunately, both of you overlooked printing the manuals because you
both thought the other person was handling it. Now you have a training ses-
sion in a week but neither time nor money to print the needed materials. It’s
crisis time.
How can you avoid this situation? By using an organized approach in the
planning stage to identify all necessary work. This section explains how to
identify all required project work by breaking down activities into smaller
pieces of work.
Thinking in detail
The most important guideline when identifying and describing project work
is: Think in detail! I find that people consistently underestimate the time and
resources they need because they just don’t recognize everything they have
to do to complete their tasks.
Suppose you have to write a report of your team’s most recent meeting. Your
first task is to estimate the necessary time and resources to prepare this
report. Because you’ve written many, you figure it’ll take a few days. But how
confident are you in this estimate? Are you sure you’ve considered all the
activities the report will entail?
The key to describing your work is decomposition, breaking down a piece of
work into its component parts. Preparing the report actually entails three
separate activities: writing a draft, reviewing the draft, and preparing the final
report. Preparing the final report, in turn, involves two separate activities:
writing the final report and printing the final report.
62
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Follow two guidelines to decompose an activity correctly:
 No gaps: Identify all work in the subelements. In the example of writing a
report, no gaps means the three subelements encompass all the work
that goes into writing the report. If you feel there’s more work, define
another subelement to include it.
 No overlaps: Don’t include the same work in more than one of your
subelements. For example, don’t say that writing the draft involves
having people review preliminary versions if all reviews are under
reviewing the draft.
Detailing your work in this way increases your confidence that you haven’t
overlooked anything important and lets you develop more accurate esti-
mates of the necessary time and resources.
Thinking of hierarchy
Thinking in detail is critical but you also need to consider the big picture. If
you fail to identify a major part of your project’s work, you won’t have the
chance to detail it! You must be comprehensive and specific.
My friend’s jigsaw puzzle dilemma (refer to the previous section) suggests an
approach that can help you achieve your goal. He can count the pieces before
assembling the puzzle to determine whether any piece is missing. However,
knowing that he only has 4,999 pieces can’t help him determine which piece is
missing. He needs to divide the 5,000 pieces into smaller groups that he can
examine and understand. Suppose he divides the puzzle of the United States
into 50 separate puzzles, one for each of the 50 states, each comprising 100
pieces. Because he knows the United States has 50 states, he’s confident that
each piece of the puzzle can be in one and only one box. 
Suppose he takes it a step further and divides each state into northeast,
northwest, southeast, and southwest sections, each containing 25 pieces. He
can then count the pieces in each box to see whether any are missing.
Determining which one of 25 pieces is missing from the northeast sector of
New Jersey is a lot easier than figuring out which piece is missing from the
5,000-piece puzzle of the entire United States.
Figure 4-1 shows a Work Breakdown Structure, which uses the approach of
dividing an item into its component parts to describe the details of a project.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is an organized, hierarchical representa-
tion of all work — broken out in sufficient detail — to support a project’s
planning, assignment of roles and responsibilities, and ongoing monitoring
and control.
63
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

The different WBS levels have had many different names. The very top ele-
ment is typically a project and the lowest level of detail is typically a work
package. However, the levels in between have been called phases, subprojects,
work assignments, tasks, subtasks, deliverables, and subdeliverables. In this
book, the top-level box is a project, the lowest level of detail is a work pack-
age, and all other levels are Level 1, Level 2 and so forth.
Consider that you’re planning to develop and present a new training program
for your organization. Develop your WBS as follows.
1. Determine the major pieces of work.
Ask yourself, “What major pieces of work does this project entail?”
Identify the following pieces:
• Determine the needs
• Design the program
• Develop the materials
• Test the program
• Present the program
2. Divide each of these major pieces into its component parts in the same
manner.
Choose any piece to begin. Suppose you choose Determine the needs.
Ask, “What major pieces of work are necessary to complete this portion
of the project?”
Determine that you have to
• Identify people who have an interest in the program.
• Interview some of these people.
• Review written materials that discuss needs for the program.
• Prepare a report of the needs this program will address.
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3

3. Divide each of these work pieces into its component parts.
Suppose you choose to start with Interview some of these people.
Ask, “What major pieces of work have to be done to complete this por-
tion of the project?”
Decide that you have to
• Select the people you want to interview.
• Prepare the questions to ask.
• Schedule the interviews.
• Conduct the interviews.
• Write up the results of the interviews.
But why stop here? You can break each of these five pieces of work into
finer detail and then break those pieces into finer detail. How far should
you go? The following sections can help.
Asking three key questions
Determining how much detail you need isn’t a trivial task. Experienced pro-
ject managers often have difficulty deciding when to say when. A client told
me of a situation she had experienced with overdetailing. Her boss had asked
her to plan out her work for the next 12 months by breaking down her pro-
posed activities into 20-minute intervals! She was a strong supporter of pro-
ject management but she wondered, “Isn’t this going a bit too far?”
You want to describe your work in sufficient detail to support accurate plan-
ning and meaningful tracking. But the benefits of these details must justify
the additional time you spend developing and maintaining your plans and
reporting your progress. The following three questions can help you decide
whether an activity has sufficient details.
 Can you accurately estimate the resources you’ll need? (Resources
include personnel, equipment, raw materials, money, facilities, informa-
tion, and so on.)
 Can you accurately estimate how long the activity will take?
 If you have to assign the activity to someone else, are you confident that
he’ll understand exactly what to do?
If your answer to any one of these questions is No, break down the work into
finer detail. Your answers to these questions depend on: how familiar you are
with the work, how critical the activity is to the success of your project, what
happens if something goes wrong, who you may assign to perform the activ-
ity, how well you know that person, and so on. In other words, the correct
level of detail for your WBS depends upon your judgment.
65
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

If you’re a little uneasy about answering these three questions, try this even
simpler test: Break your activity into more detail when you feel either of the
following applies:
 It’ll take significantly longer than two calendar weeks to complete
 It’ll require significantly more than 80 person-hours to complete.
Remember, these are just guidelines. Suppose you estimate calendar time of two
weeks and two days to prepare a report — that’s sufficient detail. But what if
you figure two to three months to finalize requirements for your new product?
Then you need to break your project into more detail because you may have so
many activities in that period that you can’t confidently plan your time, your
resource estimates, or your ability to assign the task to someone else.
Making assumptions to clarify planned work
Sometimes the work isn’t defined in sufficient detail, but certain unknowns
stop you from defining it further. How do you resolve this dilemma? Make
assumptions regarding the unknowns! If your assumptions prove to be incor-
rect in time, you can change your plan to reflect the correct information.
For example, suppose you decide that Conduct the interviews from Step 3 ear-
lier in this section needs more detail so you can estimate its required time
and resources. However, you don’t know how to detail it further because you
don’t know how many people you’ll interview or how many separate sets of
interviews you need to conduct. If you assume you’ll interview five groups of
seven people each, you can then develop specific plans for arranging and
conducting each of these sessions. In most situations, consider a guess in the
middle of the possible range. You may also analyze several different assump-
tions to determine how sensitive your results are to the different values.
Be sure to write your assumptions down so you remember to change your
plan if you conduct more or less than five sessions. See the discussion in
Chapter 2 for more information about detailing assumptions.
Using action verbs at the lowest levels of detail
To clarify the nature of the work, use action verbs at the lowest levels of
detail. Action verbs can improve: your time and resource estimates, your
work assignments to team members, and your tracking and reporting
because they provide a clear picture of an activity.
Consider the assignment to prepare a report. Suppose you choose to break
this project into three work assignments: draft, reviews, and final. If that’s all
you provide, you haven’t stated clearly whether draft includes any or all of
the following activities:
66
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Collect information for the draft
 Determine length and format expectations and restrictions
 Handwrite the draft
 Review the draft
But, if you simply word the activity as Design and handwrite the draft — voilà!
Your scope of work is instantly clearer. A few well-chosen words at this level
go a long way.
Using a Work Breakdown Structure for large and small projects
You develop a WBS for very large projects, very small projects, and everything
in between. Building a skyscraper, designing a new airplane, researching and
developing a new drug, and revamping your organization’s information sys-
tems all need a WBS. So, too, do writing a report, scheduling and conducting a
meeting, coordinating your organization’s annual blood drive, and moving into
your new office. The size of the WBS may vary immensely depending on the
project, but the hierarchical scheme to develop each one is the same.
Occasionally your detailed WBS may seem to make your project more com-
plex than it really is. I agree that 100 tasks (not to mention 10,000) written out
can be a little unnerving! The truth is, though, the project’s complexity was
there all the time; the WBS just displays it. In fact, by clearly portraying all
aspects of the work, the structure actually simplifies your project.
Check out the sidebar “Conducting a survey: Utilizing the Work Breakdown
Structure” in this chapter for an illustration of how a WBS helps you develop
a more accurate estimate of the time you need to complete your work.
Dealing with special situations
With a little bit of thought, you can break most work into detailed compo-
nents. However, this section looks a little more closely at several special situ-
ations that require some creativity.
Representing a conditionally repeating activity
Suppose you plan an activity that requires an unknown number of repetitive
cycles, such as obtaining approval of a report. In reality, you write a draft and
submit it for review and approval. If the reviewers approve the draft, you pro-
ceed to the next activity (such as preparing the final version). But, if the
reviewers don’t approve the draft, you have to revise it to incorporate their
comments and then resubmit it for a second review and approval. If they
approve the second draft, you proceed to the final version. But if they still
don’t approve that draft, you have to repeat the process (or try to catch
them in a better mood).

Conducting a survey: Utilizing the Work
Breakdown Structure
Suppose your boss asks you to estimate how
long it’ll take to survey people regarding char-
acteristics of a new product that your company
may develop. Based on initial thoughts, you
figure you need to contact people at your head-
quarters, at two regional activity centers, and
from a sampling of your current clients. You tell
your boss, “Between one and six months.”
Have you ever noticed that bosses aren’t happy
when you respond to their question of “How
long?” with an answer of “Between one and six
months”? You figure that finishing anytime
before six months meets your promise, but your
boss expects you can be done in a month, given
some (okay, a lot of) hard work. The truth is,
though, you don’t have a clue how long the
survey will take because you don’t have a clue
how much work you have to do.
Developing a WBS encourages you to define
exactly what you’ll do and, correspondingly,
how long it’ll take. In this example, you decide
to conduct three different surveys: personal
interviews with people at your headquarters,
phone conference calls with people at the two
regional activity centers, and a mail survey of a
sample of clients. Realizing you need to
describe each survey in more detail, you begin
by considering the mail survey and realize it
includes five activities:
 Select a sample of clients to survey: You
figure it should take one week to select your
sample of clients if the sales department
has a current listing of all company clients.
You check with them and they do.
 Design and print a survey questionnaire:
You get lucky. A colleague tells you she
thinks the company conducted a similar
survey of a different target population a
year ago and that extra questionnaires may
still be around. You find that a local ware-
house has 1,000 of these questionnaires
and —yes! — they’re perfect for your
survey. How much time do you need to
allow for designing and printing the ques-
tionnaires? Zero!
 Send out the survey and receive the
returns: You determine you’ll need a
response rate of at least 70 percent for the
results to be valid. You consult with people
who’ve done these surveys before and find
out that a minimum response rate of 70 per-
cent needs a three-phased approach: First,
mail out a set of questionnaires and collect
responses for four weeks. Second, mail out
another set of the same questionnaires to
the nonrespondents and wait another four
weeks. Finally, conduct phone follow-ups
for two more weeks with the people who
still haven’t responded.
 Enter and analyze the data: You figure you
need about two weeks to enter and analyze
the data you expect to receive.
 Prepare the final report: You estimate two
weeks to prepare the final report.
Now, instead of one to six months, your esti-
mated time to complete your mail survey is 15
weeks. Because you’ve clarified the work and
how you’ll do it, you’re more confident in your
number and you’ve increased the chances that
you’ll achieve it!

Revising the draft is a conditional activity; it only occurs if a certain condition
(in the report example, not receiving everyone’s approval) comes to pass.
Unfortunately, a WBS doesn’t include conditional activities — you plan to
perform every activity that you detail. So you can represent conditional activ-
ities in two ways.
 You can define a single activity as Review/revise report and assign
one duration to that activity. You’re saying, in effect, that you can per-
form as many reviews and revisions as possible within the established
time period.
 You can assume that you’ll need a certain number of revisions and
include each of these reviews and revisions as separate activities in
your WBS. This approach defines a separate milestone at the end of
each review and revision, which also allows more meaningful tracking.
Assuming that your project needs three reviews and two revisions doesn’t
guarantee that your draft will be good to go after the third review. If your
draft is approved after the first review, congratulations! You’ve bought some
time in the schedule and can move on to the next activity immediately (that
is, you don’t perform two revisions just because the plan says so!).
However, if you still haven’t received approval after the third review, you con-
tinue to revise it and submit it for further review until you do get that seal of
approval. Of course, then you have to reexamine your plan to determine the
impact of the additional reviews and revisions on the schedule and budget of
future activities.
A plan isn’t a guarantee of the future; it’s your statement of what you’ll work
to achieve. If you’re unable to accomplish any part of your plan, you must
revise it accordingly (and promptly).
Handling an activity with no obvious break points
Sometimes you can’t see how to break down an activity into two-week inter-
vals. And sometimes that detail just doesn’t seem necessary. Even in these
situations, divide the activity into smaller chunks to remind yourself to peri-
odically verify that schedule and resource estimates are still valid.
No matter how carefully you plan, something unanticipated can always occur.
The sooner you find out about such an occurrence, the more time you have
to minimize any negative impact on your project.
69
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

Planning a long-term project
A long-term project presents a different challenge. Often the activities you
perform a year or more in the future depend on the results of the work you
do between now and then. Even if you can accurately predict the activities
you’ll perform later, the farther into the future you plan, the more likely
something will change and require you to modify your plans.
When developing a WBS for a long-term project, use a rolling-wave approach,
which continually refines your plans throughout the life of your project as
you understand the project and its environment better. The rolling-wave
approach acknowledges that uncertainties may limit your plan’s initial detail
and accuracy, and it encourages you to reflect more accurate information in
your plans as soon as you discover it. Take the following steps in a rolling-
wave approach:
70
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 
Keeping a closer eye on your project
A number of years back, I met a young engineer
at one of my training sessions. Soon after he
joined his organization, he received an assign-
ment to design and build a piece of equipment
for a client. When he asked his procurement
office to order the raw materials he needed, he
was told that the material would arrive in six
months. He was to notify the procurement office
if he hadn’t received the raw materials by the
promised date. Being young, inexperienced,
and new to the organization, he wasn’t com-
fortable trying to fight this established proce-
dure. So he waited for six months.
When he hadn’t received his raw materials after
six months, he notified the procurement office.
The procurement specialist discovered that
there had been a fire in the vendor’s facilities
five months earlier that had caused all produc-
tion to stop. Production had just resumed the
previous week, and the vendor estimated his
materials would be shipped in about five
months!
The young engineer’s Work Breakdown
Structure had identified one activity, Buy raw
materials, with a duration of six months. He rea-
soned that, after placing the order, nothing else
was to happen until five and one-half months
later, when he would start to work on his design
and the final materials would arrive two weeks
later. How was he to break this activity down
further?
I suggested he could have divided the waiting
time into one-month intervals and called the
vendor at the end of each month to see whether
anything could change the projected delivery
date. Although checking wouldn’t have pre-
vented the fire, he would have known about it
five months sooner and could have made other
plans immediately.

1. Break down the first three months’ activities into components that
take two weeks or less to complete.
2. Plan the remainder of the project in less detail, perhaps describing
the work in packages you estimate to take between one and two
months.
3. Revise your initial plan at the end of the first three months to detail
your activities for the next three months in components that take two
weeks or less to complete.
4. Modify any future activities as necessary, based on the results of your
first three months’ work.
5. Continue revising your plan in this way throughout the project.
Creating and Displaying Your
Work Breakdown Structure
You can use several different schemes to develop and display your project’s
WBS, and each one can be effective under different circumstances. This sec-
tion looks at a few of those different schemes and provides some examples
and advice on their application.
Considering different hierarchal schemes
for classifying activities
You can use many different schemes to subdivide a project and its activities.
The following are four of the most common schemes and examples of each:
 Product components: Floor plan, training manuals, screen design, or
promotional literature
 Functions: Design, launch, review, or test
 Geographical areas: Region 1 or the northwest
 Organizational units: Marketing, operations, or facilities
Product component and function are the most common schemes.
71
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

When you choose the scheme you want to use, stick with that scheme to pre-
vent possible overlap in categories.
For example, consider that you want to develop finer detail for the activity
Prepare report. You may choose to break out the detail according to function,
such as write the draft report, review the draft report, and write the final report.
Or, you may choose to break it out by product component, such as Section 1,
Section 2, and Section 3.
However, don’t try to break out details by using some elements from both
schemes, such as Section 1, Section 2, review the draft report, and write the
final report. This breakout creates confusion. For example, the activity
Prepare the final version of Section 2 could be included in either of two cate-
gories: Section 2 or Write the final report.
Consider the following questions when choosing a detail scheme:
 What higher-level milestones will be most meaningful when reporting
progress? For example, is it more helpful to report that Section 1 is com-
pleted or that the entire draft of the report is done?
 How will responsibility be assigned? For example, is one person respon-
sible for drafting, reviewing, and finalizing Section 1, or is one person
responsible for all drafts of Sections 1, 2, and 3?
 How will the work actually be done? For example, is drafting, reviewing,
and finalizing of Section 1 separate from the same activities for Section
2, or are all chapters drafted together, reviewed together, and finalized
together?
Developing your WBS
How you develop your WBS depends on how familiar you and your team are
with your project, whether similar projects have been successful in the past,
and how many new methods and approaches you’ll use. Choose one of the
following two approaches depending on your project’s characteristics:
 Top-down: Start at the top level in the hierarchy and systematically
break down activities into their component parts.
This approach is very useful when people have a good idea of the work
beforehand. It ensures that you thoroughly consider each category at
each level, and it reduces the chances that you overlook activities in
those categories.
72
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Brainstorming: Generate all possible activities for this project and then
group them into categories.
Brainstorming is very helpful when people don’t have a clear sense at the
outset of a project’s required activities. This approach encourages
people to generate any and all possible activities that may have to be
done, without worrying about how to organize them in the final WBS.
After you decide that a proposed piece of work is a necessary part of the
project, you can identify related activities that are also required.
In either case, consider using stickums to support your work. As you identify
activities, write them on the notes and put them on the wall. Add, remove, and
regroup the notes as you continue to think through your work. This approach
encourages open sharing of ideas and helps all people appreciate — in detail —
the nature of the work that needs to be done.
Top-down approach
Use the top-down approach for projects that you or others are familiar with.
Proceed as follows:
1. Specify all work assignments for the entire project.
2. Determine all necessary tasks for each work assignment.
3. Specify the subtasks for each task as necessary.
4. Continue in this way until you’ve detailed your entire project.
Brainstorming approach
Use the following brainstorming approach for projects involving untested
methods or for projects you and your team members haven’t done before.
1. Write all activities that you think are necessary for your project.
Don’t worry about overlap or level of detail.
Don’t discuss activity wording or other details.
Don’t make any judgments about the appropriateness of the activity.
2. Group the activities into a few major categories with common charac-
teristics and eliminate any activities you don’t have to perform.
These groupings are your level 1 categories.
3. Next divide the activities under each level 1 category into groups with
common characteristics.
These groups are your level 2 categories.
73
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

4. Now use the top-down method to identify any additional activities that
you overlooked in the categories that you created.
5. Continue in this manner until you have described all project work
clearly and completely.
Taking different paths to the same end
Early in the development of your WBS, you can look at two or more different
hierarchical schemes to describe your project. Considering your project from
two or more perspectives helps you identify activities you may have over-
looked.
Suppose a local community wants to open a halfway house for substance
abusers. Figures 4-2 and 4-3 depict two different schemes to categorize the
work for this community-based treatment facility. The first scheme classifies
the work at the highest level by product component, and the second classi-
fies the work by function.
Figure 4-2 defines the following project components as level 1 categories: staff,
facility, residents (people who’ll be living at the facility and receiving ser-
vices), and community training.
Figure 4-3 defines the functions as level 1 categories: planning, recruiting,
buying, and training.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

The same lowest-level activities are in both WBSs.
When you think about your project in terms of major functions (rather than
project components), you realize that you forgot the following activities:
 You have no planning activity for hiring of staff.
 You have no activity to buy staff supplies.
 You forgot an activity to plan your community training.
After you identify the activities you overlooked, you can represent them in
either of the two WBSs.
Be sure you choose only one WBS before you leave your planning phase.
Nothing confuses people faster than trying to use two or more different WBSs
to describe the same project.
Labeling your WBS entries
As the size of a project grows, its WBS becomes increasingly complex. It’s
often easy to lose sight of how a particular piece of work relates to other
parts of the project. This problem can lead to poor coordination between
related activities and lack of urgency on the part of people who must com-
plete an activity.
Figure 4-4 illustrates a scheme for labeling your WBS entries so you can easily
see their relationships with each other and their relative positions in the
overall project.

 The first number refers to a level 1 category.
 The number after the first period refers to a level 2 category under that
level 1 category.
 The number after the second period refers to a level 3 category under
that level 2 category.

level 3 category.
Displaying your WBS in different formats
You can use several different formats to display your WBS. This section looks
at three of the most common.
The organization-chart format
Figure 4-5 shows a WBS in an organization-chart format. This format effec-
tively portrays an overview of your project and the hierarchical relationships
of different categories at the highest levels. However, because this format
generally requires a lot of space, it’s less effective for displaying large num-
bers of activities.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

The indented-outline format
The indented-outline format in Figure 4-6 is another way to display your WBS.
This format allows you to read and understand a complex WBS with many
activities. However, you can easily get lost in the details of a large project
with this format and forget how the different pieces all fit together.
Both formats can display a WBS for a small project. For a large project, how-
ever, consider using a combination of the organization-chart and the
indented-outline formats to explain your WBS. You can display the level 1 and
level 2 categories in the organization-chart format and portray the detailed
breakout for every level 2 category in the indented-outline format.
The bubble-chart format
The bubble-chart format in Figure 4-7 is particularly effective for supporting
the brainstorming process for both small and large projects. You interpret the
bubble chart as follows:
 The bubble in the center represents your entire project.
 Lines from the center bubble lead to level 1 breakouts.
 Lines from each level 1 breakout lead to level 2 breakouts related to that
level 1 breakout.

Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

The freeform nature of the bubble chart makes it effective for easily record-
ing thoughts generated in a brainstorming process. You can also easily
rearrange activities as you proceed with your analysis.
The bubble chart isn’t effective for displaying your WBS to audiences who
aren’t familiar with your project. Use the bubble chart to develop your WBS
with your team but transpose it into an organization-chart or indented-outline
format when you present it to people outside your team.
Improving the quality of your WBS
You increase the chances for project success when your WBS is accurate and
complete and when people who will be performing the work understand and
agree with it. The following tips suggest some ways to improve a WBS’s accu-
racy and acceptance.
 Involve the people who’ll be doing the work. When possible, involve
them during the initial development of the WBS. If they join the project
after the initial planning, have them review and critique the WBS before
they begin work.
 Review and include information from WBSs from similar projects.
Review plans and consult people who’ve worked on projects similar to
yours that were successful. Incorporate your findings into your WBS.
 Keep your WBS current. When you add, delete, or change activities
during your project, be sure to reflect these changes in your WBS. (See
“Gathering What You Need to Know about Your Activities” later in this
chapter for more about sharing the updated structure with the team.)
 Make assumptions regarding uncertain activities. If you aren’t certain
whether you’ll do a particular activity, make an assumption and prepare
your WBS based on that assumption. Be sure to document that assump-
tion. If your assumption proves to be wrong during the project, change
your plan to reflect the true situation. (See the sections “Making assump-
tions to clarify planned work” and “Representing a conditionally repeat-
ing activity” earlier in this chapter for more about assumptions.)
 Remember that your WBS only identifies the elements of activities; it
doesn’t depict their chronological order. Nothing is wrong with includ-
ing activities from left to right or top to bottom in the approximate order
that you’ll perform them. However, you may have difficulty showing
detailed interrelationships among activities in complex projects in the
WBS format. The purpose of the WBS is to ensure that you identify all
activities. Check out Chapter 5 for more on developing the schedule for
your project’s activities.
78
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

Using templates
A WBS template is an existing WBS that contains activities typical for a partic-
ular type of project. This template reflects people’s cumulative experience
from performing many projects of the same type. As people perform more
projects, they add activities to the template that were overlooked and
remove activities that weren’t needed. Using templates can save you time
and improve your accuracy.
Although templates can save time and improve accuracy, don’t inhibit
people’s active involvement in the development of the WBS by using a tem-
plate that’s too polished. Lack of people’s involvement can lead to missed
activities and lack of commitment to project success.
This section looks at how you can develop a WBS template and improve its
accuracy and completeness.
Drawing upon previous experience
Suppose you prepare your department’s quarterly budget. After doing a
number of these budgets, you know most of the activities you have to per-
form. Each time you finish another budget, you revise your WBS template to
include new information you gleaned from the recently completed project.
The next time you start to plan a quarterly budget-preparation project, begin
with the WBS template that you’ve developed from your past projects. You
then add and subtract activities as appropriate for this particular budget
preparation.
By drawing on previous experience, you can prepare your WBS in less time
and be more confident that you’ve included all the important activities.
Improving your WBS templates
The more accurate and complete your WBS templates are, the more time
they can save on future projects. This section offers several suggestions for
continually improving the quality of your templates.
When using templates, keep the following in mind:
 Develop templates for frequently performed tasks as well as for entire
projects. Templates for the annual organization blood drive or the sub-
mission of a newly developed drug to the Food and Drug Administration
are valuable. So are templates for individual tasks that are part of these
projects, such as awarding a competitive contract or having a document
printed. You can always incorporate templates for individual tasks into a
larger WBS for an entire project where you plan to perform these tasks.
79
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

 Develop and modify your WBS template from previous projects that
worked, not from initial plans that looked good. Often you develop a
detailed WBS at the start of your project, but you may forget to add
activities that you overlooked in your initial planning. If you update your
template from a WBS that you prepared at the start of your project, it
won’t reflect what you discovered during the actual performance of the
project.
 Use templates as starting points, not ending points. Make it clear to
your team members and others involved in the project that the template
is only the start of your WBS, not the final version. Every project differs
in some ways from similar ones in the past. If you don’t critically exam-
ine the template, you miss activities that weren’t in previous projects
but that need to be in this one.
 Continually update your templates to reflect your experiences from
different projects. The postproject evaluation is an excellent opportu-
nity to review and critique your original WBS. (See Chapter 15 for infor-
mation on how to plan and conduct this evaluation.) At the end of your
project, take a moment to revise your WBS template to reflect what you
discovered.
Identifying Risks While Detailing
Your Activities
In addition to helping you identify activities to perform, a WBS helps you
identify unknowns that may cause problems. As you think through the work
to complete your project, you often identify considerations that may affect
how or whether you can perform certain project activities. Sometimes this
information is certain and sometimes it’s unknown. Identifying and dealing
effectively with unknowns can dramatically increase your chances for suc-
cess with your project.
Unknown information can fall into either of two categories:
 A known unknown: Information you don’t have but someone else does.
 An unknown unknown: Information that you don’t have because it
doesn’t yet exist.
You deal with known unknowns by finding out who has the information and
determining the information. You deal with unknown unknowns by
80
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project) 

 Buying insurance to minimize damage that occurs if something doesn’t
turn out the way you wanted.
 Developing contingency plans for when you do get the information.
 Trying to influence what eventually happens.
You’ve just become aware that twice in the past month a computer operator
accidentally spilled some coffee when he was preparing to mount the tape on
a tape drive, and it destroyed the tape. You also know that the survey you’re
going to conduct requires a tape mounted on a tape drive. So now you’re con-
cerned that Mr. Coffee will accidentally destroy your tape also.
Whether or not he’ll spill coffee on your tape is an unknown unknown when
you prepare your plan. You can’t be certain whether he’ll spill coffee on your
tape because it’s an unintended, unplanned act (at least we hope so!).
Because you can’t find out whether or not it’ll happen, you have to consider
the following approaches to address this risk:
 You can buy insurance. For example, have one or more back-up tapes.
 You can develop a contingency plan. For example, have the statistician
who guides the selection of the sample also develop a scheme for select-
ing names randomly by hand from the hard copy of the data tape.
 You can take steps to reduce the likelihood that coffee is spilled on
your data tape. For example, on the morning that your data tape is to be
run, check beforehand to see whether open cups of coffee are in the
computer room.
Developing the WBS helps you identify a situation that may compromise your
project’s success. You then must decide how to deal with that situation. See
Chapter 8 for more detailed information on how to identify and manage pro-
ject risks and uncertainties.
Gathering What You Need to 
Know about Your Activities
After detailing your project work, specify all important information about
your lowest-level activities. You and your team will use this information to
develop the remaining parts of your plan and refer to it during the project. To
ensure easy access, keep this information in a WBS dictionary that’s available
to all members. The project manager (or her designee) should approve all
changes to information in this dictionary.
81
Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There

The WBS dictionary contains the following information:
 Work detail: Narrative description of work processes and procedures to
accomplish the activity
 Inputs: Work products from other activities that this activity will use
 Outputs: Products or results of this activity
 Roles and responsibilities: How team members will work with each
other on this activity
 Duration: Estimated calendar time this activity will take
 Required resources: People, funds, equipment, facilities, raw materials,
information, and so on that this activity needs
Sometimes the dictionary also includes the following information:
 Immediate predecessors: Activities that must be completed right before
this activity can begin
 Immediate successors: Activities that can be started as soon as this
activity is finished

cess when you have a plan that meets your client’s
needs and that you believe is possible to accomplish.
In this part, I show you how to develop a feasible and
responsive initial project schedule and how to respond
when you need to complete your project earlier than
planned. I discuss how to estimate the people, funds, and
other resources you’ll need to perform the project work.
And last, but definitely not least, I discuss how you can
identify and deal with potential project risks.

P
roject assignments always have deadlines. So even though you’re not
sure what your new project is to accomplish, you want to know when it
has to be finished. Unfortunately, when you do find out the end date, your
immediate reaction is often “But I don’t have enough time!”
The truth is, when you receive your project assignment, you usually have no
idea how long it’ll take. First reactions tend to be based on fear and anxiety
more than facts, especially if you’re trying to juggle multiple responsibilities
and the project sounds complex.
You need an organized approach to clarify how you plan to perform your pro-
ject’s activities, what schedules are possible, and how you’ll meet deadlines
that initially appear unrealistic. This chapter describes a technique that
helps you proactively develop your schedule possibilities.
The discussion in this chapter on network diagramming to develop project
schedules is the most technically detailed presentation in this book. Even
though the technique takes about ten minutes to master, the explanations
and illustrations can appear overwhelming. If this is your first contact with
flowcharts, I suggest you initially scan this chapter and then read the differ-
ent sections several times. The more you read the text, the more logical the
explanations become. However, if you get frustrated with the technical
details, put the book away and come back to it at another time. You’ll be sur-
prised how much clearer the details are the second or third time around!

Part II: Determining When and How Much 
Illustrating Your Work Plan 
with a Network Diagram
Suppose you have a project consisting of ten activities and each takes one
week. How long will it take you to complete your project? Truth is, you can’t
tell. You may finish the project in one week if you can perform all activities at
the same time and have sufficient resources. You may take ten weeks if you
have to do the activities one at a time in sequential order. Or you may take
between one and ten weeks if you have to do some, but not all, activities in
sequence.
In order to determine the amount of time for your project, you need two
pieces of information:
 Duration: How long each individual activity takes
 Sequence: The order in which you perform the activities
To develop a schedule for a small project, you can probably consider the
durations and interdependencies in your head. But projects with 15 to 20
activities or more — many of which you can perform at the same time —
require a method to guide your analysis.
This section can help you develop feasible schedules by showing how to draw
network diagrams and then how to choose the best one for your project.
Defining a network diagram’s elements
A network diagram is a flowchart that illustrates the order in which you per-
form project activities. Think of the network diagram as your project’s test
laboratory — it gives you a chance to try out different strategies before per-
forming the work.
No matter how complex your project, its network diagram has the following
three elements.
Event
An event is a significant occurrence in the life of your project, sometimes
called a milestone or a deliverable. Events take no time and consume no
resources; they occur instantaneously. Think of them as signposts that sig-
nify a certain point in your trip to project completion. Events mark the start
or finish of one activity or a group of activities. Examples of events are draft
report approved and design begun.

The word event in this book is different from other contexts you may have
seen. Suppose you read that the premier social event of a postelection year
was the presidential inaugural ball. In project management terms, the inau-
gural ball is an activity rather than an event because it takes time and lots of
resources!
Activity
An activity is the work to go from one event to the next in your project.
Activities take time and consume resources; they describe action. Examples
of activities are design report format and identify needs for new product.
Make sure you define activities and events clearly. The more clearly you
define them, the more accurately you can estimate time and resources, the
more easily you can assign the task to someone else, and the more meaning-
ful your tracking becomes.
Span time
Span time is the actual calendar time to complete an activity, also called dura-
tion. The amount of work effort, people’s availability, and whether people can
work on an activity at the same time all affect the activity’s span time.
Capacity of nonpersonnel resources (for example, a computer’s processing
speed and the pages per minute that a copier can print) and availability of
those resources also affect span time. Delay can also add to an activity’s span
time. If your boss spends one hour reading your memo after it sat in her
inbox for four days and seven hours, the activity’s span time is five days,
even though she spent only one hour reading it.
Understanding the basis of a span-time estimate helps you to figure out ways
to reduce it. For example, suppose you estimate that a software package
must run for 24 hours on a computer to do a complete test. If you can use the
computer only six hours in any one day, the span time for your software test
is four days. Suppose you want to cut the span time for your software test in
half. Doubling the number of people assigned to the activity won’t do it, but
getting approval to use the computer for 12 hours a day will.
The units of time describe two related, but different, activity characteristics.
Span time is duration; work effort is the amount of time a person needs to
work on the activity to complete it. (See Chapter 6 for more discussion of
work effort.) Suppose four people had to work together full time for five days
to complete an activity. The activity’s span time is five days. The work effort
is 20 person-days (four people multiplied by five days).
87
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Drawing your network diagram
Determining your project’s end date requires you to choose the dates each
activity starts and ends and the date each event is reached. These dates
depend on the order in which you perform your activities and their span
times. This section shows you how to draw a network diagram that repre-
sents the order in which you perform your project’s activities so you can
determine schedule possibilities.
Activity-in-the-box approach
The activity-in-the-box technique (also called activity-in-the-node, precedence
diagramming, or dependency diagramming) uses three symbols to describe
the three elements of the diagram:
 Boxes represent events and activities. You can tell whether a box repre-
sents an event or an activity by its span time. If the span time is 0, it’s an
event. Note: Event boxes are sometimes highlighted with lines that are
bold, double, or otherwise more noticeable.
 The letter t represents span time.
 Arrows represent the direction work flows from one activity or event to
the next.
Figure 5-1 presents a simple illustration. When you reach Event A (the box on
the left), you can perform Activity 1 (the box in the middle). You estimate
that Activity 1 will take two weeks to complete. Upon completing Activity 1,
you reach Event B (the box on the right). The arrows indicate the direction of
workflow.

88
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Figure 5-1 illustrates how you can use the activity-in-the-box approach to rep-
resent events and activities. In this approach, however, the use of events is
optional; you can have one activity lead directly to another with no event
between them.
Activity-on-the-arrow approach
You can also draw your network diagram using the activity-on-the-arrow
approach, (also called the classical or traditional approach). This method
depicts the three elements of the diagram as follows:
 Circles represent events.
 Arrows represent activities.
 The letter t represents span time.
The two diagramming approaches are interchangeable; anything you can rep-
resent with one technique you can also represent with the other. If you
choose, you can draw your entire project using only activities in the activity-
in-the-box approach, but with the activity-in-the-arrow technique, all activi-
ties must start and end with an event.
Today, most integrated project-management software packages use the activity-
in-the-box approach. Because many people find that format to be simpler and
more intuitive, I use the activity-in-the-box technique in this book.
Analyzing Your Network Diagram
Think of your project as a trip for you and several friends. Each of you has a
car and will travel a different route to the final destination. During the trip,
two or more of your routes will cross at certain places. You agree that all
people who pass through a common point must arrive at that point before
anyone can proceed on the next leg of the journey. The trip is over when all
of you reach the final destination.
You certainly don’t want to undertake a trip this complex without planning it
out on a road map. Planning your trip allows you to
 Determine how long the entire trip will take.
 Identify potential difficulties along the way.
 Consider alternate routes to get to your final destination more quickly.
This section helps you plan your project by telling you how to read and inter-
pret a road map (your network diagram) so you can determine the likely con-
sequences of your approach.
89
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Reading your network diagram
Use the following two rules to draw and interpret your network diagram.
After you understand these rules, analyzing the diagram is a snap:
 Rule 1: After you finish an activity or reach an event, you can proceed to
the next activity or event, as indicated by the arrow(s).
 Rule 2: Before you can start an activity or reach an event, you must have
first completed all activities and reached all events with arrows pointing
to that activity or event.
Figure 5-2 illustrates a network diagram. According to Rule 1, from Start, you
can work on Activity 1 or 3, which means you can do Activity 1 or Activity 3
or both Activities 1 and 3. In other words, they’re independent of one
another.
You may also choose to do neither of the activities. Rule 1 is an allowing rela-
tionship, not a forcing relationship. In other words, you can work on the activ-
ities that the Start arrows lead to, but it doesn’t say that you must work on
any of them. For example, suppose a part of your plan includes two activities
to build a device: receive parts and assemble parts. As soon as you receive the
parts, you can start to assemble them. However, suppose that you’ve
received all of the parts you ordered. Nothing says that you must start to
assemble them immediately; you can assemble them if you want to, but you
can also wait.

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Of course, if you work on neither activity, your project will be delayed. But
that’s your choice. According to Rule 2, you can start working on Activity 2 in
Figure 5-2 as soon as you complete Activity 1 because the arrow from Activity
1 is the only one leading into Activity 2. Rule 2, therefore, is a forcing (or
requiring) relationship. If arrows from three activities enter Activity 2, you
must complete all three activities before you can start Activity 2. The dia-
gram doesn’t indicate that you can start working on Activity 2 by completing
only one or two of the three activities.
Interpreting your network diagram
The network diagram illustrates the order of your project’s activities. Use the
diagram to figure out when to start and end activities and when you’ll finish
the entire project if you perform the activities in this way. This section gives
you the key information you need to determine your schedule.
You need the following information to find out the schedule that your
approach will allow:
 Critical path: A sequence of activities that takes the longest time to
complete
 Noncritical path: A sequence of activities that you can delay and still
finish your project in the shortest possible time
 Slack time: The maximum amount of time that you can delay an activity
and still finish your project in the shortest possible time
 Earliest start date: The earliest date you can start an activity
 Earliest finish date: The earliest date you can finish an activity
 Latest start date: The latest date you can start an activity and still finish
your project in the shortest possible time
 Latest finish date: The latest date you can finish an activity and still
finish your project in the shortest possible time
The lengths of your project’s critical path(s) define your project’s length. If
you want to finish your project in less time, consider ways to shorten the
critical path.
Monitor critical-path activities closely during performance because any delay
in critical-path activities delays your project’s completion.
91
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Your project can have two or more critical paths at the same time. In fact,
every path can be critical if they all take the same amount of time. However,
when every path is critical, you have a high-risk situation; a delay in any
activity immediately causes a delay in the completion of the project.
Critical paths can change as your project unfolds. Sometimes activities on a
critical path finish so early that the path becomes shorter than one or more
other paths. Also, activities on an initially noncritical path can be sufficiently
delayed so that its completion time exceeds the time of the current critical
path.
The forward pass — determining critical paths, noncritical paths, 
and earliest start and finish dates
Your first step in analyzing your project’s network diagram is to start at the
beginning and see how quickly you can complete the activities along each
path. This start-to-finish analysis is called the forward pass.
You can perform a forward pass through the diagram in Figure 5-2 as follows:
Using Rule 1 (check out “Reading your network diagram” earlier in this chap-
ter for more info), you can consider working on Activity 1 or 3 as soon as the
project starts. First consider Activities 1 and 2 in the upper path:
 The earliest you can start Activity 1 is the moment the project starts.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 1 is the end of week 5 (add Activity
1’s estimated span time of five weeks to its earliest start time, which is
the start of the project).
 According to Rule 2, the earliest you can start Activity 2 is the beginning
of week 6 because the arrow from Activity 1 is the only one entering
Activity 2.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 2 is the end of week 6.
So far, so good. Now consider the path of Activities 3, 4, and 5 at the bottom
of the diagram:
 The earliest you can start Activity 3 is the moment the project starts.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 3 is the end of week 1.
 The earliest you can start Activity 4 is the beginning of week 2.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 4 is the end of week 4.
Ah, there’s a catch. According to Rule 2, the two arrows entering Activity 5
indicate you must finish both Activity 1 and Activity 4 before you begin
92
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Activity 5. Even though you can finish Activity 4 by the end of week 4, you
can’t finish Activity 1 until the end of week 5. Therefore, the earliest you can
start Activity 5 is the beginning of week 6.
This situation illustrates the following guideline: If two or more activities lead
to the same activity, the earliest you can start that activity is the latest finish
date of the preceding activities.
In the example, the finish dates for Activity 4 and Activity 1 are the ends of
weeks 4 and 5, respectively. Therefore, the earliest date you can start Activity
5 is the beginning of week 6.
Is your head spinning yet? Take heart, the end is in sight.
 The earliest you can start Activity 5 is the beginning of week 6.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 5 is the end of week 7.
 The earliest you can finish Activity 2 is the end of week 6. Therefore, the
earliest you can finish the entire project (and reach the event called
End) is the end of week 7.
So far you have the following information about your project:
 The length of the critical path (the shortest time in which you can com-
plete the project) is seven weeks. Only one critical path takes seven
weeks; it includes the event Start, Activity 1, Activity 5, and the event End.
 Activity 2, Activity 3, and Activity 4 aren’t on critical paths.
 The earliest dates you can start and finish each activity in your project
are summarized in Table 5-1.

Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

The backward pass — determining slack times and 
earliest start and finish dates
You’re halfway home. In case resource conflicts or unexpected delays pre-
vent you from beginning all the project activities at their earliest possible
start times, you want to know how much you can delay the activities along
each path and still finish the project at the earliest possible date. This finish-
to-start analysis is called the backward pass.
You found out from the forward pass that the earliest date you can reach the
event End is the end of week 7. However, Rule 2 says you can’t reach that
event until you have completed Activities 2 and 5. Therefore, to finish your
project by the end of week 7, the latest you can finish Activities 2 and 5 is the
end of week 7. Again, consider the lower path with Activities 3, 4, and 5.
 You must start Activity 5 by the beginning of week 6 to finish it by the
end of week 7.
 According to Rule 2, you can’t start Activity 5 until you finish Activities 1
and 4. Therefore, you must finish Activities 1 and 4 by the end of week 5.
 Hence, you must start Activity 4 by the beginning of week 3.
 You must finish Activity 3 before you can work on Activity 4. Therefore,
you must finish Activity 3 by the end of week 2.
 You must start Activity 3 by the beginning of week 2.
Finally, consider the upper path.
 You must start Activity 2 by the beginning of week 7.
 You can’t work on Activity 2 until you finish Activity 1. Therefore, you
must finish Activity 1 by the end of week 6.
Now again, you see a catch. You must finish Activity 1 by the end of week 5 to
start Activity 5 at the beginning of week 6. But, to start work on Activity 2 at
the beginning of week 7, you must finish Activity 1 by the end of week 6. So,
finishing Activity 1 by the end of week 5 satisfies both requirements. This sit-
uation illustrates the following guideline:
If two or more arrows leave the same activity, then the latest date to finish
the activity or reach the event is also the earliest that you can start the next
activity or reach the next event.
In Figure 5-2, the latest start dates for Activities 2 and 5 are the beginnings of
week 7 and week 6, respectively. Therefore, the latest date to finish Activity 1
is the end of week 5. The rest is straightforward: You must start Activity 1 by
the beginning of week 1 at the latest.
94

Table 5-2 summarizes the latest dates to start and finish each activity in our
example.

Sometimes you may feel that all these calculations are bogging you down.

much simpler. See how this detail looks in Figure 5-3.

Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Finally, determine the slack time of each activity in one of these two ways:
 Subtract the earliest possible start date from the latest allowable start
date.
 Subtract the earliest possible finish date from the latest allowable finish
date.
Activity 2, 3, and 4 have one-week slack times, while Activity 1 and 5 have no
slack time. Note: If an activity’s slack time is 0, the activity is on a critical
path.
An activity’s slack time is the amount of time it can be delayed without caus-
ing a delay in your overall project completion time. However, slack time is
actually associated with a sequence of activities rather than with an individ-
ual activity. Table 5-3 indicates that both Activities 2 and 3 (which are on the
same path) have slack times of one week. If Activity 2 is delayed by a week,
Activity 3 will have 0 slack time.
Working with Your Project’s 
Network Diagram 
The previous sections in this chapter explain the general rules and proce-
dures for drawing and analyzing any network diagram. This section tells you
how to create and analyze the network diagram for your own project.
Determining precedence
To draw your project’s network diagram, decide the order of your project’s
activities. This section tells you different reasons why it may be necessary to
perform activities in a particular order.
A predecessor to Activity 4 is an activity you must complete before you can
work on Activity 4. An activity is an immediate predecessor to Activity 4 if you
don’t have any other activities between it and Activity 4.
When you determine the immediate predecessors for every activity, you have
all the information you need to draw your project’s network diagram. Several
considerations affect the order in which you must perform your project’s
activities:
96
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

 Required relationships: Relationships that must be observed if project
work is to be a success.
• Legal requirements: Federal, state, and local laws or regulations
that require certain activities to be done before others.
As an example, consider a pharmaceutical company that has devel-
oped a new drug in the laboratory and demonstrated its safety and
effectiveness in clinical trials. The manufacturer wants to start pro-
ducing and selling the drug immediately but can’t. Federal law
requires that the company obtain Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval of the drug before selling it.
• Procedural requirements: Company policies and procedures that
require certain activities to be done before others.
Suppose you’re developing a new piece of software for your organi-
zation. You’ve finished your design and want to start programming
the software. However, your organization follows a systems devel-
opment methodology that requires the management-oversight
committee to formally approve your design before you can
develop it.
 Discretionary relationships: Relationships you choose to establish
between activities.
• Logical relationships: Performing certain activities before others
because that procedure seems to make the most sense.
Suppose you’re writing a report. Because much of Chapter 3
depends on what you write in Chapter 2, you decide to write
Chapter 2 first. You could write Chapter 3 first or work on both at
the same time, but that plan increases the chance that you’ll have
to rewrite some of Chapter 3 after you finish Chapter 2.
• Managerial choices: Arbitrary decisions to work on certain activi-
ties before others.
Perhaps one activity is harder, more apt to have problems, and so
on. These reasons can influence the manager’s decision to adjust
the relationship of the project activities.
Decide on the immediate predecessors for your project’s activities in one of
two ways:
 Front-to-back: Start with the activities you can perform as soon as your
project begins and work your way through to the end.
1. Select the first activity or activities to perform as soon as your
project starts.
2. Consider one of these activities and decide which activity or
activities you can perform as soon as you finish your first ones.
97
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

3. Continue in this way until you’ve considered all activities in the
project.
 Back-to-front: Choose the activity or activities that will be done last on
the project and continue backward toward the beginning.
1. Identify the last activity or activities of your project.
2. Choose one of these activities and decide which activities to per-
form immediately before you start the last activity.
3. Continue in this manner until you’ve considered all activities in
your project.
In either case, record your project’s immediate predecessors in a simple
table as illustrated in Table 5-3.
Table 5-3

Determine precedence based on the nature and requirements of the activi-
ties, not on the resources you think are available. Suppose Activities A and B
can be performed at the same time but you plan to assign them to the same
person. In this case, don’t make Activity A the immediate predecessor for B,
thinking that the person can work on only one activity at a time. Instead, let
your diagram show that A and B can be done at the same time. Later, if you
find out you have another resource who can help out with this work, you’ll be
able to evaluate the impact of performing Activities A and B at the same time.
(See Chapter 6 for a discussion on how to determine when people are over-
committed and how to resolve these situations.)
When you create your network diagram for simple projects, consider using
stickum notes to represent your activities and events and attach them to
chart paper or a wall. For more complex projects, consider using an inte-
grated project-management software package. (See Chapter 17 for a discus-
sion of how to use software to support your project planning and control,
and check out Microsoft Project For Dummies by Martin Doucette [Wiley] for
the lowdown on the most popular project-management software package.)

Using a network diagram to 
analyze a simple example
Consider the following example of preparing for a picnic to illustrate the net-
work diagram to determine schedules and meet expectations. (I’m not sug-
gesting that you plan all your picnics this way, but it does illustrate the
technique!)
It’s Friday evening after a very tense week. You and your friend are consider-
ing what to do on the weekend to unwind and relax. The forecast for Saturday
is sunny and mild weather, so you decide to visit a local lake for a picnic
tomorrow. Because you want to get the most enjoyment possible from your
picnic, you decide to plan this outing carefully by drawing and analyzing a
network diagram.
Table 5-4 illustrates the seven activities you must perform to prepare your
picnic and get to the lake.

In addition, you agree to observe the following constraints:
 You and your friend will start all activities at your house at 8 a.m.
Saturday — you can’t do anything before that time.
 You must complete all activities.
 You can’t change who does the activities.
 The two lakes you’re considering are in opposite directions from your
house, so you have to choose before you begin your drive.
First, you decide the order of these various activities. In other words, you deter-
mine the immediate predecessors for each activity. Two dependencies are
required: Your friend must boil the eggs before he can make the egg sandwiches
(Duh!), and you must agree on which lake to visit before you start your drive.
The order of the rest of the activities is up to you. You may consider the fol-
lowing approach:
 Decide which lake before you do anything else.
 After you agree on the lake, you drive to the bank to get money.
 After you get money from the bank, you get gasoline.
 After you agree on the lake, your friend starts to boil the eggs.
 After the eggs are boiled, your friend makes the sandwiches.
 After you get back with the gas and your friend finishes the egg sand-
wiches, you both load the car.

Draw the network diagram for your project from the information in this table
as follows:
1. Start your project with a single event, Start.
2. Find all activities that have no immediate predecessors — they can all
start as soon as you begin your project.
In this case, Activity 5 is the only activity that has no immediate 
predecessors.
3. Start your diagram by representing these relationships, as illustrated
in Figure 5-4.
Represent Activity 5 in a box and draw an arrow from Start to this box.
4. Find all activities that have your first activity as an immediate 
predecessor.
In this case, your table shows two activities (2 and 7) have Activity 5 as
an immediate predecessor. Represent them in boxes and draw arrows
from Activity 5 to these boxes.
5. Continue on in the same way with the remaining activities.
Recognize from Table 5-5 that only Activity 6 has Activity 2 as an imme-
diate predecessor. Draw a box representing Activity 6 and draw an arrow
from Activity 2 to Activity 6.
The table shows further that only Activity 3 has Activity 7 as an immedi-
ate predecessor. Draw a box representing Activity 3 and draw an arrow
from Activity 7 to Activity 3. Figure 5-5 depicts your diagram-in-progress.
Now you realize that Activity 1 has both Activities 3 and 6 as immediate
predecessors.
6. Draw a box representing Activity 1 and draw arrows from Activity 3
to Activity 1 and from Activity 6 to Activity 1.
The rest is pretty straightforward. Only Activity 4 has Activity 1 as its
immediate predecessor.

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Now for the important questions. First, how long will you take to get to the
lake for your picnic? The upper path (Activity 2 and 6) takes 15 minutes to
complete. The lower path (Activity 7 and 3) takes 20 minutes to complete.
Because the critical path is the longest path through your project, the path
with Activity 5, 7, 3, 1, and 4 is the critical path. Your trip will take 57 minutes
if you follow your network diagram.
Next, can you delay any activities and still get to the lake in 57 minutes? If so,
which ones?
 The upper path (Activity 2 and 6) is a noncritical path.
 The network diagram reveals that Activity 5, 7, 3, 1, and 4 are on the crit-
ical path. Therefore, you can’t delay any of them if you want to get to the
lake in 57 minutes.
 However, Activity 2 and 6 can be performed at the same time as Activity
7 and 3. Activity 7 and 3 take 20 minutes to perform, while Activity 2 and
6 take 15 minutes. Therefore, Activity 2 and 6 have a total slack time of 5
minutes.
Developing Your Project’s Schedule
Developing your schedule requires a combination of activities, resources,
and activity-performance sequences that gives you the greatest chance of
meeting your client’s expectations with the least amount of risk. This section
helps you start making a schedule. It also focuses on some potential pitfalls
and meeting time crunches.
Taking the first steps
After you’ve specified your project’s activities (see the discussion on creating
Work Breakdown Structures in Chapter 4), take the following steps to develop
an initial project schedule.
1. Identify immediate predecessors for all activities.
Immediate predecessors define the structure of your network diagram.
2. Estimate span times for all activities.
See the section on estimating activity duration later in this chapter.
3. Identify all intermediate and final dates that must be met.
These define the criteria that your schedule must meet.
103
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

4. Identify all activities or events outside your project that affect your
project’s activities.
Once you know these, you can set up the appropriate dependencies
between them and your project’s activities and events.
5. Draw your network diagram.
Use the network diagram to determine what schedules your project can
achieve.
6. Analyze your project’s network diagram to identity all critical paths
and their lengths and to identify the slack times of noncritical paths.
(See the section Interpreting your network diagram earlier in this chapter
for additional information on critical and noncritical paths.)
This information helps you choose which project activities to monitor
how often. It also suggests strategies for getting back on track if you
encounter unexpected schedule delays.
If the completion date is acceptable to your client, you’re done with your
scheduling. However, if your client wants you to finish faster than your initial
schedule allows, your analyses are just beginning.
Avoiding the pitfall of backing 
in to your schedule
Beware of developing a schedule by backing in, that is, starting at the end of a
project and working your way back toward the start to identify activities and
estimate durations that allow you to meet your client’s desired end date.
Using this approach substantially decreases the chances that you’ll meet the
schedule for the following reasons:
 You may miss activities because your focus is on meeting a time con-
straint, not ensuring that you’ve identified all required work.
 You base your span-time estimates on what you can allow activities to
take rather than what they’ll require.
 The order for your proposed activities may not be the most effective
one.
I was reviewing a colleague’s project plan a while back and noticed that she
had allowed one week for her final report’s review and approval. When I
asked her whether she thought this estimate was realistic, she replied that it
certainly wasn’t but she had to put it in for the project plan to work out. In
other words, she was using time estimates that totaled to the number she
wanted to reach rather than one she could reach.
104
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Meeting an established time constraint
Suppose your initial schedule has you finishing your project in three months,
but your client wants the results in two months. Consider the following
options for reducing the length of your critical paths:
 Recheck the original span-time estimates.
• Be sure you have clearly described the activity’s work.
• If you used past performance as a guide for developing the span
times, recheck to be sure all characteristics of your current situa-
tion are the same as those of the past performance.
• Ask other experts to review and validate your estimates.
• Ask the people who’ll actually be doing the work on these activi-
ties to review and validate your estimates.
 Consider using more-experienced personnel. Sometimes more-
experienced personnel can get work done in less time. Of course, using
more-experienced people may cost you more money. Further, you’re 
not the only one in your organization who needs those more-experienced
personnel; they may not always be available!
 Consider different strategies for performing the activities. As an exam-
ple, if you estimate a task you’re planning to do internally to take three
weeks, see if you can find an external contractor who can perform it in
two weeks.
 Consider fast tracking — removing tasks from the critical path and
doing them in parallel with other tasks on the path. Fast tracking
reduces the time to complete the remaining path and may change the
path to a noncritical one.
The technical term for performing activities in parallel to reduce the time is
called fast tracking. Although you can finish faster by fast tracking, you
increase the risk of having to redo portions of your work because finishing
some tasks before others may have an impact on them.
As you find ways to reduce the lengths of critical paths, monitor paths that
aren’t initially critical to ensure that they haven’t become critical. If one or
more paths have become critical, use these same approaches to reduce their
length.
105
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Illustrating ways to shorten a schedule
If your initial schedule doesn’t meet your requirements, consider changing
your network diagram to reduce the length of your project’s critical paths.
Consider the example of preparing for a picnic to see how you can approach
this task.
Figure 5-6 illustrates your initial 57-minute plan. If arriving at the lake in 57
minutes is okay, your analysis is done. But suppose you and your friend agree
that you must reach the lake no later than 45 minutes after you start on
Saturday morning. What changes can you make to save you 12 minutes?
You may be tempted to change the estimated time for the drive from 30 min-
utes to 18 minutes, figuring that you’ll just drive faster. Unfortunately, doing
so doesn’t work if the drive really takes 30 minutes. Remember, your plan
represents an approach that you believe has a chance to work (though not
necessarily one that’s guaranteed). If you have to drive at speeds in excess of
100 miles per hour over dirt roads to get to the lake in 18 minutes, reducing
the time has no chance of working. (However, it does have an excellent
chance of getting you a speeding ticket.)
To develop a more realistic plan to reduce your project’s schedule, take the
following steps:
1. Start to reduce your project’s time by finding the critical path and
reducing its time until a second path becomes critical.
2. To reduce your project’s time further, shorten both critical paths by
the same amount until a third path becomes critical.
3. To reduce the time still further, shorten all three critical paths by the
same amount of time until a fourth path becomes critical, and so on.
Performing activities at the same time
One way to shorten a path’s length is by taking one or more activities off the
path and doing them in parallel with the remaining activities. However, often
you have to be creative to successfully perform activities in parallel.
Consider the 57-minute solution to the picnic example in Figure 6-1. Assume
an automatic teller machine (ATM) is next to the gas station that you use. If
you use a full-service gas island, you can get money from the ATM while the
attendant fills your gas tank. This strategy allows you to perform Activities 2
and 6 at the same time — in a total of 10 minutes rather than the 15 minutes
you indicated in the initial diagram.
106
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

At first glance, it appears you can cut the total time down to 52 minutes by
making this change. But look again. These two activities aren’t on the critical
path, so reducing their time has no impact on the overall project schedule.
(In case you think you can save five minutes by helping your friend make the
sandwiches, remember: You agreed that you can’t swap jobs.)
Try again. This time, remember you must reduce the length of the critical
path if you want to save time. Here’s another idea: On your trip to the lake,
you and your friend are in the car, but only one of you is driving. The other
person is just sitting there. If you agree to drive, your friend can load the fix-
ings for the sandwiches into the car and make the sandwiches while you
drive. This adjustment appears to take ten minutes off the critical path. But
can it?
The diagram in Figure 5-6 reveals that the upper path (Activity 2 and 6) takes
15 minutes, and the lower path (Activity 7 and 3) takes 20 minutes. Because the
lower path is the critical path, removing five minutes from it can reduce the
time to complete the overall project by five minutes. However, reducing the
lower path by five minutes makes it the same length (five minutes) as the
upper path. Therefore, both paths take five minutes and both are now critical.
Taking an additional 5 minutes off the lower path (because the sandwiches
take 10 minutes to make) doesn’t save more time for the overall project
because the upper path still takes 15 minutes. However, you do have five min-
utes of added slack to the lower path.
Figure 5-7 reflects this change in your network diagram. Consider using your
first idea to get money at the ATM while an attendant fills your car with gas.
This move now can save you five minutes because the upper path is now 
critical.

Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

Finally, you can decide which lake to visit and load the car at the same time,
which saves you an additional two minutes. The final 45-minute solution is
illustrated in Figure 5-8.
Consider a situation where you have to complete two or more activities
before you can work on two or more new ones. Show this relationship in your
diagram by defining an event that represents the two or more completed
activities and then draw arrows from the completed activities to this event.
Then draw arrows from that event to the new activities (see Figure 5-8).
In the example, you first complete the activities Get money, Buy gasoline, and
Boil eggs, and then you can perform the activities Load car and Decide which
lake. You represent this relationship by drawing arrows from each of the first
three activities to a newly defined event, Ready to load car, and by drawing
arrows from that event to the activities Load car and Decide which lake.
If you think this analysis is getting complicated, you’re right. You pay a price
to perform a group of activities faster. This price includes
 Increased planning time: You have to precisely detail all the activities
and their interrelationships because you can’t afford to make mistakes.
 Increased risks: The list of assumptions grows, increasing the chances
that one or more will turn out to be wrong.
In the picnic-at-the-lake example, you make the following assumptions to
arrive at a possible 45-minute solution:
 You can get right into the full-service island at a little after 8 a.m.
 Attendants are available to fill up your tank as soon as you pull into the
full-service island.

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

 The ATM is available and working when you pull into the full-service
island.
 You and your friend can load the car and make a decision together with-
out getting into an argument that takes an hour to resolve.
 Your friend can make sandwiches in the moving car without totally
destroying the car’s interior in the process.
However, when you identify assumptions, you can increase the chances that
they’ll be true or develop contingency plans in case they don’t happen.
Consider your assumption that you can get right into a full-service island
about 8 a.m. on Saturday. You can call the gas station owner and ask whether
your assumption is reasonable. If the gas station owner tells you he has no
any idea of how long you’ll have to wait, you may ask him whether it would
make a difference if you paid him $200 in cash. When he immediately
promises to cordon off the full-service island from 7:55 a.m. until 8:20 a.m.
and assign two attendants to wait there, one with a nozzle and the other with
a charge receipt ready to be filled out, so you’ll be out in ten minutes, you
realize you can reduce most uncertainties for a price! Your job is to deter-
mine how much you can reduce the uncertainty and what its price will be.
Devising an entirely new strategy
So you have a plan for getting to the lake in 45 minutes. You can’t guarantee
the plan will work, but at least you have a chance. However, suppose your
friend now tells you he really needs to get to the lake in 10 minutes, not 45!
Your immediate reaction is probably “Impossible!” You figure creative plan-
ning is one thing, but how can you get to the lake in 10 minutes when the
drive alone is 30 minutes?
By deciding that there is no way to arrive at the lake in 10 minutes when the
drive alone takes 30 minutes, you have just redefined your criterion for pro-
ject success. The true indicator of success in this project is arriving at the
lake for your picnic, not performing a predetermined set of activities. The
seven activities you originally formulated were fine, as long as they allowed
you to get to the lake within your established constraints. But if the activities
won’t allow you to achieve success as you now define it (arriving at the lake
in ten minutes), consider changing the activities.
Suppose you decide to seek out modes other than driving to the lake. After
some checking, you discover that you can rent a helicopter for $500 per day
that’ll fly you and your friend to the lake in ten minutes. However, you figure
that you both were thinking about spending a total of $10 on your picnic (for
admission to the park at the lake). Clearly, spending $500 to get to a $10
picnic is absurd. So you don’t even tell your friend about the possibility of
renting the helicopter; you just reaffirm that getting to the lake in ten minutes
109
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

is impossible. Unfortunately, you didn’t know the reason your friend wanted
to get to the lake in ten minutes. You find out that he can make a $10,000
profit on a business deal if he can get to the lake in ten minutes. Is spending
$500 worth making $10,000? Sure. But you didn’t know about the $10,000.
When developing schedule options, it’s not your job to preempt someone
else from making a decision. Instead, you want to present all options and
their associated costs to the decision maker so he can make the best deci-
sion. In this instance, you should have told your friend about the helicopter
option so he could have taken the relevant facts into account when he made
the final decision.
Subdividing activities
You can often reduce the time to complete a sequence of activities by sub-
dividing one or more of the activities and performing parts of them at the
same time. Figure 5-9 illustrates how your friend can save seven minutes
when boiling the eggs and preparing the egg sandwiches by using this
approach:
 Divide the activity of boiling into two parts.
• Prepare to boil eggs: Remove the pot from the cupboard, take the
eggs out of the refrigerator, put the water and eggs in the pot, put
the pot on the stove, and turn on the heat — estimated span time
of three minutes.
• Boil eggs in water: Allow the eggs to boil in a pot until they’re hard —
estimated span time of seven minutes.
Time to boil eggs and make sandwiches = 13 minutes

Figure 5-9:

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

 Divide the activity of making the egg sandwiches into two parts.
• Perform initial steps to make sandwiches: Take the bread, mayon-
naise, lettuce, and tomatoes out of the refrigerator; take the wax
paper out of the drawer; put the bread on the wax paper; put the
mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomatoes on the bread — estimated span
time of seven minutes.
• Finish making sandwiches: Take the eggs out of the pot; shell, slice,
and put them on the bread; slice and finish wrapping the sand-
wiches — estimated span time of three minutes.
 First “Prepare to boil eggs”; next “Boil eggs in water” and “Perform
initial steps to make sandwiches” at the same time; finally “Finish
making sandwiches”.
As Figure 5-9 illustrates, the total time to boil the eggs and prepare the sand-
wiches is (3 minutes + 7 minutes + 3 minutes) = 13 minutes. Note: The total
time for the original activity to boil the eggs is still ten minutes (three minutes
to prepare and seven minutes in the water), and the total time for the original
activity to make the sandwiches is also still ten minutes (seven minutes for
the initial steps and three minutes to finish up). By specifying exactly how to
perform these activities, you can complete them in 13 minutes rather than 20.
Estimating Activity Duration
A span-time estimate is your best sense of how long you need to actually per-
form an activity. The estimate is not how long you want the activity to take or
how long someone tells you it must take; the estimate is how long you think it
really will take.
Unrealistically short span-time estimates can actually cause an activity to
take longer than necessary.
 Because unrealistic estimates appear to comfortably meet your sched-
ule targets, you don’t seek realistic alternative strategies that increase
the chances of accomplishing activities in their declared span times.
 If people believe span-time estimates are totally unrealistic, they’ll stop
trying to achieve them. When delays occur during an activity, people
will accept them as inevitable instead of trying to find ways to overcome
them.
Check out the nearby sidebar “Estimating isn’t negotiating or bartering” for
an example of estimating activity duration.
111
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?

This section looks more closely at what you need to accurately estimate
activity duration, including underlying factors, important resources, histori-
cal information, and your personal estimating skills.
Determining the underlying factors
The underlying makeup of an activity determines how long it will take.
Therefore, accurately estimating that activity’s span time requires you to
describe its different aspects and determine the effect of each one.
When estimating an activity’s span time, consider past experience, expert
opinion, and other available sources of information to clarify the following
components:
 Work performed by people: Physical and mental activities that people
perform. Examples include writing a report, assembling a piece of equip-
ment, and thinking of ideas for an ad campaign.
 Work performed by nonhuman resources: Testing software on a com-
puter and printing a report on a high-speed copy machine are examples.
 Physical processes: Physical or chemical reactions. Concrete curing,
paint drying, and chemical reactions in a laboratory are examples.
 Time delays: Passage of time where no resource is performing. Time
delays are typically due to the availability of resources. The need to
reserve a conference room two weeks prior to holding a meeting is an
example.
Considering resource characteristics
Knowing the types of resources an activity requires can improve your esti-
mate of the activity’s span time. For example, not all reproduction machines
generate copies at the same rate. Specifying the characteristics of the partic-
ular machine you’ll use can improve the activity’s span-time estimate.
You may need the following types of resources to support project work:
 Personnel
 Equipment
 Facilities
 Raw materials
 Information
 Funds
112
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

For each resource you need, determine its
 Capacity: Productivity per unit time period
 Availability: On the calendar; when a resource will be available
For example, a reproduction machine that produces 1,000 copies per minute
can complete a job in half the time a machine that produces 500 copies per
minute requires. Likewise, a large printing job can take half as long if you
have access to a reproduction machine for four hours a day rather than two
hours a day. (See Chapter 7 for more information on estimating project
requirements for nonhuman resources.)
Finding sources of supporting information
The first step toward improving your estimate’s accuracy is recognizing the
need to consider particular information when estimating span time. However,
the accuracy also depends on the accuracy of the information you base that
estimate on.
The information you need often has no single authoritative source. Therefore,
compare information from the following sources as you prepare your estimates:
113
Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
Estimating isn’t negotiating or bartering
Suppose your boss asks you to complete a pro-
ject in six months. You explore all alternative
strategies and determine you can’t complete
the project in less than 12 months. After some
back-and-forth negotiating, you and your boss
agree that you’ll complete the project in nine
months.
If you were both being honest initially, you just
guaranteed the project’s failure. You have
agreed to complete the project three months
before you can possibly finish it. Your boss has
agreed to accept the final product three months
after she needs it.
If you weren’t honest initially, you each discov-
ered something about the other. You found out
that you need to add 50 percent to any end date
your boss gives you (nine months is 50 percent
more than six months). And your boss figured
out that she can subtract 25 percent from your
earliest date (nine months is 25 percent less
than 12 months).
At the worst, you’ve reached an agreement that
defines a performance target that’s unaccept-
able to both of you. At the best, you’ve figured
out not to trust the information you share with
each other!

 Historical records of how long similar activities have taken in the past
 People who’ve performed similar activities in the past
 People who’ll be working on the activities
 Experts familiar with the type of activity, even if they haven’t performed
work exactly like it before
Improving activity span-time estimates
In addition to ensuring accurate and complete data, do the following to
improve the quality of your span-time estimates (see Chapter 4 for further
discussion of how to define and describe your project’s activities):
 Define your activities clearly. Minimize the use of technical jargon and
describe work processes fully.
 Subdivide your activities until your lowest-level activity estimates are
two weeks or less.
 Define activity start and end points clearly.
 Involve the people who’ll perform an activity when estimating its
duration.
 Minimize the use of fudge factors. A fudge factor is an amount of time
you add to your best estimate of span time just to be safe. Automatically
estimating your final span-time estimates to be 50 percent greater than
your initial ones is an example. Fudge factors compromise your planning
for several reasons:
• Work tends to expand to fill the allotted time. If you’re able to
finish an activity in two weeks but use a 50 percent fudge factor to
indicate a span time of three weeks, the likelihood that you’ll finish
in less than three weeks is almost zero.
• People use fudge factors to avoid studying activities in sufficient
depth; as a result they can’t develop viable performance strategies.
• Team members and other project audiences lose faith in the accu-
racy and feasibility of your plan because they know you’re playing
with numbers rather than thinking activities through in detail.
No matter how hard you try, estimating span time accurately can be next to
impossible for some activities. Examples are activities you haven’t done
before, activities you’ll perform in the future, and activities with a history of
unpredictability. In these cases:
114
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

 Make the best estimate you can by following the approaches and guide-
lines in this section.
 Monitor activities closely as your project unfolds to identify details that
may affect your initial estimate.
 Reflect any changes in your project schedule as soon as you become
aware of them.
Displaying Your Project’s Schedule
Your network diagram doesn’t contain your schedule — it presents informa-
tion to consider as you develop your schedule. After you’ve selected your
actual dates, choose one of the following formats to present your schedule:
 Key-events list: A table that lists events and the dates you plan to reach
them
 Activities list: A table that lists activities and the dates you plan to start
and end them
 Combined key-events/activities list: A table that includes events and
activity dates
 Gantt chart: A timeline that illustrates when each activity starts, how
long it continues, and when it ends
 Combined milestone chart and Gantt chart: A timeline that illustrates
when activities start, how long they continue, when they end, and when
selected events are achieved
Your 45-minute schedule for your picnic at the lake is presented in a key-
events/activities list and a combined milestone and Gantt chart in Figures
5-10 and 5-11 (where triangles represent milestones), respectively.
Each format can be effective in particular situations. Consider the following
when choosing the format to display your schedule:
 Key-events lists and activities reports are more effective for indicating
specific dates.
 The Gantt chart provides a clearer picture of the relative lengths of
activities and when they overlap.
 The Gantt chart provides a better high-level overview of a project.

Chapter 6
Establishing Whom You Need,
How Much, and When
In This Chapter
 Focusing first on people’s abilities
 Accurately planning your project’s personnel needs
 Striking a balance among all those commitments
I
remember reading the following declaration from a stressed-out project
manager: “We’ve done so much with so little for so long [that] they now
expect us to do everything with nothing!”
The truth is, of course, you can’t accomplish anything with nothing; every-
thing has a price. You live in a world of limited resources and not enough
time. You always have more work to do than time and resources allow. You
need to decide which tasks to pursue and then do everything possible to suc-
ceed at those activities. By identifying and planning the resources you need
to perform your project, you can
 Explain team members’ contributions to the project.
 Ensure that the resources are available when they’re needed.
 Develop more accurate and realistic schedules.
 Monitor resource expenditures to identify and address possible overruns.
Some organizations have procedures that detail and track every resource on
every project. Other organizations don’t formally plan or track project
resources at all. However, planning your resource needs is invaluable to your
project’s success, whether or not your organization requires it.
This chapter helps you figure out whom you need on your project, when, and
for how long. The chapter also discusses how you can identify and manage
conflicting demands for people’s time.

Determining People’s Skills
and Knowledge
Your project’s success rests on your ability to enlist the help of the right
people to perform necessary work. Take the following steps to clarify the
work and to get qualified people to perform it.
 Identify the skills and knowledge needed to perform your project’s
activities.
 Specify the people who’ll work on each activity.
 Determine how much effort they have to invest to complete their
assignments.
 For those tasks on which they are less than fully committed, determine
when they need to invest their time.
If you can influence the selection of team members, the personnel planning
in the following sections can help you get the most qualified people. When
you’re arbitrarily assigned people or when your team already exists, the plan-
ning in the next sections can help you make the best use of their individual
skills and knowledge.
Working with a Skills Roster
The first requirement for selecting appropriate people for your project is
knowing the skills and knowledge of potential candidates. A Skills Roster,
illustrated in Figure 6-1, is a convenient format to display the skills and
knowledge of people who may work on your project.

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

The left-hand column identifies skill and knowledge areas and the top row
lists people’s names. At the intersection of the rows and columns, you iden-
tify the level of each person’s particular skills, knowledge, and interests.
You can use the following symbols to represent people’s skill, knowledge, and
interest levels:
 Primary capability: Person is able to assume a lead role in an assignment
requiring this skill or knowledge.
 Secondary capability: Person has some training or experience in the
skill or knowledge area but should work under another’s guidance.
 Interest: Person would like to work on assignments involving this skill or
knowledge.
The Skills Roster in Figure 6-1 shows that Sue is qualified to lead technical
writing assignments and that she wants to work on this type of assignment.
Ed is qualified to lead legal research tasks, but he’d prefer not to work on
them. He prefers working on questionnaire design activities, but he has no
skills or knowledge in this area.
By the way, you may figure that you’ll never assign Ed to work on a question-
naire design activity because he has no relevant skills or knowledge. However,
if you’re trying to find more people who can develop questionnaires, Ed is a
prime candidate. Because he wants to work on these types of assignments, he
most likely is willing to put in extra effort to acquire the necessary capabilities.
Depicting skill and knowledge 
levels in more detail
You can use a variety of numerical or alphanumeric codes to describe a
person’s skill, knowledge, or interest level. As an example, you can represent
relative levels with the following numerical scale:
5: Outstanding
4: Above Average
3: Average
2: Limited
1: Minimal
You may also indicate people’s experience on activities that require skills and
knowledge.
119
Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

In addition to helping you request the appropriate people, a Skills Roster can
reveal gaps and weaknesses in staff skills and knowledge. This information
can guide the following:
 Training: The organization can develop or make available training to
address the deficiencies.
 Career development: Individuals can develop skills and knowledge that
are in short supply in order to increase their opportunities for greater
responsibilities in the organization.
 Recruiting: When looking to hire staff for specific assignments,
recruiters can look for candidates who have skills and knowledge in
areas that the organization is deficient in.
Creating the Skills Roster
Because Skills Rosters can be useful in different areas, your organization’s
group managers and supervisors, training departments, and employee-
recruiting departments may already have rosters for some or all of the staff.
If you decide to create a roster or help someone else in your organization
create one, proceed as follows:
1. Develop a complete list of the skill and knowledge areas that may be
required for anticipated project assignments.
Determine these areas by consulting with subject-matter experts, your
human resources department, and staff people who have done similar
work in the past.
2. Develop a list of all people who’ll be included in the Skills Roster.
Include all people who may be assigned to your project.
3. Have the people on your list rate their proficiency in each skill and
knowledge area and then their interest in working on assignments in
each area.
4. Have each person’s direct supervisor rate the person’s skill, knowl-
edge, and interest.
5. Compare the ratings made by the person and his supervisor and rec-
oncile any differences.
Consult the person being rated and his supervisor to determine the
reasons for differences in ratings; choose the rating that you feel most
accurately describes the person’s proficiency.
6. Prepare a final version of the Skills Roster.
120
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

In a project environment, you often work with people you don’t know well or
haven’t spent much time with. Making a special effort to find out about their
skills, knowledge, and interests helps you to make more appropriate use of
their special talents. In turn, this effort improves the team members’ morale
and productivity.
Reconciling ratings: When a person
and her supervisor’s views differ
Comparing a person’s ratings of her own skills, knowledge, and interests with
those made by her supervisor can help identify situations that may lead to
future performance problems. The following are typical situations, potential
problems, and possible solutions:
 A person rates her skills and knowledge in an area higher than her
supervisor rates them.
• Potential situation: She may feel that her supervisor is unfair,
choosing not to give her challenging assignments with greater
responsibility.
• Possible solution: Her supervisor can give her a more challenging
assignment and monitor her performance closely. If all goes well, her
supervisor’s opinion of her capabilities can improve. If she has prob-
lems with the assignment, she can work out a plan with her supervi-
sor to develop any skills or knowledge that she may be lacking.
 A person rates her skills and knowledge in an area lower than her
supervisor rates them.
• Potential situation: She checks with her supervisor about the
smallest issues and decisions because she feels she’s not qualified
to deal with them herself.
• Possible solution: Her supervisor can explain to her why he feels
she’s qualified to handle her assignment; her supervisor can point
out when she’s handling issues correctly and why.
 A person has interests in areas that her boss doesn’t know about.
• Potential situation: She misses out on opportunities to work on
assignments.
• Possible solution: The person can frequently talk with her supervi-
sor about her interests and why she thinks she may perform well
on assignments in these areas.
121
Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

 A person’s boss thinks she has interests in areas where she doesn’t.
• Potential situation: The person’s boss repeatedly gives her assign-
ments in which she has little or no interest; she becomes bored
and disinterested in work, and her productivity suffers.
• Possible solution: The person can discuss her interests with her
boss; she can ask her boss whether she can work in those areas in
addition to her normal assignments.
Estimating Needed Commitment
Just because a person has the right skills and knowledge doesn’t assure suc-
cess. That person must be given an adequate amount of time to perform all
the necessary work.
This section tells you how to prepare a Human Resources Matrix to display
the people you need and the effort they’ll have to put in to complete their
tasks. In addition, it explains how you can take into account productivity,
efficiency, and availability to make your estimates more accurate.
Using a Human Resources Matrix
Planning your personnel needs begins with identifying whom you need and
how much effort they have to invest. You can display this information in a
Human Resources Matrix, as illustrated in Figure 6-2. The Human Resources
Matrix displays the people assigned to each project activity and the work
effort each person will contribute to each assignment.

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Work effort or person effort is the actual time a person spends doing an activ-
ity. Express work effort in units of person-hours, person-days, person-weeks,
and so forth. (You may still hear people express work effort as man-hours or
man-days. Same concept — just outdated and politically incorrect!)
Work effort is related to, but different from, span time (duration). Work effort
is a measure of resource use; span time is a measure of time passage (see
Chapter 5 for more discussion of span time). Consider the work effort to com-
plete the design questionnaire in the Human Resources Matrix in Figure 6-2.
According to the matrix, J. Jones works on this activity for 32 person-hours
and an unnamed analyst works on it for 24 person-hours.
This information alone, however, doesn’t tell you the span time of the activ-
ity. If both people can work on the activity at the same time, if they’re both
assigned 100 percent to the project, and if no other aspects of the task take
additional time, then the activity may be finished in four days. However, if
either person is available for less than 100 percent time, if one or both people
must work overtime, or if one person has to finish her work before the other
can start, the span time won’t be four days.
Describing needed personnel
Gather the different personnel for the top row of the Human Resources
Matrix as follows. In your Work Breakdown Structure (see Chapter 4 for fur-
ther discussion), a lowest-level activity is one that’s not subdivided any fur-
ther. From your Linear Responsibility Chart (see Chapter 10 for further
discussion), identify all personnel who will play a role on each lowest-level
activity in your project. You can specify these people by listing the following:
 Name: The person who’ll do the work
 Position description: The position or title of the person who’ll do
the work
 Skills and knowledge: The specific skills and knowledge that the person
must have
Early in your planning, try to specify needed skills and knowledge, such as must
be able to develop work process flow charts or must be able to use Microsoft
PowerPoint. If you can identify the exact skills and knowledge that a person
must have for a particular task, you increase the chances that the proper
person will be assigned.
123
Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

On occasion, you may use a position description or title (such as operations
specialist) to identify a needed resource. In doing so, you assume anyone with
that title has the necessary skills and knowledge. Unfortunately, titles are
often vague and position descriptions are frequently out of date. Therefore,
using titles or position descriptions are risky ways to get the right person
for the job.
Very often, you identify people you want on your project by name. The
reason is simple: If you’ve worked with someone before and she’s done a
good job, you want to work with her again. Unfortunately, although it’s great
for that person’s ego, this method often reduces the chances that you’ll get
the best person for your project. People who develop reputations for excel-
lence often get more requests than they can handle. When you don’t specify
the particular skills and knowledge needed for the activity, the manager —
who has to find a substitute for that overextended person — doesn’t know
what skills and knowledge the substitute needs to have.
Estimating required work effort
For all lowest-level activities, estimate the work effort that each person has to
invest and enter the numbers in the appropriate boxes in the Human
Resources Matrix. Develop your work-effort estimates as follows:
 Describe in detail all work to perform the activity. Include work
directly and indirectly related to the activity.
Examples of work directly related to an activity include writing a report,
meeting with clients, performing a laboratory test, and designing a new
logo. Examples of indirect work include training to perform activity-
related work and preparing periodic activity-progress reports.
 Consider history. Past history doesn’t guarantee future performance. It
does, however, provide a guideline for what’s possible.
Determine whether an activity has been done before. If it has, review
written records to determine the work effort. If written records weren’t
kept, ask people who’ve done the activity before to estimate the work
effort they invested.
When using prior history to support your estimates, be sure
• The people had qualifications and experience similar to those of
the people who’ll work on your project.
• The facilities, equipment, and technology were similar to those
that’ll be used for your project.
• The time frame was similar to the one you anticipate for your pro-
ject activity.
124
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

 Have the person who’ll do the work participate in estimating the
required work effort. Having people contribute to their work-effort esti-
mates provides several benefits: Their understanding of the activity
improves; the estimates are tailored for a person with their particular
skills, knowledge, and prior experience; and their commitment to do the
work for that level of work effort increases.
If you know who’ll be working on the activity, have those people partici-
pate during the initial planning. If people don’t join the project team
until the start or during the project, have them review and comment on
the plans you’ve developed.
 Consult with experts familiar with this type of activity, even when
they haven’t performed work exactly like it before. Experience and
knowledge from all sources improve the accuracy of your estimate.
Factoring in productivity, efficiency,
and availability
Being assigned to a project full time doesn’t mean a person can perform pro-
ject work at peak productivity 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. Additional
personal and organizational activities reduce the amount of work he produces.
Therefore, consider each of the following factors when you determine the
number of hours that people need to complete their project assignments:
 Productivity: The results a person produces per unit of time that he
spends on an activity. The following affect his productivity:
• Knowledge and skills: The raw talent and capability he has to
perform a particular task.
• Prior experience: His familiarity with the work and the typical
problems of a particular task.
• Sense of urgency: A person’s drive to generate the desired results
within established time frames. Urgency influences a person’s
focus and concentration on an activity.
• Ability to switch among several tasks: A person’s level of comfort
moving to a second task when she hits a roadblock in her first one
so she doesn’t sit around stewing about her frustrations and wast-
ing time.
• The quality and setup of the physical environment: Proximity
and arrangement of a person’s furniture and the support equip-
ment he uses; also the availability and condition of the equipment
and resources.
125
Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

 Efficiency: The proportion of time that a person spends on project work
as opposed to organizational tasks that aren’t related to specific pro-
jects. The following factors affect a person’s efficiency:
• Non-project-specific professional activities: Time spent attending
general organization meetings, handling incidental requests,
and reading technical journals and periodicals about her field
of specialty.
• Personal activities: Time spent getting a drink of water, going to
the restroom, organizing her work area, conducting personal busi-
ness on the job, and talking about non-work-related topics with 
co-workers.
The more time a person spends each day on non-project-specific and
personal activities, the less time he has to work on his project assign-
ments. (Check out the “How workers really spend their time” sidebar in
this chapter for more info.)
 Availability: The portion of time a person is at the job as opposed to on
leave. Organization policy regarding employee vacation days, sick days,
holidays, personal days, mental health days, administrative leave, and
so on define a person’s availability.
When deciding how many work-hours to allow a person to do a particular
task, adjust the number required at peak performance to allow for actual
levels of productivity, efficiency, and availability.
126
Part II: Determining When and How Much 
How workers really spend their time
A number of years ago, I read a study that deter-
mined the typical employee spends an average
of four hours of an eight-hour work day on pre-
planned project activities and work assign-
ments. The interviewers in this study spoke with
people with a wide range of job responsibilities
from more than 100 organizations. In other
words, the typical employee in this study aver-
aged a work efficiency of 50 percent!
Since then I have found several organizations
that conducted similar studies of their own oper-
ations. These organizations all found workers’
efficiency to be about 75 percent. You may think
the workers in these companies were more effi-
cient than the ones in the previous study. But, in
fact, these studies were biased. The people sur-
veyed wanted their organizations to think they
were spending most of their time working on pro-
ject assignments, and the organizations wanted
to believe this was the case. Still, the organiza-
tion studies found that people spent about 25
percent of each day doing something other than
preplanned, project-related activities!

Reflecting efficiency when 
you use historical data
How you reflect efficiency in your personnel planning depends on whether
and how you track your work effort. If you base your estimate on historical
data from time sheets and if either of the following situations is true, you
don’t have to factor in a separate measure for efficiency:
 Time sheets have one or more categories to show time spent on non-
project-specific work and people accurately report the actual time
they spend on their different activities.
If this is the case, the historical information represents the actual number
of hours people worked on the activity in the past. You can comfortably
use these numbers to estimate the actual level of effort this activity will
require in the future, as long as people continue to record in separate cat-
egories the hours they spend on non-project-specific activities.
 Your time sheet has no category for recording your time on non-project-
specific work. However, you report accurately (by activity) the time
you spend on work-related activities, and you apportion in a consis-
tent manner your non-project-specific work among the available pro-
ject activities.
This historical information reflects the number of hours that people
recorded they spent on the activity in the past, which includes time they
actually spent on the activity and a portion of the total time they spent
on non-project-specific work.
Again, if people’s time-recording practices haven’t changed, you can use
these numbers to estimate the hours that people record for this activity
in the future.
When collected properly, time-sheet data provide the most reliable source of
past experience. However, the following time-sheet practices can cause the
data to be inaccurate:
 People aren’t allowed to record overtime, so some hours actually spent
on an activity may never be known.
 People fill out their time sheets for a period several days before the period
is over, so they must guess their hourly allocations for those several days.
 You copy the work-effort estimates from the project plan onto your time
sheet each period instead of recording the actual number of hours you
spend.
If any of these situations exist in your organization, don’t use historical data
from time sheets to support your work-effort estimates for your current
project.
127
Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

Factoring efficiency into 
personal estimates
If you base estimates on the opinions of people with experience in similar
activities or people who’ll do the activities instead of on historical records,
you have to factor in a measure of efficiency.
First, ask the person to estimate the required work effort assuming 100 per-
cent efficiency. (In other words, don’t worry about normal interruptions
during the day, having to work on multiple tasks at a time, and so on.) Then
modify the estimate to reflect efficiency as follows:
 If the person will use a time sheet that has one or more categories for
non-project-specific work, then use her original estimate.
 If she’ll use a time sheet that doesn’t have categories to record 
non-project-specific work, add an additional amount to her original
estimate to account for her efficiency.
128
Part II: Determining When and How Much 
Be wise to the difference between efficiency
and availability
A while back, a person in one of my training ses-
sions was convinced that he took efficiency into
account when he estimated levels of resources
for his projects. His organization had performed
an internal study and determined that a typical
employee spent about 25 percent of his time on
a combination of sick days, holidays, vacation
time, personal days, and administrative leave.
Therefore, he defined full-time availability to be
120 person hours each month for an employee,
or 75 percent of the available 160 person hours.
(He derived his estimate of 160 person hours by
multiplying 8 hours per day by five days a week
by four weeks per month — admittedly, this is
an approximation.)
I explained that employees don’t work at 100
percent efficiency even though they’re avail-
able 120 person-hours each month. I told him
that people actually have about 90 productive
hours each month if they work at 75 percent
efficiency. (I determined 90 person-hours by
multiplying the 160 hours by the 75 percent
availability factor and that number by the 75 per-
cent efficiency factor.)
His reaction to my suggestion was interesting:
He completely rejected my analysis! He said he
refused to tell people that they only had to do six
hours of work for every eight hours they
charged to his project.
Unfortunately, he didn’t realize that it wasn’t
about allowing people to bill eight hours while
only working six. They were already doing this.
He needed to decide whether to recognize the
fact and reflect it in his plans or ignore it and
pretend it wasn’t happening. But ignoring the
fact wouldn’t change the reality.

As an example, suppose a person estimates that he needs 30 person-hours to
perform a task (if he can be 100 percent efficient) and his time sheets have no
categories for recording non-project-specific work. If you estimate that he’ll
work at about 75 percent efficiency, allow him to charge 40 person-hours to
your project to complete the task. (75 percent of 40 person-hours is 30
person-hours — the amount you really need.)
Failure to consider efficiency in work-effort estimates and reviews can lead to
incorrect conclusions about people’s performance. Suppose your boss
assigns you a project on Monday morning. He tells you the project will take
about 40 person-hours, but he really needs it by Friday close of business.
Suppose further that you work intensely all week and finish the task by
Friday close of business. In the process, you record 55 hours for the project
on your time sheet.
If your boss doesn’t realize that his initial estimate of 40 person-hours was
based on your working at 100 percent efficiency, he’ll think you took 15 hours
longer than you should have. On the other hand, if your boss recognizes that
55 person-hours on the job translates into about 40 person-hours of work on
specific project tasks, your boss will appreciate that you invested extra effort
to meet his aggressive deadline.
Although your performance is the same, overlooking the impact of efficiency
makes you appear less capable, while correctly considering it makes you
appear intensely dedicated.
The longer your involvement in an assignment, the more important efficiency
and availability become. Suppose you decide you have to spend one hour on
an assignment. You can reasonably figure your availability is 100 percent and
your efficiency is 100 percent, so you charge your project one hour for the
assignment. If you need to spend six hours on an assignment, you can figure
your availability is 100 percent, but you must consider 75 per cent efficiency
(or a similar planning figure). Therefore, charge one workday (eight work
hours) to ensure that you can spend the six hours on your assignment.
However, if you plan to devote one month or more to your assignment, you’ll
most likely take some leave days during that time. Even though your project
budget doesn’t have to pay for your annual or sick leave, one person-month
means you have about 97 hours for productive work on your assignment,
assuming 75 percent efficiency and 75 percent availability (2,080 hours total
in a year ÷ 12 months in a year × .75 × .75).
The numbers in Table 6-1 depict productive person-hours available at differ-
ent levels of efficiency and availability.

Develop your own planning figures if your organization uses different levels
of efficiency or availability.
In addition to reflecting the influence of efficiency and availability, improve
the accuracy of your work-effort estimates by doing the following:
 Define your activities clearly. Minimize the use of technical jargon
and describe associated work processes (see Chapter 4 for further
discussion).
130
Part II: Determining When and How Much 
Beware of the hierarchical work-effort estimate
Reflecting reality in your plan increases the
chances that you’ll actually accomplish it.
However, in your effort to consider all important
influences, sometimes you overcompensate
and actually make the plan less realistic.
Suppose you plan to assign a task to Harry’s
group. However, Harry passes the assignment to
Mary, who passes it to Beth, who passes it to Joe,
who actually does the required work. You ask
Harry to estimate the work effort to complete the
task. Harry in turn asks Mary, who asks Beth, who
asks Joe. Joe estimates it’ll take two person-
weeks of actual work to complete the task.
However, Joe, Beth, Mary, and Harry all know the
organization has determined that people work at
75 percent efficiency, so each of them reflects
this factor in his or her estimate to be realistic. So
Joe tells Beth it’ll take 2.7 person-weeks; Beth
tells Mary it’ll take 3.6 person-weeks; Mary tells
Harry it’ll take 4.8 person-weeks; and Harry tells
you it’ll take 6.4 person-weeks!
The problem, of course, was communication (or
the lack of it!). Each person separately factored
in efficiency without telling the other members
of the group. Including this factor one time is
appropriate; including it four times is wasteful
and misleading.

 Subdivide your activities. Do so until you estimate that your lowest-
level activities will take two person-weeks or less.
 Update work-effort estimates when project personnel or task assign-
ments change.
Ensuring You Can Meet Your 
Resource Commitments
If you work on only one activity at a time, determining whether or not you’re
overcommitted can be straightforward. But suppose you plan to work on sev-
eral activities that partially overlap during a particular time period. Then you
must decide when to work on each activity to see whether your multitasking
has left you overcommitted.
This section shows how to schedule your work effort for a task, how to iden-
tify resource overloads, and how to resolve those overloads.
Planning your initial allocations
The first step in making sure you can handle all project commitments is to
decide when you’ll work on each activity. If your initial plan has you working
on more than one activity at the same time, your next task is to determine the
total level of effort you’ll have to devote to meet your multiple commitments.
Begin planning out your workload by developing
 A Human Resources Matrix (see “Using a Human Resources Matrix” ear-
lier in this chapter for more info).
 A Person-Loading Graph or Person Loading Chart for each individual in
the Human Resource Matrix.
A Person-Loading Graph is a bar graph that depicts the level of work effort
you’ll spend each day, week, or month of an activity. A Person-Loading Chart
presents the same information in a table. The graphical format highlights
peaks, valleys, and overloads more effectively while the tabular format pre-
sents exact work-effort amounts more clearly. Prepare Person-Loading Charts
or Graphs for each project team member.
Suppose you plan to work on Tasks 1, 2, and 3 of a project. Table 6-2 depicts
the person-hours you plan to spend on each task (consider that efficiency
has already been reflected in these estimates — see the previous section
“Estimating Needed Commitment” for more on efficiency).

The Gantt Chart (see Chapter 5) in Figure 6-3 illustrates a plan to perform
Task 1 in Weeks 1, 2, and 3, Task 2 in Weeks 2 and 3, and Task 3 in Weeks 3, 4,
and 5. The chart shows Task 1 and Task 3 take three weeks and Task 2 takes
two weeks. Table 6-2 indicates 60 person-hours on Task 1 (50 percent of your
available time over the task’s three-week period), 40 person-hours on Task 2
(50 percent of your available time over the task’s two-week period), and 30
person-hours on Task 3 (25 percent of your available time over the task’s
three-week period). Therefore, if you don’t have to work on the tasks at the
same time, you should have no problem completing your work on each one.
But your initial plan has you working on both Tasks 1 and 2 in week 2 and on
all three tasks in week 3. You have to decide how much effort you’ll put in
each week on each of the three tasks to see whether you can work on all
three activities as they’re currently scheduled.
As a starting point, assume you’ll spend your time evenly over the life of each
task. That means you’ll work 20 hours a week on Task 1 during Weeks 1, 2,
and 3, 20 hours a week on Task 2 during Weeks 2 and 3, and 10 hours a week
on Task 3 during Weeks 3, 4, and 5.
Determine the total effort you’ll have to devote to the overall project each
week by adding up the hours you’ll spend on each task each week as follows:
 In Week 1, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Task 1 for a total commitment
to the project of 20 person-hours.
 In Week 2, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Task 1 and 20 person-hours on
Task 2, for a total commitment to the project of 40 person-hours.
 In Week 3, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Task 1, 20 on Task 2 and 10 on
Task 3, for a total commitment to the project of 50 person-hours.
 In Weeks 4 and 5, you’ll work 10 person-hours on Task 3, for a total com-
mitment to the project of 10 person-hours.
132
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

These commitments are displayed in the Person Loading Chart of Figure 6-3. A
quick review reveals that this plan has you working 10 hours of overtime in
Week 3. If you’re comfortable putting in this overtime, this plan works. If you
aren’t, you have to come up with an alternative strategy to reduce your Week
3 commitments.
Resolving potential resource overloads
If you don’t change your allocations for Week 3 and you’re unwilling to work
10 hours of overtime, you’ll accomplish less on one or both of the activities
than you planned because you’ll only put in 80 percent of the total effort
required. This lower per cent delays at least one of the two activities.

Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When

Consider the following strategies to eliminate your overcommitment:
 Allocate your time unevenly over the duration of one or more activi-
ties. Instead of spending the same number of hours on a task each week,
plan to spend more hours some weeks than others.
Suppose you choose to spend your hours unevenly over the duration
of Task 1 by increasing your commitment by 10 hours in the first week
and reducing it by 10 hours in the third week, as depicted in Table 6-3.
Figure 6-4 illustrates how this uneven distribution removes your over-
commitment in week 3.

 Take advantage of any slack time that may exist in your assigned
activities. Consider starting one or more activities earlier or later.
Figure 6-5 illustrates how you can remove the overcommitment in Week
3 by taking advantage of slack time that may be associated with Task 3. If
Task 3 has at least one week of slack time, you can reduce your total
work on the project in Week 3 to 40 person-hours by delaying both the
start and the end of Task 3 by one week. (See Chapter 5 for a detailed
definition and discussion of slack time.)
 Assign some of the work you were planning to do in Week 3 to some-
one else on your project, or to a newly assigned team member of an
external vendor, or to a contractor. Reassigning 10 person-hours of
your work in Week 3 removes your overcommitment.

Show the total hours that each person will spend on your project in a
Summary Person Loading Chart as illustrated in Figure 6-6. This chart helps
you to
 Identify who may be available to share the load of overcommitted
people.
 Determine the personnel budget for your project by multiplying the
number of hours people work on the project by their weighted labor
rates. (See Chapter 7 for more information.)
Coordinating assignments
across multiple projects
Working on overlapping tasks can place conflicting demands on a person,
whether the tasks are on one project or several. Although successfully
addressing these conflicts can be more difficult when more than one project
manager is involved, the techniques for analyzing them are the same. This
section illustrates how you can use the techniques and displays from the pre-
vious sections to resolve resource conflicts that arise from working on multi-
ple projects at the same time.
You can manage resource assignments across projects if you prepare Person
Loading Graphs or Charts for each project.
Figure 6-7 illustrates a Person Loading Chart for each person in your group.
This chart is derived from the summary Person Loading Charts for each

Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Suppose you’ll be working on three projects in January, February, and March.
Consider your current plans for February. You’re already committed to work
on Projects A, B, and C for 40, 20, and 40 person-hours, respectively. If some-
one wants you to devote 80 person-hours to Project D in February, you have
several options:
 If you assume that you have a total of 160 person-hours available in
the month, then you can devote 60 person-hours to Project D with no
problem.
 However, you don’t currently have the other 20 hours available. You may
consider the following:
• Find someone to assume 20 person-hours of your commitments to
Projects A, B, or C in February.
• Shift your work on one or more of these projects to January or
March.
• Work overtime.

Chapter 7
Planning for Other Resources
and Developing the Budget
In This Chapter
 Accounting for the project’s nonpersonnel costs
 Preparing a detailed budget
A
key part of effective project management is ensuring that resources
are available throughout the project when and where they’re needed
and according to specifications. When people are available for a scheduled
task but the necessary computers and laboratory equipment aren’t, your
project can have costly delays and unanticipated expenditures. Also,
your team members may experience frustration that leads to their reduced
commitment.
The final requirement for a successful project is sufficient funds to secure the
necessary people and resources. All major project decisions (including
whether to undertake it, whether to continue it, and — after it’s done — to
determine how successful it was) must consider the project’s costs.
This chapter looks at how you can determine, specify, and display your non-
personnel resource needs and then how to develop your project budget.
Planning for Nonpersonnel Resources
In addition to personnel, your project may require a variety of other resources
(such as furniture, fixtures, equipment, raw materials, and information) that
are important to your project’s success. Plan for these nonpersonnel

resources the same way you plan to meet your personnel requirements.
(Check out Chapter 6 for more on meeting your personnel needs.) Develop
the following:
 A resources matrix for all nonpersonnel resources
 Individual usage charts for each nonpersonnel resource
 A summary usage chart for all nonpersonnel resources
Figure 7-1 illustrates a resources matrix for nonpersonnel resources. The
matrix displays the following information for every lowest-level activity in
your project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS; see Chapter 4 for a discussion
of a WBS):
 The nonpersonnel resources to perform the activity (in this illustration,
computers, copiers, and use of a test laboratory)
 The required amount of each resource
Figure 7-1 suggests you’ll need 40 hours of computer time and 32 hours of the
test laboratory to design a device.
Estimate the amount of each resource you need by examining the nature of
the task and the capacity of the resource. For example, determine the amount
of copier time you need to reproduce a report as follows:
 Estimate the number of report copies.
 Estimate the number of pages per copy.
 Specify the copier capacity in pages per unit of time.
 Multiply the first two numbers and divide the result by the third number
to determine the amount of copier time to reproduce your reports.

Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget

 It enables you to weigh anticipated benefits against anticipated costs to
see whether the project makes sense.
 It allows you to see whether the necessary funds are available to sup-
port the project.
 It serves as a guideline to help ensure that you have sufficient funds to
complete the project.
Although you may not develop and monitor detailed budgets for all your pro-
jects, knowing how to work with project costs can make you a better project
manager and increase your chances of project success.
This section looks at different types of project costs that you may encounter.
It then offers helpful tips for developing your own project budget.
Looking at different types of project costs
A project budget is a detailed, time-phased estimate of all resource costs for
your project. You typically develop a budget in stages — from an initial rough
estimate to a detailed estimate to a completed, approved project budget. On
occasion, you may even revise your approved budget while your project is in
progress (check out “Refining your budget as you move through your pro-
ject” later in this section for more info).
Direct costs are expenditures for resources solely used for your project. Direct
costs include salaries for team members on your project; specific materials,
supplies, and equipment for your project; travel to perform work on your
project; and subcontracts that provide support exclusively to your project.
Indirect costs are expenditures that may support more than one project but
aren’t individually allocated to them. Indirect costs fall into two categories:
 Overhead costs: Expenditures that are difficult to subdivide and allocate
directly. Examples include employee benefits, office space rent, general
supplies, and the costs of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
You need an office to work on your project activities and office space
costs money. However, your organization has an annual lease for office
space, the space has many individual offices and work areas, and people
work on numerous projects throughout the year. Because you have no
clear record of your office’s rent, your office space is treated as an indi-
rect project cost.
 General and administrative costs: Expenditures that keep your organi-
zation operational (if your organization doesn’t exist, you can’t perform
your project). Examples include salaries of your contracts department,
finance department, and top management as well as fees for accounting
and legal services.
142
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Suppose you’re planning to design, develop, and produce a company brochure.
Direct costs for this project may include the following:
 Labor: Salaries for you and other team members for the hours you work
on the brochure
 Materials: The special paper stock for the brochure
 Travel: The costs for driving to investigate firms that may design your
brochure cover
 Subcontract: The services of an outside company to design the cover art
Indirect costs for this project may include the following:
 Employee benefits: Benefits in addition to your salary while you’re
working on the brochure
 Rent: The cost of the office space you use when you’re developing the
copy for the brochure
 Equipment: The computer you use to compose the copy for the
brochure
 Management and administrative salaries: A portion of the salaries of
upper managers and staff who perform the administrative duties neces-
sary to keep your organization functioning
Developing your project budget
Organization decision makers would love to have a detailed and accurate
budget when someone proposes a project so they can assess its relative bene-
fits to the organization and decide whether they have sufficient funds to sup-
port it. Unfortunately, you can’t prepare such an estimate until you develop a
clear understanding of the work and resources the project will require.
But in reality, decisions of whether to go forward and how to undertake pro-
jects must be made before people can prepare highly accurate budgets.
However, you can develop and refine your project budget in the following
stages to provide the best information in time for these key project decisions:
 Rough order-of-magnitude estimate: An initial estimate of costs based
on a general sense of the project work. This estimate is made without
detailed data. Depending on the nature of the project, the final budget
may wind up 100 per cent (or more!) higher than this initial estimate.
Prepare a rough order-of-magnitude estimate by considering: the costs
of similar projects (or similar activities that will be part of your project)
in the past; applicable cost and productivity ratios (such as the number
of assemblies that can be produced per hour), and other methods of
approximation.
143
Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget

This estimate sometimes expresses what someone wants to spend rather
than what the project will really cost. You typically don’t detail this esti-
mate by lowest-level project activity because you prepare it in a short
amount of time and before you’ve identified the project activities.
Whether or not people acknowledge it, initial budget estimates in annual
plans and long-range plans are typically rough order-of-magnitude esti-
mates. As such, these estimates may change significantly as the plan-
ners define the project in greater detail.
 Detailed budget estimate: An itemization of the estimated costs for each
project activity. You prepare this estimate by developing a detailed WBS
(see Chapter 4) and estimating the costs of all lowest-level activities.
(See Chapter 6 for information on estimating work effort and the section
“Planning for Nonpersonnel Resources” earlier in this chapter for ways
to estimate the needs for nonpersonnel resources.)
 Completed, approved project budget: A detailed project budget that
essential people approve and agree to support.
Refining your budget as you move through your project
A project moves through five phases as it evolves from an idea to a reality:
conceive, define, start, perform, and close. (See Chapter 1 for more discussion
of these phases.)
Prepare and refine your budget as your project moves through its different
phases.
1. Prepare a rough order-of-magnitude estimate in the conceive phase.
Use this estimate to decide whether the organization should consider this
project further by entering the define phase to develop a detailed plan.
Rather than an actual estimate of costs, this number often represents an
amount that your project can’t exceed in order to have an acceptable
return for the investment. Your confidence in this estimate is low
because you don’t base it on detailed analyses of the project activities.
2. Develop your detailed budget estimate in the define phase after you
specify your project activities and get approval for your detailed
budget.
Check with your organization to find out who must approve project bud-
gets. At a minimum, the budget is typically approved by the project man-
ager, the head of finance, and possibly the project manager’s supervisor.
144
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

3. Review your approved budget in the start phase — when you identify
the people who will be working on your project and when you start to
develop formal agreements for the use of equipment, facilities, ven-
dors, and other resources.
Check Chapter 12 for suggestions on what to look for when reviewing
the budget at the start of your project.
4. Get approval for any required budget changes before you move to the
perform phase.
Submit a request for any changes to the original budget to the same
people who approved the original budget in Step 2.
5. Monitor project activities and related occurrences throughout the
perform and close phases to determine when budget revisions are
necessary.
Check Chapter 12 for how to monitor project expenditures during your
project’s performance and how to determine whether budget changes
are needed. Submit requests for necessary budget revisions as soon as
possible to the same people identified in Step 2.
You may not personally work on all steps in your project budget. If you join
your project after the initial planning, be sure to review the budget plans and
resolve any questions and issues you may identify.
Estimating project costs
Use a combination of the following approaches to develop a detailed budget:
 Bottom-up: Develop detailed cost estimates for each lowest-level activity
in the WBS (refer to Chapter 4 for more information on this structure)
and total these estimates to obtain the total project-budget estimate.
 Top-down: Examine the estimated cost of each major work assignment
in the WBS to confirm its reasonableness.
Develop your bottom-up budget estimate as follows:
1. Consider each lowest-level activity.
2. Determine direct labor costs for each activity by multiplying the
number of hours each person will work on the activity by the person’s
hourly salary.
You can estimate direct labor costs by one of the following methods:
• Using the salary of each person on the project
• Using the average salary for people with a particular job title or in
a certain department, and so on
145
Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget

Suppose you need a graphic artist to design overheads for your presen-
tation. The head of the graphics department estimates the person will
spend 100 hours on your project. If you know Harry (with a salary rate
of $30 per hour) will work on the activity, you can estimate your direct
labor costs to be $3,000. However, if the director doesn’t know who’ll
work on your project, then use the average salary of a graphic artist in
your organization to estimate the direct labor costs.
3. Estimate the direct costs for materials, equipment, travel, contractual
services, and other resources for each activity.
See the section “Planning for Nonpersonnel Resources” earlier in this
chapter for information on how to determine nonpersonnel resources
you need for your project. Consult with your procurement department,
administrative staff, and finance department to determine the costs of
these resources.
4. Determine the indirect costs associated with each activity.
You typically estimate indirect costs as a fraction of the planned direct-
labor costs for the activity. In general, your organization’s finance
department determines this fraction annually by the following method:
• Estimating organization direct labor costs for the coming year.
• Estimating organization indirect costs for the coming year.
• Dividing the estimated indirect costs by the estimated direct labor
costs.
Choose your method of estimating indirect costs by weighing the poten-
tial accuracy of the estimate against the effort to develop it. See the
nearby “Two approaches for estimating indirect costs” sidebar.
Table 7-1 illustrates a typical budget estimate. Suppose you’re planning a pro-
ject to design and produce a company brochure. You already have the follow-
ing information:
 You estimate that you’ll spend 200 person-hours on the project at $30
per hour and Mary will spend 100 person-hours at $25 per hour.
 You estimate your stationery for the brochures to be $1,000.
 You estimate $300 in travel costs to visit vendors and suppliers.
 You expect to pay a vendor $5,000 for the brochure’s artwork.
 Your organization has a combined indirect cost rate of 60 percent.

The top-down budget estimate encourages you to consider the relative
emphases of different aspects. As an example, suppose you plan to develop a
new piece of equipment. You develop a bottom-up cost estimate that sug-
gests the project will cost $100,000 as follows:
 Design ($60,000)
 Development ($15,000)
 Testing ($5,000)
 Production ($20,000)
However, experience with similar projects suggests that approximately 40
percent of the total budget is devoted to design, not 60 percent. So your num-
bers indicate a design phase for a $150,000 project rather than a $100,000
project.
You have two choices: You can try to devise an alternative strategy for the
design, or you can request an additional $50,000 for your project. But
whichever you choose, you can’t just arbitrarily change the numbers. You
need a strategy for arriving at your new numbers!
147
Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget

148
Part II: Determining When and How Much 
Two approaches for estimating indirect costs
Accurately determining the true cost of a pro-
ject requires all activity and resource costs to
be allocated appropriately. However, the cost of
tracking and recording all expenditures can be
considerable. Therefore, organizations devel-
oped methods for approximating the amounts of
certain expenses assigned to different projects.
Following are two approaches for estimating
indirect costs associated with an activity: The
first approach defines two different indirect
rates; it’s more accurate but requires more
detailed record keeping, so it’s also more costly.
Option 1: Use one rate for overhead costs and
another rate for general and administrative
costs.
 Your finance department determines the
overhead rate by calculating the ratio of all
projected overhead costs to all projected
direct salaries.
 Your finance department determines the
general and administrative rate by calculat-
ing the ratio of all projected general and
administrative costs to the sum of all pro-
jected direct salaries, overhead costs, and
other direct costs.
 You determine overhead costs of an activ-
ity by multiplying its direct salaries by the
overhead rate.
 You determine general and administrative
costs of an activity by multiplying the sum of
its direct salaries, overhead costs, and
other direct costs by the general and
administrative rate.
Option 2: Use one indirect-cost rate for all over-
head and general and administrative costs.
 Your finance department determines the
combined indirect-cost rate by calculating
the ratio of all projected overhead costs to
all projected direct salaries.
 You determine an activity’s indirect costs by
multiplying its direct salaries by the indirect
cost rate.
Some organizations develop weighted labor
rates, which combine hourly salary and associ-
ated indirect costs. As an example, suppose
your salary is $30 per hour and your organiza-
tion’s indirect cost rate is 0.5. Your weighted
labor rate is $45 per hour ($30 + 0.5 × $30).

 Strategizing to stay on top of the risks
 Drafting a risk-management plan
Your first step toward a successful project is to develop a plan to produce
the desired results on time and within budget. If your project lasts a rela-
tively short time and you’re thorough and realistic in your planning, then
most likely your project will be a success.
However, the larger, more complex, and longer your project is, the more likely
some aspects won’t work out as you envisioned. Remember, “The best laid
plans . . ..” You have the greatest chance for success if you confront the possi-
bility of changes head-on and if you plan how to minimize the consequences
of those changes from the outset.
This chapter discusses how to consider potential risks when you’re deciding
whether you’ll undertake your project, when you’re developing your project
plan, and while you’re performing your project’s work. This chapter shows
you how to identify and assess the impact of project risks, and it explores
strategies for minimizing their consequences. Finally, this chapter gives
pointers for preparing your own risk-management plan.

Defining Risk and Risk Management
Risk is the possibility that you may not achieve your product, schedule, or
resource targets because something unexpected occurs or something
planned doesn’t occur. All projects have some degree of risk because predict-
ing the future with certainty is impossible. However, project risk is greater
 The longer your project lasts.
 The longer the time between preparing your project plan and starting
the work.
 The less experience you, your team members, or your organization may
have with similar projects.
 The newer your project’s technology.
Risk management is the process of identifying possible risks, assessing their
potential effect, and then developing and implementing plans for minimizing
those negative effects. Risk management can’t eliminate risks, but it offers
the best chance for successfully accomplishing your project despite the
uncertainties of a changing environment.
So how do you address your project’s risks? Take the following steps to
determine, evaluate, and manage the risks that may affect your project:
1. Identify risks.
Determine which aspects of your plan or project environment may
change.
2. Assess their potential effect on your project.
Assess what will happen if those aspects don’t work out the way you
envision.
3. Develop plans for mitigating the effect of the risks.
Decide how you can protect your project from the consequences of risks.
4. Monitor the status of your project’s risks throughout performance.
Determine whether existing risks are still present, whether the likeli-
hood of these risks is increasing or decreasing, and whether new risks
are arising.
5. Inform key audiences.
Explain the status and potential effect of all project risks — from the ini-
tial concept to the project’s completion.

Focusing on Risk Factors and Risks
The first step toward controlling risks is identifying them. However, not all
risks pose the same degree of concern to all projects, and using a scatter-gun
approach to identify risks that may affect your project leaves a significant
chance that you’ll overlook some important ones.
This section shows you how to identify potential risks on your project by rec-
ognizing the special situations that are most likely to occur.
Recognizing risk factors
A risk factor is a situation that may give rise to one or more project risks. A
risk factor itself doesn’t cause you to miss a product, schedule, or resource
target. However, it increases the likelihood that you’ll miss one.
The fact that you and your organization haven’t undertaken projects similar
to the present one is a risk factor. Because you have no prior experience, you
may overlook activities you need to perform or you may underestimate the
time and resources to perform them. Having no prior experience doesn’t
guarantee you’ll have these problems. However, it increases the chance that
you’ll have a problem.
Start to manage risks at the outset of your project and continue throughout
its performance. At each point during your project, identify risks by recogniz-
ing your project’s risk factors. Your plan and your current project phase can
both suggest risk factors.
151
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket
I met a man who was starting a large project
that was a top priority for his organization. His
project’s success heavily depended on one
person who would work on the project full time
for six months and perform all the technical
development. I asked whether he had consid-
ered the consequences of this person leaving
the project before it was finished. He said he
didn’t have to worry about that because he just
wouldn’t allow the man to leave.
It occurred to me that his approach for dealing
with risk was similar to the one of a woman who
cancelled her health insurance for a year —
because she wasn’t planning on getting sick! He
may have gotten top management to agree that
the person would have no other assignments for
the duration of his project. However, he still
couldn’t guarantee that the person wouldn’t get
sick or decide to leave the organization!

All projects progress through the following five phases:
 Conceive: An idea is born.
 Define: A plan develops.
 Start: A team forms.
 Perform: The team does the work.
 Close: The project ends.
(See Chapter 1 for a detailed discussion of these phases.)

these phases.

Identifying risks
As the next step in your risk assessment, identify the specific risks that may
result from each of your risk factors. With this information, you can deter-
mine the particular effects the risk may have on your project and decide how
you want to manage the risk.
Separately describe how each risk factor may cause you to miss your prod-
uct, schedule, or resource targets.
Suppose you plan to use a new technology in your project. Using a new tech-
nology is a risk factor. Possible product, schedule, and resource risks that
may arise from this risk factor are as follows:
 Product risk: The technology may not produce the desired results.
 Schedule risk: Tasks using the new technology may take longer than you
anticipate.
 Resource risk: Existing facilities and equipment may not be adequate to
support the use of the new technology.
155
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty

When identifying potential risks, do the following:
 Review past records of problems in similar situations. If a risk factor
actually resulted in an unexpected occurrence in the past, you definitely
want to be prepared for it this time.
 Brainstorm with experts and other people who have related experi-
ences. The more sources of expert opinion you consult, the less chance
you’ll overlook something important.
 Be specific. The more specifically you describe a risk, the better you can
assess its potential effect. As an example:
Specific: “Delivery may take three weeks rather than two.”
Nonspecific: “Activities may be delayed.”
Try to eliminate potential risk factors as soon as possible. For example, sup-
pose a key audience hasn’t approved your project’s objectives. Instead of just
noting the risk that you may not correctly address audience needs, try to get
the audience’s approval!
Assessing Risks: The Likelihood
and Consequences
The expected consequences from a risk depend upon the effect of the risk if it
becomes a reality and the probability that it will become a reality. Consider
the expected consequences of different risks to choose which risks you want
to actively manage and which risks you’ll leave alone. This section discusses
how to determine the probability that a particular risk will occur on your
project.
Gauging the likelihood of a risk
The weather forecaster saying that it may snow isn’t sufficient reason to go
out and buy a $1,000 snow thrower. First, you want to know the chances that
it’ll snow, and second, you want to know how much snow is likely to fall. If
the weather forecaster is sure the total accumulation will be at least 20
inches but the chances of it snowing at all are only one in 1,000, you may
decide not to spend $1,000 for such an unlikely situation.
156
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

The first step in deciding whether to deal proactively with a risk is assessing
the likelihood that it will occur. Use one of the following schemes to describe
the chances that a risk will occur:
 Probability of occurrence: You can express the likelihood that a risk
will occur as a probability. Probability is a number between 0 and 1, with
0.0 signifying a situation will never happen, and 1.0 signifying it will
always occur. (You may also express probability as a percentage, with
100 percent meaning the situation will always occur.)
 Category ranking: Classify risks into categories that represent their like-
lihood. You may use high, medium, and low, or always, often, sometimes,
rarely, and never.
 Ordinal ranking: Order the risks so the first is the most likely to occur,
the second is the next most likely, and so on.
 Relative likelihood of occurrence: If you have two possible risks, you
can project a relationship. For example, you can declare the first as twice
as likely to occur.
Relying on objective info
You can estimate the likelihood of a risk by comparing the number of times
the risk actually occurred on similar projects.
Suppose you designed 20 computer-generated reports over the past year for
new clients. Eight times, when you submitted your design for final approval,
new clients wanted at least one change. If you’re planning to design a computer-
generated report for another new client, you may conclude the chances are
40 percent that you’ll have to make a change in the design you submit.
When using objective information to determine the likelihood of different
risks,
 Consider previous experience with similar projects.
 Consider as many similar situations as possible.
 Keep in mind that the more similar situations you consider, the more
confidence you can have in your conclusions.
Counting on personal opinions
In the absence of objective data, solicit the opinions of experts and people
who have worked on similar projects in the past.
157
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty

You can estimate the likelihood of a particular risk by soliciting the opinions
of ten people who have worked on projects similar to yours. You can, for
example, ask them to rate the likelihood of a specific risk as high, medium, or
low. Suppose six people choose high, two choose medium, and two choose
low. You may then develop your estimate of the likelihood by assigning
values of 3, 2, and 1, to high, medium, and low, respectively, and determining
the weighted average of the responses as follows:
(6 × 3) + (2 × 2) + (2 × 1) = (18 + 4 + 2) ÷ 10 = 2.4
This formula suggests the risk has medium to high likelihood of occurring.
To increase the accuracy of these estimates, try the following:
 Define the category name as clearly as possible. You may suggest
that low means the likelihood of the risk is between 0 and 33 percent,
medium means 33 to 66 percent, and high means 66 to 100 percent.
 Consider the opinions of as many people as possible. The more data
points you have, the higher your confidence in the estimate.
 Be sure the projects your respondents have worked on are truly
similar to yours. Otherwise you have no reason to assume you can
use their experience to predict what’ll happen on your project.
 Don’t allow people to discuss their estimates with each other before
they share them with you. You’re looking for their individual opinions,
not a group consensus.
 After they’ve submitted their initial estimates to you, consider
having the people discuss their reasons for their estimates with
each other and then asking them whether they want to revise
their estimates. Some people may choose to modify their original
estimates if they realize they failed to take into account certain
important considerations.
Precision is different from accuracy. Precision refers to the detail of a number.
Accuracy refers to how correct the number is. You may estimate the likeli-
hood of a particular risk to be 67.23 percent. However, even though you
express the risk to two decimal places, your guess has little chance of being
accurate if you have no prior experience with similar projects.
Unfortunately, people often assume that more-precise numbers are also
more accurate. You can help avoid misinterpretations when you share your
assessments of likelihood by using round numbers, categories, or relative
rankings.
158
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

The more factors that suggest a particular risk may occur, the higher the like-
lihood that it will occur. For example, ordering from a vendor that you
haven’t worked with before raises the possibility that delivery times will be
longer than he promised. However, the likelihood of those delays is greater if
the item is also a special order, if you want delivery during a busy period for
the vendor, and if the vendor has to order several parts to make the item.
Estimating the extent of the consequences
Not long ago, I was waiting to see my doctor when the nurse came out and
told me the doctor had to attend to an emergency and would be slightly
delayed. Imagine my shock when, after waiting for three hours for the doctor,
I learned that he had gone to a hospital that was an hour away several hours
earlier and was currently in the middle of an emergency operation! If I had
known the doctor was going to be gone for several hours, I would have
rescheduled my appointment. Instead, because I didn’t know how long the
delay would be, I wasted three hours. And, unless I wanted to wait the rest of
the afternoon, I’d have to make a new appointment anyway.
After you identify the likelihood that a particular risk will affect your project,
be sure to determine the magnitude of the consequences that may result.
That magnitude directly influences how you choose to deal with the risk.
Determine the specific effect that each risk may have on your project’s prod-
uct, schedule, and resource performance. When evaluating these effects, do
the following:
 Consider the effect of a risk on the total project rather than on just a
portion of it. Taking one week longer than you planned to complete an
activity may cause you to miss intermediate milestones (and cause the
personnel waiting for the results of that activity to sit idle). However, the
effect on the project is even greater if the delayed activity is on your pro-
ject’s critical path (see Chapter 5), which means the one-week delay also
causes a one-week delay for your entire project.
 Consider the combined effect of related risks. The likelihood that
you’ll slip your schedule is greater if three activities on the same critical
path have a significant risk of slippage rather than just one.
Be sure to describe risks and their associated consequences as specifically as
possible. For example, suppose a key piece of equipment you ordered for your
project may arrive later than expected. You can describe that risk as the deliv-
ery may be late, or as the delivery may be delayed by two weeks. Just stating
that the delivery may be late doesn’t give you enough information to deter-
mine the effect of that delay on the overall project. It also makes estimating
159
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty

the possibility of that risk more difficult. Are you talking about a delay of one
day? One month? Stating that delivery may be delayed by two weeks allows
you to determine the effect on the overall schedule and resources more pre-
cisely. Starting early also allows you to decide how much you’re willing to
spend to avoid that delay.
A variety of formal techniques can support your risk estimation and
assessment:
 Decision trees: Diagrams that illustrate different situations that may
occur as your project unfolds, the likelihood of each situation occurring,
and the consequences to your project if it does.
Figure 8-1 illustrates a simple decision tree to help determine which of
two vendors to buy a piece of equipment from. Both vendors have pro-
posed a price of $50,000 if the equipment is delivered on the agreed-
upon date. Both vendors have also proposed they receive an incentive
for delivering early and absorb a penalty for delivering late, but the
amounts of the incentives and penalties differ.
Multiplying the base price plus the performance incentive for early
delivery by the probability of early delivery yields the expected value of
the price you pay if delivery is early. You can calculate the total
expected prices for Vendors A and B by totaling the expected prices if
each is early, on time, and late, respectively.
This analysis suggests that you can expect to pay Vendor A $45,000 and
have a 70 percent chance he’ll deliver on time or early. You can expect
to pay Vendor B $56,000 and have a 70 percent chance he’ll deliver on
time or early. It looks like Vendor A is the better choice!

 Risk assessment questionnaires: Formal data-collection instruments
that elicit expert opinion about the likelihood of different situations
occurring and their associated effects.
 Automated impact assessments: Computerized spreadsheets that con-
sider — in combination — the likelihood that different situations will
occur and the consequences if they do.
Managing Risk
Recognizing risks that pose a threat to your project is the first step toward
controlling them. You also, however, have to develop specific plans for
reducing their potential effect on your project.
This section helps you select the risks you’ll manage proactively, develop a
plan for addressing them, and share your plan with your project’s audiences.
Choosing the risks you want to manage
All identified risks affect your project in some way if they occur (after all,
that’s the definition of a risk). However, you may determine that anticipating
and averting the problems of a particular risk actually takes more time and
effort than just dealing with the problems, should they arise.
So, your first step in developing a risk-management strategy is to choose
those risks that you need to address proactively. When making this choice,
do the following:
 Consider the likelihood of a risk and its potential effect on your pro-
ject. If the effect of a risk would be great and if the chances it will occur
are high, you probably want to develop plans to manage it. If the effect is
low and the likelihood is low, you may decide not to worry about it.
When the effect would be high but the likelihood is low or vice versa,
consider the situation more carefully. A more formal approach for con-
sidering the combined effect of likelihood of occurrence and potential
consequence is to define the expected value of the risk, as follows:
Expected value of the risk = (quantitative measure of the effect if it
occurs) × (probability it will occur)
Suppose you need to buy certain materials for a device you’re planning
to build. When you place your order, you think you have an 80 percent
chance of receiving the materials by the date promised. However, this
means you have a 20 percent chance that something will go wrong and
161
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty

that you’ll have to pay a premium to get the materials from another
vendor by the date that you need them. You estimate that the materials
normally cost $1,000 and that you’ll have to pay an additional $500 to
get them from another vendor at the last minute. Determine the
expected value of this risk as follows:
Expected value of risk = Additional cost incurred if you use another
vendor at the last minute × probability that you’ll have to use this
vendor
Expected value of risk = $500 × .2 = $100
You may conclude that, all things being equal, spending more than $100
to reduce the chances of this risk isn’t a wise financial decision.
 Decide whether a potential consequence is so unacceptable that you’re
not willing to take the chance even if it’s very unlikely to occur.
Suppose your company wants to build a new plant in an area that has
been hit hard by hurricanes. The estimated cost of the new plant is
$50 million, and the likelihood that a hurricane will totally destroy the
building is 0.1 percent. The expected value of this risk is $50,000
($50,000,000 × 0.001), which the company can easily absorb. However,
if a hurricane actually destroys the building, the associated $50 million
loss would put the company out of business. So, even though the
expected value of the loss is relatively small, the company may feel
that even a 0.1 percent chance of being ruined is unacceptable.
If you choose to build the plant, be sure you develop a strategy to
manage the risk of the plant being totally destroyed (see the next sec-
tion). You may want to reconsider whether you want to undertake the
project at all.
Developing a risk-management strategy
You can take several different approaches to minimize the negative effects
risks can have on your project. However, if these approaches are to work, you
must choose your strategies and plan their implementation at the earliest
time possible in your project.
Choose one of the following approaches for dealing with the risks you decide
to manage:
 Minimize the chances they’ll occur. Take actions to reduce the chances
that an undesirable situation will come to pass. For example, consider
that you have a person on your project who’s new to your organization.
162
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Consequently, you feel the person may take longer to do her assigned
task than you planned. Consider following steps to reduce the chances
that the person will require more time:
• Explain the task and the desired results very clearly to the person
before she begins to work on it.
• Develop frequent milestones and monitor the person’s performance
often so you can deal with any problems as soon as they occur.
• Have her attend training to refresh the skills and knowledge she
needs to perform the assignment.
 Develop contingencies. Develop one or more alternative action plans in
the event an undesirable situation does come to pass. Suppose you plan
to have your organization’s publication department reproduce 100
copies of the manual for your training program. If you’re concerned that
the department may have higher-priority projects at the same time,
locate an external vendor that can reproduce the manuals if the need
arises. Finding the vendor beforehand can reduce any time delay result-
ing from the switch to another resource.
 Buy insurance. Pay a price to reduce the effect when an undesirable sit-
uation occurs. For example, suppose you need a piece of equipment on a
specific date. You may decide to order the same part from two different
vendors to increase the likelihood that at least one of the vendors will
deliver on time.
 Transfer the risk. Pay someone else to assume some or all of the effect
of the risk. Suppose you choose to proceed with your plans to build a
new $50,000,000 facility (see the example in the earlier section
“Choosing the risks you want to manage”). You can buy disaster insur-
ance on the facility so the company doesn’t have to assume the full
burden of a total loss if a hurricane destroys the facility.
Although the following approaches may sometimes seem appealing, they
don’t work:
 The ostrich approach: Ignore risks or pretend they don’t exist.
 The prayer approach: Look to a higher being to solve all your problems
or to make them disappear.
 The denial approach: Recognize that certain situations may cause
problems for your project, but refuse to accept that these situations
may occur.
Though it may require a bit of work upfront, proactively planning to manage
your project’s risks always pay dividends down the line.
163
Chapter 8: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty

Communicating about risks
People often share information about project risks ineffectually or not at all.
As a result, their projects suffer unnecessary problems and setbacks that
proper communication may have avoided.
You may be reluctant to deal with risk because the concept is hard to grasp.
If your project’s a one-time deal, what difference does a risk that occurs 40
times out of 100 make? You may also feel that focusing on risks suggests
you’re looking for excuses for failure rather than ways to succeed.
Communicate about project risks early and often. In particular, share infor-
mation with drivers and supporters at the following points in your project
(see Chapter 1):
 Conceive: To support the process of deciding whether or not to under-
take the project
 Define: To guide the development of all aspects of your project plan
 Start: To allow team members to discuss potential risks and to encour-
age them to recognize and address problems as soon as those problems
occur
 Perform: To update the likelihood that identified risks will occur, to 
reinforce how people can minimize the negative effect of project risks,
and to guide the assessment of change requests
You can improve your communications with your project’s drivers and sup-
porters by
 Explaining in detail the nature of a risk, how it may affect your project,
and how you estimated the likelihood of its occurrence.
 Telling people the current chances that certain risks will occur, how
you’re minimizing the chances of problems, and how they can reduce
the chances of negative consequences.
 Encouraging people to think and talk about risks, always with an eye
toward minimizing the negative effects of those risks.
 Documenting in writing all the information about the risk.
You can discuss this information at regularly scheduled team meetings; in
regularly scheduled progress reports and upper management reviews; and in
special meetings to address issues that arise. (See Chapter 13 for more on
sharing project information.)
164
Part II: Determining When and How Much 

Preparing a Risk-Management Plan
A risk-management plan lays out strategies to minimize the negative effects
that uncertain occurrences can have on your project. Develop your risk-
management plan in the define phase of your project, refine it in the start
phase, and continually update it during the perform phase (see Chapter 1 
for more on these phases). Include the following in your risk-management
plan:
 Risk factors
 Associated risks
 Your assessment of the likelihood of occurrence and the consequences
for each risk
 How you plan to manage selected risks
 How you plan to keep people informed about those risks throughout
your project

ronment in a project-oriented organization. I also suggest
ways to define team member roles, and I offer approaches
that encourage team members to maintain a supportive
environment. Finally, I describe how to start your project
off on the right foot.

n the traditional work environment, your supervisor assigned your work,
completed your performance appraisals, approved your salary increases,
and authorized your promotions. However, increasing numbers of organiza-
tions are moving toward a structure where a variety of people direct the work
assignments. The greatest advantage of this new structure? It supports faster
and more effective responses to the diverse projects in an organization.
Success in this new project-oriented organization requires you to
 Recognize the people who define and influence your work environment.
 Understand their unique roles.
 Know how to work effectively with them to create a successful project.
This chapter helps you define your organization’s environment and under-
stand everyone’s roles. I also provide ways to ensure your project’s success
by focusing on the matrix structure.
Defining the Organizational Environment
Over the years, projects have evolved from organizational afterthoughts to
major vehicles for conducting business and developing future capabilities.
Naturally, the approaches for organizing and managing projects have evolved
as well.

This section focuses on one organizational approach for handling projects,
the matrix, which is extensively used in organizations today. At the end of
the section, I discuss two additional organizational structures that are used
occasionally.
Matrix structure
With increasing frequency, projects today involve and affect many functional
areas within an organization. As a result, personnel in these different units
must work in concert to successfully address people’s individual and collec-
tive needs. The matrix structure facilitates the participation of people from
different areas of the organization in projects that need their expertise.
As Figure 9-1 illustrates, in a matrix structure people from different areas of
the organization are assigned to lead or work on projects. Project managers
guide the performance of project activities while people’s direct supervisors
perform administrative tasks (such as formally appraising people’s perfor-
mances and approving promotions, salary increases, or requests for leave).
Because an individual can be on a project for less than 100 percent of his
time, he may work on more than one project at a time.
A matrix environment is classified as weak, strong, or balanced, depending on
the amount of authority the project managers have over their teams.
 Weak matrix: Project managers have little if any direct authority over
team members and actually function as project coordinators rather than
managers.
 Strong matrix: Companies with a strong matrix structure choose project
managers for new projects from a pool of people whose only job is
to manage projects. These people are never asked to serve as a team

member. Often these people form a single organizational unit that
reports to a manager of project managers. In addition to directing and
guiding project work, these project managers have certain administra-
tive authority over the team members, such as the right to participate in
their performance appraisals.
 Balanced matrix: This environment is a blend of the weak and strong
environments. People are assigned to lead a project or serve as a team
member based on the project’s needs and not their job descriptions.
Although the project manager may have some administrative authority
over team members (such as approving leave requests), for the most
part he guides, coordinates, and facilitates the project.
Advantages of a matrix structure
A matrix environment offers many benefits, including the following:
 Teams can assemble rapidly. Because you have a larger resource pool
from which to choose your project team, you don’t have to wait for a few
people to finish current assignments before they can start on your pro-
ject. Additionally, this approach reduces the time-consuming process of
hiring someone from the outside.
 Scarce expertise can be available for several different projects.
Projects often require a small amount of effort from a person with highly
specialized knowledge or skills. If your project can’t support this person
full time, several projects may be able to support her part time.
 Getting buy-in from team members’ functional units is easier. Unit per-
sonnel who work on a project or are affected by its outcome are more
likely to support the project if they’re confident that the team hears
their concerns and issues.
Disadvantages of a matrix structure
However, a matrix environment also introduces challenges that the project
manager must successfully address:
 Team members working on multiple projects respond to two or
more managers. Each team member has at least two people giving her
direction — a project manager (who coordinates project work and team
support) and a functional manager (who coordinates the member’s pro-
ject assignments, completes her performance appraisal, and approves
requests for leave). When these two managers are at similar levels in the
organization, resolving conflicting demands for the member’s time can be
difficult.
 Team members may not be familiar with each other’s styles and
knowledge. Because team members may not have worked extensively
together, they may require some time to become comfortable with each
other’s work styles and behaviors.
171
Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project

 Team members may focus more on their individual assignments and
less on the project and its goals. For example, a procurement specialist
may be responsible for buying equipment and supplies for all of her pro-
jects. In such a case, the specialist may be less concerned about a pro-
ject’s target date for the purchases and more concerned about correctly
following her department’s procurement procedures.
Other structures
Although organizations use the matrix structure (see the previous section)
extensively today, two other structures are available for handling projects.
Both structures offer benefits, but they’re less flexible than the matrix and
less able to readily accommodate the variety of people and skills typically
required on projects today.
Centralized structure
The centralized structure (see Figure 9-2) is also called the traditional or fixed-
group structure because the specialty units are established parts of the orga-
nization. In this structure, specialty units (such as human resources, training,
and information systems) perform all projects in their specialty areas.
In the centralized structure, each unit reports to a manager at the corporate
level, and all specialty service requests are submitted to the appropriate spe-
cialty unit. For example, if the manufacturing group needs a new production-
control system, they ask the information systems unit to develop it. The major
difference between centralized and matrix structures is that the matrix allows
people to work on multiple projects managed by different people from differ-
ent parts of the organization; the centralized structure gives the head of the
specialty unit ultimate administrative and project control over all projects.
Note: You may have specialty units in areas such as
information systems, training, and human resources

Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Advantages of the centralized structure
Working on projects within this structure offers certain benefits:
 Consistent criteria guide project selection. A specialty unit’s manager
receives all project requests. The manager then chooses which projects
to perform based on their expected benefits to the overall organization,
staff availability, and his group’s priorities (such as impact on other pro-
jects and his group’s focus).
 People can mesh into an effectively performing team more quickly.
The people in the unit start out knowing each other’s skills, knowledge,
and operating styles as a result of working together on previous projects.
They also come to know which people live up to their commitments.
 Priorities can be set and conflicts can be resolved more easily. The
specialty unit’s manager makes or approves all personnel assignments
for his unit’s projects. Therefore, he also decides how to resolve conflict-
ing demands for a unit member’s time.
 Clear lines of authority more strongly encourage people to honor
their commitments. The specialty unit manager reviews and approves
her staff’s performance appraisals. Therefore, she can easily ensure that
a unit member’s performance appraisal reflects his project performance.
Disadvantages of the centralized structure
However, working in a centralized structure also presents challenges.
 Project review and approval is often slow. Units throughout the organi-
zation compete against each other for the services of a specialty unit
that has a fixed number of staff.
 Specialty-unit members may not be familiar with the special processes
and characteristics of areas that request the unit’s services. As an
example, a person from an information-services unit who must develop
a repair-parts inventory-control system may have extensive experience
developing inventory-control systems but little or no experience with
the procedures and operating practices of the repair-parts operation in
the organization.
 Individual members of the specialty unit often have more work than
they can handle or not enough work to keep them busy. People in spe-
cialty units only work on projects performed by their units. Unfortunately,
project requests don’t always come in a smooth stream, and the skills and
knowledge required for the requests may not match those of the people
available. As a result, even though members may average 100 percent of
their available time working on assignments, they vary between working
overtime to finish an assignment and sitting around with nothing to do.
173
Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project

Functional structure
Unlike the centralized structure (see the previous section) that has specialty
units that provide a particular type of support to the entire organization, the
functional structure has multiple units that provide the same specialized sup-
port to the organization’s different functional groups, as illustrated in Figure
9-3. For example, separate information-services units may support sales,
operations, and administration, respectively. Each specialty unit only per-
forms projects for its functional group.
Advantages of the functional structure
The functional structure is a fixed-group structure because the specialty
units are permanent parts of their functional groups. As such, the functional
structure offers many of the same advantages of the centralized structure. In
addition, the functional structure has these pluses:
 People in the specialty unit have a better understanding of the func-
tional area that they support. Because each specialty unit only
addresses the needs of one functional group, unit members are techni-
cally proficient in the unit’s area of expertise and experienced in the
functional group’s operations.
 Functional groups have less competition for their specialty units’ sup-
port. A specialty unit addresses only the needs of its functional group.
This limited demand reduces the competition and tension that arise
when groups compete for scarce resources.

Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Disadvantages of the functional structure
However, the functional structure also has the following drawbacks:
 Specialty unit members may have difficulty getting buy-in and sup-
port for their project from other functional groups that must support
or will be affected by the project. Each functional group can initiate a
project without consulting other functional groups. As a result, people in
these other areas may be reluctant to support such a project because it
doesn’t address their needs most effectively. They may also be reluctant
to support it because the project may be competing with projects from
their own functional group for scarce resources.
 Making major investments to support a specific specialty unit’s techni-
cal work is more difficult. Suppose your organization’s sales and
marketing group and operations group both have a publications unit.
Furthermore, suppose both units want to buy a new document printer
and sorter that costs $100,000. Both groups have $75,000 in their bud-
gets for such a machine, and each group has enough work to keep the
machine busy about 60 percent of the time. But neither group has suffi-
cient workload to justify the purchase or sufficient funds to make the
purchase. However, the two units together have sufficient needs and
sufficient funds to buy one machine.
 Chances increase for overlap or duplication among projects in the
same specialty area for different functional groups. Specialty units
providing the same type of support to different functional groups in the
organization are under no obligation to tell each other about their indi-
vidual work activities. As a result, different groups may perform similar
or overlapping projects. In fact, one group may undertake a project simi-
lar to one being performed by another unit just to retain technical and
administrative control of the work. Unfortunately, this power play often
results in duplicate or wasted effort.
Recognizing the Key Players
in a Matrix Environment
The matrix structure encourages people from different parts of the organiza-
tion to bring their expertise to projects. However, working in a matrix requires
the project manager to deal with the styles, interests, and demands of more
people who have some degree of control over their project’s resources, goals,
and objectives.
175
Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project

In a matrix environment, the following people play critical roles in every pro-
ject’s success:
 Project manager: The person ultimately responsible for the successful
completion of the project.
 Project team members: People responsible for successfully performing
individual project activities.
 Functional managers: The team members’ direct-line supervisors.
 Upper management: People in charge of the organization’s major busi-
ness units.
This section discusses how each of these people can help your project to
succeed.
Project manager
If you’re the project manager, you’re responsible for all aspects of the project.
(See Chapter 10 for definitions of authority, responsibility, and accountabil-
ity.) Being responsible doesn’t mean you have to do the whole project your-
self, but you do have to see that every activity gets done satisfactorily. In this
role, you’re specifically responsible for the following:
 Determining objectives, schedule, and resource budgets
 Ensuring you have a clear, feasible project plan to reach your perfor-
mance targets
 Identifying and managing project risks
 Creating and sustaining a well-organized, focused, and committed team
 Selecting or creating your team’s operating practices and procedures
 Accomplishing objectives within time and budget targets
 Monitoring performance against plans and dealing with any problems
that arise
 Resolving priority, work approach, or interpersonal conflicts
 Controlling project changes
 Reporting on project activities
 Keeping your clients informed and committed
 Contributing to your team members’ performance appraisals
176
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

On occasion, you may hear people use the terms project director and project
leader, both of which sound similar to project manager. Check with your
organization, but usually manager and director describe the same position.
Project leader, however, is a different story. People often think of management
as focusing on issues and leadership as focusing on people; management also
deals with established procedures and leadership deals with change.
Therefore, calling someone a project leader emphasizes her responsibility to
focus and energize the people supporting the project, as opposed to the
more technical tasks of planning and controlling.
But again, check with your organization to be sure the term leader is meant to
convey this message. (Often project leader is just another term for project
manager — go figure!)
Project team members
Project team members must satisfy the requests of both their functional man-
agers and their project manager. Team-member responsibilities related to
project assignments include the following:
 Performing tasks in accordance with the highest standards of technical
excellence in your field
 Performing assignments on time and within budget
 Maintaining the special skills and knowledge to do the work
In addition, you’re responsible for working with and supporting your team
members’ project efforts. Such help may entail the following:
 Considering the effect your actions may have on your team members’
tasks
 Identifying situations and problems that may affect team members’ tasks
 Keeping your team members informed of your progress, accomplish-
ments, and any problems you encounter
Functional managers
Functional managers are responsible for orchestrating their staff’s assign-
ments among different projects. In addition they provide the necessary
177
Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project

resources for their staff to perform their work in accordance with the highest
standards of technical excellence. Specifically, functional managers are
responsible for the following:
 Developing or approving plans that specify the type, timing, and amount
of resources to perform tasks in their area of specialty
 Ensuring team members are available to perform their assigned tasks for
the promised amount of time
 Providing technical expertise and guidance to help team members solve
problems related to their project assignments
 Actually providing the equipment and facilities for a person to do
his work
 Helping people maintain their technical skills and knowledge
 Ensuring members of the functional group use consistent methodologi-
cal approaches on all their projects
 Completing team members’ performance appraisals
 Recognizing performance with salary increases, promotions, and job
assignments
 Approving team members’ requests for annual leave, administrative
leave, training, and other activities that take time away from the job
Upper management
Upper management creates the organizational environment; oversees the
development and use of operating policies, procedures, and practices; and
encourages and funds the development of required information systems.
More specifically, upper management is responsible for the following:
 Creating the organizational mission and goals that provide the frame-
work for selecting projects
 Setting policies and procedures for addressing priorities and conflicts
 Creating and maintaining labor and financial information systems
 Providing facilities and equipment to support project work
 Defining the limits of managers’ decision-making authority

Working Successfully in 
a Matrix Environment
Achieving success in a matrix environment requires that you align and coor-
dinate the people who support your project, deflecting any forces that pull
those people in different directions. This section can help you get the highest-
quality work from your team members along with timely and effective support
from the functional and senior managers.
The following tips can help you be successful in a matrix environment:
 Create and continually reinforce a team identity. Committing to work
with others to achieve a common goal encourages people to overcome
problems they may encounter along the way.
• Clarify team vision and working relationships. As soon as you
have a team, work with the members to develop a project mission
that members can understand and support. Give people an oppor-
tunity to become familiar with each other’s work styles.
• Define team procedures. Encourage your team to develop its own
work procedures instead of allowing people to use the approaches
of their respective functional groups.
• Clarify each person’s authority. Team members may have to rep-
resent their functional areas when making project decisions.
Clarify each team member’s level of independent authority to make
such decisions and determine who outside the team can make any
decisions that are beyond the purview of the team member.
• Be aware of and attend to your team’s functioning. Help people
establish comfortable and productive interpersonal relationships.
Continue to support these relationships throughout your project.
• Be sure one person is assigned the role of project manager —
with overall coordinative responsibilities. The project manager
continually reminds team members of the overarching project
goals and focuses their attention on how they influence and affect
each other’s work.
 Get team-member commitment. Team members typically have little or
no authority over each other in a matrix environment. Therefore, they
perform their project assignments because they choose to, not because
they must. Work with people initially and throughout your project to
encourage them to commit to your project’s goals (see Chapter 14 for
more on how to encourage team member buy-in).
179
Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project

 Elicit support from other people in the environment.
• Get a champion. Because you most likely don’t have authority
over all the people who affect the chances for your project’s suc-
cess, get an ally who does have that authority as soon as possible.
This project champion can resolve team members’ schedule and
interpersonal conflicts and raise your project’s visibility in the
organization. (See Chapter 3 for more on the project champion and
how to get one for your project.)
• Ask for and acknowledge your team members’ functional man-
agers’ support. By thanking functional managers for supporting
their staff and allowing the staff to honor their project commitments,
you are encouraging those managers to provide similar support for
you and others in the future.
 Develop procedures in advance that address the more common prob-
lems likely to arise during your project.
• Plan in sufficient detail. Work with team members to define
clearly and concisely the project work and each person’s specific
roles and responsibilities for all activities. This planning helps
people more accurately estimate their amount of effort and the
timing of that effort for each assignment.
• Identify and address conflicts promptly. Conflicts frequently arise
in a matrix environment, given people’s diverse responsibilities,
different styles, and lack of experience working together. Encourage
people to identify and discuss conflicts as soon as they occur.
Develop systems and procedures to deal with conflicts promptly —
before they get out of hand.
• Encourage open communication among team members, especially
regarding problems and frustrations. The earlier you hear about
problems, the more time you have to deal with them. Discussing and
resolving team issues encourages working relationships that are
more enjoyable and productive.
• Encourage upper management to establish an oversight committee
to monitor project performance and address resource and other
conflicts. Project and functional managers must focus on the goals
for their respective areas of responsibility. Often, both groups rely
on the same pool of people to reach these goals. But these diverse
needs can place conflicting demands on people’s time and effort. An
upper-management oversight committee can ensure that the needs
of the entire organization are considered when addressing these
conflicts.

Defining Team Members’ Roles
and Responsibilities
In This Chapter
 Characterizing authority, responsibility, and accountability
 Making key assignments
 Developing and using a Linear Responsibility Chart
 Handling micromanagement
Your project team typically includes people with different skill sets and
operating styles who work in different parts of the organization. You
may not have worked extensively with these people before. In addition, your
project usually has a tight time schedule, and team members most likely are
working on several other projects at the same time.
Success in this environment requires that you all agree how to work with
each other to maximize contributions and minimize wasted time and mis-
takes. The team needs an approach that gives everyone confidence that
members will live up to their commitments. The team leader and every team
member must understand and be comfortable with the planned roles.
This chapter explains different degrees of team-member task involvement,
how to make key assignments, how to encourage people to keep their
promises, how to present an overall picture of team members’ roles and
responsibilities, and how to handle a micromanager.
Understanding the Key Concepts
A typical project activity entails performing specific pieces of work, making
decisions, and coordinating the activities of others. To accomplish the activ-
ity with a minimum of time and resources, each piece of work must be done

in the correct order and each person must work at peak efficiency, being sure
not to repeat or duplicate unnecessarily work that others have done. The
more complex the task and the greater the number of people working on it,
the more difficult it is to ensure people don’t step on each other’s toes along
the way.
As a first step in coordinating people’s efforts, this section defines three dif-
ferent roles that team members can play when working on a project activity
and their similarities and differences.
Distinguishing authority, responsibility,
and accountability
The following concepts can help you define and clarify how team members
should relate to each other and to their assigned tasks:
 Authority: The ability to make binding decisions about your project’s
products, schedule, resources, and activities. Examples include your
ability to sign purchase orders not to exceed $3,000 and your ability to
change a scheduled date by no more than two weeks.
 Responsibility: The commitment to achieve specific results. An example
is your promise to have a draft report ready by March 1.
 Accountability: Bringing consequences to bear in response to people’s
performance. An example: Your boss notes in your annual performance
appraisal that you solved a difficult manufacturing problem.
Unfortunately, many people think accountability means paying the price
when you foul up. This fear often causes people to avoid situations
where they’ll be accountable for their performance. Paying a price when
you foul up is certainly half of the concept, but the other half is being
rewarded for doing a good job. This positive reinforcement is far more
effective than negative reinforcement to encourage high-quality results.
Although these three terms are related, each term is a distinct and necessary
element for defining and reinforcing team roles.
Comparing authority and responsibility
Authority and responsibility are similar, yet different. Both authority and
responsibility are upfront agreements. Before you start your project, you
agree who can make which decisions and who will ensure particular results.
182
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

However, authority focuses on process, while responsibility focuses on out-
comes. Authority defines the decisions you can make but does not mention
the results you have to achieve. Responsibility addresses the results you
must accomplish with no mention of the decisions you can make to reach
those results. Remember, too, that you can transfer the authority to make
decisions to another person, but you can’t transfer the responsibility for the
results of those decisions. (For more about delegating authority and sharing
responsibility, check out the next section.)
Suppose you have the authority to issue purchase orders up to $5,000 for
your project. Assume no policy or instructions specifically prevent you from
giving some or all of this authority to someone else, so you give Matt author-
ity to sign purchase orders for your project not to exceed $4,000. However, if
Matt mistakenly issues a $3,000 purchase order for ten reams of specialty
paper instead of a $1,500 purchase order for the five reams that he really
needs, you’re still responsible for his error.
You can always take back authority that you gave to someone else, but you
can’t blame the person for exercising that authority while he has it.
Making Project Assignments: Everything
You Need to Know (And More)
Effectively eliciting the help and support of others in the work you do is
essential to get the most out of all team members. This section focuses
specifically on what you need to know about defining project roles, including
deciding what can and can’t be delegated, assigning roles with confidence,
sharing responsibility, and keeping everyone accountable.
Deciding what to delegate
Delegating is giving away something you have. (I know other definitions of
delegating exist, but to keep it simple: to delegate is to give away.)
You can delegate authority, but you can only share responsibility. You can
completely transfer your decision-making power to someone else so he can
make the decisions with no or involvement or approval from you. However,
when another person agrees to assume a responsibility of yours, you’re still
obligated to ensure that he achieves the desired results.
183
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

You delegate for three reasons:
 To free yourself up to do other tasks
 To have the most qualified person make decisions
 To develop another person’s ability to handle additional assignments
prudently and successfully
Although the potential benefits of delegating can be significant, not every
task can or should be delegated. Consider the following guidelines when
deciding which tasks are appropriate candidates:
 Assign yourself to the tasks that you do best. Suppose you’re the best
lawyer in town and there is more demand for your services at a fee of
$500 per hour than you can meet. Suppose also that you can type twice
as fast as the next fastest typist in town, who charges $200 per hour.
Should you type all of your own legal briefs? The answer is no. Your
choice is whether to spend an hour providing legal services or typing. If
you spent your hour typing, you would save the $400 you would have to
pay the typist (who would require two hours at a cost of $200 per hour
to do the same work). However, if you spent the same one hour provid-
ing legal services, you’d earn $500, which would allow you to pay the
typist $400 for the work and still have $100 left over. (This is referred to
as the Law of Comparative Advantage.)
 If possible, assign yourself to tasks that aren’t on a project’s critical
path. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of critical path.) If any activity on a
project critical path is delayed, it will push back the estimated date for
project completion. Therefore, if you have to stop working on a critical
path task to deal with problems on a task that’s not critical, you’ll imme-
diately delay the entire project.
 Don’t assign other people to work on a task that you can’t clearly
describe yourself. The time you save by not working on the task will be
more than offset by the time you’ll spend answering questions and con-
tinually redirecting the person.
Delegation doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition, where you either
make all decisions yourself or you withdraw from the situation entirely.
Consider the following six degrees of delegation, each of which builds on and
extends the ones that come before it:
 Get in the know. Get the facts and bring them to me for further action.
 Show me the way to go. Develop alternative actions to take based on
the facts you’ve found.
184
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

 Go when I say so. Be prepared to take one or more of the actions you
have proposed, but don’t do anything until I say so.
 Go unless I say no. Tell me what you propose to do and when; take your
recommended actions unless I tell you otherwise.
 How’d it go? Analyze the situation, develop a course of action, take
action, and let me know the results.
 Just go! Here’s a situation; deal with it.
Each level entails some degree of independent authority. As manager, when I
ask you to find the facts about a situation, you choose what information
sources to consult, which information to share with me, and which to dis-
card. The primary difference between the levels is the degree of checking
with the manager before taking action.
Supporting your delegations of authority
You must actively reinforce and support your delegations of authority or you
can suddenly find yourself doing the task that you thought you had assigned
to someone else.
Suppose you’ve been a manager of a project for the past two months and
Mary has been your assistant. Mary has been dealing with people’s technical
issues. When someone runs into a technical problem, he discusses it with
Mary. She analyzes the problem and decides how to address it. She then dis-
cusses it with you and explains her proposed solution. If you agree with her
solution, you ask her to implement it. If you don’t agree with Mary’s sugges-
tion, you work with her to develop a more acceptable approach.
Yesterday, you told Mary that you want to change the way she deals with
technical issues. You explain that, from now on, she doesn’t have to pass her
proposed solutions by you before implementing them. After discussing this
with her, you told the other team members about the new procedure.
This morning, Joe came to Mary to discuss a problem he was having with a
contractor. After listening to the problem, Mary gave Joe very specific
instructions for how to deal with it. As soon as Joe left Mary’s office, how-
ever, he called you on the phone. He recounted the problem he had dis-
cussed with Mary and her proposed solution, and he asked you whether you
agreed with the approach Mary had recommended.
You now have a dilemma. On the one hand, you want to support Mary’s
newly delegated authority. On the other hand, you want to ensure that your
project goes smoothly and successfully. What should you do?
185
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

The only response you can make to Joe that will support your delegation of
authority to Mary is “Do whatever Mary told you to do.”
What if you responded to Joe, “Yes, Mary’s solution sounds good to me”?
That answer won’t work. By declaring that you like Mary’s solution, you
undercut Mary’s authority to make the decision on her own! Perhaps you just
wanted to tell Joe that you had full confidence in Mary’s ability to develop an
appropriate solution and that the one she proposed was an example of her
good judgment. However, in reality, your response suggests to Joe that you
are still in the approval process because you just gave your approval to
Mary’s decision rather than her authority.
You want to support your delegation, but you also want to ensure your pro-
ject’s success. So how do you deal with the following situations?
 You don’t agree with Mary’s recommendation. If you fear that following
Mary’s recommendation will have catastrophic consequences, you must
suggest to Joe that he wait until you can discuss the issue with Mary. In
this instance, protecting your project and your organization is more
important than supporting your delegation of authority.
In all other instances, though, you should tell Joe to follow Mary’s sug-
gestion because she has the authority to make that decision. Here are
several reasons to do so, even if you don’t agree with her choice:
• She may know more about the situation than Joe told you.
• Maybe she’s right and you’re wrong.
• Suppose your approach is better than Mary’s. How will she make
better choices in the future if you don’t explain why you disagree
with her decision?
• If Mary believes that you’ll jump in to save her every time she
makes a bad decision, she’ll be less concerned about making the
correct decision the first time.
You can always ask Mary later to explain privately the rationale for her
decision, and you can offer your thoughts and opinions when you feel
they’re necessary.
 Joe’s call indicates a more general problem with the team’s proce-
dures and working relationships.
• Perhaps you weren’t clear when you explained the new working
procedures with Mary to your team member. Explain and reinforce
the new procedures to Joe.
• Perhaps Joe didn’t like Mary’s answer and is trying to go behind
her back to get his way. Again, you must reinforce that the decision
is Mary’s to make.
186
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

• Perhaps Mary wasn’t clear enough in her recommendation to Joe.
Suggest to Mary that she explain the reasons behind her solutions
more clearly and that she probe to make sure people understand
and are comfortable with the information she shares.
• Perhaps some interpersonal conflict exists between Joe and Mary.
Talk with both of them to determine whether such a conflict exists
and, if it does, how it came about. Work with Joe and Mary to help
them address and resolve the conflict.
Delegating to achieve results
Delegation always involves some risk — you have to live with the conse-
quences of someone else’s decisions. However, you can take the following
steps to increase your comfort level and thereby improve the person’s
chances for successful performance:
1. Clarify what you want to delegate.
Describe in unambiguous terms the work you want the other person to
perform and the results you want him to achieve. If necessary, also
explain what you don’t want the person to do.
2. Choose the right person.
Determine the skills and knowledge you feel a person must have to per-
form the task successfully, and don’t delegate the task to a person who
lacks these skills and knowledge. (See Chapter 6 for more on describing
the skills and knowledge people need to do a job.)
3. Make the delegation correctly.
Explain the work to be done, how much effort you expect the person to
expend, and the date she should have the work completed. Put this
information in writing for clarity and future reference.
4. Be available to answer questions.
Maintaining contact while the person performs the task allows you to
ensure that any ambiguities and unexpected situations encountered are
resolved to your satisfaction. It also conveys to the person that the task
is important to you.
5. Monitor performance.
Set up frequent, well-defined checkpoints at which you can monitor per-
formance. Then keep that schedule.
187
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

Sharing responsibility
The decision to delegate authority is unilateral; it doesn’t require the agree-
ment of both parties. You can choose to give someone the authority to make
a decision whether or not he wants it. After you give your authority to
another person, he is free to pass it on to someone else (if you haven’t specif-
ically told him not to).
Responsibility, however, is a two-way agreement. You ask me to respond to a
customer inquiry, and I agree that I will. Because you and I agree that I will
handle the inquiry, I can’t decide to give the assignment to someone else and
then not worry about whether he will handle it. I committed to you that the
inquiry would be addressed; the only way I can free myself from this respon-
sibility is to ask you to agree to change our original understanding.
Suppose Alice, your boss, asks you to prepare a report highlighting the latest
sales figures for your organization. You figure that you can prepare the text of
the report in Microsoft Word and any necessary graphics in Microsoft
PowerPoint. You know where to get the raw sales data, and you know how to
use Word, but you don’t know how to use PowerPoint. However, Bill, a
member of your staff, does know how to use PowerPoint. So you accept
Alice’s assignment, figuring that you can ask Bill to prepare any graphics.
When you ask Bill whether he’ll help you, he says that he will.
A week later, Alice asks how you’re doing on the report. You tell her that
you’ve completed the text, but Bill hasn’t finished the graphics. You suggest
that she check with Bill to find out how he’s doing and when he’ll be finished.
How do you think Alice will respond to your suggestion?
After a moment’s silence, Alice reminds you that you agreed to prepare the
report and, therefore, ensuring that all parts of the work are complete is your
responsibility, not hers. In other words, because you accepted the responsi-
bility for completing the report, you can’t choose unilaterally to give away
part of that responsibility to someone else.
By the way, Alice was correct in refusing to deal directly with Bill for a couple
of other reasons:
 If Alice had agreed to check directly with Bill, she would have been
doing you a disservice. She would have tacitly been telling Bill that
whenever you give him assignments in the future, he should be con-
cerned about satisfying her rather than you. In other words, she would
have undermined your leadership position.
 It would have been difficult for Alice to follow up with Bill, even if she
had wanted to, because she didn’t know exactly what you asked him to
do or when you asked him to have it done.
188
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

The only way you can relieve yourself of some or all of the responsibility you
accepted is to ask Alice whether she will agree to a revised plan.
Holding people accountable when they
don’t report to you
People who make promises, fail to keep their promises, and then suffer no
consequences create some of the worst frustrations in a project environment.
Encourage reliable performance by observing the following guidelines:
 If you’re responsible, you should be held accountable. In other words,
if you make a promise, you should always experience consequences
based on how well you honor your promise.
 If you’re not responsible, you shouldn’t be held accountable. When
something goes wrong but you weren’t responsible for ensuring that it
was handled correctly, you shouldn’t face negative consequences. (Of
course, you shouldn’t receive positive accolades when it goes well.)
Holding people accountable when they aren’t responsible is called
scapegoating. When you assign blame to the closest person, you only
encourage people to avoid dealing with you in the future.
However, when a person who doesn’t report to you administratively
promises to do something for you, holding her accountable can be a 
touchy issue. You may not try to hold her accountable because you think 
it’s inappropriate (after all, you’re not her boss) or because you don’t know
how. But remember: Holding people accountable is appropriate and necessary
when they’ve accepted a responsibility. Accountability helps people know
that they’re on the right track, and it enables you to formally acknowledge
when they have completed the promised assignments. You don’t need
authority to hold people accountable; they just must accept the responsibility.
Use the following approaches to hold people accountable when you have no
direct authority over them:
 Find out who does have direct authority over the person and bring
that supervisor into the process. Consider soliciting the approval of the
person’s boss. When you do this correctly and at the right time, you can
improve the chances for success. If a person’s boss is unaware that his
staffer agreed to perform a task for you, your chances of getting the
boss’s help when the person fails to perform as promised are small.
However, if the boss supported his staffer’s offer to help you when it was
made, neither the boss nor his staffer should be surprised if you solicit
the boss’s help when the staffer doesn’t do the task.
189
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

 Put it in writing. Have you ever noticed how strangely people react
when you put an informal agreement in writing? All of a sudden, they act
as if you don’t trust them. Put your agreement in writing to formalize it,
to clarify the terms, and to serve as a reminder. If they ask, explain that
writing the agreement has nothing to do with lack of trust. If you didn’t
trust them, you wouldn’t work with them at all!
 Be specific. The clearer you make your request, the easier it is for the
person to estimate the effort she needs to respond to the request and to
produce the right result the first time.
You may be uncomfortable being too specific because you feel that
giving the person orders is inappropriate (after all, you have no direct
authority over her). But your specifics make the task easier to perform.
 Follow up. Negotiate a schedule to monitor the person’s performance
and to address any issues or questions that arise. Be sure to
• Negotiate a follow-up schedule at the outset. If you call unan-
nounced at random times, you appear to be checking up because
you don’t trust the person.
• Base your follow-up schedule on when the person plans to achieve
certain intermediate milestones; this timeline gives you more
objective criteria for an assessment.
 Make the person accountable to the team. Your most valuable profes-
sional asset is your reputation. When a person promises to do some-
thing for you, let others on your team know about the promise. When
the person lives up to that promise, acknowledge it in front of her col-
leagues. If the person fails to live up to the promise, let her know that
you’ll share that information with others too.
 Get commitment. When a person indicates that she will help you out, be
sure to get a firm, specific commitment that the desired result will be
achieved by a specific time and for a specific cost. Beware of declara-
tions like “I’ll give it my best effort” or “You can count on me.”
 Create a sense of urgency and importance. You may want to minimize
any pressure the person feels by offering to understand if she can’t per-
form to your expectations because of one reason or another.
Unfortunately, this approach suggests that the work you’re asking her to
do isn’t really that important and actually increases the chance that she
won’t complete it. Instead, let the person know how her work influences
other activities and people on the project. Let her know why she needs
to perform to expectations and what the consequences will be — to the
project and the organization — if she isn’t successful.
Check out the sidebar “Hold the line when he drops the ball” in this chapter
for a good example of holding someone accountable when he isn’t your
direct report.

Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Illustrating Relationships with 
a Linear Responsibility Chart
Defining and sharing team roles and responsibilities upfront can improve per-
formance and help to identify and head off potential difficulties during a pro-
ject. You can display team roles and responsibilities in a Linear
Responsibility Chart (LRC) (see Figure 10-1).
The LRC is a matrix that depicts each project audience’s (see Chapter 3) role
in the performance of different project activities. As Figure 10-1 illustrates:
 Project activities are in the left-hand column.
 Project audiences are in the top row.
 The role of each audience with respect to each activity is in the intersec-
tions of the rows and columns.
Figure 10-1 illustrates a portion of the LRC for designing and conducting a
customer needs survey. This chart defines three ways people can participate
in project activities:
 Primary responsibility (P): You’ve committed to ensure the results are
achieved.
 Secondary responsibility (S): You’ve committed to ensure some portion
of the results is achieved.
 Approval (A): You’re not actually working on the activity, but you
approve what others have done.

Part III: Putting Your Team Together 
Hold the line when he drops the ball
Suppose you recently began working on a pro-
ject to develop and implement an upgraded
inventory control system. You just found out that
your friend Eric had been working on this pro-
ject until a month ago, so you call him to discuss
his experiences.
After a few minutes, you ask him whether he’ll
do you a favor. You explain that you and three
other team members are developing a users’
manual for the new system. You ask him
whether, in view of his extensive knowledge of
this project’s history, he’d be willing to write a
draft of Chapter 1 of that manual on the system’s
history and development. Today is Monday, and
you explain you need the draft by a week from
Friday. Eric agrees, and you both hang up.
Unfortunately, you never receive the draft of
Chapter 1 from Eric. He never calls you to
explain why he didn’t submit the draft, and you
never check with him to see what’s happening.
Does this situation sound familiar? You probably
make and receive requests like this several times
each day. Unfortunately, too many times people
promise to help you out but don’t deliver. What
can you do? The answer is you must find ways
to hold people accountable when they make an
agreement to complete an assignment for you.
Of course, you can only hold people account-
able if they accept a responsibility in the first
place. Therefore, in our illustration, the first
question is: After your phone call, did Eric
assume the responsibility to write a draft of
Chapter 1 for you and your colleagues?
Very simply, the answer is yes. Why? Because he
said he would. I’m not suggesting that Eric is
responsible for preparing the draft of Chapter 1
and that you and your colleagues are off the hook.
Your responsibility to prepare the users’ manual
hasn’t changed, but Eric did accept the responsi-
bility to prepare this draft for you. Whether Eric
no longer works on the project or that he doesn’t
report to your boss isn’t the question. He’s
responsible because he said he would be.
Eric may argue that he has a personal obliga-
tion to complete the draft (because he said he
would) but no organizational obligation because
the agreement wasn’t in writing and he wasn’t
formally on your project team. That argument
doesn’t hold up. Personal and organizational
commitments are the same. If he didn’t want to
accept the obligation, he only had to say no.
The second question is: Did you hold Eric
accountable for his failure to keep his promise?
The answer is no. You did nothing in response
to his failure to deliver a draft of Chapter 1.
If the reason you didn’t receive the draft is
because Eric never sent it, what messages does
your behavior (or, in this case, your lack of
behavior) send to Eric?
 The assignment wasn’t that important.
What a terrible message! You asked Eric to
take time from his busy day to do something
for you, and you didn’t even care whether
he completed the task? He’s probably happy
that he decided not to spend time on the
task because apparently it wouldn’t have
made any difference anyway.
 Eric’s behavior was okay. This message is
even worse! It confirms that making
promises and then not performing and not
even explaining your reason for not per-
forming is okay. Situations may have arisen
that made it impossible for Eric to honor the
commitment, but does that justify not calling
to tell you about the situation? Unfortunately,
this type of behavior, multiplied many times
every day, defines an organizational envi-
ronment where promises mean little and
breaking them becomes an accepted part of
business as usual.

The LRC is just a format; for each project, you define and assign the roles you
feel are appropriate. You may, for example, decide to use the following roles
in addition to the three already defined:
 Review (R): You review and comment on the results of an activity, but
your formal approval is not required.
 Output (O): You receive products from the activity.
 Input (I): You provide input for the activity work.
This section helps you read an LRC, develop your own chart, and improve
your chart to meet your own needs. Your only limit is your creativity!
Reading an LRC
To illustrate how you read the LRC, consider the activity Design questionnaire
in Figure 10-1. The chart suggests that three people work together on this
activity as follows:
 Staffer A has primary responsibility for the questionnaire’s content,
format, and layout. On this project, Staffer A reports to the task leader
who, in turn, reports to the project manager.
193
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
Most likely, these messages aren’t the ones you
intended to convey. You probably figured that
Eric was busy, and you didn’t want to make a big
deal because he agreed to go out of his way to
help you. Unfortunately, he can’t know what’s in
your mind because you didn’t tell him.
Maybe he didn’t ignore his promise to prepare
the draft. Consider some other possibilities:
 He sent you the draft but it got lost in the
delivery system. Unfortunately, most people
figure that no news is good news. When Eric
didn’t get a call from you, he probably
assumed that you’d received the draft and
found it acceptable. Certainly, he reasoned,
you would’ve called if you had any questions!
 He misunderstood you initially; he thought
you needed the draft by a month (rather
than a week) from Friday. Maybe he’s still
working on the draft and plans to give it to
you on the date he thought you needed it.
Accountability is a management control
process. Responding to a person’s actions lets
the person know whether he’s on target or
whether he needs to make a correction. Not
responding to unacceptable performance
unfortunately increases the likelihood that it will
occur again.

 The task leader performs selected parts of the questionnaire design
under the general coordination of Staffer A. The task leader must
approve all aspects of the questionnaire design before work can proceed
to the next step.
 The project manager must approve the entire questionnaire, even
though she isn’t doing any of the actual design and layout herself.
Analyze this chart vertically by audience and horizontally by activity for situ-
ations that may give rise to problems. After you identify these situations, you
can decide how to address them. Table 10-1 notes some observations about
the assignments displayed in Figure 10-1 and issues they may suggest.

194
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

After you identify a potential issue, you can choose how to deal with it.
Possibilities include
 Ignoring the issue. As an example, you may decide that three approvals
are necessary, even though the number is high.
 Taking simple steps to minimize the risk of a problem. For example,
you may ask the task leader to thoroughly document all important infor-
mation in case he leaves the project unexpectedly.
 Addressing the issue further in a formal risk-management plan. See
Chapter 8 for a discussion of how to analyze and plan to manage risks.
Developing an LRC
Having the people who play a part in your project participate in developing
the LRC increases its accuracy, as well as the people’s buy-in. However,
although the information included in the LRC is straightforward, getting
everyone to agree on people’s roles can be time-consuming.
The following steps can help you get people’s input and approval with the
least time and effort:
1. Identify all people who’ll participate in or support your project.
See the discussion of audiences in Chapter 3 for details.
2. Develop a complete list of activities for your project.
See the discussion of a Work Breakdown Structure in Chapter 4 for
details.
3. Discuss with all team members how they’ll each support the different
project activities.
For each of their assigned activities, discuss the level of their responsi-
bility and authority, as well as the specific work they will perform. Also
discuss with them any involvement that others will have on their activi-
ties. If specific people haven’t been identified for certain activities, con-
sult with people who have done those types of activities before.
4. Prepare an initial draft of your LRC.
Draw the table for your chart, and then enter your project’s activities in
the left-hand column and the people who will support the activities in the
first row. In the cells formed by the intersection of each row and column,
enter the roles you discussed with each person they would have.
5. Ask the people whom you consulted in Step 3 to review and approve
your draft chart.
195
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

If people agree with the chart, ask them to indicate their agreement in
writing. If they express concerns about some aspects, ask them to note
their concerns in a memo or an e-mail.
6. If some of those people don’t approve the draft chart, incorporate
their recommended changes into a second draft and again ask all
people who gave input to review and approve the chart.
If you make any changes to the draft LRC, have everyone review and
approve the revised chart, even if they had previously seen and
approved the prior version.
7. Go back to Step 5 and continue the process, until everyone you con-
sulted in Step 3 approves the chart.
Ensuring your chart is accurate
For complex projects, the LRC can be quite large. Also, keeping the chart cur-
rent and consulting throughout the project with all the people identified can
be time-consuming. However, having a chart with incorrect information can
result in duplicated efforts and overlooked activities.
The following suggestions can help you keep your LRC accurate and current:
 Develop a hierarchy of charts for larger projects. Including 50 or more
activities on the same LRC can be cumbersome. Consider developing a
series of nested charts for larger projects. Prepare a high-level chart that
identifies responsibilities for work assignments or tasks in your Work
Breakdown Structure, and then develop separate charts for individual
work assignments or tasks that detail responsibilities for associated
lower-level activities. (See Chapter 4 for the definition of work assign-
ments, tasks, and lower-level activities in a Work Breakdown Structure.)
Figure 10-2 illustrates a simple example. Suppose you’re planning a pro-
ject to design and implement an information system. Prepare a high-level
LRC that details the roles for major work assignments, such as finalize
requirements, design system, and test system. Display in a second chart
the roles of the team leader and his group on the lower-level activities
that comprise finalize requirements.
 Involve the entire team when developing your chart to ensure accu-
racy and buy-in. The project manager doesn’t know exactly how experts
and technical representatives from different groups should perform
tasks in their areas of specialty, so they need to tell him how they’ll
approach their assignments. And, even if he did know, people have a
greater commitment to a plan if they participate in developing it.
196
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

 Put your chart in writing. You may feel you’re saving time by not
putting the chart in writing because people all know what it should say
anyway. But, putting the chart in writing is essential for two reasons:
• You can identify possible problems that you may not have caught if
you were considering pieces of information separately.
Refer to the LRC in Figure 10-1. Before preparing the chart, the task
leader knew that he was primarily responsible for selecting respon-
dents to pretest the questionnaire. Other team members knew they
weren’t involved in that activity but probably assumed that some-
one in addition to the task leader was. Writing down this informa-
tion in the table highlights that the task leader is, in fact, the only
one involved in the activity.
• You ensure that people have a common understanding of their
roles and relationships.

Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

 Review and update your chart throughout your project. The longer
your project, the more likely that activities will be added or deleted, that
people will leave the team, and that new people will join the team.
Periodically reviewing and updating your LRC enables you to
• Assess whether the current assignments are working out and, if
not, where changes may be needed.
• Clarify the roles and responsibilities for new activities.
• Clarify the roles and responsibilities for people who join the team.
• Clarify how you’ll handle the roles and responsibilities of someone
who leaves the team.
If you join a project and find that no LRC exists, develop one. You can
develop a chart at any time during a project. If the project is already under-
way, develop a chart to clarify the roles and responsibilities from the current
point forward.
Dealing with Micromanagement
Micromanagement is a person’s excessive, inappropriate, and unnecessary
involvement in the details of a task that he asks another person to perform.
Whatever the reasons for micromanagement, it can lead to inefficient use of
personal time and energy, as well as to tension and low morale among staff.
Micromanagement can be debilitating both to the micromanager and to the
person she micromanages because they spend time and energy in unproduc-
tive activities that don’t contribute to project success. In this section I help
you look at the causes for micromanagement, give you some tips on ways to
gain your micromanager’s trust and confidence, and suggest how to work
with a micromanager.
Understanding why a person 
micromanages
No objective criteria can really describe when a person is micromanaging,
rather than providing close guidance and support. Whether you’re being
micromanaged is a subjective judgment; it depends upon whether you feel
that your boss is spending too much time looking over your shoulder. The
first step in dealing with a micromanager is to let the person know you feel
that his oversight is a bit excessive. Try to give him some objective indica-
tors to explain why you feel as you do.
198
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Occasionally, the micromanager will be surprised at your reaction and
change her undesirable behavior. If not, then consider whether one or more
of the following reasons may be the cause:
 The person is interested in and enjoys the work. Set up times to dis-
cuss interesting technical issues with the person.
 The person is a technical expert and feels that he can do the job best.
Review your technical work frequently with that person; give the person
opportunities to share his technical insights with you.
 The person may feel that he didn’t explain the assignment clearly or
that unexpected situations may crop up. Set up a schedule to discuss
and review your progress frequently so that the micromanager can
promptly uncover any mistakes and help you correct them.
 The person is looking for ways to stay involved with you and the
team. Set up scheduled times to discuss project activities. Provide the
micromanager with periodic reports of project progress, and make a
point to stop by and say hello periodically.
 The person feels threatened because you have more technical knowl-
edge than he does. When talking about your project in front of others,
always credit the micromanager for his guidance and insights. Share key
technical information with the person on a regular basis.
 The person doesn’t have a clear understanding of how he should be
spending his time. Discuss with the person the roles he would like you
to assume on project activities. Explain how the person can provide
useful support as you perform the work.
 The person feels that he has to stay up on the work you’re doing in
case anyone else asks about it. Discuss with the person what type of
information he needs and how frequently he needs it. Develop a sched-
ule to provide progress reports that include this information.
Helping a micromanager gain 
confidence in you
Your boss may be micromanaging you because he doesn’t yet have full confi-
dence in your ability to perform. Instead of being angry or resentful, take the
following steps to help the person develop that confidence:
 Don’t be defensive or resentful when the person asks you questions.
Doing so makes you appear as though you’re hiding something, which
only makes the person worry even more. Instead, willingly provide all
information asked for.
199
Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities

 Thank the micromanager for his interest, time, and technical guid-
ance. Complaining about what you perceive to be excessive oversight
only strains your relationship, increases the person’s fears and insecuri-
ties, and most likely causes the person to micromicromanage you. After
you explain that you value his input and will take it into account, you
can try to develop a more acceptable working relationship.
 Offer to explain how you approach your tasks. Explain the techniques
and approaches you use and how you ensure you meet established
product requirements, schedules, and budgets. Seeing that you perform
your work using appropriate, high-quality techniques will increase your
manager’s confidence that you’ll successfully complete the assignment
he gave you.
 Work with the person to develop a scheme for sharing progress and
accomplishments. Develop meaningful and frequent checkpoints.
Frequent monitoring early in your work reassures you both that you’re
successfully performing the assignments.
Working with a micromanager
You can reduce or even eliminate most micromanagement by improving your
communication and strengthening your interpersonal relationships. Consider
taking the following steps:
 Don’t assume. Don’t jump to conclusions. Examine the situation, get to
know the person who’s micromanaging you, and try to understand his
motivations. Expect that you can develop a working relationship that
you’re both comfortable with.
 Listen. Listen to the micromanager’s questions and comments; see if
patterns emerge. Try to understand his real interests and concerns.
 Observe the person’s behavior with others. If the person microman-
ages others, then the micromanagement likely stems from his feelings
rather than from your actions. Try to figure ways to address the
person’s real interests and concerns.
 If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Draw your first conclusion
and take steps to address the situation. If that approach doesn’t work,
reassess the situation and develop an alternative strategy. Keep at it
until you succeed.

Chapter 11
Starting Your Team Off 
on the Right Foot
In This Chapter
 Making final touches on team member assignments
 Creating your team’s identity
 Developing your team’s operating procedures
 Making it official
 Planning the post-project review
A
fter intense work on a tight schedule, you submit your project plan for
review and approval. A few days later, your boss comes to you and says,
“I have some good news and some bad news. Which would you like to
hear first?”
“Tell me the good news,” you respond.
“Your plan’s been approved.”
“So, what’s the bad news?”
“Now you have to do the project!”
Starting your project off correctly is a key to ultimate success. Your project
plan describes what you’ll produce, the work you’ll do, how you’ll do it, when
you’ll do it, and the resources you’ll need. You based your plan on the infor-
mation you had at the time, and, if information wasn’t available, you made
assumptions. The more time between your plan’s completion and its
approval, the more changes you’re going to find in your plan’s assumptions.
As you prepare to start your project, you need to reconfirm or update the
information in your plan, determine or reaffirm which people will play a role
in your project, and prepare the systems and procedures that will support
your project’s performance. This chapter tells you how to accomplish these
tasks and get your project off to a strong start.

Finalizing Your Project’s Participants
A project audience is a person or group that supports, is affected by, or is
interested in your project. (See Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of how to
identify project audiences.) In your project plan, you describe the roles you
anticipate people to play and the amount of effort you expect team members
to invest. You identify the people by name, by title or position, or by the skills
and knowledge they need.
This section shows you how to reaffirm who you’ll involve in your project.
This section also helps you make sure everyone’s still on board — and tells
you what to do if some people aren’t.
Confirming your team members’ 
participation
As you start your project, confirm the identities of the people who’ll work to
support your project by verifying that specific people are still able to uphold
their promised commitments and, if needed, recruiting and select new people
to fill the remaining needs.
Contact all people who will support your project to
1. Inform them that your project has been approved and when work will
start.
Not all project plans are approved. You rarely know in advance how long
the approval process will take or how soon your project can start.
Inform team members as soon as possible so they can schedule the nec-
essary time.
2. Confirm that they’re still able to support your project.
People’s workloads and other commitments may change between the
time you prepare your plan and your project’s approval. If a person is no
longer able to provide the promised support, recruit a replacement as
soon as possible.
3. Explain what you’ll do to develop the project team and start the pro-
ject work.
Provide a list of all team members and others who will support the pro-
ject. Also mention the steps you’ll take to introduce members and kick
off the project.
202
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

4. Reconfirm the work you expect them to perform, when they’re to do
it, and the amount of time you expect them to spend on it.
Clarify specific activities and the nature of the work. Depending on the
size and formality of your project, you can use any format from a quick
e-mail to a formal work-order agreement.
As Figure 11-1 illustrates, a typical work-order agreement includes the follow-
ing information:
 Identifiers: Include project name, project number, activity name, and
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) code. (For more information about
the WBS, see Chapter 4.) The project name and number confirm that
your project is now official. You use the activity name and WBS code
number to record work progress as well as time and resource charges.
 Work to be performed: Describe the different activities and procedures
as well as outputs of the project.
 Activity start date, end date, and number of hours to be spent:
Including this information reaffirms
• The importance of doing the work within the schedule and budget
• The person’s acknowledgement that he expects to do the
described work within these time and resource constraints
• The criteria you’ll use to assess the person’s performance
 Written approvals from the person who’ll do the work, his supervisor,
and the project manager: Including these written approvals increases
the likelihood that these people have read and understood its elements
and commit to support it.

Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

Be sure you specify all of this information when reconfirming a person’s com-
mitment to your project. The longer you wait to specify any of this informa-
tion, the greater the chances are that a person won’t provide the support you
had hoped for.
If you choose not to use a formal work order, be sure to write down all key
information that clarifies your agreement and get signed approvals from the
team member and his supervisor. Asking for signed approvals encourages
people to consider carefully before they make any commitments and serves
as a reference and reminder of exactly what was promised.
Assuring that others are on board
Others may also play a role in your project’s success, even though they may
not officially be members of your project team. Two such groups are drivers,
people who have a say in defining the results of your project, and supporters,
people who will perform a service or provide resources for your team.
A special audience is your project champion, a person in a high position in the
organization who strongly supports your project; who will advocate for your
project in disputes, planning meetings, and review sessions; and who will
take necessary actions to help ensure your project’s success. (See Chapter 3
for a detailed discussion of these different types of project audiences.)
Contact your project champion and all other drivers and supporters to
 Inform them your project has been approved and when work will start
 Reaffirm your project’s objectives
 Confirm with identified drivers that the project’s planned results still
address their needs
 Clarify with supporters exactly how you want them to help your project
 Develop specific plans for involving each audience throughout the pro-
ject and keeping them informed of progress
In addition, some people will be interested in your project but won’t define
its planned results or directly support your efforts. As you identify these
observers, choose those individuals you want to keep informed of your
progress throughout the project and plan how you will do it. (See Chapter 3
for a discussion of how to identify project observers and Chapter 13 for dif-
ferent ways to keep people informed about your progress.)
204
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Filling in the blanks
If your plan identifies proposed project team members by job title, position
description, or skills and knowledge, you have to find actual people to fill the
specified roles. You can fill the roles by assigning this responsibility to some-
one already on your organization’s staff, by recruiting a person from outside
your organization, or by contracting with an external organization.
Whichever method you choose, prepare a written description of the activities
you want each person to perform. This description can range from a simple
memo for informal projects to a written job description for more formal ones.
Write down your needs for each category of personnel separately. At a mini-
mum, include the following information in your description:
 Project name, number, and start date
 Necessary skills and knowledge
 Activities to be performed and start and end dates
 Anticipated level of effort
If you plan to look inside your organization, do the following:
 Identify potential candidates by working with your human resources
(HR) department and area managers.
 Meet with the candidates to discuss your project, describe the work,
and assess their qualifications.
 Choose the best candidates and ask them to join your team.
 Document the agreement.
If you’re looking outside the organization, consult with your organization’s
HR to identify potential resources. Provide your HR with a detailed descrip-
tion of the qualifications, skills, and knowledge needed, the expected tasks,
and the level of effort. Sit in on the interview and assessment process.
Also, if you plan to obtain the support of external consultants, work with
your organization’s contracts office. Provide the contracts office with the
same information that you would provide your HR office. Review the contract
document before your contracting officer signs it.
In addition, work with people in key organizational units to identify people,
other than team members, who will support your project. After you identify
these people:
205
Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

 Meet with them to clarify your project’s goals and anticipated outputs
and the ways in which they will support your performance.
 Develop plans for involving them and keeping them informed of progress
throughout your project.
Developing Your Team
Merely assigning people to tasks doesn’t create a project team. A team is a
collection of people who are committed to common goals and who depend
on one other to do their jobs. Project teams consist of members who can and
must make a valuable and unique contribution to the project.
A team is different from other associations of people who work together. For
example,
 A group consists of people who work individually to accomplish their
particular assignments on a common task.
 A committee consists of people who come together to review and cri-
tique issues, propose recommendations for action, and, on occasion,
implement those recommendations.
As soon as you identify your project team members, take steps to define and
establish your team’s identity as well as its operating practices. Develop
these elements, making sure your team understands and accepts them:
 Goals: What the team as a whole and members individually hopes to
accomplish
 Roles: Each member’s assignments
 Processes: The techniques that team members will use to perform their
project tasks
 Relationships: The attitudes and behaviors of team members toward
each other
This section discusses how to help begin creating your team’s identity by
having members review and discuss the plan, examine overall team and indi-
vidual team member goals, agree on everyone’s roles, and start to establish
productive working relationships.
206
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Reviewing the approved project plan
As soon as people join the team, have them review the approved project plan
to reinforce the project’s goals, clarify the work planned, confirm the feasibil-
ity of time and resource estimates, and identify any potential problems. Meet
as a group to discuss people’s thoughts and reactions, after they’ve reviewed
the plan.
Team members who contributed to the proposal can remind themselves of
the project’s background and purpose, their planned roles, and the work to
be done. They can also identify situations and circumstances that may have
changed since the proposal was prepared and then review and reassess pro-
ject risks and risk-management plans.
New team members can understand the project’s background and purpose,
find out about their roles and assignments, raise concerns about time frames
and budgets, and identify issues that may affect the project’s success.
Developing team and individual goals
Team members commit to your project when they believe their participation
can help them achieve worthwhile professional and personal goals. Help
team members develop and buy into a shared sense of the project goals by 
 Discussing the reasons for the project, its supporters, and the impact of
its results. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of how to identify the needs
your project will address.)
 Clarifying how the results may benefit the organization’s clients.
 Emphasizing how the results may support your organization’s growth
and viability.
 Exploring how the results may impact each team member’s job.
Encourage people to think about how their participation may help them
achieve personal goals, such as acquiring new skills and knowledge, meeting
new people, increasing their visibility in the organization, and enhancing
their opportunities for job advancement. Obviously, projects aren’t only
about helping team members achieve personal benefits. However, when team
members can realize personal benefits while performing valued services for
the organization, the members’ motivation and commitment to project suc-
cess will be greater. (See Chapter 14 for more on how to create and sustain
team member motivation.)
207
Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

Defining team member roles
Nothing causes disillusionment and frustration faster than bringing moti-
vated people together and then giving them no guidance on working with
each other. Two or more people may start doing the same activity indepen-
dently, and other activities may be overlooked entirely. Eventually, these
people find tasks that don’t require coordination, or they gradually withdraw
from the project to work on more rewarding assignments.
To prevent this frustration, work with team members to define the activities
that each member works on and the nature of their roles. Possible roles
include the following:
 Primary responsibility: Has the overall obligation to complete an activity
 Secondary or supporting responsibility: Has the obligation to complete
part of an activity
 Approval: Must approve the results of an activity before work can proceed
 Available for consultation: Can provide expert guidance and support if
needed
 Must receive output: Receives either a physical product from an activity
or a report of an activity
If you prepared a Linear Responsibility Chart as part of your project plan, use
it to start your discussions of project roles with your team members (see
Chapter 10 for more on how to use a Linear Responsibility Chart). However,
encourage questions and concerns from team members until they’re comfort-
able that the roles are feasible and appropriate.
Defining your team’s operating processes
Develop the procedures that you and your team will use to support your day-
to-day work. Having these procedures in place allows people to effectively
and efficiently perform their tasks, as well as contribute to a positive team
atmosphere. At a minimum, develop procedures for the following:
 Communication: Sharing project-related information in writing and
through face-to-face interactions. Such procedures may include
• When and how to use e-mail to share project information
• Which types of information should be in writing
• When and how to document informal discussions
208
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

• How to set up regularly scheduled reports and meetings to record
and review progress
• How to address special issues that arise
 Conflict resolution: Resolving differences of opinion between team
members regarding project work. You can develop
• Standard approaches (normal steps that you take to encourage
people to develop a mutually agreeable solution)
• Escalation procedures (steps you take if the people involved can’t
readily resolve their differences.)
 Decision making: Deciding among alternative approaches and actions.
Develop guidelines for choosing the most appropriate choice for the sit-
uation, including consensus, majority rule, unanimous agreement, and
decision by technical expert. Also develop escalation procedures — steps
you take if the normal decision-making approaches get bogged down.
Supporting the development 
of team member relationships
On high-performance project teams, members trust each other and have cor-
dial, coordinated working relationships. But, developing trust and effective
work practices takes time and concerted effort. Help your team members get
to know and be comfortable with one other as soon as your project starts by
encouraging them to
 Work through conflicts together
 Brainstorm challenging technical and administrative issues
 Spend informal personal time together, such as having lunch or partici-
pating in non-work-related activities after hours
Helping your team to become 
a smooth-functioning unit
When team members trust each other, have confidence in each other’s abili-
ties, can count on each other’s promises, and communicate openly, all of
their efforts can be devoted to performing their project work instead of deal-
ing with interpersonal frustrations.
209
Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

Help your team achieve this high performance level of functioning by guiding
them through the following stages:
 Forming: Identifying and meeting team members; politely discussing
project objectives, work assignments, and so forth. Share the project
plan, introduce people to each other, and discuss each person’s back-
ground, organizational responsibilities, and areas of expertise.
 Storming: Raising and resolving personal conflicts about the project or
other team members.
• Encourage people to discuss any concerns they have about the
project plan’s feasibility, and be sure you address those concerns.
• Encourage people to discuss any reservations they may have
about other team members or team members’ abilities.
• Focus these discussions on ways to ensure successful task perfor-
mance — you don’t want the talks to turn into unproductive per-
sonal attacks.
• You can initially speak privately with people about issues you’re
uncomfortable bringing up in front of the entire team. Eventually,
though, you must discuss their concerns with the entire team, in
order to achieve a sense of mutual honesty and trust.
 Norming: Developing the standards and operating guidelines that
govern team-member behavior. Encourage members to establish these
team norms instead of relying on the procedures and practices they use
in their functional areas. Examples of these norms include the following:
• How people present and discuss different points of view: Some
people present points of view politely, while others aggressively
debate their opponents in an attempt to prove their point.
• Timeliness of meeting attendance: Some people always show up
for meetings on time, while others are habitually 15 minutes late.
• Participation in meetings: Some people sit back and observe,
while others actively participate and share their ideas.
At a team meeting, encourage people to discuss how team members
should behave in different situations. Address concerns people may
express and encourage the group to adopt team norms.
 Performing: Doing project work, monitoring schedules and budgets,
making needed changes, and keeping people informed.
210
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Keep the following in mind as you guide your team through its developmental
phases:
 If everything goes smoothly on your project, it doesn’t matter whether
the team has successfully gone through the forming, storming, and
norming stages. But when the project hits problems, your team may
become dysfunctional if it hasn’t progressed through every stage.
Suppose, for example, that the team misses a major project deadline. If
team members haven’t developed mutual trust for one another, they’re
more likely to spend time searching for someone to blame than working
together to fix the situation.
 On occasion, you may have to revisit a stage you thought the team
had completed. For example, a new person may join the team, or a
major aspect of the project plan may change.
 Your team won’t automatically pass through these stages; you have to
guide them. Left on their own, teams often fail to move beyond the form-
ing stage. Many people don’t like to confront thorny interpersonal
issues, so they ignore them.
 Periodically assess how the team feels it’s performing; decide which,
if any, issues the team needs to work through. Managing your team is a
project itself!
Laying the Groundwork for 
Controlling Your Project
Controlling your project throughout its performance requires that you collect
appropriate information, evaluate your performance compared with your
plan, and share your findings with your project’s audiences. This section
highlights the steps you take to prepare to collect, analyze, and share this
information.
Selecting and preparing 
your tracking systems
Effective project control requires accurate and timely information to help you
identify problems promptly and take effective corrective action. This section
highlights the information you’ll need and how to get it.
211
Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

Throughout your project, you’ll track performance in terms of the following:
 Schedule achievement: How well you’re meeting established dates
 Personnel resource use: The levels of effort people are spending on
their assignments
 Financial expenditures: Funds you’re spending for project resources
See Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion of the information systems you can
use to track your project’s progress.
If you use existing systems to track your project’s schedule performance and
resource use, set up your project on these systems as follows:
 Obtain your official project number. Your project number is the official
company identifier for your project. All products, activities, and
resources related to your project are assigned that number. Check with
your organization’s finance department or project office to find out your
project’s number and check with your finance or information technology
department to determine the steps you must take to set up your project
on the organization’s financial tracking system labor recording system
and/or activity tracking system.
 Finalize your project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Have team
members review your project’s WBS and make any necessary changes or
additions. Assign identifier codes to all WBS elements. (Check out
Chapter 4 for a complete explanation of the WBS.)
 Set up charge codes for your project on the organization’s labor track-
ing system. If team members record their labor hours by projects, set up
charge codes for all WBS activities. This allows you to monitor the
progress of individual WBS elements, as well as the total project.
Also, if your organization’s system can limit the number of hours for
each activity, enter those limits. Doing so ensures that people don’t mis-
takenly charge more hours to activities than your plan allows.
 Set up charge codes for your project on your organization’s financial
system. If your organization tracks expenditures by project, set up the
codes for all WBS activities that have expenditures. If the system can
limit expenditures for each activity, enter those limits.
212
Part III: Putting Your Team Together 

Establishing schedules for 
reports and meetings
To be sure you satisfy your information needs and those of your project’s
audiences, set up a schedule of reports you’ll prepare and meetings you’ll
hold during the project. Planning your communications in advance with your
audiences helps ensure you adequately meet their individual needs and
allows them to reserve time on their calendars to attend the meetings.
Meet with project audiences and team members to develop a schedule for
regular project meetings and progress reports. Confirm these details:
 Reports that will be issued
 Meetings that will be held and their specific purposes
 When reports will be issued and when meetings will be held
 Who will receive the reports and attend the meetings
 The formats and content of the reports and meetings
See Chapter 13 for a discussion of the reports and meetings you can use to
support ongoing project communications.
Setting your project’s baseline
The project baseline is the version of the plan that guides your project activi-
ties and provides the comparative basis for your performance assessments.
At the beginning of your project, use the plan that was approved at the end of
the definition phase, modified by any approved changes made during the start
phase, as your baseline. During the project, use as your baseline the most
recent approved version of the project plan. (See Chapter 12 for more discus-
sion on setting and updating your project’s baseline.)
Announcing Your Project
After you’ve notified your key project audiences (that is, team members, dri-
vers, and supporters) that the project has been approved and when it’ll start,
introduce it to others who may be interested (see Chapter 3 for a discussion
how to identify the observers in your project’s audience). Consider one or
more of the following approaches to announce your project to these people:
213
Chapter 11: Starting Your Team Off on the Right Foot

 An e-mail to selected individuals or departments in your organization
 An announcement in your organization’s newsletter
 A flyer on a prominent bulletin board
 A formal kickoff meeting (if your project is large or will have broad 
organizational impact)
In each instance, tell people the purpose and scope of your project, your
intended outcomes and results, and the key dates. Tell them how they can get in
touch with you if they have questions or would like detailed information.
Laying the Groundwork for Your 
Post-Project Evaluation
A post-project evaluation is a meeting in which you
 Review the experience you have gained from the project.
 Recognize people for their achievements.
 Plan to ensure that good practices will be repeated on future projects.
 Plans to head off problems on future projects you encountered on this
one. (See Chapter 15 for more about a post-project evaluation.)
Start laying groundwork as soon as your project begins to ensure you capture
all relevant information and observations about the project to discuss at the
post-project evaluation meeting. Do this as follows:
 Tell the team you’ll hold a post-project review when the project ends.
 Encourage team members to keep records of problems, ideas, and sug-
gestions throughout the project. When you prepare the final agenda for
the post-project evaluation session, you’ll ask people to review these
records and notes to find topics to discuss.
 Clarify the criteria that define your project’s success by reviewing the
latest version of your project’s objectives with team members.
 Describe the details of the situation before you began the project (if the
project was designed to change or improve a situation). Doing so enables
you to assess the changes in these details from beginning to end.
 Maintain your own project log (a narrative record of project issues and
occurrences) and encourage other team members to do the same.

Tracking Progress and
Maintaining Control
In This Chapter
 Keeping on course: The project plan versus actual performance
 Utilizing systems to track scheduling, labor hours, and expenditures
 Formulating and taking corrective actions
 Managing changes
A
sad reality of projects is that they’re often born amid high hopes and
expectations and die in frustration and disappointment. Your project
plans represent visions that you believe will work; however, those plans don’t
implement themselves automatically, and they can’t predict the future with
certainty.
Successful projects require continued care and management to ensure that
the project follows the plans correctly and, as a result, leads to the desired
results. When unexpected situations occur, you must react promptly to
adjust your efforts and keep your project on track.
This chapter discusses the steps in the project control process and focuses
on the systems and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and reporting on
schedule performance, labor hours, and expenditures, and taking corrective
actions when needed.
Controlling Your Project
Project control entails the following activities you perform throughout your
project to ensure that your project proceeds according to plan and produces
the desired results (see Appendix B for a float chart illustrating the cyclical
nature of project control):

 Reconfirming the plan: At the beginning of each performance period
(the time interval at which you regularly review and assess project per-
formance), reaffirm with team members the following project responsi-
bilities and commitments they made for the coming period:
• Activities they agreed to perform
• Dates they will start and end these activities
• Amount of person-effort they agreed they would need to perform
these activities
 Assessing performance: During the performance period, have team
members record information on completed products, successful accep-
tance tests, dates they reached milestones, dates they started and
ended activities, number of hours they worked on each activity, amount
of resources they used for each activity, and expenditures they made for
each activity. Collect this information at the end of the performance
period, compare your team’s performance with the plan, and determine
the reasons for any differences.
 Taking corrective action: If necessary, take steps to bring your project’s
performance back into conformance with your plans, or if that’s not pos-
sible, change the existing plans to reflect a new set of expectations.
 Keeping people informed: Share your achievements, problems, and future
plans with your project’s audiences. (See Chapter 13 for suggestions on
how to share progress information with your project’s audiences.)
Choose the time period for monitoring your project’s performance based on
the overall length of the project, the risk of unexpected occurrences, and
your proximity to major project milestones. Although you may choose to
monitor select project activities on a daily basis in certain situations, plan to
assess your project’s overall performance at least once a month to identify
promptly any unexpected occurrences or performance problems that must
be addressed.
When a person reaffirms her existing commitments for the upcoming perfor-
mance period, the chances are greater that she will perform her assignments
successfully, on time, and within budget. If she is unable to honor the com-
mitments she made previously (for example, if she has unexpectedly been
assigned to work on another high-priority effort during the same time
period), you can work with her to develop new plans for how and when she
will complete her assignment for your project.
Initially, you may be uncomfortable reconfirming commitments that people
have made for an upcoming performance period because you feel that it
218
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Suggests that you don’t trust the person. After all, the person has made
a commitment to do the specified work; wouldn’t she tell you if she were
unable to live up to that commitment?
 Increases the likelihood that she’ll say she can’t live up to the original
promise. You’re concerned that raising the topic may actually encour-
age her to say she can’t honor her commitments.
In most cases, though, neither situation proves to be true. First, raising the
issue doesn’t suggest a lack of trust; if you didn’t trust the person, you wouldn’t
be talking with her at all! On the contrary, checking in with her reflects your
appreciation that she may not have had a chance to tell you about new cir-
cumstances that make it difficult to honor her commitments. Second, raising
the issue doesn’t increase the chances that she’ll opt out of a commitment —
it buys you time. If the person can’t perform, you’ll find that out at the end of
the performance period anyway, when she hasn’t finished the work. So taking
time to reconfirm actually provides an entire performance period to develop
alternative ways of dealing with her new restrictions.
Establishing Project Management
Information Systems
A project management information system (PMIS) is a set of procedures, equip-
ment, and other resources for collecting, analyzing, storing, and reporting
information that describes project performance. To support your ongoing
management and control of the project, you need to collect and maintain
information about schedule performance, work effort, and expenditures. This
section tells you how to collect, analyze, and report on these three parts of
your project’s performance.
Identifying the three parts of a PMIS
A project management information system contains the following three parts:
 Inputs: Raw data that describe select aspects of project performance
 Processes: Storage and analysis of the data to compare actual perfor-
mance with planned performance

Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

In addition to defining the data items, designing a PMIS requires that you
specify how to collect the data, who collects it, when they collect it, and how
they enter the data into the system. All of these factors can affect the timeli-
ness and accuracy of the data and, therefore, of your project performance
assessments.
Many information systems have the technical support of computers, scan-
ners, printers, and plotters. However, an information system can consist of
manual processes and physical storage devices as well. For example, you can
record project activities in your notebook calendar and keep records of pro-
ject budgets in your file cabinet. But you still need to monitor your proce-
dures for collecting, storing, analyzing, and reporting your information
because those procedures also affect the accuracy and timeliness of your
project performance assessments.
Monitoring schedule performance
Regularly monitoring your project’s schedule performance can provide early
indications of possible activity-coordination problems, resource conflicts,
and cost overruns that may occur in the future. The following sections show
you what information you need to monitor schedule performance, how to col-
lect and evaluate it, and how to ensure its accuracy.
Defining the data to collect
You can describe an activity’s status either by noting whether it’s started, in
progress, or finished, or by indicating the portion of the activity that’s been
completed.
Be careful if you decide to use percent completed to indicate an activity’s
progress. Most often, this measure represents only a guess because you have
no clear way to determine this percentage. For example, saying that your new
product design is 30 percent complete is virtually meaningless because you
can’t determine how much of the thinking and creating is actually done.
Suggesting that you have completed 30 percent of your design because you
have expended 30 of the 100 hours budgeted for the task or because three of
the ten days allotted for its performance have passed is equally incorrect.
The first indicator is a measure of resource use, and the second is a measure
of time elapsed. Neither measure indicates the amount of substantive work
completed.
On the other hand, if your activity has clear segments that take roughly the
same amount of time and effort, you may be able to determine an accurate
measure of percent complete. For example, if you planned to conduct tele-
phone interviews with 20 different people and you have completed 10, you
can argue that the activity is 50 percent complete.
220
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

If you choose to describe your project’s schedule performance by noting the
status of individual activities, collect either or both of the following pieces of
data to support your analyses:
 The start and end dates for each lowest-level activity in your project’s
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
 The dates key events (such as contract signed, materials received, or envi-
ronmental test completed) are reached
See Chapter 4 for a discussion of the WBS and Chapter 5 for the definitions of
an activity and an event.
Analyzing schedule performance
Assess your project’s schedule status by comparing actual activity start/end
dates and actual key-event dates to their planned dates. Figures 12-1 and 12-2
present formats that support ready comparisons of these data.
Figure 12-1 depicts a combined activities and key-events report. The follow-
ing information in this report comes from your project plan:
 The activity or key event identifier and description
 The person responsible for ensuring that the activity or event occurs
 The dates the activity should start and end or the event should occur
These data describe performance during the period of the report:
 The dates the activity actually starts and ends or the event actually
occurs
 Relevant comments about the event

Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

Figure 12-2 illustrates a progress Gantt chart. You shade an appropriate por-
tion of each bar to represent activity progress. This sample chart presents
project performance as of June 30. According to the chart, the design phase
is complete, the develop phase is one month behind schedule, and the con-
duct test phase is one month ahead of schedule.
The most meaningful way to assess activity progress is to consider the activ-
ity’s intermediate events that you’ve achieved to date. The progress Gantt
chart in Figure 12-2 really says that on June 30 you achieved all the intermedi-
ate events of Task 2 that you had planned to reach by May 31 or, as noted in
the previous paragraph, that Task 2 is one month ahead of schedule.
Note: You may think I violated my own guideline by reporting on four-month
activities. (I suggest in Chapter 4 that your lowest-level activities should last
no more than two weeks.) However, you can prepare these reports with any
level of detail you choose, depending on your audiences’ interests and needs.
This high-level report presents information for four-month activities, but the
detailed plan would break these activities into subelements of two weeks or
less.
Not everyone interprets a progress Gantt chart the same way. I intended the
chart to suggest that Task 2 is one month behind schedule. However, some
people have told me that they interpret the report to mean Task 2 is 25 per-
cent complete because one of the four segments for Task 2 is shaded. And
one person said that the chart indicated Task 2 actually ended on June 30,
although I’ve never figured out how he justified that interpretation. The mes-
sage is: Be sure you include a legend with your graph that explains clearly
how you want people to interpret it.

Collecting schedule performance data
In order to collect the schedule performance data, develop a standard format
and process for recording your work accomplishments. Standard formats and
processes improve the accuracy of your information and take less time. I fre-
quently use the combined activities report and key-events report format.
Consider the following factors when you schedule activity monitoring.
 Is the activity on a critical path? Delayed activities on a critical path
will delay your overall project schedule (see Chapter 5 for a detailed dis-
cussion of critical paths). Therefore, consider monitoring critical-path
activities more often to identify potential problems as soon as possible
and minimize their effect on the project schedule.
 Is the activity on a path that’s close to being critical? Activities on non-
critical paths can have some delays before their path becomes critical.
The maximum delay for noncritical activities is called slack time or float
(see Chapter 5). If an activity’s slack time is very short, a small delay can
cause the path to become critical. Therefore, consider monitoring activi-
ties that have very small slack times more often (again to identify poten-
tial problems as soon as possible).
 Is the activity risk high? If you feel that an activity is very likely to
encounter problems, consider monitoring it more frequently to identify
those problems as soon as they occur.
 Have you already encountered problems with this activity? Consider
monitoring activities more frequently if you’ve already had problems
with them. All things being equal, past problems increase the chances of
future problems.
At the beginning of a performance period, I print separate reports for each
team member that include their activities and events for the period. I ask team
members to record actual activity start and end dates and actual key-event
dates in the appropriate columns, along with any comments they want to
share. I ask them to send me a copy of the completed report on the first busi-
ness day after the performance period.
Recording and reporting on progress this way has several advantages:
 Recording achievements at the time they occur increases the likelihood
that the data are accurate.
 The agreed-upon schedule for submitting information to me reduces the
chance that I’ll surprise people with unexpected requests for progress
data.
 Having people continuously review their proposed schedules and record
their accomplishments heightens their awareness of goals and increases
the chances that they’ll meet their commitments.
223
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

 The purpose of control is to encourage people to perform according to
your plan, not just to collect data. The more aware the team members
are of their work in relation to the overall schedule, the greater the likeli-
hood that they’ll hit the schedule. If they don’t know or care about the
target date, they’re unlikely to hit it.
I also use the combined activities and key-events report format to reaffirm
people’s commitments at the start of a performance period. When I give them
the report detailing their activities and events for the coming period, I ask
them to verify the information and reaffirm their commitments. We discuss
and resolve any issues that they identify.
Monitor schedule performance at least once a month. Experience has shown
that waiting longer does the following:
 Allows people to lose focus and commitment to the activity and
increases the chances that the activity won’t end on schedule
 Provides more time for small problems to go undetected and thus evolve
into bigger problems
Improving the accuracy of your schedule performance data
Collecting the right data items is the first requirement for effectively control-
ling your project’s schedule. However, your analyses will be meaningless
unless the data are correct.
Do the following to improve the accuracy of your schedule performance data:
 Tell the team members how you plan to use their schedule perfor-
mance data. People are always more motivated to perform a task if they
understand the reasons for it.
 Provide schedule performance reports to the people who give you the
data. People are even more motivated to perform a task if they get direct
benefits from it.
 Publicly acknowledge those people who give you timely and accurate
data. Positive reinforcement of desired behavior confirms to people that
they’re meeting your expectations; it also emphasizes that desirable
behavior to other people.
 Clearly define activities and events. Clear definitions help you deter-
mine when a milestone does or doesn’t occur, and when an activity does
or doesn’t take place.
224
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Use all the data that you collect and don’t collect more data than
you’ll use. Collect only the data that you know you’ll use to assess
schedule performance.
Choosing a vehicle to support your schedule tracking system
Check to see whether your organization uses an enterprise-wide project plan-
ning and tracking system. The best places to look for this information are
your organization’s Project Management Office (PMO), Information
Technology Department, and Finance Department (see Chapter 17 for differ-
ent types of software used to support project management and Chapter 18
for more on a PMO). If the organization does have such a system, check to
see whether you can use it to monitor your project, whether it provides the
information you need, and whether its information is timely and accurate.
If your organization doesn’t have an existing system you can use, you will
have to develop your own. You can use either a manual system or a com-
puter-based system; both offer advantages and disadvantages.
Manual systems include day planners, personal calendars, and handwritten
project logs. If you use any of these systems to record your activities and
achievements, you don’t need special computers or software, which may
save you money.
However, manual systems have these disadvantages:
 Storing your data requires space. The more data you have, the more
space you need.
 Comparing and analyzing the data by hand can be time-consuming, and
the chances for errors creeping in are greater.
 Preparing reports by hand is time-consuming.
A computer-based PMIS can be supported by the following:
 Integrated project management software, such as Microsoft Project
 Database software, such as Microsoft Access
 Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel
 Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word
These systems offer the advantages of faster processing, more efficient data
storage, and professionally designed reports. However, they’re also more dif-
ficult to learn to use, more difficult to maintain, and more expensive.
225
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

Many manufacturers offer software packages in these categories. However,
more than 80 percent of the organizations that I’ve worked with use Microsoft
software for these functions (thus my examples of Microsoft software pack-
ages in the previous bullets). Check to see whether this software available on
your organization’s local area network (LAN).
Monitoring work effort
Comparing work effort expended with work effort planned can highlight
when people are incorrectly expanding or reducing the scope of an activity,
are more or less qualified than you anticipated, are encountering unexpected
difficulties performing the work, and warn of the possibility of using up allo-
cated work effort before your project ends.
Monitoring work effort requires you to collect the actual effort spent on each
lowest-level WBS activity. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of the WBS.)
Analyzing work effort expended
Evaluate your project’s work effort expenditures by comparing the actual
expenditures with those in your plan. Figure 12-3 depicts a typical labor
report that describes the work effort by each team member on each lowest-
level project activity. The following information in this report comes from
your project plan:
 An activity identifier and description
 The total hours budgeted for each team member to spend on each activity
 The hours budgeted for each team member to spend on each activity
every week
You obtain or derive the following information from data during the period
covered by the report:
 The actual number of hours spent by each team member on each activity
 The total number of remaining hours for each team member on each
activity
 The running difference between the total number of hours in the plan
and the number each team member actually spent on each activity
226
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Actual labor expenditures rarely agree 100 percent with the planned
amounts. (In fact, if the number of hours for each task each month is identi-
cal to the number in your plan for several months, you may wonder whether
people are copying the numbers from the plan onto their time sheets!)
Typically, variances of 10 percent above or below the expected numbers in
any month are normal.
Consider the charges for two team members in the labor report in Figure
12-3. Smith appears to be working in accordance with the plan. He charged
more hours in Week 2 than planned, fewer in Week 3, and the same as
planned in Week 4. Jones’s situation is very different. Each week, Jones is
spending less time on the project than planned, and the total shortfall of
hours is building steadily. Whether or not this shortfall indicates a problem is
not clear, but the systematic undercharging does point to a situation that
needs further investigation.
Collecting work effort data
Having people fill out time sheets is the most effective way to collect work
effort expenditure data. Figure 12-4 illustrates a typical time sheet.
A time sheet includes the following data:
 The number of hours a team member worked on each activity each day
 The member’s signature verifying that the information is correct
 An approval signature (typically the project manager or someone she
designates) verifying that the time charges are valid and appropriate

Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

In most instances, recording work on an activity to the nearest half-hour is
sufficient.
Note: Some people may record their time in intervals smaller than half an
hour. Lawyers, for example, often allocate their time in six-minute segments.
Their clients would have it no other way — given that a lawyer may charge
$300 or more per hour!
A time log is a form that breaks the day into intervals and enables a team
member to record the specific activity that he worked on in each interval. For
example, to record time in half-hour intervals for a member who begins work
at 8:30 a.m., the first interval on the log is 8:30 to 9 a.m., the second is 9 to
9:30 a.m., and so on.
If team members fill out time logs conscientiously, they provide more-accu-
rate data because the log allows them to account for every segment of the
day. However, maintaining a time log is far more time-consuming than filling
out a time sheet. Normally, detailing on a time sheet the total time a person
spends working on his different activities each day is sufficient.
Improving the accuracy of your work effort expenditure data
Just as with schedule performance data, the more accurate your labor hour
expenditure information is, the more meaningful your analyses will be. Take

Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Explain to people that you’re using their labor effort expenditures to
help you determine when you may need to change aspects of the plan.
When you ask people to detail the hours they spend on specific assign-
ments, they often fear that you’ll criticize them for not spending time
exactly in accordance with the plan — no matter what the reason — or
for not spending enough hours on project work as opposed to other
administrative duties. Unfortunately, if they believe these are your
motives, they’ll allocate their work hours among activities to reflect
what they think you want to see instead of what they’re really doing.
 Encourage people to record the actual hours they work instead of
making their total hours equal 40 hours per week. If people must
record a total of 40 hours per week and they work overtime, they’ll omit
hours or try to reduce them proportionately. You want workers to
record accurate data.
 Include categories for time on nonproject activities, such as unallo-
cated, administrative overhead, and so on. If you want people to
record their time expenditures honestly, you must provide them with
appropriate categories.
 Encourage people to fill out their own time sheets. Some people ask a
third person, such as a secretary, to fill out time sheets for them. But
people have a hard enough time remembering themselves what they did
the past day or the past week; expecting someone else to accurately
remember it for them is totally unrealistic.
 Collect time sheets weekly if possible, or at least once every two
weeks. No matter how often you ask people to fill out their time sheets,
many people wait until the sheet is due to complete it. If you collect
sheets once a month, those people will be sitting there at the end of the
month trying to remember what they did four weeks ago!
 Don’t ask people to submit their time sheet before the period is over.
On occasion, managers ask workers to submit time sheets on Thursday
for the week ending on Friday. But, this practice immediately reduces
the accuracy of the data because a worker can’t be certain what she’ll
be doing tomorrow. More important, though, this practice suggests to
workers that, if guessing at Friday’s allocation is acceptable, maybe they
don’t have to be too concerned with the accuracy of the rest of the
week’s data either.
Choosing a vehicle to support your work effort tracking system
Before you choose a method for tracking your work effort, check whether
your organization has a time-recording system in place that can accurately
record data the way you need it. When assessing an existing time-recording
system, consider the following:
229
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

 Time-recording systems typically allocate a person’s pay to regular
work, vacation time, sick leave, and holiday leave. As such, the system
may require exempt employees (that is, employees who aren’t paid for
overtime) to record no more than 40 hours per week. Additionally, these
systems often lack the capability to track regular work by detailed WBS
categories.
 People are often uncomfortable recording the hours they spend on dif-
ferent assignments because they aren’t sure how the organization will
use the information.
 Standard reports from the system may not present information in the
ways you need it to support your work-effort tracking.
If you decide to create your work-effort recording and storage capability, you
can consider developing a manual or computer-based system. Manual sys-
tems typically involve having people note in their daily calendars or personal
diaries the hours they spent on different activities. Unfortunately, data
recorded this way are often incomplete and inaccurate. In addition, you’ll
have difficulty pulling the data together to perform organized assessments
and prepare meaningful reports.
You can support a computer-based system with the following software:
 Project-management software, such as Microsoft Project
 Database software, such as Microsoft Access
 Spreadsheet software such, as Microsoft Excel
See Chapter 17 for a discussion of the potential uses and benefits of software
to support project management.
Monitoring expenditures
You monitor your project’s financial expenditures to verify that they’re in
accordance with the project plan and, if they’re not, to determine how to
address any deviations. You may think that you can determine project funds
used to date and funds remaining by just reading the balance in your pro-
ject’s financial account (the project’s checkbook). However, spending project
funds entails several steps before you actually pay for an item. As you com-
plete each step, you have a better sense of whether you will incur the expen-
diture and, if you do, its exact amount.
The process leading up to the disbursement of funds for goods and services
includes the following steps:
230
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

1. You include a rough estimate of the item’s cost in your project’s
budget.
You can develop this rough estimate from your prior experience, by
checking with others who have purchased similar items in the past, or
by checking with your procurement department. Usually, you don’t
check with specific vendors or supplies when developing this rough esti-
mate.
2. You submit a written, approved request for the item to your procure-
ment department.
This request should specify the rough estimate of the cost included in
your project budget and any upper limit that the actual cost can’t
exceed. The project manager or his designee approves it and anyone
else who controls the expenditure of project funds (such as the finance
department) approves it.
3. Your procurement department selects a vendor and submits a pur-
chase order.
The purchase order formally requests the vendor to furnish you the item
and specifies the procurement department’s most recent estimate of the
price.
4. The vendor agrees to provide the item you requested.
The vendor provides you written confirmation that he will sell you the
item, together with the item’s price and applicable taxes and shipping
and handling charges and projected delivery date.
5. You receive and accept the item but aren’t yet billed for it.
You receive the item and verify that it meets the agreed specifications. If
you don’t accept the item after the vendor makes repeated attempts to
fix any problems you have with it, your procurement department can-
cels the purchase order and you begin looking for a different vendor or a
different item that will meet your needs.
6. You or your finance department receives a bill for the item.
This bill details the item’s final cost, together with associated discounts,
taxes, and shipping and handling charges.
7. Your finance department disburses funds to pay for the item.
The bill for your item is paid with money from your project’s funds.
As you proceed from the first step to the last in this list, your estimate of the
item’s price becomes more accurate, and the likelihood that you’ll actually
make the purchase increases.
231
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

This list identifies every step in the procurement process. Depending on the
size of your purchase and the size and formality of your organization, you
may handle some of these stages informally for some purchases.
Responsive project monitoring requires you to have a clear idea of available
project funds at each stage of the process. To do so, you typically want to
monitor purchase requisitions, purchase orders, commitments (that is, pur-
chase orders or contracts that you and the contractor or vendor agreed to),
accounts payable, and expenditures. (Check out the sidebar “Following a pur-
chase through the process” for an example on how to recognize the different
steps in an actual procurement.)
Analyzing expenditures
You evaluate your project’s financial performance by comparing the actual
expenditures with those you planned. Figure 12-5 depicts a typical cost
report that presents expenditures for the current performance period and
from the beginning of the project for different levels of WBS activities. The
following information in this report comes from your project plan:

The actual numbers for the period come from the data you obtain during that
period. Actual in this illustration may mean the value of purchase requisitions,
purchase orders, commitments, accounts payable, and/or expenditures.
Earned Value Management (EVM) is a method of determining — from
resource expenditures alone — whether you’re over or under budget and
whether you’re ahead of or behind schedule. On complex projects, EVM is a
useful way to identify areas you should investigate for possible current prob-
lems or potential future problems. See Chapter 19 for further discussion of
Earned Value Management.
233
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
Following a purchase through the process
Suppose you identified in your plan that you
need to buy a new computer as soon as possi-
ble after your project starts. Based on your prior
experience and your familiarity with the mar-
ketplace, you budgeted $2,000 to purchase this
computer. As soon as your project starts, you
write a purchase requisition for the computer
and send it to the procurement department. You
describe the characteristics the computer
should have and put down an estimated price of
$2,000. At this point, you have $2,000 less to
spend on other purchases because, as far as
you know, you will have to pay this $2,000 to a
computer vendor at some point in the future.
After receiving your purchase request, your
procurement department checks with different
vendors, selects one, and issues a purchase
order for $1,920 (which includes the vendor’s
confirmed cost for the computer as well as
associated taxes and estimated shipping
charges). At this point, the procurement depart-
ment has confirmed that a vendor has agreed to
fill your request and has improved the accuracy
of your estimated cost for the computer.
As a result, you have more confidence that
you’ll receive the computer and a better sense
of its actual cost. When the vendor signs the
purchase order, he is confirming the intent to
deliver and the computer’s total cost.
After you receive the computer and check it out,
you have virtually erased all doubts about
receiving the computer, and when you receive
the bill for the computer, you know the cost.
Although the computer may malfunction or a
hidden cost may crop up, the likelihood is very
low.
Finally, after you pay the bill for the computer,
you’re almost certain that no portion of those
funds will be available for other purchases. You
may choose to return the computer at some
point in the future and receive a partial refund,
but the chances of that happening are slight.

Collecting expenditure data and improving its accuracy
Typically, you obtain your expenditure data from purchase requisitions, pur-
chase orders, vendor bills, and written checks. You normally see all purchase
requisitions because you probably have to approve them. The procurement
department typically prepares purchase orders, and you may be able to get
copies. Vendor bills usually go directly to the accounts payable group in the
finance department, and these people pay the checks. You may be able to
have the finance department send copies of bills to you to verify the amounts
and so forth, and you can request reports of all checks from your project
fund if the finance department tracks expenditures by project code.
The following can increase the accuracy of your project’s expenditure data:
 To avoid double-counting an expenditure, be sure that you remove pur-
chase orders from your totals after you receive the bill (or verify that
payment has been made).
 Be sure to include the correct WBS charge code on each purchase requi-
sition.
 Verify that the purchase order also includes the correct WBS charge
code.
 Periodically remove void or cancelled purchase requisitions and pur-
chase orders from your lists of outstanding purchase requisitions and
purchase orders.
Choosing a vehicle to support your expenditure tracking system
Before developing your own system to monitor your project’s expenditures,
first check the nature and capabilities of your organization’s financial track-
ing system. Most organizations have a financial system that maintains
records of all expenditures. Often the system also maintains records of
accounts payable. Unfortunately, many financial systems categorize expenses
by cost center but don’t have the capacity to classify expenses by project or
activity within a project.
If you have to develop your own system for tracking project expenditures,
consider using the following types of software:
 Integrated project-management package, such as Microsoft Project
 Accounting package, such as QuickBooks
 Database package, such as Microsoft Access
 Spreadsheet package, such as Microsoft Excel
234
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

See Chapter 17 for more information on the potential uses and benefits of
software to support project management.
Even if your organization’s financial system can classify expenditures by
activity within a project, you probably have to develop your own system for
tracking purchase requisitions and purchase orders. Consider using a spread-
sheet program or database software to support this tracking.
Putting Your Control Process into Action
The previous sections tell you how to set up the systems that provide you
the necessary information to guide your project. This section tells you how
to systematically use those systems to consistently monitor and guide your
project’s performance.
Heading off problems before they occur
Great project plans often fall by the wayside when well-intentioned people try
on their own to achieve the best possible results. They may spend more
hours than the plan allowed, hoping the additional work can produce better
results. They may ask people who weren’t in the original plan to work on the
project, hoping these people’s expertise can improve the quality of the pro-
ject results. Or they may spend more money for an item than the budget
allowed, believing the new choice to be of higher quality.
If possible, set up procedures at the start of your project that prevent people
from exceeding established budgets without prior approval. For example, if
people record the number of hours they spend on each project activity:
 Confirm with them the number of hours they may charge to each activ-
ity before they start it.
 Arrange for the time-recording system to reject attempts to charge more
hours than planned for an activity unless the person has your prior writ-
ten approval.
 Arrange for the time-recording system to reject any project hours by
unauthorized people.
235
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

For purchases of equipment, materials, supplies, and services:
 Confirm anticipated purchases, the upper limits for cost of individual
items (if any), and the upper limit on the total expenditures.
 Arrange for the procurement office or financial system to reject attempts
to overspend these limits without your prior written approval.
A change to your project’s budget may be necessary and desirable. However,
you want to make that decision with full awareness of the change’s effect on
other aspects of the project.
Formalizing your control process
To guide your project throughout its performance, establish procedures to
collect and submit the required information, to assess work and results, to
take corrective actions when needed, and to keep audiences informed of your
project’s status. Follow these procedures throughout your project’s life.
1. At the start of a performance period, reconfirm with people their
commitments and your expectations.
(See the earlier section “Controlling your project”.)
2. During the period, have people record schedule performance data,
work effort, and purchase requisitions and purchase orders they
issue.
(See the earlier sections “Collecting schedule performance data,”
“Collecting work effort data,” and “Collecting expenditure data and
improving its accuracy” for more details.)
3. At agreed-upon intervals during or at the end of the period, have
people submit their activity performance, expenditure, and work-
effort data either to all relevant organizational systems or to systems
specially maintained for your project.
4. At the end of the period, enter people’s tracking data into the appro-
priate PMIS, compare actual performance for the period with planned
performance, identify any problems, formulate and take corrective
actions, and keep people informed.
(See the sections “Getting back on track: Rebaselining,” “Identifying pos-
sible causes of delays and variances,” and “Identifying possible correc-
tive actions” for more details.)
5. At the beginning of the next performance period, start the cycle
again.
236
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Monitoring project performance doesn’t identify problems; it identifies symp-
toms. When you identify a symptom, you must investigate the situation to
determine the nature of any underlying problems, the reasons for the prob-
lems, and how to fix them.
But you can’t get an accurate picture of where your project stands by moni-
toring only one or two aspects of your project. You must consider your pro-
ject’s performance in all three of its dimensions — outcomes produced,
activity time frames, and resources used — together to determine the rea-
sons for any inconsistencies you identify.
Suppose a member of your project team spent half as much time working on
a project activity during the period as you had planned for it. Does this mean
you have a problem? You really can’t tell. If he accomplished all his planned
events and the quality of his products met the established standards, then
perhaps not.
If he didn’t accomplish some events or the quality of his products was
subpar, a problem may exist. You must consider product quality and sched-
ule achievement together with the discrepancy between planned and actual
work hours to determine whether your project actually has a problem.
Identifying possible causes of delays 
and variances
After you confirm that a problem exists, bringing your project back on track
requires that you first understand what caused the problem. The following
circumstances may cause schedule delays:
 People spent less time during the performance period on the activity
than they agreed to.
 The activity is requiring more work effort than you figured.
 People are expanding the scope of the activity.
 Steps you hadn’t identified are necessary to complete the activity.
 The people working on the activity have less experience with similar
activities than you anticipated.
237
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

The following situations may result in people charging more or less time to
activities than you planned:
 The person performing the work is more or less productive than you
assumed when you developed the plan (see Chapter 6 for a discussion
of productivity).
 You allowed insufficient time for becoming familiar with the activity
before starting to work on it.
 The person is more or less efficient than you considered (see Chapter 6
for a discussion of efficiency).
 The activity is requiring more or less work than you anticipated.
You may spend more or less on your project activities than you planned for
the following reasons:
 You received the bills for goods or services later than you planned, so
they’re paid later than you planned.
 You prepaid for certain items to receive special discounts.
 You didn’t need certain goods or services that you had budgeted for in
your plan.
 You needed goods or services that you hadn’t budgeted for in your plan.
Identifying possible corrective actions
When your project’s performance deviates from your plan, first try to bring
your project back in accordance with the existing plan, and second, if neces-
sary, investigate formally changing some of the commitments in the existing
plan to create a new plan.
Consider the following approaches for bringing a project back in line with its
existing plan:
 If the variance results from a one-time occurrence, see whether it will
disappear on its own. Suppose you had planned to spend 40 person-
hours to buy a piece of equipment but you actually spent 10 person-
hours. You figured you’d have to visit four stores before you found the
equipment, but you found exactly what you wanted for the price you
wanted to pay at the first store. Don’t immediately change your plan to
reallocate the 30 person-hours you saved on this activity. Most likely
you’ll wind up overspending slightly on some future activities and the
work effort expenditures will tend to even each other out.
238
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 If the variance suggests a situation that will lead to similar variances
in the future, consider changing your plan to prevent the future vari-
ances from occurring. Suppose a team member required twice the allot-
ted work effort to finish her assignment because she’s less experienced
than the plan anticipated. If her lack of experience will continue to cause
her to be less productive on future assignments, revise the plan to
increase the amount of effort you plan for her to spend on those assign-
ments. (See Chapter 5 for information on how to reduce the time to com-
plete a project and Chapter 6 for a discussion of how to modify
personnel assignments.)
Getting back on track: Rebaselining
A baseline is the current version of your project plan that guides project per-
formance and provides a standard for comparing your actual project perfor-
mance. Rebaselining is officially adopting a new project plan to guide activities
and serve as the comparative basis for future performance assessments.
If you feel that revising your plan and adopting a new baseline is necessary,
 Consult with key project audiences to explain why the changes are nec-
essary and to solicit the audiences’ approval and support.
 Make sure all key project audiences know about the new baseline.
 Keep a copy of your original plan and all subsequent modifications to
support your final performance assessment when the project is over.
Rebaselining is a last resort when project work isn’t going according to plan.
Exhaust all possible strategies and approaches to get back on track before you
attempt to change the plan itself. (Check out Chapter 5 for information about
changing the order and durations of activities to make up for unexpected
delays and Chapter 6 for details on reallocating work effort to activities.)
Reacting Responsibly When 
Changes Are Requested
No matter how carefully you plan, occurrences you hadn’t anticipated will
most likely happen during your project. Perhaps an activity turns out to be
more involved than you figured, client needs and desires change, or new
technology evolves. When situations such as these arise, you may need to
change some aspects of your project to respond to these new conditions.
239
Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control

Even though change is necessary and desirable, it always comes at a price.
Furthermore, different people may have different opinions about which
changes are important and how to implement them.
This section helps you manage changes in your project. It provides some
helpful steps to follow when considering and acting upon a change request. It
also looks at scope creep and how you can avoid it.
Responding to change requests
On large projects, formal change-control systems govern how you can assess
and act on requests for changes. Whether you handle change requests for-
mally or informally, however, always follow these steps:
1. When you receive a request for change to some aspect of your project,
clarify exactly what the request is asking you to do.
2. If possible, ask for the request in writing or confirm your understand-
ing of the request by writing it down yourself.
(In a formal change-control system, people must submit all requests for
changes on a change-request form.)
3. Determine the potential effect of the change on all aspects of your
project.
Also consider what may happen if you don’t make the change.
4. Decide whether you’ll implement the change.
If this change affects other people, involve them in the decision too.
5. If you decide not to make the change, tell the requester and explain
the reason(s).
6. If you decide to make the change, write down the necessary steps to
implement the change.
(In a formal change-control system, all aspects of a change are detailed
in a written change order.)
7. Update your project’s plan to reflect any changes in schedules, out-
comes, or resource budgets as a result.
8. Tell team members and appropriate audiences about the change and
the effect you expect it to have on your project.
Observe the following guidelines to ensure that you can smoothly incorpo-
rate changes into your project:
240
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Don’t use the possibility of changes as an excuse for not being thor-
ough and detailed in your original planning. Be as accurate and com-
plete as possible when you prepare your project plan to save time and
money in the future.
 Remember that change always has a cost. Don’t ignore that cost, figur-
ing you have to make the change no matter what the cost is. Determine
the cost of the change so you can plan for it and, if possible, minimize it.
 Assess the effect of change on all aspects of your project. Maintain a
broad perspective — a change early in your project may affect your pro-
ject from beginning to end.
Creeping away from scope creep
Scope creep is the gradual expansion of project work without formal acknowl-
edgment and acceptance of these changes or their associated costs and
effects. Scope creep can occur due to the following:
 Lack of clarity and detail in the original description of project scope,
objectives, and work
 Willingness to make small changes to a project without formal review
and approval
 Allowing the people who don’t do the work associated with the changes
to decide whether to make changes
 Feeling that you should never say “No” to a client
 Personal pride that encourages you to believe you can do anything
Control scope creep by the following:
 Identifying all project objectives in your project plan and describing
them in sufficient detail
 Always assessing the effect of requested changes on project products,
schedules, and resources
 Sharing your true feelings about whether you can implement the
requested changes
 Developing positive, mutually trusting relationships with your clients so
they’re more receptive when you raise issues associated with the
requested changes

In This Chapter
 Choosing how to share the news: Writing or meeting?
 Authoring your project progress report
 Managing an assortment of meeting styles
I
magine standing at one end of a large room filled with assorted sofas,
chairs, and tables. You’ve accepted a challenge to walk to the other end
without bumping into any of the furniture. But, as you set off on your excur-
sion, the lights go off, and you now have to complete your trip in total dark-
ness, with only your memory of the room’s layout to guide you.
Sounds like a pretty tough assignment, doesn’t it? How much easier it would
be if the lights went on every few seconds — you could see exactly where
you were, where you had to go, and where the furniture got in the way. The
walk would still be challenging but much more successful than in total dark-
ness.
Surprisingly, many projects are just like that walk across the room. People
plan how they’ll perform the project — who will do what, by when, and for
how much — and they share this information with the team members and
other people who will support the project. But as soon as the project work
begins, people receive no information about their progress, the work remain-
ing, or obstacles that may lie ahead.
Effective communication is a key to successful projects — sharing the right
messages with the right people in a timely manner. Informative communica-
tions support the following:
 Continued buy-in and support from key audiences and team members
 Prompt problem identification and decision-making
 A clear project focus
 Ongoing recognition of project achievements
 Productive working relationships among team members

Planning your project communications upfront enables you to choose the
appropriate media for sharing different messages. This chapter can help you
keep everyone in the loop so they know your project’s status.
Choosing the Appropriate Medium
When deciding how to communicate with your team and your project’s audi-
ences (check out Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of these audiences),
choosing the right medium is as important as deciding what information to
share. This choice ensures that people get the information they need when
they need it.
Project communications come in two forms:
 Formal communications are preplanned, conducted in a standard
format in accordance with an established schedule. Examples include
weekly team meetings and monthly progress reports.
 Informal communications occur as people think of information they
want to share. Informal communications occur continuously in the
normal course of business. Examples include brief conversations by the
water cooler and e-mails you dash off during a day.
Take care not to rely on informal interchanges to share important information
about your project because they often involve only a small number of the
people who should hear what you have to say. To minimize the chances for
misunderstandings and hurt feelings:
 Confirm in writing any important information that you share in informal
discussions.
 Avoid having an informal discussion with only some of the people who
are involved in the topic.
Both formal and informal communications can be written or oral. The following
sections suggest when to use each format and how to make it most effective.
Just the facts: Written reports
Written reports enable you to present factual data more efficiently, choose
your words to minimize misunderstandings, provide a historical record of the
information you share, and share the same message with a wide audience.
244
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

However, written reports do have drawbacks. They don’t allow your audience
to ask questions to clarify the content, meaning, and implication of your mes-
sage. With written reports, you can’t verify that your audience received and
interpreted your message as you intended. In addition, reports don’t enable
you to pick up nonverbal signals that suggest your audience’s reactions to
the message, and they don’t support interactive discussion and brainstorm-
ing about your message. Most important, you may never know whether your
audience even read the report!
Keep the following pointers in mind to improve the chances that people read
and understand your written reports:
 Prepare regularly scheduled reports in a standard format. This consis-
tency helps your audience find specific types of information quickly.
 Stay focused. Preparing several short reports to address different topics
is better than combining several topics into one long report. People are
more likely to pick up the important information about each topic.
 Minimize the use of technical jargon and acronyms. If a person is unfa-
miliar with the language in your report, she’ll miss at least some of your
messages.
 Use written reports to share facts, and be sure to identify a person or
people to contact for clarification or further discussion of any infor-
mation in those reports. Written reports present hard data with a mini-
mum of subjective interpretation, and they provide a useful, permanent
reference. A contact person can address any questions a recipient has
about the information or the reasons for sharing it.
 Clearly describe any actions you want people to take based on infor-
mation in the report. The more specifically you explain what you want
people to do, the more likely they’ll do it.
 Use novel approaches to emphasize key information. For example,
print key sections in a different color or on colored paper, or mention
particularly relevant or important sections in a cover memo. This addi-
tional effort increases the chances that your audience will see the report
and read it.
 After you send your report, discuss one or two key points that you
addressed in the report with people who received it. This follow-up
conversation can quickly tell you whether they’ve read it.
 Keep your reports to one page if possible. If not, include a short sum-
mary (one page or less) at the beginning of the report (check out the
nearby sidebar “Keep it short, and that means you!”).
245
Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed

Refer to “Preparing a Written Project-Progress Report” later in this chapter
for specifics on writing this special type of communication.
Move it along: Meetings that work
Few words elicit the same reactions of anger and frustration that the word
meeting can provoke. People consider meetings to be everything from the
last vestige of interpersonal contact in an increasingly technical society to
the biggest time-waster in business today.
You’ve probably been in meetings where you wanted to bang your head
against the wall. Ever been to a meeting that didn’t start on time? How about
a meeting that didn’t have an agenda or didn’t stick to the agenda it did have?
Or how about a meeting where people discussed issues you thought were
resolved at a previous meeting?
Meetings don’t have to be painful experiences. If you plan and manage them
well, meetings can be effective. They can help you find out about other team
members’ backgrounds, experiences, and styles; stimulate brainstorming,
problem analysis, and decision-making; and provide a forum to explore the
reasons and interpretations of a message.
246
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Keep it short, and that means you!
Be careful of the “yes, but” syndrome — where
you think an idea sounds great for others, but
your special situation requires a different
approach. In a training program a number of
years ago, I shared my suggestion to keep pro-
ject reports to one page or less. Most people
agreed that doing so made sense, but one par-
ticipant rejected the notion. He proceeded to
explain that his project was so important and so
complex that he sent his boss monthly project
reports that were a minimum of ten pages in
length. “And,” he added, “my boss reads every
word.”
I had the opportunity to speak with this partici-
pant’s boss a few weeks after the training ses-
sion about a totally unrelated matter. In the
course of our conversation, he happened to
mention his frustration with a person on his staff
who felt his project was so important that he
had to submit monthly progress reports no less
than ten pages long. He said that he usually
read the first paragraph, but he rarely had time
to review them thoroughly. He added that he
hoped this person had listened carefully when I
suggested that reports should be one page or
less!

You can improve your meetings by using the suggestions in the following 
sections.
Planning for a successful meeting
In order to have a good meeting, you need to do some preplanning. Keep
these pointers in mind:
 Clarify the purpose of the meeting. This step helps ensure that you
invite the right people and allows attendees to prepare for the meeting.
 Decide who needs to attend and why. If you need information, decide
who has it. If you want to make decisions at the meeting, decide who has
the necessary authority and make sure that person attends.
 Give plenty of advance notice of the meeting. This step increases the
chances that the people you want to attend will be available.
 Let the people who should attend the meeting know its purpose.
People are more likely to attend a meeting if they understand why their
attendance is important.
 Prepare a written agenda that includes topics and their allotted times.
This document helps people see why attending the meeting is in their
interests. The agenda is also your guideline for running the meeting.
 Circulate the written agenda and any background material in
advance. This gives everyone time to suggest changes to the agenda
and to plan for the meeting.
 Keep meetings to one hour or less. You can force people to sit in a room
for hours, but you can’t force them to keep their minds on the activities
and information. If necessary, schedule several meetings of one hour or
less to discuss complex issues or multiple topics.
Conducting an efficient meeting
How you conduct the meeting can make or break it. The following are essen-
tials for conducting a productive meeting:
 Start on time, even if people are absent. After people see that you wait
for latecomers, everyone will come late!
 Assign a timekeeper. This person reminds the group when a topic has
exceeded its allotted time.
 Take written minutes of who attended, the items you discussed, and
the decisions and assignments the group made. This procedure allows
people to review and clarify the information and serves as a reminder of
actions to be taken after the meeting.
247
Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed

 Keep a list of action items that need further exploration, and assign
one person to be responsible for each entry. This step helps ensure
that when you meet to discuss these issues again, you have the right
information and people present to resolve them.
 If you don’t have the right information or the right people to resolve
an issue, stop your discussion and put it on the action item list.
Discussing an issue without having the necessary information or the
right people present is just wasting people’s time.
 End on time. Your meeting attendees may have other commitments that
begin when your meeting is supposed to end. Not ending on time causes
these people to be late for their next commitments or to leave your
meeting before it’s over.
Following up with the last details
Your meeting may be over, but your work isn’t done. Make sure you complete
the following tasks to get the greatest benefit from the session.
 Promptly distribute meeting minutes to all attendees. These minutes
allow people to reaffirm the information when it’s still fresh in their
minds, and minutes quickly remind people of their follow-up tasks.
 Monitor the status of all action items that are performed after the
meeting. Because each action is itself a miniproject, monitoring its
progress will increase the chances that people successfully complete it.
 Don’t just talk about these suggestions. Discussing these ideas can’t
improve your meetings. Act on them!
Preparing a Written Project-Progress
Report
The project-progress report is a project’s most common written communica-
tion. The report reviews activities performed during a performance period,
describes problems encountered and the corrective actions planned and
taken, and previews plans for the next period.
This section helps you identify the audience for your project-progress report,
provides pointers on report contents, and suggests improvements for that
content so it doesn’t put your team to sleep.
248
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Making a list (of names), 
checking it twice
A project-progress report is a convenient way to keep key audiences involved
in your project and informed of their responsibilities. Decide who should get
regularly scheduled project-progress reports by answering the following
questions:
 Who needs to know about your project?
 Who wants to know about your project?
 Whom do you want to know about your project?
At a minimum, consider providing project-progress reports to your supervi-
sor, upper management, client or customer, project team members, and other
people who will be helping you on the project, as well as to people who are
interested in or will be affected by the project’s results.
Knowing what’s hot, what’s not 
in your report
Preparing the report gives you an opportunity to step back and review all
aspects of your project so you can recognize accomplishments and identify
situations that may require your early intervention. Be sure to include some
or all of the following information in your project-progress report:
 Performance highlights: Always begin your report with a summary of
highlights. (Keep it to one page!)
 Performance details: Describe the activities, outcomes, milestones,
labor hours, and resource expenditures in detail.
 Problems and issues: Highlight special issues or problems that you
encountered during the period and propose any necessary corrective
actions.
 Approved changes to the plan: Report all approved changes to the
existing project plan.
 Risk-management status: Update your project risk assessment by
reporting on changes in project assumptions, the likelihood of these
updated assumptions occurring, and the effect of those updated
assumptions on existing project plans.
 Plans for the next period: Summarize major work and accomplishments
that you have planned for the next performance period.
249
Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed

Earning a Pulitzer, or at least writing 
an interesting report
When writing your report, remember that you don’t want it to end up as a
bird-cage liner. Write the report so it’s interesting and tells the appropriate
people what they need to know. Use the following tips to improve the quality
of your project-progress reports:
 Tailor your reports to the interests and needs of your audiences.
Provide only the information that your audience wants and needs. If nec-
essary, prepare separate reports for different audiences.
 If you’re preparing different progress reports for different audiences,
prepare the most detailed one first and extract information from that
report to produce the others. This approach ensures consistency
among the reports and reduces the likelihood that you’ll perform the
same work more than once.
 Produce a project-progress report at least once a month, no matter
what your audience’s request. Monitoring and sharing information
about project progress less often than once per month significantly
increases the chances of major damage resulting from an unidentified
problem.
 Make sure that all product, schedule, and resource information in
your report is for the same time period. Accomplishing this may not be
easy if you depend on different organization systems for your raw per-
formance data.
If you track project schedule performance on a system that you maintain
yourself, you may be able to produce a status report by the end of the
first week after the performance period. However, your organization’s
financial system, which you use to track project expenditures, may not
generate performance reports for the same period until a month later.
Address this issue in your project’s start-up phase (see Chapter 11 for
suggested start-up activities.). Determine your sources for status data,
the dates your updated data is available from each source, and the time
periods that those data apply to. Then schedule your combined analysis
and reporting so that all data describe the same time period.
 Always compare actual performance with respect to the performance
plan. Presenting the information in this format highlights issues that you
need to address.
 Include no surprises. If an element requires prompt action during the
period (like a key person unexpectedly leaving the project team), imme-
diately tell all the people involved and work to address the problem.
However, be sure to mention the occurrence and any corrective actions
in the progress report to provide a written record.
250
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Use your regularly scheduled team meetings to discuss issues and
problems that you raise in the project-progress report. Discuss any
questions people have about the information in the project-progress
report. (However, don’t read verbatim to people from the written report
that they’ve already received!)
Holding Key Project Meetings
Active, ongoing support from all major project audiences gives you the great-
est chance for achieving project success. Continually reinforce your project’s
vision and how you’re progressing toward it, and help your project’s audi-
ences understand when and how they can most effectively support your
efforts. This section looks more closely at the three types of meetings you
may hold during your project.
Regularly scheduled team meetings
Regularly scheduled team meetings give members an opportunity to share
progress and issues and to sustain productive and trusting interpersonal
relationships. These meetings also provide an opportunity to reaffirm the
project’s focus and to keep members abreast of activities within and outside
the project that affect their work and the project’s ultimate success.
Recognizing that most people work on several projects at the same time,
these meetings can reinforce the team’s identity and working relationships.
Consult with team members to develop a meeting schedule that’s convenient
for as many people as possible. If some people can’t attend in person, try to
have them participate in a conference call. (See Chapter 17 for more about
how you can use technology to support your project.)
In addition to the suggestions for productive meetings in the “Move it along:
Meetings that work” section earlier in this chapter, observe the following
guidelines when planning and conducting team meetings:
 Even though the meetings are regularly held, always prepare a specific
agenda, distribute it beforehand, and solicit comments and suggestions
before the meeting.
 Before the meeting, distribute the progress report (take a look at the
previous section, “Preparing a Written Project-Progress Report,” for
details of this report) for the most recent performance period.
251
Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed

 Distribute beforehand any other background information related to
topics on the agenda.
 Limit discussions that require more in-depth consideration; deal with
them in other forums.
 Start on time and end on time (there, I said it again!).
 Prepare and distribute brief minutes of the meeting.
252
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Using a project dashboard
To make your written project-progress reports
most effective, you want to include the greatest
amount of information in the least amount of
space. A project dashboard is an information
display that depicts key indicators of project
performance in a format that resembles an
instrument panel on a dashboard This format
can convey the project’s overall progress and
highlight particular problems that require fur-
ther attention.
When designing a dashboard for your project,
take the following steps:
1. Select the major categories of information.
2. Choose specific indicators for each infor-
mation category.
3. Select the format for each indicator.
Typical information categories that reflect
important aspects of project performance
include
 Results: Desired products your team has
produced to date
 Performance to schedule: Dates that your
team achieved milestones and started and
completed activities compared with the
schedule plan for milestones and activities
 Performance to resource budgets: Labor
hours, funds, and other resources your
team has used to date compared with their
budgeted amounts
 Risk management: Current status of factors
that may unexpectedly impede project per-
formance
Choose specific indicators for each category in
conjunction with the project’s drivers and sup-
porters.
As an example, a project that develops an oper-
ations manual for a piece of equipment may
have the following indicators:
Results: The number of manual chapters
written or the number of obtained approvals
for the final manual
Performance to schedule: The number of
milestone dates you’ve met and the number
you’ve missed
Performance to resource budgets: The ratio
of actual funds expended to those budgeted
for all completed activities
Management of risk: The number of origi-
nal risks that may still occur or the number
of new risks you’ve identified during the
project
You can display indicators in a table, bar graph,
pie chart, or speedometer format. See the fol-
lowing figure that illustrates the types of dis-
plays in a project dashboard.

253
Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
In addition, indicators often have a traffic light
format:
Green light: The element is proceeding
according to plan.
Yellow light: One or more minor problems
exist.
Red light: One or more serious situations
require immediate attention.
Determine the specific criteria for green-,
yellow-, and red-light status for each indicator
in consultation with the project’s drivers and
supporters.
When creating a dashboard for your project, be
sure to
 Work with the intended audiences of a
report to select the categories, indicators,
and their display formats.
 Always present actual indicator values
alongside planned values.
 Keep the project dashboard report to one
page or less.

Ad hoc team meetings
Hold ad hoc team meetings to address specific issues that arise during
your project. An ad hoc meeting may involve some or all of your team’s
members, depending on the topic. Because issues often arise unexpect-
edly, do the following:
 Clarify the issue and what you hope to achieve at your meeting.
 Identify and invite all people who may be interested in, affected
by, or working on the issue.
 Clearly explain the meeting’s purpose to all invitees.
 Carefully document all action items that the attendees develop at
the meeting and assign responsibility for their completion.

 Be sure to share the results of an ad hoc meeting with all team members
who may be affected by the results, who have an interest in them, and
whose support you need to implement them.
Upper-management progress reviews
An upper-management progress review is usually presided over by a senior
manager, run by a project manager, and attended by team members and rep-
resentatives of all functional areas. This review allows you to tell upper man-
agement about your project’s status, its major accomplishments, and issues
that require their help. The review is also an opportunity for you to note
ways to keep the project in line with major organization initiatives.
Take every opportunity to help upper management remember why your pro-
ject is important to them. They may have approved your project only months
ago, but chances are your project’s now just one of many activities in your
busy organization.
Make your upper-management progress review effective by observing the fol-
lowing tips:
 Identify the interests of your audience and explain how your project is
meeting those interests.
 Keep your presentation short; choose a few key messages and empha-
size them.
 Highlight your key information, but be prepared to go into more detail
on issues if they ask you to do so.
 Allow time for questions.
 Present updated information on project risks and how you’re addressing
them.
 Distribute a brief handout at the meeting that summarizes the key points
of your presentation.
 After the meeting, distribute notes that highlight issues raised and
actions that you agreed on at the session.

Encouraging Peak Performance
by Providing Effective Leadership
In This Chapter
 Clarifying the difference between management and leadership
 Tapping into the different sources of power
 Developing and maintaining motivation
L
eadership is one of the most important issues facing organizations today
because of the rapid changes that are occurring in every facet of our
lives. As a result, a large body of literature has emerged that explores how to
guide people to achieve common goals in a wide variety of settings.
When working in a matrix environment (see Chapter 9 for more specifics about
the matrix structure), your project’s success depends on your ability to orga-
nize, coordinate, and support a diverse team that’s working toward a common
goal. Often these people come from different areas of your organization, have
different operating styles, and don’t report to you administratively. Successfully
guiding such a group of people requires both vision and structure.
This chapter discusses tips for aligning, focusing, and motivating the people
supporting your project to maximize the chances for your project’s success.
Practicing Management and Leadership
Leadership and management are two related but distinct sets of behaviors
for guiding and supporting people through the stages of a project.
Management focuses on creating plans and assessing performance; leadership
emphasizes defining a vision and encouraging other people to help make that
vision a reality. Management focuses on systems, procedures, and informa-
tion; leadership focuses on people. Management creates order and pre-
dictability; leadership facilitates change.

When planning your project, explore the why of the project (a leadership
issue) to help elicit people’s buy-in and commitment. Also explore the what,
when, and how (management issues) to develop a feasible approach for suc-
cessfully achieving the project’s goals. When organizing your project, clarify
who will support the different project activities (a management task) and
help them get excited about doing it (a leadership task).
Continually let people know how the project is progressing and deal with any
problems you encounter along the way (management tasks); and remind
people of the project’s benefits and acknowledge their contributions to the
project’s success (leadership tasks). Table 14-1 illustrates leadership and
management approaches to support the key stages of a project.

Developing Personal Power and Influence
Power is the ability to influence the actions of others. Establishing effective
bases of power enhances your ability to coordinate your team and other key
audiences. In this section, I tell you how to develop your personal power
bases and how to use the power you can derive from these bases to energize
and motivate people throughout the life of your project.
256
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Understanding why people 
will do what you ask
Because personal power is the ability to influence and guide the actions of
others, the first step in developing this power is to understand the different
reasons people may choose to do what you ask.
People respond to your requests and directions for different reasons:
 Rewards: People do what you ask because they want the benefits you
can give them. Examples of rewards include raises and recognition.
 Punishments: People do what you ask because they don’t want what you
can give them. Examples of punishments include poor performance
appraisals and undesirable job assignments.
 Your position: People take your requests more seriously because they
feel the project manager should direct team members. You can lose this
power if you behave inappropriately, but you have it initially.
 What you stand for: People do what you ask because they agree with
your goals. They know that your requests and actions are attempts to
achieve the same results that they want.
 Who you are: People listen to you because they appreciate and respect
who you are, as reflected by your sensitivity, your loyalty to others, your
sense of humor, or other characteristics of your behavior.
 Your expertise: People listen to you because they respect the skills and
knowledge that you bring to your job. They listen to you because they
believe you’re probably right.
You don’t have to be the technical expert on your project to command the
respect of your team members. But you do need to be an expert in the skills
and knowledge that your job demands on the project. Because you’re the
project manager, these skills and knowledge include your ability to plan and
control the project, encourage effective communication, encourage a positive
and productive work environment, and understand the political environment
in your overall organization.
Being both the technical expert and the project manager on your project can
work against you. If you’re not careful, you can discourage others from
accepting responsibilities and performing their work independently because
257
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance

 They feel that their work can never be as good as yours.
 You keep the challenging and important assignments for yourself
because you like the work and think you can do it best.
 You resist approaches that differ from the ones you normally take.
 You tend to micromanage people to ensure that they’re performing
assignments just as you would.
Of course, your technical expertise can be a significant asset if you use it cor-
rectly. Your praise for a job well done means a lot more than praise from
someone who is less qualified to assess the work.
Although many factors can contribute to your ability to influence people,
your power over other people is generally
 Ascribed: Someone gives you authority to reward and punish others.
 Achieved: You earn the respect and allegiance of other people.
Achieved power is far more effective than ascribed power. People who act in
response to your ascribed power usually do the least necessary to get the
rewards they want or to avoid the consequences they fear. On the other
hand, people motivated by your achieved power will work to accomplish the
highest possible quality of results because they’ve decided that doing so is in
their best interests.
Whether you recognize and acknowledge it, you have considerable opportu-
nity to develop and use achieved power. You can choose how you want to
influence people’s behavior, or you can inadvertently influence their behavior.
But either way, your actions do influence people’s behavior.
Establishing the bases of your power
You can get a sense of the power you have over someone by the willingness
with which she agrees to do and then does what you request. If you already
get all the cooperation from others that you need, just keep doing what
you’re doing. However, if you feel frustrated by people’s resistance and lack
of cooperation when you ask for their help, take steps to improve the power
you have over them.
Successfully influencing the behavior of others requires that you first under-
stand the different power that you potentially have over them and second,
that you effectively use that power. Your ascribed power over people
depends, in part, on people’s perceptions of the specific authority you and
others whom you can influence have over them. Your achieved power is
based upon people’s perceptions of what you know, who you are, and what
you stand for.
258
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Take the following steps to improve your ability to influence your team mem-
bers and other people in your project environment:
 Determine the authority you have over the people you want to influ-
ence. Common types of authority include the ability to give salary
increases and promotions, complete performance appraisals, and assign
people to future jobs.
 Find out who else has authority over the people you want to influ-
ence. If you don’t make the decision about whether and how much to
increase a person’s salary but you can influence the individual who
does, the person will react to you as if you, too, had some measure of
ascribed power over him.
259
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance
Getting what you asked for
People tend to believe what we say when they
don’t have a good reason to disbelieve.
Unfortunately, we often say exactly what we
don’t want people to believe or do — and then
we’re surprised when they listen to us.
When I was in high school, my social life wasn’t
all that great. Years later, I thought about my
experiences — the frustrations and disappoint-
ments. The more I thought about it, the more
convinced I was that my approach was a major
reason for my lack of success. Here’s an exam-
ple of a typical phone conversation when I
called a girl to ask her out on a date:
“Hi, this is Stan Portny.”
“Hi, Stan.”
“Say, I don’t suppose you’d want to go out
with me Saturday night, would you?”
“I hadn’t thought about it, but I guess you’re
right. I don’t.”
I’d hang up the phone, depressed and con-
vinced that I’d never be able to get a girl to go
out with me. In retrospect, although I didn’t real-
ize it, I had actually succeeded in getting the girl
to do the very thing I had suggested!
I related this story to a friend a while back, and
my friend immediately agreed with my observa-
tion. He then asked the key question: “Why do
we say the very things we don’t want people to
hear?” After much discussion, we agreed that
the reason is either fear of success (what would
I say if I were alone on a date with her for three
hours?) or fear of failure (trying to minimize the
pain of being rejected). Unfortunately, by trying
to minimize the pain of failure, we wind up essen-
tially guaranteeing that we’ll experience it.
This behavior is frequent in project manage-
ment. On a new project, the project manager
immediately gives all the reasons why the pro-
ject may not work and, even if the team com-
pletes it, why the results won’t be as great as
everyone thinks. Then he wonders why the pro-
ject team doesn’t commit to the project’s suc-
cess! If you want to succeed, you have to be
willing to declare your commitment to your goal
and devote all of your efforts to achieving it,
even though there’s always a chance that you
won’t reach it.

 Clarify for yourself why the project’s successful completion is in your
organization’s interest, and share those reasons with other. You’ll be
in a better position to help another person see why it would be in her
best interest to help you complete your project, if you know all the bene-
fits your project is designed to yield.
 Get to know the people you want to influence; understand, appreci-
ate, and acknowledge their special talents and strengths. Getting to
know other people helps you understand the types of rewards and
recognition they would appreciate most. It also tells them you care for
them as people, not just as technical resources for your project.
 Let these people get to know your good side. Your achieved power
over others is based on their perceptions of your character and abilities.
 Don’t condemn or complain, but do give feedback when necessary.
Condemning is making negative judgments about others, and complain-
ing is criticizing people or things without doing anything to improve
them. Both entail sharing negative opinions rather than facts, which
demoralizes and demotivates people, while doing little to achieve high-
quality results. Constructive feedback, however, entails sharing factual
information to improve people’s performance. People respect others
who they feel are interested in helping them succeed.
 Become proficient in the tasks you have to perform. People listen to
you more seriously if they feel you know what you’re talking about.
You must reestablish your bases of power for each new project you perform
because you’re dealing with different people and your power bases depend
heavily on the specific details of the project itself. Further, your bases of
power can diminish over time if you don’t consistently reinforce them.
Meeting with team members at the start of your project can help them appre-
ciate your style and recognize that all of you want to accomplish similar
goals. However, if you don’t have contact with those members for six months,
their initial positive impressions can fade — right along with your ability to
influence their commitment and performance.
Creating and Sustaining 
Team-Member Motivation
Efficient processes and smooth relationships at work create the opportunity
for successful projects. And having team members personally commit to your
project’s success gives you the greatest chance of achieving it. Therefore,
your major task as a project manager is to encourage every member to be
motivated and committed to the project’s success.
260
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Motivation is a personal choice — the only person you can motivate directly
is yourself. You can create the opportunity for other people to become moti-
vated, but you can’t make the decision for them. Four factors encourage a
person to become and remain motivated to achieve a goal:
 Desirability: The value of achieving the goal
 Feasibility: The likelihood that you can achieve the goal
 Progress: Your accomplishments as you work to reach your goal
 Reward: The payoff when you reach the goal
When your project meets people’s professional and personal needs in each of
these four areas, you strengthen their commitment to help the project suc-
ceed. In this section, I show you specific ways to meet these needs.
Increasing commitment by clarifying 
your project’s benefits
Although some people commit to completing an assignment because some-
one tells them to do so, you get a much more serious commitment when a
person recognizes and appreciates a project’s benefits. When discussing your
project’s benefits with your team, consider ones that are important to your
organization, its employees, and its clients, such as the following:
 Improved products and services
 Increased sales
 Improved productivity
 Better work environment
Also consider potential benefits to each team member, such as the following:
 Acquiring new skills and knowledge
 Working in an enjoyable environment
 Expanding business contacts
 Enhancing career potential
When you help people realize their personal benefits from participating in a
project, you increase their commitment to the project and, therefore, the
chances that the project will succeed.
261
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance

Occasionally someone reminds me that his staff receives salaries for doing
their jobs. In other words, he’s suggesting that he doesn’t have to worry
about people realizing personal benefits from their assigned tasks. As far as
he’s concerned, people will perform their assignments because they want to
receive their paychecks. Unfortunately, this type of reward power encourages
people to do the least work necessary to ensure their next paycheck rather
than to work toward the highest-quality results.
I’m not suggesting your main concerns on a project are your team members’
personal benefits. However, people are more committed if they feel they can
accomplish personal goals while helping their organization achieve its goals.
Help your team to understand and appreciate the benefits that your project
can achieve for the organization by
 Identifying the situation that led to your project
 Identifying your project’s key drivers and clarifying their hopes for the
project (see Chapter 3 for the definition of project drivers)
 Encouraging team members to discuss the expected benefits and the
value of those benefits
Also encourage your team members to identify personal benefits that they
may realize from participating in your project by
 Discussing their personal interests and career goals and relating those
interests and goals to aspects of the project
 Discussing past projects they’ve enjoyed and the reasons they’ve
enjoyed them
 Discussing some of the benefits that you and other people hope to real-
ize by working on this project
Encouraging persistence by demonstrating
project feasibility
A project is feasible if it’s possible to accomplish it. No matter how desirable
you may feel a project is, you’ll give up more easily when you encounter any
difficulties if you’re convinced that nothing you do can cause it to succeed.
You don’t need a guarantee of success, but you must believe that you have a
chance.
262
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Of course, feasibility is a subjective assessment. What seems impossible to
one person can appear feasible to another. Your assessment of feasibility can
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think that an assignment is feasible,
you work hard to complete it; if you encounter problems, you try to work
them out. However, if you really believe that you have no chance of succeed-
ing, you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Any problems just confirm what
you already knew — the project was doomed from the start. Of course, as
soon as you give up, you have no chance of succeeding, so your initial belief
that the project wasn’t feasible has been confirmed!
Help people to believe a project is feasible by working with them to define
what the team will produce, when, and how. Specifically, do the following:
 Involve team members in the planning process.
 Encourage them to identify potential concerns, so you can address
them.
 Explain why you feel that your targets and plans are feasible.
 Develop responsive risk-management plans (see Chapter 8).
Letting people know how they’re doing
Appreciating your project’s value and feasibility helps to motivate people ini-
tially. However, if the project lasts longer than a couple of weeks, the team’s
initial motivation can die out without continual reinforcement. People need
to know how they’re doing over time for three reasons:
 Achieving intermediate milestones provides personal satisfaction.
 Recognizing their successes confirms they’re on the right track.
 Successfully completing intermediate steps reinforces their belief that
they can accomplish the final goals.
Have you ever seen a 12-month project where all the major milestones
occurred in months 11 and 12? When do you think people got serious about
this project? Months 10, 11, and 12 (if they were still around by then)! Do the
following to help to keep people on track and excited about your project:
 Establish meaningful and frequent intermediate milestones.
 Continually assess how people are doing.
 Frequently share information with people about their performance.
 Continually reinforce the project’s potential benefits.
263
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance

See Chapter 13 for ways to inform people of your project’s progress.
Providing rewards for work well done
Rewarding people at a project’s conclusion for their effort and accomplish-
ments confirms to them that they accomplished the desired results and met
the audience’s needs and that team members and managers recognize and
appreciate their contributions. This recognition, in turn, makes it more likely
that they will welcome the opportunity to participate in future projects.
Rewards can take several forms, including the following:
 You talk with the person and express your appreciation for her help.
 You express your appreciation in a written note or e-mail to the person.
 You express your appreciation in writing to the person’s supervisor.
 You formally submit input to the person’s performance appraisal.
 You nominate the person for a future assignment she particularly wants.
 You nominate the person for a cash award.
 You issue the person a certificate of appreciation.
 You take the person out to lunch.
Rather than guessing which form of reward the person will appreciate most,
ask him directly.
Do the following, to make the rewards most effective:
 Be sure your acknowledgment and appreciation is honest and sincere.
 Note the specific contribution the reward recognizes.
 Respect the person’s personal style and preferences when giving the
reward:
• Some people enjoy receiving acknowledgements in front of their
co-workers, while others prefer receiving them in private.
• Some people appreciate receiving an individual award; others
appreciate receiving an award presented to the entire team.

Bringing Your Project to Closure
In This Chapter
 Planning for a successful project termination
 Crossing those t’s and dotting those i’s: The remaining administrative issues
 Helping your team through closure
 Producing a value beyond the project: The post-project evaluation
O
ne characteristic that distinguishes a project from other work assign-
ments is its distinct end, a point at which all work is complete and the
results are achieved. However, with the intense demands pulling you on to
your next assignment, completed projects can languish and eventually fade
away instead of clearly ending with an announcement, recognition of the
results, and a thank-you to the people who made them possible.
Unfortunately, this demise hurts both the organization and the people who
performed the work. When you don’t assess the extent to which your project
achieved the desired outcomes, you can’t determine whether you conceived,
planned, or performed the project well. Furthermore, team members don’t
have the chance to experience closure, achievement, and a job well done.
This chapter shows you how to bring your project to a close by finishing all
substantive work, performing the final administrative tasks, and helping team
members complete their association with your project and move on. In addi-
tion, this chapter helps you announce your project’s end and conduct a post-
project evaluation.
Staying the Course to Completion
Following your project all the way through to completion helps ensure that
everyone gets the maximum benefits from your project’s results. It also
allows you to determine all of these benefits and compare them with the
costs incurred, to confirm the company’s return on investment, and validate
its process for selecting projects.

Bringing a project to an end typically entails wrapping up a multitude of small
details and open issues. Dealing with these numerous assignments can be
frustrating under the best of circumstances. However, the following situa-
tions can make the end of a project even more difficult:
 Often you don’t have a detailed, written list of all the activities you must
perform.
 Some team members may have transferred to new assignments, making
it necessary for the remaining members to assume new responsibilities
in addition to their original ones.
 The project staff may lose motivation as general interest in the project
wanes and people look forward to new assignments.
 The project staff may want the project to continue because they don’t
want to end the personal and professional relationships they’ve devel-
oped or they’re not excited about their next assignment.
 Your customer (internal or external) may not be very interested in com-
pleting the final details of the project.
Reduce the impact of difficult situations such as these and increase the
chances for your project’s success by planning for closure at the outset of
your project, identifying and attending to all closure details and tasks, and
refocusing your team.
Plan ahead for concluding your project
If you wait until the end of your project to start thinking in detail about clo-
sure, you may be too late to gather the necessary information and resources.
Start thinking about closure as you plan your project as follows:
 Start laying the groundwork for closure when you prepare your pro-
ject plan. Ensure that you describe your project objectives completely
and clearly and identify all relevant objective measures and specifica-
tions. If one of the project objectives is to change an existing condition,
describe that situation before you begin your project so you have a com-
parative basis for assessment at the end of your project.
 Include project closure activities in your project plan. Specify in your
project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS — see Chapter 4 for more on
this project-planning tool) all activities you’ll have to perform to close
out your project, and then plan sufficient time and resources to perform
these activities.
266
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Update your plans as you 
prepare closure activities
View termination (the close phase — see Chapter 1) as a separate project.
When you think you’ve accomplished the intended project results, update
the preliminary closure plans from your initial project plan.
Gather your remaining team members and specify everything that must
happen before the project can end, and then identify all activities you’ll per-
form, including:
 Completing any unfinished project activities
 Obtaining all necessary acceptances and approvals
 Assessing the extent to which project results met expectations
You can then assign responsibilities and resources for each activity. Finally,
develop a project-closure checklist that specifies each activity and the
person responsible.
Charge up your team for the 
sprint to the finish line
As team members work hard to fulfill project obligations, their focus often
shifts from accomplishing the project’s overall objectives to completing their
individual assignments. In addition, other audiences who were initially very
interested in the project’s results may become involved with other priorities
and activities as the project continues. Yet successful project completion
requires a coordinated effort by all key participants.
In order to reinforce your team’s focus and interest, do the following:
 Remind people of the value and importance of the project’s final prod-
ucts. Frequently discuss the benefits the organization will realize from
your project’s final results as well as the individual benefits that team
members will gain. People are more likely to work hard to successfully
complete a project when they realize the benefits that they’ll achieve.
 Call your team together and reaffirm your mutual commitment to
bring the project to successful completion. Discuss your personal com-
mitment to completing your project successfully and why you feel it’s
important. Encourage other people to make similar commitments.
People overcome obstacles and perform difficult assignments more
effectively when they’re committed to succeed.
267
Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure

 Monitor final activities closely and give frequent feedback on perfor-
mance to each team member. Set up frequent milestones and progress
reporting times with team members. Staying in close touch with team
members provides you and them with up-to-date info on how near you
are to final closure; it also provides the opportunity to identify and deal
with any issues and problems that may arise.
 Be accessible to team members. Make yourself available when team
members want to confer with you. Consider having lunch periodically
with team members and letting them see you around their office area.
Being accessible demonstrates your interest in and the importance of
their work. It’s another way to ensure that you deal promptly with any
problems.
Handling the Administrative Issues
Just as you must have authorization for people to legally spend time, effort,
and resources to perform work on a project, this authorization must be
rescinded when you close the project — to ensure that people won’t con-
tinue to spend time, effort, or resources on it in the future. Officially termi-
nate this authorization by doing the following:
 Obtain all required approvals. Obtain written approval that your pro-
ject has passed all performance tests and followed standards and certifi-
cations. In addition, be sure you have obtained customer or client
acceptances. This step confirms that no additional work is necessary on
the project.
 Reconcile outstanding transactions. If you’ve made project purchases
from outside sources, resolve any disputes with vendors and suppliers
and pay all outstanding bills. Make sure that any project work effort or
expenditures that were posted to incorrect accounts are adjusted.
 Close out charge categories. Get official confirmation that no future
charges can be made to your project accounts.
Providing a Good Transition 
for Team Members
Help project team members complete their project responsibilities and move
on to their next assignments. Handling this transition in an orderly and
agreed-upon fashion allows people to focus their energies on completing
their tasks on your project instead of wondering where and when their next
assignment will be. In particular, do the following:
268
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

 Acknowledge and document team members’ contributions. Express
your appreciation to people for their assistance on your project and
share with them your assessment of their performance. Also take a
moment to thank their supervisors for making these workers available
to your project, and provide the supervisors with an assessment of their
employees’ performance.
Share positive feedback in public; share constructive criticisms and sug-
gestions for improvement in private. In both cases, be sure to share your
comments with team members personally and follow up your conversa-
tion in writing.
 Help people plan for their transition to new assignments. If appropri-
ate, help people find their next project assignment. Help them develop a
schedule for winding down their involvement with your project while
ensuring that they fulfill remaining obligations.
Consider holding a final project meeting or lunch to provide people clo-
sure on their work and project relationships.
 Announce to the organization that your project is complete. You have
three important reasons to make this announcement:
• To alert people in your organization that the planned outcomes of
your project are now available
• To confirm to people who supported your project that their efforts
led to a successful result
• To let people know they can no longer charge time or resources to
your project
 Take a moment to let team members and others who supported your
project know the true results of the work they invested. Nothing can
provide stronger motivation to jump into the next assignment and pro-
vide continued high-quality support.

Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Using a novel approach to announce 
your project’s closure
If your project was small, chances are that all
participants know it’s over and they’re aware of
the results. But if the project took a long time
(six months or more) and involved many groups
in your organization, people who participated
early may never see the actual results of their
efforts.
A while back, a client of mine had just com-
pleted a one-year project that entailed the
design, development, production, and introduc-
tion of a small piece of equipment for an aircraft
cockpit. At the official end of his project, he
reflected on the many different people who had
helped from all areas of his organization. In
addition to the engineers who completed the
final installation and testing of the equipment,
contract officers, procurement specialists,
financial managers, human resource special-
ists, test lab personnel, logisticians, and others
had all helped.
He realized that, if past experience was any
indicator, the vast majority of these support
people would never see the final result of their
efforts. So he decided to do something that his
organization had never done; he put together a
small display in his workplace that illustrated
the birth, evolution, and fruition of his project.
He included everything from the signed con-
tract document and purchase orders to the ini-
tial design model and engineering drawings to
the pictures of the device in an airplane, pic-
tures of a pilot who would use it, and photos of
the maintenance people who would support it.
He then sent messages to the people who had
worked on the project, announcing the display
and inviting them to come by to visit.
The response was overwhelming. He estimated
that more than 100 people came by to look at the
display. He overheard comments by people
throughout the organization about how they had
performed individual tasks large and small that
contributed to the success of this equipment —
equipment that they now could see would affect
people’s lives. The most poignant comment he
received was from a technician who worked in
the test laboratory. The technician told him this
was the first time in his 11 years at the organi-
zation that he had ever seen the final results of
an item he had tested.
My client estimated that he spent several hours
assembling the display. Yet the positive results
he and his organization received from this shar-
ing were immeasurable.

A project postmortem is another term for post-project evaluation. I avoid using
the former term, however, because it conjures up the image of an autopsy to
determine the cause of death! I prefer to leave people with a more positive
memory of their experience with a project.
This section helps you conduct a post-project evaluation, from preparing for
it, to conducting it, to following up.
Preparing for the meeting 
throughout the project
Your project evolves through five stages (conceive, define, start, perform,
and close) as it goes from an idea to a completed effort (see Chapter 1 for
definitions of each stage). Take steps in each stage to lay the groundwork for
your post-project evaluation:
 Conceive phase:
• Determine the benefits that your project’s drivers wanted to realize
when they authorized your project. (See Chapter 3 for definition
and discussion of drivers and the other types of project audiences.)
• If your project is designed to change an existing situation, take
before measures that describe the situation to compare with after
measures taken when the project is completed.
 Define phase:
• Ascertain any additional project drivers that you didn’t identify in
the concept phase. The expectations of your project’s drivers
serve as the criteria for defining your project’s success, so you
want to know who they all are.
• Develop clear and detailed descriptions of all project objectives.
• Include the activity Conduct a post-project evaluation in your Work
Breakdown Structure (WBS) and allow time and resources to per-
form it. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of a WBS.)
 Start phase:
• Tell team members that the project will have a post-project 
evaluation.
• Encourage team members to record issues, problems, and suc-
cesses throughout their project involvement in a handwritten or
computerized project log. Review the log when proposing topics
for discussion at the post-project evaluation.
271
Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure

 Perform phase:
• Maintain files of cost, labor-hour charges, and schedule perfor-
mance reports throughout the project. (See Chapter 12 for details
on how to track and report resource expenditures and schedule
performance.)
• Encourage team members to continue making entries in their pro-
ject logs.
 Close phase:
• If changing an existing situation was a project objective, take after
measures of that situation’s key characteristics.
• Obtain final cost, labor-hour, and schedule performance reports
for the project.
• Hold a post-project evaluation session.
• Distribute minutes from the post-project evaluation session.
Setting the stage for the post-project 
evaluation meeting
A post-project evaluation is only as good as the information it’s based on con-
cerning results, expenditures, and performance. The information must be
complete, detailed, and accurate. Prepare for your post-project evaluation
meeting by collecting information on the following:
 Results
 Schedule performance
 Resource expenditures
 Problems that arose during the project
 Changes during the project in objectives, schedules, and budgets
 Unanticipated occurrences or changes in the environment during the
project
 Customers’ satisfaction with the project results
 Management’s satisfaction with the project results
272
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

Collect this information from the following sources:
 Progress reports
 Project logs
 Cost reports
 Schedule reports
 Project memos, correspondence, and meeting minutes
 Customer opinions
 Management opinions
 Team member opinions
Prepare a detailed agenda for the post-project evaluation meeting that
includes the times when topic discussions will start and end. Consider
including the following topics:
 Statement of the meeting’s purpose
 Specific outcomes to be accomplished
 Highlights of project performance
• Results, schedules, and resources
• Approaches to project planning
• Project tracking-systems and procedures
• Project communications
• Project-team practices and effectiveness
 Discussion and recognition of special achievements
 Review of customer and management reactions to the project
 Discussion of problems and issues
 Discussion of how to reflect experiences from this project in future
efforts
Circulate a draft of the agenda, all related background materials, and a list of
attendees to all expected attendees at least one week before the meeting.
This advance notice gives people time to suggest additions, deletions, and
changes. Revise the agenda to address these suggestions, and distribute the
final agenda to all meeting participants.
273
Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure

Conducting the post-project 
evaluation meeting
A successful post-project evaluation meeting requires that you address the
right topics and that people share their project thoughts and experiences
openly and honestly.
At the post-project evaluation meeting, explore the following issues:
 Did you accomplish the project objectives?
 Did you meet the project schedule?
 Did you complete the project within budget?
 With regard to problems during the project
• Could you have anticipated and planned for them in advance? If so,
how?
• Did you handle them effectively and efficiently?
 Did you use the organization’s project-management systems and proce-
dures effectively?
Do the following, to ensure you get the most accurate information and the
best recommendations for future actions:
 Invite the right people. Invite all people who participated in your pro-
ject at all points throughout its life. If the list of potential invitees is too
long, consider meeting separately with selected subgroups and then
holding a general session where everyone reviews the results of the
smaller meetings and you solicit final comments and suggestions.
 Declare at the beginning of the session that this is to be a learning
experience rather than a finger-pointing session.
As project manager, you run the post-project evaluation meeting and
declare at the outset that the session is to be a time for self-examination
and suggestions for ensuring the success of future projects. If people
start to attack or criticize other participants, you can immediately bring
the discussion back on track by asking the following questions of the
participants:
• What can you yourself do in the future to deal more effectively
with such situations?
• What can you do in the future to prevent such situations from
occurring?
274
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 

If people resist your attempts to redirect their conversations, you can men-
tion actions that you, as project manager, can take in the future to head off or
deal with similar situations more effectively and then ask people to share
additional ideas.
 Encourage people to
• Identify what other people did well.
• Examine their own performance and see how they could have han-
dled situations differently.
 Consider holding the session away from your office. People often feel
more comfortable critiquing existing practices and discussing new
approaches when they’re away from their normal work environment.
Be sure to assign a person to take notes during the post-project evaluation
meeting. In addition to a list of attendees and highlights of information, the
notes should list all agreed-upon activities to implement the lessons learned
from the meeting and the people responsible for those activities.
Following up on the post-project 
evaluation
Often your busy schedule pulls you to new projects before you’ve analyzed
and benefited from the previous experiences. However, even when people do
take a few moments to review experiences, they seldom incorporate the
advice in future operating practices.
As soon as possible after your post-project evaluation session, the project
manager should prepare and distribute a report that’s based on the meeting
minutes and addresses the following topics:
 Practices to incorporate in future projects
 Steps to take that encourage these practices
 Practices to avoid on future projects
 Steps to be taken to avoid these practices
Consider this report as you plan future projects to make sure you apply the
lessons you’ve learned. The sidebar “Déjà vu: Avoiding the same mistakes” in
this chapter shows a good example of why a written report is important.

Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure

276
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Déjà vu: Avoiding the same mistakes
A participant at one of my training sessions
shared her frustration about a situation back at
her job. A month earlier, she had attended a full-
day post-project evaluation for a year-long pro-
ject. The project had achieved most of the
desired results, but this success came at the
cost of budget overruns, schedule slips, and
team members’ emotional and physical exhaus-
tion from the pressure of working in a continual
crisis mode. People spent most of the evalua-
tion day exploring how to handle future efforts
more smoothly and efficiently.
Now in a new assignment, she was noticing
that the people who participated in that post-
project evaluation were all making the same
mistakes they had made on the previous pro-
ject! She wondered why they were totally ignor-
ing the lessons from the previous experience.
I asked how the other team members had
reacted to the report of recommendations from
the post-project evaluation. She appeared
stunned and admitted that no one had taken any
notes at the session or prepared a report of the
session. More than ten mid- and high-level
managers had spent an entire day discussing
plans and approaches to improve their organi-
zation’s operations, but no one had put those
ideas down on paper. No wonder nothing had
changed — no one knew specifically what
changes to make or how to make them happen.

Taking Your Project
Management to the
Next Level

In this part . . .
You become a truly skilled project manager by contin-
uing to increase your knowledge and refine your
practices, and by effectively using tools and resources
from start to finish.
In this part, I discuss how to use the techniques in this
book to manage multiple projects. I also suggest ways to
use new technologies and, just as important, ways to
avoid some of their pitfalls. I then offer tips for introduc-
ing the tools and techniques in this book at your job.
Finally, I walk you through an advanced method for
assessing project schedule and cost performance that can
provide early warning signs of potential problems on
larger projects.

 Getting more for your money in a multiple-project environment
A
journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Managing the
most-complex, multiple-project environments begins with effectively
planning and controlling each project individually. However, when separate
projects interrelate, challenges as well as opportunities can arise.
Anticipating and addressing the challenges can improve the chances for pro-
ject success. And taking advantage of opportunities can lead to higher-qual-
ity products in less time and with fewer resources.
The tools for identifying and analyzing these challenges and opportunities
are the same as those used to plan and control a single project. This chapter
discusses the special aspects of a multiple-project environment and what you
can do to succeed.
Defining a Multiple-Project Environment
A multiple-project environment is more than just a setting where many pro-
jects take place at the same time. Instead, some or all of the projects share
common elements. For example, they may
 Have some of the same team members.
 Use some of the same organizational support services.
 Have the same client or sponsor.

 Have some of the same audiences.
 Include some of the same activities.
 Use some of the same resources (in addition to personnel).
 Be part of a single, overarching initiative.
In other words, they may produce one of the products or services
required to accomplish an overall business objective, or they may be
one of several phases that all lead to a final result.
Achieving the greatest cumulative benefit from these interrelated projects
requires that you
 Decide whether to perform projects based on the benefits they generate
as well as the benefits they offer other projects that depend on their
support.
 Address in each project’s plan requirements, dependencies, and con-
straints arising from other projects.
 Resolve conflicting demands for resources based on clear and consis-
tent priorities that reflect the anticipated net benefits (the excess of ben-
efits over costs) of all projects.
 Clearly and completely document the commitments to provide the
resources for each project.
 Ensure that each project’s team is focused, energized, and prepared to
work effectively and efficiently.
 Monitor and report on project performance succinctly and in a timely
manner, and address promptly all performance issues identified.
Project Portfolio Management is the coordinated process of selecting, plan-
ning, organizing, performing, and controlling groups of projects to achieve an
organization’s business objectives. When you consider projects as a group
instead of individually, you ensure that you
 Undertake all necessary work to achieve the desired objective
 Provide the necessary resources for all projects authorized
 Set and maintain activity priorities within and among projects
Project Portfolio Management requires
 A well-established planning and budgeting process
 Effective project management processes, procedures, and practices
280
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

 Accurate and timely reporting of work-hours and dollars spent on indi-
vidual projects
 A centralized point of coordination and oversight for planning, control-
ling, and supporting the projects
The remainder of this chapter presents suggestions for addressing the spe-
cial issues and situations you may encounter when planning, starting, and
performing multiple projects. (See Chapter 1 for to see how identifying and
comparatively analyzing projected benefits and costs can support the project
selection process.)
Planning in a Multiple-Project
Environment
You use the same tools, techniques, and processes to create a plan in a multi-
project environment as you do for a stand-alone project. However, this sec-
tion helps you identify and address the special situations that may occur in a
multiple-project environment.
Identifying project audiences
An essential part of planning any project is identifying the different audiences
that will support, influence, or be affected by the project. (See Chapter 3 for
more on project audiences.)
When identifying people who will be affected by, interested in, or needed to
support your project, do the following:
 If the same person is involved in two or more projects, be sure to
specify whether the audience is a driver, supporter, or observer on
each of the projects. A person may be a driver on one of your projects
and a supporter on another. Depending on the role the person plays, you
will seek and share different information with him and expect different
kinds of support.
 Be sure your project’s Audience List includes the managers and team
members of all other projects that depend on or support yours. Doing
so can help ensure timely and accurate information sharing among
related projects.
281
Chapter 16: Managing Multiple Projects

Preparing the Statement of Work
Check out Chapter 2 for information on the Statement of Work (SOW). When
describing the background, planned outcomes, restrictions, and assumptions
for your project, do the following:
 If the results of a project are used in other projects or if the project
depends on the outputs from other projects, identify these projects and
their effects on each other in the Background section of the Purpose
Statement.
 If one person will be involved in several related projects:
• Describe in the Strategy section of each project’s Purpose
Statement why the person is involved and specifically how his
roles on the projects will differ.
• Identify in the Constraints section all requirements and restrictions
that will affect each project as a result of the person’s involvement
in other related projects.
For example, the person may be unavailable to work on Project A
for a particular three-week period this summer because he must
work on Project B during that same time period.
Developing the Work Breakdown Structure
When developing the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS — refer to Chapter 4
for more on this information item), identify and detail sufficiently all activities
that people assigned to multiple projects will work on. This detailing allows
you to be more realistic when discussing the amount and timing of effort
those people should plan for each project.
Differentiating people’s roles
Clarifying people’s roles on projects is especially important when they may
be doing similar work on more than one project at the same time. The Linear
Responsibility Chart (LRC) is a tabular display of each person’s particular
role and responsibilities on a project. (See Chapter 10 for more information
about the LRC.)
282
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Plan to involve people consistently throughout each project they work on to
help maintain their focus and commitment. Also explain how you expect
people to support each activity on their different projects so you can have
accurate estimates of work effort and understand when these people are
available.
Identifying cross-project dependencies
Dependencies among activities and products on different projects often
aren’t identified, when project teams keep mostly to themselves. Consider
carefully the work on other projects related to your own to identify and docu-
ment all such relationships and to minimize the chances of unplanned delays.
Heading off conflicting resource demands
When different projects require the same people and resources during the
same time period, the resources often wind up being overcommitted.
Sometimes these overcommitments occur because people on one project are
unaware that people on other projects have similar resource needs; other
times they happen when each project manager stubbornly feels his project is
the most important. In both cases, communicating early and often can help
resolve or even avoid such situations.
Keep the following in mind when managing the personnel in a multiple-pro-
ject environment:
 Lobby to keep the records of time commitments and charges for all
people working on multiple projects in a single database to make identi-
fying and resolving conflicting assignments easier.
 Develop the personnel resource assignments for all projects at the same
time so project managers can readily identify all conflicts and resolve
them according to the correct priorities.
 Take into account the effect that switching between projects may have
on a person’s productivity.
 Where possible, assign people to projects for contiguous periods of time
instead of switching them frequently from one project to another.
Recognize that a person’s productivity and efficiency drop when she fre-
quently moves between assignments.
283
Chapter 16: Managing Multiple Projects

Do the following, when planning the use of resources other than people:
 Consult with people on other projects who are doing work similar to
yours to see whether they need any of the same resources during the
same time periods. If you find that some people will, work together to
prepare a schedule for using the resource that provides both of you the
support you need, while not scheduling the resource for more hours
than it has available.
 If you find out that other projects need a particular resource in the same
time period that you do, see if you can take advantage of economies of
scale (lowering costs by increasing volume) (check out “Making use of
economies of scale” later in this chapter for more info).
Addressing risks in a multiple-project
environment
Preparing effectively for any type of project requires that you anticipate
things that may not go according to plan so you can be prepared to deal with
them promptly and effectively if they occur (see Chapter 8 for information on
managing risks). However, some aspects of a multiple-project environment
are more likely than others to cause unexpected occurrences in your project.
You should always consider their potential impact in your risk-management
assessment.
A risk factor is a situation that may give rise to one or more project risks.
Consider the following possible risk factors when considering potential risks
in a multiple-project environment:
 The number of your team members that are working on more than one
project during the same time period
 The number of different projects your team members are working on
 The number of projects you are performing for the same client
 The resources (other than personnel) that are being used by different
projects during the same time period
 The number of projects using each resource
 The number of other projects your project audiences are involved with
 The number of other projects that are part of the same overarching ini-
tiative yours is
 The number of dependencies between your project’s activities and
those of other projects
284
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Starting a Project in a Multiple-Project
Setting
You have the opportunity to set your project apart in the minds of its team
members and its project audiences, as soon as it officially begins. This sec-
tion suggests how you can reconfirm and formalize your team’s personnel
assignments, create your project team’s identity, and focus and announce
your project to the organization.
Formalizing resource commitments
When a person serves as a team member on two or more projects, she has
greater competition for her time both initially and whenever unexpected
events occur. If the projects have different managers, the competition can be
more intense because each manager is most concerned with his own project.
These situations require managers and team members from the different pro-
jects to maintain collaborative, professional relationships and to consider the
needs of all projects when resource conflicts arise to reach resolutions that
provide the greatest cumulative benefit for the organization.
Preparing written Work-Order Agreements for all team members can clarify
the level and timing of their commitments and can highlight any existing con-
flicts. (See Chapter 11 for more information on preparing Work-Order
Agreements.)
To encourage the appropriate people to read and commit to these agree-
ments, include the following signatures on them:
 The person who is committing the time
 That person’s immediate functional supervisor
 The project manager
 Anyone else who may be involved in personnel-allocation decisions
When you’re contemplating changes for a person’s commitment on your pro-
ject, be sure to coordinate with the managers of all her other projects. When
you make the changes, update the existing Work-Order Agreement and share
it with all people involved.
285
Chapter 16: Managing Multiple Projects

Creating the project team
Chapter 11 notes the following four issues that a project manager should
address when forming a new project team:
 Goals
 Roles
 Processes
 Relationships
If people have worked together previously, they may feel they don’t have to
revisit some of these issues. However, to be effective, the team must consider
each of them in the present context.
Pay special attention to the following when addressing these issues:
 Clearly identify the individual goals of each project on which the
people are working. If the projects are part of a common initiative,
describe the special and unique aspects of each project and how the
combined efforts help achieve the overall goals.
 Encourage team members to consider how each project can specifi-
cally help them to achieve their personal goals. Because part of the
audiences and/or work is certain to be different for each project, each
project likely offers special and unique opportunities.
 Clarify the specific roles each person plays on the different projects.
Even if some of the work is similar, the person may not necessarily sup-
port that work in the same way on all projects.
 Design communication, decision-making, and conflict resolution
processes that allow for collaboration with people from other related
projects. Encouraging people on different projects to share information
with each other can help to avoid potential disagreements before they
occur and lead to better and faster solutions to problems when they do
arise.
 For each project, establish escalation procedures for handling con-
flicts that team members can’t resolve themselves. Having established
procedures to follow when people on different projects can’t resolve a
disagreement by themselves can lead to faster solutions with less
chance of residual personal animosity.
286
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Introducing the project to the organization
Often, when several projects with overlapping team memberships kick off at
the same time, the distinction between them becomes blurred in the eyes of
the team members and the organization.
Do the following to establish individual identities for multiple projects that
have similar or overlapping components:
 Introduce each project separately, either in separate meetings, in dis-
tinct, self-contained parts of the same meeting, or in different written
announcements. First, discuss all aspects of the project and then iden-
tify its relationships with any other projects.
 Communicate separately with each audience that’s participating in
more than one project and emphasize the importance of their contri-
butions to each project. Identify any areas of overlap or dependency
between the different projects and explain how they’ll be coordinated.
Also emphasize why it’s important that the audiences treat the projects
as separate entities, instead of one multifaceted effort.
Performing the Project(s) — 
Putting the Plan into Action
Planning and preparing for a project sets the stage for project success, but
you realize actual success only by putting the plans into action. This section
looks at three activities that you must perform effectively and consistently as
you work on all of your projects.
Detailing for successful daily activities
As you develop a project’s schedule, you decide the particular time periods
for each activity (see Chapter 5). However, to optimize your chances of com-
pleting all the activities that are slated for the same time period, you must
specify each day’s activities and schedule in detail.
287
Chapter 16: Managing Multiple Projects

In a multiple-project environment, where more independent forces are pulling
people and resources in different directions, consider the following items 
in more detail than you would for a single project when setting your daily 
priorities:
 Lower-level activity dependencies: The order in which you perform the
subparts of an activity
 Availability of personnel: Other commitments of the people who will
work with you on an activity
 Availability of other resources: Times during the day that the facilities,
equipment, or other resources that you need in your work are reserved
for other jobs
 Project risks: The chances that the activity may take longer, require
more or different resources, or not produce the desired results
In addition, minimize unnecessary activity-jumping (switching from one activ-
ity to another for short periods of time), a practice that increases the total
time to complete an activity.
Prepare the following items each day to support your work planning:
 A to-do list: A list of the activities you want to perform arranged from
highest to lowest priority
 A daily calendar: A record of the specific times to start and end each
activity on the list
You can keep these lists on your computer, on written sheets of paper, or in
whatever you find convenient. Just be sure to update them every day and
follow them religiously.
Reporting on progress
As projects unfold, people often become lost in the particular priorities of the
moment and lose sight of how all the pieces are fitting together. Periodic
progress reporting is especially important in a multiple-project environment
to remind people of their team’s goals and to keep people on related projects
updated on the progress and any changes on projects they depend on or sup-
port. (Refer to Chapter 12 for a general discussion of project assessment and
progress reporting.)
288
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

When dependencies and linkages exist between separate projects, follow
these guidelines for project progress reporting:
 Share information on each activity’s progress with all projects that are
dependent on that activity’s results.
 Obtain and share with your team any information on external project
activities that affect your project.
 Reinforce with your team the unique results of your project and the spe-
cial work it entails.
 If your project is part of a larger initiative, continually discuss how the
other parts are proceeding and how your project supports or depends
on those other projects.
Managing changes
Evaluating the impact of proposed changes and informing the appropriate
people when changes are made can be a time-consuming task on any project.
It’s particularly challenging in a multiple-project environment because more
people are involved, and it may be more difficult to find effective, efficient,
and timely ways to involve them.
When evaluating a potential change in a multiple-project environment, con-
sider its effect on all projects that interface with it. If you decide to change
some aspect of your project plan, share a written description of that change
with all people responsible for related activities on other projects.
Taking Advantage of Special
Opportunities
When multiple projects entail similar activities, or require people with similar
special expertise, or use similar resources, you can often save time and money
and at the same time improve the overall quality of work. A little advanced plan-
ning and some ongoing coordination are all you need. This section can help.
Planning for similar activities
If several projects include the same activity, consider coordinated planning.
For example, you can hold joint sessions with representatives from each pro-
ject team to detail the subelements of the activity and estimate the necessary
289
Chapter 16: Managing Multiple Projects

time and resources. If feasible, develop a single plan for this activity that all
related projects can then incorporate into their plans. At the very least,
encourage teams to review and consider using parts of other plans for the
same activity.
When you coordinate the plans for common activities, you
 Improve the quality of the plan for the current project by getting the cre-
ative input from a wider range of experienced people
 Reduce the time to prepare the plans
 Develop knowledge that improves the quality of and reduces the time
for planning future projects with similar activities
Making use of economies of scale
Taking advantage of economies of scale refers to recognizing benefits as a
result of working on a larger scope. An example is paying less per item when
you buy 1,000 items than when you buy 100. If 10 companies each wanted to
purchase 100 of these items, each one could get its items for the cheaper
price if they together placed one order for 1,000 instead of 10 separate orders
for 100. In the extreme, sometimes several projects working together can pro-
cure a resource that none of them working alone could afford.
When you identify a situation where a possibility of a joint effort exists, do
the following:
1. Identify the projects that may use the resource.
2. Determine the difference in costs for using the resource separately
and using it in a coordinated plan (see the following example).
3. Determine the times that each activity must use the resource.
4. Schedule the activities to maximize the use of the resource in the
shortest time.
5. Assign responsibility for obtaining and coordinating the use of the
resource.
Suppose three projects require the expertise of a person who isn’t currently
on staff. Each project needs this person for approximately one month over a
three-month calendar period (an average commitment during the three-
month period of 33 percent). A project by itself would have difficulty finding
a consultant or temporary staffer to work for partial days periodically during
the three months. However, if the three projects coordinate their schedules,
they can keep the resource occupied full time for three months (by having
him spend one month on each of the three projects during the three-month
period).

E
ffective project management requires systems and procedures that help
people work together to achieve common goals. A major part of project
management is information — getting it, storing it, analyzing it, and sharing
it. However, the key to successful project management is using this informa-
tion to guide and encourage people’s performance.
Technological advances provide easier and more affordable ways to handle
information. For example, computer software allows you to enter, store, and
analyze information and then present the results in professional formats. And
e-mail allows written communication with people in remote locations at all
hours of the day (and night!).
However, technology alone can’t encourage focused and committed team
performance. In fact, excessive reliance on today’s technology can actually
result in poor morale, confused and disorganized team members, and lower
overall performance. This chapter guides your use of technology in jobs that
it handles well. For the jobs that aren’t well suited for technology, I discuss
other, more-appropriate means of handling people’s information needs.

292
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Using Computer Software Effectively
Today’s software for special analyses and reporting looks so good that you
may be tempted to believe it’s all you need to ensure your project’s success.
However, even though the software works effectively and efficiently, it can’t
perform the following essential tasks:
 Ensure that information is appropriately defined, timely, and accu-
rate. In most instances, people record information to support project
planning and control, and then they enter the info into a computer. You
can program the software to check for correctness of format or internal
consistency, but the software can’t ensure the quality and integrity of
the data.
Suppose you use a computer program to maintain labor hour records
that team members charge to your project. You can program the com-
puter to reject hours that are inadvertently charged with an invalid pro-
ject code. However, you can’t program the computer to recognize hours
charged to the wrong project with a valid code.
 Make decisions. Software can help you objectively determine the results
of several possible courses of action. However, software can’t effectively
take into account all the objective and subjective considerations that
you must weigh before making a final decision.
 Create and sustain dynamic interpersonal relationships. Despite
people’s fascination with chat rooms, e-mail, and other types of com-
puter-aided communication, computers don’t foster close, trusting rela-
tionships between people. If anything, technology makes relationships
more difficult to develop because it removes your ability to see facial
expressions and body language.
This section looks at different types of software available, how software can
help you manage your project, and how to introduce software into your work
environment.
Looking at your software options
When your project is sufficiently complex, you can use software for a wide
variety of tasks, including storing and retrieving important information, ana-
lyzing and updating that information, and preparing presentations and
reports that describe the information and results of the analyses.
The available software falls into two categories. Each type has benefits and
drawbacks.

Stand-alone, specialty software
Stand-alone, specialty software consists of separate packages that perform one
or two functions very well. The following types of specialized software can
support your project planning and performance:
 Word processing (Microsoft Word is an example): Useful for preparing
project plans, maintaining a project log, creating progress reports, and
preparing written communications.
 Business graphics and presentation (Microsoft PowerPoint is an exam-
ple): Useful for preparing overheads and slide shows for project presen-
tations and developing charts and artwork for written reports and
publications.
 Spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel is an example): Useful for storing moder-
ate amounts of data, performing repetitive calculations, and presenting
information in a variety of chart formats.
 Database (Microsoft Access is an example): Useful for storing and retriev-
ing large amounts of data for subsequent analysis and presentation.
 Accounting (Intuit QuickBooks is an example): Useful for keeping
records of project income and expenses and producing a variety of
descriptive and comparative reports.
 Day planner and scheduler (Microsoft Outlook is an example): Useful
for scheduling your calendar, maintaining a to-do list, keeping your
address book, and managing your e-mail activities.
Many manufacturers offer software packages in the preceding categories.
However, because so many of the organizations I’ve worked with use
Microsoft software, I’ve noted examples of Microsoft software packages in the
different categories. You may have heard of them before, and, if you don’t
have them already, you can easily install them on your computer.
Initially, specialty packages performed one or two functions very well. As
they’ve evolved, however, they’ve expanded to include capabilities that support
their primary functions: Word-processing packages now possess some spread-
sheet, business graphics, and database capabilities; spreadsheet packages now
have some business-graphics and word-processing capabilities; and database
packages now have some spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities.
In general, specialty packages offer the following strengths:
 They offer powerful capability in their area of specialty. For example,
a business graphics-and-presentation package makes it relatively easy to
prepare professional-quality presentations that effectively share infor-
mation and stimulate your audience’s interest.
293
Chapter 17: Using Technology to Up Your Game

 You most likely have several packages already on your computer.
Having these packages already available means you can use them imme-
diately for no additional cost.
 People probably know how to use many of the common specialty
packages. As a result, people are more apt to use them and use them
correctly. Also, you save time and money because people don’t require
special training to use them.
However, these packages pose some potential concerns:
 They’re likely to encourage piecemeal approaches to project planning
and control, which may omit certain key steps. You can use a business-
graphics package to draw a Gantt chart (see Chapter 5). However, ensur-
ing your schedule is feasible requires you to consider the effect of
activity interdependencies when you prepare it. A business-graphics
package can’t perform that function for you.
 They don’t integrate easily. For example, you can depict your project’s
schedule in a Gantt chart and display personnel hours over the duration
of each task in a spreadsheet. However, if one team member is unexpect-
edly out for a week, you have to make separate changes by revising the
person’s hours in the spreadsheet and then changing the Gantt chart in
the graphics package to reflect new activity start and end dates. Even
though some programs can share data directly with other programs, the
process is often cumbersome.
Integrated project-management software
Integrated project-management software combines database, spreadsheet,
graphics, and word-processing capabilities to support many of the activities
normally associated with planning and performing your project. An example
of an integrated package is Microsoft Project, although more than 50 such
packages of all shapes and sizes are on the market today.
A typical integrated project-management package allows you to do the 
following:
 Create a hierarchical list of activities and their components
 Define and store key information about your project, activities, and
resources
 Define activity interdependencies (see Chapter 5 for more information
on activity interdependencies)
294
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

 Develop schedules by considering activity durations, activity interde-
pendencies, and resource requirements and availability
 Display a schedule in Gantt-chart and table formats (see Chapter 5)
 Assign people to work on project activities for specific levels of effort at
certain times
 Schedule other resources for project activities at specified times
 Determine your overall project budget
 Determine the effect of changes on the project’s schedule and resources
 Monitor activity start and end dates and milestone dates
 Monitor person-hours and resource costs
 Present planning and tracking information in a wide array of graphs and
tables
295
Chapter 17: Using Technology to Up Your Game
Project-Portfolio Management software: Raising
the bar on project management
Most integrated project-management software
packages support the planning, tracking, and
reporting for an individual project. Project-
Portfolio Management software, however, is
special because it also
 Supports the assigning and tracking of
people to activities on more than one project.
 Takes into account interproject activity
dependencies when determining different
schedule possibilities.
 Tracks and reports the progress and
accomplishments of numerous projects
simultaneously.
 Supports communication throughout the
organization regarding the planning and
performance of different projects
Consider using Project-Portfolio Management
software to support project planning and con-
trol when your organization meets these crite-
ria: has several large, cross-departmental
projects underway; staffs these projects from a
common resource pool; has well-established
project management and data-collection prac-
tices and procedures.

Having a wide range of capabilities in a software package doesn’t guarantee
that you’ll use them correctly. Remember the old adage: Garbage in, garbage
out. Even the most advanced software package can’t help your project if
people don’t submit accurate and timely data.
Integrated project-management packages offer benefits as well as drawbacks.
The benefits include the following:
 The package’s functions are linked. For example, if you enter personnel
requirements one time, the program considers them when developing
schedule and resource budgets and when reporting project progress.
 Packages typically have a variety of predesigned report formats.
Having predesigned report templates allows you to use formats that are
proven to be effective. It also saves you time and money when preparing
and distributing your reports.
296
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Choosing an integrated project-management 
package
If you decide to use an integrated project-man-
agement package, consider the following fac-
tors when choosing your program:
 Types and formats of reports. Choose a
package that supports your reports and
reporting with minimum customization.
 People’s general comfort and familiarity
with computers and software. Will they
take the time and effort to learn and then
use the package? Having a package with
state-of-the-art analysis and reporting
capabilities is no help if people don’t learn
how to use it.
 Your organization’s present software.
Everything being equal, choose a package
that’s already available and in use because
team members most likely have experience
with it.
 Your organization’s existing systems to
record labor hours and expenses. If your
organization does have such systems, con-
sider a package that can easily interface
with them. If the organization doesn’t have
these systems, consider a package that can
store the information you’ll need.
 The project environment in your organiza-
tion. What’s the size of the human-resource
pool for projects, the number and typical
size of projects, and so on? Choose a pack-
age that has the necessary capacity and
speed.
Check out Microsoft Project For Dummies by
Martin Doucette (Wiley) for more information on
effectively using this software’s capability.

On the other hand, integrated project-management packages also have their
drawbacks:
 The package may not be immediately available. If it isn’t currently
available, you have to devote time and money to buy and install the soft-
ware before you can use it to prepare project reports.
 Most people require training to become comfortable with the pack-
age. Training takes additional time and money.
Supporting your software
No matter which type of project-management software you choose, your pro-
ject’s ultimate success depends on how well you coordinate and support
your project planning and control activities. Table 17-1 illustrates the activi-
ties that software can support, the types of software that can provide the
support, and how you can ensure that the activity is performed correctly.

Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Introducing project-management 
software into your operations
Before you rush out and buy any project-management software, plan how to
maximize its capabilities and avoid associated pitfalls. Do the following to
help you select and install your software:
 Be sure you have a firm grasp of project planning and control
approaches before you consider any software.
 See what software other groups in your organization are using or have
used; find out what they like, what they don’t, and why.
 If possible, ask someone who already has a copy of the software whether
you can spend a few minutes exploring its operation.
 After the package is on your computer, load a simple project or a small
part of a larger project (that is, enter the activities, durations, interde-
pendencies, resources, and so on).
 Use only a few of the program’s capabilities at first (determine the effect
of small changes on your schedule, print out some simple reports, and
so on); use more capabilities as you get more comfortable and feel the
need for them.
 Consider attending a formal training program after you’ve become com-
fortable accessing the software’s different capabilities.
After you’ve undertaken these steps, you can effectively use software to sup-
port your project planning and control activities. On an ongoing basis, ensure
that you obtain all updates and changes to the software and consider pur-
chasing software upgrades that introduce significant new capabilities.
Making Use of E-Mail
Before the advent of e-mail, people consistently told me that the two most
common frustrations in their daily routine were unproductive meetings and
playing telephone tag. Is it any wonder that people embraced e-mail as soon
as it hit the workplace?
Because e-mail is so common, I don’t devote too much time to it in this book.
However, this section briefly looks at its pros and cons, its appropriate uses
with your project team, and ways to use it to your advantage.
299
Chapter 17: Using Technology to Up Your Game

The pros and cons of e-mail
E-mail is a fast and convenient means of one-way, written communication. As
such, it has many desirable qualities:
 The sender and receiver don’t have to be present at the time of com-
munication. You can write an e-mail message whenever you want, and
your recipient can read it at his convenience.
 The sender and receiver don’t have to be in the same place. You can
send your message from Iowa to Tibet.
 Your message is delivered quickly. Relaying your message doesn’t
depend on delivery schedules, work hours, or weather conditions.
 E-mail serves as written documentation. The receiver can read your
message several times to clarify its meaning, and it serves as a reminder
that you have shared the information.
 You can store e-mail on computer hard disks, Zip disks, USB flash
drives, CDs, or DVDs rather than in hard copy. This saves you space
and money and makes retrieval easier.
Unfortunately, e-mail also has the following drawbacks:
 People may not read it. I often meet people who receive 50 to 100
e-mails each day! They readily admit to scanning the first few lines to
decide whether a message is worth reading. Some people just read the
sender’s name to decide whether to read any further.
 The medium doesn’t provide real-time interaction between sender
and receiver. The receiver may have difficulty correctly interpreting the
message because she can’t quickly ask questions, check inferences, or
ask you to paraphrase the message. You can try to clarify any issues
through subsequent e-mails, but people often lose interest in the
process.
 Communication is limited to the exchange of words. The sender’s non-
verbal cues (such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of
voice) are lost.
 Readers can often misinterpret the content or intent. E-mail has a
growing dictionary of meanings associated with different modes of
expression. (For an example, check out the nearby sidebar, “Reading
between the lines of your e-mails.”) Unfortunately, when people pick up
these meanings informally, their e-mails may convey the wrong message.
300
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Using e-mail appropriately
E-mail can be an effective component of a comprehensive communication
system for your project team. For example you can use e-mail to confirm oral
discussions and agreements. In these instances, you want a written message
to stand on its own with no interactive discussion or explanation. If a recipi-
ent needs to ask questions, the written message hasn’t documented the infor-
mation clearly and accurately.
You can also use e-mail to share factual information that requires little or no
clarification. Write simple messages using straightforward language. Tell
recipients how they can reach you if they have any questions.
However, e-mail can’t be the exclusive means of communication to do the 
following:
 Brainstorm to analyze problems and develop new ideas. Use e-mail to
announce the brainstorming session, invite people to attend, identify the
topic(s) you’ll explore, and provide relevant background material for
people to review before the session. Use e-mail to share a summary of
the results and future actions. But conduct the actual interchange of
ideas in a face-to-face session.
301
Chapter 17: Using Technology to Up Your Game
Reading between the lines of your e-mails
An old adage claims “It’s not what you say —
it’s how you say it.” In a face-to-face communi-
cation, people often pay more attention to the
speaker’s tone of voice, facial expressions, and
body language than to the words. Because
e-mail can’t transmit nonverbal cues, people
have developed a new vocabulary to share their
nonverbal messages with their e-mail recipi-
ents. Unfortunately, incorrect use of this vocab-
ulary can send the wrong message, creating
misunderstandings and hard feelings.
A client told me of a time he sent an e-mail to a
co-worker. To emphasize a particular message,
he typed it in bold characters. But the recipient
never responded and even appeared to ignore
him when they passed in the hallways. After
several days, my client sought the person out
and asked whether there was a problem. The
co-worker said he was upset and insulted that
my client had yelled at him in his e-mail. My
client expressed complete surprise and confu-
sion and asked how an e-mail could suggest a
person was yelling. Apparently, some people
equate boldface typing to yelling. Fortunately,
my client was able to discover the misunder-
standing and correct it. But it makes you
wonder how often such misunderstandings go
unnoticed and unaddressed!

 Build and sustain team members’ trust and commitment. Even though
you use e-mail to inform team members of each other’s background and
experience, commitments, and accomplishments, be sure you provide
sufficient opportunities for face-to-face meetings so team members
become familiar and comfortable with each other.
 Share an important message. Perhaps you can share the message ini-
tially through e-mail, but follow up with phone calls and in-person meet-
ings to discuss the message and ensure that your recipient has correctly
understood its content.
Getting the most out of your e-mail
When used correctly, e-mail can be a valuable tool for clear, timely, conve-
nient, and inexpensive communications. Do the following to get the most
from your team e-mail communications:
 Be concise. Use clear, measurable words and avoid technological jargon
and acronyms when possible.
 Read your e-mail before you send it. People’s impressions of you, your
ideas, and your attitude are strongly affected by what you say and how
you say it. Take a moment to proof your e-mail message before you hit
Send. Make sure you’ve made no typos.
 Anticipate miscommunications. Put yourself in your audience’s shoes.
How may they misinterpret your message? What additional information
may they want to have? Have you been clear about how you want them
to respond to your message? In other words, minimize the need for extra
e-mails back and forth to raise questions and clarify points by writing
one, well-thought-out e-mail.
 Be sure people have received it. If possible, program your system to
automatically let you know when your audience has opened your e-mail.
Otherwise, ask the receiver to verify that he’s received the message via a
return e-mail, a phone call, or a quick face-to-face conversation.
 Keep a copy of important e-mails. Maintain a file of important messages
you’ve sent. I keep computerized records of all sent e-mails on an exter-
nal hard drive, and I keep paper copies of especially important e-mails.
These copies confirm the information, date, and recipients. (See Chapter
13 for more info on communication with your project audience.)

Utilizing Communication Technology 
to Support Virtual Teams
The globalization of today’s businesses creates a greater need for people
around the world to work together on projects. This lack of proximity creates
unique challenges for encouraging successful team performance. This section
looks at some ways that today’s technology can support the communication
needs of these virtual teams.
A virtual project team is a group of people who work together across geo-
graphic, time, and organizational boundaries to accomplish a common set of
goals and objectives. Although the needs of a virtual project team are the
same as those of more conventional teams, many processes and resources
used by conventional teams aren’t available to the virtual team. Only through
the creative use of the available communication technology can virtual teams
perform at peak capacity.
High-performance team members must successfully accomplish the following
tasks:
 Share project and team-related information in a timely and accurate
manner
 Create and sustain trusting and productive interpersonal relationships
 Effectively collaborate to perform project work
Each of these tasks requires effective and timely communication. But, as vir-
tual teams approach these activities, they face unique challenges:
 Members may never meet each other in person. Becoming familiar with
and trust each other is more difficult; the use of nonverbal signals and
body language when communicating is severely limited.
 Members may have different primary languages. This communication
challenge increases the chances that people may incorrectly interpret a
message.
 Members may come from different organizational and cultural envi-
ronments. People’s work styles and communication practices may differ.
 Members may be in different time zones. People may not be available
to interact with each other during certain time periods.

Improving Individual 
and Organizational Skills 
and Practices
In This Chapter
 Keep a good thing going: Continuing to strengthen your abilities
 Pass it on: Bringing improved practices to the workplace
B
ecoming an effective project manager is an ongoing process. The more
you learn, the more you realize you need to learn. Fortunately, you have
many tools to help you improve your project-management skills.
This chapter discusses some of those means for honing skills and increasing
knowledge. It also provides tips for bringing those improved project manage-
ment practices to the workplace.
Continuing to Improve Your 
Skills and Knowledge
Whether you’ve been a project manager for six months or six years, you
probably want to become better at your job. To continue developing your
skills and knowledge, you have three main choices: attend formal training,
work with a mentor, and obtain professional certification. This section looks
more closely at these three options.

Attending the appropriate formal training
If you’re serious about improving your skills and knowledge, formal training
may be your first option, and it has many formats: face-to-face interaction
with a presenter, interaction with a presenter via video teleconferencing 
or the Internet, prerecorded sessions by a presenter, and programmed 
self-instruction.
You can get formal training through the following:
 Individual programs: These programs typically run one to three days
and address a particular set of project-management topics.
 Certificate programs: These programs comprise a collection of individ-
ual courses that address a range of project-management topics in depth
and lead to a certificate of participation. Certificate programs typically
last six months to a year.
 Degree programs: These college or university programs provide a cur-
riculum of project-management-related courses that lead to a formal
degree. These programs can span up to several years.
 Short seminars at professional-society meetings: Sessions of this kind
typically last a couple of hours and explore selected topics.
Many organizations (such as consulting firms, individual consultants, univer-
sities, professional societies, and even the organization for which you work)
sponsor these training programs.
To find programs in your area, check with your organization’s training or
human resources department. You can also do a Google search for project
management training in (your city or state), or visit the Project Management
Institute Web site at www.pmi.org (check out the section “Obtaining a pro-
fessional certification” later in this chapter for more on PMI).
When deciding which program to attend, your goal is: No surprises! To assure
this, consider the following factors.
Program content
The program content is certainly the first and one of the most important con-
siderations. Unfortunately, this information can be elusive because program
titles are often ambiguous, written descriptions can be too general or sound
too technical, and a description may not even be available.
306
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

To ensure you enroll in the right formal training session for you, do the fol-
lowing until you clearly understand the extent of the program contents:
1. Note the exact program title and read all brief program overviews or
descriptions you can find.
2. Obtain a copy of the program outline (the hierarchical breakout of 
the topics).
3. Obtain a copy of the program agenda (the schedule of time intervals
for each topic).
4. Review the program materials.
5. If possible, speak with the program instructor or someone who has
attended the program.
If you still don’t understand the content selections after taking all these
steps, find another program!
Program presentation style and format
In addition to the method of presentation (such as face to face with the
instructor, programmed instruction, and so on), consider the following
aspects of style and format:
 Are the sessions mostly a lecture format?
 Does the lecture consist mostly of the instructor reading from slides?
 Do you have an opportunity for questions and answers throughout 
the course?
 Is the course tailored for your field, for your company? If so, how?
 What types of group exercises and case work are in the program?
 Do you have an opportunity to ask questions about particular situations
you’re dealing with in your organization?
Knowing about a program’s style and format can help you select a program
that directly applies to your job setting and gives you plenty of opportunity
to understand its benefits and applications to your specific situation.
Instructor’s credibility
Larger organizations often have a cadre of instructors who can present each
of their training programs. As a result, they may not select the presenter until
shortly before the program begins. (They want to be free to shift instructors
around at the last minute to address other demands and priorities that arise.)
307
Chapter 18: Improving Individual and Organizational Skills and Practices

Despite any research you do upfront, this last-minute shuffling can leave you
with an instructor who doesn’t meet your needs. When you check out a pro-
gram, be sure to find out the likelihood that your instructor will be the one
who’s listed in the information.
The most important element in your training experience is your instructor.
Don’t attend the program unless you know who it will be.
When investigating your instructor, consider the following:
 Work experience: How long has the instructor been in the project-man-
agement field? In what capacities? Has he actually used the techniques
he presents in the training?
 Training experience: How many times has the instructor presented
training sessions in the topics that he’ll address? Does he specialize in
project management, or is this area just one of many in which he trains?
 Experience in your field: How extensively has the instructor dealt with
project-management issues in your particular field?
 Educational background: Has the instructor had formal education in
project management or related areas?
 Professional credentials: To what professional societies does he
belong? (The Project Management Institute, PMI, should certainly be 
one of them!) Which professional certifications does he hold (such 
as the Project Management Professional, PMP, which I discuss later 
in this chapter)?
Instructor’s style
The instructor’s style can make the difference between your leaving a session
with a few pieces of new information or coming away excited and committed
to use the information immediately. At my training sessions, people often tell
me, “I think this kind of stuff will work but I know you believe it, and that
motivates me.”
Speak with the instructor beforehand by phone or in person, and consider
the following:
 Is the instructor standoffish or does she relate well with people?
 Is the instructor excited about the topics she addresses?
 Are you comfortable asking the instructor questions?
 Do you feel the instructor is interested in and responsive to your 
particular needs and situation?
308
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

If you can’t speak directly with the instructor beforehand, try to speak with
someone who has attended a program led by this instructor. Although getting
information through someone else’s eyes is better than having none at all,
remember that each person looks for different qualities in an instructor and
each person’s perceptions are unique. You get the most-reliable information
by talking with the scheduled speaker yourself.
Organizational credentials
Be sure the information is in accordance with the best practices in the field.
One way to verify this is to confirm that the organization is approved by the
PMI as a Registered Education Provider (REP). You can read more about this
status at the PMI Web site: www.PMI.org.
Working with a mentor
A mentor is a person who’ll be your coach, counselor, and ongoing source of
expertise. In addition to clarifying general issues and concepts for you, your
mentor can help you
 Find opportunities to apply your new skills and techniques on your job.
 Understand your organization’s project-management policies, proce-
dures, and practices.
 Help you deal with any difficulties you encounter when trying out your
new techniques.
 Serve as an objective observer to assess how well you’re putting your
new skills into use.
In many ways, a mentor is like a personal tutor. As such, all of the considera-
tions for choosing an instructor (see the previous section for more info) also
apply when selecting a mentor. In addition, look for someone
 Whom you respect and who has successfully managed projects in your
organization.
 Who understands the current project management policies, procedures,
and practices in your organization.
 With whom you feel comfortable discussing difficult questions and 
situations.
 Who is willing and able to devote the time necessary to help you
improve your project-management practices.
309
Chapter 18: Improving Individual and Organizational Skills and Practices

Working with a mentor is less structured than attending a predesigned train-
ing program. Therefore, to derive the most benefit from your relationship,
agree with your mentor beforehand what topics and issues you’ll address.
Then develop specific indicators to describe how well you use your new
tools and techniques. And finally, develop a schedule specifying the actions
you’ll take and the times you’ll meet to review your experiences.
Obtaining a professional certification
Attending a training program and working with a mentor can directly improve
your project management skills, knowledge, and practices. However, profes-
sional certification goes one step further because it confirms your abilities 
to clients, employers, co-workers, and colleagues.
The most widely known and accepted credential in this field is the PMP certi-
fication awarded by the PMI. This credential confirms that you: have demon-
strated a knowledge of project best-management practices (as described in
the Project Management Body of Knowledge published by PMI); have attained
a certain level of education and actual experience working in the field of pro-
ject management; are committed to abide by the PMI professional code of
conduct; and are committed to continued participation and learning in the
field. You can find out more information about the PMP and other certifica-
tions that the PMI offers at www.PMI.org.
Although the credential signifies a certain level of achievement in the field,
the real benefit comes through the knowledge you gain and the work you do
to qualify for the certification.
Bringing Improved Project Management
Practices to the Workplace
Knowing best practices isn’t the same as actually using them. To improve
your project management in the workplace, you must first recognize situa-
tions where you can apply new techniques and approaches and be totally
familiar with how to apply them. You also need to be willing to help others
understand how to adopt the new practices, and you have to unlearn the 
ineffective practices you’ve been using.
This section can help you prepare an action plan to change your own prac-
tices and help other people improve theirs. The section also helps you recog-
nize resources that can help you accomplish this plan.
310
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

Using your new skills and knowledge
The key to incorporating your new skills and techniques into your normal
work process is to use them early and often. Keep the following points in
mind as you choose opportunities to use your new tools:
 Choose one or two skills or techniques you want to begin using. You
may want to start using several techniques, so choosing only one can
seem uncomfortable. Unfortunately, experience shows that making
numerous changes in your work methods all at once only increases the
chances that none of them will stick. Use the new skill until it’s second
nature to you. Then choose one or two more new skills and repeat the
process.
 Commit to using these skills or techniques in every situation that pre-
sents itself. Your aim is to make these techniques a habit, a reflex action
that you perform naturally. Therefore, remove the choice about whether
to use them. Practice makes perfect when developing a new skill or tech-
nique. (Do I sound just like your old piano teacher?)
 Begin with work activities that are small in scope and aren’t in crisis
mode. Trying a new technique is difficult enough; don’t initiate it when
people are already in a panic, jumping down your throat and demanding
immediate results.
 Use your new techniques on any work assignment, even one that’s not
formally designated a project. These techniques work on any work
activity that has to produce a particular result in a specified time with
set resources. You’re looking for all opportunities where you can use
your new approach.
 Apply your techniques to new projects as well as projects in progress.
When you choose a project in progress, prepare a plan that takes you
from today to your destination. Don’t spend time critiquing what you
should have done on the completed portion of your project.
 Use your new techniques even if your organization has no formal 
project-management processes and procedures in place. Remember,
you’re using these techniques to guide your approach to your assign-
ments, not to change the entire organization’s approach.
 Use your skills and knowledge whether you’re a team member or a
project leader. Just be sure to clearly define the boundaries of the
assignment you address.
 Don’t worry about having permission to use these new tools. As long
as you don’t directly violate existing organizational procedures and
guidelines, people are more interested in the results you produce than
the methods you use.
311
Chapter 18: Improving Individual and Organizational Skills and Practices

Prepare a written action plan detailing specific steps to use your new skills
and knowledge and when to take them. Because adopting your new tech-
niques is a project in itself, include the same information in your action plan
as in your project plan.
When developing your action plan, be sure you describe the exact behaviors
you want to adopt. For example, suppose writing your project objectives
clearly and unambiguously is the behavior you want to adopt. You can
describe this desired behavior in two ways:
Not specific: “Describe desired outcomes clearly.”
Better: “For every project objective statement, develop one or more mea-
sures to assess the extent of the objective’s achievement. For every mea-
sure, develop one or more performance specifications that represent
success.”
The second alternative provides a much clearer picture of the exact behaviors
you want to adopt.
In addition, identify one or more people who agree to observe your perfor-
mance and provide objective and honest feedback. Specify the dates you’ll
meet with them to discuss their assessments.
Sharing your new skills and knowledge
As you become more comfortable with your new abilities and can see your
improved performance, you may want to share your new skills with other
people. Unfortunately, if you tell your team members to use this wonderful,
new technique, they’ll probably respond with skepticism and resistance.
Remember, you needed some time to understand and recognize the potential
value of these tools before you were willing to try them out.
The following suggestions can help you be most effective in sharing your new
skills and knowledge:
 Show people that a technique works and how to use it instead of
trying to convince them. In other words, use the techniques yourself
and let people see your process and its effects. People are always inter-
ested in techniques they believe will help achieve their goals.
 Don’t use technical jargon or acronyms. Let the tool or technique
speak for itself. Instead of telling people how a Linear Responsibility
Chart helps you clarify team-member roles, just mention (if someone
asks you) that you use a simple table that displays how each resource
relates to each project activity.
312
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

 Focus on the results you achieved with the tool, rather than the ways
to use the tool. People adopt a practice because they think it helps them
achieve their goals, not because someone else told them it was a good
idea. When people see you succeeding at your assignments, they’ll ask
whether you’re using any special techniques.
Through your organization’s intranet
As you look for ways to share your information with a wider audience, con-
sider establishing a location on the organization’s intranet that’s dedicated to
general and organization-specific project-management issues and informa-
tion. Items may include
 Current versions of the organization’s project-management-related 
policies and procedures.
 All announcements, memos, and written materials addressing project-
management issues and activities in the organization.
 Examples of well-prepared planning and control documents from actual
organization projects.
 Professional and technical articles on project-management topics.
Through informal means
Another way to share the information is to hold informal sessions during
lunch or after work where the group addresses selected topics. Consider
asking speakers from inside and outside the organization to discuss general
techniques and approaches and organization-specific issues and practices.
Through your organization’s project management office
You can also offer to work with the organization’s Project Management Office
(PMO) to help improve project-management practices; if one doesn’t exist,
you can suggest that the organization create one.
A PMO serves as a central point for an organization’s project-management-
related activities. Typically, PMOs fall in one of two categories:
 A relatively small group of people who do some or all of the following
tasks:
• Develop, distribute, and maintain organization project-management-
related policies, procedures, and forms
• Help develop staff project-management capabilities through mentor-
ing or by providing more formal training
• Maintain a central file of information about ongoing or completed
organization projects
313
Chapter 18: Improving Individual and Organizational Skills and Practices

• Consolidate information and prepare periodic progress reports 
for organization projects
• Maintain a library of general project-management-related 
information
• Maintain the project-management portion of the organization’s
intranet
• Perform or help other people perform selected project-management
activities in ongoing projects
 The organizational unit to which all project managers are functionally
assigned. In addition to performing the preceding activities, select man-
agers in this unit manage the organization’s more complex efforts.

Monitoring Project Performance
with Earned Value Management
In This Chapter
 Understanding Earned Value Management
 Interpreting variances
 Approximating an activity’s Earned Value
B
ecause you’re reading this chapter, I assume you’re looking for a way to
assess your ongoing project performance. Earned Value Management
(EVM), formerly called Earned Value Analysis (EVA) is a technique that helps
determine your project’s schedule status and cost status from your resource
expenditures alone. EVM is particularly useful for identifying potential prob-
lems on larger projects.
To get the most from this chapter, you should have some prior experience or
knowledge in project management. This chapter helps you better understand
EVM by defining it, discussing how to determine and interpret variances, and
showing you how to use it in your project.
Defining Earned Value Management
(EVM)
Monitoring your project’s performance entails determining whether you’re
ahead or behind schedule and over or under budget. However, just compar-
ing your actual expenditures with your budget normally can’t tell you
whether you’re over or under budget. With EVM, you can assess your pro-
ject’s schedule and expenditures based on your expenditures to date.
In this section, I explain many of the terms you may encounter when you do
an EVM analysis.

316
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Understanding the EVM formulas
Suppose you’re three months into your project and you’ve spent $50,000.
According to your plan, you shouldn’t have spent $50,000 until the end of the
fourth month of your project. You appear to be over budget at this point, but
you can’t tell for sure. Either of the following situations may have produced
these results:
 You may have performed all the scheduled work, but you paid more
than you expected to — this means you’re on schedule but over budget.
 You may have performed more work than you scheduled, but you paid
exactly what you expected — this means you’re on budget and ahead of
schedule.
Of course, many other situations can produce these same results. However,
when you use EVM, you get a more accurate picture of the true reasons for
this behavior.
With EVM, you determine
 Cost variance: The difference between what you planned to spend by a
certain date and what you really spent that represents a true cost sav-
ings or a loss.
 Schedule variance: The difference between what you planned to spend
by a certain date and what you really spent that’s due to being ahead of
or behind schedule.
 Estimate at completion: The total amount you’ll spend to perform this
task if your present spending pattern continues to the end of the task.
Figure 19-1 depicts the key information in an EVM analysis. As illustrated, the
difference between planned and actual expenditures on the date of the report
is due to the combined effects of a schedule delay and a cost savings.
You can calculate cost and schedule variances as well as the estimate at com-
pletion from the following information:
 Planned Value (PV) is the approved budget to complete a particular
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) element, also referred to as the
Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS). See a complete discussion of
the WBS in Chapter 4.
 Actual Cost (AC) is the total costs actually incurred for work done
during a specified time period on a particular WBS element, also
referred to as the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).
 Earned Value (EV) is the approved budget for work done during a speci-
fied period for a particular WBS element, also referred to as the Budgeted
Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).

Cost and schedule variances are defined mathematically as follows:
Cost variance (CV) = EV – AC
Schedule variance (SV) = EV – PV
In other words, the cost variance for a specified date is the difference
between the budgeted amount for the work that you’ve actually completed
and the actual amount you’ve spent. The schedule variance is the difference
between the budgeted amount for what you planned to do and the budgeted
amount for what you actually did.
You can determine the cost variance percentage (CVP) and the schedule vari-
ance percentage (SVP) using the following formulas:
CVP = CV ÷ EV × 100
SVP = SV ÷ PV × 100
Table 19-1 illustrates that a positive variance indicates something desirable (that
is, you’re either under budget or ahead of schedule) and a negative variance indi-
cates something undesirable (you’re either over budget or behind schedule).

Chapter 19: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management

Finally, determine the Estimate at Completion (EAC), your estimate of the
total expenditures for completing a WBS element based on the expenditure
history to date as follows:
Estimate at Completion (EAC) = AC ÷ EV × total budget
This estimate is simplistic because it assumes that the spending patterns
through the end of the project will be the same as they’ve been up until now.
Of course, circumstances may change the expenditure pattern or you may
choose to alter the pattern if you’ve been overspending and want to get back
on track.
Looking at a simple example
These terms and definitions (see the previous section) are easier to under-
stand when you consider an example. Suppose you’re planning to conduct a
series of telephone interviews. Your interview guide is ready and each phone
interview is independent of the others. You state the following in your project
plan:
 Your project will last ten months.
 You plan to conduct 100 interviews each month.
 You plan to spend $300 to conduct each interview.
 Your total project budget is $300,000.
During your first month, you do the following:
 Conduct 75 interviews
 Spend a total of $15,000
Because you planned to conduct 100 interviews in the first month and you
only conducted 75, you’re behind schedule. But, because you planned to
spend $300 per interview and you only spent $200 ($15,000 ÷ 75 interviews =
$200 per interview), you’re under budget. This example gives you a chance to
calculate and then interpret the EV information.
1. Determine the planned value, earned value, and actual costs at the
end of the month as follows:
Planned Value (PV) = Budgeted amount for the 100 interviews you
planned to conduct in the first month
318
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

= 100 interviews × $300 per interview = $30,000
Actual Costs (AC) = Actual costs for the first month
= $15,000
Earned Value (EV) = Budgeted amount for the 75 interviews you actually
conducted in the first month
= 75 interviews × $300 per interview = $22,500
2. Determine your cost and schedule performance during the month as
follows:
Cost Variance (CV) = EV – AC
= $22,500 – $15,000 = $7,500
Schedule Variance (SV) 
= EV – PV
= $22,500 – $30,000 = –$7,500
3. The cost variance and schedule variance percentages are as follows:
CVP = CV ÷ EV  × 100
= $7,500 ÷ $22,500 × 100 = 33%
SVP = SV ÷ PV × 100
= –$7,500 ÷ $30,000  × 100 = –25%
The CVP and SVP make sense when you look at the actual numbers for the
month. You originally planned to spend $300 per interview, but in the first
month you actually spent $200 per interview ($15,000 actual costs ÷ 75 inter-
views conducted). The actual cost per interview is $100 (or 33 percent) less
than your planned per-interview cost ($100 ÷ $300 × 100 = 33%). This means
you’re 33 percent under budget, just as your CVP indicates.
You originally planned to conduct 100 interviews in the first month, but you
only finished 75. You actually conducted 25 percent fewer interviews in the
first month than you planned (100 – 75) ÷ 100 × 100 = –25%). This means
you’re 25% behind schedule, just as the SVP indicates.
If your work continues in the same fashion for the remainder of your project,
your total project expenditures at completion will be as follows:
EAC = AC ÷ EV × total budget = $15,000 ÷ $22,500 × $300,000 = $200,000
In other words, if you continue to perform your interviews for $200 each
rather than the planned $300 each, you’ll spend two-thirds of your total
planned budget to complete all 100 interviews.
319
Chapter 19: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management

Although you don’t need a formal EVM analysis on a project this simple, in a
project with 50 to 100 activities or more, an EVM analysis can help identify gen-
eral trends in your project’s cost and schedule performance. The earlier you
identify such trends, the more easily you can counteract — or enjoy — them.
Determining the reasons 
for observed variances
Positive or negative values of the cost or schedule variances indicate your
project performance isn’t going exactly as you planned. After you determine
that a variance exists, you want to figure out the reason(s) so you can take
corrective actions (if the variance is negative) or be sure you continue what
you’ve been doing (if the variance is positive).
Possible reasons for positive or negative cost variances are as follows:
 Your project requires more or less work to complete a task than you
originally planned.
 The people performing the work are more or less productive than
planned.
 The actual unit costs of labor or materials are more or less than
planned.
 Actual organization indirect rates are higher or lower than you originally
planned. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of indirect rates and how they
can affect your project expenditures.)
Possible reasons for positive or negative schedule variances are as follows:
 Work is running ahead of or behind schedule.
 The project requires more or less work than you originally planned.
 People performing the work are more or less productive than planned.
Applying EVM to Your Project: 
The How-To
If your project is more complex than the previous example (see the earlier
section “Looking at a simple example”), you may consider using EVM to help
control performance. By providing cost and schedule performance assess-
ments of both the total project and its major parts, EVM allows you to identify
the likely problem areas so you can take the most effective corrective actions.
320
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

The following example in this section presents a more realistic illustration of
how EVM can support insightful analysis of your project’s performance.
Suppose the Acme Company has awarded a contract for the production of
two specialized and complex corporate brochures to Copies ‘R’ Us. The con-
tract calls for Copies ‘R’ Us to produce 500 copies of Brochure A and 1,000
copies of Brochure B. It further states that Copies ‘R’ Us will produce
Brochure A at the rate of 100 per month and Brochure B at the rate of 250 per
month. Production of Brochure A is to start on January 1 and production of
Brochure B on February 1.
Table 19-2 depicts the project plan.

Suppose it’s the end of March, and you’re three months into the project.

321
Chapter 19: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management

1. Determine your cost and schedule performance for the production of
Brochure A through March 31.
PV = $200 per brochure × 100 brochures per month × 3 months = 
$60,000
EV = $200 per brochure  × 150 brochures = $30,000
Cost variance (CV) = EV – AC
= $30,000 – $45,000 = –$15,000
CVP
= CV ÷ EV × 100
= –$15,000 ÷ $30,000  × 100 = –50%
Schedule variance (SV)
= EV – PV
SV
= $30,000 – $60,000 = –$30,000
SVP
= SV ÷ PV  × 100
= –$30,000 ÷ $60,000 = –50%
Your analysis reveals that production of Brochure A is 50 percent behind
schedule and 50 percent over budget.
2. Determine your cost and schedule performance for the production of
Brochure B through March 31.
PV = $100 per brochure  × 250 brochures per month  × 2 months =
$50,000
AC = $30,000
EV = $100 per brochure × 600 brochures = $60,000
Cost variance (CV)
= EV – AC
= $60,000 – $30,000 = $30,000
CVP
= CV ÷ BCWP × 100
= $30,000 ÷ $60,000  × 100 = 50%
Schedule variance (SV)
= EV – PV
SV
= $60,000 – $50,000 = $10,000
SVP
= SV ÷ BCWS × 100
= $10,000 ÷ $50,000  × 100 = 20%
Your analysis reveals that production of Brochure B is 20 percent ahead
of schedule and 50 percent under budget.
322
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

3. Determine the overall status of your project by adding the individual
cost and schedule variances for Brochures A and B.
Project Cost Variance = –$15,000 + $30,000 = $15,000
Project Schedule Variance
= –$30,000 + $10,000 = –$20,000
4. Determine your project estimate at completion by adding the individ-
ual estimates at completion for Brochures A and B.
EAC for Brochure A
= AC ÷ EV × Budget for Brochure A
= $45,000 ÷ $30,000 × $100,000 = $150,000
EAC for Brochure B
= AC ÷ EV × Budget for Brochure B
= $30,000 ÷ $60,000 × $100,000 = $50,000
EAC for the project
= EAC for Brochure A + EAC for 
Brochure B
= $150,000 + $50,000 = $200,000
Table 19-4 shows all this information.

If project production rates and costs remains the same until all the required
brochures are produced, then:
 You’ll finish on budget.
 You’ll finish five months late.
Because Brochure A is being produced at only half the anticipated rate, fin-
ishing all of them will take twice the time originally planned.
323
Chapter 19: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management

Calculating Earned Value
The key to a meaningful EVM analysis lies in the accuracy of your estimates
of EV. To determine EV, you must estimate
 How much of a task you’ve completed to date.
 How much of the task’s total budget you planned to spend for the
amount of work you’ve achieved.
If you assume a direct relationship between the portion of a task you’ve com-
pleted and the amount of funds you should have spent and if you’ve com-
pleted 60 percent of the task, then you should have spent 60 percent of the
total task budget.
For tasks with separate components, like printing brochures or conducting
telephone surveys, determining how much of a task you’ve completed is
straightforward. However, if your task entails an integrated work- or thought-
process with no easily divisible parts (such as designing the brochure), the
best you can do is to make an educated guess.
Figure 19-2 illustrates the following three approaches to estimate EV in differ-
ent situations. The milestone method and 50/50 method allow you to approxi-
mate EV without estimating the portion of a task that you’ve completed.
Choosing which of the three methods to use for your project requires you to
weigh the potential for accuracy against the possible misleading conclusions
from subjective data.

Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 

 Percent-complete method: EV is the product of the fraction represent-
ing activity-completion and the total activity budget.
This method is potentially the most accurate if you correctly determine
the fraction of the activity you have completed. However, because that
estimate depends on your subjective judgment, this approach is also
most vulnerable to errors or purposeful manipulation.
 Milestone method: EV is zero until you complete the activity, and it’s
100 percent of the total activity budget after you complete it.
The milestone method is the most conservative and the least accurate.
You expect to spend some money while you’re working on the task.
However, this method doesn’t allow you to declare EV greater than $0
until you’ve completed the entire activity. Therefore, you’ll always
appear over budget while you perform the activity.
 50/50 method: EV is zero before you start the activity, 50 percent of the
total activity budget after you start it, and 100 percent of the activity
budget after you finish the activity.
The 50/50 method is a closer approximation to reality than the mile-
stone method because you can declare an EV greater than $0 while you
perform the task. However, this approximation can inadvertently mask
overspending.
Figure 19-2 compares the accuracy of the three different methods for a simple
example. Task 1.2 has three subtasks: 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3. For this illustra-
tion, assume that you know the following amounts of completed work on
each subtask:
 Subtask 1.2.1 is complete.
 Subtask 1.2.2 is 75 percent complete.
 Subtask 1.2.3 is 20 percent complete.
The EV of Task 1.2 is the sum of the EVs for each of the three subtasks in Task
1.2. According to the percent-complete method, the actual EV should be
$31,000. (Remember, you can only use this method if you can accurately esti-
mate the percentage of the entire task that you’ve completed.)
Suppose you’ve completed 30 percent of a task with a $10,000 budget.
Arguably, you should have spent about 30 percent of your budget, or $3,000,
to complete 30 percent of the work on the task. However, the 50/50 method
approximates your EV at $5,000 (50 percent of the total budget for the task).
So, if your actual cost for the work was $4,000, you’re $1,000 over budget.
However, using the 50/50 method to estimate your EV, your expenditures of
$4,000 (compared with your approximated EV of $5,000) appear to be $1,000
under budget.
325
Chapter 19: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management

When you use either the 50/50 method or the milestone method, observe the
following guidelines to improve the accuracy of your EV estimates:
 Define your lowest-level activities (see Chapter 4 on Work Breakdown
Structures) to be relatively short, usually two weeks or less.
When you determine activity status for your progress assessments,
most activities will not have started or will be finished, thereby increas-
ing the accuracy of your EV estimates.
 Subdivide activities into components of short duration, determine the
EV for each of these components, and add them together to determine
the EV for the entire activity. Again, doing this increases the chances
that activities either will not have started or will be finished when you
do your performance assessment.

nice. However, when a crisis hits, you may want to reference
a few handy tips to head off potential disaster.
Just like every For Dummies book, this part gives you tidbits
of interesting information to access as needed. I share tips
for how to plan a project and how to be a better project
manager.
And don’t stop now! This part also includes two helpful
appendixes. Appendix A lists definitions for a wide range

that I discuss throughout this book.

Chapter 20
Ten Questions to Help You 
Plan Your Project
In This Chapter
 Clarifying your project’s purpose
 Describing outcomes, schedules, and resources
 Addressing the uncertainties
W
hen you begin a project, you always feel the pressure to jump in and
start working to meet the aggressive time schedules. You want to be
sure it’s planned out before you start, but you’re not quite sure where to
begin, and you’re always under pressure to start producing results.
Answer the following questions in this chapter to be sure you’ve completely
identified all the work your project will require.
What’s the Purpose of Your Project?
As soon as you’re assigned to your project, get a clear and complete picture
of its significance. Determine the following:
 What situation(s) led to your project?
 Who had the original idea?
 Who else hopes to benefit from it?
 What would happen if your project weren’t done?
An accurate appreciation of your project’s purpose can lead to better plans, a
greater sense of team-member commitment, and improved performance. See
Chapters 2 and 3 for discussions of a project’s purpose.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Whom Do You Need to Involve?
Knowing early whom you need to involve allows you to plan for their partici-
pation at the appropriate times. Involving these people in a timely manner
ensures their input will be available when it’s needed and lets them know
that you value and respect their contributions.
As you determine who may play a role in your project’s success, categorize
them as follows:
 Drivers: People looking for your project’s results.
 Supporters: People who can help your project succeed.
 Observers: People interested in your project.
After you have this comprehensive list, decide whom to involve and when
and how you want to involve them. (See Chapters 3, 9, and 10 for more infor-
mation on identifying project audiences.)
What Results Will You Produce?
Specify all the outcomes you expect your project to produce. Be sure that
you describe clearly each product, service, or impact; make the outcomes
measurable and include performance targets.
Confirm that your project’s drivers (see Chapter 3) believe these outcomes
meet their needs and expectations. See Chapter 2 for more discussion about
framing your project objectives.
What Constraints Must You Satisfy?
Identify all information, processes, and guidelines that may restrict your pro-
ject activities and your performance. Distinguish between the following:
 Limitations: Restrictions that people outside your project team set.
 Needs: Restrictions that you and your project team members establish.
When you know your constraints, then you can plan to minimize their effect
on your project. See Chapter 2 for more information on project constraints
and ways to overcome them.

What Assumptions Are You Making?
As soon as you begin thinking about your project, document all assumptions
about its key information because each of these assumptions leads to one or
more project risks that you may choose to plan for in advance. Continue
adding to your list of assumptions as you develop the parts of your plan.
Update your plans whenever an assumption changes or you find out its
actual value. See Chapter 2 for further details about project assumptions.
What Work Must Be Done?
Identify all the activities required to complete your project so you can assign
responsibilities for them, develop schedules, estimate resource needs, give
specific tasks to team members, and track your project during performance.
For each activity, specify
 The work to be done: The processes and steps that each activity
requires.
 Inputs: All people, facilities, equipment, supplies, raw materials, funds,
and information necessary to perform each activity.
 Results you expect: Products, services, or situations that you expect
each activity to produce.
 Interdependencies: Activities that you must complete before you can
start the next one; activities you can start after you’ve completed the
current one.
 Duration: The actual calendar time to perform each activity.
See Chapter 4 for information on describing project work.
When Does Each Activity Start and End?
Develop a detailed schedule with clearly defined activities and frequent inter-
mediate milestones. Having this information allows you to give team mem-
bers precise guidance on when to perform their assignments. This
information also supports your ongoing monitoring and control of work in
progress. Take the following into account when you create your schedule:
331
Chapter 20: Ten Questions to Help You Plan Your Project

 Duration: The actual calendar time to perform each individual activity.
 Interdependencies: What you must finish before you can begin your
activity.
 Resource availability: When you need particular resources and when
they’re available.
See Chapter 5 for more information on how to develop a project schedule.
Who Will Perform the Project Work?
Knowing who will perform each task and how much effort they’ll have to
devote allows you to plan for their availability and more accurately estimate
the overall project budget. Specify the following information for all people
who need to work on your project:
 Identify each person by name, by position description or title, or by the
skills and knowledge required to do the assignment.
 When more than one person must work on the same activity, describe
the specific roles and how these people can coordinate their efforts.
 Specify the level of effort each person has to invest.
 If a person will work less than full time on an activity, specify exactly
when she will work.
Consult with the people who’ll perform the project tasks to develop this
information. See Chapter 6 for help with estimating personnel requirements.
What Other Resources Do You Need?
Identify all equipment, facilities, services, supplies, and funds that you need
to perform your project work. Specify how much of each resource you’ll need
and when. See Chapter 7 for more discussion on how to identify nonperson-
nel resources.
What Can Go Wrong?
Identify those parts of your project that may not go according to plan. Decide
which risks pose the greatest dangers to your project’s success and develop
plans to minimize their negative effects. See Chapter 8 for information on
how to address project risks.

Chapter 21
Ten Tips for Being a Better 
Project Manager
In This Chapter
 Being proactive
 Encouraging others
 Communicating effectively
S
uccessful project management depends not just on what you do, but also
on how you do it. Your attitudes and behaviors toward people affect how
they respond to you. If I could, I’d place a large Tip icon on this entire chap-
ter. This chapter can help you successfully win people’s support.
Be a “Why” Person
Look for the reasons behind requests and actions. Understanding why helps
ensure you respond appropriately to team members, upper managers, and all
other project audiences (which increases people’s motivation and buy-in.)
First find out reasons for yourself, and then share the information with other
people. (Check out Chapter 2 to find out more about how you can be a why
person.)
Be a “Can-Do” Person
Look at all problems as challenges and find ways to overcome them. Be cre-
ative, flexible, and tenacious. Keep working at the problem until you solve it.
(Flip to Chapters 2, 4, 5, and 12 for more on how to be a tenacious problem
solver.)

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Say What You Mean; 
Mean What You Say
Communicate clearly. Be specific, letting people know exactly what you
mean. Tell them what you want them to know, what you want them to do,
what you’ll do for them. You may think that being vague gives you more
leeway. In reality, being vague just increases the chances for misunderstand-
ing. (Check out Chapter 13 for ways to communicate clearly.)
View People as Allies, Not Adversaries
Focus on common goals, not individual agendas. Making people feel comfort-
able encourages brainstorming, creative thinking, and the willingness to try
new ideas. But viewing and treating people as adversaries can put them on
the defensive and encourage them to become enemies. (Refer to Chapters 3
and 14, where I tell you how to get people on your side.)
Respect Other People
Focus on people’s strengths rather than their weaknesses. Find a quality in
each person that you can respect. People work harder and enjoy their work
more when they’re around others who appreciate them. (See Chapter 14 to
find more helpful tidbits on respecting people.)
Think Big Picture
Keep events in perspective. Understand where you want to go and how your
plan will get you there. Recognize the effect of your actions on current and
future efforts. Share your vision with other people. (Flip to Chapters 2 and 14
for ways you can keep your project elements in perspective.)
Think Detail
Be thorough. If you don’t think your project’s issues through, who will? The
more clearly you describe your intended results, the more easily people can
recognize the associated benefits. And the more clearly you define your

intended work, the more often people will ask important and insightful ques-
tions — and believe that they can perform the work successfully. Clarity
leads to increased personal motivation and reduced chances of mistakes.
(Check out Chapters 2 and 4 for tips on thinking in detail.)
Assume Cautiously
Take the time to find out the facts; use assumptions only as a last resort. With
every assumption comes a risk that you’re wrong. The fewer the assump-
tions, the more confidence you can have in your plan.
Acknowledge Good Performance
Take a moment to acknowledge good performance. Tell the person, tell the
person’s boss, tell team members, and tell the person’s peers. Recognizing
good performance confirms to a person the accuracy and value of his work;
your praise tells a person that you appreciate his efforts, which motivates
him to work with you and other team members on future projects.
When acknowledging a person’s performance, mention the quality of the
results he accomplished as well as the effort he invested. Be specific — tell
the person exactly what he did or produced that you appreciate. Provide
your feedback promptly. (See Chapter 14 for more about acknowledging good
performance.)
Be a Manager and a Leader
Attend to people as well as to information, processes, and systems. Create
and share your vision and excitement in addition to a sense of order and effi-
ciency. Encourage people to strive for outstanding results and provide the
guidance and support to achieve those results. (See Chapter 14 for more
information about management and leadership.)

Appendix B
Combining the Techniques into
Smooth Flowing Processes
You’ll use the tools and techniques in this book many times during your
project — as you hammer out your initial plan, monitor work in progress
and its results, and continue to tweak the details as necessary. Even though
you can’t avoid surprises or changes as your project unfolds, you can pro-
vide logical order for your project’s planning and its control activities. This
sense of order discourages bad surprises (and their faithful companions —
change and redirection). In this appendix, I illustrate this order.
Preparing Your Project Plan
Figure B-1 depicts the steps in project planning and the parts of the plan that
you produce along the way.
When you receive a project assignment, you can take the following steps:
1. Clarify the reasons for the project and the desired outcomes.
Figure B-1 illustrates the two important activities you need to do:
• Identify the audiences who will have a say in your project.
• Get all info from the audiences and written sources about 
expectations.
Perform these two activities interactively because the initial statement
of your assignment may suggest additional audiences. Those audiences,
in turn, may raise more issues to address. The outcomes from these
activities are a Statement of Work (SOW) and an Audience List. (See
Chapter 2 for preparing a SOW and Chapter 3 for putting an Audience
List together.)

2. After you know all the results your project is to achieve, identify the
work required to produce them.
Record this information in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). See
Chapter 4 for information on how to prepare a WBS.

3. Consider the WBS and the Audience List together to decide on each
audience’s roles and responsibilities for each project activity.
Display this information in a Linear Responsibility Chart. (See Chapter
10 for a discussion on preparing a Linear Responsibility Chart.)
4. Create and analyze a network diagram of the activities from the WBS
to develop a schedule that your project drivers require and that your
project supporters believe is possible.
Display your final schedule in a Key-Events List, an Activities Plan, or a
Gantt chart. (See Chapter 5 for how to prepare and display a project
schedule.)
5. Estimate your resource needs, which you display in a Resource
Matrix, Resource Loading Chart, and a project budget. See Chapters 6
and 7 for preparing and displaying project resource needs.
6. Identify, analyze, and plan for any significant project risks. See
Chapter 8 for suggestions on dealing with project risks.
Continue working on each step in this initial process until all project drivers
and supporters agree with and support your results.
Controlling Your Project 
during Performance
Figure B-2 illustrates the steps you routinely perform to monitor and control
your project throughout its performance.
To monitor and control your project, follow these steps:
1. At the start of each performance period, reconfirm that the necessary
people and resources are available and scheduled in accordance with
your current project plan.
2. At the end of each period:
• Gather activity start and end dates, milestone dates, resources
expenditures, and the results of quality assessments.
• Compare the actual results with planned results, identify any
issues or problems, and take any necessary corrective actions.
3. Report your progress for the period to your project audiences. See
Chapters 12 and 13 for information on tracking, assessing, and reporting
project performance.
