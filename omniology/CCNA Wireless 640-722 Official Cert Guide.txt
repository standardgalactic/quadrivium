About the Technical Reviewer
Jerome Henry, CCIE Wireless No. 24750, is technical marketing engineer in the 
Wireless Enterprise Networking Group at Cisco systems. Jerome has close to 15 years 
experience teaching technical Cisco courses in more than 15 different countries and 4 
different languages, to audiences ranging from bachelor degree students to networking 
professionals and Cisco internal system engineers.
Focusing on his wireless experience, Jerome joined Cisco in 2012. Before that time, he 
was consulting and teaching Heterogeneous Networks and Wireless Integration with 
the European Airespace team, which was later acquired by Cisco to become their main 
wireless solution. He then spent several years with a Cisco Learning partner, develop-
ing wireless courses, and working on training material for new wireless technologies. In 
addition to his CCIE Wireless certification, Jerome is a certified wireless networking 
expert (CWNE #45) and has developed several Cisco courses focusing on wireless top-

Dedications
As always, this book is dedicated to the most important people in my life: my wife, 
Marci, and my two daughters, Lauren and Kara. Their love, encouragement, and sup-
port carry me along. I’m so grateful to God, who gives endurance and encouragement 
(Romans 15:5), and who has allowed me to enjoy networking and work on projects like 
this.
I would also like to dedicate this book to the memory of my father-in-law, Ermel 
Wilson. He helped me appreciate the simpler things in life—the outdoors, hikes in the 
woods, and snow.

Acknowledgments
It has been my great pleasure to work on another Cisco Press project. I enjoy the net-
working field very much, and technical writing even more. And more than that, I’m 
thankful for the joy and inner peace that Jesus Christ gives, making everything more 
abundant and worthwhile. As much as I enjoy learning about wireless networking (there’s 
no end to it!), I realize that God created the original wireless connection that has no 
distance limits, unlimited capacity for clients (there’s always room for one more), is trust-
worthy, always available everywhere, and connects directly to the Source: prayer!
I’ve now been writing Cisco Press titles continuously for what will soon be 15 years. I 
have physically worn out several laptop keyboards and probably several Cisco Press edi-
tors in the process. It has been a great pleasure to work with Chris Cleveland and Mary 
Beth Ray. I should have a certification in schedule slipping by now. Keith Cline and Seth 
Kerney have been great to work with and have made the whole review process smooth 
and efficient. One important part of the book I never get to see is the index. I’m grateful 
that Tim Wright worked on this one.
I am very grateful for the insight, knowledge, and helpful comments that Jerome Henry 
has provided. He is a great resource for wireless networking expertise and training. 
Jerome’s input has made this a more well-rounded book and me a more educated author.
Finally, I have enjoyed the good discussions with my dad, Reid Hucaby, a fellow EE and 
a seasoned RF engineer, that this book has prompted about all things wireless.

Introduction
Welcome to the world of Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Wireless! As tech-
nology continues to evolve, wireless technologies are finding their way to the forefront. 
This clearly indicates the progression from a fixed wired type of connectivity to a more 
fluid, mobile workforce that can work when, where, and how they want. Regardless of 
your background, one of the primary goals of the CCNA Wireless certification is to 
introduce you to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN).
This book is designed to help you prepare for the Cisco CCNA Wireless 640-722 
IUWNE (Implementing Cisco Unified Wireless Networking Essentials) certification 
exam. To achieve the CCNA Wireless specialization, you must first pass the ICND1, 
ICND2, or the CCNA Composite exam.

xxi
Who Should Read This Book
Wireless networking is a complex business. The CCNA Wireless specialization was 
developed to introduce wireless LANs, the CUWN, and Cisco’s wireless product line. 
The certification tests for proficiency in designing, installing, configuring, monitoring, 
and troubleshooting wireless networks in an enterprise setting.

Each chapter follows the same format and incorporates the following tools to assist you 
by assessing your current knowledge and emphasizing specific areas of interest within 
the chapter:
 ■
 Do I Already Know This Quiz?: Each chapter begins with a quiz to help you assess
your current knowledge of the subject. The quiz is divided into specific areas of
emphasis that enable you to best determine where to focus your efforts when work-
ing through the chapter.
 ■
 Foundation Topics: The foundation topics are the core sections of each chapter.
They focus on the specific protocols, concepts, or skills that you must master to
successfully prepare for the examination.
 ■
 Exam Preparation: Near the end of each chapter, this section highlights the key
topics from the chapter and the pages where you can find them for quick review.
This section also provides a list of key terms that you should be able to define in
preparation for the exam. It is unlikely that you will be able to successfully com-
plete the certification exam by just studying the key topics and key terms, although
they are a good tool for last-minute preparation just before taking the exam.
 ■
 CD-ROM-based practice exam: This book includes a CD-ROM containing several
interactive practice exams. It is recommended that you continue to test your knowl-
edge and test-taking skills by using these exams. You will find that your test-taking
skills will improve by continued exposure to the test format. Remember that the
potential range of exam questions is limitless. Therefore, your goal should not be to
“know” every possible answer but to have a sufficient understanding of the subject
matter so that you can figure out the correct answer with the information provided.
Pearson IT Certification Practice Test Engine and 
Questions on the CD-ROM
The CD-ROM in the back of the book includes the Pearson IT Certification Practice 
Test engine—software that displays and grades a set of exam-realistic multiple-choice 
questions. Using the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test engine, you can either study 
by going through the questions in Study Mode, or take a simulated exam that mimics 
real exam conditions. You can also serve up questions in a Flash Card Mode, which will 
display just the question and no answers, challenging you to state the answer in your 
own words before checking the actual answers to verify your work. 
The installation process requires two major steps: installing the software and then acti-
vating the exam. The CD in the back of this book has a recent copy of the Pearson IT 
Certification Practice Test engine. The practice exam (the database of exam questions) is 
not on the CD.

Note The cardboard CD case in the back of this book includes the CD and a piece of 
paper. The paper lists the activation code for the practice exam associated with this book. 
Do not lose the activation code. On the opposite side of the paper from the activation 
code is a unique, one-time-use coupon code for the purchase of the Premium Edition 
eBook and Practice Test.
Install the Software from the CD
The Pearson IT Certification Practice Test is a Windows-only desktop application. You 
can run it on a Mac using a Windows virtual machine, but it was built specifically for the 
PC platform. The minimum system requirements are as follows:
 ■
Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7, or Windows 8
 ■
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 Client
 ■
Pentium-class 1GHz processor (or equivalent)
 ■
512MB RAM
 ■
650MB disk space plus 50MB for each downloaded practice exam
 ■
Access to the Internet to register and download exam databases
The software installation process is routine as compared with other software installation 
processes. If you have already installed the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test soft-
ware from another Pearson product, there is no need for you to reinstall the software. 
Simply launch the software on your desktop and proceed to activate the practice exam 
from this book by using the activation code included in the CD sleeve.
The following steps outline the installation process:
 1.
Insert the CD into your PC.
 2.
The media interface that automatically runs allows you to access and use all
CD-based features, including the exam engine and sample content from other Cisco
self-study products. From the main menu, click the Install the Exam Engine option.
 3.
Respond to windows prompts as with any typical software installation process.
The installation process will give you the option to activate your exam with the activa-
tion code supplied on the paper in the CD sleeve. This process requires that you estab-
lish a Pearson website login. You need this login to activate the exam, so please do 
register when prompted. If you already have a Pearson website login, there is no need to 
register again. Just use your existing login.

xxv
Activate and Download the Practice Exam
Once the exam engine is installed, you should then activate the exam associated with 
this book (if you did not do so during the installation process) as follows:
 1. Start the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test software from the Windows Start
menu or from your desktop shortcut icon.
 2.
To activate and download the exam associated with this book, from the My
Products or Tools tab, click the Activate Exam button.
 3.
At the next screen, enter the activation key from paper inside the cardboard CD
holder in the back of the book. Once entered, click the Activate button.
 4.
The activation process will download the practice exam. Click Next, and then
click Finish.
When the activation process completes, the My Products tab should list your new exam. 
If you do not see the exam, make sure that you have selected the My Products tab on 
the menu. At this point, the software and practice exam are ready to use. Simply select 
the exam and click the Open Exam button.
To update a particular exam you have already activated and downloaded, display 
the Tools tab and click the Update Products button. Updating your exams will ensure 
that you have the latest changes and updates to the exam data.
If you want to check for updates to the Pearson Cert Practice Test exam engine soft-
ware, display the Tools tab and click the Update Application button. You can then 
ensure that you are running the latest version of the software engine.
Activating Other Exams
The exam software installation process, and the registration process, only has to happen 
once. Then, for each new exam, only a few steps are required. For instance, if you buy 
another Pearson IT Certification Cert Guide, extract the activation code from the CD 
sleeve in the back of that book; you do not even need the CD at this point. From there , 
all you have to do is start the exam engine (if not still up and running) and perform Steps 
2 through 4 from the previous list. 
Certification Exam Topics and This Book
The questions for each certification exam are a closely guarded secret. However, we do 
know which topics you must know to successfully complete this exam. Cisco pub-
lishes them as an exam blueprint for Implementing Cisco Unified Wireless Networking 
Essentials (IUWNE), exam 640-722. Table I-1 lists each exam topic listed in the blueprint 
along with a reference to the book chapter that covers the topic. These are the same 
topics you should be proficient in when working with Cisco wireless LANs in the real 
world.

Notice that not all the chapters map to a specific exam topic. Each version of the exam 
can have topics that emphasize different functions or features, and some topics can be 
rather broad and generalized. The goal of this book is to provide the most comprehen-
sive coverage to ensure that you are well prepared for the exam. Although some chap-
ters might not address specific exam topics, they provide a foundation that is necessary 
for a clear understanding of important topics. Your short-term goal might be to pass this 
exam, but your long-term goal should be to become a qualified wireless networking pro-
fessional. 
It is also important to understand that this book is a “static” reference, whereas the exam 
topics are dynamic. Cisco can and does change the topics covered on certification exams 
often. 
This exam guide should not be your only reference when preparing for the certifica-
tion exam. You can find a wealth of information available at Cisco.com that covers each 
topic in great detail. If you think that you need more detailed information on a specific 
topic, read the Cisco documentation that focuses on that topic. 
Note that as wireless technologies continue to develop, Cisco reserves the right to 
change the exam topics without notice. Although you can refer to the list of exam topics 
in Table I-1, always check Cisco.com to verify the actual list of topics to ensure that you 
are prepared before taking the exam. You can view the current exam topics on any cur-
rent Cisco certification exam by visiting the Cisco.com website, hovering over Training 
& Events, and selecting from the Certifications list. Note also that, if needed, Cisco 
Press might post additional preparatory content on the web page associated with this 
book at http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205620. It’s a good idea to check the 
website a couple of weeks before taking your exam to be sure that you have up-to-date 
content.

xxix
Taking the CCNA Wireless Certification Exam
As with any Cisco certification exam, you should strive to be thoroughly prepared 
before taking the exam. There is no way to determine exactly what questions are on the 
exam, so the best way to prepare is to have a good working knowledge of all subjects 
covered on the exam. Schedule yourself for the exam and be sure to be rested and ready 
to focus when taking the exam.
The best place to find out the latest available Cisco training and certifications is under 
the Training & Events section at Cisco.com.
Tracking Your Status
You can track your certification progress by checking http://www.cisco.com/go/
certifications/login. You must create an account the first time you log in to the site.
How to Prepare for an Exam
The best way to prepare for any certification exam is to use a combination of the prepa-
ration resources, labs, and practice tests. This guide has integrated some practice ques-
tions and example scenarios to help you better prepare. If possible, get some hands-on 
experience with CUWN equipment. There is no substitute for real-world experience; 
it is much easier to understand the designs, configurations, and concepts when you can 
actually work with a live wireless network. 
Cisco.com provides a wealth of information about wireless LAN controllers, access 
points (APs), and wireless management products, and wireless LAN technologies and 
features. 
Assessing Exam Readiness
Exam candidates never really know whether they are adequately prepared for the exam 
until they have completed about 30 percent of the questions. At that point, if you are 
not prepared, it is too late. The best way to determine your readiness is to work through 
the “Do I Know This Already?” quizzes at the beginning of each chapter and review 
the foundation and key topics presented in each chapter. It is best to work your way 
through the entire book unless you can complete each subject without having to do any 
research or look up any answers.
Cisco Wireless Certifications in the Real World
Cisco has one of the most recognized names on the Internet. Cisco Certified wireless 
specialists can bring quite a bit of knowledge to the table because of their deep under-
standing of wireless technologies, standards, and networking devices. This is why the 

xxx  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
Cisco certification carries such high respect in the marketplace. Cisco certifications dem-
onstrate to potential employers and contract holders a certain professionalism, expertise, 
and dedication required to complete a difficult goal. If Cisco certifications were easy to 
obtain, everyone would have them. 
Exam Registration
The CCNA Wireless IUWNE 640-722 exam is a computer-based exam, with around 
75 to 85 multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, list-in-order, and simulation-based questions. 
You can take the exam at any Pearson VUE (http://www.pearsonvue.com) testing center. 
According to Cisco, the exam should last about 90 minutes. Be aware that when you reg-
ister for the exam, you might be told to allow a certain amount of time to take the exam 
that is longer than the testing time indicated by the testing software when you begin. 
This discrepancy is because the testing center will want you to allow for some time to 
get settled and take the tutorial about the test engine.
Book Content Updates
Because Cisco occasionally updates exam topics without notice, Cisco Press might post 
additional preparatory content on the web page associated with this book at http://www.
ciscopress.com/title/9781587205620. It is a good idea to check the website a couple of 
weeks before taking your exam, to review any updated content that might be posted 
online. We also recommend that you periodically check back to this page on the Cisco 
Press website to view any errata or supporting book files that may be available.

 Wireless LANs must transmit a signal over radio frequencies (RF) to move data from one 
device to another. Transmitters and receivers can be fixed in consistent locations or they 
can be free to move around. This chapter covers the basic theory behind RF signals and 
the methods used to carry data wirelessly.  
 “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz 
 The “Do I Know This Already?” quiz allows you to assess whether you should read this 
entire chapter thoroughly or jump to the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section. If you are 
in doubt about your answers to these questions or your own assessment of your knowl-
edge of the topics, read the entire chapter.  Table  1-1 lists the major headings in this 
chapter and their corresponding “Do I Know This Already?” quiz questions. You can

 Caution  The goal of self-assessment is to gauge your mastery of the topics in this chap-
ter. If you do not know the answer to a question or are only partially sure of the answer, 
you should mark that question as wrong for purposes of the self-assessment. Giving your-
self credit for an answer you correctly guess skews your self-assessment results and might 
provide you with a false sense of security.

 Foundation Topics 
 Comparing Wired and Wireless Networks 
 In a wired network, any two devices that need to communicate with each other must be 
connected by a wire. (That was obvious!) The “wire” might contain strands of metal or 
fiber-optic material that run continuously from one end to the other. Data that passes 
over the wire is bounded by the physical properties of the wire. In fact, the IEEE 802.3 
set of standards defines strict guidelines for the Ethernet wire itself, in addition to how 
devices may connect, send, and receive data over the wire. 
 Wired connections have been engineered with tight constraints and have few variables 
that might prevent successful communication. Even the type and size of the wire strands, 
the number of twists the strands must make around each other over a distance, and the 
maximum length of the wire must adhere to the standard.  
 Therefore, a wired network is essentially a bounded medium; data must travel over what-
ever path the wire or cable takes between two devices. If the cable goes around a corner 
or lies in a coil, the electrical signals used to carry the data must also go around a corner 
or around a coil. Because only two devices may connect to a wire, only those two devic-
es may send or transmit data. Even better: The two devices may transmit data to each 
other simultaneously because they each have a private, direct path to each other. 
 Wired networks also have some shortcomings. When a device is connected by a wire, it 
cannot move around very easily or very far. Before a device can connect to a wired net-
work, it must have a connector that is compatible with the one on the end of the wire. 
As devices get smaller and more mobile, it just is not practical to connect them to a wire. 
 As its name implies, a wireless network removes the need to be tethered to a wire or 
cable. Convenience and mobility become paramount, enabling users to move around 
at will while staying connected to the network. A user can (and often does) bring along 
many different wireless devices that can all connect to the network easily and seamlessly.  
 Wireless data must travel through free space, without the constraints and protection of 
a wire. In the free space environment, many variables can affect the data and its delivery. 
To minimize the variables, wireless engineering efforts must focus on two things:  
  ■ 
  Wireless devices must adhere to a common standard.
  ■ 
  Wireless coverage must exist in the area where devices are expected.
 Wireless LANs are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is covered in more detail 
in  Chapter  2 , “RF Standards.” 

8  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Understanding Basic Wireless Theory 
 To send data across a wired link, an electrical signal is applied at one end and is carried 
to the other end. The wire itself is continuous and conductive, so the signal can propa-
gate rather easily. A wireless link has no physical strands of anything to carry the signal 
along. 
 How then can an electrical signal be sent across the air, or free space? Consider a simple 
analogy of two people standing far apart, and one person wants to signal something to 
other. They are connected by a long and somewhat-loose rope; the rope represents free 
space. The sender at one end decides to lift his end of the rope high and hold it there so 
that the other end of the rope will also raise and notify the partner. After all, if the rope 
were a wire, he knows that he could apply a steady voltage at one end of the wire and it 
would appear at the other end.  Figure   1-1 shows the end result; the rope falls back down 
after a tiny distance, and the receiver never notices a change. 
 
?
Sender
Receiver
 Figure 1-1  Failed Attempt to Pass a Message Down a Rope. 
 The sender tries a different strategy. He cannot push the rope, but when he begins to 
wave it up and down in a steady, regular motion, a curious thing happens. A continuous 
wave pattern appears along the entire length of the rope, as shown in  Figure  1-2 . In fact, 
the waves (each representing one up and down cycle of the sender’s arm) actually travel 
from the sender to the receiver.  
 Sender
Receiver
 Figure 1-2  Sending a Continuous Wave Down a Rope. 
 In free space, a similar principle occurs. The sender (a transmitter) can send an alternating 
current into a section of wire (an antenna), which sets up moving electric and magnetic 
fields that propagate out and away as traveling waves. The electric and magnetic fields 
travel along together and are always at right angles to each other, as shown in  Figure  1-3 . 
The signal must keep changing, or alternating, by cycling up and down, to keep the elec-
tric and magnetic fields cycling and pushing ever outward.  

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  9
Electric Field
Magnetic Field
 Figure 1-3  Traveling Electric and Magnetic Waves. 
 Electromagnetic waves do not travel in a straight line. Instead, they travel by expanding 
in  all  directions away from the antenna. To get a visual image, think of dropping a peb-
ble into a pond when the surface is still. Where it drops in, the pebble sets the water’s 
surface into a cyclic motion. The waves that result begin small and expand outward, only 
to be replaced by new waves. In free space, the electromagnetic waves expand outward 
in all three dimensions.  
 Figure   1-4    shows a simple idealistic antenna that is a single point at the end of a wire. 
The waves produced expand outward in a spherical shape. The waves will eventually 
reach the receiver, in addition to many other locations in other directions.  
 Tip  The idealistic antenna does not really exist, but serves as a reference point to 
understand wave propagation. In the real world, antennas can be made in various shapes 
and forms that can limit the direction that the waves are sent.  Chapter  4 , “Understanding 
Antennas,” covers antennas in more detail.  
Receiver
Sender
 Figure 1-4  Wave Propagation with an Idealistic Antenna. 
 At the receiving end of a wireless link, the process is reversed. As the electromagnetic 
waves reach the receiver’s antenna, they induce an electrical signal. If everything works 
right, the received signal will be a reasonable copy of the original transmitted signal. 

10  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Understanding Frequency 
 The waves involved in a wireless link can be measured and described in several ways. 
One fundamental property is the  frequency of the wave, or the number of times the 
signal makes one complete up and down  cycle in 1 second.  Figure  1-5 shows how a cycle 
of a wave can be identified. A cycle can begin as the signal rises from the center line, 
falls through the center line, and rises again to meet the center line. A cycle can also be 
measured from the center of one peak to the center of the next peak. No matter where 
you start measuring  a cycle, the signal must make a complete sequence back to its start-
ing position where it is ready to repeat the same cyclic pattern again.

 In  Figure   1-5   , suppose that 1 second has elapsed, as shown. During that 1 second, the 
signal progressed through four complete cycles. Therefore, its frequency is 4 cycles/sec-
ond or 4 hertz. A  hertz  (Hz) is the most commonly used frequency unit and is nothing 
other than one cycle per second.  
 Frequency can vary over a very wide range. As frequency increases by orders of mag-
nitude, the numbers can become quite large. To keep things simple, the frequency unit 
name can be modified to denote an increasing number of zeros, as listed in  Table  1-2 .

frequencies that are too low to be heard by the human ear, followed by audible sounds. 
The highest range of frequencies contains light, followed by X, gamma, and cosmic rays.

 Figure 1-6  Continuous Frequency Spectrum. 
 The frequency range from around 3 kHz to 300 GHz is commonly called  radio fre-
quency  (RF). It includes many different types of radio communication, including low-
frequency radio, AM radio, shortwave radio, television, FM radio, microwave, and radar. 
The microwave category also contains the two frequency ranges that are used for wire-
less LAN communication: 2.4 and 5 GHz. 
 Because a range of frequencies might be used for the same purpose, it is customary to 
refer to the range as a  band  of frequencies. For example, the range from 530 kHz to 
around 1710 kHz is used by AM radio stations; therefore it is commonly called the AM 
band or the AM broadcast band.  
 One of the two frequency ranges used for wireless LAN communication lies between 
2.400 and 2.4835 GHz. This is usually called the  2.4-GHz band , even though it does not 
encompass the entire range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz. It is much more convenient to 
refer to the band name instead of the specific range of frequencies included. 
 The other wireless LAN range is usually called the  5-GHz band because it lies between 
5.150 and 5.825 GHz. The 5-GHz band actually contains the following four separate and 
distinct bands:  
 5.150 to 5.250 GHz 
 5.250 to 5.350 GHz 

12  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 5.470 to 5.725 GHz 
 5.725 to 5.825 GHz 
 Tip  You might have noticed that most of the 5-GHz bands are contiguous except for 
a gap between 5.350 and 5.470. At the time of this writing, this gap exists and cannot be 
used for wireless LANs (although it might become a useful band at some point.) 
 It is interesting that the 5-GHz band can contain several smaller bands. Remember that 
the term  band  is simply a relative term that is used for convenience. At this point, do not 
worry about memorizing the band names or exact frequency ranges;  Chapter  2 covers 
this in more detail. 
 A frequency band contains a continuous range of frequencies. If two devices require 
a single frequency for a wireless link between them, which frequency can they use? 
Beyond that, how many unique frequencies can be used within a band? 
 To keep everything orderly and compatible, bands are usually divided up into a number 
of distinct  channels . Each channel is known by a channel number and is assigned to a 
specific frequency. As long as the channels are defined by a national or international 
standards body, they can be used consistently in all locations.  
 For example,  Figure   1-7    shows the channel assignment for the 2.4-GHz band that is used 
for wireless LAN communication. The band contains 14 channels numbered 1 through 
14, each assigned a specific frequency. First, notice how much easier it is to refer to 
channel numbers than the frequencies. Second, notice that the channels are spaced at 
regular intervals that are 0.005 GHz (or 5 MHz) apart. The channel spacing is known as 
the channel separation or channel width.

 If devices use a specific frequency for a wireless link, why do the channels need to be 
spaced apart at all? The reason lies with the practical limitations of RF signals, the elec-
tronics involved in transmitting and receiving the signals, and the overhead needed to 
add data to the signal effectively. 
 In practice, an RF signal is not infinitely narrow; instead, it spills above and below a cen-
ter frequency to some extent, occupying neighboring frequencies, too. It is the center 
frequency that defines the channel location within the band. The actual frequency range 
needed for the transmitted signal is known as the signal  bandwidth , as shown in  Figure 
 1-8 . As its name implies, bandwidth refers to the width of frequency space required 
within the band. For example, a signal with a 22-MHz bandwidth is bounded at 11 MHz 
above and below the center frequency. In wireless LANs, the signal bandwidth is defined 
as part of a standard. Even though the signal might extend farther above and below the 

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  13
center frequency than the bandwidth allows, wireless devices will use something called a 
spectral mask to ignore parts of the signal that fall outside the bandwidth boundaries.  
 Ideally, the signal bandwidth should be less than the channel width so that a different 
signal could be transmitted on every possible channel with no chance that two signals 
could overlap and interfere with each other.

Bandwidth
 Figure 1-8  Signal Bandwidth. 
 You should not assume that signals centered on the standardized channel assignments 
will not overlap with each other. The upper portion of  Figure  1-9 shows most of the 2.4-
GHz band, along with a signal bandwidth that is narrower than the channel spacing. A 
signal can exist on every possible channel without overlapping with others. The bottom 
portion of the figure shows the real world signal bandwidth, which is slightly wider than 
four channels! Signals centered on adjacent channels cannot possibly coexist without 
overlapping and interfering. Instead, the signals must be placed on more distant chan-
nels to prevent overlapping, thus limiting the number of channels that can be used in the 
band.

 Understanding Phase 
 RF signals are very dependent upon timing because they are always in motion. By their 
very nature, the signals are made up of electric and magnetic forces that vary over 
time. The  phase  of a signal is a measure of shift in time relative to the start of a cycle. 
Phase is normally measured in degrees, where 0 degrees is at the start of a cycle, and 
one complete cycle equals 360 degrees. A point that is halfway along the cycle is at the 
180-degree mark. Because an oscillating signal is cyclic, you can think of the phase trav-
eling around a  circle again and again.  
 When two identical signals are produced at exactly the same time, their cycles match 
up and they are said to be  in phase  with each other. If one signal is delayed from the 
other, the two signals are said to be  out of phase .  Figure  1-10 shows examples of both 
scenarios. 
Phase Shift
Out of Phase
In Phase
 Figure 1-10  Signals In and Out of Phase. 
 Phase becomes important as RF signals are received. Signals that are in phase tend to add 
together, whereas signals that are 180 degrees out of phase tend to cancel each other 
out.  Chapter   3   , “RF Signals in the Real World,” explores signal phase in greater detail. 
 Measuring Wavelength 
 RF signals are usually described by their frequency; however, it is difficult to get a feel 
for their physical size as they move through free space. The  wavelength is a measure of 
the physical distance that a wave travels over one complete cycle. Wavelength is usually 
designated by the Greek symbol lambda (λ). To get a feel for the dimensions of a wire-
less LAN signal, assuming you could see it as it travels in front of you, a 2.4-GHz signal 
would have a wavelength of 4.92 inches, while a 5-GHz signal would be 2.36 inches.  
 Figure   1-11 shows the wavelength of three different waves. The waves are arranged in 
order of increasing frequency, from top to bottom. Regardless of the frequency, RF 
waves travel at a constant speed. In a vacuum, radio waves travel at exactly the speed 
of light; in air, the velocity is slightly less than the speed of light. Notice that the wave-

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  15
length decreases as the frequency increases. As the wave cycles get smaller, they cover 
less distance. Wavelength becomes useful in the design and placement of antennas.

 Understanding RF Power and dB 
 For an RF signal to be transmitted, propagated through free space, received, and under-
stood with any certainty, it must be sent with enough strength or energy to make the 
journey. This strength can be measured as the  amplitude , or the height from the top 
peak to the bottom peak of the signal’s waveform, as shown in  Figure  1-12 . 
Amplitude
 Figure 1-12  Signal Amplitude. 
 The strength of an RF signal is usually measured by its power, in watts (W). For example, 
a typical AM radio station broadcasts at a power of 50,000 W; an FM radio station 
might use 16,000 W. In comparison, a wireless LAN transmitter usually has a signal 
strength between 0.1 W (100 mW) and 0.001 W (1 mW). 

16  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 When power is measured in watts or milliwatts, it is considered to be an absolute power 
measurement. In other words, something has to measure exactly how much energy is 
present in the RF signal. This is fairly straightforward when the measurement is taken at 
the output of a transmitter because the transmit power level is usually known ahead of 
time. 
 Sometimes you might need to compare the power level between two different transmit-
ters. For example, suppose that device T1 is transmitting at 1 mW, while T2 is transmit-
ting at 10 mW, as shown in  Figure   1-13   . Simple subtraction tells you that T2 is 9 mW 
stronger than T1. You might also notice that T2 is 10 times stronger than T1. 
T1
1 mW
T2
10 mW
T3
100 mW
T2 – T1 = 9 mW
T2/T1 = 10
T2 – T1 = 90 mW
T2/T1 = 10
 Figure 1-13  Comparing Power Levels Between Transmitters. 
 Now compare transmitters T2 and T3, which use 10 mW and 100 mW, respectively. 
Using subtraction, T2 and T3 differ by 90 mW, but T3 is again 10 times stronger than 
T2. In each instance, subtraction yields a different result than division. Which method 
should you use?  
 Quantities like absolute power values can differ by orders of magnitude. A more sur-
prising example is shown in  Figure   1-14   , where T4 is 0.00001 mW and T5 is 10 mW. 
Subtracting the two values gives their difference as 9.99999 mW. However, T5 is 
1,000,000 times stronger than T4!  
T4
0.00001 mW
T5
10 mW
T5 – T4 = 9.99999 mW
T5/T4 = 1,000,000
 Figure 1-14  Comparing Power Levels That Differ By Orders of Magnitude. 
 Because absolute power values can fall anywhere within a huge range, from a tiny deci-
mal number to hundreds, thousands, or greater values, we need a way to transform the 
exponential range into a linear one. The logarithm function can be leveraged to do just 
that. In a nutshell, a logarithm takes values that are orders of magnitude apart (0.001, 
0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000, for example) and spaces them evenly within a reasonable 
range. 

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  17
 Tip  The base-10 logarithm function, denoted by log 10 , computes how many times 10 
can be multiplied by itself to equal a number. For example, log 10 (10) equals 1 because 
10 multiplied by itself exactly once equals 10. The log 10 (100) equals 2 because 10 × 10, 
or 10 multiplied by itself twice, equals 100. Computing other log 10 values is difficult, 
requiring the use of a calculator. The good news is that you will not need a calculator or a 
logarithm on the CCNA Wireless exam. Even so, try to suffer through the few equations 
in this chapter so that you get a better understanding power comparisons and measure-
ments.  
 The  decibel  (dB) is a handy function that uses logarithms to compare one absolute mea-
surement to another. It was originally developed to compare sound intensity levels, but 
it applies directly to power levels, too. After each power value has been converted to the 
same logarithmic scale, the two values can be subtracted to find the difference. The fol-
lowing equation is used to calculate a dB value, where P1 and P2 are the absolute power 
levels of two sources: 
 dB = 10(log10P2 – log10P1)
 P2 represents the source of interest, and P1 is usually called the  reference value or the 
source of comparison. 
 The difference between the two logarithmic functions can be rewritten as a single loga-
rithm of P2 divided by P1, as follows:  
dB = 10 · log10
P2
P1
 Here, the  ratio  of the two absolute power values is computed first; then the result is 
converted onto a logarithmic scale.  
 Oddly enough, we end up with the same two methods to compare power levels with dB: 
a subtraction and a division. Thanks to the logarithm, both methods arrive at identical dB 
values. Be aware that the ratio or division form of the equation is the most commonly 
used in the wireless engineering world. 
 Important dB Facts to Remember 
 There are three cases where you can use mental math to make power-level comparisons 
using dB. You should memorize the following three facts; you will be tested on them 
in the CCNA Wireless exam. All other dB cases require a calculator, so you will not be 
tested on those:  
  ■ 
 Fact 1    —A value of 0 dB means that the two absolute power values are equal.
 If the two power values are equal, the ratio inside the logarithm is 1, and the log10(1) is 
0. This fact is intuitive; if two power levels are the same, one is 0 dB more than the
other.  
  ■ 
 Fact 2    —A value of 3 dB means that the power value of interest is double the refer-
ence value; a value of –3 dB means the power value of interest is half the reference.

 When P2 is twice P1, the ratio is always 2. Therefore, 10log 10 (2) = 3 dB. 
 When the ratio is 1/2, 10log 10 (1/2) = –3 dB. 
 The 3 dB fact is not very intuitive, but is still easy to learn. Whenever a power level dou-
bles, it increases by 3 dB. Whenever it is cut in half, it decreases by –3 dB. 
  ■ 
 Fact 3    —A value of 10 dB means that the power value of interest is 10 times the
reference value; a value of –10 dB means the power value of interest is 1/10 of the
reference.
 When P2 is 10 times P1, the ratio is always 10. Therefore, 10log 10 (10) = 10 dB. 
 When P2 is one tenth of P1, then the ratio is 1/10 and 10log 10 (1/10) = –10 dB. 
 The 10 dB fact is intuitive because multiplying or dividing by 10 adds or subtracts 10 dB, 
respectively.  
 Notice another handy rule of thumb: When absolute power values multiply, the dB value 
is positive and can be added. When the power values divide, the dB value is negative and 
can be subtracted.  Table   1-3    summarizes the useful dB comparisons.

 Try a few example problems to see whether you understand how to compare two power 
values using dB. In  Figure   1-15   , sources A, B, and C transmit at 4, 8, and 16 mW, respec-
tively. Source B is double the value of A, so it must be 3 dB greater than A. Likewise, 
source C is double the value of B, so it must be 3 dB greater than B.

In dB: B = A + 3 dB

In mW: C is 2 x B
In dB: C = B + 3 dB

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  19
 You can also compare sources A and C. To get from A to C, you have to double A, and 
then double it again. Each time you double a value, just add 3 dB. Therefore, C is 3 dB + 
3 dB = 6 dB greater than A.  
 Next, try the more complicated example shown in  Figure  1-16 . Keep in mind that dB 
values can be added and subtracted in succession (in case several multiplication and divi-
sion operations involving 2 and 10 are needed). 
D
5 mW
E
200 mW
In mW: E = D x 2 x 2 x 10
in dB: E = D + 3 + 3 + 10 dB
E = D + 16 dB
 Figure 1-16  An Example of Computing dB with Simple Rules. 
 Sources D and E have power levels 5 and 200 mW. Try to figure out a way to go from 5 
to 200 using only ×2 or ×10 operations. You can double 5 to get 10, then double 10 to 
get 20, and then multiply by 10 to reach 200 mW. Next, use the dB facts to replace the 
doubling and ×10 with the dB equivalents. The result is E = D + 3 + 3 + 10 or E = D + 16 
dB. 
 Comparing Power Against a Reference: dBm 
 Beyond comparing two transmitting sources, a wireless LAN engineer must be concerned 
about the RF signal propagating from a transmitter to a receiver. After all, transmitting a 
signal is meaningless unless someone is there to receive it and make use of it.  
 Figure   1-17 shows a simple scenario with a transmitter and a receiver. Nothing in the 
real world is ideal, so assume that something along the path of the signal will induce a 
net loss. At the receiver, the signal strength will be degraded by some amount. Suppose 
that you are able to measure the power level leaving the transmitter, which is 100 mW. 
At the receiver, you measure the power level of the arriving signal. It is an incredibly low 
0.000031623 mW.

20  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Wouldn’t it be nice to quantify the net loss over the signal’s path? After all, you might 
want to try several other transmit power levels or change something about the path 
between the transmitter and receiver. To design the signal path properly, you would like 
to make sure that the signal strength arriving at the receiver is at an optimum level. 
 You could leverage the handy dB formula to compare the received signal strength to the 
transmitted signal strength, as long as you can remember the formula and have a calcula-
tor nearby:  
dB = 10 · log10
= –65 dB
0.000031623 mW
100 mW
 The net loss over the signal path turns out to be a decrease of 65 dB. Knowing that, you 
decide to try a different transmit power level to see what would happen at the receiver. 
It does not seem very straightforward to use the new transmit power to find the new 
signal strength at the receiver. That might require more formulas and more time at the 
calculator. 
 A better approach is to compare each absolute power along the signal path to one com-
mon reference value. Then, regardless of the absolute power values, you could just focus 
on the changes to the power values that are occurring at various stages along the signal 
path. In other words, convert every power level to a dB value and simply add them up 
along the path.  
 Recall that the dB formula puts the power level of interest on the top of the ratio, with a 
reference power level on the bottom. In wireless networks, the reference power level is 
usually 1 mW, so the units are designated by  dBm (dB-milliwatt). 
 Returning to the scenario from  Figure   1-17 , the absolute power values at the transmitter 
and receiver can be converted to dBm, the results from which are shown in  Figure  1-18 . 
Notice that the dBm values can be added along the path: The transmitter dBm plus the 
net loss in dB equals the received signal in dBm.

 Measuring Power Changes Along the Signal Path 
 Up to this point, this chapter has considered a transmitter and its antenna to be a single 
unit. That might seem like a logical assumption because many wireless access points have 
built-in antennas. In reality, a transmitter, its antenna, and the cable that connects them 
are all discrete components that not only propagate an RF signal but also affect its abso-
lute power level.  

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  21
 When an antenna is connected to a transmitter, it provides some amount of gain to the 
resulting RF signal. This effectively increases the dB value of the signal above that of the 
transmitter alone.  Chapter   4    explains this in greater detail; for now, just be aware that 
antennas provide positive gain.  
 By itself, an antenna does not generate any amount of absolute power. In other words, 
when an antenna is disconnected, no milliwatts of power are being pushed out of it. That 
makes it impossible to measure the antenna’s gain in dBm. Instead, an antenna’s gain is 
measured by comparing its performance with that of a reference antenna, then comput-
ing a value in dB.  
 Usually, the reference antenna is an  isotropic antenna , so the gain is measured in  dBi 
(dB-isotropic). An isotropic antenna does not actually exist, because it is ideal in every 
way. Its size is a tiny point, and it radiates RF equally in every direction. No physical 
antenna can do that. The isotropic antenna’s performance can be calculated according to 
RF formulas, making it a universal reference for any antenna.  
 Because the physical qualities of the cable that connects an antenna to a transmitter, 
some signal loss always occurs. Cable vendors supply the loss in dB per foot or meter of 
cable length for each type of cable manufactured.   
 Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of 
cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will be radi-
ated from the antenna. This is known as the  effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), 
measured in dBm.  
 EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in 
most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum 
allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to 
the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss, as illustrated in  Figure   1-19   .

 Suppose a transmitter is configured for a power level of 10 dBm (10 mW). A cable with 
5-dB loss connects the transmitter to an antenna with an 8-dBi gain. The resulting EIRP 
of the system is 10 dBm – 5 dB + 8 dBi, or 13 dBm. 
 You might notice that the EIRP is made up of decibel-milliwatt (dBm), dB relative to an 
isotropic antenna (dBi), and decibel (dB) values. Even though the units appear to be dif-
Key 
Topic

22  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
ferent, you can safely combine them because they are all in the dB “domain.” The only 
exception to this is when an antenna’s gain is measured in  dBd (dB-dipole). In that case, a 
dipole antenna has been used as the reference antenna, rather than an isotropic antenna. 
A dipole is a simple actual antenna, which has a gain of 2.14 dBi. If an antenna has its 
gain shown as dBi, you  can add 2.14 dBi to that value to get its gain in dBi units instead. 
 Power-level considerations do not have to stop with the EIRP. You should also be con-
cerned with the complete path of a signal, to make sure that the transmitted signal has 
sufficient power so that it can effectively reach and be understood by a receiver. This is 
known as the  link budget. 
 The dB values of gains and losses can be combined over any number of stages along a 
signal’s path. Consider  Figure   1-20   , which shows every component of signal gain or loss 
along the path from transmitter to receiver.

 At the receiving end, an antenna provides gain to increase the received signal power 
level. A cable connecting the antenna to the receiver also introduces some loss. 
 Figure  1-21    shows some example dB values, as well as the resulting sum of the compo-
nent parts across the entire signal path. The signal begins at 20 dBm at the transmitter, 
has an EIRP value of 22 dBm at the transmitting antenna (20 dBm – 2 dB + 4 dBi), and 
arrives at the receiver with a level of –45 dBm.

 If you always begin with the transmitter power expressed in dBm, it is a simple matter to 
add or subtract the dB components along the signal path to find the signal strength that 
arrives at the receiver. 

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  23
 Understanding Power Levels at the Receiver 
 At the receiving end of the signal path, a receiver expects to find a signal on a predeter-
mined frequency, with enough power to contain useful data. Receivers measure a signal’s 
power in dBm according to the  received signal strength indicator (RSSI) scale. 
 When you work with wireless LAN devices, the EIRP levels leaving the transmitter’s 
antenna normally range from 100 mW down to 1 mW. This corresponds to the range 
+20 dBm down to 0 dBm. At the receiver, the power levels are much, much less, ranging 
from 1 mW all the way down to tiny fractions of a milliwatt, approaching 0 mW. The 
corresponding range of received signal levels is from 0 dBm down to –100 dBm or less. 
 Therefore, the RSSI of a received signal can range from 0 to –100, where 0 is the stron-
gest and –100 is the weakest. The range of RSSI values can vary between one hardware 
manufacturer and another. RSSI values are supposed to represent dBm values, but the 
results are not standardized across all receiver manufacturers. An RSSI value can vary 
from one receiver hardware to another. 
 Assuming a transmitter is sending an RF signal with enough power to reach a receiver, 
what RSSI value is good enough? Every receiver has a  sensitivity level or a threshold 
that divides intelligible, useful signals from unintelligible ones. As long as a signal is 
received with a power level that is greater than the sensitivity level, chances are that the 
data from the signal can be understood correctly.  Figure  1-22 shows an example of how 
the signal strength at a receiver might change over time. The receiver’s sensitivity level is 
–82 dBm.

 The RSSI value focuses on the expected signal alone, without regard to any other signals 
that may be received, too. All other signals that are received on the same frequency as 
the one you are trying to receive are simply viewed as  noise . The noise level, or the aver-
age signal strength of the noise, is called the  noise floor . 
 It is easy to ignore noise as long as the noise floor is well below what you are trying to 
hear. For example, two people can whisper in a library effectively because there is very 
little competing noise. Those same two people would become very frustrated if they 
tried to whisper to each other in a crowded sports arena.

 Receiving an RF signal is no different; its signal strength must be greater than the noise 
floor by a decent amount so that it can be received and understood correctly. The dif-
ference between the signal and the noise is called the  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mea-
sured in dB .  A higher SNR value is preferred. 
 Figure  1-23    shows the RSSI of a signal compared with the noise floor that is received. 
The RSSI averages around –54 dBm. On the left side of the graph, the noise floor is –90 
dBm. The resulting SNR is –54 dBm – (–90) dBm or 36 dB. Toward the right side of the 
graph, the noise floor gradually increases to –65 dBm, reducing the SNR to 11 dB. The 
signal is so close to the noise that it probably will not be usable.

 Carrying Data Over an RF Signal 
 Up to this point in the chapter, only the RF characteristics of wireless signals have been 
discussed. The RF signals presented have existed only as simple oscillations in the form 
of a sine wave. The frequency, amplitude, and phase have all been constant. The steady, 
predictable frequency is important because a receiver needs to tune to a known frequen-
cy to find the signal in the first place.  
 This basic RF signal is called a  carrier signal because it is used to carry other useful 
information. With AM and FM radio signals, the carrier signal also transports audio sig-
nals. TV carrier signals have to carry both audio and video. Wireless LAN carrier signals 
must carry data.  
 To add data onto the RF signal, the frequency of the original carrier signal must be pre-
served. Therefore, there must be some scheme of altering some characteristic of the car-
rier signal to distinguish a 0 bit from a 1 bit. Whatever scheme is used by the transmitter 
must also be used by the receiver so that the data bits can be correctly interpreted.  
  Figure   1-24    shows a carrier signal with a constant frequency. The data bits 1001 are to be 
sent over the carrier signal, but how? One idea might be to simply use the value of each 
data bit to turn the carrier signal off or on. The Bad Idea 1 plot shows the resulting RF 
signal. A receiver might be able to notice when the signal is present and has an amplitude 
and correctly interpret 1 bits, but there is no signal to receive during 0 bits. If the signal 

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  25
becomes weak or is not available for some reason, the receiver will  incorrectly think that 
a long string of 0 bits have been transmitted. A different twist might be to transmit only 
the upper half of the carrier signal during a 1 bit and the lower half during a 0 bit, as 
shown in the Bad Idea 2 plot. This time, a portion of the signal is always available for the 
receiver, but the signal becomes impractical to receive because important pieces of each 
cycle are missing. In addition, it is very difficult to transmit RF with disjointed alternat-
ing cycles.

 Such naive approaches might not be successful, but they do have the right idea: to alter 
the carrier signal in a way that indicates the information to be carried. This is known as 
 modulation , where the carrier signal is modulated or changed according to some other 
source. At the receiver, the process is reversed;  demodulation interprets the added infor-
mation based on changes in the carrier signal. 
 RF modulation schemes generally have the following goals: 
  ■ 
  Carry data at a predefined rate
  ■ 
  Be reasonably immune to interference and noise
  ■ 
  Be practical to transmit and receive
 Due to the physical properties of an RF signal, a modulation scheme can alter only the 
following attributes:  
  ■ 
  Frequency, but only by varying slightly above or below the carrier frequency
  ■ 
 Phase 
  ■ 
 Amplitude 

26  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 The modulation techniques require some amount of bandwidth centered on the carrier 
frequency. This additional bandwidth is partly due to the rate of the data being carried 
and partly due to the overhead from encoding the data and manipulating the carrier 
signal. If the data has a relatively low bit rate, such as an audio signal carried over AM 
or FM radio, the modulation can be straightforward and requires little extra bandwidth. 
Such signals are called  narrowband transmissions. 
 In contrast, wireless LANs must carry data at high bit rates, requiring more bandwidth 
for modulation. The end result is that the data being sent is spread out across a range 
of frequencies. This is known as  spread spectrum . At the physical layer, wireless LANs 
can be broken down into the following three spread-spectrum categories, which are dis-
cussed in subsequent sections:  
  ■ 
 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
  ■ 
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
  ■ 
 Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) 
 FHSS 
 Early wireless LAN technology took a novel approach as a compromise between avoid-
ing RF interference and needing complex modulation. The wireless band was divided 
into 79 channels or fewer, with each channel being 1 MHz wide. To avoid narrowband 
interference, where an interfering signal would affect only a few channels at a time, 
transmissions would need to continuously “hop” between frequencies all across the 
band. This is known as  frequency-hopping spread spectrum . 
 Figure  1-25    shows an example of how the FHSS technique works, where the sequence 
begins on channel 2, then moves to channels 25, 64, 10, 45, and so on, through an entire 
predetermined sequence before repeating again. Hopping between channels has to occur 
at regular intervals so that the transmitter and receiver can stay synchronized. In addi-
tion, the hopping order must be worked out in advance so that the receiver can always 
tune to the correct frequency in use at any given time.

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  27
 Whatever advantage FHSS gained avoiding interference was lost because of the follow-
ing limitations:  
  ■ 
  Narrow 1-MHz channel bandwidth, limiting the data rate to 1 or 2 Mbps.
  ■ 
  Multiple transmitters in an area could eventually collide and interfere with each
other on the same channels. 
 As a result, FHSS fell out of favor and was replaced by another, more robust and scal-
able spread-spectrum approach: DSSS. Even though FHSS is rarely used now, you should 
be familiar with it and its place in the evolution of wireless LAN technologies.  
 DSSS 
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum uses a small number of fixed, wide channels that can 
support complex modulation schemes and somewhat scalable data rates. Each channel 
is 22 MHz wide—a much wider bandwidth compared with the maximum supported 
11-Mbps data rate, but wide enough to augment the data by spreading it out and mak-
ing it more resilient to disruption. In the 2.4-GHz band where DSSS is used, there are 14 
possible channels, but only 3 of them that do not overlap.  Figure  1-26 shows how chan-
nels 1, 6, and 11 are normally used.

 DSSS transmits data in a serial stream, where each data bit is prepared for transmission 
one at a time. It might seem like a simple matter to transmit the data bits in the order 
that they are stored or presented to the wireless transmitter; however, RF signals are 
often affected by external factors like noise or interference that can garble the data at 
the receiver. For that reason, a wireless transmitter performs several functions to make 
the data stream less susceptible to being degraded along the transmission path:  
  ■ 
 Scrambler    —The data waiting to be sent is first scrambled in a predetermined man-
ner so that it becomes a randomized string of 0 and 1 bits rather than long sequenc-
es of 0 or 1 bits.
  ■ 
 Coder    —Each data bit is converted into multiple bits of information that contain
carefully crafted patterns that can be used to protect against errors due to noise or
interference. Each of the new coded bits is called a  chip . The complete group of
chips representing a data bit is called a  symbol . DSSS uses two encoding techniques:
Barker codes and Complementary Code Keying (CCK).
  ■ 
 Interleaver    —The coded data stream of symbols is spread out into separate blocks
so that bursts of interference might affect one block, but not many.

28  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
  ■ 
 Modulator    —The bits contained in each symbol are used to alter or modulate the
phase of the carrier signal. This enables the RF signal to carry the binary data bit
values. 
  Figure  1-27    shows the entire data preparation process. At the receiver, the entire process 
is reversed. The DSSS techniques discussed in this chapter focus only on the coder and 
modulator functions.

 DSSS has evolved over time to increase the data rate that is modulated onto the RF sig-
nal. This section describes each DSSS method and data rate, in progression. Regardless of 
the data rate, DSSS always uses a chipping rate of 11 million chips per second.  
 1-Mbps Data Rate 
 To minimize the effect of a low SNR and data loss in cases of narrowband interference, 
each bit of data is encoded as a sequence of 11 bits called a  Barker 11 code . The goal 
is to add enough additional information to each bit of data that its integrity will be pre-
served when it is sent in a noisy environment. 
 It might seem ridiculous to turn 1 bit into 11 bits. As an analogy, voice transmissions 
over an RF signal can be subject to noise and interference, too. Spelling words letter by 
letter can help, but even single letters can become garbled and ambiguous. For example, 
the letters  B ,  C ,  D ,  E, G ,  P ,  T ,  V , and  Z  can all sound similar when noise is present. 
Phonetic alphabets have been developed to remove the ambiguity. Instead of saying the 
letter  B , the word  Bravo  is spoken;  C  becomes  Charlie ,  D becomes  Delta , and so on. 
Replacing single letters with longer, unique words makes the listener’s job much easier 
and more accurate.  
 There are only two possible values for the Barker chips—one corresponding to a 0 
data bit (10110111000) and one for a 1 data bit (01001000111). The receiver must also 
expect the Barker chips and convert them back into single bits of data. The number and 
sequence of the Barker chip bits have been defined to allow data bits to be recovered if 
some of the chip bits are lost. In fact, up to 9 of the 11 bits in a single chip can be lost 
before the original data bit cannot be restored.  
 Each bit in a Barker chip can be transmitted by using the  differential binary phase shift 
keying (DBPSK) modulation scheme. The phase of the carrier signal is shifted or rotated 
according to the data bit being transmitted, as follows:  

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  29
 0:  The phase is not changed. 
 1:     The phase is “rotated” or shifted 180 degrees, such that the signal is suddenly 
inverted.  
 DBPSK can modulate 1 bit of data at a time onto the RF signal. With a steady chipping 
rate of 11 million chips per second, where each symbol (1 original bit) contains 11 chips, 
the transmitted data rate is 1 Mbps.   
 2-Mbps Data Rate 
 It is possible to couple the 1-Mbps strategy with a different modulation scheme to 
double the data rate. As before, each data bit is coded into an 11-bit Barker code with 
an 11-MHz chipping rate. This time, chips are taken two at a time and modulated onto 
the carrier signal by using  differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK). The 
two chips are used to affect the carrier signal’s phase in four possible ways, each one 
90 degrees apart (hence, the name quadrature). The bit patterns produce the following 
phase shifts: 
  ■ 
 00:  The phase is not changed. 
  ■ 
 01:  Rotate the phase 90 degrees. 
  ■ 
 11:  Rotate the phase 180 degrees. 
  ■ 
 10:  Rotate the phase 270 degrees. 
 Because DQPSK can modulate data bits in pairs, it is able to transmit twice the data rate 
of DBPSK, or 2 Mbps.  
 Figure   1-28    shows examples of DBPSK and DQPSK modulation. Each input data bit 
combination is shown along with the carrier signal phase rotation that occurs. Phase 
rotations can occur at several points along a cycle; for simplicity, only rotations at the 
beginning of the cycle (0 degrees) are shown. Notice how abrupt the phase can change, 
according to the bits being modulated. The receiver must detect these phase changes 
when it demodulates the signal so that the original data bits can be recovered.  
 Tip  As you read about wireless modulation techniques, you will often see DBPSK and 
BPSK mentioned. The two forms reference the same type of modulation (BPSK, in this 
case), but differ in the reference signal that the receiver uses to detect the phase changes. 
The nondifferential form (without the initial  D ) means the receiver must compare with 
the original premodulated signal to find phase changes. The differential form (with the 
 D ) means the receiver must figure out phase changes by comparing with previous phases 
already seen in received signal.

 5.5-Mbps Data Rate 
 To gain more efficiency,  Complementary Code Keying (CCK) can replace the Barker 
code. CCK can take 4 bits of data at a time and build out redundant information to cre-
ate a unique 6-chip symbol. Two more bits are added to indicate the modulated phase 
orientation for the symbol, resulting in 8 chips total. CCK is naturally coupled with 
DQPSK modulation; the two-phase orientation bits determine four possible carrier signal 
phase rotation values. 
 The chipping rate remains steady at 11 MHz, but each symbol contains 8 chips. This 
results in a symbol rate of 1.375 MHz. Each symbol is based on 4 original data bits, so 
the effective data rate is 5.5 Mbps.   
 11-Mbps Data Rate 
 The 5.5-Mbps CCK data rate can be doubled by making an adjustment to the coder. 
Instead of taking 4 data bits at a time to make each coder symbol, data can be taken 8 
bits at a time to create a unique 8-chip symbol. The CCK symbol rate is still 1.375 MHz, 
so 8 data bits per symbol results in a data rate of 11 Mbps. 
 The smaller 8-chip CCK symbol is more efficient than the 11-bit Barker code because 
more data bits can be sent with each new symbol. At the same time, CCK loses some 
of the extra bits used by the Barker code to recover information received in a noisy or 
low SNR environment. In other words, CCK achieves faster data rates at the expense of 
requiring a stronger, less-noisy signal.    

Chapter 1: RF Signals and Modulation  31
 OFDM 
 DSSS spreads the chips of a single data stream into one wide 22 MHz channel. It is 
inherently limited to an 11 Mbps data rate because of the consistent 11-MHz chipping 
rate that feeds into the RF modulation. To scale beyond that limit, a vastly different 
approach is needed.  
 In contrast, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) sends data bits in  par-
allel over multiple frequencies, all contained in a single 20 MHz channel. Each channel is 
divided into 64 subcarriers (also called subchannels or tones) that are spaced 312.5 kHz 
apart. The subcarriers are broken down into the following types: 
  ■ 
 Guard    —12 subcarriers are used to help set one channel apart from another.
  ■ 
 Pilot    —4 subcarriers are equally spaced to help receivers lock onto the channel.
  ■ 
 Data —48 subcarriers are devoted to carrying data. 
 Tip  Sometimes you might see OFDM described as having 52 subcarriers (48 for data 
and 4 for pilot). This is because the 12 guard frequencies are not actually transmitted, but 
stay silent as channel spacing.   
 Figure   1-29    shows an example of OFDM, where channel 6 in the 2.4-GHz band is 20 
MHz wide with 48 data subcarriers. OFDM is named for the way it takes one channel 
and divides it into a set of distinct frequencies for its subcarriers. Notice that the subcar-
riers appear to be spaced too close together, causing them to overlap. In fact, that is the 
case, but instead of interfering with each other, the overlapped portions are aligned so 
that they cancel most of the potential interference.

32  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 OFDM has the usual scrambling, coding, interleaving, and modulating functions, but it 
gains its scalability by leveraging so many data subcarriers in parallel. Even though the 
data rates through each subcarrier are relatively low, the sum of all subcarriers results in 
a high aggregate data rate.  
 OFDM offers many different data rates through several different modulation schemes. 
Because OFDM is concerned with moving data in parallel at higher rates, the amount of 
information that is repeated for resilience can be varied. The coders used with OFDM 
are named according to the fraction of symbols that are new or unique, and not repeat-
ed. For example, BPSK 1/2 designates that one half of the bits are new and one half are 
repeated. BPSK 3/4 uses a coder that presents three-fourths new data and repeats only 
one fourth. As a rule of thumb, a greater fraction means a greater data rate, but a lower 
tolerance for errors.  
 At the low end of the range, the familiar BPSK modulation can be used along with two 
different coder ratios. In this case, OFDM still uses 48 subchannels or tones, with a 
reduced tone rate of 250 Kbps. OFDM with BPSK 1/2 results in a 6-Mbps data rate, 
whereas BPSK 3/4 gives 9 Mbps. QPSK 1/2 and 3/4 can be used to increase the data rate 
to 12 and 18 Mbps, respectively.  
 Recall that QPSK uses 2 data bits to modulate the RF signal, resulting in four possible 
phase shifts. To achieve data rates greater than 18 Mbps, more bits must be used to 
modulate the signal. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) combines QPSK phase 
shifting ( quadrature ) with multiple amplitude levels to get a greater number of unique 
alterations to the signal. For example, 16-QAM uses 2 bits to select the QPSK phase 
rotation and 2 bits to select the amplitude level, giving 4 bits or 16 unique modulation 
changes.  Figure  1-30 illustrates a 16-QAM operation.

 The number of possible outcomes is always given as a prefix to the QAM name, fol-
lowed by the coder ratio of new data. In other words, 16-QAM is available in 1/2 and 
3/4, providing data rates of 24 and 36 Mbps, respectively. Beyond that, 64-QAM 2/3 
and 64-QAM 3/4 offer 48 and 54 Mbps, respectively.

 To pass data over an RF signal successfully, both a transmitter and receiver have to use 
the same modulation method. In addition, the pair should use the best data rate possible, 
given their current environment. If they are located in a noisy environment, where a low 
SNR or a low RSSI might result, a lower data rate might be preferable. If not, a higher 
data rate is better. 
 With so many possible modulation methods available, how do the transmitter and 
receiver select a common method? To complicate things, the transmitter, the receiver,

or both might be mobile. As they move around, the SNR and RSSI conditions will likely 
change. The most effective approach is to have the transmitter and receiver negotiate a 
modulation method (and the resulting data rate) dynamically, based on current RF condi-
tions. 
 Chapter  2    explains the industry standards that are used in wireless LANs and how they 
influence the modulation techniques that are used.

 To communicate successfully, wireless devices must first find each other in the radio fre-
quency (RF) spectrum and then use compatible methods to generate RF signals, modu-
late and encode data, negotiate communication parameters and features, and so on—all 
without interfering with the operation of other wireless devices. This chapter covers the 
agencies that regulate, standardize, and validate the correct use of wireless LAN devices.

Chapter 2: RF Standards  41
 Foundation Topics 
 Regulatory Bodies 
 The RF portion of the frequency spectrum ranges from about 3 kHz to 300 GHz. 
Frequencies within the RF spectrum are available because they exist everywhere, but it 
would not be wise to use any frequency at will. For example, suppose someone decides 
to set up a radio transmitter to broadcast a signal on 123.45 MHz. Unless other people 
know about the transmitter’s frequency and have radio receivers that can tune to that 
frequency, no one will be able to receive the signal. Even further, a frequency might be 
used by one entity for a specific purpose, while another entity might try to use the same 
frequency for a different purpose. To keep the RF spectrum organized and open for fair 
use, regulatory bodies were formed.  
 ITU-R 
 A telecommunications regulatory body regulates or decides which part of the RF spec-
trum can be used for a particular purpose, in addition to how it can be used. A country 
might have its own regulatory body that controls RF spectrum use within its borders, but 
RF signals can be more far-reaching than that. For example, one purpose for shortwave 
radio stations is to broadcast from one country around the earth to reach other coun-
tries. In a similar manner, one radio manufacturer might sell its equipment internation-
ally, where a transmitter or receiver might be used in any global location. 
 To provide a hierarchy to manage the RF spectrum globally, the United Nations set up 
the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R;  http://
www.itu.int ). The ITU-R maintains spectrum and frequency assignments in three distinct 
regions: 
  ■ 
 Region 1:  Europe, Africa, and Northern Asia 
  ■ 
 Region 2:  North and South America 
  ■ 
 Region 3:  Southern Asia and Australasia 
 While the ITU-R strives to make the RF spectrum usable by all countries, it also tries 
to make sure that the RF signals from one country do not interfere with the signals of 
another country. The ITU-R even keeps track of geostationary satellite orbits and fre-
quencies so that signals for one country’s satellites do not harmfully interfere with those 
of another country.  
 Most bands in the RF spectrum are tightly regulated, requiring you to apply for a license 
from a regulatory body before using a specific frequency. Licensed bands might seem 
restrictive, for a good reason: “Harmful” or disruptive interference is kept to a minimum 
because frequencies are reserved for approved transmitters, purposes, and locations. To 
use a frequency in a licensed band, someone has to submit an application to a regulatory 

42  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
body that governs frequency use in a given country, wait for approval, and then abide by 
any restrictions that are imposed.   
 In contrast, the ITU-R allocated the following two frequency ranges specifically for 
industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) applications. Although there are other ISM 
bands, too, these are the only two that apply to wireless LANs:  
 2.400 to 2.500 GHz 
 5.725 to 5.825 GHz 
 The purposes for these bands are broad and access is open to anyone who wants to use 
them. In other words, the ISM bands are unlicensed and no registration or approval is 
needed to transmit on one of the frequencies.  
 While unlicensed bands are more accessible and convenient to use, they are much more 
vulnerable to interference and misuse. For example, suppose that you decide to set up a 
transmitter in your office to use one frequency. The next day, someone in a neighboring 
office sets up his own transmitter to broadcast on the same or an overlapping frequency. 
Because the band is unlicensed, you can do little to relieve the interference other than 
move your transmitter to a different frequency or use diplomacy to convince your 
neighbor to move his transmitter instead.  
 Fortunately, all the frequency bands used for wireless LANs are unlicensed. You can 
purchase a wireless LAN device and begin to use it immediately—provided you abide by 
the rules set up by the regulatory agency that governs RF use in your country. Usually, 
unlicensed transmitters must stay within an approved frequency range and transmit with-
in an approved maximum power level. Several national regulatory agencies are discussed 
in the following sections. 
 FCC 
 In the United States and several other countries in the Americas, the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC;  http://www.fcc.gov ) regulates RF frequencies, chan-
nels, and transmission power. In addition to the 2.4–2.5-GHz ISM band allocated by the 
ITU-R, the FCC has allocated the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) 
frequency space in the 5-GHz band for wireless LAN use. U-NII is actually four separate 
sub-bands, as follows:  
 U-NII-1 (Band 1):  5.15 to 5.25 GHz  
 U-NII-2 (Band 2):  5.25 to 5.35 GHz  
 U-NII-2 Extended (Band 3):  5.47 to 5.725 GHz  
 U-NII-3 (Band 4):  5.725 to 5.825 GHz (also allocated as ISM)  
 Tip  As you read and work with the 5-GHz bands, be aware that you may see various 
forms of the band names. For example, the 5.15- to 5.25-GHz band is often referenced 
by names like U-NII-1, UNII-1, U-NII Low, and so on.

 All transmitting equipment must be approved by the FCC before it can be sold to users. 
For the 2.4- and 5-GHz unlicensed bands, the FCC requires strict limits on the effective 
isotropic radiated power (EIRP). Recall from  Chapter  1 , “RF Signals and Modulation,” 
that the EIRP is the net power level that is being transmitted from an antenna that is con-
nected to a transmitter.  
 You must be aware of the EIRP limits and make sure that your wireless LAN equipment 
does not exceed the limits. If the FCC has to approve wireless transmitters, it might 
seem logical that the maximum EIRP of the equipment would have to be approved, too. 
Why would you, as a wireless user, have to worry about staying within the limits? Some 
transmitters are sold without antennas, so you are free to buy and install your own. 
Without considering the EIRP limit, you might choose an antenna that has too much 
gain, which would raise the EIRP too high.  
 In an effort to prevent users from exceeding the EIRP limits, the FCC requires all remov-
able antennas to have a unique, nonstandard connector, based on the transmitter manu-
facturer. The original idea was to require both transmitter and antenna to be purchased 
from the same manufacturer, preventing the end user from mixing and matching parts 
from different vendors. 
 Cisco uses a variant of the threaded Neill-Concelman (TNC) connector on its equipment. 
The reverse polarity TNC (RP-TNC) connector is identical to the TNC, but has key male 
and female parts reversed so that antennas with TNC connectors cannot be connected. 
 Figure   2-1    shows the male version of the regular TNC and RP-TNC connector side by 
side. 
 Figure 2-1  A Comparison Between TNC (left) and Cisco RP-TNC Connector (right). 
 In practice, you can find all sorts of antennas from a wide variety of manufacturers that 
all have RP-TNC connectors. In other words, you cannot depend on the FCC and the 

44  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
RP-TNC connector to limit the EIRP of your wireless equipment; you have to do that 
yourself. 
 Transmitters in the 2.4-GHz band can be used indoors or outdoors. The power emit-
ted at the transmitter must be limited to 30 dBm and the EIRP limited to 36 dBm. An 
antenna gain of +6 dBi is assumed. However, there is some flexibility according to the 
following two rules, based on the intended spread of the signal: 
  ■ 
 Point-to-multipoint links    —Where the transmitted signal propagates in all direc-
tions, you can make adjustments according to a  1:1  rule. For each dBm you remove
from the transmitter, one dBi can be added to the antenna gain, as long as the EIRP
is no greater than 36 dBm. 
  ■ 
 Point-to-point links    —Where the transmitted signal propagates in one general direc-
tion, you can make adjustments according to a  3:1  rule. For each dBm you remove
from the transmitter, 3 dBi can be added to the antenna gain. The resulting EIRP can
exceed 36 dBm, but cannot be greater than 56 dBm.
 Transmitters in the 5-GHz bands must follow the FCC limits listed in  Table  2-2 . In each 
of the U-NII bands, you can make power adjustments according to the 1:1 rule. Notice 
that the U-NII-1 band is the only one restricted to indoor use.

 Normally, transmitters operating in any of the 2.4- and 5-GHz unlicensed bands must 
endure any interference caused by other transmitters. The FCC requires one exception 
in the U-NII-2 and U-NII-2 Extended bands: When a signal from an approved device, 
such as a military or weather radar, is detected on a frequency, all other transmitters 
must move out of the way to a different frequency. This is known as  dynamic frequency 
selection  (DFS). 
 ETSI 
 In Europe and several other countries, the European Telecommunication Standards 
Institute (ETSI;  http://www.etsi.org ) regulates radio transmitter use. Like the FCC, the 
ETSI allows wireless LANs to be used in the 2.4-GHz ISM and most of the same 5-GHz 
U-NII bands; however, the U-NII-3 band is a licensed band and cannot be used.

 Table   2-3    lists the transmitter requirements for each of the bands. The ETSI allows 
adjustments to the transmit power and antenna gain, as long as the maximum EIRP is not 
exceeded.

 The ETSI regulations also include DFS, which requires wireless LAN transmitters to 
move to a random frequency after a radar signal is detected. 
 Other Regulatory Bodies 
 Wireless LAN equipment use is regulated outside the Americas and Europe, too. Does 
each country have its own set of regulations? Not necessarily; a country might have its 
own or it can adhere to all or parts of the regulations of a larger, more established regu-
latory body. Countries that use a common set of RF regulations are known as a regula-
tory domain. 
 For example, a Cisco wireless device that is compatible with the American regulatory 
domain can also be used in Canada, many Latin and South American countries, and in 
the Philippines. 
 Cisco manufactures wireless devices for use in at least 13 different regulatory domains. 
The basic wireless LAN operation is identical in all domains, but the frequency ranges, 
channels, and maximum transmit powers can differ. 
 IEEE Standards Body 
 To pass data over a wireless link, many parameters have to be defined and standardized. 
Wireless LANs rarely involve just one transmitter and receiver; normally, many devices 
must contend for use of airtime on a frequency. The Institute of Electric and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE;  http://ieee.org ) maintains the industry standards that are used for wire-
less LANs, among many others.  
 The IEEE is a professional organization made up of engineers from around the world. 
It is organized as a collection of “societies” that are focused on particular engineering 
areas. For example, the IEEE Computer Society develops and maintains standards on a 
variety of topics related to computing, including Ethernet and wireless LANs. 

46  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 The IEEE 802 standards all deal with local-area networks and metropolitan-area net-
works (LANs and MANs, respectively). The standards mainly deal with the physical and 
data link layers of the OSI model, and with transporting variable-size data packets across 
a network media. As you explore the portion of the 802 standards that are dedicated to 
wireless LANs, you will find that they focus on accessing the shared RF media (physical 
layer or Layer 1) and on sending and receiving data frames (data link layer or Layer 2).  
 Tip  What is the significance of the number 802? The Local Network Standards 
Committee of the IEEE Computer Society first met in February 1980, to begin work on 
“Project 802,” the first LAN standard. The number 802 was the next sequential project 
number, but also fit the odd coincidence of the date—year 80, second month.  
 To develop networking standards, the IEEE is organized into working groups, which 
have an open membership. Each working group is assigned an index number that is 
appended to the 802 standards family number. For example, 802.1 refers to the first 
working group, which developed standards for network bridging.  Table  2-4 lists a 
few familiar 802 working groups. Notice that the eleventh working group, 802.11, is 
responsible for the wireless LAN standards that are used by Cisco, many other wireless 
vendors, and users like yourself. For the remainder of this chapter, the focus will be on 
802.11.

 As a new improvement is needed or the technology advances, a study group (SG) 
researches the topic to see whether an amendment to the 802.11 standard is needed. 
Each time a new amendment is necessary, a new task group (TG) is formed to collaborate 
and develop it. Task groups are assigned a suffix letter in alphabetic order. For example, 
as amendments are introduced, their names become 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11c, and so 
on. If there are enough amendments to reach letter  z , any subsequent amendments are 

Chapter 2: RF Standards  47
given a two-letter suffix, beginning with the letter  a followed by letters  a through  z . At 
the time of this writing, the 802.11 working group had assigned amendments 802.11aa 
through 802.11aq.  
 Once a draft amendment is completed, it must be voted on and ratified. At that point, 
manufacturers can then begin to build products that operate according to all or a part of 
the standard. For example, when the 802.11n amendment was finalized and published, 
the new features of 802.11n were then added to many wireless LAN devices.  
 Sometimes an amendment takes a very long time to get through the development, vot-
ing, and final approval processes, so many manufacturers will decide to move ahead and 
implement the draft amendment into their products early. Usually a manufacturer has to 
decide if the draft amendment is stable enough to implement into device hardware or 
whether it is likely to receive drastic changes before it is ratified. This scenario occurred 
with the 802.11n amendment. Many manufacturers offered early implementations as 
“Draft N-compliant” products, which may or may not have been compatible with similar 
products from other manufacturers.  
 The 802.11 standards usually have the year they were ratified added to their names. For 
example, the original 802.11 standard was issued in 1997, so it is now known as 802.11-
1997. Likewise, the name 802.11a-1999 means that the 802.11a amendment was ratified 
in 1999. 
 Periodically, the IEEE 802 working group chooses to revise the 802.11 standard as a 
whole. When this occurs, every amendment that has been ratified since the last 802.11 
revision is “rolled up” and absorbed into the new updated standard. The idea is to main-
tain one document that defines the entire standard, as of a certain date, so that wireless 
developers can find all of the technical details in one place.  
 Even though the amendments become part of the larger standard, their names are still 
commonly used to reference the specific functions they introduced. Since its introduc-
tion in 1997, the 802.11 standard has been revised in 1999, 2007, and 2012. The current 
802.11-2012 standard is over 2700 pages long. 
 802.11 Channel Use 
 Chapter   1    introduced RF frequency, bands, and channels in a generic fashion. Wireless 
devices built around the 802.11 standard must also have a standardized concept of the 
same RF parameters. As wireless devices move around, they should be able to detect and 
participate in wireless LANs as they become available, regardless of geographic location. 
 The following sections describe the 802.11 channel definitions in the 2.4- and 5-GHz 
bands. 
 Channels in the 2.4-GHz ISM Band 
 In the 2.4-GHz ISM band, the frequency space is divided up into 14 channels, numbered 
1 through 14. With the exception of channel 14, the channels are spaced 5 MHz apart, 
as listed in  Table  2-5 .

 The 802.11 standard allows either direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or 
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and coding schemes to 
be used in the 2.4-GHz band. DSSS radios require each channel to be 22 MHz wide, and 
OFDM requires 20 MHz. Either way, with only 5 MHz between channels, transmissions 
on neighboring channels are bound to overlap and interfere with each other. (This condi-
tion is covered in  Chapter   3 , “RF Signals in the Real World.”)  
 Even though the band is made up of 14 channels, not all of them may be used in all 
countries. For example, the FCC limits the band to channels 1 through 11 only. The 
ETSI permits channels 1 through 13. Japan permits all 14 channels to be used, but chan-
nel 14 has some restrictions. 
 Figure  2-2    shows how 802.11 signals can overlap on neighboring 2.4-GHz channels. The 
only way to prevent transmitters on nearby channels from interfering with each other is 
to keep them on channels that are spaced farther apart. The most common arrangement 
is to use only channels 1, 6, and 11, which do not overlap with each other at all.  
 Tip  One scheme uses channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 to gain an extra channel, but it is not 
commonly used. With DSSS, the channels end up overlapping, which violates the 802.11 
definition for adjacent channels and also raises the noise floor. Only the OFDM 20-MHz-
wide channels can avoid overlapping each other. Channel 13 presents an interesting case 
because it is not supported on all wireless clients in all areas of the world.

 Why should you be concerned about non-overlapping channels? After all, having three 
non-overlapping channels might seem like plenty. Problems can arise when you need to 
set up several wireless LAN transmitters in the same general area. You could set the first 
three transmitters to each use a different channel, but the fourth or fifth ones would 
have to reuse one of the three non-overlapping channels. 
 Reusing channels becomes a puzzle that you have to solve when you administer a grow-
ing wireless LAN.  Chapter   7   , “Planning Coverage with Wireless APs,” covers channel 
reuse in greater detail. Be aware that the three-channel limitation also applies to every 
transmitter located in an area—regardless of whether you administer them. Because the 
2.4-GHz band is unlicensed, anyone is free to bring up a transmitter on any of the three 
non-overlapping channels without consulting you or anybody else. In fact, they might 
decide to set their transmitter to use any of the 14 available channels, thinking that none 
of them overlap. 
 Channels in the 5-GHz U-NII Bands 
 Recall that the 5-GHz band is organized as four separate, smaller bands: U-NII-1, U-NII-
2, U-NII-2 Extended, and U-NII-3. The bands are all divided into channels that are 20 
MHz apart, as listed in  Table  2-6 .

 The fact that the 5-GHz space is divided into four different bands might seem confusing. 
Even worse is the channel numbering. For instance, why is the first channel in the U-NII-
1 band called channel 36 instead of channel 1? And why are neighboring channels actu-
ally four channel numbers apart?  
 The answers lie in the 802.11 standard itself: The entire 5-GHz frequency space is 
defined as a sequence of channels spaced 5 MHz apart, beginning with channel 0 at 
5.000 GHz. Therefore, the first U-NII-1 channel is located at 5.180 GHz, which corre-
sponds to channel number 36. Each U-NII channel is 20 MHz wide, so an adjacent chan-
nel is located four 5-MHz channel widths, or four channel numbers, away.  
 The FCC originally allocated three separate bands as U-NII-1, U-NII-2, and U-NII-3, 
each having four 20-MHz channels. In 2004, the FCC added the U-NII-2 Extended band, 
which offered 11 additional 20-MHz channels.  Figure   2-3    shows the complete frequency 
layout of the four bands. Notice that the U-NII-1 and U-NII-2 bands are contiguous, 
but that the U-NII-2 Extended and U-NII-3 bands are separated by a range of frequen-
cies that are unusable at the time of this writing but that might become available in the 
future.  
 Tip  The U-NII-1, -2, and -3 bands each have four channels. Sometimes you may find 
802.11 devices that support a fifth channel in the U-NII-3 band as channel 165. 

Chapter 2: RF Standards  51
 Because the FCC allocated the U-NII bands, no global consensus controls their use. 
Some countries allow all four bands to be used, others allow only a few bands, and still 
others permit none of the bands to be used. 
 The 802.11 standard allows only OFDM modulation and coding schemes to be used in 
the U-NII bands. OFDM requires a 20-MHz channel width, which fits perfectly with the 
20-MHz spacing in the U-NII bands. In other words, neighboring channels can be used in 
the same area without overlap or interference.  
 With all four U-NII bands set aside for wireless LANs, a total of 23 non-overlapping 
channels are available. This is quite a contrast to the three non-overlapping channels in 
the 2.4-GHz band. Having 23 channels at your disposal gives you much more flexibility 
in a crowded environment. The additional channels can also be leveraged to scale wire-
less LAN performance, as explained in the 802.11n and 802.11ac sections later in this 
chapter. 
 IEEE 802.11 Standards 
 The 802.11 standard defines the mechanisms that devices can use to communicate wire-
lessly with each other. Through 802.11, RF signals, modulation, coding, bands, channels, 
and data rates all come together to provide a robust communication medium. 
 Since the original IEEE 802.11 standard was published in 1997, there have been many 
amendments added to it. The amendments cover almost every conceivable aspect of 
wireless LAN communication, including things like quality of service (QoS), security, 
RF measurements, wireless management, more efficient mobility, and ever-increasing 
throughput. 
 By now, most of the amendments have been rolled up into the overall 802.11 standard 
and no longer stand alone. Even so, the amendments may live on and be recognized in 
the industry by their original task group names. For example, the 802.11b amendment 
was approved in 1999, was rolled up into 802.11 in 2007, but is still recognized by its 
name today. When you shop for wireless LAN devices, you will often find the 802.11a,

b, g, and n amendments listed in the specifications.  
 The following sections discuss the progression of 802.11 amendments that have allowed 
wireless LANs to steadily increase in performance over time. The original amendment 
names are used to distinguish each one. At the CCNA level, you should become familiar 
with these amendments. As you read through the remainder of this chapter, notice how 
the transmission types, modulation types, and data rates presented in  Chapter   1    fit into 
the 802.11 standard.  
 802.11-1997 
 The original 802.11 standard was ratified in 1997. It included the only transmission types 
that were available at the time: FHSS and DSSS, for use only in the 2.4-GHz band. The 
theoretical data rates included 1 and 2 Mbps, as listed in  Table  2-7 .

 802.11b 
 To increase throughput over the original 802.11-1997 standard, 802.11b was introduced 
in 1999. It offered data rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps through the use of Complementary 
Code Keying (CCK). Because 802.11b was based on DSSS and was used in the 2.4-GHz 
band, it was backward compatible with the original standard. Devices could select either 
1, 2, 5.5, or 11 Mbps by simply changing the modulation and coding schemes.  Table  2-8 
lists the new data rates introduced in 802.11b.

 With 802.11b, the DSSS maximum data rate was limited to 11 Mbps. To increase data 
rates further, a different transmission type was needed. The 802.11g amendment was 
based on OFDM and was introduced in 2003. It is commonly called Extended Rate PHY 
(ERP) or ERP-OFDM. Whenever you see  ERP , think of 802.11g in the 2.4-GHz band.

 By selecting one of eight different modulation schemes, wireless devices can choose 
data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, or 54 Mbps. The higher data rates can be used when 
the signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are optimal.  
 Clearly, 802.11g offers far superior throughput than 802.11b. It might seem logical to 
simply use 802.11g and its higher data rates everywhere. Sometimes that is not pos-
sible because 802.11b-only devices are still being used on a wireless LAN. Notice that 
802.11g and 802.11b use completely different transmission types—OFDM versus DSSS. 
This means that 802.11g and 802.11b devices cannot communicate directly because they 
cannot understand each other’s RF signals.  
 Oddly enough, 802.11g was designed to be backward compatible with legacy 802.11b 
devices. Devices using 802.11g and OFDM are able to downgrade and understand 
802.11b DSSS messages. However, the reverse is not true; 802.11b devices are limited to 
DSSS, so they are not able to understand any OFDM data. When two 802.11g devices 
are communicating with OFDM, 802.11b devices cannot understand any of the transmis-
sions, so they might interrupt with transmissions of their own. 
 To allow both OFDM and DSSS devices to coexist on a wireless LAN, 802.11g offers a 
 protection mechanism . The idea is to precede each 802.11g OFDM transmission with 
DSSS flags that 802.11b devices can understand.  Figure  2-4 compares the basic sequence 
of events as data is transmitted in a native 802.11g OFDM network and when the 
802.11g protection mechanism is enabled. When an 802.11g device is ready to transmit 
data in protection mode, it first sends a Request to Send (RTS) and a Clear to Send (CTS) 
message using DSSS (and a low data rate) that informs all 802.11b devices that an OFDM 
transmission will follow. Any 802.11b devices that are listening must wait a predefined 
time until the transmission is complete because the OFDM transmission is unintelligible.

 Protection mode is enforced if an 802.11b device is detected on a wireless LAN. If the 
802.11b device leaves the local network, protection mode is lifted. While the protection 
mechanism enables 802.11b and 802.11g devices to share the wireless medium, it also 
reduces throughput significantly—often by one third to one half or more. To get the 
most performance out of an 802.11g network, you should make sure that there are no 
802.11b-only devices in use.  
 Be aware that 802.11g has the following limitations: 
  ■ 
 It is used in the 2.4-GHz band, which offers only three non-overlapping channels.
  ■ 
 OFDM devices are limited to a maximum transmit power of 15 dBm, rather than the
20-dBm limit for DSSS. 
 802.11a 
 Both 802.11b and 802.11g share one problem: They live in the 2.4-GHz ISM band. 
Having only three non-overlapping channels can limit wireless LAN growth in an area—
assuming that all 802.11 devices stay within those three channels and do not cause 
unnecessary interference. Even worse, the ISM band is not limited to 802.11 devices. A 
wide variety of transmitters—even microwave ovens—can use the 2.4-GHz band without 
any regard for channels at all.  
 With too few channels and the potential for interference, the 802.11a amendment was 
introduced to utilize the 5-GHz U-NII bands for wireless LANs. Only one of the four 
U-NII bands is designated as ISM, so the chance for non-802.11 interference is very low. 
In addition, many more channels are available for use.  
 The 802.11a amendment restricts devices to use OFDM only. The end result is a set of 
modulation schemes and data rates that are identical to those used for 802.11g, but with 
less chance for interference and more room for growth.  Table  2-10 lists the data rates 
available with 802.11a.

 802.11a was not designed to be backward compatible with anything else, so there is no 
need to support data rates below 6 Mbps or to support DSSS at all. Wireless devices can 
select one of the eight modulation schemes to support data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 
48, or 54 Mbps.  
 802.11a is based on OFDM channels that are 20 MHz wide. Even though the U-NII 
bands have channels that are spaced 20 MHz apart (a perfect fit), signals on adjacent 
channels might still have a small amount of overlap. Therefore, 802.11a recommends that 
transmitters in the same geographic space stay separated by one channel. In other words, 
one transmitter might use channel 36, but another should use channel 44 rather than the 
adjacent channel 40.  
 Tip  If the 802.11 amendment letters come in chronological order, how could the 
higher-performance 802.11a come before the lower-performance 802.11b? Actually, 
interference on the 2.4-GHz ISM band was so prevalent that a move to the 5-GHz bands 
was proposed right away. The 802.11a amendment was introduced in 1999—earlier in the 
same year as 802.11b. OFDM did come to the 2.4-GHz band, too, with 802.11g in 2003, 
mainly because migrating to 802.11a and 5 GHz required an investment in new hardware.    
 802.11n 
 Under the best conditions, both 802.11g and 802.11a are capable of offering a 54-Mbps 
data rate. Each amendment was introduced in the days when wired Ethernet devices 
used 10- or 100-Mbps connections. As the speed of Ethernet connections has pro-
gressed, 802.11 amendments have been introduced to keep in step.  
 The 802.11n amendment was published in 2009 in an effort to scale wireless LAN per-
formance to a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps. The amendment defines a number 
Key

of techniques known as  high throughput  (HT) that can be applied to either the 2.4- or 
5-GHz band. 802.11n was designed to be backward compatible with 802.11b, 802.11g, 
and 802.11a. 
 Before 802.11n, wireless devices used a single transmitter and a single receiver. In other 
words, the components formed one radio, resulting in a single  radio chain . This is also 
known as a single-in, single-out (SISO) system. The secret to 802.11n’s better performance 
is its use of multiple radio components, forming multiple radio chains. For example, an 
802.11n device can have multiple antennas, multiple transmitters, and multiple receivers at 
its disposal. This is known as a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) system.  
 802.11n devices are characterized according to the number of radio chains available. This 
is described in the form T×R, where  T  is the number of transmitters and  R is the number 
of receivers. A 2×2 MIMO device has two transmitters and two receivers, and a 2×3 
device has two transmitters and three receivers. The 802.11n amendment requires at least 
two radio chains (2×2), up to a maximum of four (4×4).  Figure  2-5 compares the tradi-
tional 1×1 SISO device with 2×2 and 2×3 MIMO devices.

 The multiple radio chains can be leveraged in a variety of ways. In fact, 802.11n has a 
rich set of features that can make many aspects of wireless communication more effi-
cient. You should be familiar with the following features that improve throughput:  
  ■ 
 Channel aggregation 
  ■ 
 Spatial multiplexing (SM) 
  ■ 
 MAC layer efficiency 
 You should also become familiar with the following features that improve the reliability 
of the 802.11n RF signals: 
  ■ 
 Transmit beam forming (T×BF) 
  ■ 
 Maximal-ratio combining (MRC) 
 Each of these features is described in the sections that follow. 

Chapter 2: RF Standards  57
 Channel Aggregation 
 Normally, an 802.11a or 802.11g wireless LAN device has one transmitter and one 
receiver that operate on one 20-MHz channel only. The transmitter and receiver can be 
configured or tuned to operate on different channels in a band, but only one channel at 
a time. Each 20-MHz OFDM channel has 48 subcarriers to carry data in parallel. 
 The 802.11n amendment increased the 20-MHz channel throughput by increasing the 
number of data subcarriers to 52. In addition, it introduced radios that could operate 
on either a single 20-MHz channel or a single 40-MHz channel. By doubling the channel 
width to 40 MHz, the throughput is also doubled.  
 Aggregated channels must always bond two adjacent 20-MHz channels.  Figure  2-6 
shows a comparison between two 20-MHz channels and one 40-MHz channel, formed 
from channels 36 and 40 in the 5-GHz band. Notice that the 20-MHz channels have a 
quiet space below and above, providing some separation between channels. When two 
20-MHz channels are aggregated or bonded, the quiet space below and above remain, 
separating 40-MHz channels from each other. However, the quiet space that used to sit 
between the two 20-MHz channels can be used for additional subcarriers in the 40-MHz 
channel, for a total of 108. As more subcarriers are utilized, more data can be carried 
over time.

 When channels are aggregated, the total number of available channels in a band decreas-
es. For example, the 5-GHz band is made up of 23 non-overlapping 20-MHz channels. If 
Key 
Topic

58  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
aggregated 40-MHz channels are used instead, only 11 non-overlapping channels would 
be possible. That still gives plenty of channels to work with.  
 Now consider the 2.4-GHz band, which has only three non-overlapping channels. It just 
is not practical to try to aggregate any of them into 40-MHz channels. Therefore channel 
aggregation is not recommended and not normally attempted on any 2.4-GHz channels.  
 Spatial Multiplexing 
 Channel aggregation can double the throughput by doubling the channel width—all 
with a single radio chain. An 802.11n device can have multiple radio chains waiting to 
be used. To increase data throughput even more, data can be multiplexed or distrib-
uted across two or more radio chains—all operating on the same channel, but separated 
through spatial diversity. This is known as  spatial multiplexing . 
 How can several radios transmit on the same channel without interfering with each 
other? The key is to try to keep each signal isolated or easily distinguished from the 
others. Each radio chain has its own antenna; if each antenna is spaced some distance 
apart, the signals arriving at the receiver’s antennas (also appropriately spaced) will likely 
be out of phase with each other or at different amplitudes. This is especially true if the 
signals bounce off some objects along the way, making each antenna’s signal travel over a 
slightly different path to reach the receiver.  
 In addition, data can be distributed across the transmitter’s radio chains in a known fash-
ion. In fact, several independent streams of data can be processed as  spatial streams that 
are multiplexed over the radio chains. The receiver must be able to interpret the arriving 
signals and rebuild the original data streams by reversing the transmitter’s multiplexing 
function. 
 Spatial multiplexing requires a good deal of digital signal processing on both the trans-
mitting and receiving end. This pays off by increasing the throughput over the chan-
nel—the more spatial streams that are available, the more data that can be sent over the 
channel.  
 The number of spatial streams that a device can support is usually designated by adding 
a colon and a number to the MIMO radio specification. For example, a 3×3:2 MIMO 
device would have three transmitters, three receivers, and would support two unique 
spatial streams.  Figure   2-7    shows spatial multiplexing between two 3×3:2 MIMO devices. 
A 3×3:3 device would be similar, but would support three spatial streams. 
 Tip  Notice that a MIMO device can support a different number of unique spatial 
streams than it has transmitters or receivers. It might seem logical that each spatial stream 
is assigned to a transmitter/receiver, but that is not true. Spatial streams are processed 
so that they are distributed across multiple radio chains. The number of possible spatial 
streams depends on the processing capacity of the 802.11n device—not on the number 
of its radios. 
Key 
Topic

Chapter 2: RF Standards  59
 802.11n devices come with a variety of MIMO capabilities. Ideally, two devices should 
support an identical number of spatial streams to multiplex and demultipex the data 
streams correctly. That is not always possible or even likely because more spatial streams 
usually translates to a greater cost. What happens when two devices have mismatched 
spatial stream support? They negotiate the wireless connection by informing each other 
of their capabilities. Then they can use the lowest number of spatial streams that they 
have in common, but a transmitting device can leverage an additional spatial stream to 
repeat some information for increased redundancy. 
 MAC Layer Efficiency 
 Even without multiple radio chains, 802.11n offers some important methods to make 
data communication more efficient. Two of the methods are as follows:  
  ■ 
 Block acknowledgment    —Normally, 802.11 requires that each frame of data trans-
mitted must be acknowledged by the recipient. If a frame goes unacknowledged,
the transmitter can assume that the frame was lost and needs to be resent. The over-
head of having acknowledgment messages interleaved with every transmitted frame
is inefficient; it uses up airtime on the shared media.
 With 802.11n, data frames can be transmitted in one burst. Only one acknowledg-
ment is expected from the recipient after the burst is complete. More airtime can be
spent sending data, increasing the overall throughput. 
  ■ 
 Guard interval    —As OFDM symbols are transmitted, they can take different paths
to reach the receiver. If two symbols somehow arrive too close together, they can
interfere with each other and corrupt the received data. This is known as  intersym-
bol interference  (ISI). The 802.11 standard requires a  guard interval  (GI), a period
of 800 nanoseconds, between each OFDM symbol that is transmitted to protect
against ISI.

 As an option, you can configure 802.11n devices to use a much shorter 400-
nanosecond guard interval. This allows OFDM symbols to be transmitted more 
often, increasing throughput by about 10 percent, at the expense of making data 
corruption more likely.  
 Transmit Beam Forming (T×BF) 
 When a transmitter with a single radio chain sends an RF signal, any receivers that are 
present have an equal opportunity to receive and interpret the signal. In other words, the 
transmitter does nothing to prefer one receiver over another; each is at the mercy of its 
environment and surrounding conditions to receive at a decent SNR. 
 The 802.11n amendment offers a method to customize the transmitted signal to prefer 
one receiver over others. By leveraging MIMO, the same signal can be transmitted over 
multiple antennas to reach specific client locations more efficiently.  
 Usually multiple signals travel over slightly different paths to reach a receiver, so they 
can arrive delayed and out of phase with each other. This is normally destructive, result-
ing in a lower SNR and a corrupted signal. With  transmit beamforming (T×BF), the 
phase of the signal is altered as it is fed into each transmitting antenna so that the result-
ing signals will all arrive in phase at a specific receiver. This has a constructive effect, 
improving the signal quality and SNR.  
 Figure  2-8    shows an 802.11n device using transmit beamforming to target device B. The 
phase of each copy of the transmitted signal is adjusted so that all three signals arrive at 
device B more or less in phase with each other. The same three signal copies also arrive 
at device A, which is not targeted by T×BF. As a result, the signals arrive as is and are out 
of phase.

Chapter 2: RF Standards  61
 The location and RF conditions can be unique for each receiver in an area. Therefore, 
transmit beamforming can use explicit feedback from an 802.11n device at the far end, 
enabling the transmitter to make the appropriate adjustments to the transmitted signal 
phase. As T×BF information is collected about each far end device, a transmitter can 
keep a table of the devices and phase adjustments so that it can send focused transmis-
sions to each one dynamically. Although the feedback process sounds straightforward, 
it is complex to implement. To date, no vendor has implemented a feedback mechanism 
that makes T×BF practical and  usable. 
 Cisco also offers ClientLink, which performs a similar transmit beamforming function; 
however, ClientLink does not require explicit feedback from an 802.11n device at all. 
Based on data that is received from a far end device, the phase values can be calculated 
and performed on data transmissions that are returned to it. In this case, the far end 
device can be 802.11n or legacy 802.11a/b/g.  
 Maximal-Ratio Combining 
 When an RF signal is received on a device, it may look very little like the original trans-
mitted signal. The signal may be degraded or distorted due to a variety of conditions. 
If that same signal can be transmitted over multiple antennas, as in the case of a MIMO 
device, then 802.11n can attempt to restore it to its original state. 
 An 802.11n device can use multiple antennas and radio chains to receive the multiple 
transmitted copies of the signal. One copy might be better than the others, or one 
copy might be better for a time, and then become worse than the others. In any event, 
802.11n offers  maximal-ratio combining (MRC), a feature that can combine the copies 
to produce one signal that represents the best version at any given time. The end result is 
a reconstructed signal with an improved SNR and receiver sensitivity. 
 802.11n Modulation and Coding Schemes 
 Recall that 802.11g and 802.11a are both based on OFDM and can use binary phase 
shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16-QAM (quadrature ampli-
tude modulation), and 64-QAM modulation schemes. Depending on conditions affect-
ing the RF signal, wireless devices can choose one of the eight possible modulation and 
coding schemes. The 802.11n amendment is backward compatible with 802.11a and 
802.11g, so it supports the same eight schemes. However, as the schemes are applied to 
an increasing number of spatial streams, the number of combinations multiplies.  
 802.11n supports a total of 32 possible schemes (8 per spatial stream)—so many that 
they are known by a modulation coding scheme (MCS) index number. Beyond that, 
channel aggregation and guard interval selection add even more variables to the mix. In 
all, 802.11n has 128 possible data rates. For your reference,  Appendix  B lists all of the 
MCS and data rates.

 Beyond 802.11n 
 The many features and high throughput of 802.11n might make it seem like the end-all 
wireless LAN technology. As with most any aspect of computing, the current state of 
the art is never good enough. Two 802.11 draft amendments are being developed that 
will take wireless performance to much greater heights. These amendments are not cov-
ered on the CCNA Wireless exam (yet), but are introduced here so that you can get a 
feel for the continuing evolution of 802.11 capabilities.  
 The 802.11ac amendment takes the best of 802.11n and offers a new generation that 
is much faster and more scalable. The goal is to bring wireless on a par with Gigabit 
Ethernet. Some of the most notable improvements are as follows:  
  ■ 
 Better channel aggregation    —40-MHz bonded channels can be bonded again into
channels that are 80 or 160 MHz wide. 
  ■ 
 More dense modulation    —256-QAM will be used to modulate the RF signal in 256
different ways, taking more data at one time and boosting throughput. The 802.11n
modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM) will still be supported. 
  ■ 
 Scalable MIMO    —Up to eight spatial streams will be used.
  ■ 
 Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)    —An 802.11ac device will be able to send multiple
frames to multiple receiving devices simultaneously. 
 Because of the extensive use of channels, 802.11ac will be used only in the 5-GHz band. 
Devices using 2.4 GHz will have to continue using 802.11n instead. With 802.11ac, 
devices should have a selection of 40 modulation coding schemes, based on the number 
of spatial streams. When channel aggregation and guard interval variables are figured in, 
there should be a total of 320 possible data rates. 
 802.11ac hardware is expected to develop somewhat slowly, in phases or waves. 
Products in the first wave will be able to reach a throughput of 1 to 2.4 Gbps. When 
the second wave of product development peaks, those devices could reach a theoretical 
maximum throughput of 6.93 Gbps.  
 In 2009, the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) introduced a wireless specification that 
would offer throughput of up to 7 Gbps over the unlicensed 60-GHz frequency space. 
That specification became the 802.11ad amendment.  
 802.11ad is designed for very high throughput at shorter distances, making it a good fit 
for wireless offices. Devices will be able to communicate directly with each other, with 
support for interfaces like HDMI, DisplayPort, USB, and PCIe. 
 The 802.11ad amendment is meant to be backward compatible with 802.11 (including 
802.11a, b, g, n, and ac), but will require new hardware because it operates in a com-
pletely different frequency band. 

Chapter 2: RF Standards  63
 Wi-Fi Alliance 
 All wireless LAN products must adhere to the IEEE 802.11 set of standards to be 
compatible with each other. Even though the 802.11 standards are very thorough and 
lengthy, it is still possible for one manufacturer to build a product based on one inter-
pretation of a standard feature, while another manufacturer works with a different inter-
pretation. This is especially true when products are developed while an 802.11 amend-
ment is still in draft form. In addition, manufacturers are not obligated to implement 
every function described in a standard; they may pick and choose certain parts or imple-
ment the entire standard, and  may even add in some proprietary features. 
 The Wi-Fi Alliance ( http://wi-fi.org ) is a nonprofit industry association made up of wire-
less manufacturers around the world, all devoted to promoting wireless use. To address 
the problem of incompatible wireless products, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced the 
Wi-Fi CERTIFIED program in 2000. Wireless products are tested in authorized testing 
labs against stringent criteria that represent correct implementation of a standard. If a 
product passes the tests, then it is certified and receives a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED stamp of 
approval, using the logo shown in  Figure  2-9 . 
 Figure 2-9  Wi-Fi Alliance Certification Logo. 
 For example, a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 802.11n product must correctly implement the fol-
lowing features, among many others:  
  ■ 
  At least two spatial streams
  ■ 
 Block acknowledgment 
  ■ 
 2.4- and 5-GHz operation 
  ■ 
 Channel aggregation 
 Tip  Remember that the IEEE develops and maintains the 802.11 set of standards and 
the Wi-Fi Alliance tests and certifies product interoperability according to the standards.

 Radio frequency (RF) signals travel through the air as electromagnetic waves. In an ideal 
setting, a signal would arrive at the receiver exactly as the transmitter sent it. In the real 
world, this is not always the case. Many things affect RF signals as they travel from a 
transmitter to a receiver. This chapter explores many of the conditions that can affect 
wireless signal propagation.

 Interference 
 The idea behind WLAN modulation is to pack as much data as possible into the wire-
less signal, and to minimize the amount of data that might be lost due to interference or 
noise. When data is lost, it must be retransmitted, using more of the wireless resources. 
Therefore, it is always best if a transmitter is configured to use a channel that is open 
and is clear from any other transmitter.  
 Co-Channel Interference 
 Whenever one transmitter’s signal overlaps another on a frequency or channel, the sig-
nals interfere with each other. Interference can be described by the way the signals over-
lap. For example,  co-channel interference occurs when two or more transmitters use the 
same channel. In  Figure   3-1   , Transmitters A and B are both transmitting an RF signal on 
channel 6 in the 2.4-GHz band.

 Figure 3-1  Co-Channel Interference. 
 Because the two 802.11 transmitters are using the same channel, their signals completely 
overlap and the whole 22-MHz channel bandwidth is affected. This might not be a 
problem if the transmitters are not sending data at the same time. After all, wireless LAN 
devices must contend for use of the airtime; if nobody is transmitting at a given time, 
someone may use the channel.  
 When both transmitters are busy sending data, the channel can become very congested. 
The two signals begin to interfere and cause data corruption, which causes devices to 
retransmit lost data, which uses more airtime, and so on. 
 In the real world, co-channel interference is often a necessary evil. The 2.4-GHz band 
offers only three non-overlapping channels. If you have many transmitters in a building 
or area, you are bound to have some of them transmitting on the same channel as others. 
The best solution is to use careful planning when you select the channel for each trans-
mitter. For instance, two nearby transmitters should never be placed on the same channel 
because their strong signals would be more likely to interfere.  
 Instead, a transmitter should only share a channel with other distant transmitters whose 
received signals are much weaker. A best practice is to place a transmitter on a channel 

Chapter 3: RF Signals in the Real World  71
only if its signal will be at least 19 dBm above any other received signal, as shown in 
 Figure   3-2 . Having at least 19 dBm separation helps maintain a healthy SNR in the area 
surrounding the transmitter. Channel assignment is covered in more detail in  Chapter   7   ,

 Neighboring Channel Interference 
 Suppose that two transmitters are placed on two different channels. However, the chan-
nels are spaced too closely together such that they overlap each other. Perhaps someone 
decided to use neighboring channels, rather than reuse the same channel, to avoid co-
channel interference. More likely, two different people have transmitters located in the 
same general area and decided to use slightly different channel numbers—not realizing 
that neighboring channels in the 2.4-GHz band overlap.  
 The end result is  interference on both channels because a portion of one signal overlaps 
a portion of another signal. In  Figure  3-3 , transmitter A is using channel 6, while trans-
mitter B is using channel 7. The two signals do not completely overlap, but the interfer-
ence between them is enough to be detrimental to both.

 Figure 3-3  Adjacent Channel Interference. 
 Tip  Do you think of neighboring channels as having adjacent channel numbers? You are 
not alone; after all, channel numbers 1 and 2 are adjacent. Interference between neighbor-
ing channels is commonly called  adjacent channel interference . Technically, this term 
is incorrect and is often misused. The 802.11 standard defines adjacent channels as non-
overlapping channels. Therefore, by definition, it is impossible for adjacent channels to 
overlap and interfere. Be aware that the CCNA Wireless exam strictly uses the terminol-
ogy found in the 802.11 standard.  Adjacent channels cannot overlap, but  neighboring 
channels can. 
Key 
Topic

72  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 To remedy the situation, all transmitters in an area should be configured to use the three 
non-overlapping 2.4-GHz channels: 1, 6, and 11. In the 5-GHz band, adjacent channel 
interference is not a problem because the channels do not significantly overlap; the 
channels are 20 MHz wide, whereas the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing 
(OFDM) signals have a bandwidth of 20 MHz. As a best practice, you should still avoid 
placing neighboring APs on neighboring 5 GHz channels, just to avoid the possibility of 
raising the noise floor.  
 Non-802.11 Interference 
 Recall that the 2.4-GHz band is an ISM band. This means that your 802.11 wireless LAN 
devices might share the same frequency space as non-802.11 devices. That might not 
sound like a bad situation because the devices could simply be configured to use differ-
ent, non-overlapping channels.  
 In practice, such an elegant solution might not be possible. Many non-802.11 devices 
do not sit on any one channel; they use frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) to 
hop around on a variety of channels at any given time. Even worse, some devices do 
not adhere to any channel scheme at all.  Figure  3-4 shows transmitters A, B, and C using 
channels 1, 6, and 11—a perfect world—until someone decides to warm up her lunch. 
A nearby microwave oven also uses RF energy in the 2.4-GHz ISM band to radiate the 
food. Because it is poorly shielded, the RF energy escapes and interferes with most of 
the 802.11b/g channels. The microwave’s transmission is also constant, rendering the 
wireless LAN channels mostly useless.

 To mitigate interference from non-802.11 devices, you have to eliminate the source. 
Leaky microwave ovens should be replaced with better models that have proper RF 
shielding. Devices like 2.4-GHz FHSS cordless phones or wireless video cameras should 
be replaced with models that operate in a non-802.11 band. 
 Free Space Path Loss 
 Whenever an RF signal is transmitted from an antenna, its amplitude decreases as it trav-
els through free space. Even if there are no obstacles in the path between the transmitter 
and receiver, the signal strength will weaken. This is known as  free space path loss. 
 What is it about free space that causes an RF signal to be degraded? Is it the air or 
maybe the earth’s magnetic field? No, even signals sent to and from spacecraft in the 

Chapter 3: RF Signals in the Real World  73
vacuum of outer space are degraded.  
 Recall that an RF signal propagates through free space as a wave, not as a ray or straight 
line. The wave has a three-dimensional curved shape that expands as it travels. It is this 
expansion or spreading that causes the signal strength to weaken.  
 Figure   3-5 shows a cutaway view of the free space loss principle. Suppose the antenna is 
a tiny point, such that the transmitted RF energy travels in every direction. The wave that 
is produced would take the form of a sphere; as the wave travels outward, the sphere 
increases in size. Therefore, the same amount of energy coming out of the tiny point 
is soon spread over an ever expanding sphere in free space. The concentration of that 
energy gets weaker as the distance from the antenna increases.  
 Figure 3-5  Free Space Loss Due to Wave Spreading. 
 Even if you could devise an antenna that could focus the transmitted energy into a tight 
beam, the energy would still travel as a wave and would spread out over a distance. 
Regardless of the antenna used, the amount of signal strength loss is consistent.  
 The free space path loss in dB can be calculated according to the following equation: 
 FSPL (dB) = 20log 10 (d) + 20log 10 (f) + 32.44 
 where  d  is the distance from the transmitter in kilometers and  f is the frequency in mega-
hertz. Do not worry, though: you will not have to know this equation for the CCNA 
Wireless exam. It is presented here to show two interesting facts:  
  ■ 
  Free space path loss is an exponential function; the signal strength falls off quickly
near the transmitter, but more slowly farther away. 

74  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
  ■ 
 The loss is a function of distance and frequency only.
 With the formula, you can calculate the free space path loss for any given scenario, but 
you will not have to for the exam. Just be aware that the free space path loss is always an 
important component of the link budget, along with antenna gain and cable loss. 
 You should also be aware that the free space path loss is greater in the 5-GHz band than 
it is in the 2.4-GHz band. In the equation, as the frequency increases, so does the loss in 
dB. This means that 802.11b/g/n devices (2.4 GHz) have a greater effective range than 
802.11a/n (5 GHz) devices, assuming an equal transmitted signal strength.  Figure  3-6 
shows the range difference, where both transmitters have an effective isotropic radiated 
power (EIRP) of 14 dBm and the effective range ends where a receiver’s received signal 
strength indicator (RSSI) equals –67 dBm.

 Tip  To get a feel for the actual range difference between 2.4 and 5 GHz, a receiver was 
carried away from the two transmitters until the RSSI reached –67 dBm. On a 2.4-GHz 
channel, the range was measured to be 140 feet, whereas at 5 GHz it was reduced to 80 
feet.  
 Mitigating the Effects of Free Space Path Loss 
 One simple solution to overcome free space path loss is to increase the transmitter’s out-
put power. Increasing the antenna gain can also boost the EIRP. Having a greater signal 
Key 
Topic

Chapter 3: RF Signals in the Real World  75
strength before the free space loss occurs translates to a greater RSSI value at a distant 
receiver after the loss. This approach might work fine for an isolated transmitter, but can 
cause interference problems when several transmitters are located in an area.  
 A more robust solution is to just cope with the effects of free space path loss. Wireless 
devices are usually mobile and can move closer to or farther away from a transmitter 
at will. As a receiver gets closer to a transmitter, the RSSI increases. This, in turn, trans-
lates to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recall from  Chapter   1   , “RF Signals and 
Modulation,” that more complex modulation and coding schemes can be used to trans-
port more data when the SNR is high. As a receiver gets farther away from a transmitter, 
the RSSI (and SNR) decreases. More basic modulation and  coding schemes are needed 
there because of the increase in noise and the need to repeat more data.  
 802.11 devices have a clever way to adjust their modulation and coding schemes based 
on the current RSSI and SNR conditions. If the conditions are favorable for good signal 
quality and higher data rates, a complex modulation and coding scheme is used. As the 
conditions deteriorate, less-complex schemes can be selected, resulting in a greater range 
but lower data rates. The scheme selection is commonly known as  dynamic rate shifting 
(DRS). As its name implies, it can be performed dynamically with no manual interven-
tion. 
 Tip  Although DRS is inherently used in 802.11 devices, it is not defined in the 802.11 
standard. Each manufacturer can have its own approach to DRS; so all devices don’t 
necessarily select the same scheme at the same location. DRS is also known by many 
alternative names, such as  link adaptation ,  adaptive modulation and coding (AMC),  rate 
adaptation , and so on.   
 Figure   3-7    illustrates DRS operation on the 2.4-GHz band. Each concentric circle repre-
sents the range supported by a particular modulation and coding scheme. The figure is 
somewhat simplistic because it assumes a consistent power level across all modulation 
types. Notice that the white circles denote OFDM modulation (802.11g) and that the 
shaded circles contain DSSS modulation (802.11b). The data rates are arranged in order 
of increasing circle size or range from the transmitter.  
 Suppose that a mobile user starts out near the transmitter, within the innermost circle, 
where the received signal is strong and SNR is high. Most likely, wireless transmissions 
will use the OFDM 64-QAM 3/4 modulation and coding scheme to achieve a data rate 
of 54 Mbps. As the user walks away from the transmitter, the RSSI and SNR fall by some 
amount. The new RF conditions will likely trigger a shift to a different modulation and 
coding scheme, resulting in a lower data rate.  
 In a nutshell, each move into a larger concentric circle causes a dynamic shift to a 
reduced data rate, in an effort to maintain the data integrity to the outer reaches of the 
transmitter’s range.  
 The 5-GHz band looks very similar to  Figure   3-7 , except that every circle uses an OFDM 
modulation scheme corresponding to 802.11a.

 Effects of Physical Objects 
 As an RF signal propagates through free space, it might encounter physical objects in 
its path. Objects and materials can affect an RF signal in a variety of ways, mostly in a 
degrading or destructive fashion. The following sections cover the most common 
scenarios. 
 Reflection 
 If an RF signal traveling as a wave meets a dense reflective material, the signal can be 
reflected. Think of the light emitted from a light bulb; while most of the light is traveling 
in all directions away from the bulb, some might be reflected from objects in a room. 
The reflected light might travel back toward the bulb or toward another area of the 
room, making that area even brighter.  
 Figure  3-8    depicts a reflected RF signal. Indoor objects such as metal furniture, filing 
cabinets, and metal doors can cause reflection. An outdoor wireless signal can be reflect-
ed by objects such as a body of water, reflective glass on a building, or the surface of the 
earth.

 Figure 3-8  Reflection of an RF Signal. 
 A reflection is not necessarily bad because it is just a copy of the original signal. 
However, if both the copy and the original reach a receiver, they can arrive out of phase 
with each other. This is because the reflection takes a different path than the original, 
causing it to arrive slightly later. This is known as  multipath . When the receiver com-
bines the two signals, the result is a poor representation of the original signal. The com-
bined signal can be weak and distorted, causing the data to be corrupted.  
 In  Figure   3-9   , the original signal, along with two different reflections, arrive at the receiv-
er embedded in a laptop computer. The two reflections each take a different path and 
arrive at different times.

 When multipath transmissions occur, there can be two outcomes: 
  ■ 
  If the receiver has a single radio chain, then all of the arriving signals (original and
reflected) are combined into one poor, error prone composite signal. 
  ■ 
  If the receiver has multiple radio chains and supports multiple-input, multiple-out-
put (MIMO), each arriving signal might be received on a different antenna or radio.
Further processing can improve the signal quality or extract multiple data streams—
making something good out of a bad situation.

 Absorption 
 If an RF signal passes into a material that can absorb some of its energy, the signal will 
be attenuated. The more dense the material, the more the signal will be attenuated. 
 Figure  3-10    shows how a signal is affected by absorption and how a receiver might be 
affected by the lower signal strength.  
 Figure 3-10  Absorption of an RF Signal. 
 One common example of absorption is when a wireless signal passes through a wall in 
a building. Different wall materials absorb different amounts of energy. For example, a 
wall constructed from gypsum or drywall might attenuate a signal by –4 dBm. A solid 
concrete wall might attenuate it by –12 dBm. The thicker the wall or the more dense the 
material, the greater the attenuation will be.  
 In outdoor wireless scenarios, RF signals frequently have to travel through water. The 
water might be contained in tree leaves positioned along the wireless path. Even in unob-
structed space, the signal might encounter water in the form of rain, snow, hail, or fog. 
As the air is filled with heavier rain or snow, the signal will be attenuated more.  
 Another less-obvious example of absorption is the human body, which is made up most-
ly of water. A person will usually hold a laptop computer, tablet PC, or a smartphone 
close to his or her body. Depending on how the person is oriented with respect to the 
transmitter, his body could sit between the transmitter and the receiver, attenuating the 
signal. Likewise, a classroom or auditorium might be filled with human bodies, each with 
the potential to attenuate the signal from a transmitter. 
 Tip  To gain perspective, a quick experiment revealed that a human body attenuated a 
2.4-GHz signal by –5 dBm.  
 Scattering 
 When an RF signal passes into a medium that is rough, uneven, or made up of very small 
particles, the signal can be scattered into many different directions. This is because the 

Chapter 3: RF Signals in the Real World  79
tiny irregular surfaces of the medium can reflect the signal, as shown in  Figure   3-11   . 
Scattering can occur when a wireless signal passes through a dusty or sandy environment.  
 Figure 3-11  Scattering an RF Signal. 
 Refraction 
 When an RF signal meets the boundary between media of two different densities, it can 
also be refracted. Think of reflection as bouncing off a surface and refraction as being 
bent while passing through a surface.  
 A refracted signal will have a different angle from the original, as illustrated in  Figure  3-
12 . The speed of the wave can also be affected as it passes through the different materi-
als. A signal can be refracted when it passes through layers of air having different densi-
ties or through building walls with different densities, for example.  
 Figure 3-12  Refraction of an RF Signal. 

80  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Diffraction 
 Suppose an RF signal approaches an opaque object, or one that is able to absorb the 
energy that strikes it. You might think that the object would produce a shadow in place 
of the signal that is absorbed, much like an object might make a shadow as light shines 
on it. If a shadow formed, it might make a dead or silent zone in the RF signal behind 
the object. 
 With RF propagation, however, the signal tends to bend around the object and eventu-
ally rejoin to complete the wave.  Figure   3-13 shows how a radio opaque object can cause 
diffraction of an RF signal. Diffraction is best viewed as concentric waves, rather than 
an oscillating signal, so that its effect on the actual waves can be seen. In the figure, dif-
fraction has caused the signal to “heal” itself around an absorbing object. This makes 
reception possible even when a building stands between the transmitter and receiver. 
However, the signal is never quite like the original again, as it has been distorted  by the 
diffraction. 
 Figure 3-13  Diffraction of an RF Signal. 
 Fresnel Zones 
 If an object is standing free, so that an RF signal traveling parallel with the ground is 
diffracted around it on both sides, the signal will often fill in the object’s “shadow” as it 
continues to propagate. However, if a standing object such as a building or a mountain 
obstructs the signal, the signal can be adversely affected in the vertical direction.  
 In  Figure   3-14   , a building partially obstructs the path of the signal. Because of diffrac-
tion along the front and top of the building, the signal is bent and also attenuated. This 
causes the signal to be masked behind most of the height of the building. 
 Figure 3-14  A Standing Obstacle Diffracts a Signal. 

Chapter 3: RF Signals in the Real World  81
 This is especially important in narrow line-of-sight wireless transmission, which is suited 
for very long distances. These signals do not propagate in all directions; rather, they are 
focused into a tight cone-shaped pattern, as shown in  Figure  3-15 . For a line-of-sight 
path, the signal must be clear of any obstructions between the transmitter’s antenna and 
the receiver’s antenna. Paths between buildings or between cities commonly have other 
buildings, trees, or other objects that might block the signal. In those cases, the antennas 
must be raised higher than the obstructions to get a clear path. 
Transmitter
Receiver
 Figure 3-15  A Line-of-Sight Wireless Signal. 
 Over a very long distance, the curvature of the earth actually becomes an obstacle that 
can affect the signal. Beyond a distance of about two miles, the far end cannot be seen 
because it lies slightly below the horizon. Nevertheless, a wireless signal tends to propa-
gate along the same curve, following the atmosphere around the earth’s curvature.  
 Even narrow line-of-sight signals can be affected by diffraction, even if an object does 
not directly block the signal. There is an elliptical-shaped volume around the line of sight 
that must also remain free of obstructions. This is called the  Fresnel zone , as shown in 
 Figure   3-16   . If an object penetrates the Fresnel zone anywhere along the path, some por-
tion of the RF signal can be diffracted by it. That portion of the signal gets bent, causing 
it to be delayed or altered so that it affects the overall signal arriving at the receiver.  
 Tip  Actually, there are many concentric Fresnel zones surrounding the line of sight 
path. Only the innermost, or first, Fresnel zone is described in this section and taken into 
account because it affects the transmitted signal the most. Fresnel zones are numbered 
incrementally as their size increases. Oddly enough, the odd-numbered Fresnel zones 
have a destructive effect on signals, whereas the even-numbered zones can have a con-
structive effect and add to the signal’s power.

 In  Figure   3-17   , a building lies along the signal’s path, but does not obstruct the beam 
of the signal; however, it does penetrate the Fresnel zone, so the received signal will be 
negatively affected.

 As a rule, you should raise the antennas of a line-of-sight system so that even the bottom 
of the Fresnel zone is higher than any obstruction. Remember that as the path gets very 
long, even the curvature of the earth can enter the Fresnel zone and cause problems, as 
Figure 3-18 shows. 
 Figure 3-18  The Earth’s Curvature Enters the Fresnel Zone. 
 The radius of the Fresnel zone can be calculated according to a complex formula. 
However, you should only be concerned with the idea that the Fresnel zone exists and 
should remain clear.  Table   3-2    gives some example values of the Fresnel zone radius at 
the midpoint of some line-of-sight path lengths for wireless frequencies in the 2.4GHz 
band.

 Antenna Characteristics 
 The world of wireless LANs would be rather simple if all antennas were created equal—
too simple, in fact. To provide good wireless LAN coverage in a building, an outdoor 
area, or between two locations, you might be faced with a number of variables. For 
example, an office space might be arranged as a group of open cubicles or as a strip of 
closed offices down a long hallway. You might have to cover a large open lobby, a large 
open classroom, a section of a crowded sports arena, an oblong portion of a hospital 
roof where helicopters land, a large  expanse of an outdoor park, city streets where pub-
lic safety vehicles travel, and so on.  
 In other words, one type of antenna cannot fit every application. Instead, antennas come 
in many sizes and shapes, each with its own gain value and intended purpose. The fol-
lowing sections describe antenna characteristics in more detail.  
 Radiation Patterns 
 Recall from  Chapter   1   , “RF Signals and Modulation,” that antenna gain is normally a 
comparison of one antenna against an isotropic antenna, and is measured in dBi (decibel-
isotropic). An isotropic antenna does not actually exist because it is ideal, perfect, and 
impossible to construct. It is also the simplest, most basic antenna possible, which makes 
it a good starting place for antenna theory. 
 An isotropic antenna is shaped like a tiny round point. When an alternating current is 
applied, an RF signal is produced and the electromagnetic waves are radiated equally in 
all directions. The energy produced by the antenna takes the form of an ever-expanding 
sphere. If you were to move all around an isotropic antenna at a fixed distance, you 
would find that the signal strength is the same. 
 To describe the antenna’s performance, you might draw a sphere with a diameter that is 
proportional to the signal strength, as shown in  Figure  4-1 . Most likely, you would draw 
the sphere on a logarithmic scale so that very large and very small numbers could be 
shown on the same linear plot. A plot that shows the relative signal strength around an 
antenna is known as the  radiation pattern . 
 It is rather difficult to show a three-dimensional plot or shape on a two-dimensional 
document—especially if the shape is complex or unusual. After all, most physical anten-
nas are not ideal, so their radiation pattern is not a simple sphere. Instead, you could 
slice through the three-dimensional plot with two orthogonal planes and show the two 
outlines that are formed from the plot. In  Figure  4-1 , the sphere is cut by the XY plane, 
which lies flat along the horizon, and by the XZ plane, which lies vertically along the 
elevation of the sphere.  Figure  4-2 shows the resulting cuts.

 The plane at the left is known as the  H plane or the  azimuth plane , and usually shows a 
top down view of the radiation pattern through the center of the antenna. The plane at 
the right is known as the  E plane  or  elevation plane, and shows a side view of the same 
radiation pattern.  
 The outline of each plot can be recorded on a polar plot, as shown by the heavy dark 
lines in  Figure   4-3   . A polar plot contains concentric circles that represent relative chang-
es in the signal strength as measured at a constant distance from the antenna. The out-
ermost circle usually represents the strongest signal strength, and the inner circles rep-
resent weaker signal strength. Although the circles are labeled with numbers like 0, –5, 
–10, –15, and so on, they do not necessarily represent any absolute dB values. Instead,
they are measurements that are relative to the maximum value at the outside  circle. If the 
maximum is shown at the outer ring, everything else will be less than the maximum and 
will lie further inward.

 Are you confused? You aren’t alone. The E and H polar plots of the radiation pattern 
are presented here because most antenna manufacturers include them in their product 
literature. The antenna is always placed at the center of the polar plots, but you will not 
always be able to figure out how the antenna is oriented with respect to the E and H 
planes. Cisco usually includes a small picture of the antenna at the center of the plots as 
a handy reference.  
 As a wireless engineer, you will have to look at various antenna patterns and try to figure 
out whether the antenna is a good match for the environment you are trying to cover 
with an RF signal. You will need a good bit of imagination to merge the two plots into 
a 3D picture in your mind. As various antennas are described in this chapter, the plots, 
planes, and a 3D rendering are presented to help you get a feel for the thinking process. 
 Gain 
 Antennas are passive devices; they do not amplify a transmitter’s signal with any circuitry 
or external power. Instead, they amplify or add gain to the signal by shaping the RF 
energy as it is propagated into free space. In other words, the  gain of an antenna is a 
measure of how effectively it can focus RF energy in a certain direction. 
 Because an isotropic antenna radiates RF energy in all directions equally, it cannot focus 
the energy in any certain direction. Recall from  Chapter  1 that the gain of an antenna in 
dBi is measured relative to an isotropic antenna. When an isotropic antenna is compared 
with itself, the result is a gain of 10log(1) or 0 dBi. 
 Think of a zero gain antenna producing a perfect sphere. If the sphere is made of rub-
ber, you could press on it in various locations and change its shape. As the sphere is 
deformed, it expands in other directions.  Figure  4-4 shows some simple examples, along 
with some example gain values. As you work through this chapter and examine antennas 
on your own, notice how the gain is lower for omnidirectional antennas, which are made 
to cover a widespread area, and higher for directional antennas, which are built to cover 
more focused areas.  
 Figure 4-4  Radiation Patterns for the Three Basic Antenna Types. 
 Tip  The gain itself is not indicated on either E or H plane radiation pattern plots. The 
only way to find an antenna’s gain is to look at the manufacturer’s specifications.  

92  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Beamwidth 
 The antenna gain can be an indicator of how focused an antenna’s pattern might be, but 
it is really more suited for link budget calculations. Instead, many manufacturers list the 
 beamwidth  of an antenna as a measure of the antenna’s focus. Beamwidth is normally 
listed in degrees for both the H and E planes. 
 The beamwidth is determined by finding the strongest point on the plot, which is usually 
somewhere on the outer circle. Next, the plot is followed in either direction until the 
value decreases by 3 dB, indicating the point where the signal is one-half the strongest 
power. A line is drawn from the center of the plot to intersect each 3 dB point, and then 
the angle between the two lines is measured.  Figure  4-5 shows a simple example. The H 
plane has a beamwidth of 30 degrees, and the E plane has a beamwidth of 55 degrees.

 Polarization 
 When an alternating current is applied to an antenna, an electromagnetic wave is pro-
duced. From  Chapter   1   , you learned that the wave has two components: an electrical 
field wave and a magnetic field wave. The electrical portion of the wave will always leave 
the antenna in a certain orientation. For example, most Cisco antennas produce a wave 
that oscillates up and down in a vertical direction as it travels through free space. Other 
antennas might be designed to produce waves that oscillate back and forth horizontally. 
Still others might produce waves that actually twist in a three-dimensional spiral motion. 
 The wave’s orientation is called the antenna  polarization. Antennas that produce vertical 
oscillation are vertically polarized; ones that produce horizontal oscillation are horizon-
tally polarized. By itself, the antenna polarization is not of critical importance. However, 
the antenna polarization at the transmitter must be matched to the polarization at the

receiver. If the polarization is mismatched, the received signal can be severely degraded.  
  Figure   4-6    illustrates antenna polarization. The transmitter and receiver along the top 
both use vertical polarization, so the received signal is optimized. The pair along the bot-
tom is mismatched, causing the signal to be poorly received.

 Tip  Even though Cisco antennas are designed to use vertical polarization, someone 
might mount an antenna in an unexpected orientation. For example, suppose you mount 
a transmitter with its antennas pointing upward. After you leave, someone knocks the 
antennas so that they are turned sideways. Not only does that change the radiation pat-
tern you were expecting, it also changes the polarization.  
 Antenna Types 
 Wireless LAN antennas are available in a variety of styles, shapes, and radiation pat-
terns. In addition, antennas are normally rated for indoor or outdoor use, depending on 
weather resistance and mounting options. Antennas are usually designed for a specific 
frequency range and are approved by the local regulatory body, such as the FCC in the 
US. There are two basic types of antennas, omnidirectional and directional, which are 
discussed in the following sections.

 Omnidirectional Antennas 
 An omnidirectional antenna is usually made in the shape of a thin cylinder. It tends to 
propagate a signal equally in all directions away from the cylinder, but not along the 
cylinder’s length. The result is a donut-shaped pattern that extends further in the H plane 
than the E plane. This type of antenna is well suited for broad coverage of a large room 
or floor area where the antenna is located in the center. Because an omnidirectional 
antenna distributes the RF energy throughout a broad area, it has a relatively low gain. 
 A common type of omnidirectional antenna is the  dipole , shown in the left portion of 
 Figure  4-7   . Some dipole models are articulated such that they can be folded up or down, 
depending on the mounting orientation, whereas others are rigid and fixed. As its name 
implies, the dipole has two separate wires that radiate an RF signal when an alternating 
current is applied across them, as shown in the right portion of  Figure  4-7 . Dipoles usu-
ally have a gain of around +2 to +5 dBi.  
 Figure 4-7  A Cisco Dipole Antenna. 
 The E and H plane radiation patterns for a typical dipole antenna are shown in  Figure 
 4-8 . In the E plane, think of the dipole lying on its side in the center of the plot; the 
H plane is looking down on the top of the dipole.  Figure  4-9 takes the patterns a step 
further, showing how the two planes are superimposed and merged to reveal the three-
dimensional radiation pattern. 
 Dipoles are often connected to wireless LAN devices that mount on the ceilings of 
rooms and hallways. Most dipole antennas are between 3.5 and 5.5 inches long, so they 
are not always aesthetically pleasing when they stick down from a ceiling. For this rea-
son, Cisco offers several monopole antennas as an alternative.  
 Monopole antennas are very short—less than 2 inches in length, as shown in  Figure  4-10 . 
To achieve such a small size, they contain only one short length of wire. You can think 
of this as a compromised dipole antenna, where one of the antenna segments stands out 
away from the wireless device. The other segment is moved down into the device, in 
the form of a metal ground plane. Therefore, monopole antennas can be used only on 
devices that have a large, flat metal casing. The radiation pattern is similar to that of a 
dipole, but not quite as symmetrical.  Monopole antennas have a typical gain of 2.2 dBi 
in the 2.4-and 5-GHz bands.

 To reduce the size of an omnidirectional antenna even further, many Cisco wireless 
access points (APs) have integrated antennas that are hidden inside the device’s smooth 
case. For example, the AP shown in  Figure  4-11 has six tiny antennas hidden inside it.

 Tip  What about wireless LAN adapters that are used in mobile devices like laptops and 
smartphones? Because the adapters are so small, their antennas must also be tiny. As a 
result, USB wireless adapters often have a gain of 0 dBi, while some smartphones even 
have a negative gain!    
 Directional Antennas 
 Directional antennas have a higher gain than omnidirectional antennas because they 
focus the RF energy in one general direction. Typical applications include elongated 
indoor areas, such as the rooms along a long hallway or the aisles in a warehouse. They 
can also be used to cover outdoor areas out away from a building or long distances 
between buildings.  
 Patch antennas have a flat rectangular shape, as shown in  Figure  4-14 , so that they can be 
mounted on a wall.  
 Figure 4-14  A Typical Cisco Patch Antenna. 

98  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Patch antennas produce a broad egg-shaped pattern that extends out away from the flat 
patch surface. The E and H radiation pattern plots are shown in  Figure  4-15 . When the 
planes are merged as shown in  Figure   4-16 , you can see the somewhat broad directional 
pattern that results. Patch antennas have a gain of about 6 to 8 dBi in the 2.4-GHz band 
and 7 to 10 dBi at 5 GHz.

 Figure 4-16  A Patch Antenna Radiation Pattern in Three Dimensions. 
 Figure  4-17    shows the Yagi-Uda antenna, named after its inventors, and more commonly 
known as the Yagi. Although its outer case is shaped like a thick cylinder, the antenna is 
actually made up of several parallel elements of increasing length.

Chapter 4: Understanding Antennas  99
 Figure   4-18    shows the E and H radiation pattern plots. A Yagi produces a more focused 
egg-shaped pattern that extends out along the antenna’s length, as shown in  Figure  4-19 . 
Yagi antennas have a gain of about 10-14 dBi in the 2.4-GHz band. Cisco does not offer 
a 5-GHz Yagi.  
 Figure 4-18  E and H Radiation Patterns for a Typical Yagi Antenna. 
 Figure 4-19  A Yagi Antenna Radiation Pattern in Three Dimensions. 
 In a line-of-sight wireless path, an RF signal must be propagated a long distance using 
a narrow beam. Highly directional antennas are tailored for that use, but focus the RF 
energy along one narrow elliptical pattern. Because the target is only one receiver loca-
tion, the antenna does not have to cover any area outside of the line of sight.  
 Dish antennas, such as the one shown in  Figure  4-20 , use a parabolic dish to focus 
received signals onto an antenna mounted at the center. The parabolic shape is important 
because any waves arriving from the line of sight will be reflected onto the center anten-
na element that faces the dish. Transmitted waves are just the reverse; they are aimed at 
the dish and reflected such that they are propagated away from the dish along the line 
of sight.

 Figure  4-21    shows the radiation patterns in the E and H planes, which are merged into 
three dimensions in  Figure   4-22   . Notice how the antenna’s coverage pattern is long and 
narrow, extending out away from the dish. The focused pattern gives the antenna a gain 
of between 20 and 30 dBi—the highest gain of all the wireless LAN antennas.

 Antenna Summary 
 Table   4-2    lists each antenna type and style, along with typical beamwidth and gain val-
ues. You can use this table as a summary to help compare the antennas side by side. 
Notice that the beamwidth is the largest for omnidirectional antennas, and then begins 
to narrow through the progression of directional antennas. The opposite is true of the 
gain—omnidirectional antennas have the lowest gain, whereas directional antennas 
increase gain as their beamwidth narrows.

 Adding Antenna Accessories 
 Occasionally, you may find that you are simply not able to meet the path link budget 
between a transmitter and a receiver. This might be because the distance, and therefore 
the free space path loss, is too great. Perhaps the transmitter does not offer enough 
output power, or the cable connecting the transmitter to the antenna is too long or intro-
duces too much loss. You can add an  amplifier to provide additional gain, provided the 
EIRP does not exceed the maximum value allowed. An amplifier is an active, powered 
device that is connected inline between a transmitter and an antenna, as shown in  
Figure  4-23 .

 At other times, you may need to reduce the signal strength of a transmitter beyond what 
is possible with the transmitter settings. For example, the transmitter may already be 
configured for its lowest possible transmit power level, but the signal strength is still too 
great for nearby receivers. You can position an  attenuator , a passive device that absorbs 
part of the energy, inline between a transmitter and an antenna, as shown in  Figure  4-24 .

Attenuator

 When a transmitter or receiver is connected to an outdoor antenna, there is always 
the possibility that lightning will induce a tremendous amount of energy through the 
antenna—enough to damage the wireless LAN equipment and portions of the network. 
To protect against such damage, you should always connect a  lightning arrestor inline 
between an outdoor antenna and a wireless LAN device, as shown in  Figure   4-25   .  
Transmitter

Arrestor
 Figure 4-25  Using a Lightning Arrestor to Protect Sensitive Wireless LAN Equipment. 
 The lightning arrestor has two connectors that attach to the two ends of coaxial cable, in 
addition to a grounding lug, which should connect to the nearest building or electrical 
ground. The RF signal is allowed to pass on through the lightning arrestor, but sudden 
spikes of electricity will be bypassed to ground. Contrary to its name, a lightning arres-
tor can never prevent the damage from a direct lightning strike. In can, however, prevent 
damage that might occur due to static electricity discharges or transient voltage spikes 
during thunderstorms.

 Types of Wireless Networks 
 The term  wireless LAN  is used quite freely in this book. After all, it is the central theme 
of the CCNA Wireless exam, but it is only one type of wireless network that you might 
encounter. Wireless networks can be classified into four main types according to the 
geographic scope where a signal and service is available.  Figure  5-1 gives a general idea 
of the network types and their scopes.  
WLAN

  ■ 
 Wireless personal-area network (WPAN) —As its name implies, a WPAN uses low-
powered transmitters to create a network with a very short range, usually 20 to 30
feet (7 to 10 meters). WPANs are based on the IEEE 802.15 standard and include
technologies like Bluetooth and ZigBee, although ZigBee can have a greater range.
Unlicensed ISM frequencies are used, including the 2.4-GHz band.
  ■ 
 Wireless local-area network (WLAN) —A wireless service that connects multiple
devices using the IEEE 802.11 standard over a medium-sized range, usually up to
300 feet (100 meters). Unlicensed frequencies in the 2.4- and 5-GHz band are used.
  ■ 
 Wireless metropolitan-area network (WMAN) —A wireless service over a large
geographic area, such as all or a portion of a city. One common example, WiMAX,
is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. Licensed frequencies are commonly used.

Chapter 5: Wireless LAN Topologies  109
  ■ 
 Wireless wide-area network (WWAN) —A wireless data service for mobile phones
that is offered over a very large geographic area (regional, national, and even global)
by telecommunications carriers. Licensed frequencies are used. 
 The remainder of this chapter focuses on WLANs and how they are constructed. 
 Wireless LAN Topologies 
 Up to this point, this book has discussed radio frequency (RF) signals as they travel from 
a transmitter to a receiver. As  Figure  5-2 shows, the transmitter can contact the receiver 
at any and all times, as long as both devices are tuned to the same frequency (or channel) 
and use the same modulation and coding scheme. That all sounds simple, except that it is 
not really practical. 
Transmitter
Receiver

Device B
 Figure 5-2  Unidirectional Communication. 
 To fully leverage wireless communication, data should travel in  both directions, as 
shown in  Figure   5-3   . Sometimes Device A needs to send data to Device B, while Device 
B would like to take a turn to send at other times.

 Because the two devices are using the same channel, two phrases in the preceding sen-
tence become vitally important:  Take a turn and  send at other times . As you learned in 
previous chapters, if multiple signals are received at the same time, they interfere with 
each other. The likelihood of interference increases as the number of wireless devices 
grows. For example,  Figure   5-4    shows four devices tuned to the same channel and what 
might happen if some or all of them transmit at the same time.  
Device A
Device B
Device D
Device C
 Figure 5-4  Interference from Simultaneous Transmissions. 
 All this talk about waiting turns and avoiding interference should remind you of an 
Ethernet LAN, where multiple hosts can share common bandwidth and a collision 
domain. To use the media effectively, all the hosts must operate in half-duplex mode 
so that they avoid colliding with other transmissions. The side effect is that no host can 
transmit and receive at the same time on a given frequency. 

110  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Tip  IEEE 802.11 WLANs are always half duplex because transmitting and receiving 
stations use the same frequency. Only one station can transmit at any time; otherwise, 
collisions occur. To achieve full-duplex mode, all transmitting would have to occur on 
one frequency and all receiving would occur over a different frequency—much like full-
duplex Ethernet links work. Although this is certainly possible and practical, the 802.11-
2012 standard does not permit full-duplex operation. The 802.11ac amendment will ease 
that restriction in its “wave 2” implementation.  
 A wireless LAN is very similar. Because multiple hosts can share the same channel, they 
also share the “airtime” or access to that channel at any given time. Therefore, to keep 
everything clean, only one device should transmit at any given time. To contend for use 
of the channel, devices based on the 802.11 standard have to determine whether the 
channel is clear and available before transmitting anything. This process is described in 
more detail in  Chapter   6   , “Understanding 802.11 Frame Types.” 
 At the most basic level, there is no inherent organization to a wireless medium or any 
inherent control over the number of devices that can transmit and receive frames. Any 
device that has a wireless network adapter can power up at any time and try to com-
municate. At a minimum, a wireless network should have a way to make sure that every 
device using a channel can support a common set of parameters, including data rates, 
802.11 modulation types, channel width, and so on. Beyond that, there should be a way 
to control which devices (and users) are allowed to use the wireless medium, and the 
methods that are used to secure the wireless transmissions.  
 Basic Service Set 
 The solution is to make every wireless service area a closed group—before a device can 
participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join. The 
802.11 standard calls this a  basic service set (BSS). At the heart of every BSS is a wire-
less  access point  (AP), as shown in  Figure  5-5 . The AP operates in  infrastructure mode , 
which means it offers the services that are necessary to form the infrastructure of a wire-
less network. 
 Because the operation of a BSS hinges on the AP, the BSS is bounded by the area where 
the AP’s signal is usable. This is known as the  basic service area (BSA) or  cell . In  Figure 
 5-5 , the cell is shown as a simple circular area that might result from the radiation pat-
tern of an omnidirectional antenna. Cells can have other shapes too, depending on the 
antenna that is connected to the AP and on the physical surroundings.  
 The AP serves as a single point of contact for every device that wants to use the BSS. It 
advertises the existence of the BSS so that devices can find it and try to join. To do that, the 
AP uses a unique BSS identifier (BSSID) that is based on the AP’s own radio MAC address.  
 In addition, the AP advertises the wireless network with a service set identifier (SSID), 
which is a text string containing a logical name. Think of the BSSID as a machine-
readable name tag that identifies the unique BSS ambassador (the AP), and the SSID as a 
human readable name tag that identifies the wireless service.  

Chapter 5: Wireless LAN Topologies  111
 Membership with the BSS is called an  association. A device must send an association 
request and the AP must either grant or deny the request. Once associated, a device 
becomes a client, or an 802.11  station (STA), of the BSS. What then? As long as a wire-
less client remains associated with a BSS, most communications to and from the client 
must pass  through  the AP, as indicated in  Figure  5-6 . By using the BSSID as a source or 
destination address, data frames can be relayed to or from the AP.  
 You might be wondering why all client traffic has to traverse the AP at all. Why cannot 
two clients simply transmit data frames directly to each other and bypass the middle-
man? If clients are allowed to communicate directly, then the whole idea of organizing 
and managing a BSS is moot. By sending data through the AP first, the BSS remains sta-
ble and under control. The 802.11z amendment provides an exception to the rule, which 
permits two clients to communicate directly without passing through an AP—only if the 
communication is mediated by an AP.  
 Tip  Even though data frames are meant to pass through an AP, keep in mind that other 
devices in the same general area that are listening on the same channel can overhear the 
transmissions. After all, frames are freely available over the air to anyone that is within 
range to receive them. Only the BSSID value contained within the frames indicates that 
the intended sender or recipient is the AP.

 Distribution System 
 Notice that a BSS involves a single AP and no explicit connection into a regular Ethernet 
network. In that setting, the AP and its associated clients make up a standalone network. 
But the AP’s role at the center of the BSS does not just stop with managing the BSS—
sooner or later, wireless clients will need to communicate with other devices that are 
not members of the BSS. Fortunately, an AP can also uplink into an Ethernet network 
because it has both wireless and wired capabilities. The 802.11 standard refers to the 
upstream wired Ethernet as the  distribution system (DS) for the wireless BSS, as shown 
in  Figure  5-7 . 
 You can think of an AP as a translational bridge, where frames from two dissimilar media 
(wireless and wired) are translated and then bridged at Layer 2. In simple terms, the AP 
is in charge of mapping a virtual local-area network (VLAN) to an SSID. In  Figure   5-7 , 
the AP maps VLAN 10 to the wireless LAN using SSID “MyNetwork.” Clients associated 
with the “MyNetwork” SSID will appear to be connected to VLAN 10.  
 This concept can be extended so that multiple VLANs are mapped to multiple SSIDs. 
To do this, the AP must be connected to the switch by a trunk link that carries the 
VLANs. In the  Figure   5-8   , VLANs 10, 20, and 30 are trunked to the AP over the DS. 
The AP uses the 802.1Q tag to map the VLAN numbers to the appropriate SSIDs. For

example, VLAN 10 is mapped to SSID “MyNetwork,” VLAN 20 is mapped to SSID 
“YourNetwork,” and VLAN 30 to SSID “Guest.”    
 In effect, when an AP uses multiple SSIDs, it is trunking VLANs over the air to wireless 
clients. The clients must use the appropriate SSID that has been mapped to the respec-
tive VLAN when the AP was configured. The AP then appears as multiple logical APs—
one per BSS—with a unique BSSID for each. With Cisco APs, this is usually accom-
plished by incrementing the last digit of the radio’s MAC address for each SSID.  
 Even though an AP can advertise and support multiple logical wireless networks, each of 
the SSIDs covers the same geographic area. That is because the AP uses the same trans-
mitter, receiver, antennas, and channel for every SSID that it supports. Beware of one 
misconception though: Multiple SSIDs can give an illusion of scale. Even though wireless 
clients can be distributed across many SSIDs, all of those clients must share the same 
AP’s hardware and must contend for airtime on the same channel.

 Extended Service Set 
 Normally, one AP cannot cover the entire area where clients might be located. For 
example, you might need wireless coverage throughout an entire floor of a business, 
hotel, hospital, or other large building. To cover more area than a single AP’s cell, you 
simply need to add more APs and spread them out geographically.  
 When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected 
by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS), 
as shown in  Figure  5-9 . 
 Tip  Chapter   7   , “Planning Coverage with Wireless APs,” discusses AP and cell placement 
in greater detail. 
 The idea is to make multiple APs cooperate so that the wireless service is consistent and 
seamless from the client’s perspective. Ideally, any SSIDs that are defined on one AP 
should be defined on all the APs in an ESS; otherwise, it would be very cumbersome and 
inconvenient for a client to be reconfigured each time it moves into a different AP’s cell. 
 Notice that each cell in  Figure   5-9    has a unique BSSID, but both cells share one common 
SSID. Regardless of a client’s location within the ESS, the SSID will remain the same but 
the client can always distinguish one AP from another.

 In an ESS, a wireless client can associate with one AP while it is physically located near 
that AP. If the client later moves to a different location, it can associate with a different 
nearby AP automatically. Passing from one AP to another is called  roaming and is cov-
ered in  Chapter  6 . 
 Independent Basic Service Set 
 Usually a wireless network leverages APs for organization, control, and scalability. 
Sometimes that is not possible or convenient in an impromptu situation. For example, 
two people might want to exchange electronic documents at a meeting, but they are 
unable to find a BSS available. In addition, many personal printers have the capability to 
print documents wirelessly, without relying on a regular BSS or AP. 
 The 802.11 standard allows two or more wireless clients to communicate directly with 
each other, with no other means of network connectivity. This is known as an  ad hoc 
wireless network, or an  independent basic service set (IBSS), as shown in  Figure  5-10 .

For this to work, one of the devices must take the lead and begin advertising a network 
name and the necessary radio parameters. Any other device can then join as needed.  
IBSS

 Regardless of their convenience, ad hoc networks are seldom recommended and used 
because of their limitations. The 802.11 standard intended for IBSSs to be organized in 
an impromptu, distributed fashion. Therefore, they do not scale well beyond eight to ten 
devices.  
 Other Wireless Topologies 
 Wireless APs can be configured to operate in noninfrastructure modes when a normal 
BSS cannot provide the functionality that is needed. The following sections cover the 
most common modes.  
 Repeater 
 Normally, each AP in a wireless network has a wired connection back to the DS or 
switched infrastructure. To extend wireless coverage, additional APs and their wired 
connections are added. In some scenarios, it is not possible to run a wired connection to 
a new AP because the cable distance is too great to support Ethernet communication. 
 In that case, you can add an additional AP that is configured for  repeater mode . A wire-
less repeater takes the signal it receives and repeats or retransmits it. The idea is to move 
the repeater out away from the AP so that it is still within range of both the AP and the 
distant client, as shown in  Figure  5-11 . 
 If the repeater has a single radio, there is a possibility that the AP’s signal will be received 
and retransmitted by the repeater, only to be received again by the AP—halving the 
effective throughput. As a remedy, some repeaters can use two radios to keep the origi-
nal and repeated signals isolated. One radio is dedicated to signals in the AP’s cell, while 
the other radio is dedicated to signals in the repeater’s own cell.   

Chapter 5: Wireless LAN Topologies  117
 Workgroup Bridge 
 Suppose you have a device that supports a wired Ethernet link but is not capable of 
having a wireless connection. You can use a workgroup bridge (WGB) to connect the 
device’s wired network adapter to a wireless network. 
 Rather than providing a BSS for wireless service, a WGB becomes a wireless client of a 
BSS. In effect, the WGB acts as an external wireless network adapter for a device that 
has none. In  Figure   5-12   , an AP provides a BSS; Client A is a regular wireless client, while 
Client B is associated with the AP through a WGB.

 You might encounter two types of workgroup bridges: 
  ■ 
 Universal workgroup bridge (uWGB) —A single wired device can be bridged to a
wireless network. 
  ■ 
 Workgroup bridge (WGB)    —A Cisco-proprietary implementation that allows mul-
tiple wired devices to be bridged to a wireless network.
 Outdoor Bridge 
 An AP can be configured to act as a bridge to form a single wireless link from one LAN 
to another over a long distance. Outdoor bridged links are commonly used for connec-
tivity between buildings or between cities. 
 If the LANs at two locations need to be bridged, a point-to-point bridged link can be used. 
One bridge mode AP is needed on each end of the wireless link. Directional antennas are 
normally used with the bridges to maximize the link distance, as shown in  Figure  5-13 .

 Sometimes the LANs at multiple sites need to be bridged. A point-to-multipoint bridged 
link allows a central site to be bridged to several other sites. The central site bridge 
is connected to an omnidirectional antenna so that its signal can reach the other sites 
simultaneously. The bridges at each of the other sites can be connected to a directional 
antenna aimed at the central site.  Figure   5-14 shows the point-to-multipoint scenario.

 Mesh Network 
 To provide wireless coverage over a large area, it is not always practical to run Ethernet 
cabling to every AP that is needed. Instead, you could use multiple APs configured in 
mesh mode. In a mesh topology, traffic is bridged from AP to AP, in a daisy-chain 
fashion. 
 Mesh APs can leverage dual radios—one in the 2.4-GHz band and one in the 5-GHz 
band. Each mesh AP usually maintains a BSS on a 2.4-GHz channel, with which wireless 
clients can associate. Client traffic is then usually bridged from AP to AP over 5-GHz 
channels as a backhaul network. At the edge of the mesh network, the backhaul traffic 
is bridged to the wired LAN infrastructure.  Figure  5-15 shows a typical mesh network. 
With Cisco APs, you can build a mesh network indoors or outdoors. The mesh network 
runs its own dynamic routing protocol to work out the best path for backhaul traffic to 
take across the mesh APs.

 Wireless networks based on the 802.11 standard operate in a very organized and con-
trolled fashion. The standard defines the frame format and frame types that access 
points (APs) and clients must use to communicate successfully. Before a device trans-
mits on a channel, it must cooperate with all other devices and contend for use of the 
channel. This chapter covers these topics and the choreography that occurs between an 
access point (AP) and its clients.

 802.11 Frame Format 
 To understand more about 802.11 frames and how they are transported, it might be use-
ful to compare them with the familiar 802.3 frames.  
 Ethernet devices based on IEEE 802.3 send and receive frames in the format shown in 
 Figure  6-1   . The sender and the intended recipient of a frame are identified by two MAC 
addresses—a source and a destination. The source address is not used to deliver the 
frame; rather, it is used for any return traffic that is sent back to the source. When the 
recipient receives a frame that has its own MAC address as the destination, the frame is 
then accepted and processed.

 Suppose that the source and destination hosts are connected by a switched network, as 
shown in  Figure   6-2   . The switch that connects the two hosts forwards frames between 
them as needed, but it does not intervene or actively participate in the exchange. In 
other words, neither host has to be aware of the switch’s existence at all. Frames enter 
and exit a switch simply because hosts are connected to it through wires or cables. The 
switch silently forwards the frames based on the destination MAC addresses and the 
device locations it has learned from the source MAC addresses.

 Figure 6-2  Forwarding 802.3 Frames in a Switched Network. 
 In contrast, the APs in an 802.11 network are active participants. Recall from  Chapter  5 , 
“Wireless LAN Topologies,” that an AP acts as the central “hub” or manager of a basic 
service set (BSS). With the absence of wired connections, a client must join or associate 
with a specific wireless network by first getting permission from the AP. Then the client 
must send and receive every frame through the AP or coordinate with the AP for direct 
client-to-client communication to use 802.11z - Direct Link Setup (DLS). 
 IEEE 802.11 networks are based on traditional MAC addresses. Each client’s radio inter-
face must have a unique MAC address so that frames can be sent from and received to 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  127
that address. To direct frames through an AP, the AP must also have a MAC address of 
its own. Wireless clients know the AP’s address as the BSS identifier (BSSID), which must 
be included in each frame.  
  Figure   6-3    shows the basic format of 802.11 frames, which can be a maximum of 2346 
bytes in length. The frame begins with a 2-byte Frame Control field, which identifies 
such things as the frame type and the direction in which the frame is traveling as it 
moves from one wireless device to another.

 Consider a common scenario where several wireless clients are associated with an AP. 
This is not a standalone BSS—the AP also connects to an upstream DS. Most of the 
time, wireless frames pass through the AP, either coming from clients toward the DS or 
coming from the DS toward the clients. Frame motion is indicated by 2 bits,  To DS and 
 From DS , contained in the 802.11 frame header. On the surface, it seems that frames 
travel in only one of two directions, relative to the DS, as shown in the simple examples 
of  Figure  6-4 .

 With just two frame directions to indicate, a single bit would suffice. Why are there two 
different direction bits in the frame header? There are two other special cases where 
frames are destined for something other than a specific wireless client or somewhere in 
the distribution system (DS), as shown in  Figure  6-5 . This gives a total of four possible 
destinations, or 2 bits worth of direction values.

 Figure 6-5  Examples of 802.1.1 Frames That Are Not Moving to and from the DS. 
 One special case commonly occurs when a frame is sourced or destined from a location 
that cannot be clearly defined in relation to the DS. In the following examples, both the 
To DS and From DS bits are set to 0:  
  ■ 
 An AP sends a management or control frame, which is broadcast to all wireless cli-
ents in the BSS. The AP, and not the DS, is the source of the frame. 
  ■ 
 A client sends a management frame to an AP, such that the AP itself is the destina-
tion. 
  ■ 
 One client sends a frame directly to another client via DLS. The frame is not des-
tined for the AP or the DS.
 The other special case is related to mesh AP networks, where frames are relayed from 
AP to AP over wireless backhaul links. A backhaul link is neither in the BSS nor in the 
DS, so both direction bits are set to 1.  
 802.11 Frame Addressing 
 From an addressing viewpoint, an 802.11 frame header can contain up to four differ-
ent address fields. In  Figure   6-3   , you can see them listed with the rather generic names 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  129
Address1 through Address4. Wireless frames are always sent from a transmitting device 
to a receiving device. Therefore, each frame header must contain a transmitter address 
(TA) and a receiver address (RA). The Address1 field always contains the RA, though its 
exact contents may vary depending on where the frame is headed. Likewise, Address2 
always contains the TA.  
 Address3 contains the final destination address when the RA is not the final recipient. 
For example, when a wireless client sends a frame to a destination on the DS, the frame 
is transmitted from the client’s wireless adapter, is received by the AP, but still needs to 
be forwarded on to the final destination on the DS. Likewise, Address3 can contain the 
original source address when the TA is not the originator. Consider a frame sent from a 
device on the DS to a wireless client. When the frame is sent over the wireless medium, 
the AP’s radio is the  transmitter address, but the AP did not originate the frame—a 
device on the DS did.  
 Address4 does not come into play unless a frame is being transported from one AP to 
another AP across a wireless link. In that case, the frame has to carry the original sender 
and recipient addresses, in addition to the MAC addresses of a receiver and transmit-
ter—the APs relaying the frame over the air. 
 Table   6-2    lists the possible combinations of frame direction bits, along with the four 
address field contents. You should become familiar with frame addressing, as the CCNA 
Wireless exam may cover it. Try to break the table down into parts. First, get comfort-
able with the To/From DS bits and the reasons behind the frame directions. Next, think 
about what happens to a frame each step along the way as it travels from its source to 
its destination. Does it stop at the AP? Does the AP relay it to or from a more distant 
location? Remember that Address1 and Address2 are always the receiver and transmitter 
MAC addresses, respectively. Address3 will contain the address of an additional hop, if 
one is needed.

 Host1 is sending the frame through the AP to the DS, so the Address1 (RA) contains the 
BSSID 0000.9999.9999. Frame1 is sourced or transmitted by Host1, so the Address2 
(TA) field contains Host1’s MAC address, 0000.1111.1111. The frame must pass 
through the AP, so Host1 populates Address3 with the destination address of Host2, 
0000.2222.2222. Once the AP receives Frame1, it finds that Host2 is located on the DS, 
so the wireless frame is converted into an 802.3 wired frame. The original source and 
destination addresses are copied into the new frame so that it can be forwarded on to 
Host2. 
 On the return trip, Host2 fills in the source and destination addresses of Frame2 in 802.3 
format. The switch forwards the frame to the AP, which knows that the destination 
(Host1) is located within the wireless BSS. The AP populates Address1 (RA) with the des-
tination address of Host1. The AP is transmitting the frame, so Address2 (TA) contains 
the BSSID. The address of the original source, Host2, is copied into the Address3 field. 
 Accessing the Wireless Medium 
 Once a wireless device has data to send, it must access the network medium and try to 
send it. Remember that a wireless channel is a shared medium and that every device try-
ing to use it must share the airtime and contend for its use. There is no centralized func-
tion that coordinates the use of a wireless channel. Instead, this effort is distributed to 
each device that uses a channel. This is known as a  distributed coordination function 
(DCF) . 
 With a shared medium, such as wired Ethernet or wireless, two or more stations trans-
mitting at the same time can cause collisions. A collision ruins the transmitted data, 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  131
wastes time on the medium, and causes the data to be retransmitted—wasting even more 
time. When full-duplex operation isn’t possible, some collisions are inevitable; therefore, 
every device should make its best attempt to mitigate and/or hopefully prevent colli-
sions in the first place.  
 Carrier Sense 
 Devices based on the 802.3 and 802.11 standards must use the carrier sense multiple 
access (CSMA) technique to determine if the media is available before transmitting. 
Wired devices are able to sense an electrical signal on the wire to detect a transmission 
already in progress. Wireless devices can use a two-fold process to detect a channel in 
use: 
  ■ 
 Physical Carrier Sense    —When a wireless client is not transmitting, it can listen to
the channel to overhear any other transmissions that might be occurring. If it over-
hears a frame that is destined for its own MAC address, then it receives the frame
for processing. Otherwise, if a transmission is detected but the client cannot read
the transmitter’s MAC address in the header, the client decides that the channel is
busy. This process is also known as  clear channel assessment (CCA) . While CCA is
effective, it isn’t a proactive approach and must be used in conjunction with other
methods. 
  ■ 
 Virtual Carrier Sense    —When a wireless client transmits a frame, it must include a
duration field in the Duration/ID frame header field. The duration indicates how
many microseconds are required for the whole frame to be sent over the channel,
and effectively reserves the channel for that length of time. As long as other wireless
clients can overhear a frame and its header, they can predict how long they should
wait for the frame to complete.  Figure   6-7    depicts the frame duration field and its
relationship to the frame length in time,

 Figure 6-7  The 802.11 Frame Duration Field. 
 Each wireless client must maintain a  network allocation vector (NAV) timer that is used 
to predict when the channel will become free. Each time a frame is overheard on the 
channel, its Duration value is loaded into the NAV. The NAV timer then counts down 
while the client waits to transmit.  
 The NAV timer must be at zero before a client can contend for use of the channel. That 
sounds simple, but the contention process is still a bit more complex. Sensing the carrier 
alone can alert a client when the medium is quiet and available—except that every cli-

ent on the channel will come to the same conclusion at the same time! If multiple clients 
have frames to transmit and all decide that the channel is free at the same time, collisions 
are still likely.  
 Collision Avoidance 
 The 802.3 and 802.11 standards differ when it comes to dealing with collisions. Wired 
devices can  detect  collisions in real time so that they can back off and wait a random 
time to try again. This is known as CSMA/CD (collision detection).  
 Wireless devices always operate in half-duplex mode, which prevents a client from 
receiving signals on a channel while it is transmitting. This means that a transmitting wire-
less client can’t detect when a collision occurs at all. Therefore, 802.11 devices must try 
to  avoid collisions in the first place, resulting in the CSMA/CA (collision avoidance) 
scheme. 
 Wireless clients avoid collisions by backing off and waiting a random time  before trans-
mitting. If a client has a frame to transmit, it must then choose a random number (0 to 
31) of timeslots to use as a  backoff timer . If there are multiple clients with frames ready
to transmit, their random backoff timer values will lessen the likelihood that they will 
contend to use a channel at the same time.  
 If the channel becomes busy before the backoff timer reaches zero, the timer is paused 
and the overheard frame duration value is added to the NAV. The waiting client can 
transmit only when every timer mechanism has expired and the channel is available. The 
total time a client spends waiting to transmit is called the  contention window . 
 Believe it or not, there is one more timing scheme that controls frame transmission. The 
802.11 standard defines a few different  interframe space periods that provide a safety 
cushion between frames. These periods of silence give the channel enough time for sig-
nals to dampen out—especially when multipath is involved and some reflected copies 
take longer to propagate than others.  
 Several different interframe space periods are used, according to the type and priority of 
the frame being transmitted:  
  ■ 
 Reduced interframe space (RIFS)    —The shortest period of time, used before each
data frame during a burst of 802.11n frames
  ■ 
 Short Interframe Space (SIFS)    —Used between data frames and frame acknowl-
edgements or, CTS 802.11g protection mode control frames
  ■ 
 Distributed Interframe Space (DIFS) —The default period used after most standard
priority frame types 
  ■ 
 Extended interframe space (EIFS)    —The longest period of time, used after colli-
sions and before retransmitted frames 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  133
 Tip  If you feel confused over all of the timer mechanisms, try to remember this simple 
rule. Before a device can transmit on a channel, it must do the following: 
 1.  Wait for DIFS. 
 2.   Wait for its own backoff timer.
 3.  Listen. 
 4.  Wait for contention window (backoff timer + NAV).  If the channel is clear after-
ward, the client may transmit. 
 Assuming all of the carrier sense and collision avoidance methods have worked, how 
does a transmitting client know that the frame it just sent arrived in good condition? 
During transmission, the receiver must be off, so there is no way to listen to the channel. 
Instead, every client must rely on a very rudimentary feedback mechanism. Each time 
a client receives a unicast frame, it must send a unicast acknowledgement frame back 
to the sender. The 802.11 standard requires this one-to-one response for every frame 
received, except in the case of 802.11n and 802.11e (WMM) bursts of frames, which 
require one acknowledgement for a whole block of frames. 
 If a transmitted frame fails and is not acknowledged, the sending client must try again by 
retransmitting the frame. The client chooses a new backoff timer value that is double the 
previous choice. In effect, this relaxes the conditions on the channel to give the retrans-
mitted frame a better chance of surviving. With every failed attempt, the backoff timer 
is doubled, up to a maximum of 1023 timeslots.

 The following sequence of events occurs:  
 1.  Client A listens and determines that no other devices are transmitting. Client A waits
a random backoff timer period before transmitting Frame-A. The frame’s duration is
advertised in the header’s Duration field.
 2.  Client B has a frame to transmit. It must wait until Client A’s frame is completed and
then wait until a DIFS period has expired.
 3.   Client B waits a random backoff time before attempting to transmit.
 4.   While Client B is waiting, Client C has a frame to transmit. Like Client B, Client C
must wait until the DIFS period has elapsed. Client C then listens and detects that
no one else is transmitting. It then waits a random backoff time that is shorter than
Client B’s backoff timer. 
 5.   Client C transmits a frame and advertises the frame duration in the Duration field.
 6.   Client B must now wait the duration of Client C’s frame plus a DIFS period plus the
remainder of its own backoff timer before attempting to transmit again.
 802.11 Frame Types 
 The 802.11 standard defines three different frame types that can be used: 
  ■ 
 Management frames 
  ■ 
 Control frames 
  ■ 
 Data frames 
 The frame type is identified by a 2-bit Type field and a 4-bit SubType field in the Frame 
Control portion of the header. This implies that each of the three frame types can have 
several different subtypes that perform various functions. The frame types and their 
most common subtypes are discussed in the following sections. 
 Management Frames 
 Management frames are used to advertise a BSS and to manage clients as they join or 
leave the BSS. A client must first locate a candidate BSS to join, authenticate itself to an 
AP, and associate itself with the BSS. Although there are 14 different management frame 
subtypes available, you should become familiar with just the following for the CCNA 
Wireless exam:  
  ■ 
 Beacon    —A frame that is broadcast by the AP to advertise the BSS, the data rates
necessary and allowed in the BSS, an optional security set identifier (SSID) string,
and vendor-specific information when necessary. Beacons are sent to any and all
devices in the BSA about ten times per second (100 ms intervals). If the AP supports
multiple SSIDs, a different beacon is broadcast for each SSID.
Key 
Topic

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  135
 A wireless device can learn about BSSs within range by listening to the beacons that are 
received. This is known as  passive scanning . 
  ■ 
 Probe    —A wireless device can send probe request frames to ask any APs within
range or a specific AP to provide information about their BSSs. An AP answers by
sending a probe response that contains most of the beacon information. Probing for
BSS information is known as  active scanning . 
  ■ 
 Authentication and deauthentication —To join a BSS, a wireless device must first
send an authentication request frame to an AP. The AP can support either  Open
System authentication , where any device is authenticated without any sort of
verification, or  shared key authentication , where a device must exchange a Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key that matches the key used by the AP. The AP sends
the result of the authentication in an authentication response frame.
 If a device wants to leave the authenticated state, it can send a deauthentication
frame to the AP. However, the AP can force a device out of the authenticated state
by sending it a deauthentication frame.
 Tip  It might seem odd that Open System and WEP are the only two authentication 
methods offered in authentication request frames, because both methods are known to 
be very weak. Wireless networks can offer robust authentication methods through a dif-
ferent method of frame exchanges. Those methods are covered in Part III, “Implementing 
Wireless LANs.” 
  ■ 
 Association, disassociation, and reassociation —Once a device is authenticated, it
can send an association request frame to the AP to ask permission to join the BSS. If
the device supports compatible parameters and is allowed to join, then the AP will
reply with an association response frame, along with a unique association identifier
(AID) for that client.
 If a device wants to gracefully leave a BSS, it can send a disassociation frame to the
AP. An AP can also decide to drop a client by sending it a disassociation frame.
 When a client wants to leave one BSS for another, while staying within the same
SSID, it can send a reassociation request frame to the new AP. In effect, the client
is attempting to reassociate with the SSID, not an AP. The new AP responds with a
reassociation response frame. (Moving from one BSS to another is covered in great-
er detail in  Chapter  12 , “Understanding Roaming.”) 
 Control Frames 
 Control frames are used to gain control of and to help deliver data over a channel. 
Control frames contain only frame header information and no data payload. There are 
nine different control frames possible. Be familiar with the following four: 

136  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
  ■ 
 ACK    —A short frame that is sent as an acknowledgment of a unicast frame that has
been received. 
  ■ 
 Block ACK    —A short frame that is sent as an acknowledgment of a burst of frames
send as a single block of data.
  ■ 
 PS-Poll    —The Power Save Poll frame is sent from a client to an AP to request the
next frame that was buffered while the client’s radio was powered down. 
  ■ 
 RTS/CTS    —Frames that are used to reserve a channel during 802.11g protected
mode, while a legacy 802.11b client is transmitting. RTS/CTS frames carry a
Duration value that reserves the channel airtime for the frame they are protecting.
RTS/CTS may also be used to help avoid collisions between clients that cannot hear
each other because of the distance between them. When clients cannot hear each
other, they also cannot hear the Duration values or detect a carrier to know when
to cease transmitting. As long as the clients can hear the AP when it sends RTS/CTS
frames, they can remain silent while  others are transmitting. 
 Data Frames 
 Data is sent to and from clients in data frames. A data frame contains up to four address 
fields that identify the sender and recipient and identify the BSSID and any wireless link 
involved with forwarding the frame. The 802.11 standard defines 15 different data frame 
subtypes, but you should just be aware of a generic data frame and its addressing mecha-
nism. 
 Client Housekeeping 
 Recall from  Chapter   1   , “RF Signals and Modulation,” that a client and an AP have to 
use the same modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to successfully communicate. The 
scheme can be changed dynamically, if needed, as long as both ends agree on the choice. 
The MCS directly affects the data rate between the client and the AP. 
 An AP is configured with a set of data rates that it can use. Each data rate can be set to 
one of the following states:  
  ■ 
 Disabled    —The AP will not use the data rate for any client communication.
  ■ 
 Supported    —The AP can use the data rate if a client also supports its use, but the
client is not required to support it. 
  ■ 
 Mandatory    —The AP can use the data rate and expects every client to support it.
This is also known as an 802.11  BSS basic rate . 
 At least one data rate must be mandatory to provide a common rate that can be used 
for management and control frames. In fact, the AP will always send broadcast manage-
ment frames using the lowest mandatory rate. The idea is to leverage a lower data rate to 
get better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and greater signal range to reliably manage client 
devices within the BSS.  

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  137
 Other data rates can be configured as supported. Normal data frames and unicast man-
agement frames will be sent at whatever supported rate is most optimal between the 
client and the AP. Acknowledgment frames are sent at the first mandatory rate that is 
below the current optimal data rate.  
 APs advertise their mandatory and supported data rates in each beacon frame so that 
potential clients can know what is available. By default, 802.11b/g/n radios are config-
ured with 1-, 2-, 5.5-, and 11-Mbps data rates as mandatory; 802.11a/n radios consider 6, 
12, and 24 Mbps to be mandatory.  
 Before a wireless device can join a BSS, it must announce its own set of mandatory and 
supported data rates in an association request frame. The AP compares the client’s list of 
data rates with its own. If the client can support all of the AP’s mandatory rates, the cli-
ent can take the next step to be associated with the BSS. 
 Wireless clients can be mobile and transient. The following sections describe how a wire-
less client and a BSS interact using management frames in a variety of common scenarios. 
 A Client Scans for APs 
 To join a BSS, a wireless device first has to scan its surroundings to look for any live APs 
that might offer network service. Beyond that, the device might need to build a list of 
SSIDs that are available. A device can scan the wireless horizon in two ways: 
  ■ 
 Passive scan    —The device simply listens for any beacon frames broadcast from
nearby APs. Passive scanning has a couple of drawbacks—a device must wait until
beacons are broadcast at the next interval, which might not be soon enough in a
time critical situation; beacons don’t always contain specific SSID names, so a device
cannot always depend on learning that a desired SSID exists on an AP.
 In  Figure   6-9   , Host-1 is able to receive beacons from AP-1 and AP-2. The beacon
frames specify the BSSIDs and SSIDs that are offered, as well as supported data
rates and other information about their BSSs.
  ■ 
 Active scan    —The device must take an active role and broadcast a probe request
frame to ask any APs within range to identify themselves. The device can include
a specific SSID name in the request. Any APs that receive the probe request must
send a unicast probe response frame back to the device.
 In  Figure   6-10   , a device broadcasts a probe request to look for any APs that can
offer the “guest” SSID. Both AP-1 and AP-2 receive the request and send probe
responses containing their BSSIDs and other information about the BSS and SSID.

 A Client Joins a BSS 
 Suppose a wireless device is not currently joined to a wireless network. The device 
comes within range of two different APs that form a single ESS and offer a common 
SSID. The device performs an active scan and discovers the two APs. Through some 
algorithm, it decides that AP-1 is more preferable than AP-2.  Figure  6-11 shows the steps 
that the device takes to join the network offered by AP-1.

 Step 1.

 Step 2. 
  If AP-1 is satisfied with the host’s identity, it sends an authentication 
response frame back to Host-1. 
 Step 3. 
  Now that Host-1 is known to the AP, it must ask for BSS membership by 
sending an association request frame to AP-1. Host-1 includes a list of its 
802.11 capabilities, the SSID it wants to join, a list of data rates and channels 
it supports, and any parameters that are needed to secure the wireless link to 
the AP. 
 Step 4. 
  If the AP is satisfied with the request, it sends an association response frame 
back to Host-1. 
 Step 5. 
  The response also contains the AID that uniquely identifies Host-1 as an 
associated client. In effect, the AID is Host-1’s membership card while it 
remains a part of the BSS.  
 A Client Leaves a BSS 
 Once a wireless device successfully becomes a client of a BSS, it keeps that relationship 
with the AP until something happens to remove it. For example, a wireless client might 
be removed if it violates a security policy, is recognized as a rogue device, has a session 
that stays idle for too long, and so on. 
Key 
Topic

140  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 A client can be removed from a BSS if the AP sends it a disassociation or a deauthentica-
tion frame. Once that happens, the device must start the whole association process over 
again. In  Figure   6-12   , Client-A has been forced to leave the BSS through either disasso-
ciation or deauthentication. 
 A client can gracefully remove itself from a BSS, when needed. To do this, the client 
simply notifies the AP by sending it a deauthentication frame. In  Figure  6-12 , Client-B 
has sent a deauthentication for itself to AP-1.

 What happens if a client physically leaves a BSS without informing the AP? For example, 
suppose Client-B in  Figure   6-12    reaches the edge of AP-1’s cell, but does not send a 
deauthentication frame? Once it goes outside the cell range, the AP might not even 
notice. Even before it leaves the cell, the client might just go into sleep mode and stop 
communicating with the AP altogether. In this case, the AP maintains the AID entry for 
the device, in case it returns to the cell or wakes up, but only for a certain amount of 
time. Cisco APs age out  unresponsive clients after 5 minutes. In case the client is still lis-
tening, the AP also sends a deauthentication frame to it. 
 A Client Moves Between BSSs 
 When a wireless client is within range of several APs, it must choose to associate with 
only one of them. A client can join only one BSS at any given time. If the client changes 
its location, it might stay within its original BSS or it might move out of range and into 
the cell of an adjacent BSS. Moving seamlessly from one BSS to another is called  
roaming . 
 The basic roaming process is not much different than finding and associating with a BSS, 
except that the client does this while it is actively associated with another BSS. To switch 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  141
BSSs seamlessly, the client must recognize that it is nearing the cell boundary and that it 
needs to find other potential cells to move into before losing the signal completely.  
  Figure   6-13    illustrates the basic steps of the roaming process.

 Figure 6-13  Roaming Between Two BSSs. 
 The wireless client begins with an active association with AP-1 using SSID “guest”: 
 Step 1. 
  Client-1 notices that the signal from AP-1 is degrading. Based on various con-
ditions like the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and SNR, the client 
will decide that it needs to roam.  
 Step 2. 
  Client-1 begins to search for a successor BSS to move into. It broadcasts a 
probe request frame to look for nearby APs that can offer the same “guest” 
SSID. 
 Step 3. 
  AP-2 receives the probe request and returns a probe response, advertising its 
BSSID and the “guest” SSID. Other APs may also hear the request and send 
probe responses of their own. 
Key 
Topic

142  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Step 4. 
  Client-1 must decide which AP is the best candidate out of all probe respons-
es that are received. It then sends a reassociation request frame to the new 
AP, asking to transfer its ESS membership from AP-1’s BSS to AP-2. 
 Step 5. 
  AP-2 communicates with AP-1 over the wired DS network to begin the client 
handoff. Client-1’s association will be moved from AP-1 to AP-2. Any frames 
that are destined for the client during the handoff will be buffered on AP-1, 
then relayed to AP-2 and transmitted to the client.  
 Step 6. 
  If the reassociation is accepted, AP-2 will inform the client with a reassocia-
tion response frame. 
 A Client Saves Power 
 Wireless devices are commonly small in size and powered by batteries. Because the 
devices are mobile and carried around, it is not very practical to stop and charge the bat-
teries. To maximize the battery life, the device should conserve as much power as pos-
sible. 
 By default, the radio (both transmitter and receiver) is powered on all the time, so that 
the device is always ready to send and receive data. That might be good for perfor-
mance, but applies a constant drain on the battery. Fortunately, the 802.11 standard 
defines some methods to save power by putting the radio to sleep when it is not needed. 
 Tip  Be aware that a device’s radio sleeping is different than the whole device sleep-
ing, as when you close the lid on a laptop. While a radio is sleeping, its transmitter and 
receiver are powered down for a short amount of time and cannot send or receive wire-
less frames. In contrast, when a laptop is sleeping, most of its functions are paused for a 
long period of time. While asleep, a laptop can become disassociated from the AP; when 
it wakes, it must probe and associate again.   The “legacy” method was defined in the origi-
nal 802.11 standard and is described by  Figure  6-14 and the following sequence of steps. 
(For simplicity, the ACK frames that acknowledge each frame have been omitted.)  
 In a nutshell, the method works by letting the client’s radio power down and go to sleep 
while the AP stores up any frames that are destined for the client. The client’s radio must 
periodically wake up and fetch any buffered frames from the AP: 
 Step 1. 
  The client informs the AP that it is entering power save mode by setting the 
Power Management bit in the Frame Control field of the frame header (refer 
to  Figure  6-3 ). 
 Step 2. 
  The client shifts its wireless radio into a very low power or “sleep” mode. 
 Step 3. 
  The AP begins to buffer any unicast frames that are destined for the client 
while it is in power save mode. 
 Step 4. 
  To check for any potentially buffered frames, the client’s radio must wake up 
in time to receive a beacon frame. 

Chapter 6: Understanding 802.11 Frame Types  143
 Step 5. 
  The beacon can contain a  traffic indication map (TIM), or a list of AID 
entries for clients that have buffered frames. The client, known as AID 7, has 
frames available and is listed in the TIM. 
 Step 6. 
  The client can begin to retrieve its buffered frames one by one. To do so, it 
must send a PS-Poll management frame to the AP. 
 Step 7. 
  The AP sends the next buffered frame to the client, along with a flag that 
indicates more buffered frames are available.  
 Step 8. 
  The client and AP continue the exchange in Steps 6 and 7 until no more 
frames are available in the buffer. 
 Broadcast and multicast frames become special cases for clients that have radios in 
power save mode. Such frames are not destined for any specific client; rather, they are 
destined for mass delivery. Sleeping radios will miss the frames unless the AP somehow 
intervenes. 
 An AP can also buffer broadcast and multicast frames and deliver them at regular inter-
vals. The  delivery traffic indication message (DTIM) is a beacon that is sent at some 
multiple of regular beacon periods. The DTIM period is advertised in every beacon so 
that all clients know to wake up their radios in time to receive the next DTIM. At that 
time, the DTIM is sent, followed by any buffered broadcast and multicast frames.  
 The legacy TIM and DTIM schemes have one drawback—they are AP-centric. Even 
though a client needs to conserve its battery power, it is the AP that dictates when and 
how often the client’s radio should wake up and consume more power. 
 Ideally, a client should have more control over its own power consumption. The 802.11e 
amendment, certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and known as  Wireless Multimedia

(WMM), introduced a new quality of service (QoS) mechanism along with a new and 
improved power save mode that is more client-centric.  
 Traffic to and from a wireless client can be handled according to four different catego-
ries, in order of decreasing time critical delivery: voice, video, best effort, and back-
ground. While a client is in a power save mode, the AP buffers its frames in four queues 
that correspond to the QoS categories. When the client is ready to wake its radio up, it 
sends a frame marked for one of the queues. The AP responds by sending the buffered 
frames in that queue to the client in a burst.  
 This method is known as  unscheduled automatic power save delivery (U-APSD), and 
must be supported on both the client and the AP. The client does not have to request

 Step 1. 
  The client informs the AP that it is entering power save mode by setting the 
Power Management bit in a frame. 
 Step 2. 
  The client puts its radio into power down or sleep mode. 
 Step 3. 
  The AP buffers any frames destined for the client in the appropriate QoS 
queues.  
 Step 4. 
  The client decides to wake its radio. 
 Step 5. 
  The client is ready to receive any buffered frames from the “voice” queue, so 
it marks a frame as voice and signals the AP that it is awake. 
 Step 6. 
  The AP sends the frames it has buffered in the voice queue in a burst.

Topic

    This chapter covers the following topics: 
  ■ 
 AP Cell Size —This section discusses how the size
of a wireless cell affects things like coverage area,
performance, and efficiency. 
  ■ 
 Adding APs to an ESS —This section covers the 
process of growing an extended service set, with an
emphasis on client roaming and proper layout of
wireless channels over an area. 
 This chapter covers the following exam topics: 
  ■ 
  Describe basic RF deployment considerations
related to site survey design of data or VoWLAN
applications; common RF interference sources such
as devices, building material, AP location; and basic
RF site survey design related to channel reuse, signal
strength, and cell overlap 

 Chapters  1 through  6 covered wireless communication with a focus on a single access 
point (AP) exchanging data with one or more clients. A single AP may be sufficient for 
home or small office use, but most wireless LANs involve a greater geographic area and 
require more APs. This chapter explains how wireless coverage can be adjusted to meet 
a need and how it can be grown to scale over a greater area and a greater number of cli-
ents. As you work through this chapter, remember that two things are important: the size 
of the BSA or AP cell and the location  of cells in relation to each other.

 AP Cell Size 
 The basic service area (BSA) or cell that is provided by an AP can vary, depending on 
several factors. Obviously, the cell size determines the geographic area where wireless 
service will be offered. AP cell size can also affect the performance of the APs as clients 
move around or gather in one place.  
 Remember that a wireless LAN is a shared medium. Within a single AP cell, all of the cli-
ents associated with that AP must share the bandwidth and contend for access. If the cell 
is large, a large number of clients could potentially gather and use that AP. If the cell size 
is reduced, the number of simultaneous clients can also be reduced.  
 The signal from an AP does not simply stop at the boundary of its cell. Instead, the 
signal continues to expand ad infinitum, growing exponentially weaker. Devices inside 
the cell boundary can communicate with the AP. Devices outside the boundary cannot 
because the signal strength of either the client or the AP is too weak for the pair to find 
any usable modulation that can be used to exchange information. You can control the 
size of a cell by changing the parameters that are described in the following sections. 
 Tuning Cell Size with Transmit Power 
 To use a wireless LAN, devices must be located within the range of an AP’s signal and 
have an active association with the AP. This area is known as the BSA or cell. Consider 
the scenario shown in  Figure   7-1   . PCs 1 through 4 are within the cell’s perimeter and are 
associated with the AP. PC-5, however, is outside the cell and cannot form an associa-
tion or participate in the basic service set (BSS).

Chapter 7: Planning Coverage with Wireless APs  151
 If the area outside a cell is a legitimate location where wireless devices might be present, 
the coverage area should probably be extended there. How can that be accomplished? 
The most straightforward approach is to increase the transmit power or signal strength 
leaving the AP’s antenna. A greater signal strength will overcome some of the free space 
path loss so that the usable signal reaches farther away from the AP. 
 Figure   7-2    shows the effect of changing the AP’s transmit power level. The original cell 
from  Figure   7-1    is shown as the second concentric circle, where the transmit power level 
was set to 17 dBm. If the level is increased to 20 dBm, the cell grows into the area shown 
by the outermost circle. Notice that PC-5 now falls within the cell boundary. If the 
transmit power level is decreased to 10 dBm, the cell shrinks and includes only clients 
PC-2 and PC-3. Why would you ever want to decrease a cell’s size? That question will be 
answered later in this section.

 Figure 7-2  The Effects of the Transmit Power Level on Cell Size. 
 How should you decide on a transmit power level value? Cisco APs offer eight differ-
ent values for their 2.4-GHz radios and seven values for their 5-GHz radios. Most 802.11 
scenarios fall within government regulations which limit the effective isotropic radiated 
power (EIRP) to a maximum transmit power level of 20 dBm (100 mW). You could just 
configure an AP to run wide open at maximum power, but that is not always appropriate 
or beneficial.  
 One thing to consider is the two-way nature of wireless communications. By increasing 
the AP’s transmit power, the AP might reach a distant client, but can the client’s own 
signal reach the AP? Notice client PC-5 in  Figure  7-3 . If the AP transmit power level is 
increased to 20 dBm (the outermost circle), PC-5 is included in the cell. However, PC-5’s 
wireless transmitter has a lesser power level; in its current location, PC-5 has a cover-
age area that falls short of including the AP. This scenario is known as the  asymmetric 
power  problem, where the two communicating devices have differing transmit power 
levels that might not reach each other.

 Tuning Cell Size with Data Rates 
 Setting the transmit power level is a simplistic approach to defining the cell size, but 
that is not the only variable involved. The cell size of an AP is actually a compromise 
between its transmit power and the data rates that it offers. 
 Recall from  Chapters   1    and    3    that the higher data rates or more complex modulation and 
coding schemes (MCS) offer the greatest throughput but require the best signal condi-
tions—usually closer to the AP. The less complex schemes can work further away from 
an AP, but offer slower data rates. Therefore, at the perimeter of a cell, a client is likely 
to be using the least complex MCS and the lowest data rate.  Figure   7-4    shows a simpli-
fied representation of the range of each data rate with concentric circles. At the outer 
edge of the cell, a client will probably resort to a 1-Mbps  data rate.    
 To design a wireless LAN for best performance, you would most likely need to disable 
some of the lower data rates. For example, you could disable the 1-, 2-, and 5.5-Mbps 
rates to force clients to use higher rates and better modulation and coding schemes. That 
would improve throughput for individual clients and would also benefit the BSS as a 
whole by eliminating the slower rates that use more time on a channel.  
 As you disable lower data rates, the respective concentric circles in  Figure   7-4  become 
irrelevant. This effectively  reduces  the usable size of the AP’s cell, even though the radio 
frequency (RF) footprint remains the same. After all, you haven’t reduced the transmit 
power level which would reduce the extent of the RF energy. Be aware that as smaller 
usable cells are placed closer together, their available data rates are higher. At the same 
time, their RF footprints can remain large and overlap each other, resulting in a higher 
noise floor.  

Chapter 7: Planning Coverage with Wireless APs  153
 To provide robust wireless coverage to an ever-increasing area, you should use the fol-
lowing two-pronged approach: 
  ■ 
  Tune the cell size based on data rates and performance.
  ■ 
  Add additional APs to build an ESS that covers more area.
 Adding APs requires careful consideration for client mobility and the use of wireless 
channels. These topics are covered in the next section.  
 Adding APs to an ESS 
 If a client is associated with an AP, it can maintain the association as long as it stays 
within range of the AP. Consider the cell shown in  Figure  7-5 . As long as the client stays 
within points A and B, three conditions are met: 
  ■ 
  The client is able to receive the AP’s signal at an acceptable level.
  ■ 
  The AP is able to receive the client’s signal.
  ■ 
  One of the acceptable modulations can be successfully used between the client and
the AP.

 As soon as the client goes outside the cell range at point C, one or more of the condi-
tions fails and the client loses the association. In the figure, the AP’s signal has fallen

 Figure 7-5  A Mobile Client Moves Within an AP Cell. 
 Other APs can be added so that the client can move within a larger area; however, the 
APs must be carefully deployed to allow the client to roam from AP to AP.  Roaming is 
the process of moving an association from one AP to the next, so that the wireless con-
nection is maintained as the client moves.  
 In  Figure   7-6 , a new AP has been added alongside AP-1, each using the same channel. 
It might seem intuitive to build a larger coverage area by using a single channel. Usually 
this turns out to be a bad idea because the client may experience an excessive amount of 
frame collisions in the area between the two cells.   
 Remember that the signal from an AP does not actually stop at the edge of the cell; rath-
er, it continues to propagate as it eventually dies off. This is shown by the signal strength 
graph of each AP. The client is able to form an association with AP-1 at point A. Even 
at that location, some portion of AP-2’s signal can be received, albeit at a lower level. 
Because AP-2 is using the same channel as AP-1, the two APs (and any clients within 
range) can essentially interfere with each other through co-channel interference.  

Chapter 7: Planning Coverage with Wireless APs  155
 Ideally, when the client in  Figure   7-6    moves to location B, it should begin to anticipate 
the need to roam or transfer its association from AP-1 to AP-2. Notice that AP-1 and 
AP-2 are spaced appropriately for roaming, where their cells have some overlap. The 
two APs are out of range of each other, so they are not aware of each other’s transmis-
sions on the same channel. Each AP will coordinate the use of the channel with devices 
that are inside its own cell, but not with the other AP and devices in the other cell. As a 
result, the client  around location B will probably experience so many collisions that it 
may never be able to roam cleanly.  
 The Roaming Process 
 What enables a client to roam in the first place? First, adjacent APs  should be config-
ured to use different non-overlapping channels. For example, an AP using channel 1 
must not be adjacent to other APs also using channel 1. Instead, a neighboring AP should 
use channel 6 or higher to avoid any frequency overlap with channel 1. This ensures that 
clients will be able to receive signals from a nearby AP without interference from other 
APs. As you learned in  Chapter   2   , “RF Standards,” the 5-GHz band is much more flex-
ible in this regard because it has many more non-overlapping channels available.

156  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 The roaming process is driven entirely by the wireless client driver—not by the AP. 
Wireless clients decide that it is time to roam based on a variety of conditions. The 
802.11 standard does not address this at all, so roaming algorithms are vendor specific. 
In addition, the roaming algorithms are usually “secret recipes,” so the exact thresholds 
and conditions are hidden from view.  
 Some of the ingredients in the roaming algorithm are the received signal strength indica-
tor (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a count of missed AP beacons, errors due to colli-
sions or interference, and so on. These are usually logical choices because they indicate 
an inferior connection.  
 Because different clients use different thresholds, some will try to roam earlier than oth-
ers at a given location within a cell. Some clients will tend to “latch on” to an existing 
association until the AP can hardly be heard, whereas others will attempt to roam when-
ever a better AP is discovered.  
 Figure  7-7    depicts a clean roam between two APs that have been correctly configured 
with non-overlapping channels 1 and 6. The two AP signal strengths are also shown as a 
graph corresponding to the client’s location. At location A, the client has a clear signal 
from AP-1, so it maintains an association with that AP.

 As the client moves toward location B, it decides that AP-1’s signal is no longer opti-
mal. Somewhere along the way, the client begins to gather more information about any 
neighboring AP cells. The client can passively scan by tuning its radio to another channel 
and listening for beacons transmitted from other APs. During the time that the radio is 
tuned away from the associated channel, the client might lose packets that have been 
sent to it. A client might use active scanning instead, where it sends probe requests to 
seek out a better AP where it can move its association. The client does not know what 
channel is used on the next AP it encounters, so it must send the probes over every pos-
sible channel. Again, the client must take time to tune its radio away from the current 
AP’s channel so it can scan other channels and send probes.  
 You might think of this as someone watching television. As the current program gets 
boring or nears its end, the viewer begins to “channel surf” and scans other channels for 
a better program. One thing to keep in mind: While the viewer is scanning channels, he 
cannot keep watching the original program. Some of that program will be missed. This is 
also true of wireless clients. While a radio is scanning other channels, packets arriving on 
the original channel will be dropped because they cannot be received. Therefore, there 
is a trade-off between staying available on a single channel and attempting to roam to 
other APs.  
 After the client is satisfied with all of the beacons or probe responses it receives, it eval-
uates them to see which AP offers the most potential for a new association. Returning 
to  Figure   7-7   , when the client nears location B, it receives a probe response from AP-2 
on channel 6. At location C, the client sends a reassociation frame to AP-2 and moves its 
association to that BSS.  
 How much should cells overlap each other to promote good roaming? Cisco recom-
mends 15 percent to 20 percent overlap for most applications. The idea is to give a client 
device some continued coverage even after the RSSI of its associated AP falls below a 
threshold and a roam might be triggered. The client can probe and reassociate with the 
next AP before it completely loses contact with the previous AP. Seamless roaming is 
especially important for time critical applications like voice traffic.  
 WLAN Channel Layout 
 The previous section laid the foundation for roaming by describing movement between 
two AP cells. Most scenarios require more than two APs to cover the appropriate area 
within a building. Therefore, you need to consider the layout and configuration of more 
and more APs to scale the design to fit your wireless environment.  
 For example, to cover the entire area of a warehouse or one floor of a building, APs 
must be placed at regular intervals throughout that space. A site survey is a vital step 
toward deciding on AP placement, as actual live measurements are taken with an AP 
staged at various points in the actual space. This method also takes any factors like free 
space loss and absorption into account, as the signal strength is measured within the 
actual environment where clients are located. 
 To minimize channel overlap and interference, APs cells should be designed so that adja-
cent APs use different channels. For simplicity and a convenient design constraint, the 

158  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
examples in this section use the three non-overlapping 2.4-GHz channels. The cells could 
be laid out in a regular, alternating pattern, as shown in  Figure   7-8   .

 Figure 7-8  Holes in an Alternating Channel Pattern. 
 However, notice what is happening in the center where the cells meet; there is a small 
hole in RF coverage. If a client roams through that hole, his wireless signal could drop 
completely. In addition, if the cells were brought closer together to close this hole, the 
two cells using channel 1 would overlap and begin interfering with each other. 
 Instead, you should lay the cells out in a “honeycomb” fashion, as shown in  Figure  7-9 . 
This pattern is seamless, leaving no holes in coverage. In addition, notice how the two 
cells using channel 1 are well separated, providing isolation from interference. As far as 
ordering channels in the pattern, there are several different variations using combinations 
of the three channels, but the result is basically the same.  
 Notice that as the client shown in the channel 1 cell moves around, it will roam into adja-
cent cells on different channels. For roaming to work properly, a client must be able to 
move from one channel into a completely different channel. 
 Alternating channels to avoid overlap is commonly called  channel reuse . The basic 
pattern shown in  Figure   7-9    can be repeated to expand over a larger area, as shown in 
 Figure  7-10   . Naturally, this ideal layout uses perfect circles that are positioned regularly 
across the building. In practice, cells can take on different shapes and the AP locations 
may end up being irregularly spaced.   

Chapter 7: Planning Coverage with Wireless APs  159
 So far, only the channel layout of a two-dimensional area has been discussed. For exam-
ple,  Figure   7-10    might represent only one floor of a building. What happens when you 
need to design a wireless LAN for multiple floors in the same building? 
 Recall that an RF signal propagating from an antenna actually takes on a three-dimen-
sional shape. With an omnidirectional antenna, the pattern is somewhat like a donut 
shape with the antenna at the center. The signal extends outward, giving the cell a cir-
cular shape along the floor. The signal also extends upward and downward to a lesser 
extent—affecting AP cells on adjacent floors as well.  
 Consider the building with three floors shown in  Figure  7-11 . The same two-dimensional 
channel layout from  Figure   7-10    is being used on the first floor. The floors in the figure 
are shown greatly separated, so that you can see the channel patterns and numbers. In 
reality, the cells on adjacent floors would touch or overlap, just as adjacent cells on the 
same floor do.

 Figure 7-10  Channel Reuse Over a Large Area. 

Chapter 7: Planning Coverage with Wireless APs  161
 The pattern of alternating channels exists within the plane of a floor and between floors. 
Channel 1 on the first floor should not overlap with channel 1 directly above it on the 
second floor or below it in the basement.  
 When you consider each of the tasks involved in designing and maintaining a wireless 
LAN, it can really become a puzzle to solve. The cell size, transmit power, and channel 
assignment all have to be coordinated for each and every AP. Roaming also becomes an 
issue on a large scale, if mobile clients can move throughout an entire campus wireless 
network. 
 The good news is that  Chapter   13   , “Understanding RRM,” explains how to solve many 
of these puzzles automatically.

 Foundation Topics 
 Autonomous Architecture 
 An AP’s primary function is to bridge wireless data from the air to a normal wired net-
work. An AP can accept “connections” from a number of wireless clients so that they 
become members of the LAN, as if the same clients were using wired connections.  
 APs act as the central point of access (hence the AP name), controlling client access to 
the wireless LAN. An  autonomous AP  is self-contained; it is equipped with both wired 
and wireless hardware so that the wireless client associations can be terminated onto a 
wired connection locally at the AP.  
 Autonomous APs are commonly used in small networks, such as a small office or a 
remote site. Because the APs are self-contained and self-sufficient, they are fairly easy 
to set up and configure. The end result is a decentralized, distributed architecture, where 
each wireless AP touches the wired network independently. Each AP is configured and 
managed independently too, which can lead to a management nightmare as the number 
of APs grows. 
 You can think of an AP as a translational bridge, where frames from two dissimilar 
media are translated and then bridged at Layer 2. In simple terms, the AP is in charge of 
mapping a service set identifier (SSID) to a VLAN, or in 802.11 terms, mapping a basic 
service set (BSS) to a distribution system (DS). This is shown in  Figure  8-1 , where the AP 
connects a client that is associated to the SSID “Marketing” with the wired network on 
VLAN 10. On the wired side, the AP’s Ethernet port is connected to a switch port con-
figured for access  mode and mapped to VLAN 10.

 Figure 8-1  Bridging an SSID to a VLAN. 
 This concept can be extended so that multiple VLANs are mapped to multiple SSIDs. To 
do this, the AP must be connected to the switch by a trunk link that carries the VLANs. 
In  Figure   8-2   , VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are both trunked to the AP. The AP uses the 
802.1Q tag to map the VLAN numbers to SSIDs. For example, VLAN 10 is mapped to 
SSID “Marketing,” while VLAN 20 is mapped to SSID “Engineering.”  
 In effect, when an AP uses multiple SSIDs, it is trunking VLANs over the air to wireless 
clients. In the 802.11 space, the VLAN tag is replaced by the SSID. The autonomous 
AP then becomes an extension of an access layer switch because it bridges SSIDs and 
VLANs right at the access layer.   

Chapter 8: Using Autonomous APs  167
 Configuring an Autonomous AP 
 As a wireless engineer, you will likely have to install and configure an autonomous AP. 
Many Cisco APs can operate in autonomous mode by running an IOS image—much 
like many other Cisco products. You can configure an AP through any of the following 
methods: 
  ■ 
  A terminal emulator connected to the AP’s console port
  ■ 
  Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) to the AP’s IP address
  ■ 
  Use a web browser to access a graphical user interface (GUI) at the AP’s IP address
 As you read through this chapter, think about the different parameters you might have 
to configure on an autonomous AP. At a minimum, you would have to configure one or 
more SSIDs and some wireless security settings. In addition, you would have to set the 
transmit power level and channel number for each of the AP’s radios. Now think about 
your wireless network as it grows—manually configuring a handful of autonomous APs 
might not be difficult, but working out the channel reuse layout for 50 or 100 APs in 
the same building might become a nightmare. Fortunately, you can leverage a centralized 
architecture to automate many configuration functions. Such architecture is covered in 
more detail in  Chapters  9 through  13 . 
 Connecting the AP 
 Figure   8-3    shows the ports that are available on a typical access point. You should con-
nect the Ethernet port to a switch port where the DS is located. The console port can 
remain disconnected unless you need to use it. A sticker on the AP provides the model 
and serial numbers, as well as the Ethernet port’s MAC address. 
 By default, an AP will try to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to 
request an IP address for itself. If it is successful, you can connect to it and interact with 
its GUI or command-line interface (CLI). If not, the AP will use the static IP address 
10.0.0.1/26. You can also use the console port to configure a static IP address on the 
BVI1 interface of the AP, but it is usually more flexible and convenient to let it request 
an address on its own.

 The AP’s IP address will not be readily visible because the AP has no way to display it, 
other than through its user interface and configuration. To find the IP address, you can 
query the DHCP server that assigned it and look for the AP’s MAC address.  
 Suppose that an AP has MAC address 00:22:bd:19:28:dd. From the output listed in 
 Example   8-1   , the MAC address is bound to IP address 192.168.199.44.

 You can also use the IP Setup Utility (IPSU), a Cisco tool that is available on Cisco.com. 
The tool has a simple interface, as shown in  Figure  8-4 —you provide the Ethernet MAC 
address of an AP, click the  Get Address button, and the tool returns the AP’s IP address. 
 An autonomous AP binds the IP address to its bridged-virtual interface (BVI), which is a 
logical interface used to bridge the physical wired and wireless interfaces. If you are con-
nected to the AP’s console port, you can display the IP address with the  show interface 
bvi1 command, as shown in  Example  8-3 .

 Configuring the AP 
 By default, any autonomous AP running IOS Release 12.3(4)JA or later has its radios dis-
abled and does not have any SSIDs configured. This is done to prevent the new AP from 
interfering with any existing signals before you have a chance to configure it. This also 
prevents anyone from inadvertently discovering a wireless signal coming from the AP 
before you can secure it. 
 Perhaps the easiest method you can use to configure an autonomous AP is to use its web 
interface. Once you know the AP’s IP address, you can open a web browser to it. By 
default, you can leave the username blank and enter the password as Cisco. The home 
page, as shown in  Figure   8-5   , displays a summary of associated clients, the AP’s Ethernet 
and radio interfaces, and an event log. 
 At the CCNA Wireless level, Cisco expects candidates to be able to perform basic con-
figuration tasks on autonomous APs. Therefore, you should be familiar with only the 
Express Setup and Express Security tabs at the upper-left corner of the web page. 
 To use the Express Setup tab, as shown in  Figure  8-6 , you need to enter the following 
information about the AP:

 You will also need to set some parameters for the 2.4- and 5-GHz radios. By default, 
each radio is configured to operate in the access point mode, so that the AP maintains an 
active BSS. You can select one of the following roles instead:  
  ■ 
 Repeater    —The AP will associate with another nearby AP automatically, to repeat
or extend that AP’s cell coverage. The Ethernet port will be disabled. 
  ■ 
 Root Bridge    —The AP uses its Ethernet port to connect to bridge the wired network
to a remote wireless bridge over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link. No
wireless clients will be allowed to associate. 
  ■ 
 Non-Root Bridge    —The AP will act as a remote wireless bridge and will connect to a
root bridge AP over a wireless link.
  ■ 
 Workgroup Bridge    —The AP will use one radio to associate with a nearby Cisco
access point, as if it is a wireless client. The other radio interface is disabled. The AP
bridges between its radio and its Ethernet port. You can use an AP in workgroup
bridge (WGB) mode to provide wireless client capability to wired-only devices. 
  ■ 
 Universal Workgroup Bridge    —The AP will act as a workgroup bridge to associate
with Cisco and non-Cisco access points.

 In the Optimize Radio Network For section, you can select how the AP will optimize 
its cell for wireless clients. By default, the AP will offer data rates that can provide good 
range and throughput. You can select  Throughput to leverage higher data rates at the 
expense of cell range,  Range  to require the lowest data rate for maximum cell range, or 
 Custom to set your own radio parameters. 
 Aironet Extensions are Cisco proprietary information elements that Cisco APs can use to 
interact with Cisco-compatible wireless clients. For example, an AP can provide informa-
tion about its current client load so that potential clients can choose the least busy AP. 
Aironet extensions are enabled by default.  
 You can use the Express Security tab to define an initial SSID. Be aware that the SSID 
will be available on both 2.4- and 5-GHz radios. If the AP is connected to a switch with 
an 802.1Q trunk link, you can bind the SSID to a VLAN number. You can also define 
a wireless security method for the SSID.  Figure  8-7 shows the Express Security page. If 
you intend to define multiple SSIDs and VLANs, you will have to drill down into some 
of the other tabs on the web page.  
 Tip     Although the CCNA Wireless exam is limited to the “express” configuration tabs on 
an autonomous AP, you will need to be proficient with many more complex features on 
lightweight APs as part of a larger, unified wireless network. Don’t worry; lightweight APs 
(LAPs) and unified networks are covered in detail throughout the remainder of the book.

 At this point of the configuration, you do not necessarily have a functional AP because 
the radios are still disabled. To enable a radio, navigate to the AP’s home page and select 
 Radio0-802.11N 2.4GHz or  Radio1-802.11N 5GHz in the Network Interfaces section.

 Converting an Autonomous AP 
 Autonomous APs can be useful in remote sites, small offices, or homes where central-
ized management is not necessary or practical. In larger environments, a centralized or 
unified approach is more common. Sometimes you might face a hybrid scenario, where 
some legacy autonomous APs still exist in a centrally managed network. In that case, you 
might need to either replace the AP hardware or convert its software image so that it can 
join the wireless controllers that manage the network. In fact, Cisco expects a CCNA 
Wireless engineer to know how to convert an autonomous AP to a “lightweight” version 
that can join a controller.  
 To convert an AP, you can use one of the following methods, which are described in the 
subsequent sections:  
  ■ 
 Use the Cisco Prime Infrastructure application; all wireless controllers and
lightweight APs can be monitored and managed from this one application. The
autonomous AP must first be managed, then it can be converted. Cisco Prime
Infrastructure is covered in Part V, “Managing Wireless LANs with WCS,” but using
it to convert autonomous APs is not covered on the CCNA Wireless exam. 
  ■ 
 Use the Autonomous to Lightweight Mode Upgrade tool, which you can download
from Cisco.com. 
  ■ 
 Use the  archive  command from the autonomous AP’s CLI.
 Using the Autonomous to Lightweight Mode Upgrade Tool 
 You can use the Autonomous to Lightweight Mode Upgrade tool to upgrade the IOS 
image so that an AP is converted from autonomous to lightweight mode. The tool only 
works with Cisco Aironet 1100, 1130, 1200, 1240, and 1310 models; all other models 
require a manual upgrade using the  archive command. 
 First, download the upgrade tool from Cisco.com. Be aware that the upgrade tool is 
known by several different names. You might also see it called the Cisco Aironet AP 
to LWAPP Upgrade tool. To find the software, navigate to  Support > Download > 
Wireless Software > Access Points , and then select a specific AP model. Once the 
upgrade tool is downloaded, install it on a Windows PC. 
 You will also need to download a lightweight recovery software image for the AP 
model. After downloading the upgrade tool, click the  Lightweight AP IOS Software 
link. The recovery image filename usually includes rcv (as in the word  recover ) in the 
filename, as in c1140-rcvk9w8-tar.152-2.JB.tar. The recovery image is a small bootstrap 
version of lightweight code that allows the AP to boot up and find a wireless controller. 
From there, the AP will automatically download a full version of lightweight code from 
the controller that it will use long term.  
 The upgrade tool looks in a text file to find a list of autonomous APs to upgrade. 
Therefore, you must prepare the text file ahead of time. Use a text editor such as 
Notepad to make a list of APs, one per line, with the following format: 

Chapter 8: Using Autonomous APs  175
 ap-ip-address ,  telnet-username ,  telnet-Password ,  enable-password 
 Figure   8-9    shows a text file created in Notepad with a single entry for an autonomous 
AP with the default settings.  
 Figure 8-9  Text File Containing One Autonomous AP for Upgrade. 
 Figure  8-10 shows the upgrade tool. 
 Figure 8-10  The Cisco Autonomous to Lightweight Mode AP Upgrade Tool. 
 Use the following steps to upgrade an autonomous AP to lightweight mode: 
 Step 1. 
  Open the Upgrade tool. If the tool complains that it is unable to start the 
Cisco TFTP server, exit the application. Right-click over the Upgrade tool’s 
icon and select  Run as Administrator . This will enable the tool to run its own 
TFTP server for downloading an image file to the AP.  
Key 
Topic

176  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Step 2. 
  In the IP File field, click the  ... button and browse to find the file containing 
the list of AP IP addresses. Click  Open . 
 Step 3. 
  Select the appropriate functions under Upgrade Options. Are the APs being 
upgraded over a slow WAN link? Should the AP be converted to use DHCP 
after the upgrade? Should the APs keep their existing hostname after the 
upgrade? 
 Step 4. 
  In the LWAPP Recovery Image section, choose whether the TFTP server 
is internal (integrated into the Upgrade tool) or external. Then select the 
LWAPP recovery image that will be downloaded to the AP. Choose how 
many APs can upgrade at once in the Max AP at Run field. 
 Step 5. 
  The Controller Details section is optional; fill in a controller’s IP address, 
username, and password, if you want to preconfigure the AP with a specific 
controller to use. Otherwise, the AP will go through a discovery process to 
find a controller.   
 Step 6. 
  In the Time Details section, select the method the AP will use to set its clock. 
The AP can set its clock according to the controller or a date and time that 
you specify.  
 Step 7. 
  If resolving by DNS, enter the DNS address and domain name. Optionally, 
change the logging level if you want to see more verbose information.  
 Step 8. 
 Click the  Start  button to begin the process. 
 The upgrade process verifies each parameter you have entered and errors out if incon-
sistencies are noted. After the conversion, the AP reboots. After the reboot, the AP 
behaves like any lightweight AP and tries to find a controller. 
 Note  During the upgrade process on an older AP, a self-signed certificate is gener-
ated if the AP doesn’t have a Cisco signed certificate. If you specify a controller in the 
Upgrade tool, the certificate will be imported into the controller. Otherwise, the Upgrade 
tool generates a text file that contains the certificate information. You can import that 
file into the controller manually. 
 Converting an Autonomous AP Manually 
 You can use the CLI to upgrade the IOS image on an autonomous AP and convert it to 
lightweight mode. You will also need a TFTP server along with the appropriate light-
weight code image. The process is simple—save the AP’s configuration, then use the fol-
lowing command: 
archive download-sw /overwrite /force-reload { tftp:|ftp:}//location/
image-name

Chapter 8: Using Autonomous APs  177
 The lightweight image will be downloaded such that it overwrites the current autono-
mous IOS image, then the AP will reload and run the new image.  Example  8-4 demon-
strates the conversion process. The TFTP server is located at 192.168.199.24, and the 
new lightweight image is named c1140-k9w8-tar.152-2.JB.tar.  
 Tip  Cisco AP image filenames can be difficult to identify. If a filename contains k9w8, 
as in  Example   8-4   , it is a lightweight image. If it contains k9w7, it is an autonomous 
image.

  ■ 
 A Distributed Architecture —This section discusses 
a wireless network formed by autonomous access
points. 
  ■ 
 A Centralized Architecture —This section describes 
a wireless network built from lightweight access
points and a centralized wireless LAN controller.
  ■ 
 CUWN Building Blocks —This section covers the 
devices that are necessary to build a Cisco Unified

 This chapter covers the following exam topics: 
  ■ 
  Identify the components of the Cisco Unified
Wireless Network architecture (Split MAC,
LWAPP, stand-alone AP vs controller-based AP,
specific hardware examples)
  ■ 
  Describe the modes of controller-based AP deploy-
ment (local, monitor, HREAP, sniffer, rogue detec-
tor, bridge, OEAP, and SE-Connect) 

 In  Chapter   8   , “Using Autonomous APs,” you learned about autonomous access points 
(APs) and their distributed nature. The Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) takes 
the opposite approach by keeping the radios distributed but collapsing wireless services 
into the core of the switched network. In this chapter, you will learn more about the 
centralized or unified wireless architecture and how you can leverage its strengths to 
solve some fundamental problems.

 A Distributed Architecture 
 Autonomous APs are self-contained, each offering one or more fully functional, stand-
alone basic service sets (BSSs). They are also a natural extension of a switched network, 
connecting wireless SSIDs to wired VLANs at the access layer.  Figure  9-1 shows the 
basic architecture; even though only four APs are shown, a typical enterprise network 
could consist of hundreds or thousands of APs. 
Autonomous

 Figure 9-1  Wireless Network Architecture with Autonomous APs. 
 Recall that an autonomous AP needs quite a bit of configuration and management. 
To help manage more and more autonomous APs as the wireless network grows, you 
could place an AP management device in a central location, as illustrated in  Figure  9-2 . 
The device could push out code upgrades and configuration changes to the APs in a 
bulk fashion, to streamline AP management. With added intelligence, the device could 
instruct each AP on which channel and transmit power level to use. It could also collect 
information from all of the APs about things such as RF interference, rogue or unexpect-
ed wireless devices that were overheard, and wireless usage statistics. 
 Note  At one time, Cisco offered a central AP management appliance called the 
Wireless LAN Solution Engine (WLSE). Its usefulness ended with the dawn of the 
CUWN architecture. 
 What exactly does an autonomous AP need to become a part of the network? Refer 
to  Figure   9-3   , which focuses on just one AP and its connections. The wireless network 
consists of two SSIDs: 100 and 200. These correspond to wired VLANs 100 and 200, 
respectively. The VLANs must be trunked from the distribution layer switch to the 
access layer, where they are extended further over a trunk link to the AP.

 The AP must be configured with a management IP address (10.10.10.10) so that you and 
your central AP management device can remotely manage it. The management address is 
not normally part of any of the data VLANs, so a dedicated management VLAN (VLAN 
10 in the figure) must be added to the trunk links to reach the AP. 
 With the central AP management device controlling the AP, notice what happens to the 
traffic going to and from the AP. The traffic is divided into two functions:  
  ■ 
 A control plane    —Traffic used to control, configure, manage, and monitor the AP
itself 
  ■ 
 A data plane —End-user traffic passing through the AP 
 Because the control and data plane traffic must reach every autonomous AP, the net-
work configuration and efficiency can become cumbersome as the network scales. For

example, you will likely want to offer the same SSID on many APs so that wireless 
clients can associate with that SSID in most any location or while roaming between two 
APs. You might also want to extend the corresponding VLAN to each and every AP so 
that clients do not have to request a new IP address for each new association.  
 Because SSIDs and their VLANs must be extended at Layer 2, you should consider how 
they are extended throughout the switched network.  Figure   9-4    shows an example of 
a single VLAN’s extent in the data plane. Working right to left, follow VLAN 100 as it 
reaches through the network. VLAN 100 is routed within the distribution layer and must 
be carried over trunk links to the access layer switches and then to each autonomous AP. 
In effect, VLAN 100 must extend end to end across the whole infrastructure—some-
thing that is considered a bad practice.

 That might not sound cumbersome until you have to add a new VLAN and configure 
every switch in your network. Even worse, suppose your network has redundant links 
between each layer of switches. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) running on each 
switch becomes a vital ingredient to prevent bridging loops from forming and corrupting 
the network. As the wireless network expands, the infrastructure becomes more difficult 
to configure correctly and becomes less efficient.  
 A Centralized Architecture 
 Because autonomous APs are... well, autonomous, managing their RF operation can be 
quite difficult. As a network administrator, you are in charge of selecting and configur-
ing the channel used by each AP and detecting and dealing with any rogue APs that 
might be interfering. You must also manage things such as the transmit power level to 
make sure that the wireless coverage is sufficient, does not overlap too much, and there 
aren’t any coverage holes—even when an AP’s radio fails.  
 Managing wireless network security can also be difficult. Each autonomous AP handles 
its own security policies, with no central point of entry between the wireless and wired 
networks. That means there is no convenient place to monitor traffic for things such as 
intrusion detection and prevention, quality of service, bandwidth policing, and so on. 
 The Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) is a centralized, unified approach that 

Chapter 9: Understanding the CUWN Architecture  187
overcomes the shortcomings of distributed autonomous APs. To build such an architec-
ture, many of the functions found within autonomous APs have to be shifted toward 
some central location. In  Figure   9-5   , most of the activities performed by an autonomous 
AP are broken up into two groups—real-time processes on the left and management 
processes on the right.

 The real-time processes involve sending and receiving 802.11 frames, beacons, and probe 
messages. 802.11 data encryption is also handled in real-time, on a per-packet basis. The 
AP must interact with wireless clients on some low level, known as the  media access con-
trol (MAC) layer. These functions must stay with the AP, closest to the clients. 
 The management functions are not integral to handling frames over the RF channels, but 
are things that should be centrally administered. Therefore, those functions are moved 
to a centrally located platform away from the AP. 
 In the CUWN, a  lightweight access point (LAP) performs only the real-time 802.11 
operation. The LAP gets its name because the code image and the local intelligence are 
stripped down or lightweight, compared to the traditional autonomous AP. 
 The management functions are usually performed on a  wireless LAN controller (WLC), 
which is common to many LAPs. This is shown in the bottom portion of  Figure   9-5   . 
Notice that the LAP is left with duties in Layers 1 and 2, where frames are moved into 
and out of the RF domain. The LAP becomes totally dependent on the WLC for every 
other WLAN function, such as authenticating users, managing security policies, and even 
selecting RF channels and output power.  
 Tip  Remember that a lightweight AP cannot normally operate on its own—it is very 
dependent upon a WLC somewhere in the network.

 Split-MAC Architecture 
 The LAP-WLC division of labor is known as a  split-MAC architecture , where the nor-
mal MAC operations are pulled apart into two distinct locations. This occurs for every 
LAP in the network; each one must boot and bind itself to a WLC to support wireless 
clients. The WLC becomes the central hub that supports a number of LAPs scattered 
about in the network. 
 How does an LAP bind with a WLC to form a complete working access point? The two 
devices must use a tunneling protocol between them, to carry 802.11-related messages 
and also client data. Remember that the LAP and WLC can be located on the same 
VLAN or IP subnet, but they do not have to be. Instead, they can be located on two 
entirely different IP subnets in two entirely different locations.  
 The Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunneling protocol 
makes this all possible by encapsulating the data between the LAP and WLC within new 
IP packets. The tunneled data can then be switched or routed across the campus net-
work. As  Figure   9-6    shows, the CAPWAP relationship actually consists of the following 
two tunnels: 
  ■ 
 CAPWAP control messages    —Used for exchanges that are used to configure the
LAP and manage its operation. The control messages are authenticated and encrypt-
ed, so that the LAP is securely controlled by only the WLC, then transported using
UDP port 5246 at the controller. 
  ■ 
 CAPWAP data    —Used for packets traveling to and from wireless clients that are
associated with the LAP. Data packets are transported using UDP port 5247 at the
controller, but are not encrypted by default. When data encryption is enabled for
an LAP, packets are protected with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

 Tip  CAPWAP is defined in RFCs 5415, 5416, 5417, and 5418. CAPWAP is based on 
the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP), which was a legacy Cisco proprietary 
solution.  
Key 
Topic

Chapter 9: Understanding the CUWN Architecture  189
 Every LAP and WLC must also authenticate each other with digital certificates. An 
X.509 certificate is preinstalled in each device when it is purchased. By using certificates 
behind the scenes, every device is properly authenticated before becoming part of the 
CUWN. This process helps assure that no rogue LAP or WLC (or devices posing as an 
LAP or WLC) can be introduced into the network. The LAP-WLC association is covered 
in greater detail in  Chapter   11   , “Understanding Controller Discovery.” 
 The CAPWAP tunneling allows the LAP and WLC to be separated geographically and 
logically. It also breaks the dependence on Layer 2 connectivity between them. For 
example,  Figure   9-7    uses shaded areas to show the extent of VLAN 100. Notice how 
VLAN 100 exists at the WLC and in the air as SSID 100, near the wireless clients—but 
not in between the LAP and the WLC. Instead, traffic to and from clients associated 
with SSID 100 is transported across the network infrastructure encapsulated inside the 
CAPWAP data tunnel.

 Also, notice how the LAP is known by only a single IP address 10.10.10.10. Because 
the LAP sits on the access layer where its CAPWAP tunnels terminate, it can use one 
IP address for management and tunneling. No trunk link is needed because all of the 
VLANs it supports are encapsulated and tunneled.  
 As the wireless network grows, the WLC simply builds more CAPWAP tunnels to reach 
more APs.  Figure   9-8    depicts a network with four LAPs. Each LAP has a control and a 
data tunnel back to the centralized WLC. SSID 100 can exist on every AP, and VLAN 
100 can reach every AP through the network of tunnels.

 Once CAPWAP tunnels are built from a WLC to one or more lightweight APs, the WLC 
can begin offering a variety of additional functions. Think of all the puzzles and short-
comings that were discussed for the traditional autonomous WLAN architecture as you 
read over the following list of WLC activities:  
  ■ 
 Dynamic channel assignment    —The WLC can automatically choose and configure
the RF channel used by each LAP, based on other active access points in the area.
  ■ 
 Transmit power optimization    —The WLC can automatically set the transmit power
of each LAP based on the coverage area needed.
  ■ 
 Self-healing wireless coverage    —If an LAP radio dies, the coverage hole can be
“healed” by turning up the transmit power of surrounding LAPs automatically. 
  ■ 
 Flexible client roaming    —Clients can roam between LAPs at either Layer 2 or Layer
3 with very fast roaming times.
  ■ 
 Dynamic client load balancing    —If two or more LAPs are positioned to cover the
same geographic area, the WLC can associate clients with the least used LAP. This
distributes the client load across the LAPs.
  ■ 
 RF Monitoring    —The WLC manages each LAP so that it scans channels to monitor
the RF usage. By listening to a channel, the WLC can remotely gather information
about RF interference, noise, signals from neighboring LAPs, and signals from rogue
APs or ad hoc clients.
  ■ 
 Security management    —The WLC can authenticate clients from a central service
and can require wireless clients to obtain an IP address from a trusted DHCP server
before allowing them to associate and access the WLAN.
  ■ 
 Wireless intrusion protection system —Leveraging its central location, the WLC
can monitor client data to detect and prevent malicious activity. 
 Traffic Patterns in a CUWN 
 Recall that autonomous APs bridge traffic between a wireless BSS and a wired VLAN. 
To get to and from the wired network, the AP relies on its connection to the distribution 
system (DS). LAPs work in a similar fashion, except that the BSS and DS are separated by 
some expanse of the network infrastructure; that expanse is connected by the CAPWAP 
tunnel. 
 Consider the network shown in  Figure   9-9 . Two wireless clients are associated with the 
WLAN that is formed by the LAP and WLC combination. Traffic from Client B to a 
host somewhere on the wired network travels through the LAP, through the CAPWAP 
data tunnel to the WLC, and then out onto the switched campus network.

 Traffic between the two wireless clients, however, takes an interesting path. With an 
autonomous AP, the traffic from one client usually passes through the AP to reach the 
other client. The CUWN architecture is similar, as shown in  Figure  9-10 . The client traf-
fic usually travels through the CAPWAP tunnel and passes through the WLC before 
making a return trip back through the tunnel to the other client. There are exceptions, 
however. Clients may use DLS to communicate directly, without passing through the AP 
and controller; LAPs can also be configured in FlexConnect mode, so that traffic can be 
forwarded locally  at the AP if needed.

 Figure 9-10  CUWN Traffic Pattern Between Wireless Clients. 
 In a switched campus infrastructure, the CUWN traffic pattern is not a big problem 
because the WLC is centrally located and bandwidth is plentiful. Suppose that the net-
work grows to include some remote sites. LAPs are placed at the remote sites, but the 
only WLC is located back at the main campus. This scenario forces wireless traffic to 
traverse the CAPWAP tunnel between remote and main sites, then perhaps back through 
the tunnel to the remote site again. Such a path might not be efficient at all, especially 
when the bandwidth to the remote site is limited.  
 To address the inefficiency, you can leverage the FlexConnect mode on the remote site 
LAPs. Remote-site traffic that needs to traverse the CAPWAP data tunnel to reach the 
WLC will be transported as usual. However, wireless traffic that is destined for remote 
site networks can stay within the remote site; the remote site LAPs are able to locally 
switch the traffic without traversing the CAPWAP tunnel. Even if the remote site link 
goes down, severing the CAPWAP tunnel completely, FlexConnect allows the LAP 
to keep switching traffic locally to maintain wireless connectivity available inside the 
remote site.  
 Tip  FlexConnect was previously known as the Hybrid Remote Edge Access Point 
(H-REAP) feature.

writing. You might see any of these products mentioned on the CCNA Wireless exam. 
Because new products are usually introduced before exams are updated, you might have 
exam questions that pertain to some of the legacy products. A star in the form factor 
column designates a legacy product, or one that has been given end-of-sale (EOS) or 
end-of-life (EOL) status. 
 Use  Table   9-2    to become familiar with the entire spectrum of Cisco WLCs—not to 
memorize their specifications. Be aware of the relative AP capacity based on the model. 
Generally, the number of supported LAPs rises as the model number increases. Products 
that support a low number of LAPs are usually meant for small campus sites, while prod-
ucts that support 1000 or 6000 LAPs are flagship models that are meant for very large 
enterprises. 
 Many WLCs are standalone appliances, while a few are special purpose modules that 
can be installed in routers (ISR) or Catalyst 6500 chassis. The Wireless Service Module 2 
(WiSM2) is unique because it can be integrated into an existing Catalyst 6500 switch. Up 
to seven WiSM2 modules can live in a single switch chassis. 
 You might be surprised to see the Catalyst 3850 switch listed as a WLC. Cisco has 
added the WLC functionality to it as an additional software license. The integrated 
WLC function can be managed through the CLI or its own web interface. From a wire-
less LAN perspective, the Catalyst 3850 is best suited for a small single-site enterprise 
or at remote sites. Even though each switch can support up to 50 APs, the limit does 
not increase when switches are stacked. That is not really a problem because it is very 
unlikely you would ever encounter more than 50 APs in a single site each limited to a 
100-meter twisted-pair cable.  
 The virtual WLC (vWLC) is an interesting product because it consists of software only, 
running under a VMware Hypervisor. You might use it in a small enterprise or in a lab 
scenario. Because of its virtual nature, vWLC can coexist with other Cisco wireless man-
agement software on a single VMware platform. The vWLC cannot support any APs in 
local mode; all APs must be configured for FlexConnect instead.  

194  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Be aware that you can deploy several WLCs in a network, to handle a growing number 
of LAPs. In addition, multiple WLCs offer some redundancy so that LAPs can recover 
from a WLC failure. High availability and redundancy are covered in  Chapter  11 . 
 Cisco Lightweight APs 
 Cisco offers a complete line of LAPs that are designed to connect to a WLC to offer 
fully functional wireless service.  Table   9-3 lists many of the LAP models, along with their 
intended application, antenna gain, and 802.11 radio support. The list of APs might seem 
staggering at first, especially when you are studying for the exam. 
 Try to break the table down into sections and then compare the capabilities between 
models. For example, the top portion of the table consists of the 1040, 1140, 1250, and 
1260—all legacy models that might be mentioned on the exam, but are not considered 
to be forward-looking models. The bottom portion of the table consists of the 1602, 
2602, 3602, and 3607—forward-looking models for the small/midsize, small/midsize/
large, and midsize/large enterprise environments, respectively.

 The 3602 is unique because it is modular and can provide “future-proof” upgrades. It 
can accept an 802.11ac module or a Wireless Security and Spectrum Intelligence (WSSI) 
module for added functionality. With the WSSI module, an AP can perform channel 
scanning and intrusion protection with dedicated radios, rather than borrowing idle time 
from the AP’s own radios between transmissions. The 3702 integrates 802.11ac Wave 1 
and provides space for a Wave 2 module. 
 The 600 OfficeExtend AP is a unique model that is targeted for the remote worker 
located in a home office. It can connect directly to a broadband network service and 
provide a BSS, while building CAPWAP tunnels back to a centrally located WLC. The 
600 encrypts the CAPWAP control tunnel, like other LAP models, but can also encrypt 
the CAPWAP data tunnel using DTLS. 
 CleanAir is a Cisco feature that allows an AP to perform spectrum analysis on the wire-
less channels to detect non-802.11 interference. In cooperation with a WLC, CleanAir 
APs can detect and identify sources of interference and make adjustments to avoid 
the interference. When the AP and WLC are used in conjunction with Cisco Mobility 
Services Engine (MSE) and a CUWN management platform, interferers can even be 
located on a map! This enables the CUWN to be self-healing, able to pinpoint and 
recover from external problems dynamically. CleanAir is discussed further in  Chapter 
 19 , “Dealing with Wireless Interference.” 
 Each of the APs listed in  Table   9-3    offers 802.11a/b/g/n support. The main difference 
between models pertains to multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) operation, with a 
differing number of radios and spatial streams. Recall from  Chapter  2 , “RF Standards,” 
that a radio described as 2×3:2 has two transmitters, three receivers, and two spatial 
streams. As the number of radios and spatial streams increases, the AP is able to provide 

196  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
a greater throughput for its clients. Notice how the number of radios and spatial streams 
increase as you move down the table toward higher end models. 
 Note  Table   9-3    lists only the lightweight APs that are used to provide a straightforward 
BSS. Cisco also offers the 1500 family of LAPs, which are used to build an outdoor wire-
less mesh network. Mesh networks are outside the scope of this book and the CCNA 
Wireless exam. 
 As you learned in  Chapter   8    many Cisco APs can operate in either autonomous or light-
weight mode, depending on which code image is loaded and run. From the WLC, you can 
also configure a lightweight AP to operate in one of the following special purpose modes:  
  ■ 
 Local mode    —The default lightweight mode that offers one or more functioning
BSSs on a specific channel. During times that it is not transmitting, the LAP will scan
the other channels to measure the noise floor, measure interference, discover rogue
devices, and match against intrusion detection system (IDS) events. 
  ■ 
 Monitor mode    —The LAP does not transmit at all, but its receiver is enabled to act
as a dedicated sensor. The LAP checks for IDS events, detects rogue access points,
and determines the position of stations through location-based services (LBS). 
  ■ 
 HREAP mode    —Also known as FlexConnect mode, an LAP at a remote site can
locally switch traffic between an SSID and a VLAN if its CAPWAP tunnel to the
WLC is down and if it is configured to do so. 
  ■ 
 Sniffer mode    —An LAP dedicates its radios to receiving 802.11 traffic from other
sources, much like a sniffer or packet capture device. The captured traffic is
then forwarded to a PC running network analyzer software such as Wildpackets
OmniPeek or WireShark, where it can be analyzed further. 
  ■ 
 Rogue detector mode    —An LAP dedicates its radios to listening for other neigh-
boring APs and clients to determine whether they are rogue devices. Device MAC
addresses heard on the LAP’s wired interface are compared with those heard over
the air. Rogue devices are those that appear on both networks.
  ■ 
 Bridge    —An LAP becomes a dedicated bridge (point to point or point to multipoint)
between two networks. Two LAPs in bridge mode can be used to link two locations
separated by a distance. Multiple LAPs in bridge mode can form an indoor or out-
door mesh network. 
  ■ 
 OEAP    —The LAP operates as an OfficeExtend AP, intended for teleworkers in
remote home offices. The LAP connects to the local broadband service and builds
a CAPWAP tunnel to the central WLC. User data can be encrypted over the
CAPWAP data tunnel using DTLS.
  ■ 
 SE-Connect    —The LAP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis on all wireless
channels. You can remotely connect a PC running software such as the Cisco
Spectrum Expert to the LAP to collect and analyze the spectrum analysis data to
discover sources of interference. 

Chapter 9: Understanding the CUWN Architecture  197
 CUWN Management 
 Managing several WLCs can require a significant effort, due to the number of control-
lers, LAPs, and clients involved. In addition, it is difficult to monitor all of the alarms and 
events generated by all of the related equipment present in the network. Fortunately, 
Cisco offers a central management platform that is up to the task.  
 The CUWN management platform began as the Wireless Control System (WCS), then 
evolved to become Cisco Prime Network Control System (NCS), and is now known as 
Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI). Unfortunately, the CCNA Wireless Exam 640-722 cov-
ers only WCS and something called Navigator. Do not worry, though: Even though the 
product names have changed and many new functions have been added since the WCS 
days, the basic CUWN management functions are very much the same. In other words, if 
you know something about Cisco PI, you will know something about WCS. The remain-
der of this section presents a running history  of the management products, so that you 
can put them all into perspective.  
 WCS was a dedicated appliance that offered a single web-based front end to manage 
and monitor all CUWN devices and client activity. From the WCS, you could perform 
any WLAN management or configuration task, without having to connect to individual 
WLCs or LAPs. You could even streamline configuration tasks by using templates that 
could be applied to multiple devices in one pass. WCS also offered RF planning, and 
wireless user tracking, troubleshooting, and monitoring.  
 WCS used building floor plans to display predictive “heatmap” representations of wireless 
coverage. It could also be fed information about the building construction to improve its 
concept of RF signal propagation. Once this was done, WCS could locate a wireless client 
to within a few meters by triangulating the client’s signal as received by multiple LAPs.  
 WCS could be teamed with the legacy Cisco Wireless Location Appliance to track the 
location of thousands of wireless clients. You could even deploy active 802.11 RFID 
tags to track objects as they move around in the wireless coverage area. 
 As a network scaled to become very large, multiple WCS servers might have been need-
ed. The WCS Navigator product provided a single portal to manage up to 20 instances 
of WCS and up to 30,000 APs.  
 When WCS evolved to become NCS, it could be run on a dedicated appliance or as a 
VMware image. In addition to wireless device management, NCS added some switch 
management functions. It also provided dynamic RF coverage heatmaps, depicting 
current conditions on building floor plans. Wireless client location and tracking was 
improved by teaming NCS with the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE).  
 The final evolution from Cisco Prime NCS to Cisco PI streamlined many management pro-
cesses and added much more functionality. For example, PI offers converged management 
of both wireless and wired network devices, and more integration with wireless intrusion 
prevention services, spectrum analysis, and tracking of users, interferers, and rogue devices. 
 You can learn more about the management functions that are necessary for the CCNA 
Wireless exam in  Chapter  18 , “Managing Wireless Networks with WCS.”

 Before you can use a Cisco wireless LAN controller, you must connect it to the switched 
network. The controller must also link wired networks with wireless ones. You need to 
understand how to make the necessary connections, both physical and logical, to build 
a functioning Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN). This chapter covers these con-
cepts, in addition to how to enter a minimal initial configuration to get a controller up 
on the network where you can manage it more fully.

 Connecting the Controller 
 Cisco wireless LAN controllers partner with lightweight access points (LAPs) to provide 
connectivity between a switched network and mobile wireless clients. The switched 
network infrastructure also transports the packets that make up the Control and 
Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnels between the controllers and 
the access points (APs). Your first task to begin using a controller is to connect it to the 
network. 
 From your work with Cisco routers and switches, you probably know that the terms 
 interface  and  port  are usually interchangeable. For example, switches can come in 24- or 
48-port models, and you apply configuration changes to the corresponding interfaces. 
Cisco wireless controllers differ a bit; ports and interfaces refer to different concepts. 
 Controller ports are physical connections made to an external switched network, where-
as interfaces are logical connections made internally within the controller. The following 
sections explain each connection type in more detail.  
 Using Controller Ports 
 You can connect several different types of controller ports to your network, as shown in 
 Figure  10-1 and discussed in the following list: 
  ■ 
 Service port    —Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot
functions; always connects to a switch port in access mode
  ■ 
 Distribution system port    —Used for all normal AP and management traffic; usually
connects to a switch port in 802.1Q trunk mode
  ■ 
 Console port    —Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial
boot functions; asynchronous connection to a terminal emulator (9600 baud, 8 data
bits, 1 stop bit, by default)
  ■ 
 Redundancy port    —Used to connect to a peer controller for redundant operation

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  205
 Controllers have a single service port that must be connected to a switched network. 
Usually the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the 
controller with Secure Shell (SSH) or a web browser to perform initial configuration or 
for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the cor-
responding switch port must be configured for access mode only. 
 Controllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the 
network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. 
For example, the CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that connect to each of a control-
ler’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless 
LANs to wired VLANs over the ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web 
browser, SSH, SNMP, or TFTP normally reaches the controller through the ports. 
 Because the distribution system ports must carry data that is associated with many dif-
ferent VLANs, VLAN tags and numbers become very important. For that reason, the dis-
tribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode. When you connect the 
ports to a switch, you should also configure the switch ports for unconditional 802.1Q 
trunk mode.  
 The distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple 
VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can con-
figure distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, 
a backup port is used instead.  
 To get the most use out of each distribution system port, you can configure all of them 
to operate as a single logical group, much like an EtherChannel on a switch. Controller 
distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that 
they are bundled together to act as one larger link. In  Figure   10-1   , the four distribution 
system ports are configured as a LAG. With a LAG configuration, traffic can be load 
balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG. In addition, LAG offers 
resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be  redirected to the remaining working 
ports instead.  
  Table   10-2    lists common Cisco controller models along with the distribution system and 
service ports available. As you might expect, the more APs a controller platform sup-
ports, the greater distribution system port throughput it needs. In contrast, almost every 
model uses a 1-Gbps service port because the out-of-band management traffic require-
ments are fairly small.

 Using Controller Interfaces 
 Through its distribution system ports, a controller connects to multiple VLANs on the 
switched network. Internally, the controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to 
equivalent logical wireless networks. For example, suppose that VLAN 10 is set aside for 
wireless users in the Engineering division of a company. That VLAN must be connected 
to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated APs. The wireless 
LAN must then be connected to every client that associates with service set identifier 
(SSID) “Engineering”. 
 Cisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal interfaces. 
A controller interface is logical and must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, 
default gateway, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each inter-
face is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as 
a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.  
 Cisco controllers support the following interface types, also shown in  Figure  10-2 : 
  ■ 
 Management interface    —Used for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS
user authentication, wireless LAN controller (WLC)-to-WLC communication, web-
based and SSH sessions, SNMP, NTP, syslog, and so on
  ■ 
 AP-manager interface    —Used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the control-
ler and its APs
  ■ 
 Virtual interface    —Used to relay client DHCP requests, client web authentication,
and to support client mobility 
  ■ 
 Service port interface    —Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band
management 
  ■ 
 Dynamic interface —Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN 
 The management and AP-manager interfaces both face the switched network, where 
management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of proto-
cols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP, and so on. AP-manager traffic always consists 
of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs. 
 The two interfaces are listed separately, but the AP-manager interface is optional. By 
default, the AP-manager interface is not available for use until it is explicitly config-
ured, so CAPWAP tunnels will be terminated on the Management interface instead. 
You can create an AP-manager interface if you would like to keep the management and 
CAPWAP traffic separate. However, the two interfaces should always reside on the 
same VLAN.

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  207
 The virtual interface is used only for certain client facing operations. For example, when 
a wireless client issues a DHCP request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay 
the request on to a normal DHCP server. From the client’s perspective, the DHCP server 
appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual inter-
face’s address, but that address is never used when the controller communicates with 
other devices on the switched network.  
 Because the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you 
should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 
10.1.1.1 because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918. 
 Tip  Traditionally, many people have assigned IP address 1.1.1.1 to the virtual inter-
face. Although it is a unique address, it is routable and already in use elsewhere on the 
Internet. A better practice is to use an IP address from a private address space that is 
unused or reserved, such as 192.0.2.1.  
 The virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility. For that reason, every 
controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual 
address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all the con-
trollers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.  
 Dynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs, making the logical connections between 
wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless 
LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs, and then map the interface to the WLAN.

Each dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as 
a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, 
you can configure an optional access list. Dynamic interface and WLAN configuration 
are covered in more detail in  Chapter  15 , “Configuring a WLAN.” 
 Running the Initial Setup Wizard 
 When you power up a wireless controller for the first time, it comes up with a minimal 
default configuration. The distribution system ports are not yet usable, but you can con-
nect to the controller through its console port or through its service port—provided you 
have connected the service port to a switch or an Ethernet crossover cable. The service 
port can use a default IP address of 192.168.1.1, or it can request an address through 
DHCP. 
 The default configuration has no interfaces or WLANs defined. APs cannot connect to 
it until you provide some initial setup information and then configure it further after the 
controller reboots into normal operation.  
 You can use either a web browser or the command-line interface (CLI) to set up a con-
troller for the first time. Both methods are covered in the following sections. Through 
the initial setup, you define the minimum parameters for the controller to become 
operational—the service port, management interface, virtual interface, WLAN, authenti-
cation server, clock, and so on.  
 Initial Setup with the Web Interface 
 After you have connected a controller to the network and have powered it up, you can 
use a web browser to enter a basic configuration. The controller prompts you through 
the following sequence of steps to configure various parameters as part of an initial 
setup wizard: 
 Step 1. 
  Configure system access.   Connect your PC to the same VLAN and subnet 
that the controller’s service port uses, and then open a web browser to the 
controller’s service port IP address. In  Figure  10-3 , the service port uses 
192.168.1.1 and the initial setup wizard asks for a system name for the con-
troller, along with an administrative user’s ID and password. By default, the 
username is  admin  and the password is  admin . The system name is somewhat 
like a hostname and is used to identify the controller to APs and other con-
trollers. Click the  Next  button to continue.  
 Step 2. 
 Configure SNMP access. 
 By default, SNMP Versions 2c and 3 are enabled. Version 3 provides the 
most secure access and is recommended, whereas Version 2c is not. Version 
1 is disabled because it is not considered to be secure. You can enable or 
disable each version as shown in  Figure  10-4 . If SNMPv3 is enabled, the con-
troller will remind you to configure an SNMPv3 user once the initial configu-
ration is complete and the controller reboots. Click  Next to continue. 

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  209
 Figure 10-4  Configuring SNMP Access. 
 Step 3. 
  Configure the service port. 
 Although the controller’s service port has a default initial IP address (the 
one you’re using to run the initial configuration), you can configure it to use 
something else in the future. Check the  DHCP Protocol box to have the con-
troller request an address through DHCP. Otherwise, you can leave the box 
unchecked and enter a static IP address instead. In  Figure  10-5 , the service 
port is configured to use DHCP. The address and netmask shown will be dis-
regarded. Click  Next  to continue. 
 Figure 10-3  Starting the Initial Setup Wizard. 

210  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 10-5  Configuring the Service Port. 
 Step 4. 
 Configure LAG mode. 
 By default, all the distribution system ports will be bundled together as a sin-
gle LAG link, as shown in  Figure  10-6 . You can disable LAG mode through 
the drop-down menu. Click  Next to continue. 
 Figure 10-6  Configuring LAG Mode. 
 Step 5. 
  Configure the management interface. 
 By default, a controller uses a single management interface for both man-
agement and CAPWAP traffic. The interface is configured for VLAN 0 
(the 802.1Q trunk native VLAN), with no valid IP address. You can set the 
VLAN number, IP address, subnet mask, and gateway as shown in  Figure 
  10-7   . In this example, the management interface resides on VLAN 50 at 

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  211
192.168.50.10. You can also configure the primary and secondary DHCP 
server addresses that the controller will use if it has to relay any DHCP 
requests from wireless clients. Because the management interface does not 
touch wireless clients directly, the DHCP  server addresses are not necessary. 
Click  Next  to continue.  
 Tip  You might have noticed that the controller’s native VLAN is VLAN 0, whereas 
Cisco switches use native VLAN 1 as a default. A controller and a switch may commu-
nicate over the native VLAN because traffic is  untagged . Even though the native VLAN 
numbers differ, it does not matter because no tag is added at all.  
 Figure 10-7  Configuring the Management Interface. 
 Step 6. 
  Configure the RF mobility domain and country code. 
 A controller must be configured to use the RF parameters that are defined by 
the local regulatory body. It also uses a RF mobility domain name to group 
like controllers together so that things like AP channel numbers and transmit 
power can be centrally managed. By default, the RF mobility domain is set 
to default. You can override that value as shown in  Figure  10-8 . Although 
the selected country code is not shown in the figure, it has defaulted to US. 
Click  Next  to continue.  

212  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 10-8  Configuring the RF Regulatory Domain. 
 Step 7. 
  Configure the virtual interface. 
 By default, the virtual interface is configured with address 1.1.1.1. You 
should enter a different address, such as the one shown in  Figure  10-9 . You 
should have an entry for the virtual interface in your DNS server, to stream-
line client web authentication. You can also configure a DNS hostname on 
the controller, but that same name should also exist on the DNS server. Click 
 Next to continue.  
 Step 8. 
 Configure a WLAN. 
 During the initial setup, you must define one wireless LAN, as shown in 
 Figure   10-10   . The profile name is the name of the WLAN within the control-
ler. The WLAN SSID is the SSID string that will be advertised by any APs 
that offer the WLAN. You might find it convenient to configure both strings 
with the same name, as shown in the figure. 
 Notice that you only need to enter the name of the WLAN—not a VLAN 
number or an interface name. The initial setup process creates a placeholder 
for the WLAN. You will complete the WLAN configuration later, when the 
controller reboots and becomes fully functional. 
 After you click  Next  to continue, you will see a reminder window noting that 
the WLAN has been created with the following default wireless security set-
tings: WPA2, AES, and 802.1x authentication.  Chapter  14 , “Wireless Security 
Fundamentals,” covers these terms in greater detail.  

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  213
 Tip  The WLAN Configuration screen also shows a WLAN ID number. As you create 
new WLANs, the ID number increments. The WLAN ID is an internal index that is main-
ly used when configuration templates are applied to a controller from an Cisco Prime 
Network Control System (NCS) or Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) management station.  
 Figure 10-10  Configuring a WLAN. 
 Step 9. 
  Configure a RADIUS server. 
 As an optional step, you can define a RADIUS server that will be used for cli-
ent authentication. You can always click the  Skip button to skip this step and 
define the server at a later time. 
 Figure 10-9  Configuring the Virtual Interface. 

214  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 If you choose to define the server now, enter the RADIUS server’s IP 
address, shared secret key, port number, and the server status.  Figure  10-11 
shows these fields. You use the Server Status field when multiple servers are 
defined; the controller will send a request to the next server that is in the 
Enabled state in the list. Click  Apply to apply the settings and continue to 
the next step.  
 Figure 10-11  Configuring a RADIUS Server. 
 Step 10.  Configure 802.11 support. 
 By default, a controller enables 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g support glob-
ally for all APs that associate with it. You can override the support settings 
by changing the check boxes shown in  Figure  10-12 . When the initial setup 
is complete and the controller has rebooted into full functionality, you can 
fine-tune the 802.11 support settings further. 
 Also by default, the controller enables Auto-RF, which will automatically 
determine the channel and transmit power level for each AP’s radio. You can 
always fine-tune the Auto-RF settings globally or on a per-AP basis at a later 
time. Click  Next  to continue.  
 The Auto-RF functions are also known as Radio Resource Management 
(RRM), which is covered in greater detail in  Chapter  13 , “Understanding 
RRM.”  
 Step 11.   Configure the system clock.  
 The controller maintains an internal clock. You can set the date, time, and 
time zone, as shown in  Figure  10-13 . Click  Next to continue. After the con-
troller has rebooted and is fully functional, you can configure it to use an 
NTP server to synchronize its clock. 

Chapter 10: Initial Controller Configuration  215
 Figure 10-13  Configuring the System Clock. 
 Step 12.  Reboot the controller. 
 As a last step, to save the initial configuration and reboot the controller, click the  Save 
and Reboot button (see  Figure  10-14 ). 
 Figure 10-12  Configuring 802.11 Support. 

216  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 10-14  Save and Reboot After Completing the Configuration Wizard. 
 After the controller has rebooted, it will be fully functional. At that time, you can repo-
sition your PC on the regular wired network and point your web browser toward the 
controller’s management interface IP address. You will have to log in using the adminis-
trative user ID and password that you configured in Step 1. 
 Initial Setup with the CLI 
 As an alternative to using a web browser for the initial setup, you can connect your PC 
to the controller’s asynchronous console port and use the CLI. Your terminal emulator 
will need to be configured for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit—the same settings 
you use to access the console ports on most Cisco routers and switches.  
 For comparison, the same parameters used in the web-based initial setup are used to 
demonstrate the CLI initial setup in  Example  10-1 . Notice that some CLI prompts end 
with things like [yes][NO]. You can enter either string option shown ( yes or  NO ) or you 
can press  Enter  to use the capitalized default value.

 Foundation Topics 
 Discovering a Controller 
 Cisco LAPs are designed to be “touch free,” so that you can simply unbox a new one 
and connect it to the wired network, without any need to configure it first. Naturally, 
you have to configure the switch port, where the AP connects, with the correct access 
VLAN, access mode, and inline power settings. From that point on, the AP can power up 
and use a variety of methods to find a viable WLC to join. 
 AP States  
 From the time it powers up until it offers a fully functional basic service set (BSS), a LAP 
operates in a variety of states. Each of the possible states are well defined in the Control 
and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) RFC, but are simplified here for 
clarity. The AP enters each state in a specific order; the sequence of states is called a 
 state machine . You should become familiar with the AP state machine so that you can 
understand how an AP forms a working relationship with a WLC. If an AP cannot form 
that relationship for some  reason, your knowledge of the state machine can help you 
troubleshoot the problem.  
 Tip  CAPWAP is defined in RFC 5415, and in a few other RFCs. The terms used in the 
RFC differ somewhat from the ones used in CUWN and this book. For example, access 
controller (AC) refers to a WLC, whereas wireless termination point (WTP) refers to an 
AP. 
 The sequence of the most common states, as shown in  Figure  11-1 , is as follows: 
 1.  AP boots:     Once an AP receives power, it boots on a small IOS image so that it
can work through the remaining states and communicate over its network connec-
tion. The AP must also receive an IP address from a Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) server so that it can communicate over the network. 
 2.  WLC discovery:     The AP goes through a series of steps to find one or more control-
lers that it might join. The steps are explained further in the next section.
 3.  CAPWAP tunnel:     The AP attempts to build a CAPWAP tunnel with one or more
controllers. The tunnel will provide a secure Datagram Transport Layer Security
(DTLS) channel for subsequent AP-WLC control messages. The AP and WLC
authenticate each other through an exchange of digital certificates. 
 4.  WLC join:     The AP selects a WLC from a list of candidates, and then sends a
CAPWAP Join Request message to it. The WLC replies with a CAPWAP Join
Response message. The next section explains how an AP selects a WLC to join.

 5.  Download image:     The WLC informs the AP of its software release. If the AP’s own
software is a different release, the AP will download a matching image from the
controller and then reboot. If the two are running identical releases, no download is
needed. 
 6.  Download config:     The AP pulls configuration parameters down from the WLC and
can update existing values with those sent from the controller. Settings include RF,
service set identifier (SSID), security, and quality of service (QoS) parameters. 
 7.  Run state:     Once the AP is fully initialized, the WLC places it in the “run” state. The
AP and WLC then begin providing a BSS and begin accepting wireless clients.
 8.  Reset:     If an AP is reset by the WLC, it tears down existing client associations and
any CAPWAP tunnels to WLCs. The AP then reboots and starts through the entire
state machine again.

 Be aware that you cannot control which software image release a LAP runs. Rather, 
the WLC that the AP joins determines the release, based on its own software version. 
Downloading a new image can take a considerable amount of time, especially if there are 
a large number of APs waiting for the same download from one WLC. That might not 
matter when a newly installed AP is booting and downloading code, because it does not 
yet have any wireless clients to support. 
 However, if an existing, live AP happens to reboot or join a different controller, clients 
can be left hanging with no AP while the image downloads. Some careful planning with 
your controllers and their software releases will pay off later by minimizing downtime. 
Consider the following scenarios when an AP might need to download a different 
release: 

226  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
  ■ 
 The AP joins a WLC, but has a version mismatch.
  ■ 
 A code upgrade is performed on the WLC itself, requiring all associated APs to
upgrade too. 
  ■ 
 The WLC fails, causing all associated APs to be dropped and join elsewhere.
 If there is a chance that an AP could rehome from one WLC to another, you should 
make sure that both controllers are running the same code release. Otherwise, the AP 
move should happen under controlled circumstances, such as during a maintenance 
window. Fortunately, if you have downloaded a new code release to a controller, but 
not yet rebooted it to run the new code, you can predownload the new release to the 
controller’s APs. The APs will download the new image, but will keep running the previ-
ous release. When it comes time to reboot the controller on the new image, the APs will 
already have the new image staged without having to take time to download it. The APs 
can reboot on their new image and join the controller after it has booted and become 
stable. 
 Discovering a WLC 
 A LAP must be very diligent to discover any controllers that it can join—all without any 
preconfiguration on your part. To accomplish this feat, several methods of discovery 
are used. The goal of discovery is just to build a list of live candidate controllers that are 
available, using the following methods:  
  ■ 
 Prior knowledge of WLCs 
  ■ 
 DHCP and DNS information to suggest some controllers
  ■ 
 Broadcast on the local subnet to solicit controllers
 To discover a WLC, an AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Request to a control-
ler’s IP address or a broadcast to the local subnet. If the controller exists and is working, 
it returns a CAPWAP Discovery Response to the AP. The exact sequence of discovery 
steps used in Controller Software Release 7.0 is as follows: 
 Step 1. 
 Broadcast on the local subnet —The AP will broadcast a CAPWAP 
Discovery Request on its local wired subnet. Any WLCs that also exist on the 
subnet will answer with a CAPWAP Discovery Response.  
 Tip     If the AP and controllers lie on different subnets, you can configure the local router 
to relay any broadcast requests on UDP port 5246 to specific controller addresses. Use 
the following configuration commands:  
router(config)# ip forward-protocol udp 5246
router(config)# interface vlan n
router(config-int)# ip helper-address WLC1-MGMT-ADDR
router(config-int)# ip helper-address WLC2-MGMT-ADDR
Key 
Topic

Chapter 11: Understanding Controller Discovery  227
 Step 2. 
 Use locally stored WLCs —An AP can be “primed” with up to three 
controllers—a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary. These are stored in 
nonvolatile memory so that the AP can remember them after a reboot or 
power failure. Otherwise, if an AP has previously joined with a controller, it 
should have stored up to 8 out of a list of 32 WLC addresses that it received 
from the last controller it joined. The AP will attempt to contact as many 
controllers as possible to build a list of candidates.   
 Step 3. 
 Use DHCP —The DHCP server that supplies the AP with an IP address can 
also send DHCP option 43 to suggest a list of WLC addresses. 
 Step 4. 
 Use DNS —The AP will attempt to resolve the name CISCO-CAPWAP-
CONTROLLER. localdomain with a DNS request. The  localdomain string is 
the domain name learned from DHCP. If the name resolves to an IP address, 
the controller attempts to contact a WLC at that address. 
 Step 5. 
 Reset and try again —If none of the steps has been successful, the AP resets 
itself and starts the discovery process all over again.     
 Selecting a WLC 
 Once an AP has finished the discovery process, it should have built a list of live candi-
date controllers. Now it must begin a separate process to select one WLC and attempt 
to join it. Joining a WLC involves sending it a CAPWAP Join Request and waiting for it 
to return a CAPWAP Join Response. From that point on, the AP and WLC build a DTLS 
tunnel to secure their CAPWAP control messages.  
 The WLC selection process consists of the following three steps: 
 Step 1. 
 Try primed addresses —If the AP has previously joined a controller and has 
been configured or “primed” with a primary, secondary, and tertiary control-
ler, it will try to join those controllers in succession.   
 Step 2. 
 Try the master controller —If the AP does not know of any candidate con-
troller, it can try to discover one by broadcasting on the local subnet. If a 
controller has been configured as a master controller, it can respond to the 
AP’s broadcast.  
 Step 3. 
 Try the least loaded controller —The AP will attempt to join the least loaded 
WLC, in an effort to load balance APs across a set of controllers. During the 
discovery phase, each controller reports its load—the ratio of the number of 
currently joined APs to the total AP capacity. The least loaded WLC is the 
one with the lowest ratio. For example, suppose that a 5508 controller has 20 
out of a possible 100 APs joined to it, while a 2504 controller has 20 out of a 
possible 25 APs. The 5508 would be the least loaded with a ratio of  20/100; 
the 2504 is more loaded with 20/25.    
 If an AP discovers a controller, but gets rejected when it tries to join it, what might be 
the reason? Every controller has a set maximum number of APs that it can support. This 
is defined by platform or by license. If the controller already has the maximum number 
of APs joined to it, it will reject any additional APs.  
Key 
Topic

228  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 To provide some flexibility in supporting APs on an oversubscribed controller, where 
more APs are trying to join than a license allows, you can configure the APs with a prior-
ity value. All APs begin with a default priority of low. You can change the value to low, 
medium, high, or critical. A controller will try to accommodate as many higher-priority 
APs as possible. Once a controller is full of APs, it will reject an AP with the lowest pri-
ority to make room for a new one that has a higher priority. 
 Designing High Availability 
 Once an AP has discovered, selected, and joined a controller, it must stay joined to that 
controller to remain functional. Now consider that a single controller might support 
as many as 1000 or even 6000 APs—enough to cover a very large building or an entire 
enterprise. If something ever causes the controller to fail, a large number of APs would 
also fail. In the worst case, where a single controller carries the enterprise, the entire 
wireless network would become unavailable. That might be catastrophic.  
 Fortunately, Cisco APs can discover multiple controllers—not just the one that it choos-
es to join.  Figure   11-2    shows this scenario. If the joined controller becomes unavailable, 
the AP can simply select the next least-loaded controller and request to join it, as  Figure 
 11-3 depicts. That sounds simple, but it is not very deterministic.

Chapter 11: Understanding Controller Discovery  229
 For example, if a controller full of 1000 APs fails, all 1000 APs must detect the failure, 
discover other candidate controllers, and then select the least loaded one to join. During 
that time, wireless clients can be left stranded with no connectivity. You might envision 
the controller failure as a commercial airline flight that has just been canceled; everyone 
that purchased a ticket suddenly joins a mad rush to find another flight out. 
 The most deterministic approach is to leverage the primary, secondary, and tertiary con-
troller fields that every AP stores. If any of these fields are configured with a controller 
name or address, the AP knows which three controllers to try in sequence before resort-
ing to a more generic search.  
 Tip  When an AP boots and builds a list of potential controllers, it can use CAPWAP to 
build a tunnel to more than one controller. The AP will join only one controller, which 
it uses as the primary unit. By building a tunnel with a second controller ahead of time, 
before the primary controller fails, the AP will not have to spend time building a tunnel 
to the backup controller before joining it. 
 As a wireless network grows, you might have several controllers implemented just to 
support the number of APs that are required. A good network design should also take 
failures and high availability (HA) into consideration. It is not enough just to have multi-
ple controllers in a network. What if they are all in use and full of APs? There would not 
be enough room to spare for a large group of additional, displaced APs to join in their 
time of need. In the commercial flight analogy, there might be other flights departing the 
airport soon after the cancellation. If those  flights are already mostly full of passengers, 
many people will be left waiting at the gate.  
 Figure   11-4 illustrates an example network that does not offer enough capacity to fully 
survive a controller failure. In the “before” diagram, a group of 400 APs has joined 
controller WLC-A, and a group of 300 APs has joined WLC-B. Each controller has a 
maximum capacity of 500 APs. As long as both controllers stay up and functional, the 
wireless network should work fine. In the “after” diagram, WLC-A has failed. All 400 
APs that were previously joined to WLC-A will discover that WLC-B is alive, so they 
will all try to join it. WLC-B already has 300 APs, so it  has room for only 200 more. That 
means 200 APs will be able to join WLC-B and 200 more will be left out in the cold with 
no controller to join at all.

 Figure 11-4  The Result of Undersized Controllers During a Failure. 
 Detecting a Controller Failure 
 When HA is required, make sure that you design your wireless network to support it 
properly. Fortunately, Cisco APs and controllers are built with HA in mind, so you have 
several strategies at your disposal. First, it is important to understand how APs detect a 
controller failure and what action they take to recover from it.  
 Once an AP joins a controller, it sends keepalive (also called heartbeat) messages to the 
controller over the wired network at regular intervals. By default, keepalives are sent 
every 30 seconds. The controller is expected to answer each keepalive as evidence that it 
is still alive and working. If a keepalive is not answered, an AP running Software Release 
7.0 will escalate the test by sending up to five more keepalive messages at 1-second 
intervals. In Release 7.2, four more keepalives are sent at 3-second intervals. If the con-
troller answers, all is well; if it does not answer, the AP presumes that the controller has 
failed. The AP then moves quickly to find a successor to join. 
 Using the default values, an AP can detect a controller failure in as little as 35 seconds. 
You can adjust the regular keepalive timer between 1 and 30 seconds and the escalated 
or “fast” heartbeat timer between 1 and 10 seconds. By using the minimum values, a fail-
ure can be detected after only 6 seconds.  
 Normally, an AP will stay joined to a controller until it fails. If the AP has been config-
ured with primary and secondary controller information, it will join the primary control-
ler first. If the primary fails, the AP will try to join the secondary until it fails. Even if the 
primary controller is put back into service, the AP will stay with the secondary. You can 
change that behavior by enabling the AP Fallback feature—a global controller configura-
tion parameter. If AP Fallback is enabled (the default), an AP can try to rejoin its primary 
controller at any time, whether its current controller has failed or not. 

Chapter 11: Understanding Controller Discovery  231
 Building Redundancy 
 Building a wireless network with one controller and some APs is straightforward, but 
it does not address what would happen if the controller fails for some reason. Adding 
another controller or two could provide some redundancy, as long as the APs know how 
to move from one controller to another when the time comes. 
 Redundancy is best configured in the most deterministic way possible. The follow-
ing sections explain how you can configure APs with primary, secondary, and tertiary 
controller fields to implement various forms of redundancy. As you read through the 
sections, keep in mind that redundant controllers should be configured similarly so that 
APs can move from one controller to another without having to undergo any major con-
figuration changes.  
 N+1 Redundancy 
 The simplest way to introduce HA into a Cisco unified wireless network is to provide an 
extra backup controller. This is commonly called N+1 or N:1 redundancy, where  N rep-
resents some number of active controllers and 1 denotes the one backup controller.  
 By having one backup controller, N+1 redundancy can withstand a failure of only one 
active controller. As long as the backup controller is sized appropriately, it can accept 
all of a failed controller’s APs. However, once an active controller fails and all its APs 
rehome to the backup controller, there will be no space to accept any other APs if a sec-
ond controller fails.  
 Figure   11-5    illustrates N+1 redundancy with a two-controller network for simplicity. The 
network could have any number of active controllers, but only one backup controller. 
WLC-A is the active controller and carries 100 percent of the network’s APs. WLC-Z is 
the backup controller, which normally carries no APs at all. The backup controller sits 
idle until an active controller fails. 
 To configure N+1 redundancy, you configure the primary controller field on all APs 
with the name of an active controller (WLC-A, for example). The secondary controller 
field is set to the name of the backup controller (WLC-Z).

 N+N Redundancy 
 N+1 design is simple, but it has a couple of shortcomings. First, the backup controller 
must sit idle and empty of APs until another controller fails. That might not sound like 
a problem, except that the backup unit must be purchased with the same AP capacity as 
the active controller it supports. That means the active and backup controllers must be 
purchased at the same price. Having a full-price device sit empty and idle might seem 
like a poor use of funds.  
 Second, the backup controller must be configured identically to every other active con-
troller it has to support. The idea is to make a controller failure as seamless as possible so 
the APs should not have any noticeable configuration differences when they move from 
one controller to another.  
 The N+N redundancy strategy tries to make better use of the available controllers. N+N 
gets its name from grouping controllers in pairs. If you have one active controller, you 
would pair it with one other controller; two controllers would be paired with two others, 
and so on. You might also see the same strategy called N:N or 1+1.  
 By grouping controllers in pairs, you can divide the active role across two separate devic-
es. This makes better use of the AP capacity on each controller. As well, the APs and cli-
ents loads will be distributed across separate hardware, while still supporting redundancy 
during a failure. N+N redundancy can support failures of more than one controller, but 
only if the active controllers are configured in pairs.  
 Figure  11-6    illustrates the N+N scenario consisting of two controllers, WLC-A and 
WLC-B. The APs are divided into two groups—one that joins WLC-A as primary con-
troller and another that joins WLC-B as primary. Notice that the primary and secondary 
controllers are reversed between the two groups of APs. To support the full set of APs 
during a failure, each controller must not be loaded with more than 50 percent of its AP 
capacity.

 N+N+1 Redundancy 
 What if a scenario calls for more resiliency than the N+N plan can provide? You can 
simply add one more controller to the mix, as a backup unit. As you might expect, this is 

Chapter 11: Understanding Controller Discovery  233
commonly called N+N+1 redundancy and combines the advantages of the N+N and N+1 
strategies. 
 Two or more active controllers are configured to share the AP and client load, while 
reserving some AP capacity for use during a failure. One additional backup controller 
is set aside as an additional safety net.  Figure  11-7 shows a simple example using three 
controllers—two active (WLC-A and WLC-B) and one backup (WLC-Z). Like N+N 
redundancy, the two groups of APs are configured with primary and secondary control-
lers that are the reverse of each other. Each group of APs is also configured with a ter-
tiary controller that points to the backup unit. 
 If one active controller fails, APs that were joined to it will move to the secondary 
controller. As long as the two active controllers are not loaded with over 50 percent of 
their AP capacity, either one may accept the full number of APs. N+N+1 goes one step 
further; if the other active controller happens to fail, the backup controller is available to 
carry the load.

 AP SSO Redundancy 
 The N+1, N+N, and N+N+1 strategies all address redundancy and fault tolerance, but 
each still relies on the basic controller discovery and join processes. In other words, APs 
require a certain amount of time to seek out a new controller when they detect that one 
has failed.  
 With Controller Software Release 7.3 or later, Cisco offers AP stateful switchover (SSO) 
redundancy, in addition to the other methods. AP SSO groups controllers into HA pairs, 
where one controller takes on the active role while the other is in a hot standby mode. 
Only the active unit must be purchased with the appropriate license to support the AP 
count; the standby unit is purchased with an HA license. The standby unit can be paired 
with an active unit of any license size, as its AP licenses are not really used until it takes 
on the active role.

 Tip  The 640-722 CCNA Wireless exam covers features found in Controller Software 
Release 7.0. AP SSO and client SSO are presented here to provide an overview of more 
advanced redundancy mechanisms that are available.   
 Figure  11-8    depicts AP SSO redundancy. The APs can be configured with only a primary 
controller name that references the active unit. Because each active controller has its own 
standby controller, there really is no need to configure a secondary or tertiary controller 
on the APs unless you need an additional layer of redundancy.

 Figure 11-8  Configuring AP SSO Redundancy. 
 Each AP learns of the HA pair during a CAPWAP discovery phase, then builds a 
CAPWAP tunnel to the active controller. The active unit keeps CAPWAP tunnels, AP 
states, configurations, and image files all in sync with the hot standby unit. If the active 
unit fails, the hot standby unit quickly takes over the active role. The APs do not have to 
discover another controller to join; the controllers simply swap roles so the APs can stay 
joined to the active controller in the HA pair. 
 The APs do not even have to rebuild their CAPWAP tunnels after a failure. The tunnels 
are synchronized between active and standby, so they are always maintained. The AP 
SSO switchover occurs at the controllers—not at the APs. 
 Tip  The active and standby controllers must always run an identical software image. 
When one controller is upgraded, its standby peer is also upgraded. That also means 
when the active unit is rebooted, the standby unit follows suit. At the time of this writing, 
“hitless” in-service software upgrades are not possible.  
 The hot standby controller monitors the active unit through keepalives that are sent 
every 100 ms. If a keepalive is not answered, the standby unit begins to send ICMP echo 
requests to the active unit to determine what sort of failure has occurred. For example, 
the active unit could have crashed, lost power, or had its network connectivity severed. 

Chapter 11: Understanding Controller Discovery  235
 Once standby unit has declared the active unit as failed, it assumes the active role. The 
failover may take up to 500 ms, in the case of a crash or power failure, or up to 4 sec-
onds if a network failure has occurred. 
 AP SSO is designed to keep the failover process transparent from the AP’s perspective. 
In fact, the APs know only of the active unit; they are not even aware that the hot stand-
by unit exists. The two controllers share a “mobility” MAC address that initially comes 
from the first active unit’s MAC address. From then on, that address is maintained by 
whichever unit has the active role at any given time. The controllers also share a virtual 
IP address. Keeping both MAC and IP addresses virtual and consistent allows the APs to 
stay in contact with the active controller—regardless of which controller currently has 
that role. 
 Even though redundant controllers maintain the state of each AP to minimize any dis-
ruption during a failover, AP SSO does not maintain the state of any clients. If a primary 
controller fails, any associated clients will be dropped and will have to reassociate with 
their APs (and the secondary controller).  
 Controller Release 7.5 introduced client SSO to make controller failover seamless to 
wireless clients. A primary controller synchronizes the state of each associated client that 
is in the RUN state with a secondary controller. If the primary fails, the secondary will 
already have the current state information for each client, making the failover process 
transparent.

 When a wireless client moves about, the expectations are simple—good, seamless cover-
age wherever the client goes. Clients know how to roam between access points (APs), 
but they are ignorant about the wireless network infrastructure. Even in a large network, 
roaming should be easy, quick, and not disrupt the client’s service.  
 Cisco Unified Wireless Networks offer several roaming strategies. From your perspec-
tive as a wireless engineer, roaming configuration is straightforward. The inner workings 
can be complex, depending on the size of the wireless network as measured by the num-
ber of APs and controllers. As you work through the sections in this chapter, you will 
review roaming fundamentals, then learn more about how the Cisco Unified Wireless 
Network (CUWN) handles client roaming and how to configure your controllers to sup-
port it properly. 
 Foundation Topics 
 Roaming with Autonomous APs 
 In  Chapter   6   , “Understanding 802.11 Frame Types,” you learned that a wireless client 
can move from one basic service set (BSS) to another by roaming between APs. A cli-
ent continuously evaluates the quality of its wireless connection. If the signal quality 
degrades, the client begins looking for an AP with a better signal. The process is usually 
quick and simple; active scanning reveals candidate APs, and then the client selects one 
and tries to reassociate with it.  
 Figure  12-1    shows a simple scenario with two APs and one client. The client begins with 
an association to AP-1. Because the APs are running in autonomous mode, each one 
maintains a table of its associated clients. AP-1 has one client; AP-2 has none. 
 Suppose that the client then begins to move into AP-2’s cell. Somewhere near the cell 
boundary, the client decides to roam and reassociate with AP-2.  Figure  12-2 shows the 
new scenario after the roam occurs. Notice that both APs have updated their list of asso-
ciated clients to reflect Client-1’s move from AP-1 to AP-2. If AP-1 still has any leftover 
wireless frames destined for the client after the roam, it forwards them to AP-2 over 
the wired infrastructure—simply because that is where the client’s MAC address now 
resides.

 Naturally, roaming is not limited to only two APs; instead, it occurs between two APs 
at any given time. To cover a large area, you will probably install many APs in a pattern 
such that their cells overlap.  Figure   12-3    shows a typical pattern. When a wireless client 
begins to move, it might move along an arbitrary path. Each time the client decides that 
the signal from one AP has degraded enough, it attempts to roam to a new, better signal 
from a different AP and cell. The exact location of each roam depends on the client’s 
roaming algorithm. To illustrate  typical roaming activity, each roam in  Figure  12-3 is 
marked with a dark ring.  
 Figure 12-3  Successive Roams of a Mobile Client. 
 Intracontroller Roaming 
 In a CUWN, lightweight APs are bound to a wireless LAN controller through CAPWAP 
tunnels. The roaming process is similar to that of autonomous APs; clients must still reas-
sociate to new APs as they move about. The only real difference is that the controller 
handles the roaming process because of the split-MAC architecture.  
 Figure  12-4    shows a two-AP scenario where both APs connect to a single controller. 
Client-1 is associated to AP-1, which has a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access 
Points (CAPWAP) tunnel to controller WLC-1. The controller maintains a client data-
base that contains detailed information about how to reach and support each client. For 
simplicity,  Figure   12-4    shows the database as a list of its APs, associated clients, and the 
wireless LAN (WLAN) being used. The actual database also contains client MAC and IP 
addresses, quality of service (QoS) parameters, and other information.  
 When Client-1 starts moving, it eventually roams to AP-2, as shown in  Figure  12-5 . Not 
much has changed except that the controller has updated the client association from 
AP-1 to AP-2. Because both APs are bound to the same controller, the roam occurs 
entirely within the controller. This is known as  intra controller roaming.

 If both APs involved in a client roam are bound to the same controller, the roaming pro-
cess is simple and efficient. The controller has to update its client association table so 
that it knows which CAPWAP tunnel to use to reach the client. Thanks to the simplicity, 
an intracontroller roam takes less than 10 ms to complete—the amount of processing 
time needed for the controller to switch the client entry from AP-1 to AP-2. From the 
client’s perspective, an intracontroller roam is no different than any other roam. The 
client has no knowledge that the two APs are communicating with a controller over 
CAPWAP tunnels; it simply decides to roam between two APs based on its own signal

 Efficient roaming is especially important when time-critical applications are being used 
over the wireless network. For example, wireless phones need a consistent connection so 
that the audio stream is not garbled or interrupted. When a roam occurs, there could be 
a brief time when the client is not fully associated with either AP. So long as that time is 
held to a minimum, the end user probably will not even notice that the roam occurred. 
 Along with the client reassociation, a couple of other processes can occur: 
  ■ 
 DHCP    —The client may be programmed to renew the DHCP lease on its IP address
or to request a new address.
  ■ 
 Client authentication    —The controller might be configured to use an 802.1x meth-
od to authenticate each client on a WLAN.
 To achieve efficient roaming, both of these processes should be streamlined as much as 
possible. For instance, if a client roams and tries to renew its IP address, it is essentially 
cut off from the network until the Dynamic Host Controller Protocol (DHCP) server 
responds. 
 The client authentication process presents the biggest challenge because the dialog 
between a controller and a RADIUS server, in addition to the cryptographic keys that 
need to be generated and exchanged between the client and an AP or controller, can 
take a considerable amount of time to accomplish. Cisco controllers offer three tech-
niques to minimize the time and effort spent on key exchanges during roams: 
  ■ 
 Cisco Centralized Key Management (CCKM) —One controller maintains a data-
base of clients and keys on behalf of its APs and provides them to other controllers
and their APs as needed during client roams. CCKM requires Cisco Compatibility
Extensions (CCX) support from clients.
  ■ 
 Proactive key caching (PKC)    —Each client maintains a list of keys used with prior
AP associations and presents them as it roams. The destination AP must be present
in this list, which is limited to eight AP-key entries. PKC is also known as sticky pair-
wise master key ID caching (SKC).
  ■ 
 802.11r    —An 802.11 amendment that addresses fast roaming or fast BSS transition;
a client can cache a portion of the authentication server’s key and present that to
future APs as it roams. The client can also maintain its QoS parameters as it roams. 
 Each of the fast roaming strategies requires help on the part of the wireless client. That 
means the client must have a supplicant or driver software that is compatible with fast 
roaming and can cache the necessary pieces of the authentication credentials.  
 Intercontroller Roaming 
 As a wireless network grows, one controller might not suffice. When two or more con-
trollers support the APs in an enterprise, the APs are distributed across them. As always, 
when clients become mobile, they roam from one AP to another—except they could 
also be roaming from one controller to another, depending on how neighboring APs are 

Chapter 12: Understanding Roaming  247
assigned to the controllers. The following sections cover the two types of intercontroller 
roaming that are possible.  
 Layer 2 Roaming 
 When a client roams from one AP to another and those APs lie on two different control-
lers, the client makes an intercontroller roam.  Figure  12-6 shows a simple scenario prior 
to a roam. Controller WLC-1 has one association in its database—that of Client-1 on 
AP-1.  Figure   12-7    shows the result of the client roaming to AP-2.

 Figure 12-6  Before an Intercontroller Roam. 
 The roam itself is fairly straightforward. When the client decides to roam and reassoci-
ate itself with AP-2, the two controllers must coordinate the move. One subtle detail 
involves the client’s IP address. Before the roam, Client-1 is associated with AP-1 and 
takes an IP address from the VLAN and subnet that are configured on the WLAN sup-
plied by controller WLC-1. In  Figure  12-6 , WLAN Staff is bound to VLAN 100, so the 
client uses an address from the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet.  
 When the client roams to a different AP, it can try to continue using its existing IP 
address or work with a DHCP server to either renew or request an address.  Figure  12-7 
shows the client roaming to AP-2, where WLAN Staff is also bound to the same VLAN 
100 and 192.168.100.0/24 subnet. Because the client has roamed between APs but 
stayed on the same VLAN and subnet, it has made a Layer 2 intercontroller roam. Layer 
2 roams (commonly called local-to-local roams) are nice for two reasons: The client can 
keep its same IP address, and the roam is fast (usually less than 20 ms). 

248  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Layer 3 Roaming 
 What if a wireless network grows even more, such that the WLAN interfaces on each 
controller are assigned to different VLANs and subnets? Breaking a very large WLAN 
up into individual subnets seems like a good idea from a scalability viewpoint. However, 
when a wireless client roams from one controller to another, it could easily end up on a 
different subnet than it started with.  
 Clients will not usually be able to detect that they have changed subnets. They will be 
aware of the AP roam but little else. Only clients that aggressively contact a DHCP serv-
er after each and every roam will continue to work properly. But to make roaming seam-
less and efficient, time-consuming processes such as DHCP should be avoided.  
 No worries—the CUWN has a clever trick up its sleeve. When a client initiates an inter-
controller roam, the two controllers involved can compare the VLAN numbers that are 
assigned to their respective WLAN interfaces. If the VLAN IDs are the same, nothing 
special needs to happen; the client undergoes a Layer 2 intercontroller roam and can 
continue to use its original IP address on the new controller. If the two VLAN IDs differ, 
the controllers arrange a  Layer 3 roam  (also known as a local-to-foreign roam) that will 
allow the client to keep using its IP address. 
 Figure  12-8    illustrates a simple wireless network containing two APs and two control-
lers. Notice that the two APs offer different IP subnets in their BSSs: 192.168.100.0/24 
and 192.168.200.0/24. The client is associated with AP-1 and is using IP address 
192.168.100.199. On the surface, it looks like the client will roam into subnet 
192.168.200.0/24 if it wanders into AP-2’s cell, and will lose connectivity if it tries to 
keep using its same IP address.

 Figure 12-8  Before a Layer 3 Intercontroller Roam. 
 A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s 
original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from 
the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.  Figure  12-9  
shows the results of a Layer 3 roam. The original controller (WLC-1) is called the  anchor 
controller , and the controller with the roamed client is called the  foreign controller . Think 
of the client being anchored to the original controller no matter where it roams later. 
When the client roams away from its  anchor, it moves into foreign territory.

 You can see clients that have undergone a Layer 3 roam by selecting  Monitor > Clients 
from the controller graphical user interface (GUI). The client from  Figures  12-8 and  12-9 
is shown in the WLC-1 client list displayed in  Figure   12-10   . Notice that the client’s pro-
tocol is shown as 802.11(Mobile); other clients would be listed as 802.11 only.   
 You can click the client’s MAC address to see more details about its state. In  Figure   
12-11 , you can see that the controller has mobility role Anchor and that the Layer 3 
mobility peer is 172.22.253.20, or WLC-2.   
 Figure 12-10  Displaying Clients with a Layer 3 Intercontroller Roam. 
 Figure 12-11  Displaying Client Details on the Anchor Controller. 

Chapter 12: Understanding Roaming  251
 Due to the Layer 3 roam, the client should have an active association with both the 
anchor and foreign controllers. On the foreign controller, you can view the client details 
from a different perspective. In  Figure  12-12 , the client is shown associated with a for-
eign controller with IP address 172.22.253.9, or WLC-1. On the foreign controller, the 
client is associated to an actual AP (AP-2) with a normal AP type. 
 Cisco controllers have traditionally used Ethernet over IP (EoIP) tunnels between con-
trollers for Layer 3 roaming. Beginning with controller software releases 7.3.112.0, Layer 
3 roaming uses a “new mobility” strategy, with CAPWAP tunnels rather than EoIP. 
Regardless of the tunnel type, be aware that the controller-to-controller tunnel makes 
each Layer 3 roam possible.  
 You should also know that the tunnel tethers the client to its original anchor control-
ler (and original IP subnet), regardless of its location or how many controllers it roams 
through. For example, in  Figure   12-13 , the client has roamed from AP-1 to AP-2 to 
AP-3, and from WLC-1 to WLC-2 to WLC-3, respectively. Although each controller 
offers a different IP subnet for the client to use, the client can keep using its original 
192.168.100.199 address. While the client is on AP-2 and WLC-2, a Layer 3 roam tunnel 
is built from WLC-2 to anchor controller WLC-1. Then when the client finally lands on 
AP-3 and WLC-3, WLC-3 builds a Layer 3 roam tunnel back to anchor controller WLC-1.  
 Figure 12-12  Displaying Client Details on the Foreign Controller. 

252  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Anchor and foreign controllers are normally determined automatically. When a client 
first associates with an AP and controller, that controller becomes its anchor controller. 
When the client roams to a different controller, that controller can take on the for-
eign role. Sometimes you might not want a client’s first controller to be its anchor. For 
example, guest users should not be allowed to associate with just any controller in your 
network. Instead, you might want guests to be forced onto a specific controller that is 
situated behind a firewall or contained in a protected environment. You can configure 
one controller to  be a static anchor for a WLAN so that other controllers will direct cli-
ents toward it through Layer 3 roaming tunnels. Static anchor controllers are covered in 
more detail in  Chapter   16   , “Implementing a Wireless Guest Network.” 
 Using Mobility Groups 
 Cisco controllers can be organized into mobility groups to facilitate intercontroller 
roaming. Mobility groups become important as a wireless network scales and there are 
more controllers cooperating to provide coverage over a large area. 
 If two controllers are configured to belong to the same mobility group, clients can roam 
quickly between them. Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming are both supported, along with 
CCKM, PKC, and 802.11r credential caching. If two controllers are assigned to different 
mobility groups, clients can still roam between them, but the roam is not very efficient. 
Credentials are not cached and shared, so clients must go through a full authentication 
during the roam.

Chapter 12: Understanding Roaming  253
 Mobility groups have an implied hierarchy as shown in  Figure  12-14 . Each controller 
maintains a mobility list that contains its own MAC address and the MAC addresses of 
other controllers. Each controller in the list is also assigned a mobility group name. In 
effect, the mobility list gives a controller its view of the outside world; it knows of and 
trusts only the other controllers configured in the list. If two controllers are not listed in 
each other’s mobility list, they are unknown to each other and clients will not be able to 
roam between them. Clients will have to associate and authenticate from scratch. 
 You can think of this list as a mobility domain. The list can contain up to 72 controllers, 
with up to 24 controllers in each mobility group. 
 You must configure each controller with a mobility group name. Go to  Controller > 
General and enter the group name in the Default Mobility Domain Name field. In  Figure 
 12-15   , the controller has been assigned to Group1. 
 Next, populate the controller’s mobility list with other controllers and their mobil-
ity group names. You can see the current list by selecting  Controller > Mobility 
Management > Mobility Groups , as shown in  Figure  12-16 .

 Configuring 802.11 Support 
 Cisco controllers and most APs can support wireless LANs in both the 2.4- and 5-GHz 
bands. By default, both bands are enabled; however, you can view or change a number 
of parameters by browsing to the Wireless tab in the controller, shown in  Figure  13-1 . 
 Figure 13-1  The Wireless Tab on a Cisco Controller GUI. 
 The wireless parameters are organized under a list of links that are found on the left side 
of the web page. At the CCNA level, you should be familiar with the following links:  
  ■ 
 Access Points    —Used to verify and configure RF things like transmit power level
and channel number on individual APs
  ■ 
 802.11a/n    —Used to configure global parameters for the 5-GHz band
  ■ 
 802.11b/g/n    —Used to configure global parameters for the 2.4-GHz band
 The initial web page displays a list of all APs that are currently joined to the controller, 
as if you had selected  Wireless > Access Points > All APs . The remaining configuration 
is covered in the sections that follow.  

Chapter 13: Understanding RRM  263
 Configuring Data Rates 
 You can enable or disable the 2.4- or 5-GHz bands by selecting  802.11b/g/n or 
 802.11a/n , respectively, and then clicking the  Network link.  Figures  13-2 and  13-3 
show the two network configuration pages. Make sure that the  802.11b/g or  802.11a 
Network Status  check box is checked to enable the 2.4- or 5-GHz radios on all APs. 
 Figure 13-2  Configuring 2.4-GHz Radios. 
 On the right side of the network web pages, as shown in  Figures  13-2 and  13-3 , you 
can configure the individual data rates (and the corresponding modulation and coding 
schemes) that are supported on each band. Each data rate can have one of the following 
states: 
  ■ 
 Mandatory    —A client must be able to use the data rate and Modulation Coding
Scheme (MCS) to associate with an AP. 
  ■ 
 Supported    —A client can associate with an AP even if it cannot use the data rate.
  ■ 
 Disabled    —An AP will not use the data rate with any clients.
 By default, all data rates are enabled and supported. In the 2.4-GHz band, the 1-, 2-, 5.5-, 
and 11-Mbps rates are all marked as mandatory, based on the initial IEEE requirement 
that all clients be able to support each possible modulation type defined in 802.1b. In 
the 5-GHz band, the 6-, 12-, and 24-Mbps rates are marked as mandatory.  
Key 
Topic

264  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 You can change the state of any data rate by selecting a new state from the drop-down 
menu. Remember that you can disable lower data rates to decrease the AP cell size and 
make channel use more efficient. Just make sure that your actions do not shrink the cells 
too much, leaving holes or gaps in the coverage between APs. Also be sure that all of 
your wireless clients can use the same set of mandatory and supported data rates.  
 Be sure to click the  Apply  button to make any configuration changes active. Any wire-
less networks that are already in production on the controller might be disrupted while 
the new configuration takes effect. 
 Configuring 802.11n Support 
 You might have noticed that you can configure plenty of data rates, but 802.11n is never 
mentioned on the wireless network configuration pages. That is because 802.11n is con-
sidered to be a rich set of high-throughput enhancements to both 802.11g and 802.11a 
and must be configured separately.  
 By default, 802.11n is enabled. To check or change its state, go to  Wireless > 802.11a/n 
or  802.11b/g/n > High Throughput (802.11n) .  Figure  13-4 shows the 5-GHz 802.11n 
configuration page. 802.11n is enabled when the  11n Mode  check box is checked. By 
default, every possible MCS is enabled and supported.  
 Figure 13-3  Configuring 5-GHz Radios. 

Chapter 13: Understanding RRM  265
 Figure 13-4  Configuring 802.11n Support. 
 Recall that 802.11n can bond one 20-MHz to an adjacent 20-MHz channel to effectively 
double the channel width. By default, the controller will use only a single 20-MHz chan-
nel. You can configure channel bonding as a part of the dynamic channel allocation 
(DCA) configuration for the 5-GHz band only, as covered in the following section.  
 Understanding RRM 
 Suppose that you need to provide wireless coverage in a rectangular-shaped building. 
Using the information you have learned from this book, you decide to use six APs 
and locate them such that they form a staggered, regular pattern. The pattern shown in 
 Figure   13-5    should create optimum conditions for roaming and channel use. (The build-
ing dimensions have not been mentioned, just to keep things simple.)

 So far, you have considered the layout pattern and an average cell size, but you still have 
to tackle the puzzle of selecting the transmit power level and channel number for each 
AP. The transmit power level will affect the final cell size, and the channel assignment 
will affect co-channel interference and roaming handoff. At this point, if all the APs are 
powered up, they might all end up transmitting at maximum power on the same channel. 
 Figure  13-6    shows one possible scenario; each of the AP cells overlaps its neighbors by 
about 50 percent, and all the APs are fighting to use channel 1!

 Where do you begin to prevent such mayhem? Because the AP locations are already 
nailed down, you can figure out the transmit power level that will give the proper cell 
overlap. Then you can work your way through the AP layout choosing an alternating 
pattern of channel numbers. With six APs, that might not be a daunting task. 
 Do not forget to repeat the task for both 2.4- and 5-GHz bands. 
 Also, if you plan on using 802.11n and 40-MHz channel width, do not forget to reserve 
the extra channels needed for that. Be aware that only the 5-GHz band is capable of sup-
porting wide channels.  
 If you happen to notice that an AP fails one day, you could always reconfigure its neigh-
boring APs to increase their transmit power level to expand their cells and cover the 
hole. 
 If you introduce another AP or two in the future, do not forget to revisit the entire con-
figuration again to make room for cells and channels.  
 Did your life as the wireless LAN administrator just become depressing and tedious? 
Cisco Radio Resource Management (RRM) can handle all these tasks regularly and 
automatically. RRM consists of several algorithms that can look at a large portion of a 

Chapter 13: Understanding RRM  267
wireless network and work out an optimum transmit power level and channel number for 
each AP. If conditions that affect the RF coverage change over time, RRM can detect 
that and make the appropriate adjustments.  
 RF Groups 
 RRM works by monitoring a number of APs and working out optimal RF settings for 
each one. The APs that are included in the RRM algorithms are contained in a single RF 
group. An RF group is formed for each band that is supported—one group for 2.4-GHz 
AP radios and another for 5-GHz AP radios. By default, an RF group contains all the APs 
that are joined to a single controller.  
 You can also configure a controller to automatically populate its RF group. In that case, 
the RF group can expand to include APs from multiple controllers, provided the follow-
ing two conditions are met:  
  ■ 
  The controllers share a common RF group name.
  ■ 
  At least one AP from one controller can be overheard by an AP on another
controller. 
 When an RF group touches more than one controller, the controllers form a type of 
cluster so that they all participate in any RF adjustments that are needed. Every AP 
sends a Neighbor Discovery Packet (NDP) at maximum transmit power and at 60-second 
intervals, by default. If two controllers are close enough in proximity for an AP on one 
to hear an AP on the other at a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of –80 dBm or 
greater, they are close enough to belong to the same RF group. Up to 20 controllers and 
1000 APs can join to form  a single RF group. 
 Figure   13-7    shows a simple scenario with four controllers and four APs, resulting in two 
separate RF groups. AP-1 and AP-2 are both joined to controller WLC-1, so they are 
members of one RF group by default. AP-3, joined to WLC-2, is located near enough 
to AP-1 and AP-2 that neighbor advertisements are overheard. As a result, controller 
WLC-2 joins the RF group with WLC-1. However, AP-4, joined to controller WLC-3, is 
not close enough to pass the neighbor test. Even though AP-4’s cell intersects the cells of 
AP-2 and AP-3, the APs themselves are not within range. Therefore, controller WLC-3  
resides in a different RF group by itself.    
 One controller in each group is elected as an RF group leader, although you can over-
ride that by configuring one controller as a static leader. The leader collects and ana-
lyzes information from all APs in the group about their RF conditions in real time. 
You can access the RF group leader configuration information by selecting  Wireless > 
802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n > RRM > RF Grouping . In  Figure  13-8 , the controller is in 
automatic RF group mode and is a member of an RF group along with two other con-
trollers. The RF group leader is controller WLC-1.

 Radio resource monitoring is used to gather and report information from the APs. Each 
AP is assigned to transmit and receive on a single channel, so it can easily detect noise 
and interference on that channel, as well as the channel utilization. The AP can also keep 
a list of clients and other APs that it hears transmitting on that channel.

 Each AP can also spend a short bit of time (less than 60 ms) tuning its receiver to all of 
the other channels that are available. By scanning channels other than the one normally 
used, an AP can measure noise and interference all across the band from its own vantage 
point. The AP can also detect unexpected transmissions coming from rogue clients and 
APs, or devices that are not formally joined to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network 
(CUWN). 
 Based on the radio resource monitoring data, RRM can make the following decisions 
about APs in an RF group:  
  ■ 
 Transmit power control (TPC)    —RRM can set the transmit power level of each AP.
  ■ 
 Dynamic channel allocation (DCA) —RRM can select the channel number for each
AP. 
  ■ 
 Coverage hole detection mechanism (CHDM) —Based on information gathered 
from client associations, RRM can detect an area with weak RF coverage and
increase an AP’s transmit power level to compensate.
 The RRM algorithms are designed to keep the entire wireless network as stable and effi-
cient as possible. The TPC and DCA algorithms run independently because they perform 
very different functions. By default, the algorithms are run every 600 seconds (10 min-
utes). If conditions in the RF environment change, such as interference or the addition 
or failure of an AP, RRM can discover and react to the changes at the next interval. The 
RRM algorithms are discussed in more detail in the following sections.  
 TPC 
 The TPC algorithm focuses on one goal: setting each AP’s transmit power level to an 
appropriate value so that it offers good coverage for clients while avoiding interfer-
ence with neighboring APs that are using the same channel.  Figure  13-9 illustrates this 
process. APs that were once transmitting too strongly and overlapping each other’s cells 
are adjusted for proper coverage, reducing the cell size more appropriately to support 
clients.  
 Figure 13-9  Basic Concept of the TPC Algorithm. 
 Controllers have no knowledge of the physical location of each AP. By looking at  Figure 
 13-9   , you can see that the APs are arranged in a nice evenly spaced pattern, but the con-

troller cannot see that. When an AP joins a controller, only the AP’s MAC address, IP 
address, and some basic information are advertised to the controller. If the locations of 
neighboring APs cannot be known, each AP must resort to using the RSSI of its neigh-
bors as a measure of how closely their cells touch or overlap its own.  
 During the time each AP scans the channels to listen for RF conditions and other APs, it 
forms a list of its neighbors and their RSSI values. Each of those lists is sent to the local 
controller and on to the RF group leader where they are used by the TPC algorithm.  
 TPC works on one AP at a time, one band at a time. If an AP has been heard with an 
RSSI above a threshold (–70 dBm by default) by at least three of its neighbors, TPC con-
siders the AP’s cell to be overlapping the cells of its three neighbors too much. The AP’s 
transmit power level will be decreased by 3 dB, and then its RSSI will be evaluated again. 
This process is repeated at regular intervals until the neighbor that is measuring the third-
strongest RSSI value for the AP no longer measures the RSSI greater than the threshold  
 Although you probably will not have to make any configuration changes for the TPC 
algorithm, it is still useful to understand its settings. TPC runs on the 2.4- and 5-GHz 
bands independently. You can see the settings by selecting  Wireless > 802.11a/n or 
 802.11b/g/n > RRM > TPC .  Figure   13-10  shows the TPC configuration for the 5-GHz 
802.11a band.  
 Figure 13-10  Adjusting the RRM TPC Algorithm Parameters. 
 By default, TPC runs automatically every 10 minutes. This is the recommended mode 
because any changes in the RF environment can be detected and compensated for with-
out any intervention. As an alternative, you can select  On Demand to run the algorithm 
once at the next 10-minute interval, and then the resulting transmit power levels will be 
frozen until TPC is manually triggered again. If you would rather have the controller set 
the transmit power level on all APs to one fixed value, you can select  Fixed and choose 
the power level from the drop-down menu.  

Chapter 13: Understanding RRM  271
 Cisco controllers determine the transmit power level according to an index from 1 to 
8, rather than discrete dBm or mW values. A value of 1 corresponds to the maximum 
power level that is allowed in the AP’s regulatory domain. You can use  Table  13-2 
to correlate the power levels used in the 2.4-GHz band in the Americas or European 
domains to more familiar real-world values.

 With every iteration, the TPC algorithm can continue adjusting the transmit power levels 
until no further changes are needed. As a result, some APs might end up higher or lower 
than you might want. For example, it is usually best to match the AP transmit power 
level with that of the clients. Suppose that some of the clients have a fixed power level 
of 25 mW; if TPC ends up reducing some APs to 10 mW, the AP and client power levels 
will be mismatched.  
 To prevent such a condition, you can set minimum and maximum power level boundar-
ies for the TPC algorithm. By default, the minimum level is set to –10 dBm and the maxi-
mum to 30 dBm, as shown in  Figure  13-10 . 
 Whenever you change the TPC parameters in a controller configuration, remember to 
make the same changes to all controllers that might be members of the same RF group. 
No matter which controller might become the RF group leader, the parameters will be 
identical. 
 Tip  What transmit power level does an AP use when it first powers up? A new AP right 
out of the box will power up at its maximum power level. After the TPC algorithm has 
run and adjusted an AP’s power level, that level is remembered the next time the AP is 
power cycled.

 DCA 
 Recall from  Chapter  7 , “Planning Coverage with Wireless APs,” and  Chapter  12 , 
“Understanding Roaming,” that a proper channel assignment is vital for efficient use of 
air time and for client mobility. When neighboring APs use the same channel, they can 
interfere with each other. Ideally, adjacent APs should use different, non-overlapping 
channels. Working out a channel layout for many APs can be a difficult puzzle, but 
the DCA algorithm can work out optimum solutions automatically for all APs in an RF 
group. 
 When a new AP first powers up, it uses the first non-overlapping channel in each band—
channel 1 for 2.4 GHz and channel 36 for 5 GHz. Consider a simplistic scenario where 
all APs are new and powered up for the first time. You would end up with a building 
full of overlapping cells competing for the use of 2.4-GHz channel 1, as shown in simpli-
fied form in  Figure   13-11   . The DCA algorithm works to correct this situation by find-
ing a channel that each AP in the RF group can use without overlapping or interfering 
with other APs. Like TPC, DCA  works out one channel layout in the 2.4-GHz band and 
another layout in the 5-GHz band.

 Figure 13-11  Basic Concept of the DCA Algorithm. 
 DCA does not just solve the channel layout puzzle once for all APs. The algorithm runs 
every 10 minutes by default, so that it can detect any conditions that might require an 
AP’s channel to change. APs in the RF group are monitored for the metrics listed in 
 Table  13-3    that can influence the channel reassignment decision.

 If an interference source with a high

DCA may choose to avoid using it. 
 The DCA algorithm tends to look at each AP individually to find the ones with the worst 
RF conditions. Changing the channel of even one AP can affect many other APs if there 
are not other alternative channels available. Channel layout is a puzzle that may require 
several iterations to solve. For this reason, the controller that is the RF group leader will 
undergo an RRM startup mode after it is elected. The startup mode consists of ten DCA 
iterations at 10-minute intervals, or a total of 100 minutes before the channel layout 
reaches a steady state.  
 The end result of DCA is a channel layout that takes a variety of conditions into 
account. The channel layout is not just limited to the two dimensions of a single floor 
space in a building; it also extends to three-dimensional space because the RF signals 
from one floor can bleed through to another. As long as the APs on different floors 
belong to the same RF group, co-channel interference between them should be mini-
mized. 
 You can display and configure the DCA parameters of either the 2.4- or 5-GHz band by 
selecting  Wireless > 802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n > RRM > DCA .  Figure  13-12 shows 
the 802.11a configuration.  
 By default, the DCA algorithm runs automatically at 10-minute intervals. You can change 
the interval time, select  Freeze  to run DCA manually on demand, or turn it  Off com-
pletely. You can also select the conditions to avoid, which will trigger a channel change 
on an AP.  
 The DCA parameters also include the 802.11n channel width. By default, 20-MHz chan-
nels will be used. If you have enabled 802.11n in the 5-GHz band and want to enable 
40-MHz channels, be sure to select  40 MHz  as the channel width.  
 The bottom portion of the web page contains a list of channels that DCA can use as it 
assigns channels to APs in the respective band. This list is populated with channel num-
bers by default, but you can edit the list as needed. You can also enable or disable indi-
vidual channel use by using the list of  Select check boxes. 
 The DCA algorithm normally runs on an automatic schedule or manually on demand. 
Event-Driven RRM (ED-RRM) takes this a step further; DCA can be triggered based 
on RF events that occur in real time. The CleanAir feature, covered in more detail in 
 Chapter   19   , “Dealing with Wireless Interference,” provides the triggers for ED-RRM. By 
default, ED-RRM is disabled. You can enable it with the  EDRRM check box at the very 
bottom of the web page.

 Coverage Hole Detection 
 The TPC algorithm normally reduces AP transmit power levels to make cell sizes appro-
priate. Sometimes you might find that your best intentions at providing RF coverage 
with a good AP layout still come up short. For example, you might discover that signals 
are weak in some small area of a building due to the building construction or surround-
ing obstacles. You might also have an AP radio that happens to fail, causing a larger 
coverage hole. How would you discover such a condition? You could make a habit of 
surveying the RF coverage often. More likely, your wireless users will discover  a weak-
ness or hole in the coverage and complain to you about it. 
 The Cisco CUWN offers an additional RRM algorithm that can detect coverage holes 
and take action to address them. Coverage hole detection mechanism (CHDM) can alert 
you to a hole that it has discovered and it can increase an AP’s transmit power level to 
compensate for the hole.  
 Figure 13-12  Adjusting the RRM DCA Algorithm Parameters. 

Chapter 13: Understanding RRM  275
 Coverage hole detection is useful in two cases: 
  ■ 
  Extending coverage in a weak area
  ■ 
  Healing a coverage hole caused by an AP or radio failure
 The algorithm does not run at regular intervals like TPC and DCA do. Instead, it moni-
tors the RF conditions of wireless clients and decides when to take action. In effect, 
the algorithm leverages your wireless users who are out in the field and tries to notice a 
problem before they do.  
 Every controller maintains a database of associated clients and their RSSI and signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) values. It might seem logical to think that a low RSSI or SNR would 
mean a client is experiencing a hole in coverage. Assuming the client and its AP are using 
the same transmit power levels, if the AP is receiving the client at a low level, the client 
must also be receiving the AP at a low level. This might not be true at all; the client might 
just be exiting the building and getting too far away from the AP. The client might  also 
have a “sticky” roaming behavior, where it maintains an association with one AP until the 
RSSI falls to a very low level before reassociating elsewhere.  
 Coverage hole detection tries to rule out conditions that are experienced by small num-
bers of clients and signal conditions due to client roaming behavior. A valid coverage 
hole is detected when some number of clients, all associated to the same AP, have RSSI 
values that fall below a threshold. In addition, the coverage hole condition must exist 
longer than a threshold of time without the client roaming to a different AP.   
 By default, the following conditions must all be met for a coverage hole to be detected:  
  ■ 
  Client RSSI at the AP is at or below –80 dBm.
  ■ 
  The low RSSI condition must last at least 60 seconds over the past 180 seconds.
  ■ 
  The condition must affect at least three clients or more than 25 percent of the cli-
ents on a single AP.
 Be aware that the coverage hole detection runs on a per-band basis. Unlike TPC and 
DCA, which operate on the entire RF group of controllers, coverage hole detection runs 
on each controller independently. 
 You can display and configure the coverage hole detection thresholds by selecting 
 Wireless > 802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n > RRM > Coverage .  Figure  13-13 shows the 
threshold parameters for the 5-GHz 802.11a band.

 Manual RF Configuration 
 You might sometimes want to keep RRM from changing the RF conditions in parts of 
your wireless network. For instance, you might have client devices that operate at a 
fixed transmit power level. Ideally, the AP and client power levels should be identical 
or matched. If RRM raises or lowers AP power levels at a later time, then asymmetric 
power levels would result. 
 You can override RRM on a per-AP basis by selecting  Wireless > Access Points > 
Radios > 802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n . From the list of APs displayed, choose a specific 
AP and select the drop-down menu at the far-right side of the list. From this menu, 
select  Configure , as shown in  Figure  13-14 . 
 On the AP configuration page, as shown in  Figure  13-15 , you can set the channel under 
RF Channel Assignment or the transmit power under Tx Power Level Assignment. By 
default, the  Global  radio button is selected for each, which allows the value to be deter-
mined globally within the RF group. You can set a specific channel or power level by 
selecting the  Custom  radio button and then choosing a value from the drop-down list. In 
the figure, the AP’s transmit power level has been manually set to 3.

 Tip  You should let RRM automatically adjust both channels and transmit power levels 
whenever possible. 
 Verifying RRM Results 
 The RRM algorithms can either run at regular intervals or on demand. You can dis-
play the channel number and transmit power level that are being used on every AP by 
selecting  Wireless > Access Points > Radios > 802.11a/n or  802.11b/g/n , as shown 
in  Figure   13-15   . The controller displays an asterisk next to values that have been set 
through RRM. Otherwise, if no asterisk appears, the value has been set manually.  
 To get a much better feel for the RRM results, you can use the CUWN management 
system (Cisco Network Control System [NCS] or Prime Infrastructure [PI], as covered in 
 Chapters   18    through    20   ) to view APs on a graphical representation of an area. The NCS 
map in  Figure   13-16    displays each AP’s location on a building floor plan, along with its 
channel number and transmit power level. Seeing the physical arrangement of APs and 
their cells can help you get a much better idea how the channels are assigned and reused.

 As you know by now, wireless networks are complex. Many technologies and protocols 
work behind the scenes to give end users a stable, yet mobile, connection to a wired net-
work infrastructure. From the user’s perspective, a wireless connection should seem no 
different than a wired connection. A wired connection can give users a sense of security; 
data traveling over a wire is probably not going to be overheard by others. A wireless 
connection is inherently different; data traveling over the air can be overheard by any-
one within range.  
 Therefore, securing a wireless network becomes just as important as any other aspect. A 
comprehensive approach to wireless security focuses on the following areas: 
  ■ 
 Identifying the endpoints of a wireless connection
  ■ 
 Identifying the end user 
  ■ 
 Protecting the wireless data from eavesdroppers
  ■ 
 Protecting the wireless data from tampering
 The identification process is performed through various authentication schemes. 
Protecting wireless data involves security functions like encryption and frame authenti-
cation. 
 This chapter covers many of the methods you can use to secure a wireless network. 
Be warned—wireless security can be a confusing topic because it is filled with many 
acronyms. Some of the acronyms rhyme like words from a children’s book. In fact, this 
chapter is a story about WEP, PSK, TKIP, MIC, AES, EAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, LEAP, 
PEAP, WPA, WPA2, CCMP, and on and on it goes. When you finish with this chapter, 
though, you will come away with a clear view of what these terms mean and how they all 
fit together.  
 As a CCNA Wireless engineer, you will need to have a basic understanding of the wire-
less security framework and the common methods you can use to build it. You will also 
need to know how to configure the most robust methods in a wireless network.

 Foundation Topics 
 Anatomy of a Secure Connection 
 In the previous chapters of this book, you have learned about wireless clients forming 
associations with wireless access points (APs) and passing data back and forth across the 
air. The main focus has been on the radio frequency (RF) conditions, the modulation 
schemes, and the management of airtime that are all necessary to send data from one 
place to another successfully. 
 As long as all clients and APs conform to the 802.11 standard, they can all coexist—even 
on the same channel. Not every 802.11 device is friendly and trustworthy, however. 
Sometimes it is easy to forget that transmitted frames do not just go directly from the 
sender to the receiver, as in a wired or switched connection. Instead, they travel accord-
ing to the transmitter’s antenna pattern, potentially reaching any receiver that is within 
range. 
 Consider the scenario in  Figure   14-1   . The wireless client opens a session with some 
remote entity and shares a confidential password. Because two untrusted users are also 
located within range of the client’s signal, they may also learn the password by capturing 
frames that have been sent on the channel. The convenience of wireless communication 
also makes it easy for transmissions to be overheard and exploited by malicious users.

 If data is sent through open space, how can it be secured so that it stays private and 
intact? The 802.11 standard offers a framework of wireless security mechanisms that 

286  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
can be used to add trust, privacy, and integrity to a wireless network. A Cisco Unified 
Wireless Network (CUWN) can go even further by detecting and preventing malicious 
activity. The following sections give an overview of the wireless security framework. 
Each element is described in more detail later in the chapter.  
 Authentication 
 In  Chapter   6   , “Understanding 802.11 Frame Types,” you learned that wireless clients 
must discover a basic service set (BSS) and then request permission to associate with it. 
Clients should be authenticated by some means before they can become functioning 
members of the wireless LAN. Why?  
 Suppose that your wireless network connects to corporate resources where confidential 
information can be accessed. In that case, only devices known to be trusted and expect-
ed should be given access. Guest users, if they are permitted at all, should be allowed to 
join a different guest WLAN where they can access nonconfidential or public resources. 
Rogue clients, which are not expected or welcomed, should not be permitted to associ-
ate at all. After all, they are not affiliated with the corporate network and are likely to be 
unknown devices that happen to be within range of your network.  
 To control access, wireless networks can authenticate the client devices before they are 
allowed to associate. Potential clients must identify themselves by presenting some form 
of credentials to the APs.  Figure   14-2    shows the basic client authentication process. 
Who are you?
I am Joe User.
Ok.
AP
 Figure 14-2  Authenticating a Wireless Client. 
 Wireless authentication can take many forms. Some methods require only a static text 
string that is common across all trusted clients and APs. The text string is stored on 
the client device and presented directly to the AP when needed. What might happen 
if the device was stolen or lost? Most likely, any user who possessed the device could 
still authenticate to the network. Other more stringent authentication methods require 
interaction with a corporate user database. In those cases, the end user must enter a valid 
username and password—something that would not be known to a thief or an imposter. 
 If you have ever joined a wireless network, you might have focused on authenticating 
your device or yourself, while implicitly trusting the nearest AP. For example, if you 
turn on your wireless device and find a wireless network that is available at your work-
place, you probably join it without hesitating. The same is true for wireless networks in 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  287
an airport, a hotel, a hot spot, or in your home—you expect the AP that is advertising 
the SSID to be owned and operated by the entity where you are located. But how can 
you be sure?  
 Normally, the only piece of information you have is the SSID being broadcast or adver-
tised by an AP. If the SSID looks familiar, you will likely choose to join it. Perhaps your 
computer is configured to automatically connect to a known SSID so that it associates 
without your intervention. Either way, you might unwittingly join the same SSID even if 
it was being advertised by an imposter.  
 Some common attacks focus on a malicious user pretending to be an AP. The fake AP 
can send beacons, answer probes, and associate clients just like the real AP it is imper-
sonating. Once a client associates with the fake AP, the attacker can easily intercept all 
communication to and from the client from its central position. A fake AP could also 
send spoofed management frames to disassociate or deauthenticate legitimate and active 
clients, just to disrupt normal network operation.  
 To prevent this type of man-in-the-middle attack, the client should authenticate the AP 
before it associates.  Figure   14-3    shows a simple scenario. Even further, any management 
frames received by a client should be authenticated too, as proof that they were sent by 
a legitimate and expected AP.  
Who are you?
I am AP-1.
These are my
management frames. 
Ok.
AP-1
 Figure 14-3  Authenticating a Wireless AP. 
 Message Privacy 
 Suppose that the client in  Figure   14-3 must authenticate before joining the wireless net-
work. It might also authenticate the AP and its management frames. The client’s relation-
ship with the AP might become much more trusted, but data passing to and from the 
client is still available to eavesdroppers on the same channel.  
 To protect data privacy on a wireless network, the data should be encrypted for its 
journey through free space. This is accomplished by encrypting the data payload in each 
wireless frame just prior to being transmitted, then decrypting it as it is received. The 
idea is to use an encryption method that the transmitter and receiver share, so the data 
can be encrypted and decrypted successfully.  
 In wireless networks, each WLAN supports only one authentication and encryption 
scheme, so all clients must use the same encryption method when they associate. You 

288  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
might think that having one encryption method in common would allow every client to 
eavesdrop on every other client. That is not necessarily the case because the AP should 
securely negotiate an encryption key to use for each associated client.  
 Ideally, the AP and a client are the only two devices that have the encryption keys in 
common so that they can understand each other’s data. No other device should know 
about or be able to use the same keys to eavesdrop and decrypt the data. In  Figure   14-4   , 
the client’s confidential password information has been encrypted before being transmit-
ted. The AP can decrypt it successfully before forwarding it onto the wired network, but 
other wireless devices cannot.  
 The AP also maintains a “group key” that it uses when it needs to send encrypted data to 
all clients in its cell at one time. Each of the associated clients uses the same group key 
to decrypt the data.

 Figure 14-4  Encrypting Wireless Data to Protect Data Privacy. 
 Message Integrity 
 Encrypting data obscures it from view while it is traveling over a public or untrusted 
network. The intended recipient should be able to decrypt the message and recover the 
original contents, but what if someone managed to alter the contents along the way? The 
recipient would have a very difficult time discovering that the original data had been 
modified. 
 A message integrity check (MIC) is a security tool that can protect against data tam-
pering. You can think of MIC as a way for the sender to add a secret stamp inside the 
encrypted data frame. The stamp is based on the contents of the data bits to be transmit-
ted. Once the recipient decrypts the frame, it can compare the secret stamp to its own 
idea of what the stamp should be, based on the data bits that were received. If the two 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  289
stamps are identical, the recipient can safely assume that the data has not been tampered 
with.  Figure 14-5 shows the MIC process.

 Intrusion Protection 
 Many of the tools in the wireless security framework operate as choreographed steps 
between a client and an AP. Because both the client and the AP are active participants in 
securing the connection between them, the data they are exchanging can be protected. 
In other words, much of the security framework focuses on keeping attackers from join-
ing the wireless network and from tampering with existing associations.  
 Wireless attacks do not stop there; they can involve malicious activity from a variety 
of angles or vectors. A wireless intrusion protection system (wIPS) can monitor wireless 
activity and compare that against a database of known signatures or patterns. Cisco APs 
can recognize some signatures and inform their controllers. Controllers also have a set 
of signatures that can match against data coming from many APs. The Cisco Wireless 
Control System (WCS), Cisco Prime Network Control System (NCS), and Cisco Prime 
Infrastructure (PI) are wireless management systems that can go even further by recog-
nizing a rich set of signatures, implementing customizable wIPS policies, and integrating 
with Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) for granular analysis.  Chapter  18 , “Managing 
Wireless Networks with WCS,” discusses these management platforms in greater detail.  
 For the CCNA Wireless exam, you should understand the basics of wireless IPS. Know 
that wireless security threats can be grouped into the following categories:  
  ■ 
 Rogue devices 
  ■ 
 Ad hoc networks 
  ■ 
 Client association issues 
  ■ 
 Passive or active attacks 
 Despite your best efforts to configure and secure every piece of your wireless network, 
someone could always bring in his own AP or wireless router and connect it to the wired 
network. A rogue AP is one that is not part of your wireless infrastructure but that is 

290  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
close enough to be overheard or to cause interference. Any clients that associate with a 
rogue AP are known as  rogue clients . Cisco controllers can discover both. 
 Controllers can collect beacon information that is overheard by legitimate APs. Rogue 
detection algorithms running on the controllers and WCS/NCS can classify APs as rogue 
if they do not appear in the database of APs known to your network. As a wireless 
network administrator, you can override the classification and declare an AP as either 
friendly or rogue.  
 When coupled with an MSE, the wIPS can locate rogue APs so that you can go and find 
them. The wIPS process can even transmit special probe frames to determine if a rogue 
AP is connected to your wired network. This happens if the probe frames are received 
by the rogue over the air and then delivered back to the controller through the wired 
network. 
 The wIPS can go one step further and attempt to contain the rogue so that it does not 
become a security risk to your own network. Over-the-air rogue containment works 
by listening for any wireless clients that associate with a rogue AP. The controller then 
sends spoofed deauthentication frames to those clients so that they think the rogue AP 
has dropped them.  
 Based on information gathered by the controllers, wIPS can detect many types of wire-
less network attacks. Attacks can range from completely passive, such as an eavesdrop-
per silently capturing wireless frames, to active ones that attempt to disrupt wireless 
service. For example, an attacker might send a flood of association requests to an AP 
to overwhelm it with fake potential clients—to the point where the AP can no longer 
service real clients. Another type of attack is similar to Cisco’s rogue containment, where 
the attacker sends spoofed deauthentication frames to legitimate clients to continually 
knock them off the network.  
 Tip  Although you should not need to know the specifics about wIPS and attack sig-
natures, you can investigate further on your own by navigating to  Security > Wireless 
Protection Policies  on a controller and  Configure > wIPS Profiles on WCS/NCS. 
 Wireless Client Authentication Methods 
 You can use many different methods to authenticate wireless clients as they try to asso-
ciate with the network. The methods have been introduced over time, and have evolved 
as security weaknesses have been exposed and wireless hardware has advanced. This sec-
tion covers the most common authentication methods you might encounter. 
 Open Authentication 
 In  Chapter   6   , you learned about the frames that are used when a client asks to join a 
wireless network. The original 802.11 standard offered only two choices to authenticate 
a client: open authentication and WEP.  

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  291
 Open authentication is true to its name; it offers open access to a WLAN. The only 
requirement is that a client must use an 802.11 authentication request before it attempts 
to associate with an AP. No other credentials are needed. 
 When would you want to use open authentication? After all, it does not sound very 
secure, because it is not. With no challenge, any client may authenticate to access the 
network. This strategy is most often used in public places that offer wireless hot spots. 
If any client screening is used at all, it comes in the form of web authentication. A client 
can associate right away, but must open a web browser to see and accept the terms for 
use and enter basic credentials. From that point, network access is opened up for the 
client. 
 You have probably seen a WLAN with open authentication when you have visited a 
public location. Most client operating systems flag such networks to warn you that 
your wireless data will not be secured in any way if you join.  Figure  14-6 shows an open 
WLAN discovered on a Windows-based client. Notice the shield-shaped caution icon 
and the security type Unsecured.  
 Figure 14-6  Discovering a WLAN with Open Authentication. 
 WEP 
 As you might expect, open authentication offers nothing that can obscure or encrypt the 
data being sent between a client and an AP. As an alternative, the 802.11 standard has 
traditionally defined the Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) as a method to make a wire-
less link more like or equivalent to a wired connection. 
 WEP uses the RC4 cipher algorithm to make every wireless data frame private and hid-
den from eavesdroppers. The same algorithm encrypts data at the sender and decrypts 
it at the receiver. The algorithm uses a string of bits as a key, commonly called a WEP 
key, to derive other encryption keys—one per wireless frame. As long as the sender and 
receiver have an identical key, one can decrypt what the other encrypts.  

292  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 You can configure up to four WEP keys to be used on a WLAN, although only one of 
them can be active. The key number is included in the wireless frame so that the sender 
and receiver can know which one of the four to use. 
 WEP is known as a shared-key security method. The same key must be shared between 
the sender and receiver ahead of time, so that each can derive other mutually agreeable 
encryption keys. In fact, every potential client and AP must share the same key ahead of 
time so that any client can associate with the AP.  
 The WEP key can also be used as an optional authentication method as well as an 
encryption tool. Unless a client can use the correct WEP key, it cannot associate with an 
AP. The AP tests the client’s knowledge of the WEP key by sending it a random chal-
lenge phrase. The client encrypts the challenge phrase with WEP and returns the result 
to the AP. The AP can compare the client’s encryption with its own to see whether the 
two WEP keys yield identical results.  
 WEP keys can be either 40 or 104 bits long, represented by a string of 10 or 26 hex 
digits. As a rule of thumb, longer keys offer more unique bits for the algorithm, result-
ing in more robust encryption. Except in WEP’s case, that is. Because WEP was defined 
in the original 802.11 standard in 1999, every wireless adapter was built with encryp-
tion hardware specific to WEP. In 2001, a number of weaknesses were discovered and 
revealed, so work began to find better wireless security methods. By 2004, the 802.11i 
amendment was ratified and WEP was officially deprecated. Both WEP  encryption and 
WEP shared-key authentication are widely considered to be weak methods to secure a 
wireless LAN.  
 You might think such a clear call to move away from a weak or flawed security method 
would be easy and quick to achieve. In practice, it has taken many years to move away 
from WEP. Why?  
 Because WEP was implemented in wireless adapter hardware, any better security 
schemes had to leverage variations of WEP without the benefit of new cryptographic 
hardware. Wireless hardware manufacturers are usually reluctant to commit to build 
products until the technology is firmly established in the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
Therefore, WEP was an underlying theme for a very long time. In fact, for backward 
compatibility, you will still find it supported by clients, APs, and controllers even today. 
As you work through the rest of this chapter, notice how wireless security schemes have 
evolved and improved, and notice how many of them leverage WEP to some extent. 
 802.1x/EAP 
 With only open authentication and WEP available in the original 802.11 standard, 
a more secure authentication method was needed. Client authentication generally 
involves some sort of challenge, a response, and then a decision to grant access. Behind 
the scenes, it can also involve an exchange of session or encryption keys, in addition 
to other parameters needed for client access. Each authentication method might have 
unique requirements as a unique way to pass information between the client and the AP. 
 Rather than build additional authentication methods into the 802.11 standard, a more 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  293
flexible and scalable authentication framework, the Extensible Authentication Protocol 
(EAP), was chosen. As its name implies, EAP is extensible and does not consist of any 
one authentication method. Instead, EAP defines a set of common functions that actual 
authentication methods can use to authenticate users. As you read through this section, 
notice how many authentication methods have  EAP in their names. Each method is 
unique and different, but each one follows the EAP framework. 
 EAP has another interesting quality: It can integrate with the IEEE 802.1x port-based 
access control standard. When 802.1x is enabled, it limits access to a network media 
until a client authenticates through an EAP method. This means that a wireless client 
might be able to associate with an AP, but will not be able to pass data to any other part 
of the network until it successfully authenticates.  
 With open and WEP authentication, wireless clients are authenticated locally at the AP 
without further intervention. The scenario changes with 802.1x; the client uses open 
authentication to associate with the AP, and then the actual client authentication process 
occurs at a dedicated authentication server.  Figure  14-7 shows the three-party 802.1x 
arrangement that consists of the following entities:  
  ■ 
 Supplicant    —The client device that is requesting access
  ■ 
 Authenticator    —The network device that provides access to the network (usually a
wireless LAN controller [WLC]) 
  ■ 
 Authentication Server (AS)    —The device that takes user or client credentials and
permits or denies network access based on a user database and policies (usually a
RADIUS server)

 The following sections provide an overview of several common EAP-based authentica-
tion methods. 
Key 
Topic

294  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 LEAP 
 As an early attempt to address the weaknesses in WEP, Cisco developed a proprietary 
wireless authentication method called Lightweight EAP (LEAP). To authenticate, the cli-
ent must supply username and password credentials. Both the authentication server and 
the client exchange challenge messages that are then encrypted and returned. This pro-
vides mutual authentication; as long as the messages can be decrypted successfully, the 
client and the AS have essentially authenticated each other.  
 At the time, WEP-based hardware was still widely used. Therefore, LEAP attempted 
to overcome WEP weaknesses by using dynamic WEP keys that changed frequently. 
Nevertheless, the method used to encrypt the challenge messages was found to be vul-
nerable, so LEAP has since been deprecated. Even though wireless clients and controllers 
still offer LEAP, you should not use it.   
 EAP-FAST 
 Cisco developed a more secure method called EAP Flexible Authentication by Secure 
Tunneling (EAP-FAST). Authentication credentials are protected by passing a protected 
access credential (PAC) between the AS and the supplicant. The PAC is a form of shared 
secret that is generated by the AS and used for mutual authentication.  
 After the supplicant and AS have authenticated each other, they negotiate a Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) tunnel. The end user can then be authenticated through the TLS 
tunnel for additional security.  
 Notice that two separate authentication processes occur in EAP-FAST—one between 
the AS and the supplicant and another with the end user. These occur in a nested fash-
ion, as an outer authentication (outside the TLS tunnel) and an inner authentication 
(inside the TLS tunnel).  
 Like other EAP-based methods, a RADIUS server is required. However, the RADIUS 
server must also operate as an EAP-FAST server to be able to generate PACs, one per 
user. EAP-FAST has a known vulnerability, but is still considered to be secure provided 
that rogue APs and supplicants are managed well. 
 PEAP 
 Like EAP-FAST, the Protected EAP (PEAP) method uses an inner and outer authentica-
tion; however, the AS presents a digital certificate to authenticate itself with the suppli-
cant in the outer authentication. If the supplicant is satisfied with the identity of the AS, 
the two will build a TLS tunnel to be used for the inner client authentication and encryp-
tion key exchange.  
 The digital certificate of the AS consists of data in a standard format that identifies the 
owner and is “signed” or validated by a third party. The third party is known as a cer-
tificate authority (CA) and is known and trusted by both the AS and the supplicants. 
The supplicant must also possess the CA certificate just so that it can validate the one 
it receives from the AS. The certificate is also used to pass a public key, in plain view, 
which can be used to help decrypt messages from the AS.  

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  295
 Notice that only the AS has a certificate for PEAP. That means the supplicant can readily 
authenticate the AS. The client does not have or use a certificate of its own, so it must 
be authenticated within the TLS tunnel using one of the following two methods:  
  ■ 
 MSCHAPv2 —Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol 
  ■ 
 GTC    —Generic Token Card; a hardware device that generates one-time passwords
for the user or a manually generated password
 EAP-TLS 
 PEAP leverages a digital certificate on the AS as a robust method to authenticate the 
RADIUS server. It is easy to obtain and install a certificate on a single server, but the cli-
ents are left to identify themselves through other means. EAP Transport Layer Security 
(EAP-TLS) goes one step further by requiring certificates on the AS and on every client 
device. 
 With EAP-TLS, the AS and the supplicant exchange certificates and can authenticate 
each other. A TLS tunnel is built afterward so that the client can be authenticated and 
encryption key material can be securely exchanged. 
 EAP-TLS is considered to be the most secure wireless authentication method available; 
however, implementing it can sometimes be complex. Along with the AS, each wireless 
client must obtain and install a certificate. Manually installing certificates on hundreds 
or thousands of clients can be impractical. Instead, you would need to implement a 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that could supply certificates securely and efficiently and 
revoke them when a client or user should no longer have access to the network. This usu-
ally involves setting up your own CA or building a trust relationship with a third-party 
CA that can supply certificates to  your clients.  
 Tip  EAP-TLS is practical only if the wireless clients can accept and use digital certifi-
cates. Many wireless devices, such as communicators, medical devices, and RFID tags, 
have an underlying operating system that cannot interface with a CA or use certificates. 
 Wireless Privacy and Integrity Methods 
 The original 802.11 standard supported only one method to secure wireless data from 
eavesdroppers: WEP. As you have learned in this chapter, WEP has been compromised, 
deprecated, and can no longer be recommended. What other options are available to 
encrypt data and protect its integrity as it travels through free space?  
 TKIP 
 During the time when WEP was embedded in wireless client and AP hardware, yet was 
known to be vulnerable, the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was developed. 

296  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
TKIP is the product of the 802.11i working group and the Wi-Fi Alliance.  
 TKIP adds the following security features using legacy hardware and the underlying 
WEP encryption:  
  ■ 
 MIC    —An efficient algorithm to add a hash value to each frame as a message integ-
rity check to prevent tampering; commonly called Michael” as an informal reference
to MIC. 
  ■ 
 Time stamp    —A time stamp is added into the MIC to prevent replay attacks that
attempt to reuse or replay frames that have already been sent 
  ■ 
 Sender’s MAC address    —The MIC also includes the sender’s MAC address as evi-
dence of the frame source. 
  ■ 
 TKIP sequence counter    —Provides a record of frames sent by a unique MAC
address, to prevent frames from being replayed as an attack.
  ■ 
 Key mixing algorithm    —Computes a unique 128-bit WEP key for each frame.
  ■ 
 Longer Initialization Vector (IV)    —The IV size is doubled from 24 to 48 bits, mak-
ing it virtually impossible to exhaust all WEP keys by brute force calculation. 
 TKIP became a reasonably secure stopgap security method, buying time until the 
802.11i standard could be ratified. Some attacks have been created against TKIP, so it, 
too, should be avoided if a better method is available. In fact, TKIP was deprecated in 
the 802.11-2012 standard. 
 CCMP 
 The Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) is that better method. CCMP consists of two 
algorithms: 
  ■ 
 AES counter mode encryption 
  ■ 
 Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) used as a mes-
sage integrity check 
 The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the current encryption algorithm adopted 
by U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. govern-
ment, and widely used around the world. In other words, AES is open, publicly acces-
sible, and represents the most secure encryption method available today. 
 Before CCMP can be used to secure a wireless network, the client devices and APs must 
support the AES counter mode and CBC-MAC in hardware. CCMP cannot be used on 
legacy devices that support only WEP or TKIP. How can you know if a device supports 
CCMP? Look for the WPA2 designation, which is described in the following section.  

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  297
 WPA and WPA2 
 This chapter covers a variety of authentication methods and encryption and message 
integrity algorithms. When it comes time to configure a WLAN with wireless security, 
should you try to select some combination of schemes based on which one is best or 
which one is not deprecated? Which authentication methods are compatible with which 
encryption algorithms?  
 The Wi-Fi Alliance has worked out a couple of ways to do that. The IEEE 802.11i stan-
dard defines best practice wireless security methods. While that standard was still being 
developed, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced its Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) industry 
standard. WPA was based on parts of 802.11i and included 802.1x authentication, TKIP, 
and a method for dynamic encryption key management. 
 Once 802.11i was ratified and published, the Wi-Fi Alliance included it in full in its 
WPA Version 2 (WPA2) standard. WPA2 offers the capabilities of WPA, to be back-
ward compatible, while adding the superior CCMP algorithms.  Table  14-2 summarizes 
the simple differences between WPA and WPA2.

 Notice that WPA and WPA2 specify 802.1x, which implies EAP-based authentication, 
but they do not require any specific EAP method. Instead, the Wi-Fi Alliance certifies 
interoperability with methods like EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-SIM. 
 The WPA and WPA2 standards also support two authentication modes, based on the 
scale of the deployment:  
 ■ 
 Personal mode    —A pre-shared key is used to authenticate clients on a WLAN.
  ■ 
 Enterprise mode    —An 802.1x EAP-based authentication method must be used to
authenticate clients. 
 Tip  Personal mode is usually easier to deploy in a small environment or with clients 
that are embedded in certain devices. Be aware that every device using the WLAN must 
be configured with an identical pre-shared key. If you ever need to update or change the 
key, you must touch every device.

 Securing Management Frames with MFP 
 Normally, APs send 802.11 management frames on a BSS with no effort to secure the 
contents. When clients receive management frames, they assume that the frames were 
sent by legitimate APs that control their own BSSs. Malicious users can exploit this 
implicit trust by crafting their own spoofed management frames that appear to come 
from actual APs.  
 To mitigate attacks that leverage AP management frames, Cisco developed Management 
Frame Protection (MFP), which is available in the following two forms: 
  ■ 
 Infrastructure MFP    —To protect the integrity of management frames, APs add
a MIC toward the end of each frame; other neighboring APs also participating in
infrastructure MFP can determine whether overheard management frames have
been tampered with and can alert their controllers.
  ■ 
 Client MFP    —Protects the integrity of management frames through a MIC and
encryption that only associated clients and neighboring APs can understand. 
 Notice that infrastructure MFP is based on a coordinated effort of APs only. 
Participating APs compute and tag management frames with a MIC value and then listen 
to detect any evidence of tampering. Wireless clients cannot participate.  
 Client MFP, in contrast, uses a MIC to protect management frame integrity and adds 
end-to-end encryption to protect the privacy of management frame contents. Clients 
must be capable of participating too, to decrypt the management frames and validate 
the MIC value. Clients using MFP can safely ignore any disassociation, deauthentication, 
and WMM quality of service action frames that are broadcast and any unicast frames 
that are not signed.  
 Clients must support CCXv5 and must use WPA2 with either TKIP or CCMP. This 
implies that the clients already have a secure relationship with the AP. This same secure 
link is used to send trusted management frames. The frames are encrypted in a way that 
only the MFP-capable client can understand. 
 Configuring Wireless Security 
 Wireless security is fairly straightforward to configure. Each WLAN has its own security 
policies. You can configure the security settings when you create a new WLAN or you 
can edit the parameters of an existing one. Keep in mind that you should use WPA2 
and CCMP as a best practice. You can select personal or enterprise mode based on your 
environment and its security policies.  
 According to the CCNA Wireless exam blueprint, you should know how to configure 
WPA and WPA2 with pre-shared keys and 802.1x. You should also know how to con-
figure EAP and RADIUS support on Cisco wireless LAN controllers. These topics are 
covered in the following sections.  

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  299
 Tip  Wireless security methods are configured on a per-WLAN basis. The configuration 
steps you learn in this chapter will be applied in  Chapter  15 , “Configuring a WLAN.” 
 Configuring WPA or WPA2 Personal 
 You can configure WPA or WPA2 personal mode and the pre-shared key in one step. 
Navigate to  WLANs  and select  Create New or select the WLAN ID of an existing 
WLAN to edit. Make sure that the parameters on the General tab are set appropriately.  
 Next, select the  Security > Layer 2  tab. In the Layer 2 Security drop-down menu, 
select  WPA+WPA2 , as shown in  Figure  14-8 for the WLAN named secure. In the 
WPA+WPA2 Parameters section of the Layer 2 page, you can enable WPA or WPA2 
with the  WPA Policy  and  WPA2 Policy check boxes. In  Figure  14-9 , WPA2 has been 
selected. Be sure to select  AES  or  TKIP as the WPA2 encryption type. 
 Tip  The controller will allow you to enable both WPA and WPA2 check boxes. You 
should do that only if you have legacy clients that require WPA support and are mixed in 
with newer WPA2 clients. Be aware that the WLAN will only be as secure as the weakest 
security suite you configure on it. Ideally, you should use WPA2 with AES/CCMP and 
try to avoid any other hybrid mode. Hybrid modes such as WPA with AES and WPA2 
with TKIP can cause compatibility issues; in addition, they will likely be deprecated soon. 
 Figure 14-8  Selecting the WPA+WPA2 Security Suite for a WLAN. 

300  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 14-9  Selecting WPA or WPA2, Encryption, and Authentication. 
 For WPA or WPA2 personal mode, select  PSK under the Authentication Key 
Management settings section. This will use a pre-shared key to authenticate clients on the 
WLAN. Be sure to click the  Apply  button to apply the WLAN changes you have made.   
 Configuring WPA2 Enterprise Mode 
 You can use WPA2 enterprise mode to authenticate wireless clients with 802.1x and 
EAP through an external RADIUS server located somewhere on the wired network. You 
should begin by configuring one or more RADIUS servers on the controller. Navigate 
to  Security > AAA > RADIUS > Authentication . Click the  New button to define a new 
server or select the Server Index number to edit an existing server definition.  
 In  Figure   14-10   , a new RADIUS server is being defined. Enter the server’s IP address and 
the shared secret key that the controller will use to communicate with the server. Make 
sure that the RADIUS port number is correct; if not, you can enter a different port num-
ber. The server status should be  Enabled , as selected from the drop-down menu. You 
can disable a server to take it out of service if needed. To authenticate wireless clients, 
check the box next to  Network User . Click the  Apply button to apply the new settings. 
 Next, you will need to enable 802.1x authentication on the WLAN. Navigate to WLANs 
and select a new or existing WLAN to edit. Under the Security > Layer 2 tab, select 
 WPA+WPA2  and make sure that the  WPA2 Policy box is checked. Select  AES as the 
encryption method, and then select  802.1x under the Authentication Key Management 
section.  Figure   14-11    illustrates the settings that are needed on the WLAN named 
MoreSecure. 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  301
 Tip  The default settings for a new WLAN are WPA2 with AES and 802.1x. 
 Figure 14-11  Enabling WPA2 Enterprise Mode with 802.1x Authentication. 
 Figure 14-10  Defining a RADIUS Server for WPA2 Enterprise Authentication. 

302  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 By default, a controller will use the global list of RADIUS servers in the order you have 
defined under Security > AAA > RADIUS > Authentication. You can override that list 
on the AAA Servers tab, where you can define which RADIUS servers will be used for 
802.1x authentication. You can define up to three RADIUS servers that will be tried in 
sequential order, designated as Server 1, Server 2, and Server 3. Choose a predefined 
server by clicking the drop-down menu next to one of the server entries. In  Figure  14-
12 , the RADIUS server at 172.21.10.176 will be used as Server 1. After you finish select-
ing servers, you can edit other WLAN parameters or click the  Apply button to make 
your configuration changes operational. 
 Figure 14-12  Selecting RADIUS Servers to Authenticate Clients in the WLAN. 
 Tip  As you worked through the WPA2 enterprise configuration, did you notice that 
you never saw an option to use a specific authentication method like PEAP or EAP-TLS? 
The controller only has to know that 802.1x will be in use. The actual authentication 
methods are configured on the RADIUS server. The client’s supplicant must also be con-
figured to match what the server is using.  
 Configuring WPA2 Enterprise with Local EAP 
 If your environment is relatively small or you do not have a RADIUS server in produc-
tion, you can use an authentication server that is built in to the WLC. This is called local 
EAP, which supports LEAP, EAP-FAST, PEAP, and EAP-TLS. 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  303
 First, you will need to define and enable the local EAP service on the controller. 
Navigate to  Security > Local EAP > Profiles  and click the  New  button. Enter a name for 
the local EAP profile, which will be used to define the authentication server methods. 
In  Figure   14-13 , a new profile called MyLocalEAP has been defined. Click the  Apply 
button to create the profile. Now you should see the new profile listed, along with the 
authentication methods it supports, as shown in  Figure   14-14   . From this list, you can 
check or uncheck the boxes to enable or disable each method.  
 Figure 14-13  Defining a Local EAP Profile on a Controller. 
 Figure 14-14  Displaying Configured Local EAP Profiles. 
 Select the profile name to edit its parameters. In  Figure  14-15 , the profile named 
MyLocalEAP has been configured to use PEAP. Click the  Apply button to activate your 
changes. 
 Next, you need to configure the WLAN to use the Local EAP server rather than a regu-
lar external RADIUS server. Navigate to WLANs, select the WLAN ID, and then select 
the  Security > Layer 2  tab and enable WPA2, AES, and 802.1x as before. 

304  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 If you have defined any RADIUS servers in the global list under Security > AAA > 
RADIUS > Authentication or any specific RADIUS servers in the WLAN configuration, 
the controller will use those first. Local EAP will then be used as a backup method. 
 To make Local EAP the primary authentication method, you must make sure that no 
RADIUS servers are defined on the controller. Select the  AAA Servers tab and make 
sure that all three RADIUS servers use  None from the drop-down menu. In the Local 
EAP Authentication section, check the  Enabled  box to begin using the Local EAP server. 
Select the EAP profile name that you have previously configured. In  Figure   14-16   , the 
Local EAP authentication server is enabled and will use the MyLocalEAP profile, which 
was configured for PEAP.  
 Figure 14-16  Enabling Local EAP Authentication for a WLAN. 
 Figure 14-15  Configuring a Local EAP Profile to Use PEAP. 

Chapter 14: Wireless Security Fundamentals  305
 Because the Local EAP server is local to the controller, you will have to maintain a local 
database of users there too. You can create users by navigating to  Security > AAA > 
Local Net Users .

 Foundation Topics 
 WLAN Overview 
 Recall from  Chapter   9   , “Understanding the CUWN Architecture,” that a wireless LAN 
controller and an access point (AP) work in concert to provide network connectivity to 
wireless clients. From a wireless perspective, the AP advertises a service set identifica-
tion (SSID) for the client to join. From a wired perspective, the controller connects to a 
VLAN through one of its dynamic interfaces. To complete the path between the SSID 
and the VLAN, as illustrated in  Figure  15-1 , you must first define a WLAN on the con-
troller.

192.168.100.0/24
 Figure 15-1  Connecting Wired and Wireless Networks with a WLAN. 
 The controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN 
configuration out to all of its APs by default. From that point on, wireless clients will 
be able to learn about the new WLAN and will be able to probe and join the new basic 
service set (BSS).  
 Like VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logi-
cal networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one 
unless their traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired 
network infrastructure.  
 Before you begin to create new WLANs, it is usually wise to plan your wireless network 
first. In a large enterprise, you might have to support a wide variety of wireless devices, 
user communities, security policies, and so on. You might be tempted to create a new 
WLAN for every occasion, just to keep groups of users isolated from each other or to 
support different types of devices. Although that is an appealing strategy, you should be 
aware of two limitations:  
  ■ 
  A controller supports a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be
actively configured on an AP.
  ■ 
  Advertising each WLAN uses up valuable airtime.
 Every AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the 
existence of a BSS. Because each WLAN is bound to a BSS, each WLAN must be adver-

310  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
tised with its own beacons. Beacons are normally sent 100 times per second at the lowest 
mandatory data rate. The more WLANs you have created, the more beacons you will 
need to announce them.  
 Even further, the lower the mandatory date rate, the more time each beacon will take to 
be transmitted. The end result is this: If you create too many WLANs, a channel can be 
starved of any usable airtime. Clients will have a hard time transmitting their own data 
because the channel is overly busy with beacon transmissions. As a rule of thumb, always 
limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer.  
 Configuring a WLAN 
 By default, a controller has no configuration and therefore no WLANs. Before you cre-
ate a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have: 
  ■ 
 SSID 
  ■ 
 Controller interface and VLAN number
  ■ 
 Type of wireless security needed 
 Make sure that you have already created the appropriate controller interface to support 
the new WLAN. Then you will enter the parameters as you work through the following 
sections. 
 Configuring a RADIUS Server 
 If your new WLAN will use a security scheme that requires a RADIUS server, you need 
to define the server first. Select  Security > AAA > RADIUS > Authentication to see 
a list of servers that have already been configured, as shown in  Figure  15-2 . If multiple 
servers are defined, the controller will try them in sequential order. Click  New to create 
a new server.  
 Next, enter the server’s IP address, shared secret key, and port number, as shown in 
 Figure  15-3   . Because the controller already had two other RADIUS servers configured, 
the server at 192.168.200.30 will be index number 3. Be sure to set the server status to 
 Enabled so that the controller can begin using it. At the bottom of the page, you can 
select the type of user that will be authenticated with the server. Check  Network User 
to authenticate wireless clients or  Management to authenticate wireless administrators 
that will access the controller’s management functions. Click  Apply to complete the 
server configuration.

 Creating a Dynamic Interface 
 In  Chapter   10   , “Initial Controller Configuration,” you learned about the different types 
of controller interfaces. A dynamic interface is used to connect the controller to a 
VLAN on the wired network. When you create a WLAN, you will bind the dynamic 
interface (and VLAN) to a wireless network. 
 To create a new dynamic interface, navigate to  Controller > Interfaces . You should see 
a list of all the controller interfaces that are currently configured. Click the  New button 
to define a new interface. Enter a name for the interface and the VLAN number it will 
be bound to. In  Figure   15-4   , the interface named Engineering is mapped to wired VLAN 
100. Click the  Apply button. 
 Figure 15-4  Defining a Dynamic Interface Name and VLAN ID. 
 Next, enter the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address for the interface. You 
should also define a primary and secondary DHCP server addresses that the control-
ler will use when it relays DHCP requests from clients that are bound to the interface. 
 Figure  15-5    shows how interface Engineering has been configured with IP address 
192.168.100.10. Click the  Apply  button to complete the interface configuration and 
return to the list of interfaces.

 You can display a list of the currently defined WLANs by selecting  WLANs from 
the top menu bar. In  Figure   15-6   , the controller has one WLAN called guest already 
defined. You can create a new WLAN by selecting  Create New  from the drop-down 
menu and then clicking the  Go button.

 Next, enter a descriptive name as the profile name and the SSID text string. In  Figure 
 15-7 , the profile name and SSID are identical, just to keep things straightforward. The 
ID number is used as an index into the list of WLANs that are defined on the control-
ler. The ID number becomes useful when you use templates on Cisco Network Control 
System (NCS) or Prime Infrastructure (PI) to configure WLANs on multiple controllers 
at the same time.  
 Tip  WLAN templates are applied to specific WLAN ID numbers on controllers. As a 
rule, you should keep the sequence of WLAN names and IDs consistent across multiple 
controllers so that any configuration templates you use in the future will be applied to 
the correct WLANs. 
 Figure 15-7  Creating a New WLAN. 
 Click the  Apply  button to create the new WLAN. The next page will allow you to edit 
four categories of parameters, corresponding to the tabs across the top as shown in 
 Figure  15-8   . By default, the General tab is selected. 
 You can control whether the WLAN is enabled or disabled with the Status check box. 
Even though the General page shows a specific security policy for the WLAN (the 
default WPA2 with 802.1x), you can make changes in a later step through the Security 
tab. 
 Under Radio Policy, select the type of radios that will offer the WLAN. By default, the 
WLAN will be offered on all radios that are joined with the controller. You can select 
a more specific policy with 802.11a only, 802.11a/g only, 802.11g only, or 802.11b/g 
only. For example, if you are creating a new WLAN for devices that have only a 2.4-
GHz radio, it probably does not make sense to advertise the WLAN on both 2.4- and 
5-GHz AP radios.  
 Next, select the controller interface that will be bound to the WLAN. The drop-down 
list contains all the interface names that are available. In  Figure  15-8 , the new engineering 
WLAN will be bound to the Engineering interface.

 Finally, use the  Broadcast SSID  check box to select whether the APs should broadcast 
the SSID name in the beacons. Broadcasting SSIDs is usually more convenient for users, 
because their devices can learn and display the SSID names automatically. Hiding the 
SSID name, by not broadcasting it, does not really provide any worthwhile security. 
Instead, it just prevents user devices from discovering an SSID and trying to use it as a 
default network. 
 Configuring WLAN Security 
 Select the  Security  tab to configure the security settings. By default, the Layer 2 security 
tab is selected. From the Layer 2 Security drop-down menu, select the appropriate secu-
rity scheme to use.  Table   15-2    lists the types that are available. You can also check the 
 MAC Filtering  check box to use client MAC addresses as authentication credentials.

set parameters that are specific to the security scheme. For example, WPA2 with AES is 
used, but WPA and TKIP are not.   
 Figure 15-9  Configuring Layer 2 WLAN Security. 
 If you choose a Layer 2 security scheme that requires a RADIUS server, the controller 
will use the global list of servers you have defined under  Security > AAA > RADIUS > 
Authentication . You can override that list by identifying up to three specific RADIUS 
servers in the WLAN configuration. Display the  AAA Servers tab, then under each 
server, you can select a specific server IP address from the drop-down menu of glob-
ally defined servers. Servers 1, 2, and 3 are tried in sequential order until one of them 
responds. In  Figure   15-10   , Server 1 is being set from a list of servers at 192.168.200.28,

 Configuring WLAN QoS 
 Display the  QoS  tab to configure quality of service settings for the WLAN, as shown 
in  Figure   15-11   . By default, the controller will consider all frames in the WLAN to be 
normal data, to be handled in a “best effort” manner. You can set the Quality of Service 
(QoS) drop-down menu to classify all frames in one of the following ways: 
  ■ 
 Platinum (voice) 
  ■ 
 Gold (video) 
  ■ 
 Silver (best effort) 
  ■ 
 Bronze (background) 
 You can also set the Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) policy and call admission control (CAC) 
policies on the QoS page.

 Figure 15-11  Configuring QoS Settings. 
 Configuring Advanced WLAN Settings 
 Finally, display the  Advanced  tab to configure a variety of advanced WLAN settings. 
From the page shown in  Figure   15-12   , you can enable functions such as coverage hole 
detection, peer-to-peer blocking, client exclusion, client load limits, and so on. 
 Although most of the advanced settings are beyond the scope of the CCNA Wireless 
level, you should be aware of a few defaults that might affect your wireless clients. 
 By default, client sessions with the WLAN are limited to 1800 seconds (30 minutes). 
Once that session time expires, a client will be required to reauthenticate. This setting is 
controlled by the Enable Session Timeout check box and the Timeout field.  
 A controller maintains a set of security policies that are used to detect potentially mali-
cious wireless clients. If a client exhibits a certain behavior, the controller can exclude 
it from the WLAN for a period of time. By default, all clients are subject to the policies 
configured under  Security  >  Wireless Protection Policies >  Client Exclusion Policies . 
These policies include excessive 802.11 association failures, 802.11 authentication fail-
ures, 802.1x authentication failures, web authentication failures, and IP address theft or 
reuse. Offending clients will be automatically excluded or blocked for 60 seconds, as a 
deterrent to attacks on the wireless network.  

Chapter 15: Configuring a WLAN  319
 Tip  Is 60 seconds really enough time to deter an attack coming from a wireless cli-
ent? In the case of a brute-force attack, where passwords are guessed from a dictionary 
of possibilities, 60 seconds is enough to disrupt and delay an attacker’s progress. What 
might have taken 2 minutes to find a matching password without an exclusion policy 
would take 15 years with one.    
 Finalizing WLAN Configuration 
 When you are satisfied with the settings in each of the WLAN configuration tabs, click 
the  Apply  button. The WLAN will be created and added to the controller configuration. 
In  Figure   15-13   , the engineering WLAN has been added as WLAN ID 2 and is enabled 
for use.

 In  Chapter   15   , “Configuring a WLAN,” you learned how to define and configure a new 
wireless LAN to support a community of clients that have something in common. You 
can even configure multiple WLANs to support multiple user communities. In most 
cases, the WLAN users are trusted at some level because they are a necessary part of 
your enterprise.  
 What about guest users, who might not be trusted or integral to your business? Guest 
users commonly need to access the wireless network as a convenience. This chapter dis-
cusses the steps you can take to configure a guest network as an extension to your wire-
less infrastructure.

Chapter 16: Implementing a Wireless Guest Network  325
 Foundation Topics 
 Guest Network Overview 
 Wireless LANs are usually configured to support specific groups of clients or client 
devices. For example, one WLAN might support wireless users in the Engineering 
department, even if that department is scattered in several buildings or locations. Other 
WLANs might support a sales staff, teachers, students, and so on. These examples seg-
ment wireless users by function or the need to access certain enterprise resources. Each 
WLAN might have a different set of security policies from the others. 
 You might also decide to create WLANs to support different types of wireless devices. 
For example, one WLAN could be configured to support all medical devices in a hospi-
tal that can use only Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2 (WPA2) with a pre-shared key. 
A separate WLAN could be created for users with medical devices that support WPA2 
Enterprise, with digital certificates. In these cases, WLANs are created according to the 
wireless device capabilities. 
 As a wireless network administrator, you might be asked to provide connectivity for 
users who do not fall into any convenient category. Guest users are normally temporary 
visitors who need to access a wireless network to make their work and their time onsite 
more convenient. Because guests are not regular, trusted employees, you should always 
try to offer some basic network access while containing and isolating them from the 
trusted portion of your network.  
 In  Figure   16-1   , both guests and engineering staff are able to use the same wireless infra-
structure, while the two user groups are kept isolated from each other. The engineering 
users can communicate directly with the company resources. However, the guest users 
are commonly placed within a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that has limited access and is 
secured by a firewall.

 Configuring a Guest Network 
 Building a guest wireless network might seem like a complex task; however, it is really no 
different from building any other WLAN that is tailored for a user community. The trick 
is to provide the appropriate degree of isolation from the rest of the enterprise network.  
 The guest WLAN can be bound to a guest VLAN that is isolated from other VLANs, as 
shown in  Figure   16-2 . Before guest users can access any other WLAN or VLAN, a router 
or firewall must permit and provide the access. The Guest WLAN advertises service set 
identifier (SSID) Guest and is bound to the controller’s Guest interface on VLAN 20. The 
same access point (AP) and controller infrastructure has an Engineering WLAN that is 
bound to the controller’s Engineering interface on VLAN 100.

 To create a guest WLAN, follow these steps: 
 Step 1. 
  Create a dynamic interface for the guest WLAN. Under  Controller >
Interfaces > New , define the dynamic interface, the VLAN ID, and the IP 
addressing information.  Figures  16-3 and  16-4 show an interface named 
Guest configured for VLAN 20 and the 192.168.20.0/24 subnet.

 Step 2. 
  Create the guest WLAN.  
 Select  WLAN > New  to define a new WLAN, and then enter the profile 
name and SSID. In  Figure  16-5 , the controller has been configured with a sec-
ond WLAN (ID 2) that uses SSID Guest. 
 Figure 16-5  Creating a Guest WLAN. 
 Step 3. 
  Bind the guest WLAN to the guest WLAN interface. 
 On the  General  tab of the WLAN, select the guest controller interface to 
be used. In  Figure   16-6   , the Guest WLAN is configured to use the Guest 
dynamic interface.  

328  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 16-6  Assigning a Dynamic Interface to the Guest WLAN. 
 Step 4. 
  Configure wireless security.   Guest users are commonly kept isolated from an 
enterprise network. Even so, you will have to decide how to secure the guest 
WLAN for its users. For example, your security policies might dictate that 
guest users must be authenticated before they are granted any access at all. 
You might also want to configure a wireless security mechanism to encrypt 
and protect each guest user’s traffic from eavesdropping and tampering. On 
the Security tab, you can select a Layer 2 security scheme as shown in  Figure 
  16-7   . You can also select the  Layer 3 tab to enable web authentication, 
where guest users are presented with a login web page before being allowed 
to connect to the guest network. 
 To authenticate guest users, you can use one of the following methods: 
  ■ 
 Create guest users on a RADIUS server, which will be authenticated with 802.1x
  ■ 
 Create local usernames and passwords on the controller; either a lobby ambassador
or an administrative user on the controller can log into the controller and create
temporary guest user credentials 
 At the CCNA level, you should know how to configure and implement a guest wireless 
network. Guest user authentication is not specified on the exam blueprint. 
 Be sure to visit the QoS and Advanced tabs to complete the guest WLAN configuration. 

Chapter 16: Implementing a Wireless Guest Network  329
 Scaling the Guest Network 
 Configuring a guest WLAN on a single controller is straightforward. The guest WLAN 
is just like any other WLAN defined on the controller. In larger installations, you might 
have more than one controller. In that case, each guest WLAN terminates on its own 
controller, making it difficult to isolate all guest clients in a single DMZ or behind a 
single firewall.  
 Recall from  Chapter   12   , “Understanding Roaming,” that Cisco WLCs can support Layer 
3 roaming by automatically building a tunnel between the first controller a client associ-
ates with and the controller where the client is currently located. In effect, the client is 
tunneled from a foreign controller back to the original anchor controller. This same tun-
neling strategy can be leveraged to funnel guest clients from any controller into a mobil-
ity anchor controller where guests share a common IP subnet and security policies. 
 Where Layer 3 roaming builds controller-to-controller tunnels to follow clients as they 
move, mobility anchors are configured ahead of time so that guest clients will be tun-
neled to a predetermined anchor.  Figure  16-8 illustrates the concept with three WLCs. 
Each WLC is configured with its own guest WLAN, but only WLC-1 is identified as a 
mobility anchor. Regardless of which controller a guest user joins, the user will be tun-
neled to the anchor and connected into the guest VLAN. You can also identify several 
mobility anchors so that guest users can be distributed across them to balance the load. 
 Figure 16-7  Configuring Guest WLAN Security. 

330  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Tip  In many implementations, the controller used as a mobility anchor for a guest 
network does not even have any APs joined to it. Instead, it acts as the final destination 
for the guest WLANs across an entire enterprise network. Without APs to support, the 
anchor controller can devote more resources toward handling guest users.

 Figure 16-8  Using Mobility Anchors to Consolidate Guest Wireless Clients. 
 Configuring mobility anchors is straightforward, provided you configure every control-
ler involved in the guest WLAN consistently and use the following steps:  
 Step 1. 
  Create a guest WLAN on each controller. The guest WLAN should be config-
ured identically across all of the controllers so that each one can build a tun-
nel to the anchor. The foreign and anchor controller guest WLANs can have 
different outgoing interfaces, RADIUS servers, and pre-shared keys. Because 
the guest WLAN on each controller is tunneled to the anchor controller, the 
outgoing interface does not really matter. For this reason, the management 
interface is commonly used. The guest WLAN on the anchor controller, 
however, must use the actual dynamic interface name for the guest DMZ net-
work. 
 Step 2. 
  Form a mobility group relationship. 
 All the controllers involved must be configured to use the same mobility 
group before the anchor relationships can be built. Each of the controllers 
must be listed in the anchor controller’s mobility group list, and vice versa.  
 Step 3. 
  Identify the anchor on each controller. Be aware that even the anchor con-
troller must be configured with an anchor controller (itself) so that it will 
accept tunnels from other controllers. Configure the anchor controller first 
by selecting the  WLANs  tab to display the list of WLANs. At the far-right 
end of the guest WLAN entry, right-click the blue triangle, and then select 
 Mobility Anchors  from the drop-down menu, as shown in  Figure  16-9 .

 Next, move to a different controller and repeat the process. On that controller, you will

 A Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) consists of wireless LAN controllers, light-
weight access points, and wireless client devices. Even though the majority of this book 
is devoted to the controllers and access points (APs), the CCNA Wireless exam also 
includes client configuration. Why? When you build and support a wireless network, 
you often need to help your users configure and troubleshoot their devices so that they 
can use your network.  
 Wireless networks suffer from the bring-your-own-devices (BYOD) syndrome, where 
users often carry all sorts of wireless devices with them. Each device might use a differ-
ent operating system, different wireless adapter hardware, and have different capabili-
ties. This chapter covers the most common types of wireless clients.

 Configuring Common Wireless Clients 
 As you work through this chapter, keep in mind that the CCNA Wireless exam blueprint 
uses words like  describe  and  identify  in exam topics that involve client capabilities and 
configuration. Therefore, you will find an overview of several common clients in the sec-
tions that follow.  
 Windows 7 and 8 
 Microsoft Windows 7 and 8 include a stock wireless client that offers basic connectivity 
options. To access the wireless client, display the taskbar and look for the wireless icon 
that shows a sequence of bars indicating signal strength. The current network status dis-
plays when you hover the cursor over the icon, as shown in  Figure  17-1 . 
 Figure 17-1  Displaying Windows Network Status. 
 You can click the wireless network icon to see a list of service set identifiers (SSIDs), as 
shown in  Figure   17-2   . By default, a Windows PC does not have a prepopulated list of 
SSIDs to use. To scan for available SSIDs, it will transmit probe requests with a null or 
empty SSID name, expecting nearby APs to respond. You can manually initiate a scan by 
clicking on the circulating arrows symbol in the upper-right corner of the wireless net-
work status window. To connect to one of the listed networks, click its name and then 
click the  Connect  button that appears.   
 You can manually populate a list of wireless networks or edit their properties by click-
ing the  Open Network and Sharing Center link and then selecting the  Manage Wireless 
Networks .  Figure   17-3    shows an example list of wireless networks. Windows will try to 
find and connect to a network using the ordered sequence in the list. You can change 
the order by selecting a network and using the  Move Up and  Move Down links to move 
it to a new position in the list.  
 To add a new network to the list, click the  Add link. As shown in  Figure  17-4 , you can 
enter the network name (SSID) and security and encryption types. You can also specify 
whether the PC should automatically connect to the network each time the SSID is 
detected, even if the SSID is not broadcast in any beacon frames.

 The built-in Windows wireless client does not offer many specific configuration options; 
however, you might find more options by configuring the wireless adapter. From the 
Network and Sharing Center, select  Change Adapter Settings to display a list of installed 
adapters. Right-click a wireless adapter and select  Properties to display the adapter prop-
erties and a list of installed protocols, as shown in  Figure  17-5 . Click the  Configure button 
to bring up a window of adapter driver properties. Finally, display the  Advanced tab to 
display a list of parameters and values, as shown in  Figure  17-6 . The list of parameters var-
ies from one adapter to another,  depending on what settings the manufacturer offers.

 Figure 17-6  Configuring Advanced Wireless Adapter Settings. 
 Intel PROSet 
 If you have an Intel wireless adapter installed, you can download and install the Intel 
PROSet driver to access additional features that are not offered by the native Windows 
driver. For example, the Windows driver does not support Lightweight Extensible 
Authentication Protocol (LEAP), EAP Flexible Authentication by Secure Tunneling 
(EAP-FAST), or Cisco Compatible Extensions (CCX), but the Intel PROSet driver does. 
The Intel PROSet driver integrates Intel-specific features directly into the wireless net-
work and wireless adapter configurations that you can access through the Windows 
Network and Sharing Center.  
 You can configure additional wireless security features by navigating to Manage 
Wireless Networks and then editing the properties of a wireless network. On the 
Security tab, you can select the security type, encryption type, and authentication meth-
od. In  Figure   17-7   , 802.1x security has been selected. Notice that the Intel PROSet driv-
er has added authentication methods Cisco:LEAP, Cisco:PEAP, and Cisco:EAP-FAST.  
 To enable the CCX on the Intel adapter, display the  Connection tab and check the 
box next to  Enable Intel Connection Settings , as shown in  Figure  17-8 . Then click the 
 Configure  button, select  Cisco Options, and then check the box next to  Enable Radio 
Measurement .

 Intel also offers a PROSet utility application that you can download along with the 
PROSet driver. The PROSet utility is an alternate way to manage wireless networks and 
configure the adapter settings. An Intel wireless adapter can be managed by only one 
method—either by Windows or by the Intel PROSet utility.

 Tip  Even though you can choose to manage an Intel adapter through one of two meth-
ods, it is better to install the PROSet driver and manage the adapter through the native 
Windows network configuration tools. In contrast, the Intel PROSet utility application 
uses a third-party configuration utility and is not available for all Windows versions. 
 If you do choose to install the PROSet utility, you can access it through its taskbar icon, 
which looks like a radio frequency (RF) wave. If Windows is currently managing the 
adapter, you can click the  Enable WiFi Control button to switch to PROSet manage-
ment. 
 Like the native Windows driver, the PROSet utility tries to use any preconfigured wire-
less profiles in sequential order. If no profiles have been defined, it scans for available 
networks. In  Figure   17-9   , PROSet has discovered one SSID and is waiting for confirma-
tion to connect to it. To do that, you can select the network name and click the  Connect 
button. 
 Figure 17-9  Discovering a Network in the Intel PROSet Utility. 
 You can also configure a list of network profiles by clicking the  Profiles button. As you 
build a list, you can change the order that the profiles are tried by selecting one and 
using the up and down arrows on the right side of the window to raise or lower the pro-
file in the list.

 To add a new profile, click the  Add  button. You can configure general settings and secu-
rity parameters as shown in  Figures  17-10  and  17-11 , respectively. Click the  OK button 
to save the profile.

 Android 
 Devices based on the Android operating system use a built-in driver and utility to man-
age connections to wireless networks. Android devices can discover a list of available 
networks and can manage manually configured networks too.  
 First, you should enable the wireless adapter by selecting  Settings > Wireless & 
Networks  and then checking the  Wi-Fi check box. Select  Wi-Fi Settings to manage indi-
vidual wireless connections from the list, as shown in  Figure  17-12 . The list shows the 
SSIDs of networks that have been discovered, in addition to those that are locally con-
figured. After a network has been learned and connected at least once, the device will 
automatically try to use it again in the future.  
 Figure 17-12  Displaying a List of Wireless Networks on an Android Device. 
 You can manually add a new network by clicking the  Add Wi-Fi Network link at the 
bottom of the network list. Enter the SSID and security parameters as shown in  Figure 
 17-13 , and then click the  Save button. 
 Tip  After a network has been learned, you cannot edit its properties. Instead, you can 
select the network name and click the  Forget button to remove the network from the list. 
From there, the network can be rediscovered or reconfigured manually.

 Apple OS X 
 Apple devices use a built-in wireless adapter and a configuration utility to manage net-
works that are discovered and manually defined. To access the configuration utility, 
select  System Preferences , and then select  Network .  Figure  17-14 shows an example, 
with all available network types listed down the left side. From this window, you can 
enable or disable the wireless adapter. You can also select  Wi-Fi and then click the 
 Advanced  button to display and edit the network connection configurations. 
 The advanced settings window, as shown in  Figure  17-15 , has seven tabs across the top. 
The Wi-Fi tab contains a list of preferred networks—SSIDs that have already been con-
figured. The network will be tried in sequential order; you can change the order by drag-
ging networks up or down in the list.

 Cisco AnyConnect 
 The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a robust, modular security client that 
integrates a variety of functions into a single software application. The AnyConnect 
client runs on Windows, OS X, Linux, Apple iOS, and Google Android devices. 
AnyConnect can be installed in a modular fashion too, as shown in  Figure  17-17 . 
 The modules include the following:   
  ■ 
 VPN    —Virtual private network connections to a security gateway
  ■ 
 Diagnostic and Reporting Tool (DART) —Connection status and troubleshooting 
information 
  ■ 
 Network Access Manager (NAM)    —Control over secure connection methods and
user authentication 
  ■ 
 Posture Assessment    —Verifies that antivirus, personal firewall, and service pack
software are installed prior to building a connection
  ■ 
 Telemetry    —Feeds information back into a web filtering infrastructure
Key 
Topic

Chapter 17: Understanding Wireless Clients  349
  ■ 
 Web Security    —Security policies enforced according to Cisco Web Security
policies 
 Notice that wireless was not mentioned in any of the AnyConnect module descriptions. 
That is because AnyConnect collects a suite of security functions into a single client 
software, regardless of the connection type. AnyConnect does provide integrated man-
agement of wireless connections, overriding that of any wireless client software that is 
installed on the client device. By controlling wireless connections, AnyConnect can also 
enforce any security policies that might affect the wireless security parameters an end 
user might try to use.  
 Tip  To use AnyConnect to manage wireless connections, you must install the VPN and 
NAM modules. 
 AnyConnect policies can be created on a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 
through its Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) management front end and then 
pushed out to AnyConnect clients. The main AnyConnect client interface consists of 
VPN, network, and web security functions, as shown in  Figure  17-18 . The network func-
tion is the only one relevant to the CCNA Wireless exam.

 You can create and edit network profiles by selecting the properties button to the right 
of the Network Status section. Under the Networks > Configuration tab shown in  Figure 
 17-19 , the list of wireless networks is displayed. You can change the order of the net-
works by selecting one and using the up and down arrows to change its position in the 
list. 
 Tip  Be aware that your ability to create and edit parameters is limited by the policies 
that are used to push the AnyConnect client and its profile to your local machine. For 
example, the AnyConnect administrator may have restricted your ability to create new 
connections only to wireless networks that use open authentication and pre-shared keys. 
 To create a new wireless network profile, click the  Add button. Enter the SSID, wireless 
security parameters, and the 802.1x mode, as shown in  Figure  17-20 .

 Cisco Compatible Extensions 
 The wireless clients described in the previous sections are fairly straightforward; the cli-
ent has a wireless network adapter and controls the SSID and wireless security that are 
used to associate with an AP. Beyond that, the AP can make a safe assumption that the 
client complies with the 802.11 standard and supports certain data rates, but it knows 
little else about the client and its capabilities.  
 For example, without thorough testing, how do you know whether a wireless client 
and its driver software release support Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2 (WPA2) with 
EAP Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) or some other security scheme? How do you 
know whether a client can optimally transport audio and video over wireless? Suppose 
that your enterprise just purchased several hundred wireless communication or medi-
cal devices. How can you be certain which wireless functions and security features the 
devices support?  
 To remove some of the unknowns, Cisco created the Cisco Compatible Extensions 
(CCX) program. Cisco defines a set of features as part of a specific CCX version. 
Wireless device manufacturers can implement the features in their devices and then sub-
mit their devices for testing and validation. If a device passes the interoperability tests, it 
receives a “Cisco Certified Compatibility” designation. 
 The CCX program really has two goals:  
  ■ 
 Take advantage of Cisco enhancements and innovations above what is defined in
the 802.11 standard 
  ■ 
 Verify that a client supports each enhancement correctly
 Over time, Cisco has developed CCX in phases or versions. To date, there are five ver-
sions, each building on its predecessor with an increasing set of features.  Table  17-2 lists 
some of the 70 features, along with the CCX versions that support them. Notice how 
the more traditional and general features such as 802.11 are supported in all versions, 
essentially over a long period of time as WLAN technology has evolved. Features avail-
able only in v4 and v5 tend to be interactive, where the client works with the wireless 
infrastructure to report information about itself. 
 For example, management frame protection (MFP) addresses an inherent weakness in 
the management frames that an AP transmits. When a client receives a management 
frame, it implicitly trusts that the frame came from an AP and that the frame contents 
have not been tampered with. To secure management frames, both the AP and the cli-
ent must participate to encrypt and authenticate each frame. Only CCXv5 clients are 
equipped to use frames protected with MFP.

 Tip  What if a device is not certified for any CCX version? Chances are that it will work 
just fine on a Cisco wireless infrastructure. CCX certifies extended features that are spe-
cific to Cisco networks—not features that are needed for basic wireless operation.  
 Each CCX version contains more complex and interactive features than the version 
before it, but the features are organized more by the version number than by function. 
Some devices that are designed for a specific application, such as a wireless phone or a 
locator tag, do not have a need to support the entire list of features in a CCX version. 
To simplify the compatibility process for these devices, Cisco introduced the CCX Lite 
designation. 
Key 
Topic

354  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 CCX Lite is organized into four basic categories or modules, according to device 
function:  
  ■ 
 Foundation    —The core set of features that are common to most general purpose
devices 
  ■ 
 Voice    —Features specific to voice communication devices, such as WMM, CAC,
expedited bandwidth request, and voice metrics 
  ■ 
 Location    —Features specific to near real-time location reporting, usually used with
RFID tags 
  ■ 
 Management    —Features specific to client management, such as link test, diagnostic
channel, client reporting, and roaming and real-time diagnostics 
 A device must be compliant with the Foundation module to achieve CCX Lite certifica-
tion. The other modules are optional for application specific devices. 
 For the CCNA Wireless exam, be familiar with the CCX basics and know the CCX Lite 
modules. You should also have a good understanding of wireless security features and 
which CCX version supports them. For example, Cisco Centralized Key Management 
(CCKM) is used to make client authentication much more efficient during roaming. 
You should know which CCX version should be used to support a given authentication 
method. Study  Table   17-3   , which lists the wireless security and authentication schemes 
along with the CCX versions.

 Table   17-3    might seem daunting, especially if you have to remember which CCX ver-
sions correspond to one of the many security features listed. Notice that the table can 
be broken down into four main divisions: 802.1x, WPA, WPA2, and MFP. Within each 
division, the same set of LEAP, PEAP-GTC, EAP-FAST, PEAP-MSCHAP, and EAP-TLS 
schemes are repeated. Therefore, you might benefit from memorizing the following 
rules of thumb:  
  ■ 
  802.1x is covered in all versions.
  ■ 
  WPA and its schemes were all introduced in CCXv2.
  ■ 
  WPA2 and its schemes were all introduced in CCXv3.
 Except: 
  ■ 
 EAP-FAST introduced in CCXv3 
  ■ 
  PEAP-MSCHAP and EAP-TLS introduced in CCXv4
  ■ 
 MFP was introduced in CCXv5. 
 For example, without looking at the table, which CCX versions support WPA2 with 
EAP-TLS? From the third rule, you know that WPA2 is supported in Versions 3 and 
later, except that EAP-TLS is Version 4 and later. Therefore, your answer should be 
CCXv4 and CCXv5.

  ■ 
 Navigate WCS interface 
  ■ 
  Configure controllers and access points (APs) (using

 A Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) is based on a centralized architecture. 
Multiple APs all connect to the same controller for their connectivity. You can con-
figure, monitor, and manage the APs through the controller. As a network scales, man-
agement tasks can become tedious because you have to visit more than one controller 
to apply the same configuration changes or to monitor wireless events. The Wireless 
Control System (WCS) provides a central platform for managing multiple controllers and 
their access points (APs). 
 This chapter is a brief overview of WCS, how you can configure controllers and APs 
with it, and how you can use it to monitor a variety of things in your network. 
 “Do I Know This Already?” Quiz 
 The “Do I Know This Already?” quiz allows you to assess whether you should read this 
entire chapter thoroughly or jump to the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section. If you are

 Foundation Topics 
 WCS Overview 
 The Cisco WCS is a browser-based software application that offers the capability to 
manage multiple controller deployments through a single interface. Benefits of WCS 
include the following:  
  ■ 
 Wireless planning tools for access point (AP) placement and radio frequency (RF)
parameters 
  ■ 
 Controller and AP deployment through configuration templates
  ■ 
 Monitoring of controllers, APs, and wireless client devices
  ■ 
 Troubleshooting through alerts, events, wireless interference analysis, and a built-in
client troubleshooting tool 
  ■ 
 Extensive set of reports that can be automated or run on-demand
 Note  You might be aware that Cisco WCS is no longer a supported product. 
Nevertheless, WCS is still covered on the IUWNE 640-722 exam. WCS has undergone 
an evolution, becoming Cisco Prime Network Control System (NCS) and then becoming 
Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI). Prime Infrastructure can manage both wireless and wired 
networks and has much greater functionality than WCS. It can work with Cisco Mobility 
Services Engines (MSE) to locate clients, leverage Cisco CleanAir, and provide improved 
wireless intrusion prevention system (wIPS) functionality. 
 WCS is a service that is installed on a 32-bit Windows 2003 SP1+ or Red Hat Linux 
server. It is available in two forms: WCS Base and WCS Plus. Both forms can manage 
multiple controllers and APs, and can monitor wireless clients, but they differ according 
to the functions listed in  Table  18-2 . 
 Table 18-2  Comparison Between WCS Base and WCS Plus 
 WCS Base 
 WCS Plus 
 Clients can be coarsely located, 
in relation to the nearest AP.  
 Clients can be located in a context-based fashion by 
triangulating between three nearest APs, for a high degree 
of accuracy.  
 WCS can operate as a high-availability pair. 
 WCS can leverage MSE for client tracking, wIPS. 

Chapter 18: Managing Wireless Networks with WCS  363
 WCS is also licensed according to scale and the number of APs that will be supported. 
You can purchase WCS as a single-server license for installations that can support up to 
50, 100, or 500 APs. For larger networks, WCS is available as an enterprise license that 
can support one or more server instances and up to 50,000 APs. The enterprise license is 
available only in the Plus form.  
 In large enterprise settings, you might need more than one instance of WCS to man-
age a vast number of controllers and APs. The enterprise license allows you to install 
multiple WCS servers, but you still have to visit each WCS individually. To scale even 
further, you could leverage the Cisco WCS Navigator. Navigator provides a single WCS-
like interface that can aggregate and manage up to 20 distinct WCS servers. You can 
purchase Navigator as a separate product or take advantage of one free license that is 
included in a WCS enterprise license. 
 Once WCS is installed, you can connect to it with a secure web browser session pointed 
to the IP address of the WCS server. Installing and initially configuring WCS is beyond 
the scope of the CCNA Wireless exam. You can log in with username root and the 
initial password, as shown in  Figure   18-1 , or with another username that has been subse-
quently configured.  
 Figure 18-1  WCS Login Screen. 
 Once you log in to WCS, you see a home page like the one shown in  Figure  18-2 . The 
home page is organized into several sections or areas:  
  ■ 
 Alarm Summary dashboard    —A narrow strip of alarm counters across the top left
of the page 
  ■ 
 Main navigation menu —Monitor, Reports, Configure, Services, Administration, 
Tools, and Help drop-down menus
  ■ 
 WCS Home area —Client, Security, Mesh, CleanAir, and ContextAware tabs

 Figure 18-2  WCS Home Page. 
 Each area is described further in the following sections. 
 Tip  You can return to the WCS home page at any time by clicking the small house-
shaped icon located in the upper-left corner of the WCS navigation menu.  
 Alarm Summary Dashboard 
 As WCS receives alarms from controllers and other wireless management devices, it cat-
egorizes them by severity level and displays a summary count. There are three severity 
levels, as follows:  
  ■ 
 Critical    —Denoted by a red upward triangular arrow
  ■ 
 Major    —Denoted by an orange downward triangular arrow
  ■ 
 Minor —Denoted by a yellow circle 
 If the severity level count is nonzero, you can click the number to display a list of the 
specific alarms.  Figure   18-3    shows a typical list of minor severity alarms. Notice that 
each alarm has a check box in the far-left column. WCS will remember each alarm it 
receives for a default period of 15 days or until someone takes some action on it. You

 Using WCS to Configure Devices 
 Before WCS can manage any controllers, you must add them into the WCS configura-
tion. Select  Configure > Controllers  to display a list of currently managed controllers. 
To add a new one, select  Add Controllers from the drop-down menu and click the  Go 
button, as shown in  Figure  18-6 . 
 Figure 18-6  Adding a New Controller to WCS. 
 Next, enter the controller’s IP address, along with its Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP) and Secure Shell (SSH) credentials, and then click  OK . The SNMP cre-
dentials can have read-only access to view the WLC, but must be read-write for WCS to 
make configuration changes on the WLC. SSH and Telnet are not necessary except for 
migrating autonomous APs to lightweight mode.  Figure  18-7 shows a new controller at 
192.168.10.13 being added to the WCS database. If the SNMP credentials are correct, 
WCS will pull the controller’s configuration, along with the full list of APs joined to it, 
into the WCS database. 
 After you have populated WCS with a list of controllers, you can use it to config-
ure controller and AP parameters from one central location. To make a configuration 
change, you can select  Configure > Controllers and then select the IP address link of 
the target controller. Next, WCS displays a configuration page that is similar to that of 
the controller itself. The far-left column represents a list of controller functions. Each 
entry is actually a drop-down list of parameters. In  Figure  18-8 , the 802.11b/g/n > RRM 
> DCA parameters are being configured. The idea is to mimic an actual controller’s con-
figuration before pushing the configuration out to it.

 When you click the  Save  button at the bottom of the configuration page, the configura-
tion changes are pushed out to the controller. 
 WCS also offers a flexible and scalable solution for configuring multiple controllers 
and APs. You can define configuration templates that can be applied to specific devices 
automatically. For example, you can define a template that gets pushed to a newly 
installed controller so that it gets configured similarly to other controllers already in pro-
duction. You might also want to change RF settings on a long list of APs. WCS makes a 
tedious and time-consuming chore into an organized, efficient, and repeatable task. 
 You can configure WCS templates by selecting  Configure > Controller Template 
Launch Pad . WCS templates are not covered on the CCNA Wireless exam. 
 Using WCS Maps 
 As you work with wireless controllers and APs, you might find yourself getting lost in 
the names and numbers without having a visual concept of things like AP location and 
RF coverage in an area. Fortunately, WCS can help! WCS can provide a graphical rep-
resentation of a wireless network, complete with maps, physical locations, predictive 
RF coverage, and interactive data displays. In other words, WCS will help you see your 
wireless network as it really is—APs and clients distributed throughout a building or out-
door area. 
 WCS can use an image file (PNG, JPG, or GIF formats) as the background behind objects 
and data that it displays. For example, you can upload the floor plan of a building into 
WCS and have the APs and clients that are located on that floor shown in relation to 
their actual locations.  
 WCS maps are organized in a tree-like structure. A campus contains one or more build-
ings or outdoor areas. Each building can contain one or more floor maps. By default, 
maps are placed into a system campus. You can define your own campuses and your 
own buildings as you add maps into WCS. 
 Tip  The CCNA Wireless exam blueprint focuses on manipulating and using preconfig-
ured maps. You will not have to worry about how to create and organize the maps—just 
how to work with the APs and the parameters needed to display various wireless data.  
 Displaying Maps 
 You can access the WCS maps by selecting  Monitor > Maps . The list in the far-left 
column contains the map tree structure; the rest of the page contains a single flat list of 
every campus, building, and floor map. In  Figure  18-9 , WCS already has one building 
preconfigured with maps for five floors. You can see from the AP and radio counts that 
only the fourth-floor map shows APs. The other floors have maps, but no APs have been 
added or located on them yet.  

Chapter 18: Managing Wireless Networks with WCS  371
 Figure 18-9  A Typical List of Maps Displayed in Monitor > Maps. 
 You can click a map name in the list to display it, as shown in  Figure  18-10 . The map 
consists of the background image, usually a building floor plan or a drawing of an out-
door area, overlaid with AP icons and data. For example, the AP icons in the figure are 
shown in their current locations with labels that display the AP names.  
 Figure 18-10  A WCS Map Showing AP Locations. 
 By default, a map is shown with dynamic information. WCS computes the RF signal 
strength for each AP and displays the results as a colored heatmap. The colors represent 
the signal strength that might be received in each location on the map. The color scale 
is shown above the heatmap. Red represents a strong signal (–35 dBm), progressing 
through orange, yellow, green, and then blues and purples at the weak end of the scale 
(–90 dBm).  
 The heatmap that WCS computes is based on many of the RF principles you learned 
about in  Chapter   3   , “RF Signals in the Real World.” Based on each map location, WCS 

372  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
can compute the free-space loss based on the distance from each of the APs. What 
about things like absorption, where the walls of a building attenuate or reduce RF signal 
strength? At a minimum, a WCS map contains only the AP icons positioned over a floor 
plan background image. You might be able to see objects like walls, doors, and eleva-
tors on the map, but WCS is not able  to interpret the drawing at all. Instead, if you want 
WCS to know about obstacles and compute their influence, you can use the map editor 
tool to define the physical objects and their dBm attenuation values. The more informa-
tion you put into a map, the more accurate WCS can be when it produces the RF heat-
map. 
 WCS also updates the AP icons based on current conditions. A green icon represents 
an AP radio that is working properly, with no faults or alarms. A yellow icon represents 
an AP radio with a minor alarm, while a red icon indicates a major alarm. Icons can also 
blink, indicating that one of the AP’s profile thresholds (load, interference, noise, or cov-
erage hole) has been exceeded. By default, WCS updates a map every 5 minutes. 
 While a map is displayed, you can hover the cursor over an icon to display more infor-
mation about it. For example,  Figure   18-11 shows a small window that popped up to 
display information about the AP named cop-421-ap17. From this window, you can find 
the AP’s MAC address, model number, and the IP address of the controller it has joined. 
You can select the 802.11a/n or 802.11b/g/n tab to display information about that spe-
cific radio, including channel number and transmit power level.  
 Figure 18-11  Displaying Information About an AP on a Map. 

Chapter 18: Managing Wireless Networks with WCS  373
 Manipulating APs on Maps 
 Once a map has been created for a building floor or outdoor area, you will need to pop-
ulate it with AP icons. Sometimes you might also need to move AP icons to reflect their 
location more accurately or delete icons if the corresponding APs have been removed.  
 To place APs on a map, first display the map. Next, you will need to select the APs that 
will be placed on the map. The APs must already exist, be joined to a controller, and be 
known to WCS. From the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the map floor 
view page, select  Add Access Points , and then click the  Go button. 
 On the Add Access Points page, WCS will display a list of all of the APs it knows. You 
will have to search through the pages of the list to find and select the APs you want to 
add to the map. You can sort the list by AP name to make the search easier. After you 
have checked the box next to each AP, as shown in  Figure  18-12 , click the  OK button at 
the bottom of the page.  
 Figure 18-12  Selecting APs to Add to a WCS Map. 
 Next, you will have to position each AP in its appropriate location on the map. WCS 
displays the map and lines the selected APs up along the top edge. Usually the AP icons 
start out so close together that their names are obscured. You may have to move them 
elsewhere on the map just to space them out and see their names.  
 To move an AP icon, just click it and drag it to the desired location. In  Figure  18-13 , AP 
cop-524e-ap11 is being moved from its default position at the upper-left corner. All of 
the AP icons will remain dark while the AP being moved will be blue. When you select 
an AP to move, WCS will also display the AP’s name, position on the map, mounting 
height, and antenna orientation. During this process, you can always make further adjust-
ments and relocate APs as needed. Click the  Save button to save the map and AP 
locations. 

374  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 18-13  Locating APs on a WCS Map. 
 You can make further changes to a map whenever it is displayed. There are several small 
editing icons along the top of the map, as shown in  Figure  18-14 . Use the zoom factor to 
resize the map so that you can view it at an appropriate size. You can click the respective 
icon to add, remove, and reposition APs in the map.

Chapter 18: Managing Wireless Networks with WCS  375
 Viewing Information on Maps 
 After the APs are placed and their locations are saved, WCS recomputes the RF cover-
age and displays the results as a heatmap. By default, the heatmap is always displayed on 
the map and updated every 5 minutes. You can control the heatmap display with the AP 
Heatmaps check box found in the Floor Settings portion of the maps page, to the left of 
the map display, as shown in  Figure  18-15 . 
 You can also control which APs contribute to the heatmap computation. For example, you 
might want to see what might happen if an AP was removed. Select the right arrow next to 
AP Heatmaps to display a list of contributing APs that are located on the map. Then select 
or deselect specific APs and observe the effect on the heatmap. In  Figure  18-16 , three APs 
have been deselected, resulting in a white area of no signal in the heatmap.

376  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 By default, WCS maps display AP icons and their names. You can select many other AP 
labels instead, including AP MAC addresses, transmit power levels, channel numbers, 
controller IP address, utilization, associated clients, and so on.  Figure  18-17 shows the 
complete list of AP label choices.  
 Figure 18-17  Selecting AP Icon Labels in a WCS Map. 
 WCS maps can also display client locations. This is a useful function that can help you 
pinpoint a client’s whereabouts within the network. If you have an MSE integrated with 
WCS, clients will be located and displayed on the maps automatically. You can still 
display a client’s location even without an MSE. Select  Monitor > Clients and filter for 
the client’s MAC address or other information. Once the list of clients is displayed, click 
the link that represents the client’s name to display detailed information about it. Select 
 Recent Map  in the drop-down list and click the  Go button to display the map where the 
client was last known to be located. WCS will display the floor view map with an icon 
showing the client’s location and MAC address, as demonstrated in  Figure  18-18 . 
 WCS can also display interference sources that have been detected by CleanAir capable 
APs. Select the right arrow to the right of Access Points in the Floor Settings options list, 
and then check the  Show Detected Interferers box. By default, up to two interferers 
will be shown in each AP label.  Figure   18-19 shows an example map with some interfer-
ence sources identified.

 For the CCNA Wireless exam, you should be familiar with generating standard, built-in 
reports for network inventory, CleanAir, client information, AP information, and net-
work utilization.  
 From the report launch pad, select the type of report you want. For example,  Figure  18-
21 shows how a Device > Inventory report has been selected. You might see a list of pre-
configured or saved reports. You can select the check box next to one of those or click 
the  New button to create a new report.

 When you create a new report, you can give it a title and select a specific type of report 
from a prepopulated list. In  Figure   18-22 , an inventory report is being configured as 
a Combined Inventory type, which will give information about both APs and control-
lers. You can also specify when the report should be run—either on a scheduled basis 
or right now. If you click the  Run Now button, the report will run immediately and be 
displayed within WCS. If you enable scheduling instead, most likely you will not access 
WCS to view the report when it is run. Therefore, you can choose to have the report 
automatically saved in a file on the WCS server or sent in an email.

When 802.11 and non-802.11 devices come together, the two can interfere with each 
other. Wireless interference can make WLAN performance sluggish or completely unus-
able. This chapter covers some common types of devices that can cause interference and 
the Cisco CleanAir features that can detect and react to the interference sources.

386  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Understanding Types of Interference 
 Recall from  Chapter   3   , “RF Signals in the Real World,” that APs can interfere with each 
other. If two APs are configured to use the same channel and are in close proximity to 
each other, co-channel interference results. If the APs are set to use adjacent or overlap-
ping channels, adjacent channel interference occurs. 
 While those types of interference can certainly be destructive, they involve devices that 
are based on the 802.11 standard. For example, each access point (AP) transmits on a 
specific channel (possibly the wrong one!), uses a standardized channel width, and always 
transmits frames in the 802.11 format. As well, each AP should also follow the 802.11 
rules for clear channel assessment (CCA) to maintain some etiquette to share the airtime.  
 Rogue APs can be a significant and pesky source of interference because they usually 
belong to someone else. In other words, someone outside your organization is free to 
bring up their own APs on channels of their choosing. As long as signals from their APs 
can be received within your own AP cells, you might have to deal with the interference. 
To mitigate the problem, you must do one of the following: 
  ■ 
 Find the rogue AP and its owner, and then convince the owner to remove the AP or
change its channel. 
  ■ 
 Move your own AP to a different channel, which may cause other nearby APs to be
moved too. 
 When 802.11 devices interfere with each other, the result is usually poor performance 
due to frame retransmissions, errors, and the lack of available airtime. In other words, 
the 802.11 data can still be detected but not always correctly received. In contrast, non-
802.11 devices do not have to obey any of the familiar 802.11 rules. When a non-802.11 
device transmits, the result is completely incompatible with 802.11. APs and 802.11 cli-
ents will view the signal as unintelligible and regard it as noise.  
 The following sections provide an overview of some common non-802.11 devices that 
can interfere with a WLAN. As you work through this chapter, keep the following two 
terms in mind: 
  ■ 
 Interference:     802.11 signals that come from sources other than expected APs
  ■ 
 Noise:  Signals or radio frequency (RF) energy that do not come from 802.11 sources 
 Bluetooth 
 Bluetooth is a technology used to form a personal-area network (PAN), in an effort 
to unify telephony and computing devices. Today, Bluetooth can be found integrated 
into cell phones, PDAs, laptops, desktops, printers, headsets, cameras, and video game 
consoles. Bluetooth has low power consumption, making it a good choice for mobile, 
battery-powered devices.  
Key 
Topic

Chapter 19: Dealing with Wireless Interference  387
 Bluetooth began as Versions 1.0 and 1.0b, developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest 
Group (SIG). For a time, several Bluetooth versions were incorporated into the IEEE 
802.15.1 standard, but that standard is no longer maintained. The Bluetooth SIG contin-
ued to develop its own standard, currently published as core Version 4. 
 Tip  You can find the Bluetooth SIG at  http://www.bluetooth.org . 
 Bluetooth devices are grouped into three classes according to their radiated power. 
Classes 1 and 2 are the most common and use a maximum transmit power level of 1 and 
2.5 mW, respectively. Because Bluetooth operates as a PAN, class 1 and 2 devices use 
a relatively low transmit power level and have a range of only 35 feet. Less common, 
“industrial” Bluetooth class 3 devices can operate at up to 100 mW. 
 Up to eight devices can be paired or linked into a PAN, with one device taking a master 
role and the others operating as slaves. Devices operate in the 2.4-GHz ISM band, but 
are not compatible with the 802.11 standard. Bluetooth uses a frequency hopping spread 
spectrum (FHSS) technique, with devices moving through a predefined sequence of 79 
channels with a bandwidth of 1 MHz each. 
 Bluetooth transmitters could potentially interfere with the majority of the 2.4-GHz 
band because their channels overlap with the three non-overlapping 802.11 channels. 
Bluetooth devices can interfere at a close range because of their low transmit power. If 
there are many Bluetooth devices in an 802.11 cell, they can create a saturation effect 
that tends to starve wireless LAN devices for airtime. Be aware that people commonly 
carry Bluetooth phones, headsets, and computer peripherals right into your WLAN. You 
might have a difficult time finding them and convincing their owners to leave them out-
side your wireless network.  
 ZigBee 
 ZigBee is wireless LAN technology that is based around relatively low power consump-
tion and low data rates (20 to 250 Kbps). As a result, it offers reliable communication. 
ZigBee is commonly used for energy management and home and building automation 
applications. 
 ZigBee is defined in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It allocates the 2.4-GHz ISM band into 
16 channels of 5 MHz each. Even though ZigBee uses the same band as 802.11 devices, 
it has a low duty cycle and does not utilize a channel much of the time. As well, ZigBee 
devices normally use a low transmit power level, which minimizes interference, but can 
ramp up to a maximum of 60 mW when necessary.

 Cordless Phones 
 Cordless phones use several wireless technologies to connect remote handsets to a cen-
tral base station. Phones that are advertised to use the 2.4- and 5.8-GHz bands do just 
that—and can cause significant interference with nearby WLANs. Cordless phones can 
use one channel at a time, but can also change channels dynamically. As well, transmit 
power levels can rise up to 250 mW, overpowering an AP at maximum power.  
 The Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard was developed 
by ETSI and uses the upper portion of the 1.8 GHz band in Europe, Asia, Australia, and 
South America. In the United States, cordless phones are based on DECT 6.0, which uses 
the 1.9-GHz band.  
 Because DECT and DECT 6.0 phones do not use the 2.4-GHz ISM band, they should 
not interfere with 802.11 WLANs. However, some similar “DECT-like” phones may 
operate in the 2.4- and 5.8-GHz bands and interfere. 
 Microwave Ovens 
 You might not think of a microwave oven as a communication device. After all, micro-
wave ovens are designed to cook food—not to transmit data. To heat food, liquids, and 
make popcorn, a microwave oven transmits RF energy into a sealed cavity. The energy is 
meant to stay inside the oven where it can penetrate food items.  
 In practice, the RF shielding around microwave oven doors is not ideal, causing some 
amount of energy to leak out into the surrounding area. Like many other consumer 
devices, microwave ovens are free to use the 2.4-GHz ISM band. In fact, most micro-
waves produce a signal that spreads over a large portion of the band. The signal is simply 
crudely transmitted energy that does not need to follow any standard or frame format. 
Microwaves are commonly rated to generate around 700 W of power inside the oven. 
Leaked energy often interferes with nearby APs and 802.11 devices.  
 To mitigate interference coming from microwave ovens, you can move the oven farther 
away from WLAN coverage areas. Even better, suggest that the oven be swapped out for 
a commercial model that has higher-quality RF shielding around the oven and its door. 
 WiMAX 
 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is a wireless technology 
designed to provide “last mile” broadband access to consumers within a geographic area. 
WiMAX does not require line of sight with a base station, so it can offer connectivity to 
many fixed and mobile users within a 3 to 10-km radius. 
 WiMAX is defined by the WiMAX Forum and published as the IEEE 802.16 standard. 
Although WiMAX, with its central base station and a shared wireless medium, sounds 
similar to 802.11 WLANs, the two are incompatible. WiMAX operates in several bands 

Chapter 19: Dealing with Wireless Interference  389
between 2 and 11 GHz and from 10 to 66 GHz. Depending on the frequency being 
used, WiMAX can possibly interfere with 802.11 devices, but such interference is highly 
unlikely. No widely deployed solutions use the ISM bands; the systems that are adver-
tised for ISM are not supported by any major WiMAX players.  
 Tip  You can find the WiMAX Forum at  http://www.wimaxforum.org . 
 Other Devices 
 You may encounter other types of non-802.11 devices in and around a WLAN. The fol-
lowing devices can cause varying degrees of interference: 
  ■ 
 Canopy:     A fixed wireless broadband technology developed by Motorola for
Internet service providers; uses the 900-MHz, 2.4-GHz, 5.2-GHz, 5.4-GHz, and 5.7-
GHz bands. 
  ■ 
 Continuous transmitter:     A device that transmits a continuous, generic waveform
that causes steady interference. 
  ■ 
 Jammer:     A device that is designed to disrupt radio signals so that channels or bands
become completely unusable. 
  ■ 
 SuperAG:     A proprietary set of extensions developed by Atheros to make Wi-Fi
transmissions more efficient. SuperG (802.11g) and SuperAG (both 802.11a and
802.11g) define schemes to compress frames, send bursts of frames, and bond chan-
nels for improved throughput. However, they are incompatible with the 802.11
standard and can cause interference. 
  ■ 
 Video camera:     Wireless security cameras that transmit on the 900-MHz, 2.4-GHz,
and 5.8-GHz bands with analog or non-802.11 signals. 
  ■ 
 WiFi invalid channel:     Wireless devices that use a nonstandard channel or one that
is slightly offset from the familiar channel numbers and center frequencies in the
2.4- and 5-GHz bands. These devices are proprietary and can be difficult to detect
because they sit on unexpected frequencies. They can overlap normal 802.11 chan-
nels and cause interference. 
  ■ 
 WiFi inverted:     Devices that invert the components of an RF signal from what is
normally expected. The inverted signals appear as noise to 802.11 devices. However,
two inverted devices can correctly receive and use each other’s signal and operate as
an undetectable wireless bridge. 
  ■ 
 Xbox:     A video game console developed by Microsoft. Its wireless controller uses a
frequency-hopping technique that can interfere with 802.11 devices in the 2.4-GHz
band.

 Using Cisco CleanAir to Manage Interference 
 As you have learned in this book, WLANs use the same unlicensed bands as many other 
technologies and devices. If the RF conditions in your environment are superb, such that 
your 802.11 APs and clients can enjoy clear channels with low noise and no interference, 
users will be happy and your job will become easier. However, it is all too easy for some-
one to power up a rogue AP or a non-802.11 device that begins to interfere with your 
network. 
 If some portion of your wireless network begins to have degraded performance, wire-
less interference might be occurring there. How should you approach such a problem? 
First, you should figure out what type of device is generating the interference. Then you 
should attempt to locate the device so that you can negotiate with its owner to have it 
disabled. If that is not possible, you should move your AP onto a different channel that 
is clear from interference.  
 Any Cisco lightweight AP can measure both noise and interference as it scans the chan-
nels in a band, as part of the RRM process.  Figure  19-1 shows an example of the infor-
mation gathered from the 2.4-GHz radio of an AP. The noise level appears to be very 
low and acceptable on every channel. The Interference by Channel graph displays the 
received strength of an interference source in dBm on the left vertical axis (dark blue) 
and the duty cycle of the interference in percent on the right vertical axis (red).  Figure 
 19-1 shows fairly strong interference on channels 4 through 6, but at a very low duty 
cycle. Although that is good information to have, can you tell what sort of thing is caus-
ing the interference?  
 Tip  You can display the results by selecting  Monitor > Access Points > Radios >
802.11a/n or  802.11b/g/n . Find an AP of interest in the list, and then scroll over to the 
right side of the page. Click the blue drop-down menu and select  Details . 
 Figure 19-1  Basic Channel Quality Information Gathered by an AP. 

Chapter 19: Dealing with Wireless Interference  391
 To accurately detect and identify interference, you should use a spectrum analyzer, 
which sweeps through a range of frequencies and displays the signal strength it receives 
on each one. Spectrum analyzers can display this information in many forms so that it is 
easier to see patterns in the RF activity. Rather than rely on your own ability to recog-
nize interference patterns, many spectrum analyzers offer their own intelligence. They 
can recognize and identify specific types of devices that are causing interference based 
on patterns and signatures in the spectrum data. 
 Now imagine carrying a spectrum analyzer throughout an entire WLAN to look for wire-
less interference. You never know where interference might crop up or how long it will 
last. What if you could have a spectrum analyzer permanently located at each AP? 
 Cisco CleanAir does just that; APs, such as the 3500 and 3600 models, have spectrum 
analysis capability built built right in to the radio hardware. While a CleanAir AP is busy 
operating its normal basic service sets (BSSs) on a channel, it can also monitor RF energy 
on that channel, analyze the data, and report specific information about any interfering 
devices—all without interrupting normal WLAN operation.  
 Anything that the AP receives and recognizes as an 802.11 frame is processed normally 
by the split MAC architecture. Other signals that cannot be demodulated according to 
any known modulation and coding scheme must be coming from a non-802.11 source. 
That signal information is processed by the spectrum analysis hardware in the AP, as 
shown in  Figure  19-2 .

 Figure 19-2  Overview of CleanAir Operation. 
 The spectrum information from every AP is sent up to the corresponding wireless LAN 
controller (WLC), where it can be collected and processed. If an interference source is 
received by more than one AP, the controller can usually correlate the data and realize 
that a single source is involved and not several different ones. WLCs can also pass inter-
ference reports to an MSE to determine an interference source’s location and display it 
on a WCS/NCS map. With CleanAir, interference can be automatically detected, identi-
fied, and the source located—which should make your job easier!  
 Beyond that, a Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) can even react to wireless 
interference automatically. Recall that the Radio Resource Management (RRM) process 
is responsible for working out a channel reuse plan and assigning APs to use specific 
channels in a band—all on a periodic basis. Event-driven RRM can react to interference 
immediately, without waiting for the next scheduled RRM iteration, so that an AP can 
be moved to a different channel to escape the interference.

 Enabling CleanAir 
 CleanAir operates on each band independently. You can enable or disable it globally for 
all APs on a controller by selecting  Wireless > 802.11a/n or  802.11b/g/n > CleanAir 
and using the  CleanAir  check box, as shown in  Figure  19-3 . By default, CleanAir is dis-
abled globally on a controller.  
 Figure 19-3  Enabling CleanAir Globally on a Controller. 
 By default, APs will report the interference types listed in  Table  19-2 to their respec-
tive controller. You can change this behavior by selecting a type and moving it to the 
Interferences to Ignore or Interferences to Detect list. You can also select which types 
will generate an SNMP trap from the controller when they are detected. Otherwise, any 
types not selected will not be reported.

 Tip  An AP must be configured for either local or monitor mode before it can generate 
CleanAir interference reports. Reporting is not possible in the Spectrum Only Monitor 
Mode (SOMM). 
 As interference sources are detected and classified according to interference type, the 
AP also measures the RSSI and the duty cycle of the interferer. The duty cycle is the 
percentage of time the source is transmitting on the channel, which indicates its persis-
tence or how much of the airtime the interferer is consuming. The AP combines the RSSI 
and duty cycle into a severity index value. Severity ranges from 0 (not severe) to 100 
(very severe). Interference with a high severity rating can render a channel unusable. 
 Interference detection reports sent to a controller include the AP name, interference 
type, affected channel, timestamp, severity, duty cycle, and RSSI. The controller then 
tries to determine whether the same interference source is involved in reports coming 
from multiple APs. If so, the source is uniquely identified by assigning it a cluster ID. A 
cluster ID is actually a pseudo-MAC address that represents the non-802.11 device with 
a familiar wireless identifier.  
 You can display a list of interference detection reports on a controller by selecting 
 Monitor > CleanAir > 802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n > Interference Devices .  Figure  19-4 
shows an example list.  

394  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 19-4  Example List of Interference Device Reports. 
 Air-Quality Index 
 As APs and controllers work together to generate a list of interference reports, the list 
can grow quite long. For example, the controller from  Figure  19-4 has a list of 263 
reports from the 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n band alone. To get a feel for the RF conditions 
on any one channel and AP, you would have to read through the list of reports manually 
and guess the cumulative effect that various interferers were having.  
 Cisco WLCs can do a better analysis by calculating an air-quality index (AQI) for each 
AP and its channels. The AQI indicates WiFi health within an AP’s cell, as indicated by a 
scale from 0 (unusable) to 100 (perfect). You can display the air quality metrics for every 
AP on a controller by selecting  Monitor > CleanAir > 802.11a/n or  802.11b/g/n > 
CleanAir > Air Quality Report , as shown in  Figure  19-5 . You can see a summary of the 
AP with the worst air-quality rating in each band by selecting  Worst Air-Quality Report . 
 Air-quality ratings are updated dynamically. Each AP measures RF conditions once a 
second and then calculates an air quality value every 15 seconds and a summary every 30 
seconds. By default, these values are reported to the AP’s controller every 15 minutes. 
 You can also view an AP’s CleanAir activity more frequently through the rapid update 
mode. To access this mode, use  Monitor > Access Points > 802.11a/n or  802.11b/g/n 
to display a list of APs. Choose an AP, and then select  CleanAir from the blue triangular 
drop-down menu on the right side of the list. In rapid update mode, the controller auto-
matically refreshes the page every 30 seconds with updated CleanAir data.

Chapter 19: Dealing with Wireless Interference  395
 Rapid update mode also shows more detailed CleanAir information from an AP. In 
 Figure   19-6   , the AP has detected interference from a microwave oven. The air quality is 
shown as a bar graph. Normally only the one channel used by an AP is shown; if the AP 
is in monitor mode, all channels are shown. The same page also shows channel utilization 
and interference power measured by the AP. 
 Controllers display air quality on a per-AP (and channel) basis, and this information 
is aggregated further by Wireless Control System/Network Control System/Prime 
Infrastructure (WCS/NCS/PI). Air quality is summarized for the entire set of controllers 
that are managed in the enterprise.   
 Figure 19-5  Displaying Air-Quality Indices for all APs on a Controller. 

396  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Using Event-Driven RRM 
 By default, APs and controllers work together to detect, classify, and report wireless 
interference from non-802.11 devices. CleanAir and RRM can work together so that 
controllers actually take some action on interference events at the regular RRM inter-
vals. By default, RRM runs the DCA algorithm every 10 minutes, but you can increase 
the interval up to 24 hours. If non-802.11 interference occurs near an AP, the controller 
must wait until the next dynamic channel allocation (DCA) interval before it can move 
the AP away from the unusable channel.  
 When Event-Driven RRM (ED-RRM) is enabled, the normal periodic RRM DCA process 
is triggered immediately in response to interference reported by an AP. ED-RRM must 
be enabled and then triggered based on an AQI threshold. You can set the threshold to 
Low (AQI 35), Medium (AQI 50), or High (AQI 60). 
 First, enable ED-RRM globally on a controller. ED-RRM uses the DCA function to 
change an AP’s channel and work out any other channel allocation changes that might 
be needed. Therefore, navigate to the DCA configuration by selecting  Wireless > 
802.11a/n  or  802.11b/g/n > RRM > DCA . Scroll to the bottom of the page to the 
Event Driven RRM section, as shown in  Figure  19-7 . Once you check the  EDRRM box, 
you will be able to select a  Sensitivity Threshold  from the drop-down list. By default, 
the threshold is set to  Medium . You can select Low, Medium, High, or Custom.

 Troubleshooting Client Connectivity 
 When one or more network users report that they are having problems, your first course 
of action should be to gather more information. Begin with a broad perspective and then 
try to ask pointed questions that will narrow the scope of possible causes. You do not 
want to panic or waste time chasing irrelevant things. Instead, ask questions and try to 
notice patterns or similarities in the answers you receive. 
 For example, if you get reports from many people in the same area, perhaps an access 
point (AP) is misconfigured or malfunctioning. Reports from many areas or from a single 
service set identifier (SSID) may indicate problems with a controller. However, if you 
receive a report of only one wireless user having problems, it might not make sense to 
spend time troubleshooting a controller, where many users are supported. Instead, you 
should focus on that one user’s client device and its interaction with an AP. 
 As you prepare to troubleshoot a single wireless client, think about all of the things a 
client needs to join and use the network.  Figure  20-1 illustrates the following conditions 
that must be met for a successful association: 
  ■ 
  Client is within RF range of an AP, asks to associate.
  ■ 
  Client requests and receives an IP address.
  ■ 
 Client authenticates.

 Try to gather information from the end user to see what the client is experiencing. “I 
cannot connect” or “The WiFi is down” might actually mean that the user’s device can-
not associate, cannot get an IP address, or cannot authenticate. A closer inspection of 
the device might reveal more clues.  
 Can the client associate at all? Most client operating systems display an icon that shows 
whether a wireless adapter is connected or disconnected. If the client is not associated, 
compare its wireless profile settings with the WLAN configuration on the controller. 

406  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
The controller and the client must have identical settings for the following parameters:  
  ■ 
 2.4- or 5-GHz band 
  ■ 
 Data rates and Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS)
  ■ 
 SSID string 
  ■ 
 Wireless security 
  ■ 
 Encryption method 
 Navigate to WLANs, select the WLAN that the client is trying to use, and then review 
the settings on the General, Security, QoS, and Advanced tabs. See whether the client is 
configured appropriately.  
 If the client still cannot associate, be aware that it may be listed in the controller as a 
disabled client. A client can be added to the disabled list manually, usually as a result of 
violating a local security policy, or automatically when the client’s activity matches one 
of the controller’s wireless protection policy signatures. Navigate to  Security > Disabled 
Clients and look for the client’s MAC address in the list. If the list is long, you can also 
search for the MAC address on that page.  
 If the client is able to associate, verify that it has an IP address. Does the client have an 
IP address from a subnet on the correct WLAN? If it does not show an address, check 
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to make sure that the respec-
tive DHCP scope is not already full. Remember that the controller acts as a DHCP relay, 
accepting the client’s DHCP request and forwarding it on to the server. If an address is 
offered in return, the controller relays that back to the client.  
 Tip  Because the controller relays the DHCP offer, it will substitute its own virtual inter-
face address as the DHCP server’s. Do not be surprised to see the controller virtual gate-
way IP address, such as 1.1.1.1, or an address that differs from the actual server, when 
you display the DHCP information on the client. 
 Troubleshooting Clients from the Controller 
 As a wireless client probes and attempts to associate with an AP, it is essentially com-
municating with the controller. You can access a wealth of troubleshooting information 
from the controller, as long as you know the client’s MAC address. 
 You can view a client’s current status by navigating to  Monitor > Clients . The controller 
will display every client that is associated to any of its APs. To find a specific client in 
the long list of clients, click the  Change Filter link. You can then filter the list based on 
MAC address, AP name, WLAN profile or SSID, client status, client radio type, or work-
group bridge (WGB) mode. In  Figure   20-2 , the list will be filtered to display only client 
MAC address 00:01:36:19:12:4a.

 Click the client MAC address link to display all the known detailed information about 
the client. The page begins with client properties, as shown in  Figure  20-3 , which lists 
useful parameters such as the client’s IP address, the AP name and type, and the AP’s 
MAC address. 
 Scrolling further down, you will find a section of information about the client’s current 
operating state, as demonstrated in  Figure  20-4 . From this information, you can learn 
that the client supports CCXv4. The client’s mobility role is Local, which means it has a 
normal association to the local controller. If the mobility role is shown as Anchor, the 
client has undergone a Layer 3 roam to another controller with the mobility peer IP 
address listed. Toward the bottom of the page, you can see the list of data rates the cli-
ent supports, in addition to its current transmit data rate (TxRateSet) of 18 Mbps.

 Perhaps the most important information about the client is listed as the policy manager 
state, which is highlighted in  Figure   20-4 . Before a controller will permit a client to fully 
associate with a basic service set (BSS), the client must progress through a sequence of 
states. Each state refers to a policy that the client must meet before moving on to the 
next state.  Table   20-2    lists and describes the client policy states. 
 Table 20-2  Possible WLC Client States 
 State 
 Description 
 START 
 Client activity has just begun. 
 AUTHCHECK  
 Client must pass Layer 2 authentication policy. 
 8021X_REQD  
 Client must pass 802.1x authentication. 
 L2AUTHCOMPLETE  
 Layer 2 policy is complete; Layer 3 policies can begin. 
 WEP_REQD  
 Client must authenticate with Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP). 
 DHCP_REQD  
 WLC is waiting to learn the client’s IP address. 
 WEBAUTH_REQD  
 Client must pass web authentication. 
 RUN 
 Client has passed Layer 2 and Layer 3 policies, successfully 
associated, and can pass traffic. 
 A probing client always begins in the START state and then moves into Layer 2 policy 
states and Layer 3 policy states. For example, if the client is attempting to associate with 
a WLAN that is configured for some form of 802.1x authentication, the client must pass 
through the 8021X_REQD state. If it successfully authenticates, it can move further 
down the list of states.  
 Ultimately, each client should end up in the RUN state, where it has fully associated 
with the BSS and is permitted to pass traffic over the WLAN. If you find a client that is 
consistently shown in a state other than RUN, the client must be having a problem pass-
ing the policy of that state.  
 For example, a client that is stuck in 8021X_REQD is likely having trouble authenticat-
ing successfully. That could be because the client is sending an incorrect key, has an 
invalid certificate, or because the RADIUS server is down. 
 A client stuck in DHCP_REQD is having trouble obtaining an IP address. The control-
ler monitors the DHCP request of each client, as well as the DHCP offer returned to 
each client. If an offer is not seen, the client is stuck waiting. (One exception is a client 
that is using a static IP address, without the need for DHCP. So long as the WLAN is 
configured to not require DHCP, the controller will move the client on through the 
DHCP_REQD state.)  
 Toward the bottom of the client details page, you will find a list of client statistics, such 
as those shown in  Figure   20-5   . The controller maintains counters for the number of 
bytes and packets sent and received by the client. You can also see the received signal 
Key 
Topic

strength indicator (RSSI) value of the client and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value, as 
measured by the AP. This can give you a good idea about how well the client’s signal is 
being received. The data retries, request to send (RTS) retries, and duplicates counters 
help indicate congested conditions on the AP’s channel.  More congestion generally 
results in more retries, where frames must be re-sent.  
 Figure 20-5  Displaying Client Statistics. 
 You can also select the blue drop-down menu at the right end of the client entry to man-
age the client’s association, as shown in  Figure  20-6 . Selecting  Remove will deauthen-
ticate the client and force it off the network, so that it will attempt to associate again. 
Selecting  Disable  will add the client’s MAC address to the list of disabled clients and 
will force the client off the network.  
 Figure 20-6  Managing a Client Association. 

Chapter 20: Troubleshooting WLAN Connectivity  411
 Performing a Link Test 
 You can select  Link Test  to perform a short test to gauge the RF conditions between 
the controller and the client. If the client does not support Cisco Compatible Extensions 
Version 4 (CCXv4) or CCXv5, the controller will run a ping test consisting of 20 500-
byte Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets sent to the client’s IP 
address. The client should reply to each of the ping packets if the wireless link is good 
and if the client supports ping traffic. The controller also records the RSSI of the client 
device and the SNR and reports the test results as shown in  Figure  20-7 . 
 Figure 20-7  Results of a Ping Test to a Client Device. 
 Notice that the ping test reports only a single RSSI value. Even though a wireless link is 
bidirectional and involves two devices, the AP and the client, the controller can report 
only on the RSSI of the signal it receives from the client. Naturally, the client can (and 
probably does) measure the RSSI of the AP’s signal that it receives, but it cannot share 
that information with the controller using ping packets.  
 If you perform a link test on a client that does support CCXv4 or CCXv5, the controller 
can gather much more information about the conditions at  both ends of the link. In that 
case, the link test uses CCX messages rather than pings. A client with the more advanced 
CCX versions can return its own signal quality data to the controller.  
 Figure   20-8    shows an example of a link test with a CCXv4 client. The controller displays 
the round-trip time of the CCX exchange, the RSSI and SNR as measured at the client 
and the controller, and frame retries. The last two sets of data show the data rate used 
by the AP and the client (that is, 54 Mbps) and the MCS index and frame count in both 
directions.

 Debugging a Client 
 Sometimes you might encounter a client that is having trouble connecting, but nothing 
seems to be obviously wrong. For example, a controller might show that the client is 
stuck in the 8021X_REQD or DHCP_REQD state, but you are not able to figure out 
why. Perhaps the client does not even get that far along in its attempts to associate. If 
you know which AP and controller the client is attempting to associate with, you can 
gather useful debugging information.  
 From the controller command-line interface (CLI), enter the command  debug client 
 client-mac-address . Be sure to configure your terminal emulator session to log or save 
all of the output that scrolls by so that you can go back and review it closely.  Example 
 20-1 lists the output produced by the  debug client 60:67:20:9a:9e:fa command, as the 
client attempts to join the wireless network. The  debug command can provide extensive 
information about processes running in the AP and the WLC while the client authenti-
cates. Much of the command output is cryptic, but you can pick out important events in 
the life of the client as it  interacts with the controller. Only the important lines of output 
have been extracted and listed in  Example  20-1 .

 The  debug client  command can also prove useful when you are troubleshooting roaming 
issues, as a client moves from one AP to another on the same controller or between two 
controllers. In the latter case, you can use  debug client  on multiple controllers, collect 
the output from each CLI session, and find the point where the client leaves one AP and 
reassociates with another.  
 Troubleshooting Clients from WCS/NCS 
 Most of the troubleshooting tools described in this chapter must be used from a con-
troller. What if your network is large and consists of many controllers? You might 
have a hard time figuring out which controller a client is trying to join so that you can 
gather information about it. Instead, you can simply move further upstream and trouble-
shoot the client from the Wireless Control System/Network Control System/Prime 
Infrastructure (WCS/NCS/PI), at the point where all of the controllers are centrally man-
aged. 
 You can search for a single wireless client in the entire database of active clients. 
Enter all or a part of the client’s MAC address into the search box in the upper-right 
corner and click the right arrow to begin the search. In  Figure  20-9 , MAC address 
00:09:ef:11:2e:e3 has been entered. When the search is complete, you are prompted 
with the results, as shown in  Figure   20-10 . Select the entry in the Monitor tab that you 
want to display.  
 The search results will be displayed in a Clients and Users page, as shown in  Figure  20-
11 . Selecting the radio button of the desired entry will display much more information 
about it lower on the page, beginning with the client attributes shown in  Figure  20-12 . 
From this information, you can verify things such as the client’s IP address, vendor, and 
power save mode, in addition to details about the AP where the client is joined and the 
security parameters in use.

 You might notice one thing that is missing from all of the client information presented: 
the client’s RSSI value. In the previous section, you learned that a controller can display a 
current RSSI that it learned from the AP. WCS and NCS are positioned further upstream 
to collect client statistics from all controllers and all APs. They also maintain a database 
that contains a history of the client activity. 
 For example, the client details page also contains an association history in two different 
scrolling lists, as shown in  Figure   20-13 . The first list contains the APs and controllers 
the client was associated with most recently, along with a time stamp and the duration of 
each association. If the controllers were able to determine a reason for the client chang-
ing its association, that reason is displayed too.  
 The second association history list forms a continuous timeline of the client’s path 
through the wireless network. Each time stamp marks an association change or a roam 
and identifies the APs that the client was associated with before and after the roam. If 
you piece this information together, you can trace the path that the client took as it 
moved throughout its journey. Sometimes you can figure out locations where the RF 
coverage might be lacking. For instance, you might see that the client left the network 
near a stairwell in the basement, only to reappear somewhere on the fourth floor. 
 Further down on the client details page, you will find graphs that represent a history of 
the client’s RSSI values and the SNR, as shown in  Figure  20-14 . 
 Figure 20-12  Displaying Client Attributes (Continued Screen from  Figure  20-11 ). 

418  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 20-14  Displaying a Client’s RSSI and SNR History. 
 You can also use WCS/NCS to perform some interactive troubleshooting on a client. 
Select the client’s radio button and then click the  Troubleshoot button at the top of the 
page (refer to  Figure   20-11   ). WCS/NCS will collect debug client information from the 
controller and will display the results in a graphical format, breaking the client associa-
tion process down into the following steps:

 WCS/NCS will also interpret the results and display suggested actions, all on the cli-
ent details page. In  Figure   20-15   , the client d4:20:6d:90:ad:22 has failed to authenti-
cate to the WLAN. Notice that the 802.11 association step has a check mark, whereas 
802.1x authentication has a caution triangle. The problem is shown to be “802.1x 
Authentication Failure,” and you are given a series of parameters to check as part of 
your troubleshooting efforts.  
 Tip  If WCS/NCS does not show any obvious problems after you click the 
 Troubleshoot  button, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click the  Check 
Again button. The troubleshooting information will refresh with new results.

 Troubleshooting AP Connectivity 
 In cases where you get reports from multiple users who are all having problems in the 
same general area, you might need to focus your efforts on an AP. The problem could 
be as simple as a defective radio, where no clients are receiving a signal. In that case, you 
might have to go onsite to confirm that the transmitter is not working correctly.  
 Otherwise, the split-MAC architecture creates several different points where you can 
troubleshoot. Recall the Cisco Unified Wireless Network (CUWN) structure illustrated 
in  Figure   20-16   . To successfully operate the lightweight AP and provide a working BSS, 
the following two things must work correctly:  
  ■ 
 The LAP must have connectivity to its access layer switch.
  ■ 
 The LAP must have connectivity to its WLC.

 Verifying AP-to-WLC Connectivity 
 First, verify the connectivity between an AP and a controller. Usually you will do this 
when a new AP is installed, to make sure it is able to discover and join a controller 
before clients arrive and try to use the wireless network. You can also do this at any time 
as a quick check of the AP’s health.  
 The easiest approach is to simply look for the AP in the list of live APs that have joined 
the controller. If you know which controller the AP should join, open a management 
session to it. Navigate to  Wireless > All APs > Change Filter , and then enter the AP’s 
MAC address or some portion of its name. In  Figure  20-17 , the controller is being 
searched for an AP with d208 in its name. Fortunately, the search reveals a live AP that 
is joined to the controller, as shown in  Figure  20-18 . You can click the AP name link to 
display more information about the AP and to configure its parameters. From the details 
listed on the General tab, as shown in  Figure  20-19 , you can also verify the IP address 
that the AP is using.   

Chapter 20: Troubleshooting WLAN Connectivity  421
 Figure 20-17  Searching a Controller for an AP. 
 Figure 20-18  Reviewing the Search Results. 
 As long as the controller shows the AP with an appropriate IP address, you can assume 
that there is a working Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) 
tunnel between the two. If clients are reporting problems with one SSID that they have 
in common, you should review the WLAN configuration on the controller to make sure 
it is bound to the correct controller interface and to the correct VLAN. 
 If your network is large and you have many controllers, you might not know which one 
the AP has joined. You can look from a more broad perspective by searching for the AP 
on WCS, NCS, or PI.

 Verifying AP-to-Network Connectivity 
 If you do not find the AP joined to a controller, you will have to move your focus fur-
ther away from the controller and onto the AP and its wired connection.  
 Does the AP have an IP address? Without the help of a controller, you might have to 
connect to the AP console and watch the logging information scroll by as the AP tries to 
boot, get an address, and find a controller to join. You can also query the DHCP server 
to see whether the AP has an active address lease. If it is not able to get an address from 
a DHCP server, check the address scope on the server to ensure that the address space is 
not exhausted.  
 Tip     To connect to the CLI of an AP, you need to enter some credentials. By default, log 
in with username Cisco and password Cisco. The default enable secret password is also 
Cisco. 
 If the AP is having trouble joining a controller, verify that the switch port configuration 
where the AP is connected. A lightweight AP needs only a single VLAN to support the 
CAPWAP tunnel. All WLANs are transported over the tunnel without the need for sepa-
rate VLANs. In contrast, an autonomous AP has no CAPWAP tunnel, so it needs a trunk

link that can carry individual WLANs over VLANs. The switch port configuration should 
look like one of those shown in  Table  20-3 .

 Finally, recall that a lightweight AP tries a variety of methods to discover viable control-
lers to join. Most likely, the DHCP server has been configured to send DHCP option 43 
with lease offers to APs. Option 43 is a string of hex digits that contain the IP addresses 
of one or more controllers. The DHCP server might not have option 43 configured at all, 
or it could have a typo or error in the hex string. 
 Sometimes you might connect an AP and wait a very long time for it to join a control-
ler, only to find that it does not. First, check the controller licensing to make sure that 
there are enough available licenses for the AP. If you still cannot figure out what the AP 
is doing, you can connect directly to its console port and watch the logging information 
scroll by as the AP attempts to discover controllers.  
 The console output listed in  Example  20-2 shows that the AP is not able to obtain 
an IP address so it can join the wired network. In  Example  20-3 , the AP picked up 
a list of three candidate controller IP addresses (192.168.90.22, 192.168.90.23, and 
192.168.90.16) from the DHCP server. However, the AP then tries to initiate a DTLS 
tunnel (part of CAPWAP) to a controller known as m7-c1 at address 172.22.253.17, and 
successfully joins it. Perhaps this AP was previously configured with a primary controller 
address elsewhere before it was installed on the network. Therefore, it used an unex-
pected controller address.

    This chapter covers the following topics: 
  ■ 
 Accessing WLC and AP Management Interfaces —
This section describes the methods you can use to
interact with a controller and its access points for
configuration and monitoring. 
  ■ 
 Maintaining WLC Code Images —This section 
explains how you can verify a controller’s code
image and how you can upgrade it.
  ■ 
 Maintaining WLC Configurations —This section 
discusses the controller configuration and how to
save it and back it up.
  ■ 
 Working with WLC Logs —This section covers 
controller activity logs and how you can display and
record them. 
 This chapter covers the following exam topics: 
  ■ 
  Transfer logs, configuration files, and O/S images to
and from the WLC via the GUI
  ■ 
  Differentiate and use WLC and AP (autonomous
and LAP) management access methods (console
port, CLI, telnet, ssh, http, https, and wired vs wire-
less management) 

 Like Cisco routers, switches, and other networking devices, wireless LAN controllers 
maintain configuration files, run operating system images, and generate logs. As a CCNA 
Wireless engineer, you will likely be involved in maintaining controllers on a network 
and dealing with the information and files they use. This chapter explains how you can 
interface with controllers and APs so that you can upload and download their files.

 Accessing WLC and AP Management Interfaces 
 To interact with and manage a wireless controller, you need a way to connect to it. Cisco 
Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) offer the following access methods:  
  ■ 
 Command-line interface CLI    —You can initiate a CLI session by connecting direct-
ly to the console port (asynchronous serial) or by opening a Telnet or Secure Shell
(SSH) session to the controller’s management interface IP address. 
  ■ 
 Graphical-user interface (GUI)    —You can use a web browser to open a session to
the controller’s management interface IP address.
 Normally, you will manage a WLC through an HTTPS session with a web browser. HTTP 
is disabled by default. You can configure these settings from  Management > HTTP-
HTTPS , as shown in  Figure  21-1 . 
 Figure 21-1  Configuring GUI Access to a Controller. 
 You might need to use the CLI for the initial bootstrap configuration, until a new WLC 
is configured with a management IP address and you can access the web-based GUI. The 
CLI is also useful when you are troubleshooting problems with wireless clients or col-
lecting important output for Cisco TAC.  
 The CLI is based on an operating system called AireOS, which is very different from 
Cisco IOS. Although the AireOS commands are different from IOS, there are a few 
Key 
Topic

Chapter 21: Maintaining Controllers  431
similarities. For example, you can use the  show and  debug commands along with a wide 
variety of keywords to gather specific information. You can type a question mark (?) to 
see a list of possible keywords you can use to complete a command. The Tab key can be 
used to complete a keyword you have started to type. Each configuration change must 
be made with the  config  command followed by keywords. 
 Tip  The CCNA Wireless exam covers controllers that are based on AireOS. Cisco has 
also introduced a line of “converged access” controllers that are based on the familiar 
IOS. At the time of this writing, converged access controllers include the 5760 WLC and 
the Catalyst 3850 switch.   
 The CLI is accessible through the console port, Telnet, and SSH. By default, Telnet 
access is disabled and SSH access is enabled. You can configure these settings from 
 Management > Telnet-SSH , as shown in  Figure   21-2 . It is usually a best practice to keep 
Telnet disabled because keystrokes are sent in clear text, without any encryption.  
 Figure 21-2  Configuring Telnet and SSH Access to a Controller. 
 You can initiate management sessions to a controller from anywhere on the network, 
as long as your IP address can be routed to the controller’s management IP address. 
However, by default, a controller will not permit Telnet, SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS 

432  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
connections from any of its own wireless network subnets. If you need to connect to 
the controller from a WLAN, you can enable access through  Management > Mgmt via 
Wireless , as shown in  Figure   21-3   . Be sure to check the box and click  Apply . Even when 
management via wireless is enabled, the controller will not allow any type of  file uploads 
or downloads.  
 Tip  If you try to access a controller through a web browser from a wireless network, 
you might find that the web login page is not available. In that case, you should check to 
see that the management via wireless setting is enabled. 
 Figure 21-3  Enabling Management Access from a Wireless LAN. 
 Accessing APs 
 You can manage a Cisco autonomous AP’s GUI with a web browser or through a CLI 
session with Telnet, or SSH, if you know the AP’s IP address. You can also connect to it 
through its console port.  
 Lightweight APs (LAPs) differ somewhat. Once an LAP boots and joins a controller, all 
of its functions are configured, managed, and monitored by the controller. Each AP runs 

Chapter 21: Maintaining Controllers  433
a special version of the IOS software, so it is possible to open a CLI management session 
for troubleshooting purposes.  
 By default, LAPs do not permit management Telnet or SSH connections. If you need 
to connect directly to an AP to troubleshoot problems, you can enable Telnet and 
SSH access from  Wireless > Access Points > All APs . Select an AP from the list, and 
then select  Config  from the drop-down menu at the far-right side of the page. On the 
 Advanced  tab, you can use the  Telnet and  SSH check boxes to control management 
access, as shown in  Figure  21-4 . 
 Figure 21-4  Controlling Telnet and SSH Access on a Lightweight AP. 
 You can also connect to the AP’s console port and use the CLI to troubleshoot con-
nection problems. For example, you can watch useful information displayed as the AP 
boots and attempts to discover controllers and enable its radios.  
 Tip  To access the CLI on autonomous or LAPs through their console ports, Telnet, or 
SSH, you can use the default credentials of username Cisco, password Cisco, and enable 
password Cisco. To help prevent unauthorized access, you should change the default cre-
dentials and restrict remote access to your APs. 

434  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Maintaining WLC Code Images 
 Like any other network device, a controller requires a code image to operate. 
Periodically, you might want to upgrade the code image to a new release so that you can 
take advantage of bug fixes and new features. Less often, you might have to downgrade 
the code image to return to a more stable version. 
 A controller maintains two separate code images—a primary image and a backup image. 
When a controller boots, it runs the primary image by default. That means you can 
download a new image file into the backup position on the controller while it is running, 
with no interruption of service. To run the new image, you must reboot the controller. 
You can display the two code image versions by navigating to  Commands > Config 
Boot , as shown in  Figure   21-5   . You can select the image that will be run after the next 
reboot with the Config Boot Image drop-down menu. 
 Figure 21-5  Displaying Controller Code Images. 
 To download a new code image, go to  Commands > Download File . The controller 
can download from a TFTP or an FTP server. Select the code file type, then enter the 
file server’s IP address, file path, and code image filename, as shown in  Figure  21-6 . 
For an FTP download, enter the credentials required by the FTP server. Then, click the 
 Download  button to start the file transfer. 

Chapter 21: Maintaining Controllers  435
 Figure 21-6  Preparing to Download a Code Image. 
 Tip  The file transfer terminology might be a bit different from what you are used to 
seeing. The terms  download  and  upload refer to the controller’s perspective, as if it acts 
like a client. You always download  to  the controller and upload  from it. 
 WLC image files are usually named according to the hardware platform and the release 
number, and ends with an .aes suffix, as in AIR-WISM2-K9-7-2-115-2.aes. During 
the download, the WLC periodically updates the web page to display the following 
sequence of status messages. (This process can take several minutes.)  
 1.  TFTP code transfer starting. 
 2.  TFTP receive complete...extracting components. 
 3.  Executing backup script. 
 4.   Writing new RTOS to flash disk.
 5.   Writing new FP to flash disk.
 6.   Writing new APIB to flash disk.
 7.  Executing install_apib script. 
Key 
Topic

436  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 8.  Executing fini script. 
 9.  TFTP File transfer is successful. 
 At this point, the new image is ready to be used. You must reboot the controller to run 
the new image, according to the status message shown in  Figure  21-7 . Be aware that 
rebooting the controller will interrupt wireless service. All the APs joined to the control-
ler will lose contact with it and will rehome to a secondary controller (if one is config-
ured) or begin the controller discovery process to find a new home. 
 You can get ready to reboot the controller by selecting the  Click Here link at the bot-
tom of the download status or by navigating to  Commands > Reboot , as shown in 
 Figure  21-8   . You can save the current controller configuration and reboot immediately 
by clicking the  Save and Reboot button. 
 Figure 21-7  After an Image Download, the Controller Is Ready to Reboot. 
 After you install a new controller image file, should you install the same code release on 
the lightweight APs? Recall that the controller manages all aspects of the APs, including 
their code images. When a LAP joins a controller, it compares its own code release with 
that of the controller. If the images differ, the AP will download a matching image from 
the controller automatically. Therefore, after the controller reboots and begins to run a 
new image, each AP will download the same release as it rejoins the controller.  

Chapter 21: Maintaining Controllers  437
 As you might imagine, the code upgrade process can impose an extensive outage on a 
wireless network. The controller must be rebooted so that it can begin running the new 
image. After that, each AP must go offline to download the new image, reboot, and 
begin running the new image. To lessen the impact to wireless users, controller releases 
7.2 and later can push a new code image to the APs  before the controller or the APs 
need to reboot. This prepares the APs ahead of time so that they can reboot in parallel 
with the controller and can begin running the new code image much sooner. 
 Maintaining WLC Configurations 
 As you use the web-based controller GUI to make configuration changes, you need to 
click the  Apply  button to make the changes active. This is similar to configuring a router 
or switch, where changes take effect immediately and are updated in the running con-
figuration, but are not saved to the startup configuration. As long as the controller stays 
up, your changes will stay active. If the controller reboots or loses power, your changes 
will be lost.  
 A controller also has nonvolatile storage for its configuration, much like flash memory. 
You can save the configuration by clicking the  Save Configuration link at the upper 
right of any controller web page, as shown in  Figure  21-9 . 
 Figure 21-8  Triggering a Controller Reboot. 

438  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Figure 21-9  Saving the Controller Configuration. 
 It is important to save the controller configuration to flash memory so that any configu-
ration changes are retained. Beyond that, you should think about saving the configura-
tion to a location away from the controller itself. If the controller hardware ever fails 
and you receive a replacement, you will need a way to access the configuration so you 
can import it into the new unit.  
 From the controller GUI, navigate to  Commands > Upload File and select 
 Configuration  from the file type drop-down menu. Select either  TFTP or  FTP and enter 
the IP address, file path, and the target filename, as shown in  Figure  21-10 . The control-
ler configuration will be transferred and saved in clear text, showing the CLI commands 
that are used to build the entire configuration. You can check the  Configuration File 
Encryption  check box and enter an encryption key string to encrypt the configuration 
file so that it cannot be read easily. The file contents will be decrypted when they are 
transferred back onto a WLC.  
 Figure 21-10  Uploading the Controller Configuration to a PC.

Topic

Chapter 21: Maintaining Controllers  439
 You can display the configuration file from a CLI session by entering the command 
 show run-config  commands. Before you enter the command, configure your terminal 
emulator application to save the session output to a file. When you display the configu-
ration file contents, the output will automatically be saved on your PC. 
 Tip  By default, a CLI session will pause the output after every 22 lines of text and 
prompt you for a keystroke to continue. You can disable the paging action by entering 
the  config paging disable  command before displaying large amounts of output. 
 After you have an offline copy of the configuration file, you can download the contents 
to a controller. This process is just the opposite of uploading the configuration to your 
PC, select  Commands > Download File , select file type  Configuration , and enter the 
TFTP or FTP server parameters and filename. 
 Tip  The  show run-config  command, with no additional keywords, displays the entire 
controller configuration, complete with all RF and AP configuration parameters. The out-
put can be enormous if the controller has a large number of APs associated with it. The 
 show run-config  output is normally collected for Cisco TAC or for input into the Cisco 
WLC Config Analyzer tool.  
 Working with WLC Logs 
 While a controller is busy managing connections with APs, handling client traffic, and 
monitoring wireless activity, it also keeps a record of events that occur. You can view 
the controller logs to see more information about important events or share the contents 
with Cisco TAC when you have a service request open. 
 A controller maintains three types of logs, as listed in  Table  21-2 . You can display the 
log contents in a CLI session with the command shown.

 Internal events from controller activity 
 The trap log is probably the most useful to wireless network administrators. Traps are 
messages that are recorded and reported in real time, as events occur. Traps are nor-

440  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
mally sent via SNMP to a management station such as Wireless Control System (WCS), 
Network Control System (NCS), or Prime Infrastructure (PI). Common traps include 
reports of rogue APs that have been detected; APs with excessive client loads, interfer-
ence, or noise; coverage holes that have been detected; CleanAir events; and so on.  
 You can view the trap log from the  Monitor > Summary  page. Look for the  Most 
Recent Traps  section, as shown in  Figure  21-11 . You can select the  View All link to see 
the 256 most recent log entries that have been buffered. 
 Figure 21-11  Viewing the Trap Log. 
 In addition to buffering the log entries, a controller can send each message as an SNMP 
trap to one or more trap receivers. The trap receivers are usually some type of manage-
ment platform that collects traps from a variety of devices and keeps a long term record 
that can be used as an audit trail. From  Management > SNMP > General , enter text 
strings that define a name for the controller, its location, and contact information. You 
can also configure the SNMP version that will be used. In  Figure  21-12 , the controller 
will use SNMPv3 and a username and security method to send traps. 
 Next, define a trap receiver from  Management > SNMP > Trap Receivers , as shown in 
 Figure  21-13   . If the controller has been added into WCS, NCS, or PI, the management 
station will be added as a trap receiver automatically. You can add a new receiver by 
clicking on the  New  button, then entering the receiver’s name and IP address, and then 
selecting  Enable  or  Disable  from the drop-down menu.

the  Management > SNMP > Trap Controls page, you can enable or disable individual 
trap types. The types are organized under a series of tabs, as shown in  Figure  21-14 . The 
trap types from each tab are listed in  Table  21-3 for your reference.

 Advice About the Exam Event —This section 
provides an overview of the exam structure and
the types of questions you will encounter. It also
discusses some strategies for managing your time
during the exam, reviewing before the exam, and
preparing yourself to sit through the exam.
  ■ 
 Final Thoughts —This brief section provides some 
concluding bits of encouragement about your exam
results. 

 Congratulations! You made it through the book, and now it is time to finish getting 
ready for the exam. This chapter helps you get ready to take and pass the exam. You 
should know the content and topics. Now you need to think about what will happen 
during the exam and what you need to do prepare your mind for it. At this point, you 
should be focused on getting yourself ready to pass.  
 Advice About the Exam Event 
 Now that you have finished the bulk of this book, you could just register for your Cisco 
CCNA Wireless exam, show up, and take the exam. However, if you spend a little time 
thinking about the exam event itself and learning more about the user interface of the 
real Cisco exams and the environment at the Vue testing centers, you will be better pre-
pared—particularly if this is your first Cisco exam.  
 Learn the Question Types Using the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial 
 During the time leading up to your exam, think more about the different types of exam 
questions and have a plan for how to approach them. One of the best ways to learn 
about the exam questions is to use the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial.  
 To find the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial, go to  http://www.cisco.com and search 
for “exam tutorial.” The tutorial sits inside a web page with a Flash presentation of the 
exam user interface. Each type of exam question is presented, along with a real-time 
demonstration of the actions you might take when answering the question. You can also 
click the  Try Me  button to reset the question and practice interacting and answering the 
question yourself.

 You can expect to find the following types of questions on the exam. (The example 
questions depicted in  Figures  22-1 through  22-7 serve only to demonstrate the exam 
question formats; they have nothing to do with the actual CCNA Wireless exam 
content.) 
  ■ 
 Multiple choice, single answer    —The question has several possible answers, but
only one correct one.  Figure  22-1 shows an example. 
  ■ 
 Multiple choice, multiple answer    —The question has several possible answers, with
a given number of correct ones.  Figure  22-2  shows an example.
  ■ 
 Drag and drop    —The question has a series of items that you must drag and drop
into boxes that represent the correct category, correct sequence, and so on.  Figure
 22-3 shows an example. 
  ■ 
 Fill in the blank    —The question has one or more blank answers that you must fill in.
 Figure  22-4 shows an example. 
  ■ 
 Simulation    —The question includes a description and a network diagram. You can
click a network device and interact with it through a simulated command-line inter-
face (CLI) session.  Figure  22-5 shows an example. 
  ■ 
 Testlet    —The question includes a detailed scenario and a set of questions that you
must select and answer.  Figure  22-6 shows an example. 
  ■ 
 Simlet    —The question includes a scenario and a set of questions that you must
answer based on your interaction with a simulated network device.  Figure  22-7
shows an example.

 You should find the multiple-choice questions fairly straightforward because they have 
only one correct answer. Read through the possible answers carefully so that you can 
eliminate the obviously incorrect ones. You might find that some answers appear to be 
similar or are not easy to dismiss. Look for subtle differences and any key words that 
relate to concepts you have learned.  
 Multiple-choice questions that require multiple answers sometimes prove more difficult. 
Fortunately, the questions always state the number of correct answers you should enter. 
Pay close attention to that number, and then use the answer check boxes to select and 
narrow down your final answers.  

452  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 Drag-and-drop questions present you with a list of objects that you must drag and drop 
into the correct locations in a blank list. Sometimes you will need to sort the objects into 
two different lists. Sometimes you will need to select only the objects that match a cate-
gory and then place them in sequential order. Pay close attention to the stated goals and 
the order that you should put the answers in. If you need to change any of your answers, 
just drag them back to their starting positions and try again. 
 The simulation and simlet question formats usually involve network devices such as rout-
ers, switches, and firewalls that have a CLI to interact with. Most likely, you will not find 
such questions on the CCNA Wireless exam. Even though Cisco Wireless LAN control-
lers and access points (APs) have a CLI that you can access, you are not really expected 
to until you move to more advanced certifications.  
 Testlet questions include a short set of questions to answer. The questions are listed on 
the right side of the exam, usually numbered in sequence. Read through the scenario 
description, and then select one of multiple-choice questions to answer. Do not forget 
to move through the other multiple-choice questions and answer them all before moving 
on to the next exam question. 
 You might encounter a testlet question that simulates the Cisco Wireless LAN 
Controller (WLC) graphical user interface (GUI). Know how to navigate the controller to 
find important information like the IP address of an interface, which interface is bound 
to a WLAN, client information based on a MAC address, and so on. 
 Think About Your Time Budget 
 On exam day, keep an eye on your progress as you move through the questions. Budget 
your time so that you have enough to make your way through all the exam questions. 
You might find yourself struggling between two feelings: 
  ■ 
 I’m going too slowly!    —If your pace is too slow, you might not have enough time to
answer all the questions. You might also find that you are spending what seems like
an eternity on one pesky question when you should be moving on to others. 
  ■ 
 I’m going too fast!    —If your pace is too fast, you will get through all the questions,
but you might be rushing without being thorough. Remember that you need to read
both the questions and the answers completely so that you fully understand them. 
 During the exam, you need to be able to somehow know whether you are moving quick-
ly enough to answer all the questions, while not rushing. The exam user interface shows 
some useful information—a countdown timer and a question counter. The question 
counter shows the question number you are currently answering and the total number of 
questions on your exam. 
 Unfortunately, treating each question equally does not give you an accurate time esti-
mate. For example, if your exam allows 90 minutes and your exam has 45 questions, you 
have an average of 2 minutes per question. Suppose that 40 minutes have elapsed and 
you have answered 20 questions. At 2 minutes per question, it seems like you would be 
right on schedule. However, several factors make that kind of estimate difficult to run 
before the exam.  

Chapter 22: Final Review  453
 First, Cisco does not tell us beforehand the exact number of questions for each exam. 
For example, Cisco.com lists the CCNA Wireless 640-722 exam as having from 75 to 
85 questions in 90 minutes. You will not know exactly how many questions are on your 
exam until you go through the initial screens that lead up to the point where you click 
 Start Exam  and the exam actually begins. As a worst case, 85 questions in 90 minutes 
works out to an average of slightly over a minute per question. 
 Next, some questions clearly take a lot more time to answer than others. These are com-
monly called “time-burner” questions. Consider the following comparison:  
  ■ 
 Normal-time questions —Multiple-choice and drag-and-drop questions, approxi-
mately 1 minute each
  ■ 
 Time burners    —Sim, simlet, and testlet questions, approximately 6 to 8 minutes
each 
 Cisco does not tell us why you might get 85 questions and someone else taking the same 
exam might get 75 questions. It seems reasonable to think that the person with 75 ques-
tions might have a few more of the time burners, making the two exams even out. 
 Even though testlet and simlet questions contain several individual multiple-choice ques-
tions (each graded and scored independently), the exam software counts each testlet and 
simlet question as one question in the question counter. For example, if a testlet ques-
tion has four embedded multiple-choice questions, the exam software’s question counter 
will show it counting as one exam question.  
 During the exam, as you encounter each question, resist the temptation to skim through 
it. Try to deliberately read it from start to finish so that you do not skip over any impor-
tant words or information. For example, a question might ask “which one is not; if you 
skip over the word  not , you will likely get the answers wrong. 
 Scenario descriptions can be lengthy, especially when they set the stage for a complex 
problem. Be aware that the text will be located in a scrolling window that might be hard 
to read or navigate because of the cramped screen real estate. Network diagrams can be 
equally cumbersome because they have to show many icons, links, addresses, and other 
information in a small space.   
 Other Pre-Exam Suggestions 
 Here are just a few more suggestions for things to think about before exam day arrives. 
First, consider the following strategies for reviewing the exam content:  
  ■ 
  Go back through the “Do I Know This Already?” quizzes at the beginning of each
chapter. 
  ■ 
  Open this book to the table of contents page. Read down through the entries until
you find a topic that seems foreign or does not come to mind right away. Spend
time reviewing the corresponding chapter or section to refresh your memory. 
  ■ 
  Use the practice questions on the accompanying CD. You might not find every type
of exam question there, but you should get a thorough sample of the exam content.

454  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
If you get a practice question in the multiple-choice, single-answer format, think 
about what might happen if you see that same question on the real exam in another 
format.  
  ■ 
  Keep a running list of topics, acronyms, or concepts that you feel you do not under-
stand completely or are taking too much time remembering. Go back and review the
things on your list.
  ■ 
 Join in the discussions on the Cisco Learning Network. Try to answer questions
asked by other learners. The process of answering, even if you keep your answer to
yourself, makes you think much harder about the topic. When someone posts an
answer with which you disagree, think about why and talk about it online. This is a
great way to both learn more and build confidence.
 Next, think about the things you might need to do right before your exam time: 
  ■ 
 Get some earplugs. Testing centers often have some, but if you do not want to
chance it, come prepared. The testing center is usually a room inside the space of a
company that does something else as well. There could be people talking in nearby
rooms, in addition to other office noises. Earplugs can help. Headphones and elec-
tronic devices are not permitted.
  ■ 
 The testing center usually provides a white-erase card and a marker, but does not
allow you to bring in any notes. Some people like to spend the first minute of the
exam writing down some notes on the white-erase card for reference. For example,
you might want to write out a table of mW-to-dBm value conversions. If you plan
to do that, practice making those notes ahead of time. Before each practice exam,
transcribe those lists, just like you expect to do at the real exam.
  ■ 
 Plan your travel to the testing center with enough time so that you will not be rush-
ing to make it there by your scheduled exam time. 
  ■ 
 If you tend to be nervous before exams, practice your favorite relaxation tech-
niques for a few minutes before each practice exam, just to be ready to use them.
  ■ 
 Rest the night before the exam, rather than staying up late to study. Clarity of
thought is more important than learning one extra fact, especially because the exam
requires so much analysis and thinking. 
  ■ 
 You can bring personal effects into the building and testing company’s space, but
not into the actual room in which you take the exam. So, take as little extra stuff
with you as possible. If you have a safe place to leave briefcases, purses, electron-
ics, and so on, leave them there. However, the testing center should have a place to
store your things as well. Simply put, the less you bring, the less you have to worry
about storing. 
  ■ 
 Find a restroom before going into the testing center. If you cannot find one, of
course you can use one in the testing center. The testing personnel will direct you
and give you time before your exam starts. 
  ■ 
 Do not drink a large quantity of liquid before your exam begins. Once the exam has
started, the timer will not stop while you go to the restroom. 

Chapter 22: Final Review  455
 Final Thoughts 
 Congratulations for working your way this far through this book. Nothing about Cisco 
certification exams is easy, but they are well worth your time and hard work. At the end 
of the exam, you will receive your final score and news of your passing or failing. If you 
pass, congratulate yourself and breathe a sigh of relief at not having to study more. 
 If you fail, remind yourself that you are not a failure. It is never a disgraceful thing to 
fail a Cisco exam, as long as you decide to try it again. Anybody who has ever taken a 
Cisco exam knows that to be true; just ask the people who have attempted the CCIE 
lab exam. As soon as you can after learning that you failed, take a few minutes to write 
down as many exam questions as you can remember. Note which questions left you 
uneasy. Next, schedule to take the same exam again. Allow a few days so that you can 
study the topics that gave you trouble. The exam score should also break down the 
entire exam into major topics, each with its respective score. Do not be discouraged 
about starting over with your studies; the majority of it is already behind you. Just spend 
time brushing up on the “low spots” where you lack knowledge or confidence. Go for it 
and do your best! 


 Chapter 1 
 1.  C. The IEEE 802.11 standard focuses on wireless LAN definitions, methods, and
operation. It is made up of many pieces, as described in  Chapter  2 , “RF Standards.”
Sometimes you might see IEEE 802.11x, which refers to the many subparts of
802.11. Be aware of the subtle difference between that and 802.1x, which defines
port-based network access control. 
 2.  B, E. Wireless LANs use the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. Be careful to notice the
difference between megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz). Also remember that 5.5
Mbps and 11 Mbps are some of the common data rates used in wireless LANs, but
those are not involved when you need to identify the frequency band. 
 3.   A. When the two power levels are the same, the result is 0 dB. As long as you
remember the first handy 0 dB fact, you will find exam questions like this easy. If
not, you will need to remember that dB = 10log 10 (100 mW / 100 mW) = 10log 10 (1)
= 0 dB.
 4.   C. At first glance, 17 mW and 34 mW might seem like odd numbers to work with.
Notice that if you double 17, you get 34. The second handy dB fact says that dou-
bling a power level will increase the dB value by 3.
 5.   D. Start with transmitter A’s level of 1 mW and try to figure out some simple opera-
tions that can be used to get to transmitter B’s level of 100 mW. Remember the
handy dB facts, which use multiplication by 2 and 10. In this case, 1 mW × 10 = 10
mW × 10 = 100 mW. Each multiplication by 10 adds 10 dB, so the end result is 10
+ 10 = 20 dB. Notice that transmitter B is being compared to A (the reference level),
which is 1 mW. You could also state the end result in dB-milliwatt  (dBm).
 6.   C. This question involves a  reduction  in the power level, so the dB value must be
negative. Try to find a simple way to start with 100 and get to 40 by multiplying or
dividing by 2 or 10. In this case, 100 / 10 = 10; 10 × 2 = 20; 20 × 2 = 40. Dividing by
10 reduced the dB value by 10 dB; then multiplying by 2 increased the total by +3
dB; multiplying again by 2 increased the total by +3 more dB. In other words, dB =
–10 + 3 + 3 = –4 dB.
 7.  B. Remember that the EIRP involves radiated power, and that is calculated using
only the transmitter components. The EIRP is the sum of the transmitter power level
(+20 dBm), the cable loss (–2 dB), and the antenna gain (+5 dBi). Therefore, the EIRP
is +23 dBm.

Already?” Quizzes

 8.  D. A high SNR is best, where the received signal strength is more elevated above the
noise floor. A 30-dBm SNR separates the signal from the noise more than a 10-dBm
SNR does. Likewise, a higher RSSI value means that the signal strength alone is
higher. The RSSI scale ranges from 0 (highest) to –100 (lowest).
 9.   C. DSSS supports 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps data rates through different combina-
tions of coding and modulation schemes. FHSS is locked to 1 or 2 Mbps. With the
exception of 6 and 9 Mbps, only OFDM supports the highest data rates of all the
modulation types. 
 10.  C, B, A, D.  The correct order is C, B, A, D or DBPSK (2 possible phase changes),
DQPSK (4 possible phase changes), 16-QAM (16 possible phase/amplitude changes),
64-QAM (64 possible phase/amplitude changes). 
 11.   B, C. Both 16-QAM and 64-QAM alter the amplitude and phase of a signal.
 12.  C. OFDM uses 48 subcarriers in a single 20-MHz-wide channel, allowing it to trans-
mit data bits in parallel. DSSS uses a single 22-MHz channel with only one main car-
rier signal. 
 Chapter 2 
 1.  C. The ITU-R allocated the ISM bands for global use.
 2.   B. The U-NII-1 band is the first of four 5-GHz bands set aside for wireless LAN use.
 3.   D. The EIRP is always limited to +36 dBm in the 2.4-GHz band, except in the case
of point-to-point links. 
 4.  D. 
 5.   C. Only channels 1, 6, and 11 are nonoverlapping. The 2.4-GHz channels are spaced
5 MHz apart, whereas the DSSS channel width is 22 MHz.
 6.  D. The first U-NII-1 channel is labeled channel 36.
 7.  C, D, F. IEEE 802.11g and 802.11b deal with the 2.4-GHz band. IEEE 802.11a is
strictly for 5 GHz, and 802.11n includes both 2.4 and 5 GHz. The IEEE 802.11-2012
standard has all of these amendments rolled up into one document. 
 8.   C, D. Both 802.11g and 802.11a define OFDM use, even though the two standards
use different bands. 
 9.  A. 
 10.   B. The device has two transmitters and three receivers. The number of spatial
streams supported would be added after the 2×3 designation. 
 11.   C. 802.11n is limited to aggregating two 20 MHz channels for a total width of 40
MHz. 
 12.   A. Devices using 802.11n can use multiple radio chains and multiple spatial streams..
 13.  D. Only the Wi-Fi Alliance tests and certifies wireless products according to indus-
try standards. 

Appendix A: Answers to “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  459
 Chapter 3 
 1.   C. Because both transmitters are using the same channel, the interference is
described as co-channel. 
 2.   E. Cisco recommends a separation of  at least 19 dBm, so +20 dBm is the only cor-
rect answer. 
 3.   B. The two channels being used are adjacent, so their signals overlap by some
degree. The resulting interference is called adjacent channel interference. 
 4.   D. In the 2.4-GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ones that are spaced far
enough apart (five channel numbers) that they do not overlap.
 5.  A. Energy traveling in an electromagnetic wave spreads in three dimensions, weak-
ening the signal strength over a distance.
 6.   B. The 802.11b and g devices operate at 2.4 GHz, which is less affected by free
space loss than the 802.11a device, at 5 GHz.
 7.   D. By switching to a less-complex modulation scheme, more of the data stream can
be repeated to overcome worsening RF conditions. This can be done automatically
through DRS. 
 8.   B. As a signal is reflected, a new copy travels in a different direction. Each copy of
the signal takes a different path to reach the receiver; thus, the name  multipath . 
 9.   D. As a signal passes through a wall, the building material absorbs some of the RF
energy, reducing the signal strength by some amount.
 10.   B. The first Fresnel zone is an elliptical area along the length of a signal path that
should be kept free of obstructions. When an object extends into a significant por-
tion of the Fresnel zone, the signal can be diffracted and distorted. 
 Chapter 4 
 1.   B, D. The - and H plane plots are used to show a side view and a top-down view,
respectively, with the antenna in the center of the plots.
 2.  B. The H plane is also known as the azimuth plane because measurements are taken
at every azimuth angle around the base of the antenna. 
 3.   D. The beamwidth is the angle measured between the two points on a radiation pat-
tern plot that are 3 dB below the maximum.
 4.   D. A wave’s orientation with respect to the horizon is known as the polarization.
 5.  B. Cisco antennas are designed to use vertical polarization. Because the dipole
antenna is mounted correctly (pointing straight up or down), the wave will be verti-
cally polarized. 
 6.  B. A parabolic dish antenna has the greatest gain because it focuses the RF energy
into a tight beam.

460  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 7.  A, E. An omnidirectional antenna is usually used to cover a large area. Therefore, it
has a large beamwidth. Because it covers a large area, its gain is usually small.
 8.   C. Integrated antennas are omnidirectional.
 9.   B. Orienting a dipole so that its cylinder points toward a receiver will probably
cause the received signal to become weaker. That is because the donut shaped radia-
tion pattern to rotate away from the receiver. The radiation pattern is weakest along
the length of the antenna. 
 10.   C. Lightning arrestors cannot protect against direct lightning strikes on an antenna.
 Chapter 5 
 1.  A, B. WPANs and WLANs can both use the unlicensed 2.4-GHz ISM band.
 2.  B. WLANs require half-duplex operation because all stations must contend for use
of a channel to transmit frames.
 3.   C. An AP offers a basic service set (BSS).
 4.   B. The AP at the heart of a BSS or cell identifies itself (and the BSS) with a basic ser-
vice set identifier (BSSID). It also uses an SSID to identify the wireless network, but
that is not unique to the AP or BSS. Finally, the radio MAC address is used as the
basis for the BSSID value, but the value can be altered to form the BSSID for each
SSID that the AP supports. 
 5.   D. In a BSS, the 802.11 standard requires all traffic to pass through an AP. The only
exception is the 802.11z amendment, which permits an AP to coordinate direct
client-to-client traffic without passing through the AP.
 6.  A, D. 
 True: “The DS connects two BSSs to form an ESS”—The distribution system connects 
two basic service sets (APs) to form an extended service set.  
 False: “The BSA of a BSS looks like a MAC address”—The basic service area of a BSS is 
its coverage area or cell, which has nothing to do with a MAC address. 
 False: “The SSID of a STA must be unique within the ESS”—The service set identifier 
can be common across one or many BSSs in an ESS.  
 True: “The BSSID is unique for each SSID in a BSS”—An AP in a BSS uses its radio MAC 
address as the basis for its BSSIDs, but each SSID has a unique BSSID value. 
 7.  E. Roaming implies that the building has some wireless APs that are interconnected.
Therefore, the client must first associate with a BSS. The BSS must connect to a
switched infrastructure through a DS. The DS must extend to at least one more AP
through an ESS. Finally, the same SSID has to be defined on every AP in the ESS.
 8.   D. An independent basic service set is also called an ad hoc network.
 9.  B. A workgroup bridge acts as a wireless client, but bridges traffic to and from a
wired device connected to it.

Appendix A: Answers to “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  461
 10.   B. In a mesh network, each mesh AP builds a standalone BSS. The APs relay client
traffic to each other over wireless backhaul links, rather than wired Ethernet. A
wireless LAN controller is necessary. 
 Chapter 6 
 1.   D. An 802.11 frame contains four different address fields.
 2.  B. Frames are marked as going to the DS or from the DS.
 3.  D. The Address1 field always contains the RA.
 4.  A. 802.11 devices can participate in the distributed coordination function (DCF).
 5.  C. A wireless client uses the network allocation vector (NAV) to predict the
number of timeslots required for the channel to become free so that a frame can be
transmitted. 
 6.   D. Frames are separated by the distributed interframe space (DIFS).
 7.   B. A probe request frame is sent to ask any listening APs to identify themselves.
 8.   B. A wireless device must send an ACK frame, one of the 802.11 control frames,
back to the source of each unicast frame that is received. 
 9.   A, B. A client can join a BSS as long as it has at least one mandatory rate in common
with the AP but it must be able to support all of the AP’s mandatory rates.
 10.  A. In a passive scan, a client simply listens to any beacons that are transmitted by
nearby APs. In contrast, probes are sent by the client to discover APs in an active
scan. 
 11.   D. A client must first be authenticated to the BSS, then it can request to be associ-
ated. 
 12.   C. As long as the client can move from one BSS to another without losing a signal or
getting disassociated or deauthenticated, it can probe for a new AP and send a reas-
sociation frame to reassociate itself with the existing SSID. 
 Chapter 7 
 1.   B, C, D. The transmit power directly affects the range of the AP’s signal. The sup-
ported modulation and coding schemes can affect the range because the simpler
schemes can tolerate a lower SNR and a weaker signal, implying a greater range.
The more complex schemes offer better data rates, but need a better signal quality
within a shorter range. The supported data rates also affect the range because they
directly affect the modulation and coding schemes that are used. 
 2.   B. If you have already tested the AP’s signal and determined that it reaches every
location in the lobby area, the problem is not that the AP’s transmit power is insuf-
ficient. Instead, the problem is occurring because the small client devices must be
using a transmit power that is lower than that of the AP. In other words, the client

462  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
signals are not strong enough to reach the AP, so the two have asymmetric power 
levels. The solution is to increase the client’s transmit power level to be identical to 
the AP’s. 
 3.  D. The 1-Mbps data rate is already disabled, which limits the cell size to some
extent. You can reduce it further by disabling the 2-Mbps data rate. 
 4.   C. If the problem is occurring some distance away from the replacement AP, the
replacement AP must be working correctly within its immediate area. If the replace-
ment had a 1-dBm transmit power, it could not be causing any interference at a
great distance away. The problem is likely because the lowest data rates have been
enabled. The lower rates effective extend the replacement AP’s cell size into the
cells of other APs farther away. If the channels are identical, the replacement could
be causing co-channel interference in other cells, degrading client performance and
roaming. 
 5.   C. Roaming is entirely up to the client. The client runs a roaming algorithm that
compares current conditions to a threshold. When the signal quality or other factors
drop below the threshold, the client tries to roam. 
 6.   D. Whereas an association request is used to join a BSS, a reassociation request is
used to move from one BSS to another within the same ESS.
 7.  B. Roaming algorithms are not standardized at all. Instead, each manufacturer might
have its own interpretation of an algorithm. Wireless clients can scan a set of avail-
able channels when they anticipate roaming, to look for a new AP. Cisco APs and
controllers can also prime a Cisco compatible client (CCX Versions 3 and later) with
a list of viable APs ahead of time, so that the client can save time without having to
scan channels. 
 8.   B. To promote clean roaming, neighboring APs should use different, nonoverlap-
ping channels. In addition, APs should be located such that their coverage overlaps
each other by some amount, usually 15 percent to 20 percent.
 9.   C. Adjacent APs should always use different, nonoverlapping channels.
 10.   A, C. The fourth-floor APs will not interfere with the main office AP on channel
6. However, the other third-floor APs and the second-floor AP all use channel 6.
Those signals could penetrate the floor and interfere with the main office AP, caus-
ing roaming issues. 
 Chapter 8 
 1.  C. A trunk link is needed to carry multiple SSIDs to multiple VLANs.
 2.  C. An autonomous AP is a standalone AP; it offers a BSS and connects to a DS, all
without the need for a centralized controller.
 3.   A. A console port is available for configuration and management.
 4.   D. The wired Ethernet port MAC address is always listed on the sticker. To find the
radio MAC address, you would have to connect to the AP’s console, use Telnet or

Appendix A: Answers to “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  463
SSH to connect to it, or access it through its web interface. Be aware that both 2.4- 
and 5-GHz radios use one common base MAC address.   
 5.   A, B. An autonomous AP tries to use DHCP by default, but you can configure a
static address if necessary. 
 6.   A, B, C, D. You can use all of the given methods to obtain the AP’s IP address.
 7.   B, C. The radios are disabled and no SSIDs are configured. This prevents the AP
from becoming active until you have properly configured it.
 8.   A. When you configure an SSID, you can decide which radio should support it.
 9.   C. The upgrade tool downloads a lightweight code image, which you must obtain
from Cisco. A TFTP server is necessary, but you can use the one that is integrated
into the upgrade tool. 
 10.   C. You should use the  archive download-sw  command, which also specifies the
TFTP server address and filename. 
 Chapter 9 
 1.   A. An autonomous AP can operate independently, without the need for a central-
ized wireless LAN controller. 
 2.   A. Client-to-client traffic usually passes through an autonomous AP, although cli-
ents can use DLS to communicate directly after coordinating with the AP.
 3.   B. An LAP transports client traffic through a tunnel back to a wireless LAN con-
troller. Therefore, client-to-client traffic usually passes through both the AP, the
controller, and back through the AP. If DLS is used, two wireless clients can com-
municate directly without passing through the AP and controller, but only after the
communication has been coordinated with the AP.
 4.   C. On a lightweight AP, the MAC function is divided between the AP hardware and
the WLC. Therefore, the architecture is known as split-MAC. 
 5.   B. An LAP builds a CAPWAP tunnel with a WLC.
 6.  A. Only the CAPWAP control tunnel is secured by default. Client data passes over
the CAPWAP data tunnel, but is optionally encrypted. DHCP requests are client
data and are not encrypted by default. Finally, 802.11 beacons are sent over the air
from an LAP, so they are not encrypted or transported by CAPWAP. 
 7.   A. A trunk link carrying three VLANs is not needed at all. A lightweight AP in
local mode needs only an access link with a single VLAN; everything else is carried
over the CAPWAP tunnel to a WLC. The WLC will need to be connected to three
VLANs so that it can work with the LAP to bind them to the three SSIDs. 
 8.   D. Because the network is built with a WLC and LAPs, CAPWAP tunnels are
required. One CAPWAP tunnel connects each LAP to the WLC, for a total of 32
tunnels. CAPWAP encapsulates wireless traffic inside an additional IP header, so
the tunnel packets are routable across a Layer 3 network. That means the LAPs and

464  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
WLC can reside on any IP subnet as long as the subnets are reachable. There are no 
restrictions for the LAPs and WLC to live on the same Layer 2 VLAN or Layer 3 IP 
subnet. 
 9.  A, B. You can have multiple WLCs in a CUWN, so you could add a second 5508 or
replace the existing one with a more robust model. You should not try to expand
the coverage of each AP, rather than expand the capacity of the WLC.
 10.  D. The 3602 offers future-proof capability to add an 802.11ac module. The 3702
AP has 802.11ac Wave 1 capability integrated; an optional 802.11ac Wave 2 mod-
ule will become available in the future. 
 Chapter 10 
 1.  B. Controller ports are physical connections to the switched network infrastructure.
 2.  C. The service port is used for out-of-band management.
 3.  A. The distribution system ports are usually configured as unconditional 802.1Q
trunks. 
 4.   C. Controllers use a link aggregation group (LAG) to bundle the ports together.
 5.   D. CAPWAP tunnels always terminate on the AP-manager interface. All the APs dis-
cover the controller by that interface and its IP address. 
 6.   A. The management interface can terminate CAPWAP tunnels if no AP-manager
interface exists. 
 7.  D. A dynamic interface makes a logical connection between a WLAN and a VLAN,
all internal to the controller.
 8.   A. The controller will begin its initial setup to build a bootstrap configuration.
 9.  A. You can connect to either the controller console port or use a web browser to
run through the initial setup procedure. The console will use CLI only, while the ser-
vice port is used for a web interface.
 10.   D. You should connect to the service-port interface’s IP address. You cannot use
a web browser with the console port. Neither the virtual interface nor a dynamic
interface can be used because it will not be configured until you complete the initial
setup wizard. 
 Chapter 11 
 1.  B. An AP will discover all possible WLCs before attempting to build a CAPWAP
tunnel or join a controller.
 2.  C. After an AP boots, it compares its own software image to that of the controller it
has joined. If the images differ, the AP downloads a new image from the controller.
 3.   F. An AP can learn controller addresses from all of the listed methods.

Appendix A: Answers to “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  465
 4.   C. An AP will try the three primed addresses (primary, secondary, and tertiary) first
before any other method. 
 5.   C. If an AP cannot find a viable controller, it reboots and tries the discovery process
all over again. 
 6.   B. The AP priority determines which APs can join a controller when the controller
fills with APs. Higher-priority APs will be allowed to join and displace lower-priori-
ty APs. 
 7.  D. If the primary controller responds to an AP’s discovery methods, the AP will
always try to join it first, ahead of any other controller. Configuring an AP with a
primary controller is the most specific method because it points the AP to a pre-
determined controller. Other methods are possible, but they can yield ambiguous
results that could send an AP to one of several possible controllers. 
 8.   D. APs use CAPWAP keepalive messages that are sent to the controller every 30
seconds. 
 9.   D. The AP Fallback feature allows APs to fall back or revert to a primary controller
at any time. 
 10.   C. N+N redundancy is being used because there are two active controllers and no
standby or backup controllers. 
 Chapter 12 
 1.   B. The client must associate with a BSS offered by an AP.
 2.  A. The client device is in complete control over the roaming decision, based on its
own roaming algorithm. It uses active scanning and probing to discover other candi-
date APs that it might roam to.
 3.   C. Because a single controller is involved, the roam occurs in an intracontroller fash-
ion. Even though the client thinks it is associating with APs, the associations actually
occur at the controller, thanks to the split-MAC architecture. 
 4.  C. Intracontroller roaming is the most efficient because the reassociation and client
authentication occur within a single controller.
 5.  C. Cisco Centralized Key Management (CCKM) is used to cache key information
between a client and an AP. The cached information is then used as a quick check
when a client roams to a different AP.
 6.   C. Intercontroller roaming supports Layer 3 roaming when a client moves from one
controller to another and when the client’s IP subnet changes between controllers. 
 7.   D. In a Layer 2 roam, the client’s IP subnet does not change as it moves between
controllers. Therefore, there is no need to tunnel the client data between the con-
trollers; instead, the client simply gets handed off to the new controller. 

466  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 8.  B. A client can always choose to renew or obtain an IP address, but it does not have
to. The client can continue to use its same IP address during either Layer 2 or Layer
3 roams. 
 9.  D. The anchor controller, where the client starts, maintains the client’s state and
builds a tunnel to the foreign controller, where the client has now roamed.
 10.  C. Controllers A and B are listed in each other’s mobility list, so they are known
to each other. However, they are configured with different mobility group names.
Clients may roam between the two controllers, but CCKM and PKC information
will not be exchanged. 
 Chapter 13 
 1.  C. A data rate marked as mandatory by an AP must be supported by any client that
intends to associate with the AP. 
 2.   B. You can configure one or more data rates as mandatory. In fact, the 1-, 2-, 5.5-,
and 11-Mbps data rates in the 2.4-GHz band are set as mandatory by default. 
 3.   B. Broadcast management frames are sent at the lowest mandatory data rate. Unicast
management frames can be sent at any optimal supported or mandatory data rate.
 4.   B. 802.11n support is enabled by default. Only 20-MHz channels will be used until
40 MHz channels are enabled. 
 5.   C. RRM monitors and adjusts all APs in a single RF group. The RF group may con-
tain one or more controllers. 
 6.   C. By default, all APs joined to a controller belong to one common RF group. The
group can be extended to any other controller that has APs within range by con-
figuring that controller with the same RF group name. To build an RF group, APs
send neighbor messages so that they can be discovered. If one controller’s APs hear
neighbor messages sent from another controller’s APs, and the RF group names
match, the RF group is extended to include both controllers. 
 7.   D. The transmit power control (TPC) algorithm adjusts the power level used by each
AP in an RF group.
 8.   C. The goal of DCA is to maintain an efficient channel layout and avoid interference
and noise. Therefore, DCA might choose to move the AP to a different channel.
 9.   A. TPC and DCA are RRM algorithms that run on a per-RF group basis. Therefore,
the RF group leader runs the algorithms. 
 10.   D. A failed radio will probably cause a hole or weakness in the RF coverage around
the AP. Coverage hole detection can detect the failure based on the weak signal cli-
ents in that area are experiencing. The algorithm can also boost the transmit power
level in neighboring APs to help heal the coverage hole.

 1.   E. A secure wireless connection between a client and an AP should have all of the
listed security components. 
 2.   C. The message integrity check (MIC) is used to protect data against tampering.
 3.  D. Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a wireless encryption method that has been
found to be vulnerable and is not recommended for use. 
 4.   A. Open authentication is used so that the client can associate with the AP and can
then authenticate through 802.1x and EAP.
 5.   C. A controller becomes an authenticator in the 802.1x process.
 6.  B. PEAP uses a server certificate, but clients authenticate using more traditional
means without a certificate.
 7.  D. EAP-TLS requires digital certificates on both the AS and the supplicants.
 8.   C. CCMP is currently the most secure data encryption and integrity method for
wireless data. 
 9.   B. WPA2 requires CCMP, whereas WPA does not.
 10.   A, C. Pre-shared keys can be used in WPA personal and WPA2 personal modes.
Enterprise mode requires 802.1x authentication. 
 11.   B, D. MFP requires a secure connection between an AP and a CCXv5 client.
Therefore, WPA2 and CCXv5 are needed. 
 12.   B. WPA2 personal requires a pre-shared key (PSK). The same key must be config-
ured on the WLAN, which gets propagated to all APs that are joined to the control-
ler, in addition to every client that might associate with the WLAN.
 Chapter 15 
 1.   C, D. A WLAN binds an SSID to a controller interface, so that the controller can
link the wired and wireless networks. Although the WLAN ultimately reaches a
wired VLAN, it does so only through a controller interface. It is the interface that is
configured with a VLAN number.
 2.   C. You can configure a maximum of 512 WLANs on a controller. However, a maxi-
mum of only 16 of them can be configured on an AP.
 3.  B. Each AP supports a maximum of 16 WLANs. Even so, you should always try to
limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer. 
 4.   B. The BSS for each WLAN must be advertised, requiring airtime for beacons. A
growing number of WLANs results in a growing number of beacons needed, which
results in a diminishing amount of airtime left available for data frames.

468  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 5.  A, C. The SSID and controller interface are the only parameters from the list that
are necessary. The VLAN number is not because it is supplied when a controller
interface is configured. 
 6.   B. The WLAN ID is used internally as an index into the list of WLANs on a control-
ler. Therefore, it is not made visible to any clients. 
 Chapter 16 
 1.  B. A guest WLAN is normally used to provide limited network access to guest cli-
ents, while keeping them isolated from the rest of the network. 
 2.   B. By itself, the controller cannot route packets between WLANs; any connectivity
must be provided by an external router or firewall.
 3.   D. A guest WLAN is no different from a data or regular WLAN. The only differ-
ences are the type of user authentication and the external means to keep the guest
VLAN isolated from the other networks. 
 4.   B. A guest WLAN on one controller is completely separate from the guest WLAN
defined on another controller. The guest WLANs can be bound to a common
VLAN so that they share a common IP subnet, but the WLANs are not merged or
joined by default. 
 5.   C. Guest WLANs can be merged toward a common controller if each of the con-
trollers identifies the same controller as a mobility anchor.
 6.  B. You can configure more than one mobility anchor for a guest WLAN. Guest cli-
ents will be load balanced across the anchor controllers. 
 Chapter 17 
 1.  B. Wireless connections can be managed by either Windows or Intel PROSet, but
not both. 
 2.   A. The VPN module must be installed.
 3.   D. You can use a Cisco ASA and its ASDM software to push policies to
AnyConnect clients. 
 4.  B. CCX certifies compatibility with a set of Cisco innovations and features.
 5.   C. CCX has five versions.
 6.   B. Even though the device has no CCX certification at all, it will most likely work
fine on the network. CCX measures compatibility with Cisco features, not with the
802.11 standard. 
 7.  D. CCXv1 is the oldest version and has few compatible features. One of the fea-
tures is the initial 802.11 standard. 
 8.   C. WPA2 with 802.1x was introduced in CCXv3 and so is supported in it and later
versions.

 7.  D. CleanAir adds spectrum analysis capabilities to a Cisco lightweight AP.
 8.  A. CleanAir analyzes non-802.11 signals to detect and classify devices that interfere
with 802.11 AP cells. 
 9.   B. By default, Cisco CleanAir is disabled on a controller.
 10.  D. Because CleanAir has assigned a severity value of 4, the interference is likely not
severe. The severity scale runs from 0 (not severe) to 100 (very severe).

470  CCNA Wireless 640-722 Official Cert Guide
 11.  B. A unique cluster ID is assigned to each uniquely identified interferer. The cluster
ID is also known as a pseudo-MAC address. Non-802.11 devices do not use regular
MAC addresses, so a virtual MAC address is created and used as a label.
 Chapter 20 
 1.  C. By entering the client’s MAC address, the controller can display information
about it straightaway. The other answers might also lead to useful information, but
only after you spend more time sifting through the data. 
 2.  A, C, D, E. 
 3.  D. From the controller’s perspective, a client must go through a sequence of state
changes before it can be fully associated and joined to the network. Only when a
client is in the RUN state is it fully operational. 
 4.   C. Removing a client causes the controller to deauthenticate it so that it is removed
from the network temporarily. The client is free to probe, associate, and return to
the network again. 
 5.  B. The client must have failed to authenticate with the 802.1x method that is con-
figured on the WLAN. Perhaps a RADIUS server is down, the client is sending an
incorrect username or password, or the client’s digital certificate is invalid. 
 6.   B. Because the client supports only CCXv1, the controller uses ping tests with ICMP
packets. The controller can record RSSI measurements of the client’s signal, but the
lack of robust CCX support prevents the client from relaying its own RSSI measure-
ments of the AP’s signal.
 7.  C, D. The client must support CCXv4 or CCXv5 before it can accept the CCX link
test frames and return information about its own radio to the controller. 
 8.  D. 
 9.   C. You should leverage WCS and its central location in the wireless network.
Assuming that every controller is configured to send SNMP traps to WCS, you
should be able to find useful information about the client with just a single search
through the WCS database. 
 10.   D. Answer A is incorrect because the access VLAN number is left to the default
(VLAN 1). Answer B is incorrect, even though a lightweight AP can use a trunk link,
as long as the trunk is configured with the AP’s VLAN number as the 802.1Q native
VLAN. The configuration allows VLAN 11 over the trunk, but will use the default
native VLAN 1 because it does not define a specific native VLAN number. Answer
C is incorrect because the switch interface is left in the shutdown state. Answer D is
correct because it provides VLAN 11 to the AP  over an access mode link.
