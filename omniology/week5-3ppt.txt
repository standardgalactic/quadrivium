Respiratory System 
pleural sac: 
inner layer covers lungs 
outer layer is attached 
        to chest wall 
fluid in between

Pressure & Lung Volumes 
Patm = 0 mm Hg = 760 mm Hg 
Lungs 
Intrapleural fluid 
Chest wall 
PA 
Pip 

Pressure & Lung Volumes 
PA – Pip determines lung size  and PA - Patm determines air flow 
PA 
Pip = -3 

F = (PA- Patm) /R 
P1V1=P2V2 – Boyles Law 
Pressure & Lung Volumes 
end of expiration 
during inspiration 
end of 
inspiration 
during expiration 
Pip = -3 
Pip = -5 
Pip = -6 
Pip = -4 
PA=0 
PA= -1 
PA= +1 
PA=0 
PA – Pip determines lung size  and  
PA - Patm determines air flow 


Resistance & Air Flow 
F = (PA- Patm) /R 
Factors that influence resistance: 
 
1. Airway diameter – the smaller the diameter the more resistance in 
that tube 
 
in lung, more tubes as you go further into lung - so combined 
resistance gets lower as enter lung 
 
2. Lung volume – if have a greater lung volume then airways are not 
as compressed – can be a compensation to lung disease with 
increased resistance 
 
3. Muscle tone – parasympathetic stimulation causes bronchiolar 
smooth muscle to contract; sympathetic stimulation causes 
relaxation 
 
4. Elastic recoil of airways – in some diseases such as emphysema, 
have decreased elastic recoil which leads to less negative Pip 
so airway diameter will be smaller and resistance higher 

Resistance & Air Flow 
F = (PA- Patm) /R 

Key Concepts 
•
PA – Pip determines lung size and PA – Patm 
determines air flow 
 
•
Airway resistance increases during expiration. 
During forced expiration, when intrapleural 
pressures become positive, small airways are 
compressed (dynamic compression) and may 
even collapse.
