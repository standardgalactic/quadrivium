Preface
Basic Engineering Mathematics, 4th Edition introduces and then consolidates basic mathematical principles and promotes awareness
of mathematical concepts for students needing a broad base for further vocational studies. In this fourth edition, new material has
been added on engineering notation, inequalities, graphs with logarithmic scales and adding waveforms, together with extra practical
problems interspersed throughout the text.
The text covers:
(i) the Applied Mathematics content of the GNVQ mandatory unit ‘Applied Science and Mathematics for Engineering’ at
Intermediate level (i.e. GNVQ 2)
(ii) the mandatory ‘Mathematics for Engineering’ at Advanced level (i.e. GNVQ 3) in Engineering
(iii) the optional ‘Applied Mathematics for Engineering’ at Advanced level (i.e. GNVQ 3) in Engineering
(iv) the Mathematics content of ‘Applied Science and Mathematics for Technicians’ for Edexcel/BTEC First Certiﬁcate
(v) the mandatory ‘Mathematics for Technicians’ for National Certiﬁcate and National Diploma in Engineering
(vi) Mathematics 1 for City & Guilds Technician Certiﬁcate in Telecommunications and Electronics Engineering
(vii) basic mathematics for a wide range of introductory/access/foundation mathematics courses
(viii) GCSE revision, and for similar mathematics courses in English-speaking countries world-wide.
Basic Engineering Mathematics 4th Edition provides a lead into Engineering Mathematics 4th Edition.
Each topic considered in the text is presented in a way that assumes in the reader little previous knowledge of that topic. Theory is
introduced in each chapter by a brief outline of essential theory, deﬁnitions, formulae, laws and procedures. However, these are kept
to a minimum, for problem solving is extensively used to establish and exemplify the theory. It is intended that readers will gain real
understanding through seeing problems solved and then solving similar problems themselves.
This textbook contains some 600 worked problems, followed by over 1050 further problems (all with answers – at the end of the
book). The further problems are contained within some 129 Exercises; each Exercise follows on directly from the relevant section
of work. 260 line diagrams enhance the understanding of the theory. Where at all possible the problems mirror practical situations
found in engineering and science.
At regular intervals throughout the text are 15 Assignments to check understanding. For example, Assignment 1 covers material
contained in chapters 1 and 2, Assignment 2 covers the material contained in chapters 3 and 4, and so on. These Assignments do
not have answers given since it is envisaged that lecturers could set the Assignments for students to attempt as part of their course
structure. Lecturers may obtain a complimentary set of solutions of the Assignments in an Instructor’s Manual available from the
publishers via the internet – see below.
At the end of the book a list of relevant formulae contained within the text is included for convenience of reference.
‘Learning by Example’ is at the heart of Basic Engineering Mathematics 4th Edition.

Basic arithmetic
1.1
Arithmetic operations
Whole numbers are called integers. +3, +5, +72 are called posi-
tive integers; −13, −6, −51 are called negative integers. Between
positive and negative integers is the number 0 which is neither
positive nor negative.
The four basic arithmetic operators are: add (+), subtract (−),
multiply (×) and divide (÷)
For addition and subtraction, when unlike signs are together
in a calculation, the overall sign is negative. Thus, adding minus
4 to 3 is 3 + −4 and becomes 3 −4 = −1. Like signs together
give an overall positive sign. Thus subtracting minus 4 from 3 is
3 −−4 and becomes 3 + 4 = 7. For multiplication and division,
when the numbers have unlike signs, the answer is negative, but
when the numbers have like signs the answer is positive. Thus
3 × −4 = −12, whereas −3 × −4 = +12. Similarly
4
−3 = −4
3
and
−4
−3 = +4

Problem 1.
Add 27, −74, 81 and −19
This problem is written as 27 −74 + 81 −19
Adding the positive integers:
27
81
Sum of positive integers is:
108
Adding the negative integers:
74
19
Sum of negative integers is:
93
Taking the sum of the negative integers from the sum of the
positive integers gives:
108
−93
15
Thus 27 −74 + 81 −19 = 15
Problem 2.
Subtract 89 from 123
This is written mathematically as 123 −89
123
−89
34
Thus 123 −89 = 34
Problem 3.
Subtract −74 from 377
This problem is written as 377 −−74. Like signs together give
an overall positive sign, hence
377 −−74 = 377 + 74
377
+74
451
Thus 377 −−74 = 451
Problem 4.
Subtract 243 from 126
The problem is 126 −243. When the second number is larger
than the ﬁrst, take the smaller number from the larger and make
the result negative.
Thus 126 −243 = −(243 −126)
243
−126
117
Thus 126 −243 = −117
Problem 5.
Subtract 318 from −269

2
Basic Engineering Mathematics
−269 −318. The sum of the negative integers is
269
+318
587
Thus −269 −318 = −587
Problem 6.
Multiply 74 by 13
This is written as 74 × 13
74
13
222
←74 × 3
740
←74 × 10
Adding:
962
Thus 74 × 13 = 962
Problem 7.
Multiply by 178 by −46
When the numbers have different signs, the result will be nega-
tive. (With this in mind, the problem can now be solved by
multiplying 178 by 46)
178
46
1068
7120
8188
Thus 178 × 46 = 8188 and 178 × (−46) = −8188
Problem 8.
Divide l043 by 7
When dividing by the numbers 1 to 12, it is usual to use a method
called short division.
1 4 9
7

103463
Step 1.
7 into 10 goes 1, remainder 3. Put 1 above the 0 of 1043
and carry the 3 remainder to the next digit on the right,
making it 34;
Step 2.
7 into 34 goes 4, remainder 6. Put 4 above the 4 of 1043
and carry the 6 remainder to the next digit on the right,
making it 63;
Step 3.
7 into 63 goes 9, remainder 0. Put 9 above the 3 of 1043.
Thus 1043 ÷ 7 = 149
Problem 9.
Divide 378 by 14
When dividing by numbers which are larger than 12, it is usual
to use a method called long division.
27
14

378

(2) 2 × 14 →
(4) 7 × 14 →
(1) 14 into 37 goes twice.
Put 2 above the 7 of 378.
(3) Subtract. Bring down the
8. 14 into 98 goes 7 times.
Put 7 above the 8 of 378.
(5) Subtract.
Thus 378 ÷ 14 = 27
Problem 10.
Divide 5669 by 46
This problem may be written as
5669
46
or 5669 ÷ 46 or
5669/46
Using the long division method shown in Problem 9 gives:
123
46

5669

As there are no more digits to bring down,
5669 ÷ 46 = 123, remainder 11
or

Highest common factors and lowest
common multiples
When two or more numbers are multiplied together, the indi-
vidual numbers are called factors. Thus a factor is a number
which divides into another number exactly.The highest common
factor (HCF) is the largest number which divides into two or
more numbers exactly.
A multiple is a number which contains another number an
exact number of times. The smallest number which is exactly
divisible by each of two or more numbers is called the lowest
common multiple (LCM).
Problem 11.
Determine the HCF of the numbers 12, 30
and 42
Each number is expressed in terms of its lowest factors. This is
achieved by repeatedly dividing by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7,
11, 13 . . . (where possible) in turn. Thus
12  2  2 3
30  2
 3  5
42  2
 3  7
The factors which are common to each of the numbers are 2 in
column 1 and 3 in column 3, shown by the broken lines. Hence
the HCF is 2 × 3, i.e. 6. That is, 6 is the largest number which
will divide into 12, 30 and 42.
Problem 12.
Determine the HCF of the numbers 30, 105,
210 and 1155
Using the method shown in Problem 11:

Order of precedence and brackets
When a particular arithmetic operation is to be performed ﬁrst,
the numbers and the operator(s) are placed in brackets. Thus 3
timestheresultof6minus2iswrittenas3 × (6 −2).Inarithmetic
operations, the order in which operations are performed are:
(i) to determine the values of operations contained in brackets;
(ii) multiplication and division (the word ‘of’ also means
multiply); and
(iii) addition and subtraction.
This order of precedence can be remembered by the word
BODMAS, standing for Brackets, Of, Division, Multiplication,
Addition and Subtraction, taken in that order.
The basic laws governing the use of brackets and operators are
shown by the following examples:
(i) 2 + 3 = 3 + 2, i.e. the order of numbers when adding does
not matter;
(ii) 2 × 3 = 3 × 2, i.e. the order of numbers when multiplying
does not matter;
(iii) 2 + (3 + 4) = (2 + 3) + 4, i.e. the use of brackets when
adding does not affect the result;
(iv) 2 × (3 × 4) = (2 × 3) × 4, i.e. the use of brackets when
multiplying does not affect the result;
(v) 2 × (3 + 4) = 2(3 + 4) = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4, i.e. a number placed
outside of a bracket indicates that the whole contents of the
bracket must be multiplied by that number;
(vi) (2 + 3)(4 + 5) = (5)(9) = 45, i.e. adjacent brackets indicate
multiplication;
(vii) 2[3 + (4 × 5)] = 2[3 + 20] = 2 × 23 = 46, i.e. when an
expression contains inner and outer brackets, the inner
brackets are removed ﬁrst.

Fractions
When 2 is divided by 3, it may be written as 2
3 or 2/3. 2
3 is
called a fraction. The number above the line, i.e. 2, is called the
numerator and the number below the line, i.e. 3, is called the
denominator.
When the value of the numerator is less than the value of the
denominator, the fraction is called a proper fraction; thus 2
3 is a
proper fraction. When the value of the numerator is greater than
the denominator, the fraction is called an improper fraction.
Thus 7
3 is an improper fraction and can also be expressed as a
mixed number, that is, an integer and a proper fraction. Thus
the improper fraction 7
3 is equal to the mixed number 2 1
3.
When a fraction is simpliﬁed by dividing the numerator
and denominator by the same number, the process is called
cancelling. Cancelling by 0 is not permissible.

Ratio and proportion
Theratioofonequantitytoanotherisafraction,andisthenumber
of times one quantity is contained in another quantity of the
same kind. If one quantity is directly proportional to another,
then as one quantity doubles, the other quantity also doubles.
When a quantity is inversely proportional to another, then as
one quantity doubles, the other quantity is halved.
Problem 11.
Divide 126 in the ratio of 5 to 13.
Because the ratio is to be 5 parts to 13 parts, then the total number
of parts is 5 + 13, that is 18. Then,
18 parts correspond to 126
Hence
1 part corresponds to 126
18 = 7,
5 parts correspond to 5 × 7 = 35 and 13 parts correspond to
13 × 7 = 91

Decimals
The decimal system of numbers is based on the digits 0 to 9.
A number such as 53.17 is called a decimal fraction, a decimal
point separating the integer part, i.e. 53, from the fractional part,
i.e. 0.17.
A number which can be expressed exactly as a decimal
fraction is called a terminating decimal and those which can-
not be expressed exactly as a decimal fraction are called non-
terminating
decimals.
Thus,
3
2 = 1.5
is
a
terminating
decimal, but
4
3 = 1.33333 . . . is a non-terminating decimal.
1.33333 . . . can be written as 1.˙3, called ‘one point-three
recurring’.
The answer to a non-terminating decimal may be expressed in
two ways, depending on the accuracy required:
(i) correct to a number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, that is, ﬁgures
which signify something, and
(ii) correct to a number of decimal places, that is, the number of
ﬁgures after the decimal point.
The last digit in the answer is unaltered if the next digit on the
right is in the group of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, but is increased
by 1 if the next digit on the right is in the group of numbers 5, 6,
7, 8 or 9. Thus the non-terminating decimal 7.6183 . . . becomes
7.62, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, since the next digit on the
right is 8, which is in the group of numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. Also
7.6183 . . . becomes 7.618, correct to 3 decimal places, since the
next digit on the right is 3, which is in the group of numbers 0,
1, 2, 3 or 4.

17.83 + 57.6 = 75.43
Taking the sum of the negative decimal fractions from the sum
of the positive decimal fractions gives:

Problem 20.
Determine the value of 74.3 × 3.8

Percentages
Percentages are used to give a common standard and are
fractions having the number 100 as their denominators. For
example, 25 per cent means 25
100 i.e. 1
4 and is written 25%.
Problem 24.
Express as percentages: (a) 1.875 and
(b) 0.0125
A decimal fraction is converted to a percentage by multiplying
by 100. Thus,
(a) 1.875 corresponds to 1.875 × 100%, i.e. 187.5%
(b) 0.0125 corresponds to 0.0125 × 100%, i.e. 1.25%
Problem 25.
Express as percentages:
(a) 5
16 and (b) 12
5
To convert fractions to percentages, they are (i) converted to

division,
5
16 = 0.3125,
hence
5
16
corresponds to
0.3125 × 100%, i.e. 31.25%
(b) Similarly, 12
5 = 1.4 when expressed as a decimal fraction.
Hence 12
5 = 1.4 × 100% = 140%

Problem 26.
It takes 50 minutes to machine a certain part.
Using a new type of tool, the time can be reduced by 15%.
Calculate the new time taken.
15% of 50 minutes = 15
100 × 50 = 750
100 = 7.5 minutes.
Hence the new time taken is 50 −7.5 = 42.5 minutes.
Alternatively, if the time is reduced by 15%, then it now
takes 85% of the original time, i.e. 85% of 50 = 85
100 × 50 =
4250
100 = 42.5 minutes, as above.
Problem 27.

Problem 28.
Express 25 minutes as a percentage of
2 hours, correct to the nearest 1%.
Working in minute units, 2 hours = 120 minutes. Hence
25 minutes is 25
120ths of 2 hours.
By cancelling, 25
120 = 5

Expressing 5
24 as a decimal fraction gives 0.208˙3
Multiplyingby100toconvertthedecimalfractiontoapercentage

Thus 25 minutes is 21% of 2 hours, correct to the nearest 1%.
Problem 29.
A German silver alloy consists of 60% cop-
per, 25% zinc and 15% nickel. Determine the masses of the
copper, zinc and nickel in a 3.74 kilogram block of the alloy.
By direct proportion:
100% corresponds to 3.74 kg
1% corresponds to 3.74
100 = 0.0374 kg
60% corresponds to 60 × 0.0374 = 2.244 kg
25% corresponds to 25 × 0.0374 = 0.935 kg
15% corresponds to 15 × 0.0374 = 0.561 kg
Thus, the masses of the copper, zinc and nickel are 2.244 kg,
0.935 kg and 0.561 kg, respectively.
(Check: 2.244 + 0.935 + 0.561 = 3.74)

Indices, standard form and engineering
notation
3.1
Indices
The lowest factors of 2000 are 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5. These
factors are written as 24 × 53, where 2 and 5 are called bases and
the numbers 4 and 3 are called indices.
When an index is an integer it is called a power. Thus, 24 is
called ‘two to the power of four’, and has a base of 2 and an index
of 4. Similarly, 53 is called ‘ﬁve to the power of 3’and has a base
of 5 and an index of 3.
Special names may be used when the indices are 2 and 3, these
being called ‘squared’and ‘cubed’, respectively.Thus 72 is called
‘seven squared’ and 93 is called ‘nine cubed’. When no index is
shown, the power is 1, i.e. 2 means 21.
Reciprocal
The reciprocal of a number is when the index is −1 and its value
is given by 1 divided by the base. Thus the reciprocal of 2 is
2−1 and its value is 1
2 or 0.5. Similarly, the reciprocal of 5 is 5−1
which means 1
5 or 0.2
Square root
The square root of a number is when the index is
1
2, and
the square root of 2 is written as 21/2 or
√
2. The value of a
square root is the value of the base which when multiplied by
itself gives the number. Since 3 × 3 = 9, then
√
9 = 3. However,
(−3) × (−3) = 9, so
√
9 = −3. There are always two answers
when ﬁnding the square root of a number and this is shown by
putting both a + and a −sign in front of the answer to a square
root problem. Thus
√
9 = ±3 and 41/2 =
√
4 = ±2, and so on.
Laws of indices
When simplifying calculations involving indices, certain basic
rules or laws can be applied, called the laws of indices. These
are given below.
(i) When multiplying two or more numbers having the same
base, the indices are added. Thus
32 × 34 = 32+4 = 36
(ii) When a number is divided by a number having the same
base, the indices are subtracted. Thus
35
32 = 35−2 = 33
(iii) When a number which is raised to a power is raised to a
further power, the indices are multiplied. Thus
(35)2 = 35×2 = 310
(iv) When a number has an index of 0, its value is 1. Thus 30 = 1
(v) A number raised to a negative power is the reciprocal of
that number raised to a positive power. Thus 3−4 = 1
34
Similarly,
1
2−3 = 23
(vi) When a number is raised to a fractional power the denomina-
tor of the fraction is the root of the number and the numerator
is the power.
Thus
82/3 =
3√
82 = (2)2 = 4
and
251/2 =
2√
251 =
√
251 = ±5
(Note that

Standard form
A number written with one digit to the left of the decimal point
and multiplied by 10 raised to some power is said to be written in
standard form.Thus: 5837 is written as 5.837 × 103 in standard
form, and 0.0415 is written as 4.15 × 10−2 in standard form.
When a number is written in standard form, the ﬁrst factor is
called the mantissa and the second factor is called the exponent.
Thus the number 5.8 × 103 has a mantissa of 5.8 and an exponent
of 103
(i) Numbers having the same exponent can be added or
subtracted in standard form by adding or subtracting the
mantissae and keeping the exponent the same. Thus:
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 104 = (2.3 + 3.7) × 104
= 6.0 × 104
and
5.9 × 10−2 −4.6 × 10−2 = (5.9 −4.6) × 10−2
= 1.3 × 10−2

18
Basic Engineering Mathematics
When the numbers have different exponents, one way of
adding or subtracting the numbers is to express one of the
numbers in non-standard form, so that both numbers have
the same exponent. Thus:
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 103 = 2.3 × 104 + 0.37 × 104
= (2.3 + 0.37) × 104
= 2.67 × 104
Alternatively,
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 103 = 23 000 + 3700 = 26 700
= 2.67 × 104
(ii) The laws of indices are used when multiplying or dividing
numbers given in standard form. For example,
(2.5 × 103) × (5 × 102) = (2.5 × 5) × (103+2)
= 12.5 × 105 or 1.25 × 106
Similarly,
6 × 104
1.5 × 102 = 6
1.5 × (104−2) = 4 × 102
3.5 Worked problems on standard form
Problem 16.
Express in standard form:
(a) 38.71 (b) 3746 (c) 0.0124
For a number to be in standard form, it is expressed with only
one digit to the left of the decimal point. Thus:
(a) 38.71 must be divided by 10 to achieve one digit to the left
of the decimal point and it must also be multiplied by 10 to
maintain the equality, i.e.
38.71 = 38.71
10
× 10 = 3.871 × 10 in standard form
(b) 3746 = 3746
1000 × 1000 = 3.746 × 103 in standard form
(c) 0.0124 = 0.0124 × 100
100 = 1.24
100 = 1.24 × 10−2 in standard
form

(a) 1.725 × 10−2 = 1.725
100 = 0.01725
(b) 5.491 × 104 = 5.491 × 10 000 = 54 910
(c) 9.84 × 100 = 9.84 × 1 = 9.84 (since 100 = 1)

Problem 20.
Find the value of
(a) 7.9 × 10−2 −5.4 × 10−2
(b) 8.3 × 103 + 5.415 × 103 and
(c) 9.293 × 102 + 1.3 × 103 expressing the answers in
standard form.
Numbers having the same exponent can be added or subtracted
by adding or subtracting the mantissae and keeping the exponent
the same. Thus:
(a) 7.9 × 10−2 −5.4 × 10−2 = (7.9 −5.4) × 10−2
= 2.5 × 10−2
(b) 8.3 × 103 + 5.415 × 103 = (8.3 + 5.415) × 103
= 13.715 × 103
= 1.3715 × 104
in standard form.
(c) Since only numbers having the same exponents can be
added by straight addition of the mantissae, the numbers are
converted to this form before adding. Thus:
9.293 × 102 + 1.3 × 103 = 9.293 × 102 + 13 × 102
= (9.293 + 13) × 102
= 22.293 × 102
= 2.2293×103
in standard form.
Alternatively, the numbers can be expressed as decimal
fractions, giving:
9.293 × 102 + 1.3 × 103
= 929.3 + 1300
= 2229.3
= 2.2293×103
in standard form as obtained previously.This method is often
the ‘safest’ way of doing this type of problem.

= 22.50 × 107
= 2.25 × 108
(b) 3.5 × 105
7 × 102 = 3.5

Engineering notation and
common preﬁxes
Engineering notation is similar to scientiﬁc notation except that
the power of ten is always a multiple of 3. For example,
0.00035 = 3.5 × 10−4 in scientiﬁc notation,
but
0.00035 = 0.35 × 10−3
or
350 × 10−6
in engineering notation.
Units used in engineering and science may be made larger or
smaller by using preﬁxes that denote multiplication or division
by a particular amount. The eight most common multiples, with

A calculator is needed for many engineering calculations, and
having a calculator which has an ‘EXP’ and ‘ENG’ function is
most helpful.
For example, to calculate: 3 × 104 × 0.5 × 10−6 volts, input
your calculator in the following order: (a) Enter ‘3’ (b) Press
‘EXP’ (c) Enter ‘4’ (d) Press‘ × ’(e) Enter ‘0.5’ (f) Press ‘EXP’
(g) Enter ‘−6’ (h) Press ‘=’
The answer is 0.015 V. Now press the ‘ENG’ button, and the
answer changes to 15 × 10−3V. The ‘ENG’ or ‘Engineering’
button ensures that the value is stated to a power of 10 that is
a multiple of 3, enabling you, in this example, to express the
answer as 15 mV.

Errors and approximations
(i) In all problems in which the measurement of distance, time,
mass or other quantities occurs, an exact answer cannot be
given; only an answer which is correct to a stated degree
of accuracy can be given. To take account of this an error
due to measurement is said to exist.
(ii) To take account of measurement errors it is usual to limit
answers so that the result given is not more than one sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgure greater than the least accurate number
given in the data.
(iii) Rounding-off errors can exist with decimal fractions. For
example, to state that π = 3.142 is not strictly correct,
but ‘π = 3.142 correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures’ is a true
statement.
(Actually, π = 3.14159265 . . .)
(iv) It is possible, through an incorrect procedure, to obtain the
wrong answer to a calculation. This type of error is known
as a blunder.
(v) An order of magnitude error is said to exist if incorrect
positioning of the decimal point occurs after a calculation
has been completed.
(vi) Blunders and order of magnitude errors can be reduced by
determining approximate values of calculations.Answers
which do not seem feasible must be checked and the cal-
culation must be repeated as necessary. An engineer will
often need to make a quick mental approximation for
a calculation. For example, 49.1 × 18.4 × 122.1
61.2 × 38.1
may be
approximated to 50 × 20 × 120
60 × 40

= 50. An accurate answer somewhere
between 45 and 55 could therefore be expected. Certainly
an answer around 500 or 5 would not be expected. Actu-

61.2 × 38.1
= 47.31, correct to

The approximate value is 1

obvious blunder or magnitude errors. However, it is not usual
in a measurement type problem to state the answer to an accu-
racy greater than 1 signiﬁcant ﬁgure more than the least accurate
number in the data: this is 7.5 cm, so the result should not have
more than 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
Thus area of triangle = 12.2 cm2

Conversion tables and charts
It is often necessary to make calculations from various con-
version tables and charts. Examples include currency exchange
rates, imperial to metric unit conversions, train or bus timetables,
production schedules and so on.
Problem 14.
Currency exchange rates for ﬁve countries
are shown in Table 4.1
Table 4.1
France
£1 = 1.50 euros
Japan
£1 = 175 yen
Norway
£1 = 11.25 kronor
Switzerland
£1 = 2.20 francs
U.S.A.
£1 = 1.82 dollars ($)
Calculate:
(a) how many French euros £27.80 will buy,
(b) the number of Japanese yen which can be bought
for £23,
(c) the pounds sterling which can be exchanged for 6412.5
Norwegian kronor,
(d) thenumberofAmericandollarswhichcanbepurchased
for £90, and
(e) the pounds sterling which can be exchanged for 2794
Swiss francs.
(a) £1 = 1.50 euros, hence
£27.80 = 27.80 × 1.50 euros = 41.70 euros
(b) £1 = 175 yen, hence
£23 = 23 × 175 yen = 4025 yen
(c) £1 = 11.25 kronor, hence
6412.5 kronor = £6412.5
11.25 = £570
(d) £1 = 1.82 dollars, hence
£90 = 90 × 1.82 dollars = $163.80
(e) £1 = 2.20 Swiss francs, hence
2794 franc = £2794
2.20 = £1270
Problem 15.

(e) the number of pounds and ounces in 42 kilograms
(correct to the nearest ounce),
(f ) the number of litres in 15 gallons, and
(g) the number of gallons in 40 litres.
(a) 9.5 inches = 9.5 × 2.54 cm = 24.13 cm
24.13 cm = 24.13 × 10 mm = 241.3 mm
(b) 50 m.p.h. = 50 × 1.61 km/h = 80.5 km/h
(c) 300 km = 300
1.61 miles = 186.3 miles
(d) 30 lb = 30
2.2 kg = 13.64 kg
(e) 42 kg = 42 × 2.2 lb = 92.4 lb
0.4 lb = 0.4 × 16 oz = 6.4 oz = 6 oz, correct to the nearest
ounce. Thus 42 kg = 92 lb 6 oz, correct to the nearest ounce.
(f ) 15 gallons = 15 × 8 pints = 120 pints
120 pints = 120
1.76 litres = 68.18 litres
(g) 40 litres = 40 × 1.76 pints = 70.4 pints
70.4 pints = 70.4

Evaluation of formulae
The statement v = u + at is said to be a formula for v in terms
of u, a and t.
v, u, a and t are called symbols.
The single term on the left-hand side of the equation, v, is
called the subject of the formulae.
Provided values are given for all the symbols in a formula
except one, the remaining symbol can be made the subject of the
formula and may be evaluated by using a calculator.
Problem 16.
In an electrical circuit the voltage V is given
by Ohm’s law, i.e. V = IR. Find, correct to 4 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, the voltage when I = 5.36 A and R = 14.76 .
V = IR = (5.36)(14.76)
Hence voltage V = 79.11V, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Problem 17.
The surface area A of a hollow cone is given
by A = πrl. Determine, correct to 1 decimal place, the
surface area when r = 3.0 cm and l = 8.5 cm.
A = πrl = π(3.0)(8.5) cm2
Hence surface area A = 80.1 cm2, correct to 1 decimal place.
Problem 18.
Velocity v is given by v = u + at. If
u = 9.86 m/s, a = 4.25 m/s2 and t = 6.84 s, ﬁnd v, correct
to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
v = u + at = 9.86 + (4.25)(6.84)
= 9.86 + 29.07
= 38.93
Hence
velocity
υ = 38.9 m/s,
correct
to
3
signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
Problem 19.
The area, A, of a circle is given by A = πr2.
Determine the area correct to 2 decimal places, given radius
r = 5.23 m.
A = πr2 = π(5.23)2 = π(27.3529)
Hence area, A = 85.93 m2, correct to 2 decimal places.

circuit may be expressed by the formula P = V 2
R . Evalu-
ate the power, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, given that

18.35 cm, ﬁnd the volume, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
V = 1
3πr2h = 1
3π(4.321)2(18.35)

Computer numbering systems

Binary numbers
The system of numbers in everyday use is the denary or decimal
system of numbers, using the digits 0 to 9. It has ten different
digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) and is said to have a radix or
base of 10.
The binary system of numbers has a radix of 2 and uses only
the digits 0 and 1.
5.2
Conversion of binary to denary
The denary number 234.5 is equivalent to
2 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10−1
i.e. is the sum of terms comprising: (a digit) multiplied by (the
base raised to some power).
In the binary system of numbers, the base is 2, so 1101.1 is
equivalent to:
1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 + 1 × 2−1
Thus the denary number equivalent to the binary number
1101.1 is
8 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1
2, that is 13.5
i.e. 1101.12 = 13.510, the sufﬁxes 2 and 10 denoting binary and
denary systems of numbers respectively.
Problem 1.
Convert 110112 to a denary number.
From above: 110112 = 1 × 24 + 1 × 23 + 0 × 22
+ 1 × 21 + 1 × 20
= 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1
= 2710
Problem 2.
Convert 0.10112 to a decimal fraction.
0.10112 = 1 × 2−1 + 0 × 2−2 + 1 × 2−3 + 1 × 2−4

101.01012 = 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 + 0 × 2−1
+ 1 × 2−2 + 0 × 2−3 + 1 × 2−4
= 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0.25 + 0 + 0.0625

The result is obtained by writing the top digit of the remainder
as the least signiﬁcant bit, (a bit is a binary digit and the least
signiﬁcant bit is the one on the right). The bottom bit of the
remainder is the most signiﬁcant bit, i.e. the bit on the left.
Thus 3910 = 1001112

Conversion of denary to binary
via octal
For denary integers containing several digits, repeatedly dividing
by 2 can be a lengthy process. In this case, it is usually easier to
convert a denary number to a binary number via the octal system
of numbers. This system has a radix of 8, using the digits 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The denary number equivalent to the octal
number 43178 is
4 × 83 + 3 × 82 + 1 × 81 + 7 × 80
i.e.
4 × 512 + 3 × 64 + 1 × 8 + 7 × 1
or

Hexadecimal numbers
The complexity of computers requires higher order numbering
systems such as octal (base 8) and hexadecimal (base 16) which
are merely extensions of the binary system. A hexadecimal
numbering system has a radix of 16 and uses the following
16 distinct digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F
‘A’corresponds to 10 in the denary system, B to 11, C to 12, and
so on.
To convert from hexadecimal to decimal:
For example
1A16 = 1 × 161 + A × 160
= 1 × 161 + 10 × 1 = 16 + 10 = 26
i.e.
1A16 = 2610
Similarly,
2E16 = 2 × 161 + E × 160
= 2 × 161 + 14 × 160 = 32 + 14 = 4610

34
Basic Engineering Mathematics
and
1BF16 = 1 × 162 + B × 161 + F × 160
= 1 × 162 + 11 × 161 + 15 × 160
= 256 + 176 + 15 = 44710

Algebra

Basic operations
Algebra is that part of mathematics in which the relations and
properties of numbers are investigated by means of general sym-
bols. For example, the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying
the length by the breadth; this is expressed algebraically as
A = l × b, where A represents the area, l the length and b the
breadth.
The basic laws introduced in arithmetic are generalized in
algebra.
Let a, b, c and d represent any four numbers. Then:
(i) a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
(ii) a(bc) = (ab)c
(iii) a + b = b + a
(iv) ab = ba
(v) a(b + c) = ab + ac
(vi) a + b
c
= a
b + b
c
(vii) (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd
Problem 1.
Evaluate 3ab −2bc + abc when a = 1, b = 3
and c = 5
Replacing a, b and c with their numerical values gives:
3ab −2bc + abc = 3 × 1 × 3 −2 × 3 × 5 + 1 × 3 × 5
= 9 −30 + 15 = −6

Problem 3.
Find the sum of 3x, 2x, −x and −7x
The sum of the positive terms is: 3x + 2x = 5x
The sum of the negative terms is: x + 7x = 8x
Taking the sum of the negative terms from the sum of the positive
terms gives:
5x −8x = −3x
Alternatively
3x + 2x + (−x) + (−7x) = 3x + 2x −x −7x = −3x
Problem 4.
Find the sum of 4a, 3b, c, −2a, −5b and 6c
Each symbol must be dealt with individually.
For the ‘a’ terms:
+4a −2a = 2a
For the ‘b’ terms:
+3b −5b = −2b
For the ‘c’ terms:
+c + 6c = 7c
Thus 4a + 3b + c + (−2a) + (−5b) + 6c
= 4a + 3b + c −2a −5b + 6c
= 2a −2b + 7c
Problem 5.
Find the sum of 5a −2b, 2a + c, 4b −5d and
b −a + 3d −4c
The algebraic expressions may be tabulated as shown below,
forming columns for the a’s, b’s, c’s and d’s. Thus:
+5a −2b
+2a

+ 4b

−a + b −4c + 3d
Adding gives:

Problem 6.
Subtract 2x + 3y −4z from x −2y + 5z
x −2y + 5z
2x + 3y −4z
Subtracting gives:
−x−5y + 9z
(Note that +5z −−4z = +5z + 4z = 9z)
An alternative method of subtracting algebraic expressions is
to ‘change the signs of the bottom line and add’. Hence:
x −2y + 5z
−2x −3y + 4z
Adding gives:
−x −5y + 9z
Problem 7.
Multiply 2a + 3b by a + b
Each term in the ﬁrst expression is multiplied by a, then each
term in the ﬁrst expression is multiplied by b, and the two results
are added. The usual layout is shown below.
2a + 3b
a + b
Multiplying by a →
2a2+ 3ab
Multiplying by b →
+ 2ab + 3b2
Adding gives:
2a2+ 5ab + 3b2
Problem 8.

Multiplying

Adding gives:
6x2−24xy2 + 8x2y −15xy + 10y3
Problem 9.
Simplify 2p ÷ 8pq
2p ÷ 8pq means 2p
8pq. This can be reduced by cancelling as in
arithmetic.
Thus: 2p

8 × p × p = 1

Problem 10.
Divide 2x2 + x −3 by x −1
2x2 + x −3 is called the dividend and x −1 the divisor. The
usual layout is shown below with the dividend and divisor both
arranged in descending powers of the symbols.
2x + 3
x −1

2x2 + x −3
2x2 −2x
3x −3
3x −3
0
0
Dividing the ﬁrst term of the dividend by the ﬁrst term of the
divisor, i.e. 2x2
x
gives 2x, which is put above the ﬁrst term of
the dividend as shown. The divisor is then multiplied by 2x,
i.e. 2x(x −1) = 2x2 −2x, which is placed under the dividend as
shown. Subtracting gives 3x −3.
The process is then repeated, i.e. the ﬁrst term of the divisor, x,
is divided into 3x, giving 3, which is placed above the dividend
as shown.
Then 3(x −1) = 3x −3, which is placed under the 3x −3. The
remainder, on subtraction, is zero, which completes the process.
Thus (2x2 + x −3) ÷ (x −1) = (2x + 3)
(A check can be made on this answer by multiplying (2x + 3) by
(x −1), which equals (2x2 + x −3)

(4) x into −x2y goes −xy.
Put −xy above dividend
(5) −xy(x + y) = −x2y −xy2
(6) Subtract
(7) x into xy2 goes y2. Put y2

(8) y2(x + y) = xy2 + y3
(9) Subtract
Thus x3 + y3

The zeros shown in the dividend are not normally shown, but are

Brackets and factorization
When two or more terms in an algebraic expression contain
a common factor, then this factor can be shown outside of
a bracket. For example
ab + ac = a(b + c)
which is simply the reverse of law (v) of algebra on page 36, and
6px + 2py −4pz = 2p(3x + y −2z)
This process is called factorization.
Problem26.
Removethebracketsandsimplifytheexpres-
sion (3a + b) + 2(b + c) −4(c + d)
Both b and c in the second bracket have to be multiplied by 2,
and c and d in the third bracket by −4 when the brackets are
removed. Thus:
(3a + b) + 2(b + c) −4(c + d)
= 3a + b + 2b + 2c −4c −4d
Collecting similar terms together gives: 3a + 3b −2c −4d
Problem 27.
Simplify a2 −(2a −ab) −a(3b + a)
When the brackets are removed, both 2a and −ab in the ﬁrst

bracket by −a. Thus
a2 −(2a −ab) −a(3b + a)
= a2 −2a + ab −3ab −a2
Collecting similar terms together gives: −2a −2ab.
Since −2a is a common factor, the answer can be expressed as
−2a(1 + b)
Problem 28.

Factorize ax −ay + bx −by
The ﬁrst two terms have a common factor of a and the last two

ax −ay + bx −by = a(x −y) + b(x −y)
The two newly formed terms have a common factor of
(x −y). Thus:
a(x −y) + b(x −y) = (x−y)(a+ b)
Problem 36.
Factorize 2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by
a is a common factor of the ﬁrst two terms and b a common factor
of the last two terms. Thus:
2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by = a(2x −3y) + b(2x −3y)
(2x −3y) is now a common factor thus:
a(2x −3y) + b(2x −3y) = (2x−3y)(a+b)
Alternatively, 2x is a common factor of the original ﬁrst and third
terms and −3y is a common factor of the second and fourth terms.
Thus:
2ax −3ay + 2bx −3by = 2x(a + b) −3y(a + b)
(a + b) is now a common factor thus:
2x(a + b) −3y(a + b) = (a + b)(2x −3y)
as before.

to algebraic expressions. The order is Brackets, Of, Division,

Direct and inverse proportionality
An expression such as y = 3x contains two variables. For every
value of x there is a corresponding value of y. The variable x is
called the independent variable and y is called the dependent
variable.
When an increase or decrease in an independent variable leads
to an increase or decrease of the same proportion in the dependent
variable this is termed direct proportion. If y = 3x then y is
directlyproportionaltox,whichmaybewrittenas y ∝x ory = kx,
where k is called the coefﬁcient of proportionality (in this case,
k being equal to 3).
When an increase in an independent variable leads to a
decrease of the same proportion in the dependent variable (or
vice versa) this is termed inverse proportion. If y is inversely
proportional to x then y ∝1
x or y = k/x. Alternatively, k = xy,
that is, for inverse proportionality the product of the variables is
constant.
Examples of laws involving direct and inverse proportional in
science include:
(i) Hooke’s law, which states that within the elastic limit of
a material, the strain ϵ produced is directly proportional to
the stress, σ, producing it, i.e. ε ∝σ or ε = kσ.
(ii) Charles’s law, which states that for a given mass of gas at
constant pressure the volume V is directly proportional to
its thermodynamic temperature T, i.e. V ∝T or V = kT.
(iii) Ohm’s law, which states that the current I ﬂowing through
a ﬁxed resistor is directly proportional to the applied voltage
V, i.e. I ∝V or I = kV.
(iv) Boyle’s law, which states that for a gas at constant tem-
perature, the volume V of a ﬁxed mass of gas is inversely
proportional to its absolute pressure p, i.e. p ∝(1/V) or
p = k/V, i.e. pV = k
Problem 50.
If y is directly proportional to x and y = 2.48
when x = 0.4, determine (a) the coefﬁcient of proportion-
ality and (b) the value of y when x = 0.65
(a) y ∝x, i.e. y = kx. If y = 2.48 when x = 0.4, 2.48 = k(0.4)
Hence the coefﬁcient of proportionality,
k = 2.48
0.4 = 6.2
(b) y = kx, hence, when x = 0.65, y = (6.2)(0.65) = 4.03
Problem 51.
Hooke’s law states that stress σ is directly
proportional to strain ε within the elastic limit of a
material.When, for mild steel, the stress is 25 × 106 pascals,
the strain is 0.000125. Determine (a) the coefﬁcient of pro-
portionality and (b) the value of strain when the stress is
18 × 106 pascals.
(a) σ
∝
ε, i.e. σ = kε, from which k = σ/ε. Hence the
coefﬁcient of proportionality,
k = 25 × 106
0.000125 = 200 × 109 pascals
(The coefﬁcient of proportionality k in this case is called
Young’s Modulus of Elasticity)
(b) Since σ = kε, ε = σ/k
Hence when σ = 18 × 106, strain
ε = 18 × 106
200 × 109 = 0.00009
Problem 52.
The electrical resistance R of a piece of wire
is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area A.When
A = 5 mm2, R = 7.02 ohms. Determine (a) the coefﬁcient
of proportionality and (b) the cross-sectional area when the
resistance is 4 ohms.
(a) R ∝1
A, i.e. R = k/A or k = RA. Hence, when R = 7.2 and
A = 5, the coefﬁcient of proportionality, k = (7.2)(5) = 36
(b) Since k = RA then A = k/R
When R = 4, the cross sectional area, A = 36
4 = 9 mm2
Problem 53.
Boyle’s law states that at constant temper-
ature, the volume V of a ﬁxed mass of gas is inversely
proportional to its absolute pressure p. If a gas occupies
a volume of 0.08 m3 at a pressure of 1.5 × 106 pascals
determine (a) the coefﬁcient of proportionality and (b) the
volume if the pressure is changed to 4 × 106 pascals..
(a) V ∝1
p, i.e. V = k/p or k = pV
Hence the coefﬁcient of proportionality,
k = (1.5 × 106)(0.08) = 0.12 × 106
(b) Volume V = k
p = 0.12 × 106
4 × 106
= 0.03 m3

Simple equations
7.1
Expressions, equations and identities
(3x −5) is an example of an algebraic expression, whereas
3x −5 = 1 is an example of an equation (i.e. it contains an
‘equals’ sign).
An equation is simply a statement that two quantities are equal.
For example, 1 m = 1000 mm or F = 9
5C + 32 or y = mx + c.
An identity is a relationship which is true for all values of the
unknown, whereas an equation is only true for particular values
of the unknown. For example, 3x −5 = 1 is an equation, since
it is only true when x = 2, whereas 3x ≡8x −5x is an identity
since it is true for all values of x.
(Note ‘≡’ means ‘is identical to’).
Simple linear equations (or equations of the ﬁrst degree) are
those in which an unknown quantity is raised only to the power 1.
To ‘solve an equation’means ‘to ﬁnd the value of the unknown’.
Any arithmetic operation may be applied to an equation as long
as the equality of the equation is maintained.
7.2 Worked problems on simple
equations
Problem 1.
Solve the equation 4x = 20
Dividing each side of the equation by 4 gives: 4x
4 = 20
4
(Note that the same operation has been applied to both the left-
hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation so
the equality has been maintained) Cancelling gives: x = 5, which
is the solution to the equation.
Solutions to simple equations should always be checked and
this is accomplished by substituting the solution into the original
equation. In this case, LHS = 4(5) = 20 = RHS.
Problem 2.
Solve 2x
5 = 6
The LHS is a fraction and this can be removed by multiplying
both sides of the equation by 5. Hence 5
2x
5

= 5(6)
Cancelling gives: 2x = 30
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives:
2x
2 = 30
2
i.e. x = 15
Problem 3.
Solve a −5 = 8
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives:
a −5 + 5 = 8 + 5
i.e.
a = 13
The result of the above procedure is to move the ‘−5’ from the
LHS of the original equation, across the equals sign, to the RHS,
but the sign is changed to +.
Problem 4.
Solve x + 3 = 7
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation gives:
x + 3 −3 = 7 −3
i.e.
x = 4
The result of the above procedure is to move the ‘+3’ from the
LHS of the original equation, across the equals sign, to the RHS,
but the sign is changed to −. Thus a term can be moved from

48
Basic Engineering Mathematics
one side of an equation to the other as long as a change in sign
is made.
Problem 5.
Solve 6x + 1 = 2x + 9
In such equations the terms containing x are grouped on one side
of the equation and the remaining terms grouped on the other
side of the equation. As in Problems 3 and 4, changing from one
side of an equation to the other must be accompanied by a change
of sign.
Thus since
6x + 1 = 2x + 9
then
6x −2x = 9 −1
4x = 8
4x
4 = 8
4
i.e.
x = 2
Check:
LHS of original equation = 6(2) + 1 = 13
RHS of original equation = 2(2) + 9 = 13
Hence the solution x = 2 is correct.
Problem 6.
Solve 4 −3p = 2p −11
In order to keep the p term positive the terms in p are moved to
the RHS and the constant terms to the LHS.
Hence
4 + 11 = 2p + 3p
15 = 5p
15
5 = 5p
5
Hence
3 = p
or
p = 3
Check:
LHS = 4 −3(3) = 4 −9 = −5
RHS = 2(3) −11 = 6 −11 = −5
Hence the solution p = 3 is correct.
If, in this example, the unknown quantities had been grouped
initially on the LHS instead of the RHS then:
−3p −2p = −11 −4
i.e.
−5p = −15
−5p
−5 = −15
−5
and
p = 3, as before
It is often easier, however, to work with positive values where
possible.

i.e.
x = 5
Check:
LHS = 3(5 −2) = 3(3) = 9 = RHS
Hence the solution x = 5 is correct.
Problem 8.
Solve 4(2r −3) −2(r −4) = 3(r −3) −1
Removing brackets gives:
8r −12 −2r + 8 = 3r −9 −1
Rearranging gives:
8r −2r −3r = −9 −1 + 12 −8
i.e.
3r = −6
r = −6
3 = −2
Check:
LHS = 4(−4 −3) −2(−2 −4) = −28 + 12 = −16
RHS = 3(−2 −3) −1 = −15 −1 = −16
Hence the solution r = −2 is correct.

However, x = −5 is also a solution of the equation because
(−5) × (−5) = +25 Therefore, whenever the square root of a

the other negative.
The solution of x2 = 25 is thus written as x = ±5.

Problem 17. A copper wire has a length l of 1.5 km, a resist-
ance R of 5  and a resistivity of 17.2 × 10−6  mm. Find
the cross-sectional area, a, of the wire, given that R = ρl/a
Since
R = ρl/a
then
5  = (1.72 × 10−6  mm)(1500 × 103 mm)
a
From the units given, a is measured in mm2.
Thus
5a = 17.2 × 10−6 × 1500 × 103
and
a = 17.2 × 10−6 × 1500 × 103
5
= 17.2 × 1500 × 103
106 × 5

A rectangular box with square ends has its
length 15 cm greater than its breadth and the total length of
its edges is 2.04 m. Find the width of the box and its volume.
Let x cm = width = height of box. Then the length of the
box is (x + 15) cm. The length of the edges of the box is
2(4x) + 4(x + 15) cm.
Hence
204 = 2(4x) + 4(x + 15)
204 = 8x + 4x + 60
204 −60 = 12x
i.e.
144 = 12x
and
x = 12 cm
Hence the width of the box is 12 cm.
Volume of box = length × width × height

The temperature coefﬁcient of resistance α
may be calculated from the formula Rt = R0(1 + αt). Find

Since
Rt = R0(1 + αt)
then
0.928 = 0.8[1 + α(40)]
0.928 = 0.8 + (0.8)(α)(40)
0.928 −0.8 = 32α
0.128 = 32α

an initial velocity of 10 m/s.
s = ut + 1
2at2, and s = 168, u = 10 and t = 6
Hence
168 = (10)(6) + 1
2a(6)2
168 = 60 + 18a
168 −60 = 18a
108 = 18a
a = 108
18 = 6
Hence the acceleration of the body is 6 m/s2.

E = Fl/Ax,

A painter is paid £4.20 per hour for a basic
36 hour week, and overtime is paid at one and a third times
this rate. Determine how many hours the painter has to work
in a week to earn £212.80
Basic rate per hour = £4.20;
overtime rate per hour = 11
3 × £4.20 = £5.60
Let the number of overtime hours worked = x
Then
(36)(4.20) + (x)(5.60) = 212.80
151.20 + 5.60x = 212.80
5.60x = 212.80 −151.20 = 61.60
x = 61.60
5.60 = 11
Thus 11 hours overtime would have to be worked to earn
£212.80 per week.
Hence the total number of hours worked is 36 + 11, i.e.
47 hours.

. Find
the value of P2 given P1 = 100 × 103, V1 = 1.0, V2 = 0.266,
T1 = 423 and T2 = 293
Since P1V1
T1
= P2V2
T2
then (100 × 103)(1.0)
423
= P2(0.266)
293
‘Cross-multiplying’ gives:
(100 × 103)(1.0)(293) = P2(0.266)(423)
P2 = (100 × 103)(1.0)(293)
(0.266)(423)
Hence P2 = 260 × 103 or 2.6 × 105

f −1800
4(f −1800) = f + 1800
4f −7200 = f + 1800
4f −f = 1800 + 7200

12 workmen employed on a building site
earn between them a total of £2415 per week. Labourers
are paid £175 per week and craftsmen are paid £220 per
week. How many craftsmen and how many labourers are
employed?
Let the number of craftsmen be c. The number of labourers is
therefore (12 −c) The wage bill equation is:
220c + 175(12 −c) = 2415
220c + 2100 −175c = 2415
220c −175c = 2415 −2100
45c = 315
c = 315
45 = 7
Hence there are 7 craftsmen and (12 −7), i.e. 5 labourers on

Transposition of formulae

Introduction to transposition of
formulae
When a symbol other than the subject is required to be calcu-
lated it is usual to rearrange the formula to make a new subject.
This rearranging process is called transposing the formula or
transposition.
The rules used for transposition of formulae are the same as
those used for the solution of simple equations (see Chapter 7) —
basically, that the equality of an equation must be maintained.
8.2 Worked problems on transposition
of formulae
Problem 1.
Transpose p = q + r + s to make r the subject.
The aim is to obtain r on its own on the left-hand side (LHS) of
the equation. Changing the equation around so that r is on the
LHS gives:
q + r + s = p
(1)
Subtracting (q + s) from both sides of the equation gives:
q + r + s −(q + s)= p −(q + s)
Thus
q + r + s −q −s= p −q −s
i.e.
r = p −q −s
(2)
It is shown with simple equations, that a quantity can be moved
from one side of an equation to the other with an appropriate
change of sign. Thus equation (2) follows immediately from
equation (1) above.
Problem 2.
If a + b = w −x + y, express x as the subject.
Rearranging gives:
w −x + y = a + b
and
−x = a + b −w −y
Multiplying both sides by −1 gives:
(−1)(−x) = (−1)(a + b −w −y)
i.e.
x = −a −b + w + y
The result of multiplying each side of the equation by −1 is to
change all the signs in the equation.
It
is
conventional
to
express
answers
with
positive
quantities
ﬁrst.
Hence
rather
than
x = −a −b + w + y,
x = w + y −a −b, since the order of terms connected by
+ and −signs is immaterial.
Problem 3.

Simultaneous equations

Introduction to simultaneous
equations
Only one equation is necessary when ﬁnding the value of
a single unknown quantity (as with simple equations in
Chapter 7). However, when an equation contains two unknown
quantities it has an inﬁnite number of solutions.When two equa-
tions are available connecting the same two unknown values
then a unique solution is possible. Similarly, for three unknown
quantities it is necessary to have three equations in order to
solve for a particular value of each of the unknown quantities,
and so on.
Equations which have to be solved together to ﬁnd the unique
values of the unknown quantities, which are true for each of the
equations, are called simultaneous equations.
Two methods of solving simultaneous equations analytically
are:
(a) by substitution, and (b) by elimination.
(A graphical solution of simultaneous equations is shown in
Chapter 13.)
9.2 Worked problems on simultaneous
equations in two unknowns
Problem 1.
Solve the following equations for x and y,
(a) by substitution, and (b) by elimination:
x + 2y = −1
(1)
4x −3y = 18
(2)
(a) By substitution
From equation (1): x = −1 −2y
Substituting this expression for x into equation (2) gives:
4(−1 −2y) −3y = 18
This is now a simple equation in y.
Removing the bracket gives:
−4 −8y −3y = 18
−11y = 18 + 4 = 22
y =
22
−11 = −2
Substituting y = −2 into equation (1) gives:
x + 2( −2) = −1
x −4 = −1
x = −1 + 4 = 3
Thus x = 3 and y = −2 is the solution to the simultaneous
equations.
(Check:
In
equation
(2),
since
x = 3
and
y = −2,
LHS = 4(3) −3( −2) = 12 + 6 = 18 = RHS.)
(b) By elimination
x + 2y = −1
(1)
4x −3y = 18
(2)
If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 4 the coefﬁcient
of x will be the same as in equation (2), giving:
4x + 8y = −4
(3)
Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2) gives:
4x −3y = 18
(2)
4x + 8y = −4
(3)
———–———
0 −11y = 22

Simultaneous equations
61
Hence y = 22
−11 = −2
(Note, in the above subtraction, 18 −−4 = 18 + 4 = 22)
Substituting y = −2 into either equation (1) or equation (2)
will give x = 3 as in method (a). The solution x = 3, y = −2
is the only pair of values that satisﬁes both of the original
equations.
Problem 2.
Solve, by a substitution method, the simulta-
neous equations
3x −2y = 12
(1)
x + 3y = −7
(2)
From equation (2), x = −7 −3y
Substituting for x in equation (1) gives:
3(−7 −3y) −2y = 12
i.e.
−21 −9y −2y = 12
−11y = 12 + 21 = 33
Hence
y = 33
−11 = −3
Substituting y = −3 in equation (2) gives:
x + 3(−3) = −7
i.e.
x −9 = −7
Hence
x = −7 + 9 = 2
Thus x = 2, y = −3 is the solution of the simultaneous equations.
(Such solutions should always be checked by substituting values
into each of the original two equations.)
Problem 3.
Use an elimination method to solve the simul-
taneous equations
3x + 4y = 5
(1)
2x −5y = −12
(2)
If equation (1) is multiplied throughout by 2 and equation (2) by
3, then the coefﬁcient of x will be the same in the newly formed
equations. Thus
2 × equation (1) gives:
6x + 8y = 10
(3)
3 × equation (2) gives:
6x −15y = −36
(4)
Equation (3) −equation (4) gives:
0 + 23y = 46
i.e.
y = 46
23 = 2
(Note
+8y −−15y = 8y + 15y = 23y
and
10 −−36 = 10 +
36 = 46. Alternatively, ‘change the signs of the bottom line and
add’.)
Substituting y = 2 in equation (1) gives:
3x + 4(2) = 5
from which 3x = 5 −8 = −3
and
x = −1
Checking in equation (2), left-hand side = 2(−1) −5(2) =
−2 −10 = −12 = right-hand side.
Hence x = −1 and y = 2 is the solution of the simultaneous
equations.
The elimination method is the most common method of
solving simultaneous equations.
Problem 4.
Solve
7x −2y = 26
(1)
6x + 5y = 29
(2)
When equation (1) is multiplied by 5 and equation (2) by 2 the
coefﬁcients of y in each equation are numerically the same, i.e.
10, but are of opposite sign.
5 × equation (1) gives:
35x −10y = 130
(3)
2 × equation (2) gives:
12x + 10y =
58
(4)
Adding equation (3) and (4) gives:
47x + 0
= 188
Hence x = 188
47 = 4
[Note that when the signs of common coefﬁcients are different
the two equations are added, and when the signs of common
coefﬁcients are the same the two equations are subtracted (as
in Problems 1 and 3)]
Substituting x = 4 in equation (1) gives:
7(4) −2y = 26
28 −2y = 26
28 −26 = 2y
2 = 72y
Hence y = 1
Checking, by substituting x = 4 and y = 1 in equation (2), gives:
LHS = 6(4) + 5(1) = 24 + 5 = 29 = RHS
Thus the solution is x = 4, y = 1, since these values maintain
the equality when substituted in both equations.

Checking, by substituting p = −2 and q = −3 into equation (2)

The law connecting friction F and load L for
an experiment is of the form F = aL + b, where a and b
are constants. When F = 5.6, L = 8.0 and when F = 4.4,
L = 2.0. Find the values of a and b and the value of F when
L = 6.5
Substituting F = 5.6, L = 8.0 into F = aL + b gives:
5.6 = 8.0a + b

Substituting F = 4.4, L = 2.0 into F = aL + b gives:

The distance s metres from a ﬁxed point of a
vehicle travelling in a straight line with constant accelera-
tion, a m/s2, is given by s = ut + 1
2at2, where u is the initial
velocity in m/s and t the time in seconds. Determine the ini-
tial velocity and the acceleration given that s = 42 m when
t = 2 s and s = 144 m when t = 4 s. Find also the distance
travelled after 3 s.
Substituting s = 42, t = 2 into s = ut + 1

Problem 16.
A craftsman and 4 labourers together earn
£865 per week, whilst 4 craftsmen and 9 labourers earn
£2340 basic per week. Determine the basic weekly wage of
a craftsman and a labourer.
Let C represent the wage of a craftsman and L that of a labourer.
Thus
C + 4L = 865
(1)
4C + 9L = 2340
(2)
Multiplying equation (1) by 4 gives:
4C + 16L = 3460
(3)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (3) gives:
7L = 1120
L = 1120
7
= 160
Substituting L = 138 into equation (1) gives:
C + 4(160) = 865
C + 640 = 865
C = 865 −640 = 225
Checking, substituting C = 225 and L = 160 into equation (2),
gives:
LHS = 4(225) + 9(160) = 900 + 1440
= 2340 = RHS
Thus the basic weekly wage of a craftsman is £225 and that
of a labourer is £160
Problem 17.
The resistance R of a length of wire at t◦C
is given by R = R0(1 + αt), where R0 is the resistance at
0◦C and α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance in/◦C.
Find the values of α and R0 if R = 30 at 50◦C and R =
35 at 100◦C.
Substituting R = 30, t = 50 into R = R0(1 + αt) gives:
30 = R0(1 + 50α)
(1)
Substituting R = 35, t = 100 into R = R0(1 + αt) gives:
35 = R0(1 + 100α)
(2)
Although these equations may be solved by the conventional sub-
stitution method, an easier way is to eliminate R0 by division.
Thus, dividing equation (1) by equation (2) gives:
30
35 = R0 (1 + 50α)
R0 (1 + 100α) = 1 + 50α
1 + 100α
‘Cross-multiplying’ gives:
30(1 + 100α) = 35(1 + 50α)
30 + 3000α = 35 + 1750α

When c = 172, T = 400, hence

300 = 0.4
Substituting b = 0.4 in equation (1) gives:

Quadratic equations
10.1
Introduction to quadratic
equations
As stated in Chapter 7, an equation is a statement that two quan-
tities are equal and to ‘solve an equation’ means ‘to ﬁnd the
value of the unknown’. The value of the unknown is called the
root of the equation.
A quadratic equation is one in which the highest power of
the unknown quantity is 2. For example, x2 −3x + 1 = 0 is a
quadratic equation.
There are four methods of solving quadratic equations.
These are: (i) by factorization (where possible)
(ii) by ‘completing the square’
(iii) by using the ‘quadratic formula’
or (iv) graphically (see Chapter 13).
10.2
Solution of quadratic equations by
factorization
Multiplying out (2x + 1)(x −3) gives 2x2 −6x + x −3, i.e.
2x2 −5x −3. The reverse process of moving from 2x2 −5x −3
to (2x + 1)(x −3) is called factorizing.
If the quadratic expression can be factorized this provides the
simplest method of solving a quadratic equation.
For example, if 2x2 −5x −3 = 0, then, by factorizing:
(2x + 1)(x −3) = 0
Hence either (2x + 1) = 0
i.e.
x = −1
2
or
(x −3) = 0
i.e.
x = 3
The technique of factorizing is often one of ‘trial and error’.
Problem 1.
Solve the equations (a) x2 + 2x −8 = 0
(b) 3x2 −11x −4 = 0 by factorization.
(a) x2 + 2x −8 = 0. The factors of x2 are x and x. These are
placed in brackets thus: (x
)(x
)
The factors of −8 are +8 and −1, or −8 and +1, or +4
and −2, or −4 and +2. The only combination to give a mid-
dle term of +2x is +4 and −2, i.e.
x2 + 2x −8 = (x + 4)(x −2)
(Note that the product of the two inner terms added to the
product of the two outer terms must equal the middle term,
+2x in this case.)
The quadratic equation x2 + 2x −8 = 0 thus becomes
(x + 4)(x −2) = 0.
Since the only way that this can be true is for either the ﬁrst
or the second, or both factors to be zero, then
either (x + 4) = 0
i.e.
x = −4
or
(x −2) = 0
i.e.
x = 2
Hence the roots of x2 + 2x −8 = 0 are x = −4 and 2
(b) 3x2 −11x −4 = 0
The factors of 3x2 are 3x and x. These are placed in brackets
thus: (3x )(x )
The factors of −4 are −4 and +1, or +4 and −1, or −2
and 2.
Remembering that the product of the two inner terms added
to the product of the two outer terms must equal −11x, the
only combination to give this is +1 and −4, i.e.
3x2 −11x −4 = (3x + 1)(x −4)

70
Basic Engineering Mathematics
The quadratic equation 3x2 −11x −4 = 0 thus becomes
(3x + 1)(x −4) = 0
Hence, either (3x + 1) = 0
i.e.
x = −1

or
(x −4) = 0
i.e.
x = 4
and both solutions may be checked in the original equation.
Problem 2.
Determine the roots of (a) x2 −6x + 9 = 0,
and (b) 4x2 −25 = 0, by factorization.
(a) x2 −6x + 9 = 0. Hence (x −3)(x −3) = 0, i.e. (x −3)2 = 0
(the left-hand side is known as a perfect square). Hence
x = 3 is the only root of the equation x2 −6x + 9 = 0.
(b) 4x2 −25 = 0 (the left-hand side is the difference of two
squares, (2x)2 and (5)2). Thus (2x + 5)(2x −5) = 0
Hence either (2x + 5) = 0
i.e.
x = −5

(2x −5) = 0
i.e.
x = 5

Solve the following quadratic equations by
factorizing: (a) 4x2 + 8x + 3 = 0 (b) 15x2 + 2x −8 = 0.
(a) 4x2 + 8x + 3 = 0. The factors of 4x2 are 4x and x or 2x and
2x.The factors of 3 are 3 and 1, or −3 and −1. Remembering
that the product of the inner terms added to the product of
the two outer terms must equal +8x, the only combination
that is true (by trial and error) is
(4x2 + 8x + 3) = (2x + 3)(2x + 1)
Hence (2x + 3)(2x + 1) = 0 from which, either
(2x + 3) = 0 or (2x + 1) = 0
Thus 2x = −3, from which x = −3
2
or
2x = −1, from which x = −1
2
which may be checked in the original equation.
(b) 15x2 + 2x −8 = 0. The factors of 15x2 are 15x and x or 5x
and 3x.The factors of −8 are −4 and +2, or 4 and −2, or −8
and +1, or 8 and −1. By trial and error the only combination
that works is
15x2 + 2x −8 = (5x + 4)(3x −2)
Hence (5x + 4)(3x −2) = 0 from which
either 5x + 4 = 0

3x −2 = 0
Hence x = −4

The process of rearranging one side of a quadratic equation into a
perfect square before solving is called ‘completing the square’.
(x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2

Practical problems involving
quadratic equations
There are many practical problems where a quadratic equa-
tion has ﬁrst to be obtained, from given information, before it is
solved.
Problem 12.
The area of a rectangle is 23.6 cm2 and its
width is 3.10 cm shorter than its length. Determine the
dimensions of the rectangle, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

74
Basic Engineering Mathematics
Let the length of the rectangle be x cm. Then the width is
(x −3.10) cm.
Area = length × width = x(x −3.10) = 23.6
i.e.
x2 −3.10x −23.6 = 0
Using the quadratic formula,
x = −(−3.10) ±

(−3.10)2 −4(1)(−23.6)
2(1)
= 3.10 ± √9.61 + 94.4
2
= 3.10 ± 10.20
2
= 13.30
2
or −7.10
2
Hence x = 6.65 cm or −3.55 cm. The latter solution is neglected
since length cannot be negative.
Thus length x = 6.65 cm and
width = x −3.10 = 6.65 −3.10 = 3.55 cm.
Hence the dimensions of the rectangle are 6.65 cm by 3.55 cm.
(Check: Area = 6.65 × 3.55 = 23.6 cm2, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.)
Problem 13.
Calculate the diameter of a solid cylinder
which has a height of 82.0 cm and a total surface area of
2.0 m2.
Total surface area of a cylinder
= curved surface area + 2 circular ends
= 2πrh + 2πr2 (where r = radius and h = height)
Since the total surface area = 2.0 m2 and the height h = 82 cm or
0.82 m, then
2.0 = 2πr(0.82) + 2πr2 i.e. 2πr2 + 2πr(0.82) −2.0 = 0
Dividing throughout by 2π gives:
r2 + 0.82r −1

Thus the radius r of the cylinder is 0.2874 m (the negative solu-
tion being neglected).
Hence the diameter of the cylinder

Problem 14.
The height s metres of a mass projected verti-
cally upwards at time t seconds is s = ut −1

how long the mass will take after being projected to reach
a height of 16 m (a) on the ascent and (b) on the descent,
when u = 30 m/s and g = 9.81 m/s2.
When height s = 16 m, 16 = 30 t −1
2(9.81)t2
i.e.
4.905t2 −30t + 16 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
t = −(−30) ±

Hence the mass will reach a height of 16 m after 0.59 s on the
ascent and after 5.53 s on the descent.

the base radius.
If
A = 482.2 and l = 15.3, then 482.2 = πr(15.3) + πr2
i.e.
πr2 + 15.3πr −482.2 = 0

Inequalities

Introduction to inequalities
An inequality is any expression involving one of the symbols <,
>, ≤or ≥
p < q means p is less than q
p > q means p is greater than q
p ≤q means p is less than or equal to q
p ≥q means p is greater than or equal to q
Some simple rules
(i) When a quantity is added or subtracted to both sides of an
inequality, the inequality still remains.
For example, if p < 3
then
p + 2 < 3 + 2 (adding 2 to both sides)
and
p −2 < 3 −2 (subtracting 2 from both sides)
(ii) When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality
by a positive quantity, say 5, the inequality remains the
same. For example,
if p > 4
then
5p > 20
and
p
5 > 4
5
(iii) When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality
by a negative quantity, say −3, the inequality is reversed.
For example,
if p > 1
then
−3p < −3
and
p
−3 <
1
−3
(Note > has changed to < in each example.)
To solve an inequality means ﬁnding all the values of the variable
for which the inequality is true.
Knowledge of simple equations (Chapter 7) and quadratic
equations (Chapter 10) are needed in this chapter.
11.2
Simple inequalities
The solution of some simple inequalities, using only the rules
given in Section 11.1, is demonstrated in the following worked
problems.
Problem 1.
Solve the following inequalities:
(a) 3 + x > 7
(b) 3t < 6
(c) z −2 ≥5
(d) p
3 ≤2
(a) Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality: 3 + x > 7
gives:
3 + x −3 > 7 −3, i.e. x > 4
Hence, all values of x greater than 4 satisfy the inequality.
(b) Dividing both sides of the inequality: 3t < 6 by 3 gives:
3t
3 < 6
3, i.e. t < 2
Hence, all values of t less than 2 satisfy the inequality.
(c) Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality z −2 ≥5 gives:
z −2 + 2 ≥5 + 2, i.e. z ≥7
Hence, all values of z greater than or equal to 7 satisfy the
inequality.
(d) Multiplying both sides of the inequality p
3 ≤2 by 3 gives:
(3)p
3 ≤(3)2, i.e. p ≤6
Hence, all values of p less than or equal to 6 satisfy the
inequality.
Problem 2.
Solve the inequality: 4x + 1 > x + 5

78
Basic Engineering Mathematics
Subtracting 1 from both sides of the inequality: 4x + 1 > x + 5
gives:
4x > x + 4
Subtracting x from both sides of the inequality: 4x > x + 4 gives:
3x > 4
Dividing both sides of the inequality: 3x > 4 by 3 gives:
x > 4
3
Hence all values of x greater than 4
3 satisfy the inequality:
4x + 1 > x + 5
Problem 3.
Solve the inequality: 3 −4t ≤8 + t
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality: 3 −4t ≤8 + t
gives:
−4t ≤5 + t
Subtracting t from both sides of the inequality: −4t ≤5 + t gives:
−5t ≤5
Dividing both sides of the inequality: −5t ≤5 by −5 gives:
t ≥−1 (remembering to reverse the inequality)
Hence, all values of t greater than or equal to −1 satisfy the
inequality.

Inequalities involving a modulus
The modulus of a number is the size of the number, regardless
of sign. Vertical lines enclosing the number denote a modulus.
For example, | 4 | = 4 and | −4 | = 4 (the modulus of a number
is never negative),
The inequality: | t | < 1 means that all numbers whose actual
size, regardless of sign, is less than 1, i.e. any value between −1
and +1.
Thus | t | < 1 means −1 < t < 1.
Similarly, | x | > 3 means all numbers whose actual size, regard-
less of sign, is greater than 3, i.e. any value greater than 3 and
any value less than −3.
Thus | x | > 3 means x > 3 and x < −3.
Inequalities involving a modulus are demonstrated in the follow-
ing worked problems.
Problem 4.
Solve the following inequality: | 3x + 1 | < 4
Since | 3x + 1 | < 4
then
−4 < 3x + 1 < 4
Now −4 < 3x + 1 becomes −5 < 3x,
i.e. −5
3 < x
and
3x + 1 < 4 becomes 3x < 3, i.e. x < 1
Hence, these two results together become −5
3 < x < 1 and mean
that the inequality | 3x + 1 | < 4 is satisﬁed for any value of x
greater than −5
3 but less than 1.
Problem 5.
Solve the inequality: |1 + 2t| ≤5
Since |1 + 2t| ≤5
then
−5 ≤1 + 2t ≤5
Now −5 ≤1 + 2t becomes −6 ≤2t, i.e. −3 ≤t
and
1 + 2t ≤5 becomes 2t ≤4, i.e. t ≤2
Hence, these two results together become: −3 ≤t ≤2
Problem 6.

|3z −4| > 2 means 3z −4 > 2
and
3z −4 < −2,

i.e. the fraction t + 1
3t −6 is positive when t > 2
(ii) If t + 1 < 0 then t < −1 and if 3t −6 < 0 then 3t < 6 and
t < 2
Both of the inequalities t < −1 and t < 2 are only true when
t < −1,

3t −6 is positive when t < −1
Summarizing, t + 1

Problem 8.
Solve the inequality: 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1
Since 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1
then
2x + 3
x + 2 −1 ≤0
i.e. 2x + 3
x + 2 −x + 2
x + 2 ≤0,
i.e. 2x + 3 −(x + 2)
x + 2
≤0
or
x + 1
x + 2 ≤0
For x + 1
x + 2 to be negative or zero,
either
(i) x + 1 ≤0
and
x + 2 > 0
or
(ii) x + 1 ≥0
and
x + 2 < 0
(i) If x + 1 ≤0 then x ≤−1 and if x + 2 > 0 then x > −2
(Note that > is used for the denominator, not ≥; a zero
denominator gives a value for the fraction which is impos-
sible to evaluate.)
Hence, the inequality x + 1
x + 2 ≤0 is true when x is greater than
−2 and less than or equal to −1, which may be written as
−2 < x ≤−1
(ii) If x + 1 ≥0 then x ≥−1 and if x + 2 < 0 then x < −2
It is not possible to satisfy both x ≥−1 and x < −2 thus no
values of x satisﬁes (ii).
Summarizing, 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1
when
−2 < x ≤−1

or
(ii) (t + 3) < 0

Both of these are true only when t > 3
(ii) If (t + 3) < 0 then t < −3 and if (t −3) < 0 then t < 3
Both of these are true only when t < −3

i.e.
z > 1

Problem 12.
Solve the inequality: t2 < 9
Since t2 < 9 then t2 −9 < 0, i.e. (t + 3)(t −3) < 0 by factorizing.
For (t + 3)(t −3) to be negative,
either
(i) (t + 3) > 0
and
(t −3) < 0
or
(ii) (t + 3) < 0
and
(t −3) > 0
(i) If (t + 3) > 0 then t > −3 and if (t −3) < 0 then t < 3
Hence (i) is satisﬁed when t > −3 and t < 3 which may be
written as: −3 < t < 3
(ii) If (t + 3) < 0 then t < −3 and if (t −3) > 0 then t > 3
It is not possible to satisfy both t < −3 and t > 3, thus no
values of t satisﬁes (ii).
Summarizing, t2 < 9 when −3 < t < 3 which means that all
values of t between −3 and +3 will satisfy the inequality.

Quadratic inequalities
Inequalities involving quadratic expressions are solved using
either factorization or ‘completing the square’. For example,
x2 −2x −3 is factorized as (x + 1)(x −3)
and
6x2 + 7x −5 is factorized as (2x −1)(3x + 5)
If a quadratic expression does not factorize, then the technique
of ‘completing the square’ is used. In general, the procedure for
x2 + bx + c is:
x2 + bx + c ≡

x + b
2
2
+ c −
b
2
2
For example, x2 + 4x −7 does not factorize; completing the
square gives:
x2 + 4x −7 ≡(x + 2)2 −7 −22 ≡(x + 2)2 −11
Similarly,
x2 −6x −5 ≡(x −3)2 −5 −32 ≡(x −3)2 −14

Inequalities

Solving quadratic inequalities is demonstrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 15.
Solve the inequality: x2 + 2x −3 > 0
Since x2 + 2x −3 > 0 then (x −1)(x + 3) > 0 by factorizing.
For the product (x −1)(x + 3) to be positive,
either
(i) (x −1) > 0
and
(x + 3) > 0
or
(ii) (x −1) < 0
and
(x + 3) < 0
(i) Since (x −1) > 0 then x > 1 and since (x + 3) > 0 then
x > −3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when x > 1
(ii) Since (x −1) < 0 then x < 1 and since (x + 3) < 0 then
x < −3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when x < −3
Summarizing, x2 + 2x −3 > 0 is satisﬁed when either x > 1 or
x < −3
Problem 16.
Solve the inequality: t2 −2t −8 < 0
Since t2 −2t −8 < 0 then (t −4)(t + 2) < 0 by factorizing.
For the product (t −4)(t + 2) to be negative,
either
(i) (t −4) > 0
and
(t + 2) < 0
or
(ii) (t −4) < 0
and
(t + 2) > 0
(i) Since (t −4) > 0 then t > 4 and since (t + 2) < 0 then t < −2
It is not possible to satisfy both t > 4 and t < −2 , thus no
values of t satisﬁes the inequality (i)
(ii) Since (t −4) < 0 then t < 4 and since (t + 2) > 0 then t > −2
Hence, (ii) is satisﬁed when −2 < t < 4
Summarizing, t2 −2t −8 < 0 is satisﬁed when −2 < t < 4
Problem 17.
Solve the inequality: x2 + 6x + 3 < 0
x2 + 6x + 3 does not factorize; completing the square gives:
x2 + 6x + 3 ≡(x + 3)2 + 3 −32 ≡(x + 3)2 −6
The inequality thus becomes: (x + 3)2 −6 < 0 or (x + 3)2 < 6

y2 −8y −10 does not factorize; completing the square gives:
y2 −8y −10 ≡(y −4)2 −10 −42 ≡(y −4)2 −26
The inequality thus becomes: (y −4)2 −26 ≥0 or (y −4)2 ≥26

Introduction to graphs
A graph is a pictorial representation of information showing
how one quantity varies with another related quantity.
The most common method of showing a relationship between
two sets of data is to use Cartesian or rectangular axes as shown
in Fig. 12.1.

The points on a graph are called co-ordinates. Point A in
Fig. 12.1 has the co-ordinates (3, 2), i.e. 3 units in the x
direction and 2 units in the y direction. Similarly, point B has co-
ordinates (−4, 3) and C has co-ordinates (−3, −2). The origin
has co-ordinates (0, 0).
The horizontal distance of a point from the vertical axis is
called the abscissa and the vertical distance from the horizontal
axis is called the ordinate.
12.2 The straight line graph
Let a relationship between two variables x and y be y = 3x + 2.
When x = 0, y = 3(0) + 2 = 2.
When x = 1, y = 3(1) + 2 = 5.
When x = 2, y = 3(2) + 2 = 8, and so on.
Thus co-ordinates (0, 2), (1, 5) and (2, 8) have been produced
from the equation by selecting arbitrary values of x, and are
shown plotted in Fig. 12.2. When the points are joined together
a straight-line graph results.

The gradient or slope of a straight line is the ratio of the
change in the value of y to the change in the value of x between
any two points on the line. If, as x increases, (→), y also increases
(↑), then the gradient is positive.

Figure 12.3(c) shows a straight line graph y = 3. Since the
straight line is horizontal the gradient is zero.
The value of y when x = 0 is called the y-axis intercept.
In Fig. 12.3(a) the y-axis intercept is 1 and in Fig. 12.3(b) is 2.
If the equation of a graph is of the form y = mx + c, where
m and c are constants, the graph will always be a straight
line, m representing the gradient and c the y-axis intercept. Thus
y = 5x + 2 represents a straight line of gradient 5 and y-axis
intercept 2. Similarly, y = −3x −4 represents a straight line of
gradient −3 and y-axis intercept −4
Summary of general rules to be applied when drawing
graphs
(i) Give the graph a title clearly explaining what is being
illustrated.
(ii) Choose scales such that the graph occupies as much space
as possible on the graph paper being used.
(iii) Choose scales so that interpolation is made as easy as possi-
ble. Usually scales such as 1 cm = 1 unit, or 1 cm = 2 units,
or 1 cm = 10 units are used. Awkward scales such as
1 cm = 3 units or 1 cm = 7 units should not be used.
(iv) The scales need not start at zero, particularly when starting
at zero produces an accumulation of points within a small
area of the graph paper.
(v) The co-ordinates, or points, should be clearly marked. This
may be done either by a cross, or a dot and circle, or just by
a dot (see Fig. 12.1).
(vi) A statement should be made next to each axis explaining the
numbers represented with their appropriate units.
(vii) Sufﬁcient numbers should be written next to each axis
without cramping.
Problem 1.
Plot the graph y = 4x + 3 in the range x = −3
to x = +4. From the graph, ﬁnd (a) the value of y when
x = 2.2, and (b) the value of x when y = −3.
Whenever an equation is given and a graph is required, a table
giving corresponding values of the variable is necessary. The
table is achieved as follows:
When x = −3, y = 4x + 3 = 4(−3) + 3 = −12 + 3 = −9.
When x = −2, y = 4(−2) + 3 = −8 + 3 = −5, and so on.

have to be the same) From the graph:

The co-ordinates are plotted and joined for each graph. The
results are shown in Fig. 12.5. Each of the straight lines pro-
duced are parallel to each other, i.e. the slope or gradient is the
same for each.
To ﬁnd the gradient of any straight line, say, y = x −3 a
horizontal and vertical component needs to be constructed.
In Fig. 12.5, AB is constructed vertically at x = 4 and BC
constructed horizontally at y = −3. The gradient of AC
= AB
BC = 1−(−3)
4 −0
= 4
4 = 1
i.e. the gradient of the straight line y = x −3 is 1. The actual
positioning of AB and BC is unimportant for the gradient is also
given by
DE
EF = −1−(−2)
2 −1

1 = 1
The slope or gradient of each of the straight lines in Fig. 12.5
is thus 1 since they are all parallel to each other.

Each of the graphs is plotted as shown in Fig. 12.6, and each is a

Hence the gradient of both y = 3x and y = 3x + 7 is 3.
y = −4x + 4 and y = −4x −5 are parallel to each other and
thus have the same gradient. The gradient of DF is given by
FE
ED = −5 −( −17)
0 −3
= 12
−3 = −4
Hence the gradient of both y = −4x + 4 and y = −4x −5
is −4.
The y-axis intercept means the value of y where the straight
line cuts the y-axis. From Fig. 12.6,
y = 3x cuts the y-axis at y = 0
y = 3x + 7 cuts the y-axis at y = +7
y = −4x + 4 cuts the y-axis at y = +4
and
y = −4x −5 cuts the y-axis at y = −5
Some general conclusions can be drawn from the graphs shown
in Figs 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6.
When an equation is of the form y = mx + c, where m and c
are constants, then
(i) a graph of y against x produces a straight line,
(ii) m represents the slope or gradient of the line, and
(iii) c represents the y-axis intercept.
Thus, given an equation such as y = 3x + 7, it may be deduced
‘on sight’ that its gradient is +3 and its y-axis intercept is
+7, as shown in Fig. 12.6. Similarly, if y = −4x −5, then the
gradient is −4 and the y-axis intercept is −5, as shown in
Fig. 12.6.
When plotting a graph of the form y = mx + c, only two
co-ordinates need be determined. When the co-ordinates are
plotted a straight line is drawn between the two points. Nor-
mally, three co-ordinates are determined, the third one acting as a
check.
Problem 4.
The following equations represent straight
lines. Determine, without plotting graphs, the gradient and
y-axis intercept for each.
(a) y = 3
(b) y = 2x
(c) y = 5x −1
(d) 2x + 3y = 3
(a) y = 3(whichisoftheformy = 0x + 3)representsahorizontal
straight line intercepting the y-axis at 3. Since the line is
horizontal its gradient is zero.
(b) y = 2x is of the form y = mx + c, where c is zero. Hence
gradient = 2 and y-axis intercept = 0 (i.e. the origin).
(c) y = 5x −1 is of the form y = mx + c. Hence gradient = 5
and y-axis intercept = −1
(d) 2x + 3y = 3 is not in the form y = mx + c as it stands.
Transposing to make y the subject gives 3y = 3 −2x, i.e.
y = 3 −2x
3
= 3
3 −2x

i.e.
y = −2x
3 + 1
which is of the form y = mx + c.
Hence gradient = −2
3 and y-axis intercept = +1
Problem 5.
Without plotting graphs, determine the gradi-
ent and y-axis intercept values of the following equations:
(a) y = 7x −3
(b) 3y = −6x + 2
(c) y −2 = 4x + 9
(d) y
3 = x
3 −1
5
(e) 2x + 9y + 1 = 0
(a) y = 7x −3 is of the form y = mx + c, hence gradient, m = 7
and y-axis intercept, c = −3.

Determine the gradient of the straight line
graph passing through the co-ordinates (a) (−2, 5) and
(3, 4), and (b) (−2, −3) and (−1, 3)

Problem 7.
Plot the graph 3x + y + 1 = 0 and 2y −5 = x
on the same axes and ﬁnd their point of intersection.
Rearranging 3x + y + 1 = 0 gives y = −3x −1
Rearranging 2y −5 = x gives 2y = x + 5 and y = 1

Since both equations are of the form y = mx + c both are
straight lines. Knowing an equation is a straight line means that
only two co-ordinates need to be plotted and a straight line drawn
through them. A third co-ordinate is usually determined to act as
a check.A table of values is produced for each equation as shown
below.

Practical problems involving
straight line graphs
When a set of co-ordinate values are given or are obtained experi-
mentally and it is believed that they follow a law of the form
y = mx + c, then if a straight line can be drawn reasonably close
to most of the co-ordinate values when plotted, this veriﬁes that
a law of the form y = mx + c exists. From the graph, constants
m (i.e. gradient) and c (i.e. y-axis intercept) can be determined.
This technique is called determination of law (see Chapter 16).
Problem 8.
The temperature in degrees Celsius and the
corresponding values in degrees Fahrenheit are shown in the
table below. Construct rectangular axes, choose a suitable
scale and plot a graph of degrees Celsius (on the horizontal
axis) against degrees Fahrenheit (on the vertical scale).

Celsius temperature at 230◦F.
The co-ordinates (10, 50), (20, 68), (40, 104), and so on are
plotted as shown in Fig. 12.9. When the co-ordinates are joined,
a straight line is produced. Since a straight line results there
is a linear relationship between degrees Celsius and degrees
Fahrenheit.

(a) To ﬁnd the Fahrenheit temperature at 55◦C a vertical line
AB is constructed from the horizontal axis to meet the
straight line at B. The point where the horizontal line BD
meets the vertical axis indicates the equivalent Fahrenheit
temperature.
Hence 55◦C is equivalent to 131◦F.
This process of ﬁnding an equivalent value in between the
given information in the above table is called interpolation.
(b) To ﬁnd the Celsius temperature at 167◦F, a horizontal line
EF is constructed as shown in Fig. 12.9. The point where
the vertical line FG cuts the horizontal axis indicates the
equivalent Celsius temperature.
Hence 167◦F is equivalent to 75◦C.
(c) If the graph is assumed to be linear even outside of the given
data, then the graph may be extended at both ends (shown by
broken line in Fig. 12.9).
From Fig. 12.9, 0◦C corresponds to 32◦F.
(d) 230◦F is seen to correspond to 110◦C.
The process of ﬁnding equivalent values outside of the given
range is called extrapolation.

If a graph is plotted with both the scales starting at zero then
the result is as shown in Fig. 12.10. All of the points lie in the
top right-hand corner of the graph, making interpolation difﬁ-
cult. A more accurate graph is obtained if the temperature axis
starts at 55◦C and the volume axis starts at 24.5 m3. The axes
corresponding to these values is shown by the broken lines in
Fig. 12.10 and are called false axes, since the origin is not now
at zero. A magniﬁed version of this relevant part of the graph is

The co-ordinates (0.00007, 4.9), (0.00013, 8.7), and so on, are
plotted as shown in Fig. 12.12. The graph produced is the best
straight line which can be drawn corresponding to these points.
(With experimental results it is unlikely that all the points will
lie exactly on a straight line.) The graph, and each of its axes,
are labelled. Since the straight line passes through the origin,
then stress is directly proportional to strain for the given range
of values.

However, calculations are made easier if the horizontal line

(b) The R-axis intercept is at R = 10 ohms (by extrapolation).
(c) The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, when y is plotted
on the vertical axis and x on the horizontal axis. m represents
the gradient and c the y-axis intercept. In this case, R corres-
ponds to y, V corresponds to x, m = 1.25 and c = 10. Hence
the equation of the graph is R = (1.25 V + 10).

(e) when the resistance is 40 ohms, the voltage is 24V, and

The co-ordinates (70, 8.46), (200, 8.04), and so on, are plotted

When the temperature is 250◦C, stress σ is given by
σ = −0.0032(250) + 8.68 = 7.88 N/cm2
Rearranging σ = −0.0032t + 8.68 gives
0.0032t = 8.68 −σ,

Graphical solution of equations

Graphical solution of simultaneous
equations
Linear simultaneous equations in two unknowns may be solved
graphically by:
(i) plotting the two straight lines on the same axes, and
(ii) noting their point of intersection.
The co-ordinates of the point of intersection give the required
solution.
Problem 1.
Solve graphically the simultaneous equations
2x −y = 4
x + y = 5
Rearranging each equation into y = mx + c form gives:
y = 2x −4

y = −x + 5

Only three co-ordinates need be calculated for each graph since
both are straight lines.

of intersection is at (3, 2) and since this is the only point which
lies simultaneously on both lines then x = 3, y = 2 is the solution
of the simultaneous equations.

equation is x = 2.50, y = −1.20. (It is sometimes useful initially
to sketch the two straight lines to determine the region where
the point of intersection is. Then, for greater accuracy, a graph
having a smaller range of values can be drawn to ‘magnify’ the
point of intersection).

Graphical solutions of quadratic
equations
A general quadratic equation is of the form
y = ax2 + bx + c,
where a, b and c are constants and a is not equal to zero.
A graph of a quadratic equation always produces a shape called
a parabola.
The gradient of the curve between 0 and A and between B and
C in Fig. 13.3 is positive, whilst the gradient between A and B
is negative. Points such as A and B are called turning points.
At A the gradient is zero and, as x increases, the gradient of the
curve changes from positive just before A to negative just after.
Such a point is called a maximum value. At B the gradient is
also zero, and, as x increases, the gradient of the curve changes
from negative just before B to positive just after. Such a point is
called a minimum value.

Quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 may be
solved graphically by:
(i) plotting the graph y = ax2 + bx + c, and
(ii) noting the points of intersection on the x-axis (i.e. where
y = 0).
The x values of the points of intersection give the required
solutions since at these points both y = 0 and
ax2 + bx + c = 0
The number of solutions, or roots of a quadratic equation,
depends on how many times the curve cuts the x-axis and there
can be no real roots (as in Fig. 13.7(a)) or one root (as in Figs 13.4
and 13.5) or two roots (as in Fig. 13.7(b)).

points where y = 4x2 + 4x −15 and y = 0 are the points marked
A and B. This occurs at x = −2.5 and x = 1.5 and these are
the solutions of the quadratic equation 4x2 + 4x −15 = 0. (By
substituting x = −2.5 and x = 1.5 into the original equation the
solutions may be checked.) The curve has a turning point at
(−0.5, −16) and the nature of the point is a minimum.

An alternative graphical method of solving

is to rearrange the equation as 4x2 = −4x + 15 and then plot two
separate graphs – in this case y = 4x2 and y = −4x + 15. Their
points of intersection give the roots of equation
4x2 = −4x + 15,
i.e. 4x2 + 4x −15 = 0.This is shown in Fig. 13.9, where the roots
are x = −2.5 and x = 1.5 as before.

(b) Rearranging 2x2 −x −3 = 0 gives 2x2 = x + 3 and the solu-
tion of this equation is obtained from the points of intersec-

(1)
with
0 = −2x2 + 3x + 2
(2)
shows that if 4 is added to both sides of equation (2),
the right-hand side of both equations will be the same.
Hence 4 = −2x2 + 3x + 6. The solution of this equation
is found from the points of intersection of the line y = 4
and the parabola y = −2x2 + 3x + 6, i.e. points C and D
in Fig. 13.12. Hence the roots of −2x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 are
x = −0.5 and x = 2
(c) −2x2 + 3x + 9 = 0 may be rearranged as
−2x2 + 3x + 6 = −3
and the solution of this equation is obtained from the
points of intersection of the line y = −3 and the parabola
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6x, i.e. at points E and F in Fig. 13.12.
Hence the roots of −2x2 + 3x + 9 = 0 are x = −1.5 and
x = 3
(d) Comparing y = −2x2 + 3x + 6
(3)
with
0 = −2x2 + x + 5
(4)
shows that if 2x + 1 is added to both sides of equation (4) the
right-hand side of both equations will be the same. Hence
equation (4) may be written as
2x + 1 = −2x2 + 3x + 6
The solution of this equation is found from the points
of intersection of the line y = 2x + 1 and the parabola
y = −2x2 + 3x + 6, i.e. points G and H in Fig. 13.12. Hence
the roots of −2x2 + x + 5 = 0 are x = −1.35 and x = 1.85

Logarithms
14.1
Introduction to logarithms
With the use of calculators ﬁrmly established, logarithmic tables
are now rarely used for calculation. However, the theory of
logarithms is important, for there are several scientiﬁc and
engineering laws that involve the rules of logarithms.
If a number y can be written in the form ax, then the index x
is called the ‘logarithm of y to the base of a’,
i.e.
if y = ax
then x = logay
Thus, since 1000 = 103, then 3 = log10 1000
Check this using the ‘log’ button on your calculator.
(a) Logarithms having a base of 10 are called common loga-
rithms and log10 is usually abbreviated to lg. The following
values may be checked by using a calculator:
lg 17.9 = 1.2528 . . . , lg 462.7 = 2.6652 . . .
and lg 0.0173 = −1.7619 …
(b) Logarithms having a base of e (where ‘e’ is a mathematical
constant approximately equal to 2.7183) are called hyper-
bolic, Napierian or natural logarithms, and loge is usually
abbreviated to ln. The following values may be checked by
using a calculator:
ln 3.15 = 1.1474 . . . , ln 362.7 = 5.8935 . . .
and ln 0.156 = −1.8578 …
For more on Napierian logarithms see Chapter 15.
14.2
Laws of logarithms
There are three laws of logarithms, which apply to any
base:
(i) To multiply two numbers:
log(A × B) = log A + log B
The following may be checked by using a calculator:
lg 10 = 1,
also
lg 5 + lg 2 = 0.69897 . . . + 0.301029 . . . = 1
Hence
lg (5 × 2) = lg 10 = lg 5 + lg 2
(ii) To divide two numbers:
log
A
B

= log A −log B
The following may be checked using a calculator:
ln
5
2

= ln 2.5 = 0.91629 . . .
Also
ln 5 −ln 2 = 1.60943 . . . −0.69314 . . .
= 0.91629 . . .
Hence
ln
5
2

= ln 5 −ln 2
(iii) To raise a number to a power:
log An = n log A
The following may be checked using a calculator:
lg 52 = lg 25 = 1.39794 . . .
Also
2 lg 5 = 2 × 0.69897 . . . = 1.39794 . . .
Hence
lg 52 = 2 lg 5
Problem 1.
Evaluate (a) log3 9
(b) log10 10
(c) log16 8

104
Basic Engineering Mathematics
(a) Let x = log3 9 then 3x = 9 from the deﬁnition of a logarithm,
i.e. 3x = 32, from which x = 2.
Hence log3 9 = 2
(b) Let x = log10 10 then 10x = 10 from the deﬁnition of a
logarithm, i.e. 10x = 101, from which x = 1.
Hence log10 10 = 1 (which may be checked by a calculator).
(c) Let x = log16 8 then 16x = 8, from the deﬁnition of a loga-
rithm, i.e. (24)x = 23, i.e. 24x = 23 from the laws of indices,
from which, 4x = 3 and x = 3
4
Hence log16 8 = 3

x = lg 0.001 = log10 0.001
then
10x = 0.001,
i.e.
10x = 10−3, from which x = −3
Hence lg 0.001 = −3 (which may be checked by a
calculator).
(b) Let x = ln e = loge e then ex = e, i.e. ex = e1 from which x = 1
Hence ln e = 1 (which may be checked by a calculator).
(c) Let x = log3
1
81
then 3x = 1
81 = 1
34 = 3−4, from which
x = −4
Hence log3

(a) lg x = 3
(b) log2x = 3

(a) If lg x = 3 then log10 x = 3 and x = 103, i.e. x = 1000
(b) If log2 x = 3 then x = 23 = 8
(c) If log5 x = −2 then x = 5−2 = 1
52 = 1

(b)
log 450 = log(2 × 225) = log(2 × 3 × 75)

2 log(x + 2) = log(x + 2)2 = log(x2 + 4x + 4)

Indicial equations
The laws of logarithms may be used to solve certain equations
involving powers – called indicial equations. For example, to
solve, say, 3x = 27, logarithms to a base of 10 are taken of
both sides,
i.e.
log10 3x = log10 27
and
x log10 3 = log10 27 by the third law of logarithms.
Rearranging gives x = log10 27
log10 3 = 1.43136 . . .
0.4771 . . . = 3 which may
be readily checked.
(Note, (log 8/ log 2) is not equal to lg(8/2))
Problem 9.
Solve the equation 2x = 3, correct to 4 signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures.
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides of 2x = 3 gives:
log10 2x = log10 3
i.e.
x log10 2 = log10 3
Rearranging gives:
x = log10 3
log10 2 = 0.47712125 . . .
0.30102999 . . . = 1.585
correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Problem 10.
Solve the equation 2x + 1 = 32x −5 correct to
2 decimal places.
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:
log10 2x + 1 = log10 32x −5
i.e.
(x + 1) log10 2 = (2x −5) log10 3
x log10 2 + log10 2 = 2x log10 3 −5 log10 3
x(0.3010) + (0.3010) = 2x(0.4771) −5(0.4771)
i.e.
0.3010x + 0.3010 = 0.9542x −2.3855
Hence
2.3855 + 0.3010 = 0.9542x −0.3010x
2.6865 = 0.6532x
from which x = 2.6865
0.6532 = 4.11
correct to 2 decimal places.
Problem 11.
Solve the equation x3.2 = 41.15, correct to 4
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:
log10 x3.2 = log10 41.15
3.2 log10 x = log10 41.15
Hence
log10 x = log10 41.15
3.2
= 0.50449
Thus x = antilog 0.50449 = 100.50449 = 3.195 correct to 4 signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures.

Graphs of logarithmic functions
A graph of y = log10 x is shown in Fig. 14.1 and a graph of
y = loge x is shown in Fig. 14.2. Both are seen to be of simi-
lar shape; in fact, the same general shape occurs for a logarithm
to any base.
In general, with a logarithm to any base a, it is noted that:
(i) loga 1 = 0
Letloga = x,thenax = 1fromthedeﬁnitionofthelogarithm.
If ax = 1 then x = 0 from the laws of logarithms.

(ii) loga a = 1
Let loga a = x then ax = a from the deﬁnition of a logarithm.
If ax = a then x = 1
Hence loga a = 1. (Check with a calculator that log10 10 = 1
and loge e = 1)
(iii) loga 0 →−∞
Let loga 0 = x then ax = 0 from the deﬁnition of a logarithm.
If ax = 0, and a is a positive real number, then x must
approach minus inﬁnity. (For example, check with a calcula-
tor, 2−2 = 0.25, 2−20 = 9.54 × 10−7, 2−200 = 6.22 × 10−61,
and so on.)
Hence loga 0 →−∞

Exponential functions
15.1 The exponential function
An exponential function is one which contains ex, e being a
constant called the exponent and having an approximate value of
2.7183. The exponent arises from the natural laws of growth and
decay and is used as a base for natural or Napierian logarithms.
15.2
Evaluating exponential functions
The value of ex may be determined by using:
(a) a calculator, or
(b) the power series for ex (see Section 15.3), or
(c) tables of exponential functions.
The most common method of evaluating an exponential func-
tion is by using a scientiﬁc notation calculator, this now having
replaced the use of tables. Most scientiﬁc notation calculators
contain an ex function which enables all practical values of ex
and e−x to be determined, correct to 8 or 9 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
For example:
e1 = 2.7182818
e2.4 = 11.023176
e−1.618 = 0.19829489
correct to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
In practical situations the degree of accuracy given by a cal-
culator is often far greater than is appropriate. The accepted
convention is that the ﬁnal result is stated to one signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ure greater than the least signiﬁcant measured value. Use your
calculator to check the following values:
e0.12 = 1.1275, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
e−1.47 = 0.22993, correct to 5 decimal places
e−0.431 = 0.6499, correct to 4 decimal places
e9.32 = 11 159, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
e−2.785 = 0.0617291, correct to 7 decimal places

15.3 The power series for ex
The value of ex can be calculated to any required degree of accu-
racy since it is deﬁned in terms of the following power series:
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4! + · · ·
(1)
(where 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 and is called ‘factorial 3’)
The series is valid for all values of x.
The series is said to converge, i.e. if all the terms are added,
an actual value for ex (where x is a real number) is obtained. The
more terms that are taken, the closer will be the value of ex to
its actual value. The value of the exponent e, correct to say 4
decimal places, may be determined by substituting x = 1 in the
power series of equation (1). Thus
e1 = 1 + 1 + (1)2
2! + (1)3
3! + (1)4
4! + (1)5
5! + (1)6
6!
+(1)7
7! + (1)8
8! + · · ·
= 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.16667 + 0.04167 + 0.00833
+0.00139 + 0.00020 + 0.00002 + · · ·
= 2.71828
i.e.
e = 2.7183 correct to 4 decimal places
The value of e0.05, correct to say 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, is found by
substituting x = 0.05 in the power series for ex. Thus
e0.05 = 1 + 0.05 + (0.05)2
2!
+ (0.05)3
3!
+ (0.05)4
4!
+ (0.05)5
5!
+ · · ·
= 1 + 0.05 + 0.00125 + 0.000020833
+ 0.000000260 + 0.000000003
and by adding,
e0.05 = 1.0512711, correct to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
In this example, successive terms in the series grow smaller very
rapidly and it is relatively easy to determine the value of e0.05 to
a high degree of accuracy. However, when x is nearer to unity or
larger than unity, a very large number of terms are required for
an accurate result.

i.e.

Hence 5e0.5 = 5(1.64872) = 8.2436, correct to 5 signiﬁcant

Napierian logarithms
Logarithms having a base of e are called hyperbolic, Napierian
or natural logarithms and the Napierian logarithm of x is written
as loge x, or more commonly, ln x.
15.6
Evaluating Napierian logarithms
The value of a Napierian logarithm may be determined by using:
(a) a calculator, or
(b) a relationship between common and Napierian logarithms, or
(c) Napierian logarithm tables.
The most common method of evaluating a Napierian logarithm
is by a scientiﬁc notation calculator, this now having replaced
the use of four-ﬁgure tables, and also the relationship between
common and Napierian logarithms,
loge y = 2.3026 log10 y
Most scientiﬁc notation calculators contain a ‘ln x’ function
which displays the value of the Napierian logarithm of a number
when the appropriate key is pressed.
Using a calculator,
ln 4.692 = 1.5458589 … = 1.5459,
correct to 4 decimal places
and
ln 35.78 = 3.57738907 … = 3.5774,
correct to 4 decimal places
Use your calculator to check the following values:
ln 1.732 = 0.54928, correct to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures

ln 0.52 = −0.6539, correct to 4 decimal places

ln e3 = 3

sides, which gives
ln e3x = ln 8

Reduction of non-linear laws to linear form
16.1
Determination of law
Frequently, the relationship between two variables, say x and y,
is not a linear one, i.e. when x is plotted against y a curve results.
In such cases the non-linear equation may be modiﬁed to the
linear form, y = mx + c, so that the constants, and thus the law
relating the variables can be determined. This technique is called
‘determination of law’.
Some examples of the reduction of equations to linear form
include:
(i) y = ax2 + b compares with Y = mX + c, where m = a, c = b
and X = x2.
Hence y is plotted vertically against x2 horizontally to
produce a straight line graph of gradient ‘a’ and y-axis
intercept ‘b’
(ii) y = a
x + b
y is plotted vertically against 1
x horizontally to produce a
straight line graph of gradient ‘a’ and y-axis intercept ‘b’
(iii) y = ax2 + bx
Dividing both sides by x gives y
x = ax + b.
Comparing with Y = mX + c shows that y
x is plotted verti-
cally against x horizontally to produce a straight line graph
of gradient ‘a’ and y
x axis intercept ‘b’

Logarithmic scales
Graph paper is available where the scale markings along the hori-
zontal and vertical axes are proportional to the logarithms of the
numbers. Such graph paper is called log–log graph paper.

A logarithmic scale is shown in Fig. 17.1 where the dis-
tance between, say 1 and 2, is proportional to lg 2 −lg 1, i.e.
0.3010 of the total distance from 1 to 10. Similarly, the distance
between 7 and 8 is proportional to lg 8 −lg 7, i.e. 0.05799 of the
total distance from 1 to 10. Thus the distance between markings
progressively decreases as the numbers increase from 1 to 10.
With log–log graph paper the scale markings are from 1 to
9, and this pattern can be repeated several times. The number
of times the pattern of markings is repeated on an axis signiﬁes
the number of cycles. When the vertical axis has, say, 3 sets of
values from 1 to 9, and the horizontal axis has, say, 2 sets of
values from 1 to 9, then this log–log graph paper is called ‘log 3
cycle × 2 cycle’(see Fig. 17.2). Many different arrangements are
available ranging from ‘log 1 cycle × 1 cycle’ through to ‘log 5
cycle × 5 cycle’.
To depict a set of values, say, from 0.4 to 161, on an axis of
log–log graph paper, 4 cycles are required, from 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10,
10 to 100 and 100 to 1000.

Graphs of the form y = axn
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of y = axn
gives:
lg y = lg(axn)
= lg a + lg xn
i.e.
lg y = n lg x + lg a
which compares with
Y = mX + c
Thus,byplottinglg y verticallyagainstlg x horizontally,astraight
line results, i.e. the equation y = axn is reduced to linear form.
With log–log graph paper available x and y may be plotted
directly, without having ﬁrst to determine their logarithms,
as shown in Chapter 16.

The law relating x and y is believed to be y = axb, where a
and b are constants.Verify that this law is true and determine
the approximate values of a and b.
If y = axb then lg y = b lg x + lg a, from above, which is of the
form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight line graph
lg y is plotted vertically against lg x horizontally. x and y may be
plotted directly on to log–log graph paper as shown in Fig. 17.2.
The values of y range from 0.45 to 82.46 and 3 cycles are
needed (i.e. 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10 and 10 to 100). The values of x
range from 0.41 to 3.95 and 2 cycles are needed (i.e. 0.1 to 1
and 1 to 10). Hence ‘log 3 cycle × 2 cycle’ is used as shown
in Fig. 17.2 where the axes are marked and the points plot-
ted. Since the points lie on a straight line the law y = axb is
veriﬁed.
To evaluate constants a and b:
Method 1. Any two points on the straight line, say points A
and C, are selected, and AB and BC are measured (say in
centimetres).
Then, gradient, b = AB
BC = 11.5 units
5 units
= 2.3
Since lg y = b lg x + lg a, when x = 1, lg x = 0 and lg y = lg a.
The straight line crosses the ordinate x = 1.0 at y = 3.5.
Hence lg a = lg 3.5, i.e. a = 3.5
Method 2. Any two points on the straight line, say points A
and C, are selected. A has coordinates (2, 17.25) and C has
coordinates (0.5, 0.7).
Since
y = axb then 17.25 = a(2)b
(1)
and
0.7 = a(0.5)b
(2)
i.e. two simultaneous equations are produced and may be solved
for a and b.
Dividing equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate a gives:
17.25
0.7
= (2)b
(0.5)b =
 2
0.5
b
i.e.
24.643 = (4)b
Taking logarithms of both sides gives
lg 24.643 = b lg 4, i.e.
b = lg 24.643
lg 4
= 2.3, correct to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Substituting b = 2.3 in equation (1) gives:
17.25 = a(2)2.3, i.e.
a = 17.25
(2)2.3 = 17.25
4.925
= 3.5, correct to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Hence the law of the graph is: y = 3.5x2.3

Prove that the law relating current and power is of the form
P = RI n, where R and n are constants, and determine the law.
Hence calculate the power when the current is 12 amperes
and the current when the power is 1000 watts.
Since P = RI n then lg P = nlg l + lg R, which is of the form
Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight line graph lg P is
plotted vertically against lg I horizontally. Power values range
from 49 to 4290, hence 3 cycles of log–log graph paper are
needed (10 to 100, 100 to 1000 and 1000 to 10 000). Current
values range from 1.4 to 11.2, hence 2 cycles of log–log
graph paper are needed (1 to 10 and 10 to 100). Thus
‘log 3 cycles × 2 cycles’ is used as shown in Fig. 17.3 (or, if
not available, graph paper having a larger number of cycles
per axis can be used). The co-ordinates are plotted and a
straight line results which proves that the law relating cur-
rent and power is of the form P = RI n. Gradient of straight
line,
n = AB
BC = 14 units
7 units = 2
At point C, I = 2 and P = 100. Substituting these values into
P = RI n gives: 100 = R(2)2. Hence R = 100/(2)2 = 25 which
may have been found from the intercept on the I = 1.0 axis in
Fig. 17.3.

Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight line graph lg
p is plotted vertically against lg v horizontally. The co-ordinates
are plotted on ‘log 3 cycle × 2 cycle’ graph paper as shown in
Fig. 17.4. With the data expressed in standard form, the axes are

Graphs of the form y = abx
Taking logarithms to a base of 10 of both sides of y = abx gives:
lg y = lg(abx) = lg a + lg bx = lg a + xlg b
i.e.
lg y = (lg b)x + lg a
which compares with
Y = mX + c
Thus, by plotting lg y vertically against x horizontally a straight
line results, i.e. the graph y = abx is reduced to linear form. In
this case, graph paper having a linear horizontal scale and a log-
arithmic vertical scale may be used. This type of graph paper is
called log–linear graph paper, and is speciﬁed by the number of
cycles on the logarithmic scale. For example, graph paper having
3 cycles on the logarithmic scale is called ‘log 3 cycle × linear’
graph paper.

Since y = abx then lg y = (lg b) x + lg a (from above), which is
of the form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight line
graph lg y is plotted vertically against x horizontally. Using log–
linear graph paper, values of x are marked on the horizontal scale
to cover the range 0.7 to 4.3. Values of y range from 18.4 to 1850
and 3 cycles are needed (i.e. 10 to 100, 100 to 1000 and 1000 to

Point A has coordinates (3.82, 1000).
Substituting these values into y = abx gives:

a =

(3.6)3.82

Hence the law of the graph is: y = 7.5(3.6)x
(i) When x = 2.5, y = 7.5(3.6)2.5 = 184
(ii) When y = 1200, 1200 = 7.5(3.6)x, hence
(3.6)x = 1200

Graphs of the form y = aekx
Taking logarithms to a base of e of both sides of y = aekx
gives:
ln y = ln(aekx) = ln a + ln ekx = ln a + kx ln e
i.e.
ln y = kx + ln a (since ln e = 1)
which compares with Y = mX + c
Thus, by plotting ln y vertically against x horizontally, a straight
line results, i.e. the equation y = aekx is reduced to linear form.
In this case,. graph paper having a linear horizontal scale and a
logarithmic vertical scale may be used.
Problem 5.
The data given below is believed to be realted
by a law of the form y = aekx, where a and b are constants.
Verify that the law is true and determine approximate values
of a and b. Also determine the value of y when x is 3.8 and
the value of x when y is 85.

Since y = aekx then ln y = kx + ln a (from above), which is of the
form Y = mX + c, showing that to produce a straight line graph
ln y is plotted vertically against x horizontally. The value of y
ranges from 9.3 to 332 hence ‘log 3 cycle × linear’ graph paper
is used.The ploted co-ordinates are shown in Fig. 17.6 and since a
straight line passes through the points the law y = aekx is veriﬁed.
Gradient of straight line,

BC = ln 100 −ln 10
3.12 −(−1.08) = 2.3026

= 0.55, correct to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since ln y = kx + ln a, when x = 0, ln y = ln a, i.e. y = a.
The vertical axis intercept value at x = 0 is 18, hence a = 18.
The law of the graph is thus: y = 18e0.55x
When x is 3.8,
y = 18e0.55(3.8) = 18e2.09 = 18(8.0849) = 146
When y is 85, 85 = 18e0.55x
Hence, e0.55x = 85
18 = 4.7222
and 0.55x = ln 4.7222 = 1.5523.
Hence x = 1.5523

Since the straight line does not cross the vertical axis at t = 0
in Fig. 17.7, the value of V is determined by selecting any point,
say A, having co-ordinates (36.5, 100) and substituting these
values into v = Vet/T. Thus
100 = Ve36.5/−12.0
i.e
V =

e−36.5/12.0 = 2090 volts.
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Hence the law of graph is: υ = 2090e−t/12.0
When time t = 25 ms, voltage υ = 2090e−25/12.0
= 260 V.
When the voltage is 30.0 volts, 30.0 = 2090e−t/12.0, hence
e−t/12.0 = 30.0
2090
and
et/12.0 = 2090
30.0 = 69.67
Taking Napierian logarithms gives:

12.0 = ln 69.67 = 4.2438
from which, time t = (12.0)(4.2438) = 50.9 ms.

Angular measurement
Geometry is a part of mathematics in which the properties of
points, lines, surfaces and solids are investigated.
An angle is the amount of rotation between two straight lines.
Angles may be measured in either degrees or radians (see
Section 23.3).
1 revolution = 360 degrees, thus 1 degree =
1
360th of one revo-
lution. Also 1 minute = 1
60th of a degree and 1 second = 1
60th
of a minute. 1 minute is written as 1′ and 1 second is written as 1′′
Thus 1◦= 60′ and 1′ = 60′′
Problem 1.
Add 14◦53′ and 37◦19′
14◦53′
37◦19′
52◦12′
1◦
53′ + 19′ = 72′. Since 60′ = 1◦, 72′ = 1◦12′. Thus the 12′ is
placed in the minutes column and 1◦is carried in the degrees
column.
Then 14◦+ 37◦+ 1◦(carried) = 52◦
Thus
14◦53′ + 37◦19′ = 52◦12′

the degrees column, which leaves 27◦in that column. Now
(60′ + 13′) −47′ = 26′, which is placed in the minutes column.
27◦−15◦= 12◦, which is placed in the degrees column.
Thus 28◦13′ −15◦47′ = 12◦26′

Hence XZ = YZ
Triangles PRZ
and QRZ
are congruent since PR = RQ,
∠RPZ = ∠RQZ and PZ = ZQ (SAS). Hence ∠RZX = ∠RZY
Triangles RXZ and RYZ are congruent since ∠RXZ = ∠RYZ,
XZ = YZ and ∠RZX = ∠RZY (ASA). ∠QRZ = 67◦and thus
∠PRQ = 67◦+ 67◦= 134◦. Hence
∠RPZ = ∠RQZ = 180◦−134◦
2
= 23◦
∠RXZ = 23◦+ 28◦= 51◦(external angle of a triangle equals the
sum of the two interior opposite angles).

Introduction to trigonometry
19.1 Trigonometry
Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics which deals with the
measurement of sides and angles of triangles, and their relation-
ship with each other. There are many applications in engineering
where a knowledge of trigonometry is needed.
19.2 The theorem of Pythagoras
With reference to Fig. 19.1, the side opposite the right angle (i.e.
side b) is called the hypotenuse. The theorem of Pythagoras
states:
‘In any right-angled triangle, the square on the hypotenuse is
equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.’
Hence
b2 = a2 + c2

given
∠X = 90◦,
∠Y = 23◦17′ and YZ = 20.0 mm. Determine also its area.
It is always advisable to make a reasonably accurate sketch so
as to visualize the expected magnitudes of unknown sides and
angles. Such a sketch is shown in Fig. 19.17.
∠Z = 180◦−90◦−23◦17′ = 66◦43′

(Note, ∠PRQ is also φ – alternate angles between parallel

The angle of depression of a ship viewed at a
particular instant from the top of a 75 m vertical cliff is 30◦.
Find the distance of the ship from the base of the cliff at this

of the cliff is 20◦. Determine the speed of the ship in km/h.
Figure 19.25 shows the cliff AB, the initial position of the ship

Evaluating trigonometric ratios of
any angles
Four-ﬁgure tables are available which gives sines, cosines, and
tangents, for angles between 0◦and 90◦. However, the easiest
method of evaluating trigonometric functions of any angle is by
using a calculator.
The following values, correct to 4 decimal places, may be
checked:
sine 18◦= 0.3090
cosine 56◦= 0.5592
tangent 29◦= 0.5543
sine 172◦= 0.1392
cosine 115◦= −0.4226
tangent 178◦= −0.0349
sine 241.63◦= −0.8799
cosine 331.78◦= 0.8811
tangent 296.42◦= −2.0127

Introduction to trigonometry

To evaluate, say, sine 42◦23′ using a calculator means ﬁnding
sine 4223◦
60 since there are 60 minutes in 1 degree.
23
60 = 0.383˙3,
thus 42◦23′ = 42.383˙3◦
Thus sine 42◦23′ = sine 42.3833◦= 0.6741, correct to 4 decimal
places.
Similarly, cosine 72◦38′ = cosine 7238◦
60 = 0.2985, correct to 4

Evaluate, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures:
(a) sin 1.481
(b) cos(3π/5)
(c) tan 2.93
(a) sin 1.481 means the sine of 1.481 radians. Hence a calculator
needs to be on the radian function.
Hence sin 1.481 = 0.9960
(b) cos(3π/5) = cos 1.884955 . . . = −0.3090
(c) tan 2.93 = −0.2148
Problem 19.
Determine the acute angles:
(a) sin −1 0.7321
(b) cos −1 0.4174
(c) tan −1 1.4695
(a) sin−1 θ is an abbreviation for ‘the angle whose sine is
equal to θ’. 0.7321 is entered into a calculator and
then the inverse sine (or sin−1) key is pressed. Hence
sin−1 0.7321 = 47.06273 . . .◦.
Subtracting 47 leaves 0.06273 . . . ◦and multiplying this by
60 gives 4′ to the nearest minute.
Hence sin−1 0.7321 = 47.06◦or 47◦4′
Alternatively, in radians, sin−1 0.7321 = 0.821 radians.
(b) cos−1 0.4174 = 65.33◦or 65◦20′ or 1.140 radians.
(c) tan −1 1.4695 = 55.76◦or 55◦46′ or 0.973 radians.

where θ = 180◦−19.03◦= 160.97◦. Thus 19.03◦and 160.97◦

20.3 The production of a sine and
cosine wave
In Fig. 20.11, let OR be a vector 1 unit long and free to rotate
anticlockwise about O. In one revolution a circle is produced
and is shown with 15◦sectors. Each radius arm has a vertical
and a horizontal component. For example, at 30◦, the vertical
component is TS and the horizontal component is OS.
From trigonometric ratios,
sin 30◦= TS
TO = TS
1 ,
i.e.
TS = sin 30◦
and cos 30◦= OS
TO = OS
1 ,
i.e.
OS = cos 30◦
The vertical component TS may be projected across to T ′S′,
which is the corresponding value of 30◦on the graph of y against
angle x◦. If all such vertical components as TS are projected
on to the graph, then a sine wave is produced as shown in
Fig. 20.11.
If all horizontal components such as OS are projected on to
a graph of y against angle x◦, then a cosine wave is produced.
It is easier to visualize these projections by redrawing the circle
with the radius arm OR initially in a vertical position as shown
in Fig. 20.12.
From Figs. 20.11 and 20.12 it is seen that a cosine curve is
of the same form as the sine curve but is displaced by 90◦(or
π/2 radians).

every 180◦(or π radians); thus 180◦is the period of these
waveforms.
(iii) Ingeneral,ify = sin pAory = cos pA(wherepisaconstant)

Hence if y = sin 3A then the period is 360/3, i.e. 120◦, and
if y = cos 4A then the period is 360/4, i.e. 90◦
Amplitude
Amplitude is the name given to the maximum or peak value of
a sine wave. Each of the graphs shown in Figs. 20.13 to 20.16
has an amplitude of +1 (i.e. they oscillate between +1 and −1).
However, if y = 4 sin A, each of the values in the table is multi-
plied by 4 and the maximum value, and thus amplitude, is 4.
Similarly, if y = 5 cos 2A, the amplitude is 5 and the period is
360◦/2, i.e. 180◦

this a periodic function is represented by y = sin(A ± α) or
y = cos(A ± α) where α is a phase displacement compared
with y = sin A or y = cos A.
(ii) By drawing up a table of values, a graph of y = sin(A −60◦)
may be plotted as shown in Fig. 20.21. If y = sin A is
assumed to start at 0◦then y = sin(A −60◦) starts 60◦later
(i.e. has a zero value 60◦later).Thus y = sin(A −60◦) is said
to lag y = sin A by 60◦

Sinusoidal form A sin(ωt ± α)
In Fig. 20.26, let OR represent a vector that is free to rotate anti-
clockwise about O at a velocity of ω rad/s. A rotating vector is
called a phasor. After a time t seconds OR will have turned
through an angle ωt radians (shown as angle TOR in Fig. 20.26).
If ST is constructed perpendicular to OR, then sin ωt = ST/OT,
i.e. ST = OT sin ωt.
If all such vertical components are projected on to a graph of
y against ωt, a sine wave results of amplitude OR (as shown in
Section 20.3).
If phasor OR makes one revolution (i.e. 2π radians) in T
seconds, then the angular velocity, ω = 2π/T rad/s,
from which,
T = 2π/ω seconds
T is known as the periodic time.
The number of complete cycles occurring per second is called
the frequency, f
Frequency = number of cycles
second
= 1
T = ω
2π Hz
i.e.
f = ω
2π Hz
Hence angular velocity,
ω = 2πf rad/s
Amplitude is the name given to the maximum or peak value of
a sine wave, as explained in Section 20.4. The amplitude of the
sine wave shown in Fig. 20.26 has an amplitude of 1.
A sine or cosine wave may not always start at 0◦. To show
this a periodic function is represented by y = sin(ωt ± α) or
y = cos(ωt ± α), where α is a phase displacement compared
with y = sin A or y = cos A. A graph of y = sin(ωt −α) lags
y = sin ωt by angle α, and a graph of y = sin(ωt + α) leads
y = sin ωt by angle α.
The angle ωt is measured in radians
i.e.

ω rad
s

(t s) = ωt radians
hence angle α should also be in radians.
The relationship between degrees and radians is:

An oscillating mechanism has a maximum
displacement of 2.5 m and a frequency of 60 Hz. At time
t = 0 the displacement is 90 cm. Express the displacement
in the general form A sin (ωt ± α).
Amplitude = maximum displacement = 2.5 m
Angular velocity, ω = 2πf = 2π(60) = 120π rad/s
Hence displacement = 2.5 sin(120πt + α) m
When t = 0, displacement = 90 cm = 0.90 m
Hence 0.90 = 2.5 sin(0 + α)
i.e.
sin α = 0.90
2.5 = 0.36
Hence α = sin−1 0.36 = 21.10◦= 21◦6′ = 0.368 rad
Thus displacement = 2.5 sin(120πt + 0.368) m

Cartesian and polar co-ordinates
21.1
Introduction
There are two ways in which the position of a point in a plane
can be represented. These are
(a) by Cartesian co-ordinates, i.e. (x, y), and
(b) by polar co-ordinates, i.e. (r, θ), where r is a ‘radius’ from
a ﬁxed point and θ is an angle from a ﬁxed point.
21.2
Changing from Cartesian into polar
co-ordinates
In Fig. 21.1, if lengths x and y are known, then the length of r
can be obtained from Pythagoras’theorem (see Chapter 19) since
OPQ is a right-angled triangle.
Hence
r2 = (x2 + y2)
from which,
r =

x2 + y2 and θ = tan−1 y
x are the two formulae we need
to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates. The angle θ,
which may be expressed in degrees or radians, must always be
measuredfromthepositivex-axis,i.e.measuredfromthelineOQ
in Fig. 21.1. It is suggested that when changing from Cartesian
to polar co-ordinates a diagram should always be sketched.
Problem 1.
Change the Cartesian co-ordinates (3, 4) into
polar co-ordinates.
A diagram representing the point (3, 4) is shown in Fig. 21.2.

no meaning in this context).
By trigonometric ratios, θ = tan−1 4
3 = 53.13◦or 0.927 rad. [note
that 53.13◦= 53.13 × (π/180) rad = 0.927 rad.]
Hence (3, 4) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to
(5, 53.13◦) or (5, 0.927 rad) in polar co-ordinates.

By trigonometric ratios, α = tan−1 3
4 = 36.87◦or 0.644 rad.
Hence
θ = 180◦−36.87◦= 143.13◦
or
θ = π −0.644 = 2.498 rad
Hence the position of point P in polar co-ordinate form is
(5, 143.13◦) or (5, 2.498 rad)
Problem 3.
Express (−5, −12) in polar co-ordinates.
A sketch showing the position (−5, −12) is shown in Fig. 21.4.
r =

52 + 122 = 13
and
α = tan−1 12
5 = 67.38◦
or
1.176 rad
Hence
θ = 180◦+ 67.38◦= 247.38◦
or
θ = π + 1.176 = 4.318 rad
Thus (−5, −12) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to
(13, 247.38◦) or (13, 4.318 rad) in polar co-ordinates.
Problem 4.
Express (2, −5) in polar co-ordinates.
A sketch showing the position (2, −5) is shown in Fig. 21.5.
r =

22 + 52 =

29 = 5.385
correct to 3 decimal places
α = tan−1 5
2 = 68.20◦
or
1.190 rad
Hence θ = 360◦−68.20◦= 291.80◦
or
θ = 2π −1.190 = 5.093 rad
Thus (2, −5) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds to
(5.385, 291.80◦) or (5.385, 5.093 rad) in polar co-ordinates.

A sketch showing the position (4, 32◦) is shown in Fig. 21.7.

Thus
(6, 137◦)

to
(−4.388, 4.092) in Cartesian co-ordinates.
(Note that when changing from polar to Cartesian co-ordinates it
is not quite so essential to draw a sketch. Use of x = r cos θ and
y = r sin θ automatically produces the correct signs.)
Problem 7.
Express (4.5, 5.16 rad) in Cartesian
co-ordinates
A sketch showing the position (4.5, 5.16 rad) is shown in
Fig. 21.9.
x = r cos θ = 4.5 cos 5.16 = 1.948
which corresponds to length OA in Fig. 21.9.

Thus (1.948, −4.057) in Cartesian co-ordinates corresponds
to (4.5, 5.16 rad) in polar co-ordinates.

Use of R →P and P →R functions
on calculators
Another name for Cartesian co-ordinates is rectangular
co-ordinates. Many scientiﬁc notation calculators possess R →P
and P →R functions. The R is the ﬁrst letter of the word rect-
angular and the P is the ﬁrst letter of the word polar. Check the
operation manual for your particular calculator to determine how
to use these two functions. They make changing from Cartesian
to polar co-ordinates, and vice-versa, so much quicker and easier.

In triangle FGH, 40◦+ 90◦+ b = 180◦(angles in a triangle
add up to 180◦) from which, b = 50◦. Also c = 40◦(alternate
angles between parallel lines EF and HG).
(Alternatively, b and c are complementary, i.e. add up to 90◦)
d = 90◦+ c (external angle of a triangle equals the sum of
the interior opposite angles), hence
d = 90◦+ 40◦= 130◦

(iii) JKLM is a rhombus
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the interior angles and
opposite internal angles are equal.

In triangle KLM, 30◦+ ∠KLM + 30◦= 180◦(angles in a

The diagonal JL bisects ∠KLM, hence

(iv) NOPQ is a parallelogram
g = 52◦(since opposite interior angles of a parallelogram

h = 180◦−65◦−52◦= 63◦
i = 65◦(alternate angles between parallel lines NQ and OP).
j = 52◦+ i = 52◦+ 65◦= 117◦(external angle of a triangle
equals the sum of the interior opposite angles).
(v) RSTU is a trapezium
35◦+ k = 75◦(external angle of a triangle equals the sum
of the interior opposite angles), hence k = 40◦
∠STR = 35◦(alternate angles between parallel lines RU and
ST).
l + 35◦= 115◦(external angle of a triangle equals the sum
of the interior opposite angles), hence
l = 115◦−35◦= 80◦

Area of HIJK = 1

Since MC = 7 m then LG = 7 m, hence

2(3 + 1.8)(0.8) = 1.92 m2
Total ﬂoor area = 3.897 + 9.817 + 35 + 2.4 −1.92 = 49.194 m2
To allow for 30% wastage, amount of carpet required =
1.3 × 49.194 = 63.95 m2

The circle
23.1
Introduction
A circle is a plain ﬁgure enclosed by a curved line, every point
on which is equidistant from a point within, called the centre.
23.2
Properties of circles
(i) The distance from the centre to the curve is called the
radius, r, of the circle (see OP in Fig. 23.1).
P
R
C
B
A
O
Q
Fig. 23.1
(ii) The boundary of a circle is called the circumference, c.
(iii) Any straight line passing through the centre and touching
the circumference at each end is called the diameter, d
(see QR in Fig. 23.1). Thus d = 2r
(iv) The ratio circumference
diameter
= a constant for any circle.
This constant is denoted by the Greek letter π (pronounced
‘pie’), where π = 3.14159, correct to 5 decimal places.
Hence c/d = π or c = πd or c = 2πr
(v) A semicircle is one half of the whole circle.
(vi) A quadrant is one quarter of a whole circle.
(vii) A tangent to a circle is a straight line which meets the
circle in one point only and does not cut the circle when
produced. AC in Fig. 23.1 is a tangent to the circle since
it touches the curve at point B only. If radius OB is drawn,
then angle ABO is a right angle.
(viii) A sector of a circle is the part of a circle between radii (for
example, the portion OXY of Fig. 23.2 is a sector). If a
sector is less than a semicircle it is called a minor sector,
if greater than a semicircle it is called a major sector.

(ix) A chord of a circle is any straight line which divides the
circle into two parts and is terminated at each end by the
circumference. ST, in Fig. 23.2 is a chord.
(x) A segment is the name given to the parts into which a
circle is divided by a chord. If the segment is less than a
semicircle it is called a minor segment (see shaded area
in Fig. 23.2). If the segment is greater than a semicircle
it is called a major segment (see the unshaded area in
Fig. 23.2).
(xi) An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle. The
distance SRT in Fig. 23.2 is called a minor arc and the
distance SXYT is called a major arc.
(xii) The angle at the centre of a circle, subtended by an
arc, is double the angle at the circumference sub-
tended by the same arc. With reference to Fig. 23.3,
Angle AOC = 2 × angle ABC.

Determine the capacity of the tank in (a) m3 (b) cm3

(a) Volume of tank = 2 × 0.75 × 0.5 = 0.75 m3
(b) 1 m3 = 106 cm3, hence 0.75 m3 = 0.75 × 106 cm3

24.4 Volumes and surface areas of frusta
of pyramids and cones
The frustum of a pyramid or cone is the portion remaining
when a part containing the vertex is cut off by a plane parallel to
the base.
The volume of a frustum of a pyramid or cone is given by
the volume of the whole pyramid or cone minus the volume of
the small pyramid or cone cut off.
The surface area of the sides of a frustum of a pyramid or
cone is given by the surface area of the whole pyramid or cone
minus the surface area of the small pyramid or cone cut off. This
gives the lateral surface area of the frustum. If the total surface
area of the frustum is required then the surface area of the two
parallel ends are added to the lateral surface area.
There is an alternative method for ﬁnding the volume and
surface area of a frustum of a cone.With reference to Fig. 24.12:

cone −curved surface area of small cone cut off.
From Fig. 24.13, using Pythagoras’ theorem:
AB2 = AQ2 + BQ2,
from which
AB =

[10.82 + 3.02] = 11.21 cm
and
AD2 = AP2 + DP2,
from which
AD =

[7.22 + 2.02] = 7.47 cm
Curved surface area of large cone
= πrl = π(BQ)(AB) = π(3.0)(11.21) = 105.65 cm2
and curved surface area of small cone
= π(DP)(AD) = π(2.0)(7.47) = 46.94 cm2
Hence, curved surface area of frustum = 105.65 −46.94
= 58.71 cm2
Total surface area of frustum
= curved surface area + area of two circular ends
= 58.71 + π(2.0)2 + π(3.0)2
= 58.71 + 12.57 + 28.27 = 99.6 cm2
Method 2
From page 186, total surface area of frustum
= πl(R + r) + πr2 + πR2,
where l = BD = 11.21 −7.47 = 3.74 cm, R = 3.0 cm and r =
2.0 cm.
Hence total surface area of frustum
= π(3.74)(3.0 + 2.0) + π(2.0)2 + π(3.0)2 = 99.6 cm2

the diameters of the ends are 20.0 cm and 10.0 cm, respect-

The curved surface area of a frustum of a cone
= πl(R + r) from page 186.
Since the diameters of the ends of the frustum are 20.0 cm and
10.0 cm, then from Fig. 24.16,
r = 5.0 cm, R = 10.0 cm

At 15◦the height of the mid-ordinate is 10 sin 15◦= 2.588V.

Triangles and some practical applications
26.1
Sine and cosine rules
To ‘solve a triangle’ means ‘to ﬁnd the values of unknown sides
and angles’. If a triangle is right angled, trigonometric ratios
and the theorem of Pythagoras may be used for its solution,
as shown in Chapter 19. However, for a non-right-angled tri-
angle, trigonometric ratios and Pythagoras’ theorem cannot be
used. Instead, two rules, called the sine rule and the cosine rule,
are used.
Sine rule
With reference to triangle ABC of Fig. 26.1, the sine rule
states:
a
sinA =
b
sin B =
c
sin C
A

Fig. 26.1
The rule may be used only when:
(i) 1 side and any 2 angles are initially given, or
(ii) 2 sides and an angle (not the included angle) are initially
given.
Cosine rule
WithreferencetotriangleABC ofFig.26.1,thecosinerulestates:
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cos A
or
b2 = a2 + c2 −2ac cos B
or
c2 = a2 + b2 −2ab cos C
The rule may be used only when:
(i) 2 sides and the included angle are initially given, or
(ii) 3 sides are initially given.

Area of any triangle
The area of any triangle such as ABC of Fig. 26.1 is given by:

sin C
from which,
sin C = 17.92 sin 78◦51′
22.31

Hence C = sin−1 0.7881 = 52◦0′ or 128◦0′ (see Chapters 19
and 20).
Since B = 78◦51′, C cannot be 128◦0′, since 128◦0′ + 78◦51′
is greater than 180◦.
Thus only C = 52◦0′ is valid.
Angle A = 180◦−78◦51′ −52◦0′ = 49◦9′
Applying the sine rule:

When P = 46◦27′

Vectors
27.1
Introduction
Some physical quantities are entirely deﬁned by a numerical
value and are called scalar quantities or scalars. Examples
of scalars include time, mass, temperature, energy and volume.
Other physical quantities are deﬁned by both a numerical value
and a direction in space and these are called vector quantities
or vectors. Examples of vectors include force, velocity, moment
and displacement.
27.2 Vector addition
A vector may be represented by a straight line, the length of line
being directly proportional to the magnitude of the quantity and
the direction of the line being in the same direction as the line
of action of the quantity. An arrow is used to denote the sense
of the vector, that is, for a horizontal vector, say, whether it acts
from left to right or vice-versa. The arrow is positioned at the
end of the vector and this position is called the ‘nose’ of the
vector. Figure 27.1 shows a velocity of 20 m/s at an angle of 45◦
to the horizontal and may be depicted by oa = 20 m/s at 45◦to
the horizontal.
20 m/s

Fig. 27.1
To distinguish between vector and scalar quantities, various
ways are used. These include:
(i) bold print,
(ii) two capital letters with an arrow above them to denote the
sense of direction, e.g. −→
AB, where A is the starting point and
B the end point of the vector,
(iii) a line over the top of letters, e.g. AB or ¯a,
(iv) letters with an arrow above, e.g. ⃗a, ⃗A,
(v) underlined letters, e.g. a,
(vi) xi + jy, where i and j are axes at right-angles to each other;
for example, 3i + 4j means 3 units in the i direction and
4 units in the j direction, as shown in Fig. 27.2.

The one adopted in this text is to denote vector quantities in
bold print. Thus, oa represents a vector quantity, but oa is the
magnitude of the vector oa. Also, positive angles are measured
in an anticlockwise direction from a horizontal, right facing line
and negative angles in a clockwise direction from this line – as
with graphical work. Thus 90◦is a line vertically upwards and
−90◦is a line vertically downwards.
The resultant of adding two vectors together, say V1 at an
angle θ1 and V2 at angle (−θ2), as shown in Fig. 27.3(a), can
be obtained by drawing oa to represent V1 and then draw-
ing ar to represent V2. The resultant of V1 + V2 is given by
or. This is shown in Fig. 27.3(b), the vector equation being
oa + ar = or. This is called the ‘nose-to-tail’ method of vector
addition.

Alternatively, by drawing lines parallel to V1 and V2 from the
noses of V2 and V1, respectively, and letting the point of inter-
section of these parallel lines be R, gives OR as the magnitude
and direction of the resultant of adding V1 and V2, as shown in
Fig. 27.3(c).This is called the‘parallelogram’method of vector
addition.
Problem 1.
A force of 4 N is inclined at an angle of
45◦to a second force of 7 N, both forces acting at a
point. Find the magnitude of the resultant of these two
forces and the direction of the resultant with respect to
the 7 N force by both the ‘triangle’ and the ‘parallelogram’
methods.
The forces are shown in Fig. 27.4(a). Although the 7 N force
is shown as a horizontal line, it could have been drawn in any
direction.
Using the ‘nose-to-tail’ method, a line 7 units long is drawn
horizontally to give vector oa in Fig. 27.4(b). To the nose of
this vector ar is drawn 4 units long at an angle of 45◦to oa.
The resultant of vector addition is or and by measurement is
10.2 units long and at an angle of 16◦to the 7 N force.
Figure 27.4(c) uses the ‘parallelogram’ method in which
lines are drawn parallel to the 7 N and 4 N forces from the
noses of the 4 N and 7 N forces, respectively. These intersect at
R. Vector OR gives the magnitude and direction of the resul-
tant of vector addition and as obtained by the ‘nose-to-tail’
method is 10.2 units long at an angle of 16◦to the 7 N
force.

Often it is easier to use the ‘nose-to-tail’method when more than
two vectors are being added. The order in which the vectors are
added is immaterial. In this case the order taken is v1, then v2,
then v3 but just the same result would have been obtained if the
order had been, say, v1, v3 and ﬁnally v2. v1 is drawn 10 units long
at an angle of 20◦to the horizontal, shown by oa in Fig. 27.6. v2
is added to v1 by drawing a line 15 units long vertically upwards
from a, shown as ab.
Finally, v3 is added to v1 + v2 by drawing a line 7 units long
at an angle at 190◦from b, shown as br. The resultant of vector
addition is or and by measurement is 17.5 units long at an angle
of 82◦to the horizontal.
Thus v1 + v2 + v3 = 17.5 m/s at 82◦to the horizontal.

Resolution of vectors
A vector can be resolved into two component parts such that the
vector addition of the component parts is equal to the original
vector. The two components usually taken are a horizontal com-
ponent and a vertical component. For the vector shown as F in
Fig. 27.7, the horizontal component is F cos θ and the vertical
component is F sin θ.

Problem 3.
Resolve the acceleration vector of 17 m/s2 at
an angle of 120◦to the horizontal into a horizontal and a

For a vector A at angle θ to the horizontal, the horizontal com-
ponent is given by A cos θ and the vertical component by A sin θ.
Any convention of signs may be adopted, in this case horizontally
from left to right is taken as positive and vertically upwards is
taken as positive.
Horizontal component H = 17 cos 120◦= −8.50 m/s2, acting
from left to right.
Vertical component V = 17 sin 120◦= 14.72 m/s2, acting verti-
cally upwards.

27.4 Vector subtraction
In Fig. 27.11, a force vector F is represented by oa. The vector
(−oa) can be obtained by drawing a vector from o in the oppo-
site sense to oa but having the same magnitude, shown as ob in
Fig. 27.11, i.e. ob = (−oa).
For two vectors acting at a point, as shown in Fig. 27.12(a), the
resultant of vector addition is os = oa + ob. Fig. 27.12(b) shows
vectors ob + (−oa), that is, ob −oa and the vector equation is
ob −oa = od. Comparing od in Fig. 27.12(b) with the broken

Relative velocity
For relative velocity problems, some ﬁxed datum point needs to
be selected. This is often a ﬁxed point on the earth’s surface. In
any vector equation, only the start and ﬁnish points affect the
resultant vector of a system. Two different systems are shown in
Fig. 27.15, but in each of the systems, the resultant vector is ad.
The vector equation of the system shown in Fig. 27.15(a) is:
ad = ab + bd
and that for the system shown in Fig. 27.15(b) is:
ad = ab + bc + cd

Adding of waveforms
28.1
Combination of two periodic
functions
There are a number of instances in engineering and science where
waveforms combine and where it is required to determine the
single phasor (called the resultant) that could replace two or more
separate phasors. (A phasor is a rotating vector). Uses are found
in electrical alternating current theory, in mechanical vibrations,
in the addition of forces and with sound waves. There are several
methods of determining the resultant and two such methods –
plotting/measuring, and resolution of phasors by calculation –
areexplainedinthischapter.Knowledgeofchapters19,20and26
involving trigonometry and waveforms is needed for this chapter.
28.2
Plotting periodic functions
This may be achieved by sketching the separate functions on the
same axes and then adding (or subtracting) ordinates at regular
intervals. This is demonstrated in worked problems 1 to 3.
Problem 1.
Plot the graph of y1 = 3 sin A from A = 0◦to
A = 360◦. On the same axes plot y2 = 2 cos A. By adding
ordinates plot yR = 3 sin A + 2 cos A and obtain a sinusoidal
expression for this resultant waveform
y1 = 3 sin A and y2 = 2 cos A are shown plotted in Fig. 28.1.
Ordinates may be added at, say, 15◦intervals. For example,
at 0◦,
y1 + y2 = 0 + 2 = 2
at 15◦,
y1 + y2 = 0.78 + 1.93 = 2.71
at 120◦,
y1 + y2 = 2.60 + (−1) = 1.6
at 210◦,
y1 + y2 = −1.50 −1.73

The resultant waveform, shown by the broken line, has the same
period, i.e. 360◦, and thus the same frequency as the single pha-
sors. The maximum value, or amplitude, of the resultant is 3.6.
The resultant waveform leads y1 = 3 sin A by 34◦or 0.593 rad.
The sinusoidal expression for the resultant waveform is:
yR = 3.6 sin(A + 34◦)
or
yR = 3.6 sin( A + 0.593)

Fig. 28.2. Ordinates are added at 15◦intervals and the result-
ant is shown by the broken line. The amplitude of the resultant
is 6.1 and it lags y1 by 25◦or 0.436 rad. Hence the sinusoidal
expression for the resultant waveform is:
yR = 6.1 sin(ωt −0.436)

Determining resultant phasors by
calculation
The resultant of two periodic functions may be found from
their relative positions when the time is zero. For example, if
y1 = 4 sin ωt and y2 = 3 sin (ωt −π/3) then each may be repre-
sented as phasors as shown in Fig. 28.4, y1 being 4 units long
and drawn horizontally and y2 being 3 units long, lagging y1 by
π/3 radians or 60◦. To determine the resultant of y1 + y2, y1 is
drawn horizontally as shown in Fig. 28.5 and y2 is joined to the
end of y1 at 60◦to the horizontal. The resultant is given by yR.
This is the same as the diagonal of a parallelogram that is shown
completed in Fig. 28.6.

Given y1 = 2 sin ωt and y2 = 3 sin(ωt + π/4),
obtain an expression for the resultant yR = y1 + y2, (a) by
drawing, and (b) by calculation
(a) When time t = 0 the position of phasors y1 and y2 are as
shown in Fig. 28.8(a). To obtain the resultant, y1 is drawn
horizontally, 2 units long, y2 is drawn 3 units long at an angle
of π/4 rads or 45◦and joined to the end of y1 as shown in
Fig. 28.8(b). yR is measured as 4.6 units long and angle φ is
measured as 27◦or 0.47 rad.Alternatively, yR is the diagonal
of the parallelogram formed as shown in Fig. 28.8(c).
Hence, by drawing, yR = 4.6 sin(ωt + 0.47)
(b) From Fig. 28.8(b), and using the cosine rule:

Number sequences
29.1
Simple sequences
A set of numbers which are connected by a deﬁnite law is called
a series or a sequence of numbers. Each of the numbers in the
series is called a term of the series.
For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . is a series obtained by adding 2 to the
previous term, and 2, 8, 32, 128, . . . is a sequence obtained by
multiplying the previous term by 4.
Problem 1.
Determine the next two terms in the series:
3, 6, 9, 12, . . . .
We notice that the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, . . . progressively increases
by 3, thus the next two terms will be 15 and 18.
Problem 2.
Find the next three terms in the series:
9, 5, 1, . . . .
We notice that each term in the series 9, 5, 1, . . . progressively
decreases by 4, thus the next two terms will be 1 −4, i.e. −3 and
−3 −4, i.e. −7.
Problem 3.
Determine the next two terms in the series:
2, 6, 18, 54, . . . .
We notice that the second term, 6, is three times the ﬁrst
term, the third term, 18, is three times the second term, and
that the fourth term, 54, is three times the third term. Hence
the ﬁfth term will be 3 × 54 = 162 and the sixth term will be
3 × 162 = 486
Now try the following exercise

29.2 The n′th term of a series
If a series is represented by a general expression, say, 2n + 1,
where n is an integer (i.e. a whole number), then by substituting
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . the terms of the series can be determined; in this
example, the ﬁrst three terms will be:
2(1) + 1, 2(2) + 1, 2(3) + 1, . . . ,
i.e.
3, 5, 7, . . .
What is the n′th term of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . ? Firstly, we
notice that the gap between each term is 2, hence the law relating
the numbers is:
‘2n + something’
The second term,
3 = 2n + something,
hence when n = 2 (i.e. the second term of the series), then
3 = 4 + something and the ‘something’ must be −1. Thus the
n′th term of 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . is 2n −1. Hence the ﬁfth term is

Problem 6.
Find the n′th term of the series:
1, 4, 7, . . . .
We notice that the gap between each of the given three terms is
3, hence the law relating the numbers is:
‘3n + something’
The second term,
4 = 3n + something,
so when n = 2, then 4 = 6 + something,
so the ‘something’ must be −2 (from simple equations).
Thus the n′th term of the series 1, 4, 7, . . . is: 3n −2
Problem 7.
Find the n′th term of the sequence: 3, 9, 15,
21, . . . . Hence determine the 15th term of the series.
We notice that the gap between each of the given four terms is 6,
hence the law relating the numbers is:
‘6n + something’
The second term,
9 = 6n + something,
so when n = 2, then 9 = 12 + something,
so the ‘something’ must be −3
Thus the n′th term of the series 3, 9, 15, 21, . . . is: 6n −3
The 15th term of the series is given by 6n −3 when n = 15.
Hence the 15th term of the series 3, 9, 15, 21, . . . is:
6(15) −3 = 87

square numbers,
i.e.
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . ≡12, 22, 32, 42, 52, . . .
Hence the n′th term is: n2

Arithmetic progressions
When a sequence has a constant difference between successive
terms it is called an arithmetic progression (often abbreviated
to AP).
Examples include:
(i) 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, . . . where the common difference is 3,
and (ii) a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . where the common
difference is d.
If the ﬁrst term of an AP is ‘a’ and the common difference is
‘d’ then
the n′th term is : a + (n −1)d
In example (i) above, the 7th term is given by 1 + (7 −1)3 = 19,
which may be readily checked.
The sum S of an AP can be obtained by multiplying the average
of all the terms by the number of terms.
The average of all the terms = a + 1

and l is the last term, i.e. l = a + (n −1)d, for n terms.

2, 7, 12, 17, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common

(a) The n′th term of an AP is given by a + (n −1)d
Since the ﬁrst term a = 2, d = 5 and n = 9
then the 9th term is:
2 + (9 −1)5 = 2 + (8)(5) = 2 + 40 = 42

Problem 14.
The sum of 7 terms of an AP is 35 and the
common difference is 1.2. Determine the ﬁrst term of the
series.
n = 7, d = 1.2 and S7 = 35
Since the sum of n terms of an AP is given by
Sn = n
2[2a + (n −1) d],
then
35 = 7
2[2a + (7 −1)1.2] = 7
2[2a + 7.2]
Hence 35 × 2
7
= 2a + 7.2
10 = 2a + 7.2
Thus 2a = 10 −7.2 = 2.8, from which a = 2.8

Three numbers are in arithmetic progression.
Their sum is 15 and their product is 80. Determine the three

Let the three numbers be (a −d), a and (a + d)
Then (a −d) + a + (a + d) = 15, i.e. 3a = 15, from which, a = 5
Also, a(a −d)(a + d) = 80, i.e. a(a2 −d2) = 80
Since
a = 5, 5(52 −d2) = 80
125 −5d2 = 80
125 −80 = 5d2
45 = 5d2
from which, d2 = 45
5 = 9. Hence d =

The three numbers are thus (5 −3), 5 and (5 + 3), i.e. 2, 5 and 8

Geometric progressions
When a sequence has a constant ratio between successive terms
it is called a geometric progression (often abbreviated to GP).
The constant is called the common ratio, r
Examples include
(i) 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . where the common ratio is 2,
and (ii) a, ar, ar2, ar3, . . . where the common ratio is r
If the ﬁrst term of a GP is ‘a’ and the common ratio is r, then
the n′th term is : arn−1
which can be readily checked from the above examples.
For example, the 8th term of the GP 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . is (1)(2)7 = 128,
since a = 1 and r = 2
Let a GP be a, ar, ar2, ar3, . . . arn−1
then the sum of n terms,
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn−1 · · ·
(1)
Multiplying throughout by r gives:
rSn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + · · · arn−1 + arn · · ·
(2)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
Sn −rSn = a −arn
i.e.
Sn(1 −r) = a(1 −rn)
Thus the sum of n terms,
Sn = a(1 −rn)
(1 −r)
which is valid
when r < 1
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives
Sn = a(rn −1)
(r −1)
which is valid when r > 1
For example, the sum of the ﬁrst 8 terms of the GP 1, 2, 4,
8, 16, . . . is given by
S8 = 1(28 −1)
(2 −1) , since a = 1 and r = 2
i.e.
S8 = 1(256 −1)
1
= 255
When the common ratio r of a GP is less than unity, the sum of
n terms,
Sn = a(1 −rn)
(1 −r) , which may be written as
Sn =
a
(1 −r) −
arn
(1 −r)
Since r < 1, rn becomes less as n increases,
i.e.
rn →0
as
n →∞
Hence
arn
(1 −r) →0
as
n →∞
Thus
Sn →
a
(1 −r)

(1 −r) is called the sum to inﬁnity, S∞, and is the
limiting value of the sum of an inﬁnite number of terms,
i.e.
S∞=
a
(1−r)
which is valid when −1 < r < 1
For example, the sum to inﬁnity of the GP 1, 1

In a geometric progression the sixth term is
8 times the third term and the sum of the seventh and eighth
terms is 192. Determine (a) the common ratio, (b) the ﬁrst
term, and (c) the sum of the ﬁfth to eleventh terms, inclusive.
(a) Let the GP be a, ar, ar2, ar3, . . . , arn−1
The 3rd term = ar2 and the sixth term = ar5
The 6th term is 8 times the 3rd

If £100 is invested at compound interest
of 8% per annum, determine (a) the value after 10 years,
(b) the time, correct to the nearest year, it takes to reach
more than £300.
(a) Let the GP be a, ar, ar2, . . . arn
The ﬁrst term a = £100
The common ratio r = 1.08
Hence the second term is ar = (100)(1.08) = £108, which is
the value after 1 year, the third term is ar2 = (100)(1.08)2 =
£116.64, which is the value after 2 years, and so on.
Thus the value after 10 years = ar10 = (100)(1.08)10
= £215.89
(b) When £300 has been reached, 300 = arn
i.e.
300 = 100(1.08)n
and
3 = (1.08)n
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:

Problem 27.
A drilling machine is to have 6 speeds rang-
ing from 50 rev/min to 750 rev/min. If the speeds form a
geometric progression determine their values, each correct
to the nearest whole number.
Let the GP of n terms be given by a, ar, ar2, . . . arn−1
The ﬁrst term a = 50 rev/min.
The 6th term is given by ar6−1, which is 750 rev/min, i.e.,
ar5 = 750
from which r5 = 750
a
= 750
50 = 15
Thus the common ratio, r =
5√
15 = 1.7188
The ﬁrst term is a = 50 rev/min
the second term is ar = (50)(1.7188) = 85.94,
the third term is ar2 = (50)(1.7188)2 = 147.71,
the fourth term is ar3 = (50)(1.7188)3 = 253.89,
the ﬁfth term is ar4 = (50)(1.7188)4 = 436.39,
the sixth term is ar5 = (50)(1.7188)5 = 750.06
Hence, correct to the nearest whole number, the 6 speeds of the
drilling machine are 50, 86, 148, 254, 436 and 750 rev/min.

Presentation of statistical data
30.1
Some statistical terminology
Data are obtained largely by two methods:
(a) by counting – for example, the number of stamps sold by a
post ofﬁce in equal periods of time, and
(b) by measurement – for example, the heights of a group of
people.
When data are obtained by counting and only whole numbers are
possible, the data are called discrete. Measured data can have
any value within certain limits and are called continuous (see
Problem 1).
A set is a group of data and an individual value within the
set is called a member of the set. Thus, if the masses of ﬁve
people are measured correct to the nearest 0.1 kilogram and
are found to be 53.1 kg, 59.4 kg, 62.1 kg, 77.8 kg and 64.4 kg,
then the set of masses in kilograms for these ﬁve people is:
{53.1, 59.4, 62.1, 77.8, 64.4} and one of the members of the
set is 59.4.
A set containing all the members is called a population. Some
members selected at random from a population are called a sam-
ple. Thus all car registration numbers form a population, but the
registration numbers of, say, 20 cars taken at random throughout
the country are a sample drawn from that population.
The number of times that the value of a member occurs in
a set is called the frequency of that member. Thus in the set:
{2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 2, 4, 7, 9}, member 4 has a frequency of three,
member 2 has a frequency of 2 and the other members have a
frequency of one.
The relative frequency with which any member of a set occurs
is given by the ratio:
frequency of member
total frequency of all members
For the set: {2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 5, 6, 2, 8}, the relative frequency of
member 5 is 2
9
Often, relative frequency is expressed as a percentage and the
percentage relative frequency is:
(relative frequency × 100)%
Problem 1.
Data are obtained on the topics given below.
State whether they are discrete or continuous data.
(a) The number of days on which rain falls in a month for
each month of the year.
(b) The mileage travelled by each of a number of salesmen.
(c) The time that each of a batch of similar batteries lasts.
(d) The amount of money spent by each of several families
on food.
(a) The number of days on which rain falls in a given month
must be an integer value and is obtained by counting the
number of days. Hence, these data are discrete.
(b) A salesman can travel any number of miles (and parts of a
mile) between certain limits and these data are measured.
Hence the data are continuous.
(c) The time that a battery lasts is measured and can have
any value between certain limits. Hence these data are
continuous.
(d) The amount of money spent on food can only be expressed
correct to the nearest pence, the amount being counted.
Hence, these data are discrete.

Presentation of ungrouped data
Ungrouped data can be presented diagrammatically in several
ways and these include:
(a) pictograms, in which pictorial symbols are used to represent
quantities (see Problem 2),
(b) horizontal bar charts, having data represented by equally
spaced horizontal rectangles (see Problem 3), and
(c) vertical bar charts, in which data are represented by equally
spaced vertical rectangles (see Problem 4).
Trends in ungrouped data over equal periods of time can be pre-
sented diagrammatically by a percentage component bar chart.
In such a chart, equally spaced rectangles of any width, but whose
height corresponds to 100%, are constructed. The rectangles
are then subdivided into values corresponding to the percentage
relative frequencies of the members (see Problem 5).
A pie diagram is used to show diagrammatically the parts
making up the whole. In a pie diagram, the area of a circle rep-
resents the whole, and the areas of the sectors of the circle are
made proportional to the parts which make up the whole (see
Problem 6).

A table of percentage relative frequency values, correct to the

then for 4-roomed bungalows in year 1:
percentage relative frequency =
24 × 100

The retail price of a product costing £2 is made
up as follows: materials 10p, labour 20p, research and devel-
opment 40p, overheads 70p, proﬁt 60p. Present these data
on a pie diagram.
Acircleofanyradiusisdrawn,andtheareaofthecirclerepresents
the whole, which in this case is £2. The circle is subdivided into
sectors so that the areas of the sectors are proportional to the
parts, i.e. the parts which make up the total retail price. For the
area of a sector to be proportional to a part, the angle at the centre
of the circle must be proportional to that part. The whole, £2 or
200p, corresponds to 360◦. Therefore,
10p corresponds to 360 × 10
200 degrees, i.e. 18◦
20p corresponds to 360 × 20
200 degrees, i.e. 36◦
and so on, giving the angles at the centre of the circle for the parts
of the retail price as: 18◦, 36◦, 72◦, 126◦and 108◦, respectively.

Presentation of grouped data
When the number of members in a set is small, say ten or less, the
data can be represented diagrammatically without further analy-
sis, by means of pictograms, bar charts, percentage components
bar charts or pie diagrams (as shown in Section 30.2).
For sets having more than ten members, those members having
similar values are grouped together in classes to form a fre-
quency distribution. To assist in accurately counting members
in the various classes, a tally diagram is used (see Problems 8
and 12).
A frequency distribution is merely a table showing classes and
their corresponding frequencies (see Problems 8 and 12).
The new set of values obtained by forming a frequency
distribution is called grouped data.
The terms used in connection with grouped data are shown in
Fig. 30.6(a). The size or range of a class is given by the upper
class boundary value minus the lower class boundary value,
and in Fig. 30.6 is 7.65 −7.35, i.e. 0.30.The class interval for the
class shown in Fig. 30.6(b) is 7.4 to 7.6 and the class mid-point
value is given by
(upper class boundary value)
+ (lower class boundary value)
2
and in Fig. 30.6 is 7.65 + 7.35
2
, i.e. 7.5
One of the principal ways of presenting grouped data dia-
grammatically is by using a histogram, in which the areas

of vertical, adjacent rectangles are made proportional to fre-
quencies of the classes (see Problem 9). When class intervals
are equal, the heights of the rectangles of a histogram are
equal to the frequencies of the classes. For histograms hav-
ing unequal class intervals, the area must be proportional to
the frequency. Hence, if the class interval of class A is twice
the class interval of class B, then for equal frequencies, the
height of the rectangle representing A is half that of B (see
Problem 11).
Another method of presenting grouped data diagrammatically
is by using a frequency polygon, which is the graph produced
by plotting frequency against class mid-point values and joining
the co-ordinates with straight lines (see Problem 12).
A cumulative frequency distribution is a table showing the
cumulative frequency for each value of upper class boundary.
The cumulative frequency for a particular value of upper class
boundary is obtained by adding the frequency of the class to
the sum of the previous frequencies. A cumulative frequency
distribution is formed in Problem 13.
The curve obtained by joining the co-ordinates of cumulative
frequency (vertically) against upper class boundary (horizon-
tally) is called an ogive or a cumulative frequency distribution
curve (see Problem 13).
Problem 8.
The data given below refer to the gain of each
of a batch of 40 transistors, expressed correct to the nearest

The range of the data is the value obtained by taking the value of
the smallest member from that of the largest member. Inspec-
tion of the set of data shows that, range = 89 −71 = 18. The
size of each class is given approximately by range divided
by the number of classes. Since 7 classes are required, the
size of each class is 18/7, that is, approximately 3. To achieve

Presentation of statistical data
231
seven equal classes spanning a range of values from 71 to
89, the class intervals are selected as: 70–72, 73–75, and
so on.
To assist with accurately determining the number in each class,
a tally diagram is produced, as shown in Table 30.1(a). This is
obtained by listing the classes in the left-hand column, and then
inspecting each of the 40 members of the set in turn and allocating
them to the appropriate classes by putting ‘1s’ in the appropriate
rows. Every ﬁfth ‘1’ allocated to a particular row is shown as an
oblique line crossing the four previous ‘1s’, to help with ﬁnal
counting.
A frequency distribution for the data is shown in
Table 30.1(b) and lists classes and their corresponding frequen-
cies, obtained from the tally diagram. (Class mid-point values
are also shown in the table, since they are used for constructing
the histogram for these data (see Problem 9)).

The histogram is shown in Fig. 30.7. The width of the rect-

the lower class boundary values and the heights of the rect-
angles correspond to the class frequencies. The easiest way
to draw a histogram is to mark the class mid-point values
on the horizontal scale and draw the rectangles symmetrically
about the appropriate class mid-point values and touching one
another.

Inspection of the set given shows that the majority of the mem-
bers of the set lie between £80 and £110 and that there are a
much smaller number of extreme values ranging from £30 to
£170. If equal class intervals are selected, the frequency dis-
tribution obtained does not give as much information as one
with unequal class intervals. Since the majority of members
are between £80 and £100, the class intervals in this range are
selected to be smaller than those outside of this range. There
is no unique solution and one possible solution is shown in
Table 30.2.

Draw a histogram for the data given in

When dealing with unequal class intervals, the histogram must
be drawn so that the areas, (and not the heights), of the rectangles
are proportional to the frequencies of the classes. The data given

are shown in columns 1 and 2 of Table 30.3. Columns 3 and 4
give the upper and lower class boundaries, respectively. In col-
umn 5, the class ranges (i.e. upper class boundary minus lower
class boundary values) are listed. The heights of the rectangles
are proportional to the ratio frequency

The range of the data is the member having the largest value
minus the member having the smallest value. Inspection of the
set of data shows that:
range = 9.1 −7.1 = 2.0
The size of each class is given approximately by
range
number of classes
Since about seven classes are required, the size of each class is
2.0/7, that is approximately 0.3, and thus the class limits are
selected as 7.1 to 7.3, 7.4 to 7.6, 7.7 to 7.9, and so on.
The class mid-point for the 7.1 to 7.3 class is 7.35 + 7.05
2
, i.e.
7.2, for the 7.4 to 7.6 class is 7.65 + 7.35
2
, i.e. 7.5, and so on.
To assist with accurately determining the number in each
class, a tally diagram is produced as shown in Table 30.4.
This is obtained by listing the classes in the left-hand column
and then inspecting each of the 50 members of the set of data
in turn and allocating it to the appropriate class by putting
a ‘1’ in the appropriate row. Each ﬁfth ‘1’ allocated to a par-
ticular row is marked as an oblique line to help with ﬁnal
counting.

rically about the appropriate class mid-point values and touching
one another.A histogram for the data given inTable 30.5 is shown

Form a cumulative frequency distribution for these data and
draw the corresponding ogive.
A cumulative frequency distribution is a table giving values
of cumulative frequency for the values of upper class bound-
aries, and is shown in Table 30.6. Columns 1 and 2 show the
classes and their frequencies. Column 3 lists the upper class
boundary values for the classes given in column 1. Column 4
gives the cumulative frequency values for all frequencies less
than the upper class boundary values given in column 3. Thus,
for example, for the 7.7 to 7.9 class shown in row 3, the cumula-
tive frequency value is the sum of all frequencies having values
of less than 7.95, i.e. 3 + 5 + 9 = 17, and so on. The ogive for the
cumulative frequency distribution given inTable 30.6 is shown in
Fig. 30.11. The co-ordinates corresponding to each upper class
boundary/cumulative frequency value are plotted and the co-
ordinates are joined by straight lines (– not the best curve drawn
through the co-ordinates as in experimental work.) The ogive is
‘anchored’ at its start by adding the co-ordinate (7.05, 0).

Measures of central tendency and dispersion
31.1
Measures of central tendency
A single value, which is representative of a set of values, may be
used to give an indication of the general size of the members in
a set, the word ‘average’ often being used to indicate the single
value.
The statistical term used for ‘average’ is the arithmetic mean
or just the mean.
Other measures of central tendency may be used and these
include the median and the modal values.
31.2
Mean, median and mode for
discrete data
Mean
The arithmetic mean value is found by adding together the
values of the members of a set and dividing by the number
of members in the set. Thus, the mean of the set of numbers:
{4, 5, 6, 9} is:
4 + 5 + 6 + 9
4
,
i.e.
6
In general, the mean of the set: {x1, x2, x3, . . . xn} is
¯x = x1 + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn
n
, written as
 x
n
where  is the Greek letter ‘sigma’and means ‘the sum of’, and
¯x (called x-bar) is used to signify a mean value.
Median
The median value often gives a better indication of the general
size of a set containing extreme values. The set: {7, 5, 74, 10}
has a mean value of 24, which is not really representative of any
of the values of the members of the set. The median value is
obtained by:
(a) ranking the set in ascending order of magnitude, and
(b) selecting the value of the middle member for sets contain-
ing an odd number of members, or ﬁnding the value of the
mean of the two middle members for sets containing an even
number of members.
For example, the set: {7, 5, 74, 10} is ranked as {5, 7, 10, 74},
and since it contains an even number of members (four in
this case), the mean of 7 and 10 is taken, giving a median
value of 8.5. Similarly, the set: {3, 81, 15, 7, 14} is ranked as
{3, 7, 14, 15, 81} and the median value is the value of the middle
member, i.e. 14.
Mode
The modal value, or mode, is the most commonly occurring
value in a set. If two values occur with the same frequency,
the set is ‘bi-modal’. The set: {5, 6, 8, 2, 5, 4, 6, 5, 3} has a modal
value of 5, since the member having a value of 5 occurs three
times.
Problem 1.
Determine the mean, median and mode for
the set:
{2, 3, 7, 5, 5, 13, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3, 4, 3}
The mean value is obtained by adding together the values of the
members of the set and dividing by the number of members in
the set.
Thus, mean value,
¯x =
2 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 13 + 1
+7 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 3
13
= 65
13 = 5

236
Basic Engineering Mathematics
To obtain the median value the set is ranked, that is, placed in
ascending order of magnitude, and since the set contains an odd
numberofmembersthevalueofthemiddlememberisthemedian
value. Ranking the set gives:
{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 13}
The middle term is the seventh member, i.e. 4, thus the median
value is 4. The modal value is the value of the most commonly
occurring member and is 3, which occurs three times, all other
members only occurring once or twice.
Problem 2.
The following set of data refers to the amount
of money in £s taken by a news vendor for 6 days. Determine
the mean, median and modal values of the set:
{27.90, 34.70, 54.40, 18.92, 47.60, 39.68}
Mean value
= 27.90 + 34.70 + 54.40 + 18.92 + 47.60 + 39.68
6
= £37.20
The ranked set is:
{18.92, 27.90, 34.70, 39.68, 47.60, 54.40}
Since the set has an even number of members, the mean of the
middle two members is taken to give the median value, i.e.
median value = 34.70 + 39.68
2
= £37.19
Since no two members have the same value, this set has no mode.
Now try the following exercise

mode for discrete data (Answers on

31.3
Mean, median and mode for
grouped data
The mean value for a set of grouped data is found by determining
the sum of the (frequency × class mid-point values) and dividing
by the sum of the frequencies,
i.e. mean value ¯x = f1x1 + f2x2 + · · · fnxn
f1 + f2 + · · · + fn
=
 ( fx)
 f
where f is the frequency of the class having a mid-point value of
x, and so on.

10, 21.7

13, 22.7
9 and 23.2
2
For grouped data, the mean value is given by:
¯x =
 ( fx)
 f
where f is the class frequency and x is the class mid-point value.
Hence mean value,
¯x =
(3 × 20.7) + (10 × 21.2) + (11 × 21.7)
+ (13 × 22.2) + (9 × 22.7) + (2 × 23.2)
48
= 1052.1
48
= 21.919 . . .
i.e. the mean value is 21.9 ohms, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
Histogram
The mean, median and modal values for grouped data may be
determined from a histogram. In a histogram, frequency values
are represented vertically and variable values horizontally. The
mean value is given by the value of the variable corresponding to
a vertical line drawn through the centroid of the histogram. The
median value is obtained by selecting a variable value such that
theareaofthehistogramtotheleftofaverticallinedrawnthrough
the selected variable value is equal to the area of the histogram
on the right of the line. The modal value is the variable value
obtained by dividing the width of the highest rectangle in the
histogram in proportion to the heights of the adjacent rectangles.
The method of determining the mean, median and modal values
from a histogram is shown in Problem 4.
Problem 4.

The histogram is shown in Fig. 31.1. The mean value lies at the
centroid of the histogram. With reference to any arbitrary axis,
say YY shown at a time of 14 minutes, the position of the hori-
zontal value of the centroid can be obtained from the relationship
AM =  (am), where A is the area of the histogram, M is the
horizontal distance of the centroid from the axis YY, a is the
area of a rectangle of the histogram and m is the distance of
the centroid of the rectangle from YY. The areas of the individ-
ual rectangles are shown circled on the histogram giving a total
area of 100 square units. The positions, m, of the centroids of the
individual rectangles are 1, 3, 5, . . . units from YY. Thus
100 M = (10 × 1) + (16 × 3) + (32 × 5) + (24 × 7)
+ (12 × 9) + (6 × 11)
i.e.
M = 560

Thus the position of the mean with reference to the time scale is
14 + 5.6, i.e. 19.6 minutes.
The median is the value of time corresponding to a verti-
cal line dividing the total area of the histogram into two equal
parts. The total area is 100 square units, hence the vertical
line must be drawn to give 50 units of area on each side. To
achieve this with reference to Fig. 31.1, rectangle ABFE must
be split so that 50 −(10 + 16) units of area lie on one side and
50 −(24 + 12 + 6) units of area lie on the other. This shows that
the area of ABFE is split so that 24 units of area lie to the left of
the line and 8 units of area lie to the right, i.e. the vertical line
must pass through 19.5 minutes. Thus the median value of the
distribution is 19.5 minutes.
The mode is obtained by dividing the line AB, which is the
height of the highest rectangle, proportionally to the heights of
the adjacent rectangles. With reference to Fig. 31.1, this is done
by joining AC and BD and drawing a vertical line through the
point of intersection of these two lines. This gives the mode of
the distribution and is 19.3 minutes.

Standard deviation
(a) Discrete data
The standard deviation of a set of data gives an indication of the
amount of dispersion, or the scatter, of members of the set from
the measure of central tendency. Its value is the root-mean-square
value of the members of the set and for discrete data is obtained
as follows:
(a) determine the measure of central tendency, usually the
mean value, (occasionally the median or modal values are
speciﬁed),

238

(b) calculate the deviation of each member of the set from the
mean, giving
(x1 −¯x), (x2 −¯x), (x3 −¯x), . . . ,
(c) determine the squares of these deviations, i.e.
(x1 −¯x)2, (x2 −¯x)2, (x3 −¯x)2, . . . ,
(d) ﬁnd the sum of the squares of the deviations, that is
(x1 −¯x)2 + (x2 −¯x)2 + (x3 −¯x)2, . . . ,
(e) divide by the number of members in the set, n, giving
(x1 −¯x)2 + (x2 −¯x)2 + (x3 −¯x)2 + · · ·
n
(f) determine the square root of (e).
The standard deviation is indicated by σ (the Greek letter small
‘sigma’) and is written mathematically as:
standard deviation, σ =
(x −¯x)2
n

where x is a member of the set, ¯x is the mean value of the set
and n is the number of members in the set. The value of standard
deviation gives an indication of the distance of the members of a
set from the mean value.The set: {1, 4, 7, 10, 13} has a mean value
of 7 and a standard deviation of about 4.2. The set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
also has a mean value of 7, but the standard deviation is about
1.4. This shows that the members of the second set are mainly
much closer to the mean value than the members of the ﬁrst set.
The method of determining the standard deviation for a set of
discrete data is shown in Problem 5.

Quartiles, deciles and percentiles
Other measures of dispersion which are sometimes used are the
quartile, decile and percentile values. The quartile values of
a set of discrete data are obtained by selecting the values of
members which divide the set into four equal parts. Thus for the
set: {2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17} there are 11 members and the
values of the members dividing the set into four equal parts are
4, 7, and 13. These values are signiﬁed by Q1, Q2 and Q3 and
called the ﬁrst, second and third quartile values, respectively. It
can be seen that the second quartile value, Q2, is the value of the
middle member and hence is the median value of the set.
For grouped data the ogive may be used to determine the
quartile values. In this case, points are selected on the vertical
cumulative frequency values of the ogive, such that they divide
the total value of cumulative frequency into four equal parts.
Horizontal lines are drawn from these values to cut the ogive.
The values of the variable corresponding to these cutting points
on the ogive give the quartile values (see Problem 7).
When a set contains a large number of members, the set can be
split into ten parts, each containing an equal number of members.
These ten parts are then called deciles. For sets containing a very
large number of members, the set may be split into one hundred
parts, each containing an equal number of members. One of these
parts is called a percentile.

48
The ogive is formed by plotting these values on a graph, as shown
in Fig. 29.2. The total frequency is divided into four equal parts,
each having a range of 48/4, i.e. 12. This gives cumulative fre-
quency values of 0 to 12 corresponding to the ﬁrst quartile, 12 to
24 corresponding to the second quartile, 24 to 36 corresponding
to the third quartile and 36 to 48 corresponding to the fourth
quartile of the distribution, i.e. the distribution is divided into
four equal parts. The quartile values are those of the variable
corresponding to cumulative frequency values of 12, 24 and 36,
marked Q1, Q2 and Q3 in Fig. 31.2. These values, correct to the
nearest hour, are 37 hours, 43 hours and 48 hours, respectively.
The Q2 value is also equal to the median value of the distribu-
tion. One measure of the dispersion of a distribution is called the
semi-interquartile range and is given by (Q3 −Q1)/2, and is
(48 −37)/2 in this case, i.e. 5 1
2 hours.

Probability
32.1
Introduction to probability
Probability
The probability of something happening is the likelihood or
chance of it happening. Values of probability lie between 0 and
1, where 0 represents an absolute impossibility and 1 represents
an absolute certainty. The probability of an event happening
usually lies somewhere between these two extreme values and
is expressed either as a proper or decimal fraction. Examples of
probability are:
that a length of copper wire has zero
0
resistance at 100◦C
that a fair, six-sided dice will stop
1
6 or 0.1667
with a 3 upwards
that a fair coin will land with a head
1
2 or 0.5
upwards
that a length of copper wire has some
1
resistance at 100◦C
If p is the probability of an event happening and q is the
probability of the same event not happening, then the total
probability is p + q and is equal to unity, since it is an abso-
lute certainty that the event either does or does not occur, i.e.
p + q = 1
Expectation
The expectation, E, of an event happening is deﬁned in general
terms as the product of the probability p of an event happening
and the number of attempts made, n, i.e. E = pn.
Thus, since the probability of obtaining a 3 upwards when
rolling a fair dice is 1
6, the expectation of getting a 3 upwards on
four throws of the dice is 1
6 × 4, i.e. 2
3
Thus expectation is the average occurrence of an event.
Dependent event
A dependent event is one in which the probability of an event
happening affects the probability of another ever happening. Let
5 transistors be taken at random from a batch of 100 transistors
for test purposes, and the probability of there being a defective
transistor, p1, be determined. At some later time, let another 5
transistors be taken at random from the 95 remaining transistors
in the batch and the probability of there being a defective transis-
tor, p2, be determined. The value of p2 is different from p1 since
batch size has effectively altered from 100 to 95, i.e. probability
p2 is dependent on probability p1. Since transistors are drawn,
and then another 5 transistors drawn without replacing the ﬁrst 5,
the second random selection is said to be without replacement.
Independent event
An independent event is one in which the probability of an event
happening does not affect the probability of another event hap-
pening. If 5 transistors are taken at random from a batch of
transistors and the probability of a defective transistor p1 is deter-
mined and the process is repeated after the original 5 have been
replaced in the batch to give p2, then p1 is equal to p2. Since the
5 transistors are replaced between draws, the second selection is
said to be with replacement.
32.2
Laws of probability
The addition law of probability
The addition law of probability is recognised by the word ‘or’
joining the probabilities. If pA is the probability of event A
happening and pB is the probability of event B happening,
the probability of event A or event B happening is given by
pA + pB. Similarly, the probability of eventsA or B or C or . . . N
happening is given by
pA + pB + pC + · · · + pN

242
Basic Engineering Mathematics
The multiplication law of probability
The multiplication law of probability is recognised by the word
‘and’ joining the probabilities. If pA is the probability of event
A happening and pB is the probability of event B happening, the
probabilityofeventAandeventBhappeningisgivenbypA × pB.
Similarly, the probability of events A and B and C and . . . N
happening is given by
pA × pB × pC × · · · × pN
32.3 Worked problems on probability
Problem 1.
Determine the probabilities of selecting at ran-
dom (a) a man, and (b) a woman from a crowd containing
20 men and 33 women.
(a) The probability of selecting at random a man, p, is given by
the ratio
number of men
number in crowd
i.e.
p =
20
20 + 33
= 20
53
or
0.3774
(b) The probability of selecting at random a women, q, is given
by the ratio
number of women
number in crowd
i.e.
q =
33
20 + 33
= 33
53
or
0.6226
(Check: the total probability should be equal to 1;
p = 20
53 and q = 33
53
thus the total probability,
p + q = 20
53 + 33
53 = 1
hence no obvious error has been made).
Problem 2.
Find the expectation of obtaining a 4 upwards
with 3 throws of a fair dice.
Expectation is the average occurrence of an event and is deﬁned
as the probability times the number of attempts. The probability,
p, of obtaining a 4 upwards for one throw of the dice is 1
6.
Also, 3 attempts are made, hence n = 3 and the expectation,
E, is pn, i.e. E = 1
6 × 3 = 1
2 or 0.50.
Problem 3.

(a) the winning horse in a race in which 10 horses are

(b) The probability of selecting the winning horse in the ﬁrst
race is 1
10. The probability of selecting the winning horse
in the second race is 1
10. The probability of selecting the
winning horses in the ﬁrst and second race is given by the

probability = 1

Problem 5.
A batch of 100 capacitors contains 73 which
are within the required tolerance values, 17 which are below
the required tolerance values, and the remainder are above
the required tolerance values. Determine the probabilities
that when randomly selecting a capacitor and then a second
capacitor: (a) both are within the required tolerance values
when selecting with replacement, and (b) the ﬁrst one drawn
is below and the second one drawn is above the required
tolerance value, when selection is without replacement.
(a) The probability of selecting a capacitor within the required
tolerance values is 73
100. The ﬁrst capacitor drawn is now
replaced and a second one is drawn from the batch of 100.
The probability of this capacitor being within the required
tolerance values is also 73
100.
Thus, the probability of selecting a capacitor within the
required tolerance values for both the ﬁrst and the second
draw is
73
100 × 73
100 = 5329
10 000
or
0.5329
(b) The probability of obtaining a capacitor below the required
tolerance values on the ﬁrst draw is 17
100. There are now
only 99 capacitors left in the batch, since the ﬁrst capaci-
tor is not replaced. The probability of drawing a capacitor
above the required tolerance values on the second draw is
10
99, since there are (100 −73 −17), i.e. 10 capacitors above
the required tolerance value. Thus, the probability of ran-
domly selecting a capacitor below the required tolerance
values and followed by randomly selecting a capacitor above
the tolerance values is
17
100 × 10
99 = 170
9900 = 17

A batch of 40 components contains 5 which
are defective. A component is drawn at random from the
batch and tested and then a second component is drawn.
Determine the probability that neither of the components is
defective when drawn (a) with replacement, and (b) without
replacement.
(a) With replacement
The probability that the component selected on the ﬁrst draw
is satisfactory is 35
40, i.e. 7
8. The component is now replaced
and a second draw is made. The probability that this component
is also satisfactory is 7

batch and the batch number is 39. Hence, the probability of draw-
ing a satisfactory component on the second draw is 34

Problem 7.
A batch of 40 components contains 5 which
are defective. If a component is drawn at random from the
batch and tested and then a second component is drawn at
random, calculate the probability of having one defective
component, both with and without replacement.
The probability of having one defective component can be
achieved in two ways. If p is the probability of drawing a defect-
ive component and q is the probability of drawing a satisfactory
component, then the probability of having one defective com-
ponent is given by drawing a satisfactory component and then a
defective component or by drawing a defective component and
then a satisfactory one, i.e. by q × p + p × q
With replacement:
p = 5

Problem 8.
A box contains 74 brass washers, 86 steel
washers and 40 aluminium washers. Three washers are
drawn at random from the box without replacement. Deter-
mine the probability that all three are steel washers.
Assume, for clarity of explanation, that a washer is drawn at
random, then a second, then a third (although this assumption
does not affect the results obtained).The total number of washers
is 74 + 86 + 40, i.e. 200.
The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on the
ﬁrst draw is 86
200. There are now 85 steel washers in a batch of
199. The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on the
second draw is 85
199. There are now 84 steel washers in a batch
of 198. The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer
on the third draw is 84

Introduction to calculus
Calculus is a branch of mathematics involving or leading to
calculations dealing with continuously varying functions.
Calculus is a subject that falls into two parts:
(i) differential calculus (or differentiation) and
(ii) integral calculus (or integration).
Differentiation is used in calculations involving rates of change
(see section 33.10), velocity and acceleration, and maximum and
minimum values of curves (see ‘Engineering Mathematics’).

Functional notation
In an equation such as y = 3x2 + 2x −5, y is said to be a function
of x and may be written as y = f (x).
An equation written in the form f (x) = 3x2 + 2x −5 is termed
functional notation.
The value of f (x) when x = 0 is denoted by f (0), and the value
of f (x) when x = 2 is denoted by f (2) and so on.
Thus when
f (x) = 3x2 + 2x −5, then
f (0) = 3(0)2 + 2(0) −5 = −5
and
f (2) = 3(2)2 + 2(2) −5 = 11 and so on.

If f (x) = 4x2 −3x + 2 ﬁnd: f (0), f (3), f (−1)

when B coincides with A the chord becomes the tangent to the

Hence

As δx approaches zero, δy
δx approaches a limiting value and
the gradient of the chord approaches the gradient of the
tangent at A.
(ii) When determining the gradient of a tangent to a curve there
are two notations used. The gradient of the curve at A in
Figure 33.4 can either be written as:

Problem 3.
Differentiate from ﬁrst principles f (x) = x2

using the expression
f ′(x) = limit
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx

f (x) = x2
Substituting (x + δx) for x gives

As δx →0, {2x + δx} →{2x + 0}. Thus f ′(x) = 2x, i.e. the
differential coefﬁcient of x2 is 2x.
At x = 2, the gradient of the curve, f ′(x) = 2(2) = 4

Find the differential coefﬁcient of y = 5x
By deﬁnition, dy
dx = f ′(x) = limit

δx

The function being differentiated is y = f (x) = 5x. Substituting
(x + δx) for x gives: f (x + δx) = 5(x + δx) = 5x + 5δx. Hence
dy
dx = f ′(x) = limit

Since the term δx does not appear in {5} the limiting value as
δx →0 of {5} is 5.
Thus dy
dx = 5, i.e. the differential coefﬁcient of 5x is 5.
The equation y = 5x represents a straight line of gradient 5 (see
Chapter 12).
The ‘differential coefﬁcient’(i.e. dy
dx or f ′(x)) means ‘the gradient
of the curve’, and since the gradient of the line y = 5x is 5 this
result can be obtained by inspection. Hence, in general, if y = kx
(where k is a constant), then the gradient of the line is k and dy
dx
or f ′(x) = k.

Problem 5.
Find the derivative of y = 8
y = f (x) = 8. Since there are no x-values in the original equation,
substituting (x + δx) for x still gives f (x + δx) = 8. Hence

Thus, when y = 8, dy

The equation y = 8 represents a straight horizontal line and the
gradient of a horizontal line is zero, hence the result could have
been determined by inspection. ‘Finding the derivative’ means
‘ﬁnding the gradient’, hence, in general, for any horizontal line
if y = k (where k is a constant) then dy
dx = 0.

Differentiation of y = ax n by
the general rule
From differentiation by ﬁrst principles, a general rule for dif-
ferentiating axn emerges where a and n are any constants.
This rule is:
if
or,
if
y = axn
then
dy
dx = anxn−1
f (x) = axn
then
f ′(x) = anxn−1
(Each of the results obtained in worked problems 3 and 7 may be
deduced by using this general rule).
When differentiating, results can be expressed in a number
of ways.

For example: (i) if y = 3x2 then dy

(ii) if f (x) = 3x2 then f ′(x) = 6x,

(i) At 0, the gradient is positive and is at its steepest. Hence 0′
is a maximum positive value.
(ii) Between 0 and A the gradient is positive but is decreasing
in value until at A the gradient is zero, shown as A′.
(iii) Between A and B the gradient is negative but is increasing
in value until at B the gradient is at its steepest. Hence B′ is
a maximum negative value.
(iv) If the gradient of y = sin θ is further investigated between
B and C and C and D then the resulting graph of dy
dθ is seen
to be a cosine wave.
Hence the rate of change of sin θ is cos θ, i.e.
if y = sin θ
then
dy
dθ = cos θ
It may also be shown that:
if y = sin aθ,
dy
dθ = a cos aθ

(where a is a constant)

If a similar exercise is followed for y = cos θ then the graphs
of Figure 33.6 result, showing dy

Thus,

dθ = −sin θ
It may also be shown that:
if y = cos aθ, dy

Calculate the rate of change of voltage when (a) t = 0.005 s

v = 100 sin 200t volts. The rate of change of v is given by dv
dt .
dv
dt = (100)(200 cos 200t) = 20 000 cos 200t
(a) When t = 0.005 s,
dv
dt = 20 000 cos(200)(0.005) = 20 000 cos 1
cos 1 means ‘the cosine of 1 radian’ (make sure your
calculator is on radians – not degrees).
Hence dv
dt = 10 806 volts per second
(b) When t = 0.01 s,
dv
dt = 20 000 cos(200)(0.01) = 20 000 cos 2
Hence dv

Differentiation of eax and ln ax
A graph of y = ex is shown in Figure 33.7(a). The gradient of the
curve at any point is given by dy
dx and is continually changing.
By drawing tangents to the curve at many points on the curve
and measuring the gradient of the tangents, values of dy
dx for
corresponding values of x may be obtained. These values are
shown graphically in Figure 33.7(b). The graph of dy
dx against x
is identical to the original graph of y = ex. It follows that:
if y = ex,
then
dy

In differentiation, if f (x) = 2x2 then f ′(x) = 4x.Thus, the integral
of 4x is 2x2, i.e. integration is the process of moving from f ′(x)
to f (x). By similar reasoning, the integral of 2t is t2.
Integration is a process of summation or adding parts together
and an elongated S, shown as
)
, is used to replace the words ‘the
integral of’. Hence, from above,
)
4x = 2x2 and
)
2t is t2.
In differentiation, the differential coefﬁcient dy
dx indicates that
a function of x is being differentiated with respect to x, the dx
indicating that it is ‘with respect to x’. In integration the vari-
able of integration is shown by adding d (the variable) after the
function to be integrated.
Thus
)
4x dx means ‘the integral of 4x with respect to x’, and
)
2t dt means ‘the integral of 2t with respect to t’
As stated above, the differential coefﬁcient of 2x2 is 4x, hence
)
4x dx = 2x2. However, the differential coefﬁcient of 2x2 + 7 is
also 4x. Hence
)
4x dx could also be equal to 2x2 + 7. To allow
for the possible presence of a constant, whenever the process of
integration is performed, a constant ‘c’ is added to the result.
Thus
)
4x dx = 2x2 + c and
)
2t dt = t2 + c
‘c’ is called the arbitrary constant of integration.
34.2 The general solution of integrals of
the form axn
The general solution of integrals of the form
)
axn dx, where a
and n are constants and n ̸= −1, is given by:

axn dx = axn+1
n + 1 + c
Using this rule gives:
(i)
*
3x4 dx = 3x4+1
4 + 1 + c = 3

Both of these results may be checked by differentiation.
34.3
Standard integrals
From Chapter 33, d
dx (sin ax) = a cos ax
Since integration is the reverse process of differentiation it
follows that:
*
a cos ax dx = sin ax + c
or
*
cos ax dx = 1
asin ax + c
By similar reasoning
*
sin ax dx = −1
acos ax + c
*
eax dx = 1
aeax + c
and
* 1
x dx = ln x + c
From above,
)
axn dx = axn+1
n + 1 + c except when n = −1
When n = −1, then
)
x−1 dx =
) 1
x dx = ln x + c
A list of standard integrals is summarised in Table 34.1.

Deﬁnite integrals
Integrals containing an arbitrary constant c in their results are
called indeﬁnite integrals since their precise value cannot be
determined without further information. Deﬁnite integrals are
those in which limits are applied.
If an expression is written as [x]b
a ‘b’ is called the upper limit
and ‘a’ the lower limit.
The
operation
of
applying
the
limits
is
deﬁned
as:
[x]b
a = (b) −(a)
The increase in the value of the integral x2 as x increases from
1 to 3 is written as

Area under a curve

precisely, by using integration.

f (x) dx
Thus, determining the area under a curve by integration merely
involves evaluating a deﬁnite integral, as shown in Section 34.4.
There are several instances in engineering and science where
the area beneath a curve needs to be accurately determined. For
example, the areas between limits of a:
velocity/time graph gives distance travelled,
force/distance graph gives work done,
voltage/current graph gives power, and so on.
Should a curve drop below the x-axis, then y (= f (x)) becomes
negative and
)
f (x) dx is negative. When determining such areas
by integration, a negative sign is placed before the integral. For
the curve shown in Figure 34.2, the total shaded area is given by
(area E + area F + area G).
By integration,
total shaded area =

Basic Engineering Mathematics
(b) By the mid-ordinate rule,
area = (width of interval)(sum of mid-ordinates).
Selecting 6 intervals, each of width 0.5 gives the mid-
ordinates as shown by the broken lines in Figure 34.6.
Thus, area = (0.5)(8.7 + 13.2 + 19.2 + 26.7
+ 35.7 + 46.2)
= 74.85 square units

Integration gives the precise value for the area under a curve. In
this case Simpson’s rule is seen to be the most accurate of the
three approximate methods.
