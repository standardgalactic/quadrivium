Preface
When people ask me about what I do, I always struggle to give them a straightforward answer. My
career has taken me down many different paths, and I have worn many different hats over the years.
I am someone who has always been passionate about learning and trying new things, which has led
me to work in many different fields. I have
I worked in software development, advertising, marketing, network and telecom, systems adminis-
tration, training, technical writing, computer repair and other fields. I have always been driven by
the desire to learn more and expand my horizons. As I learned new technologies, met new people,
and explored new concepts, my mind became more open and my perspective widened. I began to
see connections and possibilities that I had never seen before.
The more I learned, the more I wanted to teach, sometimes for free. I love that feeling of seeing
the light bulb go off in someone’s head when they finally understand something that they have
been struggling with. I have always been a teacher at heart, and I have always enjoyed sharing my
knowledge with others.
This is exactly what led me to write this guide.
During the writing of this guide, I was always thinking about the people who would read it. I
aimed to create an accessible and easy-to-follow guide on NLP, GPT, and related topics for Python
developers with limited knowledge in these fields. My goal was to provide practical information that
readers could use to build their own intelligent systems without having to spend years learning
the theory behind these concepts.
In this practical hands-on guide, I share my knowledge and experience with OpenAI’s models,
specifically GPT-3 (but also other models), and how Python developers can use them to build
their own intelligent applications. The guide is designed to be a step-by-step guide that covers the
fundamental concepts and techniques of using GPT-3, and provides a hands-on approach to learning.
My inbox is always full, and I receive a lot of emails. However, the best emails I have received were
from people who have read my online guides and courses and found them useful. Please feel free to
reach out to me at aymen@faun.dev. I would love to hear from you.
I hope you enjoy reading this guide as much as I enjoyed writing it.

ChatGPT, GPT, GPT-3, DALL·E, Codex?
In December 2015, a group of brilliant minds came together with a common goal: promoting and
developing a friendly AI in a way that benefits humanity as a whole.
Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon
Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged
over US$1 billion to the venture. The organization stated it would “freely collaborate” with other
institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.
OpenAI is headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District of San Francisco. In April
2016, OpenAI released a public beta of “OpenAI Gym”, its platform for reinforcement learning
research. In December 2016, OpenAI released “Universe⁶”, a software platform for measuring
and training an AI’s general intelligence across the world’s supply of games, websites, and other
applications.
In 2018, Elon Musk resigned from his board seat, citing “a potential future conflict of interest” with
Tesla AI development for self-driving cars, but remained a donor. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from
non-profit to capped-profit, with a profit cap set to 100 times on any investment. The company
distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft, which announced an investment
package of US$1 billion into the company. OpenAI then announced its intention to commercially
license its technologies.
In 2020, OpenAI announced GPT-3, a language model trained on trillions of words from the Internet.
It also announced that an associated API, simply named “the API”, would form the heart of its
first commercial product. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering questions, but it can also
translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text. In 2021, OpenAI introduced
DALL-E, a deep-learning model that can generate digital images from natural language descriptions.
Fast forward to December 2022, OpenAI received widespread media coverage after launching a free
preview of ChatGPT. According to OpenAI, the preview received over a million signups within
the first five days. According to anonymous sources cited by Reuters in December 2022, OpenAI
projected revenue of US$200 million for 2023 and US$1 billion for 2024. As of January 2023, it was
in talks for funding that would value the company at $29 billion.
This is the story of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the for-profit
corporation OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc.
Most people didn’t know about OpenAI before the company released its popular ChatGPT.
The main purpose of ChatGPT was to mimic human behavior and have natural conversations with
people. However, the chatbot is able to learn and teach itself based on the conversations it has with

different users. This AI has conversational capabilities and can write tutorials and code, compose
music, and perform other tasks. The use cases for ChatGPT are quite diverse and can be endless;
users have proven this. Some use cases are creative (e.g. writing a rap song), others are malicious (e.g.
generating malicious code or commands), and still, others are business-oriented (e.g. SEO, content
marketing, email marketing, cold emails, and business productivity).
ChatGPT simply stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is built on top of OpenAI’s GPT-3
family of large language models. The chatbot is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement
learning techniques.
GPT-3 serves as the foundation for ChatGPT. ChatGPT is simply a project that utilizes GPT-3 and
adds a web interface, memory, and more user-friendly features. After reading this guide, you will
able to build your own chatbot, probably better than ChatGPT since you can customize it to your
specific needs.
Other projects using GPT-3 are:
• GitHub Copilot (using the OpenAI Codex model, a descendant of GPT-3, fine-tuned for
generating code)
• Copy.ai⁷ and Jasper.ai⁸ (content generation for marketing purposes)
• Drexel University (detection of early signs of Alzheimer’s disease)
• Algolia (enhancing their search engine capabilities)
You surely heard of GPT-4. GPT-4 is the successor of GPT-3 and is an unreleased neural network
created also by OpenAI.
You may have seen the chart comparing the two versions of GPT, showing the number of parameters
in GPT-3 (175 billion) and GPT-4 (100 trillion).

When asked about this viral illustration, Altman called it “complete bullshit.”
“The GPT-4 rumor mill is a ridiculous thing. I don’t know where it all comes from. People are begging
to be disappointed and they will be. The hype is just like… We don’t have an actual AGI and that’s
sort of what’s expected of us.”
In the same interview, Altman refused to confirm if the model will even be released in 2023.
About This Guide
The knowledge you gain from this guide will be applicable to the current version (GPT-3) and will
likely also be relevant to GPT-4, should it ever be released.
OpenAI provides APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to access their AI. The goal of an API
is to abstract the underlying models by creating a universal interface for all versions, allowing users
to use GPT regardless of its version.
The goal of this guide is to provide a step-by-step guide to using GPT-3 in your projects through this
API. Other models are also treated in this guide, such as the CLIP, DALL-E, and Whispers.

How Does GPT Work?
Generative Pre-trained Transformer or GPT is a generative text model. This model has the ability
to produce new text by predicting what comes next based on the input it receives.
GPT-3 is another model, it’s obviously larger and more performant than any other previous GPT
model including GPT-1 and GPT-2.
The 3rd generation was trained on a large corpus of text, such as books, articles, and publically
accessible websites like Reddit and other forums, it uses this training data to learn patterns and
relationships between words and phrases.
GPT-3’s key innovation lies in its impressive size - boasting a staggering 175 billion parameters -
making it one of the most massive and powerful language models ever devised. Its extensive training
on such a vast dataset enables it to generate human-like text, execute various natural language
processing tasks, and complete tasks with impressive accuracy.
GPT is a type of neural network called a transformer, which is specifically designed for natural
language processing tasks. The architecture of a transformer is based on a series of self-attention
mechanisms that allow the model to process input text in parallel and weigh the importance of each
word or token based on its context.
Self-attention is a mechanism used in deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP)
that allows a model to weigh the importance of different parts of a sentence or a number of sentences
when making predictions. Part of the Transformer architecture, it enables a neural network to
achieve a satisfactory degree of performance when it comes to NLP tasks.
This is an example of using Hugging Face transformers for GPT-2 inference.
1
from transformers import pipeline
2
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model = 'gpt2')
3
generator("Hello, I'm a language model", max_length = 30, num_return_sequences=3)
4
## [{'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. So while writing this, when I\
5
went out to meet my wife or come home she told me that my"},
6
##
{'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. I write and maintain software\
7
in Python. I love to code, and that includes coding things that require writing"}, \
8
...
By default, a model has no memory, this means that each input is processed independently, without
any information being carried over from previous inputs. When GPT generates text, it doesn’t
have any preconceived notions about what should come next based on previous inputs. Instead,
it generates each word based on the probability of it being the next likely word given the previous
input. This results in text that can be surprising and creative.
This is another example of code that uses a GPT model to generate text based on user input.

GPT-3 was designed as a general-purpose language model, which means that it can be used for a
wide variety of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization,
and question answering. OpenAI has been trained GPT-3 but you can base your own trained model
on your fine-tuned datasets. This enables more creative and specific use cases, in addition to the
default tasks the model can assist with, such as generating text, poetry, and stories. It can also be
used for building chatbots that are experts in a specific domain, other conversational interfaces, and
more!
In this guide, we will dive deep into OpenAI GPT-3, including how to effectively utilize the API and
the tools provided by the company and AI/ML community to prototype powerful and creative tools
and systems. This will not only enhance your proficiency in using the GPT-3 API but also broaden
your understanding of the concepts and techniques utilized in natural language processing and other
related fields.
GPT-3 is considered a significant advancement in natural language processing because of its
extensive scale. However, some experts have voiced concerns about the possibility of the model
creating prejudiced or damaging content. As with any technology, it’s super important to take a
step back and consider the ethical implications of its use. This guide will not cover the ethical issues
but only focuses on the practical aspects.
Happy coding!

Preparing the Development
Environment
Installing Python, pip, and a Virtual Environment for
Development
Obviously, you will need to have Python. In this book, we will use Python 3.9.5.
We are also going to use pip, the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages
from the Python Package Index and other indexes.
You don’t need to have Python 3.9.5 installed in your system since we are going to create a virtual
development environment. So whatever version you have, your development environment will be
isolated from your system and will use the same Python 3.9.5.
If Python is not installed, go to www.python.org/downloads/¹¹, download, and install one of
the Python 3.x versions. Depending on your operating system, you will have to follow different
instructions.
To manage our development environment, we are going to use virtualenvwrapper¹². You’ll find the
installation instructions in the official documentation¹³.
The easiest way to get it is using pip:
1
pip install virtualenvwrapper
Note: If you’re used to virtualenv, Poetry or any other package manager, you can keep using it. No
need to install virtualenvwrapper in this case.
If pip is not installed, the easiest way to install it is using the script provided in the official
documentation:
Download the script, from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py¹⁴.
Open a terminal/command prompt, cd to the folder containing the get-pip.py file and run:
¹¹https://www.python.org/downloads/
¹²https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper
¹³https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
¹⁴https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Preparing the Development Environment
11
1
# MacOs and Linux users
2
python get-pip.py
3
4
# Windows users
5
py get-pip.py
In summary, you should have these packages installed in your system:
• Python
• pip
• virtualenvwrapper (virtualenv or any other package manager you prefer)
I strongly recommend Windows users to create a virtual machine with Linux inside as most of the
examples provided in this book are run and test on a Linux Mint system.
Next, let’s create a virtual environment:
1
mkvirtualenv -p python3.9 chatgptforpythondevelopers
After creating it, activate it:
1
workon chatgptforpythondevelopers
Get Your OpenAI API Keys
The next step is creating API keys that will allow you to access the official API provided by OpenAI.
Go to https://openai.com/api/¹⁵ and create an account.
Follow the instructions provided to create an account, then create your API keys here:
https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys¹⁶
An API key should belong to an organization, you’ll be asked to create an organization. In this book,
we will call it: “LearningGPT”.
Save the generate secret key somewhere safe and accessible. You won’t be able to view it again
through your OpenAI account.
¹⁵https://openai.com/api/
¹⁶https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

Preparing the Development Environment
12
Installing the Official Python Bindings
You can interact with the API using HTTP requests from any language, either via the official Python
bindings, our the official Node.js library, or a community-maintained library.
In this book, we’ll use the official library provided by by OpenAI. Another alternative is using
Chronology¹⁷, an unofficial library provided by OthersideAI. Howeve, it seems that this library is
no longer updated.
To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:
1
pip install openai
Make sure you’re installing the library in the virtual environment we created earlier.
Testing our API Keys
In order to verify that everything works correctly, we are going to execute a curl call.
Let’s store the API key and the organization id in a .env file before:
1
cat << EOF > .env
2
API_KEY=xxx
3
ORG_ID=xxx
4
EOF
Before executing the above command, make sure to update the API_KEY and ORG_ID variables by
their respective values.
Now you can execute the following command:
1
source .env
2
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
3
-H 'Authorization: Bearer '$API_KEY'' \
4
-H 'OpenAI-Organization: '$ORG_ID''
You can skip sourcing the variables and using them directly in the curl command:
¹⁷https://github.com/OthersideAI/chronology

Preparing the Development Environment
13
1
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
2
-H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxx' \
3
-H 'OpenAI-Organization: xxxx'
If you have one organization in your OpenAI account, it is possible to execute the same command
without mentioning the organization id.
1
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxx'
The curl command should give you the list of models provided by the API like “davinci”, “ada” and
many others.
To test the API using a Python code, we can execute the following code:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
# reading variables from .env file, namely API_KEY and ORG_ID.
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
# Initializing the API key and organization id
11
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
12
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
13
14
# Calling the API and listing models
15
models = openai.Model.list()
16
print(models)
We’re going to use almost the same approach in the future, so let’s create a reusable function to
initialize the API. We can write our code like this:

print(models)

Available Models
The Three Main Models
There are main models or families of models if we can call them that:
• GPT-3
• Codex
• Content Filter model
You will probably find other models’ names in some documentation resources online, and this can
be confusing. Many of these documents are about older versions and not GPT-3.
Also, note that in addition to the three main models, you can create and fine-tune your own models.
GPT-3: Processing and Generating Natural Language
The GPT-3 model is capable of understanding human language and text that appears to be natural
language. This model family comes in a series of 4 models (A, B, C, D) that are more or less fast and
performant.
• D: text-davinci-003
• C: text-curie-001
• B: text-babbage-001
• A: text-ada-001
As said, each has different capabilities, pricing, and accuracy.
OpenAI recommends experimenting with the Davinci model, then trying the others which are
capable of performing a large number of similar tasks at much lower costs.
text-davinci-003
This is the most capable GPT-3 model as it can perform what all the other models can do. In addition,
it offers a higher quality compared to the others. It is the most recent model, as it was trained with
data dating up to June 2021.
One of its advantages is allowing requests of up to 4k tokens. It also supports inserting completions
within the text.
We will define tokens in more detail later in this guide. For now, just know that they determine the
length of the user’s request.

Available Models
16
text-curie-001
The text-curie-001 model is the second most capable GPT-3 model as it supports up to 2048 tokens.
Its advantage is that it is more cost-efficient than text-davinci-003 but still has high accuracy.
It was trained with data dating up to October 2019, so it is slightly less accurate than text-davinci-003.
It could be a good option for translation, complex classification, text analysis, and summaries.
text-babbage-001
Same as Curie: 2,048 tokens and data training up to October 2019.
This model is effective for simpler categorizations and semantic classification.
text-ada-001
Same as Curie: 2,048 tokens and data training up to October 2019.
This model is very fast and cost-effective, to be preferred for the simplest classifications, text
extraction, and address correction.
Codex: Understanding and Generating Computer Code
OpenAI proposes two Codex models for understanding and generating computer code: code-davinci-
002 and code-cushman-001.
Codex is the model that powers GitHub Copilot. It is proficient in more than a dozen programming
languages including Python, JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift, TypeScript, SQL and, Shell.
Codex is capable of understanding basic instructions expressed in natural language and carrying
out the requested tasks on behalf of the user.
Two models are available for Codex:
• code-davinci-002
• code-cushman-001
code-davinci-002
The Codex model is the most capable. It excels at translating natural language into code. Not only
does it complete the code, but it also supports the insertion of supplementary elements. It can handle
up to 8,000 tokens and was trained with data dating up to June 2021.

Available Models
17
code-cushman-001
Cushman is powerful and fast. Even if Davinci is more powerful when it comes to analyzing complex
tasks, this model has the capability for many code generation tasks.
It is also faster, and more affordable than Davinci.
Content Filter
As its name suggests, this is a filter for sensitive content.
Using this filter you can detect API-generated text that could be sensitive or unsafe. This filter can
classify text into 3 categories:
• safe,
• sensitive,
• unsafe.
If you are building an application that will be used by your users, you can use the filter to detect if
the model is returning any inappropriate content.
Listing all Models
Using the API models endpoint, you can list all available models.
Let’s see how this works in practice:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
models = openai.Model.list()
16
print(models)

Available Models
18
As you can see, we simply use the function list() from the module Model of the package openai.
as a result, we get a list similar to the following:

We already know Ada, Babbage, Curie, Cushman, and Davinci.
We have also seen Codex. Every model having code in its id is part of Codex.
Search models such as babbage-code-search-code are optimized for searching code but some of
them are now deprecated models including
ada-code-search-code,
ada-code-search-text,
babbage-code-search-codeandbabbage-code-search-text
and
they
were
replaced
by
code-search-ada-code-001,
code-search-ada-text-001,
code-search-babbage-code-001
and
code-search-babbage-text-001.
Other search models optimized for searching text like ada-search-document, ada-search-query,
babbage-search-document, babbage-search-query, curie-search-document and curie-search-query
are also deprecated and were replaced by text-search-ada-doc-001, text-search-ada-query-001,
text-search-babbage-doc-001,
text-search-babbage-query-001,
text-search-curie-doc-001
and text-search-curie-query-001
“similarity” models are for finding similar documents. ada-similarity, babbage-similarity,
curie-similarity,
davinci-similarity
were
replaced
by
text-similarity-ada-001,
text-similarity-babbage-001, text-similarity-curie-001 and text-similarity-davinci-001.

ada-instruct-beta are replaced by text-davinci-001, text-curie-001 , text-babbage-001and

Available Models
22
text-ada-001.
Note that davinci is not the same thing as text-davinci-003 or text-davinci-002 . They are all
powerful but they have some differences like the number of tokens they support.
Many of these legacy models used to be called ‘engines’, but OpenAI deprecated the term ‘engine’ in
favor of ‘model’. Many people and online resources use these terms interchangeably but the correct
name is ‘model’.
API requests that use the old names will still work, as OpenAI has ensured backward compatibility.
However, it is recommended that you use the updated names.
Example of a deprecated call:
1
response = openai.Completion.create(
2
engine="text-davinci-002",
3
prompt="What's the meaning of life?",
4
)
Example of the new way to make calls:
1
response = openai.Completion.create(
2
model="text-davinci-002",
3
prompt="What's the meaning of life?",
4
)
Which Model to Use?
Davinci models are by far the best models but they are the most expensive. So if optimizing costs
is not your first priority and you want to focus on quality, Davinci is the best choice for you. More
specifically, text-davinci-003 is the most powerful model.
Compared to davinci, text-davinci-003 is a newer, more capable model designed specifically for
instruction-following tasks and zero-shot scenarios, a concept that we are going to explore later in
this guide.
However, keep in mind that for some specific use cases, Davinci models are not always the go-to
choice. We are going to see more details later in this guide.
To optimize costs, the other models such as Curie are good alternatives especially if you are executing
simple requests such as text summarization or data extraction.
This applies to both GPT-3 and Codex.
The content filter is optional but it’s highly recommended if you are building a public application.
You don’t want your users to receive inappropriate results.

Available Models
23
What’s next?
To summarize this chapter, Davinci models like
text-davinci-003are the best models.
text-davinci-003 is recommended by OpenAI for most use cases. Other models such as
Curie can perform very well in certain use cases with around 1/10th the cost of Davinci.
The pricing model is clear and simple to understand. It can be found on the official website¹⁸.
Additionally, when you signup for OpenAI, you will get $18 in free credit that can be used during
your first 3 months.
In this guide, we are going to follow OpenAI recommendations and use the new models, not the
deprecated ones.
As we delve deeper into these models, you will gain a better understanding of how to use the API
to create, generate and edit text and images, either using the base models or your own fine-tuned
models. As we do more practical examples, you will have a better understanding of tokens, and the
pricing, and by the end, you’ll be able to create production-ready smart applications using this AI.

Using GPT Text Completions
Once you have authenticated your application, you can start using the OpenAI API to perform
completions. To do this, you need to use the OpenAI Completion API.
The OpenAI Completion API enables developers to access OpenAI’s datasets and models, making
completions effortless.
Begin by providing the start of a sentence. The model will then predict one or more possible
completions, each with an associated score.
A Basic Completion Example
For example, we feed the API the sentence “Once upon a time” and it will return the next possible
sentence.
Activate the development environment:
1
workon chatgptforpythondevelopers
Create a new Python file “app.py” where you will add the following code:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17
prompt="Once upon a time",

Using GPT Text Completions
25
18
max_tokens=7,
19
temperature=0
20
)
21
22
print(next)
Now execute the file:
1
python app.py
The API should return something like this:
1
{
2
"choices": [
3
{
4
"finish_reason": "length",
5
"index": 0,
6
"logprobs": null,
7
"text": " there was a little girl named Alice"
8
}
9
],
10
"created": 1674510189,
11
"id": "cmpl-6bysnKOUj0QWOu5DSiJAGcwIVMfNh",
12
"model": "text-davinci-003",
13
"object": "text_completion",
14
"usage": {
15
"completion_tokens": 7,
16
"prompt_tokens": 4,
17
"total_tokens": 11
18
}
19
}
In the above example, we have a single choice: “There was a little girl named Alice”. This result has
an index of 0.
The API also returned the “finish_reason”, which was “length” in this case.
The length of the output is determined by the API, based on the “max_tokens” value provided by
the user. In our case, we set this value to 7.
Note: Tokens, by definition, are common sequences of characters in the output text. A good way
to remember is that one token usually means about 4 letters of text for normal English words. This
means that 100 tokens are about the same as 75 words. Grasping this will aid you in comprehending
the pricing. Later in this book, we will delve deeper into pricing details.

Controlling the Output’s Token Count
Let’s test with a longer example, which means a greater number of tokens (15):
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17
prompt="Once upon a time",
18
max_tokens=15,
19
temperature=0
20
)
21
22
print(next)
The API returned a longer text:
1
{
2
"choices": [
3
{
4
"finish_reason": "length",
5
"index": 0,
6
"logprobs": null,
7

}
10
],
11
"created": 1674510438,
12

13
"model": "text-davinci-003",

16
"completion_tokens": 15,
17
"prompt_tokens": 4,
18
"total_tokens": 19
19
}
20
}
Logprobs
To increase the possibilities, we can use the “logprobs” parameter. For example, setting logprobs to
2 will return two versions of each token.
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13

14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16

18
max_tokens=15,
19
temperature=0,
20
logprobs=3,

)
22

You can see that each token has a probability or score associated with it. The API will return “there”
between “\n” and “there” since -1.1709108 is less than -0.9263134.
The API will select “was” instead of “lived” since -0.2422086 is greater than -2.040701. Similarly, this
will be the case for other values.

We can increase the size to 5. According to OpenAI, the maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you
require more than this, please contact their Help center and explain your use case.
Controlling Creativity: The Sampling Temperature
The next parameter we can customize is the temperature. This can be used to make the model more
creative, but creativity comes with some risks.
For a more creative application, we could use higher temperatures such as 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6.
The maximum temperature is 2.

The temperature is set to its maximum value, so executing the same script should return a distinct
result. This is where creativity comes into play.
Sampling with “top_p”
Alternatively, we could use the top_p parameter. For example, using 0.5 means only the tokens with
the highest probability mass, comprising 50%, are considered. Using 0.1 means the tokens with the
highest probability mass, comprising 10%, are considered.

It is recommended to either use the top_p parameter or the temperature parameter but not both.
The top_p parameter is also called nucleus sampling or top-p sampling.
Streaming the Results
Another common parameter we can use in OpenAI is the stream. It’s possible to instruct the API to
return a stream of tokens instead of a block containing all tokens. In this case, the API will return a
generator that yields tokens in the order they were generated.

Controlling Repetitivity: Frequency and Presence
Penalties
The Completions API has two features that can be used to stop the same words from being suggested
too often. These features change the chances of certain words being suggested by adding a bonus or
penalty to the logits (the numbers that show how likely a word is to be suggested).
These features can be enabled using two parameters:
• presence_penalty is a number that can be between -2.0 and 2.0. If the number is positive, it
makes it more likely for the model to talk about new topics, because it will be penalized if it
uses words that have already been used.
• Frequency_penalty is a number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values make it less likely for the
model to repeat the same line of text that has already been used.
In order to understand the effect of these parameters, let’s use them in the following code:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value

Using GPT Text Completions

openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17
prompt="Once upon a time",
18
max_tokens=100,
19
frequency_penalty=2.0,
20
presence_penalty=2.0,
21
)
22
23
print("=== Frequency and presence penalty 2.0 ===")
24
print(next["choices"][0]["text"])
25
26
next = openai.Completion.create(
27
model="text-davinci-003",
28
prompt="Once upon a time",
29
max_tokens=100,
30
frequency_penalty=-2.0,
31
presence_penalty=-2.0,
32
)
33
34
print("=== Frequency and presence penalty -2.0 ===")
35
print(next["choices"][0]["text"])
As you can see, the first execution will produce more diversity in the text (frequency_penalty=2.0
and presence_penalty=2.0), while the second is completely the opposite (frequency_penalty=-2.0,
presence_penalty=-2.0).
After executing the above code, the output was as follows:
1
=== Frequency and presence penalty 2.0 ===

As you can see, the second output kept producing the same outputs like “She lived a very happy life”
at a certain level.
Controlling the Number of Outputs
If you want to have more than one result, you can use the n parameter.
The following example will produce 2 results:
1
import os

def init_api():
5

Getting the “best of”
It is possible to ask the AI model to generate possible completions for a given task on the server side
and select the one with the highest probability of being correct. This can be done using the best_of
parameter.
When using best_of, you need to specify two numbers: n and best_of.
As seen previously, n is the number of candidate completions you want to see.
Note: Make sure that best_of is greater than n.
Let’s see an example:

Using GPT Text Completions
43
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value

10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12

15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",

18
max_tokens=5,
19
n=1,
20
best_of=2,
21
)
22
23
print(next)
Controlling When the Completion Stops
In most cases, it is useful to stop the API from generating more text.
Let’s say, we want to generate a single paragraph and no more. In this case, we can ask the API
to stop completing the text when there is a new line (\n). This can be done using a similar code as
below:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")

Using GPT Text Completions
44
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17
prompt="Once upon a time",
18
max_tokens=5,
19
stop=["\n",],
20
)
21
22
print(next)
The stop parameter can contain up to four stop words. Note that the completion will not include
the stop sequence in the result.
This is another example:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17
prompt="Once upon a time",
18
max_tokens=5,
19
stop=["\n", "Story", "End", "Once upon a time"],
20
)
21
22
print(next)

Using Suffix After Text Completion
Imagine, we want to create a Python dict containing the list of primary numbers between 0 and 9:
1
{
2
"primes": [2, 3, 5, 7]
3
}
The API, in this case, is supposed to return 2, 3, 5, 7 . We can use the suffix parameter in this
case. This parameter configures the suffix that comes after the completion of inserted text.
Let’s try two examples to better understand.
In the first example, we are going to tell the API how the dict should start using {\n\t\"primes\":
[:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-002",
17
prompt= "Write a JSON containing primary numbers between 0 and 9 \n\n{\n\t\"prim\
18
es\": [",
19
)
20
21
print(next)
The API should return this text:
1
2, 3, 5, 7]\n}
As you can see, it closes the list and the dict.
In the second example, we don’t want to see the API closing the data structure by inserting ]\n} at
the end of the resulting text. This is when the suffix parameter is used:

Using GPT Text Completions
46
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-002",
17
prompt= "Write a JSON containing primary numbers between 0 and 9 \n\n{\n\t\"prim\
18
es\": [",
19
suffix= "]\n}",
20
)
21
22
print(next)
The API should now return:
1
2, 3, 5, 7
Instead of the previous one (2, 3, 5, 7]\n})
And this is how we can inform the API about the suffix of a completion.

model: specifies the model that the API should use for generating the text completion. In this case,
it is using “text-davinci-002”.
prompt: is the text that the API uses as a starting point for generating the completion. In our case,
we used a prompt that is a to-do list for creating a company in the US. The first item should start
with “1.”, knowing that the output we asked for should be in this format;
1
1. <1st item>
2
2. <2nd item>
3
3. <3nd item>
4
4. <4th item>
5
5. <5th item>
temperature controls the “creativity” of the text generated by the model. The higher temperature the
more creative and diverse completions will be. On the other hand, a lower temperature will result
in a more “conservative” and predictable completions. In this case, the temperature is set to 0.3.
max_tokens limits the maximum number of tokens that the API will generate. In our case, the
maximum number of tokens is 64. You can increase this value but keep in mind that the more
tokens you will generate, the more credits you will be charged. When learning and testing, keeping
a lower value will help you avoid overspending.
top_p controls the proportion of the mass of the distribution that the API considers when generating
the next token. A higher value will result in more conservative completions, while a lower value will
result in more diverse completions. In this case, the top_p is set to 0.1. It is not recommended to use
both this and temperature but it’s not also a blocking issue.
frequency_penalty is used to adjust the model’s preference for generating frequent or rare words.
A positive value will decrease the chances of frequent words, while a negative value will increase
them. In this case, the frequency_penalty is set to 0
presence_penalty is used to adjust the model’s preference for generating words that are present or
absent in the prompt. A positive value will decrease the chances of words that are present in the
prompt, a negative value will increase them. The presence_penalty is set to 0.5 in our example.
stop is used to specify a sequence of tokens that the API should stop generating completions after. In
our example, since we only want 5 items, we should stop generating after the token 6. is generated.

Conclusion
The OpenAI Completions API is a powerful tool for generating text in various contexts. With the
right parameters and settings, it can produce natural-sounding text that is pertinent to the task.
By configuring the right values for some parameters such as frequency and presence penalties, the
results can be tailored to produce desired outcomes.
With the ability to control when the completion stops, the user can also control the length of the
generated text. This could be also helpful to reduce the number of tokens generated and indirectly
reduce costs.

Editing Text Using GPT
After being given a prompt and a set of instructions, the GPT model you are using will take the
prompt and then use its algorithms to generate a modified version of the original prompt.
This modified version can be longer and/or more detailed than the initial prompt depending on your
instructions.
A GPT model is able to understand the context of the prompt and the instructions given, allowing
it to determine which additional details would be most beneficial to include in the output.
Example: Translating Text
We’re always using the same development environment named “chatgptforpythondevelopers”.
Start by activating it:
1
workon chatgptforpythondevelopers
Note that the “.env” file should be always present in the current directory where the Python file is
located.
Now create the “app.py” file containing the following code:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",

Editing Text Using GPT
58
17
input="Hallo Welt",
18
instruction="Translate to English",
19
)
20
21
print(response)
In the code above, we’re using the same function to authenticate:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
Then, we asked the API to translate a German text to English:
1
response = openai.Edit.create(
2
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
3
input="Hallo Welt",
4
instruction="Translate to English",
5
)
6
7
print(response)
After executing the code above, you should see the following output:

59

{
2
"choices": [
3
{
4
"index": 0,
5
"text": "Hello World!\n"

}

],

"created": 1674653013,

11
"completion_tokens": 18,
12
"prompt_tokens": 20,
13
"total_tokens": 38
14
}
15
}
The API returned a single choice with the index 0, Hello World!\\n, as seen in the output above.
Unlike in completion, where we provide the API with a prompt, we need to provide the instruction
and the input here.
Instruction is Required, Input is Optional
It’s important to note that the instruction is required while the input is optional.
It is possible to provide just the instruction and includes the input in the same line:

def init_api():

Editing Using the Completions Endpoint and Vice Versa
Some tasks you can execute using the edits endpoint can be done using the completions endpoint.
It’s up to you to choose which one is best for your needs.
This is an example of a translation task using the edits endpoint:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13

14
15
response = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
17
instruction="Translate from English to French, Arabic, and Spanish.",
18
input="The cat sat on the mat."
19
)
20
21
print(response)
This is the same task as above, but using the completions endpoint:

openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")

13
init_api()
14
15
next = openai.Completion.create(
16
model="text-davinci-003",
17

18
Translate the following sentence from English to French, Arabic, and Spanish.
19
English: The cat sat on the mat.

Spanish:
23
""",
24
max_tokens=60,
25
temperature=0
26
)
27
28

The following example, on the other hand, will use the edits endpoint to perform a text completion:
1
import os
2

def init_api():
5

Creativity vs. Well-Defined Answers
Same as the completions endpoint, we have control over the creativity of the result using the
temperature parameter.
You can try this example using two different temperatures to see the difference in the output:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response_1 = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
17
instruction="correct the spelling mistakes:",
18
input="The kuick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and",
19
temperature=0,
20
)
21
22
response_2 = openai.Edit.create(
23
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
24
instruction="correct the spelling mistakes:",
25
input="The kuick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and",
26
temperature=0.9,
27
)
28
29
print("Temperature 0:")
30
print(response_1['choices'][0]['text'])
31
print("Temperature 0.9:")
32
print(response_2['choices'][0]['text'])
Generally, after running the code multiple times, you may observe that the first output is consistent,
while the second one changes from one execution to the next. For a use case such as fixing typos,
we usually don’t need creativity, so setting the temperature parameter to 0 is enough.

Editing Text Using GPT
66
The creativity parameter should be set to more than 0 if other use cases, but not this one.
Here’s an opportunity to be more creative:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
17
input="Exercise is good for your health.",
18
instruction="Edit the text to make it longer.",
19
temperature=0.9,
20
)
21
22
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
Here is an example of an output:
1
Exercise is good for your health. Especially if you haven't done any for a month.
This is another variation of the output:
1
Exercise is good for your health.
2
It will help you improve your health and mood.
3
It is important for integrating your mind and body.
Surprisingly (or perhaps not), this is an output I have got with temperature=0:

Editing Text Using GPT
67
1
Exercise is good for your health.
2
Exercise is good for your health.
3
Exercise is good for your health.
4
Exercise is good for your health.
5
Exercise is good for your health.
6
Exercise is good for your health.
7
...
8
...
Another way to get more creative is using the top_np parameter.
This is an alternative to sampling with temperature, therefore, it’s recommended to not use both
temperature and top_p at the same time:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
17
input="Exercise is good for your health.",
18
instruction="Edit the text to make it longer.",
19
top_p=0.1,
20
)
21
22
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
In the above example, I used top_p=0.1 and this means the mode will consider the results of the
tokens with top_p probability mass = 0.1. In other words, only tokens comprising the top 10%
probability mass are considered in the result.

Generating Multiple Edits
In all of the previous examples, we always had a single edit. However, using the parameter n, it is
possible to get more. Just use the number of edits you want to have:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Edit.create(
16
model="text-davinci-edit-001",
17
input="Exercise is good for your health.",
18
instruction="Edit the text to make it longer.",
19
top_p=0.2,
20
n=2,
21
)
22
23
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
24
print(response["choices"][1]["text"])
In the above example, I used n=2 to get two results.
I also used top_p=0.2 . However, this has no bearing on the number of results; I simply wanted to
have a wider range of results.

Examples
Until now, we have seen how to use different endpoints: edits and completions. Let’s do more
examples to understand the different possibilities the model offers.
Chaining Completions and Edits
In this example, we are going to ask the model to generate a tweet out of a text, then translate it.
In the first task, we are going to use the completions endpoint to get the text of the tweet followed
by the second task’s code, which is translating the tweet:

Note that we added strip() to remove leading and trailing spaces.
Apple the Company vs. Apple the Fruit (Context
Stuffing)
Let’s create a code that tells us if a word is a noun or an adjective. One of the challenges with this can
be seen when we provide the model with words such as “light”. “Light” can be a noun, an adjective,
or a verb.
• The light is red.
• This desk is very light.

Advanced Text Manipulation Examples
71
• You light up my life.
There are other words that can be at the same time used as nouns, adjectives, or verbs: “firm”, “fast”,
“well” ..etc, and this example applies to them too.
Now, if we want to ask the model, we could write the following code:
1
prompt = "Determine the part of speech of the word 'light'.\n\n"
2
3
result = openai.Completion.create(
4
model="text-davinci-002",
5
prompt=prompt,
6
max_tokens=20,
7
temperature=1,
8
)
9
10
print(result.choices[0]["text"].strip())
You can try the code, it will sometimes output verb, sometimes adjective, sometimes noun, but I
had this too The word 'light' can be used as a noun, adjective, or verb.
By using context, we can influence the model response. A context is a hint given to the model to
guide it through user-defined patterns.

Advanced Text Manipulation Examples
72
Let’s ask the model while giving it some hints. The hint can be anything that will help the model
understand the context.
For example:
1
prompt_a = "The light is red. Determine the part of speech of the word 'light'.\n\n"
2
prompt_b = "This desk is very light. Determine the part of speech of the word 'light\
3
'.\n\n"
4
prompt_c = "You light up my life. Determine the part of speech of the word 'light'.\\
5
n\n"
6
7
for prompt in [prompt_a, prompt_b, prompt_c]:
8
result = openai.Completion.create(
9
model="text-davinci-002",
10
prompt=prompt,
11
max_tokens=20,
12
temperature=0,
13
)
14
15
print(result.choices[0]["text"].strip())
Understanding the context better leads to this result:
1
noun
2
adjective
3
verb
Another example is the following one, where we give two different hints to the model. In the first
instance, we want to understand that Apple is a company, whereas in the second, Apple should refer
to the fruit.
1
prompt = "Huawei:\ncompany\n\nGoogle:\ncompany\n\nMicrosoft:\ncompany\n\nApple:\n"
2
prompt = "Huawei:\ncompany\n\nGoogle:\ncompany\n\nMicrosoft:\ncompany\n\nApricot:\nF\
3
ruit\n\nApple:\n"
4
5
result = openai.Completion.create(

Let’s see a second example where we provide a schema or a template that the model should follow

creation date, its Coingecko page, and all-time high and low.

Embedding
Overview of Embedding
If we want to describe this feature in one sentence, we would say that OpenAI’s text embeddings
measure how similar two text strings are to each other.
Embeddings, in general, are often used for tasks like finding the most relevant results to a search
query, grouping text strings together based on how similar they are, recommending items with
similar text strings, finding text strings that are very different from the others, analyzing how
different text strings are from each other, and labeling text strings based on what they are most
like.
From a practical point of view, embeddings are a way of representing real-world objects and
relationships as a vector (a list of numbers). The same vector space is used to measure how similar
two things are.
Use Cases
OpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings and can be used for a variety of
purposes.
These are some use cases:
• Natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, semantic similarity, and
sentiment classification.
• Generating text-embedded features for machine learning models, such as keyword matching,
document classification, and topic modeling.
• Generating language-independent representations of text, allowing for cross-language compar-
ison of text strings.
• Improving the accuracy of text-based search engines and natural language understanding
systems.
• Creating personalized recommendations, by comparing a user’s text input with a wide range
of text strings.
We can summarize the use cases as follows:
• Search: where results are ranked by relevance to a query string

Embedding
84
• Clustering: where text strings are grouped by similarity
• Recommendations: where items with related text strings are recommended
• Anomaly detection: where outliers with little relatedness are identified
• Diversity measurement: where similarity distributions are analyzed
• Classification: where text strings are classified by their most similar label
Following are some practical approaches to using embeddings (not necessarily OpenAI’s):
Tesla
Working with unstructured data can be tricky – raw text, pictures, and videos don’t always make
it easy to create models from scratch. That’s often because it’s hard to get the original data due to
privacy constraints, and it can take a lot of computing power, a large data set, and time to create
good models.
Embeddings are a way to take information from one context (like an image from a car) and use it in
another context (like a game). This is called transfer learning, and it helps us to train models without
needing lots of real-world data.
Tesla is using this technique in their self-driving cars.
Kalendar AI
Kalendar AI is a sales outreach product that uses embeddings to match the right sales pitch to the
right customers from a dataset of 340 million profiles in an automated way.
The automation relies on the similarity between embeddings of customer profiles and sales pitches
to rank the most suitable matches. According to OpenAI, this has reduced unwanted targeting by
40–56% compared to their previous approach.
Notion
Notion, an online workspace tool, improved its search capabilities by leveraging the power of
OpenAI’s embeddings. The search in this case goes beyond the simple keyword-matching systems
that the tool was currently using.
This new feature allows Notion to better understand the structure, context, and meaning of the
content stored in its platform, enabling users to perform more precise searches and find documents
more quickly.

Embedding
85
DALL·E 2
DALL·E 2 is a system that takes text labels and turns them into images.
It works by using two models called Prior and Decoder. Prior takes text labels and creates CLIP²²
image embeddings, while the Decoder takes the CLIP image embeddings and produces a learned
image. The image is then upscaled from 64x64 to 1024x1024.
Requirements
To work with embedding, you should install datalib using the following command:
1
pip install datalib
At another level of this guide, we will need Matplotlib and other libraries:
1
pip install matplotlib plotly scipy scikit-learn
Make sure you are installing it in the right virtual development environment.
This package will also install tools like pandas and NumPy.
These libraries are some of the most used in AI and data science in general.
• pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation
tool, built on top of Python.
• NumPy is another Python library adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these
arrays.
• Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical
mathematics extension NumPy.
• plotly.py is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python
sparkles.

Understanding Text Embedding
Let’s start with this example:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Embedding.create(
16
model="text-embedding-ada-002",
17
input="I am a programmer",
18
)
19
20
print(response)
As usual, we are importing openai , authenticating, and calling an endpoint. However, this time we
are using “Ada” which is the only best model available on OpenAI for embedding. OpenAI team
recommends using text-embedding-ada-002 for nearly all use cases as they describe it as “better,
cheaper, and simpler to use”.
The output should be long and should look like this:
1

"object": "list",
19
"usage": {
20
"prompt_tokens": 4,
21
"total_tokens": 4
22
}
23
}
We can access the embedding directly using:
1
print(response["embedding"])
The program we wrote prints a list of floating point numbers such as 0.010284645482897758 and
0.013211660087108612.
These floating points represent the embedding of the input text “I am a programmer” generated by
the OpenAI “text-embedding-ada-002” model.
The embedding is a high-dimensional representation of the input text that captures its meaning. This
is sometimes referred to as a vector representation or simply an embedding vector.
An embedding is a way of representing an object, such as text, using a large number of values. Each
value represents a specific aspect of the object’s meaning and the strength of that aspect for that
specific object. In the case of text, the aspects could represent topics, sentiments, or other semantic
features of the text.
In other words, what you need to understand here is that a vector representation generated by the
embedding endpoint is a way of representing data in a format that can be understood by machine
learning models and algorithms. It is a way of taking a given input and turning it into a form that
can be used by these models and algorithms.
We are going to see how to use it in different use cases.
Embeddings for Multiple Inputs
In the last example, we used:

Embedding
88
1
input="I am a programmer",
It is possible to use multiple inputs and this is how to do it:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
response = openai.Embedding.create(
16
model="text-embedding-ada-002",
17
input=["I am a programmer", "I am a writer"],
18
)
19
20
for data in response["data"]:
21
print(data["embedding"])
It is important to note that each input must not exceed 8192 tokens in length.
Semantic Search
In this part of the guide, we are going to implement a semantic search using OpenAI embeddings.
This is a basic example, but we are going to go through more advanced examples.

Pandas is an extremely powerful tool when it comes to data manipulation including data in CSV
files. This perfectly applies to our use case. Let’s use pandas to read the file and create a pandas
dataframe.
1
df = pd.read_csv('words.csv')
DataFrame is the most commonly used pandas object.
Pandas official documentation describes a dataframe as a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with
columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict
of Series objects.
If you print df, you will see this output:
1
text
2

Next, we are going to get the embedding for each work in the dataframe. To do this, we are not
going to use the openai.Embedding.create() function, but get_embedding. Both will do the same
thing but the first will return a JSON including the embeddings and other data while the second will
return a list of embeddings. The second one is more practical to use in a dataframe.
This function works as follows:
1
get_embedding("Hello", engine='text-embedding-ada-002')
2
# will return [-0.02499537356197834, -0.019351257011294365, ..etc]
We are also going to use the function apply that every dataframe object has. This function (apply)
applies a function to an axis of a dataframe.

Embedding
92
1
# import the function to get the embedding
2
from openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding
3
4
# get the embedding for each word in the dataframe
5
df['embedding'] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, engine='text-embedding\
6
-ada-002'))
Now we have a dataframe with two axes, one is text and the other is embeddings. The last one
contains the embeddings for each word on the first axis.
Let’s save the dataframe to another CSV file:
1
df.to_csv('embeddings.csv')
The new file should look like in the following screenshot:
It contains 3 columns: id, text, and embeddings.
Let’s now read the new file and convert the last column to a numpy array. Why?

Embedding
93
Because in the next step, we will use the cosine_similarity function. This function expects a numpy
array while it’s by default a string.
But why not just use a regular Python array/list because of a numpy array?
In reality, numpy arrays are widely used in numerical calculations. The regular list module doesn’t
provide any help with this kind of calculation. In addition to that, an array consumes less memory
and is faster. This is due to the fact that an array is a collection of homogeneous data-types that are
stored in contiguous memory locations while a list in Python is a collection of heterogeneous data
types stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
Back to our code, let’s convert the last column to a numpy array:
1
df['embedding'] = df['embedding'].apply(eval).apply(np.array)
Now we are going to ask the user for input, read it, and perform a semantic search using cosine_-
similarity:
1
# get the search term from the user
2
user_search = input('Enter a search term: ')
3
4
# get the embedding for the search term
5
user_search_embedding = get_embedding(user_search, engine='text-embedding-ada-002')
6
7
# import the function to calculate the cosine similarity
8
from openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity
9
10
# calculate the cosine similarity between the search term and each word in the dataf\
11
rame
12
df['similarity'] = df['embedding'].apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, user_search_\
13
embedding))
Let’s see what the 3 latest operations in the code above do:
1)
user_search_embedding
=
get_embedding(user_search,
engine='text-embedding-ada-002')
This line of code uses the get_embedding function to get the embedding for the user-specified
search term user_search.
The engine parameter is set to 'text-embedding-ada-002' which specifies the OpenAI text embed-
ding model to use.
2)
from openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity

Embedding
94
This line of code imports the cosine_similarity function from the openai.embeddings_utils
module.
The cosine_similarity function calculates the cosine similarity between two embeddings.
3)
df['similarity'] = df['embedding'].apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, user_search_-
embedding))
This line of code creates a new column in the dataframe named 'similarity' and uses the apply
method with a lambda function to calculate the cosine similarity between the user search term’s
embedding and each word’s embedding in the dataframe.
The cosine similarity between each pair of embeddings is stored in the new similarity column.
This is the everything put together:

By using the “similarity” axis, we can see which word is semantically similar to “office”. The higher
the float value, the more similar the word from the “text” column is.
Words like “necklace”, “bracelet” and “earring” have a score of 0.77 however a word like “desk”
has a score of 0.88.
To make the result more readable, we can sort the dataframe by the similarity axis:
1
# sort the dataframe by the similarity axis
2
df = df.sort_values(by='similarity', ascending=False)
We can also get the top 10 similarities using:
1
df.head(10)

Cosine Similarity
The similarity between two words was performed by what we call the cosine similarity. In order to
use it there’s no need to understand the mathematical details but if you want to dive deeper into this
topic, you can read this part of the guide. Otherwise, skipping it, will not change your understanding
of how to use OpenAI APIs to build intelligent applications.

Cosine similarity is a way of measuring how similar two vectors are. It looks at the angle between
two vectors (lines) and compares them. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the
vector. A result is a number between -1 and 1. If the vectors are the same, the result is 1. If the
vectors are completely different, the result is -1. If the vectors are at a 90-degree angle, the result is
0. In mathematical terms, this is the equation:
$$
Similarity = (A.B) / (||A||.||B||)
$$
• A and B are vectors
• A.B is a way of multiplying two sets of numbers together. It is done by taking each number
in one set and multiplying it with the same number in the other set, then adding all of those
products together.
• ||A|| is the length of the vector A. It is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the
squares of each element of the vector A.
Let’s consider vector A = [2,3,5,2,6,7,9,2,3,4] and vector B = [3,6,3,1,0,9,2,3,4,5].
This is how we can get the cosine similarity between them using Python:
1
# import numpy and norm from numpy.linalg
2
import numpy as np
3
from numpy.linalg import norm
4
5
# define two vectors
6
A = np.array([2,3,5,2,6,7,9,2,3,4])
7
B = np.array([3,6,3,1,0,9,2,3,4,5])
8
9
# print the vectors
10
print("Vector A: {}".format(A))
11
print("Vector B: {}".format(B))
12
13
# calculate the cosine similarity
14
cosine = np.dot(A,B)/(norm(A)*norm(B))
15
16
# print the cosine similarity
17
print("Cosine Similarity between A and B: {}".format(cosine))
We can also write the same program using Python Scipy:

import numpy as np
2
from scipy import spatial
3
4
# define two vectors
5
A = np.array([2,3,5,2,6,7,9,2,3,4])
6
B = np.array([3,6,3,1,0,9,2,3,4,5])
7
8
# print the vectors
9
print("Vector A: {}".format(A))
10
print("Vector B: {}".format(B))
11
12
# calculate the cosine similarity
13
cosine = 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(A, B)
14
15
# print the cosine similarity
16
print("Cosine Similarity between A and B: {}".format(cosine))
Or using Scikit-Learn:
1
import numpy as np
2
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
3
4
# define two vectors
5
A = np.array([2,3,5,2,6,7,9,2,3,4])

# print the cosine similarity

Predicting your Preferred Coffee
Our goal throughout this part is to recommend the best coffee blend for a user based on their input.
For example, the user enters “Ethiopia Dumerso” and the program finds that “Ethiopia Dumerso”,
“Ethiopia Guji Natural Dasaya” and “Organic Dulce de Guatemala” are the nearest blends to their
choice, the output will contain these three blends.
We will need a dataset that we can download on Kaggle. Go to Kaggle and download the dataset
named simplified_coffee.csv²³. (You will need to create an account.)
The dataset has 1267 rows (blends) and 9 features:
• name (coffee name)
• roaster (roaster name)
• roast (roast type)
• loc_country (country of the roaster)
• origin (origin of the beans)
• 100g_USD (price per 100g in USD)
• rating (rating out of 100)
• review_date (date of review)
• review (review text)
What interests us in this dataset are the reviews made by users. These reviews were scraped from
www.coffeereview.com²⁴.
When a user enters the name of a coffee, we will use the OpenAI Embeddings API to get the
embedding for the review text of that coffee. Then, we will calculate the cosine similarity between
the input coffee review and all other reviews in the dataset. The reviews with the highest cosine
similarity scores will be the most similar to the input coffee’s review. We will then print the names
of the most similar coffees to the user.
Let’s start step by step.

The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for
symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming
language. In the next step, you are going to understand how we are using it.
Now, using your terminal, type python to go into the Python interpreter. Then, type the following
commands:
1
import nltk
2
nltk.download('stopwords')
3
nltk.download('punkt')
NLTK comes with many corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc. The above (stopwords and
punkt) are the only ones we need for this demo. If you want to download all of them, you can use
nltk.download('all') instead. You can find a complete list of corpora here²⁵.
We are going to create 3 functions:
1

31
stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english'))
32
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
33
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(review.lower())
34
tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords]
35
tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
36
return ' '.join(tokens)
The init_api function will read the API key and organization ID from the .env file and set the
environment variables.
The download_nltk_data function will download the punkt and stopwords corpora if they are not
already downloaded.
The preprocess_review function will lowercase, tokenize, remove stopwords, and stem the review
text.
The function tokenizes the review into individual words using the nltk.word_tokenize() function.
Then it removes stopwords (common words like “the”, “a”, “and”, etc.) from the review using a list of
stopwords obtained from the stopwords corpus in NLTK using the nltk.corpus.stopwords.words()
function.
Finally,
it
stems
the
words
using
the
Porter
stemmer
from
NLTK
using
the
nltk.stem.PorterStemmer() function. Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its root
form. For example, the words “running”, “ran”, and “run” all have the same stem “run”. This is
important as it will help us reduce the number of unique words in the review text, optimize the
performance of our model by reducing the number of parameters and reduce any cost associated
with the API calls.
The function joins the stemmed words back into a single string using the .join() method of Python
strings. This is the final preprocessed review text that we will use to generate the embedding.
Next, add the following code:
1
init_api()
2
download_nltk_data()
This will initialize the OpenAI API and download the necessary NLTK data using the function
already defined. Mainly, the function will check if you didn’t download the required data manually
and will download if not.
Then we need to read the user input:

Advanced Embedding Examples
105
1
# Read user input
2
input_coffee_name = input("Enter a coffee name: ")
Next, we’ll load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Note that we are only reading the first 50
rows here. You can change this code and remove nrows to load all the CSV dataset.
1
# Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (only the first 50 rows for now to speed\
2
up the demo and avoid paying for too many API calls)
3
df = pd.read_csv('simplified_coffee.csv', nrows=50)
Then we’ll preprocess all the preview texts:
1
# Preprocess the review text: lowercase, tokenize, remove stopwords, and stem
2
df['preprocessed_review'] = df['review'].apply(preprocess_review)
Now, we need to get the embeddings for each review:
1
# Get the embeddings for each review
2
review_embeddings = []
3
for review in df['preprocessed_review']:
4
review_embeddings.append(get_embedding(review, engine='text-embedding-ada-002'))
Then we’ll get the index of the input coffee name. If the coffee name isn’t in our database, we’ll exit
the program:
1
# Get the index of the input coffee name
2
try:
3
input_coffee_index = df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name].index[0]
4
except:
5
print("Sorry, we don't have that coffee in our database. Please try again.")
6
exit()
input_coffee_index
=
df[df['name']
==
input_coffee_name].index[0] is using Pandas’
df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name] to get the row of the DataFrame that contains the input
coffee name.
For example, df[df['my_column'] == my_value] is selecting rows from the DataFrame df where
the value in the my_column column is equal to my_value.
This code returns a new DataFrame that only contains the rows that meet this condition. The
resulting DataFrame has the same columns as the original DataFrame df, but with only the rows
that meet the condition.

Advanced Embedding Examples
106
For example, if df is a DataFrame of coffee reviews (which is our case), and my_column is the “name”
column, then df[df['name'] == 'Ethiopia Yirgacheffe'] would return a new DataFrame that
contains only the reviews for the “Ethiopia Yirgacheffe” coffee.
Next, we used index[0] to get the index of that row.
index[0] is used to retrieve the first index of the resulting filtered DataFrame returned by
df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name].
Here is a quick summary of what input_coffee_index
=
df[df['name']
==
input_coffee_-
name].index[0] does:
1. df['name'] == input_coffee_name creates a boolean mask that is True for rows where the
“name” column is equal to input_coffee_name and False for all other rows.
2. df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name] uses this boolean mask to filter the DataFrame and
returns a new DataFrame that contains only the rows where the “name” column is equal to
input_coffee_name.
3. df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name].index returns the index labels of the resulting filtered
DataFrame.
4. index[0] retrieves the first index label from the resulting index labels. Since the filtered
DataFrame only contains one row, this is the index label for that row.
Next, we’ll calculate the cosine similarity between the input coffee’s review and all other reviews:
1
# Calculate the cosine similarity between the input coffee's review and all other re\
2
views
3
similarities = []
4
input_review_embedding = review_embeddings[input_coffee_index]
5
for review_embedding in review_embeddings:
6
similarity = cosine_similarity(input_review_embedding, review_embedding)
7
similarities.append(similarity)
cosine_similarity(input_review_embedding,
review_embedding)
is
using
OpenAI’s
openai.embeddings_utils.cosine_similarity() function to calculate the cosine similarity
between the input coffee’s review and the current review. (We have previously used this function
in a previous example.)
After that, we’ll get the indices of the most similar reviews (excluding the input coffee’s review
itself):
1
# Get the indices of the most similar reviews (excluding the input coffee's review i\
2
tself)
3
most_similar_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-6:-1]

Advanced Embedding Examples
107
If you have used numpy before, you’re certainly familiar with the argsort, you can skip the following
detailed explanation of how it works.
np.argsort(similarities)[-6:-1] is using NumPy’s argsort() function to get the indices of the
top 5 most similar reviews to the input coffee’s review. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what’s
happening:
argsort() returns the indices that would sort the similarities array in ascending order.
For example, if similarities is [0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0], here’s how
np.argsort(similarities)[-6:-1] would work:
1. np.argsort(similarities) would return the sorted indices: [9,
8,
7,
6,
5,
4,
1,
3,
0, 2]. The array is sorted based on the values of similarities: similarities[0] = 0.8,
similarities[1] = 0.5, similarities[2] = 0.9, etc.
2. np.argsort(similarities)[-6:-1] would return the 6th to 2nd indices from the end of the
sorted array: [5, 4, 1, 3, 0].
When np.argsort(similarities) is called, it returns an array of indices that would sort the
similarities array in ascending order. In other words, the first index in the sorted array would
correspond to the element in similarities with the smallest value, and the last index in the sorted
array would correspond to the element in similarities with the largest value.
In the example [0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 0.6, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0], the index of the smallest
value (0.0) is 9, the index of the second-smallest value (0.1) is 8, and so on. The resulting sorted
array of indices is [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2].
This sorted array of indices is then used to get the indices of the top 5 most similar reviews by slicing
the array to get the 6th to 2nd elements from the end of the array: [5, 4, 1, 3, 0]. These indices
correspond to the most similar reviews in descending order of similarity.
You may ask, why aren’t we using [-5:] ?
If we used np.argsort(similarities)[-5:] instead of np.argsort(similarities)[-6:-1], we
would get the 5 most similar reviews, including the input coffee’s review itself. The reason we
exclude the input coffee’s review itself from the most similar reviews —it’s not very helpful to
recommend the same coffee that the user has already tried. By using [-6:-1], we’re excluding the
1st element from the slice, which corresponds to the input coffee’s review.
Another question you may ask is, why is the review itself in the similarity array?
The review itself was added to the review_embeddings array when we created embeddings for each
review using the get_embedding() function.
Next, we’ll get the names of the most similar coffees:

Advanced Embedding Examples
108
1
# Get the names of the most similar coffees
2
similar_coffee_names = df.iloc[most_similar_indices]['name'].tolist()
df.iloc[most_similar_indices]['name'].tolist() is using Pandas’ iloc[] function to get the
names of the most similar coffees. Here’s an explanation:
df.iloc[most_similar_indices] is using iloc[] to get the rows of the DataFrame that correspond
to the most similar reviews. For example, if the most similar indices are [3, 4, 0, 2], df.iloc[most_-
similar_indices] would return the rows of the DataFrame that correspond to the 4th, 5th, 1st, and
3rd most similar reviews.
Then we use ['name'] to get the name column of those rows. Finally, we use tolist() to convert the
column to a list. This gives us a list of the names of the most similar coffees.
Finally, we’ll print the results:
1
# Print the results
2
print("The most similar coffees to {} are:".format(input_coffee_name))
3
for coffee_name in similar_coffee_names:
4
print(coffee_name)

Making a “fuzzier” Search
A potential issue with the code is that the user must enter the exact name of a coffee that is present
in the dataset. Some examples are: “Estate Medium Roast”, “Gedeb Ethiopia” ..etc This is not likely
to happen in real life. The user may miss a character or a word, mistype the name or use a different
case and this will exit the search with a message Sorry, we don't have that coffee in our
database. Please try again.
One solution is to perform a more flexible lookup. For example, we can search for a name that
contains the input coffee name while ignoring the case:
1
# get the index of the input coffee name
2
try:
3
# search for a coffee name in the dataframe that looks like the input coffee nam\
4
e
5
input_coffee_index = df[df['name'].str.contains(input_coffee_name, case=False)].\
6
index[0]
7
print("Found a coffee name that looks like {}. Using that.".format(df.iloc[input\
8
_coffee_index]['name']))
9
except:
10
print("Sorry, we don't have that coffee name in our database. Please try again.")
11
exit()
If we use the code above and execute it, we will get more than one result for some keywords:

Advanced Embedding Examples
111
1
# get the index of the input coffee name
2
try:
3
# search for all coffee names in the dataframe that looks like the input coffee \
4
name
5
input_coffee_indexes = df[df['name'].str.contains(input_coffee_name, case=False)\
6
].index
7
except:
8
print("Sorry, we couldn't find any coffee with that name.")
9
exit()
By running this on the dataset we have with the keywords “Ethiopia” we will get around 390 results.
We should, therefore, process the embedding of each description of these results and compare each
one of them to the embeddings of the other coffee descriptions. This could be quite long we will
certainly get tens of results. In this case, we better use 3 names out of all results, but how can we
select them? Should just get some random names out of the results?
A better solution is using a fuzzy search technique. For example, we can use the Levenshtein
distance²⁶ technique using Python. In simple words, the Levenshtein distance between two words
is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to
transform one word into the other. You don’t need to reimplement any algorithm by yourself, as
most of them can be found in libraries like textdistance²⁷.
Another solution is running a cosine similarity search between the user input and the coffee names.
1
# get the index of the input coffee name
2
try:
3
input_coffee_index = df[df['name'] == input_coffee_name].index[0]
4
except IndexError:
5
# get the embeddings for each name
6
print("Sorry, we don't have that coffee name in our database. We'll try to find \
7
the closest match.")
8
name_embeddings = []
9
for name in df['name']:
10
name_embeddings.append(get_embedding(name, engine='text-embedding-ada-002'))
11
# perform a cosine similarity search on the input coffee name
12
input_coffee_embedding = get_embedding(input_coffee_name, engine='text-embedding\
13
-ada-002')
14
_similarities = []
15
for name_embedding in name_embeddings:
16
_similarities.append(cosine_similarity(input_coffee_embedding, name_embeddin\
17
g))
18
input_coffee_index = _similarities.index(max(_similarities))

19
except:
20
print("Sorry, we don't have that coffee name in our database. Please try again.")
21
exit()
This means that we will have two cosine similarity searches in the same code:
• Searching the nearest name to the user input (name_embeddings)
• Searching the nearest description to the user input (review_embeddings)
We can also combine the fuzzy and cosine similarity search techniques in the same code.
Predicting News Category Using Embedding
This example will introduce a zero-shot news classifier that predicts the category of a news article.
We always start with this code snippet:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
import pandas as pd
4
from openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding
5
from openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity

9
for line in env:
10
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
11
os.environ[key] = value
12
13
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
14
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
15
16
init_api()
We are then going to define a list of categories:

Advanced Embedding Examples
113
1
categories = [
2
'U.S. NEWS',
3
'COMEDY',
4
'PARENTING',
5
'WORLD NEWS',
6
'CULTURE & ARTS',
7
'TECH',
8
'SPORTS'
9
]
The choice of categories is not arbitrary. We are going to see why we made this choice later.
Next, we are going to write a function that classifies a sentence as part of one of the above categories:
1
# Define a function to classify a sentence
2
def classify_sentence(sentence):

return max(similarity_scores, key=similarity_scores.get)
Here’s what each part of the function does:
1. sentence_embedding = get_embedding(sentence, engine="text-embedding-ada-002"): This
line uses the OpenAI get_embedding function to obtain the embedding of the input sentence.
The engine="text-embedding-ada-002" argument specifies which OpenAI model to use for
the embedding.
2. category_embeddings = get_embedding(category, engine="text-embedding-ada-002"): We
obtain the embedding of the current category inside the for loop.
3. similarity_scores[category]
=
cosine_similarity(sentence_embedding,
category_embeddings): We calculate the cosine similarity between the sentence embedding
and the category embedding, and store the result in the similarity_scores dictionary.
4. return max(similarity_scores, key=similarity_scores.get): We return the category with
the highest similarity score. The max function finds the key (category) with the maximum value
(similarity score) in the similarity_scores dictionary.
We can now classify some sentences:

Evaluating the Accuracy of a Zero-Shot Classifier
It looks like the previous classifier is almost perfect but there is a way to understand if it is really
accurate and generate an accuracy score.
We are going to start by downloading this dataset from Kaggle²⁸ and saving it under data/News_-
Category_Dataset_v3.json.
This dataset contains around 210k news headlines from 2012 to 2022 from HuffPost²⁹. The dataset
classifies the headlines of each article into a category.
The categories used in the dataset are the same as we used previously (hence my initial choice):
²⁸https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset
²⁹https://www.huffingtonpost.com/

We are going to use the sklearn.metrics.precision_score function which calculates the precision
score.
The precision is the ratio tp / (tp + fp) where tp is the number of true positives and fp is the
number of false positives. The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as
positive a sample that is negative.
Let’s see how.
1
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
2
def evaluate_precision(categories):
3
# Load the dataset
4
df = pd.read_json("data/News_Category_Dataset_v3.json", lines=True).head(20)
5
y_true = []
6
y_pred = []
7
8
# Classify each sentence
9
for _, row in df.iterrows():
10
true_category = row['category']
11
predicted_category = classify_sentence(row['headline'])
12
13
y_true.append(true_category)
14
y_pred.append(predicted_category)
15
16
# Uncomment the following line to print the true and false predictions
\
17
18
# if true_category != predicted_category:
19
#
print("False prediction: {:50} True: {:20} Pred: {:20}".format(row['he\

20
adline'], true_category, predicted_category))
21
# else:
22
#
print("True prediction: {:50} True: {:20} Pred: {:20}".format(row['hea\
23
dline'], true_category, predicted_category))
24
25
# Calculate the precision score
26
return precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='micro', labels=categories)
Let’s see what each line does:
1. df = pd.read_json("data/News_Category_Dataset_v3.json", lines=True).head(20): This
line reads the first 20 records of the News_Category_Dataset_v3.json dataset into a Pandas
DataFrame. The lines=True argument specifies that the file contains one JSON object per line.
For a better accuracy calculation, I would use more than 20 records. However, for this example,
I’m using only 20, feel free to use more records.
2. y_true = [] and y_pred = []: We initialize empty lists to store the true and predicted categories
for each sentence.
3. for _, row in df.iterrows():: We iterate over each row in the DataFrame.
4. true_category
=
row['category']
and
predicted_category
=
classify_-
sentence(row['headline']): These lines extract the true category from the current row
and use the classify_sentence function to predict the category of the headline in the current
row.
5. y_true.append(true_category) and y_pred.append(predicted_category): We append the
true and predicted categories to the y_true and y_pred lists.
6. return
precision_score(y_true,
y_pred,
average='micro',
labels=categories): This
line calculates the precision score of the predicted categories using scikit’s precision_score
function. The average='micro' argument specifies that the precision should be calculated
globally by counting the total number of true positives, false negatives, and false positives. The
labels=categories argument specifies the list of categories to use for precision calculation.
Note that micro can be macro, samples, weighted, or binary. The official documentation³⁰ explains
the difference between these average types.
Overall, the evaluate_precisionfunction loads a small subset of the News_Category_Dataset_-
v3.json dataset, uses the classify_sentence function to predict the category of each headline, and
calculates the precision of the predicted categories. The returned precision score represents the
accuracy of the classify_sentencefunction on this small subset of the dataset.
Once we combine all the components, the code will look like this:

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
Few Shot Learning
GPT-3 has been pre-trained using a tremendous amount of data from the open web, consisting of
billions of words. This has enabled it to become an incredibly powerful tool that is able to rapidly
learn new tasks given only a few examples. This is known as “few-shot learning,” and it has been a
revolutionary development in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
No doubt, there are plenty of powerful open-source few-shot learning projects available. To
implement few-shot learning projects, there are some robust Python libraries one can use:
• Pytorch – Torchmeta³¹: A collection of extensions and data-loaders for few-shot learning &
meta-learning in PyTorch³²
• Few Shot³³: A repository with clean, legible, and verified code to reproduce few-shot learning
research.
• FewRel³⁴: A large-scale few-shot relation extraction dataset, which contains more than one
hundred relations and tens of thousands of annotated instances across different domains.
• Few-Shot Object Detection (FsDet):³⁵ Contains the official few-shot object detection implemen-
tation of Simple Few-Shot Object Detection³⁶.
• Meta Transfer Learning³⁷: A framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting.
The aim of this project is to take advantage of multiple similar low-sample tasks to learn how
to modify a base learner for a new task with only a few labeled available samples.
• Prototypical Networks on the Omniglot Dataset³⁸: An implementation of “Prototypical Net-
works for Few-shot Learning” on a notebook in Pytorch****
• And more
The capability of “few-shot learning” allows GPT-3 to quickly comprehend instructions provided to
it, even with minimal data. In other words, GPT-3 can be programmed to complete tasks with only a
few examples as input. This opens up a new world of limitless possibilities for AI-driven applications
and domains.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
122
Improving Few Shot Learning
The fine-tuning principle is a process of improving few-shot learning by training on many more
examples than can fit in the prompt. This approach can be used to achieve better results on a wide
number of tasks:
• Increase the number of examples used
• Improve the accuracy of the results
• Broaden the range of tasks that can be completed
Once a model has been adjusted and improved, you no longer have to give examples when you ask
for something. This saves money and makes requests faster.
Fine-tuning is available for the main base models: davinci, curie, babbage, and ada.
Fine Tuning in Practice
Let’s move to a more practical part and see real examples.
Note that this section is an introduction, what we are going to do next is basic. Keep reading to
grasp the overall concepts but later in this guide, we are going to dive deeper into a more advanced
example.
Start by activating your Python virtual environment for development, then export your OpenAI API
key:
1
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
If you’re using Windows, you can the set command.
Let’s create a JSONL file. This is an example:
1
{"prompt":"When do I have to start the heater?", "completion":"Every day in the morn\
2
ing at 7AM. You should stop it at 2PM"}
3
{"prompt":"Where is the garage remote control?", "completion":"Next to the yellow do\
4
or, on the key ring"}
5
{"prompt":"Is it necessary to program the scent diffuser every day?", "completion":"\
6
The scent diffuser is already programmed, you just need to recharge it when its batt\
7
ery is low"}
JSONL, also known as newline-delimited JSON, is a useful format for storing structured data that
can be processed one record at a time. Our training data should be using JSONL format.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
123
It is essential to provide at least two hundred examples for training. Moreover, doubling the dataset
size results in a linear improvement in model quality.
We are using 3 lines in our JSONL file, so the resulting model will not perform well, but we are
testing things out and we want to see how it works in practice for now.
1
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data.json
2
Analyzing...
3
4
- Your JSON file appears to be in a JSONL format. Your file will be converted to JSO\
5
NL format
6
- Your file contains 3 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at l\
7
east a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase\
8
for every doubling of the number of examples
9
- All prompts end with suffix `?`
10
- Your data does not contain a common ending at the end of your completions. Having \
11
a common ending string appended to the end of the completion makes it clearer to the\
12
fine-tuned model where the completion should end. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/\
13
guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples.
14
- The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produ\
15
ce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/g\
16
uides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details
17
18
Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
19
- [Necessary] Your format `JSON` will be converted to `JSONL`
20
- [Recommended] Add a suffix ending `\n` to all completions [Y/n]: Y
21
- [Recommended] Add a whitespace character to the beginning of the completion [Y/n]:\
22
Y
23
24
Your data will be written to a new JSONL file. Proceed [Y/n]: Y
25
26
Wrote modified file to `data_prepared.jsonl`
27
Feel free to take a look!
28
29
Now use that file when fine-tuning:
30
> openai api fine_tunes.create -t "data_prepared.jsonl"
31
32
After you’ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indic\
33
ator string `?` for the model to start generating completions, rather than continuin\
34
g with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=["\n"]` so that the generated texts en\
35
ds at the expected place.
36
Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 2.48 minutes to train a `c\
37
urie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an\
38
hour per job ahead of you.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
124
The CLI will create a file named “<your_filename>_prepared.jsonl”. We are going to use it next:
1
openai api fine_tunes.create -t "data_prepared.jsonl" -m curie
You could use curie, or any other base model (davinci, babbage, or ada).
When the fine-tuning is done, which could take some time, the CLI will print the name of the new
model you created.
Example:
1
Job complete! Status: succeeded ￿
2
Try out your fine-tuned model:
3
4
openai api completions.create -m curie:ft-learninggpt-2023-02-18-08-38-08 -p <YOUR_P\
5
ROMPT>
Note that the operation could be interrupted for some reason, in this case, you need to resume it
using the following command:
1
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>
You can now list your fine-tuned models using:
1
openai api fine_tunes.list
You can now use the model:
1
export FINE_TUNED_MODEL="<FINE_TUNED_MODEL>"
2
openai api completions.create -m $FINE_TUNED_MODEL -p <YOUR_PROMPT>
If you want to use Python, nothing changes from what we previously learned, except the mode id
(FINE_TUNED_MODEL)

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
125
1
openai.Completion.create(
2
model=FINE_TUNED_MODEL,
3
prompt=YOUR_PROMPT
4
# additional parameters
5
# temperature,

2
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
3

4
-d '{"prompt": YOUR_PROMPT, "model": FINE_TUNED_MODEL}'
If you want to analyze the model, run:
1
openai api fine_tunes.results -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>
The output should be in CSV.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
126
1
openai api fine_tunes.create -t data.jsonl -m <engine> \
2
--suffix "my_model_name"
Finally, you can delete the model:
1
# CLI
2
openai api models.delete -i <FINE_TUNED_MODEL>
3
4
# Python
5
openai.Model.delete(FINE_TUNED_MODEL)

7
# cURL
8
curl -X "DELETE" https://api.openai.com/v1/models/<FINE_TUNED_MODEL> \
9
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
This was a small and quick test to understand how everything works. The fine-tuned model is not
very performant for two reasons: firstly, because the dataset is small, and secondly, because we didn’t
apply the best practices.
We are going to see more advanced examples later in this guide but we need to understand the best
practices first.
Datasets, Prompts, and Completions: What are the
Best Practices?
Each Prompt Should End With a Fixed Separator
For the model to accurately recognize the end of a prompt and the beginning of completion text, it
is important to include a fixed separator. A commonly used separator is \n\n###\n\n, which should
not be used elsewhere in the prompt. This will help ensure the model generates the desired output.
In our advanced example, we are going to see how we use the separator to make the model better.
Each Completion Should Start With a Whitespace
When using OpenAI’s tokenizer, it is important to note that each completion must begin with
whitespace. This is because the tokenizer primarily uses whitespace to tokenize most words.
Therefore, starting with whitespace ensures that the tokenizer can accurately tokenize the text. It is
crucial to keep this in mind to ensure that the tokenizer functions properly and produces the desired
results.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
127
Each Completion Should End With a Fixed-Stop Sequence
Like prompts, each completion should be marked with a stop sequence to indicate the end of the
completion. The stop sequence can be any token that is not used within the completion, such as \n
or ###. For inference, you should format your prompts in the same way as you did when creating
the training dataset, including the same separator. Also, specify the same stop sequence to properly
truncate the completion.
Fine-Tuning Performs Better With More High-Quality Examples
For optimizing a model to perform better than the base models by using high-quality prompts, you
need to provide a minimum of a few hundred high-quality examples that are preferably evaluated
by human experts, as recommended by OpenAI in their official documentation.
Based on tests done by OpenAI, as the number of examples increases exponentially, performance
tends to improve linearly. Therefore, increasing the number of examples is the most dependable and
effective method of enhancing model performance.
Write Better Prompts and Completions
According to OpenAI, the following training dataset:
1
{"prompt": "Product is a laptop. Brand is Dell. Model is Inspiron. RAM is 8GB. Hard \
2
drive is 256GB SSD.->", "completion": " The Dell Inspiron laptop comes equipped with\
3

Converting the input data into natural language will likely result in better performance. This is even
clearer when you are building a generative model.
Review Your Data for Offensive Content
When fine-tuning on an existing dataset rather than creating prompts from scratch, it’s important
to manually review the data for offensive or inaccurate content, especially if you are building an
application that is publically used.
If for some reason, you find yourself unable to review the entire dataset, there are still steps you
can take to ensure a representative sample is evaluated. One approach is to review as many random
samples as possible. By doing so, you can still gain insights into the data and identify any patterns
or trends that may be present.
Review the Type and Structure of Your Dataset
It is crucial to ensure that the dataset used for fine-tuning is similar in structure and type of task
as what the model will be used for, and obviously, it should contain a sufficient amount of relevant
data to improve the model’s performance.
Fine-tuning a model with a dataset that is dissimilar or insufficient may lead to suboptimal results.
Analyze Your Model
We analyze a model using the command openai api fine_tunes.results -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_-
JOB_ID>. The result is in CSV, like we have seen previously. Here is an explanation of each column:
1. “step”: This column shows the training step number or the number of iterations of the training
process.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
129
2. “elapsed_tokens”: Shows the number of tokens processed by the training process so far. A token
is a unit of text, such as a word or a punctuation mark.
3. “elapsed_examples”: This is the number of examples (i.e., pieces of text) processed by the
training process so far.
4. “training_loss”: This number shows the value of the loss function during training. (The loss
function is a measure of how well the model is performing, with lower values indicating better
performance.)
5. “training_sequence_accuracy”: The accuracy of the model in predicting the next sequence of
tokens. (A sequence is a group of tokens that form a meaningful unit, such as a sentence or a
paragraph.)
6. “training_token_accuracy”: This value tells us about the accuracy of the model in predicting
individual tokens.
Generally, the goal of a training process is to minimize the training loss while maximizing the
accuracy of the training sequence and tokens. These measures show that the model can create great
natural language text.
Some third-party tools, such as wandb⁴⁰, can also be used to analyze the results.
Use Validation Data if Needed
You can consider setting aside some of your data for validation. This way you can keep an eye on
how your model is doing while you train it.
In the OpenAI CLI, you can create a validation file with the same format as your training file and
include it when creating a fine-tuning job using the “openai api fine_tunes.create” command.
For example, you can create a validation file named “validation_data.jsonl” and include it in your
fine-tuning job with the following command:
1
openai api fine_tunes.create -t train_data.jsonl -v validation_data.jsonl -m <engine\
2
>
During training, the OpenAI CLI will periodically calculate metrics on batches of validation data
and include them in the results file. The validation metrics that are generated include:
• validation_loss: The loss on the validation batch
• validation_sequence_accuracy: The percentage of completions in the validation batch for
which the model’s predicted tokens matched the true completion tokens exactly
• validation_token_accuracy: The percentage of tokens in the validation batch that were cor-
rectly predicted by the model

Fine Tuning & Best Practices

Tweak the Hyperparameters
In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter that controls the learning process, while the
values of other parameters (usually node weights) are determined through training.
OpenAI has configured default hyperparameters values that are suitable for various use cases.
However, adjusting the hyperparameters during fine-tuning can result in a better-quality output
from the model.
These are some of them:
• n_epochs: This represents the number of times the training algorithm will cycle through the
entire dataset. Using more epochs can improve the model’s performance, but it may also cause
overfitting to the training data. Generally speaking, overfitting occurs when a model becomes
too focused on the specific details and variations within the training data, causing it to perform
poorly when presented with new data. Essentially, the model ends up learning the noise and
other irrelevant factors within the training data as if they were actual concepts.
• batch_size: A larger batch size can speed up training, but it may also require more memory
and reduce the model’s generalization performance. The default OpenAI batch size is around
0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at 256. The batch size is the number
of examples that the model trains on in each iteration (a single forward and backward pass).
If you are unfamiliar with this concept, the following example provides a simple illustration:
Imagine you are learning how to solve math problems. Batch size is like how many problems
your teacher gives you at once to work on before checking your answers. If you have a lot of
problems to work on, it might be hard to do them all at once, so your teacher might give you a
few at a time. The same is true for training a machine learning model. Batch size is how many
examples the model works on at once before checking if it’s right or wrong. If you have a lot
of examples, the model might need to work on them a few at a time, just like you might work
on a few math problems at a time.
• learning_rate_multiplier: This parameter determines the fine-tuning learning rate, which is
the original learning rate used for pre-training multiplied by this multiplier. The OpenAI API
sets this parameter based on the batch size, and it defaults to 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2.
To understand better this parameter, let’s examine other concepts first.
In Machine Learning, the “minimum” is the lowest point of a mathematical function that is used
to measure how well the model is performing. The goal of the learning algorithm is to adjust
the model’s parameters so that it can reach this minimum point and achieve the best possible
performance. However, if the learning rate is set too high, the model may overshoot the minimum
and end up oscillating around it or even diverging away from it. This can cause the model to make
incorrect predictions and reduce its overall performance. To prevent the model from overshooting
the minimum, it is important to choose the best learning rate that balances the speed of learning
with the stability of the model. Testing is your friend since different learning rates may work better
for different types of datasets or models.

Fine Tuning & Best Practices
131
• compute_classification_metrics: This metric is specific to fine-tuning for classification tasks.
If set to True, it computes classification-specific metrics (such as accuracy⁴¹ and F-1 score⁴²)
on the validation set at the end of every epoch. These metrics can help you evaluate the
performance of the model and make adjustments as needed.
It’s worth noting that the time required to train and test a model can be significantly impacted by
the choice of its hyperparameters. This is because the selection of hyperparameters can influence
the complexity of the model and its ability to generalize to new data.
Use Ada
When tackling classification problems, the Ada model is a good option. It performs only slightly
worse than Davinci once fine-tuned, at the same time it is considerably faster and more affordable.
Use Single-Token Classes
Let’s say you are classifying sentences into some categories. Consider this example:
1
{prompt:"The Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA championship last year.", completion: "s\
2
ports and entertainment"}
3
{prompt:"Apple is set to release a new iPhone model in the coming months.", completi\
4
on: "technology and science"}
5
{prompt:"The United States Congress passed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.", c\
6
ompletion: "politics and government"}
7
{prompt:"The Tokyo Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", c\
8
ompletion: "sports and entertainment"}
9
{prompt:"Tesla's market capitalization surpassed that of Toyota in 2020.", completio\
10
n: "technology and science"}
11
{prompt:"Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on Jan\
12
uary 20, 2021.", completion: "politics and government"}
13
{prompt:"Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open tennis tournament for the ninth time\
14

15
{prompt:"Facebook was fined $5 billion by the US Federal Trade Commission for privac\

17
{prompt:"The UK officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020.", completion\
18
: "politics and government"}
19
{prompt:"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the Super Bowl in 2021, led by quarterback Tom\
20

• sports and entertainment
• technology and science
• politics and government
Instead of using them as classes names, it is wiser to use a single token like:
• 1 (for sports and entertainment)
• 2 (for technology and science)
• 3 (for politics and government)

Other Considerations for Classification
• Ensure that the prompt and completion combined do not exceed 2048 tokens, including the
separator.
• Try to provide at least 100 examples for each class.
• The separator should not be used within the prompt text. You should remove it from the prompt
if it’s the case. Example: If your separator is !#! you should preprocess the text of the prompt
to remove any !#!

Advanced Fine Tuning: Drug
Classification
Dataset Used in the Example
In this example, we are going to use a public dataset containing drug names and the corresponding
malady, illness, or condition that they are used to treat.
We are going to create a model and “teach” it to predict the output based on user input.
The user input is the name of the drug and the output is the name of the malady.
The dataset is available at Kaggle.com, you will need to download using the following URL:
1
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saratchendra/medicine-recommendation/download?datase\
2
tVersionNumber=1
Alternatively, go to the following URL:
1
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saratchendra/medicine-recommendation
Then download the file called Medicine_description.xlsx
The file contains 3 sheets, we are going to use the first one called “Sheet1” in which there are 3
columns:
• Drug_Name
• Reason
• Description
We are going to use the first and second columns as they contain the name of the drug and the
reason for which it is recommended.
For example:

Advanced Fine Tuning: Drug Classification
135
1
A CN Gel(Topical) 20gmA CN Soap 75gm ==> Acne
2
PPG Trio 1mg Tablet 10'SPPG Trio 2mg Tablet 10'S
==> Diabetes
3
Iveomezoled 200mg Injection 500ml
==> Fungal
Preparing the Data and Launching the Fine Tuning
The data file is an XLSX file. We are going to convert it to JSONL format (JSON Lines.)
The JSONL file will be used for fine-tuning the model.
We are also going to use this format:
1
{"prompt":"Drug: <DRUG NAME>\nMalady:","completion":" <MALADY NAME>"}
As you can see, we will be using \nMalady: as a separator.
The completion will also start with a whitespace. Remember to start each completion with a
whitespace due to tokenization (most words are tokenized with preceding whitespace.)
Also, we have learned that each completion should end with a fixed stop sequence to inform the
model when the completion ends. for example \n, ###, END, or any other token that does not appear
in the completion.
However, in our case, this is not necessary as we are going to use a single token for classification.
Basically, we are going to give each malady a unique identifier. For example:
1
Acne: 1
2
Allergies: 2
3
Alzheimer: 3
4
..etc
This way, the model will return a single token at inference time in all cases. This is the reason why
the stop sequence is not necessary.
To begin, use Pandas to transform the data into the desired format.

Advanced Fine Tuning: Drug Classification
136
1
import pandas as pd
2
3
# read the first n rows
4
n = 2000
5
6
df = pd.read_excel('Medicine_description.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1', header=0, nrows\
7
=n)
8
9
# get the unique values in the Reason column
10
reasons = df["Reason"].unique()
11
12
# assign a number to each reason
13
reasons_dict = {reason: i for i, reason in enumerate(reasons)}
14
15
# add a new line and ### to the end of each description
16
df["Drug_Name"] = "Drug: " + df["Drug_Name"] + "\n" + "Malady:"
17
18
# concatenate the Reason and Description columns
19
df["Reason"] = " " + df["Reason"].apply(lambda x: "" + str(reasons_dict[x]))
20
21
# drop the Reason column
22
df.drop(["Description"], axis=1, inplace=True)
23
24
# rename the columns
25
df.rename(columns={"Drug_Name": "prompt", "Reason": "completion"}, inplace=True)
26
27
# convert the dataframe to jsonl format
28
jsonl = df.to_json(orient="records", indent=0, lines=True)
29
30
# write the jsonl to a file
31
with open("drug_malady_data.jsonl", "w") as f:
32
f.write(jsonl)
The code above sets the number of rows to read from the Excel file to 2000. This means that we are
going to use a dataset of 2000 drug names to fine-tune the model. You can use more.
The script starts by reading the first n rows of data from the Excel file ‘Medicine_description.xlsx’
and stores it in a data frame called df.
It then gets the unique values in the ‘Reason’ column of the data frame, stores them in an array
called reasons, assigns a numerical index to each unique value in the reasons array, and stores it in
a dictionary called reasons_dict.
The script adds a new line and “Malady:” to the end of each drug name in the ‘Drug_Name’ column

Advanced Fine Tuning: Drug Classification
137
of the data frame. It concatenates a space and the corresponding numerical index from the reasons_-
dict to the end of each ‘Reason’ value in the data frame.
This is done to get the desired format:
1
Drug: <DRUG NAME>\nMalady:
For this example, we don’t need the ‘Description’ column, that’s why the script drops it from the
data frame. It continues by renaming the ‘Drug_Name’ column to ‘prompt’ and the ‘Reason’ column
to ‘completion’.
The data frame is converted to JSONL format and stored in a variable called jsonl that is written
to a file called ‘drug_malady_data.jsonl’.
This is how the “drug_malady_data.jsonl” looks like:
1
[..]
2
{"prompt":"Drug: Acleen 1% Lotion 25ml\nMalady:","completion":" 0"}
3
[..]
4
{"prompt":"Drug: Capnea Injection 1ml\nMalady:","completion":" 1"}
5
[..]
6
{"prompt":"Drug: Mondeslor Tablet 10'S\nMalady:","completion":" 2"}
7
[..]
Let’s now move to the next step by executing the following command:
1
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f drug_malady_data.jsonl
This will help us prepare the data and understand how it will be ingested by the model:

When a user asks the bot about a drug, the chatbot will reply with the name of the malady, defines
it, and give additional information when possible.
The goal is to make the classification more human friendly, in other words, we are going to create a
chatbot.
How Will Everything Work?
The chatbot assistant should initiate a regular conversation with the user. As long as the user
continues a regular conversation, the chatbot assistant will continue responding. Until the user asks
about a drug name. In this case, the chatbot assistant will reply with the name of the corresponding
malady.
We are going to define 3 functions:
• regular_discussion(): This function returns a response from the API using Davinci whenever
the user is talking about a regular topic. If the user asks about a drug, the function will call
get_malady_name().
• get_malady_name(): Returns a malady name that corresponds to a drug name from the fine-
tuned model. Also, the function will call get_malady_description() to get a description of the
malady.
• get_malady_description(): Get a description of a malady from the API using Davinci and
returns it.
The end user, when asking about a drug name will get the malady (from the fine-tuned model) and
its description (from Davinci).
Let’s write the first function:

In order to cut down unuseful conversations and avoid providing medical advice using the same
function, we used a long prompt in which the assistant is described as being helpful, creative, clever,
friendly, and careful with human health topics. However, it is emphasized that the AI assistant is
not a doctor or a pharmacist and does not diagnose or treat medical conditions or provide medical
advice, diagnosis, treatment, or prescriptions. If the human writes the name of a drug, the assistant
will reply with ######. When this happens, we call the second function.
Let’s write it here:

As seen in the previous chapter, this code returns a malady name that corresponds to a drug name

Creating a Conversational Web App
We can use the same approach to create a conversational chatbot and deploy it in the form of a web
app. In this part, we are going to build one using Vue.js and Flask.
If you are not familiar with Vue, it’s an approachable framework and easy to learn. Also, we are not
going to create a complex front end. Therefore, there is no real need to be a Vue expert to understand
what we will do. Let’s start!
Install Vue.js:

Advanced Fine Tuning: Creating a Chatbot Assistant
150
1
npm install -g @vue/cli
We are going to create a folder for the backend and one for the frontend:
1
mkdir chatbot chatbot/server
2
cd chatbot
3
vue create client
Add a router to the frontend. A router is a tool that allows us to navigate between different pages
in a single page application.
1
cd client
2
vue add router
Install axios, a library that allows us to make HTTP requests to the backend from the frontend:
1
npm install axios --save
Create a virtual development environment, activate it, and install the dependencies:
1
pip install Flask==2.2.3 Flask-Cors==3.0.10
Create a file called app.py in the server folder and add the following code:
1
from flask import Flask, jsonify
2
from flask_cors import CORS
3
from flask import request
4
import os
5
import openai
6
7
# configuration

DEBUG = True
9
10
# instantiate the app
11
app = Flask(__name__)
12
app.config.from_object(__name__)

# enable CORS

I suppose your Flask app uses port 5000, otherwise change the port in the code above to the right
one.
The above code creates a simple chatbot interface. The sendMessage() method sends the user’s
message to the server and gets a response from the server. The response is then displayed in the
chatbot interface.
The HomeView.vue file is the default view for the / route. To create the AboutView.vue file, run the
following command:
1
touch client/src/views/AboutView.vue
Open the AboutView.vue file and add the following code:
1
<template>
2
<div class="about">
3
<h1>This is an about page</h1>
4
</div>
5
</template>
The above code creates a simple about page.
To run the chatbot, run the following commands:

1
cd server
2
python app.py
1
cd client
2
npm run serve
Open the browser and go to http://localhost:<PORT>/ to see the chatbot in action, where <PORT>
is the port number specified on the command line when you ran npm run serve.
We have now created a simple chatbot that can answer questions about drugs.

Intelligent Speech Recognition Using
OpenAI Whisper
What is Whisper?
Whisper is an ASR system (automatic speech recognition) and a general-purpose speech recognition
model trained by OpenAI on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected
from the web.
OpenAI reports that using a large, varied data set has increased robustness to accents, background
noise, and technical terminology. Furthermore, it has enabled transcription in multiple languages,
as well as translation from those languages into English.
The model and inference code were open-sourced by OpenAI and can be found on GitHub.
There are five model sizes, four of which have English-only versions. Each model offers a tradeoff
between speed and accuracy. The names of the models, along with their approximate memory
requirements and relative speeds, are listed below.

How to Get Started?
You’ll need to have Python ≥3.8 installed. Activate your development virtual environment and
install Whisper using the following command:
1
pip install -U openai-whisper
You also need to install “ffmpeg on your system:
On Ubuntu or Debian
1
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
on Arch Linux
1
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
on MacOS using Homebrew
1
brew install ffmpeg
on Windows using Chocolatey
1
choco install ffmpeg
on Windows using Scoop
1
scoop install ffmpeg
You may have this error No module named 'setuptools_rust' later, so remember that you need to
install “Rust” in this case.
1
pip install setuptools-rust
Let’s download any audio file containing a speech to test with. You can find many files on
Wikipedia⁴⁵. For example:
⁴⁵https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Audio_files_of_speeches

161
1
wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Winston_Churchill_-_Be_Ye_M\
2
en_of_Valour.ogg
Then execute the Whisper command using the base model:
1
whisper Winston_Churchill_-_Be_Ye_Men_of_Valour.ogg
--model base
You can choose another model. The better the model, the higher CPU and disk will be needed.
For example:
1
whisper Winston_Churchill_-_Be_Ye_Men_of_Valour.ogg
--model medium
In both cases, you should be able to see the text of the speech:
1
[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]
I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister [..]
2
[00:08.320 --> 00:14.880]

3
[00:16.640 --> 00:20.240]

Transcribe and Translate
The model is also able to translate speech.

For example, let’s take this Russian speech:
1
wget https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Lenin_-_What_Is_Soviet_Powe\
2
r.ogg
Then execute:

Intelligent Speech Recognition Using OpenAI Whisper
162
1
whisper Lenin_-_What_Is_Soviet_Power.ogg --language Russian --task translate
You should be able to view the translation line-by-line.
1
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]
What is Soviet power?
2
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.000]
What is the essence of this new power,
3
[00:06.000 --> 00:11.000]
which cannot be understood in most countries?
4
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]
The essence of it is attracting workers.
5
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]
In each country, more and more people stand up
6
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]
to the Prime Minister of the State,
7
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]
such as other rich or capitalists,
8
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]
and now for the first time control the state.
There are some parameters you can play with and test whether for transcription or translation. For
example, we can increase the temperature and the number of candidates when sampling to get
different results.
This is an example:
1
whisper Lenin_-_What_Is_Soviet_Power.ogg --language Russian --task translate --best_\
2
of 20
Let’s examine the output. Notice the difference between this translation and the first one.
1
[00:00.000 --> 00:06.200]
what Soviet power is, what is the integrity of these new \
2
authorities,
3
[00:06.280 --> 00:11.140]
which cannot, or do not, successfully resolve in a govern\
4
ment?
5
[00:11.540 --> 00:15.540]
The integrity of it attracts its workers,
6
[00:15.660 --> 00:19.260]
the Garze country is getting more and more,
7
[00:19.320 --> 00:25.580]
with the greater state control than other rich or capital\
8
ists.
9
[00:25.680 --> 00:29.020]
This is the first time the￿is controlled in a state.
By default, the temperature is set to 0. The number of candidates only works when the temperature
is different from 0 and is by default 5.
Use the following command to find out the other options of the CLI:
1
whisper -h
Note that it is possible to use the Whisper module in a Python application. This is what we are going
to see in the advanced examples.

Context & Memory: Making AI More
Real
The Problem
GPT is a generative text model which means that produces new text by predicting what comes next
based on the input it gets from the user. The model was trained on a large corpus of text (books,
articles, and websites) and it used this data and learned patterns and relationships between words
and phrases.
By default, the model has no memory when you initiate a discussion with it. This means each
input is treated independently without any context or information carried over from the previous
user prompts. This is certainly not ideal for human-friendly interactions. While this seems like a
limitation, it actually allows the model to generate more diverse and less repetitive text.
In some cases, carrying over context is useful and necessary. Some techniques like fine-tuning on
a specific topic help in improving the quality of outputs, the other technique that we are going to
implement next is much easier to implement.
No Context = Chaos of Randomness
Let’s start by building a simple chatbot, initially, we are going to initiate a discussion as our goal is
to compare the outputs of the model now and later when we add more context to the conversation.

max_tokens=100,
29
stop=[" You:", " AI:"]
30
)
31
32
print("AI:", response.choices[0].text)
The following test shows that by default, the chat agent we built doesn’t have any memory:
1
You: Hey
2
AI:
Hey! How can I help you today?
3
You: Remember this string 'blah' and store it. I'll ask you about it later.
4
AI:
Sure, I remember the string 'blah'.
5
You: What was the string?
6
AI:
I'm not sure what you mean - can you elaborate?
7
You: What was the string I told you to remember?
8
AI:
I'm sorry, I don't remember any strings you told me.
9
You: I already told you!
10
AI:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you please explain the context of the las\
11
t message?
History = Context
The idea is pretty simple, and it works by creating a history variable where we store the request
of the user and the text generated by the model. When the user asks a new question, the history is
inserted before the new question.

28

32
33
response_text = response.choices[0].text
34
history += "You: "+ prompt + "\n" + "AI: " + response_text + "\n"
35
36
print("AI: " + response_text)
This is how the same discussion went:

166

You: Hey
2
AI:
Hi there! How are you?
3
You: Remember this string 'blah' and store it. I'll ask you about it later.
4
AI:
Got it! What would you like to know about 'blah'?
5
You: What was the string?
6
AI:
The string was 'blah'.
7
You: Why?
8
AI:
You asked me to remember the string 'blah' and store it, so I did.
The Problem with Carrying Over History
With long discussions, the user prompt will be longer since it will always be added to the history
until the point when it reaches the maximum number of tokens allowed by OpenAI. In this case, the
result is a total failure, as the API will respond with errors.
The second problem here is the cost. You are charged by tokens, so the more tokens you have in your
input, the more expensive it will be.
Last in First out (LIFO) Memory
I am not sure if this approach has a technical name, but I called it “last in first out” since the idea
behind it is simple:
• Users will always initiate discussions with a context.
• Context evolves and the discussion too.
• Users will most likely include the context in the latest 2 to 5 prompts.
Based on this, we could assume that a better approach is to only store the most recent prompts.
This is how it works in a few words: We create a text file where we will store the history, then we
store the historical prompts and answers separated by a separator that is not found in the discussion.
For example: #####
Then we retrieve the last 2 and add them to the user prompt as a context. Instead of a text file, you
can use a PostgreSQL database, a Redis database, or whatever you want.
Let’s take a look at the code:

The Problem with Last in First out Memory
This approach I called the Last in First out memory may struggle when a discussion becomes very
complex, and the user needs to switch back and forth between different contexts. In such cases,
the approach may not be able to provide the required context to the user as it only stores the most
recent prompts. This can lead to confusion and frustration for the user, which is not ideal for human-
friendly interactions.
Selective Context
The solution suggested in this part will work as follows:
• An initial prompt is saved to a text file
• The user enters a prompt
• The program creates embeddings for all interactions in the file
• The program creates embeddings for the user’s prompt
• The program calculates the cosine similarity between the user’s prompt and all interactions in
the file
• The program sorts the file by the cosine similarity
• The best n interactions are read from the file and sent with the prompt to the user
We are using a text file here to make things simple, but as said previously, you can use any data
store.
These are the different functions we are going to use to perform the above:

Here is what sort_history function does, explained step by step:
1. Split the history into segments: The function first splits the input history string into segments
based on the specified separator (in our example, we will use ##### which we will declare later).
This creates a list of segments representing each interaction in history.
2. Compute the cosine similarity: For each segment, the function computes the cosine similarity
between the user’s input and the segment using the cos_sim function. The cosine similarity
measures the similarity between two vectors as we have seen in the previous chapters.
Although we could have used OpenAI embedding, our goal is to reduce computing costs by
performing certain tasks locally instead of relying on the API.
3. Sort the similarities: The function sorts the similarities in ascending order using np.argsort,
which returns the indices of the sorted similarities in the order of their values. This creates a
list of indices representing the segments sorted by their similarity to the user’s input.
4. Reconstruct the sorted history: We iterate over the sorted indices in reverse order and
concatenate the corresponding segments together into a new string. This creates a new, sorted
history string in which the most similar interactions to the user’s input appear first.
5. Save the sorted history: Finally, we save the sorted history to a file using the save_history_-
to_file function.
This is how we used these functions after defining the initial prompts, the value of the separator and
saved the initial prompts to a file.

Introduction
We have seen how to use OpenAI to answer questions and extract text from speech using Whisper.
What if we combine these components and others to create an AI-based voice assistant?
The goal here is to use the GPT knowledge base to get answers to questions we may ask.
I use Alexa every day and it’s really helpful but its “intelligence” is limited. An intelligent voice
assistant would be helpful to answer complex questions and provide useful information.
This is how the whole system works:
• The user asks a question using their microphone. We will use Python SpeechRecognition⁴⁶.
• OpenAI Whisper automatically transcribes the question into a text.
• The text is passed to OpenAI GPT completions endpoints
• The OpenAI API returns an answer
• The answer is saved to an mp3 file and passed to Google Text to Speech (gTTS) to create a
voice response.
Certain elements of our code have been inspired by these files.
• https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/audio.py⁴⁷
• https://github.com/mallorbc/whisper_mic/blob/main/mic.py⁴⁸
Let’s see how to build one.
Recording the audio
This is the first step:

#load the speech recognizer and set the initial energy threshold and pause thres\

r = sr.Recognizer()

r.energy_threshold = energy

with sr.Microphone(sample_rate=16000) as source:
10
print("Listening...")
11
i = 0
12
while True:
13
#get and save audio to wav file
14
audio = r.listen(source)
15
# Using: https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/9f70
16

17
torch_audio = torch.from_numpy(np.frombuffer(audio.get_raw_data(), np.in\
18

19
audio_data = torch_audio
20
audio_queue.put_nowait(audio_data)
21
i += 1
The function above record_audio records audio from a microphone and saves it to a queue for
further processing.
The function takes four arguments:
• audio_queue: a queue object where the recorded audio will be saved.
• energy: an initial energy threshold for detecting speech.
• pause: a pause threshold for detecting when speech has ended.
• dynamic_energy: a Boolean indicating whether the energy threshold should be adjusted
dynamically based on the surrounding environment.
Within the function, a speech recognizer object is initialized with the given energy and pause thresh-
olds. The dynamic_energy_threshold attribute is set to dynamic_energy. Then, a with statement is
used to manage the acquisition and release of resources needed for recording audio. Specifically, a
microphone is initialized with a 16 kHz sample rate, and then the function enters an infinite loop.
During each iteration of the loop, the listen() method of the recognizer object is called to record
audio from the microphone. The recorded audio is converted into a PyTorch tensor, normalized to
a range of [-1, 1], and then saved to the audio_queue. Finally, the loop continues and the function
keeps recording audio until it is interrupted.

Transcribing the Audio
This is the function that uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the audio.
1
def transcribe_forever(audio_queue, result_queue, audio_model, english, wake_word, v\
2
erbose):
3
while True:
4
audio_data = audio_queue.get()
5
if english:
6
result = audio_model.transcribe(audio_data,language='english')
7
else:
8
result = audio_model.transcribe(audio_data)
9
10
predicted_text = result["text"]
11
12
if predicted_text.strip().lower().startswith(wake_word.strip().lower()):
13
pattern = re.compile(re.escape(wake_word), re.IGNORECASE)
14
predicted_text = pattern.sub("", predicted_text).strip()
15
punc = '''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''
16
predicted_text.translate({ord(i): None for i in punc})
17
if verbose:
18
print("You said the wake word.. Processing {}...".format(predicted_t\
19
ext))
20
result_queue.put_nowait(predicted_text)
21
else:
22
if verbose:
23
print("You did not say the wake word.. Ignoring")
The transcribe_forever function receives two queues: audio_queue, which contains the audio data
to be transcribed, and result_queue, which is used to store the transcribed text.
The function starts by getting the next audio data from the audio_queue using the audio_-
queue.get() method. If the english flag is set to True, the audio_model.transcribe() method is
called with the language='english' argument to transcribe the English language audio data. If the
english flag is set to False, the audio_model.transcribe() method is called without any language
argument, which allows the function to automatically detect the language of the audio.
The resulting result dictionary contains several keys, one of which is "text" which simply contains
the transcript of the audio.
The predicted_text variable is assigned the value of the "text" key. If the predicted_text string
starts with the wake_word, the function processes the text by removing the wake_word from the
start of the string using regular expressions. Additionally, punctuation marks are removed from
the predicted_text string.

Building Your AI-Based Alexa
178
When you say “Hey Computer <your request>”, it may sometimes be transcribed as “Hey Computer,
<your request>”. Since we are going to remove the wake word, what remains is “, <your request>”.
Therefore, we need to remove the comma (“,”). Similarly, if instead of the comma we have a point,
an exclamation mark, or a question mark, we need to remove it to only pass the request text.
If the verbose flag is set to True, a message is printed to indicate that the wake word was detected
and the text is being processed. Finally, the predicted_text string is added to the result_queue
using the result_queue.put_nowait() method.
If the predicted_text string does not start with the wake_word, and the verbose flag is set to True,
a message is printed to indicate that the wake word was not detected, and the text is being ignored.
Replying to User Request
We are going to use this function:
1
def reply(result_queue):
2
while True:
3
result = result_queue.get()
4
data = openai.Completion.create(
5
model="text-davinci-002",
6
prompt=result,
7
temperature=0,
8
max_tokens=150,
9
)
10
answer = data["choices"][0]["text"]
11
mp3_obj = gTTS(text=answer, lang="en", slow=False)
12
mp3_obj.save("reply.mp3")
13
reply_audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3("reply.mp3")
14
play(reply_audio)
15
os.remove("reply.mp3")
Here is a summary of what the function does:
1. The function loops continuously to wait for results from the result_queue passed as an
argument.
2. When a result is received, it is used as input to the language model (Davinci) to generate a
response. You are free to use any other available model. The openai.Completion.create()
method is called with the following arguments:
• model: the ID of the language model to use.
• prompt: the input text to use for generating the response.

Building Your AI-Based Alexa
179
• temperature: a hyperparameter that controls the degree of randomness in the generated
response. Here, it is set to 0, meaning that the response will be deterministic.
• max_tokens: the maximum number of tokens (words and punctuation) in the generated
response. Here, it is set to 150.
1. The response generated by the language model is extracted from the data object returned by
the openai.Completion.create() method. It is stored in the answer variable.
2. The gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) module is used to convert the generated text response into
an audio file. The gTTS method is called with the following arguments:
- text: the generated response text.
- lang: the language of the generated response. Here, it is set to English.
- slow: a boolean flag that determines whether the speech is slow or normal. Here, it is set to
False, meaning that the speech will be at a normal speed.
3. The audio file is saved to disk as “reply.mp3”.
4. The “reply.mp3” file is loaded into an AudioSegment object using the AudioSegment.from_mp3()
method.
5. The play() method from the pydub.playback module is used to play back the audio file to the
user.
6. The “reply.mp3” file is deleted using the os.remove() method.
The Main Function
Let’s write the main function that calls the 3 functions each in a separate thread:
1

Building Your AI-Based Alexa
180
18
#there are no english models for large
19
if model != "large" and english:
20
model = model + ".en"
21
audio_model = whisper.load_model(model)
22
audio_queue = queue.Queue()
23
result_queue = queue.Queue()
24
threading.Thread(target=record_audio, args=(audio_queue, energy, pause, dynamic_\
25
energy,)).start()
26
threading.Thread(target=transcribe_forever, args=(audio_queue, result_queue, aud\
27

28
threading.Thread(target=reply, args=(result_queue,)).start()
29
30
while True:
31
print(result_queue.get())
The main function defines a CLI function using the click library that accepts several options (such
as model, english, energy, wake_word, etc.) as command-line arguments.
It then loads an appropriate model for speech recognition using the specified options, creates a queue
to hold audio data, and starts three threads to run record_audio, transcribe_forever, and reply
functions concurrently. Finally, it prints the response text obtained from the result_queue to the
console indefinitely.

There are many things you can update and add to this prototype, for example, you can build a system
that creates embeddings for the user voice input, then based on that the program decides whether
they should connect to the API of OpenAI, connect to other APIs like your Google Calendar, your
Zapier or your Twitter.
You can take advantage of streaming the audio response to increasing the program’s speed, rather
than saving it to the disk. This can be done by setting up a server for the model, and a client for the
voice transmission. This will not only help to speed up the program, but it will also help to ensure
that the audio response has a higher quality and is more reliable.
Adding a cache could be a good idea too.
Implementing a stop word like “Hey computer. Stop” is also a good idea to immediately interrupt
the assistant without having to listen to the whole response.
Use your imagination.

Image Classification with OpenAI CLIP
What is CLIP?
CLIP or Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training is an efficient model that learns visual concepts
from natural language supervision. It can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply
providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, similar to the “zero-shot” capabilities
of GPT-2 and GPT-3.
The current deep-learning approaches to computer vision have some challenges and problems
including a narrow set of visual concepts taught by typical vision datasets and the poor performance
of models on stress tests. According to OpenAI, CLIP solves these problems.
This neural network was trained on a diverse set of images and can be instructed using natural
language in order to perform a variety of classification tasks without explicitly optimizing for the
task. This approach allows the model to generalize to a wider range of images and perform better
on unseen data, a property known as robustness. According to OpenAI, CLIP is able to close the
robustness gap by up to 75%, meaning that it can correctly classify images that traditional models
might struggle with.
An interesting fact is that CLIP has been developed by combining previous research on zero-shot
learning and natural language processing.
Zero-shot learning is a technique that allows machine learning models to recognize new objects
without having to be trained on examples of those objects. This approach has been further developed
by using natural language as a way to help the model understand what it’s looking at.
In 2013, researchers at Stanford used this approach to train a model to recognize objects in pictures
based on the words that people use to describe those objects. They were able to show that this model
could recognize objects that it had never seen before. Later that same year, another researcher built
on this work⁴⁹ and showed that it was possible to improve the accuracy of this approach by fine-
tuning an ImageNet⁵⁰ model to recognize new objects.
The CLIP model builds on this research to improve natural language-based image classification tasks
and help machines understand images in a more human-like way.
You can read more about CLIP in the official blog post⁵¹ introducing it.

How to Use CLIP
We are going to use a public domain image from Wikimedia Commons, which you can find on this
page⁵² among other images.
Alternatively, you can download the image directly using this command:

If a GPU is available, the device variable is set to “cuda”, which means the model will run on the
GPU. If no GPU is available, the device variable is set to “cpu”, which means the model will run on
the CPU.
CUDA is a toolkit that allows developers to speed up compute-intensive processes by using GPUs
for parallelized processing. By offloading compute workloads to GPUs, you can reduce the time it
takes to perform these tasks. The CPUs and GPUs work together to optimize the processing power
of the system. CUDA was created by NVIDIA⁵⁴.
Next, let’s load the model using the clip.loadfunction. This function takes two arguments:
• the name of the model to load,
• the device to run the model on.
The model name is ‘ViT-B/32’.
1
model, preprocess = clip.load('ViT-B/32', device=device)
Next, we load the image, preprocess and encode it using the CLIP model:
1
# Load an image
2
image = PIL.Image.open("../resources/ASTRONAUTS.jpg")
3
4
# Preprocess the image
5
image_input = preprocess(image).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
6
7
# Encode the image using the CLIP model
8
with torch.no_grad():
9
image_features = model.encode_image(image_input)
The preprocess function applies a set of standard image transformations to the input image ( resizing,
normalization..etc) to prepare it for input to the CLIP model.
The image after being preprocessed is converted to a PyTorch tensor, unsqueezed along the first
dimension to create a batch dimension, and moved to the device (either CPU or GPU) specified in
the device variable.
In order to feed the image into the CLIP model, we need to convert it into a tensor. The preprocess
function returns a tensor that is already in the correct format for input to the model, but it only
processes one image at a time. The model expects a batch of images as input, even if the batch size
is only one. To create a batch of size one, we need to add an extra dimension to the tensor along the
first axis (also known as the batch axis). This is what the unsqueeze(0) method does: it adds a new
dimension to the tensor at index 0.

In short, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers, and a PyTorch tensor is a specific type
of tensor used in deep learning. In our context, the input image is a 2D array of pixel values.
The with
torch.no_grad()block is used to ensure that no gradients are computed, which can
improve performance and reduce memory usage.
In machine learning, a gradient is a mathematical function that helps optimize a neural network.
PyTorch uses gradients to help train models. However, when we encode here using the CLIP model,
we don’t need to compute gradients because we’re not training the model. So, we use the with
torch.no_grad(): block to temporarily disable gradient; this is what why computation performance
is improved.
When PyTorch tracks the computation graph and stores intermediate results, it requires additional
memory and computational resources. By using with torch.no_grad():, we can reduce the memory
footprint and speed up the computation because PyTorch doesn’t need to store intermediate results
or compute gradients during this operation. This can be particularly important when encoding a
large number of text prompts, as it can improve performance and reduce memory usage.
Next, let’s define a list of prompts:
1
# Define a list of text prompts
2
prompts = [
3
"A large galaxy in the center of a cluster of galaxies located in the constellat\
4
ion Bostes",
5
"MTA Long Island Bus has just left the Hempstead Bus Terminal on the N6",
6
"STS-86 mission specialists Vladimir Titov and Jean-Loup Chretien pose for photo\
7
s in the Base Block",
8
"A view of the International Space Station (ISS) from the Soyuz TMA-19 spacecraf\
9
t, as it approaches the station for docking",
10
"A domesticated tiger in a cage with a tiger trainer in the background",
11
"A mechanical engineer working on a car engine",
12
]
We encode the prompts:
1
# Encode the text prompts using the CLIP model
2
with torch.no_grad():
3
text_features = model.encode_text(clip.tokenize(prompts).to(device))
Calculate the similarity between the image and each prompt:
1
# Calculate the similarity between the image and each prompt
2
similarity_scores = (100.0 * image_features @ text_features.T).softmax(dim=-1)
Finally, we print the prompt with the highest similarity score:

Image Classification with OpenAI CLIP
189
1
# Print the prompt with the highest similarity score
2
most_similar_prompt_index = similarity_scores.argmax().item()
3
most_similar_prompt = prompts[most_similar_prompt_index]
4
print("The image is most similar to the prompt: {}".format(most_similar_prompt))
This is the complete code:
1
import torch
2

Reverse Stable Diffusion: Image to Text
Some useful tool built using CLIP is CLIP Interrogator.
CLIP Interrogator is a prompt engineering tool that combines OpenAI’s CLIP and Salesforce’s BLIP⁵⁶
to optimize text prompts for a given image. The resulting prompt can be used with text-to-image
models, such as Stable Diffusion on DreamStudio, to create or reproduce images.
The usage is simple and straightforward:
1
from PIL import Image
2
from clip_interrogator import Config, Interrogator
3
image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
4
ci = Interrogator(Config(clip_model_name="ViT-L-14/openai"))
5
print(ci.interrogate(image))
Note that you need to install these packages first:
1
# install torch with GPU support for example:
2
pip3 install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu\
3
117

5
# install clip-interrogator
6
pip install clip-interrogator==0.5.4
BLIP is a framework for pre-training models to understand and generate both images and language.
It has achieved state-of-the-art results on many tasks that involve both vision and language.
According to Salesforce, BLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven vision-language tasks,
including:

Generating Images Using DALL-E
Introduction
Using deep learning techniques, the GPT model can create images based on a prompt or an existing
image.
The input image is changed using a set of instructions (algorithms) to create a new one. The model
can create many different kinds of images, from simple to complex, depending on what it is given
to work with.
One of the powerful features is that it can look at the images it created and get better at making
them more detailed and accurate. In other words, it can learn from its own image and become better
over time.

Generating Images Using DALL-E
193
Overall, the Images API provides three ways to interact with the images endpoint:

Generating Images Using DALL-E
194
• You can create images from scratch based on a text prompt.
• You can create edits to an existing image based on a new text prompt.
• You can create different variations of an existing image that you provide.
In recent years, OpenAI has trained a neural network called DALL-E, based on GPT-3. DALL-E is a
smaller version of GPT-3, with 12 billion parameters instead of 175 billion. It has been specifically
designed to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text-image pairs instead of a
very broad dataset like GPT-3.
To see it in action, you can use the DALL-E preview app⁵⁷.
In this part of the guide, we are going to see how we can use the API instead of the web interface.
Currently, the rate limit is set to 50 images per minute, but it can be increased by following the
instructions in this help center article⁵⁸.
A Basic Example of Image Generation From a Prompt
Let’s start with a first example:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
kwargs = {
16
"prompt": "A beautiful landscape.",
17
}
18
19
im = openai.Image.create(**kwargs)
20
21
print(im)
⁵⁷https://labs.openai.com/
⁵⁸https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6696591

Generating Images Using DALL-E
195
Basically, we are still following the same steps as before:
• Authentication
• Calling an API endpoint with a list of parameters.
In this example, we have put the parameters in the kwargs dict, but this changes nothing.
After executing the code above, you’ll get an output similar to the following one:
1
{
2
"created": 1675354429,
3
"data": [

12
]
13
}
Click on the URL to open the image.
Generating Multiple Images
By default, the API returns a single image, however, you can request up to 10 images at a time using
the n parameter. Let’s try 2 images:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12

Generating Images Using DALL-E
196
13
init_api()
14
15
prompt = "A beautiful landscape."
16
n = 2
17
18
kwargs = {
19
"prompt": prompt,
20
"n": n,
21
}
22
23
im = openai.Image.create(**kwargs)
24
25
print(im)
Note that we can print the image URL directly using:
1
for i in range(n):
2
print(im.data[i].url)
Using Different Sizes
It is worth noting that generated images can have 3 possible sizes:
• 256x256px
• 512x512px
• 1024x1024px
Obviously, the smaller the size is the faster the generation will be.
In order to generate images with a particular size, you need to pass the size parameter to the API:
1
import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")

Generating Images Using DALL-E
197
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13

14
15
prompt = "A beautiful landscape."
16
n = 1
17
size = "256x256"
18
19
kwargs = {
20
"prompt": prompt,
21
"n": n,
22
"size": size,
23
}
24
25
im = openai.Image.create(**kwargs)
26
27
for i in range(n):
28
print(im.data[i].url)
Better Image Prompts
Prompt engineering is a way to use artificial intelligence to understand natural language. It works by
changing tasks into prompts and teaching a language model to recognize the prompts. The language
model can be a large, already-trained model, and only the prompt needs to be learned.
In 2022, three AI platforms DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney were made available to
everyone. These platforms take prompts as input and create images, which has opened up a new
area of work in prompt engineering that focuses on turning words into images.
Using DALL-E, you can customize prompts to suit your tastes and needs. From light, art style, and
vibes, to positions and angles, there’s an endless number of possibilities.
We are going to take a look at some of them, but I invite you to explore the many other resources
available online and related to this topic including the free DALL·E 2 Prompt Book⁵⁹.
Some of the following prompts were inspired by the DALL-E 2 Prompt Book others were inspired
by multiple other sources including my own work.
Mimicking Artists
There’s a difference in the generated image between these two prompts:
⁵⁹https://dallery.gallery/the-dalle-2-prompt-book/

Generating Images Using DALL-E
198
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape"
2
prompt = "beautiful landscape by Van Gogh"
Obviously, the latter will be more likely to look like a Van Gogh painting.
The generated image could be a painting by Van Gogh, a cartoon-style image or an abstract artwork.
Note that you can simply use keywords separated by commas:
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape, Van Gogh"
We can, for example, use the modernist painting style of Agnes Lawrence Pelton.
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape by Agnes Lawrence Pelton"
Or, in the style of Masashi Kishimoto, the manga artist behind Naruto:
1
prompt = "A teenager by Masashi Kishimoto"
This way, you can customize the style of the generated image to fit your needs.
It is also possible to use other keywords related to the style you want, not necessarily artist:
1
prompt = "A teenager. Naruto manga style"

Atmosphere / Feelings / Vibes
By adding additional keywords that describe the atmosphere and the general vibe, you can create
more expressive images.
For example, you can evoke a peaceful atmosphere by adding:
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape with a peaceful atmosphere"
Or a mysterious atmosphere by adding:
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape with a mysterious atmosphere"
Similarly, you can evoke feelings of joy, sadness, hope, or fear.
For example, to evoke a feeling of hope:
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape with a feeling of hope"
Or a feeling of fear:
1
prompt = "beautiful landscape with a feeling of fear"
These are some random keywords you can try:

Building a Random Image Generator
There are more than what we already mentioned, but we have enough prompts to give a chance to
chance and build a random image generator using Python.
We are going to create multiple lists, each including a different set of prompts. The program may
randomly select a prompt from each list and combine them with the user prompt to create a single
prompt.
This is how it works:
1
# we define lists
2
list 1 = [keywords 11, keywords 12,..]
3
list 2 = [keywords 21, keywords 22,..]
4
list 3 = [keywords 31, keywords 32,..]
5
list 4 = [keywords 41, keywords 42,..]
6
..etc
7
8
# read the user prompt
9
user prompt = "lorem ipsum"
10

Generating Images Using DALL-E

# generate some random prompts
12
some generated prompts =
13
"user prompt" + "keywords 11" + "keywords 21" + "keywords 31" + "keywords 42"
14
"user prompt" + "keywords 12" + "keywords 22" + "keywords 32" + "keywords 41"
15
"user prompt" + "keywords 21"
16
"user prompt" + "keywords 32"
17
"user prompt" + "keywords 21" + "keywords 41"
18
"user prompt" + "keywords 22" + "keywords 42"
19
"user prompt" + "keywords 31" + "keywords 41"

Editing Images Using DALL-E
Using GPT DALL-E, it is possible to edit images.
The image edits endpoint allows you to modify and extend an image by uploading a mask.
The transparent sections of the mask specify precisely where the image should be edited. The user
should provide a prompt with a description to complete the missing part including the deleted part.
The example provided by the documentation of OpenAI is self-explanatory.
An example of Editing an Image
Let’s try an example.
Before that, there are some requirements, we need two images:
• The original image
• The mask
Both images should be in PNG format and have the same size. OpenAI has a restriction of 4MB on
the size of an image.
Images should also be square.
The image we are going to use is the following one:

Then, using an image editor, we can remove some parts of the image and save it to a file. Make sure
that the image has a transparency layer. The removed part should be transparent.
This is what we are going to use:

I named the first image without_mask.png and the second image mask.png and save them to a folder.
I want the model to edit the image using the mask and add a group of people hiking to it. This is
how to do it:

import os
2
import openai
3
4
def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
image = open("../resources/without_mask.png", "rb")
16
mask = open("../resources/mask.png", "rb")
17
prompt = "A group of people hiking in green forest between trees"
18
n = 1
19
size = "1024x1024"
20
21
kwargs = {
22
"image": image,
23
"mask": mask,
24
"prompt": prompt,
25
"n": n,
26
"size": size,
27
}
28
29
response = openai.Image.create_edit(**kwargs)
30
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
31
32
print(image_url)
Let’s see what the code does line by line:
• The code opens two image files located in the directory ../resources/ with the names
without_mask.png and mask.png. The mode "rb" is used in the open function to open the files
in binary mode, which is required when reading image files.
• The prompt variable is assigned a string value that describes the content of the image.
• The n variable is assigned an integer value of 1, which indicates the number of images to
generate.
• The size variable is assigned a string value of "1024x1024", which specifies the size of the
generated images.

Editing Images Using DALL-E
222
• A dictionary kwargs is created that maps the keys "image", "mask", "prompt", "n", and "size"
to the corresponding values stored in the variables image, mask, prompt, n, and size. This
dictionary will be used as keyword arguments when calling the openai.Image.create_edit
function.
• The openai.Image.create_edit function is then called with the arguments provided in the
kwargs dictionary. The response from the function is stored in the response variable.
• Finally, the URL of the generated image is extracted from the response dictionary and stored
in the image_url variable.
That’s all what we need to do.
The API returns a URL, however, we can get it encoded in Base64 format by changing the response_-
format:
1
kwargs = {
2
"image": image,
3
"mask": mask,
4
"prompt": prompt,
5
"n": n,
6
"size": size,
7
"response_format": "b64_json",
8
}

Drawing Inspiration From Other
Images
OpenAI enables you to generate various versions of the same image. You can draw inspiration from
another image to create a new one. The image can be yours or another person’s work. There are
certainly copyright issues in many applications of this feature; however, that is a separate topic we
are not discussing here. Also, given the fact that we are learning and using the images for personal
and educational purposes, we are not concerned with these issues.
How to Create a Variation of a Given Image.
The procedure is simple and straightforward. We will use the Image module to call the model and
request a new image from the variations endpoints.
We will start with the following image:

Here’s how it works:

import os

import openai

def init_api():
5
with open(".env") as env:
6
for line in env:
7
key, value = line.strip().split("=")
8
os.environ[key] = value
9
10
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
11
openai.organization = os.environ.get("ORG_ID")
12
13
init_api()
14
15
image = open("../resources/original_image.png", "rb")
16
n = 3
17
size = "1024x1024"
18
19
kwargs = {
20
"image": image,
21
"n": n,
22
"size": size
23
}
24
25
response = openai.Image.create_variation(**kwargs)
26
url = response
• The original image is located at "../resources/original_image.png" and is opened in binary
mode with open("../resources/original_image.png", "rb")
• The variable n is set to 3, which means that the API will generate 3 variations of the image.
• The variable size is set to "1024x1024", which specifies the size of the output images.
• The arguments are stored as key-value pairs in a dictionary kwargs, which is then passed
as keyword arguments to the openai.Image.create_variation() method using the **kwargs
syntax (As we have seen in previous examples, this allows the method to receive the arguments
as separate keyword arguments, rather than as a single dictionary).
• The response of the API is stored in the variable response and the URL of the generated image
is stored in the variable url, which is set equal to response.
The output should be similar to the following:

size = "1024x1024"

12
urls = response["data"]
13
14
for i in range(n):
15
print(urls[i]['url'])

Use Cases for Image Variations
One useful use case for this feature is when you generate images using prompts and find the right
combinations of keywords to get the desired image but still want to make it better.
Compared to other AI image generation and text-to-image tools, DALL-E has some limitations, so
sometimes you will need to spend some time finding the right prompts. When you find it, you can
refine your result (the generated image) using multiple variations.
This feature can also be used when editing an image, though the results may not be completely
satisfactory. In this case, there is a chance you get better results by using different variations.
So whether creating variations of generated or edited images, this feature can be chained with other
features to get better results and a larger number of choices.
