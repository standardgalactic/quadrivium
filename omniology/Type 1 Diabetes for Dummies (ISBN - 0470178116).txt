About the Author
This is the fifth For Dummies book by Alan L. Rubin, MD. His previous books,
Diabetes For Dummies, Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, Thyroid For Dummies,
and High Blood Pressure For Dummies (all of which are now in second editions),
have been major successes. Letters of praise from numerous readers verify 
the important role that Dr. Rubin’s books have played in their lives. The books
have been translated into seven languages and adapted for readers in the
United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Each of Dr. Rubin’s For Dummies books
provides the latest information on every aspect of its subject while being writ-
ten in an easy-to-understand format that’s full of humor and wisdom.
Dr. Rubin has practiced endocrinology in San Francisco since 1973. He teaches
doctors, medical students, and nonprofessionals through classes, lectures,
and articles. He has appeared on numerous radio and television shows to
answer questions about diabetes, thyroid disease, and high blood pressure.
He also serves as a consultant to many pharmaceutical companies and com-
panies that make products for patients with high blood pressure.
Dr. Rubin discusses many health issues in audio “Healthcasts” that may be
downloaded at his Web site, www.drrubin.com.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my new granddaughter Eliana, the beautiful child of
my daughter Renee and my son-in-law Marty, who was born on April 9, 2007,
just as this book was being born. It is my fervent hope that she will never
need the knowledge contained here, but if she should, I hope that it contains
everything that she needs to know to live a long, healthy life free of the com-
plications that make life difficult for so many people with diabetes. Eliana:
Read this book carefully if you have to. I have tried to include all the available
knowledge of this subject that you and your parents need. This book is the
answer to the question, “If your granddaughter had diabetes, which book
would you recommend?”
Author’s Acknowledgments
I wish to thank the numerous people at Wiley Publishing who have made this
and all my books such a pleasure to write. The wise people at Wiley under-
stand that type 1 diabetes is, in many ways, a different disease from type 2.
Hence the need for this book. It has always been a pleasure to work with 
my friend Kathy Nebenhaus, Vice President and Executive Publisher of
Professional and Trade Publishing at Wiley. Vice President and Publisher
Diane Steele has been a valuable resource for the writing of this and all my
books. Acquisitions Editor Michael Lewis served as my advocate as we
smoothed out the many details that have to be agreed upon before such a
project can begin. Project Editor Georgette Beatty offered valuable sugges-
tions and questions that hopefully make this book more understandable and
useful to the reader. Copy Editor Elizabeth Rea made sure that my words, my
sentences, and my paragraphs followed the rules of the English language. The
Technical Editor for this book, Rattan Juneja, MD, checked everything that I
wrote so that you, the reader, may be certain that you can trust everything
you read to be consistent with modern medical practice. Many other unnamed
people are involved from the people who publicize the book to those who
take the orders to those who ship out the books. Finally, the booksellers 
who put the book in your hands deserve my major gratitude. Every one of
you is an essential cog in a beautifully running machine.

Introduction
A
lthough they have the same names (but different numbers), type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not
the same disease. They share many features, especially the consequences of
not controlling the blood glucose (sugar): microvascular complications like
eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease; and macrovascular complica-
tions like heart disease, stroke, and obstruction of blood vessels, especially
in the legs and feet.
The big difference is that T2DM is a lifestyle disease; T1DM is not. What exactly
does that mean?
 Type 2 diabetes is very often preventable by maintaining a normal weight
and doing lots of exercise. And diet and exercise go far in preventing
complications of the disease.
 Diet and exercise can’t prevent T1DM or its complications. The big differ-
ence can be summed up in a single word: insulin. This chemical, present in
T2DM for long after the disease begins, is partially or completely absent in
T1DM from the beginning. T1DM can be cured by restoring insulin so that
it’s available to the exact extent as in a person who doesn’t have diabetes.
(Not that food intake and exercise are unimportant in T1DM. But whereas
most people with T2DM are middle-aged, heavy, and sedentary, most
people with T1DM are young, lean, and active, at least at the time of 
diagnosis.)
One important fact is true of both types of diabetes: At the present time,
although there’s not a cure for either type, drugs and equipment are available
to control the disease in such a way that your child need never suffer from
long-term complications if you’re willing to take the time and put forth the
effort to make this happen. In fact, your child may grow up to be healthier
than friends without diabetes if you follow the recommendations in this book.
About This Book
Each chapter in this book is self-contained, like a short story. That way you
can go just where you want and read just what you want. This book isn’t
meant to be read from cover to cover, although I can’t stop you if that’s how
you want to approach it. You may even want to do that the first time around,

and then use it as a reference whenever you want to brush up on a particular
subject. If you feel there’s an important issue that I haven’t addressed or that
needs more discussion, please e-mail me at diabetes@drrubin.com.
The subject of diabetes is vast and gets larger daily. Don’t believe me? I have
an automated update that brings me new articles about diabetes from the
National Library of Medicine, and I get three to five new articles every day!
This book contains the most important information available on the subject
of T1DM, but it can’t contain everything. For more on the subject, check the
references that I supply at my Web site, www.drrubin.com, by clicking on
Diabetes under Related Websites on the home page.
A characteristic of the For Dummies series is the use of humor. Readers of 
my previous books, Diabetes For Dummies, Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies,
Thyroid For Dummies, and High Blood Pressure For Dummies, know that I use
humor to get my point across. You may think that there’s nothing funny
about diabetes, and you’d be wrong. Many patients have sent me humorous
stories about their experiences, which I’ve included in previous books. If you
have a funny experience associated with your diabetes, please e-mail it to me
at diabetes@drrubin.com.
One important note about the use of this book: Please don’t make any
changes in your child’s treatment (or your own, if you’re the patient) based
upon what you read in this book without discussing them with your doctor.
He or she may have very good reasons, based upon your child’s particular
situation, for doing something different from what I recommend here. This is
exactly the reason I never offer specific advice to people who e-mail me the
details of their disease without giving me the opportunity to question them,
examine them, and do the tests I feel are appropriate.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book is meant to be read and understood by the non-physician. Therefore,
I try to keep scientific terminology to a minimum. Where I must use it, I explain
it clearly, and you can also look it up in the glossary at the end of the book. I
can’t avoid the terminology completely because I want you and your doctor to
speak the same language. You should clearly understand the reasons behind
everything he recommends, so don’t hesitate to ask questions and quote 
chapter and verse from this book.
In order to save keystrokes, I use some abbreviations throughout the book.
The main ones are “T1DM” for “type 1 diabetes mellitus” and “T2DM” for
“type 2 diabetes mellitus.” You can find these and any others in the book in
the glossary. How did these names come about? Good question! People used
to refer to diabetes in young people as “juvenile diabetes.” In the past, “juve-
nile diabetes” was understood to mean diabetes due to a lack of insulin, but
2
Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies 

several years ago, the American Diabetes Association recognized that one
result of the epidemic of obesity is the occurrence of T2DM in many juve-
niles. In addition, a lack of insulin often occurs in adults. Therefore, they
changed the name from “juvenile diabetes” to “type 1 diabetes mellitus.”
T1DM refers to the condition of any patient whose diabetes is due to insulin
lack at the very beginning.
Because many T1DM patients are children and young adults, I’ve geared this
book toward parents and caretakers; for the most part, when I say “you,” I’m
speaking to someone who’s caring for a patient. However, adults with T1DM
can still apply the information in this book to their own lives; in fact, several
topics throughout the book are directed specifically toward adult patients
(such as the work and driving information in Chapter 14).
Here are a few more conventions to guide you through this book:
 Italic points out defined terms and emphasizes certain words.
 Boldface highlights key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in
numbered steps.
 Monofont indicates Web addresses.
When this book was printed, it may have been necessary to break some Web
addresses across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when
using one of these Web addresses, just type exactly what you see in this book,
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Shaded areas called sidebars contain material that’s interesting but not essen-
tial to your understanding. If you don’t care to go so deeply into a subject, skip
the sidebars. You won’t be at any disadvantage.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I assumed that you know little or nothing about diabetes
and T1DM in particular. Forgive me if some of the material is too basic for
you, but many of the people who read this, especially the children and young
adults, will be learning about diabetes for the first time. I want all my readers
to have a sturdy foundation upon which to build a skyscraper of knowledge.
If you already know a great deal about T1DM, you’ll find new information that
adds to your knowledge.
3
Introduction

You probably fall into one of the following categories:
 You’re the parent of a child who’s newly diagnosed with T1DM, or you
just want an introduction to all that’s new in this field.
 You’re a child or young adult who’s old enough to understand basic
ideas about your T1DM.
 You’re an adult who’s been recently diagnosed with T1DM. (Don’t worry;
the information in this book applies to you, too!)
 You’re a friend or family member of a person with T1DM, and you want
to understand and help the person.
How This Book Is Organized
The book is divided into six parts to help you find out all that you want to
know about T1DM.
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes
In this part, you discover the central roles of glucose and insulin in T1DM and
the way that one, insulin, controls the other. You find out what happens when
this control doesn’t take place. I also explain who typically gets T1DM, how
it’s diagnosed, and how to move forward after a diagnosis.
As I say in this introduction, there’s more than one kind of diabetes. You find
out how to tell them apart in this part. It’s not always an easy task, especially
when the patient is a child, so the info in this part is essential.
Part II: Considering the Consequences 
of Type 1 Diabetes
Uncontrolled T1DM has consequences, both short-term, which occur within
days or even minutes of loss of control of blood glucose, and long-term, which
occur after 10 to 15 years of poor glucose (sugar) control. This part goes in-
depth on the topics of short- and long-term complications and also lets you
know that your child doesn’t have to suffer any of these consequences.
As you find out in this part, in an effort to control glucose, it’s possible 
to overcompensate with insulin, leading to a condition of low blood sugar
called hypoglycemia, a significant short-term complication. The long-term
4
Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies 

consequences or complications can all be detected early in the course of
their development. With both short- and long-term complications, it’s impor-
tant to know what they are and what the symptoms are in order to catch
them early on and prevent further progression if they do occur.
In this part, I also cover the emotional and psychological difficulties associated
with a chronic disease such as diabetes, telling you what they are and how to
deal with them.
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes
Treating T1DM requires a lot of effort, as you find out in this part, but I know
you and your child can do it. What’s involved? For starters, you have to do a
great deal of monitoring, which at this time still requires sticking your child’s
finger four or more times a day. He also has to get certain laboratory tests on
a regular basis and go to the doctor for regular checkups.
What your child eats and when he eats is a big part of managing his diabetes.
Unlike the person without diabetes, your child needs to arrange his meals 
and his insulin so that the insulin is in his body when the food is. Then there’s
exercise, an important part of treatment that lowers the blood glucose because
the muscles need sugar to work. As I explain in this part, many patients use
exercise in place of insulin and end up taking very few units of insulin.
The subject of insulin requires two chapters in this part. One chapter tells
you what insulin is and how to use it properly. The other discusses a new and
important device that supplies insulin 24 hours a day, the insulin pump.
Recently, other drugs have become available for treating T1DM. In this part, I
make sure that you know about these and the role they can play in controlling
your child’s blood glucose as well as the effect of drugs that interact with 
his insulin. I also address other methods of treating diabetes that involve
attempts to replace the cells that make insulin and therefore cure the disease.
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes
The chapters in this part delve into a number of special considerations 
for the person with T1DM. If he goes to school, his teachers need to know
some basic management strategies, such as how to deal with low blood 
glucose. At work, there are still some jobs for which the person with T1DM
isn’t welcome. And there are insurance issues that a person with a chronic
disease needs to consider.
5
Introduction

In addition to these considerations, this part also tells you about how minor
illnesses like colds may throw off diabetic control and how to accommodate
the special needs of the traveler with T1DM.
Women and the elderly are two special populations when it comes to living
with T1DM. In this part, I discuss how women can control their diabetes
during menstruation, how a woman with T1DM should be in excellent control
of her T1DM prior to conceiving a baby and throughout her pregnancy, and
how menopause brings new considerations including whether or not to use
hormone replacement therapy. I close this part with a chapter on the elderly
population with T1DM and the unique problems that they face in treating
their condition.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a staple in all For Dummies books; in this book, it provides
an opportunity to emphasize some of the key points that I make throughout
the book and to provide some material that you may not have found there,
including the following:
 T1DM is a disease mostly diagnosed in children, but after a while, the
child must take over his complete care. The chapter on ten ways to
involve kids in their T1DM management offers suggestions on how to
start this process.
 A number of management ideas are essential to good diabetes care. In
this part, I point out the ones I consider the top ten.
 Myths about diagnosis and treatment tend to develop around any disease,
particularly a chronic disease like T1DM. In this part, I dispel ten of those
myths. If you know of any that I don’t cover, please e-mail them to me.
 I provide information on the latest and greatest discoveries on T1DM in
this part so that you can stay on the cutting edge of treatment.
Part VI: Appendixes
If you come upon a term in the text that you don’t understand, turn to the
glossary in Appendix A for a definition. And if you want new or extended infor-
mation on any subject, go to Appendix B, where you can find resources for the
latest information and numerous suggestions to further your education.

Icons Used in This Book
Books in the For Dummies series feature icons, which direct you toward infor-
mation that may be of particular interest or importance. Here’s an explanation
of what each icon in this book signifies:
When you find this alongside information, it’s time to dial the doctor for help.
When you see this icon, it means the information is essential. Make sure you
understand it.
This icon points out important information that can save you time and energy.
This icon warns against potential problems.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends on your needs. If you want a basic under-
standing of what T1DM is and isn’t, head to Part I. If you or someone you know
has a complication due to T1DM, skip to Part II. For help in treating T1DM using
every available tool, turn to Part III. If you’re thinking of becoming pregnant,
are going into menopause, are elderly, or have a parent with T1DM, Part IV is
your next stop. Likewise, go there if you want to know what your options are
for school, work, and other activities, or if you want to know how to manage
travel or illness. For a bird’s-eye view of getting kids involved, key treatment
strategies, the mythology that surrounds T1DM, and the latest discoveries,
check Part V.
In any case, as my mother used to say when she gave me a present, use this
book in good health.

Defining Type 1
Diabetes

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces you to type 1 diabetes mellitus. You
start with a grand overview of this distinct disease’s
development. Then you get into the precise symptoms and
the diagnosis process followed by an introduction to the
diseases commonly confused with type 1 diabetes, espe-
cially type 2 diabetes. Luckily, the information in this part
helps ensure that you never confuse them again.

Chapter 1
Dealing with Type 1 Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Discovering what type 1 diabetes is
 Dealing with physical and emotional effects
 Treating type 1 diabetes
 Living life to the fullest with type 1 diabetes
I
n 2005, the most recent year for which there are statistics, there were
340,000 people in the United States with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) according
to the Centers for Disease Control. About half were children up to age 20.
There are 30,000 new cases every year, almost all in children.
Whether you’re an older child or young adult able to take care of your own
diabetes, or a parent or other caregiver for a young child with this disease,
you should be aware that there’s a great deal that you can do to minimize
both the short- and long-term complications that may develop and live a long
and healthy life with T1DM.
What! You don’t believe me! Consider the story of two brothers, Robert and
Gerald. Robert is 85 years old and developed T1DM at age 5. Gerald is 90 and
developed T1DM at age 16. The physician who follows them, Dr. George L. King,
research director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, studies patients with
T1DM who have lived more than 50 years with the disease. He has more than
400 such patients.
Dr. King says that these patients have a lot in common. They
 Keep extensive records of their blood sugars, their diet, their exercise,
their insulin dosage, and their daily food consumption
 Do a lot of exercise
 Eat very carefully
 Have a very positive outlook

These actions form the basis of effective T1DM treatment, which I introduce
in this chapter. I also give you an overview of the potential consequences of
T1DM and tips for living well with it.
At the present time, there’s no way to prevent T1DM, but I believe a change
isn’t far off and T1DM may be preventable in perhaps in the next five years.
The breakthrough will come with the use of stem cells, transplantation, or
the elimination of the cause of T1DM. You can read much more about this
subject in Chapters 13 and 21.
Understanding What Type 
1 Diabetes Is (and Isn’t)
T1DM, simply stated, is an autoimmune disease. Immunity is what protects
you from foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses. In autoimmunity, your
body mistakenly acts against your own tissues. In T1DM, the immune cells and
proteins react against the cells that make insulin, destroying them. (Insulin is
the chemical or hormone that controls the blood glucose; glucose is sugar
that provides instant energy.)
Although it often begins dramatically, T1DM doesn’t occur overnight. Many
patients give a history of several months of increasing thirst and urination,
among other symptoms. Also, T1DM usually begins in childhood, but some
folks don’t develop it until they’re adults. In either case, to verify a diagnosis
of T1DM, a sample of blood is taken and its glucose level is measured. If the
patient is fasting, the level should be no more than 125 mg/dl; if there’s no
fast, the level should be no more than 199 mg/dl. For further confirmation,
tests should be done at two different times to check for inconsistencies.
However, a person with a blood glucose of 300 to 500 mg/dl who has an 
acetone smell on his breath clearly has T1DM until proven otherwise.
So how is type 1 diabetes different from type 2 diabetes (T2DM)? The central
problem in T2DM isn’t a lack of insulin but insulin resistance; in other words,
the body resists the normal, healthy functioning of insulin. Before the devel-
opment of T2DM, when a person’s blood glucose is still normal, the level of
insulin is abnormally high because the person is resistant to the insulin and
therefore more is needed to keep the glucose normal.
To complicate matters, a type of diabetes called Latent Autoimmune Diabetes
in Adults (LADA) is a cross between T1DM and T2DM; a person with LADA
exhibits traits of both diseases.
12
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Chapter 2 details the basics of T1DM, including how insulin works, what goes
wrong when blood glucose levels are too high, the specific symptoms to watch
for, and gathering a team of doctors and other specialists after a diagnosis.
Chapter 3 fully explains how T2DM and LADA are different from T1DM.
Handling the Physical and Emotional
Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes
What makes diabetes a difficult disease are the physical complications associ-
ated with poor control of the blood glucose. These complications are generally
divided into short-term complications and long-term complications.
 Short-term complications, which I cover in Chapter 4, are the result of 
a blood glucose that’s either very low or very high. Low blood glucose
(called hypoglycemia) can occur in minutes as a result of too much insulin,
too much exercise, or too little food, but high blood glucose often takes
several hours to develop. Whereas low blood glucose often can be man-
aged at home, severe high blood glucose (called diabetic ketoacidosis) is
an emergency that’s managed by a doctor in the hospital. Nevertheless,
it’s important that you understand how it develops in order to prevent it.
Chapter 4 describes the signs and symptoms associated with both of
these complications and the best ways of handling them.
 Long-term complications, which I cover in Chapter 5, can be devastating.
It’s much better to prevent them with very careful diabetes management
than to try to treat them after they develop. Fortunately, they take 15 or
more years to fully develop, and there’s time to slow them down if not
reverse them if you’re aware of them. All long-term complications can be
detected in the very earliest stages.
The long-term complications consist of eye disease known as retinopathy,
kidney disease known as nephropathy, and nerve disease known as 
neuropathy. Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness; new
cases of kidney failure requiring dialysis, which cleanses the blood of
toxins when the kidneys can no longer do their job; and loss of sensation
in the feet as well as other consequences of nerve damage.
Not only does T1DM have short- and long-term physical consequences, but
as an autoimmune disease, T1DM also is associated with other autoimmune
diseases such as celiac disease, an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract;
thyroid disease; and skin diseases. Chapter 5 explains the importance of
checking for those diseases and correcting them, if present.
13
Chapter 1: Dealing with Type 1 Diabetes

As you may expect, people with T1DM also have significant psychological and
emotional needs. It’s important, first of all, to realize that T1DM has been 
present in some very high achievers. (I name names in Chapter 6.) In addition,
T1DM is not only a disease of the particular patient but also a disease of the
entire family. All family members are affected in one way or another. In Chapter
6, you find out ways that family members can help themselves and help the
patient to maintain his self-esteem and a high quality of life.
If you’re the patient with T1DM, the people around you need to know that
you have diabetes and how to help you when you can’t help yourself. Often
people with T1DM try to keep their disease secret, as though it’s a blot on
their character. T1DM isn’t your fault. There will be times when you may
need the help of others, and it will be a whole lot easier for them to help you
if they know about your condition and what to do in different circumstances.
(All this is also true for your child with T1DM.)
Treating Type 1 Diabetes Effectively
Part III may be the most important part of this book. Your willingness to do all
the things I recommend in that part (which I preview in the following sections)
means the difference between living a long and healthy life or dying at a much
younger age (whether for your child or yourself if you’re the patient).
Undergoing regular testing
There are a number of tests that your child’s doctor should be doing on a 
regular basis. Chapter 7 outlines all these tests, explains what they mean, and
discusses how often they should be done. These tests include the following:
 Blood pressure check
 Height and weight check
 Foot exam
 Hemoglobin A1c
 Microalbuminuria
 Eye exam
 Lipid panel
 Thyroid function check
 Ankle-brachial index study
14
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Don’t leave it up to your child’s doctor to order these tests. On the Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book, I provide a chart that lists the tests that need
to be done and the frequency for each test; it also has spaces for you to enter
the test results. Make copies of the blank chart, fill out a copy, and take it to
your child’s doctor at every visit to remind him or her to do these tests.
Regular testing outside the doctor’s office is crucial, too. Daily self-monitoring
of blood glucose may be the most important thing that you and your child can
do to control his blood glucose. The available meters are simple to use, highly
accurate, and require tiny amounts of blood. The more you know about your
child’s blood glucose under all circumstances, the easier it is to keep it in the
normal range — not too low and not too high. Flip to Chapter 7 for full details
on monitoring blood glucose.
Eating wisely
If you’re a parent of a child with T1DM, you need to make sure that your child
gets the right nutrients for proper growth and that he balances the food intake
with insulin at all times. If you’re meticulous about the food your child eats,
you’ll find that controlling his blood glucose is much easier. I have numerous
patients whose blood glucose levels improved dramatically after I sent them
to a dietitian.
Chapter 8 discusses how to count carbohydrates so that your child takes 
the right amount of insulin for the food that he eats. I explain how to include
the right mix of protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water along with carbo-
hydrates; the diet challenges you face when you feed a child of any age; and
how to take other food factors into account, such as sugar substitutes and
fast food. I also offer advice on coping with eating disorders.
Exercising for more control
Exercise helps to reduce the amount of insulin that your child requires and
makes it easier to control his blood glucose. Any exercise is better than no
exercise, but 30 minutes a day should be your minimum goal for your child.
In Chapter 9, I explain how to take care before your child starts an exercise
plan by talking to the doctor and adjusting insulin intake, among other tasks.
I show you how to encourage your child to exercise at any age and help him
pick an activity (even a competitive sport!). I also give you my picks for the
best exercises around: walking and training with weights.
15
Chapter 1: Dealing with Type 1 Diabetes

Taking insulin
Chapters 10 and 11 tell you all you need to know about insulin (including
types and dosages), and all the old and new ways to administer it.
 The types of insulin are long-acting, rapid-acting, and some in-between
insulins. The insulins that most closely mimic the action of human
insulin in the body are clearly the best. Insulin can be taken by shots,
using jet injections, and by inhaling it into your lungs. I give you the pros
and cons of each method in Chapter 10 and let you choose for yourself.
 Delivering insulin with a pump deserves to have Chapter 11 all to 
itself because it’s quite different from the methods in Chapter 10. Many
patients use pumps to administer their insulin. The clever manufacturers
have tried to arrange the pump so that it delivers insulin just like your
own pancreas. Unfortunately, the pump currently can’t detect the level of
glucose in your blood and provide insulin accordingly just like your own
pancreas, but modern insulin pumps aren’t far from that ideal.
Using other medications and treatments
At one time, insulin was the only drug given to the patient with T1DM. Today,
there are some new drugs that can assist insulin in controlling the blood 
glucose. Chapter 12 looks into these drugs and some promising treatments
for people with T1DM, such as acupuncture and biofeedback.
At the other end of the spectrum are drugs that make it even more difficult 
to control your blood glucose (or your child’s). Alcohol and nicotine in ciga-
rettes top the list, but there are a number of illegal drugs that also complicate
diabetes management. Avoid these drugs at all costs. In Chapter 12, I explain
how they make glucose control so difficult.
Deciding to transplant
Chapter 13 could be called “the chapter of hope.” It discusses potential cures
for T1DM. I tell you about transplanting a kidney, the entire pancreas, or both
at the same time (now that’s a neat trick!). I also discuss transplanting only
the beta cells that make insulin. I describe the preparation and process for
each type of surgery and explain the continuing issues that you have to deal
with afterward.
16
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Living Well with Type 1 Diabetes
Unfortunately, type 1 diabetes is a lifelong chronic disease. As you find out in
the following sections, it requires your child to make adjustments in his life
that many people who don’t have diabetes take for granted. But making these
adjustments is a small price to pay for being able to live life to the fullest!
Handling school, work, and 
other daily activities
A number of laws mandate the accommodations that schools must provide
for your child with diabetes. Chapter 14 tells you how to get the school
authorities on your side with the use of Section 504 Plans and individualized
education programs. I also discuss how to handle T1DM in college.
Done with college? If you have T1DM, there are certain jobs that aren’t 
open to you. For example, you can’t serve in the military, and you can’t fly
commercial airliners. There was a time when you couldn’t fly a private plane
either, but fortunately that time is past. Chapter 14 discusses the jobs you
can’t have when you have T1DM, what to do if you suspect discrimination at
work because of your T1DM, and the ways that employers can integrate their
employees with T1DM into the workplace. I also talk about some other issues
for adults, including driving with diabetes and obtaining insurance.
Adjusting to sick days and travel
If your child has another illness in addition to T1DM, there are special 
adjustments that you have to make. He may not feel like eating, and you may
think that he needs less insulin as a result. The truth is usually the opposite.
Your child’s body responds to an acute illness by pouring out hormones that
promote the production of more glucose, so his blood glucose rises. He may
actually need more insulin during an illness when he can’t eat than he’d need
when he’s healthy. Chapter 15 provides the information you need to manage
your child’s illness when he also has T1DM.
Another special circumstance that affects diabetes care is travel. When travel-
ing, you and your child may go through different time zones. This complicates
taking insulin because each type of insulin has a certain duration of action, and
you may lose or gain hours as you travel. In Chapter 15, I share suggestions for
handling your child’s insulin smoothly and traveling with his supplies safely.

Chapter 1: Dealing with Type 1 Diabetes

Getting through pregnancy 
and menopause
Women with T1DM have special needs. Starting with oral contraceptives,
Chapter 16 takes you through preparing for pregnancy, getting through the
pregnancy, and considering hormone replacement therapy during
menopause. The surge of estrogens and progesterones that occurs every
month in a menstruating female makes it even harder to control the blood
glucose, so you find out the best ways to handle this tricky situation.
As a woman with T1DM, you shouldn’t even consider pregnancy without
reading Chapter 16. The likelihood that you’ll produce a baby with malforma-
tions will be much lower if you understand the information that I present
here and take care of yourself accordingly. Keeping your diabetes under
excellent control throughout the pregnancy ensures a much easier delivery
and a healthy child. I can’t overstate the importance of diet and exercise
throughout the pregnancy. Every mother-to-be wants an easy delivery and a
healthy baby; if you keep your blood glucose under control throughout the
pregnancy, the healthy baby is guaranteed.
Aging with type 1 diabetes
The elderly person with T1DM deserves special consideration. He may not
exhibit the same signs and symptoms as younger people. He usually has
other illnesses and afflictions that complicate his diabetes care, including
loss of hearing, diminished vision, and maybe even loss of mental function.
All these circumstances may make insulin administration very difficult. The
dosage of drugs given to the elderly is usually significantly lower than the
dosage for the non-elderly. What’s a caretaker to do? Chapter 17 has the
information that can make caring for the elderly person a lot easier.

 Discovering how type 1 diabetes works
 Determining who gets type 1 diabetes
 Diagnosing type 1 diabetes
A
wasting disease that was probably type 1 diabetes is mentioned in an
Egyptian papyrus dated over 3,500 years. Although they didn’t call it
type 1 diabetes, over 2,000 years ago the Greeks and Romans described many
of the features of the condition exactly as doctors see it today. The difference
is that the ancients could do nothing about it. In contrast, today’s doctors
have all the tools needed to make type 1 diabetes nothing more than a major
annoyance.
In this chapter, I provide some basic information about type 1 diabetes, or
T1DM for short. You find out how it develops, who gets it, and how it’s 
diagnosed.
Understanding How Type 1 
Diabetes Works
Type 1 diabetes is all about glucose and insulin. What’s the difference? Here’s
what you need to know:
 Glucose is one of many sugars, but it happens to be the specific sugar
found in your blood that provides instant energy. Sugar is a carbohy-
drate, one of the three sources of energy in your body, along with 
protein and fat.
 Insulin is a chemical known as a hormone, which means that it’s made in
an organ, in this case the pancreas, and carried around the body in the
bloodstream. The function of insulin is to act as a key to the “door” in
each cell of the body that opens to allow glucose in. However, not every
cell requires insulin to get its glucose; some cells and organs take up glu-
cose without using insulin. These include

• The brain
• Nerve fibers
• Red blood cells
• The retinas of the eyes
• The kidneys
• Blood vessels
Figure 2-1 shows the pancreas and its parts along with its location
behind the stomach. The insulin-producing and insulin-storing pancreas
cells (called B or beta cells) are found in groups called islets of
Langerhans throughout the pancreas. Other cells present in the islets of
Langerhans include A cells, which produce glucagon, a hormone that’s
very important to patients with diabetes because it raises blood glucose
when it gets too low; and D cells, which make somatostatin, a hormone
that blocks the secretion of other hormones but doesn’t have a use in
diabetes because it causes high blood glucose.
In people who don’t have type 1 diabetes, the presence of insulin helps control
the conversion of glucose into energy in the body. People with type 1 diabetes,
however, go through a triggering event (most likely a viral infection) that leads
to a lack of insulin in the body, which in turn leads to having uncontrolled 
glucose (and that can cause some bad stuff to happen). I explain how the
whole process works in the following sections.

Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Distinguishing between controlled 
and uncontrolled glucose
The definition of type 1 diabetes is simple: It’s the lack of control of glucose
in the body due to a lack of insulin. In the following sections, I explain the 
differences between normally controlled glucose and out-of-control glucose.
Controlling glucose normally
Glucose from the blood gets into most cells (other than those previously
listed) when insulin is available to let it in. In the cell, glucose is converted
into energy. If there’s more than enough glucose to meet the energy needs of
the individual, the excess glucose is stored in the liver and in muscle. When
the liver and muscle are filled, additional glucose is converted to fat. Your
body has an enormous ability to store fat, whether it comes from glucose 
or from the food you eat.
In a healthy person who diets, the release of insulin declines because glucose
is what stimulates insulin to be released. The body then turns to the liver,
where glucose is stored as glycogen. The A cells of the pancreas (refer to
Figure 2-1) release glucagon, which breaks down the glycogen back into 
glucose to continue to provide energy.
When the glycogen is used up, the body turns to the other form of stored
energy, fat. Fat is converted into compounds called glycerol and fatty acids.
 Glycerol is changed into glucose to provide energy and is used up.
 Fatty acids are converted into other compounds called ketones in the
liver. Except for the brain, the entire body can use fatty acids for energy.
Over time, as the diet continues, the body begins to break down muscle to
convert it into glucose.
Losing control of glucose
When the body experiences a complete lack of insulin, as in people with T1DM
(see the next section to find out how a lack of insulin is triggered), glucose
can’t enter cells from the blood with the exception of those it enters passively
(as I note earlier in this chapter). These cells continue to take up glucose as
long as the glucose inside them is less than the glucose in the bloodstream.
When blood glucose is high as a result of inadequate insulin, the cells and
organs that can take up glucose continue doing so even though other cells and
organs that depend on insulin can’t do so. The latter cells and organs suffer
the complications of type 1 diabetes that I explain in Chapters 4 and 5.
21
Chapter 2: Recognizing Type 1 Diabetes

Despite there being plenty of glucose in the blood, insulin-requiring cells
behave as though there’s no glucose. The body therefore begins breaking
down fat and turning muscle into glucose for those cells, leading to a large
amount of glucose in the body. If this process isn’t reversed by giving insulin,
the person becomes very sick with diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4).
Other hormones besides insulin play an important role as control of glucose is
lost. Each tries to raise the blood glucose to satisfy the needs of the tissues. I
mention one such hormone, glucagon, from the A cells in the pancreas’s islets
of Langerhans, in the previous section. In addition, the adrenal glands located
above the kidneys begin to secrete two important hormones, adrenaline 
and cortisol. After a while, the pituitary gland in the brain secretes growth
hormone. Following is more information on these hormones:

Sharing some patient stories
For some time, Vincent’s parents had noticed that
their 8-year-old son didn’t have his usual energy.
He was drinking more soda than usual and
seemed to have an increased appetite. But
despite eating more food, he was losing weight.
Vincent looked tired, which his parents thought
was because he woke up a few times each night
to go to the bathroom. He even wet his bed for
the first time in years. His concerned parents
took him to his pediatrician, who measured
Vincent’s blood glucose, did a few other tests,
and informed Vincent’s parents that their son had
type 1 diabetes. Vincent’s parents were quite
upset by the diagnosis, but they began giving him
insulin shots and carefully monitoring his food
intake. In just a few days, Vincent put on weight,
stopped urinating so frequently, and was able to
sleep through the night.
Lynn was a 12-year-old girl who loved to play
sports. In fact, she was the best soccer player on
her team. Because she was so active, she drank
a lot of sports drinks and water. One day, she
complained to her mother that she was very tired
after a particularly strenuous soccer game on a
very hot day. Her mother felt this was normal,
considering the circumstances. She noticed,
however, that her daughter was looking a little
thinner. Between soccer games the following
week, Lynn was very thirsty and going to the
bathroom frequently, but her parents thought it
was normal for an active young girl. However, at
her next soccer game, Lynn was too tired to play
for very long, and afterward, she went right home
and got in bed. Lynn’s mother couldn’t wake her
for dinner, so she called an ambulance and took
her daughter to an emergency room. The doctor
did an immediate blood glucose test, found it to
be 618 mg/dl, and had Lynn admitted to the inten-
sive care unit with a diagnosis of diabetic
ketoacidosis caused by type 1 diabetes. Lynn
received intravenous insulin and fluids and was
awake and alert within 48 hours. She was con-
verted to subcutaneous insulin injections. Lynn
and her parents followed up by participating in a
diabetes education program, which taught them
the skills Lynn would need for the rest of her life.
These two cases are typical of the way type 1
diabetes begins, and the apparent suddenness
of the disease in both children obscures the fact
that it was probably developing over several
months. At one time, Lynn’s story was more
common in that the condition was unexpected
and the child ended up in the intensive care unit.
Now, as a result of more awareness of diabetes
in the general population, Vincent’s story is the
more typical one.

 Adrenaline works with glucagon on the glycogen in the liver to break it
down to produce more glucose. Adrenaline stimulates production of glu-
cose from protein. It also decreases the glucose taken up by muscle and
liver cells, thus making it more available to the brain. Adrenaline turns 
fat into fatty acids as well. Other effects of adrenaline are shakiness,
sweating, rapid heartbeat, and hunger.
 Cortisol increases the production of glucose by stimulating the break-
down of both proteins and fats while decreasing the uptake of glucose
by tissues that require insulin, like muscles and the liver, to make it
available for the brain.
 Growth hormone breaks down body fat and decreases the uptake of 
glucose by blocking the action of insulin where it’s necessary to open
the cells to glucose, such as in the liver and muscles.
Interestingly, these same hormones play important roles in raising blood 
glucose when it’s too low for any reason (not just a lack of insulin); such 
a condition is called hypoglycemia, and I discuss it in Chapter 4.
Figure 2-2 shows the origins of the different hormones that affect blood 
glucose.

Chapter 2: Recognizing Type 1 Diabetes

Triggering type 1 diabetes
Not everyone can get T1DM. It begins with an inherited susceptibility for the
disease, which means that chromosomes, the parts of each cell that contain
the genetic material, are involved. Specifically, type 1 diabetes is connected to
chromosome 6, which has an area called the HLA complex (human leukocyte
antigen complex). There are many different HLA complexes on the chromo-
some, but only a few are associated with the development of T1DM. People
who develop T1DM all have one or more of several HLA complexes associated
with the disease.
If your child has the necessary HLA complex, he needs something in the 
environment — most probably a viral infection — to trigger T1DM. The viral
infection causes his body to produce antibodies, protective proteins that try
to destroy the virus. Cells that circulate in the blood, called T cells, make
these antibodies. T cells can kill foreign invaders both by producing antibod-
ies and by acting on them directly. It appears that the beta cells that make
insulin in the pancreas share some antigens with the virus. Therefore, the 
T cells in the blood begin to attack and destroy the beta cells that make 
the insulin because the T cells mistake the beta cells for the virus.
So how does a person reach the point where type 1 diabetes has officially
developed? Here’s a typical scenario: Your child is born with the HLA complex,
and he gets a viral infection when he’s 2 years old or at any other age. Over the
next six to eight years, the T cells slowly destroy his beta cells. However, he
has no symptoms because he has sufficient insulin reserve in his pancreas to
maintain normal glucose levels. Finally, enough beta cells have been destroyed
that your child can’t make enough insulin to keep the glucose level normal. 
His blood glucose rises and begins to leak into his urine, drawing water with it.
After a while, the lack of insulin becomes so severe that he has a condition 
similar to the ones described in the sidebar “Sharing some patient stories.”
How do doctors know all that’s happening in the body over such a span of
time? They look for T1DM in family members of people with T1DM because the
family members may have some of the same genetic material, in this case the
gene that led to susceptibility to T1DM. A few years after the viral infection,
your child’s doctor can measure the antibodies that indicate that the beta cells
are being attacked — long before the development of clinical T1DM, the point
at which symptoms are present. More than 90 percent of patients with new
T1DM will have one or more of the antibodies. The most common antibody is
called glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody, or GAD, and is found in 70 to
80 percent of type 1 patients.
Environmental factors that have antigens similar to the antigens on the beta
cells include
 Cow’s milk
 Coxsackie B virus
24
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

 Enterovirus
 German measles (rubella)
 Mumps virus
 Rotavirus
It’s not known which of these, if any, is the precipitating environmental factor
for T1DM. Evidence of infection with all these viruses, as well as exposure to
cow’s milk early in life, has been found in many patients with T1DM. Further
evidence for an environmental factor in T1DM comes from the finding that
fewer cases are diagnosed in the summer months, when people aren’t gath-
ered in small spaces and therefore are less susceptible to catching viruses.
T1DM also tends to develop much more often in people who live in northern
climates, where people tend to spend more time indoors. The incidence rate
in Finland, for instance, is 40 cases per 100,000 population, whereas the inci-
dence rate in Mexico is less than one case per 100,000 population. (See the
following section for more information on who gets type 1 diabetes.)
Checking Out the Statistics on 
Who Gets Type 1 Diabetes
The folks who develop type 1 diabetes tend to fall into a few distinct groups:
They’re Caucasians in northern climates, they’re typically children, and they
have a genetic disposition toward the disease. I discuss these categories in
more detail in the following sections.
Rates among different places and races
As I note in the previous section, type 1 diabetes occurs much more often in
people who live in northern climates and tend to be Caucasian. The differences
between this population and others can be dramatic; following are some facts
that illustrate the differences:
 Among youths with diabetes aged 1 to 9, 80 percent have T1DM and 20
percent have T2DM.
 Among youths aged 10 to 19, the percentage who have type 2 diabetes
(T2DM) is rising but still isn’t as high as the percentage with T1DM.
(Statistics are poor in this age group.)
 Canada has 25 new cases of T1DM per 100,000 population per year.
 The United States has 15 new cases of T1DM per 100,000 population 
per year.
25
Chapter 2: Recognizing Type 1 Diabetes

 Argentina (in a southern climate and with fewer Caucasians in its popula-
tion) has seven new cases of T1DM per 100,000 population per year.
 Chile, with a similar climate and population makeup to Argentina, has
two new cases of T1DM per 100,000 population per year.
Rates in children versus adults
It was with good reason that T1DM used to be called “juvenile diabetes”; the
vast majority of new cases are in teenagers and young adults, although 
the disease may occur at any age. One of the major reasons that T1DM is no
longer called “juvenile diabetes,” however, is that there’s another diabetes 
on the block: Doctors are seeing more and more type 2 diabetes (T2DM; 
see Chapter 3) among the juvenile population. T2DM is a different disease
requiring a different therapy. Also, doctors are recognizing many more cases
of T1DM among the adult population. As many as 5 to 10 percent of cases of
diabetes in adults previously thought to be type 2 may actually be type 1.
Of course, kids with T1DM grow up and become adults. But they still appear
different from folks with T2DM, a disease that tends to affect overweight,
sedentary people. Adults with T1DM usually are normal in weight and are
physically active.
Rates in families with members 
who have type 1 diabetes
A patient with T1DM can have his relatives tested for the HLA complex (see
the earlier section “Triggering type 1 diabetes” for more about this complex).
The opportunity to do that has led to some valuable insights about T1DM.
 Only a small fraction (less than 10 percent) of people with the necessary
HLA complex develop T1DM.
 Many relatives of people with T1DM who have the HLA complex develop
autoantibodies, like GAD, but never develop diabetes.
 A small percentage (5 to 10 percent) of patients with type 2 diabetes (see
Chapter 3) are found to have autoantibodies and are believed to have a
slowly progressing form of T1DM called latent autoimmune diabetes in
adults (LADA).
These findings indicate that T1DM may be a rapidly progressing disease, it may
be a very slowly progressing disease, or it may never occur at all in susceptible
individuals. How’s that for concrete information?
26
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

When it comes to the importance of a parent’s T1DM in predicting whether
the child will get T1DM, if the mother has T1DM, there’s only a 3 percent
chance that the child will develop it. If the father has T1DM, the child has 
a 6 percent chance of developing it. If both parents have T1DM, the child’s
likelihood of developing the disease jumps to 30 percent.
How do siblings factor in? Identical twins have a 60 percent chance of both
developing T1DM, but the twin who develops it later often doesn’t show it for
many years. Fraternal twins, who don’t share all the same chromosomes,
have only an 8 percent chance of both having T1DM, no greater than that of
two children born in different years in the same family.
Making a Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes
A number of symptoms signal the possibility of type 1 diabetes, so if your
child shows a few of them, it’s best to arrange testing right away. After the
diagnosis, it’s also important to find help from the right doctors and develop
some important skills to make sure that your child adjusts to life with type 1
diabetes as smoothly as possible.
Surveying the symptoms 
and undergoing testing
If T1DM develops rapidly, a number of symptoms suggest this diagnosis.
They include the following:
 Abdominal pain
 Blurred vision
 Extreme weakness and tiredness
 Increased thirst
27
Chapter 2: Recognizing Type 1 Diabetes
On the hunt for better names
What’s really needed are new names for both
T1DM and T2DM that are much more descriptive
and clearly separate the two diseases. I believe
that referring to them both as types of diabetes
suggests that they’re extremely similar. It also
results in too many instances of confusing stud-
ies, where you don’t know if the patients were
type 1 or type 2 unless it’s specified. If you have a
suggestion for a name, write me at diabetes
name@drrubin.com.

 Increased urination
 Irritability and mood changes
 Loss of menstruation
 Nausea
 Weight loss despite increased food intake
 Vomiting
If you’re a parent or spouse of the person who may have T1DM, you may
notice these signs:
 Acetone-like smell on the breath
 Dehydration
 Lethargy or even coma
 Low body temperature (less than 97 degrees Fahrenheit)
 Rapid breathing
 Rapid heart rate
 Reduced blood pressure (less than 90/60)
As soon as T1DM pops up on a doctor’s radar, there’s usually little trouble
making the diagnosis. To verify it, a sample of blood is taken and its glucose
level is measured. If the patient is fasting, the level should be no more than
126 mg/dl; if there’s no fast, the level should be no more than 200 mg/dl. For
further confirmation, tests should be done at two different times to check for
inconsistencies. However, a person who presents with a blood glucose of 300
to 500 mg/dl and has an acetone smell on his breath clearly has T1DM until
proven otherwise. The pediatrician or primary doctor usually does these tests
and refers the patient to the diabetes specialist after the diagnosis is made.
Gathering a group of the right doctors
Most children who develop T1DM are first seen by their pediatricians 
(adults who develop T1DM, of course, see their primary care physicians).
The pediatrician may have some familiarity with diabetes, but he’ll probably
refer you to a specialist called an endocrinologist or a diabetologist. Of course,
if a child is very sick with diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4), he enters the
hospital immediately to receive acute care, either from an acute care doctor
or diabetes specialist. Once the child is stable, the specialist takes over.
28
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

The ongoing care of a child with T1DM is in the hands of many different
people in addition to the specialist. They include:
 The primary physician, who is the pediatrician who takes care of day-
to-day problems like colds, fevers, rashes, and stomach upsets
 The dietitian, who informs the parents of the food choices that will keep
the child growing while avoiding diabetic complications (see Chapter 8
for more about eating a healthy diet)
 The diabetes educator, who teaches the parents and the child what
they must know about insulin, complications of diabetes and how to
avoid them, handling sick days, and managing travel
A diabetes educator should be a Certified Diabetes Educator, having
been tested by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators,
and should have a verification of certification to show you. Certified
Diabetes Educators must be recertified every five years, so you can be
sure that the educator is up-to-date.
 The pharmacist, who ensures that the child gets the right medication
and the right materials for testing blood glucose
 The mental health worker, who helps the family get through the mental
stresses associated with what will seem like an overwhelming problem
at first (see Chapter 6 for more about handling T1DM’s emotional and
psychological effects)
Later, certain other specialists may be needed such as
 An eye doctor to make sure that diabetes isn’t affecting the child’s eyes
 A foot doctor to handle minor foot problems before they become worse
 A kidney specialist should the diabetes affect the child’s kidneys
You get the names of these other specialists from your diabetes specialist. If
you’re happy with the diabetes specialist, it’s a good idea to work with doctors
he or she recommends.
Developing key skills after the diagnosis
In order to help your child to live a long, healthy life free of complications of
T1DM, you need a number of skills under your belt. You pick up these skills
primarily from the diabetes specialist, the diabetes educator, and the dietitian,
but the other professionals listed in the previous section also contribute to
your education.
29
Chapter 2: Recognizing Type 1 Diabetes

The major skills that you must acquire to help your child and that your child
must acquire as he grows are covered throughout this book. They include 
the following:
 Understanding the diabetes disease process (which I cover earlier in this
chapter) and the options for treatment (including ways of administering
insulin, diet, exercise, and so forth; see Part III)
 Adjusting to the psychosocial demands of T1DM (Chapter 6)
 Monitoring blood glucose and urine ketones (breakdown products of fat)
and using the results to improve glucose control (Chapter 7)
 Managing nutrition (Chapter 8)
 Incorporating physical activity in the child’s lifestyle (Chapter 9)
 Using insulin properly (Chapters 10 and 11)
 Preventing, detecting, and treating acute complications (Chapter 4)
 Preventing, detecting, and treating chronic complications (Chapter 5)
 Setting goals to promote health, and problem solving for daily living
(Chapters 14 and 15)
 Promoting preconception care and management during pregnancy
(Chapter 16)
 Promoting care and management in the elderly (Chapter 17)
If you sign up for a diabetes education program, make sure the curriculum
includes all these lessons with the possible exception of the pregnancy 
information for a young child or a male.

T
o paraphrase Senator Lloyd Bentsen in a famous vice presidential debate
when he told Senator Dan Quayle that he was no Jack Kennedy, I know
type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes is no type 1 diabetes. It’s unfortunate
that type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have the same name except for one
digit. One always seems to be confused for the other despite the fact that
their differences are numerous. If uncontrolled, both diseases are associated
with high levels of blood glucose, leading to the same long-term complica-
tions, but even their long-term complications differ in some respects. To mix
up matters even more, a form of diabetes called latent autoimmune diabetes
in adults (LADA) has features of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
This chapter describes type 2 diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes in
adults, and how they differ from type 1 diabetes so you can make sure that
you (or your child) are diagnosed with and treated for the correct disease.
In addition, in order to really understand type 1 diabetes (or T1DM), you
need to have a handle on other causes of diabetes, specifically conditions
like Cushing’s syndrome and acromegaly. Fortunately, certain other signs and
symptoms identify these conditions, as you find out in this chapter.
Distinguishing Type 2 and Latent
Autoimmune Diabetes from 
Type 1 Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is the form of diabetes that develops most often in adults and
is associated with obesity and lack of exercise. Latent autoimmune diabetes
also develops in adults but shares more characteristics with T1DM. The follow-
ing sections cover these types of diabetes, but for more information about 
type 2 diabetes, check out my book Diabetes For Dummies (Wiley).

Type 2 diabetes
When people talk about diabetes these days, they’re generally talking about
type 2 diabetes (or T2DM), which used to be called adult onset diabetes, non-
insulin dependent diabetes, or insulin independent diabetes. The vast majority
of people with diabetes in the United States have type 2 diabetes, and the
numbers are growing. About 21 million people have diabetes in the U.S., and
about 20 million of them probably have type 2. In the following sections, I
explain how type 2 diabetes works and who’s at risk for developing it, and I
discuss its diagnosis and treatment.
Understanding how type 2 diabetes works
The central problem in T2DM is not lack of insulin (as it is in T1DM; see
Chapter 2 for details) but insulin resistance. That is, the body resists the
normal, healthy functioning of insulin. Prior to the development of diabetes,
when a person’s blood glucose is still normal, the level of insulin is abnor-
mally high because the person is resistant to the insulin and therefore more
is needed to keep the glucose normal; a shot of insulin doesn’t reduce the
blood glucose in someone with type 2 diabetes nearly as much as it does in
healthy people without insulin resistance. The insulin resistance is caused by
a genetic abnormality and is made worse by weight gain and lack of exercise.
When diabetes is present, even though the person actually makes even more
than the normal amount of insulin to try to compensate (at least early in the
disease), they can’t keep the blood glucose in the normal range. It rises to
levels greater than 100 mg/dl in the fasting state and 140 mg/dl after eating.
This rise results from the body’s resistance to its own insulin.
The principal complication that occurs in T1DM but rarely if ever occurs in
T2DM is diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4)
Determining who’s at risk for type 2 diabetes
Unlike T1DM, T2DM is strongly inherited. For example, while identical 
twins with T1DM have a 60 percent chance of both getting T1DM, identical
twins with T2DM have a nearly 100 percent chance of both developing T2DM.
Nonidentical twins will both develop T2DM 40 percent of the time, but if one
has T1DM, there’s only an 8 percent chance that the other will develop T1DM.
T2DM also is much more of a lifestyle and environmental disease than T1DM.
As lifestyles change and food supplies everywhere have become readily avail-
able, the incidence of T2DM has steadily gone up with some exceptions. The
countries with the greatest increase in new cases are China and India, places
where people previously worked all day in the fields, got around on bicycles,
32
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

and survived on little food. Today, people in these countries sit in offices, drive
cars, and enjoy large meals filled with fat. In other words, they emulate people
in the U.S. Another telling example involves Japanese people. In Japan, there’s
little incidence of T2DM. Japanese who have moved to Hawaii have more cases
of T2DM, and those who have moved to the American mainland have the most.
What are the important lifestyle and environmental factors in developing
T2DM?
 Central distribution of fat: People with T2DM have apple-shaped rather
than pear-shaped bodies. They carry their weight under their belts
rather than in their arms and legs. This fat is called visceral fat because it
settles around the internal organs in the abdomen, or viscera. Visceral fat
is associated with insulin resistance and the development of diabetes as
well as coronary artery disease and heart attacks. Fortunately, visceral
fat is often the first to go with diet and regular exercise; you only need to
lose 5 to 10 percent of your weight to reduce this fat significantly and
your chance of getting T2DM or a heart attack as well.
 High body mass index: Doctors determine body mass index (BMI) by
looking at weight in relation to height. For example, 150 pounds on a 5
foot 2 inch male is too much weight, whereas 150 pounds on a 5 foot 10
inch male makes him thin.
You can determine your BMI by multiplying your weight in pounds by
703, dividing the result by your height in inches, and dividing that result
by your height in inches again. A BMI greater than 25 is considered 
overweight, and a BMI over 30 is obese in Caucasians.
 Low intake of dietary fiber: A diet low in dietary fiber (as found in whole
grains, fruits, and vegetables) is associated with a greater incidence of
T2DM. Fiber protects against T2DM in that, among other things, it slows
the uptake of glucose from the intestine into the blood.
 Physical inactivity: Every study that compares physically active individuals
with physically inactive individuals finds a higher prevalence of T2DM in the
sedentary group.
Because the environment plays such a large role in the development of T2DM,
it isn’t surprising that spouses of people with T2DM have an increased risk of
developing it and should be screened by having their blood glucose measured
(see the next section for more about screening).
Table 3-1 is intended to help you clearly see the differences between type 1
diabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Diagnosing type 2 diabetes
Mostly adults are diagnosed with T2DM, although the number of children 
being diagnosed is increasing. Because T2DM usually presents as a mild illness
(whereas folks are usually pretty sick when they’re diagnosed with T1DM), the
diagnosis depends on finding an abnormal blood glucose either in the fasting
state or after food has been eaten. The symptoms of T2DM include fatigue, 
frequent urination, and thirst, plus vaginal infections in women.
A blood glucose of 126 mg/dl or greater in the fasting state or 200 mg/dl or
greater after food consumption is diagnostic of type 2 diabetes. For an accurate
diagnosis, these numbers should be found on two occasions separated by a
week. The tests are done in the laboratory and are ordered by the primary
physician.
The American Diabetes Association recommends that all adults be screened
for T2DM beginning at age 45 and every three years thereafter if the initial
results are normal. If there’s a family history of diabetes or a risk factor such
as obesity, the initial screening should take place earlier, as early as age 25.
With so much obesity in the U.S. population, I believe that screening should
begin in obese children.
Treating type 2 diabetes
Treatment of T2DM begins with lifestyle change. The person with diabetes
needs to eat a healthy diet and lose weight, although he or she doesn’t have
to lose a great deal of weight for the glucose to return to normal. The patient
also needs to begin a program of regular exercise, preferably for 30 minutes
every day.
34
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

If lifestyle change doesn’t bring about normalization of blood glucose in the
person with T2DM, there are a number of oral agents that can lower the
blood glucose. Doctors may consider using the intramuscular drug Byetta
either before or after the use of oral agents if the agents aren’t successful.
Byetta causes weight loss and reverses many of the features of T2DM. 
If Byetta fails, insulin can be given.
Latent Autoimmune Diabetes 
in Adults (LADA)
Some folks seem to have features of both T1DM and T2DM when they’re
screened for diabetes. Some of the characteristics of their condition include:
 Adult onset (over the age of 30), as in T2DM
 Mild at presentation, as in T2DM
 Controlled initially with diet and possibly oral agents, as in T2DM
 Gradual need for insulin, as in T2DM
 Normal weight, as in T1DM
 Doesn’t respond to agents that decrease insulin resistance, as in T1DM
 Positive autoantibodies like those found in T1DM (see Chapter 2 for
more about antibodies)
 Low levels of substances that indicate the presence of insulin, as in T1DM
 No family history of T2DM, as in T1DM
In adults, this condition presents like T2DM and responds initially to drugs for
T2DM, but it also has many features of T1DM. The condition doesn’t respond
to drugs that treat insulin resistance because this central feature of T2DM isn’t
present. For this reason, the condition has been called type 11⁄2 diabetes in the
past, but the current name is latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). It
has also been called late-onset autoimmune diabetes of adulthood and slow
onset type 1 diabetes.
Some specialists believe that as many as 20 percent of patients with T2DM
actually have LADA. The distinction between T2DM and LADA is important
because the treatments differ. Both types improve with better diet and exer-
cise. However, after doctors establish the LADA diagnosis, these patients
often receive insulin treatment, although they may need very small doses.
Another feature of LADA patients is that they usually don’t have the high 
cholesterol and high blood pressure often found in people with T2DM. As a
result, their tendency to get coronary artery disease and heart attacks is less
than that of T2DM patients once the blood glucose is controlled.
35
Chapter 3: Excluding Other Types of Diabetes

A paper in Diabetes Care in April 2007 showed that there are at least two 
different subgroups of LADA:
 One group has much higher glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoanti-
bodies and more severe autoimmune diabetes with higher blood glucose
levels, lower weight, and less insulin resistance.
 The other group has lower GAD levels and much milder diabetes. See
Chapter 2 for details on GAD autoantibodies.
Delving into Diabetes Caused by 
Other Diseases and Agents
A number of important hormones help to raise the body’s blood glucose when
it’s too low, whether due to too much insulin, too little food, or too much 
exercise. Because these hormones can raise the blood glucose when they’re
present in normal amounts, they also can raise the blood glucose excessively
when they’re present in abnormally high amounts, like when there’s a tumor
in the gland that makes the hormones. If the body’s blood glucose rises over
the levels of 100 mg/dl fasting or 200 mg/dl after eating, diabetes occurs.
Some diseases cause diabetes by destroying pancreatic tissue (the pancreas
plays an important role in the development of diabetes because it produces
insulin). Drugs also can raise the blood glucose to diabetic levels. In some
such cases, the diabetes goes away when the drug is stopped (if stopping the
drug is an option).
The following sections focus on the most important and common of these
diseases and agents that cause diabetes. It’s important point to recognize
these diseases and agents and either treat or eliminate them. The diabetes
will go away if treatment or elimination can be done successfully, which isn’t
always possible.
Considering hormone-induced 
causes of diabetes
Hormones that help to raise the blood glucose when it’s too low may cause
diabetes when present in very large amounts, such as when a tumor develops
on the gland that makes a hormone. The important hormones that bring on
diabetes under these circumstances are discussed in this section.
36
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Acromegaly
Acromegaly is the disease that occurs when a benign tumor of the pituitary
gland in the brain makes excessive quantities of growth hormone. (In Chapter
2, I discuss the hormones that help to raise the blood glucose when it’s abnor-
mally lowered and mention the role of growth hormone.) Growth hormone is
essential to normal growth of the bones, but it causes diabetes among other
abnormalities when it’s present in excessive amounts.
Unfortunately, because acromegaly is relatively rare, it sometimes takes
years before the diagnosis is finally considered. Fortunately, excessive
growth hormone triggers a number of signs and symptoms that can help
point doctors to the diagnosis of acromegaly. Following are some of these
signs and symptoms of acromegaly:
 Carpal tunnel syndrome (tingling and weakness in the hand due to
squeezing of nerves in the wrist)
 Coarsening of facial features (enlargement of facial bones and the nose)
 Excessive sweating
 Headaches
 Infertility in women and erectile dysfunction in men
 Swelling of hands and feet
 Tiredness
Diabetes occurs in 40 percent of people with acromegaly, which is usually
diagnosed in adults. It appears more like T2DM than T1DM, and it’s usually
mild and can be managed with oral diabetes agents if necessary.
Doctors diagnose acromegaly by obtaining multiple growth hormone 
blood tests and finding the average. In unafflicted people, growth hormone
measurements throughout the day are usually undetectable, but people with
acromegaly have measurable levels of growth hormone in all samples. The
diagnosis is confirmed by an X-ray study of the pituitary gland, in which the
tumor can be clearly seen.
Acromegaly is treated by surgically removing the tumor. If this can’t be done 
or the patient refuses the procedure, several medications bring the growth 
hormone down to normal levels. Reducing the growth hormone level to normal
will cure the patient’s diabetes and either stop the rest of the symptoms from
worsening or reverse them.
37
Chapter 3: Excluding Other Types of Diabetes

Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome, which is usually diagnosed in adults, involves an over-
production of the hormone cortisol from the adrenal glands on the kidneys.
Cortisol is one of the hormones normally secreted to help raise blood glucose
when it’s low (see Chapter 2). When present in excessive amounts, cortisol can
cause diabetes.
The excessive production of cortisol may be the result of one of these causes:
 In 80 percent of cases, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland produces
too much of the hormone adrenocortical stimulating hormone (ACTH),
which stimulates the adrenals to make more cortisol.
 In 20 percent of cases, a benign tumor in one of the adrenals stimulates
the overproduction of cortisol.
The difference between these two causes is that there’s a lot of measurable
ACTH in the pituitary gland tumor and none in the adrenal gland tumor.
Sometimes a cancer will produce a form of ectopic ACTH that stimulates 
overproduction of cortisol, but ectopic ACTH differs from normal ACTH in
that it comes from outside the pituitary.
The most obvious symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome, such as a round face
and obesity of the trunk with wasting of the arms and legs, are rarely seen
today because patients are diagnosed at a much earlier stage. The common
signs and symptoms that suggest Cushing’s syndrome today are
 Acne
 Depression
 Easy bruising of the skin
 Loss of sexual interest
 Menstrual irregularity
 Weakness and tiredness (weakness and tiredness that come on rapidly
and severely suggest that a tumor is secreting ectopic ACTH)
Doctors diagnose Cushing’s syndrome by finding high levels of cortisol 
in the blood both in the morning and at night. In a person without Cushing’s,
the blood contains much more cortisol in the morning than in the evening.
Following the finding of abnormally high cortisol, several tests for ACTH are
taken to determine if it’s high or low:
 If the ACTH is high, X-ray studies of the pituitary gland usually identify
a tumor, which can be surgically removed. Radiation therapy to the 
pituitary also is used in some cases, especially when surgery fails to 
normalize the cortisol level.
38
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

A number of drugs that block the action of cortisol may be used to pre-
pare the patient for surgery so that he’s in the best condition possible
and to control the disease until radiation therapy can take effect.
 If the ACTH is low, X-rays of the adrenals may point to a tumor in one 
of them, which can be removed surgically to cure the condition.
In people with Cushing’s syndrome, X-rays of the chest and abdomen often
reveal the source of ectopic production of ACTH, especially when it’s a small
cell carcinoma in the lungs. The carcinoma may or may not be operable.
The diabetes that occurs with Cushing’s syndrome tends to be mild, which is
in part due to earlier diagnosis. It presents more like T2DM in that it responds
to oral agents, if necessary, but goes away if the underlying disease is cured.
The most common reason for high levels of cortisol and resultant diabetes 
is taking cortisol for its anti-inflammatory action. Cortisol is commonly pre-
scribed to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases and to prevent rejection of
transplanted organs. When the cortisol is essential, the diabetes is treated as
necessary. I discuss other chemicals that may cause diabetes in the later sec-
tion “Discovering drugs and chemicals that may cause or worsen diabetes.”
Other causes
There are a number of other diabetes-causing conditions associated with over-
production of hormones, usually due to tumors. They’re rarer than acromegaly
and Cushing’s syndrome, which I describe in the previous sections. Here’s a
rundown of what these other conditions are and who’s most likely to get them:
 Glucagonoma: This condition results from a tumor of the A cells of the
pancreas, which make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that counteracts
insulin and raises the blood glucose (see Chapter 2), and excess glucagon
can cause T2DM. The signs and symptoms of glucagonoma are weight
loss, diarrhea, and anemia. It tends to be malignant 75 percent of the time
but fortunately is very rare. It’s found in adults and is treated with surgery.
 Hyperthyroidism: This disease is caused by excessive production of thy-
roid hormone, usually due to an autoimmune stimulation of the thyroid
gland. Hyperthyroidism causes increased production of glucose from
amino acids in the liver, more rapid uptake of glucose from the intestine,
and increased insulin resistance. All these effects lead to hyperglycemia
(high blood glucose) and possible diabetes, usually of the type 2 variety.
Control of the hyperthyroidism eliminates the diabetes, and it’s rare in 
the modern era to see hyperthyroidism go on long enough for T2DM to
develop. Hyperthyroidism may be treated by antithyroid drugs, a dose of
radioactive iodine that destroys the thyroid, or surgical removal of most
of the thyroid. It’s seen most often in adults.
 Pheochromocytoma: This disease is caused by a tumor of the adrenal
gland that causes it to make excessive amounts of norepinephrine.
Excessive norepinephrine causes high blood pressure, headaches, and a
39
Chapter 3: Excluding Other Types of Diabetes

rapid heartbeat, often in recurring episodes. Because this hormone also
causes increased blood glucose, type 2 diabetes may be found in
patients with pheochromocytoma. It’s found in adults, usually, and is
treated by surgical removal of the tumor.
Examining diabetes caused by destructive
diseases of the pancreas
Several pancreatic diseases, in addition to trauma of the pancreas, can destroy
much of the gland, resulting in an absence of insulin much like T1DM. One
important difference of diabetes caused by diseases of the pancreas, however,
is that the cells that make glucagon (which raises blood glucose when it’s too
low) are destroyed along with the cells that make insulin, so the drive to make
more glucose is diminished. The following sections discuss some of the more
prominent examples of destructive diseases of the pancreas.
Pancreatitis
The pancreas has cells that make digestive enzymes as well as insulin and
other hormones. The digestive enzymes are carried to the intestine in a tube
called the pancreatic duct, but if they leak into the tissue of the pancreas, they
can digest and destroy the pancreas itself. This is what sometimes happens
when the pancreatic duct becomes blocked by a gallstone or when a person
drinks large quantities of alcohol.
The resulting inflammation of the pancreas is very painful and makes the
patient extremely sick with the following symptoms:
 Fever
 Nausea
 Rapid pulse
 Severe abdominal pain
 Swollen and tender abdomen
 Vomiting
If the patient can’t consume any more alcohol or the gallstone passes or is
removed, the symptoms subside; however, if the patient has repeated bouts 
of this same condition or the pancreatitis becomes chronic, a form of diabetes
results from the absence of insulin. Treatment is with insulin and avoidance of
alcohol. The patient is usually very responsive to insulin, and the diabetes
isn’t hard to treat, although hypoglycemia may occur.
40
Part I: Defining Type 1 Diabetes 

Cystic fibrosis
As if children with cystic fibrosis (CF) didn’t have enough to worry about, as
they grow older, about 50 percent of them develop diabetes by age 30. Cystic
fibrosis is associated with the following afflictions:
 Frequent lung infections
 Liver disease
 Obstruction of the intestine
 Reduced function of the part of the pancreas making digestive enzymes
(see the previous section for more about these enzymes)
CF is an inherited disease that causes the secretion of thick, sticky mucous
that clogs the lungs, leading to infection. The mucous also blocks the ducts
carrying digestive enzymes, leading to decreased digestion of food in the
intestine, increased digestion of the pancreas, and loss of insulin.
The life expectancy of patients with CF used to be very short, and there was
little concern about the development of diabetes. With modern methods of 
CF management, however, many more patients are living to develop diabetes.
They’re subject to complications similar to those associated with autoimmune
T1DM and must be screened for eye disease (see Chapter 5), high blood 
pressure, and kidney disease in the same way. For example, a study of 38 CF
patients in Diabetes Care in December 2006 pointed out that the prevalence of
eye disease in CF-associated diabetes is similar to autoimmune T1DM of the
same duration, about 27 percent of patients. One great difference between
autoimmune T1DM and diabetes caused by CF, however, is the absence of
coronary artery disease in the latter form because the intestine has trouble
absorbing fats.
Treatment for CF may involve lung transplantation. After the transplant,
patients receive a drug called cyclosporine to block rejection of the lung.
Cyclosporin is known to cause kidney damage, especially in combination
with T1DM.
41
Chapter 3: Excluding Other Types of Diabetes
Other autoimmune diseases associated with T1DM
The occurrence of hyperthyroidism or hypothy-
roidism (insufficient thyroid hormone) along with
T1DM is greater than expected by chance. Many
autoimmune diseases occur together in the same
person. In particular, celiac disease (intolerance to
gluten in wheat and other grains) is found in up to 5
percent of children with T1DM and causes anemia,
abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Uptake of all
foods is decreased in celiac disease, and that
includes glucose, leading to more hypoglycemia in
these patients.

The diabetes associated with CF is treated with insulin and a more liberal 
diet than is typical for someone with T1DM because of the high calorie
requirements in CF.
Discovering drugs and chemicals that 
may cause or worsen diabetes
There’s a long list of drugs and chemicals that may cause diabetes or bring out
latent diabetes in a number of different ways. Two of these chemicals are corti-
sol, which I cover in the earlier section on Cushing’s syndrome, and thyroid
hormone, which I mention in the earlier section on other hormone-induced
causes of diabetes.
Additional common agents that are associated with diabetes are
 Dilantin: A drug used for seizures. It has been shown to block the release
of insulin, leading to higher blood glucose levels. However, if needed,
dilantin can be used as long as the higher blood glucose is managed with
other agents.
 Nicotinic acid: Commonly used to treat high cholesterol levels. In the
1990s, this agent was found to raise the blood glucose in patients with
diabetes treated for high cholesterol, whether type 1 or type 2. More
recently, it has been found to cause no deterioration of blood glucose
control and can safely be used in people with diabetes.
 Pentamidine: An agent used to treat an infection associated with the
AIDS virus. It causes destruction of beta cells in the pancreas and insulin
deficiency that must be treated by replacing the insulin (like in T1DM).
 Thiazide diuretics and beta blockers: Two classes of drugs used to
treat high blood pressure. They’re associated with the onset of T2DM
when used for initial treatment of high blood pressure more often than
other drugs for high blood pressure. However, an article in the May 2007
issue of Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension points out that
there’s no evidence in any studies that this initial treatment results in
increased coronary artery disease or heart attacks. Because coronary
artery disease and heart attacks are the major cause of death in people
with diabetes, the authors conclude that “thiazide diuretics are safe to
use, even in hypertensive individuals at risk for glucose disorders.”
Unless the agent actually destroys the pancreas, the type of diabetes that
occurs with the use of these agents generally mimics T2DM. If the agent can’t
be stopped because it’s essential in the treatment of another disease, the 
diabetes is treated with lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) and the drugs
used to treat diabetes.

Considering the
Consequences of
Type 1 Diabetes

In this part . . .
P
eople used to die soon after they were diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes. This rarely happens today
because of the isolation and production of insulin since
1921. Instead of dying from the disease, people with type 1
diabetes are subject to short- and long-term complications,
all of which are preventable or manageable. This part tells
you all about those complications and how to make them
minor annoyances rather than major difficulties.
Many of the consequences of type 1 diabetes are physical,
but there’s also an emotional price paid for a chronic ill-
ness. That important topic is also addressed in this part as
I explain how to handle the emotional and psychological
effects of type 1 diabetes.

Chapter 4
Overcoming Short-Term
Complications
In This Chapter
 Handling low blood glucose
 Taking care of very high blood glucose
L
iving with type 1 diabetes can be very challenging. You or your child 
will probably have to deal with the short-term complications of the dis-
ease that I present in this chapter. The idea is to minimize the frequency of
these complications, and arming yourself with knowledge about the causes,
symptoms, prevention, and treatment of these complications is a smart move.
One potential short-term complication of type 1 diabetes is low blood 
glucose, otherwise known as hypoglycemia. You may think that you wouldn’t
have to worry about this given that the problem that sent your child to the
doctor in the first place was high blood glucose. Unfortunately, doctors don’t
yet have the tools to manage blood glucose perfectly, so in an effort to get as
close to normal blood glucose levels as possible, which is known to prevent
long-term complications of diabetes (see Chapter 5), doctors overshoot the
mark on occasion and get levels too low. You find out how to prevent, 
recognize, and treat hypoglycemia in this chapter.
I also take up diabetic ketoacidosis (very high blood glucose) in this chapter.
There are all kinds of events like trauma, infections, and severe stress that 
precipitate this condition, so you need to be able to recognize it and practice
proper management of the diabetes before it occurs. But ketoacidosis is often
unstoppable, which makes the hospital your next stop. Diabetic ketoacidosis
isn’t something you can treat yourself, so you need to know whether you or
your child is getting the right treatment from doctors and specialists. I explain
it all here.

Managing Low Blood Glucose:
Hypoglycemia
If your child has low blood glucose, you’ll know it thanks to a number of differ-
ent symptoms that can result from several possible causes. After you measure
the blood glucose and determine the severity of the episode, you can treat it
effectively. Better yet, you can (and should) try to prevent hypoglycemia
entirely! I explain what you need to know in the following sections.
Make sure that everyone who interacts with your child (or you, if you’re the
patient) knows that he has T1DM and may develop hypoglycemia. They
should know the symptoms to look for and what to do to manage it.
Determining the cause
There are many possible causes for hypoglycemia in T1DM, but it all really
comes down to too much insulin (from an external source) and too little 
glucose in the blood. Even if there’s plenty of glucose inside the cells that
require insulin, a problem still exists because the brain gets its glucose pas-
sively when the glucose in the blood is higher than the glucose in brain cells.
If insulin has driven most of the blood glucose into cells that don’t receive
glucose passively, hypoglycemia is present as far as the brain is concerned.
And that means that the child becomes confused, sleepy, and even comatose.
(Turn to Chapter 2 for a rundown on how insulin and glucose work together
in type 1 diabetes.)
Some of the scenarios that may cause hypoglycemia include:
 Too large an injection of insulin: When you give insulin to your child
(or take it yourself), you have to choose a dose that takes care of the
carbohydrates in the meal he’s about to eat as well as the level of 
carbohydrates already in his blood. Choosing the correct dose isn’t
easy. (I explain the basics of taking insulin in Chapter 10.)
 Too little food or a missed meal: A person with T1DM takes rapid-
acting insulin before meals and long-acting insulin once or twice daily.
All that circulating insulin has to be balanced with food. If not, the
person becomes hypoglycemic.
 Too much exercise using up the glucose: Exercise acts like insulin to
open the cells to glucose. As your child continues to exercise, he uses
up his glucose and may become hypoglycemic.
46
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Heavy exercise increases the risk of hypoglycemia for almost 24 hours.
As long as your child’s glucose doesn’t get too low, it’s a great way to
lower the blood glucose without insulin. I discuss all the benefits of exer-
cise for patients with diabetes in Chapter 9.
 Alcohol intake without food: Alcohol blocks the liver’s release of glucose
into the blood.
 Taking the wrong kind of insulin at bedtime: Intensive treatment of 
diabetes usually involves a rapid-acting insulin before meals and a 
long-acting insulin at bedtime. If the patient mistakenly takes the rapid-
acting insulin at bedtime, the intense effect of that insulin will produce
hypoglycemia.
 More rapid absorption of insulin from a new injection site: Repeatedly
used injection sites may become thickened and release the insulin slowly.
A new site releases the insulin into the bloodstream much more quickly,
which produces more lowering of glucose by opening more cells to the
glucose.
 Poor timing of food and insulin: Different types of insulin are active at
different times. You must know what type your child takes and when it
acts in order to keep insulin and glucose in harmony.
 Stomach problem that slows glucose absorption: Celiac disease, for
example, is an autoimmune condition that slows glucose absorption, so
the insulin may be in the bloodstream before the food. The insulin lowers
the glucose already in the blood, and the glucose in the food isn’t there
to take its place.
 Loss of hormones that raise blood glucose: A person with diabetes expe-
riences loss of glucagons, which raises blood glucose. Without glucagon,
the response to low blood glucose is severely diminished.
 Drugs that lower blood glucose too much: Drugs like aspirin that lower
the blood glucose in doses greater than the 81 mg commonly taken to
reduce heart attacks can produce hypoglycemia.
 Effect of recent low blood glucose: Recent very low glucose levels lower
the sensation of hypoglycemia to very low levels of blood glucose: You
may not realize that your blood glucose or your child’s is going down
because of unawareness (which I discuss later in this chapter in the 
section “Understanding hypoglycemic unawareness”).
 Use of beta blocker drugs for high blood pressure: These drugs reduce
the level at which hypoglycemia symptoms occur, so you or your child
may have the condition without knowing it.
47
Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications

Recognizing the symptoms
The symptoms of hypoglycemia are divided broadly into two categories:
 Adrenergic symptoms result from the secretion of hormones such as
adrenaline to increase production of glucose. (I discuss adrenaline in
more detail in Chapter 2.)
 Neuroglycopenic symptoms result from the brain not getting enough
glucose.
The adrenergic symptoms occur at a slightly higher blood glucose than the
neuroglycopenic symptoms. The actual blood glucose levels at which these
symptoms occur depends on whether control of the blood glucose has been
tight recently (with a lot of glucoses below 100) or loose (with most blood
glucoses over 200). For instance, if the adrenergic symptoms come on at a
glucose level of 70 mg/dl, the neuroglycopenic symptoms may come on at 65
mg/dl. Secreting the hormones that raise blood glucose first is a way of build-
ing up blood glucose before the brain feels the lack.
The major adrenergic signs and symptoms include the following:
48
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 
Morning highs: The Somogyi effect 
versus the dawn phenomenon
During sleep, your child’s blood glucose may fall
from the insulin he took that day, and the hor-
mones that raise blood glucose may be secreted,
resulting in a high blood glucose in the morning.
This is called the Somogyi effect after the doctor
who first described it. Some mornings, the blood
glucose may be low if it didn’t get low enough to
trigger hormone secretion, whereas other morn-
ings it may be high. If you fail to realize that the
cause is too much insulin and not too little, you
may increase your child’s insulin and make the
situation worse. Before you increase insulin at
bedtime, do a blood glucose test in the middle of
the night. If the level’s low, your child probably has
the Somogyi effect, and you should decrease, not
increase, the amount of long-acting insulin you
give him at bedtime.
Dawn phenomenon, on the other hand, is caused
by secretion of too much growth hormone during
the night so that, by morning, it has raised the
blood glucose to high levels. If your child’s morn-
ing blood glucose levels are consistently high,
nighttime long-acting insulin usually takes care of
this problem and provides a more normal morning
blood glucose.
Another possible reason for a morning high, unre-
lated to either of the previously mentioned situa-
tions, is that the insulin used at bedtime didn’t
work long enough to keep the blood glucose from
rising overnight. Older forms of insulin such as
NPH (see Chapter 10) tend to fall short in this
manner, whereas newer long-acting insulins like
glargine and detemir do not.

 Anxiety
 Irritability
 Numbness in the lips, fingers, and toes
 Palpitations (the sensation that the heart is beating too fast)
 Rapid heartbeat
 Sensation of hunger
 Sweating
 Whiteness or pallor of the skin
The major neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms include:
 Confusion and trouble concentrating
 Convulsions
 Dizziness
 Fatigue
 Feeling of warmth
 Headache
 Loss of concentration
 Poor color vision
 Reduced consciousness or coma
 Slurred speech
 Trouble hearing
 Visual disorders, like double or blurred vision
Many of these symptoms are similar to those exhibited by a drunk person,
and many people with T1DM are arrested for drunk driving when they’re
actually suffering low blood glucose. To prevent such confusion, wear a neck-
lace or bracelet that indicates that you (or your child) are diabetic. You can

Distinguishing the severity 
levels of hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia is divided into three levels of severity, depending on the 
symptoms and how difficult it is to get the patient to take some treatment 
(I discuss treatment in more detail later in this chapter):
49
Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications

 Mild hypoglycemia, which is marked by a blood glucose of about 75
mg/dl, is easily treated by the patient (or caretaker if the patient is a
child). Glucose levels come back to normal with small amounts of carbo-
hydrate. Mild hypoglycemia is usually well-tolerated, and the person can
go on with his day after he’s raised the blood glucose to normal. The
diagnosis is usually made during routine testing of the blood glucose
rather than by symptoms.
 Moderate hypoglycemia, which is marked by a blood glucose of about 
65 mg/dl, is treated by the caretaker by giving two to three glucose
tablets, waiting 20 minutes, and testing to make sure the glucose is back
to normal. If it isn’t normal, more glucose is given. It’s recognized as the
patient begins to feel the adrenergic symptoms, including rapid heartbeat
and anxiety. Moderate hypoglycemia leaves the person unable to function;
he doesn’t recognize the need for glucose and must be helped.
 Severe hypoglycemia, which is marked by a blood glucose of less than
55 mg/dl, requires the help of someone else to restore the patient’s blood
glucose. Someone with severe hypoglycemia may be unconscious. It can
leave the person with a severe headache and unable to function for lack
of glucose in the brain. A shot of glucagon is in order in this situation.
Most people with T1DM have severe hypoglycemia no more than once a year
and moderate hypoglycemia no more than twice a week. Mild hypoglycemia
occurs about 10 percent of the time as people with T1DM try to keep their
blood glucose down.
To interpret a reading accurately, you need to know whether the meter 
you use to measure blood glucose measures capillary whole blood (the entire
blood specimen including the liquid and solid parts like the red blood cells) 
or plasma (the fluid left when the solid parts are removed). A plasma reading 
is 11 percent higher than a capillary whole blood reading. My patients use 
meters that read capillary whole blood, and that’s what I use for glucose 
levels. If your meter reads plasma glucose, add 11 percent to my numbers. For
example, a capillary whole blood reading of 80 mg/dl is equal to a plasma read-
ing of 88.8 mg/dl. You can find the information necessary to understand your
reading on the meter box or in the instruction manual; if it’s not there, call the
manufacturer. (Chapter 7 has full details on measuring your blood glucose.)
If moderate or severe hypoglycemia occurs while the person is driving a car
or using complex machinery, the result can be devastating. Check your blood
glucose before driving, especially if you’re driving more than an hour, and
stop and check your levels again every few hours. Keep glucose tablets
handy in the car (see the later section “Trying other helpful tips” for more
about these tablets). If your child has T1DM and is of driving age, make sure
that he follows these recommendations.

Understanding hypoglycemic unawareness
If your child suffers from hypoglycemic unawareness, he doesn’t feel the warn-
ing adrenergic symptoms that alert him that his blood glucose is too low. He
may have a reduced or no adrenaline response as well as a reduced cortisol
and growth hormone response — this means that nothing is raising his blood
glucose as it falls. Without the warnings of palpitations, anxiety, and hunger,

Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications
Studying the effects of severe 
hypoglycemia on the brain
A major concern with severe hypoglycemia is 
the possibility of long-term damage to the brain,
especially the brain of a developing child who 
suffers seizures related to hypoglycemia. Numerous
studies have looked at this question of long-term
damage, and their results differ. One difficulty is
determining whether the decline in brain function, if
there is any, is due to low blood glucose or episodes
of high blood glucose. Here’s a roundup of some
prominent studies:
 A study from the Journal of Diabetes and Its
Complications from January 1999 looked at 
children diagnosed with diabetes before age 10.
Eighteen of 55 patients had a history of severe
hypoglycemia with seizures. The children were
given tests for memory, academic achievement,
and fine motor speed/coordination. Their sib-
lings without diabetes were tested for compar-
ison. In most cases, there was no difference in
the test performances of the diabetic children
and their nondiabetic siblings; their test results
were the same and were normal. The excep-
tions were children with a history of severe
hypoglycemia with seizures, who did more
poorly on tests of memory skills, short-term
memory, and memory of words. The children
with severe hypoglycemia without seizures
didn’t show this abnormality.
 A study from Diabetologia from January 2002
looked at 64 diabetic children between the 
ages of 7 and 16 years. They were tested four
different times in areas similar to the preceding
study. The findings showed a decline in intel-
lectual performance in boys who were diag-
nosed before age 6 but not in those diagnosed
later and not in diabetic girls. However, the
decreased intellectual performance wasn’t
correlated with severe hypoglycemia but rather
with poor control of the blood glucose and high
glucose readings. The study’s authors recom-
mended tighter control of the blood glucose,
especially for the younger boys.
 A recent, long-term study in The New England
Journal of Medicine in May 2007 compared
tight diabetic control with the much looser 
control that was the standard of care when
another study, called the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT), took place between
1983 and 1993. The recent study continued to
follow these patients for the next decade. In the
original DCCT trial, the patients were between
the ages of 18 and 34 and had diabetes from 1
to 14 years. Forty percent of the patients
reported having at least one coma or seizure
due to hypoglycemia. There was no decline in
memory or learning function in either the tightly
controlled or loosely controlled groups. After
following the DCCT patients for an average of
18 years, “no evidence of substantial long-term
declines in cognitive function was found . . .
despite relatively high rates of recurrent severe
hypoglycemia.” This is very good news.

there’s not much between your child and the symptoms associated with lack
of glucose in the brain.
Hypoglycemic unawareness occurs in about 25 percent of patients with T1DM.
The occurrence of severe hypoglycemia is much more frequent in these
patients than in those without the unawareness. It occurs more often when
one of these risk factors is present:
 Many years of diabetes
 Very tight control of the blood glucose
 Frequent and repeated hypoglycemia
In order to deal with these frequent and severe hypoglycemic reactions, it may
be necessary to allow the blood glucose to be higher than levels that prevent
long-term complications, greater than 150 mg/dl, for example. The risk is that
long-term complications are more likely to develop, but a person with diabetes
who suffers frequent severe hypoglycemia can’t function normally and is a
danger to himself and others.
Preventing and treating hypoglycemia
Preventing hypoglycemia may be time-consuming, but it’s possible and
entirely worth the effort! Even if prevention doesn’t work and your child still
has episodes of hypoglycemia, you can treat it in several different ways, as
you find out in the following sections.
Preventing hypoglycemia
The best way to prevent hypoglycemia is to be constantly aware of your 
child’s blood glucose. Meters are being developed that can measure glucose
every five minutes and beep if it falls below a set level. (See Chapter 7 for more
on these meters and for general information on measuring blood glucose.)
Unfortunately, these meters haven’t been perfected quite yet, so it’s still neces-
sary to stick your child multiple times a day in order to know his blood glu-
cose. But even periodic testing doesn’t get around the problem of not knowing
your child’s glucose for seven to eight hours while he sleeps (unless you set
your alarm to wake you for an occasional middle-of-the-night test).
When your child is asleep, he may be unaware of developing hypoglycemia,
and you certainly aren’t watching him to pick up the cues. One way to avoid
hypoglycemia during sleep is to give the child a bedtime snack containing a
slowly absorbed source of carbohydrate. Unfortunately, the best food for this
purpose, raw cornstarch, isn’t very tasty. Even better (or worse!), it needs to
52
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

be eaten cold to preserve the slow uptake of glucose. Here’s a rough guide for
how much cornstarch will help your child (or you) fend off hypoglycemia
overnight:
 A 50-pound child needs about 4 tablespoons of raw cornstarch.
 A 100-pound child or adult needs 7 tablespoons of raw cornstarch.
 A 150-pound adult needs 10 tablespoons of raw cornstarch.
And here are a couple of ways to make cornstarch somewhat appetizing for
your child:
 Dissolve raw cornstarch in a glass of milk.
 Ditch the raw cornstarch for a snack called Extend Bar. It contains only 
5 g of uncooked cornstarch, considerably less than the recommended 
30 g, but children find it more palatable than the raw stuff. A study in
Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice in September 2001 showed that
Extend Bar kept the nighttime blood glucose in a non-hypoglycemic
range when eaten by adults at bedtime. (The study results with adults
indicate that Extend Bars are an effective option for children.) You 
can buy Extend Bars at some drugstores or order them online at
www.extendbar.com; visit the Web site for more information.
Another way to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia is to keep as regu-
lar a schedule for your child as you possibly can. If he wakes up at around
the same time, eats at around the same time, eats around the same amount of
carbohydrates, and exercises around the same amount each day, you’ll know
how much insulin to give him. Very few people can do this because life inter-
venes with parties, travel to different time zones, meals eaten away from
home, and sleeping late on the weekends. But fear not; I explain how to live
well with type 1 diabetes in Part IV.
Adjusting insulin amounts for hypoglycemia
If you’re unable to prevent hypoglycemia outright, one thing that you can 
do to treat it is know which insulin is most responsible for the blood glucose
at a given time. If hypoglycemia occurs during that time, you can adjust the
insulin down slowly (1 to 2 units a day, and then don’t change it again for
three to five days) until the hypoglycemia subsides.
Table 4-1 shows you which insulin — rapid-acting or long-acting — is active
at certain times of day, assuming that you use the standard therapy of three
shots of rapid-acting insulin or three doses of inhaled insulin before meals
and one or two shots of long-acting insulin in the morning or both morning
and evening.

You can see from Table 4-1 that, in general, rapid-acting insulin is responsible
for blood glucose for the first couple of hours after meals, whereas long-acting
insulin is responsible for all blood glucose the rest of the time. For example, if
your child becomes hypoglycemic at about 9 a.m. most mornings, around two
hours after breakfast, you need to reduce his pre-breakfast rapid-acting insulin.
If the hypoglycemia comes on around 11 p.m., around four hours after dinner,
then he’s getting too much basal insulin (see Chapter 10 for an explanation of
basal insulin).
Unfortunately, things aren’t always so clear-cut. Your child may have hypo-
glycemia one day and hyperglycemia at the same time the next day even if you
do everything the same way. In the final analysis, you may have to go back to
that old standby, trial and error.
Using a glucose meter with a memory that you can download to a computer
data management system is essential in recognizing patterns in your blood 
glucose. Among other things, the computer can show you all the tests during 
a given time period, indicating whether your child’s glucose levels are typically
high or low at that time. Your child’s doctor should have this capability. (If you
want to be able to download this information yourself, call the meter manufac-
turer using the 800 number on the meter.)
Trying other helpful tips to treat all severity levels
Some of the practices I recommend here for treating hypoglycemia may seem
obvious, but they’ll come in handy when your mind goes blank in the middle
of a hypoglycemic episode happening to your son or daughter (or to you, if
you’re the patient). Most of these tips work for treating mild or moderate
hypoglycemia (the last one is for severe hypoglycemia):
54
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

 Glucose tablets, which contain 4 g of glucose and are available over-the-
counter, are usually the best way to treat mild to moderate hypoglycemia;
two to four tablets is enough for most children and adults. More than that
will cause hyperglycemia and you’ll be tempted to give rapid-acting
insulin to treat it, creating a vicious circle.
If your child has trouble swallowing, give him honey instead of glucose
tablets. One teaspoon of honey is about 5 g of glucose, so you need
about 3 teaspoons to give the equivalent of three to four glucose tablets.
 Don’t push large quantities of food into the child. The result will be a
high rather than a normal blood glucose. A piece of fruit may be all
that’s needed.
 Giving your child 11⁄2 cups of orange juice effectively raises the blood glu-
cose back to the normal range of 90 to 100 mg/dl. Cartons of juice may be
a convenient way to have a quick and satisfying source of glucose to treat
hypoglycemia. A cup of apple juice or lemon-lime soda both work as well
and may be used when glucose tablets aren’t available.
 Always check the blood glucose 20 minutes after treating the hypo-
glycemia and give another treatment if the level remains below 100 mg/dl.
 Keep the child quiet and inactive for 15 to 30 minutes after the reaction.
Activity tends to lower the blood glucose again.
 Use a prescription glucagon emergency shot for an unconscious child
who has severe hypoglycemia. Just make sure that the glucagon hasn’t
expired.
If the child doesn’t wake up in 10 to 15 minutes even though his blood
glucose is normal, call 911.
Dealing with Very High Blood Glucose:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe diabetic complication that has to be
managed in a hospital. It’s characterized by high blood glucose (though it
need not be very high) associated with an acid condition of the blood due to
the production of ketones, which are the products of fat breakdown. The root
of the illness is a lack of insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose can’t get
into insulin-dependent cells like muscle and the liver, so glucose accumulates
in the blood, and the body turns to fat for energy.
In the following sections, I outline the causes, symptoms, prevention, and
treatment of DKA.
55
Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications

Although it’s thought of as an illness of children, DKA occurs more often in
adults than in children. Sixty percent of cases occur in people who are 40
years of age or older. DKA can result in death, especially in the elderly popula-
tion when it’s paired with other serious underlying diseases like heart disease,
kidney disease, and infection. Over the age of 65, the death rate may be as
high as 30 percent, but the overall death rate for DKA is less than 5 percent.
Considering some potential causes
About 30 percent of children and 20 percent of adults with T1DM have DKA
as their initial presentation. They may have had T1DM for some time, but
because they or their parents aren’t aware of the signs and symptoms and
because T1DM doesn’t run in families, the illness progresses to the point that
the individuals become severely sick.
DKA also occurs after the diagnosis of T1DM is known. The major reasons for
this include:
 Infections: Usually the infection is pneumonia in the lungs or infection 
of the urine. Infection is the most common cause of DKA.
 Interruption of insulin treatment: Some children, particularly girls, 
recognize that not taking insulin shots results in weight loss. They may
rapidly develop DKA hours after stopping insulin. Insulin treatment also
may be interrupted in people using insulin pumps to deliver the insulin
(see Chapter 11 for more about these pumps). Any cutoff of insulin from
the pump may precipitate DKA. DKA occurs less frequently in pump
users than in people who take shots of insulin and usually is most
common at the start of pump usage. As patients become more familiar
with the pump, it becomes rare.
 Other acute conditions: Conditions such as severe trauma, acute 
alcoholism, severe psychological stress, heart attack, stroke, and severe
pancreatic inflammation can lead to DKA.
 Certain drugs: Drugs known to raise blood glucose, like cortisol and the
thiazide class of drugs for high blood pressure, as well as certain drugs
used to treat psychosis, like clozapine and olanzapine, contribute to
DKA in people with T1DM.
 Poor adherence to treatment, especially among people who can’t
afford their insulin: Patients with financial difficulties may reduce the
needed dose or stop taking insulin altogether. Some patients mistakenly
think that if they’re sick and can’t eat, they don’t need to take insulin.
56
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Surveying the symptoms
Many signs and symptoms of DKA make the diagnosis obvious once it’s con-
sidered. However, for the person who isn’t known to have diabetes, DKA isn’t
always so clear. With or without an existing diabetes diagnosis, the major
symptoms include the following:
 Abdominal pain: Especially frequent in children, abdominal pain occurs
for unclear reasons but seems to be associated with the acid condition
of the blood. With treatment, the pain disappears within hours.
 Frequent urination and thirst: As the blood glucose rises, it enters the
urine, pulling water and other important nutrients along with it. The
high glucose content of the urine prevents the kidneys from restoring
the water to the body. The patient has to urinate a great deal, and the
loss of water leads to dehydration and thirst.
 Nausea and vomiting: The acid condition of the blood along with failure
of the normal movement of food and liquids down the gastrointestinal
tract leads to nausea and vomiting.
 Weakness: Inability to get glucose into cells for energy, dehydration, and
other factors lead to weakness.
 Weight loss: The lack of insulin means that glucose can’t be stored in the
liver, amino acids can’t be turned into protein to produce muscle, and fat
can’t be stored when calories are excessive. In fact, fat breakdown takes
place to provide the energy not available from glucose, further resulting
in weight loss.
A strict diet doesn’t lead to ketoacidosis. Diabetic or not, if you go on 
a strict diet to lose weight, your body burns its fat stores, producing
ketones, in a way similar to how it burns fat when you lack insulin. But 
in the case of a strict diet, your glucose remains normal and enters cells,
and (unless you have T1DM) you have sufficient insulin to prevent the
excessive production of new glucose or the release of large amounts of
glucose from your liver.
 Smell of acetone on the breath: This fruity smell is the smell of the
ketone bodies, which are the products of fat breakdown that are excreted
in the urine but can be exhaled as well.
 Confusion or coma: As the thickened, syrupy blood, which is very 
acid, circulates through the brain, brain cells are exposed to abnormal
nutrients and miss other nutrients that have been lost in the urine.
 Cold skin and body temperature: Unless the cause is an infection, the
skin is cold as the body’s metabolism declines because cells don’t get
glucose for energy.
57
Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications

 Rapid, shallow breathing followed by deep, labored breathing: Called
Kussmaul breathing after the German doctor who first described it, this
unusual breathing pattern is an attempt to blow off some of the acid
through the lungs.
If you suspect that your child has DKA, there are a couple of quick tests you
can do at home to verify the diagnosis:
 Check the blood glucose with your home meter (see Chapter 7). With
DKA, it will generally read greater than 250 mg/dl, but some cases of
mild DKA may have a glucose under 250 mg/dl.
 Check the urine for ketones (see Chapter 7). With DKA, the reading will
be high, as shown by a deep purple color when you immerse the test
strip into a cup of urine.
After you verify DKA with a home test, or if you suspect that you or your
child has DKA even without a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, dial 911, and then
call your doctor to tell him or her that you’re on the way to the hospital.
Preventing and treating 
diabetic ketoacidosis
The basis of ketoacidosis treatment is to simultaneously
 Restore the proper amount of water to the body
 Reduce the acid condition of the blood by getting rid of the ketones
 Restore substances such as potassium that have been lost
 Return blood glucose to its normal level of around 80 to 120 mg/dl
The treatment of DKA is left in the hands of the experts, but you should know
what’s being done, in general, so that you understand what your child is going
through. In the following sections, I explain what happens during treatment
and give you a few pointers for preventing DKA entirely.
Although you can’t take care of your child with diabetic ketoacidosis on 
your own, it’s important that you recognize the signs and symptoms (see the
previous section). Like most illnesses, the earlier you begin to reverse the
abnormalities with treatment, the quicker the patient recovers and the lower
the chance of further complications or death.
Taking measures to prevent DKA
Because infection is the major precipitating cause of DKA, prevention begins
with the best possible sick-day care (see Chapter 15 for details). An important
58
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

first step is realizing that just because your child’s sick and not eating doesn’t
mean that he doesn’t still need insulin — and perhaps needs more than usual.
Performing more testing of glucose more frequently, especially on sick days, 
is another key step. It’s also important to be very aware of the signs and 
symptoms of DKA.
Receiving treatment at the hospital
Traditionally, DKA has been treated in intensive care units, but there’s no 
evidence that this setting has any benefit over the conventional medicine ward.
Death rates, length of stay in the hospital, and rapidity of recovery are no
lower in the intensive care unit, which is far more expensive. Ask the doctor if
care in the intensive care unit is necessary before your child is admitted there.
In the hospital, your child’s doctor sets up a flowchart to keep track of 
glucose, acid, potassium, and ketones. Although your child may have lost a
lot of potassium, for example, the initial blood reading for potassium may be
normal. As treatment progresses, potassium enters cells along with glucose
to replenish the losses there, so his blood potassium may fall. Then the
doctor administers potassium to fix the problem. As he does this, he looks
for the underlying cause that may have set off the DKA, such as an infection,
and treats it with antibiotics as necessary.
The first step in treatment is to begin replacing the large amounts of fluids
that have been lost. At the same time, your child receives insulin to shut
down fat metabolism and allow the large amount of glucose in the blood to
enter cells. Traditionally, insulin is given as a constant intravenous (IV) drip,
but if the hospital doesn’t permit IV treatment outside the intensive care unit,
injections of rapid-acting insulin every one to two hours are just as safe and
effective. Injected insulin begins to work in ten minutes and continues for
three to four hours, although it peaks in the first hour (see Chapter 10 for the
basics of insulin use).
At some point, your child’s blood glucose may fall towards hypoglycemia
(which I discuss earlier in this chapter). When this begins to happen, the
intravenous fluids that have contained no glucose up until then begin to 
contain glucose along with normal levels of sodium. Potassium is added in
the IV if blood tests indicate that your child’s potassium has fallen to low
levels.
The doctor gives your child large volumes of a saltwater solution intravenously
to replace the 6 or more liters of fluids lost during DKA. Replenishing body
fluids relieves the nausea and vomiting that he’s endured, and he should be
able to eat and keep down liquid and solid food once again. Your child’s normal
mental function is returning as well. If you already were aware of your child’s
diabetes, you’re ready to help him resume self-care. If not, you both have 
to begin the lifetime learning that diabetes requires (see Chapter 2 for an 
introduction).
59
Chapter 4: Overcoming Short-Term Complications

Watching out for potential complications
Most cases of DKA respond to treatment, and the patient is able to resume
daily life after a few days in the hospital. If the patient is being carefully moni-
tored with frequent tests for blood glucose, potassium, and so forth, the most
common complications can be avoided. Occasionally, a complication occurs;
the major complications in order of frequency are
 Hypoglycemia: This usually happens because glucose hasn’t been
added to the intravenous fluids after the blood glucose reaches 250
mg/dl. Hypoglycemia also may result because the insulin being given
isn’t reduced sufficiently as the glucose falls. This complication is
avoided by measuring the blood glucose every hour or two.
 Low potassium: A patient with DKA loses a lot of potassium from inside
cells that have to regain their potassium in order to return to a normal
state. Typically, glucose and potassium enter cells as insulin is given.
However, prior to giving insulin, the blood potassium level can fall to dan-
gerously low levels, which may result in serious abnormal heart rhythms.
If the initial potassium measurement is low in the blood, it may be safer
to replenish the potassium along with fluids before giving insulin to avoid
this complication.
 Relapse of DKA: This may happen when there’s a lack of insulin during
the time between giving intravenous insulin for treatment of the DKA and
giving subcutaneous insulin to return the patient to his usual program. 
To be safe, a long-acting subcutaneous insulin should be given two hours
before the intravenous insulin is stopped. Or if only subcutaneous insulin
is used, long-acting insulin may be given several hours before the frequent
doses of subcutaneous insulin are stopped to provide some basal insulin
until the next mealtime shot of insulin.
 Cerebral edema: This complication is a swelling of the brain that occurs
less than 1 percent of the time, more often in children, and is associated
with the rare deaths that occur in DKA. Symptoms include headaches,
decreased consciousness, seizures, and urinary incontinence. The cause
of cerebral edema is unknown. It begins about 12 hours after treatment
begins for DKA, and drugs that are given to reduce the brain swelling are
sometimes effective.

Complications

T
his chapter is the bad news–good news chapter. The bad news is that if
you don’t manage your diabetes or your child’s diabetes properly, you or
your child will suffer one or several of the serious long-term complications
that I discuss here. The good news is that everything is in place now to 
prevent this from ever happening; in Part III, I tell you what you need to know
about controlling and treating type 1 diabetes.
The long-term complications in this chapter take between 10 and 20 years to
develop. Long-term complications of type 1 diabetes (which I abbreviate
T1DM) are divided into microvascular complications and macrovascular
complications:
 Microvascular complications affect the tiny blood vessels that you
wouldn’t ordinarily see without magnification. They consist of
• Retinopathy, or eye damage
• Nephropathy, or kidney damage
• Neuropathy, or nerve damage
The abnormalities that cause eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve 
disease are similar. You can read more about them in the later sidebar
“The potential causes of microvascular complications.”
 Macrovascular complications affect the body’s large blood vessels. They
primarily consist of heart problems such as coronary artery disease and
heart attacks.

In this chapter, I discuss both microvascular and macrovascular long-term
complications of T1DM as well as other diseases that occur more often in
people with T1DM and complicate the treatment of T1DM because of the fact
that autoimmune diseases tend to occur together.
Focusing on Eye Disease
The main eye complications of T1DM are cataracts and retinopathy.
 Cataracts are opaque areas of the lens. Cataracts occur in no more than
1 percent of children with T1DM. In both children and adults, if the
cataract is blocking vision, the cataract is removed by surgery and a
new lens is implanted, restoring vision.
 Retinopathy is considerably more common than cataracts, varying from
15 percent to 50 percent occurrence in patients with T1DM in different
studies. It’s considerably less common today than it was before the era
of intensive diabetic treatment.
In order to understand retinopathy, you need to know the normal appearance
of the eye and its structures. Figure 5-1 shows the structure of the eye.
62
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(DCCT) was published in The New England Journal
of Medicine in September 1993. This study of
patients with T1DM proved that control of the blood
glucose would prevent complications from devel-
oping. Also, the study showed that the progression
of complications that had already developed could
be slowed.
Researchers divided patients involved in the study
into two groups: 730 patients were treated with
the usual treatment of the time, consisting of one
or two insulin injections daily, and 711 patients
were given intensive treatment with either three
or more shots of insulin daily or an insulin pump.
After six and a half years, the study was termi-
nated because the results were so clear:
 It was possible even in 1993 to achieve a level
of blood glucose control that would prevent
long-term complications in T1DM.
 Intensive therapy reduced the risk of retinopa-
thy (eye disease) by 76 percent compared to
conventional therapy. In patients who already
had retinopathy, intensive therapy reduced
the risk that it would progress to a severe form
by 47 percent and reduced the need for treat-
ment by 56 percent.
 Intensive therapy reduced the risk of devel-
opment of microalbuminuria, a early sign of
diabetic kidney damage, by 43 percent.
 Intensive therapy reduced the risk of nerve
damage due to diabetes by 69 percent.
After the DCCT, no one could doubt that persistently
high blood glucose acts as a poison in the body.
Furthermore, the patients in the DCCT continue 
to be followed. Fifteen years after the study, the
group that had intensive therapy has a sustained
benefit; they continue to have reduced eye damage,
occurrence of kidney diseases, and nerve damage.

In a nutshell, vision works this way: Light enters the eye through the lens,
where it’s bent and focused upon the retina. The place in the retina where the
lens focuses is called the macula. The retina collects the image and transfers
it to the optic nerve, which carries it to the brain where the image is inter-
preted. Between the lens and the retina is a transparent material called the
vitreous body. The eye muscles surround the eye on all sides and are attached
to it, permitting you to look up, down, and sideways without moving your
head. These eye muscles are important in the discussion of diabetic nerve
damage called neuropathy, which I cover later in this chapter in the section
“Knowing about Nerve Disease.”
Retinopathy is broken down into two major forms depending upon the poten-
tial to cause vision loss: background retinopathy and proliferative retinopathy.
In both forms, the major damage takes place on the retina. Figure 5-2 shows a
normal retina, a retina with background retinopathy, and a retina with prolifera-
tive retinopathy. You can see that in Figure 5-2A, the normal retina shows a
dark spot, the macula, which is the central spot that the image focuses upon.
The light area is the optic nerve from which small blood vessels branch out,
cascading toward the macula.
In the following sections, I explain the symptoms, prevention, and treatment
of background retinopathy and proliferative retinopathy.
Because diabetic eye disease takes years to develop, the current recommen-
dation is to have your or your child’s eyes examined by an ophthalmologist or
optometrist when T1DM is first detected, five years after T1DM is diagnosed,
and once a year thereafter as long as the examination remains normal. See
Chapter 7 for more about eye checks.

Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Adults in particular need to be aware of the following points about retinopathy,
including behaviors and other conditions that are associated with it:
 Males and females develop retinopathy at about the same rate.
 The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely he or she is to develop
diabetic retinopathy.
 High blood pressure worsens retinopathy.
 Smoking and heavy alcohol use worsen retinopathy.
 Persons with severe diabetic retinopathy are at increased risk for heart
attacks.
Background retinopathy
Figure 5-2B shows the more benign form of diabetic retinopathy. The signs of
background retinopathy, which are detected by an ophthalmologist or
optometrist, include the following:
 Retinal aneurysms are the result of weakening of the capillaries of the eye,
appearing like tiny balloons on the capillaries. This first symptom of the
condition appears as small red dots on the retina. They usually disappear
over time.

Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

 Sometimes the weakened capillaries rupture and release blood, forming
retinal hemorrhages and hard exudates. The hard exudates are yellowish
and appear round and sharp. They’re actually scars left from the hemor-
rhage. If they extend into the macular area, they reduce vision. If the
capillaries in the retina allow fluid to flow into the macula, the patient
gets macular edema, which also reduces vision. These exudates and
hemorrhages can last for years.
 As the capillaries close, there’s a decreased blood supply to the retina,
and cotton wool spots or soft exudates appear. They appear as small areas
of yellowish-white discoloration on the retina.
These changes usually don’t cause complete loss of vision but may develop
into the more serious proliferative retinopathy if the T1DM isn’t brought
under control by making the blood glucose as normal as possible.
Proliferative retinopathy
Figure 5-2C shows an eye that suffers from proliferative retinopathy. If
untreated, this condition results in partial or complete loss of vision. Just as
in many other parts of the body, when the blood supply in the eye is reduced,
new vessels form to carry more blood to the retina. When this happens, the
patient is entering the stage of proliferative retinopathy. The blood vessels
grow into the vitreous body where they can hemorrhage and block vision. A
hemorrhage forms a clot, which contracts, pulling up the retina to produce
retinal detachment. The lens can no longer focus the light on the macula,
resulting in complete loss of vision.
Many studies have aimed to develop drugs that may block proliferative
retinopathy, but none has been successful so far. However, laser surgery may
be used to reduce the damage caused by retinopathy and prevent blindness.
Laser surgery causes burns in the retina that result in scars that prevent the
retina from being pulled away by a hemorrhage in the vitreous body. Only 5
percent of diabetics with proliferative retinopathy who undergo laser treat-
ment develop severe vision loss. However, there’s some minor loss of vision
at the sites where the retina is burned, and there’s a decrease in night vision
and the visual field (the area the eye can see at one time). Laser treatment
can be used to treat macular edema that affects vision as well.
If a person with T1DM has already experienced retinal detachment, an opera-
tion called a vitrectomy is necessary. Under general anesthesia, the vitreous
body is replaced with a sterile solution. Attachments to the retina are cut,
and the retina falls back into place. Vitrectomy restores vision 80 to 90 per-
cent of the time.

Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Coping with Kidney Disease
Kidney disease due to diabetes is known as diabetic nephropathy, and it devel-
ops in less than half of the people at risk to get it. Some important factors 
contribute to kidney disease (some of which you can’t change and some of
which you can):
 Abnormal blood fats promote thickening in the kidneys. You can reduce
this contributing factor.
 Certain ethnic groups, especially African Americans, Native Americans,
and Mexican Americans, tend to have nephropathy more often. You can’t
change this.
 Elevated blood pressure damages the kidneys of a person with diabetes.
Blood pressure should be measured at each doctor’s visit and compared
with the appropriate chart for age, height, and weight (Chapter 7 has more
about measuring blood pressure). You can control blood pressure; for
assistance, check out my book High Blood Pressure For Dummies (Wiley).
66
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 
The potential causes of microvascular 
complications
The exact cause of microvascular complications
isn’t certain, but a number of different mechanisms
have been proposed (persistent high blood glu-
cose is the basis for all the mechanisms as shown
by the DCCT study discussed in the earlier sidebar
“The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial”):
 When glucose is elevated, some of it gets
converted to another compound called sor-
bitol. Sorbitol accumulates in the lens of the
eye, where it causes swelling and damage to
the lens; the result is a cataract, an opaque
area that you can’t see through. Sorbitol also
accumulates in the retina of the eye, the
glomeruli in the kidneys, and the Schwann
cells that provide insulation for nerve tissue.
In each area, excess sorbitol causes damage.
 Protein kinase C consists of a group of 
chemicals in the body that help to control
movement of substances in and out of cells
and enlargement of blood vessels to improve
flow. Persistent high blood glucose leads to
increase in protein kinase C, especially in the
retina and the glomeruli as well as in nerve
tissue. At these high doses, the protein kinase
C leads to reduced blood flow by promoting
atherosclerosis in small vessels and therefore
diminished oxygen to these tissues. The tis-
sues then may die or fail to function normally.
 Elevated glucose causes advanced glycation
end products (AGEs) to form in tissues. AGEs
cause increased flow of damaging substances
into cells and increased production of new
cells, which block the tiny spaces needed for
proper function in the kidneys and proper vision
in the eyes.
 Vasoproliferative factors are compounds that
cause increased production of small blood
vessels in the retina of the eye that are very
fragile and can bleed and block vision. In nerve
tissue, new vessels may carry blood away
from the nerves that need it.

In the following sections, I explain the impact of uncontrolled diabetes on the
kidneys and tell you how to prevent and treat kidney damage.
The effects of uncontrolled 
diabetes on the kidneys
Uncontrolled diabetes can affect the kidneys in many ways, depending on the
stage of the disease. Luckily, with regular testing for an important indicator
(microalbuminuria), anyone can lessen the impact of kidney disease before it
progresses.
Early changes in the kidneys
Figure 5-3 shows the appearance of the normal glomerulus of the kidney, the
structure that filters the blood. There are 2 million of these glomeruli in a
person’s kidneys, so loss of even a whole kidney isn’t fatal.
Blood passes through the tiny glomerular capillaries, which are in intimate 
contact with tubules through which filtered blood travels. As the filtered blood
passes through the tubules, most of the water and the normal contents of the
blood are reabsorbed into the body while a small amount of water and waste
passes from the kidneys into the ureter, into the bladder, and out the urethra
(refer to Figure 5-3). The loops of capillaries are supported by a thin membrane
called the mesangium and are surrounded by a sac called the Bowman’s cap-
sule. Between the capillaries and the mesangium is the glomerular basement
membrane, the membrane through which filtration takes place.

Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

As diabetes proceeds, if control of the blood glucose is poor, the glomerular
basement membrane and other nearby structures begin to thicken and take
up the space occupied by the capillaries (see Figure 5-4). The tight quarters
mean that the capillaries can’t filter as much blood as they should. The rate
of filtration, or glomerular filtration rate, begins to fall.
Microalbuminuria: An early indicator
As diabetes affects the kidneys, they begin to leak tiny amounts of protein. This
indicator of kidney disease is called microalbuminuria and can be measured in
a small sample of urine (see Chapter 7 for more about regularly testing for
microalbuminuria).
Microalbuminuria should be measured on more than one occasion to confirm
the elevation because many events can cause a falsely elevated reading,
including the following:
 Blood in the urine
 Fever
 Heavy exercise
 Infection
 Menstruation
 Smoking
 Very high blood glucose

Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Microalbuminuria is rare in children before puberty, regardless of the duration
of the diabetes and the level of control. Some specialists suggest, therefore,
that it isn’t necessary to screen prepubescent children for microalbuminuria.
The American Diabetes Association recommends that all patients with T1DM
be screened for microalbuminuria beginning at five years after the diagnosis
and every year thereafter.
Microalbumin can be detected about five years before a urine dipstick (which
tests for macroalbuminuria — greater than 300 mg/ml) would test positive for
albumin, which is great news because treatment in this early stage can reverse
the kidney disease. A study in The New England Journal of Medicine in June
2003 showed that lowering blood pressure, blood glucose, and abnormal blood
fats decreased the microalbuminuria and the decline in kidney failure.
Progressive changes
If the blood glucose isn’t kept down so that a test called the hemoglobin A1c
(see Chapter 7) is less than 7 percent over 10 to 20 years, changes begin to
occur in the kidneys. The earliest signs are enlarged kidneys that seem to be
functioning abnormally well judging by how fast they clear wastes from the
body. This over-functioning results from the large amount of glucose that the
kidneys are filtering. The glucose draws a lot of water with it, causing an
increase in the pressure in each glomerulus.
After about two years of poor glucose control, a biopsy of the kidney should
indicate that the basement membrane and the mesangium are thickened.
The next 10 to 15 years is a silent period during which there are no clinical
signs that the kidneys are failing. But after 15 years of poor control, there are
measurable signs of kidney failure as waste products accumulate in the blood,
especially blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. This is the stage of azotemia,
significant reduction in kidney filtration but not complete cessation.
By 20 years of poor control, the patient either begins dialysis or has a kidney
transplant in order to survive. At this stage, the patient has uremia, which is
an inability to cleanse the blood at all.
Preventing kidney disease
The best treatment for kidney disease is preventative. If you can’t prevent it
with the following measures, you can at least slow it down if you
 Control your child’s (or your) blood glucose. If you keep your child’s
blood glucose close to normal, he won’t develop diabetic neuropathy.
Part III is all about controlling blood glucose with testing, a healthy diet,
regular exercise, and more.
69
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Keep your child’s (or your) blood pressure below the 95th percentile for
age and height. If you have microalbuminuria, you can use a class of
drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These drugs
reverse microalbuminuria while lowering blood pressure.
 Control the blood fats by lowering total and bad cholesterol and triglyc-
erides and increasing good cholesterol. The best way to do this is to take
one of a class of drugs called statins.
 Avoid other kidney damage. People with diabetes tend to have urinary
tract infections that can further damage the kidneys, so your child needs
to drink plenty of fluids and acidify the urine with cranberry juice (the
bugs don’t like an acid urine) to avoid these infections. Nerve damage is
also a risk, resulting in a neurogenic bladder with poor emptying of urine
and a tendency to develop more urinary tract infections. (I discuss
nerve damage later in this chapter.)
Treating kidney disease if prevention fails
When the kidneys reach the stage of uremia (see the earlier section
“Progressive changes”), there’s no alternative to dialysis, a mechanical
cleansing of the blood, or transplantation of a healthy kidney. Two 
techniques are currently in use for dialysis:
 Hemodialysis requires that the patient’s artery be hooked to a tube that
runs through a filtering machine. This machine draws blood from the
body, cleanses it, and sends it back into the patient’s bloodstream. When
the patient is moderately well, hemodialysis is done three times a week in
a hospital-like setting. Hemodialysis can be associated with complications
like infections and low blood pressure. The patient usually has to go to
the center to have it done.
 Peritoneal dialysis may be done at home. A tube is inserted into the peri-
toneal cavity, the body cavity containing the stomach, liver, and intestines.
A large quantity of fluid is dripped into the peritoneal cavity, and the body
wastes are drawn out into the peritoneal cavity. After several hours, the
fluid is drained out with its wastes. Glucose must be placed in the fluid,
and this complicates control of the patient’s diabetes. Peritoneal dialysis
usually must be done daily, and it’s possible to travel while undergoing
this type of dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may be associated with infection
of the tube, just like hemodialysis.
There’s little difference between these two forms of dialysis in terms of long-
term survival. The decision to go with one over the other is based on conve-
nience and whether your insurance has better coverage for one or the other.
70
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

For patients with diabetes, transplantation works better than dialysis, but
healthy kidneys are difficult to come by in the United States, so 80 percent 
of all kidney failure patients use dialysis while 20 percent have kidney trans-
plants. A transplanted kidney is foreign to the recipient, so his or her body
tries to reject it. That’s why the recipient receives antirejection drugs, which
unfortunately complicate diabetes control, especially steroids. Transplantation
works best if the kidney is from a donor closely related to the recipient; this
arrangement reduces the chance of rejection. Control of the blood glucose is
essential to prevent damage to the new kidney.
Knowing about Nerve Disease
The third kind of microvascular complication resulting from poor glucose
control involves the nervous system and is called diabetic neuropathy. The
tiny blood vessels supplying the nerve tissue are damaged by the mecha-
nisms discussed in the earlier sidebar “The potential causes of microvascular
complications.” The result is loss of nerve conduction with numbness and
tingling in some cases and pain in others.
Neuropathy becomes more severe the longer diabetes remains out of control.
It usually takes ten years to develop, so it’s not seen in young children who
have had diabetes only a few years. Diabetic neuropathy occurs in some form
or another in up to 75 percent of patients with T1DM, but this figure is falling.
Neuropathy is made worse in adults by the following conditions:
 Age: It becomes more common with age.
 Height: It’s most common in taller individuals who have longer nerve
fibers to damage.
 Alcohol consumption: Even small quantities of alcohol can make neuropa-
thy worse.
The speed with which a nervous impulse travels down a nerve is called the
nerve conduction velocity (NCV). In diabetic neuropathy, the NCV is slowed. At
first, the only symptom is an abnormal NCV, which is tested by using needles at
the ends of a nerve and detecting how long a stimulus takes to travel from one
end to the other. As early minor symptoms like mild loss of sensation develop,
the only way to verify the result of any treatment, whether it’s better glucose
control or some medication, may be repeating the NCV. However, the degree of
NCV slowing doesn’t always correlate with the severity of symptoms.
Several different kinds of nerve fibers are responsible for different kinds of
sensation such as vibration, light touch, and temperature. These fibers can
be tested in the following ways:
71
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Vibration testing: A tuning fork discloses damage to vibration nerve
fibers, which are large. A result of damage to these nerves may be that
you have poor balance.
 Temperature testing: A hot or cold item discloses damage to temperature
fibers, which are small and frequently damaged in people with diabetes.
The result of damage may be that you get into a very hot bath without
realizing that it may burn you.
 Light touch testing: A filament reflects the large fibers that sense anything
that touches the skin. The amount of force needed to bend the filament to
a point that you feel it is measured in grams (g). A person who can feel a
10 g filament is able to feel anything that may damage his foot. A person
who can’t feel a filament requiring 75 g of force is considered to have lost
all sensation in the tested area. The consequence of such damage may be
that you’re unaware of stepping on a nail.
The various disorders of the nervous system in diabetes are broken down
into the following categories:
 Disorders associated with loss of sensation, where the sensory nerves
are damaged
 Disorders associated with loss of motor nerves, which carry impulses to
muscles to make them move
 Disorders due to loss of automatic nerves (also known as autonomic
nerves), which control muscles that you don’t have to think about, such
as the heart, the intestinal muscles, and the bladder muscles
The following sections describe the various conditions associated with these
disorders.
Disorders of sensation
Disorders of sensation are the most common and bothersome nerve disorders
associated with diabetes. A number of different conditions break down into 
diffuse neuropathies involving many nerves and focal neuropathies involving
one or a few nerves.
Distal polyneuropathy
Distal polyneuropathy is the most frequently occurring form of diabetic neu-
ropathy. “Distal” means “far away from the center of the body,” like the feet
and hands. “Poly” means “many,” and neuropathy is disease in nerves. So this
is a disease of many nerves noticed in the hands and feet.
The signs and symptoms of distal polyneuropathy include:
72
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

 Diminished ability to feel light touch (numbness) or feel the position 
of a foot, whether bent backward or forward, resulting from the loss of
large fibers
 Diminished ability to feel pain and temperature, resulting from the loss
of small fibers
 Minimal weakness
 Tingling and burning
 Extreme sensitivity to touch
 Loss of balance and coordination
 Worsening of symptoms at night
The danger of this kind of neuropathy is that the patient doesn’t know, without
looking, whether he has trauma to his feet, such as a burn or a puncture. When
the small nerve fibers are lost, the symptoms aren’t as serious. The majority of
patients with distal polyneuropathy are unaware of the loss of nerve fibers, and
the disease is detected by nerve conduction studies.
The most serious complication of loss of sensation in the feet is the neuro-
pathic foot ulcer. A person with normal nerve function feels pain when 
pressure mounts on an area of the foot. However, a person with diabetic neu-
ropathy doesn’t feel this pressure. A callus forms, and with continued pressure,
the callus softens and liquefies, finally falling off to leave an ulcer. This ulcer
becomes infected. If it isn’t promptly treated, it spreads, and amputation may
be the only way to save the patient. In this situation, loss of blood supply to the
feet isn’t an important contributing factor to the ulceration; in fact, the blood
supply may be good, but an ulcer still develops.
A less common complication in distal polyneuropathy is neuroarthropathy, or
Charcot’s joint. In this condition, trauma occurs to the joints of the foot and
ankle without the patient feeling it. The bones in the foot go out of line, and
many painless fractures occur. The patient has redness and painless swelling
of the foot and ankle. The foot becomes unusable and is described as a “bag
of bones.”
Treatment of distal polyneuropathy starts with the best possible glucose con-
trol and extremely good foot care. Your doctor should look at your feet during
each visit, particularly if you have evidence of loss of feeling. Chapter 7 has
more information on checking your feet.
Some drugs, such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen
and sulindac, can reduce the inflammation associated with the unfelt trauma.
Other drugs, such as the antidepressants amitryptiline or imipramine, reduce
the pain and other discomfort that becomes worse as distal polyneuropathy
continues. A drug called capsacin that’s applied to the skin reduces pain as
73
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

well. The results of these treatments are variable and seem to work only 60
percent of the time. However, the longer the pain has been present, and the
worse the pain is, the less likely the drugs are to work.
Other drugs called gabapentin and pregabalin have been found to work more
often than many of the older drugs in treating distal neuropathy, but they cause
sleepiness and dizziness, which may make treatment more complicated. New
drugs continue to be developed, but perhaps because so many factors cause
the neuropathy, no one drug has proven to be successful all the time.
Polyradiculopathy-diabetic amyotrophy
Polyradiculopathy-diabetic amyotrophy is a mixture of pain and loss of muscle
strength in the muscles of the upper leg so that the patient can’t straighten the
knee. Pain extends from the hip to the thigh. This is the second most common
diabetic nerve condition after polyneuropathy. Time may heal the problem; it
usually lasts weeks to months, but it may last years. Tight glucose control
doesn’t seem to have as much of an effect on this condition as it does on
others. Painkillers may help.
Radiculopathy
Sometimes a severe pain along the location of a specific nerve suggests that
the root of the nerve is damaged as it leaves the spinal column. The usual 
clinical picture for this condition known as radiculopathy is pain distributed in
a horizontal line around one side of the chest or abdomen. The pain may be so
severe that it’s mistaken for an internal abdominal emergency. Fortunately, the
pain goes away in 6 to 24 months. In the meantime, good glucose control and
pain management with various painkillers are helpful.
Disorders of movement (mononeuropathy)
Diabetic neuropathy can affect nerves to individual muscles. The result is a
sudden inability to move or use those muscles, called mononeuropathy. These
disorders are believed to originate as a result of a sudden closing of a blood
vessel supplying the nerve. The clinical picture depends on which nerve or
nerves are affected. For example, if one of the nerves to the eyeball is dam-
aged, the patient can’t turn his eye to the side that nerve is on. If a nerve to
the face is affected, the eyelid may droop or the smile on one side of the face
may be flat. The patient with mononeuropathy can have trouble with vision 
or problems with hearing. Focusing the eye may not be possible. There’s no
specific treatment for mononeuropathy, but fortunately the disorder goes
away on its own after several months.
74
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Disorders of automatic 
(autonomic) nerves
Disorders of automatic (or autonomic) nerves often go unrecognized even
though they may have a profound effect on the patient’s quality of life and
even survival.
As you’re reading this page, many movements are going on in your body, but
you’re unaware of them. Your heart muscle is squeezing down and relaxing.
Your diaphragm is rising up to empty the lungs of air and then relaxing to
draw air in. Your esophagus is carrying saliva (or food, if you’re a multitasker
who’s eating and reading) from your mouth to your stomach, and in turn,
your stomach pushes it into the small intestine, which pushes it into the
large intestine.
All these muscle functions are under the control of nerves from the brain,
and diabetic neuropathy can affect them all. The nerves that perform these
functions are called autonomic nerves. As many as 40 percent of people with
T1DM have some form of autonomic neuropathy.
The clinical presentation of this type of neuropathy depends upon the
involved nerve. Some possibilities include:
 Bladder abnormalities starting with a loss of the sensation of bladder
fullness. The urine isn’t eliminated, and urinary tract infections result.
After a while, loss of bladder contraction occurs, and the patient has to
strain to urinate and loses urine by dribbling. The diagnosis is made by
determining how much urine is left in the bladder after urination has
taken place. It’s treated by remembering to urinate every four hours or
by taking a drug to increase the force of bladder contraction.
 Sexual dysfunction, which occurs in as many as 60 percent of males and
30 percent of females with diabetes. Males can’t sustain an erection, and
females have trouble lubricating the vagina for intercourse. The drugs
Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra are helpful for males with sexual dysfunction.
For females, use of lubricating fluids may be helpful.
 Intestinal abnormalities of various kinds. The most common abnormality
is constipation. In 25 percent of patients with autonomic neuropathy,
nerves to the stomach are involved, so the stomach doesn’t empty on
time in a condition called gastroparesis. The precise timing of injected
insulin and food intake (see Chapter 10 for the basics of using insulin) is
thrown off; hypoglycemia occurs as the insulin finds no food, and hyper-
glycemia occurs later as the food finds no insulin (see Chapter 4 for more
about these conditions). Several drugs are helpful in treating intestinal
75
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

abnormalities from autonomic nerve disorders, including metocloprim-
ide and erythromycin. Some changes in eating habits are also helpful,
including lowering fat intake and eating up to six small meals daily.
 Gallbladder involvement leading to gallstones. Normally the gallbladder
empties each time you eat, especially if you eat a fatty meal, because the
substances in the bile (which is in the gallbladder) help to break down fat.
If disease to the nerve to the gallbladder prevents emptying, gallstones
form, often requiring surgical removal of the gallbladder.
 Large intestinal involvement resulting in diabetic diarrhea and up to ten
or more bowel movements per day. Accidental loss of bowel contents
can also occur. Autonomic neuropathy may cause bacteria to grow
abnormally in the intestine. The problem may respond to antibiotics,
and diarrhea is treated with one of several drugs that quiet the large
intestine.
 Heart abnormalities. If loss of nerves to the heart occurs, the heart may
not respond to exercise by speeding up as it should. The pressure from
the heart may not increase as the patient stands and he may become
lightheaded. A very fast fixed heart rate also may occur, and patients
experiencing this are at risk for sudden death. Autonomic neuropathy
can also cause decreased perception of heart pain. Several drugs are
available that may help.
 Sweating problems, especially in the feet. The body may try to compen-
sate for the lack of sweating in the feet by sweating excessively on the
face or trunk. Heavy sweating can occur when certain foods like cheese
are eaten. There’s no particular treatment other than avoidance of foods
that set it off.
 Abnormalities of the pupil of the eye. Neuropathy may prevent the pupil
from opening to let more light in when necessary. Reduced vision in low
light means that the patient has to be much more careful about driving
at night. There’s no treatment other than better glucose control.
This long list can be a bit scary, but none of it need ever happen if you con-
trol your blood glucose.
Macrovascular Complications: 
Protecting Your Heart
Macrovascular complications are the complications involving the large blood
vessels of the body, particularly the coronary arteries in the heart. In this
section, I discuss how diabetes can lead to damage to the heart by causing
blockage of these arteries.
76
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Heart disease and heart attacks are the major macrovascular complications
found in people with T1DM. How does heart disease lead to a heart attack?
Coronary artery disease (CAD), which is also known as atherosclerotic heart
disease, is the progressive closure of the arteries that supply blood to the
heart muscle. (To understand how coronary artery disease develops, see the
later sidebar “Picturing a plaque.”) When one or more of your heart arteries
close completely, the result is a heart attack (or myocardial infarction).
People with diabetes have more CAD than people without diabetes. When X-
ray studies of the blood vessels of the heart are compared, people with dia-
betes have more arteries of the heart involved with CAD than non-diabetics.
The incidence of CAD is increased even in young patients with T1DM. The
duration of diabetes promotes CAD in type 1 patients, and CAD affects males
and females with T1DM to the same extent.
People with diabetes often are unaware of heart pain because of cardiac neu-
ropathy (I explain general neuropathy earlier in this chapter). Assuming that
they don’t have cardiac neuropathy, the symptoms are chest pain, pain down
the left arm, and shortness of breath along with sweating. If a heart attack
occurs, the risk of death is much greater for the person with diabetes. More
than half of all people with diabetes die of heart attacks. Even if a person with
T1DM survives a heart attack, he faces more complications, such as shock
and heart failure, than the person without diabetes, and the outlook is much
worse for him. A second heart attack occurs in 50 percent of diabetics com-
pared with 25 percent of non-diabetics, and the death rate in five years is 80
percent compared with 25 percent for non-diabetics.
CAD is found in the arteries of people with T1DM who die of other causes 
as young as age 20 or even younger, and it’s extensive in older people with
T1DM who die of other causes. However, it’s not found in everyone. Those
folks with T1DM who don’t have other risk factors, such as uncontrolled high
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and high cholesterol
levels, rarely have problems with coronary artery disease. A family history 
of coronary artery disease is another risk factor and one that you can do
nothing about, but its effect is minimized when the other risk factors are
avoided or controlled.
The picture is not a pretty one for the person with diabetes who has coronary
artery disease. The treatment options are the same as for non-diabetics.
 Therapy to dissolve the blood clot obstructing the coronary artery (called
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or PTCA) can be used, but
people with diabetes don’t do as well with this form of treatment as non-
diabetics because they may have many separate lesions in the artery.
PTCA also can’t be performed when an artery is completely closed.
 The other option is the use of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), in
which a blood vessel is attached above and below the obstructed artery,
thereby bypassing the obstruction. The long-term prognosis for keeping
77
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

the graft open isn’t as good in people with diabetes as in non-diabetics
because the diabetes leads to increased promotion of atherosclerosis.
The complications of CABG include an acute heart attack, stroke, infec-
tion in the area of the body that undergoes surgery, and even death on
the operating table. The risk of complications is especially serious in
older patients (more than 70 years old) and those patients with other
diseases, such as kidney disease.
Although there’s no data yet in T1DM, studies have shown that lowering the
LDL cholesterol and raising the HDL cholesterol (see Chapter 7) will prevent
first heart attacks and decrease the occurrence of second heart attacks in the
general population. Hopefully, data will soon be available that will allow a 
recommendation for treatment of blood fats in T1DM.

Dummies by James M. Rippe, MD (Wiley).
Considering Associated Diseases
Because T1DM is an autoimmune disease (a disease caused by the body 
inappropriately attacking itself), there’s a greater tendency to develop 
other autoimmune diseases like celiac disease and hyperthyroidism. Non-
autoimmune diseases also occur frequently in T1DM patients, however. The
most important of these long-term complications are hyperthyroidism,
hypothyroidism, skin disease, and celiac disease.
Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism
Thyroid disorders based on autoimmunity such as hyperthyroidism (an over-
active thyroid) and hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) occur more fre-
quently in people with T1DM. Both conditions are the result of autoimmune
thyroiditis, which is usually missed because it causes no symptoms most of
the time. In a study of 58 people enrolled in the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trials published in Diabetes Care in April 2003, 18 patients had
hypothyroidism and one had hyperthyroidism.
When symptoms are present, they alter metabolism. Hyperthyroidism and
hypothyroidism affect diabetic control, and it’s important to diagnose them
by doing thyroid blood tests. Treatment for hypothyroidism is replacement
of thyroid hormone. Treatment of hyperthyroidism is with antithyroid drugs,
radioactive iodine, or surgery. The symptoms of the more common hypothy-
roidism are weight gain, slowness, dry skin, brittle nails, tiredness, and intol-
erance to cold. With hyperthyroidism, you get weight loss, palpitations, high
body temperature, nervousness, and trouble sleeping.

Picturing a plaque
When diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking,
and/or increased levels of cholesterol (especially
low-density lipoprotein, or LDL cholesterol) damage
the inner lining of the arteries, a plaque begins to
form. The following figure shows the parts of a
normal artery and the artery after a plaque has
developed.
After damage has occurred, fat begins to accu-
mulate within a part of the artery wall called 
the intima. In the intima, fat is protected from the
chemicals in the blood that prevent changes in 
the fat because they can’t reach the fat, and fat
begins to take a more damaging form.
White blood cells, especially monocytes and lym-
phocytes that enter the intima from the blood, are
transformed into other cells called macrophages,
and the macrophages begin gobbling up the
changed fat to turn the cells into foam cells. Calcium
also is deposited in the walls where the plaque is
forming and is responsible for the calcification seen
in X-rayed arteries.
The accumulation of foam cells and calcium is
called plaque. It grows and begins to stick out into
the lumen,the hollow part inside of the artery. After
80 percent of the lumen is blocked, blood flow to the
heart muscle is reduced.
The irregular surface of a plaque can be the site of
accumulation of blood platelets and the formation
of a clot. The clot can go on and reduce the open-
ing of the lumen even more, or it can break off and
lodge in a smaller artery, completely closing off
blood flow beyond it.

All people with T1DM should have routine thyroid function testing with a blood
test that checks the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone on an annual basis.
See my book Thyroid For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), for general information
about hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
Skin disease
Many skin conditions are unique to the person with diabetes because of the
treatment and complications of the disease. The most common and important
skin complications include the following:
 Bruises occur because insulin needles cut blood vessels.
 Vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation) is part of the autoimmune aspect of
type 1 diabetes and can’t be prevented.
 Necrobiosis lipoidica, which also affects people without diabetes, creates
patches of reddish-brown skin on the shins or ankles, and the skin
becomes thin and can ulcerate. Females tend to have this condition more
often than males. Steroid injections are used to treat this condition, and
the areas eventually become depressed and brown.
 Xanthelasma, which are small, yellow, flat areas called plaques on the
eyelids, occur even when cholesterol isn’t elevated. Treatment may not
be necessary.
 Alopecia, or loss of hair, occurs in people with type 1 diabetes, but the
cause is unknown.
 Insulin hypertrophy is the accumulation of fatty tissue where insulin is
injected. This condition is prevented by changing the injection site (see
Chapter 10 for more information on insulin injection).
 Insulin lipoatrophy is the loss of fat where the insulin is injected.
Although the cause is unknown, this condition is rarely seen now that
human insulin has replaced beef and pork insulin in diabetes treatment
(see Chapter 10).
 Dry skin is a consequence of diabetic neuropathy, which leads to a lack of
sweating (refer to the earlier section “Disorders of automatic (autonomic)
nerves” for more on sweating). Treatment is with skin lubricants.
 Fungal infections occur under the nails or between the toes. Fungus likes
moisture and elevated glucose, so lowering glucose and keeping the toes
dry prevents these infections. Medications may cure this problem, but it
recurs if glucose and moisture aren’t managed.
 Diabetic thick skin, which is thicker than normal skin, occurs in people
who have had diabetes for more than ten years. No treatment exists for
this condition.

Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Celiac disease
Celiac disease is an inherited autoimmune disease present in as many as 2 to 3
percent of patients with T1DM. A person who has celiac disease, also known as
celiac sprue, can’t eat foods that contain gluten, including wheat, barley, and
rye, because gluten damages the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with
celiac disease (both adults and children) complain about these symptoms:
 Failure to gain weight
 Failure to thrive (a failure to grow and develop normally)
 Unexplained diarrhea
 Weight loss
Clearly, these kinds of symptoms make control of diabetes much more difficult
because there’s no dependable absorption of food. Hypoglycemia (which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 4) occurs much more often in patients suffering from T1DM
and celiac disease, and it’s difficult for them to choose a correct insulin dose.
A positive blood test for gastric parietal cell autoantibodies rules in the diagno-
sis of celiac disease. Confirmation comes from direct viewing of the stomach by
gastroscopy.
When this diagnosis is made, it’s time to consult with a dietitian, who can
help identify safe foods. Foods that are safe for the type 1 patient with celiac
disease include:
 Cereals made without wheat or barley malt
 Dairy products
 Fruits and vegetables
 Meat
 Potatoes, rice, corn, and beans
 Foods specially made with alternative grains and starches, like from rice,
potato, and cornflower
All items made with flour, whether all-purpose, white, or wheat, are strictly
prohibited in a gluten-free diet. For more on this topic, check out Living
Gluten-Free For Dummies, by Danna Korn (Wiley).

D
iscovering that your little girl or little boy has a chronic disease called
type 1 diabetes (or T1DM) that you know little about but have heard
can cause premature death can be devastating, to say the least. I hope that in
the course of reading this book you realize that much of what you’ve heard is
myth. With the tools that are currently available, your child should be able to
live a long, quality life, though it’s true that he’ll spend a lot of time doing
things that his friends without diabetes won’t have to do. On the other hand,
the attention that your child will devote to taking care of himself will proba-
bly prolong his life beyond that of someone who isn’t careful about eating,
drinking, smoking, and exercise.
This chapter is about the emotional consequences of type 1 diabetes. 
They’re not limited to the person with the disease but rather affect every
family member. Having to deal with diabetes is a huge burden on a growing
child, but the experience of numerous patients in the past shows that this
burden is manageable.
Coming to Terms with the Diagnosis
When your child is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, he may experience a wide
range of emotions, such as shock, sadness, anger, and denial. Having these
initial emotions is perfectly normal, but your child needs to accept the diag-
nosis eventually in order to take charge of his treatment and start living a
healthy life. You can use the information in the following sections to show
your child that he’s not alone in dealing with type 1 diabetes and to help him
develop positive coping skills.

Knowing that your child 
is in good company
So many people have T1DM that there are bound to be some really outstanding
scholars, athletes, politicians, and leaders in all walks of life in the mix. They
prove that there’s no limit to what your child can do in his life with T1DM. In
particular, they prove that T1DM doesn’t make you uglier, dumber, slower, 
or weaker.
Your child is a person with T1DM. How he lets that fact affect his life will
determine the shape of his life, not the diabetes. The people I describe in the
following sections are able to live their lives to the fullest regardless of their
diabetes. And your child can, too. Right now, your child can’t be cured of
T1DM, but he doesn’t have to let it get in the way of whatever he wants to be
and do.
World-class athletes
In 2007, a cycling team of 11 men with T1DM called Team Type 1 bicycled 3,043
miles across America in five days. This feat would have been impressive had it
been accomplished by a group of completely well people; what makes it excep-
tional is that these cyclists had to test their blood glucose, give themselves
continuous insulin with pumps, and make sure that their nutrition kept them fit
for the many miles of biking each day. These men and the other athletes in this
section show that your child can do anything even though he has T1DM.
Each of the people I describe in this section is at the top of his or her game,
despite having to deal with T1DM. They represent a number of different
sports, each doing what he or she loves the most:
 Missy Foy is an elite athlete who, in 2000, became the first athlete in 
history with T1DM to qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials. In 2005,
she broke the course record for the 50-mile Ultramarathon and was
number one in the world for a woman at that distance.
 Kris Freeman is the top cross-country skier in the United States. He has
won numerous cross-country championships and was preparing for the
Olympics in 2000 when he developed T1DM. He competed anyway and
remains a member of the US Ski Team.
 Gary Hall, Jr. won two gold medals in Olympic swimming (in 2000 and
2004). He also won silver and bronze medals in other swimming events.
 Jonathan Hayes was a star football player in college and then played
tight end for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. He
played in the NFL for 12 seasons and didn’t miss a single game in his last
six seasons.
84
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

 Chris Jarvis is a world champion Canadian rower who has won gold
medals in several World Cup rowing events. He plans to compete in
rowing at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.
 Adam Morrison, a basketball player who developed T1DM in the eighth
grade, entered the National Basketball Association after three years of
college basketball and now plays for the Charlotte Bobcats of the NBA.
Entertainers and politicians
People with T1DM are unlimited in their physical and mental attributes, as
the following individuals prove. They represent a large number of unique and
successful entertainers and politicians with T1DM.
 Halle Berry is an Academy Award–winning actress who developed
T1DM at age 23. The first African American woman to win an Academy
Award, Berry has several high-profile endorsement deals and is one of
the highest paid actresses in Hollywood.
 Jim Turner developed T1DM in high school and went on to become an
actor, starring in numerous television shows. He’s a strong advocate for
the American Diabetes Association and gives many talks on how to live
with diabetes.
 Nicole Johnson developed T1DM as a sophomore in college and went on
to become the first woman with T1DM to win the Miss America crown (in
1999). She travels the world educating people about diabetes mellitus;
her work has earned her numerous awards including the Koop Medal for
Health Promotion and Awareness and the Victory Over Diabetes Medal of
the Polish Diabetes Association. She also has written several books,
including her autobiography, Living With Diabetes.
 Charles (Buddy) Roemer developed T1DM as an adult. Thereafter, he held
numerous political offices, including four terms as Louisiana Congressman
followed by one term as Governor of Louisiana.
Encouraging positive coping skills
What are some of the tools that your child can use to thrive with T1DM? They
consist of the coping skills that he may or may not know he possesses. These
are the traits that you want to promote by constantly emphasizing them. Praise
the child when he does the right thing for his diabetes, whether it’s eating
properly, taking the injection correctly, or exercising. Also remember to limit
the criticisms for mistakes.
To your child, you represent the chief “judge” in his life. If you constantly rein-
force the positive qualities that he possesses, that’s how he’ll think of himself.
On the other hand, if you dwell on his negative qualities, he’ll see himself in
that light.
85
Chapter 6: Handling Emotional Effects

Some of the key tools for helping your child deal with T1DM include the 
following:
 Let him be the one in control of his diabetes. As much as your child
would like to have his parents, doctor, or diabetes educator handle
things for him, he’s the one constantly making the important decisions as
to what to eat, how much to exercise, how much insulin to take, how
much to rest, and so forth. (Of course, if your child is too young to make
such decisions on his own, it’s your job as parent or caretaker to step in.)
It’s important that an older child have the knowledge he needs to make
the right decisions. This book is a great start to gaining that knowledge,
but you can also help your child talk to his doctor, diabetes educator,
pharmacist, and other helpful folks to find out the info he needs.
 Focus on his successes. When managing T1DM, you and your child know
that there are times when things go better than other times. Try to figure
out why that happens and use the knowledge to improve his diabetes
management. For example, summer may be approaching and your child
wants to be in good shape for summer sports, so he’s willing to exercise
more. When he increases his exercise level, he may find that he needs
less insulin to get good control of his blood sugar and blood levels. You
and your child can work together to develop an exercise program to
maximize the benefits of exercise regardless of the time of year. (See
Chapter 9 for full details on exercise.)
 Get the family’s help. T1DM is a family disease, which means that a 
supportive family can really improve your child’s control of his diabetes.
For example, if family meals aren’t consistent with your child’s needs,
it’s harder for him to control his blood glucose. If a sibling encourages
him to eat things that he knows are problematic, the sibling isn’t doing
him any favors. And things can be just as difficult if the sabotage is less
direct, like if family members constantly complain about how he man-
ages his diabetes. As the parent, you and your child can work together
to let other family members know exactly the extent to which you want
them to be involved in the diabetes. I say much more about this in the
next section.
 Develop a positive attitude. A little optimism can go a long way. You will
find as you read this book that there’s an enormous amount of work going
on to cure your child’s diabetes. Some of the best brains in the world are
concentrated on doing this. But even before “the cure” is found, your
child should know that he’s blessed by having the best set of tools that
has ever existed to control his blood glucose.
In the decade and a half since researchers studied the benefit of glucose
management in preventing or slowing complications from T1DM (see the
sidebar “The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial” in Chapter 5), the
knowledge of diabetes treatment has expanded with new tools and tests.
Someone may announce the definitive cure tomorrow. In the meantime, a
positive attitude helps your child keep his diabetes in the best possible
control so that he’s ready when the cure is available. Pessimism only
86
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

leads to an “I don’t care” attitude that doesn’t motivate him to do all the
things he needs to do with regard to his T1DM.
 Help your child identify the most difficult issues and figure out how 
to overcome them. Remember that every problem has a solution. For
instance: Does your child have trouble remembering to take his insulin
or do his blood glucose tests? Meters are now available with alarms that
he can set to remind him (see Chapter 7). Because he generally tests just
before he takes his insulin, one alarm may solve both problems.
Is he having trouble figuring the correct insulin dose, perhaps? His
doctor and dietitian can be of help. Learning how much insulin he needs
for the glucose in his blood (see Chapter 10) as well as the carbohydrate
he’s about to eat (see Chapter 8) will solve this problem.
 Don’t expect perfection. Although things need to go right most of the
time, there will be times when they don’t. So many different inputs deter-
mine the result of your child’s blood glucose that even if he eats the
same food, exercises the same amount, and takes the same amount of
insulin each day, his next glucose level may be very different from what
he expects. If this happens consistently, a change may correct the prob-
lem. But if a surprise is a rare event, encourage your child to forget
about it. One or even several bad blood glucoses won’t damage him in
the long run.
Realizing that Type 1 Diabetes 
Is a Family Disease
Both the patient and the patient’s family have to deal with the emotional
impact of T1DM. If the patient is a small child, Mom and Dad may have to
take care of everything for a number of years, and siblings may feel ignored
as all the attention goes to the patient. How the whole family copes with all
the challenges of T1DM may make a huge difference in the future of the
patient. If the gang can keep things in good control until he takes over, he 
has a great start in preventing future complications.
In the following sections, I provide some helpful general tips for parents of
children with T1DM and explain how diabetes care changes at different stages
of a child’s growth. I also help siblings develop an understanding of T1DM.
Getting a grip on general 
guidelines for parents
Parents commonly feel fear when they discover that their child has T1DM. 
The first step in overcoming the fear is to become knowledgeable about the
87
Chapter 6: Handling Emotional Effects

diabetes. You can do that by attending a course on T1DM available in most
local hospitals. Also find a diabetes educator and a dietitian with whom you
feel comfortable (see Chapter 2 for tips on finding these folks). When you know
that there are ways to prevent the complications of T1DM (covered in Chapters
4 and 5) and a broad range of treatments should the complications occur, you’ll
feel much more able to handle the challenges that come your way.
As a parent, you can do a number of things to ease yourself through the 
experience of having a child with diabetes.
 Try to maintain a balance between good diabetes care of your child
and overbearing control. If you try to control every blood glucose
result in an attempt to achieve perfection, you’ll rapidly find that your
child rebels. He’ll refuse his insulin, eat foods that aren’t appropriate,
and refuse to exercise.
 Understand that anger is a natural response to the limitations that a
child feels when he has diabetes. Discover the source of his anger by
asking questions like “What makes you angriest about having diabetes?”
and try to find a compromise that addresses his anger without sacrific-
ing diabetic control. Sometimes it’s even okay to sacrifice control for a
short while in order to gain the child’s support. For example, allowing
him a small piece of cake on his birthday is a small price to pay to 
maintain his cooperation.
 Be aware that neither you nor your child is to blame for the fact that
he has diabetes. T1DM doesn’t result from consuming too much sugar,
failing to exercise sufficiently, or any other failure that you may imagine.
(Turn to Chapter 2 to find out how T1DM actually develops.)
 Don’t overreact to a temporary loss of control over your child’s glucose
level. Control of the blood glucose may be lost temporarily when your
child gets sick with a virus or encounters one of many other problems.
When it happens, move on and try to restore the control as soon as possi-
ble without being judgmental and implying that the child was bad or did
the wrong thing. A child who’s really trying but gets blamed when things
go wrong will quickly lose interest in trying.
 Recognize that depression can occur in patients with diabetes. If your
child’s sleep is disturbed, if he doesn’t want to eat, if his usual positive
outlook changes to sadness and unhappiness, it may be the time to talk
to his doctor about getting help. Maintaining good diabetic control in
the face of depression is very difficult. Even if the child isn’t depressed,
a visit to a psychologist may be a valuable baseline to establish in case
things go wrong later on; you can obtain a referral for a psychologist
from your diabetes specialist.
 Know when to begin turning over control of the day-to-day manage-
ment of diabetes to the child. Previously it was thought that this should
be done as early as possible. Now, doctors and other people in the know
feel that the child shouldn’t have control of daily diabetes management
88
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

until he clearly understands how his lifestyle, eating, exercise, rest,
insulin, emotional state, and more affect his diabetes. For example, when
the child knows how a level of blood sugar combined with the amount of
carbohydrate about to be eaten and with the kind and amount of insulin
previously taken all play a role in the next insulin shot — and he can cal-
culate the amount correctly — he’s ready to assume more responsibility.
When a child gets more involved in his T1DM control, he and his parents
need to work out who’s responsible for what part of diabetes management
so that poor diabetic control doesn’t result from confusion. The age at
which you hand over some control is entirely dependent on your child
and what he’s ready for.
 Make it clear that the limitations on food, exercise, and so forth are
associated with living, not necessarily diabetes. Whether diabetes is
present or not, you don’t want your child to be obese, and you do want
your child to be physically fit. By framing responsibilities as part of a
healthy lifestyle rather than a diabetes lifestyle, your child will be much
more receptive to eating right and keeping fit just like his siblings and
friends who don’t have diabetes. If he associates every limitation in his
life with diabetes, he’ll hate his disease and either ignore it or not do the
things that are critical to good diabetes control.
 Make sure that your children without diabetes know about the disease.
This is a great opportunity to find out what the “patient” knows by having
him explain his disease to his siblings. (You can correct any mistakes.)
Caring for children of all ages
Your growing child will have different reactions to diabetes at different ages.
Young children passively but not happily accept the insulin shots, whereas
young adults want to take charge of their condition. The following sections
describe what you can expect from children with T1DM at different ages.
Infants up to 18 months
Missing the initial diagnosis of T1DM in an infant up to 18 months of age is
easy to do because the child can’t tell you what’s wrong. You may not notice
that diapers have to be changed more often because of excessive urination,
and the baby’s nausea and vomiting may be ascribed to a stomach problem.
Call your doctor immediately to get a diagnosis if you suspect that your baby
has T1DM; Chapter 2 has more information on typical symptoms.
The infant up to 18 months of age with T1DM is completely under the care of
his parent (usually the mother). He’ll resist his shots and his glucose tests
but must clearly understand that they’re essential. This is something you
have to insist upon even though the child can’t understand the reason.
89
Chapter 6: Handling Emotional Effects

It’s better for the baby’s neurological system to allow his blood glucose to be a
little higher. A blood glucose between 150 and 200 mg/dl (8.3 to 11.1 mmol/L)
is a good target to shoot for. Chapter 7 has full details on measuring and 
monitoring blood glucose.
Toddlers between 18 months and 3 years
The toddler who is 18 months to 3 years old is at the stage of beginning to 
test his parents, establishing himself as a separate human being. He’s starting
to learn to control his environment (by toilet training, for example). With dia-
betes, he may refuse shots, refuse to eat enough and at the right time, and gen-
erally make it difficult for you to manage the disease. You have to set limits and
be firm, know when to insist when the item is essential (like taking insulin) and
when to give in so that the child can have some victories as well (like allowing
the child a piece of birthday cake).
Use of very short-acting insulin like lispro (see Chapter 10) is very helpful in
toddlers because the child’s eating habits tend to be irregular and you can
give the insulin just as the child begins to eat.
Children between 3 and 6 years
The child between ages 3 and 6 is still home and tests your limitations even
more than a toddler. But at last he can tell you when he has symptoms of
hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4). At this age, the child is wondering what he did
to deserve diabetes when all his friends don’t have it. Get the child involved
with food preparation so that he feels he plays a part in his care.
As your child gets closer to 6 years old, think about enrolling him in a dia-
betes camp or a children’s diabetes group. There he’ll be surrounded by kids
like him and will realize that everyone has similar concerns and limitations. It
turns out that diabetes isn’t a punishment after all but something to be man-
aged. (For information on camps for children with T1DM go to the Web site 
of the American Diabetes Association at www.diabetes.org/community
programs-and-localevents/diabetescamps.jsp.)
Don’t try to teach your young child about the complications of diabetes yet.
He doesn’t possess the skills or knowledge to manage his disease and will
simply be frightened.
Children between 6 and 12 years
As the child begins school between 6 and 12 years of age, he wants to know
more. This is the time for you and the child to go to a diabetes education 
program and to sit down together with a dietitian to work out the best diet to
promote continued growth and good diabetic control. It’s also the time to
hand over some of the control (don’t give up control of the insulin just yet),
especially because you’re not at school to monitor the child all the time.
Establish that the school has food that’s healthy for your child and also has a
90
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

program where knowledgeable people are available to help him in the event
of hypoglycemia. This is mandated by law. Your child should have access to
immediate sources of glucose and permission to take them if necessary as
well as the right to go to the bathroom when required. You also want to be
sure that one parent is always available and reachable in case of an emer-
gency. (Check out Chapter 14 for more information about adjusting to school
with type 1 diabetes.)
Diabetes camp is a valuable place for your child to go at this age because he
can make friends with other children with diabetes and also can learn more
about his condition. In addition, nutrition is especially important as the child
is growing rapidly (see Chapter 8). Snacks between meals will smooth out the
glucose control.
Teens between 13 and 15 years
When the child reaches age 13 to 15 and officially becomes a teenager, he’s
extremely curious and wants to know about everything, including his dia-
betes. Another trip together to a diabetes education program and the dietit-
ian isn’t overdoing it at all. He’s probably forgotten a lot of information since
his last visit, and there’s usually some new and hopeful information that you
can both learn from the program. At this age, involving both parents in dia-
betes education and treatment is even better than just one parent.
It’s time to give up more and more control while still overseeing the way your
child is managing his diabetes. Continuing attendance at diabetes camp con-
firms that he’s doing the right things and reinforces the notion that diabetes
can be associated with fun.
This and the following stage may be a very difficult time in terms of trying to
keep good glucose control because of the production of large amounts of
growth hormone, which tends to raise blood glucose. Don’t expect perfection,
and make sure your child doesn’t either! Maintaining reasonable good diabetic
control, allowing the average blood glucose to be a little higher (to avoid
hypoglycemia), and knowing that after your child grows out of the teen years
he can achieve tighter control will get you through these stages with your
sanity intact.
Teens between 15 and 19
The stage of puberty, from age 15 to 19, with all the new and powerful hor-
mones (especially the sex hormones) may prove to be the most difficult time
of all to manage T1DM. All the problems of attraction to and being attractive
for a significant other seem to get in the way. Who wants his girlfriend to know
that he has a chronic disease? Your child also has a lot of buddies of the same
sex that he wants to impress. Telling them he can’t eat this or that or that he
has to take a shot several times a day or must leave for a regular doctor’s
appointment hardly makes a good impression.
91
Chapter 6: Handling Emotional Effects

In this age range, teenagers want to see the doctor on their own. They want
to know that their diabetes won’t prevent them from doing whatever they
want in life. Teenagers also need their friends to know about diabetes and to
help them when needed. This may be difficult for the teenager who really
doesn’t want anyone to know about his disease, but it’s essential.
This is the stage when girls, especially, are highly conscious of their weight
and may skip insulin shots in order to lose weight. Skipping insulin will show
up in the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7). If this level starts to rise as the
child is losing weight, you need to step in to deal with the problem; see
Chapter 8 for details.
Despite the difficulty of achieving excellent glucose control, this also is the
point at which you really need to emphasize the importance of tight blood glu-
cose control for two reasons: Tight control beginning now will help to prevent
diabetic complications later on; and your young adult is preparing to go off to
college, where you’ll have little or no control over what happens. If he has
developed good habits of eating, insulin administration, and so forth, these
habits are likely to continue when he’s on his own.
Be sure to discuss alcohol use and sexual activity before your teenager leaves
the nest. Make sure he understands that overdoing it with alcohol provides
many empty calories and can lead to hypoglycemia (see Chapter 12). In addi-
tion, be certain that your daughter is aware of the danger of pregnancy when
diabetes isn’t well-controlled (see Chapter 16) and that children of either sex
are aware of sexually transmitted diseases. You may not be comfortable talking
about these subjects with your child, but think how you’ll feel if they suffer the
consequences of ignorance.
Helping siblings be understanding
Being the brother or sister of someone with T1DM is a tough assignment. 
On the one hand, your other children envy all the time and attention that
your child with diabetes gets from you (the parent). On the other hand, they
may be fearful of getting it themselves. They also may witness a severe hypo-
glycemic episode, which can be very scary. It’s a good idea to educate your
other children so that they know something about diabetes, especially how
to manage hypoglycemia. You can certainly take non-diabetic children to 
diabetes education sessions.
It’s important that all your children share things as kids together, playing
together, going to movies together, and so forth. Their relationship should be
based on the fact that they’re members of the same family, not a sibling and a
child with diabetes. The sibling with T1DM is first of all a person, and the fact
that your children share the same parents creates a special bond that lasts a
lifetime.

Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Handling Issues of Self-Esteem
Children with T1DM face many issues of self-esteem, even after they’ve been
treating their T1DM for a while. Among the reasons are
 The feeling that you must be a bad person or have done something
wrong to have been stuck with such a bad disease
 The idea that diabetes makes you less handsome or pretty than your
friends
 The notion that you’re mentally inferior, particularly when you’ve had
hypoglycemia and think that it has damaged your brain
 The fear that you may someday give this disease to your child
 The fear of the complications of T1DM that will make you less of a
human being
 The fact that you must constantly plan when to eat, what to eat, when to
take your medication, when to test, and so forth unlike your friends
without diabetes
 The reliance that you have on others, including parents and doctors
These are realistic fears, although most of them are based upon myth and not
fact. I address them in the following sections.
Busting myths about having 
a chronic disease
Neither you nor your child or anyone else is to blame for your child’s diabetes.
As I explain in Chapter 2, T1DM occurs in a susceptible individual who comes
in contact with a virus that shares tissue similarities with the person’s beta
cells. As your child’s body attempts to reject the virus, it destroys his beta
cells, the ones that make insulin. As a parent, you’re not responsible if your
child gets diabetes; you certainly had nothing to do with that villainous virus.
Help your child remember that he’s first a person and then a person with dia-
betes. As a person, a nice haircut, nice clothes, and so forth make him indis-
tinguishable from any other good-looking person. There is no big D printed
on his forehead.
It’s also true that your child is just as intelligent as any other person with or
without diabetes. Although there’s some suggestive evidence that severe
hypoglycemic reactions under the age of 3 may decrease a child’s intelligence
quotient (IQ), hypoglycemia after that has been shown to have no harmful
long-term effect on the mind.
93
Chapter 6: Handling Emotional Effects

Clearing up fears about 
having special needs
Managing your child’s diabetes requires many products, including the 
following:
 He uses needles, syringes, and insulin (see Chapter 10).
 He has a glucose meter and test strips to test his blood glucose (see
Chapter 7).
 He may have an insulin pump (see Chapter 11) to slowly administer
insulin over 24 hours and a continuous glucose monitor to take glucose
levels at five-minute intervals throughout the day.
He also needs a variety of people to help him, including:
 A diabetes doctor for overall health
 A dietitian to help choose the right foods
 An eye doctor to check his vision regularly
 A diabetes educator to teach him about diabetes
 A psychologist or social worker to get him through the stressful occasions
that accompany any chronic disease
 A pharmacist for the right medication
 Family and friends to give support all the time
Type 1 diabetes certainly puts strains on your child that a person without
diabetes doesn’t have, especially when it comes to planning meals, taking
medications, and monitoring blood glucose. But as I point out in the earlier
section “Knowing that your child is in good company,” it also molds charac-
ter. If your child can overcome the limitations of T1DM, he can overcome
many other of the challenges that he’ll face in his lifetime. Like Frank Sinatra
said, if you can make it there, you’ll make it anywhere.
While it’s true that your child with T1DM has a lot more special needs than
the average person, he’s a unique individual with a special role to play in the
world. He may become an entertainer bringing joy to many people he’ll never
know, or he may be a writer teaching people about subjects they want to
know more about. He may be an inventor, creating a product that improves
the lives of many other people, or he may be a teacher, helping others to
learn how they can thrive in the world. Sit down with your child and help him
understand that his special needs are the foundation that makes it possible
for him to make his contribution to the world. And remember that at one
time or another, everyone has to draw on society to help them along. In a real
way, everyone is interdependent.
94
Part II: Considering the Consequences of Type 1 Diabetes 

Maintaining a High Quality of Life
Again and again it has been shown that the people with T1DM who feel that
they have the highest quality of life are those who have the best control of
their diabetes. And having control of diabetes means controlling the blood
glucose especially for the young person and later, controlling the blood 
pressure and the blood cholesterol.
The keys to your child maintaining a high quality of life with T1DM are
 Regularly measuring his blood glucose and knowing how to respond 
to highs and low (see Chapter 7).
 Getting all the important examinations at regular intervals (see 
Chapter 7).
 Knowing how to count carbohydrates so that he can estimate insulin
needs (see Chapter 8).
 Enjoying good food that’s also nutritious (see Chapter 8).
 Developing a program of aerobic and anaerobic exercise to keep his
muscles in excellent shape thereby helping to keep his metabolism 
functioning well (see Chapter 9).
 Taking insulin in appropriate amounts and at appropriate times (see
Chapter 10).
 Making sure he gets sufficient rest so that he’s alert and able to respond
to the challenges of T1DM.
 Maintaining a positive attitude as he recognizes that he can control his
diabetes and avoid complications.
 Keeping himself aware of the most current treatments.
 Making full use of all the resources available to him, including tools 
and people.
 Avoiding blaming himself or others when things don’t go exactly 
according to plan. Help him just pick himself up and move on.

f you live in the United States in the 21st century, you’re
blessed with everything you need to become and remain
healthy. This holds true for people diagnosed with type 1
diabetes. Whether it’s equipment for monitoring the dis-
ease or tools for treating the disease, the problem is select-
ing from the abundance available. In this part, I guide you
through the choices involved in treating this disease,
pointing out the best options and how to use them not

Chapter 7
Undergoing Essential Tests and
Monitoring Blood Glucose
In This Chapter
 Doing essential tests at the doctor’s office regularly
 Checking your child’s blood glucose several times daily
 Picking a home blood glucose meter
A
s the parent of a child with diabetes, I have no doubt that you want to use
every available method to keep your child healthy and prolong his life.
Doing the tests in this chapter will make the difference between a long life and
a shorter one. Most of them are designed to discover diabetic complications
early in their development, when you can use all the great tools available to
slow or reverse them. Some tests are part of the doctor’s physical exam each
time your child visits him. Most of the tests should be performed at least annu-
ally, but certain tests must be done quarterly. Others, like self-monitoring of
blood glucose, are done several times a day. Taken together, these tests pro-
vide information that you and your doctor can use to make the adjustments in
your child’s treatment plan necessary to ensure not just a long life but a high
quality one.
Twenty-five years ago, many of the tests I discuss in this chapter didn’t exist.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose, the biggest advance since the isolation of
insulin in 1921, only began to become available in 1980. Unfortunately, people
who developed T1DM before then didn’t have the benefit of these tests and
often developed diabetic complications. This should not happen to your child
(or to you, if you’re the patient). Getting all these tests done may be inconve-
nient and expensive, but it’s worth your time and money. The things you
won’t have to worry about happening to your child if you follow my recom-
mendations carefully include:
 Blindness
 Kidney failure
 Amputations

 Painful nerve disease
 Strokes
I’m reminded of the story of the wonderful violinist Midori, when she per-
formed for the first time with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard
Bernstein. In the middle of the violin concerto, one of her strings suddenly
broke. She put down her violin, walked over to the first violinist, borrowed
his violin, and continued playing. Moments later, a string broke on this violin.
She put that one down, walked over to the second violinist and borrowed his
violin to complete the concerto to one of the biggest ovations ever heard at
Tanglewood, where the concert was taking place. Asked later how she main-
tained her calm under such adversity, she said, “What could I do? My strings
broke and I didn’t want to stop the music.”
If you think of your child’s life as a beautiful song and diabetes as a broken
string, you want to continue and complete the music. In this chapter, you 
find all the keys you need to make that happen.
Doing Key Tests at the Doctor’s Office
Treating your child’s type 1 diabetes (or T1DM for short) means that his doctor
must order many tests, but as a responsible parent, you shouldn’t depend on
the doctor’s memory to make sure the tests are done. After all, he’s a busy
guy with hundreds of patients to worry about. Instead, keep a flow chart for
your child’s tests and fill in the blanks as time goes by. I’ve created such a
chart for you on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. Copy it and use it
to make sure that your child’s tests get done at the appropriate times.
Following are the tests that must be done on a regular basis to evaluate the
status of your child’s diabetes (I go into detail on them in the following 
sections):
 The doctor should download your child’s blood glucose results from the
home glucose meter at every office visit into a computer program that
he can use to adjust treatment. (I discuss home meters later in this
chapter in the section “Selecting a Home Blood Glucose Meter.”)
 You should examine your child’s feet daily; the doctor should examine
your child’s feet at every office visit.
 The doctor should measure the blood pressure at each visit.
 Your child’s height and weight should be measured at each visit.
 The doctor should send your child to the laboratory for a hemoglobin
A1c test every three months. You can also do this test at home and give
the results to the doctor.
100
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 The doctor should do an ankle-brachial index study every five years.
 The doctor should check the thyroid function with a TSH at the beginning
of treatment and every five years thereafter.
 The doctor should order an annual microalbuminuria test to look for early
kidney damage.
 The doctor should send your child to an ophthalmologist or optometrist
for an annual dilated eye examination.
 The doctor should order an annual lipid panel on your child.
If any abnormalities are found in these tests, the frequency of testing is
increased and steps are taken to reverse the abnormalities.
If you want more information on every aspect of proper diabetes care for your
child, go to the Web site of the National Diabetes Education Program at ndep.
nih.gov. There you can find information for parents and children including
standards of care. Another great resource for parents is the Web site Better
Diabetes Care at betterdiabetescare.nih.gov/MAINintroduction.
htm. Although this is a site for professionals, it tells you what your child’s
doctor should be doing for your child to provide the best diabetes care 
possible.
Foot problems
Just like eye problems associated with diabetes, foot problems take more than
ten years to develop and are preventable by good diabetes care. Although
amputations are rare in children, the damage that leads to an amputation can
start at a young age.
Make sure that your child has full sensation in his feet. It’s up to you as the
parent to check the young child if there’s any question of loss of sensation.
Here’s what you must do:
 Examine his feet with your eyes and hands daily. If you notice redness,
swelling, or a cut, be sure to call your doctor.
 Test the heat of water that he’s about to enter for a bath to make sure
that it isn’t burning hot.
 Check his shoes for stones or other objects that he may not feel but that
could cause damage.
 Make sure that he wears foot protection, like good sturdy shoes. (Flip-
flops aren’t a good idea!)
 Keep his feet clean and moisturized.
101
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

The doctor should examine your child’s feet at each visit, although you’ll
probably pick up any abnormality long before he does because you examine
your child daily. Doctors usually have a 10-gram filament as well as a tuning
fork that they use to detect loss of sensation in the feet.
You also want the doctor to do an ankle-brachial index test on your child every
five years. This is done by measuring the systolic blood pressure at the ankle
and in the arm (see the later sidebar “The meaning of blood pressure numbers”
for an explanation of systolic blood pressure). The ankle reading is divided
by the arm reading. A normal result is greater than 0.9, meaning the two read-
ings are very close. A result of 0.4 to 0.8 means that the blood pressure is much
lower in the leg than in the arm, suggesting a blockage somewhere in the leg.
Below 0.4 indicates a severe blockage. If necessary, surgery can be done to
open the artery. If severe obstruction is present, it may be treated by angio-
plasty, a procedure in which a balloon is inserted in the artery to open it up,
or bypass surgery, in which the obstruction is bypassed with a piece of the
patient’s vein or a synthetic tube.
The ankle-brachial index is much worse in older people with T1DM if they’re
smokers, have high cholesterol, or have high blood pressure.
Blood pressure
There’s no question that blood pressure plays a key role in the development
of complications of diabetes. Your child’s blood pressure should be measured
each time he sees the doctor. An increase in the average blood pressure of
children is especially harmful for the child with T1DM. Here are just some of
the reasons for the increase:
 Children are getting fatter.
 Children are more sedentary than before.
 Children with diabetes may have increased sensitivity to salt, which
raises blood pressure.
 Children with diabetes may lack the nighttime fall in blood pressure that
normally occurs in people without diabetes.
In order to tell if your child with T1DM has high blood pressure, you have to
know the normal levels of blood pressure for his age and height. (See the
nearby sidebar “The meaning of blood pressure numbers” for more detailed
explanations of each type of blood pressure.) Table 7-1 shows the highest
normal blood pressure at each age.

To compare your child’s blood pressure with other children his age and height,
go to www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/hbp_ped.pdf.
This takes you to The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Scroll
through the document to find Blood Pressure Levels for Boys (Table 3) 
and Girls (Table 4) by Age and Height Percentile. Check the tables to see 
if your child is above the 90th percentile, which is considered too high.
High blood pressure worsens all the complications of diabetes, and control-
ling blood pressure slows or reverses the progression of the complications.
Blood pressure is treated with lifestyle changes like exercise and weight loss
and medications if needed.
You can check your child’s blood pressure (and your own) using one of the
home blood pressure monitors that you can buy in pharmacies. The Panasonic
and Omron models are reliable, accurate, and not very expensive.
For much more information on every aspect of high blood pressure, check
out my book High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Weight and height
A child’s height and weight is such an easy measurement to make, and it tells
so much about whether he’s growing normally that there’s absolutely no
reason for the doctor not to make this measurement at every visit. Your child
with T1DM should be compared to the height and weight charts for children
without diabetes of the same age in order to determine if he’s growing nor-
mally and is underweight or overweight.
103
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

If you’re an adult with T1DM, you can use one of the following formulas to
calculate your ideal weight depending upon your sex:
 A woman should weigh 100 pounds for 5 feet of height plus 5 pounds for
every inch over 5 feet. Therefore, a 5-foot, 4-inch woman is ideally 120
pounds. That’s the center of the range. Normal weight may be plus or
minus 10 percent, so this woman is considered normal in weight if she
weighs between 108 and 132 pounds.
 A man should weigh 106 pounds for 5 feet of height plus 6 pounds for
every inch over 5 feet. For example, a 5-foot, 4-inch man should weigh
130 pounds with a normal range of 117 to 143 pounds.
Another way to determine whether an adult with T1DM is the proper weight
is to figure out his body mass index (BMI). This is a very useful measurement
because it takes the height into account in deciding whether the weight is
appropriate. To calculate BMI, follow this formula:
[Weight (lb) ÷ Height (in) ÷ Height (in)] × 703 = BMI (kg/m2)
The final result is interpreted as follows:
 Normal weight for height: BMI from 22 to 24.9
 Overweight for height: BMI from 25 to 29.9
 Obese for height: BMI from 30
104
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 
The meaning of blood pressure numbers
How do you interpret a blood pressure reading?
Suppose you see something like 125/75; it con-
sists of a top reading and a bottom reading.
 The top reading is the systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) — the amount of pressure in
your arteries as the heart pumps. Systole is
the rhythmic contraction of your heart
muscle when it’s expelling blood from your
left ventricle (the large chamber on the left
side of your heart). The aortic valve sits
between that chamber and your aorta, the
large artery that takes blood away from the
heart to the rest of the body. During systole,
the aortic valve is open and blood flows
freely to the rest of your body.
 The bottom reading is the diastolic blood
pressure (DBP). After your heart empties
the blood from the ventricle, the aortic valve
shuts to prevent blood from returning into
the heart from the rest of your body. Your
heart muscle relaxes, and the ventricle
expands as blood fills it up from the left
atrium, which has received it from the
lungs. Within your arteries, the blood pres-
sure rapidly falls until it reaches its lowest
point. The diastolic blood pressure reflects
this lowest point of blood pressure. Before
the pressure falls further, the ventricle con-
tracts again and the blood pressure starts
to rise back up to the systolic level.

Hemoglobin A1c
A single blood glucose measurement is necessary to tell you how much insulin
to give for the next meal and whether the insulin you gave your child previ-
ously was sufficient. However, it doesn’t give you the big picture. Even four
blood glucose measurements a day say little about overall diabetic control
because blood glucose can and does change within minutes; you’re looking 
at four points in time, but the blood glucose may be very different the rest of
the time, especially during the long period of sleep when no measurements
are made at all. The test that gives you the big picture is called the hemoglo-
bin A1c test. It looks at the last three months and gives you an average of all
the ups and downs in blood glucose levels. (To understand how it does this,
see the nearby sidebar, “What the hemoglobin A1c test measures.”)
At the beginning, the hemoglobin A1c tells you just how out-of-control your
child’s glucose was when the disease began. Every three months after that, it
tells you how close he’s coming to a level of control associated with avoiding
the complications of diabetes that I discuss in Chapters 4 and 5.
Targeting certain levels
Figure 7-1 compares the hemoglobin A1c with the whole blood glucose and
the plasma glucose (which is important to know because the plasma glucose
is what you’re measuring multiple times a day, not the hemoglobin A1c).

Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

A hemoglobin A1c of 6 percent, considered normal, corresponds to an aver-
age whole blood glucose of under 120 mg/dl. A good hemoglobin A1c reading
of 7 percent corresponds to an average whole blood glucose of 150 mg/dl. A
reading of 8 percent, corresponding to an average whole blood glucose level
of 180 mg/dl, is considered fair; anything above that figure is considered to
be poor. In terms of plasma glucose, a good hemoglobin A1c of 7 percent cor-
responds to a plasma glucose of 170 mg/dl. A reading of 8 percent means the
plasma glucose is 210 mg/dl.
For very young children, whose brain cells are still developing, it’s advisable
that the hemoglobin A1c be kept a little higher, perhaps up to 8 percent, until
they’ve reached the age of 2. That’s when low blood glucose levels will no
longer damage their brains.
During puberty, as a result of the brain’s increased production of growth hor-
mone, it’s extremely difficult to keep the hemoglobin A1c below 8 percent.
Your teenager is considered to have poor control of his glucose if his hemo-
globin A1c is 9 percent or higher.
The American Diabetes Association recommends that the goal of therapy for
adults and adolescents with diabetes should be a hemoglobin A1c of 7 percent
or less. This was the goal of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
that was associated with a tremendous decrease in microvascular complica-
tions like eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease (see Chapter 5).
However, for long-term prevention of macrovascular complications including
heart attacks and strokes, a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 percent is recommended.
Using test results
When working with people with T1DM, I use the hemoglobin A1c test for
many purposes.
106
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 
What the hemoglobin A1c test measures
Hemoglobin A1c is the largest of three subfrac-
tions of the protein hemoglobin, the carrier of
oxygen in the bloodstream. As hemoglobin is
being formed, it binds to glucose to form glyco-
hemoglobin. Glycohemoglobin ordinarily makes
up 6 percent of the total hemoglobin in the
blood. The glycohemoglobin takes three forms:
hemoglobin A1a, A1b, and A1c. Because hemo-
globin A1c is the largest subfraction of the
three, it’s the easiest to measure. The more glu-
cose there is in the blood, the more glycohemo-
globin will be formed. As it’s formed, hemoglobin
is transferred into red blood cells where it
remains for 60 to 90 days. So by measuring the
hemoglobin A1c in a sample of red blood cells,
you can determine how much glucose was cir-
culating in the blood over the last two to three
months.

 It gives me a first indication of how well or poorly controlled a person’s
T1DM is when I first see her.
 It motivates the patient to try harder when the hemoglobin A1c is higher
than the goal of 7 percent.
The difficulty with achieving a hemoglobin A1c of 7 percent or even 6.5
percent is the occurrence of hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4). The good
news is that the longer the hemoglobin A1c is maintained at a normal
value, the less hypoglycemia seems to be a problem.
 It clarifies the diabetic control when blood glucose measurements are up
and down. A hemoglobin A1c of 7 percent, for example, means that most
of the glucoses are in a satisfactory range, whereas a hemoglobin A1c of
8 percent means that they aren’t. And if the glucoses aren’t in a satisfac-
tory range, the treatment should be revised.
 It permits me to encourage a woman with T1DM who wants to get preg-
nant to go ahead if the value is satisfactory or to tell her to wait if the
level isn’t right.
If a pregnant woman’s hemoglobin A1c is high (over 8 percent for exam-
ple), it mean’s that her blood glucose was high on average at the time of
conception of the baby. As a result, she’s at high risk of delivering a
baby with a congenital malformation. If she isn’t yet pregnant, a mea-
surement of the hemoglobin A1c tells her whether she can become preg-
nant now or should wait until her glucose is under better control. (See
Chapter 16 for details on T1DM during pregnancy.)
Surveying potential issues with the test
One problem with the hemoglobin A1c test is the slowness with which it
changes when major changes are occurring in treatment. Despite marked
improvement in the blood glucose levels, the hemoglobin A1c changes
slowly. Obtaining a hemoglobin A1c more often than every three months 
is of little value in showing improved glucose control.
Another problem with the hemoglobin A1c measurement is the difference in
how the test is performed in different labs. Because each insurance company
mandates it, I send my patients to three different labs to have the test done.
The normal values in one lab aren’t the same as in the other labs. Recently,
the significance of this problem became clear when an insurance company
changed the lab to which I could sent its patients. The change left me unable
to compare the old test results to the new test results because of different
normal values. Fortunately, there’s an ongoing effort to standardize the
method of performing the hemoglobin A1c test; the movement is based on
the method used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, where the
normal level was 6.05 percent or less.
107
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

Testing at home
You can also do the hemoglobin A1c at home every three months. A test called
A1c Now can be performed with a finger stick, similar to a blood glucose 
measurement (see the later section “The Basics of Testing Blood Glucose at
Home”). You mix a large drop of blood with a solution and put it in the testing
device. It takes eight minutes to get the result of the hemoglobin A1c. The test
is accurate, and you can bring the result to your child’s doctor so he can act
on it immediately. The A1c Now test is available without a prescription at
pharmacies.
You can also obtain the materials to collect a drop of your child’s blood and
send it to one of the following testing laboratories. This approach to A1c test-
ing takes a little longer than a home test (a few days rather than eight min-
utes), but you can still get the result to pass along to your child’s doctor.

GlycoMark
In contrast to the traditional hemoglobin A1c test, changes occur rapidly in
the GlycoMark test. Like the hemoglobin A1c, it’s a blood test, but a better
result in the GlycoMark test is a higher value, not a lower one.
108
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

The GlycoMark test takes advantage of the fact that the compound 1,5-
anhydroglucitol (or 1,5 AG) is normally found in healthy people. It’s filtered
by the kidneys and reabsorbed into the blood. However, when a lot of glucose
is present in the urine, reabsorption is blocked, and the level of 1,5 AG in the
blood falls. As glucose is reduced by treatment, blood levels of 1,5 AG rise.
Table 7-2 shows the values for GlycoMark found in people without and with
diabetes.

Large changes in GlycoMark results occur in just two weeks, so you can use
the test to detect early improvement or deterioration in your child’s glucose
control. In addition, the glucose after eating (called postprandial glucose)
seems to have a big effect on the result of the GlycoMark test. Many special-
ists believe that the postprandial glucose has a greater effect on diabetic
complications than glucose at other times. I expect the GlycoMark test to 
find a more prominent role in following diabetes care in years to come.
Thyroid functions
Increased and decreased thyroid function affect metabolism, and diseases
that result in abnormal thyroid function are generally autoimmune, similar 
to T1DM. For these reasons it’s important to verify that thyroid function is
normal in your child with type 1 diabetes.
Too much thyroid hormone leads to insulin resistance, making diabetes worse.
Too little thyroid hormone increases insulin sensitivity, so people with low
thyroid function have reduced levels of blood glucose.
All children born in the United States are tested at birth with a thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test because low thyroid function during
development of the brain may lead to reduced intelligence. The TSH is the
most sensitive test of thyroid function.
109
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

TSH is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. When the thyroid gland
makes the right amount of thyroid hormone, the pituitary produces the right
amount of TSH to keep it working properly. The normal TSH level in the blood
is 0.5 to 2.5 microunits per milliliter (mU/ml).
When the thyroid makes inadequate amounts of thyroid hormone, the pitu-
itary increases its production of TSH to stimulate the thyroid, and values of
10 mU/ml or more aren’t uncommon. On the flip side, when the thyroid makes
too much thyroid hormone, the pituitary turns down its production of TSH,
and values less than 0.5 mU/ml are found.
TSH should be measured when a person develops T1DM. The other test that
should be done is a blood test for thyroid autoantibodies. If the TSH is normal
and antibodies are present, TSH is tested every year. If the TSH is normal and
antibodies are absent, TSH should be retested at least every five years.
Treatment for low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) is with replacement thy-
roid hormone. Treatment for increased thyroid function (hyperthyroidism) is
with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery. See my book Thyroid
For Dummies (Wiley) for much more on this topic.
Microalbuminuria
A microalbuminuria test, a measurement of tiny amounts of protein in a urine
specimen, indicates if T1DM is affecting your child’s kidneys. Finding excessive
levels of microalbumin is a very early and reversible sign of kidney damage due
to diabetes. If the test finds abnormal amounts of microalbumin, there’s
plenty of time and opportunity to do something about this complication (see
Chapter 5). The usual test for albumin, which involves a test stick put into a
urine specimen, is only positive if there are large amounts of protein in the
urine — greater than 300 mg per day. The microalbumin test is positive if the
amount of protein in the urine is greater than 30 mg per day. A finding of small
but abnormal amounts of protein (albumin) indicates the earliest evidence
that diabetes is damaging the kidneys.
This test is first done about five years after your child has a diagnosis of
T1DM. A negative test should be repeated annually. A positive test should be
rechecked at the next appointment because the test can be falsely positive
after strenuous exercise or if the patient is dehydrated. If your child has sev-
eral positive microalbumin tests, the following actions are taken:
 The doctor puts your child on a drug called an ACE inhibitor. The
microalbumin test can become negative after several months of taking
the ACE inhibitor, and it may be possible to stop the drug after a while.
110
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 You take steps to get your child’s blood glucose as normal as possible.
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that normal blood
glucose can reverse early kidney damage. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 help 
you get going on tightening control of your child’s glucose.
 The doctor checks your child’s blood pressure and treats it if it’s not
normal. I discuss blood pressure later in this chapter.
 The doctor checks your child’s blood fats. High cholesterol can damage
the kidneys. I discuss checking cholesterol later in this chapter.
FlexSite Diagnostics, Inc., offers KidneyScreen At Home, a urine-collection kit
that you use to send a sample to a lab to test for microalbuminuria (it costs
$19.95). The lab sends the result to you and your child’s doctor. You can find
more information about this kit at www.flexsite.com. The company’s
other contact information is listed in the earlier section “Testing at home.”
Eye problems
Fortunately, it takes 15 to 20 years of poor diabetic control for your child to
develop eye problems. Unfortunately, that means that he may be only 30
years old when his vision begins to deteriorate. This can be prevented by
keeping his hemoglobin A1c at 7 percent or below as much as possible 
(I discuss hemoglobin A1c earlier in this chapter).
An eye examination must be done annually to check for diabetic eye disease
called retinopathy (see Chapter 5). An ophthalmologist or an optometrist can
perform the exam; as a side note, it has been shown that no other doctor does
as good a job with the exam as these two professionals. Make sure you insist
that your doctor arrange for your child to have this examination annually.
During the exam, your child’s eye is treated with drops to enlarge the pupils
so that the doctor can see most of the back of the eye. He also measures the
pressure in the eye and the appearance of the lens of the eye.
Fortunately, excellent treatments are available for diabetic eye disease, as you
find out in Chapter 5. If it’s discovered early by this examination, blindness is
usually prevented in patients with T1DM.
Cholesterol
You may think that your child doesn’t have to worry about cholesterol and
other fats, but with T1DM, you have to pay attention to elevated cholesterol,
excessive bad cholesterol, and too little good cholesterol; all can be major
problems. In the following sections, I define cholesterol and describe a test
that measures it.
111
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

Breaking down types of fat particles
Cholesterol circulates in the blood in the form of small particles called lipopro-
teins. Because cholesterol (the “lipo” part of “lipoprotein”) doesn’t dissolve in
water, it has to be surrounded by proteins so it can remain suspended in
blood. Otherwise it would separate just like oil separates from water.
Most of the fat your child eats is in a form called triglyceride. For example, the
fat you see surrounding a piece of steak is triglyceride.
The different fats are neatly packaged into four particles in the blood. To treat
high cholesterol properly, you need to know the levels of these different 
particles:
 Chylomicrons, the biggest fat particles, carry the fat from the meal your
child just ate. They don’t remain in the blood and don’t cause arterioscle-
rosis (the hardening of the arteries). They disappear rapidly from the
blood and usually aren’t measured in a lipid panel.
 High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is the particle that carries cholesterol
back to the liver where it’s broken down. HDL is known as “good” cho-
lesterol because it reduces the danger of arteriosclerosis. The size of
HDL particles is between the size of LDL and VLDL particles.
 Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), known as “bad” cholesterol, is the small-
est in size. It’s bad because it’s the particle that carries cholesterol to the
arteries in which it’s deposited, leading to arteriosclerosis.
 Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) particles contain mostly triglyc-
eride as the fat. These are smaller than chylomicrons.
Deciphering lipid panel results
If your doctor wants to know the levels of all the fat particles in your child’s
bloodstream, your child has to fast for 12 hours before undergoing a test
known as a lipid panel, but if he is satisfied with the results of a total choles-
terol and the good cholesterol, no fasting is required before the test. Make
sure that the doctor performs a lipid panel on your child once a year (or
more often if the results aren’t normal). A lipid panel is done with a blood
specimen in which the various types of fat particles are measured.
Table 7-3 lists the current recommendations for everyone for the levels of fats
in terms of the risk for coronary artery disease.
Your child’s risk for coronary artery disease is greater if his HDL cholesterol
is low and LDL is high. The famous Framingham study has shown that if you
measure the total cholesterol and the HDL cholesterol and divide the total by
the HDL, patients who have a ratio of 4.5 or less have a low incidence of heart
attacks. Patients with ratios of greater than 4.5 are at higher risk, and the
higher the ratio, the worse the risk.

A study in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 2004 indicated that
the LDL level is also very important. In the study, a drug called atorvastatin
was used to lower the HDL cholesterol of more than 4,000 men who had just
had heart attacks. Those who received the maximum dose (so their LDL was
reduced to a mean of 62) had a much lower incidence of subsequent heart
attacks, heart pain, and strokes than the group whose LDL was lowered to a
mean of 97; although Table 7-3 says that the risk is lower when the LDL is
below 100, it may be that the best LDL is simply the lowest LDL.
The treatment of abnormal fat levels depends upon the type of fat that’s not
normal. For example, if the patient has too much LDL cholesterol, the statin
group of drugs is used. If the patient doesn’t have enough HDL cholesterol,
niacin is taken and the patient is encouraged to exercise more.
The Basics of Testing Blood 
Glucose at Home
When self-testing of blood glucose was developed around 1980, it was the first
huge advance in T1DM treatment since the isolation of insulin. Previously, glu-
cose testing was done with urine specimens, but this method didn’t produce
accurate or helpful results because glucose generally doesn’t enter the urine
until the blood glucose is over 180 mg/dl. By that standard, a patient with
T1DM may never show glucose in the urine and still suffer complications of
diabetes!
All the thousands of research papers in the medical literature before 1980 that
used urine testing for glucose are of no value and should be burned. (However,
testing the urine for other things, such as ketones and protein, can be of value.
See the earlier section microalbuminuria and the nearby sidebar on ketones for
more information.)
113
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

The new method of testing blood glucose revealed some valuable information.
Following is just a sampling:
 Under what seem like the exact same conditions, the blood glucose may
be very different from time to time. It’s impossible to control many of
the variables involved in testing, like the depth of the insulin injection or
the emotional state of the patient at the time. Little differences in carbo-
hydrate intake, taking fiber with food, and so forth also can make a big
difference in the reading. It isn’t an exact science. Because it isn’t an exact
science, blaming a child for poor blood glucose levels is ridiculous.
 When blood glucose levels could be downloaded to a computer, it was
seen that, for the most part, patients had been reporting them honestly
in their logbooks. You see, many doctors thought that their patients
weren’t recording their results honestly, causing them (the docs) to 
pay less attention to patient logbooks of glucose results.
 The approximate response of blood glucose to exercise and to food can
be gauged.
 It’s possible to see if a child’s blood glucose is going too low (or too high)
in the middle of the night.
In the following sections, I explain how often to test blood glucose and walk
you through the testing process. See the later section “Selecting a Home
Blood Glucose Meter” for details on a variety of meters available.
Deciding on the frequency of testing
The minimum frequency to test your child is before each meal and at bedtime.
You can test his glucose more frequently depending upon the situation. The
minimum testing frequency must be met because you’re constantly using this
information to make adjustments in his insulin dose. No matter how good
you think his control is, he can’t feel the level of the blood glucose without
testing unless he’s hypoglycemic (see Chapter 4). And even then, he knows
the glucose is low but doesn’t know just how low it is.
On numerous occasions, I’ve asked my patients to guess their blood glucose
and then test it. Their guesses are close to the actual number less than 50
percent of the time. That degree of accuracy isn’t good enough for good 
glucose control!
You should occasionally test your child one hour after a meal and in the middle
of the night to see just how high his glucose goes after eating and whether 
it drops too low in the middle of the night. These results guide you and his
doctor to make the changes your child needs. Just be sure not to make more
than one change at a time and to give it a couple of weeks to make a difference.
114
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Blood glucose test results can be useful many other times of day, such as
during intense exercise, during illness, and after eating food with unknown
amounts of carbohydrate.
Performing the test
You get blood for testing glucose, which usually requires no more than a drop,
by sticking your child’s finger with a sharp device called a lancet. Most meters
come with a spring-loaded holder that permits you to penetrate the skin
quickly and usually without much pain.
The SoftClix lancet and the BD Genie lancet are both in the low-pain category.
Let your child try out many different lancets and select the one that causes
him the least pain.
Here are some standard rules for using the lancet:
 The finger being pricked should be clean, but wiping it with alcohol isn’t
necessary.
 Use the side of the finger, where there’s less sensation.
 Change fingers every time.
 Never use your child’s lancet on someone else or use someone else’s
lancet on your child.
Ready to test? Put the strip into the appropriate opening in the meter unless
you’re using a meter that holds the strips and ejects them. Inserting the strip
usually turns on the meter and prepares it for a test. Place a drop of blood
from the lancet on a specific part of a test strip. The result will appear on the
meter screen in 5 to 40 seconds, depending upon the meter. Also, depending
upon the strip, you may have 30 seconds to add more blood if you didn’t have
enough; you can twist a rubber band at the base of the finger if you’re having
trouble getting enough blood for the strip.
Test strips left loose in a tube of strips rapidly become worthless if exposed
to air; just two hours of exposure is enough to ruin them. That’s why I like the
test strips in a drum, like AccuChek Compact Plus strips (see the later section
“Surveying standard blood glucose meters”), that are protected within the
drum until they’re used.
I tell you how to use glucose test results to manage diabetes in the section
“Using a typical data management system” later in this chapter.
In order to interpret your child’s glucose reading, you need to know whether
his meter gives a reading for whole blood or for plasma. The whole blood glu-
cose is 11 percent less than the plasma glucose. Charts that tell you what his
blood glucose should be use plasma glucose levels. Most meters give a
plasma reading, but you should check the instruction booklet to be sure.
115
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

Testing away from the finger
Some glucose meters can perform the test away from the fingers. This gives
the fingers a rest and offers a huge number of other sites for testing, such as
the forearm and the thigh. If you want to test your child away from his finger,
there are a few things to consider:
 Blood glucose changes rapidly right after a meal. There may be a large
difference in glucose results between the finger and another site, as
much as 50 to 100 mg/dl, but the finger is giving the correct result (the
higher one).
 During and after exercise, glucose also changes rapidly, so use the finger
to test.
 After an insulin shot, there may be a large difference between the finger
and an alternate site. Again, the finger is the correct site.
The difference in glucose readings results from the fact that the finger gets
much more blood flow than other sites.
If there’s any question of your child having hypoglycemia, the finger should
be used. It reflects the true blood glucose much more rapidly than other sites
in the body.
Selecting a Home Blood Glucose Meter
All home meters now on the market are accurate enough to measure your
child’s glucose correctly. They’re generally plus or minus 10 percent of the
reading done in a laboratory. For example, a lab reading of 100 mg/dl may be
anywhere from 90 to 110 mg/dl on your child’s meter. This is sufficiently accu-
rate to help you decide on treatment and evaluate the results of treatment.
Meters that measure the blood glucose use one of two methods, both of which
are highly accurate (Figure 7-2 shows a typical meter):
 The first method depends on the production of a color when the glucose
reacts with a chemical in the strip. The meter reads the darkness of the
color to produce a blood glucose reading.
 The second method uses a strip that produces electrons when the 
glucose reacts with the chemical in the strip. The meter measures 
the amount of electrons produced to give a glucose reading.
In the following sections, I give you some factors to consider as you select a
home glucose meter, and I explain how a data management system works. I
also provide details on a wide variety of meters.
116
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Get a new meter for your child every two years at the very least. They’re like
cars in that a new model with new features is available practically every year.
With each new meter, the batteries last longer, and the testing procedure
becomes simpler. With recent meter developments, manufacturers have been
trying to do away with coding the meter each time you use new test strips.
Considering a few factors 
when choosing a meter
Here are some practical tips to consider when purchasing a glucose meter for
your child:
 The meter companies are happy to give away most of their meters. What
they want you to buy are the test strips, which are different for each
meter. Even within one manufacturer the test strips may differ for the
different meters the company makes.
The strips tend to cost about the same for each meter. If you find strips
that cost significantly less per test, you may want to go with them. A
meter should cost no more than $25 to $50, and test strips are about 
$1 per test.
 Make sure that you can download your child’s meter information to a data
management program. (Some doctors have a preference for a particular
meter that can be downloaded to a computer because the glucose results
can be viewed in a way that’s especially useful for that doctor.) Trying to
determine trends in the blood glucose is next to impossible simply by
looking at results in a logbook. The computer can do so much with the
results that your brain can’t, like putting results from different days into
the same time slots or putting entire days into separate slots so you can
Figure 7-2:
A typical
home blood
glucose
meter.
117
Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose

see if your child’s T1DM is managed the same on different days. For exam-
ple, many patients do better Monday through Friday and loosen up on
the weekend. This trend is obvious with a data management program.
(See the next section for more about these programs.)
Don’t buy a meter that doesn’t have a memory for at least 100 test results.
If you test your child four times a day, a 100-result memory allows you up
to 25 days of results, enough to give you and your doctor a good overall
picture of the trend of the glucose.
 If your insurance company will only pay for one particular kind of meter
or strips, you may have to go with that meter. But if you and your doctor
are willing to go through the hassle of contacting the insurance company
and requesting authorization, you still may be able to use the meter of
your choice.
 If you want your child to learn to test himself, make sure that he can use
the meter easily.
Using a typical data management system
You can use a data management system on just about any home blood glucose
meter to plot your child’s blood glucose and determine where changes need
to be made. Figure 7-3 plots the results before changes were made in the treat-
ment, and Figure 7-4 shows the results after those changes. You can see the
difference very clearly. Here are the elements of each figure:
 The Trendgraph at the top of each page shows the individual blood 
glucose values. The horizontal or x-axis represents the days, and the
vertical or y-axis represents the blood glucose values shown by a X.
Underneath the Trendgraph, the program has figured out the MBG, the
mean blood glucose, 159 mg/dl on the before page and 119 mg/dl on the
after page. The program also shows the percentage of readings in three
categories: less than 80 mg/dl (low), 80 to 180 mg/dl (normal), and over
180 mg/dl (high).
Comparing the two graphs, the percentage of normal readings in the after
page is much greater (63.4 percent before, 77.4 percent after), whereas
the percentage of high readings is substantially lower (31.7 percent
before, 6.5 percent after). The thick black line averages out the glucose
values for each day. You can see that it hovers around 150 mg/dl before
and 110 mg/dl after treatment.
 Below the Trendgraph, the Standard Day puts all the blood glucoses
from a specific range of time into the same area of the graph. Night is
midnight to 5:30 a.m., before breakfast is 5:30 to 8:30 a.m., and so forth.
It’s easy to see by the position of the large X (the average for that time
range) that the blood glucose is around 150 mg/dl throughout the day
before treatment and is usually at 100 mg/dl after treatment.
118
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 The Pie Chart graphically shows that the control is much better after
treatment than it before, although there are more low readings (less
than 80 mg/dl) after treatment.
You can also use the data management software to show every permutation
of the blood glucose values. For example, it’s easy to produce a graph that
shows the average blood glucose for each day of the week. From such a
graph, your child’s doctor can see what time of day requires more or less
insulin, more or less food, and more or less exercise to improve control.

Surveying standard blood glucose meters
More than a dozen companies currently manufacture blood glucose meters.
However, in the following sections I discuss the meters of the four major play-
ers in the field. Among them, they have every new feature you may want or
need. The meters generally have warranties longer than you’ll keep the meter.
They also have 24/7 backup by calling a toll-free phone number (and you
won’t be speaking to someone in Zamboanga).

Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

I’m sure that you want to know the name of the meter that I prefer. It’s the
AccuChek Compact Plus meter. The Compact Plus uses whole blood, not
plasma. The features that I like about this meter are the drum with 17 strips
wrapped up until they’re used, the ability to add blood if there isn’t enough
on the strip, and the fact that it’s very fast and accurate. I also like its data
management system, and my patients have been very happy with the help
they get from the company when anything goes wrong.
One limitation of this meter is that you have to put the date and time back
into the meter each time you change the batteries, which is after about 500
tests. Despite the fact that it’s simple to do, many patients forget to do it, and
all the results that don’t have date and time stamps can’t be used by the data
management system.
Abbott Laboratories
Abbott Laboratories has one of the longest warranties in the industry at four
years, but you’ll probably replace your child’s meter long before that anyway.
The batteries are built in, so after 4,000 tests or about three years you need
to send the meter back for new batteries. The manufacturer is likely to give
you a new meter at that point.
 Freestyle Flash: Abbott considers this the smallest meter available in the
industry. It requires very little blood and allows the addition of blood
within 60 seconds if necessary. You can get a 14-day average of readings
on the meter, and the Freestyle Flash works with diabetes management
software (DMS) called the Precision Link Direct Diabetes Data Management
System through a data port and has a result memory of 250 tests. It allows
alternate site testing, away from the fingers, and it has programmable
alarms to prompt you to test. Coding for the test strips is done with the
keys on the meter.
 Freestyle Freedom: This meter is basically identical to the Freestyle
Flash, but the display screen is much larger for people with vision 
trouble.
 Freestyle Lite: This meter uses different tests strips from the other two
Freestyle meters that don’t require coding the meter each time a new
bottle of strips is used. It has a memory for 400 tests. Otherwise, its 
features are like the other Freestyle meters.
 Precision Xtra: This meter requires a code key with each new bottle of
test strips to code the meter. It remembers 450 tests. It’s also able to test
for ketones in the blood with the appropriate test strips. The Precision
Xtra can test at multiple sites, has a rapid test time, and doesn’t start
the test until enough blood is on the strip.

Bayer Healthcare LLC
Bayer Healthcare LLC, which is a branch of Bayer Group, sells the following
two meters in the United States but continues to support several of its old
meters (like the Elite models) with test strips. You can replace the batteries
for these meters at home. The meters are descendants of some of the first
meters available. They both allow testing away from your fingers and don’t
require coding each time you use new strips. These meters use GLUCOFACTS
Diabetes Management Software for data management.
 Breeze 2: The Breeze 2 uses a ten-test cartridge that calibrates the
meter and requires no coding. It remembers 420 tests. It can provide 
1-, 7-, 14-, and 30-day averages. It was the first meter to receive the 
“Ease of Use” commendation from the Arthritis Foundation.
 Contour: This meter uses individual test strips that require no coding.
Tests may be done at sites away from the finger. It can remember up to
480 tests.
LifeScan
Johnson & Johnson owns LifeScan, which is one of the older meter companies.
The company makes good, reliable meters that compete with one another.
You can replace the batteries in LifeScan meters at home, and all the meters
are coded with keys on the meter itself. LifeScan meters use One Touch
Diabetes Management Software.
 One Touch Ultra 2: This system uses a tiny sample and therefore can
work with LifeScan’s ultrafine lancets, which are included with the blood
glucose meters and can be ordered when needed. The blood is drawn up
by capillary action, and the result is displayed in five seconds. This meter
allows testing away from the fingers. It has a 500-test memory that allows
averaging on the screen and connects to a data port. You can get averages
for 7, 14, and 30 days.
 One Touch UltraSmart: This meter is like the One Touch Ultra 2 with the
addition of other features, including 60- and 90-day averages. You can
enter information about your child’s exercise, health, medication, and
food. The meter prompts you to comment on out-of-range results. You
can view charts and graphs that help to analyze your child’s blood glu-
cose on the meter’s screen. The meter remembers 3,000 tests.
 One Touch Ultra Mini: This meter is very small and portable, and the
company promotes it for travel. It uses a tiny sample of blood and
remembers 50 tests, but it doesn’t permit downloading results or data
management. For this reason, I can’t recommend it.
Roche Diagnostics
Roche Diagnostics sells the meters of Boehringer Mannheim. The batteries in
these meters are replaceable at home, and the meters may be used away from
the fingers. All the meters come with Spanish language instruction and a
122
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

phone number for a Spanish-speaking representative. Roche promotes this
feature, but all the major manufacturers offer it.
 Accu-Chek Aviva: This meter works with diabetes management software
(DMS). It has a very large memory, storing up to 500 blood glucose values,
and can also record other information such as insulin dosages and car-
bohydrate intake. It requires a tiny sample of blood and can produce 
on-screen graphs and statistics. It has a code key with each new bottle
of test strips.
 Accu-Chek Advantage: This meter also works with DMS and stores 350
blood glucose values. It uses a test strip that takes 27 seconds to produce
results but doesn’t require cleaning or wiping. This meter requires a
snap-in code key.
 Accu-Chek Compact Plus: This meter uses a 17-test drum that requires
no test strip handling or calibration. It has a lancing device attached to
it, which can be removed for separate use. The results are displayed in
five seconds, and it has a 350-test memory that’s downloadable to a DMS.
It allows testing away from the fingers. You can see a 7-, 14-, and 30-day
average on the screen.
 Accu-Chek Active: This meter uses a tiny sample of blood and gives a
result in five seconds. It can be used at alternate sites besides the fin-
gers. It has a 200-value memory that’s downloadable to a DMS, and it
needs a snap-in code key.
 Accu-Chek Voicemate: This meter is designed for the visually impaired.
A new version of this meter is being prepared as of this writing; the main
difference is that it reports the blood glucose result audibly. Otherwise,
it’s similar to the other meters in this list.

Chapter 7: Undergoing Essential Tests and Monitoring Blood Glucose
Ketones: Testing at home
The breakdown of fat produces ketones (a type
of chemical compound), which can be mea-
sured easily by putting a ketone strip into a tube
of urine. If your child’s blood glucose is above
250 mg/dl, or if you have diabetes and are preg-
nant and your blood glucose is below 60 mg/dl,
it’s time to test for ketones. The test is usually
done at home.
To perform the test, you place a ketone strip into
urine and observe the purple color. Comparing it
to a color chart tells you whether your child’s
ketones are negative, low, medium, or high. A
finding of high ketones with high blood glucose
means that your child (or you) may be on the
way to ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4). A finding
of high ketones with low blood glucose means
that your child (or you) isn’t getting enough car-
bohydrates. and his body is turning to fat for
energy. (This happens during a pregnancy
because of the demands of the growing fetus.)
If you find that your child has high ketones, high
blood glucose (over 250 mg/dl), and can’t keep
liquids down, it’s definitely time to call the doctor.
If you find high ketones with a low blood glucose,
it’s time to feed your child more carbohydrates.

Roche’s Data Management System is called AccuChek Compass. You need the
right hardware and software to download the glucose values, but you can get
it from the company.
Checking out meters for continuous 
glucose monitoring
Continuous glucose meters obtain glucose readings from a needle placed
under the skin into the interstitial fluid (the fluid that bathes the tissues). 
You can see a typical continuous monitoring meter in Figure 7-5. The needle
is usually changed every three days. The meter still has to be calibrated with
finger-stick blood glucose tests several times a day. The results of a continu-
ous glucose meter can lag behind changes in the blood glucose, especially
when the blood glucose falls rapidly. The interstitial glucose may not fall to
the same extent for 30 minutes. The GlucoWatch G2 Biographer that I
describe later doesn’t use a needle under the skin.
Several companies are making this product, and with improvements, it may
replace individual blood glucose monitoring because it provides so much
more information. When continuous meters no longer require calibration by
finger-stick testing, one insertion of the needle will replace 12 finger-sticks for
patients with T1DM.
The main advantage of these meters is the huge amount of data they 
provide — blood glucose values every five minutes throughout the day 
compared with four readings in 24 hours for traditional meters. The main 
disadvantages are that they still need calibration by doing a finger stick
blood glucose several times a day, and they tend to lag behind the blood

124
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

glucose when conditions are changing rapidly, such as after exercise and after
eating. Also, the huge amount of information that these devices provide can
only be understood with the data management software provided for each one.
Continuous meters are being used for children and in patients in whom the
traditional four glucose readings daily don’t correlate with the hemoglobin
A1c test.
By knowing the direction of the blood glucose over 24 hours (see Figure 7-6
for an example), the doctor can adjust the rapid-acting and long-acting insulins
or the insulin pump to provide tight control of the blood glucose without
causing hypoglycemia.
Dexcom STS Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor
This unit has a small sensor that transmits glucose values wirelessly to the
STS receiver. The receiver displays glucose readings averaged over five min-
utes as well as one-, three-, and nine-hour trends. It alerts you to high or low
levels. It has to be calibrated with LifeScan’s One Touch Ultra 2 blood glucose
meter, and it must be recalibrated with a finger-stick glucose test at least
every 12 hours.
The meter is meant to detect trends and track patterns in adults 18 or older.
It hasn’t been tested in children, adolescents, or pregnant women.

GlucoWatch G2 Biographer
This device is worn on the forearm. Readings are taken through the skin, so
there’s no insertion of a needle. Readings are provided every ten minutes for
up to 13 hours. Low and high blood glucose readings are marked by alarms.
This meter is meant to detect trends and track patterns but not replace
finger-stick testing. After a two-hour warm-up period, you calibrate the meter,
which sounds an alarm if the reading is below a low-alert level or above a
high-alert level set by the doctor. This meter stores more than 8,500 individ-
ual readings. Perspiration interferes with the readings. Redness, itching, and
blisters may appear at the site of the device.
Guardian RT Glucose Monitoring System
This device has a sensor inserted into the skin; a wireless transmitter connects
the sensor to a receiver. It takes readings every ten seconds and averages
them every five minutes. You can see the readings by pushing a button. The
meter holds 21 days of data, which may be downloaded to a computer. It
sounds an alarm or vibrates to alert you of low and high glucose levels.
However, any significant abnormalities should be verified by a finger stick.
Also, you must calibrate the meter daily with at least two finger sticks.

Eating a Healthy Diet
In This Chapter
 Considering the sources of calories: Carbohydrate, protein, and fat
 Getting the right amounts of vitamins, minerals, and water
 Overcoming diet challenges at every age
 Thinking about sweeteners, fast food, and vegetarianism
 Coping with eating disorders
I
f your child has type 1 diabetes (T1DM for short), what he eats will play a
large role in his health. This doesn’t mean that he has to follow a boring
and unpalatable diet. It means that you have to be more aware of what he 
eats, especially how it contributes to his blood glucose, blood cholesterol, and
blood pressure. (He should be aware of all this too, if you think he’s old enough
to understand and contribute to this aspect of his diabetes management.)
A healthy diet accomplishes a number of things for the person with T1DM.
Here are some of the more important benefits:
 It makes controlling blood glucose much easier. When you’re aware of
the amounts of fat, protein, and especially carbohydrate in your child’s
diet, it’s easier to keep the blood glucose in a range that keeps the hemo-
globin A1c at 7 percent or less, thereby preventing complications like eye,
kidney, and nerve disease. (See Chapter 7 for more about hemoglobin
A1c.)
 It makes it easier to help your child maintain a normal weight. With a
healthy diet, you have a better grasp of your child’s total calorie intake.
Therefore, you avoid adding insulin resistance to lack of insulin as the
cause of high blood glucose.
 It helps you keep your child’s total cholesterol and bad cholesterol
low while increasing his good cholesterol. A healthy diet involves
reducing the fats that are bad for him and substituting fats that are
healthy. The effect on cholesterol reduces the risk of the heart disease
complication of diabetes.

 It keeps you aware of your child’s salt intake, allowing you to control
that contribution to his blood pressure. High blood pressure is an
important factor that leads to diabetic kidney disease. (Another impor-
tant factor is high blood glucose.)
 It improves your child’s energy level. Eating the right foods in the right
amounts means that your child’s getting the vitamins, minerals, and
other nutrients that his body requires for peak performance.
In this chapter, you find out all you need to know to help your child (or your-
self, if you’re the patient) enjoy food while maintaining a balanced blood 
glucose.
Be sure to consult a dietitian for help with calorie intake and meal planning
(see Chapter 2 for info on adding a dietitian to a diabetes care team).
Carbohydrates: The Energy Source with
the Biggest Impact on Blood Glucose
When you eat, you take energy into your body from three different sources:
carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Each source is important to your body, and
you can’t live without the contribution of all three. However, when it comes
to T1DM, the energy source that’s directly responsible for the level of your
blood glucose is carbohydrate. Protein and fat play a role but only indirectly
and to a much lesser extent (I discuss protein and fat later in this chapter).
Most people who think of carbohydrate think of sugar, but there are many
forms of carbohydrate. The following simple carbohydrates can be digested
by enzymes in the stomach and intestine:
 Glucose is the sugar that circulates in the bloodstream and provides
energy for movement and for all the chemical reactions taking place in
the body. It’s a monosaccharide because it contains only one molecule 
of sugar, as do fructose and galactose.
 Sucrose is a disaccharide because it has two sugar molecules. You may
know it as the sugar in sugar cane and beets or as simple table sugar.
Other disaccharides are lactose (milk sugar) and maltose (malt sugar).
 Starches are made up of large numbers of sugar molecules.
Other types of carbohydrate are complex carbohydrates including cellulose,
the carbohydrate that forms the walls of plant cells; and fiber. Neither of
these complex carbohydrates can be digested, which means that they pro-
vide no calories.
128
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

These are the important functions of all carbohydrates in the body:
 They’re the major source of energy for muscles.
 The carbohydrate glucose stimulates the pancreas to release insulin, if
the pancreas can. In the absence of effective insulin in the body, glucose
can rise to very high levels.
 They raise the level of the blood fat called triglyceride.
In the following sections, I explain what you need to know about the use of
carbohydrates in the diet of a person with type 1 diabetes, including some
smart food choices and the relationship between carbohydrate amounts and
insulin intake.
Americans are eating less fat yet continue to get fatter. Analysis of the
American diet shows that people haven’t increased their protein intake, so
they must be eating more carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can be turned into
fat in the body, so if you consume excessive amounts, you’ll gain weight. This
ancient characteristic of mammals was fine when humans could only find
food in the summer and had to live on body fat in the winter. Today, the con-
version of carbohydrates into fat causes all kinds of disturbances like heart
attacks and strokes. Experts recommend that 40 to 50 percent of a person’s
daily calorie intake should be from carbohydrates (1 gram of carbohydrate
contains 4 kilocalories). And yes, people with diabetes can eat real carbohy-
drates rather than artificial sweeteners so long as they don’t eat too many
total calories. (I discuss sweeteners in detail later in this chapter.)
Getting a grip on the glycemic index
The glycemic index (GI) of a carbohydrate is the effect that a particular carbo-
hydrate has on the blood glucose. Here’s how it works: Glucose itself is
assigned a GI of 100. A food with the same number of grams of carbohydrate
as glucose (usually 50 grams) is eaten, and the blood glucose is measured
two hours later. If the food raises the blood glucose as rapidly and as high as
glucose does, it too has a GI of 100. If it raises the blood glucose half as much,
its GI is 50. If it raises it one and a half times more, its GI is 150.
The GI isn’t used as much as it could be in nutritional planning for T1DM for
several reasons, including the following:
 GI values are for isolated foods. The values change when the carbohy-
drate is part of a mixed meal.
 GI is dependent on the way food is cooked; for instance, the GI of a
baked potato is different from that of a boiled potato.
 Just because the GI is low doesn’t mean that the food is good for your
child with diabetes if it contains a lot of fat. Chocolate is one example.
129
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

 Some diabetes educators feel that the concept is too confusing for people
with diabetes to understand. I think that if you’re smart enough to read
this book, you’re smart enough to understand the GI. You need to use
every available tool to keep your child’s blood glucose level under con-
trol, and the GI can be a valuable tool for people with T1DM. It has been
shown that people whose overall food history incorporates more foods
with low GI have lower incidences of diabetic complications.
In the following sections, I give you the GI values of a few common foods and
show you how to swap out high-GI foods for healthier, low-GI versions.
The best source for more information on the glycemic index is www.glycemic
index.com, a site maintained by the University of Sydney in Australia. The
site offers two valuable books: The New Glucose Revolution, 3rd Edition, which
offers a complete explanation of the concept plus a list of the GI values of
most foods; and The New Glucose Revolution, Shopper’s Guide to GI Values,
2007, which contains only the list of GI values.
Comparing the GI values of a few common foods
Table 8-1 shows the GI values of several common foods. A high GI is in the
range of 65 to 100, a medium GI is the range of 45 to 64, and a low GI is in 
the range of 0 to 44. You can see that plenty of good choices are in the
medium- and low-GI categories. With the exception of milk, you could say that
you should avoid the white foods: potatoes, white rice, and white bread.
Table 8-1
Glycemic Index Values of Several Common Foods
High GI
Medium GI
Low GI
Glucose: 100
Rice, long grain: 58
Banana, yellow-green: 42
Potato, baked: 85
Honey: 55
Orange: 42
Waffles: 76
Banana, all yellow: 51
Ice cream: 37
Potato, boiled: 74
Pasta: 48
Kidney beans: 28
White bread: 70
Lactose: 46
Milk (2%): 21
Table sugar: 68
Grapes: 46
Fructose: 19
White rice: 64
Rye bread: 46
Peanuts: 14
Some foods can’t be given a GI value because they have so little carbohydrate.
Examples are beef, chicken, fish, vegetables, and alcohol. They don’t affect
blood glucose immediately, but the fat in beef and the empty calories in alco-
hol make them poor food choices anyway. (See Chapter 12 for information on
alcohol use.)
130
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Replacing high-GI foods with low-GI foods
Table 8-2 shows some simple substitutions you can make in your child’s diet
(or your own) to emphasize low-GI foods. If you do this consistently, you’ll find
the result in terms of blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c very gratifying.
Table 8-2
Simple Diet Substitutions
High-GI Food
Low-GI Food
Whole-meal or white bread
Whole-grain bread
Processed breakfast cereal
Unrefined cereals like oats or processed 
low-GI cereals (such as Kellogg’s All-Bran 
Complete Oat or Wheat Flakes)
Plain cookies and crackers
Cookies made with dried fruits or whole 
grains like oats
Cakes and muffins
Cakes and muffins made with fruit, oats, 
and whole grains
Potatoes
Pasta or legumes
White rice
Basmati or brown rice
Table 8-2 confirms that it’s relatively easy to make a switch from high- to low-
GI foods. Just choose grainier foods and foods that are less processed. If pos-
sible, rather than switching, feed your child low-GI foods from the start. It will
make the task of controlling his blood glucose that much easier.
Low-GI foods aren’t a good choice when you’re treating hypoglycemia. In that
situation, you want to give your child foods that provide a glucose load as
quickly as possible. See Chapter 4 for more about hypoglycemia.
Understanding the glycemic load
In addition to glycemic index, you may want to consider the glycemic load.
The glycemic load of a food is based on the glycemic index but also takes
into account the amount of carbohydrate in a portion. A food that has a high
glycemic index may not be that bad for your child if the portion is so small
that the total grams of carbohydrate don’t raise his glucose that much. An
example is pumpkin, which has a high GI of 75 but few grams of carbohydrate
in the small portion that’s usually consumed. Another example is cantaloupe,
which has a glycemic index of 65 but a low glycemic load in the typical por-
tion size. Many foods that have low glycemic loads aren’t necessarily good
for your child, like ice cream and beef, so you should emphasize glycemic
index rather than glycemic load in making food choices for your child.
131
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Filling up with fiber
Although fiber is a carbohydrate, the digestive enzymes in the stomach and
intestine can’t break it down, so it can’t be used for energy and isn’t counted
as calories. It plays an important role in the diet in its two forms:
 Soluble fiber: Dissolves in water and forms a jelly-like material that blocks
the digestive enzymes from getting to food, thereby slowing the uptake
of carbohydrate from the intestine.
 Insoluble fiber: Doesn’t dissolve in water but can be processed so much
when it’s milled that it doesn’t prevent digestive enzymes from getting to
food. Insoluble fiber is the roughage in the intestine that prevents consti-
pation and colon cancer.
It seems that people prefer “smooth” foods — foods with few whole grains
that can give the food a chunky, grainy taste. But it’s the grainy, unrefined
foods that are full of fiber and much better for the health of your child with
T1DM because they help keep the blood glucose at the right level. Foods with
lots of fiber (especially insoluble fiber) include fruits and vegetables, multi-
grain bread, and legumes like peas and beans.
Although the recommendation for adults is 20 to 30 grams of fiber daily, chil-
dren can’t comfortably consume that much. For children, the daily fiber intake
should be their age plus 5, so a 5-year-old should have 10 grams of fiber a day.
Don’t suddenly introduce a lot of fiber into your child’s diet. Add it slowly
(1 to 2 grams a week) so that he doesn’t complain of a lot of gas. (The gas
occurs when the carbohydrate in the fiber reaches the bacteria in the large
intestine that break it down.)
Carbohydrate counting
Using the amount of carbohydrates in a meal to determine your child’s insulin
dose is called carbohydrate counting. The key to this system is knowing the
carbohydrate in your child’s food. Here’s where you make use of your friendly
dietitian, who can go over his food preferences and tell you how many grams
of carbohydrate are in them. The dietitian also can show you where to find
carbohydrate counts for any other foods that your child may eat.
For carbohydrate counting, you also need to know how many grams of carbo-
hydrate are controlled by each unit of insulin your child takes. This is deter-
mined by checking his blood glucose one hour after eating a known amount
of carbohydrate. For example, one person may need 1 unit of rapid-acting
insulin to control 20 grams of carbohydrate, whereas another person needs 
132
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

1 unit of rapid-acting insulin to control 15 grams of carbohydrate. If both
people eat a breakfast of 75 grams of carbohydrate, the first person may take
4 units of insulin, whereas the second person takes 5 units of insulin. Then
they add units to the base number for the amount that the blood glucose
needs to be lowered. A typical insulin schedule involves taking 1 unit of insulin
for every 50 mg/dl that the blood glucose is above 100 mg/dl. You also can
subtract insulin if the blood glucose is too low. For every 50 mg/dl that the
glucose is below 100, subtract 1 unit. (To see how carbohydrate counting
works in practice, see the sidebar “A true-to-life example of carbohydrate
counting.”)
By measuring your child’s blood glucose frequently, you find out how differ-
ent carbohydrates affect his blood glucose. He needs less insulin to control
the carbohydrate sources that have a low glycemic index (I discuss the GI
earlier in this chapter).
Another great advantage of carbohydrate counting is that your child can eat
a variety of foods as long as you know the carbohydrate count of what he’s
eating. Children who are allowed this variety are much happier with their
food, and their hemoglobin A1cs are significantly lower.
133
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet
A true-to-life example of carbohydrate counting
To find out how you can accomplish carbohy-
drate counting in everyday life, take a typical
type 1 patient. Salvatore is a 41-year-old who
has had type 1 diabetes for 31 years. His dia-
betes has been well controlled because he 
follows a good diet, gets lots of exercise, and
takes his insulin appropriately. He takes 30 units
of insulin glargine (see Chapter 10 for details 
on this and other types of insulin) at bedtime.
Salvatore has a list of dosages of lispro insulin
that tells him to take 1 unit of insulin for each 20
grams of carbohydrate he eats. He’s about to
have breakfast and knows that it will contain 80
grams of carbohydrate. Therefore, he needs 4
units of lispro insulin. He measures his blood
glucose before breakfast and finds it at 202
mg/dl. His doctor has told him to take an extra
unit of lispro insulin for each 50 mg/dl above 100
mg/dl. He adds two more units for a total of 6
units of insulin taken just before breakfast.
At lunch, his blood glucose measures 58. He’s
about to have a lunch of 120 grams of carbohy-
drate, so he needs 6 units. However, he reduces
it by 1 unit because the glucose measurement
is approximately 50 mg/dl lower than 100, so his
final dose is 5 units.
Before supper, Salvatore’s blood glucose mea-
sures 120. His supper contains only 60 grams of
carbohydrate, so he needs 3 units. He doesn’t
have to adjust the dose because the glucose is
close to 100, so he takes only 3 units.
At bedtime, his blood glucose is 108, so he’s
doing very well. Unless the blood glucose is 200
or greater, he doesn’t need to take any bedtime
lispro because he’s taking insulin glargine to
control his glucose overnight.

Other tips for managing 
carbohydrate intake
There’s a lot to know about the way that carbohydrates affect blood glucose
in addition to the grams of carbohydrates eaten (see the previous section).
Carbohydrates aren’t usually eaten alone, and as I mention earlier in the chap-
ter, the other foods eaten with them play a role in how rapidly the carbohy-
drates are absorbed and raise blood glucose. Check out these facts about
how carbohydrates work with other foods:
 When your child eats carbohydrates that tend to be swallowed in larger
pieces like rice and pasta, absorption is slowed by the need to break
down those pieces in the intestine. His blood glucose rises more slowly.
 When your child eats carbohydrates with fat, the fat slows down the
movement of food through the intestine, so the blood glucose rises 
more slowly.
 Chewing food thoroughly means that food is broken down into small
pieces; therefore, the carbohydrate is absorbed more rapidly.
 Whole fruit, like an orange, requires breakdown of cell walls in the intes-
tine, but that breakdown has already occurred in orange juice. The 
carbohydrate in orange juice is absorbed more rapidly than the carbo-
hydrate in a whole orange. The same is true of finely ground flour, as
found in white bread compared with whole-grain bread.
 Drinking a beverage with a meal makes the food pass more rapidly into
the intestine where it’s absorbed, so blood glucose rises more rapidly.
 Light exercise like walking speeds up the absorption of glucose, whereas
heavy exercise like running slows it down.
 Very cold or hot food slows down the emptying of the stomach, thus
slowing the absorption of glucose.
 A high blood glucose slows the emptying of the stomach, whereas a low
blood glucose speeds it up.
 Smaller meals with snacks in between result in a more consistent level of
blood glucose.
These effects help to explain why the blood glucose rises as much as it does
after some meals and rises very slowly after others. Being aware of them allows
you to adjust the timing of your child’s insulin to match the absorption of the
glucose. For example, if he takes rapid-acting insulin and you know that a par-
ticular meal will result in slower absorption of glucose because it’s high in fat,
you may want to give his insulin after the meal rather than before. That way
the insulin is active when the food is being absorbed. Flip to Chapter 10 for
full details on using insulin properly.

Looking at Other Sources of Energy
Even though carbohydrates are the most important source of energy for
everyone (especially folks with T1DM), you can’t forget about protein and 
fat. In the following sections, I explain the effects of protein and fat on blood
glucose and provide examples of good (and bad) foods that contain them.
Protein
Protein, the second major source of calories in your child’s diet, is found in
the muscles of animals (beef, poultry, and fish), cheese, eggs, and milk. It’s
usually accompanied by more or less fat, depending upon the source.
Protein in a meal doesn’t contribute to the blood glucose immediately. It takes
several hours for protein to be converted into sugar in the body unless the
blood glucose is low, in which case the conversion happens much more
rapidly.
You should be selecting low-fat sources of protein for your child, developing
his palate so that he enjoys food without fat. Following are some fast facts
about sources of protein:
 The protein sources with the least amount of fat (only 1 gram per ounce
of protein) are very lean meat or fish and fat-free cheese. Shellfish like
lobster and shrimp are included in this category.
 Lean protein with 3 grams of fat per ounce includes lean beef and pork,
dark meat chicken, oily fish like salmon, and some cheese. These
sources of protein are still a good choice for your child, especially 
oily fish because the fat in it is omega-3 fatty acid, which has beneficial
effects on the heart. Omega-3 fatty acid has been shown to:
• Decrease abnormalities of the heart rhythm
• Reduce triglyceride levels
• Slow the growth of arteriosclerosis
• Slightly reduce blood pressure
Serve your family a minimum of two meals of oily fish per week so that
everyone gets enough omega-3 fatty acid.
 The categories of medium-fat proteins with 5 grams of fat per ounce and
high-fat proteins with 8 grams of fat per ounce include foods that should
be limited in your child’s diet (because of the very high fat content, of
course). Fried foods, processed sandwich meats, regular fat meats, and
very fatty meats like bacon and pork are in these categories.
135
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Fat has more than twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrate and
protein. Eating a lot of protein in the medium- to high-fat category will
cause weight gain, and the fat in these foods is the kind that raises cho-
lesterol and worsens arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
Another factor to consider when selecting protein sources (besides fat con-
tent) is the amount of mercury in certain fish. Regularly eating fish with high
levels of mercury can lead to mercury poisoning and is especially bad for
young children and pregnant and nursing mothers. The fish with the most
mercury that you should avoid are shark, swordfish, mackerel, and tilefish.
For several reasons, experts feel strongly about limiting protein in the diet to
20 percent of calories (a gram of protein contains 4 kilocalories). One reason
is the fat that’s consumed with the protein, although choosing low-fat sources
of protein reduces this problem. Another reason is that although higher
levels of protein haven’t been shown to hurt normal kidneys, they do seem to
worsen the damage in kidneys that are failing. A study in The Journal of Renal
Nutrition in May 2007 showed that a diet very low in protein could postpone
the need for dialysis in all patients with chronic kidney disease.
Fat
Fat doesn’t have a direct immediate effect on the blood glucose level.
Consumed to excess, it causes weight gain, and increased weight results in
resistance to insulin. In fact, as I mention earlier, fat in a meal may lower
blood glucose by slowing the absorption of the glucose.
Children need a lot of fat in their diet up until the age of 5. Breast milk is 50
percent fat, for example. After the age of 5, children should begin eating a diet
of less fat, with the emphasis on types of fat that decrease the development
of arteriosclerosis rather than increase it. The fats to avoid are saturated fats
and trans fats.
When a child is a little older (over age 5), the recommended daily intake of fat
is 30 percent of kilocalories and no more than 300 mg of cholesterol (which is
one type of fat) in the diet. That much cholesterol is found in an egg yolk. An
ounce of hard cheese like cheddar has 28 mg of cholesterol, and a glass of
whole milk has 35 mg of cholesterol. Switch your child to skim milk and you
drop to just 5 mg of cholesterol.
In addition to cholesterol, fat comes as several forms of triglyceride.
 Saturated fat raises a person’s cholesterol level and worsens arterioscle-
rosis. It’s the main fat in meat, but it’s also present in certain vegetable
oils, especially coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil. If your child
must have that occasional steak, encourage him to cut off all visible fat.
136
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 Trans fatty acid, though present in nature, is mostly added to foods by
food manufacturers looking to replace butter. The trouble is that trans
fatty acids not only raise LDL (bad) cholesterol, but they lower HDL
(good) cholesterol at the same time, so they are even worse than butter!
(See Chapter 7 for an introduction to good and bad types of cholesterol.)
 Unsaturated fat is a much better choice than saturated fat and trans
fatty acids because it doesn’t raise bad cholesterol. It can be either of
the following:
• Monounsaturated fat, which is in avocado, olive oil, canola oil, and
nuts like almonds and peanuts.
• Polyunsaturated fat, which is in soft fats and oils such as corn oil,
mayonnaise, and margarine. Polyunsaturated fat lowers good 
cholesterol, however.
Fat should make up 30 percent of your child’s daily caloric intake, and most
of that 30 percent should be from the unsaturated fat group.
What do you feed your child with T1DM to improve his cholesterol level with-
out damaging his blood glucose? Here are some suggestions:
 Oatmeal lowers the bad cholesterol but also contains soluble fiber, so it
slows the absorption of glucose. Apples and pears make good snacks
because they also provide soluble fiber (which I discuss earlier in this
chapter).
 A handful of walnuts or almonds is a great snack that reduces bad cho-
lesterol. But don’t overdo the nuts — the “good” fat in them is still fat
and has 9 kilocalories per gram.
 Delicious salmon provides the omega-3 fatty acids described in the pre-
vious section on protein to lower triglycerides. Walnuts, canola oil, and
soybean oil have omega-3s that do the same.
Soy protein, once thought to have cholesterol-lowering power, has now been
shown to have little effect on the cholesterol.
Getting Enough Vitamins, 
Minerals, and Water
In addition to carbohydrate, protein, and fat, people with type 1 diabetes
need vitamins, minerals, and plenty of water in their diets. I explain the
basics of these nutrients in the following sections.
137
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Vitamins
Vitamins and minerals are food substances that the body needs in minute
quantities. Luckily, a balanced diet usually provides all these in sufficient
amounts. Table 8-3 shows the various food sources that you need to provide
for your child to make sure he gets enough vitamins.

Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Kids don’t need vitamin pills (nor do most adults) if they eat a healthy diet.
Only in cases in which the body rapidly uses food and vitamins, as in preg-
nancy, is there a possibility that the person doesn’t get enough of these vita-
mins. Then a supplemental vitamin pill makes sense. Otherwise, it’s just a
waste of money.
Minerals
Minerals provide structure in your child’s body, and he may need extra
amounts of them to ensure that he gets enough. This is true for any child, not
just one with T1DM. Here are a few important minerals for both children and
adults:
 Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium: These minerals build bones and
teeth. Fortunately, children get enough of them from milk and other dairy
products. Adults, especially women, usually need to supplement their
calcium intake by taking calcium tablets.
 Iron: This mineral is a major component of hemoglobin in red blood cells.
Thanks to Popeye, spinach is considered a good source of iron, as are
other leafy green vegetables. Other good sources are meat, beans, and
seafood.
As your daughter with T1DM begins to menstruate, she loses iron each
time she bleeds. It’s important to make sure she gets foods with 
extra iron.
 Sodium: This mineral helps to regulate body water. It seems like every-
thing has salt in it naturally, and it’s pretty difficult to avoid consuming
too much, especially if you ever take your child to a fast-food place. Teach
your child to enjoy the taste of food without added salt. His blood pres-
sure will benefit. Don’t put salt on the table at mealtimes, and don’t use
it in cooking.
 Chromium: This mineral, which is found in whole grains, bran cereals,
and potatoes, is often claimed to be missing in people with diabetes.
This claim is one of the myths you’re likely to come across when looking
on the Internet for treatments for diabetes. Scientific literature still
hasn’t proven this point.
 Iodine: This mineral is a critical part of the thyroid hormones. If your
child eats any kind of bread, he gets enough iodine because the bread 
is fortified with iodized salt.
 Various other minerals, like chlorine, cobalt, tin, and zinc: These min-
erals are found in many foods. There is very little likelihood that a child
will be deficient in any of them, which generally are required in very
small amounts.
139
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Water
The last nutrient in this section by no means is the least important. The human
body is 50 to 70 percent water. A child needs to drink a minimum of 5 cups,
or 11⁄4 quarts, of water a day; adults need a minimum of 8 cups. Most children
drink exactly what they need according to how thirsty they feel. Keep fresh,
cool water available for your child so that he doesn’t turn to fruit juice or
soda when he’s thirsty. Water comes from many sources in addition to a 
glass of water; for example, all foods contain some water.
Understanding Diet Challenges 
at Every Age
Children with T1DM should follow the nutritional guidelines that I provide
earlier in this chapter, but as with all children, diet challenges can arise. Here
are some issues that you may face as your child grows (for any serious diet
issues, be sure to consult a dietitian):
 The newborn: Hopefully, the newborn is breast-feeding, but if breast-
feeding isn’t possible, formula may be used for a baby with T1DM. It’s
unusual for a newborn to develop T1DM, but should it occur, the high fat
content of breast milk (50 percent fat) will result in very slow absorption
of the sugar in milk. Short-acting insulin should be given before each
breast or formula feeding. Very small amounts of insulin are required,
sometimes measured in half units.
 The toddler: A child at this age may be a picky eater, but he’ll probably
eat enough to grow normally. It may be necessary to determine the dose
and give insulin after the child has eaten so that you know how many
grams of carbohydrate have been consumed. Toddlers often don’t feel
hungry early in the morning, so breakfast may be missed. If glucose is
needed for low blood glucose, giving it in a gel form may be better than 
a tablet because the gel doesn’t have to be chewed.
 Preschooler: A child at this age is beginning a growth spurt that will last
the next 15 years. A preschooler’s activity level and food intake is very
erratic, so it’s hard to predict the correct insulin dosage. Therefore,
attempting to control the blood glucose in a child this age is difficult.
Preschoolers obtain a large amount of their energy from fat rather than
carbohydrates. They don’t do well on high-fiber foods, which upset their
stomachs. They may use food as a way of gaining some control, which
makes feeding them even more difficult. Try to give your preschooler
with T1DM a choice in what he eats, and praise him for good eating 
140
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

behavior. Never force-feed your child if you think he isn’t getting enough
calories. It’s usually best to give a preschooler insulin after eating because 
you know how much carbohydrate he has eaten.
 Primary school and prepuberty: For children who are at the age of
entering school, diet challenges shift from the home environment to the
school because the children spend so much time at school and eat at
least one meal there. It’s necessary to work with the school dietitian 
to set up a good meal program. (Of course, the child may not follow it
anyway.) One thing that may make control easier is the regimentation of
the school environment and the tendency to serve the same thing on a
regular basis.
Someone at the school has to be able to determine how much insulin
should be given and give it (see Chapter 14 for more on handling dia-
betes at school). It’s better to err on the side of too little than too much
insulin. At this age, your child is increasingly active, and this has to be
taken into account when determining the insulin dose. It may be easier
to control his diabetes if the meals are smaller and the snacks more
numerous, thus reducing the amount of insulin needed at any one time.
 Puberty from 13 to 19 years of age: Children at this age are much more
capable of understanding the importance of good control of the blood
glucose and, hopefully, will adopt the eating habits that make control
easier. At this age, your child is under the influence of many hormones
that tend to raise the blood glucose, especially growth hormone, so
insulin needs may be higher. At the same time, he’s doing his best not to
stick out, so if the group goes for candy, he will too. Lapses like this will
certainly make glucose control more difficult.
Children with T1DM generally know what they need to eat to grow normally
and stop eating when they’re no longer hungry. You can always check that
this is the case for your child by comparing him with the standard height and
weight tables for his age. You can find these charts at pediatrics.about.
com/cs/growthcharts2/l/bl_growthcharts.htm. Your pediatrician
should also have them, and you can check at a routine visit (see Chapter 7
for details about doctor visits).
Focusing on Other Food Factors
If only eating were just as simple as getting the right amount of nutrients!
Folks with T1DM have to deal with a variety of factors that affect their basic
diets, such as sugar substitutes, fast food, and vegetarianism. I delve into 
the details of these factors in the following sections.
141
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Using sugar substitutes
Before the isolation of insulin in 1921, sugar was thought to be extremely dan-
gerous for the person with T1DM. With nothing available to lower the blood
sugar, consuming sugar actually was pretty dangerous. By completely cutting
sugar from the diet of these patients, they survived a little longer (although
most died in childhood soon after the diagnosis was made).
Old habits take a long time to die, and there are still plenty of people, even
doctors, who think that people with diabetes must avoid sugar at all costs.
Most physicians no longer believe this and permit some sugar in the diet of
patients with T1DM, but the wish to avoid sugar has created an industry of
products with fewer or no calories yet great sweetening power.
You can use sweeteners for your child with T1DM by substituting one for sugar
in a recipe, but you need to know their sweetening power to use them cor-
rectly. I give you the scoop in the following sections.
Sugar-free food can still have plenty of fat and protein calories. Because total
calories are what counts in the diet, there’s no great advantage to eating sugar-
free products when the result may be that your child’s getting as many or
more total calories.
Calorie-containing sweeteners
This group consists of a sugar similar to glucose and the so-called sugar alco-
hols, the names of which end in –ol. Fructose has the same number of kilo-
calories per gram as glucose (4), but the sugar alcohols have half as many (2).
Food manufacturers like to use the sugar alcohols in all kinds of products
that they call “sugarless,” but it’s important to remember that the sugar alco-
hols aren’t calorie-free. Here’s a rundown of fructose and sugar alcohols:
 Fructose is fruit sugar found in fruits and berries. Its great advantage it
that it’s absorbed much more slowly than glucose although it has about
the same sweetening power as table sugar, which is sucrose.
 Xylitol is a sugar alcohol found in strawberries and raspberries. Xylitol
has the sweetening power of sucrose. It’s taken up slowly from the intes-
tine, so it causes little change in blood glucose. Xylitol doesn’t cause
cavities of the teeth as often as the other sweeteners containing calories,
so it’s commonly used in chewing gum, hard candy, and some drugs.
 Sorbitol and mannitol are sugar alcohols occurring in plants. Sorbitol
and mannitol are half as sweet as table sugar and have little effect on
blood glucose. They change to fructose in the body. (I mention sorbitol
in Chapter 5. When taken as a food, sorbitol doesn’t accumulate and
damage tissues.) Sorbitol is used in candies, chewing gum, jams and jel-
lies, and baked goods. Mannitol is used in chewing gum, candies, jams
and jellies, and frostings.
142
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners
These sweeteners contain no calories yet are much sweeter than sucrose by
weight. Several of them have been very controversial as far as the possibility
that they cause cancer. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has developed the concept of acceptable daily intake, or ADI. This is the maxi-
mum daily intake that’s safe to consume each day over a lifetime. ADI is listed
in the form that the sweetener usually appears or the food that it’s usually
added to. For example, saccharin’s ADI is expressed in packets because it’s
used that way.
The ADIs in the following list are for adults. The ADI for a child is based on
the size of a child compared to an average adult. For example, if the average
adult is 150 pounds, the ADI for a 75-pound child is half the adult value.
 Aspartame: It’s 150 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose. Many people
seem to prefer the taste of aspartame, which is sold under the brand
name Equal. It has an ADI of 18 to 19 cans of diet soda. It’s not useful 
for cooking.
 Acesulfame: This sweetener is 200 times sweeter than sucrose and
doesn’t leave an aftertaste. Sold under the brand names Sunett and
Sweet One, it can be used in cooking and is found in numerous foods
and beverages as well as a tabletop sweetener. It has an ADI of 30 to 32
cans of diet soda.
 Saccharin: This sweetener is 300 to 400 times sweeter than sucrose.
Brand names include Sweet’N Low and Sugar Twin. The ADI for saccha-
rin is 9 to 12 packets per day.
 Sucralose: This sweetener is obtained from sugar and is 600 times
sweeter. Sold under the name Splenda, it’s very stable and can be 
used in place of sugar in any food. It leaves no unpleasant aftertaste. 
Its ADI is six cans of diet soda.
 Neotame: Authorized by the FDA in July 2000, neotame has 7,000 to 13,000
times the sweetening power of sucrose. It isn’t used in commercial prod-
ucts yet, but food manufacturers are working with it because cooking it
doesn’t reduce its sweetening power. Because it isn’t available in foods,
there’s no ADI for neotame and the brand name is not yet determined.
Considering fast food
Is it even important to include fast-food restaurants in a discussion of type 1
diabetes? McDonald’s claims to serve 26 million customers every day in the
United States. That’s almost one in ten of all Americans. It has 13,700 restau-
rants, compared with 7,600 for Burger King, 5,900 for Wendy’s, and 3,300 for
Arby’s. You bet these restaurants have a huge impact on eating in America.
143
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

People used to say that at fast-food restaurants, you could get more nourish-
ment from biting your lip than from eating the food. This is definitely no
longer the case. Because everyone is conscious of good nutrition these days,
you can find something healthful to eat in any fast-food restaurant. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain the benefits of being prepared before walking into a
fast-food joint and recommend a few dishes at popular restaurants.
Knowing what you’re getting into
The reason these establishments are called fast-food restaurants is that they’ve
mastered food preparation, ordering, and serving so that they take the least
amount of time possible. Because people are in a hurry when they’re out and
about, they don’t want to stop for a long time. There’s nothing wrong with
enjoying that convenience, but you need to make sure that the food you
choose is right for your child with T1DM.
Of course, it’s possible to sit down and take your time eating at some of these
places, but the food is still standardized and prepared pretty fast, so the result
is about the same.
One advantage of franchise restaurants is that a hamburger in a Denny’s in
California is almost exactly the same as a hamburger in a Denny’s in New
Mexico or Oregon. You know exactly what your child is getting, which makes
the meal easier to fit into your child’s diet. On the other hand, the quick serv-
ing and eating often doesn’t allow the brain enough time to recognize that the
body has eaten enough calories, and you may be tempted to order more
food. Don’t.
A study published in The Lancet in December 2004 that followed 3,000 people
over 15 years showed that those who ate at fast-food restaurants regularly
gained 10 pounds more than those who didn’t, and the fast-food eaters also
were much more likely to develop diabetes.
Food that’s fried in a fast-food restaurant may be fried in trans fats. These
fats, also called hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, not only increase
hardening of the arteries like saturated fats and cholesterol do, but they 
also reduce the levels of good cholesterol. Since 2006, food labels have been
required to include the amount of trans fats, and the better fast-food places
are trying to eliminate them from their cooking processes. Trans fats are still
present in large amounts, however, especially in foods like French fries,
batter-dipped onion rings, fried mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The
best way to avoid trans fats is to order food that’s low in all fats.
No one should say that a person with T1DM can’t go to a fast-food restaurant
and remain on his or her nutritional plan. But these places do offer many
seductive and unhealthy choices. You need to plan in advance what you’re
going to choose for your child (or yourself, if you’re the patient). If you want
to be sure of the nutritional content of various fast foods, pick up a copy of
the Guide to Healthy Restaurant Eating by Hope S. Warshaw and published by
144
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

the American Diabetes Association; to order, call 800-232-6733 or check your
local bookstore. This book covers a lot of the available restaurant chains (but
definitely not all of them). You also can find a great deal of information about
fast-food offerings on the Web. Enter the name of a specific franchise into your
favorite search engine, and visit the homepage. Most of the franchises have
links to the nutritional content of their foods. You can see the amount of car-
bohydrate, protein, and fat in your child’s favorite foods as well as the total
calories.
Some specific fast-food recommendations
Here are a few suggestions for decent food choices at some very popular fast-
food restaurants:
 A hamburger at Burger King isn’t a bad choice for lunch. It contains 330
kcalories (kilocalories is the correct measurement, not calories, which is
a much smaller number) and about 30 grams of carbohydrate, 20 grams
of protein, and 12 grams of fat. The Burger King hamburger contains 530
milligrams of sodium. If your child goes up to the bacon double cheese-
burger, he consumes 640 kcalories with 1,240 milligrams of sodium, so
keep him away from those.
 Denny’s menu offers some healthy choices, such as the Grilled Chicken
Dinner. It has about 200 kilocalories, 25 percent of which are fat calories,
25 percent carbohydrate calories, and 50 percent protein calories, which
isn’t a good balance. But your child can have some carrots and a baked
potato to add carbohydrates. Without any extras, the Grilled Chicken
Dinner contains about 824 milligrams of sodium, so the dish is not ideal
as far as sodium is concerned. This dinner choice also contains 30
grams of carbohydrate.
 At Domino’s Pizza, your child may have two slices of medium cheese,
deep-dish pizza with peppers and mushrooms as the toppings. Peppers
and mushrooms add very little to the calorie count, so you don’t need to
consider them in his food plan. Two slices of the pizza provides about
375 kilocalories with 10 grams of fat and about 500 milligrams of sodium.
The carbohydrate count is 45 grams. A small green salad with fat-free
dressing provides a satisfying, low-calorie addition.
 McDonald’s has all kinds of choices for breakfast, some good and some
not so good. The Egg McMuffin is a good choice at only 290 kcalories and
30 grams of carbohydrate. If your child orders the scrambled eggs, he still
gets eggs but loses the carbs and a lot of sodium. That’s the only suitable
breakfast option at McDonald’s for your child with T1DM, however.
Avoid McDonald’s hotcakes at 600 kcalories; the biscuit with sausage,
mostly made of fat and a gram of salt; and particularly the biscuit with
bacon, egg, and cheese, which has 480 kcalories and 1.4 grams of salt
with too much fat.
145
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

 Arby’s roast beef sandwich looks good, but should your child get the
junior, regular, or super size? It’s not that hard a choice: The junior has
324 kcalories with about 22 grams of carbohydrate, not too bad. But the
regular goes up to 388 kcalories, and the super tops out at 523 kcalories.
The sodium content likewise climbs from 779 to 1009 to 1189 milligrams
of salt. So the junior size is clearly the best choice for your child.
Choosing a vegetarian diet
Children need a lot of calories, particularly fat calories, and it may be difficult
to provide enough calories with a vegetarian diet. Although it’s possible to
provide all the nutrients necessary for a healthy diet by eating vegetarian, it’s
wise to avoid this kind of diet with young children because their eating habits
tend to be so erratic.
Your child with T1DM may decide that he wants to follow a vegetarian diet
when he reaches his teens. At this point, I recommend that you meet with a
dietitian to work out a program that provides the essential nutrients while
avoiding meat. The fact that there are so many vegetarians who are doing so
well and outliving many meat eaters suggests that the diet is a viable option,
even for the person with T1DM who needs a specific balance of carbohy-
drate, protein, and fat.
Handling Eating Disorders
Children, especially girls, are often convinced that they’re too fat, even when
there’s little or no evidence to support it. When the attempt to lose weight
becomes dangerous to the health of the patient, it’s an eating disorder.
Eating disorders take two different forms: anorexia nervosa and bulimia. I
describe the differences in the context of someone with T1DM and provide
sources of help in the following sections.
An eating disorder is particularly dangerous in a child with T1DM because
she tends to reduce or stop her insulin, knowing that insulin is required to
store fat. She can rapidly get into ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4). If you suspect
that your child has an eating disorder, take her to her endocrinologist for a
discussion, and get a recommendation for a therapist who handles eating dis-
orders. They can be very complicated and very dangerous.
146
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Different types of disorders
Both anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders, but they have some differ-
ences. For instance, anorexia involves starvation, and bulimia involves binge-
ing and purging. I explain the signs, complications, and treatment of both
disorders in the following sections.
If you think you or your child has an eating disorder, try answering the ques-
tions at www.dartmouth.edu/~chd/resources/eating/risk.html. You
can quickly rule it in or out with this questionnaire.
Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa is the form of eating disorder in which the patient starves
herself. Her weight is at least 15 percent lower than the appropriate weight
for her height and age either as a result of starvation from a normal weight 
or from never allowing herself to reach a normal weight. She looks in the
mirror and sees fat where others see thin or even starvation.
Anorexia is more common in girls than boys. These girls often get their erro-
neous ideas about body weight from their mothers who are preoccupied with
staying thin. Patients tend to come from middle-class or upper-class families.
They often love to cook, but only for others; they won’t taste the food 
themselves.
One clue that anorexia is present in someone with T1DM is that the person
requires very little insulin because she’s taking in so little food, especially
carbohydrates. In fact, it’s difficult to calculate her insulin needs at all. Other
findings that suggest anorexia are low body temperature and low blood pres-
sure as well as extremely low levels of cholesterol. Girls with anorexia usually
miss several menstrual periods in a row or stop menstruating, and boys with
this disease lose interest in sex.
Anorexia can be fatal. Some of the serious complications include
 Heart failure
 Abnormal heart rhythms
 Fainting
 Bone loss
 Hair loss
 Kidney stones and kidney failure
 Infertility and miscarriages
147
Chapter 8: Eating a Healthy Diet

Patients with anorexia demonstrate some peculiar eating behaviors. They may
 Eat more rapidly than others do
 Skip many meals and make excuses for doing so
 Eat until uncomfortably full
 Eat very few foods and stick to foods that are low in calories
 Weigh themselves often and obsess about tiny changes
 Avoid going to parties where there’s food and avoid buffets
 Eat by themselves because they’re embarrassed
 Feel guilty or disgusted after overeating
First and foremost, treatment for anorexia involves restoring the body weight
to avoid the medical dangers. This sometimes requires hospitalization. Then
there’s a long period of therapy during which the patient restores a healthy
mental picture of her weight. No particular medications are effective, but
antidepressants may be necessary.
Bulimia
Patients with bulimia eat large amounts of food but then induce vomiting and
take enemas to purge the food and lower their weight. Their condition is a
little milder than that of the patient with anorexia; those with bulimia aren’t
as thin as those with anorexia and don’t tend to lose their menstrual periods.
Patients with bulimia also may do excessive amounts of exercise to burn up
all the calories they’re consuming. They’re more likely than anorexic patients
to become obese as adults. Also, they don’t seem to respond to psychologi-
cal therapy as well as those patients either.
Some signs of bulimia include
 Tooth decay from the stomach acids that enter the mouth when the
patient induces vomiting
 Scarring of the hands from putting them in the mouth and rubbing
against the teeth to induce vomiting
 Eating large amounts of food without weight gain
 Dehydration with light-headedness or fainting from the loss of fluids
from inducing vomiting or diarrhea
Otherwise, the signs of bulimia are similar to those of anorexia. The child
with T1DM and bulimia has poor control of the blood glucose as a result of
the irregularity of food intake.
Treatment of bulimia requires psychotherapy as well as drugs such as anti-
depressants to manage the depression that’s often present in the patient.

Chapter 9
Exercising to Improve Control 
of Type 1 Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on the role of exercise in type 1 diabetes
 Planning for safe exercise
 Sticking to the program
T
he fact that your child has type 1 diabetes (also known as T1DM) just
makes it more important that he develops a fitness program that’s part of
his everyday activities, like eating and sleeping. Chapter 6 draws your atten-
tion to world-class athletes who have T1DM, and although the average child
with T1DM isn’t likely to become a world-class athlete, he can certainly use
physical activity not only to help to control diabetes but also to help to live a
long and full life.
The Joslin Diabetes Center has been studying patients with T1DM who have
been taking insulin for 50 years or more. In an article in the August 2007 issue
of Diabetes Care, the center looked at the “clinical factors associated with
resistance to microvascular (eyes, kidneys, nervous system) complications in
diabetic patients of extreme duration.” They concluded that “exercise was
associated with reduced microvascular complications” and “exercise may be
an important protective factor.” In other words, despite 50 years of taking
insulin for T1DM, these people don’t have those complications.
Everyone should exercise regularly, not just people with diabetes. In this
chapter, you find out why exercise is important in T1DM, how you can get
started and get your child started, and what exercise may be best for you
both. Stop finding excuses and begin enjoying the body that carries around
your brain and heart!
The Diabetes Exercise and Sports Association is an organization that you can
turn to for help, instruction, and friendship as you add exercise to your child’s
good diabetes care. Check out the organization’s Web site at www.diabetes-
exercise.org/index.asp or call 800-898-4322. They know all about 
diabetes and sports and are eager to share the information with you.

The Benefits of Exercise for People 
with Type 1 Diabetes
Although it doesn’t normalize the blood glucose or lower the hemoglobin A1c
in T1DM, exercise has several very important functions that are essential to a
healthy body. They include:
 Preventing heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease:
People with T1DM usually die of cardiovascular disease due to arterioscle-
rosis (narrowing of the arteries). Exercise reduces the frequency of all
forms of arteriosclerosis by increasing good cholesterol (HDL), decreasing
bad cholesterol (LDL), making the heart more efficient, and improving
lung function.
 Controlling the blood glucose more easily: When a person with T1DM
exercises, his insulin sensitivity increases. This means that less insulin is
needed to handle the carbohydrates he consumes. This increased sensi-
tivity can last for 24 hours after exercise. In my practice, the people who
take the least total daily insulin are the heavy exercisers. They also tend
to be in excellent diabetic control with low hemoglobin A1c levels.
Increased insulin sensitivity means that a person with T1DM may be
prone to nighttime hypoglycemia if he doesn’t eat a bedtime snack after
exercise and doesn’t reduce his pre-exercise insulin. See Chapter 4 for
more about hypoglycemia.
Some additional benefits of exercise for patients with T1DM include
 Lower blood pressure
 Easier loss of weight and weight maintenance
152
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 
The skinny on how exercise affects glucose
In order for muscles to have energy for either mod-
erate or vigorous exercise, they have to store glu-
cose that’s ready for use. As vigorous exercise like
heavy weight lifting begins, the muscles rapidly use
up their stored glucose. Then the liver is turned on
to release its stores of glucose and to produce large
amounts by converting protein into glucose. The
liver can sometimes make so much glucose that the
blood glucose is temporarily higher after exercise
than before. This extra glucose is quickly taken up
by the depleted muscles to restore their glucose.
In the case of moderate exercise, however, after the
glucose in muscles is used up, the muscles begin to
use fat for energy. This arrangement works well
because there are more kilocalories of energy in fat
than in glucose (a carbohydrate) and because fat
turns into energy much more slowly than does glu-
cose. As fat is burned up for energy, there’s less fat
available to cause arteriosclerosis. More HDL
(good) cholesterol is formed to reduce the risk of a
heart attack.

 Stronger bones
 Lower rates of heart disease and cancer
 More energy
 Greater libido
 Increased mental ability
You may think that kids with T1DM don’t have to worry about blood pres-
sure, weight maintenance, strong bones, and heart disease, but the earlier
they develop good exercise habits, the greater the chances that they’ll stick
with their routine for the long haul and live full, healthy lives.
Taking Care Before Starting 
an Exercise Program
You should do a few things to prepare your child for an exercise program.
Obviously, having the right clothes and sneakers is important. If your child is
newly diagnosed with T1DM, there’s no concern about making complications
worse with exercise, but if the diabetes has been present for more than five
years, make sure that his eyes are in good shape by having an eye examination.
Other than that, you’re both ready to get moving.
Talking to the doctor
Your child with T1DM can do any exercise he prefers (as you find out later in
this chapter). As an adult with T1DM, though, you should probably see your
doctor before beginning a vigorous exercise program, especially if T1DM has
been present ten years or more. You also should schedule a doctor’s visit
before starting vigorous exercise
 If you already have a complication of diabetes (like those in Chapter 5)
 If you’re obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more
 If you have a physical limitation
 If you already have coronary artery disease or elevated blood pressure
 If you use medications daily
You may also want to talk to a dietitian about getting good nutrition before
and during exercise to avoid hypoglycemia.

Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

Deciding to devote an hour each day
The amount of aerobic exercise that you do depends upon your goal.
 For very good physical fitness and stamina, 30 minutes of daily aerobic
exercise such as walking, jogging, tennis, squash, swimming, and cycling
does the job.
 For weight maintenance, one hour of exercise a day takes care of you.
 For actual weight loss, 90 minutes a day is necessary.
In 2002, the Institute of Medicine recommended at least one hour of exercise
daily for good health and weight. This was based on numerous studies of the
effects of exercise on health. This amount shouldn’t be taken as an upper
limit, though. If you want to do more, that’s fine, but don’t do less. An hour
(not an apple) a day keeps the doctor away!
When I ask patients to do an hour of exercise a day, one of the most common
replies that I get is, “I can’t find the time.” One way to find time is to keep a 
log of how you spend your time every day. When I ask my patients to do that,
they’re amazed at how much time is actually available. You may have to give
up a little television viewing or shorten your lunch and walk instead. If you like
to read, consider picking up audio books that let you get out and walk as 
you “read.”
Determining how hard to exercise
Simple exercise for one person may be very hard exercise for another person.
When I first ask patients to consider walking 10,000 steps a day (I recommend
this exercise later in this chapter), most of them look at me as though I’m
crazy. Yet when they get up to that level, they realize that it isn’t nearly as dif-
ficult as they imagined. Push yourself to the place where you’re about to be
out of breath, and you’ll be doing moderate exercise.
The Perceived Exertion Scale is very useful in determining whether an activ-
ity is making a difference in your fitness (or your child’s). To use the scale,
you rate the degree of your exertion while performing a certain activity from
extremely light to extremely hard, according to your personal physical ability
level. Here’s the scale:
 Extremely light exercise is very easy to do and requires little or no
exertion.
 Very light exercise is like walking slowly for several minutes.
 Light exercise is like walking faster but at a pace you can continue 
without effort.
154
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 Somewhat hard exercise is getting a little difficult but still feels okay to
continue.
 Very hard exercise is difficult to continue. You have to push yourself,
and you’re very tired. At this level, you have trouble talking. The very
hard level of exercise is most beneficial.
 Extremely hard exercise is the most difficult exercise you’ve ever done.
To find out more about the Perceived Exertion Scale, go to www.cdc.gov/
nccdphp/dnpa/physical/measuring/perceived_exertion.htm.
Adjusting insulin usage and 
following other precautions
Exercising when you have T1DM requires a lot more careful thought than
exercising when you have type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The reason is, of course,
that in T2DM you have insulin in your body that can rise and fall according to
the needs of your cells, especially your muscles. In T1DM, however, the only
insulin you have is what you take by injection or by inhalation. There are a
number of things you must consider when exercising with T1DM:
 Where you inject the insulin: Insulin taken in the thigh just before a run
is absorbed much more quickly than if it were injected in the stomach,
for example. Avoid the thigh just before exercise so that you don’t
become hypoglycemic early in the exercise.
 How much insulin you take: There has to be some insulin in your body
for your muscle cells to take up glucose, but if there’s too much, you
may become hypoglycemic during the exercise and be unable to con-
tinue. If there’s too little insulin in your system, your muscles may not
get enough glucose, and you’ll rapidly become fatigued.
 When you take the insulin in relation to the time of the exercise and
the time of the last meal: You can usually begin exercising starting one
hour after taking rapid-acting, pre-meal insulin.
 The type of insulin you take: If you take short-acting insulin called regular
insulin, it doesn’t lower the blood glucose as much or as rapidly as rapid-
acting insulin called Apidra, Humalog, or Novolog (see Chapter 10). For
this reason, you may want to use regular insulin before strenuous exercise
rather than the rapid-acting form.
Make sure your child with T1DM (or you) follows these additional precautions
when he (or you) actually exercises:
 Wears a bracelet or necklace identifying himself as a person with T1DM
 Checks his blood glucose frequently (every hour) if the exercise lasts
more than two hours
155
Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

 Chooses proper socks and shoes
 Drinks plenty of water as he feels thirsty
 Has a source of rapid-acting glucose available for hypoglycemia
 Exercises with a friend
Developing (And Sticking 
to) an Exercise Plan
People with T1DM should do two types of exercise, aerobic and anaerobic
exercise.
 Aerobic exercise is moderate exercise done for a long duration; it
improves heart and lung function and strengthens your muscles. Aerobic
refers to the fact that the body has time during the exercise to combine
oxygen with glucose to produce energy.
 Anaerobic exercise is a short burst of exercise during which glucose 
is used without oxygen. It’s much less efficient and is too intense to be
sustained. Anaerobic exercise increases muscle strength and stamina.
Whereas running is aerobic exercise, sprinting is anaerobic exercise.
Lifting 10 pounds repeatedly is aerobic exercise, and lifting 125 pounds
once is anaerobic exercise.
In the following sections, I explain how to incorporate both of these types of
exercise into your child’s (or your own) program; I start with aerobic activity
and finish with a great method for anaerobic exercise: weight training.
You probably wonder how long you can go without exercise before you begin
to lose all the conditioning you’ve accomplished. The answer is only two to
three weeks. That’s a good reason to continue to do something every day.
Encouraging exercise at all ages
You’ll probably be surprised to hear that exercise should begin with your
newborn. Although T1DM doesn’t usually begin at this age, starting a child’s
exercise at such a young age makes it easier to progress his exercise regimen
throughout childhood, adding more time and new tasks, than to suddenly
impose an exercise regimen at some later stage. In the following sections, you
discover what you and your child should do at each stage to make (and keep)
exercise a priority.

 The President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports has a Web site at
www.fitness.gov where you can find out about its work to improve
physical fitness and connect to a large number of other resources on the
Internet. The site also has a page of Physical Activity Facts. Among them
are the following:
• Children and teens need 60 minutes of activity a day for their health.
• Physically inactive people are twice as likely to develop coronary
heart disease as regularly active people.
• Only three in ten adults get the recommended amount of physical
activity, which is at least 30 minutes of activity five or more days a
week.
• One-quarter of children in the U.S. spend four hours or more a day
watching television.
Newborns and toddlers
Infants go through great physical changes in the first year of life, tripling their
birth weight and gaining about 9 inches in length. They’re born with undevel-
oped muscles and spend the first year building up their muscle mass so that
they can grasp objects and ultimately stand up and walk.
During this first year, infants also are building up the neurological connec-
tions that allow them to move their muscles in a coordinated fashion. For
example, you can stimulate your infant to turn over or to move by putting
objects just out of reach. You also can stimulate him to reach out by hanging
a mobile over his crib.
To make sure that your infant develops strong muscles to hold up that head
and build up those arms, you can
 Take time to play with your infant every day for 30 minutes to one hour.
 Encourage siblings and grandparents (as if they needed it) to play with
your baby.
 Provide safe objects and toys for the baby to play with.
 Let the baby watch as you exercise to encourage imitation.
 See if your local sports club has a parent-infant program. If not, tell them
to start one.
157
Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

Preschoolers
By 2 years of age, a child weighs four times his birth weight and grows 21⁄2 to
31⁄2 inches per year from age 2 to 5. The preschooler’s muscles and nervous
system are growing and developing. His vision is improving, but his eye
movements limit his ability to follow moving objects. The child’s balance is
improving, and he’s learning all the time. From age 1 to 2, he’s running; by 3,
he’s jumping; and by 5, he can skip.
There’s much you can do to encourage daily exercise for your youngster (and
keep it safe). Here are a few suggestions:
 Play simple games like Hide and Seek or Simon Says with him.
 Supervise the child during play.
 Make sure he uses safety equipment, like a helmet.
 Provide balls for him to throw, kick, and catch.
 Provide a tricycle so that he can start to learn to ride a bike.
 Provide devices to improve balance and climbing, like playground 
equipment.
 Sign him up for classes in tumbling, dancing, or gymnastics.
 Protect his skin from sun exposure.
Primary school children and preteens
Young children and preteens gain 7 pounds of weight and 21⁄2 inches of height
per year. There’s significant increase in motor skills, strength, and stamina,
so the child can begin to participate in competitive sports. This is a very
important time in the development of a lifelong interest in physical activity.
Exercise with your child regularly and also on your own. Your child will
follow your example, especially when he’s young. The best way to share your
exercise time is to select an activity that you can both enjoy together. Begin
at the earliest age possible by pushing him for a good long walk in his stroller.
As he begins to walk, let him hold onto the stroller as you walk together.
When he has his balance, walk together with him. Keep emphasizing that
exercise is for a lifetime.
Fortunately, most small children love to run around; you may be hard-pressed
to keep up with your youngster after a while. However, there will come a time
when television and the Internet become very attractive distractions for him.
It’s important that you continue to set an example by exercising yourself, but
you also have to place limits on the amount of time your child spends in such
sedentary inactivity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no
more than one to two hours a day of quality programming.
158
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

You can really emphasize the importance of exercise to your child while getting
more of it for yourself and your child. Here are a few tricks to sneak in more
exercise:
 Walk to shops and markets whenever possible. If it’s too far to walk all
the way, drive partway, park, and then walk to your destination.
 When you go to a store, park at the farthest end of a parking lot from 
the door.
 If you travel by public transportation, walk to and from the station if
possible.
 When you travel, look into walking tours available at your destination.
(You can usually find books or Web sites with such information.) Take
the tours, and you’re sure to see much more.
 Take the stairs.
 Get pedometers for you and your child, and see who can record more
steps in a day. Be sure to reward your child for winning. (See the section
“A good pick for everyone: Walking 10,000 steps a day.”)
In addition, you can really help your child by doing some or all of the following:
 Make sure that his school has a daily break for physical education.
 Introduce him to a variety of physical activities, and encourage him to
join teams (see the later section “Competing against others”).
 Provide positive roles models for sports.
 Introduce the idea of weight or strength training with light weights.
Adolescents
Puberty is a time of peak growth similar to the first year of life. The adolescent
gains the last fifth of his height and 50 percent of his adult weight. Strength
greatly increases, especially if he does strength-training exercises. Girls have
their pubertal growth spurt earlier than boys, but boys experience a longer
growth period and are taller on average at the end of growth. The percentage
of body fat in boys remains about the same but significantly increases in girls,
sometimes leading to the eating disorders described in Chapter 8.
Adolescents are much more able to think logically. They’re more aware of the
future and the consequences of their behavior, so they can understand the
importance of physical activity to a much greater degree.
This is a time of continued promotion of exercise not just by parents but by
many others in the adolescent’s environment.
159
Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

 If the child is willing, you should continue to exercise with him, especially
if you can make it fun and even competitive. For example, this may be the
time when your child beats you in tennis for the first time, an important
milestone.
 School physical exercise programs should be available to every student,
not just the ones who want to participate in after-school competitive
sports.
 Physical activities that include socialization, like dancing, encourage
your child to want to participate.
 Vacations with lots of physical activity such as biking or walking continue
the active tradition.
 It may be more difficult to limit your child’s sedentary activities, but you
must give it all you’ve got. After all, it’s what’s best for your child.
If you want to see how your child stacks up against many others, have him 
perform the President’s Challenge Physical Fitness Test, which you can find
online at www.presidentschallenge.org/educators/program_
details/physical_fitness/events.aspx. For the test, your child 
performs five exercises, and you compare his results with the results accom-
plished by a large school population (last measured, unfortunately, in 1985).
Your child receives a Presidential Physical Fitness Award if he scores in the
85th percentile compared to the national standard. Perform the test every six
months to best track your child’s physical fitness progress.
As your child gets older and takes more control over his physical activity, he
may develop some behaviors that complicate his T1DM. Minimize the risk of
dangerous behavior by
 Discussing the negative effects of substance abuse on the child’s physical
state as well as his diabetes
 Discouraging the use of performance-enhancing drugs
Choosing an activity
Choosing a specific activity for exercise requires some thought. It’s best to do
several different activities that use different muscles, and it can get boring
doing the same thing day after day. Here are some points to keep in mind
when choosing a physical activity, either for yourself or your child:
 Some people prefer a team sport, whereas others prefer a solitary sport.
 Some people like competition, and others just like to improve their own
performance.
160
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 Some people like to be very tired at the end of a workout, whereas
others like to take it a little easier.
 Climate is a factor in the choice of physical activities. If you live in a 
climate that’s warm year-round, you can pretty much do anything out-
doors at any time. In contrast, winter weather may send you indoors and
help determine what activities you can do. You may want to do one
sport during the warm summer months and another when you have to
be inside.
 Decide what you want to get out of the exercise: fitness, flexibility, or
weight loss (or all three).
Table 9-1 shows you how each exercise can improve the body. Choose the
one that accomplishes what you (or your child) need from physical activity.
Table 9-1
Match Your Activity to the Results You Want
If You Want to . . .
Then Consider . . .
Build up cardiovascular condition
Vigorous basketball, racquetball, squash,
cross-country skiing, handball
Strengthen your body
Weight lifting (low weight and high repetition),
gymnastics, mountain climbing, cross-country

Build up muscular endurance
Gymnastics, rowing, cross-country skiing,
vigorous basketball
Increase flexibility
Gymnastics, judo, karate, soccer, surfing
Control body fat
Handball, racquetball, squash, cross-country

You and your child can choose any one or more of the activities in Table 9-1
that meets your goals. Unless you have an illness or have never exercised
before, or your child has a complication of diabetes, feel free to do what you
and your child enjoy.
If you’re an adult patient, consider your current physical state when you
choose your exercise. Here are some complications (which I describe in
Chapter 5) and how they limit may your choices:
 Diabetic retinopathy should prevent you from doing exercises that
increase your blood pressure. Anaerobic weight lifting is in that category.
Bouncing exercises also aren’t good for damaged eyes, and you should
avoid underwater diving like scuba, which increases the pressure in 
your eyes.
161
Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

 Nephropathy (kidney damage) is made worse by uncontrolled high blood
pressure, which can accompany any prolonged, high-intensity exercise,
such as a triathlon or marathon. You can find out if such activities put you
at risk by measuring your blood pressure several times during the exer-
cise. Trying something once doesn’t damage you more, particularly if you
check to see if the exercise causes an increase in BP, which it may not.
 Chest pain at rest certainly prevents you from doing any exercise
because it gets worse with exertion and you run the risk of a heart
attack. Get it cleared up with your doctor before you undertake any form
of exercise, or you may be meeting with the undertaker next.
Competing against others
If your child with T1DM wants to compete against others (or if you’re an
adult interested in competitive sports), he should be permitted to do so.
Chapter 6 shows you that there are many world-class athletes who have
T1DM. So if it’s your child’s goal to join in on competitive sports, you and he
need to make several important changes to his diet and insulin program.
Here are some suggestions for making his competition not only fun but safe:
 Check with his doctor before he starts playing, and work with a dietitian
and sports physiologist who know how people with T1DM can compete
successfully.
 Make sure he’s well prepared as far as training is concerned.
 He should plan to test his blood glucose very frequently during the com-
petition, as often as every 30 minutes. He may want to wear a continu-
ous glucose monitor (see Chapter 7) so that you both can see how his
glucose trends during play.
 Test his glucose several times in the hours after he competes. The
exercise will make him very sensitive to the insulin and prone to
hypoglycemia.
 Follow the nutrition guidelines for any competitive sport: Have him load
up with carbohydrates for a few days before the competition so that
there’s plenty of stored energy in his muscles and liver. He also should
be prepared to consume more carbohydrates throughout the competi-
tion at regular intervals.
 Should he become hypoglycemic, he shouldn’t hesitate to stop and treat
it. Not finishing is not the worst thing that can happen. Allowing his
body to be damaged because he can’t think clearly is. There will be
many more competitions.
162
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

A good pick for everyone: Walking 
10,000 steps a day
The great thing about walking is that just about anyone without a physical
limitation can do it — and enjoy it, particularly if you’re lucky enough to have
a beautiful park or path nearby. If you throw in a little uphill walking, you ben-
efit even more.
You and your child need a way to count your steps. Enter the pedometer, a little
device worn on your belt that adds a step every time you do (see Figure 9-1).
Some fancy pedometers are able to convert your steps into miles after you
enter into the pedometer the distance you go with each step, but you really
don’t need more than a step counter.
If your pedometer doesn’t keep track of mileage, you can do the math to
figure it out yourself. Just multiply your stride length (the distance you go
each time you take a step) in feet by the number of steps you took to get your
total distance in feet. Divide that by 5,280 to get your miles. If you walk about
a foot each time you step, you go about 2 miles every 10,000 steps. This is a
good goal for children older than 12 and adults. Younger children between
ages 8 and 12 may set 5,000 steps; children younger than 8 should be encour-
aged to just keep beating their previous daily average.
Accusplit pedometers work very well. The model I like is the Accusplit 
Eagle, which does nothing but record your steps. You can find it at www.
accusplit.com/product.html. You also can find pedometers at sporting
goods stores.
Figure 9-1:
A

take.
163
Chapter 9: Exercising to Improve Control of Type 1 Diabetes

Here’s how you and your child can use your pedometers to get up to 10,000
steps a day:
 Record your daily step count for a week. Remember to reset the steps
after you have your daily total. Divide your seven-day step total by seven
to get your average number of daily steps. Then try to add 500 steps to
your daily total, and don’t go to a higher level until you have seven days
of 500 more. Once your average is 500 higher, move up another 500.
 Walk, don’t ride, whenever you possibly can.
 Choose some favorite walks, and count the steps to complete each one.
When you need a certain number of steps, select the walk that will give
you that number.
 Use stairs instead of the elevator, whether you’re going up or down.
Although affordable and accurate, a pedometer isn’t essential to keep track of
your steps. If you prefer not to use one, use these average conversions to get
up to 10K (10,000) steps a day:
 1 mile = 2,100 average steps
 1 block = 100 average steps
 10 minutes walking = 1,200 steps on average
 Biking or swimming = 150 steps per minute
 Weight lifting = 100 steps per minute
 Roller skating = 200 steps per minute
Training with weights
In addition to exercises for cardiovascular fitness, encourage your child to lift
weights. Have him select lighter weights that he can lift repetitively. This is
called weight training. (He should avoid very heavy weight lifting, which is
anaerobic; refer to the earlier section “Developing (And Sticking to) an
Exercise Plan” for an explanation of aerobic versus anaerobic exercise.)
Weight training improves muscle strength. The exercises I recommend in this
section work his upper body muscles, which are neglected with most aerobic
exercises that involve only his legs.
Your child’s choices of exercises are numerous. I like seven specific upper body
exercises because they get most of the different arm muscles. These exercises
are the bicep curl, shoulder press, lateral raise, bent-over rowing, good morn-
ings, flys, and pullovers. (I like these exercises for adults with T1DM, too.)
164
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Anyone attempting these exercises, which I describe in the following sections,
should choose weights that allow them to do three sets of ten exercises with a
rest in between each set.
To try some other weight-training exercises, see the book Weight Training For
Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Liz Neporent, Suzanne Schlossberg, and Shirley
Archer (Wiley). You also can consult an exercise trainer in a fitness club to
find out how to do these exercises and others safely.

nsulin is the key substance that every patient with type 1 diabetes (T1DM)
must take in order to live. The day it was successfully extracted by Dr.
Frederick Banting and his assistant Charles Best in 1921 marks the great divide
between the days of certain death for every person with T1DM and greatly
extended life. In a matter of days after receiving the first insulin shots, weak,
emaciated children were able to stand, eat normally, and look forward to many
more years of life. But it turned out that there was still one small problem.
Beginning around ten or more years after developing T1DM and starting on
insulin, many patients were found to have one or more of several long-term
complications of diabetes as described in Chapter 5. Controversy grew as to
why this was happening until the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
was published in 1993. That study confirmed that the complications were
caused by levels of blood glucose that were too high over many years. The
study also indicated that the long-term complications could be prevented by
keeping the blood glucose as close to the normal range as possible.
The story of insulin since 1993 has been about finding ways to keep the blood
glucose normal by balancing food intake and exercise with consistent insulin
administration. In this chapter, you find out how you can administer it either
to your child or yourself to successfully prevent both short-term (see
Chapter 4) and long-term complications of diabetes. (Head to Chapter 11 for
details on an exciting new method of delivering insulin: the pump.)

The Purpose and Types of Insulin
So you know that your child needs insulin (or you need it yourself), but do
you know anything about what it does in the body and the types of external
insulin available for patients with diabetes? Fear not; I explain what you need
to know in the following sections.
What does insulin do?
Insulin is a hormone, a chemical that’s made in one organ of the body — in this
case, the pancreas — and travels throughout the body via the bloodstream
performing its task. Insulin’s task is to permit the entrance of glucose (the sugar
in the blood that provides energy) into the cells of the body, especially muscle
and liver cells.
Think of your insulin as an insurance agent who lives in San Francisco (which
is your pancreas) but travels from there to do business in Seattle (your mus-
cles), Denver (your fat tissue), Los Angeles (your liver), and other places. This
insulin insurance agent is insuring your good health.
Wherever insulin travels in your body, it opens up the cells so that glucose can
enter them. After glucose enters them, the cells immediately use it for energy,
store it in a storage form of glucose (called glycogen) for rapid use later on, or
convert it to fat for use even later as energy.
After glucose leaves your blood and enters your cells, your blood glucose
level falls. Your pancreas can tell when your glucose is falling, and it turns off
the release of insulin to prevent unhealthy low levels of blood glucose called
hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4). At the same time, your liver begins to release
glucose from storage and makes new glucose from amino acids in your blood
to raise the level again.
If your insurance agent (insulin, remember? — stick with me here!) doesn’t
show up when you need him (meaning that you have an absence of insulin, 
as in type 1 diabetes), your insurance coverage may be very poor (in which
case your blood glucose starts to climb). In other words, a lack of insulin
means that glucose in the blood isn’t allowed to enter cells in the body, and
the amount of glucose in the blood rises to an unhealthy level. High blood
glucose is the beginning of all your problems. (Flip to Chapter 2 for more
information about the overall role of insulin in type 1 diabetes.)
If all insulin did was permit glucose to enter cells, that would be enough. But
insulin has a number of other actions. These include the following:
172
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 Uptake of amino acids by cells. Amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins, and proteins make up muscle.
 Conversion of glucose into glycogen, its storage form in muscle and 
the liver.
 Synthesis of fat in fat cells, the liver, and muscle for further storage of
energy.
 Regulation of the growth of beta cells, in which insulin is made, as well
as protection of the beta cells from death.
 Regulation of the release of insulin from the beta cells. It does this by
allowing glucose to enter the beta cell, where it stimulates the release 
of more insulin.
 Synthesis of DNA, the building blocks of chromosomes, which carry
genetic material.
Is insulin important? This list of essential actions leaves little doubt about that.
What are the different types 
of external insulin?
The person with T1DM is entirely dependent upon an external source of
insulin. Since it was originally extracted from the pancreas of fetal calves in
1921, scientists have attempted to alter external insulin’s activity so that it
can duplicate the activity of native insulin, the insulin in the bodies of people
who don’t have T1DM. And researchers have come pretty close to that goal.
External insulin comes in several forms, and each one has a different purpose:
 Rapid-acting insulin: Taken before a meal to control the carbohydrate in
that meal
 Regular insulin: An earlier form of pre-meal insulin that’s active longer
 Intermediate insulin: Has activity for 12 hours and therefore is given
twice a day to act as a basal insulin
 Long-acting insulin: Has activity for 24 hours and therefore is ideal as a
basal insulin
 Insulin mixture: Combines the actions of the two insulins that are mixed
Table 10-1 shows all the different kinds of insulin that are currently available
along with the amount of time that passes between taking them and their onset
of action as well as the peak and duration of activity.

Make sure you get exactly the same brand and type of insulin each time (for
yourself or for your child). There are small differences even in the insulins
that are grouped together as the same type. To make sure you’re getting the
right insulin, Table 10-2 lists the brand names for the types listed in Table 10-1.

The Details of Insulin Doses
When your child takes insulin (or you do), the objective is to duplicate the
secretion of insulin by the normal pancreas. This secretion has two parts:
 Under normal circumstances, there’s usually a small amount of insulin
called the basal secretion circulating in the blood at all times. This amount
can be duplicated in a patient with T1DM by taking either long-acting
glargine or detemir insulin. (The other way of getting a small amount of
insulin constantly is with an insulin pump, a relatively new technique that
I describe in Chapter 11.)
 The pancreas secretes a larger amount of insulin at the time of the meals
called the bolus secretion. This amount is duplicated by taking rapid-
acting insulin (like aspart, glulisine, or lispro) just before the meal or
regular insulin 30 minutes before meals. These days, the convenience 
of taking insulin just at the time your child is eating results in more fre-
quent use of rapid-acting insulin.
Insulin is manufactured in strengths of 100 units per milliliter. The first time 
a patient takes insulin, the dosage is based upon a calculated total daily dose
consisting of a basal dose and a bolus dose. Your child’s doctor will make this
determination, but he’ll usually follow these steps:
1. Multiply the weight of the patient in kilograms by 0.3.
For example, a 35-kg patient requires 10.5 units of insulin per day, or
approximately 10 units.
2. Divide the total daily dose into the basal dose and the bolus doses by
simply dividing it in half.
So 5 units is used as the basal dose and 5 units as the bolus dose.
Your child takes the basal dose and the bolus dose at different times of day.
 The basal dose is taken once or is sometimes split into two times a day,
usually in the morning and/or at bedtime. I like to divide the basal dose
into a large number of units in the morning and a few units at bedtime. In
this case, I would use 4 units in the morning and 1 unit at night.
 The bolus dose is taken before meals. It’s divided up so that 40 percent
is taken before breakfast, 20 percent before lunch, and 40 percent before
supper. In this case, that would be 2 units, 1 unit, and 2 units.
The final determination of the insulin dose your child (or you) takes at any
given time is usually based upon trial and error. Your child takes a specific
dose of insulin and you check his blood glucose for the result (see Chapter 7
for full details on measuring blood glucose). If the glucose is high, he takes an
extra unit next time. If the glucose is low, you reduce the insulin dose by a
175
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

unit next time. A calculation like the one in the preceding list is approximate
but a good starting point. After the initial dose is determined, it can be
adjusted in order to achieve the levels of blood glucose shown in Table 10-3.
These levels are for children and adults.

In the following sections, I explain the considerations you should make when
calculating the bolus and basal doses for yourself or your child.
The dosing information that I present in this chapter is approximate; no
matter what type of insulin you or your child takes, be sure to get a dosing
plan from your doctor and ask questions.
Calculating the bolus dose
Three major factors must be taken into account in determining the final bolus
dose of insulin necessary to reach the goals in Table 10-3, based on the initial
bolus dose that I show you how to calculate earlier in this chapter:
 The level of the blood glucose before a meal
 The amount of carbohydrate about to be consumed
 Whether exercise has been or is about to be done
The level of the blood glucose before a meal
The blood glucose level before a meal must be measured with a glucose
meter (see Chapter 7). Because the goal is a blood glucose of about 100 to
120 mg/dl after the meal, the question is how much extra insulin to take to
get there based upon the before-meal blood glucose. You add units of insulin
if the pre-meal blood glucose is higher than the ideal, and you decrease units
of insulin if the pre-meal blood glucose is lower than the ideal.
176
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

One way to do this is with the rule of 1500. Divide 1500 by the total daily
dose, in this case 10 units, and the result is 150. That’s approximately how
many milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) 1 unit of insulin will lower the blood
glucose. If the glucose before the meal is 250 mg/dl and the goal is 100 mg/dl,
the excess is 150 mg/dl. Dividing 150 by 150 gives 1, which is the number of
units you must add to the current bolus dose to achieve a level of 100 mg/dl
after the meal. On the other hand, if glucose before the meal is 70 mg/dl, you
want to subtract 1 unit from the bolus dose to get to 100 mg/dl after the meal.
Some patients, especially thin ones, find that 1 unit of insulin can bring the
blood glucose down by more than 150 mg/dl. Others find that 1 unit only
brings the glucose down 75 mg/dl. This fine-tuning permits you and your
child to achieve your goal of excellent glucose control.
The amount of carbohydrate about to be consumed
In order to adjust the insulin dose before the meal to take into account the
amount of carbohydrate to be consumed, you must know how much carbohy-
drate your child is about to eat. Chapter 8 contains an extensive discussion of
carbohydrate counting. You can only adjust your child’s bolus insulin for the
carbohydrates in the meal if you know how many there are.
The amount of adjustment varies for different people at different ages. One
person may find that he can handle 15 grams of carbohydrate with 1 unit of
insulin, whereas another may need 1 unit for every 20 grams of carbohydrate.
Again, this is a matter of trial and error. If your child starts with a blood glucose
around 100 mg/dl before a meal and consumes 45 grams of carbohydrate, you
can figure out how to adjust for the carbohydrate at the next meal based on
the glucose level an hour after the meal.
You may find that the amount of insulin that covers your child’s carbohydrate
intake differs at different meals. At breakfast, because of all the hormones from
overnight that tend to raise glucose, he may need 1 unit for 10 grams, but at
lunch, 1 unit may control 15 grams. Suppose he takes an extra 3 units of the
bolus dose at dinner for the 45 grams of carbohydrate based on 1 unit per 15
grams. If his blood glucose after the meal is 140, he may try taking four extra
units based on a ratio of 1 unit to 10 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast the
next day.
The effect of exercise
Exercise generally lowers the blood glucose (but not always). If your child
exercises but doesn’t have enough insulin in his blood, the glucose can rise,
sometimes to high levels.
Chapter 9 offers a number of suggestions for including exercise in your
child’s life (and yours too!). Here are a few other recommendations in regard
to bolus insulin:
177
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

 Check blood glucose just before your child exercises. If exercise is 
prolonged for several hours, check every hour.
 Try to maintain a blood glucose of about 150 mg/dl during exercise.
 Take glucose in the form of three to four glucose tablets if the blood 
glucose falls below 100 mg/dl.
 Take rapid-acting insulin and wait to exercise if the blood glucose is 
over 300 mg/dl.
 Take half the usual dose before a meal before exercise if the blood 
glucose is satisfactory.
 Try to exercise around the same time each day.
As your child trains more, his blood glucose will tend to remain more stable
during exercise.
Adjusting the basal dose
At what point do you adjust your child’s basal insulin? The following adjust-
ments are best done in consultation with your child’s doctor. However, if you’re
unable to see the doctor, you can put your knowledge to use and make the
adjustments on your own.
 Bedtime basal insulin: If you find that several mornings in a row your
child’s fasting blood glucose is too high (above the levels in Table 10-3),
you may add a unit or two to his bedtime basal insulin. If it’s too low,
you may reduce his bedtime basal insulin by a unit or two or get him to
eat a small bedtime snack.
 Morning basal insulin: A high blood glucose level throughout the day is
an indication to raise the morning basal insulin by 1 or 2 units. Getting
hypoglycemia at different times of day is a reason to lower the morning
basal by 1 or 2 units.
Several weeks after starting insulin, you may find that you can lower your
child’s dose (of both bolus and basal insulin) more and more and even go off
it for as long as six months. This is the honeymoon phase. It’s a period of
remission when the insulin in his pancreas is controlling the glucose. He may
need little or no insulin for this period, but there usually comes a time when
he has to start insulin again. It’s extremely important to measure your child’s
glucose frequently so you know when to reestablish the insulin.
Injecting Insulin
Many companies have extended an enormous amount of effort to make
taking insulin as painless and convenient as possible. The following sections
178
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

present a large number of tools available to you, but the information here is
by no means exhaustive. New devices are coming on the market almost daily.
Before you begin: Selecting 
an injection site
Figure 10-1 shows the various sites that you can use to inject insulin into your
child, including the abdomen, the legs, and the hips/buttocks. For all injection
methods, you can wipe the area with alcohol, but it’s not necessary (and some
may be pulled in with the needle, causing pain). If necessary, your child can
even take an injection through his clothes.
Need help in picking an injection site? Some variables that determine the
speed of uptake of the insulin are the following:
 Where the insulin is injected: Uptake from the abdomen is fastest, 
followed by the arms and legs, and then the buttocks. If your child’s
blood glucose is high, inject in the abdomen so that the insulin is taken
up rapidly.

179
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

 Whether your child exercises: Injecting into his leg when he’s about to
move speeds uptake.
 Use of the same site: Uptake slows when the same site is used repeatedly.
Rotate sites.
 The depth of the shot: The deeper the shot at the site, the faster the
insulin is taken up. You can use this knowledge to slow down the onset
of the insulin when your child isn’t eating immediately or is eating low-
glycemic foods (see Chapter 8 for more about these types of foods).
Syringes and needles
More and more, people are using insulin pens to administer their insulin 
(I discuss these devices later in this chapter). Compared to a syringe and
needle, the pen is just more convenient and easier to determine the correct
dose. However, you and your child still need to know how to measure and
deliver insulin with a syringe and needle (the oldest and still most common
method for delivering insulin) in case you run out of pens or pen refills.
Numerous different brands of syringes and needles are available. Here are
some of their common features:
 Syringes come in sizes of 1 ml (100 units), 0.5 ml (50 units), and 0.3 ml
(30 units). Disposable syringes may be reused as long as the needle
remains sharp.
If you’re using less than 30 units of insulin for all shots, the 0.3 ml
syringe is easiest to use. If you use more than 30 but less than 50 units,
the 0.5 ml syringe is best.
 Needle size is either 1⁄2 inch or 5⁄16 inch. Children usually use the shorter
needle.
 Needle gauge is 28, 29, 30, or 31. The higher the number, the thinner the
needle. The thinner needles are less painful and are preferred for children
and adults alike.
 Packages contain 100 needles and syringes already connected.
The syringe shown in Figure 10-2 is a 1-ml syringe that can hold a maximum of
100 units of any insulin. There are ten longer lines along the barrel that mark
the syringe each time ten more units of insulin are added and that read 10, 20,
30, and so forth. Between the longer ten lines are ten shorter lines representing
1 unit each. At the fifth unit, the line is longer than the 1-unit line but shorter
than the 10-unit line.
180
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

The bottle in Figure 10-2 is a typical bottle of insulin. When it’s new, the top is
covered by an aluminum cap that you break off and discard when using the
insulin. Under the cap is a rubber stopper through which you push the needle
to obtain the insulin. The stopper neatly seals itself when the needle is
removed.
Every bottle of insulin has an expiration date on it. You can keep it in the
refrigerator until that expiration date, and then discard it. You can have it at
room temperature for four weeks before the expiration date, but then you
must obtain new insulin. Insulin that has been stored at temperatures above
86 degrees F loses its potency; you can still use it, but discard it as soon as
you can get new insulin. Insulin that has been frozen should be discarded.
Taking (or giving) a shot
If the insulin is rapid-acting or regular, it should be clear, and you don’t have to
roll the bottle. Intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) is cloudy, and you need to roll
the bottle a few times to suspend the tiny particles in the liquid. A new bottle
has a cap on the top, which you break off and discard. When you’re ready to
give insulin to your child (or take it yourself), wipe the rubber stopper in the
top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe.
Make sure that you’ve selected the correct type of insulin before you draw it
up into the syringe. Suppose that you need to give (or take) 25 units. Follow
these steps to load the syringe with insulin:
1. Pull the plunger of the syringe out, pulling in air, until the end of the
plunger is at the 25-unit mark, the line exactly between 20 and 30 units.
2. Turn the insulin bottle upside down, and insert the needle into the soft
rubber stopper until it’s in the liquid insulin.
3. Push the plunger so that the air in the syringe goes into the insulin
bottle, and then pull the plunger out to the 25-unit mark. Leave the
needle inside the bottle.
Figure 10-2:

4. Make sure there’s no air in the syringe; you can tell by looking for air
bubbles. If there is air, push the plunger back in to discard the insulin.
5. Pull the plunger out again to the 25-unit mark, and repeat Step 4 if
necessary.
6. Pull the syringe and needle out of the insulin bottle.
After you select an injection site (refer to the earlier section “Before you
begin: Selecting an injection site”), push the needle into the skin until it goes
no further. Push the plunger down to zero. You’ve successfully given insulin.
If you’re giving your child an insulin shot, he’s probably had many shots in the
hospital. He should know that they’re just about painless, and he shouldn’t
put up much of a fuss about receiving them.
Mixing two types of insulin
You can mix two different kinds of insulin in one syringe with the exception of
long-acting insulin glargine and detemir insulin. You may need to mix insulins
if you’re giving NPH insulin combined with a rapid-acting insulin, for example.
Here are the steps to follow to mix insulin:
1. Wipe both bottles with alcohol wipes.
2. Pull out the plunger on the syringe to draw up the total units of air cor-
responding to the total insulin you need, both rapid- and long-acting.
3. Turn the long-acting insulin bottle upside down, and insert the needle
into the soft rubber stopper until it’s in the liquid insulin.
4. Push the units of air into the long-acting insulin bottle that correspond
to the number of units of long-acting insulin you need, and withdraw
the needle.
5. Turn the rapid-acting insulin bottle upside down, and insert the needle
into the soft rubber stopper until it’s in the liquid insulin.
6. Push the rest of the units of air into the rapid-acting insulin bottle, and
then pull the plunger out to withdraw the correct number of units of
rapid-acting insulin.
7. Insert the needle into the upside-down long-acting insulin bottle, and
pull out the plunger to withdraw the correct number of units of 
long-acting insulin.
It’s important to follow these steps to mix rapid- and long-acting insulin so
that you don’t contaminate the rapid-acting insulin with the additive in the
long-acting insulin.
182

Aiding the use of syringes and needles
Many people are a bit squeamish and have difficulty looking at the syringe
and needle they’re about to use. The following injection aids either hide the
tools or turn inserting the needle into pushing a spring-loaded button that
pushes in the needle and then pushes in the plunger to give the insulin. Some
of the injection aids on the market are

 BD Inject-Ease Automatic Injector: A spring-loaded plastic syringe holder
 Inject-Ease: A spring-loaded plastic syringe holder
 Instaject: A syringe injector and blood lancet device
 NeedleAid: A device that hides the needle of the syringe or insulin pen
(which I discuss later in this chapter)
 NovoPen 3 PenMate: A device that conceals the needle of an insulin pen
Some devices magnify the syringe so that a visually impaired patient can
easily see the dose he’s taking while holding the syringe and needle firmly.
Some of them include:
 BD Magni-Guide: A magnifying device
 Count-a-Dose: A device that converts pulling up the plunger of the
syringe into audible clicks so that you can hear the dose
 Syringe Magnifier: A magnifying device
 Tru-Hand: A magnifying device
Some devices hold a syringe and needle firmly so that a physically handi-
capped patient can easily pull up the correct amount of insulin. The best of
these include:
 Holdease: A device that holds the needle and syringe together
 Inject Assist: A device that holds the needle and syringe together
 Inject Safety Guard: A device to protect the hand
 NeedleAid: A device that stabilizes an insulin syringe or pen at the time
of the injection
Many of these injection aids are available at pharmacies, and you can also
find most of them on the Internet at diabetes supply Web sites. Two such

Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

Disposing of syringes and needles
It’s essential that you dispose of needles, syringes, and disposable pens (see
the next section) in proper containers so that others don’t reuse the syringes
or stick themselves on the needles. Several companies make containers or
other items to accomplish this important safety precaution (you can find
them at the Web sites mentioned in the preceding section).
 BD Home Sharps Container holds 70 to 100 syringes or 300 pen needles.
 BD Safe-Clip clips and stores up to 1,500 needles.
 BD Sharps Disposal by Mail allows you to mail in 70 to 100 syringes or
300 pen needles.
 UltiGuard Syringes and Disposable Container Unit is a combination of
syringes in various sizes and needle gauges with a disposal unit.
Firmly close any disposal unit you use. When the unit is full, dispose of it
according to your local waste disposal rules.
Insulin pens
An insulin pen consists of a device filled with insulin that allows you to dial
the dose shown in a window (with audible clicks) and make the injection by
pushing in a plunger. Pens come in two different styles:
 The pen contains the insulin already and is discarded when you use up
the insulin.
 You put a cartridge of 1.5 or 3 ml of insulin in the pen as needed and
reuse the pen.
Also, some pens allow you to dial back down if you dial too much insulin.
Check out an insulin pen in Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3:

Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Many patients find that dialing a dose in an insulin pen is much simpler than
taking insulin from a syringe and needle. Of course, with the exception of the
mixtures that are already on the market in pen form, you can’t mix two types
of insulin when you use pens. Pens are probably the best option for children
with T1DM because they’re so easy to use and so accurate.
A number of different companies make pens for their own insulin. Available
pens include the following:
 Autopen, which is available in four different models. Two contain a 1.5-ml
cartridge, and two contain a 3-ml cartridge. Within each size, one pen
delivers insulin in 1-unit increments, and the other pen delivers insulin in
2-unit increments.
 Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog Mix 50/50, Humalog Pen, Humulin Mix 70/30,
and Humulin N, all of which are prefilled, disposable pens containing 3 ml
of the particular kind of insulin you use.
 HumaPen Luxura HD, used for Humalog insulin when half-unit doses are
needed, particularly in children.
 HumaPen Memoir, a new pen that remembers the 16 most recent doses,
their times, and dates; and is used with 3-ml lispro cartridges.
 Levemir FlexPen, a prefilled disposable pen containing 3 ml of Levemir
insulin.
 NovoLog FlexPen and NovoLog 70/30 FlexPen, which are prefilled dis-
posable insulin syringes containing 3 ml of insulin.
 NovoPen Junior, which takes NovoLog cartridges containing 3 ml of
insulin and can be measured in half-unit doses.
 NovoPen 3, which holds NovoLog 3-ml cartridges.
 SoloStar, a disposable pen that contains 3 ml of Lantus insulin.
 Opticlix, which uses 3 ml glargine or glulisine cartridges.
Insulin pens require needles, and you must match the pen with the proper
needle in order for the pen to work properly. If the needles don’t come with
the pen, the instructions with the pen tell you which needle to use.
The technique for injecting insulin with a pen is the same as injecting with a
syringe and needle. The age of your child when you turn injections over to
him depends on your assessment of his capability.
Insulin infusers
Insulin infusers are needles or catheters placed in the tissue under the skin
and taped there for two to three days. When insulin needs to be given, the
syringe is attached to the infusion set and injected into it by you or your child.
185
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

An infuser is useful when your child just hates the idea of three or four needle
sticks a day and prefers to have something already under the skin into which
you inject the insulin. The downside is that the infusion site sometimes gets
infected, in which case you have to remove it and select another site.
An example of this device is the Button Infuser, which has a needle that pene-
trates the skin once. The insulin is delivered into the button each time it’s
needed. Another product called Insuflon has a catheter that remains under
the skin; syringes and needles pierce a membrane instead of the skin, and
insulin is injected through it.
Jet injectors
Jet injectors use a puff of air under pressure to release a jet stream of insulin
that’s forced through the skin by the pressure of the air. There’s no needle
involved. You simply draw up the amount of insulin needed, and you can use
the device again and again. Figure 10-4 shows a typical jet injection device.
Although jet injection devices avoid the use of a needle, they still cause some
bruising. For many patients, they’re a satisfactory substitute for a syringe
and needle. Jet injectors may be used on children, and parents must decide
when the child is mature enough to take on the responsibility of administer-
ing his own insulin using the device.
There are several jet injectors to choose from, including:
 Advanta Jet, which delivers 1⁄2 to 50 units of all types and mixes of insulin
 Advanta Jet ES, which is useful when the skin is particularly tough
 Gentle Jet, which is a low-power version of the two Advanta Jet devices
above for children
 Medi-Jector Vision, which delivers all types of insulin from 2 to 50 units
in 1-unit increments

Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Avoiding side effects, no 
matter the method
There are a few side effects that can be minimized or avoided when injecting
insulin. Following are the common side effects and suggested ways of avoid-
ing them, if possible:
 Blocked needles usually result from injecting insulin too slowly. Inject
faster.
 Bruises are due to puncturing a small blood vessel. The blood is reab-
sorbed rapidly and causes no lasting discoloration.
 Insulin leakage is frequent. A drop or two found on the skin when the
needle is withdrawn represents less than a unit of insulin. One trick is to
pull out the needle halfway, wait, and then pull it out the rest of the way.
 Lipohypertrophies or fatty lumps occur when you inject in the same
site each time. Rotate the sites to avoid this, and remember that the
insulin is absorbed more slowly through these lumps.
 Lipoatrophy is an indentation under the skin that’s probably the result
of an immunological reaction to the insulin. Inject insulin along the edge
of the cavity to cause fat to be laid down.
 Pain is caused by hitting a nerve. You may want to withdraw the needle
completely and insert it elsewhere.
A Major Advance: Inhaled Insulin
For years various companies have looked for a way to get insulin into the
body that doesn’t require injections. An obvious site is the lung, which has an
absorbing surface the size of a tennis court (singles, not doubles). The major
difficulties have been the concern over possible damage to the lungs caused
by the insulin and finding a way to change the dose by small amounts when
necessary.
In 2006, the FDA gave approval to Pfizer to market inhaled insulin, which the
company calls Exubera. The following sections discuss this major advance in
insulin administration and how you can use it to control your diabetes.
As this book was going to press, Pfizer announced that it would no longer sell
Exubera because sales were less than satisfactory. There have been no adverse
effects of inhaled insulin. Pfizer is returning the product to the designer of the
inhaler, Nektar Therapeutics, which is seeking another company to market it.
Several other companies are about to come to market with inhaled insulin, and
the information in the following sections, with the exception of the information
about the particular device used for the insulin, applies to their insulin as well.
187
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

The limits on potential patients
The studies done on inhaled insulin prior to bringing it to market didn’t show
any permanent damage to patients’ lungs. However, the studies were short
term. The FDA requires that all potential users have their lungs checked
before use, at six months after use begins, and every 12 months, or more
often if lung symptoms develop. The lung test, called spirometry, involves the
patient blowing all the air out of his lungs as rapidly as possible. If the patient
can successfully blow out 70 percent or more of the air in his lungs in one
second, he passes the test.
A number of patients aren’t permitted to use inhaled insulin for one reason or
another. These include:
 Children: The long-term effects of inhaled insulin aren’t known yet, and 
if children were to use it, they’d have many decades of exposure. Until
doctors and researchers have years of experience in prescribing inhaled
insulin and seeing its effect on patients, it will remain off-limits to children
with diabetes.
 Pregnant women: The risk to the fetus is unknown, so for now pregnant
women aren’t permitted to use inhaled insulin.
 Patients with chronic lung disease: Uptake of the inhaled insulin is too
variable in these patients, so it can’t be used.
 Patients exposed to secondary smoke regularly: These diabetes
patients also have irregular uptake.
Determining the dose
Inhaled insulin takes the place of rapid-acting insulin. Its onset is a little slower
than that of rapid-acting insulin, but it’s faster than the onset of regular insulin.
It lasts longer than rapid-acting insulin and almost as long as regular. You take
inhaled insulin just before the meal begins or after the meal.
Inhaled insulin isn’t basal insulin. A person with T1DM who takes inhaled
insulin continues to need a shot of long-acting insulin such as glargine in
order to provide the basal insulin.
The device used to inhale the insulin, manufactured by Nektar Therapeutics, 
is in Figure 10-5. The insulin comes in two different doses called blisters and is
measured in milligrams rather than units. The 1-mg blister is equal to 3 units of
rapid-acting insulin, whereas the 3-mg blister is equal to 8 units of rapid-acting
insulin.
188
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Reproduced with permission from Pfizer Inc.
The initial dose taken before each meal is based on your weight. If you need
more than one blister, you take it immediately after the first blister. Table 10-4
shows the starting dosage for inhaled insulin based on weight in pounds. For
example, if you weigh 90 pounds, you start with two 1-mg blisters before each
meal and adjust this dose based upon your blood glucose reading before the
next meal or at bedtime in the case of supper.

Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin

When it comes to inhaled insulin, 1 plus 1 plus 1 does not equal 3. If you run
out of blisters with 3 mg, don’t substitute with three 1-mg blisters. Use two 
1-mg blisters instead.
After you establish a starting dose, you need to continually measure your
blood glucose so that you can change the dose as needed. The desired blood
glucose levels are the same for inhaled insulin as they are for rapid-acting
insulin; see Table 10-3. For example, if you’re getting readings that are too high
before lunch, add a 1-mg blister to the dose before breakfast. Stay at that dose
for a few days and adjust it again if your readings still aren’t satisfactory.
Curiously, despite the inability to give less than 3 units as the lowest dose,
getting to the right dosage of Exubera has not been a problem with my
patients. Nor have they experienced excessive amounts of hypoglycemia.
Inhaling the insulin
The steps for actually taking inhaled insulin are as follows:
1. Pull the base out of the chamber by pulling the black pull ring at the
bottom of the chamber down until you hear a click.
2. Load the proper-sized blister into the slot above the blue handle, with
the pocket containing the insulin facing down, and push it in as far as
it will go.
3. Make sure the mouthpiece is closed. To pressurize the system, pull out
the blue handle from the bottom as far as it will go and squeeze it
until it snaps shut.
4. Hold the inhaler upright with the blue button facing you. Press the
blue button until it clicks. A cloud of insulin fills the chamber.
5. Without delay, stand or sit up straight, and breathe out normally.
6. Turn the mouthpiece around to face you, place it in your mouth, and
form a seal around it. In one breath, slowly and deeply breathe the
insulin cloud in through your mouth.
7. Remove the mouthpiece, close your mouth, and hold your breath for
five seconds. Then breathe out normally.
A little insulin may escape when the mouthpiece is turned around, and there
may be a little left in the chamber after you breathe in. Neither fact affects
your dose. The insulin isn’t pushed into your lungs by pressure but rather is
breathed in by your inhalation.
190
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

A few notes on inhaler maintenance 
and usage
Instructions for maintaining an inhaled insulin inhaler come with it. Because
the insulin is in the form of a dry powder, it’s extremely important that the
inhaler is dry when you take your insulin. Otherwise, the powder will stick to
the moisture and you won’t get the proper dose.
Inside the inhaler is the Release Unit, which is what punctures the blister. You
must change the unit every two weeks. The refill kits come with a month’s
supply of blisters and two release units. The month’s supply is divided among
1- and 3-mg blisters in two ways, depending upon how much of each type you
use: You get either a package with 90 blisters of each type or a package with
180 1-mg blisters and 90 3-mg blisters.
Here are the answers to a few frequently asked questions about inhaled insulin:
 If you don’t eat a meal, you don’t have to take the insulin.
 If you forget to take the insulin before the meal, take it immediately after
the meal but don’t wait any later.
 Don’t put any part of the inhaler in a dishwasher.
 You can use the insulin if you have a cold.
 You need to replace the entire inhaler once a year.
 Keep the insulin blisters at room temperature. If they find their way into
the refrigerator, discard them.
 Keep used blisters away from children and pets because they still contain
some insulin.
191
Chapter 10: Understanding the Basics of Using Insulin
My experience with inhaled insulin
I have patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
taking inhaled insulin. Some of my discoveries
about using it include:
 Patients with T1DM using inhaled insulin are
generally happier than they were on insulin
shots.
 There has been no loss of diabetic control; in
fact, those who were well controlled before
using inhaled insulin remain that way, and
those who weren’t as well controlled have
improved.
 The patients haven’t had more hypoglycemia
since starting on inhaled insulin.
 The patients feel that their quality of life has
improved as a result of the inhaled insulin.
 None of them is embarrassed to use their
inhaler in public, although some say that it’s a
large device.
I’m generally very satisfied with the results of using
inhaled insulin and plan to expand my use of it to
more patients.

Delivering Insulin with a Pump
In This Chapter
 Considering a few issues before using a pump
 Using a pump with ease
 Examining different kinds of pumps
Your child doesn’t like sticking himself with a needle, pen, or injector sev-
eral times a day. Does he have an alternative? He sure does. It’s called
the insulin pump. About the size of a deck of cards, it uses a slowly turning
screw to push the plunger of a small syringe full of rapid-acting insulin. The
insulin goes through a tube and exits under the skin of your child’s abdomen
from a needle or plastic cannula — the infusion set — that you replace every
three days or so.
This chapter covers the pros and cons of insulin pumps. You find out how to
determine the insulin doses for a pump, and I also run through the different
insulin pump devices on the market. See Chapter 10 for the basics of insulin,
including the types of insulin available, information on dosages, and tradi-
tional methods of delivering insulin several times a day.
Keeping a Few Considerations in Mind
before Using an Insulin Pump
Most people who have type 1 diabetes (T1DM) prefer using a pump over
other methods of delivering insulin. If you ask the experts, about 60 percent
of members of the American Association of Diabetes Educators who have
T1DM use a pump instead of needles; about 50 percent of the members of the
American Diabetes Association who have T1DM use an insulin pump rather
than needles. There are more than 300,000 people with both types of diabetes
using pumps.

Studies comparing the control that patients achieve with multiple injections
versus the pump show little difference, which means that your child can use
a pump to get the right amount of insulin without having to worry about
using needles. Here are five additional reasons that people who like the pump
cite for using one:
 The pump delivers insulin to the body much like the pancreas does.
 Your child can adjust the amount of insulin by fractions of a unit and
have many different amounts at different times of day. The insulin pump
easily adapts to a patient’s lifestyle.
 Taking a larger dose before meals is as easy as pushing a button on the
pump.
 Your child can be more flexible with meals because he’s constantly getting
a small dose of insulin. That’s great news for today’s active youngsters.
 There’s less risk of hypoglycemia because your child is getting small
amounts of insulin at a time (see Chapter 4 for details about this 
complication).
On the other hand, here are five equally significant reasons that people don’t
like to use an insulin pump:
 It’s much more expensive than conventional syringes and needles.
 The pump is visible, especially when your child wears less clothing on
hot days. Also, if there’s a blockage, an alarm goes off. Essentially, it
makes diabetes more obvious to others.
 If the pump fails for any reason that doesn’t set off an alarm, such as a
leak, your child has so little insulin in his body that he may rapidly go
into ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4). (I explain how to handle problems
with a pump later in this chapter.)
 Your child must monitor his blood glucose more frequently, sometimes
more than four times daily, to properly use the pump. And right now,
monitoring still means finger sticks. (Chapter 7 has the scoop on moni-
toring blood glucose.)
 The pump is attached to the body 24 hours a day, making sleeping and
physical activities like sports less convenient. (I explain ways to live
comfortably with the pump later in this chapter.)
 Pump wearers who engage in sex may find the pump inconvenient
because it’s attached to the body.
Not everyone is a good candidate for an insulin pump. The best candidates
have the following characteristics:
 They’re highly motivated.
 They’re willing to stick themselves multiple times a day to check their
blood glucose.
194
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 They can afford the costs involved because many insurances pay only a
part of the pump expenses.
 They understand how the pre-meal glucose and the carbohydrates about
to be consumed are used to determine the insulin dose (see Chapter 10).
 They have a good understanding of the complications of diabetes, 
especially signs of ketoacidosis.
Kids of all ages can use the insulin pump. Parents usually manage the pump
until they feel the child can do it.
Using an Insulin Pump Properly
Because your child’s body requires different amounts of insulin at different
times of day and night, you can set the pump to deliver many different
amounts of insulin depending on your child’s particular pattern. The syringe
within the pump contains rapid-acting insulin — Humalog, Novolog, or Apidra.
The pump delivers insulin constantly over 24 hours at what’s called the basal
rate. Just before each meal, your child pushes a button to deliver a larger dose
depending upon the current blood glucose and the amount of carbohydrates
he’s about to eat. This larger dose is called the bolus.
There are a number of different insulin pump manufacturers, each claiming
that their pump has the features that make it the best, but they all work in
the same basic way, as you find out in the following sections. (I discuss the
different types of pumps on the market later in this chapter.)
Going from a syringe and needles to a pump can take some adjustment. When
in doubt, call your child’s doctor with any questions or concerns about
dosages, wearing a pump, and other related issues.
Taking the right doses
Some people recently diagnosed with T1DM can use a pump immediately, but
most people who decide to start using a pump are switching from the follow-
ing routine:
 Long-acting insulin once or twice a day, which corresponds with the
basal insulin of the pump
 Multiple daily injections with rapid-acting insulin before meals, which
corresponds to the boluses given by the pump
195
Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

The total insulin dose from a pump is about 20 percent less than the amount
of rapid-acting plus long-acting insulin from needles or other types of injec-
tion methods. This reduction is due to the fact that a constant infusion of
insulin is more effective than multiple shots.
A pump can be started with a few or many durations of different basal rates,
but in the beginning, the basal rate for most patients is broken down into
these time frames: midnight to 3 a.m., 3 a.m. to 7 a.m., 7 a.m. to noon, noon to
6 p.m., and 6 p.m. to midnight. The rate of flow of the insulin, whether 1 unit
per hour, 0.5 unit per hour, or whatever a particular patient needs, is deter-
mined by the measurement of the response with finger-stick blood glucose
tests. For example, the patient may be started on 0.5 unit per hour through-
out each time frame. If the morning blood glucose is above the desired fast-
ing level listed in Chapter 10, the infusion of insulin in the time frame prior to
that time may be increased to 0.6 unit per hour.
If you’re the type 1 diabetes patient and your schedule is different than that
of most people, you can adapt the schedule to your life. For example, if you
work the night shift, you may reverse the preceding schedule.
Suppose that your child takes 5 units of rapid-acting Lispro insulin before
meals and 5 units of long-acting glargine insulin at bedtime. The total is 10
units. With an insulin pump, he should start with 20 percent less, so his total
dose starts at 8 units.
 He may take 0.2 unit per hour from midnight to 3 a.m. for a total of 
0.6 unit.
 He needs more insulin just before awakening to deal with the dawn phe-
nomenon, the tendency to have higher blood glucose tests first thing in
the morning (see Chapter 4), so he takes 0.3 unit from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. 
for a total of 1.2 units.
 At 7 a.m., he takes a bolus to cover his breakfast carbohydrates, assum-
ing he’s eating within ten minutes. Suppose that he takes 1 unit before
breakfast.
 From 7 a.m. to noon, he takes a little less, say 0.2 units per hour for a
total of 1 unit.
 At noon, he again takes a bolus to cover his lunch — 1 unit again.
 Your child continues the basal insulin at the same time. He may drop his
basal rate to 0.15 unit between noon and 6 p.m. for a total of 0.75 unit
and keep it to 0.15 unit again from 6 p.m. to midnight for 0.75 unit. The
total units from noon to midnight is 1.5.
 He shouldn’t forget to take that pre-supper bolus, perhaps 2 units.
Adding up your child’s basal and bolus insulin, he’s taking 8.3 units initially.
Then it becomes important to check his blood glucose before meals and
occasionally one hour after eating and in the middle of the night (see Chapter 7
196
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

for details on monitoring blood glucose). With the readings and knowing the
amount of carbohydrates he’s about to eat, you and your child can adjust the
size of his boluses to achieve the levels in Chapter 10.
How often should you and your child make changes in the basal rate? If all is
well, you can fine-tune it once or twice a month. If his body is changing rapidly
due to sickness, increased daily physical activity, and so forth (or due to
pregnancy if you’re the patient), changes may need to be made much more
often than that, perhaps even daily.
One way to easily determine if your child’s basal rate is correct is to check
his blood glucose before he would normally eat a meal, don’t take a bolus
and don’t eat the meal, and then check his glucose an hour later. If his glu-
cose remains about the same, his basal rate is good. Do the same thing with
each meal over a day, if possible, to get the complete picture.
Changes made in the basal rate affect your child’s blood glucose two hours
later. For example, a change made at 2 p.m. is felt at 4 p.m. To counteract the
delay, a bolus dose equal to two hours’ worth of the basal rate will result in a
more immediate response of blood glucose. In contrast, stopping the pump
for two hours rapidly reduces the effect of the basal rate on blood glucose. If
you want to rapidly affect the blood glucose, do it by giving a bolus dose, not
by changing the basal rate.
Setting temporary doses
Most of the latest pumps offer the ability to set temporary doses. Here are a
few instances when a temporary change in a dose may be useful:
 Your child’s sick and his blood glucose begins to rise. You may want to
set his basal rate temporarily higher until he’s better (see Chapter 15 
for details on handling sick days on a pump).
 Your child’s going to bed and his glucose is higher than you’d like. A tem-
porary addition of a few tenths of a unit of insulin may be all he needs for
the night, and his glucose can return to its usual rate the next night.
 Your child is going to do a very strenuous exercise on a once- or twice-
a-week basis, so a temporary reduction in the bolus rate by as much as
half may be necessary on the day of exercise to compensate.
 If you’re an adult patient who works nights a few days a week, you may
want to have a temporary program to manage the nights you’re up late.
You can switch back to your usual program when you’re sleeping at
night again.
197
Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

Changing the needle and insulin
Most of the time, you put the pump’s needle or cannula in your child’s
abdomen, taking care not to put it where it will be under pressure, such as at
his belt line. In particular, you shouldn’t place the needle or cannula within a
2-inch circle around the belly button.
It’s important to rotate the site to avoid fatty lumps and infections. You can
do that by creating an imaginary “W” to one side of the belly button. Start at
the upper left of the “W” the first time. Move to the lower left the second
time, then up to the top middle of the “W” the third time, and so forth. When
you finish with that “W,” move to the other side of the belly button and start
another “W.” When you finish with the second “W,” return to the upper right
of the first “W” and proceed accordingly.
You change the needle or cannula every three days at first and less often with
time and experience. Here are the general steps to follow when you insert a
new needle or cannula (always read the instructions for your particular pump
for specific instructions):
1. Wash your hands with soap and water.
2. Remove the needle or cannula from its packaging.
3. Don’t touch the end of the needle or cannula, the tip of the pump
syringe, or the top of the insulin bottle; you want everything to
remain sterile.
4. For a child, prepare the site with a topical anesthetic, especially early
on.
You don’t want pain to discourage the child from using the pump.
Applying ice to the injection site just before inserting the cannula 
or needle also works for children less sensitive to the pain.
5. Clean the site with antiseptic, such as an alcohol swab.
6. Before inserting the tubing or needle, give a priming dose of insulin
to rid the tubing of air. Make sure that you see a bit of insulin coming
out at the end of the tubing or needle.
For signs of a malfunctioning pump, see the later section “Dealing with
problems.”
7. Insert the needle or cannula by pushing it through the skin.
8. Apply a sterile dressing, such as a sterile gauze and tape.
Change the needle or cannula early in the day so that you have a few hours to
verify that it’s working properly. You don’t want your child to go to bed and
miss a night of insulin.
198
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Check the site for infection several times a day and change it if infection is
present or if the blood glucose is more than 250 mg/dl twice in a row. Signs
that suggest an infected cannula include:
 Elevated blood glucose
 Redness at the site
 Tenderness at the site
 Heat at the site
 A lump under the skin
 Pus at the site
 Fever
If you suspect a severe infection, contact your child’s doctor for advice. “If in
doubt, take it out” is a good way of avoiding serious infections associated
with your child’s insulin pump. Put the infusion set in another site, and start
pumping again.
With all this information on changing the needle, you may forget to switch
the insulin, too. The reservoir of insulin in the pump needs to be changed
every three days or so to keep the insulin fresh. If your child’s in a hot cli-
mate, he may need to change it even more often. Every pump requires a dif-
ferent method for changing the insulin, so be sure to read the manufacturer’s
instructions carefully. Keep the insulin he’s not using in the refrigerator.
Living comfortably with the pump
Living with an insulin pump requires some changes, but after a while, it will
be second nature. Here are some tips to guide your child (or you, if you’re
the patient):
 Your child can wear the pump in a number of different places, and numer-
ous items are available to make it easier. Your child may find that belts
with pump pockets, socks or stockings that can hold a pump, and even 
a bra with a pump pocket are great aids.
 During sleep, the pump can be placed next to your child on the bed
assuming that he doesn’t move a lot during sleep. Another possibility is
to turn off the pump and disconnect it during sleep, although it’s a time
when the pump can be especially useful to reduce the dawn phenomenon.
 Some pumps may be worn in the shower, but others require that you
cover them or even disconnect them before coming into contact with
water. Check the manufacturer’s instructions!
199
Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

 Your child can disconnect the pump for up to two hours while playing
contact sports. The exercise helps to bring down the glucose, so he
doesn’t have to make up the insulin he didn’t get from the pump. And
your child should still be checking his blood glucose before and after
heavy exercise and making adjustments as needed. For example, if he
eats and plans to exercise while wearing the pump two to three hours
later, he should reduce the pre-meal bolus by 50 percent and see what
blood glucose results he gets. Check out Chapter 9 for more about the
relationship between exercise and type 1 diabetes. If he wears the pump
during exercise, he must protect it with some sort of covering.
If your child’s feeling well in terms of overall health yet his blood glucose is
rising on the pump, consider the following possibilities:
 His pump is malfunctioning: Visually check that insulin is coming out as
the pump is working.
 His insulin reservoir isn’t providing insulin: Look at the reservoir.
 The infusion set is leaking, blocked, or has come out: Check the place-
ment of the infusion set and look for leaks along its length.
 The needle or cannula has been inserted into a fat pad: Visually inspect
the site of the set.
 There’s something wrong with the insulin, such as it’s expired or was
exposed to very hot temperatures: Use new insulin.
Whenever your child can’t hold down food or fluids, head for the nearest
emergency room. He may need a tune-up.
Switching from the pump in special cases
There will be times when your child needs to use a syringe and needles (or
another injection method) instead of the pump. For example, if the pump
breaks down, if it’s lost or stolen, or if he runs out of supplies for it. How do
you figure out how much insulin he should take to replace the insulin in the
pump?
Assuming your child’s using rapid-acting insulin in the pump, the doses before
meals remain the same with injections as they were in his boluses. The basal
insulin is replaced by glargine or detemir insulin. Just calculate how much
basal insulin he was taking, and replace it with a dose of glargine or detemir
of the same amount. You’ll probably find that you have to increase the dose
over the next few days by about 20 percent because these insulins don’t lower
the glucose as efficiently as continuous insulin. Adjusting the insulin is always
done by measuring the blood glucose.
200
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Checking Out Various Insulin Pumps
A number of companies make insulin pumps, and each one promotes its
product’s own good points. In clinical practice, all the pumps on the market
are useful and can help your child to control his diabetes. Figure 11-1 shows a
typical pump.
In the following sections, I describe some of the most popular pumps on the
market and give you some guidelines for selecting the right one for your
child’s needs (or your own).
MiniMed Paradigm pumps
Medtronic, the maker of the MiniMed pump, claims to manufacture the
number-one prescribed pump for diabetes patients. I don’t doubt it. The 
company has been around the longest and has the most experience in this
field. Medtronic is very reliable and is set up to offer maximum help to the
patient who uses its product.
As of this writing, Medtronic sells four different pumps: the MiniMed Paradigm
522 and 722, and the MiniMed Paradigm 515 and 715. The difference between
the first set of pumps (the 522 and 722) is that the 522 reservoir holds 176
units of insulin and the 722 holds 176 or 300 units (and has to be slightly larger,
therefore). That’s also the difference between the 515 and 715 — the 515 holds
176 units and the 715 holds 176 or 300 units. The difference between the two
sets is that the 522 and 722 work with the Guardian REAL-Time Continuous
Glucose Monitoring System (see Chapter 7), whereas the 515 and 715 do not.

Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

Some of the important features that all four MiniMed pumps share include:
 Changes can be as small as 0.05 units of insulin.
 The pumps store up to 90 days worth of information about insulin
dosages, which can be downloaded to a computer.
 The accuracy of the delivery of insulin is plus or minus 5 percent.
 An occlusion alarm rings when the line of insulin is blocked.
 An over-delivery alarm prevents delivery of too much insulin.
 Remote controls are available to remotely give the bolus dose without
exposing the pump.
 A Bolus Wizard Calculator combines blood glucose readings that you
enter (515/715) or that are transmitted from the continuous glucose
monitor (522/722) with food information that you enter to calculate 
the proper bolus.
 The bolus can be delivered immediately, either as a square wave (it’s
delivered slowly over 30 minutes to eight hours) or as a dual wave 
(part is delivered immediately and the rest by square wave).
 The smallest bolus is 0.1 unit.
202
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 
The future of insulin pumps
In the beginning, insulin pumps were just
pumps. Now they’re systems because insulin
pump manufacturers are trying to combine glu-
cose monitoring with insulin pumping. Ideally,
this system would detect the level of the blood
glucose and change the rate of insulin infusion
based on that. This would be a closed system,
just like the normal pancreas with no interven-
tion by the patient. There are a few obstacles to
this pump capability at the present time.
 The pump can’t know the amount of carbo-
hydrate that the person is about to eat and
adjust for that.
 The pump can’t know the exercise the
person is about to do and adjust for that.
 The continuous glucose monitors that are
currently available (see Chapter 7) aren’t
accurate enough to direct action on the
basis of their readings. A finger-stick blood
glucose check is necessary before chang-
ing insulin dosages. For example, when the
blood glucose is falling rapidly, the continu-
ous glucose monitor may lag behind the
finger-stick blood glucose reading by as
much as 30 to 45 minutes.
 The insulin infused by a pump has an effect
on the blood glucose two hours later — too
far behind the need for it. In contrast, insulin
from the pancreas acts immediately.
Nevertheless, I have to give credit to the pump
manufacturers for trying. One future solution is
an implanted pump that would deliver insulin
right into the bloodstream rather than under the
skin, but that would only solve the insulin lag
problem, not the measurement lag problem.

 The basal rate range is between 0.05 to 35 units per hour.
 You can set up to 48 different basal rates (the day can be broken up into
48 different time periods) in three patterns.
 Temporary basal rates can be programmed to manage special circum-
stances like sickness or prolonged exercise.
 You can set up to eight blood glucose testing alarms per day as a
reminder.
 The keypad can be locked to prevent accidental changes or children
changing the dosages.
 An alert can be set to notify you when the reservoir of insulin is low or
when a certain amount of time remains before it runs out.
 They’re water-resistant (but can’t be worn in a shower or when 
swimming).
 They require one AAA alkaline battery.
Accu-Chek Spirit Insulin Pump System
The Accu-Check Spirit insulin pump is made by Diesetronic, which is owned
by Roche Diagnostics. Here’s a rundown of this pump’s the specific features
and requirements:
 The reservoir holds 315 units of insulin.
 You can set up to 24 basal hourly rates in five different patterns. You also
can set temporary rates.
 The basal rates range from 0.1 to 25 units per hour.
 The smallest bolus dose is 0.1 units.
 It can recall the last 30 boluses, daily insulin totals, and temporary rate
increases and decreases.
 Multiple alarms indicate malfunctions of the pump.
 You can download information about daily insulin totals, boluses, and
alarms to a computer.
 It requires one AA battery.
Animas pumps
The Animas IR 1250 and the Animas 2020 have many of the same features as
the Medtronic pumps. The newer 2020 model is the first insulin pump to have
a flat panel, high-contrast color screen. The Animas 2020 also can store the
203
Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

last 500 blood glucose values and carbohydrate counts. Here are some key
points about the Animas pumps:
 It holds 200 units of insulin.
 The basal range of doses is 0.025 to 25 units per hour.
 You can set up to 12 basal rates in four personalized programs in 24 hours
as well as a temporary basal rate.
 The smallest bolus is 0.05 units.
 They have a program called CarbSmart that stores up to 500 food items
and allows calculation of insulin for the blood glucose and carbohydrates
to be eaten.
 The battery is an AA lithium or an AA alkaline.
 They’re waterproof up to 12 feet.
CozMore Insulin Technology System
This system consists of the Deltec Cozmo insulin pump and the CoZmonitor
Blood Glucose Monitor, which attaches to the pump in the back and commu-
nicates with the pump via infrared technology to display the result on the
pump screen. Some of this pump’s features include:
 The smallest bolus is 0.05 units.
 It alerts you of a missed bolus before a meal.
 It holds 300 units of insulin.
 It alert you to test blood glucose.
 It has a site change alert to notify you to change the infusion set.
 It comes with CoZmanager PC Communications Software, which allows
you to connect the pump with your computer and either print or e-mail
the pump program as well as view the history of pump programs.
 It uses a proprietary 3.6 V battery.
 It’s waterproof.
Dana Diabecare II pump
Made by Sooil Development, this pump is the lightest weight of the ones I
cover in this section — it weighs a mere 1.8 ounces. Some unique features 
of this pump include:
204
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 It holds 300 units of insulin.
 It allows you to set preset meal boluses (standard boluses for standard
meals).
 It’s about 20 percent less expensive than the other pumps.
 It has a proprietary luer lock connection between the infusion set and
the pump, so you must use the specific infusion set.
 You can set up to 24 basal rates in 24 hours in a single pattern. You also
can set a temporary basal rate.
 It uses a 3.6 V battery.
 It has multiple alarms to warn of malfunctions.
 It keeps track of daily insulin totals, boluses, and alarms that you can
download.
 It is watertight.
OmniPod Insulin Management System
A product of the Insulet Corporation, the OmniPod is unique in that it con-
sists of a wireless two-part design: the OmniPod and the Personal Diabetes
Manager. The OmniPod has a disposable insulin reservoir, an angled infusion
set, an automated inserter, a pumping mechanism, and power supply. It lasts
for three days and is then discarded. The Personal Diabetes Manager is the
device that programs the delivery of the insulin, and it has a Freestyle glu-
cose monitor (see Chapter 7) built into it.
Here are some of the features of the OmniPod pump:
 The reservoir holds up to 200 units of insulin
 It can be set for 24 rates in 24 hours with seven possible basal patterns.
There are also temporary basal rates.
 The basal range is between 0.05 and 30 units per hour.
 The smallest bolus is 0.05 units.
 The Personal Diabetes Manager has a built-in food database with over
1,000 common food items.
 It can store 90 days of downloadable data.
 The OmniPod has an integrated battery, and the Personal Diabetes
Manager uses two AAA batteries (making it the heaviest of the pumps
covered in this section).

Chapter 11: Delivering Insulin with a Pump

Choosing the right pump
Given this wealth of choices, how do you choose the pump that’s best for
your child? You’re about to purchase a device that costs more than $6,000
and will require more than $1,500 worth of supplies per year, so take your
time and don’t select the first pump you look at. Take these factors into 
consideration:
 Your child’s doctor may be very familiar with one or two pumps and feels
most comfortable using them. That may be a very important part of your
choice unless you want to choose a new doctor with your child’s pump.
 Your insurance company may prefer that you select one particular pump.
However, if your child prefers another, don’t give up easily on the pump
of his choice. Many insurance companies will permit the purchase of an
insulin pump that isn’t on their preferred list if you provide convincing
evidence that your child needs the special features of that particular
pump.
 The need for a waterproof pump influences which pump you can use.
 If you or your child have problems with your hands, some pumps are
easier to program than others.
 Your child may prefer a pump that’s silent rather than a pump that clicks
as insulin is delivered.
 A pump that can be set to deliver the smaller basal rates is better for
small children.
 Representatives of the pump company will work with you to help you
understand how to program the pump, so you should be comfortable
with them.
 You should know ahead of time if the pump uses any infusion set or
requires a special one that you have to order.
 Whether or not you receive a backup pump immediately if there’s a
problem is an important detail.
Your child can wear the different pumps (without insulin) to get the feel of
them for a few days. You can get them from the pump manufacturers.
I find that my insulin pump patients use very few of the special features that
their pumps provide. They average about five different basal rates in 24 hours
and don’t change patterns very often. They don’t use temporary settings very
often either. The tendency is to use lots of features when the pump is new and
then back off after you’ve been using it for months.

Getting a Grip on Other 
Drugs and Treatments
In This Chapter
 Adding to the effect of insulin with pramlintide
 Checking out common treatments
 Avoiding drugs that interfere with diabetes treatment
A
lthough insulin, which I describe in Chapter 10, is the lifesaving drug for
type 1 diabetes (T1DM), there’s a world of other drugs out there, some
of which can profoundly affect your child’s (or your) diabetes. Some may be
helpful, whereas others are damaging to blood glucose control. In this chap-
ter I tell you about all the important drugs that may affect your child’s dia-
betes, both positively and negatively. In addition, I discuss a few treatments
that have proved useful for diabetic complications.
Boosting Insulin’s Effect: Pramlintide
Since the end of the 19th century, doctors have known about a red-staining,
waxy material called amyloid in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas
(see Chapter 2 for the basics of beta cells). In 1987, this material was extracted
and dubbed amylin. Researchers found that the beta cells secreted amylin at
the same time that they secreted insulin, but the amylin was secreted in a
much smaller amount. Amylin has some valuable properties that help the
person with diabetes; among them:
 It blocks the secretion of glucagon, a major hormone that tends to raise
blood glucose (see Chapter 2 for details).
 It slows the emptying of the stomach so that glucose is absorbed more
slowly.
 It causes loss of appetite and weight loss.

Amylin, therefore, has an important effect on the rate at which glucose appears
in the blood after eating. These effects occur when amylin reaches certain
centers in the brain.
Because amylin comes from the same cells that make insulin, it’s absent in
T1DM just as insulin is absent in T1DM. It was thought that providing amylin
to a patient with T1DM may improve the blood glucose. However, naturally
occurring amylin has chemical properties that make it unusable as a pill or
an injection. Mainly, it couldn’t be made to dissolve in any liquid. A small
change in the chemical structure made it possible to dissolve the new chemi-
cal while retaining all the properties of amylin. The new chemical is called
pramlintide.
Pramlintide is available for use in diabetes under the brand name Symlin. It’s
given before meals as an injection but can’t be mixed with insulin in the same
syringe. It works with regular and rapid-acting insulin. Pramlintide prolongs
the emptying of the stomach for up to an hour after an injection, although it
has no effect on the next meal. Less glucose enters the blood from the intes-
tine because the stomach empties more slowly and from the liver because
glucagon is reduced by pramlintide’s blocking action.
When pramlintide was given for over a year, it improved blood glucose con-
trol with a significant reduction in the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7 for
more about hemoglobin A1c). There was also a decrease in the amount of
insulin that patients needed and a reduction in weight in many patients.
Like all drugs, pramlintide has its problems, although they don’t seem to be
too severe.
 Nausea is the most common side effect and is worse with higher doses.
It’s usually mild, starts when pramlintide is started, and usually stops
after a month of therapy. It can be minimized by gradually increasing the
dose of pramlintide once a week.
The insulin dose should be reduced by 50 percent before meals when
pramlintide is started. The usual starting dose of pramlintide is 15
micrograms before each meal, and it’s raised by 15 micrograms every
three days as long as the nausea is tolerable. The maximum dose is 120
micrograms.
 Hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4) is also a problem at the beginning of treat-
ment; it usually ends after a month of therapy, when the insulin dose has
been properly adjusted. It may be that the nausea prevents eating, leading
to hypoglycemia at first (within three hours of the pramlintide injection).
 Other more rare side effects include dizziness, indigestion, stomach
pain, tiredness, and vomiting.
 Pramlintide has not been studied in pregnancy and breast feeding, and it
should probably not be used under these conditions. (I discuss the
treatment of T1DM during pregnancy in Chapter 16.)
208
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 It slows down the uptake of other medications as well as glucose being
used to treat hypoglycemia.
Pramlintide may be used in adults and children with T1DM when the control
of the blood glucose isn’t satisfactory. Your or your child’s doctor must pre-
scribe this medication.
You should probably not use pramlintide if you have hypoglycemia unaware-
ness (see Chapter 4) or a form of diabetic neuropathy called gastroparesis
(see Chapter 5), which makes the stomach empty slowly.
Surveying Different Treatments
In the last few years, several treatments have been found to help to make the
blood glucose more normal or control symptoms of type 1 diabetes. These
treatments may be used for children as well as adults. Other treatments, while
common, haven’t been found to be useful, and I want to make sure that you
know about them (and steer clear of them).
Acupuncture
In the past few decades, diabetes has become more common and complica-
tions have appeared more frequently. Acupuncture is often promoted as a
treatment for these complications, especially painful neuropathy and gastro-
paresis (see Chapter 5). Not surprisingly, most of the information about the
usefulness of acupuncture comes from China. The literature on acupuncture
and diabetes goes back hundreds of years, but here are some of the latest
findings on the role of acupuncture in diabetes (both type 1 and type 2).
 For neuropathy: An article in The Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine
in March 2006 compared acupuncture with Western treatments in groups
of 30 diabetes patients. It showed that the patients receiving acupuncture
not only improved in terms of pain from the neuropathy but their blood
glucose and blood fats improved as well. Unfortunately, it’s next to impos-
sible to repeat these studies in the West because few practitioners per-
form acupuncture here.
 For gastroparesis: Gastroparesis, which is delayed emptying of the stom-
ach due to diabetic neuropathy, can cause hypoglycemia and difficulty
with glucose control because the insulin doesn’t have its peak activity
when the blood glucose is highest. In a study published in The Journal 
of Traditional Chinese Medicine in September 2004, groups of diabetes
patients with gastroparesis were treated with acupuncture or medication.
The patients receiving acupuncture fared much better, with significant
improvement in gastroparesis.
209
Chapter 12: Getting a Grip on Other Drugs and Treatments

If you or your child suffer from these painful conditions and can’t find relief
from traditional medical treatment, it’s definitely worth trying acupuncture
for whatever relief it may give.
Be sure that your acupuncturist is qualified by the state. You can find qualified
acupuncturists in your area at www.medicalacupuncture.org/findadoc/
index.html. Also, the treatment is rarely associated with infection, but you
should be sure to check the needle sites afterward in case there’s a problem.
Biofeedback
Biofeedback is a technique in which a machine detects an internal body func-
tion like your heart rate or your body temperature that’s supposed to be
involuntary. When you’re aware of the function, you can attempt to alter it.
Experiments with biofeedback techniques show that people have more con-
trol over so-called involuntary bodily functions than they realize.
Biofeedback has been shown to relieve stress in patients with type 1 and type 2
diabetes with a significant fall in hemoglobin A1c, muscle tension, and average
blood glucose. A study in Diabetes Care in May 1991 found that type 1 patients
who did biofeedback had significantly more normal blood glucose levels than 
a comparable group that didn’t undergo biofeedback.
You can find a practitioner at the Web site of the Association of Applied
Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, www.aapb.org.
Chromium
Many studies from China and Taiwan suggest that chromium can improve 
the blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. For example, a study in
Metabolism in July 2006 found that the average blood glucose and hemoglo-
bin A1c were lowered in the group that got chromium compared to the group
that did not. However, an article in Diabetes Care in May 2007 indicated that
chromium had no effect on blood glucose in a Western group of patients with
type 2 diabetes after six months of treatment compared with a group that
received no chromium. Due to concern about the toxicity of chromium, the
article recommended against supplementing the Western diet with
chromium.
I haven’t found any studies that suggested that chromium has a role in the
treatment of type 1 diabetes.
210
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Cinnamon
Cinnamon was first described as a possible treatment for diabetes in Diabetes
Care in December 2003. Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes were given 1, 3, or
6 grams of cinnamon daily or a placebo. They received cinnamon or a placebo
for 40 days, and the levels of fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol,
and triglycerides were measured. All three amounts of cinnamon reduced all
these measurements in patients with type 2 diabetes.
In 2006, an article in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation confirmed
these findings. Seventy-six patients with type 2 diabetes were given 3 grams
of cinnamon daily or a placebo. Cinnamon reduced the plasma glucose signif-
icantly more than the placebo. The higher the initial glucose, the more the
cinnamon reduced it.
This result called for a study of patients with type 1 diabetes, which was pub-
lished in Diabetes Care in April 2007. Patients took 1 gram of cinnamon daily.
Unfortunately, the study didn’t show an improvement in hemoglobin A1c,
total daily insulin usage, or the number of hypoglycemic reactions.
The bottom line as of this writing is that cinnamon isn’t useful for blood 
glucose control in patients with T1DM.
Ginseng
Ginseng is a traditional Chinese herb that has been shown to have some 
glucose-lowering properties. For example, an article in Phytomedicine in
October 2003 showed that ginseng lowered blood glucose and hemoglobin
A1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, no controlled trials have
shown that ginseng lowers the blood glucose in people with type 1 diabetes,
and it’s not recommended as a treatment for this condition.
Vanadium
Vanadium is a chemical found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Studies
have shown that animals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes respond to
vanadium with a lowering of the blood glucose. However, no study has com-
pared a group taking vanadium with a group that isn’t.
211
Chapter 12: Getting a Grip on Other Drugs and Treatments

The verdict on vanadium’s benefits to people with diabetes is still out, but if
you want to get a bit more of it into your diet, have a glass of red wine a few
times a week. Perhaps this practice is the explanation for the decreased
occurrence of heart disease in the French compared to Americans, and as 
I explain in Chapter 5, heart disease is a major complication of T1DM. Anything
you can do to lower your chances of heart disease is a step in the right direc-
tion. But remember, a person with T1DM needs to watch his alcohol intake
like a hawk; I discuss alcohol in the next section.
Drinking Alcohol Safely
Alcohol is a drug that may be okay in small amounts but can ruin you when
it’s abused, especially if you have T1DM. Your child hopefully won’t drink
alcohol until he has reached the permissible age in your state. However, as an
adult, he may drink, and you and he have to understand the role of alcohol in
diabetes. Of course, if you’re an adult patient, you need to be wise about 
alcohol intake, too. In the following sections, I advise you on safe amounts 
to drink, the dangers of drinking too much, and resources for getting help
kicking the habit.
Your child’s drinking habits will be a direct reflection of your drinking habits.
The less you encourage excessive drinking and back it up by not drinking
yourself, the more likely it is that your child won’t drink either.
The maximum amount of alcohol allowed
The best way to start a discussion of the maximum amount of alcohol permis-
sible for someone with T1DM is to define acceptable amounts. Here’s the scoop:
 For a man, an acceptable amount of alcohol means a maximum of two
glasses (5 ounces each) of wine or its equivalent (24 ounces of beer or 3
ounces of hard liquor) every 24 hours. The maximum amount permissi-
ble is ten glasses a week.
 For a woman, an acceptable amount means one glass (5 ounces) of wine
or its equivalent (12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor) every
24 hours. The maximum amount permissible is five glasses a week.
The difference results from the fact that women metabolize alcohol much
more slowly than men.
You don’t have to adjust your insulin before drinking these amounts of alcohol,
but eat something when you drink. And don’t only drink alcohol, especially
last thing before going to bed.
212
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Wear a bracelet or necklace identifying you as a person with diabetes. If
something goes terribly wrong and someone finds you unconscious after
drinking, he’ll smell the alcohol on your breath and assume you’re drunk
even if the real problem is that your blood glucose is dangerously low.
The dangers of excess alcohol
If you have type 1 diabetes, here’s what alcohol does to complicate your 
condition (and your life):
 It provides empty calories, which are calories with no nutritional value
that have to be counted in your diet. The approximate numbers of kilo-
calories that various forms of alcohol contribute to your diet are
• Beer (12 ounces): 90 calories for light and 160 calories for regular
• Hard liquor (1.5 ounces): 100 calories
• Wine (5 ounces): 110 calories
 It doesn’t have an immediate effect on the blood glucose when you drink
it because it isn’t a carbohydrate. As the carbohydrates in the food 
you have eaten decline, alcohol has its effect, especially if you drank 
too much.
 It prevents the liver from forming new glucose. If taken without food by a
person who has taken a shot of insulin, the glucose can fall to severely
hypoglycemic levels. This usually happens overnight when the patient is
asleep. The result can be coma and brain damage.
 It reduces the secretion of growth hormone and cortisol, substances that
typically raise the blood glucose.
 The more you drink, the longer it takes the liver to break down the alco-
hol, so the effects of a bottle of wine, for example, may be felt for the
next 10 to 12 hours.
 It interferes with your understanding of how to take the proper amount
of insulin in the proper way.
 It interferes with your better judgment about the fact that you must eat.
If you have T1DM and don’t eat as you drink alcohol, you’re at great risk
for a severe hypoglycemic reaction.
 It impairs your ability to recognize hypoglycemia, especially when
you’re drunk.

Chapter 12: Getting a Grip on Other Drugs and Treatments

Finding help
Alcohol abuse has numerous physical and mental consequences, including
cirrhosis of the liver (when the liver loses its ability to function properly and
you die of hemorrhage or liver failure) and degeneration of the brain (when
you lose coordination and develop severe emotional instability). Alcohol also
is a home wrecker.
For the person with T1DM, alcohol abuse makes it impossible to control the
blood glucose to prevent complications. The abuser takes in enormous quan-
tities of empty (non-nutritious) calories and usually fails to eat good food. He
fails to take his insulin either because he’s drunk or because he forgets to
take it when sober. All this is a prescription for diabetes disaster.
How do you know if you have a serious problem with alcohol? Here are the
key tip-offs that suggest you need help with a drinking problem:
 You crave alcohol.
 You have tolerance to alcohol, so you require more alcohol than a non-
alcoholic to reach the same state of inebriation.
 You have a physical dependence on alcohol and go through withdrawal
symptoms like nervousness, shakiness, and headaches if you don’t drink.
 You can’t stop drinking after you start.
You can stop your heavy drinking, but you need help to do it. Only a small
percentage of alcoholics stop on their own, but 90 percent of alcoholics who
go through a combination of the following are typically sober after one year:
 Treatment, which is an intervention during which the patient totally gives
up alcohol
 Participation in Alcoholics Anonymous, a program in which alcoholics
meet regularly and declare their inability to control their alcohol intake
 Aftercare, which consists of attending regular weekly meetings in which
the patient’s alcohol abuse continues to be addressed
There are a number of drugs that the alcohol abuser with T1DM can use to
avoid drinking, particularly disulfiram and varenicline. If you’re a heavy
drinker and a smoker, which is a common combination, varenicline may allow
you to kill two birds with one stone. (See the later section “Kicking the habit”
for more about this drug.)
The resources for the alcohol abuser are enormous. Here are the best (in
addition to talking to your doctor):

Avoiding Dangerous Drugs
If you have type 1 diabetes, you should avoid a number of drugs. They can
make your blood glucose worse or set you up for horrendous complications
of diabetes like amputation. The following sections tell you about these dan-
gerous drugs and offer some suggestions for getting off them if you’re already
hooked.
Prescription medications
For someone with T1DM, prescription medications are divided into two 
categories:
 Those medicines that affect T1DM by interfering with insulin
 Those medicines that affect T1DM by raising blood glucose on their own
Whatever drugs you take, check to see whether the drug has a side effect or
interacts with a drug you’re already taking that may cause your blood glucose
to increase or decrease. Your doctor has the information to help you to do
this, but if you want to do some sleuthing on your own, try these Web sites:
 www.drugs.com: Here you’ll find numerous ways to look up a drug, but
the simplest is to type the name of the drug in the box at the top of the
page and click on Drug Search. If you want information on that drug from
other Web sites, click on Internet Search. But beware, a lot of the infor-
mation on the Internet isn’t based on science but rather is an attempt to
sell you something. Evaluate your findings closely.

Web sites about diabetes to find the answer to just about any question
you have. Select Diabetes under Related Websites on the left side of the
home page, and you’re off!
215
Chapter 12: Getting a Grip on Other Drugs and Treatments

No matter what, if you start a new drug and notice that your blood glucose is
suffering, be sure to talk to your doctor.
See Chapter 15 for information on taking care with over-the-counter medica-
tions when you (or your child) are ill.
Tobacco
Whether it’s smoked, snorted, chewed, or inhaled as secondhand smoke,
tobacco kills. If it were a quick killer like rat poison, it wouldn’t last on the
market for a day. But tobacco kills slowly, and by the time you realize that
there’s a problem, the damage has been done, whether it’s lung cancer, stom-
ach cancer, chronic lung disease, amputation, or a combination of these.
Unfortunately, too many people wait until they have an irreversible disease 
to put away their cigarettes or other forms of tobacco for good. And at that
point, it hardly matters anymore.
In the following sections, I explain the dangers of smoking for folks with
T1DM and give you guidelines for quitting.
If you’re a young person (or a not-so-young person) with or without diabetes,
don’t make the biggest mistake of your life and start using tobacco in any
form. If you’ve started already, stop today!
The dangers of tobacco
Some of the ways that tobacco hurts the person with diabetes include:
 It increases arteriosclerosis, the condition of changes in arteries that lead
to heart attacks, strokes, and loss of blood supply to the legs that results
in amputations. (See Chapter 5 for details on T1DM complications that
affect the heart.)
 It increases blood pressure, which also leads to worsening of arterioscle-
rosis and the tendency to have a stroke.
 It increases the clustering of platelets, the tiny disks in the blood that
normally prevent a small cut from becoming a hemorrhage. Increased
platelet clustering causes clumping within the arteries, blockage of
blood flow, and death of tissues, especially the heart, brain, and arteries.
 It increases pain in the legs and heart in people with diminished blood
flow.
 It reduces blood flow in arteries immediately in addition to contributing
to the long-term worsening of arteriosclerosis.

Kicking the habit
Can you stop smoking? Forty-six million Americans have done it, so why not
you? There are numerous ways you can go about it. You may be able to do it
the first time you try, but don’t give up if that doesn’t happen. Many people
manage to quit for good on their second, third, or fourth attempts. The impor-
tant thing is to keep trying!
Some people can stop “cold turkey,” making up their minds to quit immedi-
ately and never touching another cigarette. Others require a scare like chest
pain or shortness of breath. Still others find success in nicotine replacement
therapy because the nicotine in cigarettes is what’s so addictive. Some of the
forms of nicotine replacement therapy include:
 Nicotine gum: Available without a prescription, you chew the gum for a
while until the need for a cigarette is gone. Then you park the gum in your
cheek until you again feel the urge and chew some more. Each day, you
decrease the number of pieces of gum you chew, and finally you reach 
a day when you don’t need it at all.
 Nicotine inhaler: You need a prescription to get a nicotine inhaler. It
delivers a vapor into the mouth, and the tissues in the mouth absorb 
the nicotine. Sometimes it causes irritation in the mouth.
 Nicotine nasal spray: Available by prescription, you use the nicotine nasal
spray whenever you feel the urge for a cigarette. Over time, the urge
diminishes. People with sinus problems have trouble using this form of
replacement therapy.
 Nicotine patches: You can buy patches over the counter or with a pre-
scription if you need a higher dose. The nicotine is absorbed through
the skin, and you decrease the strength of the nicotine in the patch as
your need for nicotine diminishes.
There are also certain drugs that block the addictive power of nicotine in
your brain. Among the drugs that are safe for folks with T1DM are
 Bupropion SR (brand name Zyban): Takes away the craving for nico-
tine, but researchers don’t know exactly how it does it. You take this 
prescription-only drug twice daily. The dose should be no greater than
300 mg daily, and no single dose should be greater than 150 mg to avoid
the risk of seizures.
 Varenicline (brand name Chantix): Seems to be more effective than
bupropion in helping people stop smoking. This new drug blocks the
places in the brain to which nicotine attaches, so there’s less craving
and a reduction of the pleasurable effects of nicotine. Here’s how you
use varenicline:
• You set a date to quit smoking and then start taking this drug a
week earlier.
217
Chapter 12: Getting a Grip on Other Drugs and Treatments

• You take it after a meal with 8 ounces of water.
• The dose is 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. If you haven’t stopped
smoking after the first 12 weeks, you’ll benefit from another 12
weeks on the drug.
Varenicline can cause drowsiness, so you shouldn’t drive or use heavy
machinery until you know how you react to the drug. Elderly people
may be particularly sensitive to its effects, and it shouldn’t be used in
children under 18 or breastfeeding mothers. Pregnant women need to
discuss use with their doctors before they start the drug.
The combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy may be
even more effective than either alone. However, the safety and effectiveness
of combining varenicline and nicotine replacement hasn’t been studied.
If you want more help to accomplish the critical task of giving up tobacco in
any form, talk to your doctor and consult these great resources:
 The American Cancer Society has all kinds of pamphlets and other
materials as well as books and tapes on quitting smoking; call
1-800-227-2345 or visit www.cancer.org.
 The American Lung Association has information and clinics to help 
you to stop smoking; call 1-800-586-4872 or visit www.lungusa.org.
Illegal drugs
Use of illegal drugs makes it difficult to impossible to take care of your type 1
diabetes properly. You don’t eat properly, take your insulin, or exercise when
you’re high. Just the expense of keeping up with your illegal drug habit may
interfere with buying your medications. In addition, each illegal drug has its
own negative side effects that can make you sick or complicate your diabetes.
Here are the specific negative consequences of various illegal drugs:
 Marijuana (grass, weed, bud, cannabis) increases appetite, so you take
in too many calories.
 Amphetamine (speed, Dex, crank, whizz, sulph) and Ecstasy (E, eckies,
MDMA, X, adam, bean, roll, doves) speed up the metabolism, leading to
hypoglycemia because you usually aren’t eating properly while you’re
on the drug.
 Cocaine (coke, snow, nose candy, dust, toot) and freebase cocaine (crack,
rock) cause diminished food intake and failure to take medications.
 Heroin (dope, junk, smack) has the same effects as cocaine but also
involves an injection through which hepatitis and HIV/AIDS can be
passed.
218

Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and
Pancreatic Islet Transplants
In This Chapter
 Getting a new kidney and pancreas
 Receiving new beta cells
 Recovering from all types of transplants
I
f there’s such a thing as a “cure” for type 1 diabetes (or T1DM), it will be
found in the information in this chapter. Three types of transplants are
available to adults who have severe long-term complications from T1DM or
who suffer from severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness. These
surgeries generally are off-limits to children under the age of 18, who typically
don’t have such complications. The surgeries are as follows:
 Pancreas transplant: Some folks, if their complications are severe
enough, require a whole new pancreas. No matter how hard doctors 
and researchers try, they can’t precisely mirror the function of the 
pancreas — either through insulin shots or continuous insulin infusion
with an insulin pump. Only the pancreas works so well. What an organ!
 Kidney transplant: If you bought this book too late to use the informa-
tion to prevent kidney damage, this chapter tells you what you need to
know about having a kidney transplantation or, even better, combining it
with transplantation of the pancreas.
 Pancreatic islet transplant: A new way of “curing” type 1 diabetes is
transplanting just the cells that make insulin, the beta cells found in the
islets of the pancreas (see Chapters 2 and 10 for more about these cells).
This technique was first reported in 1974 but had little success until a
report in 1990 from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which described a new
way of preventing rejection of the islets without using steroids.

Receiving a New Kidney
When your kidneys are failing, a kidney transplant can be a lifesaving move
that lets you avoid the difficulties of dialysis. See Chapter 5 for more about
long-term kidney complications.
Recognizing when you need a new kidney
The time to do a kidney transplant is when your kidneys are beginning to fail.
Don’t wait until they no longer function. As soon as you have to start dialysis,
your life span is reduced compared to the person who has a kidney transplant
early on, before the need for dialysis.
The signs that your kidneys have reached the stage where transplantation is
essential are
 Chronic fatigue
 High blood pressure
 Swelling of your legs
 Elevation of the serum creatinine (this blood test reflects the current
level of kidney function; as kidneys fail, blood creatinine rises)
Your doctor evaluates you and determines when the signs and symptoms have
reached the point that you need to see a kidney specialist about a transplant.
Knowing when you can’t 
have a kidney transplant
Even if you fulfill the criteria in the previous section, you may not be a candi-
date for a kidney transplant if any of the following are true for you:
 Severe heart disease
 Failure of other organs such as the lungs and liver
 Active cancer
 Abuse of drugs or alcohol
 Psychological instability
 Body mass index (BMI) greater than 40
 Age greater than 75
222
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

These risk factors make the transplant much more dangerous; you’re more
likely to die from the surgery or quickly reject the kidney.
The pros and cons of a kidney transplant
The biggest advantage of having a kidney transplant is that your quality of
life is much improved compared to dialysis. For one thing, you no longer
need dialysis if it has been started. For another, you’re likely to be able to
resume your regular life activities, even becoming pregnant if you’re female.
(I explain the precautions for women with T1DM to take when they’re trying
to conceive in Chapter 16.)
The success rate of a kidney transplant is quite high, too. Ninety percent of
transplanted kidneys are working well after one year, 80 percent after four
years, and 50 percent after ten years. Some transplants have lasted as long as
40 years. Now that’s something to cheer about!
When you have a transplant, however, you have to take drugs to prevent rejec-
tion. This is the biggest disadvantage because drugs to prevent rejection may
 Make you more susceptible to infection
 Slowly damage the transplanted kidney
 Cause osteoporosis or soft bones
It’s important to continue to monitor your kidney function after the transplant
to make sure that your body isn’t rejecting the kidney. The best test for this is
the creatinine. If it starts to rise, you have to temporarily increase the dosage
of your immunosuppressive drugs. (See the later section “Following up and
treating your diabetes” for more information.) Post-transplant, your doctor
also continues to monitor your bones for osteoporosis and your skin for skin
cancers that are more common after a kidney transplant. He or she does this
with blood tests and observation of your skin.
Occasionally, the transplanted kidney fails and another transplant is necessary.
The same evaluation and precautions apply to this new kidney.
Understanding the costs
The average cost for a kidney transplant is less than $40,000. Compared to
continuous need for dialysis, a kidney transplant becomes cost-effective 
after less than three years. Put simply, a lot of money could be saved if more
kidney transplants were done, not to mention the improvement of more
patients’ quality of life.
223
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants

Most kidney transplant patients are eligible for Medicare, which pays 80 per-
cent of the cost of the transplant. Medicare also pays up to 80 percent of the
cost of ongoing care, such as the antirejection drugs, but this only continues
for 36 months. If you’re eligible for Medicare because of your age or disability,
it continues to cover ongoing care costs as long as you remain eligible. Speak
to your doctor and insurance company about your eligibility for payment of
these costs.
Undergoing an evaluation
So you’ve weighed the pros and cons, figured out how to pay for a kidney
transplant, and decided to go ahead with the procedure; that’s great news!
Before you go under the knife, you need to complete a number of steps in 
the evaluation process:
 You see a cardiologist to make sure that your heart is healthy enough to
handle major surgery.
 You meet the surgeon, who informs you of the risks and complications.
 You see a psychologist or social worker to evaluate your emotional state.
 You check with your insurance company to confirm your coverage.
After you accomplish these tasks, you do the actual work of finding a proper
donor with the following steps:
 Your blood type is checked to match you with a donor. A donor with
type O blood can donate to anyone. A recipient with type O blood can
only receive a kidney from another type O. (See the next section for
more about donors.)
 Your blood is checked for human leukocyte antigens (HLA), substances
on white blood cells that show how close the match is between donor
and recipient.
 Your blood is checked for human leukocyte antibodies to the donor HLA.
If these are present, you’re said to have a positive crossmatch and the
transplant isn’t done due to a much higher risk of rejection of the kidney.
If they’re not present, you’re ready to go.
Finding a donor, living or deceased
A kidney transplant is better done with a living donor, someone who’s willing
to give up a kidney to save your life. Generally, a living donor is someone you
know who’s willing to give up a kidney — your spouse, brother, sister, and so
forth. Using a living donor has advantages and disadvantages. Kidneys from
224
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

living donors tend to last longer than kidneys from deceased donors, and
you’re likely to get your transplant before kidney failure damages your body.
But you have to find a related donor willing to give up a kidney, and the
donor is giving up one of two kidneys in a major operation that requires
recovery time.
Many more kidneys have become available from living donors since the devel-
opment of the expanded criteria donor (ECD) policy. ECD kidneys come from
an older population (older than 60) and from younger donors who may have a
history that previously would have ruled them out as donors, such as high
blood pressure or elevated serum creatinine.
If you have to go on a list to receive a kidney from a deceased donor, the wait
may be long, and you don’t get to choose the source.
The process of surgery and recovery
During a kidney transplant, the native kidneys are left in place. The new kidney
is attached by its blood vessels in the pelvic area, and its ureter goes into the
bladder. Surgery takes about three hours.
During recovery, you’re tested for your kidney function. You’re in the hospital
for two to three days after the transplant, but the recovery doesn’t end there.
See the later section “Dealing with Continuing Issues after Any Transplant”
for more information.
Getting a New Pancreas (Alone 
or with a New Kidney)
The failure of the pancreas to produce insulin is the major problem in type 1
diabetes. The simple solution is to transplant a new pancreas into the patient
with T1DM. A person can receive a new pancreas in one of three ways:
 A pancreas transplant can be done simultaneously with a kidney trans-
plant, which is the most common procedure in 80 percent of cases.
The survival of the simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant is
greater than the other types in this list and similar to the survival of a
kidney transplant alone (see the earlier section “The pros and cons of 
a kidney transplant” for details). A person with T1DM having a kidney
transplant should be considered for a pancreas transplant at the same
time.
225
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants

 Sometimes the pancreas is transplanted after the kidney, such as when a
kidney is immediately available for transplant and a pancreas isn’t. This
occurs 15 percent of the time.
 In 5 percent of pancreas transplant cases, the pancreas alone is trans-
planted. This is done when the patient has severe and frequent hypo-
glycemia or hyperglycemia (see Chapter 4 for more about these
complications).
I outline the process of receiving a new pancreas in the following sections.
Keep in mind that the evaluation process for a pancreas transplant is similar
to that for a kidney transplant, which I cover earlier in this chapter.
Recognizing when you 
need a new pancreas
If you suffer from severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia that doesn’t respond
to treatment, or if you have severe hypoglycemic unawareness, you’re a can-
didate for a pancreas transplant. Often, the pancreas transplant is done in
conjunction with a kidney transplant.
Knowing when you can’t have 
a pancreas transplant
The same criteria that prohibit you from having a kidney transplant are true
for a pancreas transplant or a pancreas-kidney transplant (refer to the earlier
section “Knowing when you can’t have a kidney transplant”). If you have other
severe diseases or abuse drugs or alcohol, you’re not a candidate for a pan-
creas transplant.
The pros and cons of a pancreas transplant
Are you nervous at the thought of undergoing a pancreas transplant? Fret not;
here are several advantages of receiving a new pancreas:
 The benefit of needing no insulin injection and no dialysis after a com-
bined kidney and pancreas transplant is enormous. Your quality of life
improves tremendously.
 With a combination kidney and pancreas transplant, your new kidney
doesn’t suffer the same deterioration as the original, damaged kidney.
Without the healthy pancreas, the new kidney would deteriorate.
226
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

 If you suffer from hypoglycemic unawareness (see Chapter 4) with severe
resultant low blood glucose, you resume hypoglycemic awareness after
a transplant of the pancreas.
 Glucose levels that are very brittle smooth out after pancreas 
transplantation.
 Early complications like eye disease, nerve disease, and heart disease
reverse after pancreas transplantation.
Keep in mind, though, that a pancreas transplant isn’t without risks. The newer
drugs used to suppress rejection of a pancreas don’t cause osteoporosis, as
corticosteroids (the traditional antirejection drugs) do, but they have their
own problems. In addition, the surgery on the pancreas is technically more
difficult than kidney surgery, which leads to other possible complications.
Some of the specific risks of pancreas transplant include:
 Surgical complications that require removal of the graft in 10 percent of
transplants
 Bleeding and infection in as many as 25 percent of transplants
 Damage to the kidney from the antirejection drugs (if you’re receiving a
combined kidney and pancreas transplant)
 High blood pressure due to the drugs
 High blood glucose due to the drugs
 Diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding due to the drugs
Looking at the costs
The cost for a kidney transplant alone varies widely; I’ve seen figures from
$25,000 to $150,000 for this procedure. A pancreas transplant costs from
$51,000 to $135,000. Concrete information on the cost of the combined organ
transplant isn’t available, so you need to talk to your doctors and insurance
company for specific estimates.
If you’re eligible for Medicare, it provides coverage for a combined pancreas-
kidney transplant. Be sure to check with your insurance company to find out
what will be covered beyond Medicare.
Finding a pancreas donor
The pancreas donor is always deceased, and you don’t get to choose. If you’re
eligible for a pancreas transplant, you’re placed on a list and get the transplant
when you reach the top of the list.
227
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants

The process of surgery and recovery
Figure 13-1 shows the appearance of the abdomen after simultaneous kidney
and pancreas transplant.
 As in a regular kidney transplant, the native kidneys are left in place. The
new kidney is attached by its blood vessels in the pelvic area, and its
ureter goes into your bladder.
 The pancreas is attached to your intestine so that the digestive enzymes
can go into the intestine where they belong. Its blood vessels are attached
to nearby arteries and veins. Your own pancreas is left in your body to
continue to provide digestive enzymes to your intestine. (A pancreas-
only transplant also looks like this.)
Surgery takes about four to six hours for a simultaneous kidney and pancreas
transplant; a pancreas-only transplant takes two to four hours. The drugs
that prevent rejection of the kidney and pancreas are introduced after surgery,
and their concentrations are measured by blood tests. You must stay in the
hospital for 7 to 12 days after the combined transplant; if you’re in the hospi-
tal for just a pancreas-only transplant, you’ll stay a similar number of days. I
discuss additional follow-up later in this chapter.

On the Cutting Edge: Pancreatic 
Islet Transplantation
When you think about it, kidney and pancreas transplants (which I discuss
earlier in this chapter) are pretty straightforward; simply speaking, a donor’s
organs are sewn into your body so that all the organs, old and new, work
together. But as you find out in the following sections, you also have a new
and exciting method of “curing” T1DM at your disposal: transplanting only
the pancreatic tissue that contains the insulin-secreting beta cells. That’s
what’s done in islet transplantation.
As I explain in Chapters 2 and 10, insulin is made in beta cells in the pancreas,
which are found in areas of the pancreas called islets. The islets make up only
2 percent of the pancreas, but there are a million of them. Pancreatic islet
transplantation involves the extraction of the islets from the donor pancreas
and the injection of the islets into the liver of the recipient with T1DM. Islet
transplantation is much simpler than whole pancreas transplantation because
the more-major surgery is limited to the donor, who’s deceased. (For details
on the actual transplant, see the later section “The process of surgery and
recovery.”) The objective is to eliminate the need for insulin injections.
As of this writing, islet transplantation in the United States is being done only
in the form of clinical trials. If you’re interested in joining a clinical trial on
islet transplantation, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Enter “islet trans-
plantation” in the search box, and you’ll be taken to a listing of studies, one
of which may be near you.
Recognizing when you need 
islet transplantation
The indications for islet transplantation are the same as those for whole pan-
creas transplantation: The patient suffers from debilitating hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemia or has significant complications of diabetes. If you want to
join a clinical trial, you’ll be fully evaluated by a doctor before undergoing 
the procedure.
Islet transplantation is most successful when the patient is taking a low dose
of insulin. Any patient whose insulin use is 40 units daily or less is an excel-
lent candidate for this procedure.
229
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants

Knowing when you can’t 
have an islet transplant
The same contraindications for having one of the other transplants are true
for this type of transplant. If you have a debilitating disease like severe heart
disease or cancer, or if you abuse alcohol or drugs, you can’t have this 
treatment.
The pros and cons of an islet transplant
The advantages of the islet transplantation include
 Freedom from the need for insulin injections
 Reversal of long-term diabetic complications
 An end to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
 A return of hypoglycemic awareness
Several risks are associated with islet transplantation. They include the 
following:
 Danger of bleeding because heparin is given to prevent clotting of the
portal vein for the injection
 All the risks of the antirejection drugs used for intact pancreas trans-
plantation (which I cover earlier in this chapter), including increased
blood pressure, increased blood fats, and decreased kidney function
 Potential worsening of diabetes-related eye disease, requiring laser
surgery
The outcome for islet transplantation isn’t nearly as good as intact pancreas
transplantation. At one year after surgery, 70 percent of patients don’t need
insulin injections, but at four years, the number drops to 20 percent. For
intact pancreas transplantation, the continued success at four years is 70
percent.
Even partial success in an islet transplant makes a big difference in the qual-
ity of life of the patient with diabetes who has severe up-and-down blood 
glucose or hypoglycemic unawareness.
230
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Considering the costs
Patients currently don’t pay for the islet transplantation procedure because
it’s in clinical evaluation.
The donation of islets
Islets are obtained from a deceased donor who had previously agreed to
donate his pancreas. It takes six to eight hours to extract the islets from a
pancreas. The recipient needs 10,000 islets per kilogram of body weight to 
be free of the need to take insulin shots. For a 150-pound male, for example,
that would be 700,000 islets.
Even though each pancreas has a million islets, the extraction process isn’t
perfect, and it takes two to four pancreases to get the required number.
However, even the islets from a single pancreas will greatly improve diabetic
control, converting a person with very unstable blood glucose levels into a
much more stable patient.
231
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants
A few variations on islet transplantation
Three new developments in the transplantation
of islets are experimental, just like the original
procedure.
 Microencapsulated islet cells have been
used for transplantation. The cells are
coated with gum-like materials so that other
cells that promote rejection as well as the
antibodies that attempt to do the same are
prevented from getting to the islets. If this
were successful, there would be no need
for antirejection drugs.
 Stem cells, the cells in the body that haven’t
yet changed for a specific function, have
been made to evolve into beta cells. How-
ever, scientists are having difficulty gener-
ating sufficient numbers of stem cells to
eliminate the need for insulin.
 Animal islets, particularly from pigs, are
being evaluated for transplantation into
humans. However, the body would try to
reject these islets even harder than it tries
to reject human islets.
The problems associated with the last two pos-
sibilities mean it will be years before doctors
and researchers see the benefits of stem cell or
animal islet transplantation.

The process of surgery and recovery
If you’re receiving an islet transplant, an area of your abdomen is numbed with
anesthesia. Under radiologic observation, the radiologist injects the donated
cells into your portal vein, which drains into the liver. (Figure 13-2 shows the
process of extracting and transplanting islets.) The transplanted islets stick
to the liver. They take days to weeks to make enough insulin to supplant the
external source of insulin, which is gradually tapered down to nothing.
An uncomplicated islet transplant takes one hour and should keep you in the
hospital no more than a few days.
The use of antirejection drugs followed in the clinical trials is based upon the
Edmonton Protocol. However, several of the drugs in this formulation make
the blood glucose higher.
Dealing with Continuing Issues 
after Any Transplant
It would be wonderful if you could forget about your diabetes after you’ve
had any type of transplantation. Unfortunately, you need to remain alert to
several issues, as I explain in the following sections.

Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

Following up and treating your diabetes
The follow-up is similar for all types of transplantation:
 You go back to the clinic for tests of function and any need for insulin
injections.
 You measure your blood glucose frequently, looking for signs of a sudden
need for more. An increase indicates that the transplant is failing, proba-
bly due to rejection.
 At first, the levels of the antirejection drugs in your blood are measured.
After blood levels have stabilized, they’re checked once a month.
The need for insulin diminishes immediately or within days of a transplant.
It’s important to measure your blood glucose frequently to know when you
may reduce your insulin shots. Hypoglycemic episodes and brittleness of the
diabetes (frequent and unexpected ups and downs in the blood glucose)
improve within one month of the transplant.
Checking for long-term complications
Obviously, depending on how long you’ve had T1DM, you may have some 
evidence of diabetic complications after a transplant. The following is still
necessary to watch for potential problems:
 Eye exams must continue once a year even though your blood glucose is
now normal because the progression of eye disease doesn’t stop abruptly
after transplantation.
 Foot exams must continue, especially if you’ve had neuropathy (see
Chapter 5). You must have your feet checked for sensation and examine
them regularly for cuts and infections that you may not be able to feel.
Check out Chapter 7 for general information on eye and foot examinations.
Avoiding infections
After transplantation, you’re on potent drugs that block immunity, so you’re
at risk for severe infection. Make sure that you get immunized for pneumonia
with pneumococcal vaccine and that you get an annual influenza vaccination.
Washing your hands regularly and practicing good dental care are also ways
of preventing the occurrence of infections.
233
Chapter 13: Surveying Kidney, Pancreas, and Pancreatic Islet Transplants

Being careful with conception
Antirejection drugs have been associated with reduced fertility in women. If
they do get pregnant, they have more complications of pregnancy than women
who don’t take these drugs. They may have more infections, high blood pres-
sure, swelling, and even loss of the transplanted organ. For these reasons, it’s
suggested that women who want to become pregnant after transplantation of
the kidney and/or pancreas wait at least one year until their condition stabi-
lizes. There aren’t sufficient studies of pregnancy in women who have under-
gone islet transplantation, but common sense suggests that waiting a year for
stabilization of the transplant is a good idea.
As far as breastfeeding is concerned, the effect of the drugs on the infant has
not been clarified. The drugs do enter the breast milk, so monitoring the levels
of antirejection drugs in the baby is recommended.
Flip to Chapter 16 for general information on handling pregnancy smoothly
when you’re a T1DM patient.
Watching out for cancer
The overall incidence of cancer after transplantation is low (less than 1 to 2
percent). However, the risk still exists, so it’s wise to know the possibilities:
 The antirejection drugs increase your risk for cancer, especially a form
called posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). PTLD has the
following characteristics:
• It’s more common in patients under age 18.
• Caucasian males have a higher incidence than others.
• It can occur in a single site or multiple sites in the body.
• Treatment may require stopping the antirejection drugs.
 Cervical cancer occurs more frequently after transplants and should be
prevented by regular pelvic exams.
Finding More Information Online
Before you have a transplant, you may want to find out where they’re having
the best results and a lot more. The place to go is the U.S. Registry of
Transplant Recipients at www.ustransplant.org. Here you can find
234
Part III: Treating Type 1 Diabetes 

national transplant statistics as well as annual reports that address waiting
lists, immunosuppressive drugs, survival of the organs, survival of the
patients, and a lot more.
Another valuable site for more information on kidney and pancreas transplan-
tation is the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse at diabetes.
niddk.nih.gov. You should be able to find answers to all your questions at
this site. But if not, I recommend heading to one more Web site: the National
Kidney Foundation at www.kidney.org.
The National Kidney Foundation’s site has a search box to help you locate
information quickly and easily. (When I entered “kidney transplantation,” it
came back with 2,800 articles on the topic!)
These three sites will keep you busy until you’re notified that your kidney
and/or pancreas is ready and waiting for you so that you can begin your new
life free from injections and free from dialysis.

Diabetes

In this part . . .
P
eople don’t live in isolation. They have jobs and fami-
lies, parents and children. They go through many
stages in their lives: childhood and school, adulthood 
and work, fertility and menopause, and finally the “golden”
years. Type 1 diabetes affects every one of those stages in
different ways. Part IV provides you with a roadmap of your
child’s life as someone with type 1 diabetes and what direc-
tion to go at every turn. (This also applies to you if you’re
the patient.)

and Other Activities

Y
our child with diabetes not only has to deal with the medical conse-
quences of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) but the social and economic 
consequences as well. You want him to get the best education possible — 
the same as a child without diabetes. And when he gets older, you want your
child not to face discrimination in getting a job. Then there’s the issue of
health insurance for your child with diabetes; you want a rate that doesn’t
bankrupt you, and you want him to have the same reasonable rate when the
time comes that he’s dealing with his own insurance.
Relax! Those who have come before you have faced all these problems, and
with the help of a beneficent government prodded by many organizations 
like the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation, most of the issues have been managed in a very satisfactory
manner. (I provide contact information for these organizations and others 
in Appendix B.)
There’s plenty of help out there for you, the parent of a child with diabetes,
but you have to be assertive and make sure your child gets all that is coming
to him. I think you’ll be satisfied with the result. This chapter tells you what
you need to know to be the best possible advocate for your child (or yourself).

Dealing with Diabetes in School
If you’re the parent of a child with T1DM about to enter school, you’re proba-
bly concerned about whether your child will get the same education as a child
who doesn’t have diabetes. The answer is a definite yes if your child goes to 
a school (public or private) that gets federal funding assistance. In return for
these funds, schools have agreed to abide by federal laws concerning the
treatment of students with any type of handicap. Three key laws apply to
your child entering school:
 The Americans with Disabilities Act says that schools and day care
centers can’t discriminate against handicapped children.
 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination
against anyone in an activity that receives federal funding. Children with
T1DM qualify for protection under this act. It states that the parents of a
qualifying child have the right to develop a Section 504 Plan with the
school for their child.
 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates that the fed-
eral government help state and local agencies provide a “free, appropri-
ate education” to any child who qualifies. Under this act, the parents of a
qualifying child have the right to develop an Individualized Education
Program, which is similar to a Section 504 Plan but more detailed.
In the following sections, you come to understand what a Section 504 Plan is,
how to set one up for your child, and how to follow through to make sure that
your child gets the excellent education he deserves.
Developing a Section 504 Plan
Essentially, a Section 504 Plan stipulates how your child’s diabetes will be
handled at school; it gets into specifics about certain allowances that will 
be made for your child as well as adults at the school who will be expected 
to monitor your child’s condition and help him if needed. You create a Section
504 Plan together with the school officials and any expert you bring to the
meeting. For example, you may want to bring a Diabetes Educator or even 
an attorney if you sense some resistance on the part of school officials.
The following sections tell you what to do to get a Section 504 Plan in place
for your child and also what types of clauses the plan should include.
Working with teachers and school staff
A Section 504 Plan doesn’t create itself. So how do you get the ball rolling on
the road to a safe and accommodating school experience for your child with
type 1 diabetes? Follow these steps:
240
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

1. As a parent, you bring the fact that your child qualifies for a Section
504 Plan to the attention of the school’s administrators.
2. You give consent for the school to evaluate your child and determine
if he qualifies for a plan.
3. Assuming he qualifies, a team of regular and special education teach-
ers, nurses, and others such as dietitians and diabetes educators meet
to develop a plan with you and your child if he’s mature enough to
participate.
4. The plan is carried out and reviewed at a minimum of three-year
intervals.
A typical Section 504 Plan requires at least two adults at a child’s school to be
educated and trained to deal with the child’s diabetes; the school is responsi-
ble for assigning these adults and making sure they’re properly trained. You
can find a valuable resource to help from the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation at www.jdrf.org. Select “Life with Diabetes,” and then click on
“Type 1 Diabetes in School.” You’ll find a School Information Packet contain-
ing everything your school needs to know about the child with diabetes. You
can order the packet from the Web site and take it to the school as part of
setting up the Section 504 Plan.
Getting down to plan specifics
If you aren’t happy with the complete Section 504 Plan, you can sign only those
parts that you agree with while you continue to negotiate other parts. As your
child’s needs change, you need to change the plan together with the school
officials.
The Section 504 Plan should be as detailed as possible, leaving little room for
interpretation. Here are some of the clauses that need to be in your plan:
 The child may use the bathroom without restriction.
 The child may have immediate access to water, including a water bottle
at his desk.
 The child may have snacks at his desk or at any school location, includ-
ing on the school bus.
 The child may see the school nurse at any time, and hypoglycemia
should be treated immediately.
 The child may test his blood glucose and use insulin (if appropriate to the
child’s age) during school hours. He also has permission to carry these
items at all times.
 Blood glucose tests may be done anywhere in school.
 The child may participate in all field trips and extracurricular activities.
 If the child takes a break for his diabetes during a classroom assignment
or test, he will be given an opportunity to make up the missed work.
241
Chapter 14: Adjusting to School, Work, and Other Activities

 If the child’s blood glucose is greater than 240 mg/dl before heavy exer-
cise, he may be excused, checked for ketones, and given water and
insulin as necessary.
 The child won’t be penalized for being absent or late due to medical
appointments or activities involved in controlling his blood glucose.
 The child’s blood glucose meter and insulin must accompany him during
a fire drill.
 Two adults (a primary caregiver and a back-up) must be trained to rec-
ognize hypoglycemia and to administer glucose, glucagon, or insulin as
needed.
 The school nurse will have a copy of the plan.
This is a typical plan for a small child who takes insulin shots. If your child
switches to an insulin pump (see Chapter 11 for pump particulars), you and
school officials must add the various requirements for that form of treatment,
including pump training for an adult.
To see a typical 504 Plan for a child at every age from 4 to 17, visit www.
childrenwithdiabetes.com/504. Just click on the age of the child and
the type of treatment. Remember that these plans are simply illustrations 
and the plan for your child will depend upon his special needs.
Considering an individualized 
education program
If T1DM makes your child unable to learn with the rest of his class (because
he suffers from frequent hypoglycemia or frequent hyperglycemia, for exam-
ple), he may need an individualized education program. This is a detailed
program for his education based on the requirements of his diabetes as well
as his special education needs. It’s more of an education program than a
health program, which is why I don’t get into it extensively in this book. The
need for this type of program is determined by parents and school officials
working together. For a complete guide to the individualized education pro-
gram and a program document template, visit www.ed.gov/parents/needs/
speced/iepguide/index.html#form.
Handling diabetes in college
After your child has gotten through high school, it’s assumed that he’s old
enough and responsible enough to take care of his diabetes. If he’s heading
off to college, encourage him to notify the health team at the college of his
242
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

diabetes. Health officials need to know about his medications, the history of
his diabetes, and his treatment plan. He also should take his college roommate
into his confidence so that someone very close to him is aware of his condition
and in a position to help if needed. A student living in a dorm should notify the
dorm staff and make sure that someone there knows about high and low blood
glucose problems. He doesn’t have to tell his professors as long as the student
health program knows about him and his condition.
Living with Diabetes as a Working Adult
Type 1 diabetes affects all aspects of life if you’re the patient. In this section,
you discover the professional limitations that T1DM causes you as a working
adult. You also find out how to use the legal protections that exist for you.
Understanding limits and protections
Today, diabetes isn’t the obstacle that it once was, but there are still a few
jobs that you (or your grown child) can’t have if you have T1DM. These jobs
have a blanket ban against people with diabetes, so if you have the disease,
you can’t have the job no matter what your condition. Among these jobs are:
 Armed forces
 Commercial airline pilot
 Fire services
 Jobs requiring a large goods- or passenger-carrying vehicle license
 Police services
 Train driving
 Working at heights
Advancements in diabetes management and glucose control are slowly but
surely wiping out the blanket ban. For example, there used to be a blanket
ban on people with diabetes working as any type of airline pilot. Then it was
recognized that with proper precautions, a person with T1DM can safely fly a
private plane. It’s expected that soon the door will be opened to working as a
commercial pilot as well.
As a person with T1DM, you’re protected in the workplace by the Americans
with Disabilities Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 1998 that the act,
which applies to employers with 15 or more employees, protects people with
243
Chapter 14: Adjusting to School, Work, and Other Activities

diabetes. It’s illegal for your employer to ask if you have diabetes, but he can
request that you undergo a physical examination to determine if you’re well
enough to do the job. Years earlier, the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973
accomplished the same thing for anyone applying for a federal job or a job
with a company that receives federal aid.
These laws put the burden on the employer to show that the employee isn’t
qualified to do the job. If the employee is qualified for the job (just like anyone
else) and his diabetes requires some reasonable accommodation, like allowing
him to eat on the job as necessary or go to the bathroom, the employer must
comply.
With all the different kinds of insulin and delivery systems that are available
now (see Chapters 10 and 11), it should be possible for you to accommodate
any work schedule. It’s true, however, that you’ll have difficult time keeping
your blood glucose normal if you have to constantly change work shifts, so a
job with a changing schedule may not be the best choice for you if you have
T1DM.
The real risk of hypoglycemia 
in the workplace
A study in Diabetes Care in June 2005 represents an important accomplishment
for people who take insulin. In this study, researchers looked at 243 employees
(ranging in age from 20 to 69) who were taking insulin for diabetes. Over a 12-
month period, researchers recorded the frequency, severity, and consequences
of hypoglycemia occurring at work or elsewhere. (They focused on hypo-
glycemia because it’s the most common complication that employers point
to as the reason they don’t want to hire people with diabetes.)
During the period of study, there were 1,995 episodes of hypoglycemia that
were mild and could be treated by the patients. There were an additional 238
severe episodes that required help from someone else. Of the severe episodes,
62 percent happened at home, 15 percent occurred at work, and 23 percent
occurred elsewhere. (Fifty-two percent of the severe episodes occurred
during sleep.)
As for the consequences of severe hypoglycemia, 14 percent of the patients
being studied lost consciousness, 9 percent had seizures, 2 percent had head
injuries, 2 percent had other injuries, 1 percent injured someone else, and 
1 percent damaged property. Severe hypoglycemia in the workplace was
associated with six episodes of minor soft-tissue injury.
The authors concluded the following about severe hypoglycemia in the 
workplace:
244
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 It’s uncommon.
 It seldom causes disruption.
 It rarely causes serious health effects to the patient or others.
 Its infrequency and mild effects in the workplace don’t justify restriction
of employment for people with diabetes who take insulin.
Taking action if you suspect 
discrimination related to diabetes
If you feel that you’re suffering from discrimination in the workplace because
of your diabetes, you have several options for handling it. Begin by talking to
your supervisor. If that doesn’t work, you can
 Hire an attorney and sue the company.
 Ask your union to file a grievance.
 Contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at
www.eeoc.gov or call 800-669-4000.
Unfortunately the Bush administration has reduced the staff of the EEOC by
20 percent and a reduced budget in the EEOC has resulted in a huge backlog
of cases at present. You may want to turn to one of the other options listed
here to get your complaint handled in a timely fashion.
Most employee complaints related to diabetes are surprisingly modest. For
example, perhaps the employer won’t allow the employee to snack when his
glucose is low, give him a place to do a blood glucose test, or provide pre-
dictable hours.
Employers win more cases than employees. The employee has to prove that
he’s disabled for the law to be on his side, and that can be difficult. In past
cases, judges have decided that a store manager who couldn’t walk because
of poor circulation and a security guard who had lost vision in one eye and
was losing vision in the other were not disabled.
Working together: Helping employers 
integrate employees with diabetes
If you have T1DM, you can help your employer meet the standards for helping
you and others like you to be as productive as everyone else. I recommend
that you bring the information in this section to the attention of your employer.
245
Chapter 14: Adjusting to School, Work, and Other Activities

There’s an enormous amount that a company can do to integrate its employees
with diabetes. After all, they’re some of the most skillful employees and their
loss would be felt in the company’s bottom line.
The government has set up a Web site to help employers hire and accommo-
date people with diabetes successfully. At www.diabetesatwork.org/
diabetesatwork, you can find many case studies of companies that have
successfully integrated people with diabetes into their staff. Some of the
other valuable information you’ll find on the site includes:
 Guidance on making a case for and developing a diabetes prevention and
management program.
 Recommendations for healthier eating in the workplace.
 Suggestions for controlling obesity in the workplace.
 A way to estimate the number of people with diabetes in your company.
This information gives the employer an idea of the magnitude of the
problem, and he’ll be much more accommodating when he realizes how
common it is.
 A formula for determining the cost of health care for the people with 
diabetes in your company. (At the time of the writing of this book, this
formula was being revised to reflect the fact that diabetes is generally
better controlled than in the past, thus avoiding the higher costs for
complications of diabetes.) This information helps your employer to
plan appropriate health insurance for his employees.
The case studies show how a company can save a lot of money on medical
expenses while greatly increasing the health and morale of employees with
diabetes. For example, the clothing and outdoor equipment retailer Lands’
End, which has more than 7,000 employees, adopted a Diabetes Prevention
and Management Program that included:
 Support groups and talks on general health as well as diabetes-specific
topics
 A disease management module
 Regular A1c testing (see Chapter 7) and screening for diabetes
As a result, the company was able to slow the increase in medical costs to 
3 percent compared to a national average of 12 percent in 2002. The next
year, Lands’ End’s medical costs increased only 2 percent compared to a
national average of 13 percent. The company’s diabetes program continues
to have great success.

Driving Safely with Type 1 Diabetes
When your child has diabetes and is of driving age, he can’t just hop in the car
and hit the open road like someone without the disease. T1DM shouldn’t hold
him back; it just requires that he take a few extra steps and monitor himself
along the way. (If you’re the patient, the same goes for you!) Share these keys
to driving safely with diabetes with your child:
 Know your blood glucose before you start to drive. If it’s below 90 mg/dl,
eat something before you drive.
 Keep a source of glucose that won’t spoil where you can reach it as you
drive.
 Check your blood glucose at least hourly by pulling over and using your
meter.
 If there’s any question in your mind that you may be hypoglycemic, pull
off and test your blood glucose. If it’s low, take glucose and make sure
that the level is above 90 mg/dl before you resume driving.
247
Chapter 14: Adjusting to School, Work, and Other Activities
Check the stats on diabetes and car crashes
In 2003, seven diabetes clinics in the United
States and four in Europe pooled the results of
an anonymous questionnaire about diabetes
and driving given to both type 1 and type 2 
diabetes patients. The study was published 
in Diabetes Care in August 2003. Here are the
highlights of the findings:
 Drivers with T1DM reported more crashes,
moving violations, severe hypoglycemia,
and need for assistance while driving com-
pared to drivers with T2DM and their non-
diabetic spouses.
 Drivers with T2DM (including those who
took insulin) had no more frequent crashes
than their non-diabetic spouses.
 The drivers with T1DM who crashed tested
their blood glucose less often than drivers
with T1DM who didn’t crash.
 Drivers with T1DM who used insulin pumps
crashed less often than those who used
injections.
 Nearly half of the drivers with T1DM had
never spoken with their doctors about dia-
betes and driving.
 Despite the higher frequency of crashes in
patients with T1DM than with T2DM, it’s
less than half the frequency of crashes in
patients with other medical conditions that
have no driving restrictions, including sleep
apnea and attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder.
 Crashes involving a driver with T1DM are
far less frequent than crashes involving a
person under the age of 20 as a percentage
of the numbers in each group.

Individual states issue drivers’ licenses, and the applications don’t consistently
ask about diabetes. They usually ask about any general condition that would
impair safe driving. In California, where I live and practice, the Department of
Motor Vehicles requires a doctor to certify that the person with T1DM follows
a good medical plan with frequent blood glucose testing, is free of frequent
hypoglycemia, and can safely operate a motor vehicle.
You can find out the regulations concerning driving with T1DM at the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles in your area. Having T1DM doesn’t usually have any adverse
effect on your auto insurance.
Tackling Insurance Issues
Health insurance and life insurance are tough issues for anyone with a chronic
disease. Insurers don’t like risks and resist insuring people who may actually
use their insurance. Nevertheless, although it may take longer to find a policy
and it may cost more, you can get insurance for yourself or your child with
T1DM.
Health insurance
A child with T1DM is insured under your policy as his parent, and the health
insurance usually comes through your job. When your child becomes an
adult and enters the workforce, his company is likely to have a group insur-
ance policy that he enrolls in, generally without penalty for being a person
with diabetes. No law mandates that health insurance must be provided to
employees; in many cases, employer health insurance coverage arose as an
incentive to attract employees and keep them with the company.
You can turn to Insurance For Dummies by Jack Hungelmann (Wiley) for more
coverage of health insurance than I have room to provide here. This section
looks at health insurance specifically as it applies to coverage for someone
with T1DM.
When it comes to getting insurance as a person with type 1 diabetes, there
are plenty of protections in place if you understand them and know how to
use them. One such protection is the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA), which regulates employee group health plans. If your child has
T1DM (or you do), the ERISA rule that you can appreciate the most is that an
employer health plan can’t discriminate against your child (or you) by refus-
ing to let him join or charging you more if he has an illness.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) limits the
time that you can be excluded from a company health plan because of a prior
248
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

illness. That means that if you have T1DM when you join the company, the
company must offer you health insurance within a reasonable time if all 
other employees have it.
There are basically two types of health insurance:
 Fee-for-service plans pay the provider (a doctor or hospital) based on
the number of services provided. It’s to the provider’s advantage to 
perform more services.
 Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) charge the same for all
members, dividing the risk among more expensive and less expensive
patients. The fewer services that the provider actually performs, the
more the provider takes home, so HMOs try to enroll the healthiest 
population possible to avoid the higher costs of sickness.
It’s common for companies to give employees the choice between a fee-for-
service plan and an HMO. As someone looking to insure either your child or
yourself with T1DM, you need to anticipate using your insurance coverage
more than someone without diabetes. Under those circumstances, you need
to keep in mind that generally the HMO costs you less but the fee-for-service
plan allows you a much wider choice of doctors and hospitals. The following
are some particularly important considerations to make and questions to ask
about insurance coverage when choosing a plan:
 What’s the total annual cost of the plan? How much does your employer
pay, and how much do you pay?
 Do you have to pay a certain amount (called the deductible) before the
insurance kicks in and begins to pay?
 Do you have a co-payment (an amount you pay every time you use a
provider), and how much is it?
 Will your plan pay for durable medical equipment like an insulin pump,
which is expensive?
 Will your plan pay for diabetes medication and supplies?
 Is your physician restricted to prescribing certain medications?
 Can you get a 90-day supply of drugs, or do you have to go back to the
pharmacy (and pay another co-payment) every 30 days?
 Are you covered for specialists like eye doctors, neurologists, and
kidney doctors?
 Are you limited to using certain doctors or hospitals that may not be
convenient?
 Is home health care included?
249
Chapter 14: Adjusting to School, Work, and Other Activities

Each state also has its laws about how medical insurance can be offered. 
The best place to find the information for your state is the Web site of the
Georgetown University Health Policy Institute at ihcrp.georgetown.edu.
Go to healthinsuranceinfo.net to access the consumer guide for health
insurance for your state. The Health Policy Institute site also has a lot of
information about social and health issues that may apply to you, like the
Center on an Aging Society and the Long-Term Care Financing Project. It’s
amazing how much valuable information is at your fingertips!
Life insurance
As you would expect with T1DM, it’s a little harder and more expensive to
obtain life insurance than if you (or your child) had no medical condition, 
but it is out there. One bright spot is that premiums are coming down as
insurance companies realize that people with diabetes can live a lot longer
than they used to.
Because you (or your child) have T1DM, you’re said to have an impaired risk.
Some insurance agents specialize in obtaining insurance for people who have
an impaired risk. The best way to find these agents is to just pick up the phone
and start calling. Briefly explain your condition, and ask if they can get insur-
ance for you.
One of the best things you can do to make yourself more attractive to life
insurance providers is maximize the control of your blood glucose, blood
pressure, and blood fats. Insurance companies look favorably on someone
who has these elements of T1DM under control and therefore is in better
health than someone who doesn’t. Turn to Chapter 7 for information and
advice on managing blood glucose and other key elements.

Managing Illness and Travel
In This Chapter
 Taking care on sick days
 Hitting the road with type 1 diabetes
T
wo situations are particularly challenging for both the parent of a child
with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and adults with T1DM: days in which the
patient is sick with some other illness and days in which the patient travels.
In this chapter, I tell you everything you need to know to manage these two
difficult situations.
Although the emphasis in this book is on controlling the blood glucose as
tightly as possible, it’s better to err of the side of looser control when the
patient is sick with another illness or is traveling because the scenario doesn’t
usually last long. A person with T1DM who’s sick or is traveling through time
zones and is very tired is much better off with a blood glucose of 225 mg/dl
than a blood glucose of 25 mg/dl. A few days of above-normal glucose levels
don’t cause any lasting damage.
Dealing with Sick Days
Three of the basic tools of good diabetes care become even more important
when your child with T1DM is sick or traveling: frequent monitoring of the
blood glucose, careful food choices, and timely medication. During sickness,
blood glucose levels tend to be higher than expected and you can’t know that
unless you measure it. Food may be limited to a few items that your child can
tolerate, and he may need surprisingly more insulin than you expect, espe-
cially because he’s eating little.
Discuss how to handle illness with your child’s doctor before it happens.
Make a sick-day plan and find out the doctor’s rules for contacting him in
case of illness.

Children whose diabetes is under good control (that is, hemoglobin A1c is
less than 8 percent; see Chapter 7 for details) don’t develop illnesses any
more frequently than children without diabetes. In any case, preventing ill-
ness is much better than treating it. One major preventive measure is making
sure that your child gets a flu shot every year. This section covers other ways
to prevent and deal with illness in your child with T1DM.
Monitoring the blood glucose
You may think that a sick child should have lower blood glucose, especially if
he has nausea and vomiting. This isn’t the case, however. Don’t assume that
your child’s blood glucose falls because he can’t eat. Illness provokes the
body to secrete hormones such as cortisol and glucagon that tend to raise
the blood glucose. Illness also increases insulin resistance, so a given amount
of insulin doesn’t lower the blood glucose as much as usual.
When your child is sick, allowing looser control of his diabetes is perfectly
okay; a slightly higher blood glucose reading is safer than a reading that’s too
low. That said, it’s also true that the more the blood glucose is kept within
the normal range, the more rapidly a child (or an adult, for that matter) can
recover from any illness. White blood cells, which fight bacteria and viruses,
function much better when the blood glucose is normal.
Measure the blood glucose every two hours when your child is sick, and give
extra rapid-acting insulin if necessary. (Readings above 250 mg/dl require more
insulin, but don’t give it any more often than every four hours because a shot
lasts the same amount of time.) How much extra insulin you give depends
upon your child’s size, his usual insulin dose, and his response to insulin
when he’s sick. The smaller the usual dose, the smaller the increase needed
to keep the glucose under control. A fever that’s over 100 degrees F requires
an even greater increase in insulin, sometimes as much as 25 to 50 percent
more than usual.
A child who’s getting his basal insulin from long-acting insulin such as glargine
or detemir (see Chapter 10) may need a temporary increase in the dose of
that medication. If the blood glucose is higher throughout the day, more long-
acting insulin is indicated. The increase is proportional to the amount he’s
taking already. For example, a child taking 10 units of glargine may need 12
units during the illness, and a child taking 20 units may need 25 units during
the illness. Remember, these are approximations. Your child’s needs may be
different.
Is your child on an insulin pump (or are you, if you’re the patient)? Elevated
blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dl throughout the day suggest the need
for an increase in the basal rate. If his usual basal rate is 1 unit per hour, he
may go up to 3 units per hour during a period of illness. The blood glucose
252
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

should respond within one to two hours. If it doesn’t, he may not be getting
the insulin, and a switch to insulin shots temporarily may be in order. (Refer
to Chapter 11 for full details on using an insulin pump.) Talk to your child’s
doctor before making this switch.
One illness that may call for less insulin is gastroenteritis. The usual symp-
toms are vomiting and diarrhea, both of which decrease the amount of food
that stays in the body. And that means that the blood glucose may fall signifi-
cantly. If your child has gastroenteritis, measure his glucose every two hours,
and don’t give rapid-acting insulin if the glucose is below 100 mg/dl. You may
need to reduce the dose of long-acting insulin as well; the reduction is pro-
portional to how much he takes already. If your child can hold down small
sips of drinks containing glucose, such as apple juice or ginger ale, and can
maintain a glucose level over 100 mg/dl, he doesn’t need to go to the hospi-
tal. If he can’t do these things, call the doctor.
When the glucose goes up to 250 mg/dl or higher, you should measure the
urine ketones as I explain in Chapter 7, especially if your child’s vomiting. 
A high ketone reading is highly suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (see
Chapter 5). This is one reason to call your child’s doctor or take him to the
hospital emergency room. Other reasons include:
 Vomiting more than one time
 Diarrhea more than four times or persisting longer than 24 hours
 Stomach pain
 Rapid, hard breathing with a fruity odor to the breath
 Increasing weakness and drowsiness
As your child begins to eat normally and has a more normal temperature, 
and as his blood glucose stays down under 150 mg/dl, cut back on extra doses
of rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin, or the increased basal rate on a
pump. He should be back to baseline medication levels in two or three days.
Measuring blood ketones
Blood ketone testing may prove even more useful than urine ketone testing
during illness. It’s done with a finger stick drop of blood applied to a blood
ketone test strip. At present, only two home meters provide blood ketone
readings: the Precision Xtra Blood Glucose Meter (refer to Chapter 7) and 
the CardioChek Blood Testing Device (which can test blood glucose, blood
ketones, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when the proper 
test strip is used).
253
Chapter 15: Managing Illness and Travel

The advantage of blood ketone testing is similar to the advantage of blood
glucose testing: Ketones rise in the blood earlier than in the urine, so the ear-
lier the ketones are noted to be abnormal, the earlier treatment can proceed.
A study published in Diabetic Medicine in March 2006 showed a large reduc-
tion in patient time spent in the hospital when blood ketone testing was done
compared to urine ketone testing. Another advantage is the ease of obtaining
a drop of blood compared with urine from a small child.
The disadvantages at present are the cost (about $3 to $4 per test compared
to less than 20 cents for urine testing) and the fact that only two meters can
do the test.
If you test for ketones with the blood test, the interpretation for adults and
children is as follows:
 Above 1.5 mmol/L with high (greater than 250 mg/dl) blood glucose
means that your child is at high risk to develop diabetic ketoacidosis.
Call your doctor immediately.
 0.6 to 1.5 mmol/L with high blood glucose means less risk. Treat with
fluids and insulin, and let your doctor know that your child is showing
this level.
 Less than 0.6 mmol/L is normal.
Modifying the diet
Most illnesses in children don’t last more than a few days. During that time,
the emphasis should be on keeping the blood glucose from going too high
(above 250 mg/dl) or too low (below 80 mg/dl) — not on whether the child is
getting enough protein, fat, vitamins, or minerals. (See the previous section
for details on carefully monitoring the blood glucose during illness.)
If your child’s illness allows him to eat normally, by all means encourage that. If
he experiences nausea, vomiting, or both, focus on getting him carbohydrate
that’s rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream (see the following list). It’s also
important to keep him well hydrated, but he probably can’t tolerate a lot of
fluid at one time. Give him small sips of tea with sugar, fruit juice, or soft drinks
with real sugar, not diet drinks, encouraging him to drink four times an hour.
The following contain 15 grams of carbohydrate that’s rapidly absorbed:
 1 tablespoon honey
 4 teaspoons granulated white sugar
 1⁄2 cup fruit juice
 1⁄3 cup plain pudding
254
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 1⁄2 cup ice cream
 One small frozen juice bar
Give your child the honey or table sugar in particular if his glucose is low
(under 80 mg/dl). You can use the other items in the list to encourage some
nutrition when the child refuses to eat regular food.
If your child becomes dehydrated, give him a drink that consists of 4 cups
water, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons granulated white sugar. (If the child
has a blood glucose level over 250 mg/dl, reduce the amount of sugar in the
concoction to 1 tablespoon.) Give him 1 ounce of this drink per year of age
per hour. For example, an 8-year-old should drink 8 ounces of this drink per
hour or 2 ounces every 15 minutes. Adults can drink apple juice or ginger ale
to maintain their hydration.
Taking medications
If your child has a cough, you may want to give some over-the-counter medi-
cine to suppress it, but keep the following points in mind:
 A cough helps to get rid of secretions in the lungs that make breathing
more difficult, so you shouldn’t suppress it completely.
 Most over-the-counter cough preparations contain a lot of sugar and
alcohol. These ingredients may provide some of the calories the child is
missing, but they also may raise an already high blood glucose even
higher.
Many preparations of cough medicine don’t contain sugar, so read the
label! Also, if you see “DM” in the name of the medicine, it usually 
means that it doesn’t contain sugar.
 Many cough preparations contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or
phenylephedrine, all drugs that raise blood glucose. Read labels to 
make sure that you don’t buy a medication that contains any of these.
If your child has a fever, you can use acetaminophen (Tylenol) to bring it
down. If you or your child needs antibiotics, ones that lower the blood glu-
cose and are safe for folks with T1DM include chloramphenicol (brand name
Chloromycetin) and the sulfa drugs with brand names like Gantrisin, Septra,
and Bactrim.
Ibuprofen is sometimes used for inflammation, but it can cause kidney failure
in people with diabetes who already have kidney damage. Check with your
doctor before giving this to your child.
You can give your child medication for his illness at any time it’s needed
because it doesn’t interfere with his diabetes medications.
255
Chapter 15: Managing Illness and Travel

Traveling with Type 1 Diabetes
Traveling with a child is hard enough, but when the child also has T1DM, the
challenges are that much greater. Be sure to think about the considerations in
the following sections before you travel.
Carrying the necessities
Whether you travel by car, train, plane, or boat, make sure that the essentials
of diabetes care are easy to access. If you’re flying, all diabetes medications
and equipment must be in carry-on baggage. You definitely don’t want your
child’s insulin to end up in Chicago when you and he are in New York. In addi-
tion, checked luggage may be in an exceedingly cold part of the airplane, and
freezing destroys insulin.
You have to follow the rules of the Transportation Security Administration
(TSA) if you fly within the United States. (Airlines operating outside the U.S.
may have different rules; check with your airline before you travel overseas.)
The TSA instructs that you should “make sure injectable medications are
properly labeled (professionally printed label identifying the medication or a
manufacturer’s name or pharmaceutical label). Notify the screener if you are
carrying a hazardous waste container, refuse container, or a sharps disposable
container in your carry-on baggage used to transport used syringes, lancets,
etc.” Updated information is available at the TSA Web site, www.tsa.gov/
public/display?theme=1.
Although it’s not essential, a letter from your doctor stating that your child
has diabetes and needs to carry the following list of medication supplies and
testing equipment may be helpful and especially useful should he get sick
while traveling. Carry twice as much of each item as you think you’ll need;
supplies can get lost, or you may be delayed or decide to stay longer.
 Insulin (long-acting and rapid-acting for syringe injection if necessary)
 Syringes or insulin pens
 Insulin pump supplies
If your child uses an insulin pump, take an alternative form of insulin
administration (such as an insulin pen or a bottle of insulin and a
syringe) in case the pump breaks.
 Rapidly acting sugar source (glucose tablets are most convenient)
 Glucagon emergency kit with emergency shot (see Chapter 4)
 Medications for nausea (prochlorperazine) and diarrhea (loperamide)
256
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Medication for fever (acetaminophen)
 Glucose meter and spare batteries
 Test strips for glucose and ketones
 Lancets
 A container that allows you to keep insulin at the proper temperature,
whether it’s very cold or very hot
In addition, I recommend that you do the following:
 Carry the telephone numbers for your child’s health care providers at
home, and compile a list of English-speaking doctors at your destination
if possible. At the least, have the name and address of the local American
consulate and the local American Express office; either usually can
arrange for you to see English-speaking doctors.
Consider taking advantage of free membership in the International
Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers; on the association’s
Web site, www.iamat.org, you can sign up for membership and get the
names of English-speaking doctors in most countries. You don’t have to
be a member to read about the latest medical alerts and problems in
various countries.
 Make sure that your child is always wearing a bracelet or necklace iden-
tifying him as someone with T1DM.
 Take snacks to eat while traveling, and carry some bars or other pack-
aged food to eat after arriving, too.
 Check your insurance policy to make sure that it covers your child at your
destination. If it doesn’t, get coverage that does. (I discuss the basics of
insurance in Chapter 14.) Carry your insurance card, and leave photo-
copies of your card at your hotel.
Adjusting insulin intake in 
a different time zone
The old saying, “Go West, young man” could be altered to “Go West, young
person with type 1 diabetes.” When T1DM is involved, it’s a lot easier to
travel west than east over several time zones. Here are the differences in
insulin intake depending on your child’s time zone changes:
 You add hours to your day when you head west, so all your child has to
do is check his blood glucose an extra time or two and add short-acting
insulin to cover those hours. He doesn’t change the long-acting insulin
but resumes his usual schedule when he gets to the new time zone.
257
Chapter 15: Managing Illness and Travel

 When you head east, you lose hours. Given that, your child may have too
much insulin when the long-acting combines with the rapid-acting to
lower his blood glucose. He has to be proactive and reduce the long-
acting insulin he takes just before the trip. The rule is to reduce it by 
4 percent for every hour lost. For example, if his usual dose is 10 units 
of Lantus and he’s traveling east through six time zones, he should take
6 × 4 percent, or 24 percent less insulin. That comes to 71⁄2 units if the
insulin can be measured in 1⁄2 units, or just 7 units if it can’t be. Err on 
the side of conservatism. Give less rather than more insulin.
Folks using insulin pumps have the easiest time going through time zones. If
your child (or you) uses a pump, he should continue the basal insulin as
usual, taking boluses only when he eats meals. At the new time zone, he
should change the time on his pump so that his basal schedule corresponds
to the old time zone. (See Chapter 11 for details on using a pump.)
At your new time zone, no matter whether you’ve traveled east or west, your
child will undoubtedly feel sleepy if the difference is more than four hours.
Obviously, that’s jet lag. Get your child back on his usual regimen of long-acting
insulin but hold the rapid-acting insulin if he’s going to sleep through a meal.
I find that I can acclimate myself to the new time zone, especially the more
difficult eastern direction, if I exercise as early as possible in the new “morn-
ing.” Thirty minutes on a treadmill or elliptical trainer allows me to stay
awake in early morning meetings. Try this with your child to see if you 
both can overcome some jet lag. Early morning exercise also provides all 
the benefits of general exercise described in Chapter 9.
Eating sensibly
It’s very difficult to know how much carbohydrate your child is eating when
all the meals are in restaurants. You can start the trip carrying prepared
nutrition bars that tell you how much carbohydrate is in each one, but you
have to deal with unknown foods sooner or later.
If you’re traveling in the United States, get online and search the Web sites of
popular restaurant chains to see which ones exist at your destination. The
sites should contain a list of the nutritional values for all the chain’s menu
items. Record what looks okay for your child and note the carbohydrates so
that you can calculate his bolus dose for each meal.
Traveling outside the U.S. or eating in non-chain restaurants is a different
matter. You can simplify the problem by sticking to the following menu 
items (and avoiding the fried foods and rich desserts!):
258
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Breakfast: Fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, oatmeal, and whole-wheat toast with-
out butter are all good choices. Avoid pancakes or waffles with syrup.
 Lunch: Grilled chicken, tuna, fresh green salad, fresh steamed vegetables,
and egg salad without mayonnaise are all good choices. Avoid creamy
dressings high in fat.
 Dinner: Turkey, tuna, salmon, whitefish, grilled chicken, fresh green salad,
and fresh vegetables are all good choices.
Be careful about portions in restaurants. They’re usually too large, even the
children’s sizes. Educate yourself on proper portion sizes of meat, chicken,
pasta, and so forth before you leave home.
Of the various kinds of restaurants, probably the easiest place to find good
choices for your child is a seafood restaurant. Just focus on fish dishes and
stay away from fried anything (including French fries), tartar sauce, butter,
and creamy dressings.
Keep some meal replacement bars handy for the times when you can’t get to
a restaurant. You also can give them to your child as snacks between meals
to smooth out the blood glucose.
Alternately, you can try to stay in places where you have your own kitchen to
make meals in, such as an extended-stay hotel or a rental house. Of course,
making meals is hardly a vacation for you, but it won’t be the first (or last)
sacrifice you’ll make for your precious offspring.
Ensuring a smooth journey
Here are some additional pointers for having a safe and enjoyable trip with a
child with T1DM:
 Visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines to find out if your child (and you) needs
vaccines for any of the countries you’ll be visiting.
 If your child uses an insulin pump, consider switching him to insulin pens
that don’t require all the extras associated with the pump (like infusion
sets). Talk to his doctor about it, and make the switch at least a week
before you leave so that your child can transition smoothly in a setting
where everything is more or less under your control.
 Have supplies sent to your various destinations or brought along by
people you’ll be meeting there so that they’re fresh and you don’t have
to carry so much. (Bring enough supplies with you to handle any delays
you encounter in foreign customs.)
259
Chapter 15: Managing Illness and Travel

 Learn to say “My child has diabetes” (or “I have diabetes”) and “sugar or
orange juice, please” in the language of your destination.
 Don’t inject pre-meal insulin until the food comes on the plane or train.
 When traveling by air, have your child drink lots of fluids because airplane
travel is dehydrating.
 Check for air bubbles that tend to form in insulin pens as a result of
pressure differences in airplanes. Before using the pen, get rid of the
bubbles by pushing them out of the pen as the needle points up.
 If you have to depend on foreign sources of insulin when you arrive, make
sure that the insulin is U-100 (100 units per milliliter). U-40 and U-80 are
no longer used in the United States but are still used in some foreign
countries; if you can only get U-40 or U-80, you have to use U-40 or U-80
syringes to administer the proper dose.

E
very pregnant woman wants a healthy baby. Before insulin, girls with
diabetes rarely lived long enough to become pregnant, and if they did,
their babies usually didn’t survive. What a difference a hormone (insulin)
makes! Today, it’s possible for any woman with T1DM to become pregnant
and to deliver a beautiful, healthy baby who will probably never get diabetes.
There are a number of places along the pregnancy path where things can go
wrong, however. The point of this chapter is to alert you to those places and
get you past them with minimal difficulty.
There is one major factor that all pregnant women, diabetic or not, will agree
to. They will do anything in their power to ensure the health of their growing
baby. This makes excellent diabetes care during the time of pregnancy a lot
easier to accomplish. Before getting to the time of pregnancy, I want you to
understand what a healthy girl goes through to make her body ready for that
miraculous task and what may go wrong if you have T1DM.
After the years when pregnancy is possible, the woman with T1DM has spe-
cial challenges as she goes through menopause. Should she use hormone
replacement therapy? What are the special considerations for the woman
with T1DM as she ages so that she can enjoy a high quality of life for many
years? I cover all these issues in this chapter.

Understanding Normal Female 
Sexual Development
A lot has to happen to prepare the body of any female to carry a successful
pregnancy. It actually begins before birth and continues right up through
menarche, the time at which female periods begin. Although T1DM occurs
several years after birth, its effect on sexual development requires an under-
standing of how the female sex organs develop in the first place.
Starting before birth
Just six weeks after the baby is conceived, the presence or absence of a Y, or
male, sex chromosome (the collection of genes that determine the character-
istics of the body) leads to the production of testicles if present or ovaries if
absent. If absent, a set of tubules present in both males and females develops
into the female structures of the fallopian tubes that carry the egg to the
uterus.
The lack of testosterone in the female also causes the brain to develop female
sexual characteristics in a structure called the hypothalamus, which controls
many of the body’s glands, including ovaries in women and testicles in men.
At puberty, the hypothalamus starts the monthly cycles that continue until
menopause.
Continuing at puberty and adolescence
Puberty begins in girls around age 8 to 12. The hypothalamus causes the
release of hormones (chemical messengers) that cause widespread body
changes including the development of breasts, the rounding of the body seen
in females, and the onset of menstrual periods by age 12 or 13. A girl devel-
ops underarm hair growth and more secretions from oil and sweat glands.
During adolescence, the girl begins to go through the social and emotional
changes that end in adulthood. It starts around age 12 and ends around age
17. During this time, she may experience increased sexual behavior, including
masturbation and sexual intercourse.
Normal menstrual function requires the coordinated release of a hormone from
the hypothalamus, which causes release of hormones from the pituitary gland
in the brain, resulting in the formation of a follicle. A follicle is a round area of
cells in the ovary in which the egg rests waiting to be expelled at ovulation
each month. Prior to ovulation, the follicle produces estrogen.
262
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

After ovulation takes place, the follicle transforms into a corpus luteum,
which produces progesterone and estrogen, in order to prepare the uterus
for implantation of a fertilized egg. If the egg doesn’t get fertilized, proges-
terone secretion ceases and the uterus sheds its lining, producing a men-
strual period.
Controlling Type 1 Diabetes 
before Conception
In the following sections, you find out how to manage a number of the special
considerations of being a female with T1DM. I address specific topics includ-
ing how to handle your glucose during the ups and downs of menstruation,
how to prepare your body for a pregnancy, and how to get through the preg-
nancy with minimal trouble for you and your growing baby.
Handling blood glucose during 
your menstrual periods
Because sex organs are formed before the onset of T1DM in females, they’re
usually normal. However, several studies, including a paper in The Journal of
Diabetes Complications in July 2006, have shown that the onset of menstrua-
tion is delayed in girls with T1DM to an average age of 15 (a girl without T1DM
usually starts having periods around age 12 or 13). The earlier the onset of
diabetes, the later the onset of menstruation.
After you start to have periods, your blood glucose levels rise and your insulin
needs increase and then decrease as you go from day 1 to day 28 of your
menstrual cycle. The changes in blood glucose and insulin occur because of
the production of progesterone and estrogen until just before your period,
when they fall dramatically. (What’s the reason for this drop? If an ovulated
egg isn’t fertilized, progesterone secretion ceases and the uterus sheds its
lining, producing a menstrual period.)
Blood glucose control tends to be worse in women with premenstrual syn-
drome (PMS); one possible reason for the irregularity of the control is the
constellation of symptoms that accompany PMS: bloating, irritability, water
retention, depression, and craving for carbohydrates.
It can be challenging to manage insulin during your menstrual cycle. As always,
the best way to deal with this challenge is with more information — do more
blood glucose tests! Test before meals, an hour after meals, at bedtime, and
at 3 a.m., and adjust your insulin intake appropriately (see Chapter 10). You’ll
263
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

find that everything isn’t actually random but rather that there’s some sort of
pattern that you can adjust to. As you adjust your insulin intake to the pattern,
your overall control will improve as shown by lowering of the hemoglobin
A1c. Irregularity of periods tends to be greater as your hemoglobin A1c is
higher. The better you control your diabetes, the less this will be a problem.
(See Chapter 7 for full details on hemoglobin A1c and testing blood glucose.)
If you suspect that PMS is to blame for tough control of your blood glucose,
make some changes that may reduce the symptoms. Stick carefully to your
dietary program; avoid salt, alcohol, chocolate, and caffeine; and increase 
the amount of exercise you do.
Dealing with sexual dysfunction
As a woman with T1DM, you may not have any problems with sexual function
if you monitor and control your blood glucose tightly (especially after you
figure out its pattern in relation to your monthly cycle; see the previous sec-
tion). Women with poorly controlled T1DM, however, may have several prob-
lems with sexual function.
 They tend to have dryness of the vagina when the blood glucose is per-
sistently high, making sexual intercourse uncomfortable. Creams can
manage this problem; talk to your doctor.
 They may have a fungus infection of the vagina, leading to pain with
intercourse. Tight glucose control eliminates this problem. Antibiotics
can give only temporary relief if the poor diabetic control isn’t improved.
 They tend to have orgasms less often than non-diabetic women, proba-
bly because of decreased sensation in the clitoris. No treatment has
been consistently successful for this problem.
Getting a few tests if you’re 
thinking of getting pregnant
If you’re a woman with T1DM thinking of becoming pregnant, you must
undergo several tests before and during your pregnancy to ensure that 
you don’t develop or worsen diabetic complications and that your baby is
healthy at birth and stays healthy afterwards (see Chapter 7 for more about
these tests). They include:
 Hemoglobin A1c testing: Results should be less than 7 percent before
conception of the baby and stay that way throughout the pregnancy.
Hemoglobin A1c should be measured every one to two months because
the turnover of red blood cells is more rapid in a pregnancy, and there-
fore, the results will change more than normal during pregnancy.
264
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Kidney function testing: The test by urine microalbumin should be per-
formed on a normal basis before pregnancy and should be repeated once
each trimester during pregnancy.
 Eye examination: The examination should be normal before pregnancy,
and it should be done once each trimester during pregnancy.
 Thyroid function testing: This test is done with a thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH). It should be normal before pregnancy and conducted
once each trimester during pregnancy.
 Blood pressure: A blood pressure reading should be taken at each
doctor’s visit, and results should be normal.
 Weight assessment: Weight gain should be appropriate at each doctor’s
visit. When the weight is normal before pregnancy, the average weight
gain for a woman is about 25 pounds. If you’re underweight at the begin-
ning of the pregnancy, 30 pounds is recommended. If overweight, 20
pounds is suggested.
 Blood glucose: Your blood glucose level should be less than 90 mg/dl
before meals and less than 120 mg/dl at one hour after eating through-
out the pregnancy.
If you meet these criteria, it’s time to stop the contraceptive pills, hide the
condoms, or take out the IUD (intrauterine device) from your uterus. You’re
ready to have a baby! You’ll have no more trouble with your pregnancy than
if you didn’t have diabetes. Even if the criteria aren’t completely met, the
pregnancy may be normal. This is where working with a specialist who 
manages pregnancies in T1DM is very valuable.
The risks of conceiving before 
you have control of T1DM
So you’ve undergone some testing to see whether you’re ready to conceive,
but the doctor says that you need more control of your T1DM first. Thinking
of disregarding this warning? Think again! The following sections explain the
risks you pose to your baby and yourself if you don’t have control before
(and during) pregnancy. The bottom line: You can avoid all sorts of problems
if you control your T1DM as I explain earlier in this chapter and throughout
this book.
Risks to the baby
If a woman with T1DM conceives a child when her control is poor, the child is
at higher risk than normal of having a congenital malformation, often so severe
that it leads to a spontaneous abortion. Slightly less than 2 percent of normal
pregnancies have an associated malformation in the baby; a pregnancy in a
265
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

woman with diabetes increases the risk two or three times. Among the possi-
ble malformations are:
 Hernia of the brain
 Absence of parts of the brain, skull, and scalp
 Holes in the heart
 Small heart chambers
 Obstruction of the outlet from the heart to the blood vessels
 Severe narrowing of the major artery of the body
 Cysts on the spinal cord
 Failure of formation of the kidneys
 Cysts on the kidneys
 Abnormal closure of the duodenum or rectum
These congenital abnormalities don’t occur at this higher rate if the blood
glucose of the woman with T1DM is normal at the time of conception and for
eight weeks after that (which is how long it takes for the baby’s vital organs
to form).
When the baby has gotten past the first 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman
with T1DM, the greatest risk if the blood glucose still isn’t controlled is
macrosomia, a condition that produces a very large body with deposits of 
fat in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, and legs. The heart, liver, and spleen
are filled with fat. Macrosomia occurs because the baby is exposed to large
amounts of sugar. His pancreas works and releases large amounts of insulin,
the storage hormone. A baby who weighs more than 9 pounds and whose
mother has T1DM is considered to have macrosomia. Figure 16-1 shows the
appearance of a baby with macrosomia.
Figure 16-1:
A baby with
macrosomia.
266
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

These babies are difficult to deliver because of their size; they often require
cesarean sections (surgical removal of the baby through an abdominal and
then a uterine incision). A baby with macrosomia may be born early and is
premature even though he is so large. He may have to stay in the hospital
until he’s more mature. He may have breathing difficulties and will probably
need immediate feeding because he has been making so much insulin and no
longer has his mother’s glucose. The pediatrician evaluates the newborn for
specific problems and treats them.
Consistent elevation in the one-hour blood glucose after eating may be
responsible for macrosomia, even though the before-meal blood glucose 
is normal. Taking more insulin before meals manages this problem.
The baby of a woman with T1DM may have a number of other problems
related to poor control of the blood glucose. These include:
 Abnormally slow growth in the uterus, resulting in a poorly developed
baby at birth.
 Decreased diameter of the large intestine and rectum.
 Increased production of red blood cells to carry the increased oxygen
needed to metabolize all the extra glucose. All these extra blood cells can
clog the arteries and veins and cause strokes and obstruction in veins.
 Iron deficiency because the red blood cells use up all the available iron,
leaving organs like the heart and brain that need iron deficient.
 Hypoglycemia when the baby is separated from his mother. He continues
to make large amounts of insulin, but large quantities of glucose are no
longer available and his blood glucose falls. Several days of supplemental
glucose may be needed until his pancreas stops making so much insulin.
 Low blood levels of calcium and magnesium leading to spasms of the
hands and feet and abdominal cramps. At birth, the parathyroid gland
normally takes over regulation of calcium and magnesium, but in babies
of mothers with poorly controlled glucose, this gland is immature at birth.
 Respiratory distress syndrome, which is difficulty breathing as a result
of a lack of surfactant, a substance made in the lungs that keeps the air
tubes open for breathing. Surfactant requires cortisol from the adrenal
gland, but the large amount of glucose in the baby’s circulation during
the pregnancy suppresses the production of cortisol. The more imma-
ture the baby, the worse the problem is, so delivering the baby as late 
as possible is very important.
 Jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin is the breakdown product
of hemoglobin and is normally eliminated by the liver. The baby’s large
amount of red blood cells greatly increases the amount of bilirubin that
the liver must handle. The necessary enzymes that the liver needs to
handle the bilirubin aren’t made in sufficient quantity in babies of women
267
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

with poorly controlled T1DM. Bilirubin can cause brain damage if pre-
sent in large enough amounts. Before that can happen, treatment with
light rapidly lowers the bilirubin level.
 Neurologic problems including sleepiness, poor feeding, and decreased
mental capacity as a result of the hypoglycemia, low calcium, high biliru-
bin, and increased red blood cells discussed in the previous bullets.
Risks to the mother
The greatest risks during pregnancy exist for women with T1DM who already
have complications before becoming pregnant. Here are some examples of
preexisting complications and what happens to them:
 Proliferative retinopathy (see Chapter 5) at conception will progress in
more than half of women.
 Significant diabetic kidney disease (marked by more than 250 mg of
albumin in the urine every 24 hours) will rapidly worsen in about half 
of mothers during pregnancy.
 Diabetic nerve disease may worsen with increased loss of sensation in
the feet.
 High blood pressure may become worse during pregnancy. This decreases
the blood supply to the fetus.
 About 30 percent of women with T1DM have thyroid autoantibodies and
may develop hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hor-
mones) during pregnancy.
Using contraception until 
you’re under control
Until you achieve control of your T1DM and are officially ready to conceive
(meaning that your doctor has given you the go-ahead), the wisest course of
action is to use contraception. For purposes of contraception, the first day of
your menstrual cycle is the first day of bleeding; between the 8th and 18th
days, you’re most fertile and likely to become pregnant if you have unpro-
tected sex, so contraception is absolutely crucial during this time. You’re
most fertile for 24 hours before ovulation and a few hours after ovulation.
You can determine ovulation by taking your body temperature. When it rises
0.2 degrees F and persists at that level, ovulation has occurred. If it rises
again a few days later and persists, conception has likely occurred.
As a woman with T1DM, you have the same choices of contraception as a
woman without diabetes. These include:
268
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Condoms, which also protect against sexually transmitted diseases.
 Contraceptive implants that are removable if necessary.
 Depot injections of progesterone. These may cause an increase in blood
glucose and can’t be removed until they’re used up, which may take
months, even if you experience side effects of nausea and increased
appetite.
 Diaphragm and spermicidal jelly.
 Intrauterine device, which sometimes causes infections and loss of 
uterine function and therefore isn’t used until after a first pregnancy.
 Minipills consisting of progesterone alone, which may increase spotting.
 Morning-after pills like Plan B, which must be taken within 72 hours of
unprotected sex.
 Oral contraceptives, which are a combination of small doses of estrogen
and progesterone, and not recommended for smokers, people with high
blood pressure, or those who suffer from migraine headaches.
Oral contraceptives are the method of choice for younger women with T1DM,
and an IUD is recommended for women with T1DM who have had a child.
Ensuring a Safe Pregnancy and Delivery
Tight control in pregnancy means achieving a blood glucose level that is as
close to normal as possible using insulin, diet, and exercise, just as in the
person with T1DM who is not pregnant.
A study in Diabetes Care in August 2001 showed that a normal pregnant woman
without diabetes will have a blood glucose of between 55 mg/dl and 105 mg/dl
one hour after meals from the 28th to the 38th week. The study also measured
the abdominal circumference of the fetus by ultrasound and found that the
higher the one-hour glucose, the larger the abdominal circumference.
More recently, a study that has not yet been published was reported at the
Scientific Meetings of the American Diabetes Association in June 2007. Called
the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, it showed
that even pregnant women with no evidence of diabetes by glucose testing at
the beginning of the study could develop complications similar to those in
pregnant women with T1DM if their blood glucose rose above normal fre-
quently during the pregnancy, even when they didn’t reach the criteria for
diabetes. High birth weights correlated with high blood glucose levels.
Tight control of type 1 diabetes in pregnancy means achieving a blood glucose
level that’s as close to normal as possible using insulin, diet, and exercise,
just as in the person with T1DM who isn’t pregnant. Pregnant women with no
269
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

diabetes normally have blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels lower than
non-pregnant women because the fetus takes so much of the glucose. The
goal is to achieve these levels in the pregnant woman with diabetes.
Ideally, because macrosomia (see the earlier section “Risks to the baby” for
more about this condition) is found when the one-hour blood glucose is con-
sistently greater than 120 mg/dl, and normal pregnant women without diabetes
have a hemoglobin A1c level up to 5 percent, the desirable levels are
 Blood glucose less than 90 mg/dl before meals
 Blood glucose less than 120 mg/dl at 1 hour
 Hemoglobin A1c no greater than 5 percent
How do you achieve these goals? Read the following sections to find out.
Using insulin during and after pregnancy
In order to keep the glucose normal, more insulin is required throughout a
pregnancy, and this increase drops rapidly after giving birth. Because the
goal is a blood glucose level of less than 90 mg/dl before meals and less than
120 mg/dl one hour after meals, it’s necessary to test before meals, an hour
after meals, and at bedtime daily. This frequency of testing gives you the
opportunity to treat high blood glucose or eat for low blood glucose.
Here are a couple of exceptions to the usual increased need for insulin during
pregnancy:
 At about the 9th to 11th week of the pregnancy: At this time, the ovaries
stop making progesterone and the uterus takes over. There may be a
brief period (lasting eight to ten days) during which your insulin require-
ment falls. This is a time to do more testing, especially before bedtime
and at 3 a.m. to avoid overnight hypoglycemia if you don’t reduce your
insulin temporarily.
 At 37 weeks: Your uterus begins to contract, and you start to burn glu-
cose that way. You should test your blood glucose at bedtime and at
3 a.m., and lower your bedtime insulin if the overnight glucose falls to
less than 70 mg/dl.
You can use whatever method of insulin delivery you like, but one method
that has been successful during pregnancy is the insulin pump (see Chapter
11). It allows for easy treatment if the blood glucose gets too high or too low.
The trouble with the insulin pump is the rapid development of ketoacidosis if
insulin isn’t being given as a result of blockage, leakage, or some other prob-
lem with the pump.
270
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

Ketoacidosis in the mother is very dangerous for the fetus and often leads to
fetal loss. If you feel nauseated, check your blood ketones. See Chapter 15 for
coverage of this test.
Among the various kinds of insulin, the newer long-acting insulins (insulin
glargine and insulin detemir) haven’t been used in large numbers of pregnant
women with T1DM, although the experience with insulin glargine is probably
large enough, at this time, to recommend its use. Insulin NPH has been the
standard longer-acting insulin up to now. As for rapid-acting insulin, there’s
plenty of experience with insulin lispro and insulin aspart use in pregnant
women, and these are used commonly in this situation as the rapid-acting
component of the insulin treatment.
Immediately after delivery, as a result of the drop in hormones, your insulin
needs drop below what you needed before the pregnancy. However, as the
pituitary gland produces prolactin to stimulate breast milk, your insulin needs
increase. You may find that you need less long-acting insulin and more rapid-
acting insulin when you breast-feed.
A number of insulin treatment schedules are available for controlling the blood
glucose throughout and after the pregnancy. You should work with your dia-
betes doctor to develop the one that works for you. This isn’t something that
can or should be done on your own.
Managing your diet
The amount of carbohydrate in the diet plays a large role in a person’s blood
glucose level. As long as the percentage of carbohydrate in a meal is kept
below 40 percent, the one-hour blood glucose will remain under 120 mg/dl.
See Chapter 8 for the full scoop on eating carbohydrates.
Dividing your total daily calories over three meals and three snacks helps
keep your blood sugar down. If you divide your total daily calories into 12
parts, you can eat 3⁄12 at each meal and 1⁄12 at each snack. Make sure that you
take one of the snacks at bedtime to avoid overnight hypoglycemia.
Another important factor is the weight of the mother before pregnancy and
the amount of weight gain during pregnancy. If the mother’s weight is more
than 11⁄2 times her ideal body weight (100 pounds for 5 feet of height plus
5 pounds for every inch over 5 feet) before the pregnancy, she should gain
no more than 15 to 20 pounds during the pregnancy to avoid a large infant
birth weight. If her weight is in the ideal range (the ideal weight plus or minus
10 percent), she should gain 20 to 25 pounds; if she’s underweight, she
should gain 25 to 30 pounds.
271
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

Figuring out how to manage your diet and weight during pregnancy can be
daunting. Make use of the knowledge of a good dietitian who’s a Certified
Diabetes Educator. He or she can take you through what you need to know
and be there when you have questions. See Chapter 2 for help in finding a
diabetes educator.
Adding exercise
Pregnant women with T1DM don’t use exercise to bring down their blood glu-
cose but rather to improve cardiovascular fitness, reduce the stress of the
pregnancy, and put them in excellent physical condition for the strains of labor.
The best exercise is probably a low-impact program like walking 30 minutes
daily to avoid any stress on the fetus. Get your significant other to join you 
so you’ll be well on your way to setting a great example for your newborn, or
use the time to catch up with a friend. Flip to Chapter 9 for more about exer-
cising with T1DM.
Monitoring your baby
Your obstetrician should set up the plan for monitoring your baby during the
pregnancy. You have ultrasound studies at regular intervals to follow the
growth and development of the fetus.
Dealing with Type 1 Diabetes 
during Menopause
Menopause can be an even more difficult transition than the onset of men-
strual periods for several reasons. Here are a few key changes associated
with menopause:
 It’s preceded by the perimenopausal years when there’s a great deal of
irregularity in your menstrual periods due largely to hormone fluctua-
tions that affect your blood glucose.
 Estrogen, which makes the body more sensitive to insulin, declines
during menopause, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity.
 Other illnesses of aging begin to be develop, such as osteoporosis and
heart disease.
272
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 If your diabetes hasn’t been controlled, complications including eye dis-
ease, kidney disease, and nerve disease (see Chapter 5) complicate con-
trol. For example, visual difficulties may make exact administration of
insulin more difficult, and gastroparesis due to autonomic neuropathy,
which slows emptying of the stomach, may make it harder to judge the
correct insulin dose and when to take it.
 The symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, sweating, and flushing,
may be confused with symptoms of hypoglycemia.
The way you manage this difficult time is no different from managing your
diabetes at any other time: insulin, diet, and exercise, along with lots of self-
testing of the blood glucose. You have one other consideration during
menopause, however: the question of hormone replacement therapy.
One question that may occur to you as you reach this passage from menstrual
function to menopause is whether your T1DM needs to be as well-controlled
at age 51 as it was at age 31. The answer is a definitive yes. You may have 30
or more years of life ahead of you, so you definitely don’t want to be blind in
ten years or on hemodialysis for kidney failure at age 60. There are plenty of
women and men with T1DM in their 70s and 80s who are free of complications
of diabetes and live high-quality lives.
Sticking to good habits
Here are some key considerations for living with T1DM at this stage of your
life:
 Test your blood glucose before meals and at bedtime to determine the
right dose of insulin.
 Don’t allow yourself to gain a lot of weight, adding insulin resistance to
lack of insulin. As your metabolism declines with aging, you may have 
to eat less and exercise more to maintain your weight.
 Keep exercising to maintain your physical fitness. Don’t neglect your
muscle strength; weight training with moderate weights of 5 or 10
pounds increases your strength, stamina, and balance.
 Keep up the tests recommended in Chapter 7 to find any new problems
associated with your diabetes at the earliest possible time.
 Stay on top of screening tests like Pap smears, mammography, and so
forth so that you don’t add problems like cervical cancer or breast cancer
to an already full plate.
 Get an annual flu shot and shots to prevent pneumonia and shingles.
273
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

Considering hormone replacement therapy
In recent years, medical experts have gone from recommending hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) to all postmenopausal women, to condemning it
as a source of all kinds of problems like heart attacks, to a more subtle recon-
sideration that’s currently taking place, so I don’t blame you if you’re confused
about this subject. Because these hormones have a definite effect on your
blood glucose control, you need to understand what they do and whether
they’re for you.
The purpose of HRT
With the onset of menopause, you’re at risk for some or all of the following
symptoms:
 Hot flashes
 Vaginal dryness
 Sleeplessness
 Irritability
 Short-term memory loss
 Fatigue
Some of these symptoms mimic hypoglycemia, and unless you test your
blood glucose, you may eat extra calories, thinking that you’re treating 
that condition.
Having T1DM along with menopause adds several other problems that make
your blood glucose even more difficult to control; they include:
 Bacterial and yeast infections
 Urinary tract infections
Because all these symptoms seem to arise from a lack of the hormones estro-
gen and progesterone, it seems logical to replace them to reverse the prob-
lems. Hormone replacement therapy was the standard treatment for all these
conditions up until 2002. It also was thought to protect women against osteo-
porosis and heart disease.
Controversies about HRT
In July 2002, a key study was published in The Journal of the American Medical
Association under the title “Risks and Benefits of Estrogen Plus Progestin in
Healthy Postmenopausal Women: Principal Results From the Women’s Health
Initiative Randomized Controlled Trial.” The report provided the following
conclusions about postmenopausal women who took HRT compared to those
who did not. The users had
274
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 A small increase in cases of breast cancer
 A small excess of heart attacks
 A small excess of strokes
 A small excess of blood clots in veins
 A small decrease in bone fractures
 A small decrease in cancer of the large intestine
The study had an immediate and enormous effect. Millions of women taking
HRT stopped taking it. A typical study in The Archives of Gynecology and
Obstetrics in August 2007 showed that the number of prescriptions for HRT
dropped from 1,272 per month in July 2002 to 493 per month in July 2005 at
one medical center.
Since these studies and findings, there has been some reconsideration of the
rush to stop using HRT. Much of it has to do with problems in the 2002 study,
especially the fact that most of the women using HRT began taking it years
after they went into menopause rather than the usual custom of starting it 
at menopause. By age 60, women have had time to develop many of the 
conditions that were found in excess in that study; it’s possible that HRT
wasn’t responsible for the increases because it was given later than it 
should have been.
However, there has been a significant decrease in the incidence of breast
cancer since HRT usage declined in the U.S., and many experts believe that
the reduction in use of HRT is the explanation. The decline was noted in 2003.
It’s difficult to believe that a disease that takes decades to develop like breast
cancer can decline after just a year of decreased use of HRT, but the experts
believe that the decline was in the cancers that depended on estrogen in HRT
for growth. Given that the incidence of breast cancer increased in every year
for 20 years up to 2002, it’s hard to argue with the findings.
Deciding whether to use HRT
HRT can be used short term, for five years or less, without being clearly asso-
ciated with the abnormalities described in the previous section. The people
who can benefit from short-term use of HRT are
 Women with debilitating hot flashes, especially if they disturb sleep
 Women with vaginal dryness and hot flashes
HRT manages both these conditions. If vaginal dryness is present but
not hot flashes, local estrogen preparations can be given.
275
Chapter 16: Going through Pregnancy and Menopause

The women who shouldn’t take HRT at this time are
 Women with any history of breast cancer
 Women with any history of heart attacks or strokes
 Women with a history of deep vein thrombosis
Should the woman with T1DM take HRT? My answer is if she does not fall into
the second group or has debilitating hot flashes making control of her diabetes
difficult, this could be a short-term consideration. If the HRT allows her to
achieve good control of the diabetes with hemoglobin A1c levels under 7 per-
cent, the benefits of short-term therapy outweigh the risks. If you’re at all
considering whether to use HRT, be sure to talk to your doctor.
If a woman with T1DM goes on HRT, she must continue regular mammograms
and checks of her cervix. Any irregular bleeding should be reported to the
doctor.
Many other treatments can be used if osteoporosis is the only reason for 
considering HRT. Among the safe treatments for women with T1DM are
 Reloxifine, a selective estrogen receptor modulator that preserves
bone. Side effects include hot flashes and blood clots.
 Alendronate and risindronate, both belonging to a chemical group
called bisphosphonates that prevent fractures and slow bone loss.
 Calcitonin, a naturally occurring hormone that increases bone mass and
prevents bone loss. It’s used for people who have definite osteoporosis
at least five years after menopause.
 Teriparatide, a form of parathyroid hormone that may reverse bone
loss.
 Vitamin D and calcium, necessary for bone formation.
If you’re considering HRT only to protect yourself again heart disease associ-
ated with T1DM, you may want to reconsider. There are a number of things
you can do instead, such as the following:
 Stop smoking or any use of tobacco.
 Control your blood pressure (less than 120/80 for diabetic patients).
 Lose weight through diet and exercise.
 Control your cholesterol (LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dl and a
ratio of total to HDL or good cholesterol less than 4.5).

Controlling Type 1 Diabetes 
in the Elderly
In This Chapter
 Diagnosing type 1 diabetes in the elderly
 Understanding management challenges upfront
 Treating type 1 diabetes effectively
 Putting resources to use
S
eniors are a special breed, and there are more and more of them with
each passing year. At the present time the U.S. population is 300 million,
more or less. The government’s projection is that by 2050 there will be 400
million Americans. Currently more than 45 million Americans are older than
65. By 2050 there will be more than 98 million, of whom over 18 million will be
older than 85 and almost a million older than 100!
The prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is currently about 1 in 300
Americans, with most of those folks under age 65. Thanks to modern medical
advances, however, more and more people with T1DM are reaching senior
status. (Although the definition of “senior” keeps changing as I get older, the
government uses age 65 and older for statistical purposes.) The prevalence
of T1DM by 2050 will be more than 325,000 in the population over age 65 (by
then, there will be more than 98 million people older than 65).That’s going to
create a huge problem requiring enormous resources.
If you’re growing older with T1DM or are the spouse or child of an elderly
person with T1DM, there’s a lot to know about managing the disease at this
stage in life. For many reasons that I explain in this chapter, it’s very different
from managing T1DM when your child is 10, otherwise healthy, and has his
whole life ahead of him.
A key point is that you can now expect to reach senior status with T1DM. 
In fact, so many have done so that the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard
University along with the Eli Lilly Company (which first manufactured insulin
for human use) have been giving medals to people who have been on 
insulin successfully for 25, 50, and now 75 years (since insulin has only been

available since 1921). With so many people with T1DM now living so long,
they may have to rethink their free medals. (See the nearby sidebar “The
Joslin Diabetes Center: Painting a picture of seniors with type 1 diabetes” for
more information.)
Making a Diagnosis
T1DM typically appears during childhood, but it’s not unheard of for T1DM to
make its first appearance after a person reaches age 65. In the following sec-
tions, I explain the symptoms of T1DM in a senior, certain conditions that are
connected to the onset of T1DM, and the testing required to confirm a 
diagnosis.
278
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 
The Joslin Diabetes Center: Painting a 
picture of seniors with type 1 diabetes
The Joslin Diabetes Center was kind enough to
publish its findings with respect to the 50-year
medal winners in Diabetes Care in August 2007.
These results can help you to understand what
you need to do to reach that diabetes mile-
stone, too.
The center sent questionnaires to 500 of their
medalists and got useful replies from 326. They
break down as follows:
 54.7 percent of respondents were female.
 The mean age at the time of the study was
69.5 to 78 years.
 The mean age at diagnosis was 12.6 to 19.7
years.
 The median A1c level was 7.0 percent up to
10.8 percent (see Chapter 7 for more about
hemoglobin A1c).
 The average insulin dose was 0.227 units
per pound of weight (so a 125-pound
woman was using 28 units and a 150-pound
man was using 34 units).
 The mean HDL cholesterol level (the “good”
kind) was 67.7 mg/dl.
In the survey, 174 people reported microvascu-
lar complications (eye disease, kidney disease,
and nerve disease; see Chapter 5 for details).
They differed from those without complications
in the following ways:
 Their triglyceride levels were higher.
 Their insulin doses were higher.
 They had lower HDL cholesterol levels.
However there was no difference between the
people who did and did not have microvascular
complications in the following parameters:
 Age
 Duration of diabetes
 Hemoglobin A1c
 Body mass index
 Total cholesterol
 LDL (bad) cholesterol
Current physical activity was highly correlated
with no microvascular complications, and reg-
ular exercise was protective when the HDL cho-
lesterol wasn’t high.

Surveying symptoms
The elderly often experience many symptoms that mimic the acute and
chronic complications of diabetes. However, they may be due to other ill-
nesses, the aging process, or diabetes. Among these symptoms are the 
following:
 Anxiety
 Confusion
 Constipation
 Decreased sexual interest
 Depression
 Falls
 Loss of appetite
 Tiredness
 Tremors
 Urinary tract infections
 Weakness
279
Chapter 17: Controlling Type 1 Diabetes in the Elderly
In terms of the individual complications,
 139 people (47.9 percent) reported retinopathy.
Those without retinopathy had T1DM longer,
were older, and had lower triglycerides.
 22 people (6.7 percent) reported nephropa-
thy. These people were younger at the time
of their diagnosis and had higher body mass
index values, lower hemoglobin A1c levels,
and higher triglyceride levels. They also had
heart problems more often.
 164 people (50 percent) reported neuropa-
thy. These people had lower HDL levels,
used more insulin, had higher triglycerides,
and had more heart disease.
Many studies in the medical literature report
that the prevalence of retinopathy is more than
90 percent in patients with T1DM. Also, of
course, it’s an accepted fact that microvascular
complications result from poor control of the
blood glucose, yet among the patients in the
Joslin survey, those with poor control had 
no greater prevalence of complications. The
authors suggest that these people have some-
thing that protects them from diabetic compli-
cations. The mean HDL level may be one reason
because it’s considerably higher than usual for
T1DM, and levels that high have been shown 
to protect against many causes of death.
In summary, the study is good news for people
with T1DM. It shows that
 You can live a long time without complications.
 Exercise is an important component of long
life with uncomplicated diabetes.
 A high HDL cholesterol is important as well.

If you have these symptoms, don’t assume that they’re due to old age. Ask
your doctor to consider other possibilities such as T1DM. It’s important to
make the right diagnosis (see the next section for information on confirming
T1DM with testing).
Many of these symptoms also may be brought on by the medications you’re
taking. A long list of “potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly”
can be found on the Internet at www.dcri.duke.edu/ccge/curtis/
beers.html. (It’s pulled from an article that was published in the Archives 
of Internal Medicine in December 2003.) Check the list and see if your medica-
tions are there. If they are, discuss with your doctor whether you can substi-
tute something for the “inappropriate” medication or even stop it with no ill
effects.
Conditions connected to the 
onset of type 1 diabetes
The following diseases and conditions are associated with the onset of T1DM
in the elderly:
 Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas, which can destroy the
functional pancreas
 Excessive alcohol use, which can destroy the functional pancreas
 Cancer in the pancreas, which can significantly reduce insulin production
 Surgical removal of the pancreas, which brings on T1DM
 Gallstones, which can lead to pancreatic destruction
 Abnormally high calcium in the blood
 Traumatic injury in the area of the pancreas
In addition, aging is associated with the development of insulin resistance.
Not only must the person with T1DM take insulin shots, but they’re not as
effective as when he was younger. This may be a time when certain drugs
that would not be used in T1DM at a younger age may be helpful, as I discuss
in the later section, “Medications.”
Confirming the diagnosis with testing
Making a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in the elderly is done in the same way
as it’s done in younger people (see Chapter 2 for details). Two or more blood
glucose levels over 126 mg/dl in the fasting state or over 200 mg/dl after feed-
ing is diagnostic.
280
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

Some have suggested using the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) to diagnose
T1DM in the elderly because blood glucose levels usually don’t rise so high
and the threshold for spilling glucose in the urine rises with age. A hemoglo-
bin A1c greater than 7 percent is highly suggestive of diabetes, and it can be
confirmed by the fasting or fed blood glucose.
T1DM comes on a lot less rapidly in the elderly than it does in children. Seniors
may be far less sick, so the onset is much less dramatic. In addition, the many
confusing symptoms in the elderly may cause you to look elsewhere and not
think of diabetes as a possible diagnosis. That’s why it’s so important to
screen for diabetes annually beginning at age 35.
Recognizing the Challenges of Managing
Type 1 Diabetes in the Elderly
In this section, you discover how the elderly differ from younger patients in
the way they present their signs and symptoms of diabetes. Many elderly are
unable to care for themselves because of their physical and mental limita-
tions; I tell you how to measure their limitations and decide whether they’re
severe enough to require nursing or other care.
Realizing how the elderly 
differ from other patients
Managing T1DM in the elderly compares to managing T1DM in children in the
same way that managing traffic in Times Square, New York, compares to man-
aging traffic in Broken Bow, Nebraska. There’s a lot more going on in the
elderly.
The differences between the elderly and younger people with T1DM play a
major role in complicating diabetes management. The following points apply
to the elderly:
 They may be forgetful and fail to take medications, check blood glucose
levels, exercise, or eat properly. (See the next section for information
on determining whether you or your loved one can take care of his
T1DM.)
 They may take three to seven other drugs in addition to insulin. Some
of the drugs may interact with the insulin, and some may just cause con-
fusion in timing of doses.
 They often have decreased sensations of taste and smell, so they
aren’t interested in food.
281
Chapter 17: Controlling Type 1 Diabetes in the Elderly

 They often have poor teeth and a dry mouth. The poor teeth may make
diabetic control more difficult.
 They have reduced kidney function.
 They often live alone and have no one to help them.
 They may not recognize hypoglycemia. (If you don’t recognize it either,
see Chapter 4.)
 They may be unable to afford their medications and may have to spend
their limited resources on an inexpensive diet that’s rich in fat rather
than more low-glycemic carbohydrate and protein. (I discuss resources
for patients on fixed incomes later in this chapter.)
 They may be physically unable to give themselves insulin shots with a
syringe and needle.
 They’re less physically fit and less physically active than younger
people.
 They have reduced muscle mass and increased fat mass.
 They’re more sensitive to drugs due to slower metabolism.
 They may have poor vision and be unable to measure their insulin
properly. Vision trouble may be due to cataracts or glaucoma, both of
which are treatable.
Determining an elderly patient’s ability 
to treat his own type 1 diabetes
T1DM can cause a reduction in intellectual function resulting from reduced
blood flow to the brain, inflammation often found in diabetes, and hypo-
glycemia. A reduction in brain function due to diabetes can lead to behaviors
that are detrimental to the health of the patient, so it’s very important to
have an idea of the elderly patient’s ability to perform self-care for his T1DM.
To make this assessment, some form of testing of intellectual function is very
valuable. It can be done at age 70 when the person is at the beginning stages
of “elderly” and should be repeated at intervals, perhaps annually, to evalu-
ate mental functioning on an ongoing basis.
An excellent test that takes just a few minutes is called the Mini-Mental State
Examination. You can administer it to your loved one or even take it yourself.
It was first used in 1975, and its usefulness has been validated many times
since then. The Mini-Mental State Examination tests
 Whether the person knows the correct time (day and year) and where
he is (address, city and state)
282
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Whether the person can repeat items, read, write, draw, calculate, name
items, and remember items previously named
Figure 17-1 shows a typical Mini-Mental State Examination with the scoring
system.
A score of less than 26 (out of 30 total points) means that the person may
have trouble caring for himself. You may need a nurse in the home, or the
person may have to go to an assisted living facility or a nursing home.
Effectively Treating Type 1 
Diabetes in the Elderly
Treatment of T1DM in the elderly is even more challenging than it is in younger
people for the many reasons described in the earlier section “Realizing how
the elderly differ from other patients.” Namely, it’s difficult to keep them on a
diet, have them get an adequate amount of exercise, and make sure they get
their insulin in the correct doses. I provide some suggestions for effective
treatment in the following sections.

Medications
Insulin remains the standard of care for the elderly person with T1DM (I dis-
cuss insulin use in full detail in Chapter 10). It may not be possible to achieve
excellent blood glucose control, though. Attempting to force a hemoglobin
A1c of 7 percent or less on the patient at this age may lead to a significant
reduction in the quality of life, with multiple episodes of hypoglycemia. You
and your doctor have to decide whether you’re going to try for basic or
intensive care with your insulin administration.
 Basic care means avoiding excessive urination and thirst. This allows
you to get a good night’s sleep and feel rested. An elderly person with
multiple significant medical conditions who isn’t expected to live very
long should receive this level of care. The goal of the treatment is to
keep the blood glucose under 200 mg/dl. This can be done with a single
shot of insulin glargine in the morning and moderate amounts of rapid-
acting insulin before meals. An even simpler regimen may be two shots
of a mixture of short- and intermediate-acting insulin daily. These come
in insulin pens and are easy to administer.
 Intensive care means trying to lower the hemoglobin A1c below 
7 percent to prevent microvascular complications. This is done for the
elderly person with T1DM who’s expected to live long enough to develop
microvascular complications (eye, kidney, and nerve disease) if not
treated intensively. These days, that could include the 80- or 90-year old.
It may be necessary to accept some hypoglycemia in order to accom-
plish this level of care.
An insulin pump (see Chapter 11) may be useful in intensive care
because it reduces the amount that you have to remember in order to
administer the right amount of insulin.
You must test your blood glucose if you use insulin. Study after study has
concluded that the more a person with T1DM tests, the better their blood
glucose control. In addition, your doctor should regularly test your hemoglo-
bin A1c (every three months), your microalbumin (at least annually), your
weight and blood pressure (every visit), and your blood fats (at least annu-
ally). I describe all these tests in Chapter 7.
In view of the increasing insulin resistance in the elderly, consideration should
be given to using the drug metformin, which lowers the release of glucose from
the liver. It’s given at a dose of 500 to 1000 mg three times daily with meals.
Other drugs said to be insulin sensitizers (that is, they make you more sensitive
to your insulin), such as the thiazoledinedione class that includes rosiglitazone
and pioglitazone, are associated with a number of side effects that, I believe,
make them dangerous. They cause weight gain, anemia, and osteoporosis, and
rosiglitazone has been shown to cause early heart attacks. I don’t recommend
their use.
284
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

It’s a good idea to bring your medications to the doctor’s office every time
you go and to keep a list of your medicines with you at all times in case you
find yourself in an emergency room unexpectedly. When you see your doctor,
don’t hesitate to take all your medications out and ask the doctor whether
you still need to take each one or if you can lower your dose. Any time you
can accomplish either, you will benefit.
Nutrition
Despite the huge increase in the number of elderly people with both T1DM and
T2DM, there are few studies of proper nutrition specific to that age group —
most recommendations are based on younger patients. But experts do know
that a major concern with respect to nutrition in the elderly is malnutrition,
which results from inadequate amounts of calories and consuming too much
of the wrong foods. The often-limited resources of the elderly cause them to
have to choose between eating good foods, buying all their medications, and
spending money on occasional pleasures like a book or a movie. This isn’t a
medical problem but rather a social and economic problem, and it’s not easily
fixed. (I provide some resources to help combat this problem later in this
chapter.)
The following are some nutritional recommendations that are reasonable and
doable for the elderly patient with T1DM:
 Take a multivitamin and a mineral tablet daily to ensure that you’re
getting adequate quantities of essential nutrients.
 Consume a diet in which the carbohydrate content makes up 40 to 50
percent of calories. This recommendation is reasonable based on 
successful control of blood glucose in other patients.
 Keep the levels of saturated fats down and monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats up for a healthier diet; these fats should repre-
sent about 30 percent of your daily calories.
 Stick to a level of protein that’s 15 to 20 percent of daily calories. This
amount strikes a balance between too much protein that may hurt the
kidneys and too little protein resulting in loss of muscle.
 Get at least 20 grams of fiber in your daily diet.
 Avoid a low-sugar diet. It won’t improve your glucose control and may
cause weight loss because of the lack of taste in the food.
 Keep your teeth in good condition to make eating easier and to avoid
infections that complicate T1DM. Brush, floss, and visit the dentist
twice a year.
Flip to Chapter 8 for general information on eating a healthy diet.
285
Chapter 17: Controlling Type 1 Diabetes in the Elderly

Exercise
Time and again I’ve been told by an elderly person with T1DM that he can’t
exercise because he
 Has joint problems
 Has chest pain
 Has no time
 Doesn’t enjoy it
 Can’t catch his breath
These are some of the reasons that an exercise program must be developed
at a young age and maintained throughout life. The description of the Joslin
Medal Winners in the sidebar earlier in this chapter shows that the ones who
lived longest were the ones who exercised for the longest period of their
lives.
At the very least, walk for 30 minutes every day if possible. If you have any
problems with balance, using a stationary cycle or doing the exercise in a
pool will avoid the risk of a fall. If you have joint problems but are otherwise
healthy, use of an elliptical trainer is a good idea because this device gives a
good workout but doesn’t cause trauma to joints.
In addition to movement exercise, lifting light weights has been shown to be
very beneficial to the elderly. They regain strength in their muscles, improve
their balance, and increase their stamina. See Chapter 9 for illustrations of
seven low-impact exercises you can do with weights to build up your upper
body.
There are some risks to exercise in the elderly with T1DM, especially those
just starting to get moving. (The risks usually aren’t present when the person
has been exercising for decades.) Risks include:
 Hemorrhage of the vitreous of the eye
 High blood glucose after strenuous exercise
 Hypoglycemia
 Increased protein in the urine
 Possible heart disease
 Retinal detachment
 Soft tissue and joint injury
You should have a thorough examination by a cardiologist if you’re 50 or older
and are just starting to exercise vigorously. Also, if you haven’t had an eye
exam within the past year, get one before you start exercise.
286

Checking Out Resources for the 
Elderly with Type 1 Diabetes
Fortunately, there are plenty of resources for the elderly with T1DM who are
on a fixed income and may not be able to afford all their medications and
doctor’s visits. Too many people are unaware of the resources in the follow-
ing sections or don’t make use of them. That’s a big mistake. Use all the tools
at your disposal so you can continue to live a great life with T1DM, even as a
senior!
Here a few more helpful resources that the elderly can use:
 Head to Chapter 2 for details on gathering a diabetes team, including a
specialist, a diabetes educator, and other fine folks.
 Appendix B has Internet resources for the latest information. Every one
of them has something useful for the elderly person with T1DM. If you
don’t have a computer or an Internet connection, get one, ask a family
member or neighbor for help, or get help at the local library. You’re
never too old to learn to use a computer. (Plus you can e-mail your
grandchildren!)
Government help
No one has to make a choice between diabetes medications and healthy food
or pleasurable activities. The U.S. government operates two major programs —
Medicare and Medicaid — to make sure that you have help with medical
insurance coverage when you can no longer work.
Medicare
The introduction to Medicare in the government publication “Medicare and
You” explains its purpose very well: “Medicare is health insurance for people
age 65 or older, under age 65 with certain disabilities, and any age with 
End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a
kidney transplant).” Medicare consists of four parts; the following list covers
just the basics, so for more-complete information on each part, head to
www.medicare.gov:
 Part A is hospital care. The government pays most of this, and it isn’t
optional. If you have Part A, medical care is not entirely free.
 Part B is medical office care. It’s optional, and you may end up paying a
lot of this bill if you don’t choose doctors approved by Medicare.
287
Chapter 17: Controlling Type 1 Diabetes in the Elderly

 Part C combines Part A and Part B in “Medicare Advantage Plans” 
like Preferred Provider Organization plans or Health Maintenance
Organization plans to help lower your costs while providing complete
medical care.
 Part D is prescription drug coverage. It’s optional, but if you have sizable
costs for drugs every year, it may be very helpful.
The Medicare homepage (www.medicare.gov) has a “Search Tools” link that
can direct you to answers to almost any question you have. You also can read
through the excellent publication “Medicare and You” (www.medicare.gov/
Publications/Pubs/pdf/10050.pdf), which covers all you need to know
about, well, Medicare and you. The other major resource that I recommend
for further information on Medicare is the AARP Web site at www.aarp.org.
Consider joining the association; it’s inexpensive and the benefits (in addition
to a complete explanation of Medicare) are enormous and include publica-
tions and discounts.
Medicaid
Medicaid is a program of the U.S. government but is administered at the state
level. As with Medicare (see the previous section), no one can explain the
program better than Medicaid itself: “Medicaid is available only to certain
low-income individuals and families who fit into an eligibility group that is
recognized by federal and state law. Medicaid does not pay money to you;
instead, it sends payments directly to your health care providers. Depending
on your state’s rules, you may also be asked to pay a small part of the cost
(co-payment) for some medical services.”
Each state establishes its own eligibility criteria for Medicaid, and if you meet
your state’s criteria, your health provider gets the benefits. On the Medicaid
Web site, www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo, you can find an excellent
introduction to the plan as well as a link to “Medicaid Eligibility.” Click that
link, and then scroll down the page to find “Contact Information to State
Medicaid Offices.” The downloadable plan introduction, “Medicaid At-A-
Glance 2005” (www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/Downloads/
MedicaidAtAGlance2005.pdf), is the basic resource for understanding
the plan.
Drug company resources
Every drug company that provides a drug for diabetes has a plan for people
who can’t afford their drug. Here’s a rundown of the programs (including Web
sites to visit for full details) of some major providers of insulin:
288
Part IV: Living with Type 1 Diabetes 

 Eli Lilly and Company has a program called Lilly Cares that offers free
medication through physicians if the patient meets the eligibility criteria.
You can find out more by visiting www.lilly.com/products/access.
 Novo-Nordisk has a Patient Assistance Program that gives you a 90-day
supply of medication free if you meet eligibility criteria. You can download
the guidelines and application for this program at www.novonordisk-
us.com/documents/pdf/2007NovoNordiskPAPGuidelines.pdf.
 Sanofi-Aventis operates a Patient Assistance Program that distributes
free medications, including insulins, to patients who meet eligibility 
criteria. You can find out more about this program at www.rxassist.
org/pap-info/company_detail.cfm?CmpId=49.
 Pfizer’s program, Connection to Care, offers 75 of the company’s medica-
tions, including their insulin, free through your doctor. You have to fill
out a form, and Pfizer provides the medication to your doctor for you.

Their Own Diabetes Care

nvolving children in their own diabetes care is critical. Sooner or later, as
a parent or caretaker, you have to give up your control of food, injection
amount and timing, blood glucose testing, and all the other tasks that are
required for good diabetes care. When you do so, you want to know that
you’re turning over the care to a highly qualified individual, your child with
T1DM.
Before you turn over the care, you can do a lot to prepare your child by let-
ting him participate in what you do for him. Start by asking for his ideas and
views about how you take care of his diabetes. Be sure to listen to what he
says and show that you take him seriously by turning his reasonable sugges-
tions into reality. This collaboration will have many benefits for your child,
including the following:
 It will increase his self-confidence.
 It will improve his communication skills.
 It will expand his knowledge as you discuss his ideas and why they’re
appropriate or not.
 It will make him ready to take over his diabetes care when you think the
time is right.

This chapter covers ten ways that you can progressively involve your child
with T1DM so that he’s ready, willing, and able to care for himself.
Set Some Goals for Care with Your Child
Your child probably doesn’t know if he wants to be a doctor or lawyer at the
age of 8, but by this time, he may have an idea of how to handle his diabetes.
If not, this is a good opportunity to discuss the subject with him and to really
listen and learn. You’ll quickly find out how he feels about having diabetes —
whether it’s a major burden on him and if he’s coming to terms with it. You
also may find out what he’s willing to do for himself and whether you need to
keep charge of his diabetes until he’s more reconciled to it.
If your child doesn’t have goals for his diabetes care, this is a time to set
some with him. You can start by asking the following questions:
 When does he feel he can start doing his own blood glucose testing and
administering his own insulin? (I discuss these tasks later in this chapter.)
 Does he understand the consequences of not taking good care of himself,
for example, eating right and exercising? (I talk about the importance of
good food and regular exercise later in this chapter.)
 Is he willing to share his diagnosis with other family and friends so that
they can help when necessary? This should be done when the diagnosis
is first made because their help may be needed even more at the begin-
ning than later on, after you and your child have a better understanding
of diabetes care.
These are all important issues. The way he manages them will determine if
he’ll earn a Joslin medal for diabetic longevity in 50 years (see Chapter 17 
for more about this award).
Show Your Child How to 
Test His Blood Glucose
Unfortunately, at least at present, testing blood glucose means sticking your
finger. And that can hurt, although modern testing devices (see Chapter 7)
keep the pain to a minimum. As soon as your child has good hand-eye coordi-
nation (around age 7 to 10), start letting him stick his own finger for blood
glucose testing. Remember, he may have to do this for the next 50 or 60 years.
He needs to find out how to produce a drop of blood with little effort, to get
the test strip ready for testing, and to get the blood on the strip with minimal
effort.
294
Part V: The Part of Tens

Doing his own testing will give him a lot of confidence about his diabetes. You
want to emphasize the key role that testing plays in the management of his
diabetes and the significance of the numbers that appear on the monitor. The
more willing he is to test, the better his diabetes control. And the better his
control, the fewer complications (if any) he’ll experience later in life.
The short-term benefits of letting your child do his own glucose testing also
are clear. He’ll always be on top of his blood glucose, and ketoacidosis (high
blood glucose) should be unusual. Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) should
be rare as well because he’ll know in advance when his glucose is dropping.
(Flip to Chapter 4 for more about hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis.)
Shop for Food Together
Although your child may initially think that all food originates in the super-
market, having him join you there can be a very valuable lesson in choosing
good foods and avoiding bad foods. Start this practice at age 4 or 5 because
he’ll soon have to make his own food choices at school.
It’s best to eat before you and your child hit the store. A full stomach will
lessen but not entirely eliminate his requests for all the goodies that are 
available at the supermarket.
Show your child the foods that are part of his healthy diet, going from the
things he eats the most to the things he should avoid. Teach him what’s 
what as follows:
 Begin with carbohydrates and emphasize low glycemic choices and whole
grains. Show him how the label tells him about the amounts of calories,
salt, fiber, and so forth.
 Go to the vegetable area and tell him to eat plenty of dark green vegeta-
bles, orange vegetables, dry beans, and peas. Teach him to keep the
amount of starchy vegetables he eats reduced compared to the others.
 Head to the fruit bins and tell him to eat a variety of them as they become
available through the seasons. Tell him to drink less fruit juices and eat
more whole fruit.
 Point out the fats and tell him to get his fats from fish, nuts, and vegetable
oil rather than solid fats like butter and margarine.
 In the milk area, show him the low-fat or fat-free choices as well as other
sources of calcium like yogurt. Point out that hard cheese has lots of fat,
so lower-fat versions are better for him.
 In the meats section, point out the lean choices, like chicken and turkey.
Tell him that he should eat less meat and more fish, beans, peas, nuts,
and seeds, which contain healthier oils.
295
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Involve Kids in Their Own Diabetes Care

Make food shopping a great adventure. And make it more fun by taking your
child along with you the next time and letting him guide you through the
store and point out the best choices that you’ve taught him. Check out
Chapter 8 for the full scoop on eating a healthy diet.
Plant a Garden Together
If you have a little space in your backyard, plant a garden with your child. He’ll
be amazed to find out that he can start with one small plant and end up with
boxes of tomatoes! If you don’t have the space, go cherry picking or apple
picking or some other fruit or vegetable picking so that your child realizes
that food comes from the soil.
If there’s no nearby farm and you don’t have property for planting, take your
child to a farmers’ market. (They’re popping up in almost every community,
so it shouldn’t be difficult to find one near you.) He’ll understand that the real
source of food is the farm rather than the supermarket.
Gardening is another opportunity to find out what your child wants and likes
as well as to show that you aren’t just asking but intend to act on his request.
Get the seeds and plants he wants and let him plant them, be responsible for
them, and be the first to taste the result.
Explain how the seed of good diabetes control, when carefully planted,
watered, and tended, can lead to a healthy and fruitful life, just as a garden
plant produces its fruit. Furthermore, he’s responsible for the outcome;
whether he has a plant full of delicious fruit or a few scrawny results is
entirely in his hands.
Have Your Child Help with the Cooking
Food is such a major part of diabetes care that it’s essential that your child
be able to cook for himself and prepare healthy food. Letting your child help
you cook has many benefits, including the following:
 It represents quality time between you and your child.
 It’s a chance for your child to learn to cook and pick up new skills.
 It’s an opportunity for you to introduce new healthy foods that he’s
more willing to try because he had a hand in the preparation.
Even at a very young age, your child can do something to participate.
296
Part V: The Part of Tens

 At age 2, he can scrub fruit and vegetables, tear lettuce, and break bread.
 At age 3, he can pour liquids, mix batter, spread butter, and knead bread.
 At age 4 to 5, he can juice different fruits, mash soft fruits, measure dry
and liquid ingredients, and beat eggs.
As your child grows older, give him more complex cooking tasks.
Although you encourage cleanliness, you have to be willing to accept some
mess when you first start cooking with your child. But definitely give him a
share of the cleanup jobs. Also, it’s critical that you supervise and instruct.
And don’t forget to praise him as you eat the food you cooked together so
that he associates good food with positive feelings.
Exercise as a Family
Exercise, as you know, plays a key role in your and your child’s health. You
can’t expect your child to want to exercise if he sees his parent sitting in front
of the computer (as I’m doing right now — fortunately my kids are grown).
Regardless of their diagnosis, I encourage my patients to exercise daily — kids
with parents and vice versa. I could tell you many happy stories of the close-
ness that has developed between parents and children who jog together, not
to mention the stories of chubby, shy children who grew up into lean, assertive
adolescents because they exercised with their parents.
Chapter 9 tells you what you need to do to get started exercising with your
child. Let him decide where you’ll go sometimes. You may discover that he
wants to show you off to his friends (or hide you).
Show Your Child How 
to Administer Insulin
You may want to delay the time when your child calculates his own insulin
dosage until you’re certain he can do it properly, but teaching him to admin-
ister the insulin is also something that should be done early (around age 10).
Fortunately, this is even less painful than finger sticking for the blood glucose
(which I discuss earlier in this chapter).
When he has sufficient hand-eye coordination, he must learn to take the cor-
rect dose of insulin into the syringe and inject it under his skin properly. (Of
course, if your child uses a different method of insulin delivery, be sure to
297
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Involve Kids in Their Own Diabetes Care

fully explain the process.) You want to explain how you established his dose
every time so that dosage also becomes second nature. (Turn to Chapters 10
and 11 for full details on using insulin.)
Keep up the positive reinforcement with praise, and minimize your response
to mistakes if they aren’t serious. For example, a tiny bubble in the syringe
isn’t a serious mistake; taking double the dose of insulin is. Your child will be
eager to take over the task of calculating his insulin as well, but don’t be in a
hurry to let him until you’re totally confident that he can do it properly.
Plan a Trip Together
Planning a trip is another chance to get good feedback from your child while
you teach him what to be aware of when traveling with T1DM (which I discuss
in Chapter 15). He can start participating in the planning when he’s old enough
to go to school. Here are a few guidelines:
 Find out where he wants to go and what he wants to do there. Let him
make the preparations that are required to ensure that he has enough
insulin and testing materials.
 He should know how to maintain the potency of his insulin regardless 
of the climate at your destination.
 He should begin to understand what to do as he travels through time
zones.
 He should already know about eating wisely for his diabetes. The princi-
ples of eating are the same whether at home or on a trip.
 He should know about security at airports and how to take diabetes sup-
plies through. He must be aware not to make any remarks about explo-
sives, even in a joking manner.
Have Your Child Do Household Chores
Studies by Marty Rossen at the University of Minnesota have shown that one
of the best predictors of general success at age 20 and up was whether a child
performed household tasks at age 3 to 4. Involving your child in such tasks
teaches him
 A sense of responsibility
 A sense of competence
 A sense of self-reliance
 A sense of self-worth
298
Part V: The Part of Tens

These positive traits stay with the child throughout life, and they transfer over
to his care of his diabetes. The messages that you want to give your child are
that work is important and that he’s capable of doing it competently. It’s
amazing what helping out around the house can do for your child, not to
mention the benefits for you.
There are tasks that a child can do at every age. For example:
 The 2- to 3-year-old can pick up his toys, help sweep the floor, help set
the table, undress himself, and dress himself with help.
 The 4-year-old can set the table, put away groceries, help with yard and
garden work, help make the beds, and spread butter on bread.
 The 5-year-old can help with meal planning and grocery shopping (as I
explain earlier in this chapter), pour his own drink, set the table, pick up
his clothes, fold clean clothes, and do yard work like collecting leaves or
clippings.
 The 6-year-old can choose his own clothing, water flowers and vegetables,
cook simple foods like hot dogs, walk a pet, and tie his shoes.
 The 7-year-old can take phone messages, wash the dog, carry groceries
in from the car and put them away, get up and go to bed on his own, and
run simple errands for his parents.
 The 8- to 9-year-old can fold napkins and set the table, mop the floor, run
his bathwater, fold blankets, cut flowers, paint a fence, and write a simple
thank-you note.
 The 10- to 11-year-old can earn his own money for doing yard work, be
home alone, stay overnight with a friend, and be responsible for his own
hobby.
 The 12-year-old and up can join clubs and organizations, help with
errands, mow the lawn, clean the oven and stove, help his parents 
with household repairs, and be responsible for part-time jobs like a
paper route.
Encourage Your Child to Play 
Video Games (Really!)
Video games are a favorite pursuit of today’s kids, and they have so many dif-
ferent games to choose from. Now there are video games that teach about
T1DM! Two of the top games are Starbright Life Adventure Series: Diabetes
and Packy and Marlon.
299
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Involve Kids in Their Own Diabetes Care

 Starbright Life Adventure Series: Diabetes comes from the Starbright
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that develops programs to help
seriously ill children cope with the challenges of their illnesses. This
particular program uses interactive adventures to teach children to
manage their diabetes properly. There are exercises, quizzes, and arcade
games, and the program is available in Spanish. It’s available on CD-ROM
free of charge for a family that has a child with T1DM between the ages
of 5 and 13. Call 800-760-3818 for more information.
 Packy and Marlon is a role-playing game used with Super-Nintendo.
Children learn to plan meals, calculate and administer insulin, and test
the blood glucose of two elephants with T1DM. Players get points for
properly accomplishing these tasks. The game is available for around
$60 from the Boehringer Mannheim Corp.; call 800-428-5076 for more
information.
Children who played Packy and Marlon were found to have more self-
confidence about managing their diabetes and better communication
with friends and care providers. During the six-month trial period, there
was a 77 percent reduction in acute care visits because of diabetes.
If it can be said that T1DM may be fun, these games are the basis for that
statement.

Ten Commandments for Good
Diabetes Management
In This Chapter
 Having a positive attitude
 Avoiding complications with regular tests and blood glucose monitoring
 Eating wisely and exercising often
 Medicating the right way at the right times
 Preparing for possible problems
 Staying updated on developments in type 1 diabetes
T
ype 1 diabetes (T1DM) isn’t a religion, despite the title of this chapter. In
fact, it can be a real pain at times. However, there’s a lot that you can do
to minimize that pain. Everything you need to get your child started properly
with the things he must do to keep his disease under control and minimize its
impact is available.
The ten commandments discussed in this chapter are a major part of what
excellent care for T1DM is all about. Other things need to be done as well, but
if you follow through on these ten, whether you’re the parent or the patient,
the others will fall into place.
Everything discussed here is described much more extensively in previous
chapters. I bring it all together here to give you the total picture of essential
diabetes care. Keep in mind that nothing in this chapter is more or less impor-
tant than anything else. Each action is like a piece of a puzzle; individually,
the pieces don’t provide much clarity, but together, they tell you how to get
your child to the point that he’s able to put the puzzle together on his own.

An Affirmative Attitude
If I were to tell you that all patients with T1DM are destined to be blind or have
their kidneys fail (for the record, I’d never tell you that), you’d have little 
incentive to do much of anything to help your child. Fortunately, it’s not true.
Everything you do for your child (or yourself, if you’re the patient) makes a 
difference.
To manage T1DM, you and your child have to do so much on a daily basis,
and so little of it seems to have an immediate effect. The positive belief that
what you’re doing is helpful to your child in the long-run is what keeps you
doing it. The power of positive thinking is an important tool that helps you
do everything you must do for your child, knowing that your efforts will bear
fruit in the form of a long and healthy life. I discuss the details of coping with
T1DM positively in Chapter 6.
Total Testing
With modern methods available for management of the long-term complica-
tions of diabetes (see Chapter 5), it’s sad, unfortunate, and unnecessary for a
patient with T1DM to lose his sight or his kidney function because he wasn’t
tested early. For every potential long-term complication due to T1DM, there’s
an excellent test or study that can discover it when it’s still at a reversible
stage. In Chapter 7, I go over the routine tests that must be done to prevent
irreversible damage to your child’s eyes, kidneys, or nervous system. More
and more, these tests are available as home kits that you can complete at
home, like the hemoglobin A1c, or send to a lab that returns the result, like
the urine microalbumin test.
Make a copy of the test table on the Cheat Sheet and make sure to keep it up-
to-date with your child’s test results. Don’t depend on your child’s pediatri-
cian to get these tests when they’re due; he has numerous other patients to
think about, but your child is your one and only, so be an advocate for your
child.
The importance of continued testing is also something that you must teach
your child when he takes over management of his T1DM. By then he’ll proba-
bly have had diabetes for ten years or more, and regular tests are even more
important for adults than they are for younger folks because the long-term
complications of diabetes begin to appear after ten years.

Part V: The Part of Tens

Extraordinary Eye Care
The eye is the one organ that allows doctors to see directly into the brain —
what they see happening in the tissues of the eye is probably happening in
the brain as well. Doctors have wonderful tools for viewing and photograph-
ing the eyes and for treating any damage that occurs to them. What can you
do to reduce the risk of eye damage (see Chapter 5) in your child?
 Make sure that your child has yearly eye examinations from an eye
doctor or optometrist beginning a few years after he develops his 
diabetes. Abnormalities can be spotted early, and treatment preserves
vision. (See Chapter 7 for more about eye exams.)
 Make sure that your child understands the connection between his
blood glucose and his eyes. (In a nutshell, the higher the level of blood
glucose, the greater likelihood of eye damage.) The Joslin Medalist Study
of T1DM of extreme duration (see Chapter 17) shows that eye disease
doesn’t have to happen — even after 50 years of living with diabetes.
The picture used to be a lot bleaker because almost every patient with
T1DM developed serious eye disease, and many went blind. Now, 
with careful monitoring of the blood glucose and the eyes, blindness
need never occur. At worst, the patient may need treatment with laser
therapy to the eyes, a very effective form of treatment that prevents
blindness.
 Make sure that your child takes care of his eyes and gets annual eye
examinations as an adult. I want him to be able to continue to read my
books far into the future!
Foolproof Foot Care
One of the sad consequences of T1DM that should never occur is an amputa-
tion of the foot. Amputations are preventable, but they occur when relatively
minor foot problems, especially ulcers of the foot, aren’t caught and managed
early. Ultimately, foot ulcers should never develop in the first place.
Your child’s doctor should inspect his feet at every examination (see Chapter 7
for more information). Although it’s very unlikely that there will be anything
wrong with your child’s feet in the early years of T1DM, it’s good to get the
child thinking about his feet and examining them himself from an early age.
Here are a few guidelines for home foot care:
 Keep the skin lubricated if it tends to be dry.
 Trim toenails carefully.
303
Chapter 19: Ten Commandments for Good Diabetes Management

 Visually inspect the feet every day, looking for any small cut or other
abrasion.
 Choose footwear carefully, both to prevent blisters and sores and to
decrease pressure on any existing foot problems or deformities.
It’s essential that the foot doctor is consulted immediately when there’s any
sign of a new abnormality of the feet. Waiting a few days can make an enor-
mous difference in the outcome.
Mega-Monitoring
Home testing of the blood glucose (see Chapter 7) is a truly valuable tool that
has made an enormous difference in the successful management of T1DM. It’s
truly amazing that you can know your child’s blood glucose in 5 seconds with
less than a drop of blood. At first, your child won’t like it, but with repetition,
blood glucose testing hurts less and less and becomes more and more routine.
Monitoring the blood glucose provides a snapshot of your child’s metabolism
at a given instant in time. It provides the critical information that allows you
to choose the proper dose of insulin to keep the blood glucose in a range of
80 to 140 mg/dl. A patient with an average blood glucose in that range will
never suffer from diabetic complications.
How much testing should you do? The more, the merrier, as they say. There’s
no doubt that a major difference between my patients with T1DM who suc-
cessfully manage their diabetes and those who have difficulty doing so is that
the former test their blood sugar far more than the latter. I recommend test-
ing at the following times:
 Before meals to figure out the bolus of insulin to give for the meal,
depending upon the current blood glucose and the amount of carbohy-
drates about to be eaten (see Chapter 10 for more about insulin dosages)
 An hour after eating to gauge the rise in blood glucose with food and to
respond with extra insulin before that meal next time
 At bedtime to see if your child is going to sleep with a low blood glucose,
in which case a bedtime snack is in order to prevent hypoglycemia
 Frequently when your child’s sick because illness causes major changes
in blood glucose (see Chapter 15 for more about handling sick days)
 Occasionally at other times just to see how a given food or a certain
amount of exercise affects your child’s blood glucose
304
Part V: The Part of Tens

The other kind of monitoring that you can do is monitoring of the ketones in
the blood. It requires a specific monitor but can give you a very early clue
that your child is headed for diabetic ketoacidosis. I describe this test more
extensively in Chapter 15. Testing the blood for ketones has resulted in ear-
lier admissions to hospitals when necessary and shorter hospital stays.
Dedicated Dieting
Careful management of the diet in T1DM has been shown repeatedly to lower
the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) by 1 percent or more. And every 1 percent
drop in hemoglobin A1c causes a large decrease in the risk of microvascular
complications that I describe in Chapter 5: retinopathy, nephropathy, and
neuropathy.
Here are a few diet guidelines for a person with T1DM (see Chapter 8 for full
details on eating sensibly):
 Because carbohydrates are the only macronutrients that directly and
immediately raise blood glucose (unlike protein and fat), it makes sense
either to limit the amount of carbohydrate in your child’s meals or to
choose carbohydrates that are absorbed more slowly (meaning those
that aren’t highly processed).
 Don’t limit the amount of food your child eats, but make the good food
choices that will control his blood glucose. He’ll stop eating when he’s
full, and his growing body needs the extra calories.
 Definitely get your child involved in choosing good food and food prepa-
ration as described in Chapter 18. At some point, he’ll go off to college
or move out on his own, and then he must have these skills. A depen-
dence on restaurant food or food ordered in like pizza is likely to result
in fairly poor control of the blood glucose.
 Don’t abandon a careful nutritional program when you eat outside your
home. You can find out what’s available at most restaurants by finding
them on the Internet and glancing at their menus. Fast-food places serve
the same food everywhere, and the nutritional content of their food is
available on the Internet as well.
 If you’re really stuck and have no idea of the nutritional value of what
your child is eating, use blood glucose monitoring to measure his blood
glucose (see the previous section), and treat the result as necessary.
305
Chapter 19: Ten Commandments for Good Diabetes Management

Emphatic Exercising
As evidenced in a survey article, the fortunate folks who have received
medals from the Joslin Diabetes Center for having lived with diabetes on
insulin for 50 years or more have several things in common (see Chapter 17
for the full story). One is that they exercise more than most other people at
their age. The authors conclude that “exercise may be an important protec-
tive factor.” You can say that again!
The T1DM patients in my practice with the lowest hemoglobin A1c, the least
need for insulin, and the fewest complications are the ones who do the most
exercise. Exercise has so many positive aspects to it and such a minimal
downside that it should be as routine for your child as brushing his teeth. 
I discuss exercise in detail in Chapter 9.
Don’t expect your child to become physically active on his own. Unfortunately,
schools are reducing physical education programs in favor of varsity football
and basketball. Your child needs your example to start an exercise program.
Get out and walk with him at first, then jog, swim, bike, or ski (or do a combi-
nation of these). There will come a day when your child will beat you to the
end of the pool or down the ski slope and that should be a day of celebration
because you know you’ve done your job right.
Mindful Medicating
Every time I see a high blood glucose result and my patient tells me it hap-
pened because he forgot to take his insulin shot, I feel like screaming (but I
never do). The stakes are too high to allow that to occur. Most of the time
poor diabetic control has little to do with problems that are outside the con-
trol of the person with diabetes and has everything to do with not taking
medications, not testing the blood glucose, not following a nutritional plan,
and not exercising (all of which I discuss earlier in this chapter). There are all
kinds of alarms and monitors you can set up to prompt your child to take his
insulin (or to prompt you to give it to him) if he has trouble remembering,
but the bottom line is that the best treatments in the world are of little value
if your child doesn’t use them.
Not only do some people forget to take their insulin entirely, but insulin also
is consistently in the list of the top ten medications associated with adminis-
tration errors. At the present time, all people with T1DM take two kinds of
insulin, long-acting and rapid-acting. Almost once a week I get a call from a
patient who has taken the rapid-acting when he should have taken the long-
acting, and vice versa. What can you do to make sure that you and your child
avoid this mistake?
306
Part V: The Part of Tens

 One of the great benefits of inhaled insulin is that adult patients who take
it never mistake it for something else. Insulin from an inhaler is always
rapid-acting insulin and therefore is unlikely to be confused with long-
acting insulin from a shot. At the present time, inhaled insulin isn’t recom-
mended for children. But if you’re an adult patient, you may want to talk
to your doctor about this option; see Chapter 10 for more information.
 Before insulin glargine became the long-acting insulin of choice, patients
used intermediate (NPH) insulin. It was cloudy compared to clear rapid-
acting insulin, so the two were rarely confused. Glargine, by contrast, is
clear, so you can see where there may be confusion. One possible solu-
tion is to administer the rapid-acting insulin with an insulin pen and the
glargine from a bottle with a syringe.
I explain the particulars of insulin in Chapters 10 and 11, including the kinds
of insulin available, calculating insulin doses correctly, and various methods
for delivering insulin.
Planning for Potential Problems
Planning is key if you’re going to keep your child’s diabetes under excellent
control. Think about what your child will be exposed to in advance, and
smooth the way. Consider doing dry runs to prepare for potentially difficult
situations. Practicing how you’ll handle situations before they arise makes it
a lot easier to function when you’re faced with the real thing. For example:
 When it comes to food, you can eat at places you know, inform your host-
ess that your child has diabetes and help her to prepare something he
can eat (if possible), bring the food for your child with diabetes, and/or
check the fast-food recipes on the Internet. If you’ve been invited to a
new restaurant, visit it in advance and simply read the menu. Carefully
select the foods that will help your child to stay in control of his T1DM.
 Plan for the times when your child’s blood glucose is low. Have glucose
tablets or any of the other treatments recommended in Chapter 4 avail-
able to bring the blood glucose up but not too high. An emergency
glucagon kit is another valuable item to have on hand.
You may want to create checklists because remembering everything you
have to do can be difficult. Have an eating-out checklist, a visiting-others
checklist, a travel checklist, and so forth. You’ll be so glad you did when you
discover that you have the thing you need at that moment you need it.

Chapter 19: Ten Commandments for Good Diabetes Management

Lifelong Learning
Diabetes is a “hot” disease right now, mostly because of the surge in cases of
type 2 diabetes. As a result, a huge amount of money is directed at the disease,
and T1DM is getting its share. Diabetes journals that used to be thin are now
thick with new information. For example, the number of publications that I
get in my office with “diabetes” somewhere in the title has become so great
that I can’t keep up with them and have to pick and choose what to read.
Use the following tips to ensure a lifetime of learning about your child’s 
condition:
 As soon as you can after you’ve gotten over the initial shock of having a
child with T1DM, sign up for a course on diabetes with a Certified
Diabetes Educator. Make sure it’s focused on T1DM because a lot of the
information about T2DM has little relevance to your child’s disease. (I
explain how to find a diabetes educator in Chapter 2.)
 The fact that you’re reading this book indicates how much you want to
learn about T1DM. But don’t stop with this book. There are other excel-
lent publications available, many offered by the American Diabetes
Association. Appendix B is chock-full of resources to help you find the
latest information.
 When your child is old enough (around age 10), take him with you to a
refresher course on T1DM. You’ll be amazed at how much new material
is offered. Encourage him to continue learning. As you see in Chapter 21,
there are some incredible new approaches to the treatment of T1DM;
one of them may turn out to be the “cure” you’re looking for.

Ten Myths about Type 1 Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Realizing some truths about the nature of type 1 diabetes
 Becoming aware of food myths
 Getting the facts on insulin
 Understanding the direction of science in T1DM
A
s you would expect for a disease that has been around for several thou-
sand years, there are plenty of myths about diabetes. Some of them have
a tiny bit of truth to them, so they keep being passed around. Unfortunately,
thanks to the Internet, a myth can pop up on 10 million computer screens in
two hours. But just because so many diabetes myths have been heard and
read about doesn’t make them true.
In this book, you find everything of importance that you need to know to help
your child (or yourself, if you’re an adult patient) live a long and healthy life
with type 1 diabetes (or T1DM for short). If you don’t read about something
in one of the chapters on diagnosis and treatment, it’s unlikely that it plays
an important role in diabetes care. So if you hear about some great break-
through in T1DM and it isn’t in this book, consider it a myth until proven 
otherwise. You can even drop me an e-mail and tell me about it at diabetes@
drrubin.com. I’m happy to either confirm or deny it.
Because insulin and food are key components of diabetes care, it’s no sur-
prise that a lot of myths in T1DM revolve around these two topics. There’s
also a lot of confusion about the difference between T1DM and T2DM. You
may even encounter myths about the direction of science in curing T1DM. I
break down all these myths in this chapter.

No Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes Appear
before Damage Has Occurred
Diabetes is sometimes called “the Silent Disease,” but that nickname just isn’t
true. T1DM actually has plenty of symptoms — if you know where to look.
Some of the symptoms that children complain of early in the disease include:
 Increased urination
 Increased thirst
 Dry skin
 Fatigue
 Blurry vision
 Irritability
 Extreme hunger
 Eating without weight gain
 Unexpected and unusual weight loss
These symptoms aren’t severe, so they often go unnoticed by parents and
caretakers. Put simply, it’s hard to accept the fact that there’s something seri-
ously wrong with your 10-year-old. However, with so much emphasis on dia-
betes in general because of the huge increase in cases of T2DM, people are
more aware of a diabetes diagnosis and are having their children checked
earlier, long before they reach the stage of complete lack of insulin and
ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4).
Flip to Chapter 2 for the basics of T1DM, its symptoms, and its diagnosis.
Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 
Diabetes Are the Same
Parents of children with T1DM would love for their children’s disease to be
called by another name so it isn’t confused with type 2 diabetes (or T2DM).
Although T1DM and T2DM share some of the same characteristics, they are
hardly the same disease. They differ in the following ways:
310
Part V: The Part of Tens

 The cause of T1DM is a genetic tendency plus a virus. The cause of T2DM
is heredity plus obesity plus a sedentary lifestyle.
 Patients with T1DM have an absolute lack of insulin when the disease
strikes. Patients with T2DM may actually have too much measurable
insulin when the disease strikes; they have insulin resistance.
 Most cases of T1DM occur in childhood. Most cases of T2DM occur 
after age 35.
 T2DM can be controlled with diet and exercise alone. T1DM can’t be
controlled in that way.
 Diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4) is often the first complaint in
T1DM. It doesn’t occur in patients with T2DM.
 Most patients with T1DM are thin. Patients with T2DM are generally 
(but not always) fat.
T1DM and T2DM are similar in the following ways:
 The clinical problem in both begins when the blood glucose rises too
high.
 High blood glucose acts as a toxin in both forms.
 Complications of eye disease, kidney disease, nerve disease, and cardio-
vascular disease (see Chapter 5) are similar for both kinds.
See Chapter 3 for more about the differences between T1DM and T2DM.
You Can’t Eat Sugar with Type 1 Diabetes
This myth goes back to the time before insulin became available in 1921. At
that time, there was nothing that could force glucose into the cells of the
body where insulin was required, so the treatment was the elimination of all
carbohydrates. The reasoning was that, if a patient didn’t consume carbohy-
drates, then the blood glucose couldn’t rise to the high levels that resulted in
excessive urination, thirst, confusion, coma, and death. That approach worked
for a time, but the liver is fully capable of making glucose from protein despite
the fact that the glucose can’t get into liver cells to be stored as glycogen
once it’s made.
Today, there are probably more types of insulin available than are needed. A
little injected insulin can take care of lots of sugar or other carbohydrates.
A corollary to this myth is that T1DM is caused by consuming too many
sweets. Doctors have a pretty good idea of the cause of T1DM, and sweets
have nothing to do with it. As I explain in Chapter 2, the cause of T1DM is
311
Chapter 20: Ten Myths about Type 1 Diabetes

believed to be a combination of a hereditary tendency and infection with a
virus that has characteristics similar to insulin-producing beta cells. As the
body destroys the virus, it mistakenly destroys the beta cells as well.
All in all, some glucose as part of a good overall diet is definitely acceptable.
Let your child enjoy a little sugar. Just don’t let him overdo it. Eating anything
in excess is discouraged, whether it’s carbohydrate, protein, or fat. See
Chapter 8 for the full details on eating a healthy, sensible diet.
You Have to Eat Special Foods When 
You Have Type 1 Diabetes
With T1DM, there’s no advantage to eating special diabetic foods. It’s difficult
enough to deal with all the requirements for good diabetes care to have to
eat boring tasteless foods! Food is one of life’s great pleasures, and your child
can have excellent glucose control with regular food so long as you account
for the carbohydrate in it. Need some help?
 I provide resources for great recipes in Appendix B.
 In my book Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), I offer
page after page of recipes for delicious meals that fit into a nutritional
plan for patients with T1DM. These recipes come from some of the best
restaurants in America.
 Books that feature good, nutritious food for children with T1DM fill the
shelves of many bookstores.
Show your child that he can eat delicious meals and still follow his nutritional
plan. Prepare meals that the whole family can eat. With food this good,
there’s no reason that everyone in the family shouldn’t eat the same meals as
your child with T1DM.
If You Take Insulin, You Must 
Have Type 1 Diabetes
In T1DM, insulin is an essential part of diabetes care because the disease is
characterized by a total lack of insulin in the body. On the other hand, in
T2DM, insulin is a tool to get the blood glucose to a level at which diet and
exercise can work. T2DM is a lifestyle disease, not a disease of lack of insulin.
When someone with T2DM improves his diet, exercise regimen, and weight,
he can manage T2DM without insulin.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens

So how do patients with T2DM wind up on insulin? They initially have resis-
tance to their own insulin. As time passes, many of them also seem to lose
the ability to make enough insulin to control their blood glucose at their cur-
rent weight. Then they must be put on insulin.
Many of those patients with T2DM could come off the insulin with proper
diet and exercise. The diagnosis remains T2DM whether they are on insulin
or not.
In my practice, I’ve seen many patients with T2DM who have been put on
insulin by other doctors and still have poor control of their diabetes. When I
successfully get them to lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight, their need
for insulin diminishes and sometimes even goes away. My patients can hardly
believe that they can get off the insulin and have even better control of their
blood glucose than they did when they were on it. These aren’t true T1DM
patients — they actually have T2DM. Their own bodies’ insulin does a much
better job of regulating their metabolism than any insulin shot I could give
them.
I go over the basics of insulin for folks with T1DM in Chapters 10 and 11. To
find out much more about the basics and treatment of T2DM, check out my
book Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Insulin Causes Atherosclerosis
This myth probably arose because insulin is often given in situations where
atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) is already present but not clini-
cally evident. Atherosclerosis takes years to develop, so a medication like
insulin that has been started in the last few months is hardly to blame. Want
an example? When young men killed in combat during the Korean War were
carefully examined, they already had evidence of early atherosclerosis that
probably wouldn’t have been clinically evident for decades.
The fact is that insulin actually causes a decline in atherosclerosis by revers-
ing the processes that lead to elevated blood glucose levels and elevated
fatty acids in the blood.
Insulin Cures Type 1 Diabetes
Doctors and researches are coming close to developing a cure for T1DM (see
Chapter 21), but it won’t involve patients using insulin. Insulin helps to con-
trol the blood glucose, but so far it’s impossible to deliver insulin in the body
313
Chapter 20: Ten Myths about Type 1 Diabetes

in the same way that it comes from the pancreas. It also isn’t possible to fine-
tune the insulin dose like the body can, releasing and destroying insulin to
maintain a blood glucose no lower than 80 mg/dl and no higher than 120
mg/dl.
Insulin tried on kids with a high risk of T1DM in the Diabetes Prevention Trials
(ongoing trials of various drugs that may prevent T1DM) wasn’t successful in
preventing the disease. Insulin is a powerful drug that has saved the lives of
hundreds of thousands of people with diabetes, but none of them has been
cured. The most to hope for is that insulin keeps the blood glucose suffi-
ciently low so complications of diabetes don’t develop.
Many myths concern great new cures for T1DM with this medication or that
medication. Ignore them. At the present time, no single medication can cure
T1DM.
You’re More Prone to Illness When 
You Have Type 1 Diabetes
If you compare frequency of illness in the population with T1DM with that of
people who don’t have diabetes, there’s no difference between them. This
myth about being prone to illness is a popular one that originated when
T1DM was so hard to treat before 1921. Back then, kids with T1DM were a
very sick bunch.
People with T1DM get viral illnesses no more often than those without T1DM.
They need to take a flu shot every year to prevent the severe illness that may
be associated with that disease. Elderly people with T1DM especially should
get shots for pneumonia and shingles. But if someone with T1DM comes down
with a bug, he has to adjust his insulin intake, modify his diet, and take med-
ications carefully. See Chapter 15 for details.
Women with Type 1 Diabetes 
Shouldn’t Get Pregnant
A woman with T1DM must take a number of precautions when dealing with
pregnancy, like checking for any diabetic complications before she conceives
and throughout the pregnancy, but besides that, she can have a textbook
pregnancy and baby. Healthy, happy babies are born to women with T1DM
every day. Much of Chapter 16 is devoted to how they do it.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens

The woman with T1DM who’s even thinking about a pregnancy must improve
her glucose control so that she has a hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent before
she conceives. (See Chapter 7 for more about hemoglobin A1c.) She also
must keep her blood glucose below 90 mg/dl before a meal and below 120
mg/dl an hour after the meal throughout the pregnancy.
Doctors Are Hiding the Cure for Type 1
Diabetes So They Can Make More Money
This myth sounds so silly, but I’ve heard it from people I respect. They think
there’s a hidden agreement that the cure for T1DM, which has already been
found, won’t be made available so that doctors and drug and device compa-
nies can continue to profit from caring for patients with T1DM.
There’s nothing further from the truth than this myth. Scientists are a highly
competitive bunch. None of them is holding back a T1DM cure because they
can feel the others breathing down their necks! Thousands of hard-working
doctors and other scientists have dedicated their lives to finding a cure for
T1DM. (Chapter 21 features just a few of them.) I attend conferences on dia-
betes regularly, and at each one, I see numerous presentations showing just
how close researchers are to a cure for T1DM.

Ten of the Latest Discoveries 
in Type 1 Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Possibly preventing type 1 diabetes with vaccines and insulin
 Monitoring blood glucose in new ways
 Fighting the complications of type 1 diabetes
 Reversing the loss of beta cells
S
o much is being discovered every day in T1DM that I could write this
whole book on that aspect rather than limiting it to a chapter of ten
items. It’s a very exciting time! I’ll even go so far as to predict that you’ll see
your child cured of T1DM in your lifetime.
The work is occurring in every phase of T1DM.
 In the area of prevention and diagnosis, T1DM is being broken down
into subgroups based on new findings in genetics. New substances are
being found in patients’ blood that suggest the diagnosis much earlier.
 In the area of monitoring, new tests are being developed to show much
earlier responses to treatment. New devices are coming on the market
for testing the blood glucose continuously and painlessly.
 In the area of complications, doctors’ understanding of the mechanism
of complications is expanding. They’re getting down to the details of the
transition from normal tissue to damaged tissue, and new substances
are being found in the blood that point to the earliest development of
complications.
Perhaps the most work is focused on finding a way to reverse the loss of beta
cells that make insulin in T1DM. Doctors and researchers are taking all kinds
of approaches, from restoring the beta cells with injections of fresh beta cells
from an outside source to trying to get various cells to transform themselves
into beta cells. The trouble is that these new cells are still subject to the
destructive effects of the same substances in the body that destroyed the beta

cells in the first place, so new drugs are being offered to overcome that diffi-
culty. Another approach is to eliminate all the immunologic cells in the child’s
body by irradiation and then to restore them with new cells that may not kill
the beta cells that produce insulin.
In this chapter, I provide you with ten of the latest discoveries in T1DM.
Knowing that you’re most interested in a cure, I discuss the most likely direc-
tions from which that cure will come. Not every approach will bear fruit, but
you only need one to work in order for your child to be free of his least desired
role: a person with T1DM. (See Appendix B for a list of resources that can
help you keep up with the latest discoveries.)
Doctors are well on the way to major advances in type 1 diabetes prevention
and treatment. It’s definitely a good move for you to keep your child as well
controlled as possible (or to do the same for yourself if you’re the patient).
After all, you want your child’s body to be in perfect condition when the cure
becomes available.
The Development of the GAD Vaccine
In 1988, two scientists at UCLA were studying genes involved in brain devel-
opment and function, and they discovered the genes that caused the produc-
tion of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD is an enzyme that leads to
the production of an important neurotransmitter, a chemical that transmits
information from one nerve to another. At the time, it wasn’t known that GAD
is also made in the beta cells of the pancreas — the same cells that produce
and store insulin.
One of the original investigators then read a report about a connection
between autoimmunity to an unknown protein in insulin-producing cells 
and diabetes. Somehow he realized that the protein was probably GAD, 
so he went to work to prove his hypothesis.
First he found that patients with T1DM had high levels of GAD autoantibody.
Then he discovered that mice prone to develop T1DM could be protected
from the disease by receiving small amounts of GAD. He and his colleagues
then created a vaccine using GAD that could slow the development of T1DM
even after the immune response had begun.
The next step was trying the GAD vaccine on humans, which happened in a
study in which neither patient nor doctor knew whether the patient was get-
ting GAD vaccine or a placebo. The result was that the GAD vaccine preserved
insulin production without any adverse effects. The vaccine is called Diamyd
and may prove to be very valuable in protecting high-risk children from
developing T1DM. See Chapter 2 for more about GAD.

Part V: The Part of Tens

The Possible Prevention of Type 1
Diabetes with Oral Insulin
The Diabetes Prevention Trials in 2002 showed that oral insulin could delay
or prevent the onset of T1DM. Now a much larger study is underway (it
began in February 2007 and will end in seven or eight years) based on the
theory that oral insulin quiets the immune system. It’s set up as follows:
 Half the patients get oral insulin in a capsule.
 The other half get a placebo.
 Neither the patient nor the doctor knows what’s in the capsule.
The patients in this study are relatives of patients with known T1DM. Those
who may develop diabetes are found to have positive tests for autoantibod-
ies against insulin and another substance called glutamate decarboxylate. If
autoantibodies are found, they’re asked to enroll in the study.
The study will follow the patients to see if and when they develop T1DM. If
nothing else, the participants will know that they may develop T1DM much
earlier than they normally would know.
If oral insulin works as the researchers hope, those who get it in their capsules
will get T1DM later or not at all compared to those who get the placebo 
capsules.
The Possible Prevention of Type 1
Diabetes with Intranasal Insulin
The basis of this treatment is the theory that exposing the mucous membranes
of the nose to insulin will act like a virus to stimulate protective immune cells.
These protective cells will counteract the damaging cells that destroy the beta
cells that produce and store insulin (or so researchers hope).
The patients in the study will be relatives of people with T1DM who are found
to have positive autoantibodies against insulin or GAD and therefore have a
greater chance of developing T1DM than those who don’t have the antibod-
ies. Some patients will get insulin, and some will get a placebo, but neither
the patients nor the doctors will know who got what until the study ends.
In this study, 264 people are scheduled to be enrolled by 2007, and it isn’t due
for completion until 2012. The patients will be studied for the development of
319
Chapter 21: Ten of the Latest Discoveries in Type 1 Diabetes

T1DM as well as evaluated for the development of more evidence of immu-
nity. (This study is taking place in Australia, so it’s a long way to go if you’re
interested.)
Another study of intranasal insulin called Pre-POINT will involve giving the
insulin to children at high risk of T1DM (because they have relatives with
T1DM) even before they’ve developed antibodies.
The Study of Continuous 
Glucose Monitoring
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) published in 1993
revealed that tight control of the blood glucose could prevent complications
of T1DM. Here it is about 15 years later, and most patients with T1DM still
don’t meet the targets of glucose control shown to be necessary by the DCCT.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) is funding a study of con-
tinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to see if the technique leads to better 
control. The authors believe that CGM decreases anxiety about hypoglycemic
attacks but may increase stress when the CGM doesn’t agree with a finger stick.
(The discrepancy in results occurs when there’s a rapid fall or rise in the blood
glucose.) The authors also are concerned that the amount of blood glucose
data from CGM will overwhelm the patient and family.
CGM is also being used in a JDRF-funded study with an insulin pump wherein
the pump responds to the CGM reading by supplying insulin to the patient.
This is the closed-loop system that’s the ultimate goal of treatment, a working
“pancreas.” So far the system has worked very well. It may be the temporary
solution for T1DM until there’s a way to replace and restore the beta cells
destroyed in T1DM.
See Chapter 7 for details on home systems for continuous glucose monitoring
and Chapter 11 for more about insulin pumps.
Contact Lenses That Indicate 
Your Glucose Level
If this device pans out, you’ll be looking in the mirror every time you want to
know your blood glucose. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have
developed plastic contact lenses that change color depending upon the
amount of glucose in body fluids.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens

The glucose sensor could be embedded in regular contact lenses or worn as
separate contact lenses for people without vision problems. It would change
from red, indicating dangerously low blood glucose, to violet, indicating 
dangerously high blood glucose. A normal blood glucose level produces a
green lens.
The device works by combining moisture from the tear ducts with molecules
of boronic acid in the sensor to create fluorescence. A potential problem is
the delay between the level of glucose in the blood and its reflection in tear
ducts. This work is ongoing and may reach the market in the next few years.
A Drug to Fight Diabetic Neuropathy
Diabetic neuropathy causes pain and discomfort in the feet. Numerous drugs
have been used in an attempt to reverse the neuropathy, but nothing has
worked consistently until the introduction of SB-509. The drug currently
called SB-509 has been found to cause the production of a protein called 
vascular endothelial growth factor, which helps to improve the structure 
and function of nerves.
In a study conducted by JDRF, SB-509 is being injected into both legs of
patients who have T1DM and neuropathy three times over four months.
Some people will receive the actual drug, and some will receive a placebo.
The authors plan to look at pain intensity and nerve conduction velocity to
look for recovery from neuropathy. They’ll also look at the nerves under a
microscope to see if repair of nerves damaged by T1DM is possible. The
study began in 2006 and is scheduled to end in 2008.
Flip to Chapter 5 for details on diabetic neuropathy and other long-term com-
plications that your child can avoid with tight control of T1DM.
Drugs to Block the Immunity 
That Kills Beta Cells
T1DM results when the process of autoimmunity (immune damage directed
back at the person rather than at an outside invader) destroys the beta cells
that produce insulin. Two types of cells in the body are responsible for the
immune destruction: T cells and B cells. T cells are the ones that actually
attack and destroy the beta cells. B cells somehow promote the attack by 
the T cells.
321
Chapter 21: Ten of the Latest Discoveries in Type 1 Diabetes

When symptoms develop in T1DM, within three months of the diagnosis, up
to 80 to 90 percent of beta cells are destroyed but 10 to 20 percent remain.
The purpose of a study conducted by diabetes clinics throughout the coun-
try is to see whether it’s possible to stop further loss of beta cells by giving a
drug called rituximab to patients. Rituximab is to lower B cells.
The authors plan to measure whether the beta cells that are left when the drug
is given at or before three months of T1DM continue to exist and produce
insulin. They’ll check hemoglobin A1c measurements and insulin doses. As of
this writing, the results of this study are expected to be published very soon.
Another drug that’s undergoing the same study is TRX4; the study is also
being conducted by diabetes clinics throughout the country. The intention is
to see if TRX4 can preserve or even improve beta cell function and reduce
the amount of insulin that the patient has to take. Results should be available
soon for this study as well.
The Regeneration of Beta 
Cells with a Protein
One of the most exciting approaches that I’ve come across regarding T1DM is
the work of Dr. Lijun Yang, an associate professor at the University of Florida
College of Medicine. She’s found that she can infuse a protein called recombi-
nant Pdx1 into mice with T1DM and no beta cell function, and it both regener-
ates beta cells in their pancreas and turns liver cells into insulin-producing
beta cells. The mice no longer have diabetes after this treatment, and the Pdx1
protein isn’t toxic to the mice in substantial doses.
As of this writing, Dr. Yang is working on a study of humans with T1DM to see
if she can accomplish the same thing in human volunteers. The patients will
be given human Pdx1 protein. As of this writing, this study hasn’t begun.
It remains to be seen whether the beta cells, however they’re regenerated,
will be subject to the immune rejection of the original beta cells that turned
the patients into people with T1DM in the first place.
The Infusion of Stem Cells
One approach to preventing further loss of insulin production in newly diag-
nosed patients with T1DM is suppression of the immune response that’s
destroying the beta cells. A group in Brazil took this treatment a little further,
and their work was published in The Journal of the American Medical
Association in April 2007.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens

The scientists began by obtaining stem cells, which are cells that haven’t
become any particular kind of cell like white blood cells or red blood cells,
from each newly diagnosed patient with T1DM. (The stem cells were taken
within six weeks of the patients’ diagnoses.) The patients received a high
dose of an immunosuppressive drug to prevent the immune response that’s
believed to cause the destruction of beta cells. Then the scientists gave the
stem cells back to the respective patients.
Of the 15 patients who received this treatment, 14 became able to control
their blood glucose without insulin for different lengths of time: one patient
for 35 months, four patients for at least 21 months, seven patients for at least
6 months, and two patients who were late responders and were insulin-free
for one and five months, respectively. Levels of hemoglobin A1c were main-
tained at less than 7 percent in 13 of 14 patients, and only one patient needed
to resume insulin after a year.
The Use of Cord Blood to 
Regenerate Beta Cells
As of this writing, a study going on at the University of Florida is using the
stem cells found in umbilical cord blood to attempt to regenerate beta cells.
Cord blood has the advantage of containing a large number of cells that
decrease immunity.
The plan is to enlist 23 children with T1DM over the age of 1 whose parents
had the foresight to store their cord blood at birth. The cord blood is infused
back into the child from whom it was taken.
The study, which is to be completed by 2009, will determine if the cells in the
cord blood can change into insulin-producing cells and/or provide immune
tolerance that will permit regeneration of beta cells.

on the link and go.
You may want to stop at my Web site look around for a bit because it contains a
lot of content in addition to links. For example, I’ve posted many articles
about diabetes as well as podcasts, recorded discussions of many issues in
diabetes and other medical problems that you can download to your computer
or MP3 player to listen to later.

General Web Sites

 National Diabetes Education Initiative: With the National Diabetes
Education Initiative, the federal government is determined to teach
physicians about the importance of meeting the standards of diabetes
care and how to go about doing this. The site for the initiative contains
case studies, a slide library, and podcasts that you can listen to. As
someone with T1DM or the parent of a child with T1DM, you can learn a
lot by looking at its programs; they aren’t too difficult for the educated
non-physician to understand. www.ndei.org/website
 National Diabetes Education Program: The federal government sponsors
the National Diabetes Education Program to improve treatments and
outcomes for people with diabetes, to promote early diagnosis, and to
prevent the onset of diabetes. It’s a vast undertaking. The Web site for

Companies That Make Diabetes Products
The following sections help you find companies that make the products
needed to control your child’s diabetes (or your own). If you have questions
about the proper use of a drug or a device, you can usually find answers at
these Web sites.
Companies are very limited (by the FDA) with respect to the uses of their
products, and often doctors use drugs in ways that have proven successful
but haven’t yet received FDA approval. So you may not find the answers you
need online, in which case you should talk to your child’s doctor.
Glucose meters
The following companies make the meters used by the majority of people
with diabetes. You can expect that these companies will still be around when
your child starts having problems with his meter after a year or two of use.

tional content is accurate.
You can trust the sites that I list here. These are the best of the currently
available Web sites that provide recipes appropriate for a person with dia-
betes. Things change so frequently on the Web that it’s difficult to keep up-
to-date, so check the sites often.
