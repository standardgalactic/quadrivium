INTRODUCTION
Today RSA is still one of the most common and widespread asymmetric cryptosystems. 
A lot of cryptographic protocols that deal with encryption, digital signature, and distribution 
of key information are based on RSA scheme. The basis of scheme’s security is a complex 
theoretical and numerical factorization problem: to find the prime divisors of large n.
The issue of cryptosystem’s security in practice is associated with the task of correct choice 
of cryptosystem parameters. A recent research by a group of scientists led by Arjen Lenstra 
(2012) confirms the problem of RSA implementation, namely generation of parameters that 
will ensure the system’s security in practice. From among 11.5 million of RSA key certificates 
under research there has been found more than 26000 vulnerable keys with size of 1024 bits 
and 10 keys with size of 2048 bits. In this case the vulnerability was to factorize the crypto-
system’s module.
This vulnerability was implemented through the use of common divisors for modules, what 
is more, only a small amount of such common divisors was found as a result of key reissuing 
for the same owner. At most this situation is caused by the presence of the global problem 
of generating “qualitative” modules that are built with large prime numbers (Bernstein et al. 
2013, Heninger et al. 2012), besides, the authors conclude that crossing to larger modules 
does not lead to the expected decrease of vulnerable keys number. The mechanisms for gen-
erating prime numbers that are used for constructing modules should be additionally studied.
Given the above we formulate the problems of effectiveness analysis of applying different 
computational models (including probabilistic, parallel and hybrid) for factorization and dis-
cover the existence of polynomial complexity algorithm of numbers factorization of special 
form; and as a result to clarify practical security of RSA cryptosystem.
We will discover the amount of “secure” RSA modules. If we find out the limited amount 
of such modules of defined size and this limitation turns out to be the polynomial of the 
module’s size then there is a critical issue of RSA security in practice, namely if the cryptan-
alysis or RSA is P (by factoring the module).
Adi Shamir offered the research of RSA module break “cost” of certain length by con-
structing a specific factorization machine (Shamir 1999). This research was continued in 
Shamir, Tromer and Bernstein papers (Shamir et al. 2003, Bernstein 2001). This task is urgent 
now due to cloud computing and flexible computing architecture models (Programmable 
Logic Device (PLD)) rise. To research the impact of new computer (cloud computing, etc.) 
technology on complexity and RSA module break cost is the main idea of the article.

1.1  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL MODELS FOR 
NUMBERS FACTORIZATION
Let us briefly look through the characteristics and applicability of sequential, parallel and 
probabilistic computational models. It should be noted that quantum calculations and their 
applicability to the cryptography problems, in particular factoring problem have gained a 
wide interest in recent years (Zadiraka et al. 2013). P.W. Shor (1999) has proved the polyno-
mial complexity of factorization and discrete logarithm for this computational model. This 
gives an additional possibility to construct effective factor algorithm and to discover more 
precisely the connection between computational models and their practical implementation. 
This topic requires a separate discussion, so it is beyond the scope of this chapter.
The most studied sequential computational model uses determined operations performed 
one after another and the results of the previous calculations are used in the next step. Deter-
ministic factoring algorithms are fully expressed through this model of computations. Today 
there are no practical ways to significantly improve the performance of such factoring algo-
rithms for arbitrary input.
The extension for sequential model is probabilistic. It is a good framework for inherently 
probabilistic algorithms. There are two types of algorithms: Monte Carlo and Las Vegas. The 
algorithms of the first type give the answer that may be correct for some random sequences 
that are generated during the algorithm, but may be incorrect. The probability of false 
answers is reduced by repeated execution of the algorithm.
The Las Vegas algorithms respond correctly or finish with answer “don’t know”. The 
probability of getting an incorrect result is zero. Exactly the study of probabilistic factoring 
algorithms can lead to getting an effective performance of algorithms for numbers factoring 
of special form. This can happen due to the “nature” of Las Vegas algorithm to “split” input 
data by subsets with different estimates of algorithm’s complexity.
Consider the algorithm which can be divided into blocks of operations, the result of which 
indirectly affects the further work, so the branches for independent computing that can be 
executed simultaneously are allowed. This arrangement of computing defines the parallel 
computational model. The application of parallel model for k separated branches is expected 
to give at best the k time’s speedup of algorithm runtime (linear decrease computational 
complexity).
Unfortunately, in practice, to achieve such speedup for factoring algorithm is impossible 
because of the inability to efficiently use CPU time of each of k branches through the exist-
ing need for communication between processors.
The well-known Brent’s review (Brent 1990) states that certain factor algorithms ECM 
(Elliptic Curve Method (Lenstra 1987) for example) are good-suited for parallelization that 
yields almost linear effect of decreasing computational complexity, but some algorithms 
(including rho-Pollard method (Pollard 1975)) can achieve this effect only in theory (Crandall 
1999).
Recent research of Pollard’s method (Crandall 1999, Koundinya 2013) shows that the lin-
ear effect can be achieved only for the small number of parallel branches. Note that there 
are two possible ways to parallelize the algorithm—to build various elements of one random 
sequence, or to look up different sequences. Namely, the application of the second approach 
and possibility of its effective improvement are discussed below.
Note that the mentioned above can be applied only for general factoring algorithms. It is 
clear that these estimates are the upper bounds for factorization the numbers of special form. 
Moreover, the study the effectiveness of factorization algorithms determines the so-called 
problem of “impact of algorithm optimization on the PC’s structure”. Or rather it can be 
defined as the problem of constructing an effective computational model (possibly hybrid) 
for number factoring and discovering its implementation on the base of programmable 
logic devices PLD, GPUs. This confirms the relevance of discovering the existence of time-
efficient factoring algorithms of special numbers, some results are discussed below.

1.2 RHO-POLLARD ALGORITHM
Pollard’s rho-method is a probabilistic algorithm that once made a significant breakthrough 
and still is not completely researched. The complexity of the algorithm does not depend on 
the factor but on its divisors. Thus, like the ECM algorithm (Lenstra 1987), Pollard’s method 
is effective for factoring multi-prime RSA modules, such numbers of fixed length that are the 
product of more than two primes.
Pollard used two simple ideas: the birthday paradox (Sekey 1993) and the ability to check 
divisibility of number n by p computing 
C

xix −1  which plays the 
role of a “random” sequence. Considering it by the module p, where p is a divisor of n there 
must exist two comparable elements.
Pollard chose f x

. These divisors are tested 
as possible for the number n.
This brings up the question—is it possible to obtain a significant improvement in the per-
formance of the algorithm by choosing another recurrent function. The study of this issue 
(Hartman 1982) was carried out only with the use of numerous assumptions that narrow 
the set of numbers to factor. Despite the application of different functions the effectiveness 
turned out to be negative. So we considered the sets of numbers reduced by the module p and 
the capacity of such sets for the following cases: p
p′

p′ + , where p′ is prime; p = 3

(mod ) or 
p = 2

Hartman obtained the following results about the capacity of the sets that are generated 
by different functions.

But to discuss only the size of set does not make sense. It is important to consider how 
much calculations should be done to find an item that is congruent to module p with the previ-
ously calculated one. If the selected function, and therefore, the generated sequence has many 
“small” loops and does not have “long” loops and “tails” then the probability to find quickly 
the decomposition of number n is high (Fig. 1.1). But hypothetically this is possible only under 
the condition that n has only small prime divisors. If sequence has “long” loops then the prob-
ability that the selected starting element will lead us to the desired collision is high and the 
probability of choosing a starting element, which quickly leads to collision, is low.
To use high-degree functions is impractical because of the large time-costs of 
sequence calculations. Using the linear function f

1.3 SELECTING CRYPTO PARAMETERS
Let us define n as a module and e as an exponent for RSA cryptosystem; these parame-
ters are the public key. Cryptosystem’s module is a product of odd primes pi, i
u

where u ≥2, and public exponent e is an integer that takes the value between 3 and n – 1,

Let consider RSA key size as a length of module n in bits. NIST limits the set of key size 
values as 1024, 2048 and 3072 bits. In addition, restrictions are imposed on the generation of 
module n only as a product of two primes n

⋅
p
 (FIPS PUB 186-4-1).
The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1 of version 2.1 and more it is 
allowed to use modules that are the product of more than two numbers (multi-prime 
modules), but it does not determine any restrictions on the choice of divisors. For a fixed 
size of the module the usage of more than two divisors reduces the size of such divi-
sors and thus increases the probability of these modules to be factored by the algorithm, 
the complexity of which depends not on the size of factored number but on the size of 
number’s divisor.
To deploy RSA cryptosystem first we need to select exponent e, fixed or random integer

. It is not permitted to choose random primes p and q to generate module with 
size of 1024 bits, but only those that satisfy the following (FIPS PUB 186-4-1):
– p – 1 has prime divisor p1,
– p + 1 has prime divisor p2,
– q – 1 has prime divisor q1,
– q + 1 has prime divisor q2.
Here p1, p2, q1, q2 are so-called auxiliary primes, p i q are primes with conditions. For 
modules of size 2048 and 3072 bits we may use random primes p, q, that are built using 
probabilistic or constructive algorithms of generating prime numbers (Maurer 1990, Gordon 
1984, Zadiraka et al. 2007, Shawe-Taylor 1986). Table 1.1 shows the limitation on the length 
of numbers when using different algorithms of generating primes. The function len(p) is the 
bit length of p.

Probably the prime number p is a number generated by the following algorithm: to deter-
mine the length of the desired number p; to generate odd random number; to check if 
the number is prime using a probabilistic test. The most widespread is Miller-Rabin test. 
The algorithm tests if given N is prime following the next steps:
1. To calculate t and s so that N

While constructing the module the following requirements on the amount of rounds of 
Miller-Rabin testing of the generated number should be met. This is caused by the decreasing 
probability to choose composite number as a prime with each additional round. Below there 
is the table with the amount of required rounds of testing for error level less than 2–100 is given.
Note that the use of probably prime numbers while implementing the cryptosystem not only 
significantly increases the time of module constructing but in case of mistaken use of compos-
ite number can cause malfunctions, which reduces the resistance to cryptanalysis. So we refer 
to deterministic algorithms that construct prime numbers in polynomial time. With the help 
of these algorithms we can reduce the problem of selecting the module by testing number’s 
primality to the problem of generating provably prime number. Let’s take a look at Maurer’s 
(1990) and Shawe-Taylor’s algorithms (1986). They are the so-called “tornado” algorithms: 
small prime number is used at the first iteration. Each following iteration determines provably 
prime number in a certain range that guarantees an increase of the resulting number.
Maurer’s algorithm of generation of provably prime random number
The input of the algorithm is integer k – the number of bits of the desired prime. The algo-
rithm uses the following parameters: L is the border for trial divisions; M is a parameter that 
ensures the existence of the desired prime. M = 20 is recommended.

However, the above algorithms guarantee only the primality of generated numbers. Addi-
tional requirements for numbers that are divisors of RSA module are the property of their 
so-called “maximization of the complexity of specialized factoring algorithms” (Zadiraka et al. 
2007). For example, for p ± 1 algorithms this property is revealed if n has prime factor p so that 
number p ± 1 has sufficiently large power-smooth boundary (Mukhachev and Khoroshko 2005), 
in other words, p ± 1 has large prime factors. This divisor p is called “strong” prime number. So 
we bring up an important question about the number and the distribution of such strong primes.

Let p be a classic strong prime if the following requirements are met:

 whereby the lower the numbers j, k, l the better.
Note that a generalization of the classical notion of prime number is a concept of strong 
primes that maximize the complexity of all known algorithms for factorization.
R.L. Rivest denied the idea of need to use strong primes as factors for RSA modules (Rivest 
and Silverman 1999). On the base of Lenstra’s algorithm he wanted to show that the choice of 
p did not take an effect on the efficiency of obtaining the factorization, and that, in general, it 
is enough to choose random primes to obtain RSA modules. Later his ideas were refuted, since 
some algorithms, including ECM, work better if the number p −1 is smooth.

Here follows the Gordon’s method of generating strong prime numbers.
1. Construct a random prime number s of pre-selected size. We can select a pseudoran-
dom number x of the desired size and using trial divisions we may leave the numbers in 
the range [ ,

 that do not have small divisors. Among the remaining numbers 
choose prime number s with the help of primality test.
2. Generate random t in the same way.

Let us compare the resulting estimate of the number of RSA modules generated with 
random primes (no requirements for “strong” primes). RSA module is a so-called semiprime 
number because it has exactly two prime factors. The number whose prime factors less partic-
ular bound will be called B-smooth. Works (Ishmukhametov and Sharifullina 2014) present 
the distribution of semiprime and smooth numbers, the estimates are based on Riemann 
hypothesis. Probabilistic function g(y) corresponds the probability that the number y will be 
“semiprime”. Function approximation using series summation by prime numbers p:

But to estimate the capacity of the set of smooth numbers with practically used bounda-
ries this approximation is inapplicable.
The considered estimations of semiprime number’s distribution give an opportunity to present 
the size of the whole set. To solve the problem of RSA crypto parameters choice we should restrict 
this set only by choosing such semiprimes that are not smooth for some smoothness border B in 
order to maximize the complexity of solving the factorization problem of semiprime numbers.
In the above-mentioned notations we are interested in the following estimation for the number 
of semiprimes in the range [2,T] that are not B-smooth (Ishmukhametov and Sharifullina 2014):

On the other hand it is possible to evaluate the amount of B-smooth numbers in [2,T] with 
the help of combinatorial methods and group theory. It makes sense to choose primes as 
smoothness boundary. So having fixed B

 where x < T. Note that the estimates (1.4) and (1.12) 
are close in value, but (1.4) is obtained in much easier way and takes into account the condi-
tion of choosing “strong” primes.
In general, the following statements are applicable for implementing RSA cryptosystems:
1. it is necessary to impose the restrictions for primes that are used for generation RSA mod-
ules for system’s security in practice;
2. the output set algorithms that generate such primes have appreciably less cardinality of a 
set than cardinality of prime number set.

Security estimates updating of asymmetric cryptosystems  for modern computing 9
For these reasons, we formulate the hypothesis that there exists a polynomial complexity 
algorithm that enumerates the set of “secure” RSA modules. The above estimations sup-
port this hypothesis.
1.5  FEATURES OF FACTORIZATION ALGORITHM ELABORATION FOR 
CLOUD COMPUTING
The first problem of factorization price estimating for cloud computing is a form of ordering the 
services, which are typically given by providers. For example, Windows Azure provides services 
in a form of virtual machine with specific characteristics of the CPU, memory and disk space 
(Accessed June 3 2016. http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cloud-services). The 
most powerful architecture which is offered “for working applications with large databases, server 
applications and high-speed applications” (e.g., “D14” has the characteristics of 112 GB RAM, 
800 GB of disk space, 16 core processor) costs $2.611 US per hour or about $1943 US per month.
The cost of computing module rent with random configuration for most cloud 
platforms may be estimated using the on-line calculators (Accessed June 3 2016. 
https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator, http://www.hpcloud.com/pricing). Thus, a com-
puter module in the cloud Google Cloud Platform with the configuration similar to “D14” 
costs $5.36 US per hour, but the monthly rent will cost $689.08 (Accessed June 3 2016. 
http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cloud-services). In HP’s Public cloud the con-
figuration, aimed at calculating the maximum power (30 HP Cloud Compute Units, 4 virtual 
cores, 60GB RAM, 540GB ephemeral disk) is $1.35/hr ($985.50/mo.) (Accessed June 3 2016. 
http://www.hpcloud.com/pricing). You can also choose virtually unlimited (theoretically—only 
for the price) number of such machines.
So, to order a specific computing architecture targeted at particular factorization algo-
rithm is difficult, so you need to rely on many computing nodes of standard minimum con-
figuration aimed at powerful calculations that operate in parallel. The price of this node (e.g., 
n1-highcpu-2 for the cloud Google Cloud Platform) is $38.84 per month.
The second problem is that for factorization price estimating it is also necessary to choose 
the fastest at present, universal (which can be used for any kind of numbers) algorithm, 
which allows the simple implementation of a parallel computing model. The choice of this 
algorithm for factorization price estimating has similar value to the choice of the universal 
models of computation (Turing-Post machine, normal Markovian algorithm, brute-force 
program, etc.) for algorithms complexity estimate.
The generally accepted solution to this problem is the choice of algorithm GNFS (Buhler 
et al. 1993, Lenstra and Lenstra 1993, Couveignes 1993, Ishmukhametov and Sharifullina 
2014). This algorithm, like the most effective factorization algorithms at present time oper-
ates quite a simple idea, proposed by Fermat, such as: if you find a pair of numbers (A,B), 
that satisfy the equation A
B
n

B =
B2
B

(

1,2,… calculate the value of polynomial q

 until q(x) is not a perfect square.
A simple generalization of Fermat’s idea is to search for pairs of numbers that satisfy 
more general equation A
B
2

B

B2
B
( )
n
mod
 (Ishmukhametov and Sharifullina 2014). Along 
with this, it appears that the value of the polynomial q(x) is the so-called “smooth” numbers. 
A pair of integers (A,B), is called “smooth” (on base factor F, formed of primes) if:
1. The relation A
B
2
2
B

 is performed.
2. B is multiplied only by prime factors that belong to the set F.
Representation of polynomial values q(x) by the elements of a vector space over F to 
search the full squares has led to Dixon algorithm first, then to quadratic sieve (QS), but 
as a generalization of the latter—the general number field sieve (GNFS). We will briefly 
present the main stages of this algorithm to discuss major evaluations of its performance 
(Ishmukhametov and Sharifullina 2014):

 called “sieve area”.
 7. Let θ – root of polynomial f1(x). Consider the polynomial ring Z[θ] (practically root θ is 
not evaluated, and is only used for formal description of the algorithm). Define the alge-
braic factor base FB1, consisting of a first-order polynomial form a
bθ  with the norm 
which is prime number. These polynomials are simple irreducibility elements in the ring 
of algebraic field K
Q[ ]]. The absolute value of the norms of polynomials from factor 
base FB1 are bound above by some constant B1.
 8. At the same time let define rational factor base FB2, consisting of all prime numbers 
bound above by second constant B2.
 9. To be able to check the final stage of the algorithm, whether the determined polynomial 
is perfect square, we define a relatively small set of polynomials c
dθ  of the 1 order, the 
norm of which is also a simple number. Let this set be marked as FB3. It must satisfy the 
condition FB
FB

B ∩

∅ is called Quadratic Character Factor Base.
 10. Further simultaneous sieving of polynomials based on FB1 is performed and integers 
based on FB2 to obtain the set M, consisting of smooth pairs (a,b). The pair (a,b) is called 
smooth if GCD(
)
a b
,
=1 and the polynomial a
bθ  and the number a
bm are multiplied 
entirely by the relevant factor bases FB1 and FB2. The number of smooth pairs in the set 
M must exceed the total power of three factor bases at least by two units.
 11. The next step is to search the subset S

 so that the product of all pairs (
)
a

H2 and pairs (

 To search the set S as in the quadratic sieve 
method, a system of linear algebraic equations is formulated with coefficients from of 
the set F2

 12. Next we form the polynomial:

 13. If the whole procedure is performed correctly, then the polynomial g(θ) is a perfect 
square in the ring of polynomials Z[θ]. We extract square roots of the polynomial g(θ) 
and an integer B2, finding some polynomial α(θ) and the number B.
 14. Replace the polynomial α(θ) with the number α(m).
 15. So, a pair of integers (A, B), satisfying the condition A

Security estimates updating of asymmetric cryptosystems  for modern computing 11
As seen from the description of the main stages of the algorithm there are two key parameters 
that affect its complexity—the size of the sieve area and the size of factor base. The complexity

If we take this estimate for the number of computing nodes of “minimal” configuration then 
the factorization cost estimate of 1024-bit number is hundred trillion US dollars, if the number 
is factorized during a month, which of course is much worse than the factorization cost esti-
mates specially designed by using the devices for factorization (TWIRL or SHARK) (Shamir and 
Tromer 2003, Franke 2005). So the cost of the system SHARK (Franke 2005) for factorization 
of 1024-bit number is evaluated 160 million US dollars, if the number is factorized during a year.
Such estimate is explained first of all, by the lack of flexibility of cloud computing services 
order, and, secondly, by the direct use of existing implementations of the algorithm GNFS for 
cloud technologies. The doubtless advantage of cloud computing that determines the relevance 
of further research in this area, is their relatively greater availability compared to specialized cal-
culators and opportunity to use the so-called “peak-mobilization” operation mode in “critical” 
cases—the use of cloud resources across the corporation, state and international association.
1.6 CONCLUSIONS
Existing standards of implementation and usage of asymmetric cryptosystems impose 
restrictions on the crypto parameters generation. This situation is conditioned by modern 
advances in solving the problem of factorization of large numbers. The interest of assessing 
RSA security in practice is the highlighted issue of size or rather the nature of size growth 
of the set of secure crypto parameters, namely semiprime numbers that have additional con-
straints about their divisors.

INTRODUCTION
The strategy of creating solution (control choice) based on information about the current 
position of the dynamic process goes back to the classic works of N.N. Krasovskii. These are 
his monograph (Krasovskii 1970) and the subsequent book in coauthorship with A.I. Sub-
botin (Krasovskii and Subbotin 1974). Employment of the Extremal Targetting Rule, devel-
oped in (Krasovskii 1970), allows for the game termination in the “first absorption” time in 
the regular and regularized cases. Similar result was obtained by B.N. Pshenichnyi (1968) 
with the use of the convex analysis technique. On the one hand, this method is the result of 
extension of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to the game problems. On the other hand, it 
justifies the Euler law of goal interception, known as the “Line of Sight Law”.
The Extremal Targetting Rule appeared to be very fruitful. Many scientists did research in 
this direction. B.N. Pshenichnyi Yu.N. Onopchuk adopted this method to the case of integral 
constraints on controls (Pshenichnyi and Onopchuk 1968). G.Ts. Chikrii extended the result 
of B.N. Pshenichnyi (1968) to the non-stationary case (Chikrii G.Ts. 1995). J.S. Rappoport 
studied the case of mixed controls (Krasovskii and Subbotin 1974). Positional conflict con-
trol by the systems of integral and integro-differential equations was studied in the papers 
of V.L. Pasikov (Krasovskii and Subbotin 1974), G.Ts. Chikrii and K. Volyanskij (2002). 
Complex positional problems of the group pursuit were first stated and solved in the works 
of S.I. Tarlinskij (1976), A.A. Chikrii (1979), A.A. Chikrii and J.S. Rappoport (1978). A.Ye. 
Perekatov and A.A. Chikrii (1993) examined the problem of positional pursuit of a group of 
evaders by controlled moving object (the problem of “commercial traveler” type).
Investigations of M.S. Gabrielyan and A.V. Kryazhimskii (1983) are devoted to the study 
of positional conflict counteraction of controlled objects groups. It should be noted that, 
from mathematical point of view, the Extremal Targetting Rule, as applied to linear systems, 
is based on using the apparatus of support functions, the notion of Aumann integral of set-
valued mapping and the Lyapunov theorem on vector measures.
Due to the positional formalization, N.N. Krasovskij (1985) proved the theorems of alter-
native, dividing the game space into the players’ preference domains. In the case of failure 
of the “saddle point condition in small game” the alternative can be formulated in terms of 
strategy of one player and counterstrategy of another. Under the same condition, an asser-
tion on alternative can be stated in mixed strategies.
Because of the problem on existence of solution of the differential equations, arising in 
such formalization, B.N. Pshenichnyi (1969) introduced the notion of ε-strategy being the 
development of ideas of Pontryagin’s (1988) Alternated Integral Method. Thus, there exist 
many methods of constructing positional controls in conflict condition.

14 Recent advances in information technology
In this chapter, we suggest a general scheme for investigation of conflict-controlled proc-
esses, illustrated on various types of functional-differential systems.
Note that application of the method of resolving functions (A.A. Chikrii 1997) to similar 
problems is based on another assumption on information availability, that leads to control 
choice in the class of counter- or quasi-strategies.
2.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT, TIME OF THE “FIRST ABSORPTION”
Let a state of the conflict-controlled process at arbitrary moment of time t, t ≥ t0 ≥ 0, be 
described by the vector:

where u(s) and v(s) are measurable functions. We denote by u(.) and v(.) elements of the sets 
ΩU, ΩV, respectively.
Also, a cylindrical terminal set M*, M* ⊂ Rn, is specified:
 
M
+
M0
M
, 
(2.2)
where M0 is a linear subspace in Rn and M is a convex compact from the orthogonal comple-
ment L to M0 in Rn, M ∈coK(L). We suppose that g(t0) ∉M*.
The goal of the pursuer (u) is to bring a trajectory of the object (2.1) to the terminal set in 
the shortest time, whereas the evader (v) tries to avoid the encounter of the trajectory with 
the set. The game is terminated at the moment T, T > t0, such that z(T) ∈M* or π z(T) ∈M.
Let us take the side of the first pursuer side and find the guaranteed time of the game 
termination. We assume that on the half-interval [t0, t) and at t ≥ t0 the players employ admis-
sible controls:

Let us suppose that the minimum is attained. We assume that the time of “first absorp-
tion” is finite, that is T0 < +∞. That the time T0 is the minimal instant of time at which 
π g (T0) ∈W (T0,t0), means that T0 is the minimal time in which the first player, knowing 
beforehand the second player’s control for all the time ahead, can steer the system trajectory 
to the terminal set M*. Let us show that T0 > t0. Using formulas (2.5), (2.8), we obtain:

As g(t0) ∉M, then λ(t0,t0,g(t0)) < 0, whence follows that T0 ≠ t0.
Lemma 2.1. If T(t, ut(.),vt(.)) = t, then z(t) ∈M.
Proof. Let on the half-interval [t0,t) the players employed the controls ut(⋅), ut(⋅) ∈ ΩU and vt(⋅), 
vt(⋅) ∈ ΩV. If T (t, ut(⋅), vt(⋅)) = t, then there follows from the definition (2.5) that λ(t, t, z (t, t, 
ut(⋅), vt(⋅))) ≥ 0. By the formula (2.4):

There follows from the time of “first absorption” that the first player is aware of the sec-

first player can terminate the game no later than now of “first absorption”, under the condi-
tion that the first player constructs its control based on information on current position of 
the game.
Theorem 2.1. Let for the game (2.1), (2.2) following conditions hold:
1. set-valued mapping W(T, t) is non-empty (W(T, t) ≠ ∅), the time of “first absorption” is

 is vector-function, jointly continuous in its variables.
It is evident how this game can be reduced to the integral one. Integrating both sides of the 
equation (2.49) over the interval

Then, the technique presented in the Section  2.4, can be applied to analyze the inte-

Further considerations lead to the results analogous to those presented in (Pshenichnyi 
1969). We give them without proof. Namely, the assumptions of the theorem 2.1 are fulfilled 
if following conditions on the game parameters are fulfilled, one of the inequalities to be 
strictly satisfied:
 
ρ
σ

Note that at t = 0 the left-hand side of the equation (2.57) is equal to x
y
0
0y , while the 
right-hand side turns into zero. Besides, as t →+∞ the former has bounded value while the 
latter is linearly converging to infinity, by virtue of the condition ρ
α
σ
β
≥
.
Since both sides of equation (2.56) are continuous functions, the time of “first absorption” 
is finite for any initial position. That is why, the control of the pursuer, realizing the game 
goal, is uniquely defined, namely,

Thus, if one of the inequalities (2.66) or (2.67) are fulfilled, then the conditions of the

2.10 CONFLICT-CONTROLLED IMPULSE SYSTEMS
The impulse processes, in their number those affected by pushes and thrusts, are thor-
oughly studied in the monographs (Samoilenko and Perestyuk 1987, Krivonos et al. 2005, 

46 Recent advances in information technology
Zavalishchin and Sesekin 1991), containing in addition, extensive bibliography on this sub-
ject. Specific feature of the impulse process is that its solution appears as discontinuous func-
tion, more precisely, as function of bounded variation without singular component.
By the Lebesgue theorem (Natanson 1957), such solution is a sum of absolutely continu-
ous function and function of no more than countable number of jumps. Game problems 
for such processes are analyzed in the book (Krivonos et al. 2005), where the push-affected 
systems are explored on the basis of the method of resolving functions (Chikrii A.A. 1997, 
Chikrii A.A. 2010, Chikrii A.A. and Chikrii G.Ts. 2014).
In this section we employ a solution representation, going back to the monograph 
(Samoilenko and Perestyuk 1987), in which the explicit form of the Dirac δ - function is not 
used. Let us consider a quasilinear conflict-controlled process:

Here A(t) – is a matrix function with elements which are added together on arbitrary finite 
time interval, U(t) and V(t) (the players control domains) are measurable compact-valued 
mappings, function φ(t, u, v) (the control unit) satisfies the Caratheodori condition (jointly 
continuous in u, v and measurable in t). Besides, the following inequality is assumed to hold:

(2.69)
where c(t) is a scalar function, sum up on an arbitrary finite time interval.
The process (2.68) is impulse affected (Samoilenko and Perestyuk 1987), namely a trajec-
tory of the system (2.68) has the first-order discontinuities at the given points:

(2.71)
where M0 is a linear subspace of Rn, M(t) – a measurable compact-valued mapping taking its 
values in L – orthogonal complement to M0 in Rn.
The goal of the first player (u) is, by acting at the process with help of admissible controls, 
constructed on the basis of information on current position (t, z), in the shortest time to drive 
a trajectory of the system (2.68) – (2.70) to the terminal set, under any counteraction of the 
second player (v).
Admissible controls u(τ) and v(τ) chosen, solution to the system (2.1) has the form (an

It is readily seen that the solution representation (2.72) presents itself a particular case of 
(2.1). That is why the scheme of positional approaching the terminal set (see Sections 2.3 and 
2.4) is applicable in the case under study.
2.11 GAME PROBLEMS FOR PROCESSES WITH FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES
In this section we consider the conflict-controlled processes whose evolution is described 
by the fractional-order systems. Formulas for the solution representation are given pointing 
to the fact that positional approach is applicable to study these processes. In so doing, we 
restrict ourselves to the cases of classical derivatives of Riemann – Liouville and the regu-
larized derivatives of Dzharbashyan – Nersesyan – Caputo. As follows from the results of 
works (Chikrii A.A., Matychyn I., Gromaszek K. and Smolarz A. 2011, Chikrii A.A. a 2008, 
Chikrii A.A. b 2008) similar representation can be obtained in the cases of the Miller – Ross 
and Hilfer sequential derivatives.
It should be mentioned that analogous game problems are studied in (Chikrii A.A., 
Matychyn I., Gromaszek K. and Smolarz A. 2011) on the basis of the method of resolving 
functions.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes the information technologies, that allow inflected languages to the 
sign languages (for hearing impaired/deaf people) for, using machine translation (Barmak 
et al. 2012), (Barmak et al. 2013), (Barmak et al. 2014), (Krak & Romanyshyn 2014), (Krak 
et al. 2011), (Krak et al. 2012), (Krak et al. 2014). The main aim of the research is to elaborate 
new computer systems for training and communication for the deaf people.
According to World Health Organization, there are about 70 million deaf people (and peo-
ple with severe hearing loss) who use sign language as their first language or mother tongue. 
That are tens of millions of people for whom it is necessary create equivalent means for 
communication in society. Due to Paragraph 7 of the Rules Appendix 5 to UN Resolution 
48/96 “Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities” 
these needs have been expressed as follows: “We need to take care of that sign language was 
used for teaching deaf children, in their families and communities. We should also provide 
services in sign language to facilitate communication with other deaf people.” If we consider 
that people with hearing disabilities need to communicate with family, friends, neighbors, the 
circle of people with whom they maintain contact will be hundreds of millions of people. 
Despite the rehabilitation work on verbal language learning, the communication with the 
deaf person is characterized by certain difficulties.
The main form of communication of deaf people is sign language. Sign language has 
national characteristics. People with hearing impairments use two sign languages which have 
different grammar and a different set of gestures for communication:
1. conversational sign language used in everyday communication and has its own (different 
from natural spoken) grammar;
2. tracing sign language used in official and business environment (includes gestures and 
manual alphabet, which is used to play words with the letters given), has no own grammar, 
uses the rules of national language grammar.
The rapid development of computer technology, its availability in a variety of mobile 
devices, development of appropriate technologies as software and hardware (distributed data-
bases, cloud computing, Internet technologies, etc.) encourages their involvement in intensive 
solution of socially significant problems. One of these problems is the inclusion of deaf in 
active social life. The main obstacle to solving this problem is difficulty in communication 
between deaf and hearing people. Information technology for nonverbal communication of 
deaf could help to solve this problem.

52 Recent advances in information technology
Sign Language (SL) of deaf is a natural language that conveys information through move-
ment of hands and fingers, facial expressions, position the body. It is used as a component 
for communication between people and serves as the primary means of communication for 
deaf people. Sign languages are not like ordinary visual interpretation. They have their own 
grammar, which can be used to discuss a variety of topics from simple and specific – to the 
sublime or abstract. Vocabulary of SL is still poorly understood, especially idiomatic, phra-
seology, morphology.
Automatic attribution of SL to all forms of verbal and written language is not entirely 
true, because you cannot consider SL in traditional models of linguistics. The most suitable 
description of the conversational SL morphology is the principle of value to the form. The 
values of “plurality”, “time”, “accessories”, “expiry” in SL are expressed in specific ways. 
The way of doing gestures (quality of movement) changes depending on the importance of 
gesture. Due the problem of building automated translation from text to SL can be repre-
sented as forming the pairs of mutually unambiguous structures in inflected language and 
SL, that convey the sense of information. Flexion (ending) is used to express grammatical 
meanings in inflected languages (Indo-European and Semitic-hatski).
3.1  THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF AUTOMATED TRANSLATION 
SYSTEM DESIGN
Automatic translation of inflected languages into natural SL involves the establishment of 
appropriate information technology. The part of the technology is to apply specific conver-
sion to input sentence in inflectional language that would give the original sentence in SL. 
These changes include the following mechanisms:
1. building correlations between gestures and words;
2. building correlations between grouped sentences (certain grammatical structures) in SL 
and inflected languages to ensure proper transmission of meaning;
3. expanding the set of existing correlations (between words and gestures, grammatical struc-
tures) to improve the quality of translation;
4. translation prediction in cases where the sentence didn’t match existing grammatical 
structures.
Transfer approach was selected to build the automated translation system (Dugast et al. 
2007) (Senellart 2006). The basic idea of building an automated translation system is to use 
bilingual corps of inflectional language sentences and corresponding sentences in SL. Bilingual 
pairs of sentences are analyzed on this base. For each word or the inflectional language sen-
tence the corresponding gesture of SL sentence is determined. Similarly, in structure sentences 
are grouped as grammar translation constructions. Grammar translation constructions have 
set of words (that can be used in fixed positions) instead of words. After analyzing the gram-
mar translation constructions based on the inflectional parameters of the set of words, the sets 
are summarized and can be represented as generalized grammar constructions of translation. 
Generalized grammar constructions allow to determine the grammatical structure of sentences 
corresponding in SL by analyzing the inflectional parameters of input sentence.
Chart of the information technology area
The goal of characterized translation information technology is to implement it as a Web 
service, that will use the software on different platforms, including:
1. automated translation of inflected language sentences to SL sentences,
2. provide functionality to extend the existing system,
3. statistically process the translated sentences for self-learning.

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 53
The term “Web service” describes a standardized way of integrating web-based, Inter-
net applications using common standards and network protocols. Web service is a software 
application or information resource, access to which is carried out remotely using standard 
Internet protocols. It is important, that Web services enable access to software components, 
regardless of how these components work, where and in what platform they are located, and 
who offered physical or informational resources. Web services support the integration and 
interaction with other software components using XML-like messages. Interfaces and com-
munication Web services are defined, described and are also using the XML language.
To achieve this goal, the information technology shown on the block diagram (Fig. 3.1) is 
proposed. Its essence lies in the following steps of transforming the input:
1. Users submit input information for translation. Entry information can be presented in 
the form of text, image recognition or audio file. Using software on various platforms, 
information is transmitted to a processing web service;
2. Web service should contain functions to transfer the input information from inflectional 
language to sign language; functions to display the translated information as 3D-models 
using individual settings of recognition of sign language; functions for system administra-
tion and extension;
3. Translated sign language sentence is returned to the user. When automatic translations of 
input sentence cannot be performed, system tries to forecast translation and allows user to 
choose the most adequate. The translation may be provided in the form of data informa-
tion on 3D models, or descriptions of gestures in text format;
4. The scientists of SL have access to the service with the possibility of the administration for 
handling unusual situations and correction of the system.
To perform translation from inflected language to sign language the set models of inflected 
language are used (Shirokov 1998), (Shirokov 2004), (Shirokov et al. 2005) to enable appro-
priate modeling of related inflected and sign language grammar. Only simple sentences trans-
lation will be considered. Subject and predicate of sentences are linked with predicate bond. 
Any complex sentence can be represented as a combination of the simple sentences.
The presence of the following components is necessary for the operation of automated 
translation (see. Fig. 3.2):

54 Recent advances in information technology
1. dictionaries of inflected and sign languages;
2. relations between grouped sentences (grammatical structures) of inflected and sign 
languages;
3. relations between words of inflected language and gestures;
4. statistical database for self-learning;
5. In order to support this solution, the dictionary of inflected language with the following 
contents;
6. the set of basic word forms (basic word forms are used as base for all the other word 
forms, such as a for noun in the Ukrainian language the basic word form is nominative 
singular, for verb—infinitive);
7. the set of inflections (by flexion we define how basic word forms are converted to all 
other word forms: endings, affixes, postfixes, changes of extension, changes in the basis of 
word);
8. the set of grammatical categories of inflection (data sets can contain number, gender, case, 
person, time, status, mode depending on the morphological features of language);
9. the set of parts of speech (set of parts of speech depending on morphological features 
language: noun, adjective, numeral, verb).
The provided data sets allow not to store the set of all words of the language (for inflected 
languages it’s pretty redundant) and form the words “on the fly” using basic word form 
and inflection. This significantly reduces the amount of information stored and allows us 
to perform determine the inflectional parameters of the input speech. Based on the data in 
provided sets, it is possible to generate the set of words and phrases of inflected language.
Dictionary of sign language contains a notation of gestures, their emotional state and 
subjects in which gestures are most often used. This allows to form a set of gestures.
The relation between the grammatical structures of inflected and sign language sentences 
is submitted as a generalized grammatical structures these sentences.
On one hand, the generalized grammar structures of inflected languages include:
 1. a number that reflects the position of the element (word) in sentence;
 2. inflectional parameters of words that can be used in this position;
 3. parts of speech, which may or may not be used in this position;

 4. On the other hand—generalized grammar structures of sign language include;
 5. a number that reflects the position of the element (sign) in sentence;
 6. the corresponding item number in inflected language sentence;
 7. parts of speech corresponding to gestures of SL sentence;
 8. Statistical database is used to analyze sentences already translated. It considers;
 9. subject of the sentence;
10. grammatical structures;
11. frequency of sentences translation.
Every translated sentence is stored in a statistical database and has assigned a unique 
(ID) number. After the translation, this number is associated with a number of SL sentence 
for high speed translation of often translated sentences. In case of the translation predic-
tion, user is given several options for translation. User-selected options are saved to improve 
translation quality in future. The sentences, with poor translation results are also stored and 
marked for further processing by authorized persons. The technology of the system-aided 
translation is given in Fig. 3.3:
The information technology of aided translation consists of the following steps:
 1. The input sentence is searched for phrases. The phrase is a set consisting of a sequence 
of words.
 2. The inflectional parameters are defined for each of the words and phrases of the input 
sentence.
 3. Generalized grammatical structure is determined based on the parameters of inflection 
(part of speech and inflectional category) for each word of the input sentence. General-
ized structure of inflected language contains a number that reflects the position of the 
element sentences, inflectional parameters of words and parts of speech that may or may 
not be used in this position.
 4. If the generalized structure is not found, the search is performed for similar structures.
 5. After finding generalized structure of translation that meets the input sentence, we get 
the corresponding generalized natural sign structure.
 6. The search of “word → gesture” combinations are made for each word of input sentences.

 7. If generalized structure of inflected language sentence is found, the corresponding gen-
eralized SL structure is selected, all compliances “word → gesture” are found, then the 
resulting sign language sentence is formed and output result is presented.
 8. If generalized sentence structure of inflected language which overlaps with the structure 
of the input sentence is found, an attempt to forecast the translation is made. The gener-
alized sentence structure that partially coincides with the input is used. Next, SL sentence 
is formed, using matching “word → gesture”.
 9. If there are no generalized structures that overlap with the structure of the input sen-
tence is found, the sentence is added to the statistical database for further processing. 
If for some words the input sentence appropriate gesture is not found, such a word is 
marked in statistical base for further processing.
 10. The user chooses one of the options after receiving the result.
 11. The result is satisfactory. The sentences are marked as correct and added to the statistical base.
 12. The result was not satisfactory and ought to be corrected manually. Corrected sentences 
are stored in the statistical base and marked for revision and future decision-making.
 13. In case of generalized structure sentences or “word → gesture” matching was not found 
or the result of translation is not satisfactory the authorized translator can add new 
translation structure, modify already existing structure, add “word → gesture” reference 
or add a new gesture.
The phrase is a syntactic unit formed by a combination of two or more words related to 
each other in content and grammatically. If any member of the sentence is a phrase than 
regardless of whether it is phraseological or free, the phrase has a certain semantic autonomy. 
When translating a sentence, we need to define phrases from the set of words and consider 
that when analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences. For phrases in a sentence search 
purposes the following workflow (see Fig. 3.4) is proposed:
1. sentence is divided into an ordered set of words using spaces and punctuation and served 
as an ordered set of words,
2. words that contain hyphens are selected from the set of words and their search set of 
phrases is made,
3. we select all pairs of consecutive words and search for phrases that matched pairs,
4. similar searches are made for phrases consisting of three or more words,
5. if a sequence of words found in a set of phrases, then this sequence is labeled as one ele-
ment of a sentence.

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 57
To determine the generalized grammatical structure of input sentence (according to 
the Fig. 3.5) the following workflow is applied:
1. querying statistical database if the sentence was translated before;
2. the inflectional parameters are determined for each word and phrase of input sentence 
using vocabulary of inflected language;
3. a search of generalized grammatical structures is made, for which the first element of a 
generalized structure includes inflection category corresponding to the first word of a 
sentence, the second element—the second word of each sentence;
4. if no appropriate grammatical structure is found the system searches for “similar” struc-
tures that overlap with the set: structures in which all parameters of all elements of inflec-
tion, except one match the input sentence.
The following functionalities are necessary to enable system scalability and improve trans-
lation quality by authorized persons:
1. statistics on the frequency of use of grammar structures for translation;
2. receiving and processing a set of sentences, for which translation result is unsatisfactory;
3. receiving and processing a set of sentences for which generalized grammar structures are 
not found, but translation is successful prediction based on similar structures;
4. viewing and editing correspondence between words of inflected language and gestures of SL.
To ensure processing of sentences that are translated incorrectly the next functional opera-
tors are required:
1. adding new generalized grammar constructions,
2. editing the existing structures,
3. editing the elements of generalized grammar constructions.
Functionality for editing generalized grammar constructions includes:
1. adding and removing sets of parts of speech and inflection parameters,
2. adding set of words that may or may not be used in the generalized grammatical construc-
tions at certain positions.

To ensure the elaboration of sentences for which translation prediction was made the fol-
lowing functions are required:
1. creating new grammatical structures through design, used in translation prediction,
2. adding new generalized grammar constructions,
3. editing existing generalized grammar constructions,
4. editing elements of generalized grammar.
Presentation of dictionaries for translation
The grammar dictionary construction of inflected language is determined by the presence 
of inflection formal models. This means establishing and formalizing linguistic criteria 
according to which the entire set of words of the language is divided into specific subsets, 
whose mutual intersection of which is empty, and inside each inflection the same rules 
occurs. A subset of words with such properties are interchangeable paradigmatic types 
(Shirokov 2004).
By paradigmatic type we consider the group of tokens, the inflectional paradigm for which 
is characterized by the same number of grammatical forms, within which inflection is on 
the same (single) rule. For example, for Ukrainian language (which is the type of analytic-
synthetic language), this means that the words that belong to a paradigmatic class have the 
same flexes in same inflections; corresponding to analytical forms built on the same model of 
formation (Shirokov 1998).
Categories of inflection or various languages may differ, depending on the language: 
for example, in the Ukrainian language there are four inflections, in Latvian – six, in 
Armenian – seven, while in most inflected languages only have one. Also, the most inflected 
languages don’t have grammatical category of gender. These paradigmatic types exist for the 
Ukrainian language (see Table 3.1).
Based on the definition inflectional language words of inflected language are modeled as 
a combination of constant and variable components:
 
x
c x
f x
(x
(
f
),  
(3.1)
where c(x) – part of token x, which is in the process of inflection remains unchanged (quasi 
base), f(x) – its variable component (quasi flexion), & – concatenation.
The implementation of such word storage model has the excessive redundancy. For exam-
ple, in the Ukrainian language there are several millions of words (all inflection) and only

about 100 thousand basic word forms. Instead of storing the entire word to database, we 
store an id of basic word form from the appropriate set of basic word forms, the number of 
positions in the word to which the base word form is unchanged and the id of flexion (the 
variable part of the word) from the appropriate set.
Given the characteristics of inflected languages (Shirokov 1998), (Shirokov 2004), (Shirokov 
et al. 2005) the dictionary of inflected language is shown as a set of parameters words:

where Wi – parameters of words of inflected language ( i = 0, Λ, N–1; N – the number of 
words in the dictionary); F – the set of all possible word endings (inflections); k – item 
number in the basic word forms, where concatenation with flexion begins (k = 0 – for word 
forms completely different from the basic word forms); In – set of inflection parameters of 
inflectional language (for Ukrainian inflection parameters are number, gender, case, person,

Some difficulty arises for the inverse problem (H−1): finding three parameters for existing 
words that define it clearly. Implementation of operator (3.5) for the database as a non-
deterministic function leads to inability of indexing table. To solve this problem, the algo-
rithm is proposed (see Fig. 3.7).
The input word is broken down into all possible combinations of constant and variable 
components, and the search is conducted on indexed fields of sets of basic word forms (I) 
and inflections (F):

Sign language dictionary structure is simpler due to the absence of inflection in it. 
In non-verbal communication mimic component plays a very important and sometimes 
crucial role. It should be noted that the syntax of sign language is characterized by non-
manual marker: the questioning sentences with general questions—raising eyebrows; in a 
separate (private) question—omission of eyebrows and head tilted forward; in denial—
negative head movements, the corresponding expression; in narrative sentences it is char-
acterized by facial emotional color that corresponds to the meaning of the information 
transmitted.

Presentation of translation grammar structures correspondences
When interpreter translates from one language to another mutually we receive unambiguous 
pairs of structures that convey meaning: sentence in input language → appropriate sentence 
in the output language. Suppose that these structures pairs can be represented as a certain 
generalization. After analyzing certain amount of sentences pairs obtained by translation, 
we can get a generalization by fixing the order of words in a sentence. The generalization 
instead of specific words in the sentence has the sets of words that can be used at these fixed 
locations. Thus, in relation to the total sentences, the small amount of grammar structures 
for translation is received.
The sequence of words of the language and punctuation is understood as the sentence. 
The sequence of words of the language related to the parts of speech that convey meaning 
(function words of sentences is rejected) is considered as grammatical sentence structure. 
The grammatical sentence structures, based on the number of words in them are also distin-
guished. Elements of grammar sentence structures (unlike sentences) are the sets of words 
in sentences that will be used at fixed positions. This approach is presented in the Fig. 3.8:

Formation of the set of grammar structures based on bilingual corpus of sentences of 
inflectional language and sign language is as follows (Fig. 3.9):
1. in the set of sentences contained in the corpus we search for sentences that overlap. If 
distinction between words is only one of the elements, only one sentence ought to be 
chosen;
2. conduct grouping of sentences and get a sequence of words that can be used at fixed posi-
tions in each of these sentences;
3. conduct analysis of sequences, determine whether each sequence of words can be used in 
every sentence, find exceptions, add to sequence other similar words, which can be used in 
this position;
4. after analyzing the sequences of words a grammatical sentence structure is formed;
5. add grammar constructions to sentences set, again search for sentences and grammatical struc-
tures that overlap to expand grammatical structures. For example, having a corps of sentences:
 
 a. 
. (He has a brother)
 
 b
. (She has a brother)
 
 c
. (She loves a brother)
 
 d. 
. (She loves a cat)
6. conduct their generalization. The first sentence overlaps with the second and third sen-
tence, but is different from the fourth. As the result of such synthesis, instead of getting 
the first three sentences, the grammatical sentence structure is achieved:
 
 a. {
.
7. This grammatical structure overlaps with the fourth sentence of the corps, allowing to 
expand it to {
}. Repeat this step, for as long as 
grammar will not cease to expand;
8. search for grammar structures in which sequences overlap and provide analysis of 
sequences for grammar structures expansion.
After receiving a set of grammatical constructions we analyze each of the sets of elements 
that go into it. By generalized grammatical constructions we understand a construction that

Generalized grammatical structures contain the sets inflectional parameters of inflected 
language on fixed positions. For SL in generalized grammatical structures we also store the 
position of the element in the generalized grammatical structures of inflected language (see 
Fig. 3.10).
Elements of generalized grammatical structures may be union or intersection of sets of 
certain inflectional parameters. Generalized grammatical structure can contain elements of 
certain part of speech, or exclude them. Additionally, to the sets of inflectional parameters 
generalized grammatical structure can contain a sequence of words which can or cannot be 
used. Examples of elements of generalized grammar structures are given for the Ukrainian 
language in Table 3.2:
Formation of the set of generalized grammar structures (Fig. 3.11) based on grammar 
translation is as follows:
1. for each grammar sentences structure a generalized grammatical structure is built: for 
each set of words inflectional parameters of the language common to all of its elements 
are defined;
2. after forming generalized grammatical structure, check its accuracy based on sentences 
from bilingual corps;
3. after forming a set of generalized grammatical structure analysis is performed to define 
the structures that overlap (based on parts of speech and inflectional parameters that are 
used) and its possible merge;

4. if we get a new generalized grammatical structure due to merging, check its accuracy 
based on sentences from bilingual corpus that match the design.
Obtaining correspondences between words of inflected language and gestures of sign language
When translating sentences, the availability of a set of correspondences between words of 
inflected language and gestures of SL is required in addition to determining the grammatical 
structure of sentences. The approach for creating grammar structures for translation (3.8) 
involves the formation of a sequence of words Seq (3.9), which can be used (correspondence 
between specific positions of words in sentences of inflectional language and gestures cor-
responding to a sequence of gestures Gseq (3.10)). The number in the sequence of words in 
sentences for each word is determined (3.9). This number is used to get matching gesture in 
corresponding sequence of gestures for the given word.
For generalized grammar structures of translation (3.11), grammatical inflectional categories 
are used instead of word sequences. It is necessary to create a mechanism of presentation of the 
correspondences between words of inflected language (3.2) and gestures (3.7). The set of rela-
tionships between words of inflected language and gestures is described by the equation (3.12):

(3.12)
To create a set of relations, chosen sequences of words and gestures are used:
1. for each grammatical structure the list of sequences and gesture sequences is defined;
2. for each words in the sequence of words, the pairs “word → gesture” are searched;
3. if the set of matches doesn’t contain a pair of “word → gesture”, add it to the set.
The process of forming a set of correspondences between words of inflected language and 
gestures is shown in Fig. 3.12.
If the formation of the set of correspondences between words and gestures (3.12) gives sev-
eral translations for a single word, it is necessary to analyze the grammar structure (3.8), con-
taining the sequence with these words. For generalized grammar structures (3.11), obtained

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 65
from grammar structures (3.8), containing words with variability of translation, it is necessary 
to add or remove a set of inflectional categories or sequences, to select the correct translation.
For example, the word of Ukrainian language «
» (walk) can be translated into 
sign language differently, depending on the context: the result of the translation of sentence 
«
» (Man walking on street) and «
» (Moon 
goes through the sky). Similarly, to display the word «
» different gestures are used. To 
ensure the right choice of gesture, a new generalized grammatical structure of translation ought 
to be added. The above sentence corresponds to generalized grammatical structure of translation:

and then:

As the result, sentence «

for word «

Generation of the set of generalized grammar structures of translation
The availability of relationships mechanisms representation between grammatical structures 
of inflected and sign languages and the relations between words of inflected language and 
gestures allows to perform automated translation from inflected to sign language. The neces-
sary condition for design and application of automated translation system is bilingual corpus 
of sentences in inflectional and sign language. Completeness of the corpus affects the quality 
of proposed automated translation system.
To ensure sufficient completeness of bilingual corpus we use the program used in schools 
for children with hearing impairments. This program includes gestures and sentence them 
evenly cover all the topics of daily (household) of signed communication. The program accu-
mulates the knowledge of different subjects to study sign language at the same level at which 
native verbal language is studied.
The crucial feature of the program clearly reveals its main tasks: mastery of the mother/
first language, forming the base for mastering a second language (verbal) and the study of 
two cultures: the deaf and hearing communities.

As a result of the development program, sign language students:
1. obtain the sign vocabulary of various subjects,
2. fill sign vocabulary by learning new concepts,
3. can reasonably express their views,
4. are able to build grammatically correct sentences.
The automated translation system using the corpus that provides a fairly complete gram-
mar and gestures reserve, necessary for everyday communication.
For generating the set of generalized grammatical structures the following technology, pre-
sented in the Fig. 3.13 is proposed:
1. a set of gestures is formed using program for learning sign language that covers common 
topics of everyday communication,
2. based on texts from the program the set of sentences in inflectional language are formed, 
which are used in the study of sign language,
3. on the basis of software, using signed language specialists’ assistance, bilingual corpus is 
formed: each sentence inflected language is associated with a sentence of sign language, 
words of inflectional language sentence are in matched with gestures in SL sentences and 
the order of words in inflected sentences and gestures gesture sentence is fixed,
4. based on the bilingual corpus a set of grammar sentences structures (3.8) containing a 
sequence of words and gestures is formed,
5. as a result of analysis of grammar sentences structures (3.8) a set of generalized grammar 
structures is formed (3.11) and correspondences between words and gestures are built (3.12).
3.2  ALGORITHMIC MODELS OF AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
OF TRANSLATION FROM INFLECTIONAL LANGUAGE TO SIGN LANGUAGE
To ensure feasibility of the proposed in the previous section approaches (models and charts 
for conversion of information), due to translation from inflected to sign language, the algo-
rithmic models are required for submission of:
1. dictionaries of inflected and sign languages,
2. correspondence between the grammatical structures of inflected and sign languages,
3. correspondence between gestures and words (as infological models),

4. algorithmic functionality for building information technology,
5. algorithmic functionality for use of information technology,
6. algorithmic functionality for extensibility of translation.
For algorithmic implementation dictionaries of inflected and sign languages, Relational 
Database Management System (RDMS) was chosen for correspondences between the gram-
matical structures of sign and inflected language, correspondences between words and gestures 
as infological model. Dictionaries of inflected and sign languages are presented as tables and 
relations between them. This allow to form words of inflected language as combination of 
basic word forms and inflections, as well as to determine inflectional parameters and part of 
speech of input word, to define parts of speech and emotional coloring by gesture designation.
Proposed infological models should apply algorithmic functionality for operation and sub-
sequent extensibility of information technology for translation of inflected to sign language.
The database structure for building of informational technology
To implement the proposed mechanisms of submission of dictionaries of inflected and sign lan-
guages, correspondence between words and gestures, correlations between grammatical struc-
tures of inflected and sign languages using RDMS was proposed. The dictionary of sign and 
inflected languages is shown as tables, containing sets of words, gestures and their options. The 
relations between the grammatical structures of sign and inflected languages are shown as tables, 
containing generalized grammatical structures of sentences inflected language, generalized 
grammatical structures of sentences inflected language and relationships between data tables.
Infological model of dictionaries of inflected and SL is presented as follows (Fig. 3.14).
The table “Dictionary of inflected language” contains a set of words in inflected language 
(W), sets of inflections (F) and basic word forms (I) – tables “Flexions” and “Basic word forms” 
respectively. The reference to grammatical categories which determine inflection is stored for each 
of the words: depending on the morphological features of speech data of grammatical categories 
can be number, gender, case, person, time, status, mode and other. The set of gestures is found in 
the table “Gesture dictionary”. The table contains reference to the word, which currently affects 
gesture and theme, in which the gesture is often used. Sets of basic word forms contain a refer-
ence to table “Parts of speech” to determine the words belonging to certain part of speech. To 
apply grammar structures (3.11) the following infological model is proposed (Fig. 3.15).

The structures of sentences are stored in the table “Sentences structure”, the structure of 
sentences of SL—in “SL structures”. These tables contain information about the type of topic 
sentences and sentences. “Elements of sentence structures” can contain both certain words 
(id of word) and a sequence of words (id of sequence). To preserve the order of elements of 
sentence structure each item has a serial number. “Elements of structures of SL sentences” may 
also contain sequences of gestures and gestures. To ensure the correspondences in translation 
serial number of inflectional sentence structure is also stored in SL sentence structure.
Through analysis, a set of generalized structures of inflected and sign languages contain-
ing only category of inflection, not certain words or sets of words. For each element of the 
structure of the sentence has been allocated a set of inflection category and the order of the 
element (according to the equation (3.11)).
Creating a generalized grammar structures allowed to get the structure of the SL sentence 
by analyzing the categories of inflection of words in a sentence and identificator (Id). Info-
logical model for generalized grammatical structures is shown in Fig. 3.16.
Table “Generalized structures” contains the generalized structures of sentences of inflected 
language. The main elements of this table is the inflectional category and serial number of 
the item in the structure of sentences. Table “Generalized SL structures” contains generalized 
constructions for SL. The main elements are part of speech and the number of the element 
in the structure. To use this infological model following algorithmic functionalities are pro-
posed: obtaining the id of generalized structure for sentence in inflected language, obtaining 
the id of generalized SL structure using the id of generalized structure.

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 69
Statistical database, presented in the Fig. 3.17. contains tables for translation, that allows to:
1. ensure faster processing sentences translated before,
2. study words for which sign matches were not found,
3. handle sentence, for which generalized grammatical structure of translation was not found,
4. study grammar translation, received automatically as prediction result.
Table “Sentences” contains sentences in inflectional language. The id of appropriate SL 
sentence, the id of used generalized grammar structure and translations count is stored into 
table if the sentence was translated before. If the translated sentence obtained poor results, it 
is indicated for the processing in the field “Poor translation”. The table “Generalized struc-
tures for processing” contains id’s of translate designs that require processing, depending on 
the type divided into grammatical structures:
1. derived from translation prediction,
2. that have no proper corresponding sentence construction in SL,
3. with poor translation result obtained.
Table “Words without appropriate gesture” contains id of sentences in which they are used, 
a number of words from the table “Dictionary of inflected language” that were used in the 
translation of sentences, and were not found in the table “Compliance of gestures to words”.
Functional models for building informational technology
To provide the desired functionality within the information technology it is necessary to offer 
the following algorithms:
1. construction of vocabulary of sign and inflected languages,
2. construction grammar structures of translation from inflected to sign language,
3. obtaining correspondences between words inflected gestures and sign language.
Models for building informational technology
To form the set W (words of inflectional language), the set of F (inflections) and the set of I 
(base word forms) we propose to implement the next approach (Fig. 3.6) using algorithm (3.15):

 add it to the set F (if such ending is not in set already)

(3.15)
To build the infological model of dictionaries of inflected and sign languages there is need 
to offer the following algorithmic functionality:
1. adding a basic word form, inflection and word,
2. obtaining basic word form, its inflection,
3. determine the inflectional parameters of word.
Adding basic word forms to the set of basic word forms (3.3) is as follows (3.16):
 
Input: basic word form and part of speech
Determine the [id of part of speech] from
table “Parts of speech”
Add [basic word form] and [id of part of speech] 
f
to table “Basic word forms”
 
(3.16)
The process of adding a base form, from to the set of word forms using IDEF0 methodol-
ogy is shown in Fig. 3.18.
Adding words and inflections to the corresponding sets is the done using following algo-
rithmic scheme (3.17):
 
Input : word of inflected language, basic word form, 
c
parameters of inflection
Define [id of inflectional parameters 1], 
[id of inflectional parameters 2], 
[id of inflectional parameters n], 
[id of bas
…
ic word form] by selection 
from tables “Inflectional parameters 1”,
“Inflectional pa-rameters 2”, “Inflectional parameters n”, 
“Basic word forms”
Define k = position of word, starting from
which it differs from basic word form
l = word length
flexion = RIGHT (word,l)
If flexion not empty
If exists [flexion] in table “Inflexions”
 define [id of flexion]
Else add flexion to table “Inflexions” and get its id
End if
d
Else define number of empty flexion from table “Inflexions”
End if
Add [id of basic word from], [id of flexion], 
[position of flexion], [ids of inflectional categories], 
to table “Inflectional language dicionary”
 
(3.17)
The process of adding words and inflections using IDEF0  methodology is shown 
in Fig. 3.19. The inflection position are defined when adding word its inflectional parameters, 

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 71
corresponding to basic word form. The id is determined in case the inflection already exists 
in the database, otherwise—it is added to the table.
Getting basic word forms, inflections, inflectional category is given by (3.18):
 
Input: word in inflected language
Define [id of base word form] for word from 
f
table “Inflectional language dictionary” and [base word form]
from table “Base word forms” using linked field
[id of base word form]
Define [id of inflexion] for word from
table “Inflectional language dictionary” and [inflexion]
from table “Inflexions” using linked field [id of flexion]
Define [id of inflectional category n] for word from
table “Inflectional language dictionary” and
[inflectional category] from “Inflectional categories n”
using linked field [id of inflectional category n]
 
(3.18)
To define parts of speech of input word, the next algorithmic sequence is suggested by (3.19):
 
Input : word in inflected language
Define [id of base word form] for word 
from table “Inflectional language dictionary”
For defined [id of base word form] get [id of part of speech] 
from table “Base word forms” and [part of speech] from 
d
table “Parts of speech” by linked field [id of part of speech]
 
(3.19)
To add a database gestures and their options, the following algorithm is proposed below:

Input: designation of gesture, SL part of speech, subject, 
emotional component
Define [id of emotion] from table “Emotions”,
[id of theme] from table “Themes”,
[id of part of speech] from table “SL parts of speech”
Add [gesture definition], [id of emotion], [id of theme]
and [id of part of speech] to table “Gestures dictionary”
 
(3.20)
Algorithms of obtaining options of gesture require selection of [id of emotion], [id of 
subject] and [id of part of speech] from the table “Gestures dictionary” using their id.
Construction of grammar structures of translation from inflected to sign language
Copy the template. To apply infological models of grammar translation the following algo-
rithmic functionality should be offered:
1. creating a sequence of words,
2. creating a sequence of gestures,
3. creating a sentence structure,
4. creating SL sentence structure,
5. obtaining id of sentence using sentence structure of inflectional language.
Creating a set of sequences of words, presented in (3.9), is algorithmically implemented as:
 
On the input is a sequence of words
Create a record in the table “Sequences of words”, 
which contains the first word of sequence and its serial number
Get [sequence id]
For each of the following words adding [sequence id], [word],
[number of word in sequence] to table “Sequences of words”
 
(3.21)
Creating a set sequence of gestures (3.10) is analogous operation the previous one. To cre-
ate the grammatical structure of the sentence next algorithmic sequence is given by (3.22):
 
The input to the algorithm is the sentence structure
consisting of words or 
sequences of words, type and subject of the sentence
Create a record in the table “Structure of sentences” 
that contains
[type of sentence] and [topic] get [id of sentence structure] 
for add-ed record
For each item sentence structure
If the item is the word 
     define [word number] from the table “Dictionary of 
     inflected language”
     Add the record to the table “Elements of sentence structures”,
     which includes [id of sentence structure], [id of word],
     [punctuation] [position of word in the structure]
End if
If the element is sequence of words
     search for it in the table “Sequences of words”
     If the sequence is found define [id of sequence]
     Else create a new sequence using algorithm described above
     and determine [id of sequence]
Add the record to the table “Elements of sentence structures”,
f
which includes [id of sentence structure], [id of sequence],
 [punctuation] [position of sequence in the structure]
End if
 
(3.22)

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 73
Creating a structure of SL sentences is similar to the creation of the structure of sentences 
of inflected language, except that in the table “Elements of the structure of signed clauses” 
contains [id of structure gesture sentence] and [id of structure of the sentence] to ensure con-
sistency between the elements of sentences of inflected and sign languages. After creating a 
structure of SL sentences, it is stored in corresponding sentence structure of inflected lan-
guage, in “Structure of sentences” table.
On the basis of the curriculum for children with hearing impairments, the set of sen-
tences in inflectional language was formed. The sentence is submitted as a sequences 
of words. Translation of this set of sentences is performed with experts on SL speech 
assistance. Each word of the sentence is linked to corresponding gesture. As a result of 
the translation of each sentence of the training set bilingual corpus of sentences was 
obtained.
For getting the id of inflectional language sentence the following algorithm (3.23) is proposed:
 
The input to the algorithm is the sentence in
inflectional language
For each word of sentence find id in the table
“Dictionary of inflect-ed language”
Form the sequence of indexed numbers [sentence]
Find the list sentence structures ids [list], for which in the 
table “Elements of the structure of sentences” this 
[sentence][1] is a sequence of words or in the field [word id]
and [position in the struc-ture] = 1
For all next words of sentences structures [list] look for those
that contain [sentence][i] in the sequence of 
words or in the field [word id]
and for which [position in the structure] = i
If this structure is found - return its nu
f
mber
 
(3.23)
Based on bilingual corpus the set of grammar constructions of translation was formed, 
using the algorithm (3.24):
 
For each s
h entence [sentence1] from bilingual c
l orpus
Search ffor
f
grammar structure [structure], 
where all elements except one are the same as in
e
structure of [sentence1]
If str

 which are different
 
Else
Search for [sentence2], in which all elementst except one
are the same as in [sentence1]
If [sentence2

 found create new grammar construction
 [structure] bases d on [sentence1] and [sentence2], 
which contains parts oof s
o
entences
that are the same, and sequence of words that are different
t
for [sentence1] and [sentence2]
End if
End ifi
 
(3.24)
After receiving the set grammar structures with help of a specialist in signed language the 
analysis and corrections were conducted. Incorrect grammar constructions were labeled and 
stored in a separate set. Regarding to irregular translation structures, the constructions algo-
rithm (3.24) is repeated, until the set stop increasing.

74 Recent advances in information technology
To create a generalized grammar structure of translation (3.26) the following algorithmic 
functionality (3.25) is offered:
 
For each [struct] from table “Sentences structures”
For each sequence of words in [struct] define inflectional
parameters which are the same for all elements 
Search for grammar sentence structure in table 
“Generalized grammar structures”, which contains defined 
inflectional parameters
If such structure doesn’t exist, add new structure [GenStruct] to 
table “Generalized grammar structures”
End if
For [struct] search for corresponding [gesturestruct] from 
table “Structures of SL sentences”
Define parameters of gestures which are the same for all elements
of [gesturestruct] and define generalised SL structure
If defined [gesturestruct] already exists, add its id to [GenStruct]
Else add [gesturestruct] to table “Generalized SL structures”
and a reference to its id to [GenStruct]
End if
 
(3.25)
Getting correspondences between words of inflected language and gestures of sign language
In addition to determining the sentence structure it is necessary for translation to have cor-
respondence between words and matching gestures. Using the correspondence between the 
structures of sentences and structures of SL the set of correspondences “word → gesture” was 
formed. Table “Word to gesture” contains the ids of words and ids of corresponding gestures.
To get the matching “word → gesture” for each of the sentences in the table “Structures 
of sentences” and matching SL structure from table “Structures of SL sentences” corre-
spondence between word sequences and sequences of gestures were obtained. Using data 
according to the table “Sequences of words” and “Sequences of gestures” was formed table 
“Word to gesture”. In case of non-unique correspondence of “word → gesture” this info-
logical model does not allow to define a clear relationship between the set of words and a set 
of gestures. If one word corresponds to several gestures for selecting the correct gesture the 
relationship between the sentences’ structures and SL structures is used. If the few words are 
corresponding to one gesture difficulties in obtaining compliance “word → gesture” does 
not arise. In addition, for such gestures we can get a list of synonyms. To fill the table “Word 
to gesture” the following algorithm was used (3.26).
 
Sentences structures” define
the corresponding structure of the “Structures of SL sentences”
Each sequence of words in the sentence structure is matched 
to corresponding sequence of gestures
For each word determine its sequence id and 
gesture id from corresponding sequence 
Add id of word and id of gesture to the table “Word to gesture”
 
(3.26)
Functional model of informational technology usage
The following algorithmic functionality should be offered, to work with dictionaries infologi-
cal model:
Helping Children Face Tough Issues 

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 75
− defining basic word forms of word,
− defining inflection for word,
− defining part of speech,
− defining parameters of gesture,
− defining inflectional parameters of word.
Algorithms to implement this functionality (3.18)–(3.20) were developed during the con-
struction of dictionaries.
To work with infological model of generalized grammar structures of translation we should 
offer the following algorithmic functionality:
− defining the id of generalized grammatical structure for sentence in inflectional 
language;
− editing of existing generalized grammatical structures;
− obtaining generalized grammatical structure of translation by its id;
− identification of generalized grammatical SL structure of sentence using id of generalized 
sentence construction of inflectional language.
The following algorithmic functionality (3.27) is proposed to determine the id of general-
ized grammatical structure of input sentence:
 
For each word of sentence determine its inflection parameters
Choose from the table “Generalized structure” generalized grammatical
constructions of sentences in which the number of elements is equal
to the words count of a sentence (the maximum [number of elements]
for structure = number of words in a sentence) and generalized
grammatical construction elements include parameters
corresponding to inflections of word in sentence
 (3.27)
Determining the id of generalized SL grammatical structure, is done by selecting [number 
of generalized sign design] from the table “Generalized structures”, using the id of general-
ized construction of inflectional language.
To search for phrases in a sentence the algorithm (3.28) is proposed:
 
Input: sentences in inflected language
Create element of class CSentence sentence based on input 
sentence
Using method sentence.LoadSentence() the input sentence 
is transformed
 to indexed sequence of class CWord words
CWord list[]= null;
k = count of words sentence.words, i = 0, j= 0
Repeat until i < k-1
    If sentence. words[i].fullword +‘’+sentence. words [i+1].fullword 
exists in table “Phrases”
     list[j] = CWord(sentence. words[i].fullword +‘’+
 sentence. words[i +1].fullword)
i = i + 2
j = j+1
Else i = i +1
End cycle
Resulting list contains indexed sequence of words 
and phrases: sentences. words = list
 
(3.28)

76 Recent advances in information technology
To form the gesture sentences based on sentence of inflectional language proposed the 
following algorithm (3.29):
 
For each element of sentence Sentence.words define corresponding
o

gestures ids
Create element of class CGestureSentence Gs
n
entence
Use Sentence.Structure.ElementsCorrespond to define
the order of gestures in SL sentence based on gesture
g
positions and form Gsentence.Gestures
 
(3.29)
The algorithm of information technology for automated translation consists of the follow-
ing steps (compare to Fig. 3.3):
1. Input sentences are verified for existence of phrases.
2. Using dictionary of Ukrainian language, parameters inflection, part of speech, basic 
word form, inflection, and number in the database table are defined for each of words and 
phrases from the table “Dictionary of Ukrainian language”.
3. Based on inflection parameters the generalized grammatical construction is determined (3.30):
 
Input: CSentence sentence
Using method GetSentenceStructure(), in the table
“Generalized struc-ture” search for generalized 
sentence structure that corresponds to the input parameters:
the number of elements = number of elements of the sentence, 
the first structure element contains inflection category,
f
the relevant to categories of inflection of sentence. words [1],
the second category includes element of inflection 
of sentence. words [2], for each word of sentence
 
(3.30)
4. If generalized grammatical construction if not found the search of partially correspond-
ing constructions is performed (3.31):
 
Input: CSentence sentence
Using method GetPartialMatch(), in table “Generalised structures”
search for structure that partially matches sentence
on the input pa-rameters: 
i = 0
Repeat, until i < sentence. words.count
Search for generalized structure for
which elements count = sentence elements count,
all elements of structure except sentence. words [i] correspond 
to the input sentence
 
(3.31)
5. If generalized grammatical construction of input sentence is found, corresponding gener-
alized grammatical construction of SL sentence is determined.
6. Using “word → gesture” define gestures corresponding to input words.
7. If we find a generalized sentence structure of inflected language, the corresponding gener-
alized SL structure and all compliance “word → gesture”, then the resulting sign language 
translation is displayed.
8. In case of partially corresponding grammatical construction an attempt to predict transla-
tion is made. Generalized structure of sentence which overlaps with the input partially is 
used. Based on that structure using “word → gesture” the SL sentence is built. The result-

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 77
ing structure is added to the database as inactive and labeled in the table “Generalized 
structures to handle”.
9. If no partially corresponding grammatical construction is found the sentence is marked 
for further processing by authorized sign language expert. The sentence is added to the 
table “Sentences” without the specified number of generalized structure. If for some of 
the words of a sentence appropriate gesture is not found, the word is denoted to statistical 
base table “Words without appropriate gesture” for further processing.
After receiving the translation user chooses one of the following:
1. The translation is satisfactory. The sentences are marked as correct and is added to the 
statistical base. The id of sentence, id of SL sentence and construction id are stored in the 
statistical database table “Sentences”.
2. The translation is unsatisfactory. The id of sentence, id of structure used for translation 
(if received) are stored in statistical database table “Sentence” and are set to “Poor transla-
tion” for further processing.
3. If the structure is not found, matching “word → gesture” not found, or the result of 
translation is not satisfactory—authorized translator can add a new translation design or 
change already existing, a match for “word → gesture” or a new gesture.
4. The information about the system is formed based on the statistical database.
Authorized persons are able to:
1. get statistics on the frequency of use of generalized grammar structures,
2. view a list of sentences that were often translated in the system,
3. view a list of sentences which indicated poor quality of translation;
4. view a list of sentences for which during translation no generalized grammatical structure 
of translation was found;
5. view a list of generalized transfer structures requiring updates;
6. add new generalized structures of translation or edit existing ones.
The required number of structures is selected from the tables “Frequency of translation” 
and “Generalized structures” on a bound field [id of generalized structure] sorting by the 
field [number of uses] for getting the frequency of usage of grammar structures.
Information about the sentences that were translated in the system is stored in the database 
table “Sentences”. Field [Translations count] has the amount of translations for sentence. 
[id of generalized construction] is set on first translation and can be used, if the sentence 
is re-translated to ensure greater speed of system. [Unsatisfactory translation] is set if user 
submitted result as poor translation. If the sentence that was translated has no [id of general-
ized structure] set, then this sentence needs a check. Authorized persons are able to obtain 
lists of sentences that require identification, design or adjustment of generalized translation 
correction.
3.3  EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF INFORMATIONAL TECHNOLOGY 
OF TRANSLATION FROM UKRAINIAN TO SIGN LANGUAGE
Implementation of the proposed information technology for automated translation of inflected 
languages to sign language was considered on example of Ukrainian. To test proposed in the 
previous sections approaches, algorithms, models and charts, to obtain the translation system 
from Ukrainian to sign language experimental applications were implemented for:
1. construction of Ukrainian and sign language dictionaries,
2. forming the set of correspondences between Ukrainian and grammar of sign language,
3. testing of the effectiveness of translation.

78 Recent advances in information technology
Building the dictionaries of Ukrainian and sign languages
To achieve the translation Ukrainian and SL, according to infological model (Fig.  3.14) 
dictionaries were developed. The basis of Ukrainian dictionary was electronic dictionary 
“
 on-line” (Dictionaries of Ukraine on-line). To form the vocabulary of 
gestures of Ukrainian sign language, the complex program “Ukrainian sign language” was 
used to master sign language (Program Complex). The database was filled using developed 
software application.
The input of application had the set of words in Ukrainian with the right inflection 
parameters obtained from the dictionary “Dictionaries of Ukraine on-line” (Dictionaries 
of Ukraine on-line). Each word was applied in pair with its basic word form. Using opera-
tor (3.7) the input word was divided into a combination of quasi base and quasi flexion and 
using algorithms 3.15–3.17 were added to the database.
Based on the educational program of the “Ukrainian Sign Language” used in schools for 
the people with impaired hearing to master sign language sets of SL sentences and gestures 
were formed. Each gesture had its designation assigned. Gestures were grouped according 
to the topics of the curriculum in which they are used. The given set of gestures and their 
options have been added to the database.
As a result of the work on filling database the following numbers were obtained:
1. base word forms – 140440,
2. Ukrainian words in all word forms – 1971342,
3. structural word endings of words – 2067,
4. gestures of SL – 3155.
Bilingual corpus of sentences building
Bilingual sentence corpus is necessary to form the set of correspondences between both 
grammar Ukrainian and sign language. To ensure the efficiency of obtained grammar 
structures the sentences that are used in different situations, with different grammatical 
structure and covering most of the vocabulary and grammar structures for everyday com-
munication ought to be contained.
The set of sentences in Ukrainian were formed that are used in the study of SL using SL 
study program for specialized schools. All of this sentences were decomposed into simple 
sentences. The sentences were grouped according to the topics of the curriculum.
The set of correspondences between words and gestures was formed based on the bilingual 
sentences corpus of Ukrainian and sign languages. Using the developed software based on 
the algorithm 3.25 the set of words and gestures that correspond to them was formed. For 
each word, which is found in sentences of bilingual corpus, the set of all word forms was 
allocated and gesture compliance was set.
Bilingual corpus contains 9800simple sentences with appropriate vocabulary, having a 
appropriate stock, which covered the situation on the possible speech topics studied in the 
program of study Ukrainian sign language specialized schools. Number of correspondences 
between Ukrainian words and gestures was 35298 records. Number of correspondences 
between the basic word form and gestures equals 2754 records
Corpus for generation of generalized grammar structures of translation
After receiving bilingual corpus of sentences, obtained correspondences between sentences in 
Ukrainian and SL ought to be summarized. For this purpose, inflectional parameters (number, 
gender, part of language and a generalized category that includes case, identity, time, status, 
mode) were proposed. The first stage was the formation of grammar structures, based on sets 
of words. In the second phase, achieved sets were summarized by the relevant parameters of 
inflection as well as generalized grammar structures of translation were formed.

Information technology for automated translation from inflected languages 79
Then, the set of grammar structures of translation was formed, using the developed soft-
ware (based on algorithms 3.22–3.24). Partly grammar structures were formed by combining 
the sentences into grammar structures.
There were received 2101 grammar translations, from which 293 derived generalized gram-
mar structures of translation. This allowed the automated translation of sentences from 
corpus.
The automated translation efficiency verification
One of the crucial thing was to test the effectiveness of the developed solution. To elaborate 
this the set of simple sentences in Ukrainian was used. There was condition, that these sam-
ples ought to be used in everyday communication between people with hearing impairments 
on one hand, but they should not belong to the previous study of the proposed solution—on 
the other hand.
The set of simple sentences in Ukrainian was formed, derived from electronic publishing 
for the deaf. To test the effectiveness of the translation software was developed. On output 
the software formed a set of SL sentences grouped by the following criteria:
1. successful automatic translation,
2. automated translation based on generalized grammar structure partially matching the 
input sentence,
3. sentences for which translation could not be predicted,
4. sentences for which not all words were translated to gestures.
The set of sentences in Ukrainian and SL derived from the translation was submitted for 
validation by specialists of SL.
When conducting test translation on set of Ukrainian sentences taken from bilingual edu-
cational corpus 100% automatic translation was obtained. There were 500 simple sentences 
selected from chosen publication to conduct practical test of the technology. As a result 
of translation 321 (64%) sentences were translated automatically, while 119 (24%) were not 
translated due to the lack of word to gesture matches. Precisely 60 (12%) were not translated 
because of the lack of generalized grammatical structures (for 33 (55%) of these sentences 
generalized grammatical structures that overlap with the input sentence were proposed). The 
test results are presented in the Fig. 3.20:
As a result of the expansion of vocabulary and establishing correspondences between 
words and gestures we received results of 423 (85%) sentences translated automatically and 
31 sentences (6%) with automated translation. The total percentage of successful translation 
was 91%. The test results shown in Fig. 3.21:

Web-service implementation
Further development of this solution implies its use on different platforms as a service. Designed 
Web-service API provide access to the following features of automated translation system:
1. function to perform translation,
2. features for editing and expanding the existing system,
3. function to get statistical information about the system,
4. function of system administrator.
Functions of translation give the ability to use the translation algorithm or only receive 
information about the grammatical structure of sentences and correspondence between words 
and gestures to allow using own translation algorithms. The main interface maintains:
1. Obtaining SL sentence by the input sentence in Ukrainian. This interface reads a sim-
ple sentence in Ukrainian and using described above (see Fig. 3.3) translation algorithm 
returns SL sentence.
2. Receiving inflectional parameters of words for input sentence. This interface receives 
input word in Ukrainian and returns its inflectional parameters.
3. Getting generalized grammatical structure corresponding to the sentence. This interface 
reads a sentence in Ukrainian, returns generalized grammar structures of Ukrainian and 
sign language sentences.
4. Getting word-gesture match for words of input sentence. This interface receives input 
word in Ukrainian and returns the corresponding gesture.
To ensure functionality, designed for authorized persons engaged in editing and expansion 
of the existing system has the following interfaces.
1. Adding new words. The input interface receives Ukrainian language word, its basic word 
forms and categories of inflection.
2. Adding new gestures. The input interface receives gesture description and its characteristics.
3. Adding generalized structures of translation. The input interface receives generalized 
grammatical structure in Ukrainian language and the corresponding design of sign 
language.
4. Editing generalized structures of translation. The input interface receives generalized 
grammatical structure of translation and its number.

5. Creating a word-gesture match. The input interface receives the Ukrainian word and the 
corresponding gesture.
6. Display of a list of generalized transfer structures derived from translation prediction. 
The interface returns a list of generalized grammar and translation and their ids.
7. Displays a list of generalized designs of translation data over time. The interface returns 
a list of generalized grammatical structures according to the set time interval.
8. Displays a list of sentences for which a “poor translation” is selected. The interface returns a 
list of sentences, grammatical constructions that were used for these sentences and their ids.
Functions for statistical information on the database include the following interfaces:
1. Display of information about the usage of grammatical constructions. The input inter-
face receives the number grammatical structure and parameters that indicate the type of 
information required. On the output, depending on the specified parameters, we obtain 
the number of uses of grammatical structure, a list of proposals for which was used this 
design, the number of uses of this design in predicting the transfer, the number of poor 
translations using this design.
2. Display of a list of grammatical structures that often or less often used. The input is the 
number of designs to display and sorting options. The output interface gets a list of struc-
tures, the count of translations and their ids.
3. Display of a list of sentences that often or less often used.
4. Display of the usage of translation system for a certain period of time.
For the realization of the administrator of the system developed following interfaces:
1. Adding or removing users.
2. Setting or removing permissions for groups of users.
3. Viewing recent events for particular user.
3.4 CONCLUSION
This section discusses the inflected language to sign language translation solution. It con-
stitutes an important element for the new systems for the training and communication with 
deaf people.
The model of inflected and sign languages dictionaries representation was improved. It sig-
nificantly reduces the amount of memory required to store dictionaries. Unlike the existing 
approaches, the words of the language are stored in the database as a combination of appropriate 
indexed sets of basic word forms and inflections, by which the word is automatically generated.
The elaborated mechanism for representation of relations between words of inflected lan-
guage and gestures of sign language is quite innovative. It allows to align the Ukrainian 
words with corresponding gestures. The advantages of this representation are both the ease 
of creating, editing words—gestures relationships between and the possibility to form these 
relationships using text corpus.
For the first time the mechanism of generalized grammar translation structures for 
inflected and sign languages was developed, allowing to define the grammatical structure of 
the input sentence and an appropriate structure of gesture sentence for translation.
In reference to popular existing approaches, presented solution uses inflectional param-
eters of the words of input sentence to determine its grammatical structure.
The developed ability to continuously expand and improve the quality of translation 
stands innovative approach in such automated translation area. The advantages of this tech-
nology include: relative simplicity (for a translation system based on rules) of its expansion 
and enhancement of quality of translation as a result of self-learning.

82 Recent advances in information technology
The information technology for nonverbal communication of deaf people was further 
developed by inclusion of automated translation functionality, allowing to empower its 
practical applications. The advantages of this expansion include ability to create interactive 
inflected language translators to sign gestures with speech playback using three-dimensional 
actors as realistic animation.
Experimental software was implemented to build and Ukrainian and sign language dic-
tionaries, to build a set of correspondences between Ukrainian and sign language grammar, 
to test the effectiveness of translation. The last stage considered web service that implemented 
the functionality of automated translation based on the proposed information technology.

INTRODUCTION
The Health Information and Management System Society define interoperability in health-
care as: “(…) the ability of different information technology systems and software applica-
tions to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged. 
Data exchange schema and standards should permit data to be shared across clinicians, lab, 
hospital, pharmacy, and patient (…)” (HIMSS 2013). Information exchange is a key factor 
towards the faithful execution of medical workflows. However, the diversity of clinical data 
turns the information exchange process into a challenging issue of integration. This lack 
can lead to inefficient medical treatment and can raise healthcare costs. Interoperability is 
achieved in part by the use of consistent standards that define the syntactic and semantic 
meaning of information. Implementation of standards can reduce the costs and timelines 
of health technology development projects. There exist a variety of standards for health-
care information exchange today. Health Level 7 (HL7) standards (http://www.hl7.org) are a 
popular choice for both local communities and regional eHealth initiatives. The mission of 
HL7 is to provide standards for the exchange, management and integration of data that sup-
port clinical patient care and the management, delivery and evaluation of healthcare services. 
There is still no unique technical standard covering all aspects of health data communication. 
Nevertheless, HL7 International organisation has released a series of standards which are the 
most widely used by the current healthcare systems, and has defined guidelines that target on 
integration of healthcare components, from medical devices to management systems.
Health Information System (HIS) is in broader sense any system used for collecting, stor-
ing and retrieving data on activities and phenomena relating to the health care sector. This 
system can be based on the Information Technology and Communications (ICT) infrastruc-
ture. Generally the goal of an HIS is to contribute to better efficiency and quality of provi-
sion of health care by providing reliable and relevant information on treatment of patients, 
for management of the health care sector at all levels and efficient allocation of financial and 
human resources.
An HIS is mostly designed for Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information resource 
formation. EHR include Basic Patient Information; patient administration (Admission 
Note; Transfer; Discharge Summary; Episode Note); Pharmacy order & Prescription; Medi-
cal Record; Imaging Report; Lab Test; Referral Letter & Referral Summary; Payment Sheet. 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of an EHR management system should support 
the standard protocol for information exchange between laboratory, radiological, telemetry, 

84 Recent advances in information technology
pharmaceutical and health care insurance systems for semantic interoperability of healthcare 
domains (Krivonos and Khorozov 2014).
The transport protocol is using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) representation of 
the message structures and domain-specific vocabularies (e.g. HL7). The problem of com-
patibility of medical, administrative and statistical information is related to integration of 
different types of data in accordance with an HIS model and the structure of Clinical Docu-
ment Architecture (CDA). Integration of healthcare applications cannot be achieved without 
standardising the exchange of information. In this context, the focus is on communication 
standard HL7 XML for data exchange.
The requirements for standardisation are focused on the functionality of the software that 
use a common data model, structured messages and the capability of importing XML-files to 
the database (DB) of a medical reports management system. Relational technology of XML 
data storage is associated with two types of files, “data-centric” and “document-oriented”. 
In the former case it applies parsing and relational presentation data for subsequent analysis. 
In the latter case, XML-files are loaded into the database as character entities (Khorozov 
2014) or a hybrid EHR database model is used for the storage of XML-sections of the com-
plex CDA together with the relational representation of the document context. In this case 
we are dealing with API implementation and EHR database formation.
Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an interoperability standard developed 
for the exchange, integration, sharing and retrieval of electronic health information to provide 
a framework and related standards known as HL7 International. Today in HISs, the com-
mon standard is Consolidated CDA, which is designed to transfer entire documents, rather 
than a simple list. This means that when a physician requests information about a patient, the 
system needs to transfer multiple documents to fulfil the request. FHIR, on the other hand, 
makes it simple to receive a specific piece of requested information. This approach is much 
more efficient for systems exchanging specific information, rather than entire documents. 
A major technology change embodied in FHIR is a move away from a document-centric 
approach to a data-level access approach using well-defined APIs.
The article deals with APIs of heterogeneous applications in healthcare based on an 
FHIR server for management information resources, parsing HL7 XML-format messages 
and patient Electronic Medical Record (EMR) formation. A database model is proposed 
which uses a combination of XML-storage sections of EMR together with a relational 
representation of the document context. For the class of XML-files, which contain struc-
tured parts and sections with complex elements, data access is achieved through the use 
of XML Schema, XML indexing and XPath query. We consider the actual application 
for a patient’s vital signs telemonitoring system framework and Patient Medical Records 
(PMR) formation.
The main objective is to achieve interoperability between e-Health organisations for easier 
access to healthcare information. The proposed approach addresses integration of a wide 
range of heterogeneous data sources and a decision-making support process through OLAP 
(OnLine Analytical Processing) and data-mining facilities. It builds a suitable solution for inte-
gration of high volumes of healthcare data. This approach is a step towards decentralisation 
and strengthening of interoperability in the healthcare sector, which results in a better service 
for the patient and medical staff. The goals aimed for are interoperability and data access.
4.1 STRATEGY FOR HIS DEVELOPMENT
The HIS for the health sector should not be built as one monolithic information system. 
The result would be definitely very vulnerable to any changes in the sector and, with poorly 
defined interfaces, hampering future development of the system. We rather advocate for a 
system with clearly defined distinct components co-operating and exchanging data through 
defined and well documented data interfaces that are developed. General requirements for 

Interoperability of the health care information resources 85
designing information flows (medical, administrative, financial and statistical) in the health-
care industry are related to system functional class.
The requirements apply to the following key functional classes:
1. Reference Information Resources for information support of medical facilities and 
management.
2. HIS intended for information support of processes of diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation 
and prevention of patients.
3. Statistical Information System (SIS) for health management.
A long-term HIS strategy is necessary to achieve objectives such as:
1. developing and managing HIS components inside the health sector;
2. a set of standards for development of HIS components;
3. a set of standards for data exchange between HIS components (formats and protocols) 
and maintaining the definitions of these standards;
4. a common or distributed approach to technological platforms;
5. responsibility for collection of specific data items and basic data flows between distinct insti-
tutions to prevent duplications and ensure completeness and consistency of collected data;
6. a procedure for maintenance of a global HIS strategy.
The ICT infrastructure and the corresponding application software can optimise expen-
ditures only through adherence to the explicitly formulated HIS strategy in the health care 
sector.
The development of the HIS should adhere as much as possible to the standards. These 
standards could be classified as technological standards, communication standards or cod-
ing/classification standards.
The technological standards specify hardware, software and database platforms for imple-
mentation of an HIS. These standards will be broadly accepted international formal or “de 
facto” standards. However, a choice of available options may be selected for financial reasons 
to harness advantages of open licenses that can be negotiated with major vendors for the 
health care sector.
The communication standards for the health care domain should definitely be used for data 
exchange between different institutions acting in the health care sector. These standards can 
be advantageously utilised as a foundation for internal communication within an institution. 
The following standards of this class can be recommended: a) HL7 XML protocol; b) CEN 
standards for electronic prescriptions; c) ISO PKI technical specification; d) ISO standard 
on health cards.
The classification standards enable unique identification of different phenomena, qualities 
and objects within the health care domain. The following coding/classification standards 
may be used: a) International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); b) Coding Atlas for Phar-
maceutical Substances (CAPS); c) Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG); d) Medical Service 
Classification.
4.1.1 Interoperability standards in healthcare
The HIS at the level of a health care facility generally provides the following functionali-
ties: registration of patients; management of contacts and referrals; reporting; claiming and 
invoicing; financial accounting and book-keeping. These functionalities are provided by ITC 
support as well as standards and APIs in order to achieve integration of applications, and 
to inter-operate with other healthcare providers. In order to effectively respond to the inter-
operability needs, a care unit should set out an Integration Roadmap, showing how it will 
use open APIs and standards to migrate towards the Integrated Digital Health Care Record.
Interoperability of the HIS is classified into three categories: Syntactic; Semantic; Device. 
Syntactic interoperability is provided by using standard data models (RIM) for communication 

86 Recent advances in information technology
among healthcare systems. Syntax is a grammar to convey semantic structure. Semantic 
interoperability is provided by using terminology standards such as SNOMED, LOINC, 
ICD-10 for understanding clinical terms. Device interoperability is provided by using speci-
fications for medical devices and links observations with terminology. Integration standards 
from HL7 can form a key part:
1. HL7 Version 2 is a standard use most appropriate for message based interactions (order-
ing, prescribing and database synchronisation).
2. HL7 Version 3 is a standard most appropriate with sophisticated structures for complex 
interactions and EHRs, and better suited to national level with data interactions.
3. CDA is the electronic format for healthcare and planned clinical documents.
4. FHIR is an open standard API for medical applications. FHIR offers an easy way to get 
systems connected using off the shelf web standards. Right now, it would make a great 
basis for a newly constructed interface for mobile systems. FHIR is designed to encom-
pass the capabilities of all of the other standards.
A fully integrated patient record system across all the HIS is in order, where the mean-
ing ‘integrated’ is that vital patient information and clinical decisions can be viewed by an 
authorised user in any single instance. The objective is integration of information from dif-
ferent ITC systems. The HL7 produces an electronic system to messaging standards as well 
as such standards as electronic document structure and content standards to support systems 
interoperability (Clinical Data Standards in Health Care: Five Case Studies, 2005). Those 
categories of standards are presented in Appendix A.
4.1.2 Taxonomy of HIS components
The components of the HIS can be classified in the following way:
Clinical component is used for support medical personnel’s operations and duties. It is 
usually built as a patient centric component to store and retrieve data on patients and the 
history of their treatments. It provides a health record for each individual that shows every 
health-related event. The health record should show all significant events for the patient 
(made the diagnosis, performed the procedure, determined the outcome of a treatment). The 
subcomponent of the clinical component can be PACS (Picture archving and communication 
system) that enables recording and retrieval of image data on patients or telemonitoring the 
vital signs of a patient.
Surveillance (monitoring) component collects observations about the health status of a 
population. Surveillance component is used to track epidemics and reportable diseases like 
TB or HIV/AIDS. Such components are often used with socio-economic and demographic 
statistics to make projections and comparisons.
Managerial component is used to manage resources for a facility, district or region. It 
presents demographic statistics, service delivery statistics, and financial records and produces 
reports showing information such as utilisation, revenue, expenditure, efficiency and acces-
sibility. Clinical, surveillance and financial components provide input data for the managerial 
component.
Financial component gathers data necessary for claiming and accounting for the rendered 
health care. The clinical component may provide data for the financial component.
4.2 THE FHIR SPECIFICATION CONCEPT
FHIR is considered to be an emerging HL7 standard that takes advantage of the positive ele-
ments of its ancestors HL7 v2 and HL7 v3. The basic building block of FHIR is “Resource”, 
meaning a basic set of structured data. A resource is an entity, instance of data, which is 
either stored or exchanged. For example, a resource could be defined as a medication list, 

Interoperability of the health care information resources 87
a problem list or lab results. In today’s system, standard coding sets such as LOINC for lab 
results, or RxNorm for medications, allow software applications to exchange just the data 
that is needed and present it to clinicians or consumers.
In FHIR specification the data are not sufficiently “tied down” to semantic consistency. 
To achieve consistency in syntax and semantics a set of FHIR adoption profiles is needed. 
Such profiles have general incorporating Meaningful Use vocabularies such as SNOMED 
CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, resource definition specific profiles for concepts like “quantita-
tive lab results,” “vital signs” and “medication allergies”.
4.2.1 Contents of the resource
Every resource has an identified version and a known identity, a URL which can be used to 
address the resource. Resources contain a human readable Hypertext Mark-up Language 
(HTML) representation of the content, a set of data structured and represented in XML or 
JSON format. Resources have the following optional or mandatory elements and properties: 
a base set of defined data elements specific to the Extensions type; a human-readable narra-
tive description of the contents of the resource; metadata—information about the resource; 
tags—labels affixed to the resources which can be used to define additional operational 
behaviour such as workflow, security, etc.
4.2.2 Implementing FHIR resource profiles
Problems statement
1. FHIR profiles are generalised—multiple implementation options will not be interoperable.
2. Interoperability relies on criteria, e.g. singular invariant XPath per concept.
3. Some resources are undefined as to how they are constructed in detail (e.g. Blood Pressure).
4. Can existing metadata standards such as XML be used to define the profile to the right detail?
5. Can existing mature tooling be used to implement FHIR validation?
6. Can we integrate the terminology?
Interoperability Criteria
1. Payload defined and controlled by computational metadata (not documents).
2. A concept must have a singular invariant XPath—defined at different levels.
3. Values must be of the same dimension (units).
4. Codes for a concept must be from the same Value Set.
5. Detailed XML schemas need to be shared between interoperable exchange partners.
Remark: The Blood Pressure component instances (systolic and diastolic) can be expressed 
in different ways according to the XML schema.
4.2.3 Conformance in FHIR
The conformance in an FHIR specifies the resource type interactions that are supported 
by the FHIR Server for a specific resource. The FHIR API defines the resources as a set of 
operations also known as interactions on the resources, where individual resources are man-
aged by their type. The FHIR server must always define conformance for the resources by 
specifying the list of possible operations.
The following are the list of operations at various levels of the interaction:
Instance Level Interactions
Read – specifies the current state of the resource;
Update – updates an existing resource by its ID;
Delete – deletes the resource;
History – retrieves the update history of a particular resource.

88 Recent advances in information technology
Type Level Interactions
Create – creates a new resource with a server assigned ID;
Search – searches the resource type based on some filter criteria;
Validate – checks whether the content would be acceptable as an update;
History – retrieves the update history for a particular resource type.
Whole System Interactions
Conformance gets a conformance statement for the system;
Transaction – updates, creates or deletes a set of resources;
Search – searches across all resource types based on some filter criteria;
History – retrieves the update history for all resources.
In addition to the above-listed basic operations, there are Document endpoints to specify 
conformance for a specific resource.
4.2.4 Resources for medical documents
FHIR resources can be used to build documents that represent a composition: a set of coher-
ent information that is a statement of healthcare information, particularly including clinical 
observations and services. A document is a set of resources with a fixed presentation that is 
attested by humans, location and devices. Documents may be exchanged between systems 
and also persist in DB storage and management systems. Applications claiming conformance 
to this framework claim to be conformant to “FHIR documents”. FHIR documents may be 
PMR (focused on patient healthcare information). HL7 will develop profiles in the future 
giving additional guidance on appropriate representation of clinical documents (Consoli-
dated CDA). Note that FHIR defines both document format and a reference resource. An 
example of resources for CDA mapping are represented in Table 4.1.

Interoperability of the health care information resources 89
The composition of the resources establishes the document contents (type, date, author, 
references to the patient) and contains the section hierarchy with resources that make up the 
structure of the document. FHIR currently fills a new niche using Representational State 
Transfer (REST) to support Web and Mobile Applications and also has the potential to 
replace CDA. FHIR documents cover the same functionality as CDA: resources (comparable 
to sections in CDA) contain both text and software processable data. A FHIR document is a 
composition of section-level resources.
4.2.5 REST service
FHIR is based on REST, an approach to systems architecture. REST provides a set of architec-
tural constraints that emphasises scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, 
and independent deployment of components to reduce interaction latency and encapsulate 
legacy systems (Fielding 2000). REST is an Architectural style that describes a specific set of 
web-services that uses a connection-oriented and stateless protocol. In particular, it describes 
the interaction constraints for distributed systems and is suitable for telemetry devices.
The mobile applications aim at effective management of patients’ electronic personal 
health records via an easy to use interface which can be accessed by multiple actors, namely 
the patient, the doctor and the pharmacist. FHIR has the implementation benefits to inte-
grate the mobile client and the application’s server side and also provide insights into the 
access control mechanisms that should govern such applications. FHIR offers tools for devel-
opers to assemble and present smaller data elements to enhance the context or meaning of 
the information. An application might be created to remind patients to take certain medica-
tions at the right time, for instance. The open Internet standards utilised by FHIR will make 
a personal health care “account” work much like any other secure application.
RESTful interfaces are identified by the following features:
1. integration is achieved by using well-known HTTP methods;
2. no session information is kept on the server side (stateless system);
3. each resource is mapped to a directory-structure Uniform Resource Identifier (URI);
4. when transferring a resource representation, the data format is either XML or JSON 
based.
RESTful interfaces are more lightweight by design, comparing to Subjective, Objective, 
Assessment or Plan technologies (Mulligan and Gracanin 2009) and that is a reason to adopt 
them in mobile healthcare applications where processing capabilities are limited. RESTful 
services provide a methodology to create e-Health Application Layer using software archi-
tectural styles for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. All REST constraints must apply to 
a server based on Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) (Richardson and Ruby 2007). The 
system should be secured using basic authentication and offer XML and HTML responses. 
IoT technology platforms can demonstrate light-weight applications developed using a pre-
dictable architecture, consistent API specifications and FHIR.
4.3 INTEGRATING THE HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISE
An HIS at the level of a health care facility provides the following functionalities: registration 
of patients; management of contacts and referrals; reporting; claiming and invoicing; finan-
cial accounting and book-keeping. This functionality is provided by means of IT supports for 
better patient care, as well as standards and APIs in order to achieve integration of applica-
tions and interoperate with other Providers. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise has been 
successful in enabling interoperability. In order to respond effectively to interoperability you 
need to set out an Integration Roadmap, showing how it will use open APIs and standards 
to migrate towards the EHR.

90 Recent advances in information technology
4.3.1 Registration of patients
This functionality ensures that all patients (or generally entitled citizens) are registered and their 
demographic and administrative data are entered and their entitlement to coverage of health 
care rendered is verified. The Social Security Number (SSN) can be used for verification of 
entitlement to coverage of health care. Each facility can compare a patient’s SSN with the Social 
Administration’s (SA) electronic information to determine if the SSN is valid. When there is a 
match with the SA database, the correct number is added to the patient’s registration record.
4.3.2 Management of contacts
This functionality encompasses scheduling of contacts (visits, admissions) and recording 
relevant data on each contact. All other moves of the patients through the health care facil-
ity are recorded as well—e.g. discharges or transfers for specialised services. Each diagnosis 
and treatment event is recorded, including test results, observations, procedures, medications, 
clinical notes and outcome. All data on patients, contacts and medical events are stored in 
one patient’s database and can be shared easily in pace with the access constraints within a 
single or a group of health care facilities.
4.3.3 Management of referrals
The functionality represents automatic support of workflow within the health care facili-
ties. Each referral including relevant data is automatically routed to respective destination. 
It can be retrieved from a queue of tasks (sent referrals), scheduled for accomplishment and 
the results can be sent back to the sender. The sender can read the results, assess them and 
include them into the patient’s medical history. The referrals can be in-house, to other health 
care facilities or to other contracted providers. The functionality also includes: tracking of 
all pending referrals; retrieving status of a single referral; retrieval data from the referral; link 
to other functionalities, such as scheduling of care or management of contacts; automated 
support for routine referrals; statistical reporting on “traffic of referrals”.
4.3.4 Reporting
The functionality encompasses both external and internal reporting. The external reporting 
concerns producing reports in the specified format (electronically or paper-based) for: national 
health statistics; public purchaser; public health institution; other health care facilities (e.g. 
report on hospital discharge). The reports for internal purpose provide data on internal activi-
ties relating to frequencies and costs from different perspectives. External reporting relies on 
a fixed set of predefined reports whereas internal reporting encompasses both a fixed set of 
predefined reports and report builder tools for generating “ad hoc” reports and analytic tools 
(so called OLAP tools) for more detailed analysis. Production of a consolidated medical history 
for individual patients can be regarded as a predetermined form of internal reporting as well.
4.3.5 Invoicing and claiming
The functionality is necessary for collecting the revenue of health care facilities and has to 
be linked to the functionality for registration of patients and management of contacts. The 
functionality includes: preparation of insurance claims both for in-patient and out-patient 
cases; preparation of aggregate invoices for public purchaser; production of receipts for 
patients; payment collection of different types (deposit, prepayment, overpayment, partial 
payment and non-patient related charges); generating data for financial and accounting com-
ponents; provision of statistical data on revenues.
Having an interface with patient and performance registration, the system facilitates obtain-
ing accurate demographic records of the patients and calculates the charges automatically 
according to the patient’s attendance information, such as patient status and services consumed. 
The system has to provide contract control by calculating the cumulative outstanding charges 
and periodically issuing bills to the discharged patients. The accounting and statistic offices can 

Interoperability of the health care information resources 91
benefit from the reports regularly generated from the system to monitor the billing statuses 
of the hospitals and to take any follow-up actions on the debtors if necessary. The statistical 
reports from the system allow the account and statistical office to perform financial analysis.
4.3.6 Financial and cost accounting
This functionality enables to keep and present a consolidated financial position of the health 
care institution. Actually, this is a subset of the Enterprise Resource Planning functionality. 
The functions to be supported by the system are: financial control and planning; chart of 
accounts for analysis and performance comparison; payment service tools; tools for flexible 
financial management reporting; availability for effective budget control on all budget levels; 
performance and expenditure planning; production of financial rapports for health care and 
financial authorities.
The objective of cost accounting is to manage and monitor the effectiveness and efficiency 
of health care services delivered to the patients. By means of this functionality it is possible 
to calculate the total costs of the institution and allocate them to services (service unit costs). 
Based on cost accounting, the system must trace the cost of the services to patient files. 
The functionality has to enable to calculate and trace the unit costs of services. It interfaces 
with the registration of the rendered medical services, statistics derived from financial (book-
keeping) and management accounting for analysing the performance. Financing and Man-
agement information need: a) to record revenue, expenses, and statistics; b) to analyse costs 
per service, per case and per patient treated; c) to support reporting. The information model 
shall determine the result of production as a combination of services provided by various 
units that provide intermediary services.
4.3.7 Interoperability of e-health organisations
Interoperability is a requirement for the successful deployment of EHR by enabling access to 
all relevant information at the diagnostic decision moment, regardless of location. In order 
to offer easier access to healthcare information EHRs are supporting the integration of het-
erogeneous HISs and interoperability of e-Health organisations. It is a system resulting from 
the cooperation of several subsystems that need to successfully exchange information relative 
to a specific healthcare process.
There is a challenge for the healthcare industry in achieving interoperability among appli-
cations provided by different vendors. Each department or clinic may use multiple applica-
tions to share clinical and administrative information among applications. Unfortunately, 
each application may support multiple communications interfaces that must be continu-
ally modified and maintained. Achieving interoperability among heterogeneous Healthcare 
Information Systems (HIS) is important because it will reduce costs associated with health-
care and contribute to more effective and efficient patient treatment, management, and care.
We addressed the major technical challenges for enabling interoperability between HISs. The 
proposed approach capacitates the integration of a wide range of heterogeneous data sources 
and also supports the decision making process through its OLAP and data-mining facilities. It 
builds a suitable solution for integration of high volumes of complex healthcare data. Since the 
data of participating healthcare organisations are virtually tied in a network and not physically 
replicated into a central data store, the solution incorporates possible security threats for the 
sensitive patient data. This approach is a step towards decentralisation of security assurance 
and towards strengthening of interoperability in the healthcare sector, which results in a better 
service for the patient, the medical personnel and the administrative staff.
4.4 TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION OF THE INFORMATION RESOURCES
To solve the problem of semantic interoperability between subjects of an HIS, a number of 
standards are used: systematised nomenclature of medical terms, a range of laboratory and 

92 Recent advances in information technology
clinical studies, clinical terminology treatments, medical classification of diseases, medica-
tions normalised names and HL7 syntax standards or exchanging DICOM image diagnosis 
data. The basis for application integration is the middleware software that provides message 
delivery using the communication bus. The management server implements the format of 
documents and controls the routing. Fig. 4.1 shows the general components which form the 
medical records when providing patient services in several domains of the healthcare.
Typically, MIS (medical information system) forms data sets to speed up processing. 
Transferring a data set is appropriate for medical statistics or payment for treatment. But 
if you need to take decisions regarding patient care, you must send a whole document to 
determine the semantics of the messages. Requirement standardisation should be focused on 
the functionality of the software to create and send messages to fill EHR (Electronic Health 
Record) “container” by a set of EMRs (electronic medical records). Information support of 
EHR consists of patient registry, EMR repository and EHR registry. The register includes 
patient identifiers to support EMR connections at medical organisations with the EHR reg-
ister. Personalized EMR are formed on the basis of relevant templates while EHR on the 
basis of EMR and logical connections between patient and entries (visit the patient in case 
of medical care, hospitalisation, and so on).
For compatibility of information systems the following components are applied: parsing 
message and storing data; access to information through the Web Services for interaction with 
external HISs; audit when dealing with personal data of patients and authorisation of access to 
data; integration of departmental a HIS with insurance funds. The information exchange sys-
tem using the XML language provides message invariance regarding the type of software. The 
main advantage of XML is that this standard transports metadata along with the relevant data.
4.4.1 EMR database
The data model is defined by relations between the classes of objects and dimension attributes 
of entities. When designing a database, one should consider clinical terms, data types and 
attributes binding EMR to the patient. The design of the EMR repository should implement 
a scheme with a fixed number of database tables. That is, the variability range of medical 
procedures should lead only to an increase in terminological dictionaries, and not a change 
in the physical database schema.
The need for storage of XML-data in a relational database is due to the use of XML 
for data exchange. The key problem is that relational data is strictly structured while XML 
data are structured arbitrarily. Each column of the relational table has a data type that can 
effectively perform their processing. XML can have different data types, making it difficult 
to process information.
In recent years, several XML data control systems have been proposed, using relational 
database management system with data management capabilities of the XML format

Interoperability of the health care information resources 93
(Krivonos and Khorozov 2014). There are several methods of storage designed for hierar-
chical XML documents into the object-relational model. The relational model is the most 
suitable for practical application, but the dimension attributes and complex data types are 
consuming design time. In a relational database an XML document is saved as symbolic 
objects in columns CLOB or BLOB. Disclaimer structure (XML-parsing documents) saves 
time and increases productivity. The  “analyser” for parsing XML-documents is a data 
retrieval tool. Cost analysis of data query and update increases in proportion to the size of 
the XMLdocuments. If XML and relational data representation are combined, the appropri-
ate balance between two possibilities must be found: to save documents in the XML column 
or conduct decomposition (shredding) of data storage in relational format.
To design a database with storage capabilities for XML data it is proposed to use rela-
tional approach of the document context and a hybrid approach at semantically coherent 
document sections. A document section is selected as the logical unit of storage media, like 
the table records. For each type of sections the XML Schema Definition (XSD) collection is 
constructed on the database server, according to the template.
For data exchange it is necessary to provide a module for loading data into the DB and XML 
data format extraction from the DB through a programmatic interface. API XML and ASP 
Web are common to software environments. To store XMLsections in a DB, objects are loaded 
into memory and then access to its components is organised through XPath queries. Data 
extraction is implemented using XPath expressions and indicating the way to the contextual 
elements using API. For example, you can easily request the section “Results” of the PMR for 
the examination episode. The following solution for EMR database design is proposed:
1. determining the protocol for information exchange between systems;
2. using the HTTP or TCP/IP transfer protocol;
3. serialisation of XMLfile data and deserialisation of the received message;
4. forming a collection of XMLschema sections;
5. loading the context and XMLsections to the database.
Decomposition of the document formally leads to its transformation. Thus, for the forma-
tion of a new message you should complete the assembly. EHR data may be prepared with 
queries to the EMR database for patient and specific EMR sections.
The conditions for access to patient information in real time are a key aspect of modern 
medical data processing servers of. The scheme transmission of the medical data is used 
in HL7 format. The elements of terminological dictionaries and healthcare information 
resources should be available on the help server. The Healthcare departments exchange data 
through the Web-service that provides authorised access to the EMR DB. Information sup-
port of the patient EHR and access to the health sector resources involves the Cloud tech-
nology. For effective EMR sharing and storing there implementation of communication 
standards is needed; development of standard interfaces (to achieve semantic HIS interop-
erability) and approval of electronic registration forms by medical institutions and health 
insurance organisations.
4.4.2 Internet of things implementation
The IoT describes a system which gives entities a virtual representation and registers them 
to a network. The advantages of the IoT are enhanced identification capabilities of things. 
Since all entities are tagged and have a unique representation, every scanning procedure will 
give a clear association to a virtual entity and its data. Today’s mobile devices, for instance, 
have similar processors to classic desktop computers, enhanced storage capacity and nearly 
permanent Internet access. Each has a unique address provided by an Internet service pro-
vider (ISP). They fulfil all IoT criteria and are also propagating information. The IoT using 
REST as a standard for synchronous data exchange actively promotes RESTful web archi-
tecture, supporting any network capable device as its extension.

94 Recent advances in information technology
The Entity is a global concept embracing a physical and/or virtual part. An Entity can be 
composed of a Physical Entity and have a Virtual Entity. An instance of a Physical Entity 
would be a sensor measuring a physical property. The Virtual Entity stands for the virtual 
part of an Entity. As such, a Virtual Entity would hold the value of a temperature sen-
sor attached to the Entity. The Virtual Entity reflects the character of the Physical Entity. 
Fig. 4.2 shows the elements composing the model.
The technological implementation of a system is based on transmission of data through 
the Internet. The eHealth facilities are equipped with devices for data collecting. In the IoT 
these devices are interconnected and share data over the network. This renders it possible 
to design independent operations, ranging from simple alarm system if an analysis shows a 
critical value for a specific patient’s vital signs or life support system. Network topology con-
sists of a set of sensors, a data registration unit, a data communication module and a data 
collection unit (Fig. 4.3).
Data collected from a node of the sensors are processed by the logger for further transmis-
sion. In terms of hardware and software, the logger uses a communication module for data 
transmission through a web interface on a DB server. For example, monitoring scenarios are 
supporting several types of indicators. Sensors record: a) numerical-tuple or discrete values 
(temperature, pulse oximetry, blood pressure) and continuous signal (ECG). The ECG sig-
nal detector provides a serial data stream, while the logger determines the PQRST-segment, 
using an algorithm for analysing ECG signals.
The apparatus may provide local storage of data, which are used for recording signals 
together with the results of their processing. The data logger together with the measuring

sensor may be actuators, which implement feedback if necessary. The information flow 
between the components of model is this: the application sends an XML with the patient ID, 
the Host reads the XML request, identifies the needed data, and sends it to the Emergency 
department where the data are read and filled in the chart.
The data acquisition system sends the e-Health files to the Remote Data Collection Host 
(RDCH). The RDCH has the responsibility to keep the body of information permanently 
in dedicated spaces. The Client/Server scheme permits control of the monitoring process. 
The monitoring process is distinguished by a basic and an emergency operational mode. In 
both modes, the monitoring process requires real-time recording of the individual’s vital sign, 
context, and geolocation data. The recorded data are included within one file and sent to the 
RDCH.
REST brings services into the browser: resources can be linked and bookmarked and the 
results are visible with any Web browser to be able to interact with the service. To achieve 
this, REST proposes two basic rules: 1) the application model is transformed from operation-
centric into a data-centric one. This means everything that offers services becomes a resource 
(e.g. a temperature sensor is a resource of the sensor node resource) that can be identified 
unambiguously using URIs; 2) the four main operations provided by HTTP (GET, POST, 
PUT, DELETE) are the only available operations on resources, they define a uniform inter-
face with well-known and shared semantics.
By creating RESTful APIs to integrate the services offered by devices and objects such 
as wireless sensor networks with any other Web content, a system of RESTful devices can 
facilitate the creation of cyber-physical mashups.
4.5 EHEALTH RESOURCE SERVER
This section will cover the design process of the FHIR Server resources which are relevant to 
eHealth. The aims are identifying methods applicable to reduce the effort in building REST-
ful services for the IoT. The main purpose is to provide a methodology to create web-services 
for eHealth. In an eHealth environment data consistency is a key element for a reliable serv-
ice. All REST constraints must apply to a server and it must be based on ROA. The system 
should be secured using basic authentication and offer at least XML and HTML responses. 
For eHealth Resource Server generation we are using three technologies: XSD file to describe 
the resources; Web Application Description Language file to define the functionality based 
on the XSD; Entity Relationship Model for storage on a database.
The methodology for creation of the resources database has the following steps:
1. Evaluate Data Sets (evaluate medical records to extract the entity sets).
2. Split data sets into resources (the sets are split into compositions and resources).
3. Name the resources with Uniform Resource Identifier (URI schema).
4. Design representations (define messages served by the server to the client and vice-
versa).
5. Resource storage (design the entity database relationship model).
The first step in building the service is to define the entities the service offers. For the 
eHealth Server everything starts with a use case representing a patient and a provider. The 
paths implement the structure are given by the object diagram in Fig. 4.4.
A URI scheme is represented by the resources and still respects all constrains on address-
ability. URIs can be separated into authority, path and query. A composition is therefore on 
a shorter path than a service resource. Queries can be used to filter lists according to their 
association. The URI scheme is shown in Table 4.2. This is a representation of the URIs for 
the entities defined in Fig. 4.4.
For each URI it is necessary to define which of the methods GET, POST, PUT or DELETE 
are applicable (Table 4.3).

Interoperability of the health care information resources 97
The eHealth Server uses Client for URL (c-URL) in a terminal shell and provides basic 
manipulation operations such as adding, removing and modifying of a resource. The server 
implements the transition from request in XML or URI form parameters to database entries 
and the transition from a database entry to a HTTP response containing an XML body 
(Fig. 4.5).
The system counts three components: a client, a server and a database. The client com-
municates to the server using an URI request containing XML-encoded messages. The server 
transforms those messages into an SQL request and assures transition of data to SQL. The 
business logic therefore handles both APIs and transition from one to the other. It binds all 
components together and ensures valid transitions. The system is able to transmit the data to 
the server and also support bidirectional communication receiving control signals from the 
server. The eHealth Server is responding in XML format answers as usual. This XML mes-
sage needs to be designed for automatically marshalling and unmarshalling client responses 
and has the structure which is defined by an XSD file.
4.6 VITAL SIGN REPRESENTATION FRAMEWORK
Consider a framework for a patient’s vital signs representations in terms of XML schema 
diagrams. We use an XML schema to define and specify the vital signs. Vital signs repre-
sented in accordance with this framework are suitable for forwarding, processing and ren-
dering within a heterogeneous environment which applies different formatting standards 
or uses a diversity of communication technologies. This section is about the design of a 
data format for e-health record and illustrates how to construct the data payloads protocol 
for exchange of vital signs between remote peer entities. E-health applications have been 
receiving more and more attention due to their ability to reshape healthcare delivery, like 
continuous and ubiquitous tele-monitoring and tele-treatment. The model for (encoded) 
vital sign representations and conversions enables the specifications of data that satisfy the 
requirements of the end users (healthcare professionals) and match with the capabilities of 
the RESTful platforms.
The telemonitoring system includes the following hardware and software components 
(Costin et  al., 2010). A wireless biophysical and biochemical sensor network sub-system, 
composed by transducers for vital signs and data transmission. The platform of heterogene-
ous sensors is a key functional feature of the telemonitoring system. The devices allowing 
monitoring of the vital parameters are the following: a) the body temperature module; b) the 
blood pressure module; c) the oxygen saturation (SpO2) module that also computes the car-
diac rhythm; d) the respiration module; e) n-leads ECG module records and transmits data 
through a radio transceiver interface.
Application Software is designed for:
1. Data acquisition and processing, signal analysis, data transmission to server;
2. Interface programs for duplex communication between sub-system and central server;
3. Alarm generating and transmission to the Ambulance; here necessary decisions are taken, 
based on specific medical knowledge;
4. Extra data processing programs at the central server level (medical statistics, research 
informatics management, etc.).

98 Recent advances in information technology
The development of technology, such as sensor nodes which are replacing existing medi-
cal devices, opens up a new opportunity for eHealth innovation. The linkage of monitoring 
devices directly to healthcare providers is a step forward for preventative health. The inter-
operability across multiple platforms and devices together with the integration of data into 
efficacious resources may affect clinical decision support. Mobile health gateways will emerge 
to facilitate connection and transfer from mobile networks to existing HISs.
4.6.1 Specification of the framework
We are using patient-centric approach to design the framework. This makes a framework which 
support diverse vital sign representations for a particular patient. The XML schema diagram 
can visualise the hierarchical structure of the PMR. The structure is present in Fig. 4.4. It 
consists of two parts: Patient Demographics Records (PDR) and Vital Sign Records (VSR). 
A patient’s ID item of PDR is the mandatory element among all the child-items.
This is to fulfil the privacy requirement of the end-user stakeholder. In addition to conven-
tional sensors for Vitals, a Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used for user geoloca-
tion. Based on the medical scenarios, a few vital sign types are supported, as shown in Fig. 4.6. 
These types could be divided into the following categories: a) the numerical-tuple vital sign 
type, e.g. temperature, SaO2 and blood pressure; b) the waveform vital signs type, e.g. ECG.
Each vital sign record has a Data section and a Property section. The property section is 
specified as a complex type. It provides the necessary information for processing the vital sign 
data correctly.
The data section representation of the Vital signs is shown in Fig. 4.7:
For example, a recording of measuring the heart rate and blood oximetry in XML-format 
is represented in Fig. 4.8:
The package data is composed of a set of discrete values of blood oxygen saturation and 
pulse rate. Monitoring of the patient data record is delivered together with the results of pre-
liminary signal processing. Some of a patient’s vital signs data range is given in Table 4.4. The 
following physiological conditions cause alerts when the deviation from the norm exceeds the 
specified range:
The Host Analytical Server, which accepts the vital data, takes into account the critical 
values of the vitals to start the trigger procedure for an ambulance. The nodes of the network 
consist of transducers and actuators. The Server of the analytical system, taking into account

the provision of emergency medical care from the actuator which plays the role of a syringe 
with an injection.
4.6.2 Database for telemonitoring system
Wireless devices can transmit remote diagnosis via the Internet network for further analysis 
of the information and provision of feedback. The main problem of data acquisition is the 
parsing and analysis of messages before loading information into the database. A technology 
platform to provide a unified application interface scheme for data analysis regardless of the 
structure of signals is proposed. The software adapter is used to bridge the gap between the 
interface device and the server platform.
It must be taken into account that recording medical data in waveform and discrete form 
that affects the structure of the data warehouse is needed: the identification of the patient; 
identification of the type of sensor spatial coordinates; date and time of measurement 
parameters. The DB for PMR should combine different types of monitoring data. This elimi-
nates the need to restructure the data warehouse to add new types of sensors. The database 
is needed to take into account the spatial coordinates, date and time of measurement and the 
values of each subscriber network. The structure of the medical record database is described 
by the following diagram (Fig. 4.9):

The Code procedure on SQL server implements the logic of parsing and loading data into 
the database from XML files. To load the data it is necessary to parse an XML file on the 
elements and export data to relational tables of the SQL server. Apply the standard algorithm 
for loading XML data to SQL server: a) record control code that implements the logic of 
parsing an XML file; b) create the loading procedure of data in the database table. After 
transferring the measurement results through Web-service, files are checked for validity and 
loaded to the database. The example query for analytical parameters and ECG waveform to 
a relational database are presented in Fig. 4.10.
When applying the reverse procedure, query forms ECG.xml file with the values of the 
elements that were initially loaded to database.
The system provides two levels of information processing. At the first level the critical 
values of the physiological parameters are detected, the result report is formed and transmit-
ted to the analytical centre. At the second level the patient’s data are recorded in the form 
of medical reports. At the same time the patient’s medical reports can be accessible via Web-
services for healthcare providers which should be notified for making appropriate decisions. 
The patient’s critical vital signs are transmitted to the monitoring center for collection and 
processing.

4.7 CONCLUSIONS
This article analyses some aspects of enabling interoperability in HISs. EMR are sup-
ported by multiple heterogeneous HISs which improves the efficiency of healthcare 
processes through timely access to information. EMR consist of components that are 
subsystems to the system of EHR. The main problem comes from the fact that those sub-
systems are usually standalone systems which have their own functions. These subsystems 
need to act jointly to serve the functions of the overall system. Therefore, heterogeneous 
HISs must cooperate to implement the use cases of a specific healthcare process.
The impediments to achieve interoperability in HISs are divided into categories, which it 
is necessary to specify for open distributed processing systems: a) Technical, relating to prob-
lems in communication, which include connection, syntactic, data consistency; b) Semantic, 
relating to information exchanged, which include interpretation and reference; c) Functional, 
relating to the difference between the expected behaviours of a component, which include 
functional model, embedding and intention; and d) Logistical, relating to the impact of the 
design on the system.
When defining the system requirements, designing or testing, impediments need to be 
addressed to ensure that the resulting system will successfully support the healthcare proc-
esses. We presented a mobile application that leverages the emerging e-Health standard HL7 
FHIR, which enables easy implementation and integration of healthcare systems, using tech-
nologies that are especially suitable for mobile environments. The application, based on the 
information resources of the FHIR standard, facilitates the interaction between healthcare 
professionals and patients and offers the means for continuous monitoring of their health. 
An essential step is to enable efficient sharing of health measurement streams via FHIR 
resources. The HL7 FHIR standardisation initiative builds on the previous HL7 standards 
and allows easy implementation.
The standard defines lightweight resources that function as an interoperability base 
between communicating healthcare systems, while supporting resource extensibility and use 
of customised vocabularies and ontologies. On the client side, each operation of the REST 
interface can be easily bound to specific components. Firstly, it preserves the responsiveness 
of the application while fetching the relevant resources. Secondly, it supports on demand 
resource consumption and aggregation. On the server side, the REST interface facilitates the 
easy enforcement of the access control policies, by developing an HTTP filter handling all 
incoming REST calls.
Moreover, FHIR resources and their relations are easily mapped to a relational database 
schema enabling their storage and retrieval. The REST approach to build Health services 
on the Web originates by the necessity of the evolving the health service to accommodate 
emerging needs that are complex. The architecture inherits some of the basic Web techniques 
to implement a highly scalable and flexible system that is able to satisfy the current needs. 
Without changing the IT infrastructure, this approach could be implemented by an interface 
to access data and resources.

APPENDIX A. HEALTHCARE INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS
Interoperability depends upon syntax and semantics. A number of standards have been 
developed to address the requirements of both types of interoperability. The following cat-
egories of standards are used in healthcare:
Messaging standards – messaging standards outline the structure, content and data 
requirements of electronic messages to enable the effective sharing of information. The term 
‘message’ refers to a unit of information that is sent from one system to another, such as 
between a laboratory information system and a GP’s clinical information system. Examples 
of messaging standards are HL7 v2.x for administrative data and Digital Imaging and Com-
munications in Medicine (DICOM) for radiology images.
Terminology standards – terminology standards provide specific codes for terminologies 
and classifications for clinical concepts such as diseases and medications. Terminology sys-
tems assign a unique code or value to a specific disease or entity, for example, the ICPC-2 
code for ‘asthma’ is R96. Terminologies are used primarily to capture clinical information 
at the point of care. It is necessary to select different classifications and terminologies in 
combination to enable complete coverage across all of healthcare. Examples of terminology 
standards include ICPC-2, ICD-10, SNOMED CT for clinical terms and LOINC for labora-
tory results.
Document standards – document standards indicate the type of information included in a 
document and also the location of the information. Examples of document standards include 
the paper-based SOAP standard and CDA for electronic sharing of clinical documents. HL7 
have developed document-standard specifications for a continuity of care document (HL7 
CCD) and a discharge summary (HL7 DS).
Conceptual standards – conceptual standards allow the transmission of information 
between systems without any loss of the meaning or context of that information. For exam-
ple, the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) provides a framework for describing 
health information and the context around it, i.e. who, what, when, where and how.
Application standards – application standards determine the implementation of business 
rules for software systems to interact with each other. For example, application standards 
can allow a single user to log in to multiple information systems in one environment, allow-
ing efficient access to the required health information. This can facilitate the simultane-
ous viewing of health information across multiple databases that are not electronically 
integrated.
Architecture standards – architecture standards define a generic model for health informa-
tion systems. They allow the integration of health information systems by providing guid-
ance to aid the planning and design of new systems as well as the integration of existing 
systems. This is achieved by defining common data elements and business logic between sys-
tems. For example, the CEN standard ENV12967 Healthcare Information Systems Archi-
tecture provides an open architecture that is independent of technical specifications and 
applications.

INTRODUCTION
Plants as well as all organic matter suffer due to impact of stress factors of natural or anthro-
pogenic origin. Using of smart portable device to diagnose the plants state under impact 
of such stresses to agriculture and environmental monitoring enables us to apply advanced 
measures in time to protect the plants from diseases, to save and increase crop capability 
and reduce the expenditure on unit of product and harmful substances content in plants. 
Application of this kind of the devices is very important in precise farming, since this new 
agriculture technology needs the automation of all of its elements.
Unforeseen climate changes and difficulties in using of statistical data demonstrated huge 
necessity to develop models for forecasting crop yield and influence of climate on it. These 
models have to be based on current, but not only statistical data.. Input data for these models 
is urgent and important task. To get such data, the Earth remote monitoring techniques (e.g. 
space observations) and acquiring data from surface tools for monitoring of plant state can 
be taken into consideration. It is important to mention that these data are very significant for 
precise agriculture technology, which also operates on models for forecasting crop yield and 
is used to minimize the costs (e.g. water, fertilizers etc.) and maximize the harvest.
Therefore, acquiring of current and objective data of plant cover state is very important 
factor in most cases, which creates a future strategy of maintenance of agricultural lands, 
woodlands, parklands and proper decision making. Certainly, it would be ideal to obtain 
information about improvement or worsening of plant cover state beforehand, not after the 
event. It lets to avoid increasing costs and save harvest and green plantations from a pos-
sible loss.
The plants ability to complete photosynthesis depends on a range of factors including 
stresses caused by environmental conditions. Absorbed light energy used for photosynthe-
sis is dissipated by emission of heat and re-emission of small but diagnostically significant 
amounts of absorbed radiation such as long-wave red/far-red light energy. This re-emission 
of light is named as induction of fluorescence of chlorophyll. Maximum induction of fluo-
rescence of chlorophyll occurs in the red region of the spectrum (685 nm) and extends into 
the infra-red region to around 800 nm. Chlorophyll fluorescence emission from the whole 
leaf systems is too weak to be observed with the naked eye, but it can well be observed with 
special devices such as fluorometers.
As a result of the program of Presidium of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 
(NASU) “Development in the field of sensor systems and technology” in V.M. Glushkov 
Institute of Cybernetics of NASU, portable smart devices of “Floratest” family aimed to 

106 Recent advances in information technology
diagnose the influence of stress factors on the plant state has been developed (Romanov et al. 
2007). The portable device measures Chlorophyll Fluorescence Induction (CFI) without the 
plant destruction. Using the curve of CFI (alike the cardiogram) allows to diagnose an influ-
ence of one or more factors on the plant state.
5.1 STATE OF THE ART
The method of chlorophyll fluorescent induction has been known for more than 80 years 
(Kautsky and Hirsch 1931). This is a sensitive, non-invasive method of prompt estimation 
of plant state. The matter of the method is following: if you illuminate chlorophyll by blue 
light, it begins to emit light in red spectral region. It is possible to estimate the plant state 
by the curve form of intensity of emitting light of chlorophyll. But to detect an unique rela-
tion between the plant state and the intensity of emitted light of chlorophyll, it is necessary 
to develop special methods, which allow detection the type of stress factors (for example, 
drought, freeze etc.), natural of anthropogenic factors, kind of viral infection or bacterial 
load, sort of plant and so on. It should be mentioned that for the different sorts of the same 
plant there are many different kinds of of such a relation.
The method of chlorophyll fluorescent induction has been studied and developed in well-
known universities of the USA (R.B. Peterson and D.E. Aylor, Department of Biochemistry 
and Genetics (R.B.P.) and Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology (D.E.A.), The Con-
necticut Agricultural Experiment Station, 123 Huntington Street, New Haven, Connecticut

ence, University of Tokyo), Canada (Stephen S. Bates. Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Marine Ecology Laboratory, Bedford Institute of Oceanography Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, 
Canada), Western Europe (Alfred R. Holzwarth, Max-Plank Institute, Germany) and Russia 
(Moscow state university) and etc.
Precise farming is based on control of productivity of agricultural manufacture with 
taking into account changing of performance of external environment. According to pre-
cise farming agriculture, fields are digitized and remote monitoring is done with systematic 
ground measuring of plant states to make a final decision.
The aim of precise farming is to get maximum crop with optimum expenditure on fertiliz-
ers, herbicides, biology active additions, including energy and water recourses.
Nowadays, the integration of different sensors in networks for data acquisition is used in 
many areas of human activities. The technology of sensor networks has a promising future. 
Although many leading R&D organizations and universities in the world are interested 
in this technology, a lot of bottlenecks remain, for example, sensor resistance to climate 
changes, reducing of power consumption, possibility to cover large territories, sensor reli-
ability, repeating of measure results, self-organization of sensors in case of damaging of a 
separate sensor from the network etc.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a technology with a promising future. Nowadays, wire-
less technologies are used in many areas of precise farming and ecological monitoring: spatial 
data collection, irrigation, variable-rate technology and providing data for farmers, plants 
and trees protection etc. In fact, a number of studies have been published in the last fifteen 
years on applications of using of wireless sensor networks in precise farming and ecological 
monitoring.
Sensor networks for acquiring of data, particularly wireless sensor networks for precise farm-
ing, environmental protection and ecological monitoring, now are studied and developed by 
many well-known R&D organization and universities, for example, Department of Environ-
mental Sciences, University of Virginia, USA (John Porter), Freie Universität Berlin, Institute of 

Independent devices and wireless sensor networks for agriculture and ecological 107
Computer Science, Germany (Tomasz Naumowicz, Jochen Schiller), Taiwan Forestry Research 
Institute, Taiwan (Chau-Chin Lin), Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Univer-
sity of Limerick, Ireland (Essa Jafer), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organ-
isation, Australia (Chris Knight, Kate Cavanagh, Christopher Munnings), Graduate School of 
Bioresources, Japan (Takaharu Kameoka, Atsushi Hashimoto) and many others.
Authors of papers (López et al. 2009) and (Haldar et al. 2011) described wireless sensor 
networks, which are able to acquire data about soil and environment parameters. The main 
purpose of these systems is monitoring large territories. In (Gomide et al. 2001), mobile field 
data acquisition system is described, developed to collect data for crop management and 
spatial-variability studies. Data acquiring and control systems are placed on farm machines. 
The system is able to conduct local field survey and to collect data of ground water avail-
ability, soil compaction, soil fertility, biomass yield, leaf area index, leaf temperature, leaf 
chlorophyll content, plant water status, local climate data, insect-disease-weed infestation, 
grain yield etc. Paper (Lee et al. 2002) describes silage yield mapping system, which included 
a GPS, load cells, a moisture sensor and a Bluetooth wireless communication module.
The moisture sensor and the Bluetooth transmitter were installed on the chopper. Authors 
of (Lee et al. 2002) had developed a wireless, infrared thermometer system for in-field data col-
lection. The system consists of infrared sensors, programmable logic controllers and low power 
radio transceivers to collect data in the field and transmit it to a remote receiver outside the field. 
In (Evans and Bergman 2007), wireless sensors has been used in the system to assist irrigation 
scheduling using combined on-site weather data, remotely acquired data and grower preferences.
Paper (Camilli et al. 2007) describes a simulation to demonstrate the utility of a wireless 
sensor network in precise agriculture. Authors of paper (Pierce and Elliot 2008) described a 
platform that they developed for local and regional networks and implementations of them 
in two precise agriculture applications. In (Morais et al. 2008), a prototype developed to be 
deployed on vineyards to monitor crops of this type has been described. Detailed analysis of 
WSNs applications in medicine and health care is given in (Jeong Gil Ko et al. 2010).
It should be mentioned that in all examined papers, proposed systems measure different 
parameters of soil, plants and environment (temperature, humidity, biochemical property of 
plants, even sound range etc.). But none of the systems measure parameters of photosyn-
thesis—the main process of plant vital activity. If it is necessary to estimate plant state and 
influence of stress factors of natural or anthropogenic origin on them, the most effective 
and informative way for accurate estimating of plant state is to measure the photosynthesis 
parameters in plants.
5.2 PRINCIPLES OF DEVICE OPERATION
As a result of external influence, different objects, including biological ones, can emit great 
amounts of radiation that is not related to these objects’ temperature.
All the types of radiation, which were caused by some external sources of energy, are called 
luminescence. Duration of luminescence after external influence stopping exceeds period of 
light fluctuations. Luminescence is conditioned by fluctuations of relatively small number of 
atoms or molecules of substance that become excited under energy source activity. Radiation 
is a result of transformation of atoms’ or molecules’ states into fundamental (unexcited) or 
less excited (they have less energy) states.
This is well described by quantum theory, according to which every stationary orbit con-
forms to definite value of atom’s energy (Bore’s postulate). Being placed on stationary orbits, 
an electron doesn’t radiate and doesn’t absorb electromagnetic waves. According to the sec-
ond Bore’s postulate, radiation and absorption can take place only when atom changes its 
state from one stationary state to another:

108 Recent advances in information technology
where ϖmn or vmn – photon’s frequency, Em, En – energy values of states m and n, h – Planck’s 
constant, m and n – the numbers of energy states. At the same time, electron jumps from one 
stationary orbit to another.
Luminescence is defined by the structure of substance energy spectrum, the average time 
of staying in excited states and rules of selection, which allow absorption or radiation of light 
of defined frequency. Short-timed luminescence is also called fluorescence. Luminescence 
which appears during lighting of substance (phosphor) with visible or ultraviolet light is 
called photoluminescence. Usually process of luminescence satisfies Stokes shift that claims, 
that wave length λ’ of emission light is longer than wave λ of absorption light. According to 
the quantum theory, this means that photon’s energy hϖ (hv) is used partially for non-optical 
processes:
 
h

,
where ϖ′ – luminescence’s frequency, E – energy waste on another process.
Luminescence is characterized by energy output, which equals to ratio of luminescence 
energy to energy that was absorbed by substance in stable conditions.
Energy efficiency of photoluminescence increases proportionally to wave length λ of 
absorbed light up to the definite maximum value at λ = λmax and then rapidly decreases to 
zero at λ > λmax (Vavilov’s rule). A sharp decrease of energy at λ > λmax is taking place due to 
the fact that at these wave lengths λ the energy of absorbed photons is not enough for the 
process of phosphor atoms and molecules transfer to the excited states.
Ratio of luminescence photons number to absorbed photons with fixed energy is called 
quantum yield of photoluminescence. According to Vavilov’s rule, which is under Stokes 
shift, quantum yield of photoluminescence doesn’t depend on wave length of excited light 
and rapidly decreases for anti-Stokes radiation.
Intensity of luminescence I depends on behaviour of elementary processes, that causes this 
radiation. In case of spontaneous luminescence, when radiation starts after light absorption, 
during which atoms or molecules are transmitted to the excited level, that is placed higher 
than the level at which radiation takes place and then these atoms (molecules) are transmitted 
to the luminescence level, intensity is subordinate to exponential rule

(5.1)
where I – lighting intensity at the moment t, I0 – lighting intensity in a moment of excited 
radiation stopping, τ ≈ 10–9 – 10–10 – an average duration of excited state of phosphor atoms 
or molecules. Luminescence of compound molecules and phosphorescence (after lighting) of 
organic substance are subordinate to the rule (5.1).
Under influence of light there can be happened photochemical transformation of sub-
stance (including photosynthesis), which is called photochemical reactions. In a process of 
such reactions, light absorption takes place. Energy is spent on compound molecules and 
polyatomic ions decomposition to build parts and on creation of compound molecules of 
primary ones. An example of photochemical reactions is decomposition carbon dioxide 
under influence of light

Carbon dioxide decomposition takes place in green parts of plants under sun light influ-
ence, as photochemical process, which is a part of photosynthesis.
One of the most important properties of the molecule of chlorophyll, which is the basic 
pigment of plant cell, is ability to fluoresce. This phenomenon was researched for the first 
time by Kautsky (Kautsky and Hirsch 1934) and named as chlorophyll fluorescence induc-
tion (CFI) or “Kautsky effect”.

Independent devices and wireless sensor networks for agriculture and ecological 109
Dependence of chlorophyll fluorescence induction on time passed after start of lightning 
of plant’s leaves is known as an induction curve or a chlorophyll fluorescence induction 
curve (Fig. 5.1). The form of this curve is rather sensible to changes in the photosynthetic 
apparatus of plants during adaptation to different environmental conditions. This fact is a 
basis for extensive usage of Kautsky effect in photosynthesis research. The advantages of 
the method of CFI are the following: high self-description, expression, non-invasiveness and 
high sensibility.
Pigmental complex is the main element of photosynthetic apparatus. Pigments are com-
pound (complex molecules), which absorb light in visible spectral region (400–700  nm). 
Green pigment of chlorophyll absorbs light in red and blue spectral regions, and in green 
spectral region this pigment reflects the light. Today there are more than 10 types of chloro-
phyll known, but the main pigment is chlorophyll “a”. Spectral range of chlorophyll “a” is 
shown in Fig. 5.2.
At the initial moment of time, all channels of photosynthetic transferring of electrons 
are open and maximum of energy of excited electrons is used for photosynthetic process. At 
this moment, the chlorophyll fluorescence is minimal and indicated on the Kautsky curve as 
F0. Transition F1 – F0 is attributed to reduction of electron-transferring. Transition F1 – F0 is 
observed, for example, during short period of heat adaptation. Whole stage F0 – FP is called 
as fast stage of fluorescence. Slow stage of CFI includes all inductive transition after peak P 
reaching. Segments of CFI curve are more detailed described in Table 5.1.

Ability to estimate plants states using changing of Kautsky curve form is experimental. So 
there are examples of changing form of this curve under influence of external factors.
Increase of environment temperature relative to optimal for definite plant type causes 
decreasing of difference FV = FP – F0. It comes as a result of decreasing of activity of elec-
tron-transport chain or lighting activity of photosynthesis. During increasing of temperature 
to destruction level (45–50°C), the level of intensity F0 increases noticeable. It’s possible to 
choose plants sort that are stable to high temperature influence using these parameters.
Decreasing of environments’ temperature relative to optimal for definite plant type causes 
also decreasing of difference FV = FP – F0, because of oppression of photochemical activ-
ity photosystem PSII. Ratio (F1 – F0)/FV is increasing. These features allow selecting cold-
resistant plants.
Salinity of ground results in decreasing of level of FP and F0. Ratio (FP – F0)/FP is decreas-
ing. It comes as a result of oppressing of photo system PSII activity. Using these features it’s 
possible to choose plants that are stable ground salinity.
Water deficit results in decreasing of subtraction FP – F0 in direct proportion with decreas-
ing of water potential of leaf. Most probable reason is slowing down of photo system PSII 
recovery of primary acceptor because of oppression of excretion oxygen and intersystem 
transport of electrons.
5.3 PORTABLE DEVICE “FLORATEST”
The portable device of “Floratest” family (see Fig. 5.3) measures intensity of chlorophyll 
fluorescent induction without plant destruction. By the form of curve of chlorophyll fluo-
rescent induction (similar to cardiogram) the influence of stress factor to the plant is deter-
mined. Such devices are manufactured by foreign companies, but their unit price is about 
1 thousand euro. In addition, applied software and amount of methods of the devices are 
limited and they are designed as constrained systems.
Thereby, if needed method and program are absent in the device manual, it is impossible 
to add it to the device new methods and programs developed by customer. Furthermore, it 
is impossible to update the devices by user to increase of application scope. Because of that, 
the usage of the devices, for example, in Ukraine, is limited because of high prices and lack 
of methods and applied software for a broad application scope.
Figure 5.3. Portable device of “Floratest” family.

Independent devices and wireless sensor networks for agriculture and ecological 111
The firms in USA, Canada, Western European countries manufacture portable devices 
for measuring chlorophyll fluorescent induction to diagnose of a plant state. There are such 
well-known companies among them as Opti Sciences, USA, (www.optisci.com), Hansatech 
Instruments, Great Britain (www.hansatech-instruments.com), Heinz Walz, Germany, (www.
walz.com), EARS, Netherlands, (www.ears.nl).
The competitive performances of developing portable device “Floratest” and competitors 
are given in the Table 5.2.
Photosynthesis and induction of fluorescence of chlorophyll operate in a direct compe-
tition for a finite pool of absorbed light energy. Any change in energy utilization by one 
process produces a complementary change in the others. So this fact enables induction of 
fluorescence of chlorophyll to be used as a prompt and reliable non-invasive estimation of 
photosynthesis.
Fluorometers are intended specifically to detect the chlorophyll fluorescence emission 
from a leaf of plant. The main features of new design are wide dynamic range, high precision 
and speed, low quiescent current and low operating voltage. The device is to be designed as 
an open system, user reprogrammable and easy-to-use. To be used in field conditions, the 
new design has to be portable and be equipped with a battery with low operating voltage.

process. Luminous intensity of the diode is 120 mcd, viewing angle 130 degree and dominant 
wavelength 470 nm. Typical electrical characteristics curves of blue diode FYLS-0603UBC 
are shown in Fig. 5.6, Fig. 5.7 and Fig. 5.8.
The remote optical sensor is built as a “reflection diagram” on the basis of four light- 
emitting diodes and one photodetector. “Reflection diagram” means that light-emitting 
diodes and photodetector are situated on the same side of researched leaf. To research chlo-
rophyll fluorescence in the red spectral region, the filter is placed on the input of photodetec-
tor. Emission intensity of light-emitting diodes and photodetector sensitivity can be changed 
during a measuring process.
The type of the photodiode amplifier is TSL251R (http://www.taosinc.com), combining a 
photodiode and a transimpedance amplifier on a single monolithic integrating circuit. These 
devices have improved amplifier offset-voltage stability and lowered power consumption and 
are supplied in a 3-lead clear plastic package with an integral lens. Functional block dia-
gram of TSL251R is shown in Fig. 5.9. The device is a single supply voltage operation with

is embedded in the device enclosure as a separate component, and in the future this board 
will be built in main printed circuit board of microprocessor unit. Principle electrical scheme 
of the dc/dc-converter is shown in Fig. 5.21 and manufactured printed circuit board of dc/
dc-converter is shown in Fig. 5.22. 
5.4 CREATING MAIN APPLICATION SOFTWARE
As mentioned above, developed device “Floratest” is built on the basis of microcontroller 
ADuC842. Company Analog Devices provides software for development and adjustment 
of this hardware. Software includes integrated environment “Aspire” for developing device 
software, which supports two programming languages (C and assembler), and environment 
“ADSIM” (Analog Devices Microconverter Simulator) for adjustment of device software.
By means of these tools, subprogram library for fluorimeter “Floratest” was developed. 
This library may be used in the future developments of the device software for diagnostics 
of biological object state. Subprogram library is an open tool and it can be complemented.

ment of the result visualization, user interface (user menu).

5.5 CONTRACT MANUFACTURE
It was used electronic contract manufacture of VD MAIS firm (Kyiv, Ukraine) (http://www.
vdmais.kiev.ua) for creating serial party of the portable biosensor of “Floratest” family.
So the main features of technical documentation were matching functional diagrams of 
device units with interoperability of Surface mount technology assembly line. There were

selected Surface mount technology electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, 
inductances, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits for device units and on this basis the 
technical documentation of the Printed circuit boards of microprocessor unit and remote 
optical sensor was designed. Serial “Floratest” device kit and CD with software and drivers 
are shown in Fig. 5.24 and Fig. 5.25.
According to Surface mount assembly technology, it takes several steps for the bare Printed 
circuit boards with solder paste, applied in the right places before becoming fully-fledged 
boards. The Surface mount technology machines pick and place the tiny resistors, solid-state 
capacitors and other Integrated Circuit chips onto the Printed circuit boards at ultra-high 
speeds.

If you look for example at the motherboard in computer, some of these small components 
are no more than 1 mm square. Each board passes through two sets of Surface mount tech-
nology high-speed machines, the ‘small pick and place’ and ‘large pick and place’ devices. 
Each machine in the set adds a few components, from tiny resistors up to Integrated circuit 
chips. Using belt fed from tape-like cartridges of components, the Surface Mount Technol-
ogy gear places components like a machine gun, needing as little as an eighth of a second to 
place a component with exact precision on the Printed circuit boards.
During the manufacturing of printed circuit boards of all units of the device, there was 
fine-tuned assembly technological processes and technical documentation too. For the per-
fection of documentation and manufacture technology, there were created more than one 
hundred printed circuit boards of all types.
Structure of contract manufacture technological line and its composition are shown in 
Fig. 5.26.
5.6 OPTICAL SENSOR TESTING
Leaf structure and chlorophyll structure ensure certain optical properties of native chlo-
rophyll, which have to be considered during working out testing methods for sensor of the 
“Floratest” device.
Testing of device sensor is necessary to compare measuring results and to determine val-
ues of different devices. Nowadays, the sensor testing and calibration is made during device 
manufacturing, but sometimes it can be executed during the device operation.
The most suitable method among known testing methods of measuring is using standard 
instruments and simulators of measuring value, notably singular standards of fluorescence, 
absorption and reflection of native chlorophyll.
Using of standard instruments for sensor testing is complicated by impossibility of ensur-
ing equal metrological and technical conditions for standard instruments and tested sensors. 
So, for sensors of portable devices (like “Floratest” device), there are such features:
1. different sizes of illuminated spot (0.5–10 mm);
2. necessity of native chlorophyll and leaf intactness;
3. heterogeneity of optical properties within bounds of one leaf;
Figure 5.26. Structure and composition of contract manufacture technological line.
Helping Children Face Tough Issues 
Helping Children Face Tough Issues 

122 Recent advances in information technology
4. variability of functional characteristics, namely chlorophyll fluorescence induction;
5. difference of the result presentation;
6. constructive disagreement with sensor unit;
7. absence of testing methods;
8. multitype standard instruments;
9. necessity of certification of standard instruments.
For sensor testing, it is reasonable to use standards of fluorescence, absorption and reflec-
tion, which meet the next requirements:
1. homogeneity and stability of optical characteristics within bounds of the standard;
2. independence of optical characteristics from environmental conditions;
3. small size, weight and constructive compliance with sensor unit;
4. possibility to use in standard instruments and tested devices;
5. single-type of standard optical characteristics and measuring value;
6. possibility of calibration without using of plant leaf;
7. possibility and convenience of testing in field conditions;
8. possibility of standard certification;
9. low cost of standard.
Standards for testing of sensors of developed devices have to simulate optical characteris-
tics of chlorophyll and consider technical features of tools for measuring of these character-
istics (see Fig. 5.27).
In developed “Floratest” device, the photoreceiver with filters has to be tested. Standard 
for such testing is a source of light with spectral characteristics, which are similar to chloro-
phyll optical characteristics. Standard is placed in sensor on the place of plant leaf. Spectral 
characteristics of testing can also be provided by three passive standards, which have optical 
characteristics similar to optical characteristics of chlorophyll.
The requirements to chlorophyll fluorescence standard mentioned above can be met by 
glass plate (15 × 15 × 2 mm), placed in the sensor instead of plant leaf. When standard is 
illuminated by light intensity of 50 W/m2, the device has to show straight line parallel to time 
axis, equal 0.6 (quantum yield) of maximum measurement range. This value can be reached 
by changing amplifier gain of photoreceiver. Such standard using for testing of sensor of the 
developed “Floratest” device lets to equalize amplitude characteristics during manufacturing 
of pilot party of devices.

Independent devices and wireless sensor networks for agriculture and ecological 123
Normative values of chlorophyll concentration for optical absorption by standard on 
proper wavelengths are determined by parallel photocolorimetric determination (Bulatov 
and Kalinkin 1972) of chlorophyll extracts and standard of chlorophyll absorption.
Also during testing of reflection type sensor, there are used universal integral standards 
of reflection. Determination of reflection coefficients of leaf is fulfilled in wavelength range 
from 310 to 1100  nm. System UniCpec-SC proposes some white standards of maximal 
reflection.
As standards of reflection (WWW/PPSYstems.cjm), plates covered by paint are used. 
Maximal reflection is given by paint on the base of magnesia, and minimal—on the base of 
soot.
Testing includes next operations:
1. Checking device functionality after switching on according to operating manual.
2. Setting necessary modes.
3. Execution of one measurement without standard. Device sensor gives black current.
4. Standard placing and execution of one measurement:
 
–  chlorophyll sensor show straight line, parallel to X axis and equals 0.65 of maximum 
scale;
 
–  absorption type sensor gives values of passing red and infrared light, and the difference 
with incident signal gives absorption signal;
 
–  reflection type sensor gives signal of maximum reflection on selected wavelength and 
signal of minimum reflection.
5. Measurement of the results on standards compare with normative values for these stand-
ards and estimate necessity and value of correction.
5.7  APPLICATION OF THE “FLORATEST” DEVICE IN AGRICULTURE 
AND ECOLOGICAL MONITORING
Portable device “Floratest” is used for real-time monitoring of plant state. The device opera-
tion is based on the chlorophyll fluorescent induction method mentioned above, and provides 
the estimation of photosynthesis process quality, which is the main process of plant vital 
activity. The “Floratest” devices are now used as a part of data acquisition systems or inde-
pendently for working out the methods for solution of following tasks:
1. prompt estimating of plant life activity after drought, freeze, imps, pesticide applica-
tion, impacts of climate fluctuations and stress factors of natural and anthropogenic 
origin etc.;
2. prompt estimating of optimal dozes of fertilizers, biological active admixtures and humic 
substances. It makes possible to increase protective attributes of plants and trees to the 
climate fluctuations, influence of stress factors of natural and anthropogenic origin and 
reduce the content of harmful substances in soil and plants;
3. express estimating by indirect methods of soil, water and air pollutions by pesticides, 
heavy metals, industrial emissions and their impact on green plantations in megalopolis;
4. ecological monitoring of state of megalopolis green plantations;
5. profound scientific research in area of ecological monitoring and environmental protec-
tion in universities and schools.
The experimental researches of the “Floratest” were conducted in National Scientific 
Center “V.E.Tairov’s Institute of viticulture and winemaking” of National Academy of 
Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine (Romanov 2007) and several farming in Ukraine and Germany.
Examples of the practical usage of fluorometer “Floratest” in the National Scientific 
Center “V.E.Tairov’s Institute of viticulture and winemaking” are shown in Fig. 5.28 and the 
graph of CFI on the device display are shown in Fig. 5.29.

124 Recent advances in information technology
Figure 5.28. The sensor of the “Floratest” on the leaf.
Figure  5.29. The image of CFI on the 
device’s display.
The conditions and results of the experimental researches are listed below.
Mature leaves of vine were used in the researches. Under changes of soil watering condi-
tions, there were observed sharp changes in behavior of induction transitions of chloro-
phyll fluorescence which were accompanied by quite essential changes of leaf tissue spectral 
characteristics.
Determination of fluorescence spectral characteristics was done by placing the device’s 
sensor on the leaf’s surface without integrity disturbance directly in a pot or in a field. It 
allowed to research on plastid and vacuolar pigments in their natural state and in that way 
approaching to understanding of the biophysical and physiology-biochemical processes 
which take place in the live leaf, and determination of important sides of photosynthetic 
activity.
Fluorescence intensity of the sample was determined in relative units.
It is significant that under natural conditions in the middle latitudes the drought is accom-
panied simultaneously by high temperatures of air, and that intensifies bad influence of 
ground water lack on agricultural plants.
Even in the first variant of experiment (drought), considerable changes of the behavior of 
fluorescence induction comparing to the control samples appeared. Changes appear in weak-
ening of penetrability of the chloroplasts’ membrane structures. That results in substantial 
increase of time characteristics of fluorescence induction slow decrease. At the same time, 
noticeable variety differences become apparent. Sharp decrease of its value is typical for pro-
found functional injuries of photosynthetic structures and cells of particular variety entirely.
Accordingly, in this stage of drought influence significant variety differences in exsiccate 
factor resistance of both photosynthetic structures and lamina’s parenchymal cells entirely 
became apparent.
More deep changes of destructive nature may be observed in case of high temperatures 
(+40°C), which have an influence on leaves complementary to drought. In this case for all the 
varieties being studied significant and almost irreversible functional changes of plastid struc-
tures are noted. These functional changes show in sharp decrease of CFI intensity.
Disastrous changes of life activity of vine leaf cells which take place during these proc-
esses show in oppression of biosynthetic processes, intensive decomposition of cytoplasmic 
structures and intensification of oxide catabolism of plant cell’s content. The consequence of 
these processes is decrease of CFI intensity as a result of its oxidizing transformation.
In the Fig. 5.30 there are shown the diagrams of measuring of chlorophyll fluorescence 
intensity for vine plants (sort Kober 5BB) during 5 months. The vine plants were under 
drought influence and normal conditions.
Thus, a water deficit shows up on the Kautsky curve as difference of fluorescence (FP—F0) 
decrease. The most credible reason of this is oppression of oxygen emission which is related 
with slowing down of electrons transfer. Assuming that F0 almost does not change for the

test and control plants, in a maximum point the chlorophyll fluorescence intensity value can 
define the level of water deficit.
In Figs. 5.31–5.33 there are some results of researches for detecting of water deficit of 
plants, which were executed by means of portable device “Floratest” in the National scien-
tific centre “Institute of viticulture and wine-making named after V.Ye. Tairov” of National 
academy of agrarian sciences of Ukraine.
Together with Megalopolis Ecomonitoring and Biodiversity Research Center of National 
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, experimental researches of portable device “Floratest” were 
carried out to detect influence of heavy metals and harmful substances (e.g. lead, sodium, 
chlorine etc.) in leaf and soil on the plants state in Kiev. Today long-term phytomonitoring

methods are used. They consist of visual observations and chemical analysis of soils and 
plant fragments and needs complicated equipment and lasts for more than one week.
Long duration and complexity of existing methods of heavy metals and harmful sub-
stances detecting in alive plants and necessity to involve skilled specialists to perform these 
researches set necessary conditions to develop special diagnostic methods and tools for this 
aim. Preliminary researches indicate that portable device “Floratest” can be used for detect-
ing of heavy metals and harmful substances influence on state of plants by measuring of CFI 
curve. The form of CFI curve changes versus level of harmful substances influence.
Joint researches were carried out in Kiev green regions by means of common phytomoni-
toring methods and portable device of “Floratest” family. After processing of the research 
result, the relations were built for searching correlations between chlorine content in trees’ 
leaf, which are got by common phytomonitoring methods (Fig. 5.34), and readouts of port-
able device of “Floratest” family (Fig. 5.35).
Even one can see some dependence between chlorine content in trees’ leaf and readouts 
of portable device “Floratest” (stationary segment of CFI curve) in Fig. 5.34 and Fig. 5.35. 
Calculations, made by mathematical methods, show certain correlations between these val-
ues. Such researches were made for other harmful substances, such as sodium, magnesium.
It is easily to concede that CFI curve form expresses not only contents of separate harmful 
substance, but general state of tree versus influence level of harmful substances.
5.8 DISTRIBUTED DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM
Development of electronics and telecommunication technologies causes creating and imple-
mentation of electronic data acquisition systems with remote gathering of measured data 
in many areas of human activity. Such systems include smart sensors, communication lines, 
transmitters and receivers, central control stations, which gather and accumulate information.
Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine the precision farming technology without such an 
important element as decision-making and agrotechnological operation generating system. 
Data from system of primary sensors, placed directly on agricultural fields, can be used as 
a basis for decision making. Quality and completeness of data acquisition determine the 
correctness of decision making about implementation of necessary agrotechnological opera-
tions for harvest increasing and costs reducing.
It is necessary to note that functional possibilities of decision-making system in precision 
farming are determined significantly by quantity, quality and frequency of data acquisition 
from fields and data processing. In general form the upper level of decision-making system in 
precision farming is shown in Fig. 5.36.
The union of mobile and traditional data acquisition technologies, database of agricul-
tural fields and software for knowledge formalization and knowledge presentation can be

Independent devices and wireless sensor networks for agriculture and ecological 127
named as the base agrotechnology. So the next part of this system, namely unit for generation 
and optimization of agrotechnologies, can be named as the adaptive agrotechnology.
Meteorological data, information about soil state and, not less importantly, information 
about state of plants, can be referred to data which are acquired directly on the field.
Therefore, acquisition of live and objective data of plant cover state in most cases is very 
important factor, which causes future strategy of keeping agricultural lands and proper deci-
sion making. Certainly, it would be ideal to obtain information about improvement or wors-
ening of plant cover state beforehand, but not after the event. It lets to avoid increasing costs 
and save harvest from possible loss.
As it is shown in Fig. 5.36, the mobile and traditional data acquisition technologies play an 
important role in precise farming as primary data sources. For this aim, wireless data acquisi-
tion system which obtains information about plant state on large territories of agricultural 
fields, woodlands or parklands in real-time (Palagin et al. 2011a) is developed in V.M. Glush-
kov Institute of Cybernetics of NAS of Ukraine.
As a sensor to obtain information about a plant state, in such system we use tiny wireless 
sensors and portable wireless devices of “Floratest” family (Palagin et al. 2011b), which were 
developed by us. We used portable device of “Floratest” family, which is shown in Fig. 5.3, as 
the first version of data acquisition unit.
Field testing devices of “Floratest” family, including in agrarian farming of Germany, 
showed some restrictions of its application. The data reading from one plant lasted for some 
minutes. But monocultures are growing in large agricultural areas and due to get data from 
these areas for crop monitoring, it is necessary to make thousands of measurements. For this 
purposes, there are dozens of the devices and large service staff of high-level skill needed.
To develop technology of prompt estimation of plant state based on CFI method for 
precision farming it was designed and prepared for serial production remote smart  wireless

 biosensors with embedded radio transceiver. The functional scheme of tiny biosensor is 
shown in Fig. 5.37.
Before designing a tiny the tin tensor, there were several requirements imposed:
1. long-term autonomous work,
2. reliability of data sending and receiving,
3. a large communication range,
4. small size and weight,
5. resistance to climate influence.
During preparing tiny biosensors to serial production, all the requirements were complied.
In most cases, the efficiency of data acquisition system work is defined by level of used 
technologies of data acquisition and data transmission medium. With increasing system 
scale, the contribution of these components in total efficiency of data acquisition system 
increases too. So, first of all, it is important to choose a technology of data transmission. 
Analysis of data transmission technologies showed that it is the most optimal to create such 
a data acquisition system on the basis of a wireless network with mobile terminals, which use 
existing mobile communication systems. In most cases it is unnecessary to issue the license 
on radiofrequency channel using and buy expensive transmission and receiving equipments.
In developed data acquisition system smart portable devices are used as mobile tools for 
data acquisition in any country region. Measured data from portable devices are transmitted 
to central control station, where these data are processed, analyzed and generalized. Collected 
results are offered in graphic, tabular or another form and then used for building generalized 
map of some region state. Map of state defines, for example, plant cover state of agricultural 
lands, ecological state, existence of plant diseases etc. on some territory or the whole country.
In our opinion, the main disadvantage of such a system is the following: if you want to 
change or implement new applied calculation methods, you need to reprogram all the mobile 
portable devices “Floratest”.
Example of the structure organization of the developed data acquisition system is shown 
in Fig. 5.38.
To remove this disadvantage, we are developing new data acquisition system, which has 
significant differences from the previous one. Principle of such a system operation is as fol-
lowing. The portable devices “Floratest” measure plant state without any data processing. 
Then user defines the examined medium (e.g. plant sort) and “raw data” are transmitted to

server. Taking into account the type of the examined medium, the server will process these 
“raw data” by means of specific calculation method. Having necessity to alter or develop new 
applied calculation methods, we will simply put a new applied calculation method on the 
server or replace the existing one.
Typical structure of such developed data acquisition system with applied calculation 
methods on server is shown in Fig. 5.39. Such a data acquisition system gives us significant 
advantages:
1. it is unnecessary to alter or reprogram the portable devices “Floratest” in case of changing 
applied calculation methods;
2. there are no embedded applied methods, so it simplifies hardware and software of the 
portable device “Floratest” and reduces the price;
3. automatic operation of portable device on the examined medium without specialist inter-
ference is possible;
4. large flexibility of the modernization of existing and developing new applied calculation 
methods.
5.9 WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK
Modern achievements in microelectronics and information and communication technologies 
after detailed analysis show possibility of creating wireless sensor network for express-diagnos-
tics of state of plants on large territories with using the same effect of chlorophyll fluorescence 
induction, on which the operation of the devices of “Floratest” family is based on. Application 
of sensors for measuring additional parameters of air and soil in sensor network gives possibil-
ity to measure in indirect method not only the general state of plant, but also such parameters 
as pesticides content in soil, water and plants, level of soil corrosion, level of pollution in air etc.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applied for our problem has to meet requirements of 
typical sensor network for application in agriculture and environmental protection. Devel-
opment of wireless sensor network depends on many factors, including failure-resistance, 
scaling, manufacture cost, type of operational environment, topology of sensor network, 
hardware restrictions, data transferring model, energy consumption etc. Schemes for initial 
placing of nodes of sensor network have to meet requirements of cost reducing of installa-
tion, removing necessary of preliminary planning of placing schemes, improving flexibility 
of node placing, and assisting self-organization and failure-resistance. Nodes of our wireless 
sensor network are deployed in a static mode.
Since nodes of sensor network sometimes fail because of battery discharge or physical 
impacts, the structure of sensor network has to change its topology very often after the sen-
sor network has been deployed. Changes of topology cause modification of characteristics 
of network nodes, notably location, accessibility (because of noise, moving obstacles etc.), 
battery charge, failures, changing of node functions in the network. There is specified pos-
sibility to include additional nodes in the sensor network for replacement of non-working 
nodes or expansion of network or network functions.
The proposed wireless sensor network covers the large territory of crop, woodlands or parklands 
and microelectronic sensors with radio channel are situated directly on the leaves of plants. Every 
sensor includes transceiver and it makes it possible to join separate sensors to sensor network.
Development of wireless sensor network for precision farming and environmental moni-
toring was started from development of certain node of such network. As the basis, a typical 
architecture of such node was used, which includes several basic units: data acquisition unit, 
data processing unit, transceiver and supply unit (Akyildiz et al. 2002). Presence of addi-
tional units depends on application task of wireless sensor network. Such units, as GPS unit, 
power generator and mobilizer can be considered as additional elements. Data acquisition 
unit, as a rule, includes sensor and ADC.

The functional scheme of network node is shown in Fig. 5.40 and node itself is shown in 
Fig. 5.41.
According to the functional diagram of the wireless node, the sensor includes proper opti-
cal sensor to convert induction of chlorophyll fluorescence into an electrical signal, micro-
electronic circuit of microcontroller JN5168, keeping ADC, proper microcontroller and 
transceiver, and power supply. In this microcontroller electrical signal is converted into the 
digital code. The code is formatted to passing it to remote mobile computer.
The data processing from every node is executed with network coordinator. To perform 
additional calculation, the network coordinator includes separate microcontroller. Accord-
ing to analysis of performances of microcontrollers we selected 32-bit floating-point micro-
controller Cortex-M4  LPC4357 of Cortex-M family, designed by ARM Company, and 
 manufactured by NXP Company. In addition to this, microcontroller includes analog-to-
digital and digital-to-analog converters for input/output analog signals.

Designing WSN engineers have to pay attention to important aspects: in-network data 
handling and organization of communication between network nodes. Data handling 
includes development of sensor interfaces, data acquisition, data compression, and data 
aggregation, data processing, decision-making and report forming. Organization of com-
munication between network nodes includes adjustment of wireless modules, network syn-
chronization, planning MAC-protocols, topology control, strategy of network relations, and 
common organization of data dissemination.
On a physical layer according to the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, there are three frequency 
bands for WSN operation: channel in 868 MHz frequency band, ten channels in 915 MHz 
frequency band and sixteen channels in 2,4 GHz frequency band for industrial and medical 
purposes. As a rule, the minimum required power for transmitting a signal over a distance 
d, is proportional to dn. The variable n is between 2 and 4 and depends on the transmission 
environment. In most cases, the antenna in WSNs is placed near ground and thus the vari-
able n normally equals 4 (Pottie and Kaiser 2000). For bands with higher frequencies, this 
variable n mainly depends on possibility of line-of-sight path. Usage of signal multi-hop 
relay from node to node in most cases simplifies the problem of line-of-sight path, because 
most of the nodes are separated by a short path.
For designing pilot elements of WSN, the wireless microcontroller JN5168 manufactured 
by NXP Company was chosen. Microcontroller includes 32-bit processor with 1–32 MHz 
clock speed, 2.4 GHz IEEE802.15.4 compliant transceiver, 4-input 10-bit ADC and a com-
prehensive mix of analogue and digital peripherals etc. This microcontroller complies with 
the network nodes requirements. It supports data acquisition, data storage and data transfer-
ring via a wireless channel.
The standardization and unification requirements for WSN are determined by 802.15.4 stand-
ard, which defines features of networks with low data throughput. In additional ZigBee and 
JenNet-IP, protocols determine requirements to network routing and security.
The JenNet-IP protocol combines IEEE802.15.4-based wireless network technology and 
the Internet Protocol (IP) to achieve integration between the two domains, supporting the 
wireless “Internet of Things”. Due to the nodes of a wireless network are to be controlled 
both wirelessly and from IP-connected device, such as a smart remotely located phone.
Topology control layer supports the determination of data transfer energy consumption for 
certain units and type of communication of such units. As a rule, the minimum transmission 
delay in the network has to be reached for minimum energy consumption. Optimal selection 
of in-network data transfer protocol lets to get optimal ratio of above mentioned parameters.

On the initial development stages for proposed tasks, using of a simple tree-like topology 
of WSN was proposed. The part of WSN topology, which was created as a base fragment 
(cluster) of the network, is shown in Fig. 5.42.
5.10 MULTILEVEL SENSOR NETWORK
It is important to note that proposed WSN is planned to be a part of a multilevel sensor net-
work, which operates with usage of “cloud” technologies. The multilevel sensor network is 
intended for a prompt diagnose a of plant state, knowledge base filling and managerial deci-
sion making. The network includes following elements: wireless sensor network as primary 
data acquisition system, knowledge bases of current and normal (reference) states of plants, 
processor for managerial decision making and user interface.
The functional diagram of the proposed multilevel sensor network is shown in Fig. 5.43. 
Knowledge base contains information on state of different plants in normal climatic condi-
tions, acceptable deviations of these conditions, and means for compensation of influence of 
external stress factors and etc. Knowledge base is filled in a real-time mode with information 
of current changes of state of plants or trees that were caused by stress factors of natural or 
anthropogenic origin. Information of a plant state is formed by means of the wireless sensor 
network. Nodes of this wireless sensor network are placed directly on the plant or tree leaves.
Processor of multilevel network works in “cloud” environment, which improves the results 
of managerial decision making during fast changes of knowledge of current state of plant 
under climatic changes and anthropogenic impacts. The processor operation provides  handling 
of different agrotechnical situations and actions for decision making (Kryvonos 2009). User 
interface is developed as web-interface, what ensures the interaction with different types of data 
and knowledge and gives the possibility to adopt such an interface with the user requirements.
So plant state data are passed from wireless sensor network to the next level of the multi-
level network. The managerial decision “to water or not to water”, or “to fertilize or not to fer-
tilize”, “to add herbicide or not” and so on is determined with data processing. It is expected 
that database is permanently replenished with new data of stress factor influence on the plant 
state, the processors of cloud system generates a managerial decision in real time and user of 
Web-interface supports the filling of database from different information providers.

INTRODUCTION
The threats that will be most challenging in the future are connected with synergistic interac-
tions between risks of various origins. There are constellations of interconnected risks within 
a community described as a “risk envelope” (Wilkinson et al. 2003). That is why our regula-
tory focus moves from managing point sources and risk in isolation to one of managing and 
trading risks from multiples sources and interdependencies of ecological, economic, social 
and technogenic risks.
The cumulative effects of various stressors emanating from multiple sources become 
important dangerous generators of uncertainty and instability in modern society. Indeed, 
interdependencies of various risks increase the difficulty of identifying the principal cause of 
injurious effects and make system already weakened by stress more susceptible to the effects 
of additional stressors.
One of the most significant indicators of system’s security is adaptiveness to various 
impacts, the ability of a system to change their internal structure in convenience with envi-
ronmental changes due to mutation or activation of internal systemic transformations. The 
main forces driving these transformations are dependent on the energy support.
The stress response is also associated with the mobilization of energy to enable the system 
to deal with threat or danger. However, energy cannot be diverted in all directions simultane-
ously, so in the case of cumulative stressors takes place the nonlinear increasing of system’s 
vulnerability and decreasing of its adaptive possibilities. These nonlinearities lead to arising 
of areas of system parameters values that are often characterized by unpredictable behaviors, 
when small impacts cause essential transformation of system’s security.
The rise of uncertainty and unpredictability is often connected with regimes when system 
shows sudden, discontinuous changes or phase transitions as a result of small, continuous 
changes in variables that influence the system.
Another reason of the essential increasing of rare events is caused by novel form of global 
challenges, resulting from wide range of asymmetric threats, high susceptibility to initial con-
ditions, strengthening destroy power of rare events, increased possibilities that some minor 
disturbances can cascade into a disaster with unpredictable ecological, economic and politi-
cal consequences.
The deformation of security’s area causes the crisis of control systems and decreases the 
horizon of forecasting for extreme events. The modern society can be considered as an open, 

136 Recent advances in information technology
non-Hamiltonian, non-linear, dissipative, potential, self-reproducing, self-organizing system 
with networking elements, near an unstable steady state far from equilibrium, in bifurcation 
zone where any fluctuation leads to an unpredictable future.
Traditional methods of risk analysis often are not enough efficient for such events when 
system is very susceptible to initial conditions and its behavior shows sudden, discontinuous 
changes or phase transitions as a result of small, continuous changes in variables that influ-
ence the system. Indeed, as pointed in (Wilkinson et al. 2003, p. 388), “risk management tools 
designed on the assumption that historical variability and existing trends are relevant to future 
context are likely to be increasingly challenged by growing interdependencies of environmen-
tal, technological, social and economic hazards”. The unique and single character of rare 
events makes it difficult to use correctly the theory of probability for proper risk assessment.
Moreover, it should be noted that traditional model-based assessments have unavoidable 
uncertainties linked to underlying model assumptions and available input data. Furthermore, 
globalization leads to more complex and interconnected network of modernized society, includ-
ing its ecological component. The behavior of such complex system sometimes becomes unstable 
and shows sudden, discontinuous changes or phase transitions as a result of small, continu-
ous changes in variables that influence the system. Small causes can lead to large consequences 
and generate chaotic oscillations of vulnerability, since the amplifications of global change play 
important role in appearance of the supported chaotic regimes of environmental variables.
How can we decrease the degree of uncertainty in forecasting of environmental dynam-
ics? The “integrated” global models for sustainable management of the environment are not 
efficient for systems with high susceptibility to initial conditions, for which some minor dis-
turbances can cascade into a disaster with unpredictable ecological consequences. The new 
risks demand new methods for their assessment.
In (Atoyev 2015, Atoyev 2007, Atoyev 2001, Atoyev, Tomin and Aksionova 2007) a deci-
sion support for investigation of interconnected risks with the help of catastrophes theory, 
theory of chaos and bifurcation is proposed. It increases our possibilities in the field of 
systemic risk analysis and management. The main advantage of this approach is a determina-
tion of risk as a function of dynamic variables of the investigated system.
The developed approach may be applied to a wide range of different complex systems 
from following disciplines:
1. ecology (assessment of environmental vulnerability, global change impact, reducing water 
stress and optimal water resource management);
2. epidemiology (estimation of HIV/AIDS sharp escalation for management of epidemics 
and risk ranking);
3. biology (healthcare, cellular energetic trigger, metabolic and hormonal regulation);
4. psychology (formation of attitude, mutual penetration of west and orient worldview 
matrices and terrorism);
5. sociology (deformation of social risk’s fields).
6.1 GLOBAL CHANGE AS MAIN GENERATORS OF NEW RISKS
6.1.1 The main reasons of reducing efficiency of forecasting under the global changes
The disaster on the Japanese nuclear power plant Fukushima has focused attention on the 
crisis of modern control systems. This crisis is manifested in reduction of forecasting horizon 
and impossibility of rare events prediction, such as the Chernobyl disaster, the hurricane 
Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the synergy effect 
of earthquake and hurricane in Japan in 2011, the world financial crisis, and the geopolitical 
destabilization in some Muslim countries in 2012.
The frequency of emergencies and the scale of corresponding losses appeared essentially 
larger than it was predicted by forecasting methods based on the traditional approaches of risk

analysis. Reducing efficiency of modern forecasting and risk control systems is explained, first 
of all, by the global changes causing the general instability of contemporary World. The unique, 
accidental character of turbo-events passes away while non-homogeneity and non-uniformity 
become an ordinary attribute of information society. The turbulent character of life causes new 
risks. That is why our times were named as “epoch of bifurcation time” (Laszlo 1993).
Creating a complex network of modern society strengthens the fields of technogenic, eco-
nomic, and environmental risks. It is explained by such features of modern society as the 
increased density of links among network nodes and the increased speed of circulations of 
tangible and intangible assets throughout the network. The network nodes can play the role 
of special acupunctural points of society vulnerability, in which small disturbances may lead 
to essential divergences of system development trajectories, unpredictable in their scale conse-
quences, increases of future uncertainty. The functioning of such complex systems is becom-
ing unstable and characterizing by discontinuous changes in their behavior. The blackouts of 
power systems in the USA and Western Europe (2003–2011) give examples of that instability of 
technogenic systems, whereas the financial crisis and political crisis in the Arab World in 2012 
provide examples of the instability of social-economic systems. Therefore, a network society 
can be viewed as a system around the fragile steady state in bifurcation zone under increasing 
probability of rare and unpredictable events. Very small fluctuations may lead to sudden discon-
tinuous changes of social-economic and environmental-technogenic characteristics of society.
The common feature of such systems is a strong dependence on initial conditions. The 
increasing role of small impacts extends the action areas of traditional risks and generates the 
principally new risks. These risks are related with the events of tremendous destructive power, 
which are characterized by their large duration and transboundary impact when the conse-
quences of technogenic and natural disasters are visible in the territories which are located far 
away from the emergency source. Research of system behavior around the fragile steady state 
in bifurcation zone is facing the principal difficulties reducing the efficiency of forecasting.
The first reason of those difficulties is due to a number of new risks. Tools of probability 
theory are efficient if representative samples are available. The higher degree of risk novelty, 
the lower quality of decision making as a unique character of event presumes absence or 
incompleteness of statistical data. New methods for risk estimation should be developed in 
order to take into account the new risk nature under the global changes.
The second reason is due to power law of probability density function for losses and causali-
ties under natural disasters during global changes. Large deviations (from the expected value 
for losses and causalities) can be neglected if probability density function is Gaussian (normal). 
But many disasters generate statistics described by power law probability distribution where 
large deviations cannot be neglected. The power law distribution has the following feature: the 
losses at only event may exceed the sum of losses at the rest of events within the sample.
During the past decade, we have witnessed novel form of global challenges, resulting from 
wide range of asymmetric threats, strengthening destroy power of a renewed focus on events, 
increased possibilities that some minor disturbances can cascade into a disaster with unpre-
dictable ecological, economic and political consequences. Short list of different generators of 
new risks in web society includes following items:
1. increasing role of social amplification of threats;
2. existence of longer-term links and a great extent of causal chains;
3. increasing role of systemic risks;
4. increasing geographic concentration of wealth, human capital, knowledge and communi-
cation links;
5. progress in communications and information processing.
Uncertainty and principle unpredictability has become the keywords characterizing vari-
ous aspects of global change. The deformation of global security causes the crisis of control 
systems, leads to sharp increasing of environmental and man-made disasters, financial and 
economic catastrophes and decreases the horizon of forecasting for extreme events, especially 

138 Recent advances in information technology
when probability density function of destroy power is described by power low. Its curve 
decreases more slowly than Gaussian probability low (Fig. 6.1). 
The GC (as pointed by F. Capra (2002)), can be considered as a giant web, which consists 
of fractal networks where any network contains another one. The quickly changing world 
with its instability and jumps to new forms of the organizations is a good example of Pri-
gogine’s theory of dissipative structures (Prigogine and Stengers 1984). These instabilities 
appear to be a result of fluctuations amplified by positive long-term feedback loops. The 
amplifications of GC play important role in appearance of the supported chaotic environ-
mental and social regimes of global flows.
GC plays an important role in arising of new risk. One of the typology of new risks has been 
proposed by O. Renn (2003). These risks fall into five main categories: 1) psychosomatic risks, 
2) system breakdown risks, 3) systemic risks, 4) knowledge management risks, 5) global change 
risks. The others new taxonomies of risks also include risks resulting from: 1) homogenization 
of infectious diseases; 2) occurrence of a new pathogens (AIDS, Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease); 3) over–
prescription of antibiotics; 4) advances of functional genomics, DNA technologies, genetic and 
protein engineering and genetically modified food and insidious risks, which emerge slowly but 
surely over time (Wilkinson et al. 2003, p. 386); 5) terrorist threat; 6) mental inadaptation of 
personality connected with atomization of society and increased social volatility. The hacker-
type risks, and transboundary risks also are included in new taxonomies of risks.
Climate change is another enormous global threat. Various scenarios of Intergovernmen-
tal Panel of Climate Changes indicate some possibility of irreversible catastrophic effects 
that could wipe a great part of the world population due to global warming. Moreover, the 
climate changes cause the disturbances of traditional biogeocoenosis that change the routes 
of transmigration of birds of passage. One of possible consequences of these processes is 
expansion of the avian influenza (“bird flu”).
The next group of new risk is subjective risk associated with prospect theory. One very 
important result of Kahneman and Tversky work is demonstrating that people’s attitudes 
toward risks concerning gains may be quite different from their attitudes toward risks con-
cerning losses (Kahnemann and Tversky 1972). A. Boholm has proposed to separate this phe-
nomenon as the subjective component of risk. “Subjective risk acknowledges that people’s 
beliefs and opinions tend to deviate from such scientific assessments. People understand and 
judge risks in terms of locally defined values and concerns” (Wilkinson et al. 2003, p. 371).

Subjective risk can be examined as an additional powerful source of sharp escalation of man-
made mistakes and unpredictability of human behavior which decrease security.
So, the transformation of security is carried out in space with principle new features caused 
by globalization and increasing uncertainty. The changing of fundamental characteristics of 
time-space continuum generates the fields of new risks, leads to more unpredictable world, 
increases the degree of global mega threats (atomic, genetic, chemical, mental, environmen-
tal) and their damage. Moreover, the revolution in quality of communication links, necessity 
of fast solutions and increasing role of psychological factors for decision making under the 
face of uncertainty also transform area of security.
New risks demand new methods for their assessment. That is why the theories of defense 
planning, psychological and synergetic economics, theory of catastrophes took one of the 
central places for risk analysis in era of uncertainty (Klinke and Renn 2002). Adaptiveness 
describes the ability of a system to transform their internal structure in response on envi-
ronmental changes. It has become one of the most significant characteristics of sustainable 
development of system.
The main objective of current investigations is to strengthen the capacity in such fields as 
impact of uncertainty caused by Global Change (GC) on transformation of security and sus-
tainability of complex systems for which standard modeling methods and tools are inadequate. 
The work includes following tasks: 1) to develop the advanced modeling method to investigate 
regimes with sudden, discontinuous changes or phase transitions from one level of security to 
another; 2) to determine the complex system’s vulnerability to small fluctuations; 3) to calcu-
late the optimal controls, minimizing the decreasing of security; 4) to investigate the possible 
mechanisms of chaotic behavior arising that cause the instability of complex systems.
6.1.2  Development of the advanced modeling method to investigate regimes with sudden, 
discontinuous changes or phase transitions of complex system’s security
In (Atoyev 2007, Atoyev, Tomin and Aksionova 2007) it was developed the modeling method 
for risk assessment on the basis of mathematical formalism for modeling nonlinear systems 
whose discontinuous behavior is determined by smooth changes in a few driving param-
eters—catastrophe theory (CT) (Thom 1975). CT has been applied to a wide range of differ-
ent systems from physics, engineering, biology, psychology, and sociology. A small subset of 
specific phenomena that were analyzed and modeled using CT includes quantum morpho-
genesis, the formation of caustics in ray optics, the stability of ships, the stability of black 
holes, the surface changes in interatomic potential, Euler struts, the size of bee societies, mor-
phogenesis or cell differentiation in embryology, bistability of perception, binocular vision, 
motor learning, sudden transitions in attitudes, and the cognitive development of children 
(Poston and Stewart 1978). In all these applications, the behavior of the system under study 
shows sudden, discontinuous changes or phase transitions as a result of small, continuous 
changes in variables that influence the system (cf. the freezing of water when temperature is 
gradually decreased or the collapse of a bridge under slowly mounting pressure). In general, 
CT applies to systems that may respond to continuous changes in control variables by a dis-
continuous change from one equilibrium state to another.
Let us propose that complex system satisfies all the requirements of potential system and 
can be described by potential function U(x, A1, A2, …, AN) of the behavioral variable x and 
control variables Ai. The dynamics of deterministic gradient system are described by a dif-
ferential equation of the form:

(6.1)
Equation (6.1) implies that variable x changes in the direction of decreasing potential at a 
rate proportional to the slope or gradient of the potential field. The equilibrium manifold of 
this system is the set of values x such that dx

These parameters control both a movement of system’s current position upon surface U, and 
transformations of the surface itself.
The probability of sudden and unexpected transformation from one steady state to another 
may be determined using the theory of catastrophes allowing the calculation of bifurcation 
values, curves and surfaces of control parameters. The probability of transformation is esti-
mated as an extent of a control parameter approaching these bifurcation values character-
izing system’s transition from one steady state (norm) to another (catastrophe).
It is possible to determine the quantity of steady states of system on the basis of initial 
data set analysis. Let us propose that this analysis shows that investigated complex system 
has three stable steady states. To make it simple, it is possible to put forward following sup-
positions. The first stable steady state characterizes normal condition. The level of x in this 
state is minimal. The second one characterizes state with a medium level of x. The third one 
characterizes crisis with high level of x. Under this supposition, the potential function U is 
described by equation (6.2).
There are many ways in which society is changing. Four key forces that are driving GC 
were identified in (Wilkinson et al. 2003). They are increasing global connectivity, the atomi-
zation of society, rapidly advancing technology and growing ability to measure and moni-
tor. To examine a GC impact problem, we also have chosen a 4-dimensional typology. The 
transformations of security are defined by one of the universal deformations of catastrophes’ 
theory—a “butterfly”:

where Ai (i = 1,4) are control parameters, characterizing various aspects of the GC impacts 
on economic, social, environmental and technogenic dimensions of sustainable development: 
i = 1 – index of global connectivity (economic index), determined by the powerful forces 
of economic globalization, market liberalization and economic possibilities to prevent and 
minimize consequences of disaster; i = 2 – index of atomization of society (social index), 
determined by factors that provoke the rise of violence, mental disadaptation of personality, 
probability of epidemics and reinforce the notions of individual ability, identity, freedom and 
responsibility; i = 3 – index of ability to measure and monitor (index of natural disasters), 
determined by ecological and climatic factors that impact on probability of natural disaster 
and man’s growing ability to observe and analyze his environment, i = 4 – index of advancing 
technologies (index of man-made disasters), determined by factors that impact on develop-
ment of technologies, educing of their lifespan and increasing of their disasters.
The projections of bifurcation surfaces on planes of natural and man-made disasters A3A4 
are presented in Fig. 6.2. Changes of each variable characterizing parameters Ai are used as 
control effects. The characterizing point, corresponding to current state of system (circle) 
had begun moving from small level of natural disaster’s index (parameter A3)  under constant 
levels of parameters A1 and A2 (Fig. 6.2a).
The increasing of A3  decreases distance to bifurcation surface that separates norm and pre-
catastrophe (Fig. 6.2b). A small impacts connected with increasing of man-made disaster’s index 
(parameter A4) when system parameters balance at the boundaries of their bifurcation values lead 
to transformation the system state from norm to pre-catastrophe (Fig. 6.3c). Further increasing 
of stressors leads to new transformation from pre-catastrophe to catastrophe (Fig. 6.2d).
The risk estimation of sudden and unexpected transformation from one steady state to 
another may be performed using the theory of catastrophes allowing the calculation of

bifurcation values, curves and surfaces of control parameters. The risk is estimated as an 
extent of a control parameter approaching these bifurcation values characterizing system’s 
transition from one steady state (norm) to another (catastrophe). The main advantage of this 
approach is a determination of risk as a function of dynamic variables of the investigated 
system. It also allows identifying the weakest link of the system under examination and the 
areas in need of an improvement.
The following algorithm of risk assessment can be proposed:
1. The collection of information characterizing the above-mentioned indices input from 
contemporary databases.
2. Determination of indices characterizing appropriate group of parameters calculation by 
means of developed mathematical models using inputted data.
3. Calculation of the bifurcation parameters values at which the number of system steady 
states change.
4. Estimation of restoration possibilities of each considered systems by the remoteness of 
the parameter characterizing appropriate index from its bifurcation value.

Relationship shifts within complex system may cause transfers from norm to pre-crisis or to 
crisis. Bifurcation values of these parameters can be calculated by means of proposed math-
ematical method. Reaching such critical values abruptly increases the probability of a transfer 
from one functional state to another. Thus, for a given state of global system, it is possible to 
determine ranges of functional parameter values corresponding to the states of norm, pre-
crisis and crisis. The main advantage of this approach is the determination of risk dynamics 
as the function of dynamic variables connected with complex system. It also allows identify-
ing the weakest link of the system under examination and the areas in need of improvement.
Several authors have developed statistical methods to fit catastrophe models. Guastello’s 
polynomial regression technique uses reverse hierarchical entry (entering higher order terms 
first) in computing the regression equation and compares the model with two alternative 
linear regression models (Guastello 1998). Lange, Oliva, and McDade (Lange et al. 2000) 
proposed a multivariate methodology for estimating catastrophe models and developed a 
program called Gemcat II. It is claimed that the program can fit any of the catastrophe 
models to data. Cobb in (Cobb and Zacks 1985) developed a catastrophe fitting technique 
that is based on a stochastic interpretation of catastrophe theory. Taking into account all 
restrictions of above methods that were analyzed in (van der Maas et al. 2003) we choose the 
modification of Gemcat II to fit catastrophe model.
Fitting a catastrophe model to noisy data constitutes a serious challenge, however, because 
CT was formulated specifically for deterministic systems. Cobb (Cobb and Zacks 1985) has 
developed a stochastic version of catastrophe theory (SCT) based on Ito stochastic differen-
tial equations. In SCT, the stable and unstable equilibrium states of the system correspond 
to the modes and the antimodes of the empirical probability density function, respectively. 
Unfortunately, SCT is not invariant under smooth and invertible transformations of vari-
ables, this was an important limitation, since invariance to diffeomorphic transformations is 
essential in deterministic catastrophe theory.
Wagenmakers et al. (2005) have generalized the Cobb’s method by taking into account the Ito 
transformation rule. In contrast to the Cobb’s method, this generalized SCT is unaffected by 
smooth and invertible transformations. It was shown that an invariant function is obtained by 
multiplying the probability density function with the diffusion function of the stochastic proc-
ess. This invariant function can be estimated by a straightforward time series analysis based on 
level crossings. So, there are no serious restrictions for application of this theory to noisy data.
6.2 COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS
6.2.1  Application of catastrophe theory to wide range of scientific disciplines for 
investigation of complex systems instability
Various models are currently available to describe the interrelationship among the parameters 
of complex ecological—economics systems (Atoyev et al. 2013, Korotayev and Tsirel 2010, 
Magnitskii and Sidorov 2006, Moiseev et al. 1985, Myasnikov 2011, Puu 2000, Wagenmakers 
et al. 2005, Zhang 2005). Excessive level of detail in these models is the “price” we pay for try-
ing to adopt model to a specific database relevant to the user. It is necessary to select a small 
number of generalized parameters that would make it possible to investigate the behavior of 
a system in a control space of limited number of dimensions. Methods of catastrophe theory 
have been applied for this purpose in (Atoyev 1999, Sergienko et al. 1997). All the parameters 
are divided into three groups: recreational parameters X that characterize the renewability 
of natural resources; load parameters Z that characterize the pollution of the environment; 
and reserve parameters R that depend on the resources of the ecological—economic system.
The interrelationship between these parameters is described by universal deformation 
model of catastrophe theory (the cusp model):

where R0 – is the model parameter.
The model (6.4) has three stationary states. Two of them are stable, with high S1(X1,R1,Z1) 
and low S2(X2,R1,Z2) levels of recreational and ecological safety (Fig. 6.3).
Assume that initially the system is at point S1. As the level of pollution Z increases (path 1), 
the value of X declines, i.e., the recreational value and ecological safety decreases. However, 
it continues to be fairly high, and only slightly differ from X1. When the system reaches the 
lower boundary ZL1 of the trigger zone, where three stationary states exist, it moves into a 
zone of increased risk of ecological disaster. Farther increase of Z brings the system closer 
to the upper boundary ZH1 of the trigger zone. When the system crosses this boundary, the 
stationary state with a high level of recreational possibilities ceases to exist. The recreational 
potential the system abruptly falls to the level X2, which corresponds to an ecological disaster. 
To initiate recovery, the anthropogenic load must be reduced to the level ZL1.
Let us now consider the case when Z starts increasing from the point S3(X1,R2,Z1), corre-
sponding to lower system reserves. The boundary of the trigger zone is reached and ecologi-
cal disaster occurs in the case at a lower level of anthropogenic load on the ecosystem, ZH2. 
The amplitude of fall of the function X is also smacker (path 2). System recovery becomes 
possible at a higher level ZL2 than in the first case.
According to Shturm’s theorem, the cubic polynomial has one or three roots. Their number 
is depended on discriminant Δ = 4R3 + 27Z2. When Δ < 0 there are three real roots, when Δ > 0 
there is on real root. Δ(a, b) = 0 is the curve of bifurcation.
So the boundaries of trigger zone are described by following equation:

The measure of risk of an ecological disaster is provided by the proximity of the system 
parameters to the boundaries of trigger zone. The risk is defined as:

(6.6)
The variation over time of the anthropogenic load and ecosystem resources needed for cal-
culated the disaster risk by the proposed approach can be obtained using the existing models 
of ecological—economic systems (Cellier 2008, Marcuk 1986).
The formalization of interrelations in wide range of complex systems allows identifying 
the functions U(X,A). The classification of control parameters that are utilized for investiga-
tion of discontinuous behavior in ecology, epidemiology, biology, psychology and sociology 
is presented in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

6.2.2 Modelling of uncertainty and risk impact on food and economic fields
The concept of sustainable development becomes a dominant determining the paths of post-
industrial society transformation in the XXI century. The main idea of this concept consists 
in coordination of the changes in different dimensions (economic, environmental, social) of 
society functioning. The basic postulate of sustainable development, as confirmed by the 
UN summit “Rio+20”, is creation of conditions for social progress aimed to providing cer-
tain quality and safety for people lives, with simultaneous preserving environment, resources, 
and energy due to adoption of advanced technologies.
The achievement of the best social standards of life; the realization of successive policy for 
harmonization of basic factors influencing on social development; decrease of social inequality, 
corruption level, infant death rate; increase of life expectancy, political stability, civil liberties, is 
becoming a measure of success for society. However, substantial deformation of safety space, 
related with the global changes, becomes a basic challenge to sustainable development. Grow-
ing interdependence of the different dimensions of social vulnerability, wide spectrum of local, 
regional, transnational threats, expansion of dangerous technologies, deficit of water, food and 
energy resources, constantly growing load on the economy as a result of population aging, con-
tamination of environment create specific synergic effects and bring additional systemic risks.
Sustainable development of society assumes a reasonable balance between the activities, 
directed to an acceleration of economic growth, and efforts, directed to mitigate a negative 
impact of such activities on environment. This problem is of great importance in the sphere of 
agro-industrial production that is the most sensible pin zone in the system of reciprocal influ-
ence of economic and ecological interests of humanity. The problem of food security is getting 
extra importance due to the global climatic changes which substantially affect the agricultural 
productivity. The adaptation of agriculture to new climatic terms becomes the priority task.
Efficiency of solving the tasks mentioned above depends on the technological base to be 
implemented for problem solution. In addition to the changes, usually called global challenges, 
the transformation of technological modes (the transition from information to post-informa-
tion society) is beginning. Bio- and nano-technologies, robotics, new environmental manage-
ment, new high humanitarian technologies, related with human endowment and information 
load minimization for a decision maker, become the top directions of successful development.
Future designing, scientific monitoring, risk management will occupy the leading techno-
logical niches. The transformation of technological modes gives a unique chance of shortening

The mathematical problems of complex systems investigation under uncertainties 145
lags behind the leaders to such countries as Ukraine whose indices remain at the levels of 
pre-information epoch because the leaders are also forced to adopt the transformation. Thus, 
under decision making on sustainable development, it is necessary to take into account bifur-
cation character of a current historical moment, corridor of opportunities given by jumping 
to the post-information technological mode, and catastrophic consequences in the case of 
inertial scenario, when future development follows old-fashioned technologies.
All this requires elaboration of new methods and mechanisms for efficient prevention of 
potential risks to national interests and neutralization of available threats. The information 
systems, allowing solution of the risk management problems and investigation of global change 
impact on society, must be a core of such mechanisms. Solving this problem is not feasible with-
out development of efficient mathematical tools of risk estimation for agro-industrial produc-
tion and balanced use of food, water and energy resources under increased uncertainties caused 
by the global climatic changes.

The efficiency of modelling largely depends on finding a balance between model particu-
larity and simplicity. The more detailed model, the larger its scale and difficulty of input 
data collection, parameters identification, the more error of calculation, the less horizon 
of prediction. Moreover, a complex system is not simply a sum of its subsystems. However, 
without models detailed enough, it is hard to understand how the disturbances are spreading 
throughout the subsystems, how adaptations of some subsystems are influencing on activi-
ties of other subsystems, how self-organization mechanisms are forming complex social-eco-
nomic system as a whole. Without such models, finding the actual scenarios of development 
and evaluating the efficiency of particular management decisions are not feasible.
The large-scale problems often may be solved due to non-homogeneity of the model phase 
space. For some parts of the phase space, the state of system can be characterised satisfactory 
enough by a small group of variables comprising a small-scale projection. Other variables can 
be subordinated to the variables of projection (order parameters). Those other variables are 
not important from the viewpoint of system description within the given area of parameters. 
In general, the small-scale projections can be used in the bounded areas of phase space, while 
those projections are different for different areas.
The system behavior is unpredictable, complicated and sophisticated in the areas of phase 
space, where such small-scale projections and the corresponding methods of nonlinear 
dynamics are not plausible; then the methods of probability theory are used (Zulpukarov 
et al. 2006). Therefore, the combination of dynamic (Atoyev et al. 2014, Sergienko et al. 
1997) and stochastic (Atoyev et al. 2014, Ermoliev and von Vinterfeldt 2012, Knopov and 
Derieva 2013, Knopov and Korkhin 2012, Knopov and Pardalos 2009) models is applied 
to research of complex systems. The system behavior is investigated with support of the 
methods smooth and multi-valued mappings (Atoyev et al. 2007, Sergienko et al. 1997) in 
the cases when the probability methods become inefficient due to a unique character of the 
event.
Based on the abovementioned reasoning, construct a hierarchical model. The detailed 
models of food, water, energy, hydrogeology resources would be lower levels of the hierar-
chical model. In addition, the models already available can be used as well. The less detailed 
model of social, environmental and economic development will be a higher level of the hier-
archical model. The model of higher level defines the corridors of potential opportunities 
that are the strategies of development. The tactical tasks of development and the specific 
scenarios belong to the models of lower level.
The interdisciplinary methodology for research of complex systems, called “system dynam-
ics”, is a basis for building the model of social-economic development. A mathematical model 
of global dynamics has been proposed in (Forrester 1978) and modified in (Gelovani 1974)

Here P is the population; V is the capital stock; S is the share of assets in the agricultural

The various modifications of this methodology were applied to investigate social-environ-
mental-economic development for some countries and regions (Gelovani et al. 2005, Makhov, 
2007). In (Sergienko et al. 1997) it was proposed to assess the risk of ecological, economic 
and social disasters with the help of methodology that combines the dynamic modelling 
and catastrophe theory. The tabular functions BF, BZ, DP, DZ, SF, SQ were modified to allow 
for the effect of radioactive contamination on birth rate, mortality, the quality of food, and 
shutdown of some industrial enterprises and agricultural lands.
To allow for social factors it was assumed that the constants CB, CD, CR, CV, CZ, TS, TV also 
as the functions RM and TZ are tabular functions of social risk.
6.2.3 Minimum model of social risk assessment
The main factors affecting social vulnerability have been were identified with the help of 
regression analysis. One group of them can be changed by the government through real-
location of resources or adoption of legal measures (control of pensions, stipends, transfer 
payments, minimum wage, tax policy, etc.). Two factors from this group have been chosen 
for social risk determination: 1) the ratio between the cost of labor and productivity of labor 
(Y1); 2) the share of gross national product (GNP) for the poorest 20% of population (Y2). 
The ratio Y1 in the time interval (ti, ti+1) was defined as:

The functions Ik (k = P,V,R,Z), that described the sum of flows of variables into the system 
and into the environment, were introduced in the right-hand side of corresponding equations 
of model (6.7–6.14).
The effect of the social factor—the share of gross national product (GNP) for the poorest 
20% of population (YS) on formation and consumption of assess has been introduced by the 
following assumptions. The rate of asset formation is maximized for some optimal value of 
income distribution. Passage from this optimal distribution to a more “egalitarian” distribu-
tion reduces the incentives to work, because the quality of life becomes less dependent on the 
results of individual activity. As a consequence, the rate of asset formation decrease. Passage to 
an income distribution with a greater inequality (reduction of the proportion of income for the 
20% of the population) produces a similar effect. Indeed, starting from a certain moment, the 
intensification of labor will have reached its peak, as determined by physical and technologi-
cal constraints, and further increase of wages will not produce a corresponding increase in the 
productivity of labor. To increase the rate of asset formation in this case, we will need to create 
new jobs to attract an increasing number of workers (including persons from the poorest 20% 
of the population), who will also require adequate pay for their work. The simplest dependence 
describing this effect is a quadratic function, although more complex expressions can be used,

The mathematical statement of the problem has been formulated as follows: given is a 
system described by equations (6.5–6.14); it is required to solve the Cauchy problem on the 
time interval [0, T] for a given set of model parameters.
The model has been applied to solve the following problems: 1) prediction of the ecologi-
cal-economic situation and assessment of the risk of an ecological disaster; 2) calculation of 
the admissible anthropogenic load Zrisk (t) when the risk does not exceed a prespecified value 
given the actual level of system reserves; 3) calculation of the reserve level Rrisk (t) required to 
sustain a given level of risk for the actual anthropogenic load level.
The solution of the Cauchy problem produces the functions R(t), Z(t) and RISK(t) 
(Problem 1). Then the user-specified risk level and the curve R(t) (Problem 2) or Z(t) (Prob-
lem 3) are applied together with expressions (2) and (3) to calculate the functions Zrisk (t) 
or Rrisk (t).
The model (6.5–6.14) has been used in (Prigogine and Stengers 1984) to solve a number of 
problems for optimal allocation of funds with the object of minimizing the decrease of mate-
rial resources. The control variables are UR and UZ, which represent the proportion of funds 
allocated respectively to resource renewal and to antipollution measures; and US, which char-
acterizes the policy of investment in agriculture. The optimization problems are solved by the 
random search method. Single-criterion problems have been considered.
In (Sergienko et al. 1997) a multi-criterion optimal control problem has been considered. 
This problem maximizes the level of material production and the quality of life, on the one 
hand, while minimizing the risk and pollution level, on the other.
The problem of optimal risk management has been stated as follows: given is a mathemati-
cal model for risk assessment and prediction of consequences of ecological and technogenic 
disasters (6.1), subject to a system of constraints that define the admissible range of model 
variables and controls; it is required to find the controls control UR(t), US(t) and UZ(t) that 
minimize the functional:

The optimization problem has been solved by the random search method. Solution of opti-

The investigation of social, economic and environmental sustainable development to 
determine the scenarios of efficient food, energy and water use based on above mentioned 
methodology has been carried out in (Atoyev et al. 2014). A flowchart of the interlationships 
in the modified model (Sergienko et al. 1997) is shown in Fig. 6.4. 
The following additional indicators were used as the model variables: food (RF), water 
(RW) and energy (RE) resources; capital shares to provide material standards of living (UL) 
and restore food (URF), water (URW) and energy (URE) resources. The model also takes into 
account the parameters characterizing measure of vulnerability of society due to increasing 
uncertainty related with global changes (including climatic changes), migration of popula-
tion and transboundary flows of capitals, resources and pollutions.

The model parameters are determined on the basis of empirical data. Some of these 
parameters are viewed as functions of social risk dependent on the probability of sociogenic 
catastrophes (Moiseev et al. 1985). Computing the social risk is based on the following data: 
1) labour cost-productivity ratio; 2) differentiation level for total incomes of decile popula-
tion groups; 3) efficiency of state governance based on the GRICS (Governance Research 
Indicator Country Snapshot) index.
The results of modelling for one of region of Ukraine (Chernobyl zone) are presented 
in Fig. 6.5.
The circles denote the real data corresponding to the 1991–2010 samples for the Chernobyl 
zone. The curve 1 marks the solution for dynamic problem under initial values of parameters. 
The curve 2 marks the solution for identification task.
The results of solving optimal control are presented in Fig. 6.6. The model parameters 
have been determined on the basis of real data analysis as a result of solving the identifica-
tion tasks over the interval of years 1991–2010. The curve 1 corresponds to the dynamic 
problem, and the curve 2 – to the optimal control problem.
The ranking of Ukrainian regions by the levels of socio-economic and ecological-techno-
genic threats has been carried out on the basis of results obtained for all regions of Ukraine 
(Fig. 6.7). The highest levels of ecological threats, as demonstrate obtained results, are 
in Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Luhansk regions, the smallest—in Chernivtsy, Lviv and 
Zakarpattya regions. The highest levels of economic threats are in Kirovograd, Zakarpat-
tya ant Kyiv regions, the smallest—in Chernigiv, Volyn, Sumy, Rivne and Vinnitsia regions.
The highest level of technogenic threats are in Odesa, Volyn, Donetsk, Zaporizhya and 
Lviv regions, the smallest—in Rivne, Zhitomir, Khmelnitsky, Sumy and Vinnitsia regions. 
The highest level of social threats is in Luhansk, Donetsk, Volyn and Kirovograd regions, the 
smallest in Zakarpattya, Ivano-Frankivsk regions and Kyiv (Atoyev 1999).

The profile of threats was calculated for each region. The results for Mykolayv region are 
presented at Fig. 6.8. Mykolayv is classified as region of high threat level. The index of eco-
nomic threat A1 = 0.55 (22-d place).
The index of social threat A2 = 0.69 (8-th place). The index of technogenic threat A3 = 0.46 
(8-th place). The index of ecological threat A4 = 0.19 (12-th place). The integral index of 
removing to low threat level is equal to 0.437661 (3-d place among 9 regions of group with 
high level of threat). The ecological-technogenic component of this index is equal to 0.244434 
(3-d place). The social economic component is equal to 0.348658 (3-d place).
6.2.4 The decision support system for environmental security assessment
The decision support system for integrated security assessment and management has been 
elaborated. The distinctive feature of elaborated computer system is joining in technological 
gear software that allows the forecasting and optimization tasks solution that minimize the 
level of environmental risk. It allows calculating the optimal controls, minimizing the nega-
tive impacts of Global Changes on sustainable development. The impacts of man-made and 
natural disasters are investigated with the help of various mathematical models. The control 
board of computer system is presented in Fig. 6.9.
The ranking of 25 regions of Ukraine on a degree of environmental vulnerability (EV) and 
its technogenic, ecological, social and economic components was carried out. The projections 
of catastrophes on the surfaces of technogenic and ecological security are shown in the mid-
dle of Fig. 6.9.
The changing phase portraits that correspond to the dynamics of chosen environmental 
impacts, also as changing operating life at chosen load are presented at left part of Fig. 6.9.

Risk of transfer from one functional state into another (R) is determined as follows: R = Δ /

Calculation of optimum ways of security normalization is also based on the above method.

To solve optimization problem a modified random search method—statistical gradient 
method—was used. The choice of the method was caused by lack of analytical expression for 
objective function and by derivatives’ calculation complexity.
6.3 COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
An organism in contrast with a machine is a self-reproducing, self-organizing whole. According 
to (Capra 1996), the term “self-organization” as a definition of the nature of live organisms has 
been proposed by Immanuel Kant. The main contradiction of the current medicine appears

to be the fact that it attempts to treat not a patient but some organism subsystems, whereas 
an illness is a consequence of structural changes on molecular and subcellular levels. It is get-
ting developed based on various algorithms, simultaneously affecting different subsystems and 
organs.
Even in those cases where a performed therapy provides with a positive effect, there is no guar-
antee that it is not achieved due to reduced functionality of some other organs. The side effects 
of such therapy can intensify de-synchronization of various regulatory mechanisms, break a 
balance of various controlling systems, and cause a vicious circle of pathological disturbances.
It will be possible to move from the medicine of “consequences” to the medicine of “rea-
sons” and to work out adequate tactics of patient’s treatment, only if we take into account 
individual features of an organism as a whole.
The direction of the therapy should become:
1. a support and stimulation of the organism protective functions, upraising its adaptiveness 
and balancing individual controlling systems and their communication;
2. an achievement of maximum positive effect of used medicines with a minimum side effect 
on other subsystems of the organism;
3. a development of a combined therapy optimal dynamics to ensure positive changes in 
reserve abilities of the organism as a whole.
Mathematical modeling becomes an important auxiliary tool to solve these problems. It 
upraises considerably efficiency of system analysis of contradictory experimental data, trans-
forming it into new understanding, based on integrated parameters of environmental and 
radiation effect on an organism as a whole and its individual systems. Better approximation of 
radiation and other environmental factors impact on the organism can be achieved using such 
an approach.
Computer technologies are to be used as learning tools to teach a physician to treat an 
organism as a whole in opposite to a specific illness, to see an integrated picture of inter-
connected organism’s systems, to predict consequences of stress impact, to individualize the 
treatment process (choice of an optimal treatment strategy).
In (Atoyev 2005) advanced modeling method for health risk assessment has been elabo-
rated. It is based on catastrophes, bifurcation, and chaos theories. The 4-dimensional typol-
ogy of the organism network as a self-reproducing, self-organizing entity, has been proposed. 
A nonlinear mathematical model of neuro-immune-endocrine network (NIEN) has been 
elaborated. It makes possible to investigate interrelations between various control mecha-
nisms of metabolic and hormonal regulation, radiation, and stress impacts on thyroid sys-
tem, mechanisms of various endocrine diseases formation.
The following tasks have been examined:
1. comparative analysis of endocrine system regulation for some types of thyroid system 
pathology (such as hypo- and hyperthyroidism, T3- and T4-thyreotoxicoses);
2. optimum control of thyroid system restoration;
3. ranking of radiation influence on various links of thyroid system.
The performed system data analysis made it possible to reveal the most probable sequence 
of metabolic and hormonal changes leading to a thyroid pathology occurrence.

6.3.1 The mathematical model of health risk assessment
A human organism (HO) can be considered as an open, non-Hamiltonian, non-linear, dissi-
pative, potential, self-reproducing, self-organizing system with networking elements, near an 

156 Recent advances in information technology
unstable steady state far from equilibrium, in bifurcation zone where any fluctuation leads to 
an unpredictable future (Prigogine and Stengers 1984). A disturbance in some network node 
may lead to catastrophic consequences in the whole network. The effects of a disturbance 
could impact areas far from the initial source due to existing longer-term links and a great 
extent of cause and effect in HO. Health risks are those insidious risks emerging slowly but 
surely over time. Any environmental impact increases possibility of the case where some fluc-
tuation can cascade into a disease with unpredictable health consequences.
The high initial conditions susceptibility is a common feature of such systems and it makes 
it impossible to predict patient’s health or a treatment effectiveness. Traditional methods to 
predict a system development are not enough efficient. There is a “growing recognition that 
risk management should not be based on the assumption of linear cause and effect”, as noted 
in (Wilkinson et al. 2003, p. 387). Such entities are usually examined using recent theories of 
nonlinear systems, synergetic, chaos, and bifurcation.
Let us propose that organism satisfies all the requirements of potential system and can be 
described by some potential function U(X) of variable X. This function has some steady states; 
some of them are stable, others—unstable. The transformations of system from one steady 
state to another, or transformation of a character of a steady state (for instance, from stable to 
unstable) are functions of control parameters A. These parameters control both a movement of 
system’s current position upon surface U, and transformations of the surface itself.
Let X be a level of health. To make it simple, it is possible to put forward following sup-
positions. Potential function U (X,A) has three stable steady states (Fig. 6.10). The first one 
(X1) characterizes normal condition. The level of health in this state is maximal. The second 
one (X2) characterizes premorbid or pre-pathological state with a medium level of health 
(the reserves of the organism and its adaptiveness are lowering, but yet not across the criti-
cal level which separates normal functioning and an illness. The third one (X3) characterizes 
disease.
The risk estimation of sudden and unexpected transformation from various states of organ-
ism has been performed using the algorithm based on theory of catastrophes (see part 6.3).
So, the set of values of the potential function U(X,A) control parameters and their deviations 
from bifurcation surfaces may be utilized for risk matrix determination to calculate probabilities 
of transformations between various steady-states of physiological system. Thus, the potential 
function U(X,A) determines the level of health. One of the catastrophes’ theory universal defor-
mations can be used to define U(X,A) depending on the number of control parameters.
Let us introduce some postulates that we use as a basis to develop the model.
1. A state of an organism is considered as complex interrelationship in a “square of health” 
(SH), which is determined by a state of NIEN regulation, cellular, and physiological adap-
tiveness, mental sphere, and a genomic pre-history. A set of health threats, including envi-
ronmental and radiation impact, has a potential to destroy an intricate balance existing 
within the SH by altering the above-mentioned factors. The balance disturbance within 
the SH is a most formidable health threat to be prevented, as it leads to a transition from 
norm to diseases.

The mathematical problems of complex systems investigation under uncertainties 157
2. To examine a health environmental impact problem we have chosen a 4-dimensional 
typology. The transformations of health are defined by one of the universal deformations 
of catastrophes’ theory—a “butterfly”:

where Ai (i = 1,4) are control parameters, characterizing various aspects of the organism’s 
functioning (i = 1 – index of NIEN regulation, determined by hormones levels, energetic 
substrates, sub-populations of lymphocytes, etc.; i = 2 – index of cellular and physiological 
adaptiveness to environmental impacts, determined by the balance between energy synthesis 
and consumption processes, reserve possibilities to extreme loads, etc.; i = 3 – index of mental 
health, determined by psychical and psychological peculiarities of the organism; i = 4 – index 
of genomic pre-history, determined by genetic inclinations of the organism).
According to Prigogine’s theory, dissipative structures can not only maintain themselves in 
a stable state far from equilibrium but may even evolve. When the flow of energy and matter 
through them increases, they may go through new instabilities and transform themselves into 
new structures with increased complexity. That is why organism (as pointed by F. Capra), can 
be considered as a giant web of life, which consists of fractal networks where any network con-
tains another one. And a node of the network being zoomed is getting transformed into a new 
network (Capra 1996).
Under more detailed investigation, parameters Ai also may be examined as n-dimensional 
functions Ai(Fj) (j = 1,n), that are arguments of some potential functions UAi. Variables Fj 
describe each index in more detail. Such iterative process leads to the next sublevel of bifurca-
tion sets, determined by:

So, a peculiar “fractal pyramid” of bifurcation sets can be constructed; by using this pyra-
mid a hierarchical risk matrix of system transformation from one health sublevel to another 
can be determined. In Fig. 6.11 projections of “fractal pyramid” on the surfaces AN-1AN-2, 
BM-1BM-2, CL-1CL-2 are presented.
For instance, the state of NIEN regulation can be determined on the basis of integrated 
indices of hormone system status (B11), energetic status of cells (B12), immune system sta-
tus (B13), blood system status (B14), characterizing endocrine, energetic, immune and blood 
systems, respectively. A mathematical method of risk assessment of pathological and pre-
pathological state arising was developed using these indices, which characterize a degree of 
functional disturbances (Atoyev and Rykhtovsky 2000).
Shifts in the organism’s functional systems change the parameters B1j (i = 1,4). Those may 
cause transfers from norm to pre-pathology or to pathology. Bifurcation values of these param-
eters can be calculated by means of proposed mathematical methods. Reaching such critical 
values abruptly increases the probability of a transfer from one functional state to another.
Thus, for a given organism’s state, it is possible to determine ranges of functional param-
eter values corresponding to the states of norm, pre-pathology and pathology. The examples 
of such indices calculation for NIEN and cellular and physiological adaptiveness are pre-
sented in the subsequent chapters.
6.3.2 Chaotic oscillations in a system of energy exchange
The analysis of an energy exchange shows that while such dissipative structures as an organ-
ism receive their energy from outside, the instabilities and jumps to such new forms of organi-
zation as a disease appear to be a result of fluctuations amplified by positive feedback loops 
(Capra 1996, Prigogine and Stengers 1984).
Let us examine these feedback loops more deeply to investigate possible mechanisms of cha-
otic behavior developing in the energy conversion system. Based on experimental investigation 
of cellular energy exchange (Thabrew et al. 2004), the following postulates can be proposed:
 1. Oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria plays a central role in the energy supply of 
various cellular functions: active ion transport, proliferation, muscle contraction, pro-
tein synthesis, etc.
 2. An organism has some demand on activities of various physiological systems, cellular, 
and subcellular networks.
 3. Some part of the cell energy is getting consumed for internal cellular functions; another 
part is used for external functions, determined by the organism demand.
 4. The demand depends on various factors: current states of physiological systems, loads, 
environmental impacts, hormonal pool, efficacy of control mechanisms, etc. Let b1i(t) 
denote a current demand on activity of i-th control system normalized to the energy 
synthesis unit (mitochondrion) – Yi.
 5. The current state of i-th control system is characterized by a level of its external function 
which determines its supply to the organism demand. The supply may correspond to 
the demand or may not. Let b2i(t) denote a level of supply normalized to the unit of i-th 
control system’s function (a contractility for muscle, a rate filtration for a kidney, etc) Xi. 
According to the proposed designations, b1i(t)Yi and b2i(t)Xi characterize total demand 
on activity of i-th system and total supply on fulfillment of external function determined 
by possibilities of mitochondria, correspondingly.
 6. Let the rate of supply change be proportional to the prevalence of organism demand 
over supply. Then we have the following equation for a dynamic of external function:

   where a1i(t) is a parameter characterizing adaptive possibilities.
 7. Some cellular mechanisms exist that modify intracellular structures and involve new 
mitochondria in energy synthesis under prevalence of demand (biosynthesis, redistribu-
tion of ion and energy currents, etc.). Let us assume that the higher Xi is the greater is a 
number of mitochondria Yi involved in the process. Let c1i(t) be a demand on an increas-
ing of number of mitochondria normalized to Xi unit, and c2i(t) be a share of Yi involved 
in Xi maintenance. Thus, c1i(t)Xi and c12i(t)Yi characterize total demand and supply on 
mitochondria correspondingly.

 9. The fact that an increase of Yi is limited by various biological factors (for instance, by a 
competition for substrates) is not taken into account in (6.10). Moreover, some part of 
Yi is involved in cellular internal functions. This part is proportional to Xi (which adds 
to an existing demand to i-th system structures). It is also proportional to the level of 
pathological disturbances Zi developing in cellular structures and demanding additional 
energy for their elimination. Consequently, the equation (6.31) is to be transformed into:

    where c3i(t) is a demand on Yi caused by a maintenance of cellular internal functions and

 10. The rise of disturbances is proportional to the load level on the structures maintaining 
external function Xi. It depends on Xi, and the number of Yi involved in the energy synthe-
sis. We also propose the existence of some control (adaptive) mechanisms, which eliminate 
some part of disturbances under some restrictions. These mechanisms are getting activated 
under appearance and accumulation of disturbances. Let d1i(t) and d2i(t) be the constants 
of proportionality. Thus, the rate of disturbances will be described by the equation:

According to Lorenz (1963), sustained chaotic behavior arises in this model. The rise of 
demands leads to increasing of parameter r. The rise of supply leads to its decreasing. There 
are intervals of demand/supply ratio corresponding to different regimes of metastable chaos.
Small fluctuations of parameter r case the essential transformation of system dynamics. At 
the upper boundary of above mentioned intervals of demand/supply ratio such fluctuations 
may lead to catastrophic consequences connected with transition from stability to instability, 
from a state with a low level of cellular vulnerability to a state with high one.
A transition, from stability (low level of vulnerability) to instability (high level of vulner-
ability) could be analogous to the transition from a laminar to turbulent flow. The modeling 
of such transition presented in Fig. 6.12 illustrates the impact of fluctuation (parameter r) 
on dynamics of phase portraits. Fig. 6.12a corresponds to stable or laminar dynamics (σ = 4, 
r = 80). Fig. 6.12b and Fig. 6.12c—to instable or turbulent dynamics). Small fluctuation of 
parameter r (from r = 60.000 to r = 60.001) cases the essential transformation of phase portrait.
Thus, relationships between cellular external function, cellular energy, and cellular dis-
turbances may be described by the Lorenz model of metastable chaos. A transition, from 
stability to instability of energetic flows, could be analogous to the transition from a laminar 
to turbulent flow.
6.3.3 Mathematical model of neuro-immune-endocrine regulation
Analysis of experimental data concerning various aspects of radiation negative influence on 
human organism unambiguously testifies that one of its most appreciable consequences is a 
harsh spike of the diseases dealing with Thyroid System (TS) function disturbances. These 
sorts of diseases are progressing during all after-Chernobyl period.
Despite the intensive research carried out lately, there is no uniform vision of the exact TS 
links and regulatory mechanisms which are the main targets for radioactive iodine. What are 
the chains of events which are getting realized with the greatest probability under a radiation 
action? Which links are primary targets of radiation action, and which ones are just of a sec-
ondary, or compensatory character? Without the answers to these questions it is impossible 
to develop an effective prevention under radiation action on a human organism.
So, detailed analysis of TS control mechanisms appears to be one of the most actual problems 
in modern endocrinology. A weakening of the TS function triggers a consequent sequence of hor-
mone and metabolic violations, resulting in the development of various pathological processes. 
Thus, it is also essential to determine an effective therapy strategy which would lead to a synchro-
nization of various regulatory mechanisms activities and optimization of the usage of specific 
medicines, normalizing levels of Thyroid Hormones (TH) during different types of TS pathology.

The mathematical problems of complex systems investigation under uncertainties 161
thyroxin (T4), interleukin-1, Arachidonic Acid (AA), Catecholamines (CC), Glucocorticoids 
(GC), and a number of other hormones and metabolic factors play an important role in the 
control of NIEN (Sobolev 1987).
Interleukin (IL-1) appears to be one of the most important links between immune and 
endocrine system. It is being produced not only by cells participating in myelo- and lympho-
poesis (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophyle granulocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killers, 
and so on), but also by the cells of central and peripheral nervous systems (brain neurons, 
peripheral neurons and others). IL-1 activates hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenocortical sys-
tem; it stimulates synthesis of CRF and somatostatin, causes alterations in noradrenergic 
neurons’ activity. A high level of IL-1 leads to GC and ACTH levels growth in blood and 
inhibits TTH synthesis. This inhibition consequently causes drop of TTH, T3 and T4 levels. 
GC also causes an inhibition of IL-1 synthesis.
Block-scheme of radiation impact on NIEN is presented at Fig. 6.13. Shvitra’s TS model 
based on non-linear equations with a delay (Shvitra 1989), has been modified introducing 
some terms to take into account impacts of metabolic and stress factors (including radiation) 
on NIEN (Atoyev 2005).

dash-and-dot line—for interrelation between immune and endocrine systems, and dotted line—for

growth hormone, S(t) – somatostatin, ES(t) – estrogens can be defined based on the math-
ematical model (Atoyev 1999).
A software for NIEN analysis at some types of TS pathologies (hypo and hyperthyroidism, 
T3- and T4-thyreotoxicoses) has been developed; it has been used to assess the role of meta-
bolic and thyroid components in a NIEN disturbances development process.
TH dynamics for norm, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, obtained in a model exper-
iment, is shown at Fig. 6.14. The frequency of T3 and T4 oscillations and their amplitudes 
increase during hyperthyroidism according to the model. The opposite results were obtained 
in the case of hypothyroidism.
TH changes under T3- and T4-thyreotoxicosis have been also investigated. T3-thyreotoxi-
cosis causes an increase of T3 and a frequency of its oscillations, but decrease of TTH. The 
oscillations of T4 practically do not vary on amplitude, but vary on a phase. T4-thyreotoxi-
cosis causes an essential increase of the level of T4 and a frequency of its oscillations. 
A frequency of T3 oscillations also considerably increases, but their amplitude does not vary 
so intensely. A level of TTH decreases to a lesser degree than during T3-thyreotoxicosis.
Average values of metabolic factors in the interval of modeling are presented at Fig. 6.15. 
Basing on the model we can conclude that hyperthyroidism, T3- and T4-thyreotoxicosis are 
not linked to essential changes in metabolic factors dynamics. On the contrary, hypothyroidism 
is a unique disease (from the above list), which is linked with an amplification of Ca++ influx, 
intensification of cell metabolism, and essential changes of metabolic factors. First of all, those 
are CN and AA.
Our research results in the following ranking of thyroid pathologies by the role of meta-
bolic impacts in NIEC disturbances: T4-thyreotoxicosis (minimal impact), T3-thyreotoxico-
sis and hyperthyroidism (medium), hypothyroidism (maximal). Thus, the following schemes 
of development of pathological processes may be considered.

The mathematical problems of complex systems investigation under uncertainties 163
1. A primary disturbance of TS regulation is getting transferred to a level of metabolic regu-
lation due to the changes in Ca++ influx intensity and energy synthesis. During hypothy-
roidism, it results in essential misbalance between the processes of synthesis and energy 
consumption in a cell. Some existing experimental observations corroborate this assump-
tion: 1) inhibition of energy synthesis due to a decrease of T3 and T4; 2) activation of energy 
consumption linked to the increase of Ca++ input in cells because of the increased TTH.
2. The energy disbalance causes metabolic shifts, for instance cAMP and prostaglandins 
level changes. Probably, they have compensatory character to limit negative changes in 
TH ratio.
6.3.4 Optimal control of the thyroid system restoration
The task of optimal control of TS restoration has been defined as follows: mathematical 
model of TH synthesis, control parameters Ui (i = 1 – activators of oxidative phosphoryla-
tion, i = 2 – activators of Ca++ transport, i = 3 – Iodine ions, i = 4 – intensity of Ca++-pump 
work, i = 5 – inhibition of hypothalamus activity by cortisol) and their minimum and maxi-
mum values, accordingly Uimin, Uimax have been given. Control effects and phase trajectories 
minimizing functional Fj on an interval (0,Tk) are to be found:

They determine total amount of k-th hormone in the time interval [0, T] in norm, at dis-
ease j, and at presence of control effects Ui. The model experiments were carried out. Their 
objective was normalization of TH levels at the mentioned above diseases. The modeling 
results obtained at controls Ui (i = 1.5) have allowed us to rank the efficiency of control proc-
ess under above diseases (Fig. 6.16).
Following are QO consequences in the descending order.
1. Hyperthyroidism. Small decrease of T3 and T4 levels and small increase of TTH level are 
possible. QO indices are, respectively, 1.55966, 1.72004, and 1.15142.
2. T3-thyreotoxicosis. The decrease of T3 and T4 and rise of TTH levels are insignificant. 
QO indices are, respectively, 1.07491, 1.04857, and 1.62824.

3. T4-thyreotoxicosis. Some decrease of T3 and T4 levels and some increase of TTH level are 
possible. QO indices are, respectively, 18.948, 1.26746, and 2.17923.
4. Hypothyroidism. In this case, essential increase of T3 and T4 levels is possible, as well as 
some decrease of TTH level. QO indices for the above hormones are, respectively, 24.9942, 
2.52003, and 3.23769.
Table 6.4 shows the critical time points of controls Ui (i = 1, 5) where they change the direc-
tion of their variation.
The increase of control parameters number essentially improves the quality of the opti-
mization. It is possible to rank controls on their contribution in TS normalization. For 
instance, control U5 addition essentially improves QO indices in the case of T3 normaliza-
tion under hypothyroidism. Apparently, it has been caused by the decrease of hypothalamus 
inhibition by cortisol (increase of the parameter U5). On the contrary, control U4 addition 
doesn’t improve QO significantly. Indeed, the decrease of Ca++-pump intensity (increase of 
the parameter U4) doesn’t make such a direct contribution to TS normalization. In this case, 
there is a growth of Ca++ level in the cell.
It can render not specifically directed effects depending on the balance of various cell 
intermediates. Thus, the performed numerical research shows that TS restoration is a compli-
cated problem. It is necessary to change the vector of control parameters’ variations several 
times in the considered time period, i.e. essentially change the therapy used.
6.3.5 Radiation impact investigation on thyroid system
The radiation impact on an organism has a large variety of possible targets. This complexity 
makes it difficult to estimate correctly contribution of various changes in forming pathologi-
cal processes evoked by the radiation.
The key moment in forming TS disturbances is a dependency of CN system (cAMP and 
cGMP) on an irradiation doze level (Sobolev 1987). cAMP action prevails at small irradiation 
dozes. It stimulates a TTH synthesis and restricts a TH synthesis. cGMP action prevails at high 
irradiation dozes, resulting in an opposite effect. What can be a reason for such a discrepancy?
It is possible to assume the following probable reasons:

interval (hours), TC – type of changes: ↓ – decrease, ↑ – increase).

The mathematical problems of complex systems investigation under uncertainties 167
1. Free radicals’ accumulation at high irradiation dozes; it causes the decrease of a pros-
taglandin’s synthesis rate, in spite of the increased level of Ca++ and weakening one of 
adenylatcyclase activation mechanisms.
2. Exhaustion of the adrenergic system also causes the decrease of an adenylatcyclase 
activity.
3. Allosteric regulation of phosphodiesterase activity by a high level of cGMP; calcium 
accumulation in the cell at high irradiation dozes also causes the rise of cGMP level. High 
level of cGMP increases the activity of phosphodiesterase causes acute drop of cAMP 
level, which cannot be compensated by a stimulation of the adenylatcyclase activity due 
to prostaglandins.
The model (6.39) has been utilized to investigate possible mechanisms of pathology forming 
caused by a radiation action on the organism. We took into account that an increase of the 
exposure doze (D) varies the rates of TH synthesis and destruction, as well as the intensity of 
Ca++ ions fluxes through cellular membrane in both directions (see Fig. 6.13). Based on these 
data, let us introduce the functions to define a dependence of some model parameters on a 
radiation doze: dj = dj(D), (j = 1,7), b1 = b1(D), β2 = β2(D), γ2 = γ2(D). These functions have been 
determined based on the parameter identification problem solution using the method of causal 
search.
The mathematical problem statement has been formulated as follows:
Let Xi = (xi(D1),.. . xi(Dn)), (i = 1,3) be a sample of experimental data, where X1 – TTH, 
X2 – T3, X3 – T4, xi(Dn) is a level of i-th hormone in the middle of n-th intervals of exposed 
doses. Let the mathematical model be given as:

to radiation action. At the dose of 0–2 Gy, the most influenced by radiation impact are the 
processes of TH synthesis, TTH, and TRF destruction, as well as Ca++-pump. At the doze of 
2–4 Gy, the radiation also affects a Ca++ influx. At the doses of 4–10 Gy, the radiation also 
affects a destruction of T3 and T4. It has been known that various cellular processes which 
were considered as targets of a radiation action are controlled by the CN system. Besides, 
it has been shown that a dysfunction of the CN system manifests in early periods after irra-
diation and can precede changes in other systems. All these facts raise the question whether 
postradiation changes in the CN system are the mechanism triggering disturbances in other 
systems. In this case the disturbances are caused rather by metabolic modifications in cells 
connected with the changes of the CN ratio, than by a direct effect of free radicals formed by 
irradiation and other products of radiolysis (at least, on the early stages).
Thus, the research of a CN role in formation of post-radiation disturbances is one of the 
central problems of modern radiobiology. The increasing number of publications makes the 
conclusion that this research can shed light on the mechanisms forming radial affection and 
permit a development of complex therapeutic schemes of the individualized therapy, as well 
as new methods for estimation of its efficiency and health risk. The mathematical modeling of 
such complex system has demonstrated possibility to get an approximation of the real sequence 
of the events developing in the organism as a whole under the action of radiation and others 
stress factors, on the basis on some integrated parameters of environmental impact on the 
organism as a whole and on its separate control systems. The research made it possible to rank 
various links of TS by their sensibility to a radiation impact and determine the following most 
probable sequence of their changes: radiation action → change in the NIEN system → change 
of ACTH and cortisol levels → change of TTH level → change of Ca++ input → change in the 
CN system → change in TH synthesis → disturbances in metabolism of Ca++ ions.
6.4 CONCLUSIONS
A renewed focus on inequality and sustainability characterizes the great part of scenarios 
elaborated by the UN experts during last decade. Their common idea is the following: grow-
ing inequality reduces opportunities of sustainable development whereas greater equality 
makes societies stronger. The challenges of global changes turn environmental and social 
protection systems to necessary components of survival in XXI century. Such conclusions 
become more apparent for developing world, including Ukraine. For Eastern Europe, the 
reforms of social sphere and system of energy, water and food consumption may become

driving forces that accelerate its development and reduce lag behind leaders demonstrated 
their abilities to implement the reforms.
However, the reforms are not viable without appropriate facilitating tools. The informa-
tion systems based on mathematical models are important components of such tools. They 
improve essentially outcomes of reforms and foster timely decision makings on environmen-
tal, financial, economic, and social issues. Those information systems also provide scientific 
and technological basis to develop scenarios for society safe in various dimensions, speed-up 
of sustainable economic growth, and increase in life quality.
The main objective of this scientific research is to promote new approaches for sustainable 
management of the environment through developing new technologies of vulnerability and 
risk assessment and management for the complex environmental systems for which standard 
modeling methods and tools are inadequate.
The practice of the approach to risk analysis describes herein allows not only for estima-
tion of the risk of emergency, but also for the calculation of the quantitative characteristics of 
reserve possibilities of complex system and its components. It also allows for the description 
of the current state of the system by ranking a set of risks of emergency occurrence in its sepa-
rate links, thereby identifying the weakest link and area of needed improvement. The main 
advantage of this approach is the determination of vulnerability as the function of dynamic 
variables of the investigated ecological, social, technogenic, economic and biological systems.
Proposed approach may be transformed into the baseline tool for increasing of horizon of 
forecasting, also as for elaborating the global strategy of disaster and other extreme and rare 
events prevention, which the world currently lacks.

INTRODUCTION
Characteristic feature of a present day situation is that energy companies attempt to improve 
energy efficiency in conditions of aging of high voltage power equipment that is involved in 
the processes of the optimal control at the stages of generation, transport and consumption 
of electric energy.
Large-scale introduction of methods and means of intellectual support of optimal deci-
sion-making proves their efficiency. One of the directions of efficiency increase in electric 
energy transportation is improvement of methods and means of active power losses reduc-
tion on conditions of maintaining reliable operation of high voltage equipment, including 
out-dated equipment.
At any moment of time, energy system is in the state that is determined by its parameters. 
The set of energy system states and processes the transition from one state into another. Its 
mode is characterized by the parameters, for instance electrical: voltages and substations 
loading, current in the transmission lines, transformation ratio of the transformers, etc.
Normal operation of energy systems is only possible in conditions of reliable function-
ing of a real-time operation control system of EES modes. Modern technologies of optimal 
control provide the improvement of methods and facilities of their information support. 
Concept of Smart Grids provides large-scale implementation of energy saving technologies 
in conditions of outdated equipment operation.
Jakushokas (2013) suggested the technique, aimed at reducing of voltage drop in separate 
parts of distribution networks, however it does not take into account a technical state of 
regulation devices. Tirupathi Reddy (Tirupathi et al. 2012) considers the example of electric 
networks in India, statistics of power value increase that is transported in electric network. 
It is proved that such increase leads to the overloading of certain transmission lines, to rapid 
aging of high voltage equipment, undesirable rapid reduction of residual operation life of 
the equipment, to its failures. As a result, duration and cost of damaged equipment repair 
increases, power losses grow in the branches of electric systems, which in the period of repair 
operate in non-optimal modes. It is stated that for the increase of network reliability and 
efficiency of energy transmission, it is necessary to use power transformers, equipped with 
load changing devices and automatic or automated control systems of such LTC devices, that 
would control power flows in the branches of the circuit and perform the control oven LTC 
in such a way that the parameters of electric network modes were within the limits of techni-
cal parameters of the equipment (transmission lines, switching devices, transformers, etc). 
It is provided by usage of FACTS technologies.

174 Recent advances in information technology
M. Kolcun, D. Hlube˘n, L. Be˘na, N. Djagarov and Z. Grozdev (Kolcun et al. 2010) consider 
the possibility of using of phase-shifting transformer for change of power flows in an electric 
energy system in order to decrease electric power losses during its transmission in the lines 
of Slovak Republic. M. Bocovich, K. Iyer, R. M. Terhaar, N. Mohan (Bocovich et al. 2013) 
show high cost of FACTS technologies usage in power industry for reduction of electric 
power losses.
C. Constantin, M. Eremia, L. Toma (Constantin et al. 2013) consider three variants of 
power flows control in electric network, using three FACTS devices: with Thyristor Control-
led Series Capacitor (TCSC), Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and phase-
shifting transformer (PST), but the state of equipment that performs modes control, is not 
paid attention to.
In (Alekseev 2010) B.A. Alekseev, on the base of the analysis of literature sources carried 
out, makes a conclusion that prolongation of power transformers lifetime for the period of 
20–30 years is more profitable that their replacement by new ones; the amount of power 
transformers in the USA that operate more than 25 years (certificate resource – 25 years) is 
about 65%. That is why computer systems that perform non-stop monitoring over the state 
of high voltage equipment and its nodes function (Rassalsky 2010).
The example of such systems may be «
-750» or «
-500» that enable us to control 
the state of insulation of power transformers bushings during operation and other equip-
ment. As B.S. Stogniy, M.F. Sopel state (Stogniy and Sopel 2013), control of high voltage 
equipment provides the realization of tasks dealing with the monitoring of the values of its 
diagnostic parameters and determination of current technical state of this equipment. As B.S. 
Stogniy, O.V. Kirilenko, O.F Butkevych, M.F. Sopel state (Stogniy et al. 2009) basic technical 
characterizes and indicates modern monitoring facilities that enable us to improve the reli-
ability of a real-time operation control system of United Energy System (UES) of Ukraine 
due to new possibilities of real-time operation control problems solution that appear during 
the introduction of such facilities.
The results of power transformer technical state determination may be used to define its 
current loading ability (Buslavets et al. 2015). In (Kylymchuk et al. 2015) it is proved that the 
application of new technologies, methods and means of modes control allows to reduce the 
losses of active power in electric networks. Taking into account the current state of power, 
transformers with on-load top changing devices decrease the risk of their damage during 
modes regulation (Lezhnyuk et al. 2012).
The aim of the research given is the development of the method of on-line diagnostics of 
the transformers with LTC and taking into consideration its results during optimal control of 
EES modes in order to minimize total losses of active power and excessive expenses of finan-
cial resources for the repair of the transformers in case of their failure (Lezhnyuk et al. 2012).
7.1 MATERIALS AND RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH
Automation of the process of power flow control may be provided by means of centralized 
remotely controlled alternative usage of switching devices (LTC) of the transformers. Under 
such conditions, the possibility of the analysis of control actions of separate LTC on mode 
parameters of EES appears by means of the feedback. This approach improves the operation 
quality of adaptive control automatic systems of the LTC position control. For this purpose, 
at considerable changes of load schedule it is necessary to perform ranking of the transform-
ers with LTC by the quality of their impact on maintaining optimal parameters of the modes.
Realization of measures, aimed at reduction of power losses is limited by the possibilities 
of the equipment involved in the provision of optimal mode; namely, by its technical state. 
It is known that the damage of high voltage equipment during mode control (for instance, 
power transformers) leads to losses that considerably exceed the cost of electric energy, saved 
as a result of losses decrease.

Study of the impact of the technical state of the transformers with the LTC 175
Failure rate of the out-dated high voltage equipment (power transformers, shunting reac-
tors, instrument current and voltage transformers, switches, etc.) increases when such equip-
ment is in operation for more than 25 years (Tirupathi et al. 2012).
Taking into consideration the fact that the control of EES modes is accompanied by the oper-
ation of switching devices, regulation devices, transformers, switching surges, ferro-resonances, 
currents increase in power and instrument transformers, transmission lines, etc, then the con-
trol of modes must be realized, taking into consideration their technical state (Kolcun et al. 
2010, Bocovich et al. 2013) and possible expenses for their replacement or repair.
Thus, it is necessary to know current state of high voltage electric equipment of EES, that 
is in operation during modes control.
7.2  DETERMINATION OF CURRENT TECHNICAL STATE OF POWER 
TRANSFORMERS
We will consider the methodology of determination of high voltage equipment current state 
on the example of power high voltage transformers, that have on-load-tap changing device. 
We suggest to evaluate technical state of power transformer by means of the analysis of the 
coefficient of its residual resource in the range from one (the best technical state) to zero (the 
worst technical state, when the transformer must be removed out of service for inspection, 
repair, replacement etc.).
Then, we will consider the example of residual resource coefficient determination of the 
transformer 
 125000-330/110. First, we will study the statistics of failure rate of 
such transformers.
It is seen in Table 7.1 that, as a rule, the transformers are removed out of service as a 
result of humidity and contamination of oil, insulation as well as defects of bushings. The 
problem of development of mathematical model is complicated in conditions of incom-
pleteness of initial data, when part of the parameters are known at the time of calculations, 
for instance, due to the necessity to carry out additional studies. To establish the inter-
relations of diagnostic parameters fuzzy modeling is very constructive technology. Such 
modeling allows us to obtain more reliable results as compared with the results of existing 
diagnostic systems.

Symbols used in Table 7.1: Zk − the resistance of the transformer windings (during meas-
urements in short – circuit mode); t° − the temperature of contact points (for instance, bush-
ing of the bus duct or with winding lead); Pi.p. − idle mode power that characterizes the 
quality of magnetic circuit; Rin − the resistance of the insulation for revealing the contamina-
tion and aging of solid and liquid insulation (it is also necessary to determine the capacity 
and dielectric loss tangent, it is also desirable to determine the degree of polymerization); 
W − humidity of the isolation; kresid.res.bush. − the residual resource coefficient of the bushings; 
CADGC − residual resource coefficient of the transformer by the results of chromatographic 
analysis of dissolved gas in the transformer oil of the tank and LTC (ethylene, ethane, meth-
ane) of the transformer that characterizes oil contamination by the gases dissolved in it, for 
instance acetylene and hydrogen (for revealing of discharges); PCA − residual resource coef-
ficient of the transformer by the results of physical-chemical analyses of transformer oil from 
transformer tank, contactor and LTC tap changer; CADGd − residual resource coefficient of 
the transformer by the results of chromatographic analysis of the dissolved hydrogen and 
acetylene in the transformer oil of the tank and LTC of the transformer tap changer in order 
to reveal the discharge; kLTC − coefficient of the transformer LTC residual resource; Im − the 
current of electric motors oil pumps and fans of cooling system; t°cool − coolers temperature; 
kresid.res − the residual resource coefficient of the transformer tank, determined by the avail-
ability (takes the value «0») or absent of oil leakage (takes the value 1).
Table 7.1 shows that the transformers are often displayed in repairs due to moisture and oil 
contamination, insulation and high-voltage inputs defects.
The task of creating a mathematical model complicated with incomplete initial data as 
part of the parameters known at the time of payment, such as the reasons for the need 
for additional studies. To establish reciprocal links diagnostic parameters very constructive 
simulation technology is unclear. This simulation allows us to obtain more reliable results 
compared to the results of existing diagnostic systems.
In Table 7.1, the controlled diagnostic parameter means deviation from which the norm 
helped to remove the transformer out of service or which was taken into account in the proc-
ess of its removal out of service. In Table 7.1, the following diagnostic parameters are given: 
parameters, that characterize the state of the windings, insulation, bushings, oil, LTC, cool-
ing systems, tank.
Having analyzed the data of the Table 7.1, the scheme showing whether the impact of diag-
nostic parameters is dependent or independent on the coefficient of total residual resource of 
the transformer (Fig. 7.1) was created.
Fig. 7.1 does not show mutual impact of one controlled diagnostic parameter on the other 
one. It is shown either in dependent or independent manner how these parameters influence 
the coefficient of total residual resource of Power Transformer (PT).
In Fig. 7.1, over the parameter the percentage amount of revealed faulty transformers by 
the given parameter is shown, that is given in percent of the total amount of faulty trans-
formers. Consecutively denoted blocks with the deviations from which the norm helped to 
remove the transformers out of service. Blocks with the parameters that help to remove PT 
out of service on condition of simultaneous deviation of these parameters from the norms,

Study of the impact of the technical state of the transformers with the LTC 177
that is stipulated by the requirements regarding the reliability of transformers operation are 
shown in parallel (for instance, currents of electric motors of oil pumps and fans).
In order to obtain generalized index of residual resource of the transformer that takes into 
consideration the values of diagnostic parameters and their impact, it is suggested to pass 
to corresponding coefficients of residual resource by each diagnostic parameter from known 
values of diagnostic parameters (set in the given values). These coefficients are defined in 
relative units by (7.1) and that is why they characterize total output of the transformers from 
the moment of their technical state control to transition to boundary state that is residual 
technical resource (7.12). Residual resource coefficient ki by i1th diagnostic parameter:

We perform the reduction of the circuit by the following expressions. For serial part of the

7.2.1 Neuro-fuzzy model of residual resource coefficient
To create a mathematical model of residual resource, coefficient of the transformer param-
eters were used, by each of these parameters the conclusion regarding the state of the trans-
former can be made. But none of these parameters completely characterizes technical state 
of the transformer. It only shows certain changes of technical state of power transformer. 
Mathematical model of residual resource coefficient of the transformer was created by means 
of MatLab (Lezhnyuk et al. 2012). Using this model, it is possible to edit the already created 
(by the formula (7.5)) probabilistic sample of teaching data. These data help to obtain ana-
lytical dependence of residual resource coefficient of the transformer on diagnostic param-
eters in the form of the polynomial. For seven input parameters of the model that randomly 
changed from 0 to 1, the coefficient of total residual resource of the transformer (7.5) was 
determined, where input parameters of the model were reduced to relative units of their 
deviation from the norm.
By means of Anfis Editor using hybrid teaching algorithm and applying Sougeno algo-
rithm of fuzzy conclusion (Kolcun et al. 2010) neuro-fuzzy model of residual resource coef-
ficient of the transformer (using subclusterization method) was obtained.
The structure of the obtained neural network is shown in Fig. 7.2. For each input variable 
of neuro-model four linguistic terms with Gaussian membership functions (Kolcun et al. 
2010) were used:

where: δi1 and ci1 – are numerical parameter; δi

1 – in probability theory it is called dispersion 
of the distribution (7.14) and the second parameter ci1 − is mathematic expectation; i1 – is 
input parameter of neural-fuzzy model, that corresponds to diagnostic parameter (i1 = 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7), xi – is value of i1th input parameter of the model: x1 − kwind, x2 − kin, x3 – kbush, 
x4 – koil, x5 – kLTC, x6 − kcool, x7 – ktank.
These are such terms as: “normal” values of diagnostic parameter, “minor deviations” of 
diagnostic parameter value, “prefault” values of diagnostic parameter, “emergency” value of 
diagnostic parameter.
For determining the value of total residual coefficient fuzzy non-linear autoregressive 
model of the total residual resource coefficient of the transformer is used. This model 
establishes fuzzy non-linear transformation between the values of residual resource 
coefficients by diagnostic parameters and total residual resource coefficient of the

(7.11)
Fig. 7.2 shows that in the process of formation of the structure of neuro fuzzy model of 
the transformer seven inputs and one output of this model were set. Each of seven inputs has 
four terms. That is, each set of possible values of input parameters of the model is conven-
tionally divided into four subset: “normal” values of input parameter, “minor deviations ” of 
the values of input parameter, and “prefault” values of input parameter, “emergency” values 
of input parameter. Membership degree of each value of input parameter to corresponding 
set of values is determined by Gaussian membership function.
The model is intended for determining the numerical value of total residual resource coef-
ficient of the transformer, that is why it has one output. This numerical value is found by 
means of solution of linear equation, that describes the dependence of the coefficient of total 
residual resource of the transformer on input parameters.
The obtained neuro-fuzzy model allows us to determine the value of total residual resource 
coefficient of the transformer depending on the values of input parameters − residual 
resources coefficients by each of controlled diagnostic parameters. Thus, if each of residual 
resource coefficients of diagnostic parameters will equal 0 relative units (r.u.), then the coef-
ficient of total residual resource (with the error 0.4%) equals 0.004 r.u.; if each of the coef-
ficients of residual resource of diagnostic parameters equals 1. r.u., then the coefficient of 
total residual resource (with the error 3.2%) equals 0.968 r.u.
Despite the complexity of dependences, mathematical model of residual resource coeffi-
cient of the transformer (7.11) may be used for programming fuzzy controller in order to cre-
ate the device for on-line determination of transformer state by means of analysis of residual 
resource coefficient of the transformer value.
7.3  ACCOUNT OF THE FORECAST CURRENT VALUE OF RESIDUAL 
RESOURCE OF THE TRANSFORMERS IN THE PROCESS OF OPTIMAL 
CONTROL OF MICRONETWORKS MODES
It is known that in the process of operation, energy enterprise plans to remove the equipment 
in the overhaul out of service, cost of is forecast. Removal of the transformer into overhaul 

182 Recent advances in information technology
in a planned number of years (TWF) of trouble-free operation (12 years) provides certain list 
of works and their expected cost Boh pl. For instance, for 330/110 kV transformers of 125–250 
MVA power the cost (B) of such repair amounts to 200–300 thousand UAH. We propose to 
assume that removal the transformers out of service into current repair requires unscheduled 
cost.
The cost of repair may increase by the value ΔB1, replacement of damaged blocks of the 
transformer and additional work, connected with the replacement. These costs are not pro-
vided in case of “typical” planned overhaul:

unscheduled replacement; γ and β – are coefficients, that characterize the impact of residual

Repair cost may increase by the cost of ΔB2 (as compared with expected) in case of 
enlarged current (instead of planned overhaul) repair of the transformer, that did not oper-
ate for planned number of years:

depends on the construction of the transformer, conductions and operation mode (is deter-
mined experimentally), BOH – is the cost of transformer overhaul.
It should be noted that removal the transformer out of service takes place not only as a 
result of relay protection, emergencies control automation operation, but also by a person 
responsible for safety operation by the results of control of diagnostic parameter, values of 
which sometimes only approaches to limiting values.
Within the context of creation of modern Smart Grids and to provide safe, reliable, quality 
and economic efficient operation of EES it is necessary to perform the control over active 
power overflow to realize by means of the transformer, performing reliable and information 
archons on the mode. That is why we suggest to take into account the coefficient of regulat-

mation ratios; Z − diagonal matrix of complex branches resistances; Ce − is the matrix of 
currents distribution coefficients for economic mode of electric network (corresponds to 
minimal losses of electric energy); J − vector-column of currents in nodes; Ub − is the voltage 
of basic node; E*bal.a, E*bal.r − are optimal balancing electric moving in relative units (EMF) 
(active and reactive components).
Taking in the consideration the discrete character of LTC switching’s, errors of instru-
ment transforms, errors of data transmission channels and recommendations (Tirupathi 
et al. 2012), we assume that non-sensitivity zone of active power losses may be considered as 
regulating actions on LTC of the transformer − to 3% (Constantin 2013).
As initial conditions, we assume that, in accordance with load graph, LTC of transformers 
9–11, 9–12, 11–10, 12–10 have transformation ratios 0.6413 (14 tap), 0.6347 (14 tap), 0.6397 
(14 tap), 06446 (14 tap). It should be noted that further changes of operation mode were 
realized at admissible voltage deviations ±5%, from nominal voltage Unom. Regulation of the 
transformer 7–3 is inexpedient on conditions of the usage of the given technique of determi-
nation of optimal transformation ratios.
We define the losses of active and reactive power in the branches of the circuit at current 
transformation ratios (Table 7.5).

 − is vector column of phase voltages in the nodes, ΔPbr, 
ΔQbr  − is vector-column of active and reactive power losses in the branches of the circuit 
(correspondingly).
We define optimal transformation ratios (7.16–7.17) and position of LTC on condition of 
minimal amount of switchings (in order to maintain switching resources of LTC) to provide 
minimal losses of active power in branches of the circuit in Table 7.6.
As a result of performance of control actions, mode optimization power losses were 
reduced from ΔS1 = 4.49 + j29.05 (MVA) for mode (Table 5) to ΔS2 = 4.42 + j28.69 (MVA). 
Thus, the effect of transformer LTC switchings is ΔS1-ΔS2 = 0.07 + j0.36 (MVA). The transi-
tion from the current to the optimal mode may be performed by switching the LTC of the 
transformer, installed in the branch 9–12 from 13 tap to 14 and carry out transformer regula-
tion changing position of LTC from 14 tap to 15. We consider the transition to other stage of 
the daily load graph, which parameters are given in Table 7.7.
As a result of performing of the control actions, we achieved the mode optimization 
by decreasing power losses from ΔS1  =  61.85 + j412.73 (MVA) for the mode (Table  7.7) 
to ΔS2  =  61.80 + j412.68 (MVA). Thus, the effect of LTC transformer switchings is ΔS1-
ΔS2 = 0.05 + j0.5 (MVA).
If, as a result of determining of the coefficient of regulating the effect limitation for cir-
cuit transformers (Fig. 7.3) the following values are obtained: kwind,9–11 = 0.85, kwind,12–9 = 0.4, 
kwind,11–10 = 0.3 a kwind,12–10 = 0,2, then expected quasi-decrease of losses, taking into account 
these coefficient, will be defined.
Control actions are performed by the transformer, installed in the branch 9–11, namely we 
change position of LTC with 14 tap on 15. In this case, the expected losses of active power 
are ΔP9–11 = 61.82 (MW). We find the decrease of active power losses ΔPΣ − ΔP9–11 = 61.85 – 
61.82 = 0.03 (MW), however, having taken into account the coefficient of regulating effect 
limitation, losses decrease change δPquasi.9–11 = (ΔPΣ − ΔP9–11).kwind,9–11 = 0.0255 (MW). New 
quasi-losses ΔPquasi.9–11 = ΔP9–11 + δPquasi.9–11 = 61.82 + 0.0255 = 61.8455 (MW). Results of the 
calculation of other transformers are given in Table 7.9.

where: ΔSα = ΔUα Iα – is element of vector-column of power losses in the branches that contain

transformer; it changes in the range from 0 to (ψ − 1), where ψ – is the number of branches 
containing transformers.
Applying this algorithm, according to (7.20), quasi-resistances of the branches containing 
transformers are found. The results of the calculations are given in Table 7.10.
We define mode parameters for the circuit with quasi-resistances from the Table 7.11 and 
optimal corrected transformation ratios from Table 7.12.
The aim of the optimal control is to provide the minimum of all system active power losses 
that are determined by the expression:

the technical state of the transformers.
Figure 7.6. The optimal transformation ratio for the large loads mode taking into account the techni-
cal state of the transformers.
Thus, the transition from the current to the optimal mode can be performed by switching 
the LTC of the transformer installed in the branch 9–12 from 13 tap to 14 tap and regulation 
of the transformer in branch 12–10, changing the LTC position from tap 14 to 15 tap.
As a result of performance of the control actions, the optimal mode will be reached by 
switching the transformer in the branch 11–10 from 14 to 16 tap of the LTC, the transformer 
in the branch 12–10 from 15 tap to 14 tap, the transformer in the branch 9–11 from 14 to 15 
tap and the transformer in the branch 9–12 from 14 to 13 tap of the LTC, respectively.
We see that due to taking into account the technical state of the transformers, their ranking 
occurred by the measure of impact on the reduction of the active power losses. To reach the

Study of the impact of the technical state of the transformers with the LTC 191
optimal mode, it is more expedient now to use a transformer of 9–12 branch, as it reduces 
most active power losses during one switching of the LTC from 13 tap to 14 tap.
7.4 CONCLUSIONS
1. Application of the methods of the neuro-fuzzy modeling allows to calculate the value of 
the residual resource coefficient of the power transformer, taking into consideration both 
current values of certain diagnostic parameters as retrospective values.
2. Analysis of calculation values of the residual resource coefficient of the power trans-
former allows to evaluate its current technical state.
3. Method of determination of optimal control actions by the transformers with the LTC is 
improved, taking into consideration their technical state. It is expected that application of 
this method enables to evaluate the expediency of performance of the control actions.
4. It is determined that performance of such optimal transformation ratios will lead to 
decrease in active power losses and excessive expenses for transformers repair in case of 
their failure.
