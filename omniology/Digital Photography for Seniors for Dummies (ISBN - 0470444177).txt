D
igital cameras put all the art and science
of photography into your hands. Few
things are as personal and instantly gratifying
as a photograph. We freeze a moment in time
to be marveled over for years to come.
You may already have a camera or perhaps
you’re getting ready to buy one. The choice can
be simple because the major features you’re
looking for are common to many models. After
you have your camera, you’ll be amazed by
what it does automatically and what you can
do with a little control.
Those of us who grew up using film cameras
remember the hassles associated with taking
pictures. We bought film in rolls and struggled
to get it into the camera. (Unless you used
Polaroid or an Instamatic.) We weighed each
potential photo to decide whether it was worth
taking: Would it come out okay? What if we
ran out of film because of that one wasted
shot? Before every corner drugstore got a pro-
cessing lab, we took or mailed our photos to
specialists and waited days, which might have
been months after we took our photos. (There
always seemed to be a photo or two we had
forgotten taking.) Finally, the photos came
back and soon joined countless others in a
shoebox or, if you were really diligent, in a
photo album. Every aspect of that process has
changed with digital photography.
Digital cameras free you from the expense and
effort to be ready for next photo. No film
means no processing, and no delay or expense
for that. (Although, you can still print photos
whenever you want to.) Above all, digital 
Conventions used in this book 
This book uses certain conventions to help
you find your way around, including these:
➟
Bold: I use bold on the important,
find-it-now stuff.
• When you have to type something
in a text box, like in a dialog box
in a computer program
• When I mention a button to press
or an option to click, whether it’s
on your camera or computer
• Figure references
Some illustrations and figures have notes or
other markings to draw your attention to a
specific part of the figure.
• Dialog box names and menu choices.
➟
Web site addresses: They look
like this: www.website.com.
➟
Menu choices: Look for this arrow
symbol: ➪. This shows a sequence of
steps on a camera or a computer menu.
For example, Menu➪Image Quality➪
JPEG means to click the Menu button,
choose Image Quality from the menu
that opens, and then choose JPEG.
On the computer, you single-click the left
mouse button to select an option or open a
file. A single click of the right mouse button
always produces a special, contextual menu
with commands tailored to the situation.
Only when appropriate will I tell you to
click the right mouse button. All other times
when I tell you to click the mouse, you can
assume that I mean the left button.
Tip icons point out helpful suggestions
related to tasks in the steps lists.
➟
Introduction

photography provides instant feedback, so you can immediately
decide whether to take another shot or whether a particular setting
worked.
With a computer and software, you can edit a digital photo, correcting
issues in pictures that would have been worthless years ago. You can
fix or improve the brightness of the photo, as well as, many other
aspects. With the techniques you learn in this book, you can turn a
photo from blah to ah.
Finally, you can enjoy your digital photos and share them in so many
ways. E-mail photos to friends and family for instant updates. Let peo-
ple experience your travels online with photo hosting services. Display
your photos in any room on digital picture frames. And, print your
favorite photos, not only on individual prints, but in handsome
bound books. This book shows you how.
About This Book
Age is just a number. This book is intended for anyone getting started
with digital photography. I’ll tell you how to use your camera and pro-
vide step-by-step instructions, in many cases. Numerous figures illus-
trate camera controls and the photos you can take using recommended
settings and techniques.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume you want clear, brief instruction on taking, editing, and shar-
ing photos with others. I also assume you want to know just what you
need to know, just when you need to know it. This isn’t Photography
101. This is Practical Picture Taking and Sharing. As an old friend of
mine says, “I don’t want to make a watch; I just want to know what
time it is.”
The camera and photography topics and tasks should be of use to com-
puter and non-computer users, alike. Halfway through the book, the
subject shifts to include computer software, primarily photo-editing
programs. Computer-based tasks are based on Windows Vista and XP.
Most of the editing and organizing tasks in this book use Windows Live
➟
2
Digital Photography For Seniors For Dummies

Photo Gallery because it’s free to any Vista or XP user, it’s fairly straight-
forward to use, and because I use Photo Gallery every day. I do not
mean to slight Mac users, who can adapt the coverage to include iPhoto
on the Mac. Unfortunately, I know of only one free photo-editing and
organizing program that works on both Windows and Mac. That’s
Google’s Picasa, which came out for the Mac just before this book went
to press. I also don’t mean to ignore popular programs like Adobe
Photoshop Elements. However, Elements isn’t free and its many tools
take more time to master.
Why You Need This Book
You know taking pictures can be easy. Technology always comes with its
own terms and concepts, but you don’t need to learn another language
to have fun taking photos. You don’t need any prior experience with
cameras, digital or film. Step-by-step instructions guide you through
specific tasks, such as choosing a particular setting on your camera.
These steps provide just enough information for the task at hand.
You can work through this book from beginning to end or simply open
up a chapter to solve a problem or help you learn a new skill whenever
you need it. The steps in each task get you where you want to go quickly
without a lot of technical explanation. In no time, you’ll start picking up
the skills you need to become a confident digital photographer.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into four parts to help you find what you need.
You can read from cover to cover or just jump to the page that interests
you first.
➟Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera.
These chapters guide you through shopping for a dig-
ital camera and taking your first photos. Which cam-
era features matter most? Chapter 1 explains features
such as resolution, macro, and zoom. Chapter 2 cov-
ers the basic steps to taking photos with minimal
fuss. Chapter 3 takes you into the setup menus for
more control over your camera.
➟
3
Introduction

➟Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos. Taking photos
can be as simple as point and shoot. These chapters
provide guidance on taking better photos, based on
the subject and the scene. Chapter 4 covers basic
guidelines. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on people, ani-
mals, flowers, places, and other scenes. Chapter 7
introduces information to help you understand more
of what the camera does automatically and what you
can do manually, if you choose.
➟Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom.
After you take your photos, then what? In Chapter 8,
you move your photos to a personal computer. In
Chapter 9, you use Windows Live Photo Gallery — a
free program — to organize and categorize your pho-
tos. You also use Photo Gallery to enhance your pho-
tos through easy edits in Chapters 10 and 11.
➟Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos. Digital photos
don’t gather dust in shoe boxes. Sharing your photos
is more than half the fun. These chapters help you
share your photos with friends, family, and the
world. Chapters 12 and 13 provide information on
printing photos at home and through a printing
service. In Chapter 14, you share photos in e-mail
and on the Web. Chapter 15 covers digital picture
frames, the 21st-century replacement for family
photo albums. In Chapter 16, have some fun putting
photos on your computer desktop, in screen savers,
and in photo books purchased online.

Buying a Digital
Camera
T
he right digital camera for you becomes a
handy tool for recording precious memo-
ries. You’ll snap shots of your friends, family,
pets, and special events to preserve forever and
look back at fondly years from now.
Photos don’t just freeze the past. With a digital
camera, you can stay in touch with people no
matter how distant. Let them see what you’re
up to, at home or while you travel. A vacation
snapshot makes the best postcard.
Your camera should be a good fit for you —
not too small, not too large, and not too heavy.
You want to feel comfortable carrying your
camera, so that you’ll always have it nearby,
even when you don’t expect to need it.
Buying a camera doesn’t have to be a difficult
decision. As with any device, some features
matter more than others. You may choose a
camera by price, size, picture-taking features, or
even the color of its body. Dozens of camera
manufacturers sell countless models. In this
chapter, I introduce you to digital cameras and
the features you may want in your next camera.
This information will help you navigate

Explore Types of Digital Cameras
Cameras have a wide range of features. Expect features such as auto-
matic scene modes, which are settings that are designed for taking pic-
tures in particular conditions, such as at night or at a sporting event.
Some cameras are extremely compact, while others are larger and
accept add-on lenses. The number of features available is determined
by the type of camera:
➟Compact, point-and-shoot cameras are small and easy
to use, as the name implies. You don’t have to worry
about having too many options or controls with most
point-and-shoot cameras. This is a great camera type
for casual photography and snapshots. Most manufac-
turers, including Casio (as shown in Figure 1-1),
Kodak, and Olympus, sell models in this category.
Figure 1-1
➟
8
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

➟Digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras are the
choice of professionals and serious amateurs or hob-
byists. Unlike a simple point-and-shoot camera, a
DSLR has many features designed to give you control
over every aspect of picture taking. DSLRs have a
faster response time than other types of cameras, with
almost no delay between the moment you click and
when the photo is taken. (Non-DSLR cameras often
have a fraction-of-a-second delay.) Canon and Nikon
dominate the DSLR category. Figure 1-2 shows a
Nikon DSLR camera.
Figure 1-2
➟Bridge or prosumer (a combination of professional
and consumer) cameras fill the gap between the
casual point-and-shoot camera and the highly control-
lable, professional-level DSLR camera. Some reviews
classify bridge cameras as point and shoot in spite of ➟
9
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

their extra features. Falling between the other camera
styles in features, size, and price, a bridge camera is a
good choice for someone who wants more options
than those that come with a point-and-shoot camera
without the more complex and expensive features of a
DSLR. Manufacturers of bridge cameras include those
named in the preceding categories plus Panasonic and
Sony. Figure 1-3 shows an example of a Sony bridge
camera.
Figure 1-3
Choose a Price Range
Camera prices start near $50. Anything less than that may not really be
a bargain — though it might make a good door stop. Consider these
price ranges:
➟Cameras between $50 and $250: These cameras are
usually compact, pocketable, easy to carry, and easy to
use. Perfect for casual photography, these less expen-
sive point-and-shoot cameras can’t be expected to pro-
vide all the bells and whistles of more expensive
models. Still, don’t feel you have to spend more than
you want to. You have to start somewhere, and a rea-
sonably priced camera makes sense if you don’t need
all the features found in more expensive cameras.
➟
10
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

Cheaper cameras may need more time to turn on,
store pictures, or ready the flash than more expensive
models need. Response time matters if you plan on
shooting photos in rapid succession, such as at a fast-
paced event.
➟Cameras between $250 and $600: These cameras
offer more features than cheaper cameras, such as
additional automatic settings for shooting in a wider
range of conditions. These cameras are likely to be
larger and heavier. This price range includes some
point-and-shoot cameras and all of the bridge mod-
els. You may find a cheap DSLR body at the high end
of this range, but that won’t include a good lens. You
may need to spend more time exploring and figuring
out the features of these cameras.
➟Cameras above $600: These DSLR cameras have fea-
tures that professional photographers and advanced
amateurs crave, including exchangeable lenses and
more direct control over combinations of settings.
There is no upper limit to what you can pay; it would
be easy to spend $1,000 to $3,000 on one of these
high-end cameras and the accompanying gear.
The CNET Web site (http://reviews.cnet.com/
digital-cameras) compares cameras by price.
Identify the Features You Want
Do you want a camera that fits in your pocket or purse to pull out for
spontaneous photos? Do you want to get close to flowers or wildlife? Is
photography your passion (or can you imagine it becoming that)? As
you look at cameras, consider which features matter most to you. The
following lists describe all the features and options you should con-
sider before you purchase a digital camera.
Consider these features first, because they matter to most photographers:
➟
11
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

➟Ease of use: If you want decent photos under most
conditions without making many decisions, look 
at point-and-shoot models such as Canon Power
Shot, Kodak EasyShare, Nikon COOLPIX, or Sony
Cyber-shot.
➟Scene modes: These options set up the camera for
taking the best photos under different conditions.
Landscape mode works best for, well, landscapes —
long, sweeping shots of vistas with lots of scenery.
Sports or Action mode freezes action at an athletic
event or captures fast-moving wildlife. Portrait mode
puts the emphasis on a person. Some cameras pro-
vide you with a dozen or more scene modes to
choose from. In Chapter 4, you can practice working
with some of these modes.
➟Face and smile detection: Some cameras recognize
faces in a scene and focus on those faces automati-
cally, ensuring that part of the photo will be sharp.
Some cameras can even detect when subjects are
smiling and can take a picture at the precise moment
everyone in the scene is smiling. Some cameras also
warn you if a subject blinked.
➟View options: A viewfinder lets you hold the camera up
to your eye to compose or frame your photo, just like
a film camera. An electronic viewfinder (EVF) displays
information about camera settings superimposed over
the scene. An LCD is a small screen on the back of the
camera that you can use instead of an electronic
viewfinder. Using the LCD to take a picture, you hold
the camera away from your face, up to arm’s length. An
LCD makes it easy to see the pictures you’ve taken and
to use the setup menus most cameras have. 
➟
12
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

A camera with both an electronic viewfinder and an
LCD screen gives you the best of both worlds. If you
wear glasses, you’ll appreciate having a way to adjust
the viewfinder focus to suit your glasses. This option
is sometimes called a diopter correction knob or wheel.
➟Battery type: All cameras use batteries to power every
aspect of operation. You can use up your camera bat-
teries in one day if you take lots of photos. Check to
see if the camera you are considering uses a special
battery (like a cell phone does). A spare special 
battery could cost between $30 and $60, so you
might want a camera that uses two or four standard
AA batteries. Rechargeable batteries are a must —
don’t use regular one-use batteries.
➟Control types: The more options a camera has, the
more controls it probably has. Many cameras use 
a dial for scene selection. Other functions may use
buttons — often tiny buttons. Cameras even use
rings, joy-sticks, and touch screens. Controls can be
easy and intuitive or not, depending on the camera
and on you.
The following features may be important to you if you intend to take
more than casual snapshots:
➟Close-ups: A macro setting allows you to put the
camera extremely close to the subject, even less than
an inch away. The result is an extreme close-up that
reveals details that are often missed, such as the heart
of a flower or the pattern on a butterfly’s wings.
Figure 1-4 shows a composite shot of an extreme
close-up of a flower. The regular shot on the left is
out of focus, while the macro shot on the right is in
focus.
➟
13
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

Figure 1-4
➟Distant shots: A zoom lens ranges from near to far,
bringing a distant subject closer to you. You can pho-
tograph an entire sports team or zoom in to photo-
graph one player. If you plan to photograph birds
and other wildlife, you want an extreme zoom — 10X
or larger — to bring distant subjects closer. 
Most point-and-shoot cameras are limited to a 3X
zoom; bridge cameras and so-called ultrazooms
zoom to 10X and beyond. The X factor (10X, 3X, and
so on) indicates the magnification from a normal,
unzoomed, so-called wide-angle shot taken with that
camera and a zoom shot, also called telephoto. A 3X
zoom is adequate for most close-ups of people and
pets. A 12X zoom will bring distant subjects much
closer to you, as shown in Figure 1-5. 
Regular focus
Macro shot
➟

Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

Differences between one camera’s wide-angle and
another’s make it tricky to compare zoom factors
(zoom is a multiple of wide-angle). Look for so-
called 35mm equivalents, which convert these lens
measurements into the standard of film cameras for
more accurate comparisons between camera models.
A 10X zoom is likely to be equivalent to something
between 280mm and 380mm, depending on the
wide-angle portion of the lens.
Ignore references to digital zoom or combined zoom.
Optical zoom is the measurement that means the
most when you’re comparing cameras.
Figure 1-5
➟Image stabilization: If your camera moves as you
take a picture, the photo may not be sharp. Even if
your grip is rock-steady, the slightest movements can
ruin a long-distance zoom shot. (The longer the
zoom or the darker the scene, the worse the effect

➟
15
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

movement will have on the shot.) Be sure your cam-
era has an image-stabilization feature (also called
antishake or vibration reduction), which assures sharp
focus in spite of normal minor movement.
➟Focus modes: All digital cameras focus automatically.
However, some cameras provide multiple focus
modes, such as center focus, multiple spot focus, and
manual focus. Center focus assures you the subject in
the center of the frame is in focus, while other areas
may be blurred, which can be used to make the sub-
ject stand out from the surrounding scene. Multiple
spot focus assures that all areas of the photo are in
focus. Manual focus lets you specify the distance
between the camera and the subject in feet or meters.
➟Image resolution: The image sensor is a computer
chip with a light-sensitive surface that captures pho-
tos. The width and height of a photo are measured in
tiny dots called pixels, and the area of the photo is
measured in millions of pixels (megapixels, MP). The
more megapixels a camera has, the larger a photo it
takes. 
Having more megapixels is especially important
when you want to edit (see Chapter 10) or print (see
Chapter 12) the photo. The megapixel total is less
important if you don’t plan to print or edit. Smaller
photos are fine for e-mail and on-screen viewing. A
typical edit is to crop or cut a portion of the picture to
make the subject fill more of the frame. Having more
megapixels allows you to crop a smaller area of the
picture and still have a big enough picture left over to
enjoy.
➟Memory card: In a digital camera, photos are stored
as digital files in the camera. Although some cameras
have built-in, non-removable memory for saving pic-
tures, that is usually limited to a few photos. Most
➟
16
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

cameras use removable memory cards to enable you to
save more photos. Consider buying more than one
memory card if you plan to shoot more photos than
one card can hold before you can delete photos or
move them to a computer. Buy a large capacity 
memory card — at least 1 gigabyte (1GB) — that is
the correct type for your camera. Read the camera
specification on the box or in the manual to identify
the correct card for your camera. The wrong type of
card won’t fit your camera. Figure 1-6 shows four
typical memory cards. 
Figure 1-6
➟File format: Photos are usually stored as JPEG files
(JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group),
which is an optimal file format for photos. Some
bridge cameras or DSLRs store photos as RAW files,
which may be a better file format for you if you plan
to edit your photos extensively on your computer by
using advanced software tools. I talk more about
photo editing in Chapter 10.
➟
17
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

The following features may be nice to have or more than you need:
➟Red-eye fix or reduction: When a camera flashes,
light may reflect from the back of the subject’s eye,
producing red-eye, a rather creepy effect. Some cam-
eras have red-eye reduction settings or features, such
as producing two flashes in a quick sequence: The
first flash contracts the subject’s pupils, and the sec-
ond is used for the actual snap of the photo. Other
cameras can remove red-eye automatically. You can
also fix red-eye later, with photo-editing software.
➟Special effects: In-camera processing options can let
you add effects to your photos, such as shooting in
black and white, sepia, or pastel colors. But don’t
worry: If your camera doesn’t offer these options, you
can add many effects to photos later by using photo-
editing software on your computer.
See the Cheat Sheet inside the front cover of this
book for a list of camera features and recommenda-
tions on what to look for as you compare cameras.
Research Digital Cameras on the Web
Many Web sites offer information about digital cameras and feature
reviews by people who have bought and used a particular camera. You
can also go online and compare camera prices from different vendors. 
Online reviews often include detailed photos of the camera’s features, as
well as sample photos taken with the camera. The best camera reviews
grade specific features, such as the preset scene modes and the camera’s
setup menus, which are hard to judge without hands-on experience.
Consider the ratings and reactions of individual buyers with a grain of
salt. You don’t know whether the reviewer wants the same things in a
camera that you want. Look at as many comments and reviews as you
can to get a consensus reaction. Many Web sites summarize user ratings.
➟

If you don’t have a computer, most public libraries
and many community centers do, and a librarian can
also help you get online.
Look for camera reviews at these Web sites (Figure 1-7 shows the Web

Get Your Hands on a Camera in a Store
The Web can’t tell you whether a camera fits comfortably in your hands
or whether the buttons are small or difficult to reach. You have to hold
a camera to find that out. Consider going to a couple of stores so that
you can handle a few different cameras.
Look for a store with a camera kiosk that groups cameras together, like
the kiosk shown in Figure 1-8. Pick up each camera and pretend to
➟
20
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

take a picture. How does it feel in your hands? Consider the camera’s
shape, size, and weight. Is the Shutter Release button (usually a wide,
flat button on the right side on top of the camera body or grip) that
you press to take a photo a comfortable size and in a convenient place? 
Here are some stores to check out:
➟Office supply stores, such as Office Max and Office
Depot
➟Discount clubs, such as Costco and Sam’s Club
➟Electronics retailers, such as BestBuy and Target
These stores all have Web sites, too, if you prefer to
shop online. But again, it’s a good idea to spend at
least a little time in a store where you can actually
hold some cameras in your hands.
Figure 1-8
➟
21
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

If you choose to do your shopping at a camera store — a retailer that
specializes in cameras and camera equipment — you should expect to
find knowledgeable, experienced staff. You should also expect to have
access to less-common camera models than electronics retailers carry.
You’re likely to find higher-end, more expensive cameras in a camera
store. But if you’re shopping for a DSLR, that’s exactly the type of place
you should check out.
Keep in mind that the models you find on display in
a store may not be the same models you’ve researched
online. If you like a camera you haven’t already
researched, take the time to do that research. Beware
impulse buying.
Select Accessories
Tools (or toys) beget more of the same. You may just be looking for a
camera, but you’ll find plenty of camera accessories to consider:
➟Spare memory card: Definitely consider having a
spare card on hand, especially if you’ll be shooting a
lot of photos before you can delete any of them or
move them onto a computer. A full card is like run-
ning out of film — you can’t take any more photos. A
large memory card may hold hundreds of photos,
however, so depending on how much shooting you
plan to do, one card may be all you need.
➟Camera cables: For some cameras, a cable connects
the camera to a USB port of a computer for transfer-
ring photos from the camera to the computer. This
connection is essential if you want to view your pho-
tos on your computer monitor, e-mail them to
friends and family, or edit them with photo-editing
software. (You find out how to copy photos to a com-
puter in Chapter 8.) Some cameras use a cable to
connect to a TV or DVD player for displaying photos
on TV. 
➟
22
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

➟Card reader: This device is another way to get your
photos from the camera to your computer. A card
reader accepts a memory card you have removed
from your camera, and then you connect the card
reader to a USB port of your computer. You don’t
need a card reader, however, if your camera connects
directly to the computer with its own cable.
➟Spare batteries: These are always good to have on
hand. You can easily drain a set of batteries in a day.
If you run out of power, you’re done taking pictures.
Rechargeable batteries are a must. Practice replacing
your batteries so that you can do so quickly when
you need to.
➟Battery charger: This item will be a welcome addition
on longer trips, such as a vacation. If you’re traveling
out of the country, add an electrical outlet adapter. If
you’re traveling by car, get an adapter for your car ciga-
rette lighter so you can charge as you drive.
➟Camera bag: This handy accessory keeps all your gear
in one safe place. Look for a padded bag large
enough for the camera plus everything else. The bag
or a compartment of the bag should snuggly hold
your camera. Most camera bags have a handle and a
shoulder strap. Small bags may have loops for a belt.
➟Tripod: You attach your camera body to a tripod to
hold your camera steady. Tripods are also great for
photos taken with a timer so that you can jump into
the picture. (Make sure your camera has a metal tri-
pod socket on the bottom of the body.) A tripod is
also useful for holding the camera still for shots
taken in low light or when you’re using a long zoom. 
You may want a large tripod up to 6 feet tall with tele-
scoping legs, although not everyone needs such a big
one. However, almost anyone will get good use out of ➟
23
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

a pocket-sized, fold-up tripod that costs around $10.
Some small tripods use a beanbag instead of the tradi-
tional three legs (is it still a tripod, then?) to provide a
steady base that can rest on an irregular surface, such
as a rock. Figure 1-9 shows some of the different sizes
of tripods you can choose from.
➟Monopod: It’s like a tripod, but this variation has a
single leg instead of three. (In Figure 1-9, the mono-
pod is on the far left in the background.) It also has
the usual tripod screw at the top. A monopod won’t
stand without your help, but it can help you steady
the camera. If you need increased steadiness for your
photography, but you’re frequently on the move, a
monopod may be a better choice than a tripod
because it’s easier to move around. Some walking
sticks even have monopod attachments at the top of
the pole. Check sporting goods and outdoor retailers.

➟Printers: You have all kinds of very affordable printer
options these days — printers that can produce glossy
enlargements or high-quality smaller prints. But don’t
buy a printer until you’ve read Chapter 12.
➟Computer: This is more than just an accessory. A
computer gives you ways to store, edit, and share
your photos. You can enjoy a digital camera without
owning a computer, but you’ll enjoy your photos
more with a computer. Part III covers the digital pho-
tography reasons you’ll want a computer.
Unpack and Set Up Your Camera 
1. When you get your camera, lay out all the items that came
with it and confirm that you received everything you
expected from the packing slip, box label, or ad. If your
camera came with specific step-by-step instructions for
setting up the camera for its first use, follow those steps
instead of these before you take your first picture.
2. Remove all packaging, including tape. Store this material
until you’re sure you won’t need to return your camera to
the seller.
3. If your camera has a neck or wrist strap, thread the strap
ends through the slots on either side of the camera body.
Take care to attach the strap securely. Test it gently. You
don’t want your camera to fall off this strap.
4. Install the memory card, if you have one. Look for a small
cover on the bottom of the camera or either side. Some
cameras have one cover for both memory card and batter-
ies, as shown in Figure 1-10. Open the door by pushing
or sliding the cover. With your thumb on the label side of
the memory card and any exposed metal contacts away
from you, gently insert the card into the card slot. If you
meet resistance, pull the card out and turn your hand to ➟
25
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

try inserting the card the other way. The card should slide
in easily and stay in. (It may click in place.) Do not force
the card. Close the memory card slot cover.
Figure 1-10
To remove a memory card, with the cover open, push the
card in slightly, and when you release, it should pop out.
Never pull or pry a card out.
Never install or remove a memory card while the
camera is on. You could lose photos or damage 
the card.
Memory card
Battery
➟
26
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

5. Install the battery or batteries. Look for a small door on
the bottom or side of the camera. Open the door by
pushing or sliding the cover. If the battery is rectangular,
put your thumb on the label and gently push it in — the
battery will go in only one way. If your camera uses two
or four standard batteries, look for an indication of which
end goes in for each battery. (The standard batteries don’t
all go in the same way; they alternate.)
6. Locate the lens cover. If it’s a separate piece, leave it unat-
tached for now. If the lens cover clips in place, remove the
cover before you turn on the camera. (In some camera
models, when you turn on the camera, the lens will strike
the lens cover if you forget to remove the cover.) If the
cover slides, gently sliding it may turn the camera on.
Don’t force the lens cover off or on.
Some lens caps come with a thin string you can slip
through a hole in the lens cap and another hole in the
camera body or around the camera strap to keep the cap
with the camera.
7. Turn on the camera if moving the lens cover didn’t do
that automatically. Look for a message on the LCD or in
the viewfinder.
The camera may automatically ask for the current date
and time, which will be recorded with each photograph.
Enter that information using the up and down buttons to
change numbers and use the right and left buttons to
move to different parts of the date and time. These but-
tons are usually arranged around the outside of a circular
button. After you’ve selected the current date and time,
press the OK button.
8. Go ahead: Take a picture of anything. You know you 
want to.
➟
27
Chapter 1: Buying a Digital Camera

9. If your camera came with a CD or DVD, you can install
that software on a computer later. The software may
include a program for viewing and editing your pictures.
Stick an address label (plus your phone number and
e-mail address) onto your camera in the hope that
someone will return it to you if you lose it. I also put
a copy of this info in the battery compartment of my
camera.

Taking Your
First Photos
T
aking pictures is easy: In most cases, you
just point and shoot, assuming that you
turn on the camera first and that there’s no
lens cap in the way. No matter how easy cam-
eras make taking pictures, though, spend a lit-
tle time exploring the buttons, knobs, and
switches scattered about the top and back of
your camera. Where is the Power button? Do
you have to remove the lens cover, or does it
move automatically?
In this chapter, you work with major controls
on your camera. You’ll use these features more
often than any others, such as Automatic mode.
As you explore these controls, take some pic-
tures and some movies for practice.
The LCD panel on the back of your camera dis-
plays the photos and movies you’ve taken.
You’ll also use the LCD to display photos or
movies you intend to delete from the camera.
If your camera came with a video cable, you
can connect the camera to a TV or DVD player
to see you pictures on the big screen — no
computer needed!

Locate the Camera’s Controls
Turn your camera over a few times, looking closely at every surface. You
may never use every control, but you’ll want to identify as many con-
trols as you can (see Figure 2-1). You’ll use each of these controls in
this chapter.
➟The Power button: Use the Power button or switch
to turn the camera on and off. There is usually a
slight delay between using the switch and being able
to take pictures, so plan accordingly to turn the cam-
era on shortly before you need it. The camera will
turn off automatically if you don’t use any controls
for a few minutes.
➟The LCD display: This panel is on the back of the
camera and is between 2" and 4" across diagonally.
When the camera is on, you will see the scene before
you on this LCD. You also review the pictures you’ve
taken on this LCD.
If your camera has an electronic viewfinder, there is a
button to switch the display from the viewfinder to
the LCD. It may be labeled Finder or EVF/LCD. You
can use either display at any time.
➟The Scene Mode dial: This dial lets you identify the
type of scene you are shooting, such as a landscape.
You’ll explore these options in Chapter 4.
➟The Shutter Release button: This button is usually
on the top of the camera on the right side or on the
back in the upper-right corner. Press this button to
take a picture.
➟The flash and Flash Control: The flash may be built
into the front of the camera, or it may pop up from
the top. Your camera may have a button to open the
flash. Look for a button with a lightning bolt on it to
turn the flash on and off.
➟

➟The Review button: Press this control (often a green
triangle) to switch from previewing the scene you are
about to photograph to reviewing the photos you
have already taken. Press it again to stop reviewing
and return to previewing.
➟The Delete button: This button is often marked with
a trashcan. As you review photos, press this button to
delete the picture or movie you are currently review-
ing. You may have to confirm the deletion by press-
ing the Delete button again or by pressing an OK
button or something similar.

Turn the Camera On and Off
1. Before you turn on the camera, be sure you have inserted
a charged battery (or batteries). See Chapter 1 for infor-
mation on setting up your camera for the first time.
2. Take off the lens cap. 
If your camera has a clip-on lens cap, remove the lens
cap before turning on the camera. This prevents the lens
from bumping the lens cap.
If your camera has a sliding lens cover, slide it left or right
to open. That may turn your camera on automatically.
3. Press the Power button or slide the On-Off switch to turn
on the camera. See Figure 2-1 above. You may hear the
lens move. A logo may appear on the LCD or in the
viewfinder, followed by the scene before the camera lens,
which may be your lap or this book, at the moment.
4. The LCD displays some of your camera settings superim-
posed over the scene. If your camera has a Display button
(sometimes, simply labeled DISP), you can turn off this
information display if you find it too distracting.
5. When you’re done with your camera, turn off the power
with the same control that turned it on. Replace the clip-on
lens cap, if you have one. If your camera has a sliding lens
cover, slide it closed, which may also turn the camera off.
Maximize your battery life by turning off the camera
as soon as you know you don’t need it any longer.
Use Automatic Mode
1. Automatic mode puts the camera in charge of all settings.
(You still have to turn on the camera.) Look for a button
labeled Auto. If your camera has a mode dial, the Auto
➟

setting should stand out from all others, as shown in
Figure 2-2. It may be green or red. See Part II for informa-
tion on other modes, including various scene modes
shown in Figure 2-2. 
Figure 2-2
2. Point your camera at something interesting. Watch the LCD
or look through the viewfinder as you lightly press the
Shutter Release button. This button should be on the top
of the camera body, in reach of your right index finger —
or on the back of the camera, under your right thumb.
3. Press the Shutter Release button halfway down to let
Automatic mode adjust settings and fix focus. You may
hear the lens move and see the image adjust on the LCD
or in the viewfinder. Look for one or more boxes or brack-
ets around the areas the camera is focusing on. Those indi-
cators may turn green when the camera has focused, as
shown in Figure 2-3. (A few cameras indicate focus with a
green dot, or a red dot may indicate a focus problem.)
4. Press the Shutter Release button all the way to take the
picture, and then let go. Your camera may make a click to
signify the picture has been taken.

If you hold down the Shutter Release button, your
camera may take multiple photos at once. This is
called burst mode, which is very useful when there is
movement in the scene and you’re trying to capture
the changing scene in a series of photos, for example,
at a sporting event. Avoid holding the button down,
though, if you don’t want to take multiple shots 
at once.
Turn the Flash On and Off
1. If the scene is dark, the camera will adjust settings to brigh-
ten the exposure. The camera may also need to flash extra
light to take the photo. Some cameras flash automatically.
Look for one or more boxes or brackets around focus areas.
➟

Others allow you to turn the flash on and off. In some
cases, you manually open the flash to turn it on.
2. With your camera on, locate the Flash control, which is
usually marked with a lightning bolt (see Figure 2-4).
Watch the LCD or viewfinder as you press the Flash con-
trol to turn it on or off. A lightning bolt may appear on
the LCD to indicate the Flash is on; a lightning bolt with
a circle and slash indicates that the flash is off or unavail-
able as it recharges. See Chapter 4 for information about

hold. The LCD may display a countdown number of
the remaining photos you can take. Take lots of pho-
tos without hesitation — you don’t have any film or
developing to pay for.
Review Your Photos
1. Immediately after you take a picture, it will appear on the
LCD for a few seconds. That may be long enough to know
whether you’re satisfied with the photo. To review more
than one photo, press the Review button, which is often
a green triangle in a green square (see Figure 2-5). Your
latest picture should appear on the LCD.
If you don’t see anything on the LCD, the review may
be on your electronic viewfinder. Press the button,
which is often labeled DISP or Display, that switches
between the LCD and the viewfinder.
2. Use the left button to move to the previous picture you
took or use the right button to display the first picture on
the camera. Keep pressing left or right to move forward or
back through your photos.
3. With a single photo on-screen, press the Wide (W) but-
ton to display an index of thumbnails (smaller versions)
of several photos at one time, as shown in Figure 2-5. Use
the left or right buttons to select a picture and then press

1. To delete photos from your camera, put your camera in
Review mode (discussed earlier in this chapter).
Before you delete a photo, be absolutely certain you
won’t miss it — you cannot undelete a photo from
your camera without a computer and special software.
Practice by taking photos you intend to delete.
2. Move left and right through your photos to find the one
you intend to delete.

View Your Photos and Videos on TV
1. If your camera has a Video Out connection, you can use a
cable to show your photos and videos on TV. Locate the
Video Out connection on your camera. It’s a single
socket, possibly colored yellow. This connection is differ-
ent from the USB port and the external power connection.
2. If your camera came with a cable, connect the end with a
single connection to the correct socket on the camera
body.
3. The TV/DVD end of the cable has two connections.
Connect the yellow video cable connection to the yellow
video input on your TV or DVD player. See Figure 2-9. To
play movies or slideshows with sound, connect the black
or white cable to the white input on the TV or DVD
player (labeled Left/Mono).

Using Your
Camera’s Setup
Menus
Your camera has external controls for spe-
cific functions, such as the power button,
the Shutter Release button, and the Zoom con-
trol. Your camera also uses internal menus to
enable you to change settings that affect vari-
ous functions, making your camera somewhat
programmable. For example, from a menu, you
can specify the size of your photos in pixels
(dots). Large photos are great for printing, but
they are less useful for e-mail. Small photos
store quickly and take up less space on the
camera, but they limit your options for editing,
particularly cropping to emphasize a smaller
area of the photo.
Other menu options control the brightness of
the LCD (and, thereby, its power-consumption),
the sounds your camera makes, and more. Not
all cameras have exactly the same settings, but I
show you the most likely and most useful in
this chapter.
You might never need to change some of your
camera’s settings, or you may make a one-time
change. Take the time to consider your options,
and note what the original setting is before you
make a change. That way, you can easily
change back if you don’t like the new setting.

➟The left, right, up, and down buttons: Use these
buttons to scroll through menu settings and options.
These buttons often appear clockwise around the
edge of a circular button at 12 o’clock (up), 3 o’clock
(right), 6 o’clock (down), and 9 o’clock (left). Use
the up and down buttons to move between settings

circular button. Use the OK button to select a high-
lighted option.
Most cameras don’t have a Cancel button. If you
change your mind in the middle of a step, leave the
original option highlighted as you step back with the
left arrow or the Menu button.
As you explore your camera’s menus, be aware of these points:
➟Although a few functions are common and consis-
tently named, there is no single standard for camera
menus. Every menu is nearly unique in its options
and the organization of those options. There is more
consistency in menus between recent models from
the same manufacturer than between different manu-
facturers. Consider whether that consistency is impor-
tant when you buy your next camera. If you don’t like
learning new menus, you may want to keep buying
cameras from the same manufacturer — although
even a single manufacturer eventually changes menus
as new features are added.
➟The settings available on menus may change, depend-
ing on other settings. For example, Automatic mode
may have fewer menu choices than other modes —
after all, you want the camera to make more of the ➟
47
Chapter 3: Using Your Camera's Setup Menus

decisions in Auto mode. Movie mode may have dif-
ferent options from the other modes. Review mode
may offer unique menu options, such as to rotate or
resize a photo. Some cameras have two separate
menu buttons, in which case, one will bring up a
menu that applies to the specific mode you have set
and the other (perhaps, labeled Home) will bring up
a larger menu of all options regardless of mode.
If you can’t find a function on your camera that is
mentioned in this book, then your camera may not
have that function. Or, your camera may call that
function something else. Or, that function may also
be available only in some modes.
A function guide describes options on the LCD as you
make selections. If your camera has a function guide
or help, that feature is turned on automatically. You
may find a setting to turn this on or off. Leave it on
while you’re getting familiar with your camera.
Change the Date or Time
1. Press the Menu button.
2. Use the up or down button to scroll to the Clock setting,

3. Use the left and right arrow keys to move between digits
for the month, day, year, hour, minutes, and AM or PM.
For each number, use the up and down arrows to increase

and time helps you find and organize your photos.
Cameras know nothing about time zones or daylight sav-
ing time, so you may want to change the time setting as
needed.

➟
50
Part I: Getting Started with Your Digital Camera

3. Select an image quality from those available:
• The highest, finest, or largest value — up to the maxi-
mum megapixels for your camera — will produce the
largest photos. This is the best choice for printing and
editing, such as cropping an area of the picture. The
help message on the left of Figure 3-4 indicates 8M
(megapixels) is suitable for prints up to 11 x 17 inches.
However, each picture will consume more space on the
memory card than for a lower value. Larger files also
take longer to save and to copy to your computer than
small files take, although the difference is a matter of
seconds per photo. In Figure 3-4, selecting 8M displays
636 as the approximate number of photos the current
memory card can store.
• The lowest or smallest value will produce the smallest
photos, which may be ideal for embedding in an e-mail
or viewing on-screen, but not as good for printing and
editing. The help message on the right of Figure 3-4
indicates 3M is a suitable size for prints up to 4 x 6
inches. However, with small photos, you’ll be able to fit
more photos on your memory card. In Figure 3-4,
selecting 3M displays 1298 as the approximate number
of photos the current memory card can store. That’s a
lot of photos!
• If your camera offers a choice of aspect ratio (see Figure
3-5), that refers to the ratio of the photo’s width to its
height. Aspect ratio affects printing and on-screen view-
ing, including digital frames, as discussed in Chapter 15.
Differences between the aspect ratio of a photo and a
print may cause part of the photo to be cut off or blank
space to appear on either side of the print. A similar
problem can occur on digital picture frames or com-
puter screens. Many digital photos have a 4:3 ratio,
which is the same ratio as pre-HD (high-definition) TV.
➟
51
Chapter 3: Using Your Camera's Setup Menus

Some cameras, especially DSLRs, use the same ratio as
35mm film — it’s 3:2, which is the ratio used for most
standard prints. For photos that you intend to view on
an HDTV or a wide-screen computer monitor, a 16:9
ratio produces an image more likely to fill the screen.
Keep the standard aspect ratio until you find a reason to
change it.
In Figure 3-5, selecting 16:9 (HDTV aspect ratio) displays 677 as the
approximate number of photos the current memory card can store.

2. Select the File Type or Format setting.
3. Highlight one of these file formats, which appear in a list
like the one shown in Figure 3-6:
• JPG or JPEG: This option is the standard photo file
type. If you don’t have a file type setting, your camera
probably takes JPEGs automatically. The JPEG file for-
mat was designed for photographs by the Joint
Photographic Experts Group and is a good choice for
most photographs. Your camera may offer more than
one version of JPEG, in which case you should choose
the super-high quality, highest, or finest option.
• RAW: This option appears on some bridge cameras and
most DSLRs (see Chapter 1 for more on types of cam-
eras). The RAW format stores much more information
about the picture than does JPEG, such as more color
and brightness information. This extra info may be use-
ful with powerful photo-editing software to make
adjustments to your photos that aren’t possible with
JPEG. However, you’ll have to convert from RAW to
JPEG to share your photos with most other people. RAW
files are much larger than JPEG, so fewer RAW files will
fit on your memory card.
Figure 3-6
➟
53
Chapter 3: Using Your Camera's Setup Menus

• RAW+JPEG: This option produces two files at once. The
JPEG file is convenient and versatile, and the RAW file
expands your editing options. You’ll get even fewer pic-
tures on your memory card because you’re creating two
files per photo.
• TIF or TIFF: This option produces a file with more
information than JPEG but less than RAW. The Tagged
Image File Format can be used with more photo-editing
programs than RAW.
4. Press the OK button to save your selection.
If you have a choice of file format, use the finest or
highest JPEG selection until you learn more about
using photo-editing software in Chapters 10 and 11.
Fine-Tune Auto Focus
1. Press the Menu button.
2. Locate these options that change how auto-focus works:
• AF mode: This setting specifies whether the camera
automatically focuses only when you press the shutter
release (single) or continuously, which appears as Monitor
in Figure 3-7. Continuous AF assures you a quick focus.
However, continuous AF also uses more battery power
and may be distracting as you move the camera around
to frame the scene.
• AF Illuminator: Your camera may use a colored or an
infrared light to assist auto-focus in low light. This assist
light should be set to On or Auto. If you find the light
disturbing, you could turn it off, but you’ll have more
trouble focusing in low light. See Figure 3-8.

power, even at the brightest setting.
➟Power-saving: This setting controls how long the
camera will stay on if you’re not actively using it. You
may find separate settings for the LCD and the entire
camera. If you set this for too short a period, you
may have to turn the camera on more frequently. If
you set this for too long a period, you may be wast-
ing battery power.
To keep your camera from going to sleep while you
wait to take a picture, press the Shutter Release but-
ton halfway every so often.
➟Auto-review: This setting controls whether you see the
latest picture you took on the LCD immediately after
you take it. While the picture appears, you can’t use
the LCD to compose the next shot, so you may want
to turn this off or shorten the duration, if available.
Use the Review button discussed in Chapter 2 to see
any of the pictures in your camera.
➟Format Memory Card: This option prepares a mem-
ory card for use in your camera. Newly purchased
cards are preformatted and should not require further
formatting in your camera. You could use this option

W
ith camera in hand, you’re ready to go
snap-happy — and you should. Take lots
of pictures but show people only your best and
most interesting.
Photography is more than 150 years old. The
technology you hold is new, but you may find
long-established techniques and guidelines
useful as you take pictures. For example, posi-
tioning the subject dead center in the frame
may be dead wrong. And if it looks like a tree
branch is coming out of your friend’s head,
you should probably move to a new position
to take the picture.
Of course, you have at least one big advantage
over photographers of an earlier era: Your cam-
era has scene modes designed to take the best
pictures under different conditions. For exam-
ple, Landscape mode assures the whole vista is
sharp; Portrait mode focuses on the nearby
subject and blurs an otherwise-distracting
background. Use these scene modes to adjust
your camera settings quickly and easily.

Work with the Essential Elements of Photography
The subject is the reason for the photograph, as may seem obvious.
However, sometimes the subject is the entire scene, such as a grand
vista. Sometimes, though, the subject is a person, an animal, or an
object, and the surrounding scene is irrelevant. And, sometimes, the
subject is both an individual and the larger scene. I make this distinc-
tion here because your choice of subject affects how you take the pic-
ture. Do you move in close or back away? How do you position your
camera to frame the subject? Forgive the anthropomorphism, but how
does the camera know what the subject is? If the camera is mistaken,
will you get the photo you want?
Photographs capture a mixture of light and dark. Regardless of what
you see, your camera may record a scene that is lighter or darker than
what you expected it to be. Settings within the camera may make the
subject dark and the background bright or vice versa. Exposure is the
term to describe the brightness of the scene. The longer the exposure,
the brighter the picture. Your camera should avoid overexposing (too
bright) or underexposing (too dark) the photo, although you can use
either for artistic effect. Figure 4-1 shows a challenging exposure of a
high desert landscape involving light reflected off water and white sand
flanked by dark cliffs. The camera did what it could automatically.
The other essential element of photography is focus. As with exposure,
your photo may have some areas that are in focus and some that are out
of focus. With few exceptions, you want the subject of the photo to be in
focus, whether it is a person or object. Focus can be used to emphasize
the subject and to diminish the surrounding scene. Your camera can be
set to focus in the center of the scene or elsewhere, but most cameras
automatically focus on multiple areas within the scene. Look for indica-
tors on the LCD, such as one or more boxes around the area of focus.
Focus indicators often turn green when focus is set by the camera.
➟
62
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

Figure 4-1
Your camera is programmed to choose settings that will produce an
acceptable photo: one in which no area is too dark or too light and, in
most cases, the entire scene is in focus. This programming is a calcula-
tion based on averages. Although it’s very reliable, your camera’s pro-
gramming isn’t perfect. Keep reading to see how to improve upon the
camera’s capabilities through the decisions you make about the cam-
era’s settings.
Use Scene Modes
It’s hard to beat the simplicity of Automatic mode. Leave your camera in
Auto mode and let it take care of all the settings for you. However, you
➟
63
Chapter 4: Following Basic Guidelines

may get better photos by using the scene modes in your camera. Here
are descriptions of some scene modes and suggestions for using them:
➟Landscape: This mode often appears on the scene
dial as triangular mountain peaks. Use Landscape
mode for outdoor shots in which the entire scene is
the subject, especially for large areas, such as moun-
tains, fields, or cityscapes. The whole picture will be
well exposed with this setting.
➟Portrait: On the scene dial, Portrait mode often
appears as a round head over curved shoulders. Use
Portrait mode for close-up photos of individual peo-
ple or animals. This setting tends to blur the back-
ground of the photo for emphasis on the subject.
Landscape and portrait each have another common
meaning. Landscape orientation is wider than it is 
long — the way you normally hold your camera.
Portrait orientation is taller than it is wide, like when
you turn your camera 90 degrees. The orientations
and the modes are independent, although it is com-
mon to use them together.
➟Landscape plus Portrait: The symbol for this com-
bines the portrait symbol in front of the landscape
symbol. As you would guess, this mode is for photo-
graphing a person in front of a vista. Settings adjust
to evenly expose near and far.
➟Sport or Action: Represented by a running stick fig-
ure, this mode freezes motion, assuring the subject
will not be blurred as it moves. Use Sport or Action
mode for any moving subject, including wildlife.
➟Twilight: The twilight symbol may be a partial-moon
shape or a star. At the edges of the day, light is soft
and warm, and changes quickly. Use Twilight mode
to prepare the camera for less light outdoors.
➟
64
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

➟Backlight: Generally, a subject that is in front of a
light source, including light reflected by water or
snow, is difficult to expose properly. Backlight mode
causes the camera to adjust appropriately so that the
subject isn’t too dark or the backlight source too
overexposed.
➟Night Scene: Like Twilight mode, Night Scene mode
may be represented by a partial moon. The less light
available, the more time the camera needs for an ade-
quate exposure. Use this mode at night. Try to stay
still and keep the subject still until the shot is com-
plete. See “Use a Tripod” later in this chapter.
➟High Sensitivity or ISO: Usually marked with ISO
(for reasons that go back to film cameras), this is an
alternative to Night Scene mode for use outdoors or
indoors in very low light. ISO mode increases the
camera’s sensitivity to light, allowing other settings
that wouldn’t work in low light. Even a good expo-
sure may show dots or other artifacts called noise. See
“Use the Flash” later in this chapter.
➟Party or Indoor: I haven’t found a consistently used
symbol for this mode. Use this mode indoors, where
there is less natural light plus artificial light, which
tends to affect color in photos.
Figure 4-2 shows two examples of a scene modes dial.
Some cameras have just a few scene modes, and others have dozens of
these modes. In some cases, you may choose a mode, such as Landscape,
and then refine your choice further by specifying what kind of land-
scape. For example, your camera may have a beach setting that adjusts
for brighter blue or a snow setting that adjusts for extreme white. Other
cameras, like the one on the right of Figure 4-2, have a unique Scene set-
ting (SCN, in this case). You choose Scene mode and then select the
kind of scene you want from a menu that appears automatically.

Brains focus differently than cameras. When you’re
watching a bird in a tree, you don’t even notice the
twig in the foreground that the camera focuses on,
blurring the bird. Try focusing on another object an
equal distance from the camera to the subject, lock
focus, and then move the camera to the subject.
Compose Your Photo
Remember: It’s your camera, and you’re taking the pictures — anything
goes. Enjoy yourself. Above all, don’t feel constrained by rules and
expectations. That being said, here are a few considerations to compos-
ing a pleasing photo:
➟The Rule of Thirds: This venerable guideline suggests
that the subject of your photo should not be dead
center, nor should any lines that cross the entire
frame do so across the center. Instead, mentally
divide the frame into thirds horizontally and verti-
cally. Figure 4-4 shows a photo with the subject
placed according to the Rule of Thirds. A grid is
superimposed to show the lines. Here’s how you take
pictures using the Rule of Thirds.
• Position any major horizontal line crossing the
frame, such as the horizon, itself, along one of the
horizontal thirds. Put the horizon along the lower
third to emphasize the sky or along the upper
third to emphasize the ground.
• Position any major vertical line, such as a flagpole
or building, along one of the vertical thirds.
• If you have a specific subject — such as a person or
an object — the subject should be placed where
two of the thirds intersect — where one horizontal
third meets one vertical third.

see this very careful off-centeredness as interesting
and pleasing as well as emphasizing a subject
within the scene.
Figure 4-4
Your camera may have a grid setting that displays the
thirds on the LCD. This can be very helpful for apply-
ing the Rule of Thirds. Gridlines also help you make
sure the photo is straight.
➟Leading lines: Just as the imaginary lines of the Rule
of Thirds help you compose your shot, you can use
real lines to lead the eye across the photo. Generally,
➟

Chapter 4: Following Basic Guidelines

lines should lead from left to right and from bottom
to top. Lines may lead to the subject or merely give
depth to the scene, especially if they appear to con-
verge, like train tracks into the distance or the road in
Figure 4-5, which leads the eye into the center of the
photo and off to the left.

Don’t obsess, but the time spent composing a photo
may save time you spend editing it. Still, with photo-
editing software, you can transform a less-than-perfect
photo into a great shot. See Chapters 10 and 11 for
information about editing your photos.

Consider the Context
Most photos include something around the subject. Extreme close-ups
are a dramatic exception, where the subject fills the frame completely.
If you aren’t taking such a close shot, consider what you want to
include of the background and foreground, such as the following:
➟Avoid including distractions. For a photo of some-
one on a park bench, avoid including the nearby
trash can. Consider whether you want the whole
bench or just part of it — which is more distracting?
How much of the park belongs in the photo?
Including other park goers may distract the eye, but
omitting them may give a sense of isolation to the
subject.
➟Carefully observe the area between the camera and
the subject. It’s easy to overlook a plant or a stick
that may interfere with the focus or obscure part of
the subject. 
➟Consider how much space to include in front of
and behind the subject. Including more space in the
foreground creates more distance between the subject
and the camera. Angling the camera up slightly puts
the subject in the foreground but now includes more
space above or behind the subject. Move the camera
closer or farther from the subject or use the zoom for
a similar effect.
➟Scan the background beyond the subject for other
distractions. Look for anything that may appear to
stick out in a photo. For example, it’s easy to miss the
tree branch that will look like it comes out of some-
one’s ear. (Photo nerds call this a merger.) Move a lit-
tle either side of your subject to remove background
distractions. In Chapter 5, you learn how to blur the
background and foreground to minimize distractions.
➟

Chapter 4: Following Basic Guidelines

Observe the Natural Light
Outside, the sun should provide all the light you need for most photo-
graphs, even on a cloudy day. Immediately after dawn, the light is
golden; and at such an angle, it passes through plants, setting them
aglow. Very early, you can still catch dew or frost for highlights.
Clouds add depth and character to the sky and also diffuse the light for
a softer effect than what you see on a cloudless day.
The middle of the day, especially close to noon, presents harsher light
and starker shadows. Mid-day is especially difficult for photographing
people, who squint and fidget, or who hide behind sunglasses and
under hats that cast shadows over their faces.
Outdoors, people generally look best in indirect, even
light. Find a lightly sheltered spot that is neither in
shade nor in sun. Suggest that your subjects remove
their hats and sunglasses (although those do look
cool sometimes).
Closer to sunset, you’ll again catch that angle of light that passes
through plants and spotlights more solid objects, like the walls of
Chaco Canyon in Figure 4-6. You may find the late light warmer and
redder than at dawn. The waning light poses new problems along with
new opportunities. Remember to switch to a twilight or low-light set-
ting as it gets darker.
Night is not the end of photography outside. Look for different sources
of light, from the moon to the street light. Use a low-light setting, like
Night Scene or ISO. Keep absolutely still while you shoot.
You can use a flash (in the next section) outdoors to
help even out the light, if you can get close enough to
the subject.
Inside, you can use natural light as it streams in through windows, sky-
lights, and doors, especially if you can move the subject closer to an
opening. Watch out for backlighting, though: Put your subject with the
light source to one side or the other, but not behind the subject.
➟
72
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

Figure 4-6
Natural light indoors lends a warmth to the subject and avoids the
color distortion that often accompanies artificial light, whether incan-
descent (yellow) or fluorescent (blue). You may have to turn off your
flash to suppress it from interfering. Try Auto mode or any indoor or
low-light scene mode.
Use the Flash
1. Turn on the camera.
2. Press the flash button to choose one of these options:
• Auto: The camera determines how much light is avail-
able and flashes if exposure requires more light.
➟
73
Chapter 4: Following Basic Guidelines

• On: The camera flashes with every photo taken. This is
also called a forced or fill flash. Use this to add light to a
subject that is backlit. (In Auto flash mode, the camera
might not flash because, over all, there is enough light.)
• Off: The camera will not flash. For distant shots, such as
landscapes, the flash does no good, but Auto flash
mode might still flash.
• Red-eye reduction: The flash flashes twice. The first con-
tracts the subject’s pupils to reduce red-eye, and the sec-
ond flash creates the exposure.
A flash has an effective range of about 12 feet (check
your camera’s manual). Get close enough to the sub-
ject for the flash to reach the subject. If you’re less
than one foot from the subject, turn off the flash to
avoid blinding brightness and complete washout.
3. Compose your photo and take your shot. There may be a
brief delay before you can use the flash again.
If you leave your flash set to Auto, you let the camera
decide when it needs the flash. I prefer to leave my
flash off to avoid unnecessary flashes, but then I miss
some shots because I forget to turn on the flash.
Use a Tripod
1. A tripod allows you to shoot in low light, where even
slight camera movement may blur a photo. Extend the
legs of your tripod and lock them in place with the pro-
vided mechanism. The lock may twist or snap to keep the
legs from collapsing. Don’t trip over the legs as you move
around the tripod.
➟
74
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

For maximum comfort, extend the tripod so that your
camera will be at eye level. However, if the subject is
short or lower to the ground, you may not want to
fully extend the tripod. And to compensate for
uneven ground, you may want to extend the legs
appropriately.
2. Attach your camera to the tripod by screwing the connec-
tion at the top of the tripod into the tripod mounting
hole at the bottom of the camera body, as shown in
Figure 4-7. Tighten the connection securely but don’t
over-tighten.
3. If your tripod’s head tilts or swivels, make appropriate
adjustments to position the camera and tighten each con-
nection to prevent any movement.
4. Turn on the camera and choose an appropriate scene
mode. For landscapes in daylight, turn the flash off. For
portraits in low light, turn on the flash or set it to Auto.
5. Compose your shot. If necessary, move the tripod or
adjust the tilt and swivel. Take the photo.
6. If you’re going to take other shots with the tripod, you
may want to leave it extended. If you leave the camera
attached to the tripod, be careful to avoid knocking the
camera against anything as you move the tripod.
7. When you’re finished with the tripod, detach the camera.
Collapse the legs and lock them in place.
A tripod is very helpful for self-portraits or any photo
you want to jump into — you can’t do that with a
monopod (see Chapter 1). Set up the shot and use
the timer.

Figure 4-7
Shoot from Unexpected Angles
Everyone has a unique perspective. Change your perspective to see
things differently. In the process, you may discover a new angle on
photography. Here are a few suggestions:
➟Kneel, crouch, squat, or sit. If your subject is a child
or pet, get down closer to the subject’s level, instead
Screw the tripod
into the bottom
of the camera body.
➟
76

of looking down on the subject. And if you can’t
crouch down, it’s time for that yoga class.
➟Get way down for ground-level subjects. Flowers
and small creatures, like the box turtle in Figure 4-8,
look very different at their own level. If you can’t
crawl on your belly — and get up again — put the
camera on the ground or use a very low mini-tripod.
Figure 4-8
➟Get above it all. To shoot over obstacles or for an
interesting angle, stretch your arms over your head. It
helps to have a fold-out LCD that remains visible
when the camera is above or below eyelevel. Look for
safe ways to gain a little height, including standing
with your feet on the sill of your open car door. Look
around for nearby bleachers or steps to rise to the
occasion.
➟
77
Chapter 4: Following Basic Guidelines

➟Look for unconventional angles on the subject,
including profiles. People don’t look at the backside
of flowers, but with light shining through from the
front, the view may be quite interesting. Figure 4-9
shows a one-inch chocolate flower from the back.
Figure 4-9
Don’t get bent out of shape over these suggestions.
The slightest change of angle can dramatically alter a
photograph. Shooting from a car window or a chair is
still a departure from the standard 5' to 6' angle.

Taking Photos of
People, Animals,
and Flowers
A
portrait is a photo in which the subject is
a person, an animal, or an object. Often,
in a portrait, the subject is the primary interest,
and the area around the subject matters less, if
at all. In most portraits, the subject is an indi-
vidual, but a portrait could also be of a couple,
or a group of people, such as a sports team.
In contrast, landscapes, scenery, cityscapes, and
other large areas make for very different sub-
jects, as you’ll see in Chapter 6.
With portraits in mind, you want to emphasize
the individual. You want faces in focus, smiles
where appropriate, and a sense of the character
of the person and the emotion of the moment.
You can take portraits of animals as well as
people. A pet makes a great subject, especially
if you capture some aspect of its individuality.
Wild animals, including birds, reptiles, and
bugs, can make good portrait subjects, espe-
cially if your timing is good. Even flowers
deserve a good, tight close-up.

Chapter

You can follow the steps in this chapter using the most common con-
trols on your camera. In Chapter 7, you dig deeper into manual set-
tings to capture pictures you may miss under difficult circumstances.
Enable These Settings for Portraits
Before you shoot portraits of people or animals, check the following
settings, using your camera’s scene settings or menus. See Chapter 2 for
information on locating controls.
➟Portrait mode: This may seem obvious, but choosing
Portrait mode is probably a good choice for portraits
of one or two people. Portrait mode tends to blur the
background and those areas more than a few feet
from the subject, emphasizing the subject and dimin-
ishing distractions. When the subject is more than one
person or some part of the surrounding scene needs
to be in focus, though, don’t use Portrait mode — or,
if you do use Portrait mode, take another photo with
Automatic mode, as a backup. Figure 5-1 shows a
sample camera setting, plus a portrait with a blurred
background.

➟Face Recognition: With this function enabled, the
camera will identify faces in the scene. You’ll see
boxes around each face on the LCD or in the elec-
tronic viewfinder, if your camera has one. The camera
will focus on and then properly expose for those
faces. You may never need to turn off this feature.
Some cameras allow you to specify children’s faces or
adults’ faces as more important, and a few cameras
allow you to identify specific faces to focus on.
Figure 5-2 shows the camera settings and the face
recognition boxes around three faces. The fourth 
face on the left may not be recognized because of the
sunglasses, shadows, or the angle of the face to the
camera.
Figure 5-2
➟Smile Detection: Using this function goes a step
beyond face recognition and detects whether people
are smiling. When you use this function, pressing the
Shutter Release button may not take the picture
immediately, as the camera waits for smiles. Keep the
camera steady until the shot is complete. Using a tri-
pod helps when you use this function.
Face detection
Boxes around three of four faces
➟

Chapter 5: Taking Photos of People, Animals, and Flowers

➟Red-Eye Reduction: Using this function reduces
glowing red retinas caused by your flash. Your camera
may have a separate flash setting for red-eye reduc-
tion. If you end up with red-eye in a photo, you can
learn how to fix it in Chapter 10.
➟Flash mode: Although using the flash ensures full
exposure, it can create harsh shadows. Set Flash
mode to Auto to let the camera choose when to
flash. Set flash to On to force a flash to even-out the
exposure, even if the camera doesn’t need it, such as
shooting in a shady area on a bright day. Turn off the
flash to use only available light. Adequate natural
light works wonderfully for portraits. Figure 5-3
shows sample camera settings. The lightning bolt in
Figure 5-3 is the standard flash indicator. The symbol
to the left of the lightning bolt in the upper-right cor-
ner shows the camera recommends turning on the
flash (but it is on!). Each of the other symbols indi-
cates different settings, such as the full-charged bat-
tery in the upper left and the number of photos
(1298) that will fit on the memory card.
➟Burst mode: If Burst mode is enabled and you press
and hold down the Shutter Release button, the cam-
era will shoot multiple pictures in rapid succession.
The symbol for Burst mode is usually a stack of rec-
tangles, like several photos in a stack. Using Burst
mode is very handy when your subject is moving, or
when you’re trying to capture “that look” someone
gives you after she thinks you’ve taken the picture.
➟
82
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

➟Timer: Using a timer provides a delay between press-
ing the Shutter Release button and when the picture
is taken. Some cameras have short (say, 2 seconds)
and long (say, 10 seconds) timer settings. Press the
Timer button once for the longer time and again for
the shorter time; a third press turns the timer off. 
Use the long timer for self-portraits to provide plenty
of time for you to get into the scene. Use the short
timer to reduce the movement that may accompany
pressing the Shutter Release button; use the brief
delay to steady your hold on the camera. Figure 5-4
shows sample camera settings.

Shoot a Posed Portrait
1. Ask the subject of the portrait to sit or stand comfortably
in a suitable setting. It’s okay to strike a pose for the ages
in a formal portrait. Think about photos from around
1900 or portraits taken in a mall photo studio.
2. If light shines directly on the subject, ask her to move —
or move yourself — to place the light off to either side
over your shoulder. Avoid light shining directly in the
subject’s face or shining directly behind the subject.
3. Look on the LCD beyond and around the subject for
things that will be a distraction in the photo, such 
as poles or tree limbs that appear to grow out of the

subject’s head. Move a little to either side to change the
background behind the subject. Check for other distrac-
tions between the camera and the subject, as well.
4. If you want to minimize the background by blurring it,
choose your camera’s Portrait mode (look for a round
head and shoulders symbol). Some cameras have Portrait
mode variations, such as portrait in front of a landscape.
(Look for a symbol combining the portrait and landscape
symbols.) As I mentioned earlier, you can take a portrait
without using Portrait mode; try moving in close and
using Automatic mode, instead.
5. If the scene is less than bright or the brightest light is
behind the subject, set the flash to On to force the flash
and guarantee a good exposure. If your flash has a Red-
Eye Reduction option, choose that. If your flash doesn’t
have this option, though, don’t fret. Red-eye is very easy
to fix with photo-editing software. See Chapter 10 for
more information on fixing red-eye.
6. To help the subject relax, ask her to tell a story that doesn’t
require you to pay close attention — your mind is on the
photo, while hers should not be.
7. Use portrait orientation. Turn the camera body 90 degrees
left or right, to fill the frame with a person’s head or
body, while minimizing the space around the person. See
Figure 5-5.
Use landscape orientation — the way you normally hold
the camera — if you want to include the space around the
subject.

Take a Casual Portrait
For a casual portrait, take more time with the subject. Let her move
about and engage in some activity, such as cooking, gardening, hiking,
or watching someone else. Figure 5-6 offers an unusual perspective.
Figure 5-6
Here are a few other tips to help you capture casual, spontaneous 
portraits:
➟Get someone to distract the subject from noticing the
camera.
➟
87
Chapter 5: Taking Photos of People, Animals, and Flowers

➟Shoot from a distance, using a zoom lens to get close
without alerting the subject. Using a zoom tends to
blur the background, just like taking a close shot in
Portrait mode.
➟Photograph something else for a while (or pretend
to) so that the subject doesn’t expect a picture.
➟Talk to the subject if that relaxes her or if gentle direc-
tion helps with the pose. However, a casual picture
often depends on the subject forgetting that you’re
there.
Snap a Self-Portrait
1. Position the camera on a level, secure surface such as a
table, flat stone, or tripod. Avoid using an uneven or
unsteady surface.
2. Look at the scene on the LCD or in the viewfinder. Move
the camera — or zoom in or out — to include what you
want of the surrounds and to fit everyone into the shot, if
others are involved. Plan where you will sit or stand. And,
if others are in the picture, tell them exactly where you’ll
go so they don’t have to move when you join them after
you set the camera’s timer.
3. Set the camera’s timer. Look for a button labeled with a
dial with a second hand, as in Figure 5-4. Press the Timer
button. You should see the same time symbol on the
LCD. Use the longest option available to give yourself
time to move into the scene and settle into place.
➟
88
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

Some cameras have a remote control you can use
instead of a timer.
4. Just before you’re ready to move, press the Shutter
Release button. Most cameras blink a red light to indicate
the time is ticking. Move quickly but carefully to your
planned position. Smile!
5. You may see the blinking light stop. You may see a flash,
if the flash is on and the scene requires the flash. Wait a
second longer than you expect, just in case. 
6. If you have Smile Detection enabled, the camera may
delay longer until everyone is smiling. If you have Burst
mode on, the camera will take several pictures at once.
7. If other people are involved, have them wait in position
until you’re satisfied with the photo. Take another photo
just in case.
For a casual self-portrait, aim the camera toward your-
self while you hold the camera at arm’s length; then
snap a picture. Use the short timer, if you can’t press
the Shutter Release button at arm’s length. Don’t use
the zoom. With some practice and luck, the resulting
picture can be spontaneous and fun. You can also use
a mirror or other reflective surface, like plate glass or
water, for a self-portrait, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Don’t use the flash when you shoot close to glass or
mirrors — the flash will white out the shot.

Grab a Group Portrait
1. Pose the members of the group so that each face can be
seen clearly. Some can kneel or sit while others stand.
Arrange people on stairs, on bleachers, or seated on a pic-
nic table and benches to position them close together.
The closer together everyone sits, the closer you can get to
ensuring that everyone’s face will be recognizable.
2. If costumes, uniforms, or musical instruments are part of
the subject, make sure there is enough distance between
group members to show their paraphernalia.
3. Unless the group is very small and close to the camera,
turn off the flash because it won’t do any good. The use
of a flash in Figure 5-8, though, helps isolate the dancers
from the wallflowers.
4. For a large group, don’t use Portrait mode because some
of the group members may appear out of focus.
5. Although you can take a group photo without a tripod,
you may want to use a tripod if it will take a long time to
arrange people and set up the shot, especially if you’re
going to take several photos of the group.
6. Compose the photo on the LCD. Is everyone in the frame
and unobstructed? See the task “Shoot a Self-Portrait” ear-
lier in this chapter if you plan to jump into the group.
7. Take a couple of photos and review them before you let
the group disband.
As you get ready to take a group portrait, use your
zoom lens to catch casual close-ups of individuals in
the group or pairs interacting while they wait. Most
people won’t realize you’re zoomed in on just them.

Plan Photos at a Big Event
A big event is a great opportunity to take pictures of people. Birthday
parties, graduations, weddings, or sporting events bring people together
in celebration. Some events are very casual and comfortable. Others,
such as weddings, follow a strict itinerary that may limit your move-
ments but also help you plan your shots. Keep these things in mind:
➟Plan some of your movements. Where do you expect
people to be at various times in the event? How will
they move from one area to the next? How much
time will you have to photograph each stage of the
event? Weddings, as in Figure 5-9, provide slow, pre-
dictable progression, even as they limit your freedom
➟

of movement. (In Figure 5-9, moving in close
enough to use a flash might have evened out the
afternoon sun on the bride’s arms or the shadow on
the groom’s face. Not everyone welcomes the distrac-
tions a photographer can make. And, the bride had a
knife.)
➟Use your camera’s Automatic settings unless you’re
comfortable with the other choices. Better to blame
the camera than the photographer for missing a
once-in-a-lifetime photo. 
➟Use your camera’s Action setting for fast-moving
events, such as a game or a race. Look for a running
figure or other sports symbol.

Chapter 5: Taking Photos of People, Animals, and Flowers

➟Turn off the flash if it will be a distraction or if the
action is too far away to benefit from the flash.
➟Turn on the flash if the scene is in low light and the
subjects are close enough to the flash (about 12 feet
or less). If the background is dimly lit, using the regu-
lar flash will make the background seem blacker, and
you can use that effect to minimize the background
in low light. However, if you want the background to
show in the picture in low light, set the flash to slow-
synchro, which leaves the shutter open a little longer
to expose the background. Slow-synchro works best if
everything stays perfectly still; you may want to use a
tripod.
➟Use your zoom — if the scene is well lit — to get
close-ups without intruding. Using a zoom is less
effective in darker situations.
Watch out for other photographers so you can stay
out of each other’s photos.
Get an Extreme Close-Up of Flowers or Bugs
1. Turn on Macro mode. (Look for a button with a flower
icon.) Make sure the lens is zoomed out to normal
(toward Wide, W; and not Telephoto, T).
2. Position the camera close — ridiculously close — to the
subject. Without a macro setting, most cameras will blur
subjects closer than a couple of inches. When using a
macro setting, though, you may get a sharp picture with
the lens a fraction of an inch from the subject. Get in the
face of those posies! Watch out for a shadow cast by 
the lens or camera, however. (If your camera has a lens
hood — an extension to minimize light directly striking
the lens — remove the hood to avoid a shadow.) Back off
a little or change your angle.
➟
94

3. Capturing moving subjects, such as bugs, is trickier.
Figure 5-10 shows a lady bug larva that seems as large as
an oil tanker next to dozens of tiny aphids, but the larva
is only about a quarter-inch in size. Try to catch insects
and other small critters at rest or anticipate their move-
ments. Use Burst mode — hold down the Shutter
Release button — to shoot multiple shots in a row of
moving subjects.
Figure 5-10
Wind plays havoc with close-ups of flowers. Wait for a
pause or shield the flower with your body.
If you can’t get close enough to use your camera’s
macro lens, leave the macro setting off and zoom in,
instead.
Bag Birds in the Backyard
Birds are beautiful subjects, especially if you can catch one in a close-
up. Because birds are almost constantly in motion, though, you may
want to create a setting that encourages them to gather and linger. For
example, you could try any of the following:
➟
95
Chapter 5: Taking Photos of People, Animals, and Flowers

➟If you have the time and means, create habitat. Plant
trees and shrubs, especially those that bear fruit or
seeds that birds eat or that provide places for birds 
to perch, hide, and nest. Figure 5-11 shows a robin
carrying nesting material.
➟Hang bird feeders, suet, and seed bells close enough
to windows that you can get really close with a zoom
lens but not so close that you scare away birds when
you stand at the window. Most cameras focus
through relatively clean glass. If the glass is dirty
enough, or if you’re shooting through screen, the
camera may focus on the wrong spot.
➟Put perches, such as lattice, near food to encourage
birds to sit and pose.
Figure 5-11
➟
96
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

➟Put water in a shallow, wide pan. Birds will drink and
some will bathe. (Robins love to bathe.) Add water
every day and clean the bath at least once per week.
Add a bird bath heating element to your water source
in winter.
➟Use Burst mode to take several shots in rapid succes-
sion to catch birds in different positions.
➟Park a comfortable chair near a window with your
camera, binoculars, and a bird book nearby. Or look
outside every time you pass a window.
Capture Animals at Home and in the Wild
Animals are great photographic subjects. Many of us share our lives
with dogs, cats, and other pets. Depending on where you live or travel,
you may encounter less-domesticated animals, from livestock to the
truly wild. Here are some points to consider when photographing 
animals:
➟Turn off your flash. The burst of light will is likely to
frighten an animal.
➟Use your camera’s Action or Sports mode. Using
these modes increases your chances of catching ani-
mals in motion.
➟Photograph your furry friends. You’ll never tire of
these photos (although your human friends may have
limits). Catch your pet in a characteristic pose or
maybe something a little unusual (like the time my
dog, Lucky, tried to climb a tree).
➟Go where the animals are. That may be your own
backyard or a neighborhood park, or it may mean
venturing out into fields and forests. Figure 5-12
shows elk foraging. (Okay, I admit: I snapped that
➟
97
Chapter 5: Taking Photos of People, Animals, and Flowers

from pavement.) A reliable water source, such as a
stream or lake, usually attracts wildlife throughout
the day and night.
➟Stay safe. Rangers in Yellowstone National Park tell
of parents smearing peanut butter on a child’s face to
get a cute picture of a bear licking the child. Need I
say it? Don’t do that! Keep some distance from all
wild creatures for their safety, as well as your own.
Use a zoom lens to get closer. (Wildlife photography

Taking Photos of
Places and
Scenery
W
e are small upon the face of the Earth.
We move through landscapes that often
overwhelm the human scale. The land, sky, and
sea are immense subjects that warrant special
effort to capture in photographs.
Occasionally, the creations of humans rise to a
truly large scale: the pyramids of Egypt and the
Americas, the Great Wall of China, our best
and worst cities — all of which are big chal-
lenges to photograph well.
A hallmark of landscape photos is sharp focus
throughout, from near to far. Sharp focus
comes naturally when the subject (the focal
point) is far away, especially in a bright scene. If
the day is cloudy or the subject is close, you
may have more work to develop deep focus.
The settings and techniques for capturing the
large scale are the subject of this chapter. See
Chapter 5 for information on portraits and
more personal scenes.

Enable Settings for Scenery
Before you shoot pictures of landscapes and other large areas, check the
following settings on your camera:
➟Landscape mode: Of course, Landscape mode is a
good choice when composing landscape photos. This
mode sets the camera to optimize exposure in the
entire frame. Take a few shots in Automatic mode for
comparison.
Don’t use Portrait mode for landscapes. Portrait
mode tends to blur some part of the scene. For most
landscapes, you want every part of the picture sharp.
However, your camera may have a mode that com-
bines Landscape and Portrait modes for photos of
people in front of vistas.
➟Beach, Snow, and Night Sky modes: These modes,
which are suited for shooting large areas, adjust the
camera for difficult exposures (too bright or too dark).
Figure 6-1 shows sample camera settings. For the
camera shown in the figure, I select Scene mode (the
label SCN on the mode dial of this camera does not
appear in the figure). Then, I use the Menu button for
these settings: Twilight, Beach, Snow, and Fireworks
(from left to right). More scenes are available if you
scroll with the right arrow on the menu dial.
➟Panorama mode: A panorama is an image that covers
an especially wide area. For example, a normal photo
of the Grand Canyon may not do justice to the
tremendous expanse of its convolutions. The details of
a large building may be lost if you squeeze them into
a single shot. Panoramas are usually created by com-
bining two or more photos — sometimes as many as
half a dozen or more. If your camera doesn’t have a
Panorama mode, you can use photo-editing software
➟
100
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

to stitch photos together into a panorama. See the
task, “Capture a Panorama,” later in this chapter. 
➟Burst mode: Because Burst mode captures many
shots in rapid succession while you hold down the
Shutter Release button, you may not need it when
shooting (slow-moving) landscapes. Still, clouds
move, the wind rearranges the scene before you, and
even the light shifts from moment to moment. Burst
mode may help you catch a special moment.
➟Flash mode: Odds are that using a flash will be useless
for most landscape shots because a flash has a limited
range. However, if the flash is set to Auto, it may flash
even when it does no good. Turn off the flash for land-
scapes, unless you’re including a person or object close
enough to benefit from additional light.

Take a Landscape Photo
1. Select Landscape mode on your camera (usually repre-
sented by a couple of triangular mountains).
2. Press the flash button repeatedly until the flash is off.
3. If your camera has zoom capability, start at the widest view
(least amount of zoom) — press the W (Wide) end of the
zoom switch, not the T (Telephoto) end. (Most cameras
start at the widest view each time you turn on the camera.
A few cameras, though, remember the zoom setting from
the previous use.) See the task “Capture a Panorama” if
you’re shooting an especially expansive scene.
4. Frame your photo. If you can’t make out details on the
LCD, use the viewfinder, if you have one. Press the
Finder/LCD switch to toggle the display between the LCD
and the viewfinder. If you must use the LCD in bright
light, look for landmarks within the frame to help com-
pose your photo.
5. If the subject is the sky, including clouds, place the hori-
zon about one-third up from the bottom of the frame so
that you have one-third Earth and two-thirds sky. If the
subject is the Earth, including mountains, place the hori-
zon about one-third down from the top of the frame so
that you have one-third sky and two-thirds Earth. This is
part of photography’s venerable Rule of Thirds. You can
read more about this in Chapter 4.
6. Take a photo or a few. Consider moving to change your
perspective. Try zooming in slightly — press the T
(Telephoto) end of the zoom switch. Zoom in all the way
➟

for particularly distant shots. Figure 6-2 shows a land-
scape taken with the widest setting and again zoomed in
closer to the peak.
Some landscapes work well in portrait orientation,
where you rotate your camera left or right vertically
90 degrees. (Remember that portrait and landscape
orientations are not the same as Portrait and
Landscape modes.) A portrait orientation of a canyon
or ridge that recedes from you may draw the eye into
the picture more than the same scene in landscape
orientation. Mix it up.

➟Position the horizon about one-third of the way up
the frame — one-third Earth, two-thirds sky.
➟Don’t shoot directly at the sun, especially when using
the zoom — you’ll just fry something in the camera.
Place the orb off-center, one-third of the way from the
left or right edge of the frame or off-frame altogether.
➟If it’s light enough to see details around you, use
Landscape mode or Automatic. As details fade, try
the Twilight or Low Light setting. If it’s too dark to
make out details, use Night Scene mode.
➟If you’re shooting a subject in front of the light,
strong backlighting may cause the camera to underex-
pose the subject (making your photo too dark). If the
subject is within range of your flash (about 12 feet),
turn on the flash to force it to illuminate the subject.
(Auto-flash mode may not trigger a flash if the cam-
era is tricked by the bright background.)
➟Look in the opposite direction of the sun. Sometimes,
the best light at sunset or sunrise is on the objects
behind you, such as trees, mountains, or buildings.

Night offers real challenges for photographers. How do you capture
what little light there is from the moon or street lights? How do you
avoid blurring a photo in the process, which is a common problem in
photos taken in low light?
➟Use a tripod unless the area you’re photographing is
very well lit or in reach of your flash. The photo in
Figure 6-4 was taken with a tripod. Even an iron grip
might have blurred that photo, if taken hand-held.

may have an option called slow-synchro, which
adjusts settings to give more time to capture the

➟Use a monopod in crowded settings where your cam-
era needs extra stability but a tripod won’t work.
➟See “Capture a Panorama” if you’re shooting a partic-
ularly large building or other structure.
Capture a Panorama
Many large subjects, such as landscapes or a building, look puny in a
photo. Squeezing the full expanse of some scenes into one little frame
seems to squeeze the essence out of the subject. In such cases, you may
do better taking several pictures of portions of the scene. Later, in edit-
ing, you can stitch those photos together into one large photo that may
better capture the majesty of the original. The key step is to overlap
those multiple photos.
➟Begin a panorama by planning where you will start
and end taking pictures. You will take two to six 
photos in succession as you create the panorama. 
(A 360-degree panorama could involve a dozen or
more photos.) Each photo must overlap the previous
photo; that is, you’ll include 20 to 30 percent of the
same area in both photos.
➟Use a tripod or keep the camera very steady and level
throughout the shooting. Minimize vertical move-
ment as you move the camera from left to right or
right to left to take each shot for a horizontal
panorama. If you’re taking a vertical panorama (say,
of a tall building), minimize horizontal movement as
you move from the top down or the bottom up, over-
lapping each photo with the prior one.
➟

➟If your camera has a Panorama or Panorama Assist
mode, select that mode from the scene dial or the
menu.
Some cameras assist you in framing a panorama. You
may see a grid. You may see arrows indicating the
direction you should move after you take each photo.
Some cameras show a portion of the previous photo
as an overlay to help you align the next photo with
the previous. If you’re using Panorama mode, press
the menu or the OK button after you take the last
photo to turn off Panorama mode.
➟If your camera doesn’t have a Panorama mode, take
the individual photos as previously described. Be 
sure to overlap areas in each photo roughly 20 to 30
percent.
➟As you take each photo, don’t change any settings.
Don’t change the zoom, either.
➟Some cameras automatically stitch the overlapping
photos together to produce the panorama in the
camera after you take a set number of photos or turn
off Panorama Assist. With most cameras, you have to
stitch the photos together yourself on a computer,
using photo-editing software. See Chapter 11 for the
steps.

Using Manual
Controls
A
utomatic mode works well in many situa-
tions. When you choose a particular scene
mode, such as Landscape, you adjust the cam-
era’s settings further without much effort.
Many cameras have a few more modes you
may want to consider, though. With these
alternative modes, you may take better pictures
under difficult circumstances.
Using the functions in this chapter will open
new photographic possibilities for you. Not
everyone needs these options, but you may
find them useful. Even if you don’t ever use
these functions, reading about them will help
you understand and appreciate what your 
camera does automatically. Don’t be afraid to
experiment — after all, that’s how you learn —
but don’t try these functions for the first time
in a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Practice first.
Shift Out of Automatic Mode
Cameras use two major settings in concert to
expose a picture: the aperture size (lens open-
ing) and shutter speed. In Automatic mode —
as well as in all scene modes — the camera
adjusts both the size of the aperture and the
speed of the shutter automatically.

Consider the mechanics behind how these two work in tandem. First,
the aperture setting determines how much light strikes the image sen-
sor that records the photo. It does this by adjusting the width of the
lens opening. Then, when you press the Shutter Release button, the
shutter briefly opens to let light pass through the aperture. How long
the shutter stays open (the shutter speed) determines how long light,
admitted by the aperture, strikes the sensor.
Thus, the balance between shutter speed (how long the sensor receives
light) and aperture (how much light can enter during that time) — 
creates an exposure. Figure 7-1 shows the arrangement of lens, aperture,
shutter, and image sensor, each of which plays a role in capturing
images.
Figure 7-1
Shutter speed is typically measured in fractions of a second. (I say “typ-
ically” because a low-light exposure may use a full second or two.) A
shutter speed of 1/2 (one-half second) is open much longer (“slower,”
in photography lingo) than 1/1000 (one one-thousandth of a second).
A fast shutter speed (like 1/1000) leaves the shutter open for a very
short time; you can do the math and see that less light will enter.
Shutter speed is important, depending on what you’re shooting. For
example, in a bright setting, using a fast shutter speed makes sense so
you don’t wash-out or overexpose the shot. Too, using a fast shutter

➟

speed freezes action pretty well, like when you’re shooting sports. Flip
the table, and it makes sense that when using a slower shutter speed,
the shutter stays open longer and lets in more light, which is better
suited for low-light situations or if you want your subject to move
within the scene and create blur in the photo. Figure 7-2 shows the
blurring effect a slower shutter speed (on the right) can have on flow-
ing water.
Figure 7-2
Aperture settings are important, too, for creating a good exposure.
Using a wide aperture — a wide-open lens — lets in more light than
using a more narrow aperture. In a bright setting, a narrow aperture is
adequate; using a wider aperture might overexpose the scene, making it
appear white or washed-out. Conversely, in a dimly lit setting, using a
narrow aperture might underexpose the photo, making it too dark;
using a wider aperture would let in more light.

➟

Chapter 7: Using Manual Controls

Aperture is measured in increments called f-stops. In Figure 7-3, the
blue area represents the lens opening (aperture).You’ll see f-stops writ-
ten like f/2, but on the camera LCD, you’re more likely to see them
written like F2. The f-stops are fractions. F2 is really 1/2. F16 is really
1/16. And, so, F2 is a larger aperture, letting in more light, than F16.
Figure 7-3
Before you consider juggling aperture and shutter speed, there is one
more interesting property that aperture affects: depth of field. Depth of
field refers to the area of the picture that’s in focus. This isn’t the area to
the left or right of the subject, but rather the area between the camera
and the subject as well as beyond the subject. Shallow depth of field
means only a little of the area in front of and behind the subject will
be in focus, while anything outside that shallow depth of field —
closer or farther — will be out of focus or blurred. Deep depth of field
means that more of the area between the camera and the subject, as
well as beyond the subject, will be in focus. Using a narrow aperture,
like F16, increases depth of field; using a wide aperture, like F2,
reduces depth of field.
Visualize depth of field as a cone with the narrow end
at the lens, widening as you go out farther. For that
reason, the depth is not equal in front and behind the
subject (the focal point). Instead, the depth of field is
roughly one-third in front of the subject and two-
thirds beyond.

➟

Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

Because of the compact size of digital cameras, they
tend to have a greater depth of field compared with
traditional film cameras and larger DSLRs. Therefore,
it’s more difficult to reduce the depth of field with a
compact digital camera than with larger cameras. This
can be a bit of a mind shift if you’re used to using a
35mm SLR.
Recall that using your camera’s Portrait scene mode tends to blur the
background — and that’s attributable to a reduced depth of field.
Portrait mode makes that blur by widening the aperture. Landscape
mode, by comparison, keeps near and far in sharp focus by using a
more narrow aperture. By choosing specific scene modes instead of
using Automatic mode, you guide the camera to choose the appropri-
ate combination of aperture and shutter speed for the scene.
If nothing else, you should appreciate the scene modes at this point. If
you don’t yet, you soon will. Further, this helps explain why it’s easy to
take sharp photos in bright light: You can use a smaller aperture and a
faster shutter speed together, producing a picture in which everything
near and far is sharp and objects in motion don’t blur. In turn, it’s
more difficult to produce a sharp photo in low light with a wide aper-
ture and a slow shutter speed, both of which increase blurring. (Image
stabilization or anti-shake functions are less effective in lower light.
You may need to use a tripod.)
So, you have these two functions, aperture and shutter speed, that have
to be adjusted by the camera, or by you, as shooting conditions
change. As the scene gets darker, you need to use a wider aperture or a
slower shutter speed to avoid underexposing the photo. But, the wider
aperture reduces the depth of field, and the slower shutter speed
increases blurring of movement, including any movement of the cam-
era from unsteady hands.
Think about this for a minute: For the amount of light in any scene,
there is more than one combination of aperture and shutter speed that
will produce exactly the same exposure! However — and this is the
➟
115
Chapter 7: Using Manual Controls

trick — using different combinations won’t give you the same picture
in terms of sharpness throughout. For normal exposure, as shutter
speed increases, aperture widens: Action freezes, but more of the scene
may be out of the depth of field. As shutter speed decreases, aperture
narrows: More depth is in focus but motion will blur.
Two more variables affect depth of field. First, the
closer the subject (the focal point) is to the camera, the
more shallow the depth of field is. Every time you
move toward or away from the subject, the depth of
field changes. With a macro shot (an extreme close-
up), the depth of field may be fractions of an inch. If
the subject is far away (and how “far” varies with differ-
ent lenses), you get maximum depth of field without
any change in settings. Second, when you zoom in on
a subject, you reduce depth of field. So, in addition to
moving toward and away from the subject, play with
the zoom.
When you want to take control of aperture or shutter speed, choose a
mode other than Automatic. In Portrait mode, the camera sets a wide
aperture. In Landscape mode, the camera sets a narrow aperture. In
Sports mode, the camera sets a fast shutter speed.
For more direct control, your camera may also have these settings:
Aperture Priority mode and Shutter Priority mode. With either, you
directly set one and the camera automatically sets the other to assure
an adequately bright exposure. When you select one of these priority
modes, you use the up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease
numbers for the setting.
Imagine that you’re photographing a field of flowers. Here are some
creative options before you:
➟If you want the entire field in equal focus, use
Landscape mode or Aperture priority with a narrow
aperture (say, F8).
➟
116
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

➟If you want to freeze the birds and bees flitting
about, use Sports mode or Shutter priority with a
fast shutter speed (say, 1/2000).
➟If you want only a patch of the flowers in sharp
focus (surrounded by blurred flowers), use Portrait
mode or Aperture priority with a wider aperture 
(say, F2.8).
➟If you want the flowers sharp but the motion of the
birds and the bees artistically blurry, use Shutter
priority and a slower shutter speed (say, 1/250).
(Most cameras don’t have a scene mode designed to
blur motion.)
Or, wait for the light to change. As the sun sets, blur-
ring is easier — and harder to avoid.
Some bridge cameras and all DSLRs have two more
modes that involve setting aperture and shutter speed.
In Program mode (P), you choose from pairs of aper-
ture and shutter speed settings the camera will accept,
as the camera eliminates combinations that will
underexpose the scene. In Manual mode (M), you
have complete control over all settings, including
aperture and shutter speed. With Manual mode, you
can adjust settings in ways no other mode allows.
Set the Shutter Speed
1. You want to use a fast shutter speed to freeze action or
use a slow shutter speed for intentional blurring of figures
in motion (or to blur camera movement as you move the
camera to follow a moving object). To set the shutter
speed, choose Shutter priority mode on your camera’s
mode dial (S, SP, or Tv). That then lets the camera choose
➟
117
Chapter 7: Using Manual Controls

an appropriate aperture for an even exposure with that
shutter speed. (Remember: The camera’s choice of aper-
ture also determines depth of field.)
2. Use the up and down arrows on the camera’s menu
wheel to increase (larger denominator, like 1/1000) or
decrease the shutter speed (smaller denominator, like
1/2). When you increase the shutter speed for fast-moving
subjects (such as sporting events or wildlife), the camera
increases the aperture. This lets in more light to avoid
underexposure but also reduces the depth of field.
Decrease the shutter speed for still subjects in low light.
The camera reduces the aperture, which reduces the risk
of overexposure but also increases the depth of field. Your
camera may highlight settings in green (acceptable) or red
(not recommended).
3. Take several shots of the same scene, varying only the
shutter speed. (This is called “bracketing.” This is a man-
ual version of setting the camera in bracketing mode,
which I talk about later.) Then view these photos on a
computer screen to see differences that won’t show on the
camera’s LCD. See Chapter 8 for information on moving
photos to your computer.
Control the Aperture
1. You want to use a wide aperture for softening the fore-
ground and background and use a narrow aperture for
sharp focus near and far. Choose Aperture priority mode
on your camera’s mode dial (A or AP). Then, you control
the aperture but let the camera choose an appropriate shut-
ter speed for an even exposure. (The camera’s choice of
shutter speed determines the blurring of movement, if any.)
2. Use the up and down arrows on the camera’s menu
wheel to increase (smaller denominator, like F2) or
decrease the aperture (larger denominator, like F8). When
you increase the aperture to blur the background and
➟
118
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

foreground, the camera increases the shutter speed to
reduce overexposure. When you decrease the aperture for
greater depth of field (such as for a landscape on a sunny
day), the camera automatically decreases the shutter
speed to allow more time to reduce underexposure. Your
camera may highlight settings in green (acceptable) or red
(not recommended).
3. Take several shots of the same scene, varying only the
aperture settings. It can be difficult to see all the details in
a camera’s LCD screen, so look at these photos on a com-
puter screen to see the differences. See Chapter 8 for
information on moving photos to your computer.
Consider These Additional Options
In any mode other than Automatic, you may be able to adjust the fol-
lowing settings for even more control over exposure and focus. (On
some cameras, even Automatic mode allows you to adjust these settings.)
➟Metering mode: Most cameras have three types of
metering. (Figure 7-4 shows a camera menu item 
for metering.)
• Multi-point metering: Most of the time, you use
this type of metering, with which your camera cal-
culates exposure settings by averaging the amount
of light in numerous areas of the frame. Caution:
For a backlit subject, using multi-point metering
underexposes the subject, based on averaging the
light and dark areas.
• Center-weight metering: With center or center-
weight metering, your camera still averages expo-
sure for the frame but places more emphasis on
the exposure of the center 30 percent of the frame.
Center-weight metering exposes the centered sub-
ject better than multi-point metering, although
perhaps not bright enough.
➟
119
Chapter 7: Using Manual Controls

• Spot metering: If your camera has spot metering,
then only the center spot (10 percent of the frame)
is used to determine exposure settings. 
Figure 7-4
➟Focus mode: Most cameras have four types of focus:
• Multi-point focus: With this (most common) kind
of focus, the camera focuses on multiple areas
within the frame. This ensures that most of the
scene is in focus.
• Center-point focus: This type of focus allows you
to limit the focus to the center of the frame. Areas
outside the center may not be in focus, which can
be used as an intentional effect.
• Flexible-point focus: Flexible-point focus allows
you to pick an area for the camera to focus on. It
may be easier and faster to lock the focus on an
object in the center of the scene by holding the
Shutter Release button halfway down. Then you 
Symbol on LCD
➟
120
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

can move the camera slightly to reframe the scene
without having to use flexible-point focus.
• Manual focus: Manual focus leaves the focus
entirely in your hands. Choose manual focus and
then set a distance in feet or meters to the subject
you are focusing on.
Watch for brackets on the LCD to indicate the areas of
focus. When the camera is in focus, those brackets
may turn green.
➟Color modes: Use the following color modes to alter
the way the camera records color: 
• Normal mode: Color is not altered. 
• Vivid color (V) mode: This mode intensifies color,
making the colors brighter and — surprise — more
vivid.
• Sepia color (S) mode: This mode alters color to a
range of soft browns, like an antique photo. 
• Black and white (B&W): This color mode converts
all color to black or white. 
Remember which color mode you’re using, in case
you need to switch. Look for letters on the LCD indi-
cating which color mode you are using (other than
Normal). Generally, keep the camera in Normal or
Vivid except for occasional shots. Figure 7-5 shows a
Color mode menu item with Vivid selected.
➟White Balance: Use the White Balance (WB) func-
tion to adjust shots taken in a room with incandes-
cent (yellowish) or fluorescent (bluish) lights or with
a flash (intense white). White balance adjusts color
recording so that those off-white colors are closer to
true white.
➟
121
Chapter 7: Using Manual Controls

Figure 7-5
➟Exposure compensation: Use this function to change
the camera’s settings slightly for more or less expo-
sure than the camera chooses. In either Priority
mode, you adjust aperture or shutter speed in stan-
dard increments. Exposure compensation allows you
to fine-tune adjustments in smaller steps. For exam-
ple, for a photo of a crow in the clouds, the camera
might automatically try to darken the too-bright
clouds, making the crow even darker. Adjusting the
EV (exposure value) up increases the exposure. The
crow will be less dark, and some details in the bird
will be less obscure.
➟ISO mode: Use this mode to increase or decrease
your camera’s light sensitivity. For example, when
shooting in very low light without using a flash,
increase this setting. A higher ISO setting allows you
➟
122
Part II: Taking Better Digital Photos

to use aperture or shutter speed settings that would
otherwise be underexposed if using a lower ISO. For
example, at twilight, the camera might choose a wide
aperture or slow shutter speed for adequate exposure,
but either of those may blur part of the photo.
Increase the ISO to increase the sensitivity of the
camera to low light. Then you can still get a good
exposure with a faster shutter speed or narrower aper-
ture that would be underexposed at a lower ISO.
Unfortunately, using a higher ISO setting tends to
make photos look grainy (an effect that’s called
noise).
➟Bracketing: With bracketing turned on, your camera
takes multiple exposures each time you click the
Shutter Release button once. The additional shots
use slightly different exposure settings. Bracketing
increases the odds that you’ll get a decent photo
under difficult circumstances, especially if one of
your manual settings isn’t quite right. If your manual
choices are way off, though, bracketing can’t help
because it uses very small adjustments. Bracketing dif-
fers from Burst mode, which also takes multiple shots
at once but uses the same settings and only lasts for
as long as you hold down the Shutter Release button.
The settings you use when you take a photo are
recorded with the photo. You can review this infor-
mation later to better understand the effect these set-
tings have on your photos. Examine these photo
properties in Chapter 9.
Shoot in Black and White
1. Look for Color Mode or Special Effects in your camera
menu. Select the Black and White option.

2. Compose your photo. Pay particular attention to areas in
the scene that are very light or very dark. These areas will
be white and black.
3. Take your photo and review it on the LCD. Figure 7-6
shows a scene in color and then in black and white.

Avoid Problems with Light Indoors
1. Notice the type of light in the room when you shoot
indoors. Use your camera’s menu to change the White
Balance setting to Incandescent (for traditional light
bulbs) or Fluorescent, including compact fluorescent
bulbs. Figure 7-7 shows a too-yellow scene on the left,
with the white balance corrected on the right.

Moving Photos
from Your
Camera to Your
Computer
A
lthough you don’t have to use a computer
to enjoy digital photography, a computer
makes many things possible. Instead of labor-
ing over your camera’s controls to delete some
photos from its memory card or buying a new
memory card each time you fill your camera’s
old one, you can move your photos from your
camera to your computer and free up the space
those photos take on the memory card to use
for your next photos.
Photo organizing software enables you to
move photos from your camera to a computer.
Further — as the name implies — such soft-
ware helps you organize your photos, so that
you can find specific photos when you want to.
(See Chapter 9 for more information on using
software to organize your photos.)
With photo organizing software, you can easily
arrange your photos into folders or by name,
date taken, location taken, and so forth. With
the right photo organizing software, you can
also add titles, comments, and even ratings to
your photos.

Chapter

In this chapter, you select a photo organizing program and install it on
your computer. Then you use that program to copy your photos from
the camera to the computer, so you can enjoy them more.
Choose a Photo Organizer Program
Photo organizing software helps you manage your photos. With an
organizer, you can find, copy, move, rename, and delete photos. Most
organizers also include some photo editing tools, so that you can
rotate, crop, and fix photo problems — check out Chapters 9 and 10
for more on organizers and photo editing.
The following organizers are free or included with certain cameras or
computers:
➟Your camera’s software: Some cameras include a disc
with software for viewing, organizing, and editing
your photos. If a disc came with your camera, you
may want to install the included software. If you
decide to use a different program, you do not need to
install the disc that came with your camera or you
can uninstall the included software if you switch to
another program.
➟Windows Live Photo Gallery: This software is avail-
able for free as a download from Microsoft for
Windows XP and Windows Vista users. I show you
how to install and use Photo Gallery in this chapter.
If you have Windows Vista, you may already have
Windows Photo Gallery, which is the predecessor to
Live Photo Gallery. Live Photo Gallery has a few
improvements over the older program, including
more editing options. See Figure 8-1.
If you already have Windows Photo Gallery (the one
without Live it its name), you can follow many of the
steps in this book. If you run into something you
can’t do, then you can download and install the Live
version.
➟

Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

Figure 8-1
➟Picasa: This program is free from Google. Picasa is
very popular and a good choice as a photo organizer.
I think Picasa is slightly harder to use than Photo
Gallery because of the way Picasa presents its many
options. (As a nerd, I’d say, “Picasa has a busy, non-
standard interface.”) See Figure 8-2. Picasa does have
some interesting features beyond Photo Gallery’s,
including an easy way to add text directly to photos.
Google released a Mac version of Picasa just as this
book went to press, making Picasa the only free
photo organizer I know of that works on both
Windows and Mac. See www.picasa.com for infor-
mation and the download.

➟iPhoto: This program is included on Macs as part of
the iLife suite of programs. iPhoto is not available for
Windows users. See Figure 8-3.
Of course, there are other choices for photo organizers. A very popular
program is Adobe Photoshop Elements, which costs money, unlike the
programs I’ve already listed. Elements is a powerful photo editor with
organizer features.
You can use any organizer and photo editor or even
more than one. They all have some functions in com-
mon, including those covered in this book. I chose
Photo Gallery for this book because I use it every day.
Picasa has many options for viewing and editing photos.

Configure Windows Live Photo Gallery
1. Before you copy photos from your camera into Photo
Gallery, you should examine the settings the program
uses. If Photo Gallery is not running, click the Start but-
ton in the taskbar. In Windows Vista, type live gallery
and the program name appears in the menu, where you
can click on the program name. In Windows XP or Vista,
you can use Start ➪All Programs ➪Windows Live ➪
Windows Live Photo Gallery.
2. In Photo Gallery, use File ➪ Options. In the dialog box
that opens, click the Import tab at the top (see Figure
8-16). Use these options to control how your computer
copies photos from the camera, including where the pho-
tos will be placed and how the photos will be named.
3. Click the option to the right of Settings for and choose
Cameras from the list that appears.
4. Use the Import to option to specify a main folder on
your computer into which to copy your pictures. The
default option of Pictures is a good choice for most peo-
ple, but you can use the Browse button to select a differ-
ent folder.
5. Choose the Folder name option if you want Photo
Gallery to create a new sub-folder under the main folder
each time you copy photos from your camera. Doing so
helps you keep photos separated into smaller groups,
which may make your photos easier to find, review, and
manage. Photo Gallery offers various ways to name the
new folders it creates. See Figure 8-17. Most of these
methods prompt you for some text that will become part
of the folder name. Several options will also use the date
on which you actually copy the files as part of the folder
name. Other options use the date the photos were taken,
instead. 
➟
144
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

Figure 8-16
Here’s the breakdown:
• Date Imported + Name: With this option, the date you
copy (import) files from the camera to the computer
will be the first part of the folder name and the second
part will be any text you enter when you copy your pho-
tos. For example, if you copy photos on 9-14-2009 and
enter birthday when you are prompted, all the photos
will be in a folder named 2009-09-14 birthday.
• Date Taken + Name: This option creates folders using
the date the photos were taken plus text you enter when
you copy the photos. If photos taken on more than one
day are on the camera, separate folders will be created
Import tab
➟
145
Chapter 8: Moving Photos from Your Camera to Your Computer

for each day. For example, if you take photos on
5-18-2009 and 5-19-2009 and copy those photos on
5-20, entering birthday at the prompt, you’ll have two
new folders named 2009-05-18 birthday and
2009-05-19 birthday (and 5-20 is irrelevant).
• Date Taken Range + Name: This option also uses the
date taken and text you enter. However, photos from
multiple days, such as your vacation, are copied to one
new folder with the date range in the name. For exam-
ple, if you take photos on 5-18-2009 and 5-19-2009 and
copy those photos on 5-20, entering Colorado vacation
at the prompt, you’ll have one new folder named
2009-05-18 - 2009-05-19 Colorado vacation.
Figure 8-17

➟
146
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

• Name + Date Imported: This option puts the text you
enter first, followed by the date you copy the files to the
computer, such as birthday 2009-05-20.
• Name + Date Taken: This option puts the text you enter
first, followed by the date the photos were taken.
Multiple days create multiple folders, each with the
same text in front, such as Colorado vacation
2009-05-18 and Colorado vacation 2009-05-19.
• Name + Date Taken Range: This option puts the text
you enter first, followed by the range of dates the pho-
tos were taken. Multiple days are all placed in one
folder, such as Colorado vacation 2009-05-18 -
2009-05-19.
• Name: This option just uses the text you enter and
ignores the date you copy the photos or the dates the
photos were taken. However, you can enter date informa-
tion manually as part of the text, such as Colorado vaca-
tion. This is the option I recommend to most people
unless you feel strongly about including dates in the
name. (Photo Gallery makes it very easy to find photos by
date without including the date in folder or file names.)
• None: This option copies your photos into the main
folder and not into a sub-folder. If you take a lot of pic-
tures, this option does not help you organize your pho-
tos. If you don’t do anything, you’ll end up with one
huge folder stuffed with photos you’ve taken over the
years — the digital equivalent of the old shoe box full of
prints and negatives. I use this option, but I spend a lot of
time rearranging photos, manually creating sub-folders.
6. Regardless of the options you choose for folder names,
you can also specify how Photo Gallery should name
each individual photo as it copies it from the camera into
folders on your computer. Click to the right of File Name
to see the following options shown in Figure 8-18.
➟
147
Chapter 8: Moving Photos from Your Camera to Your Computer

Figure 8-18
• Name: The Name option uses the same text you entered
for the folder name, if any. Each photo also has a
unique number starting with 001. For example, birthday
001, birthday 002, and so forth. I recommend this
option for most people.
• Original File Name: This option uses the name your
camera gives to each photo, which is usually letters and
numbers, often the sequence number for the photo (for
example, DSC00047 or PB000047). I use this option
because I’m more interested in other information about
the photos. See Chapter 9 for information on tagging
photos.
Choose an option for naming each photo.
➟
148
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

• Original File Name (Preserve Folders): This option
also uses the in-camera file name and copies folders you
have created on the camera’s memory card. I don’t rec-
ommend this for most people because of the extra work
to create folders on the memory card.
• Name + Date Taken: This option uses the text you enter
and the date the photo was taken plus a serial number.
For example, birthday 2008-09-14 001.
• Date Taken + Name: This option uses the date the
photo was taken followed by the text you enter and a
serial number, such as 2008-09-14 birthday 001.
7. You’re almost ready to copy photos. You never have to go
through these options again unless you change your mind
about naming photos as they are imported. However, you
should consider the Other options on the Import tab (see
Figure 8-16):
• Open Windows Live Photo Gallery after importing
files: Check this box to start Photo Gallery automati-
cally after you import photos.
• Delete files from device after importing: Check this
option to have Photo Gallery delete photos from the
camera memory card after Photo Gallery successfully
copies those photos to your computer. This is a sensible
option to keep from filling up your camera’s memory
card and to spare you from having to manually delete
those photos on the card.
• Rotate photos during import: If you turn your camera
90 degrees vertically when you take photos, you’ll want
to rotate those photos to stand up correctly. Check this
option to let Photo Gallery try to rotate only those pho-
tos that need rotation. This option depends on informa-
tion the camera provides, so often it doesn’t work. You
can manually rotate photos anytime. See Chapter 9.
➟

• Change default autoplay options: This link opens a
dialog box to choose what happens when you connect

• Restore defaults: This button puts all options back the
way they were when you installed the program. You
shouldn’t need this unless you want to start over.
• How do I change my import settings? This link will

copy your photos from your camera (the next task).
You can also use the Settings for option at the top of
the Import tab of the Options dialog box to choose
settings for video cameras, music album downloads,
and CDs and DVDs. The CDs and DVDs option is
useful if you receive discs from friends or from a
photo processing service. For example, if you still
shoot film, some film developers provide discs with
digital versions of your photos.
Copy Photos Directly from Your

1. If you have a cable that connects your camera to your
computer, plug one end of the cable into the computer

the back (thin rectangular sockets), but you may also find
connections on the front of the computer tower or on
your monitor or keyboard.

If you have to use the USB sockets in the back, buy a
USB extension cable or a small box called a hub,
which provides additional USB connections. Plug the
extension cable or hub into the back of your com-
puter. Then you can more easily plug devices into the
extension or hub, which you place for easy access.
2. With the camera off, plug the other end of the cable into
the camera as shown in Figure 8-20. Look for the socket
on the side or bottom of the camera. The socket might be
covered with a small plastic or metal piece that slides or
pops open.

Copy Photos from a Memory Card to Your Computer
1. Instead of connecting your camera to the computer, you
can use a memory card reader to copy photos from your
camera to the computer. A memory card reader is a small
device into which you directly insert memory cards.
(There is no advantage in using a reader if you also have a
cable for your camera.)
2. Locate your memory card reader. It may be a small slot
built into the front or edge of the computer, as is often
the case with laptops. If the memory card reader is a sepa-
rate device, plug it into a USB port. If you haven’t used
the memory card reader before, Windows may install a
device driver the first time you use it.
3. With your camera off, remove the memory card. Open the
cover in the bottom or side of the camera. Some cards are
held in place by a small latch you move out of the way. If
the card doesn’t pop out, gently push in against the card.
Let go and the card should pop out partway. Do not pull
or pry the card out if it does not pop out when you push
and release. Gently pull the card out the rest of the way,
noting how it was inserted, so you can put it back later.
4. Gently push the memory card into the appropriate slot in
the memory card reader. Some readers have multiple
slots, so you may have to guess which slot to use and the
correct way to insert it. Keep your thumb on the card’s
label with metal contacts away from your hand. Push the
card into a likely slot until it clicks and stays in place
when you let go of it. If it doesn’t go after applying slight
pressure, take the card out, rotate it, and put it back in.
5. If the computer detects the card, Windows should run the
AutoPlay function automatically. You may be able to
choose Import pictures and videos using Windows Live
Photo Gallery. If you do not want to use any organizer,
➟
155
Chapter 8: Moving Photos from Your Camera to Your Computer

choose Open folder to view files using Windows
Explorer. Either Photo Gallery or Explorer may open
automatically without giving you a choice.
If you are using Photo Gallery with your memory card
reader, see Step 4 under the task “Copy Photos Directly
from Your Camera to Your Computer.”
6. If you are using Windows Explorer, it opens showing the
contents of your camera’s memory card, as in Figure 8-24.
You can copy any folders, but you may want to open fold-
ers until you see photos (start with a folder named
DCIM), then copy the photos. Select everything you want
to copy by pressing the key combination Ctrl+A (select
all). Press Ctrl+X (cut). You can use Ctrl+C (copy) instead,
but then you’ll have to delete the photos from the camera
later. Ctrl+X will move the photos, instead of copying
them. Open your Pictures folder by clicking on it on the
left side of Explorer or by using Start ➪Pictures. (If you
want a new folder for these photos, use Organize ➪New
Folder. Type a name for the folder and press Enter. Press
Enter a second time to open the new folder.) Press Ctrl+V

Organizing Your
Photos
A
s you amass more photos, photo organiz-
ing software helps you find and enjoy
them. Photo organizing software presents your
photos as one huge album, if you want to see
all your photos at once. You can look at a
screen full of small photos called thumbnails or
view any single photo larger.
With a click of the mouse, you can see just the
photos taken on a particular day or those pho-
tos you took at a particular event, such as a
vacation or birthday. View any group of photos
as a slideshow with the click of a button.
With the right software, you can add titles,
comments, and even ratings to your photos.
Such information may be useful if you need to
search for a particular photo, especially when
you can’t remember when you took the photo.
Further, you can use photo organizing software
to display photos by tags. Tags allow you to
easily categorize your photos, such as vacation,
birthday, or the names of people and pets in
the photos. These tags act as individual photo
albums, showing you just what you want to see
at the click of a mouse button.
In this chapter, you use Windows Live Photo
Gallery to view and organize your photos.

2. Your most recent photos may appear automatically. If you
haven’t copied your own photos to the computer, you’ll
see some sample photos. To view different photos, use the
Navigation pane on the left to select Pictures. Then
choose a folder under Pictures. You can instead choose
the year the photos were taken under Date taken. You can
then select the Month, if you want to see photos from one
particular month instead of the full year.
3. To view more photos onscreen, hide the Info pane by
clicking the Info menu item at the top of the screen.
(That displays or hides the Info pane, depending on
whether it was already showing.) Click Info as many
times as necessary to hide it. Alternatively, if you see the
Info pane on the right, you can also click the small X
at the top of the Info pane to close it (not the larger X
above it in the upper-right corner — that closes the whole
program).
4. To view one photo, double-click that photo. The photo
appears larger and the Navigation pane disappears, as in
Figure 9-2. You may also see the Info pane or the Fix
pane to the right of the photo.
5. To zoom in to enlarge the photo, click in the white area
of the slider at the bottom right corner of the screen. You
can also click and drag the slider control right or left to
change the enlargement.
6. To see the whole photo again, click the control just to the
left of the slider (not the red X). This button alternates
between reducing the photo to fit to the window area and
the picture’s actual size, which may be much larger. If you
are viewing actual size or have used the slider to zoom in,
you can use the mouse to click and drag in the photo to
move it around (pan).

Rotate a Photo
1. If you took a photo while holding your camera vertically
instead of horizontally, that photo appears onscreen side-
ways, so you’ll need to rotate it. Figure 9-3 shows a photo
before and after rotating.

Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

2. Select a photo you want to rotate in Photo Gallery. (This
works with thumbnails, details, or single photo view, as
in Figure 9-3.) At the bottom of the screen, click one of
the two curving arrows. The first arrow points left and
rotates the photo 90 degrees to the left, or counterclock-
wise, each time you click it. The second arrow points right
and rotates the photo 90 degrees to the right, or clock-
wise, each time you click it. To rotate the flower on the
left of Figure 9-3, I clicked the second arrow once to
rotate the photo 90 degrees to the right (clockwise). If
you click the wrong button or the correct one too many
times, just keep clicking until the picture is upright.
To rotate more than one photo at a time, first select
each photo by clicking the small check box in the upper
left of the photo in Details or Thumbnail view. Uncheck
any photos you do not want to rotate. One click of the
Rotate button rotates all the selected photos at once.
Delete Photos from Your Computer and Get Them Back
1. Odds are, you’ll take some photos you want to get rid of.
Photo Gallery makes this easy — maybe too easy. When you
click the button to delete a photo (or a hundred photos),
Photo Gallery doesn’t ask you to confirm the deletion. Take
that as a warning. Photo Gallery also can’t undo a deletion.
If you change your mind about a photo you deleted, you
have to use Windows Explorer to get the photo back.
2. Select a photo you’re willing to delete. Come on, it’s not
that hard! If you can’t part with any photos, take an
intentionally bad photo before you proceed and copy it
to your computer as your test case.
3. Before proceeding, be certain that only one photo is
selected because all selected photos will be deleted. To
confirm that you have only one photo selected, click once
on the photo you want to delete. When you single-click
anywhere on a photo other than the check box in the
upper left, you select only that one photo.
➟

4. At the bottom of the screen, click the red X between the
Rotate buttons and the slider. See Figure 9-4. (This works
with thumbnails, details, or single photo view.) Poof:
Your photo is gone immediately!
To delete more than one photo at a time, select each
photo by clicking the small check box in the upper
left of the photo in Details or Thumbnail view.
Uncheck any photos you do not want to delete. One
click of the Delete button deletes all the selected pho-
tos at once. That’s dangerous, but handy.

5. Practice undeleting or restoring a photo using Windows
Explorer, so you know what to do if you delete a photo or
other file by mistake. Open Windows Explorer using
Start➪Computer or, using the keyboard, press the
Windows logo key (which looks like a little flag) and the
letter E at the same time. On the left under Folders, click
on the Recycle Bin at the bottom of the folders. If you have
trouble locating your deleted photo, click once on the but-
ton labeled Date Deleted. See Figure 9-5. Click on the
photo you want to restore (or undelete). If the Properties
dialog box opens, click the Restore button. Otherwise,
click the Restore This Item button above the photo. Do
not click Restore All Items because that restores things
that you probably want to leave in the trash.

restore or hold down the Ctrl key as you click each
file. Then click Restore the Selected Items.
Watch a Slideshow
1. To view a slideshow, select the photos you want to see by
clicking in the Navigation pane on the left. Click All
Photos and Videos to see everything. Click Pictures to
see all your photos and none of your videos. Click on any
folder or date taken to limit the slideshow to just those
pictures. You can also select individual photos using the
little check box in the upper left of each photo.
2. After you have selected which photos to view, press the
F12 function key at the top of your computer keyboard or
press the Alt key and the letter S at the same time. You
can also click the Slideshow button at the top of the
screen. (You may have to click the >> in the menu to see
this button. Refer to Figure 9-1 if you’re having trouble
finding the >> button.)
3. After a brief delay in which the screen goes black, the
slideshow begins. Just sit back and enjoy the show. To
move forward or back through the slides without waiting
for the slideshow to change photos automatically, press
the left or right arrow key on the keyboard.
4. Move your mouse. You may see the control shown on the

Add Descriptions to Your Photos
Use the Info pane to add or change the following information to one
or more selected photos, in Details, Thumbnail, or Single Photo view,
as in Figure 9-7. If the Info pane does not appear on the right side of
your screen, click the Info menu item at the top of the screen to bring
it up. Click on one of your photos to select it. The information you can
change appears in black.
Figure 9-7
➟Add Caption: Click on this text and type in a caption
for your photo. You can use upper- and lowercase let-
ters, numbers, and spaces in the title. One reason to
title photos is that you can later search for photos
based on text in the title.
➟Filename: Click on the current filename if you want
to change it. The filename can be used to search for
and sort photos. If you have multiple photos selected
when you enter a new name, Photo Gallery adds a
number to distinguish them, such as my photo, my
photo (1), my photo (2).
You can change black text and rating.
➟
167
Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

➟Date Taken: You can change the date and time the
photo was taken. This is an odd capability. (By the
way, if you’re up to something nefarious, don’t count
on fooling legal authorities with this feature.)
➟Rating: Rate your photos with one, two, three, four,
or five stars (the best). You can use a star rating to
find photos. After you have rated some photos with
stars, you can display just photos with that star rating
or higher. See the task “Find Photos on Your
Computer” later in this chapter.
➟Author: The author is actually the photographer.
Enter your name here.
The remaining information in the Info pane appears in gray and 
cannot be changed here. However, information about the file and the
camera settings may be useful to you. Consider this information:
➟Size: How big the photograph is in bytes. Larger files
take up more disk space and take longer to send with
e-mail. You find out how to change file size in
Chapter 10.
➟Dimensions: This is the width and height of the
photo in pixels. Dimensions up to 800 wide x 600
high are good for e-mail. Dimensions up to 1024 x
768 are good for Web pages. Larger dimensions are
better for printing. You find out how to change these
dimensions in Chapter 14, as well.
➟Camera: Your camera records its model number with
each photo.
➟Exposure: This is the shutter speed used by the cam-
era for this photo, whether set automatically or man-
ually. You can learn more about the effects of camera
settings by observing this information on the photos
you take.
➟
168
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

➟Aperture: This is the size of the lens opening when
the photo was taken. These are fractions, so f/2 (or F2
on your camera’s LCD) is wider (more open) than
f/16, which admits less light.
➟Focal length: This number identifies the amount of
zoom in use at the time the picture was taken. For
the camera in this example, 5mm is the wide angle
setting and 15mm is the maximum zoom. (This cam-
era has a 3X zoom, because 15mm is 5mm times 3.)
➟ISO (from the French name of the International
Organization for Standardization): This number
describes the light sensitivity of the image sensor,
which records the photo. The greater this number, the
more sensitive the sensor is to light, but the lower the
quality of the resulting image. Standard ISO is 100,
and your camera automatically adjusts ISO as
needed.
For more information on how and why to change exposure (shutter
speed), aperture, focal length (zoom), and ISO as you take pictures, see
Chapter 7.
Add Tags to Your Photos
Tags are categories you assign to your photos, such as the subject or
location of the photo. If you took photos of city sights and wildlife
while on vacation in Canada, you might tag all the photos as Canada,
the city photos as Jasper or Banff, and the wildlife photos as moose or
sasquatch. With these tags, you can easily see just the photos of moose
or all the photos from Canada, among other variations. In a sense, tags
are like separate photo albums or collections of photos, except that one
photo can be in more than one collection.
Because any photo can have many tags and any tag can be assigned to
many photos, tags provide a very useful way to organize your photos.
With tags, you can quickly display a specific set of photos regardless of➟
169
Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

where on the disk they are stored. Indeed, photos in different folders
can be brought together using tags. In effect, if you use tags, it doesn’t
matter where your photos are stored.
One way to add tags to photos is to do it as you import them. See
Chapter 8 for information on importing photos. In the process, you see
a dialog box like the one in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8
Below the box where you enter text that will be added to the folder
name and filenames, you see another box for tags. As you enter more
than one tag, use semicolons to separate them. If you tag other photos
from other occasions with any of the tags you enter here, you can
quickly display all similarly tagged photos by clicking on that tag under
Descriptive Tags in the Navigation pane. Then click the tag you want
under Tags for photos with that tag.
If you see a photo under more than one tag, you do
not have more than one copy of that photo. A single
photo can be under many different tags. Don’t delete
a photo just because it doesn’t belong under a tag:
You’ll be deleting the only copy you have. Instead,
just remove that tag from that photo. (I tell you how
to do that coming up.)
➟
170
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

After your photos have been imported into Photo Gallery, you can tag
them anytime. There are several different methods for tagging in Photo
Gallery:
➟You can drag and drop photos onto the tag you want
to give to the photo. Select multiple photos using the
small check box in the upper-left corner of each
photo. Then click and hold down the left mouse but-
ton as you drag the photos to the left. Hover the
mouse pointer over the tag you want to give to the
photo(s). You’ll see a pop-up message that says Apply
(the tag you hover over). Release the left mouse but-
ton to finish the process.
➟Instead of drag and drop, select one or more photos
and display the Info pane by clicking Info at the top
of the screen. Click Add Descriptive Tags in the Info
pane and type a tag. As you type, Photo Gallery dis-
plays tags that match what you are typing, if any do.
You can type in brand-new tags this way or select an
existing tag from the list that pops up.
You can remove a tag from one or more selected photos. In the Info
pane on the right, hover over the tag you want to remove. A small X
appears to the far right of that tag. Click the X to remove that tag from
the selected photo(s). This does not delete the tag, which may still be
applied to other photos.
Under Descriptive Tags in the Navigation pane on
the left, you can click the right mouse button over a
tag to rename or delete it. If you rename a tag, say,
from friend to friends, that tag changes in every
photo it was assigned to. If you delete a tag, you
remove it from every photo that was assigned that tag,
but you don’t delete those photos or other tags. You
cannot undo deleting a tag from the Navigation pane.
➟
171
Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

You can even put tags under other tags. Under Descriptive Tags, click
Create a New Tag and type Southwest. Then click Create a New Tag
again and type New Mexico. Click and hold the left mouse button as
you drag the New Mexico tag over the Southwest tag and release the
button to drop one tag on the other. Now New Mexico is under
Southwest. Repeat the process for Arizona. See Figure 9-9. Tag one or
more photos with New Mexico and one or more different photos with
Arizona. You can quickly see all your New Mexico photos by clicking
on that tag. To see all your photos from New Mexico and Arizona at
once, click on Southwest. Again, the photos themselves may be from
different times and stored in different folders on the computer. Tags
bring them together.
Figure 9-9
Create categories of tags within other tags.
➟
172
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

Finally, Photo Gallery has a separate category of tags called People tags.
With a photo of people selected, you may see a link that says 1 Person
Found or 2 People Found (or more). Click that link to view the photo.
Photo Gallery draws a box around each face in the photo. (Sometimes,
Photo Gallery does not recognize faces that are at an odd angle or are
shadowed by hats or sunglasses. You can draw a box yourself around
any faces that Photo Gallery misses.) Click the box or the Identify link
on the right and select a name or type in a new name. Figure 9-10
shows the single photo view with the face box selected. If the selected
face is your own, click That’s me!
Figure 9-10
➟
173
Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

Using People tags is similar to using the other descriptive tags. You can
click on a person’s name to see all photos containing that person, no
matter when or where the photo was taken or where the photo is
stored, as in Figure 9-11. As with the other tags, you have to add peo-
ple tags manually. However, face recognition is advancing, and it’s
likely that a future update to Photo Gallery will use the people tags
you’ve already applied to guess who the unidentified people in your
other photos are.

Find Photos on Your Computer
There are several ways to find a specific photo or group of photos. Of
course, it helps if you are organized from the beginning, but, eventu-
ally, everyone has to search. Try these options:
➟Use the Search Box: The search box appears in the
upper-right corner of Photo Gallery. Type some text
associated with the photo you are looking for, such as
part of the filename or any of the descriptive infor-
mation you entered, such as title or comment. (See
the task “Add Descriptions to Your Photos” earlier in
this chapter.)
➟Use Tags: In the Navigation bar, under Descriptive
tags or People tags, click on the tag you may have
used with the photos you are searching for. This
option is most effective if you get in the habit of tag-
ging as you import and as you browse your photos.
(Click Not Tagged to see those photos without any
tags. Add tags to a few of these photos at a time.)
➟Use Date Taken: If you have an idea which year you
took a photo, click on that year under Date Taken in
the Navigation pane. Click on the month you think
the picture was taken. Under that month, click on the
likely day. This works best for memorable events like
birthdays, graduations, wedding, or vacations.
➟Look in Folders: In the Navigation pane, click
Pictures. Click any folder name that you think may
contain the photos you are looking for. The more
folders you have, the more of a needle in a haystack
this is, especially if you use generic folder names such
as Vacation or Birthday when you import your photos.
➟
175
Chapter 9: Organizing Your Photos

➟Arrange, Filter, Sort and Group: You may be able to
force the photos you are looking for to appear by
using other tools in Photo Gallery, as in Figure 9-12.
Click on the Arrange By button near the top of
Photo Gallery to sort by name, date, rating, type, tag,
or person. To the right of Arrange By, click the
Descending or Ascending button to reverse the sort
order. Farther to the right, you can filter your photos
by a specific number of stars you’ve assigned to them.
Click the box to the right of the stars for “and
higher,” “and lower,” or “only.” To clear your star fil-
ter, click on the words Filter By.

You can also click the right mouse button within the
photo area for options to sort files in more ways than
the arrange by button provides. Finally, you can also
group files. For example, I usually group by date
taken descending and sort by date taken ascending.
As a result, my most recent photos are first, but for
any specific day, they are in order taken (morning
first, evening last).
Windows Vista users can search for names and tags
from the Start menu’s search box or from the search
box in the upper-right corner of Windows Explorer.
Move Your Photos
1. As you import photos from your camera, you will proba-
bly place those photos in new folders according to the
settings you change in Chapter 8. Because Photo Gallery
shows photos regardless of their location on the disk, you
may never need to move the photo files to new locations.
However, if you want to, follow these steps.
2. Locate a photo in Photo Gallery that you want to move.
Click the right mouse button with the mouse pointer over
that photo. From the context menu that appears, choose
Open File Location. This opens Windows Explorer, show-
ing the folder containing that file, which will be selected
automatically.
3. If you want to move more photos, select them by holding
down the Ctrl key as you click on additional photos. Use
Ctrl+X to cut the selected photos. (Cutting actually moves
the photos, as opposed to simply making copies of them.)
4. Use the Folders on the left to navigate to a new location. If
you want to create a new folder, use Organize➪New Folder.
In the folder you want to move those photos to, press
Ctrl+V to paste the photos. Voilà, you have moved your

photos. The moved photos still appear in Photo Gallery in
the same way as far as date taken and tags are concerned.
Add a Folder to Photo Gallery
If Photo Gallery does not display photos that are on your computer,
you don’t have to move those photos to get them to show up there.
Instead, you can include the folder that contains the missing photos in
Photo Gallery in one of two ways:
In Photo Gallery, choose File➪Include a Folder in the Gallery. See
Figure 9-13. In the dialog box, browse to the folder you wish to include
in the Gallery. Select that folder and click OK. Photos and videos in that
folder will be included in the Photo Gallery. Note that you have not
moved the folder, just added it to those folders that the Gallery uses.

You’ve seen and changed information about your photos using the Info
pane in Photo Gallery. (If you haven’t for some reason, see the task

Touching Up and
Fixing Your
Photos
O
dds are that some of your photos can
benefit from editing. Whether the camera
or the photographer slips up, you can fix mis-
takes and accidents after the fact using photo
editing software. In the digital darkroom, you
can change a photo from blah to ah!
Perhaps you have a photo with something dis-
tracting from the subject within the frame.
Often, it’s not until you review a photo later
that you see a pole, a passer-by, or a tree limb
that ruins the photo. At the time you took the
photo, you could have zoomed in on the sub-
ject or moved to keep that distraction out of the
frame. After the photo is taken, is it too late?
No. You can crop a photo around the subject,
discarding distractions.
Cropping allows you to save a photo in which
one person looks great and another person’s
eyes are closed. Crop the photo to turn it into
a portrait of one.
A tightly cropped photo in which the subject
completely fills the frame can be very dramatic.
Or you might lightly crop the frame to shift the
subject a little to one side or the other. (See

The steps in this chapter involve using Windows Live Photo Gallery.
However, any photo editing software, such as Picasa or Mac iPhoto,
enables similar editing.
Choose a View
You work in Photo Gallery in one of two views: Gallery and Preview.
The view you are in may determine what you can do. Choose a view:
➟Gallery view: This view is the one you see when you
start Photo Gallery. Multiple photos appear in the
largest area of the window. Photos display with
details (see Figure 10-1), such as date taken and size,
or as thumbnails of various sizes (see Figure 10-2).
Hover the mouse over a photo for a larger thumbnail.
The Navigation pane appears on the left side of the
screen. Use Gallery view to see more than one photo
at a time and to select multiple photos by clicking the
check box in the upper left corner of each photo.
➟Preview: You open this view, which could also be
considered single photo view, by double-clicking a
photo. In Preview, you see one photo at a time. There
is no Navigation pane on the left. Use the next and

Back Up Your Photos
Many people are afraid to explore software because they may create a
problem they can’t undo. Even the most experienced computer users
make mistakes, a fact that may not reassure you. Photo Gallery has sev-
eral features that help you undo changes, as you will see in this chap-
ter. However, you may want to prepare for problems before you even
start Photo Gallery. Create a backup of some or all of your photos so

that you can recover from any mistake or other problems. Consider
one of these approaches to backing up photos before you make
changes:
➟Use a backup program: Your computer has backup
software you can use to back up large numbers of
photos at once. In Windows Vista, click the Start but-
ton and type backup for a list of installed programs.
Other programs are available for downloading from
the Web. A backup program provides many options
for selecting folders to backup to an external USB hard
drive, flash drive, or DVD. Most backup software can
schedule a backup to run regularly and automatically.
➟Copy folders directly: You can copy folders using
Windows Explorer (or Finder, on the Mac). Use
Start➪Pictures to see all your photo folders (unless
you have copied photos to some other location).
Insert a flash drive or connect an external hard drive
to a USB port. (Cancel Autoplay, if that dialog box
pops up.) Click the right mouse button over a folder
containing photos and choose Send To on the con-
text menu that pops up. See Figure 10-4. Your flash
drive appears in a list with other locations (look for
D:, E:, F:, and so on— your flash drive is probably
the last letter in the list). When you click on the flash
drive in the Send To list, the folder you selected is
copied to the specified drive. If you repeat this later
to back up changed files, Windows Explorer asks
whether you want to replace existing copies. For files
that you haven’t changed, you don’t need to replace
the copies. For files that you have changed, choose
Copy and Replace to replace the original with the
changed file or Don’t Copy to leave the original
alone and the changed file not backed up. Windows
Vista offers a third option: Copy, But Keep Both
Files. If you choose that option, the changed file has
the original name plus a number in parentheses, such
as my file (2).
➟
188
Part III: Editing Photos in the Digital Darkroom

Figure 10-4
➟Copy individual files as needed: Although Photo
Gallery makes it easy to copy individual files (see the
task “Make a Copy”), you can also copy individual
files in Windows Explorer. One method is to use the
Send To option described previously for individual
files. You can also select one or more individual pho-
tos in Windows Explorer and press Ctrl+C (copy) on
the keyboard, and then Ctrl+V (paste) to create a copy
in the same folder (or choose another folder on the
left side of Windows Explorer before pressing Ctrl+V).
If you create a copy in the same folder, the copy has
the original file name plus “- Copy” at the end.
Right-click over photo folder.
Choose your flash drive.
Click Send To.

Although you do not have to take any of these steps
in order to edit your photos, having a backup of your
photos provides peace of mind and additional
options if problems arise later.
Select a Photo to Edit
1. In Gallery view, select a single photo to edit by clicking
once anywhere on that photo except in the check box in
the upper left. This click selects one photo.
2. At the top of the screen, click the Fix menu item. Your
selected photo appears in Preview and the Fix pane
appears on the right, as in Figure 10-5.

4. For an alternative method, in Gallery view, double-click
any photo to select it and open that photo in Preview. If
you do not see the Fix pane on the right, click Fix at the
top of the screen.
Make a Copy
1. When you edit a photo, you do not need to save the
changes you make. Photo Gallery automatically saves
changes when you leave Preview. If you know you want
both the original and the edited photo, you need to make
a copy before you edit. Double-click the photo in Gallery
view to open the photo in Preview.
2. Use File➪Make a Copy in the menu at the top of the
screen. (This menu item does not appear in Gallery view.)
A dialog box appears with the folder selected that contains
this photo and a filename based on the original filename
plus a number in parentheses. See Figure 10-6. Click OK
to accept the current location and filename. Use Browse
Folders if you want to choose a new location. You can type
in a new filename if you want to rename the copy.
3. Any changes you make apply to the photo on-screen. The
copy contains the photo as it is before you make changes.
You can make a copy at any time and more than
once. If you want multiple versions of a photo, espe-
cially if you are experimenting with editing, use Make
a Copy between changes. However, you never have to
use Make a Copy if you never want multiple versions
of a photo.

3. In the Fix pane, click under Proportion for a drop-down
list of predefined crop areas. If you intend to print this
photo, the predefined areas listed in this box help you
choose a good proportion of width to height for printing
or displaying on a digital picture frame (4 x 6 is ideal for
standard prints). See Chapters 12 and 13 for information
on printing and Chapter 15 for information on frames.
Proportions matter less for e-mail or posting on the Web.
The Custom proportion lets you size the box any way you
choose.
4. Click the Rotate Frame button above the Apply button 
if you want to flip the crop box between horizontal and
vertical.
5. To resize the crop box, position the mouse over any of the
four handles (small white squares) in each corner of the
crop box. (If you choose Custom under Proportion, han-
dles also appear in the middle of each side of the crop
box.) When the mouse pointer turns into a double-
headed arrow over one of the four handles, click and drag
toward the middle of the box to reduce the size of the
area that will remain; click and drag away from the mid-
dle of the box to increase the size of the area.
6. To move the crop box over a different area of the photo,
position the mouse anywhere within the box (but not
over a handle). When the mouse pointer has arrow heads
that point in four directions, click and drag the crop box.
Move the box to include the part of the photo you want
to keep.
7. When you have selected the area you want to keep, click
the Apply button. Everything outside of the box is gone.

you undo one or more steps, you can redo any undone step. See these
buttons at the bottom of the Fix pane:
➟Undo: Click the Undo button at the bottom of the
Fix pane. (The Undo button is gray if there is nothing
you can undo.) Each time you click Undo, you undo
the previous change you made. Multi-level undo
enables you to click the Undo button repeatedly to
reverse a series of changes. Click the triangle to the
right of Undo for a list of all the changes you can
undo at once. See Figure 10-10. If you click on a
change in the Undo list, you undo that change and
all changes that preceded it. You can also undo all
changes at once using the Undo All item.
If you use File➪Make a Copy before you undo
changes, the copy has the changes and the photo you
are working on does not.
➟Redo: Click the Redo button at the bottom of the Fix
pane. (The Redo button is gray if there is nothing you
can redo.) Clicking Redo reinstates the previously
undone change. Multi-level redo enables you to click
the Redo button repeatedly to reapply a series of
changes you have undone. Click the triangle to the
right of Redo for a list of changes you can redo alto-

Fine-Tuning 
a Photo
Your camera determines the exposure — the
mixture of light and dark — of a photo,
whether in Automatic mode or with more
guidance from you through the scene modes
and manual options. Statistically, this process
works quite well, with the majority of photos
turning out neither too bright nor too dark.
However, using photo editing software, you
can adjust exposure that is less than perfect or
even awful.
By fine-tuning the exposure and colors of a
photo, you can save a photo you thought
beyond hope or simply tweak a photo to look
a little better. In the process, you may come to
wonder: What did the scene look like when I
took this photo?
See Chapter 10 for information on backing up
photos, making copies, and how to undo
changes you make to your photos.

black stripes in the center of the photo are more visi-
ble now, but the left edge is almost too bright.
➟Contrast: Use this control to increase (right) or
decrease (left) the difference between bright areas
and dark areas. With increased contrast, light is
pushed to one extreme or the other, making shadows
darker and light areas brighter at the same time.
Decreased contrast often makes details seem softer or
fuzzier. Figure 11-5 shows extremely decreased con-
trast in this photo. The black stripes are nicely visible,
but the entire photo seems washed out.

➟Shadows: Use this control to adjust darker areas sep-
arately from lighter areas. Move the slider to the right
to make darker areas brighter, as in Figure 11-6.
Unfortunately, pushing shadows too far to the right
(too light) produces some mottling and speckling in
this example. You may also see a halo-effect glowing
to the right of the switch plate because this setting is
pushed too far.
➟Highlights: Use this control to adjust lighter areas
separately from darker areas. In Figure 11-7, I’ve
reduced the highlights by moving the slider to the
left. This changes the texture of the wall and brings
out a bit of shadow to the right, along with some
halo-effect, if taken too far.
Decreasing the contrast too much results in a washed-out photo.

The controls for brightness, shadows, and highlights all brighten some
part of the picture as you move the slider right and darken some part
as you slide left. The contrast control increases the difference between
light and dark as you slide right and decreases that difference as you
slide left. I use the Shadows slider more than the others to adjust pho-
tos, but your photos or camera may be different from mine.
Figure 11-8 shows the effect of using all four of these controls together,
instead of separately. The combination is more effective, in this case.
Lightening the shadows too much causes the

Change a Photo’s Colors
1. To adjust color, view the photo in Preview with the Fix
pane showing. Click on Adjust Color in the Fix pane. The
panel expands to show three color variations:
• Color temperature: This slider adjusts color in the
photo from cool blue on the far left to hot red on the
far right.
• Tint: This slider adjusts the tint of neutral gray and
white. (In your camera, the white balance control does
something similar.) Use very small adjustments to estab-
lish true gray or white within the photo, which, in turn,
shifts all the other color in the photo from green on the
far left to purple on the far right.
• Saturation: This slider adjusts the intensity of color in
the photo. As you move the slider to the left, you drain
color from the photo. As you move the slider to the
right, you make colors more vivid. See Figure 11-9.
As you open panels in the Fix pane by clicking on the
text, such as Adjust Color, part of the Fix pane may
scroll off screen. Use the small triangles that appear at
the top or bottom of the Fix pane to scroll up or
down, or click the panel text to collapse the panel the
same way you expanded it.
2. Drag the sliders right and left to see the effect of each con-
trol. Small changes may work best. Use large changes for
artsy effects. Use Undo (and Undo All, under the Undo
button’s triangle) and Redo (and Redo All, under the
Redo button’s triangle) for before and after comparisons.

Straighten a Photo
1. Objects in a photo may appear tilted because you held
the camera at an angle or stood on uneven footing. If you
want to straighten a photo, preview the photo and display
the Fix pane. In Figure 11-13, the building appears to lean
because the photographer leaned back to take in the full
height of the Louisville Slugger.
2. Click Straighten Photo. Photo Gallery adjusts the picture
automatically and displays a grid to help you adjust the
photo further. (The Auto Adjust button also automatically
straightens photos.) The photo is automatically cropped
to fit the new alignment, so you may lose part of the
edges of the photo.
3. To change the tilt, drag the Straighten Photo slider right
or left to adjust the photo in either direction. Look for
strong, straight lines in the photo to line up with the grid-
lines. In Figure 11-14, I lined up the left edge of the
building and the first column of windows along the grid.
The left streetlamp in front of the building also lines up
with the grid. However, the more distant building still
seems to tilt. You can’t always fix perspective.

Printing Photos
at Home
P
rinting photos at home on your own
printer is convenient. A printed photo is
portable and handy to share with other people.
You can print your photos to take with you or
to send to friends and family.
Of course, printers cost money and so do the
materials — ink and paper — that go into the
prints. The best prints require special paper.
Printing also takes some work. The trial and
error that goes with learning new things can
make costs add up quickly. If you want to con-
sider other options for printing, see Chapter 13
for information on using a printing service.
E-mail, Web pages, digital frames, and portable
computers make it unnecessary to print every
one of your photos. Still, there’s nothing like
pulling out a few prints to pass around the
table.
See Chapters 10 and 11 for information on
editing your photos before you print.
Buy a Printer
Several different categories of printers may be
suitable for home printing. As you shop, be
sure to look for color-capable printers because
some printers are black and white only. Think
about the size of the printer and where you’re

going to place it. Your printer should be within six feet of your com-
puter, with easy access to add paper, and so on. Look at these cate-
gories of printers:
➟Inkjet: Some printers use liquid ink in cartridges.
These printers use tiny nozzles to spray the ink onto
the paper. Printed pages require a few seconds to dry
before handling. Typically, these printers have one
black cartridge for text printing and one or more sep-
arate color ink cartridges. Some cartridges are refill-
able, but most are recyclable instead. Inkjet printers
are fast, relatively quiet, and produce good results,
although ink may not be suitable for large photos.
➟Laser: Color laser printers are more expensive than
inkjet printers. These printers use a dry toner that is
melted into the paper. Toner cartridges cost more
than ink cartridges, but print many more pages. Laser
printers outperform ink printers in printing large
numbers of pages in a short time.
➟All-in-One: These multifunction devices include a
printer (usually inkjet), a fax machine you connect to
a phone line, and a scanner. A scanner makes the all-
in-one a copier, as well. Using a scanner, you can
convert old photos into digital files. Pictures in your
old family albums can enter the 21st century as digi-
tal photos.
➟Specialty: All printers print pages up to 8 1/2 x 11
inches. Most accept paper one quarter the size of a
full sheet, which is comparable to a 4 x 6 inch print.
If you need smaller or larger prints, look for a printer
that specializes in odd sizes. Other specialty printers
are very small, portable, and battery-operated.
You need a cable to connect the printer to your com-
puter. If a cable doesn’t come with your printer, you’ll
have to buy one separately. This is likely to be a USB
➟

cable, although some older printers use a parallel
printer cable.
Nothing lasts forever, but prints on regular paper
printed at home probably won’t last as long as top
quality prints from a printing service. If you are print-
ing at home for the ages, pay extra for archival quality
photo paper.
Set Up and Connect a Printer to Your Computer
1. Take your printer out of the box. Keep all the packing
material together until you know you won’t need to
return the printer. Arrange all the components for easy
access. In addition to the printer, you’ll probably find ink
cartridges or a toner cartridge, a power cable, and a CD
with printer software. Read the instructions for setup that
come with your printer.
2. Remove all tape from the printer. Most printers ship with
the print mechanism locked in place in some way. Look for
brightly colored tape, paper, or plastic indicating what you
need to move or remove to release the print mechanism.
3. Put the printer within cable length of your computer.
Insert the ink or toner cartridge before you turn the
printer on for the first time. Place some paper in the
paper drawer or tray.
4. Unless your printer’s instructions say otherwise, before
you connect the printer to the computer, insert the CD
into the computer disc drive. The setup program should
start automatically. Follow the prompts.
5. After the software setup ends, plug the printer cable into
the printer and into the computer. Turn the printer on.
You may see some informational dialog boxes or pop-up
messages as configuration completes.
➟

6. To confirm that your printer is installed properly, use
Start➪Printers. You should see an icon for your new
printer on screen. Click or double-click your printer icon
to open the program that monitors your printer’s activity.
In the menu, use Printer➪Properties (see Figure 12-1). At
the bottom of the General tab, click the Print Test Page
button. If a test page does not print, check both ends of
the cable and make sure the printer is turned on. Double-
check all the preceding steps and try to print a test page
again. Contact the printer manufacturer, the location you
bought the printer from, or the Web for more help.

Print Directly from Your Camera or Card
You can print in several different ways without using a computer. Each
of these requires that both your camera and your printer support the
same method. Before you use any of the methods listed below, look for
a print function on your camera’s menus. If your camera has a built-in
print function, you can select the photos you want to print before you
connect to the printer. If your camera does not have a print function
for selecting photos, your printer may have this feature. If neither the
camera nor the printer lets you select photos, you may have to print all
the photos on the memory card. (You may have hundreds of photos
on your memory card.)
➟Memory card slot in printer: If your printer has a
card slot for the type of memory card your camera
uses, remove the card from the camera and insert the
card into the printer. Put your thumb on the card’s
label and insert metal contacts away from your hand.
The printer detects the card. Use the printer’s menus
and screens to control how the photos print.
➟PictBridge: The PictBridge standard uses a USB cable
to connect cameras to compatible printers. Look for a
Print option in your camera’s menus and for the
word PictBridge on the printer. Connect the USB
cable from the camera to the printer. The USB con-
nection on the printer for the camera is different
from the one that connects the printer to the com-
puter; it should be in front or on top of the printer.
The printer detects the camera. Use the printer’s
menus and screens to control how the photos print.
➟Camera dock: A few cameras have a dock, which is a
small device the camera sits on or in. The dock may
be used to charge the camera, or to connect it to a
computer or printer. Connect the camera to its dock
and the dock to the printer. The printer detects the
connection. The dock may provide print controls.
Otherwise, use the printer’s menus and screens to
control how the photos print.

If you selected more than one photo to print, use the

3. You can simply click the Print button for a print of your
photo filling a full-sized page. However, use the options
along the right-hand side of the dialog box to specify the
size of each print. The number of prints that can fit on
one page appears in parentheses next to each size. Select
from these sizes:
• Full page photo: This option prints one photo per page.
The photo fills most of the page.
• 4 x 6 in. (2): Use this to print two photos per page (if
you select more than one photo or more than one
copy). This is a standard print-size for photos.
• 5 x 7 in. (2): Prints two photos per page (if you select
more than one photo or more than one copy). These
prints are larger than those from the 4 x 6 in. option.
• 8 x 10 in. (1): This option is the same as Full page,
unless you have changed paper size in the printer
options (see Step 6 for more on this).
• 3.5 x 5 in. (4): This option prints four smaller photos
per page (if you select more than one photo or more
than one copy).
• Wallet (9): Use this option to print up to nine small
photos per page (if you select more than one photo or
more than one copy). Each print is 3 x 2 1/4 inches.
• Contact sheet (35): Use this option to print up to 35
very small photos per page (if you select more than one
photo or more than one copy). Each print is 1 1/2 x 1

inches. The filename of each photo appears below 
the photo. This is a quick way to evaluate the print-
worthiness of a large number of photos at once.
4. Choose the number of copies to print in the box below
the photo, along the bottom of the dialog box. If you
want more than one copy of your photo, increase the
number of copies of each picture. (Type in a number or
click on the small triangles to the right of the number to
increase or decrease the number.) If you select more than
one photo in Step 1, you print this number of copies of
each photo. Two copies of three photos equal six prints,
of course. That requires six sheets of paper for full-sized
prints but only one for wallet-sized — with space for
three more prints. See Figure 12-3.
5. Uncheck and re-check the Fit Picture to Frame option,
watching how that changes the print preview. If checked,
this option expands the shorter of width or height of the
photo to fill the available space and eliminate any white
space around the photo. As a result, the longer of width
or height may extend beyond the edges of the print frame.
Unchecked, the entire photo fits within the available
space, but you may have blank space above and below or
to both sides of the photo. (This space is shown as off-
white around the photo in the dialog box.) Preview all
the selected photos with this option checked and, again,
unchecked. Use the setting that looks best for the selected
photos. For many photos, this option won’t make much
of a noticeable difference. However, for images that don’t
fit standard print proportions, Fit Picture to Frame cuts
off some portion of the print. Figure 12-4 shows two
photos with the Fit Picture to Frame option unchecked.
Both photos are acceptable, although the one on the right
has excess blank space on the left and right. For Figure
12-5, the Fit Picture to Frame option is checked. The
photo on the left is fine either way, whereas the other

photo shows the potential problem of fitting (filling the
frame). When the width of that narrow photo is
expanded to fit the frame, the top and bottom of that
photo are cut off. (The right-hand photo is also cropped
badly for printing as a standard-size print. See Chapter 10
for information on cropping photos.)

6. You may not need to change any of the printer options
that appear across the top of the dialog box. These
options are available:

printer) is listed automatically. If you have another
printer, you can choose it here.

• Paper size: Letter size is a standard 8 1/2 x 11 inch piece
of paper. If you are printing on other sizes, you may
need to choose a different paper size from this list.
• Quality: For the best prints, use the highest available
quality (marked HQ in these figures). The numbers here
refer to dots per inch — more dots make smoother
images. You can switch to a lower quality for drafts and
quick prints.
• Paper type: This choice may affect how your printer
feeds paper or which paper tray the printer pulls the
paper from. In most cases, you don’t need to change
this, even if you are actually using special paper.

If you intend to print on specialty paper, such as
preprinted stationery or photo paper, print a test on
regular paper, first. That way, you don’t waste special
paper as you get the options set the way you want
them.
7. When you’re ready to print, click the Print button. The
dialog box indicates a wait. Your prints should come out
of the printer soon after. The more photos you select to
print at once and the more copies you specify, the longer
this step takes, as Photo Gallery formats each print. If
nothing prints a few minutes after the dialog box disap-
pears, check to make sure that the printer is on and its
cable is connected. Use Start➪Printers. Double-click to

Using a Printing
Service
Y
ou don’t need your own printer to print
photos. You can take the photos to a local
printing service on your camera or CD or a
flash drive. This is especially convenient when
you’re traveling and want prints on the spot.
Ordering prints online is even more conven-
ient — you can do it in your bathrobe at 3 AM.
You can upload your photos to an online serv-
ice and pick up the prints locally or receive
them in the mail. However, it takes time to
upload photos from your computer to a print
service. How much time it takes depends on
the size and number of photos and the speed
of your Internet connection. If you use a slow
connection such as dial-up, you may be better
off taking the disk to a local photo printer.
The process of ordering prints online isn’t
much more difficult than printing on your
own printer. High quality, standard-size prints,
such as 3 x 5 and 4 x 6, often cost less than 25
cents each.
Your photo may not fit perfectly on a photo
print, especially if you have cropped the photo.
(See Chapter 10 for information on cropping.)
How do you fit a square photo on a rectangu-
lar print? Photo services vary in how they han-
dle differences between the dimensions of a
photo and a print. The print may have blank

space along the top and bottom or the sides to accommodate differ-
ences. In some cases, the service may cut off edges of the photo in
order to fill the print area completely. These adjustments often matter
little with snapshots, but may matter more for enlargements, such as 
8 x 10. Order some standard prints before ordering larger prints to
check how the service adjusts prints.
Print test copies at home using your own printer, if
you have one. Even black and white prints on plain
paper give you an idea of what the photo will look
like as a print. See Chapter 12 for information about
printing at home.
Prepare Photos for Printing
Before you print your photos, you may want to edit them first. For
example, you may want to crop the photo to emphasize the subject
(see Chapter 10) or adjust exposure and color (see Chapter 11).
Although printing services may allow some adjustment to your photos
as you order prints, editing photos before you order prints is easiest.
To make it easy to gather the photos you want to
print, tag those photos with a unique tag, such as
print, as you review them in Photo Gallery. At any
time, you can use Photo Gallery to display only those
photos with the tag you choose. This is much easier
than trying to select a few photos among many as you
get ready to print. See Chapter 9 for information
about adding tags to photos in Photo Gallery.
If you are going to print using an online service, see
the task “Order Prints Online.”
If you are going to carry or mail your photos to a service, copy the 
photos to a recordable CD or a USB flash drive:
➟To create a CD of photos in Photo Gallery, see the
task “Copy Photos to a CD.”
➟
240

➟To create a CD of photos using Windows Explorer,
use Start➪Pictures. Browse to the folder containing
the photos you intend to print. Select your photos
using check boxes or by holding down the Ctrl key as
you select additional photos. Click the Burn button
in the toolbar at the top of Windows Explorer. From
this point, the process is identical in the Photo
Gallery and Windows Explorer. See the task “Copy
Photos to a CD.”
➟To copy photos to a USB flash drive, use Windows
Explorer to select your photos. Click the right mouse
button over one of the selected photos. Choose Send
To, and then highlight your USB flash drive in the
list, which is probably the highest letter, such as F:.
After copying ends, remove your flash drive.
You can use these same techniques to prepare a 
disc or flash drive to send to family or friends. See
Chapter 16 for information on creating a DVD
slideshow, which is suitable for sharing but not for
printing.
Copy Photos to a CD
1. In order to copy photos to CD, buy recordable CDs at an
office supply store or any store that sells electronics. CD-R
(recordable) is inexpensive and readable by all types of
machines. CD-RW (re-writable) makes it easy to add and
remove files from the CD, but may not be readable in as
many machines as CD-R. Recordable DVDs are also avail-
able. Don’t buy DVDs unless you know your computer can
record DVDs (that’s not the same as playing them) and
you know that you need the greater capacity. A standard
CD holds at least 200 photos. A DVD holds almost 10
times as many. That’s a lot of prints!

photo found. You may have to select each photo you
want to print using a touch screen. Look for check marks
over the photos. Press your finger on a check mark or
check box to change your selection.
3. After you select your photos, the kiosk may offer an
option to edit those photos. Even if you have already
edited your photos, you can use the preview in the kiosk’s
edit process to confirm that the way your photos will
print is acceptable. If necessary, use the kiosk’s menus to
resize, crop, rotate, or move each photo within the print
frame.
4. After selecting and editing, specify the size of each print
and the number of prints you want. You may also have
options for special printing, such as glossy, which has
brighter colors, versus flat matte, which resists fingerprints.
5. Some kiosks offer a choice between using the kiosk’s own
internal printer or using the store’s larger photo printing
machine. The store’s larger printer produces better quality
prints.

Sharing Photos
on the Internet
You don’t need to print photos to share
them with family and friends. E-mail and
Web-based photo sharing services make it easy
to share your photos one at a time or by the
proverbial shoebox-full.
Attach a photo to an e-mail message and send
it to someone special or to everyone in your
address book. A photo in the inbox can
brighten anyone’s day.
To share more photos with more people, use a
photo sharing service on the Web. You can
mark photos as private to limit who can see
them or make your photos public for the
whole world to see.
Attach Photos to E-Mail 
with Photo Gallery
1. You can use Photo Gallery to attach pho-
tos to e-mail, if your e-mail program runs
on your computer, such as AOL or
Outlook. Use Start➪All Programs➪
Windows Live Photo Gallery. Find the
photo you want to attach to e-mail. (Use
tags, date taken, or the search box in the
upper right corner to locate your photo.)

You can select more than one file before clicking
E-mail. Click the check box in the upper left corner of
each photo you want to attach to one e-mail message.
3. Click the Photo Size option. The sizes that appear show
width and height in pixels. Pick one of the following sizes:
• Smaller: 640 x 480: This size fits almost any screen
(except for handheld devices, such as cell phones).
• Small: 800 x 600: This size is also suitable for an e-mail
attachment. Use this size in most cases for photos you
don’t expect the recipient to print.
• Medium: 1024 x 768: Although this size shows more
detail in the photo than the smaller sizes, the entire
photo may not fit within the area of the recipient’s
screen. Larger sizes may require the recipient to scroll
the screen to see the entire photo.
• Large: 1280 x 1024: This size may be too large for most
e-mail attachments. However, if the recipient might
print the photo, use this larger size or original.
• Original size: This unaltered size is most appropriate if
the recipient might print the photo. This size also results
in the largest total estimated size, which takes longer to
send and receive than the other sizes. File size is espe-
cially important if you or the recipient has a slow
Internet connection, such as dial-up.
4. Click the Attach button. You may briefly see another dia-
log box as a copy of your photo is created and your e-mail
program starts. (If your e-mail program doesn’t start, see

5. Complete the e-mail message and click the Send button.
Some e-mail programs display attached photos on-
screen with the message. Other e-mail programs
require the recipient to open the attachment separately.
These are issues with the recipient’s e-mail program
and may be beyond your control.
Resize Photos for E-Mail
1. If you use Web-based e-mail, such as Gmail or Yahoo!
Mail, Photo Gallery can’t automatically attach a resized
photo to an e-mail message. You can resize the photo in
one step and then attach it to e-mail using any e-mail
program. In Photo Gallery, you have to be in Gallery view
to resize a photo, so, if you are in Preview, click Back to
Gallery.
You may have other reasons than e-mail for resizing a
photo. For example, you could resize photos before
copying them to a digital picture frame, if you want to
fit more photos on the frame.
2. In Gallery view, click the right mouse button over the
photo you want to resize. The Resize dialog box appears.
See Figure 14-2.
3. Click under Select a Size for a drop-down list. Consider
these options that measure the longest side (width or
height) of the photo in pixels:
• Smaller: 640: This size is adequate for photos you
intend to attach to an e-mail message.
• Small: 800: This slightly larger photo is also suitable for
e-mail.

Choose a Photo Sharing Service
Use a Web-based photo sharing service to share your photos with
friends, family, or the world. Photo sharing services enable you to eas-
ily upload photos, to categorize your photos with tags, and to organize
your photos into online albums or galleries. Choose from one of these
popular services, each of which has free accounts:
➟Flickr: Flickr has a large and active community
worldwide. Flickr sets the standard against which
other services are judged. It is a good choice for most
people. See www.flickr.com.
➟Microsoft Live Photos: This is a part of Microsoft’s
online suite of services, including search, blogging,
and e-mail. Although Photo Gallery connects to
Microsoft Live Photos, it can also connect to Flickr.
See http://photos.live.com/.
➟Google Photos: This is part of Google’s online suite
of services, including search and e-mail. Although
Google’s photo organizer, Picasa, connects to Google
Photos, it can also connect to Flickr. See
http://picasaweb.google.com/.
➟Facebook, Myspace, and others: Many people have
accounts with so-called “social-networking” Web
sites. Most of these sites have places for photos. Such
sites can be great for staying current with the daily
activities of family and friends around the world.
Many photo printing services enable you to share
your photos online, as well. This may be an especially
attractive option if you want to allow others to order
prints and pay for their own prints from your photos.
See Chapter 13 for information about photo printing
services.

Enjoying Digital
Picture Frames
D
igital picture frames give you another
option for enjoying and sharing your
photos. A digital picture frame presents a con-
tinuous slideshow. You can display your pho-
tos in your home or office without needing a
computer.
Digital frames may soon replace the photo
albums of yesteryear. One frame, using a mem-
ory card from your camera or computer, may
hold hundreds of photos. With a push of a
button, thumbnails display to allow you to
pick a photo to fill the screen. Other buttons
enable you to flip through your photos as eas-
ily as flipping the pages of an album.
The number of frame manufacturers and mod-
els has increased tremendously in just a few
years. At the same time, good frames cost less
than ever. Unfortunately, choosing a frame is
complicated by a wide variation in features, as
you see in this chapter.
You may find good deals on frames online, but
it is very hard to judge a frame without seeing
it in use. Visit an office supply or discount elec-
tronics store to compare frames. Figure 15-1
shows two frames.

Select a Digital Picture Frame
As with cameras, there are many features to consider when shopping
for a digital picture frame. A few of these features are essential consid-
erations, whereas other features may be less important to you.
If you have access to a computer, search the Web 
for digital picture frame reviews. One good site is

Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos

Among the most important considerations are the following:
➟Screen dimensions: The display area of a frame is
usually smaller than the overall dimensions of the
frame, which includes a border or mat that may be
anywhere from less than an inch around up to a few
inches. A large frame may have a small display area.
The display area is measured diagonally in inches. A
7” display area is comparable to a standard 4 x 6
print. A display area 7” or smaller might be ideal on a
desk or by the phone. For a frame that will sit on a
table or shelf, 8” or greater may be better. Frames with
a display area greater than 10” are more expensive and
tend to have more features than many people need.
➟Screen resolution: Resolution is measured in pixels
(dots) for width and height. High resolution is indi-
cated by bigger numbers. Good resolution ranges
from 800 x 600 to 1024 x 768. Resolutions below
that range may not be sharp enough.
As you compare two frames, consider both the diago-
nal measure and the resolution. If two frames have
the same diagonal measurement, the one with the
higher resolution should be sharper and clearer.
➟Aspect ratio: Your eyes may glaze over at this term,
but it is no less important than the preceding fea-
tures. Aspect ratio refers to width versus height. Most
digital cameras take photos with a 4:3 aspect ratio.
(That’s the same ratio as TV before digital.) Both 
800 x 600 and 1024 x 768 are 4:3, which makes
those resolutions ideal for most digital photos. Some
frames display photos at a higher ratio of 16:9, which
is wider than the other ratio. (That’s the same ratio as
high-definition digital TV.) When a photo with one
ratio displays on a frame with another ratio, some-
thing’s gotta give. Most frames put black borders
around part of a photo to make the adjustment,
➟
281
Chapter 15: Enjoying Digital Picture Frames

padding the difference in width or height. Some
frames may adjust the photo to fit the frame if the
photo and frame have different aspect ratios. If the
frame adjusts the photo, there is a chance for distor-
tion or for the edges of the photo to be cut off. Look
for frames with the 4:3 aspect ratio or, if your camera
and frame both have 16:9, set your camera to that
option in the setup menus. See Chapter 3 for infor-
mation on setting your camera’s resolution.
Regardless of aspect ratio, portrait photos fit oddly 
in landscape frames, and vice versa, although most
people don’t set the frame up in portrait orientation.
In most cases, black bars appear left and right of the
portrait to fill the width. Live with this or avoid put-
ting portraits on your frame.
➟Memory card slots: Frames accept camera memory
cards so that you can display photos from the same
card you use to take photos. Make sure the frame you
buy reads the same card you use in your camera. Most
frames read more than one type of card. If your frame
and camera use different cards, you can use a com-
puter to prepare photos for the frame. For more on
that, see the task “Copy Photos from Your Computer.”
Along with the preceding features, consider a few more as you compare
frames:
➟Brightness: A bright screen shows off your photos in
their best light. Although specifications may help in
comparing frames, it is difficult to judge brightness
without seeing a frame in use.
➟Contrast ratio: Contrast is the difference between
light and dark areas on the screen. The greater the
ratio (for example, 300:1), the better.
➟
282
Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos

➟Viewing angle: This feature refers to how far off-center
you can stand or sit and still clearly see the photo. An
extremely narrow viewing angle requires you to be
directly in front of the frame to see your photos. A
wide horizontal viewing angle lets more people gather
around a frame and see photos equally well. When
you are beyond the viewing angle of any screen, the
photo is unrecognizable. The vertical viewing angle
becomes more significant if you intend to place the
frame on a low table or a high shelf. Theoretically, a
180 degree vertical viewing angle and a 180 degree
horizontal viewing angle would be perfect — you
could see it standing off to the side. Many frames 
have a viewing angle of less than 90 degrees in either
direction.
➟Internal memory: Not all frames have internal or
built-in memory for storing photos. Those that do
have memory vary in how much they have. The more
internal memory a frame has, the more pictures it can
store without using a memory card. However, you
may choose to store your photos on removable mem-
ory cards. In that case, you may not need much or
any internal memory.
➟Controls: All frames have buttons and switches for
power, menus, and moving from one picture to the
next. These controls are often on the back of the
frame or the sides. Some frames have touch screens,
either on the display area or in the frame outside the
display area. The size and location of these controls,
and the effort required to press them, affects ease of
use. Some controls are very slow to respond and
require a firm press and patience. This is another fea-
ture you can only judge by using it.
➟
283
Chapter 15: Enjoying Digital Picture Frames

One downside of touch screens is that most show 
fingerprints and smudges. See Figure 15-2. A remote
control frees you from touching the frame to change
photos or settings. If a frame comes with a remote,
make sure it’s not too small to use easily.
Here are some other features you may consider important:
➟Audio speakers: Do you want to play music on your
frame? Will you play videos with sound? If not,
speakers don’t matter.
➟Battery power: All frames plug in for power. If you
want to use a frame as a portable photo album to
pass around, look for one that uses rechargeable bat-
teries, as well.
➟Clock or calendar: Many frames have built-in clocks.
Some let you set alarms. Some frames have calendars.
You may be able to display the time or a calendar
next to your photos.
Some frames let you schedule times to turn the frame
on and off to save power.
➟Frame style: Some frames are sleekly modern with
glossy plastic or metal. Others imitate traditional
photo frames with wood. Some come with extra face-
plates or mats to change the color of the area outside
the display area.
➟In-frame editing: Basic editing includes rotating a
portrait into vertical position and cropping to
emphasize the subject by removing the surrounding
area in the photo. If you have a computer, you may
find it more convenient to edit on the computer than
by using the frame’s functions for editing. Your cam-
era may also have some basic editing features.
➟
284
Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos

Figure 15-2
➟USB connections: Some frames accept USB flash
drives as an easy way to transfer photos from a com-
puter. (Ads may refer to the frame as a USB host, in
this case.) Separately, most frames accept a USB cable
to connect directly to a computer to transfer photos.
This requires taking the frame to the computer and
also plugging in the frame’s own power cord, unless
the frame runs on batteries.
➟Video format: Do you want to play movies on your
frame? Compare the format your camera records with
the formats the frame can play.

Chapter 15: Enjoying Digital Picture Frames

➟Wireless connectivity: A wireless function allows a
computer to send photos directly to a frame without
wires. Photos can even come from friends and family
over the Internet. Unfortunately, this can be tricky to
configure, so don’t get this feature unless you have
experience with wirelessly networking computers or
know someone who does.
Small laptop computers may be a suitable alternative
to a digital picture frame. An 8” netbook may cost two
or three times as much as a frame, but you’ll get
more, including photo organizing and editing func-
tions, as well as Internet connectivity. When you want
your laptop to act like a frame, start a slideshow. See
Chapter 16 for information on computer slideshows.
Set Up Your Picture Frame
1. Unpack the parts from the box. Keep all packing material
until you are certain you won’t need to return the frame.
Identify the frame, stand, and the power supply.
2. Attach the stand to the frame. Some stands insert, clip, or
screw onto an area on the back of the frame. Some frames
have different connections depending on whether you
want the frame horizontal (landscape) or vertical (por-
trait). Set the frame up for horizontal display, unless most
of the photos you intend to display are portraits. See
Figure 15-3.
3. Put the frame in a spot safe from pets and traffic, within a
cord’s length of a wall plug. Connect the power supply to
the frame on the back or side. Plug the frame into the wall.
4. Turn the frame on. The power switch is a button or slider
on the side or back of the frame. The frame’s logo and a
screen with information on switches appear on some
models. A demo slideshow starts automatically. See the
task “Display Photos from Your Camera’s Memory Card.”

Display Photos from Your Camera’s Memory Card
1. If you have photos on your camera’s memory card, you
can display them on your frame. (If you don’t have any
photos on the memory card, take some.)
2. Turn the camera off. Eject the memory card, noting how
the card was inserted originally. If you have a spare mem-
ory card, insert it into the camera.

Chapter 15: Enjoying Digital Picture Frames

If you have two or more memory cards, one can be in
the camera and another in the frame at all times.
3. If the frame is on, turn it off. Locate the slot appropriate
for your memory card. Most frames use combination slots
that take more than one type of card. Wide slots make it
trickier to insert the card correctly than in a camera. Metal
contacts go in first. Insert the card gently. Warning: Don’t
push the card in beyond the edge of the slot or you may
have trouble removing the card. (Try using tweezers if
your card gets stuck.) If the card does not slide easily into
place, pull it out and turn it over and try again or look for
another slot. Be gentle: Do not force the card or pull it
out too strongly.
4. Turn the frame on. A menu may appear at first, but after a
moment, most frames begin to show photos from the
memory card.
Change Frame Settings
1. If the frame is off, turn it on. If you normally use a mem-
ory card, leave that card inserted in the frame.
2. Locate the Menu or Setup button. This may be on the
back, side, or front. You also need to identify the OK but-
ton (it may be the same as the Menu button) and other
buttons that move the selection highlight up, down, left,
and right. Press the Menu button.
3. Look for a Settings or Setup option on the menu, which
is sometimes represented by a gear or wrench. The menu
may also include options to select a source for pictures.
The picture source is usually selected automatically based
on which card is inserted. Use the appropriate button to
move the selection highlight over Settings or Setup. Press
the OK button to begin setup.
➟
288
Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos

4. Your frame may have some but not all of these options.
Some options may appear only after you select another
option:
• Frequency or interval: How often do you want a new
photo to appear? Choices may range from a few seconds
to 24 hours. Choose 30 seconds or a minute to start. At
an interval of 5 seconds or less, photos fly by. If you set
the interval too long, you may feel impatient waiting for
the photo to change. Some frames have Next and
Previous buttons on the frame or remote to enable you
to switch photos without waiting for the automatic
interval to pass.
• Order: Random order offers the most surprise. However,
if your photos tell a story that progresses with each
photo, choose something other than random. Other
ordering options include by filename and by date taken.
• Effects or transitions: Transition effects create a show as
one photo replaces another. Without transitions, one
photo disappears and the next replaces it instantly. With
a transition, you may see parts of each photo until one
replaces the other. Transitions can be entertaining or
irritating.
• Clock: If the frame has a clock, you do not have to set
the clock to use the frame. However, if the frame also
has an option to turn on and off automatically at a
specified time or to display a clock on screen, set the
clock, including date, if that is an option.
• Brightness and contrast: You may be able to adjust the
brightness and the contrast between light and dark. Wait
until you’ve seen how your pictures look with the
default settings.
➟
289
Chapter 15: Enjoying Digital Picture Frames

Edit Photos for Frames
If a photo isn’t exactly right, you may be able to fix it by editing. You
may be able to perform basic editing using your camera or your frame.
Your most complete editing option is to use software on a computer,
such as the Windows Live Photo Gallery. (See Chapters 10 and 11.)
These are the most common editing tasks:
➟Rotate: Photos taken while holding the camera verti-
cally, instead of horizontally, may appear horizon-
tally in the frame. Some cameras and frames
automatically rotate these photos. Otherwise, you
need to rotate the photos using editing options.
Many frames rotate a photo temporarily. In such a
case, the next time you turn the frame on, the photo
may be back to its original unrotated orientation.
➟Crop: By cropping a photo, you discard some of the
area around the subject to make the subject a larger
part of the photo, which is especially good on small
frames. However, if you crop a photo, you increase
the odds the frame has to add black bars to the sides
or top and bottom to fit the photo in the frame. (You
can crop using the frame’s aspect ratio to avoid this
problem.)
Some frames enable you to zoom into a photo. This
doesn’t change the original photo, while letting you
see part of the photo more closely. The next time 
you see this particular photo, it will be back to
unzoomed.
➟Resize: Most digital cameras produce photos that are
much larger than necessary for viewing on most
frames. A large photo takes more room on the mem-
ory card than a smaller photo. Large photos also take
longer to copy and might display more slowly.
However, you only need to resize photos if you are
➟
290
Part IV: Showing Off Your Photos

trying to fit more photos on the memory card for the
frame. (It may be easier to buy a larger memory
card.) See Chapter 14 for information on resizing
photos.
➟Adjust exposure: A photo may be too dark or too
bright. Some frames automatically adjust exposure,
color, and contrast. You may be able to fix a photo’s
exposure.
➟Delete: If a photo really is beyond saving, you can
delete it using the camera’s delete function (see
Chapter 2) or a function on the frame, if it has one.
You’d be surprised what you can do to fix a photo on
a computer. Consider copying all your photos from
the camera to the computer, fixing them there, and
putting on the frame just those photos you want to
see there. See the task “Copy Photos from Your
Computer.”
Copy Photos from Your Computer
1. Choose a method supported by both your frame and your
computer, whether a USB flash drive or a memory card. If
you are using a memory card, insert it into your com-
puter’s card reader. If you are using a USB flash drive,
insert that into a USB port on the front or back of the
computer. (If an Autoplay dialog box appears, close it.)
2. Use Start➪All Programs➪Windows Live Photo Gallery.
Select the photos you intend to copy to your frame by
clicking the check box in the upper left corner of each
photo. Your card or flash drive may hold hundreds of
photos.
Take advantage of tags and ratings for selecting the
photos you want to display. See Chapter 9 for infor-
mation on tagging and rating your photos.

3. With the mouse pointer over any one of the selected pho-
tos, click the right mouse button. Choose Copy from the
context menu that appears. See Figure 15-4.
4. Use Start➪Computer. The flash drive or memory card
appears as a removable disk with a letter and a colon,
such as E: (or whatever the last letter visible is). Right-
click over the icon for your flash drive or memory card.
Choose Paste from the menu. Your photos are copied to
the flash drive or memory card. See Figure 15-5.

display the photos you copied.
If your frame came with a USB cable, you can also use
that to connect your frame directly to your computer.

Having Fun with
Your Photos
T
aking and sharing photos is fun. You’ll
want to see your favorite photos again and
again in ways that weren’t possible with film,
negatives, and prints. You can reuse your digi-
tal photos in so many new ways.
For example, make a favorite photo the back-
ground of your computer desktop, so that you
see it every time you start and shut down your
computer.
Turn your computer into a digital picture
frame by using a photo screen saver to run an
endless slideshow. Or make a slideshow on
DVD to send to family and friends.
Insert your photos into letters and other docu-
ments. Your annual holiday letter will be that
much more interesting.
Create a book of your photos for less money
than you might imagine. Go online to a service
that lets you combine photos and layouts into
books to print as keepsakes or gifts.
The same companies that print books
also print photos on other things,
including greeting cards, mugs, and
even postage stamps. After you have a
library of uploaded photos, you can
create all kinds of fun things.

have choices as you go on. Because it is easiest to pick
photos from a single folder, consider copying all the
photos you intend to print into a new folder before
you go online.

photos or select from others you have already uploaded.
Click No if you are done selecting photos and wish to
continue.
11. The photos you have selected for the photo book appear
on the Organize Pictures screen, as in Figure 16-16. To
rearrange photos, use the Sort option on the far right
(that option is hidden behind the thumbnail in Figure
16-16). To manually rearrange, click on a photo, and then
click on the tiny triangle that appears in the lower right
corner of the photo. Use Move To to specify the number
of the position you want this photo to occupy, or choose
End to move to the last position. You can also remove a
photo from the book using this menu.
Drag and drop doesn’t work here to rearrange photos.
Take care in choosing photos in the order you want
them to appear in the book. You can also rename the
photos before you upload them so that if you sort by
name, that is the order the photos should appear in
the book (photo01, photo02, and so on).

aperture: The adjustable opening of the lens
that lets light into the camera.
Aperture Priority mode: The camera setting
you use to set the aperture, letting the camera
control other settings.
aspect ratio: The ratio of width to height for a
photo or screen. Most digital cameras have an
aspect ratio of 4:3. High-definition is 16:9
(wider than 4:3).
auto-focus: The standard setting that enables
the camera to automatically focus when you
hold down the Shutter Release button halfway.
Automatic mode: With this mode, the camera
automatically controls all settings, while you
point and shoot.
bracket: To shoot several photos with small
adjustments to settings. Some cameras have an
automatic bracketing option.
bridge camera: A style of camera between
compact cameras and DSLRs. Bridge cameras
have more features and options than compacts,
but fewer than DSLRs.
Burst mode: This mode shoots several photos
using the same settings to capture objects in
motion.
compact camera: A small camera designed
with ease of use and a low price point in mind.
composition: The plan for a photo with the
careful placement of the subject and back-
ground in mind. Composition is also some-
times called framing.
➟
Glossary

contrast: The difference between light and dark areas of a photo.
High-contrast photos are sharper than the soft effect of low-contrast
photos.
crop: To remove part of a photo with the intention of improving the
composition or emphasizing the subject.
depth of field: The area in focus in front of and behind the subject.
With shallow depth of field, areas closer to the camera or farther will
be out of focus or intentionally softer or blurred. With deep depth of
field, a larger area in front of and behind the subject will be sharply
focused and clear.
digital picture frame: An electronic screen for displaying photos.
Digital picture frames store multiple photos and display them in a
configurable slideshow.
Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera: cameras use exchangeable
lenses, such as a close-up lens versus a zoom lens. Specialty lenses are
a costly way for photographers to expand their options.
electronic viewfinder (EVF): An electronic viewfinder lets you hold
the camera up to your eye to compose the photo. The EVF displays
camera settings superimposed over the scene.
Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF): A standard for storing infor-
mation about camera settings at the time a photo was taken.
exposure: The amount of light and dark in a photo.
exposure compensation (EC): Involves small adjustments to the set-
tings a camera chooses for exposure.
focus: The degree of sharpness or clarity in part or all of a photo.
frame: To compose or arrange a photo with the entire scene in mind.
Also, a reference to a digital picture frame.
➟

f-stop: Aperture is measured in f-stops, or fractions of the length of the
lens. F2 or f/2 is a wide aperture. F16 or f/16 is a narrow aperture.
Each f-stop admits twice as much light as the next narrower f-stop and
half as much light as the next wider f-stop.
histogram: A graph of the distribution of light and dark within a
photo. A histogram on a camera or in editing may help you determine
whether a photo is or will be underexposed, overexposed, or unevenly
exposed.
image sensor: The computer chip in a camera that captures and
records the photo onto a memory card.
image stabilization: Image stabilization minimizes the effects of unin-
tentionally moving the camera. Without image stabilization, even
small movements or vibrations can ruin the focus of a photo, espe-
cially in a zoom or macro shot.
ISO: From the International Standards Organization, which sets stan-
dards for many devices and technologies. In the context of cameras,
ISO refers to the adjustable light-sensitivity of the image sensor. A high
ISO setting makes the sensor more sensitive, producing better exposure
in lower light.
JPEG: The standard for storing photos as files, as decided by the Joint
Photographic Experts Group.
landscape: Landscape orientation is the normal position of a camera,
where the photo will be wider than it is tall. Landscape mode is a
scene mode used to take photos of scenery.
liquid crystal display (LCD): The display on the back of a camera.
You can compose and review photos on the LCD, as well as view
menus.
macro: A macro shot is an extreme close-up, such as a shot of a flower
or bug that fills the entire photo. Use Macro mode to set the camera
for extreme close-ups.
➟
321
Glossary

megapixel (MP): Millions of pixels (dots). Image and screen resolu-
tion are measured in megapixels.
memory card: Photos are stored in the camera on a removable mem-
ory card.
metering: Metering is the process the camera uses to calculate the light
available in the scene.
monopod: A single-leg stand, 4 to 6 feet high with a connector at 
the top for a camera, used to support the camera and provide some
stability.
noise: Specks, color flecks, and other artifacts on a photo. Noise is
more noticeable at higher ISO settings.
overexposed: More light than necessary was used to expose the photo,
washing out detail in lighter areas.
panorama: A wide shot composed of two or more photos stitched
together by the camera or using photo-editing software.
pixel: A single dot of light and color. Photos and screens are measured
in pixel width and height.
point-and-shoot camera: A compact, easy to use camera.
portrait: Portrait orientation is a vertical shot taken by turning the
camera 90 degrees. Portrait mode is a scene mode for close-ups of 
people.
prosumer camera: A camera with features intended to please camera
enthusiasts. (The word is a cross between professional and consumer.)
A prosumer camera is a bridge camera with more features than a com-
pact camera but fewer features than a DSLR.
RAW: RAW is a file format for storing photos. RAW stores more expo-
sure information (useful for editing) in larger files than the more com-
mon JPEG format.
➟
322
Digital Photography For Seniors For Dummies

red-eye: Light reflected from the back of a person’s eye appears as red
dots in the pupils. Cameras have settings for minimizing red-eye,
which can also be fixed with photo-editing software.
resolution: Refers to the number of pixels in a photo. A high resolu-
tion photo has more pixels than a low resolution one. As a result, high
resolution images can be printed as larger prints than low resolution
images.
Rule of Thirds: A photographic guideline that suggests placing strong
horizontal lines, such as the horizon itself, along imaginary lines
dividing the frame into thirds. Strong vertical lines, such as a flagpole,
should be placed along imaginary vertical thirds. Furthermore, the
subject of a photo can be placed where a vertical third intersects a hor-
izontal third — instead of dead center — to create interest or tension
within the frame.
scene modes: Camera settings optimized for specific conditions, such
as Sports mode or Portrait mode. Choose a scene mode using a dial 
or menu.
shutter: Keeps light out of the camera until you are ready to take a 
picture. Then the shutter opens to let light into the camera for the
exposure.
Shutter Release button: Opens the shutter to expose the photo.
shutter speed: A measure of the length of time the shutter is open,
which affects the brightness of the exposure. A slow shutter speed
leaves the shutter open longer, admitting more light. A fast shutter
speed closes the shutter sooner, admitting less light.
Shutter Speed Priority mode: This mode allows you to set a shutter
speed, while the camera controls other settings.
telephoto lens: A telephoto lens varies from wide angle to zoom. In
non-DSLR cameras, this is more commonly called a zoom lens.
➟
323
Glossary

TIFF: The tagged image file format is another format sometimes used
to store photos. TIFFs are larger files with more exposure information
than JPEGs, but they have less information and are smaller than RAW
files.
tripod: A three-legged stand with a connector on top that attaches to
the bottom of your camera. A tripod lets you position your camera
precisely and hold that position indefinitely as you compose and take
photographs. The stability of a tripod is essential in low light.
underexposed: Insufficient light for a photo, blacking out details in
dark areas.
viewfinder: The small window at the top of a camera that you put
your eye near to compose a photo.
white balance: Certain lights have a color cast. For example, regular
light bulbs cast a yellow light. White balance refers to the adjustment
necessary to correct for that color cast to keep white objects from look-
ing yellow.
wide angle lens: A wide angle lens allows more width in a photo,
such as for photographing a building or large group. Most digital cam-
eras range from wide angle to zoom using a lever.
zoom lens: A zoom lens brings distant subjects closer to the camera.
