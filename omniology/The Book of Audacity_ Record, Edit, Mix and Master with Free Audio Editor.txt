INTRODUCTION
Audacity is an open source, free-of-cost,
cross-platform audio recorder, editor, and
mixer for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
It comes packaged in easy-to-use installers for
Mac OS X and all versions of Windows, and Linux users
will ﬁnd it in the software repositories of their favorite
Linux distributions. Visit http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
for downloads, documentation, and mailing lists.
In this book, we’ll be using Audacity 1.3.12 (and newer) on Ubuntu Stu-
dio and Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7. The stable 2.0 release
will appear soon and should look very much like what you see in this book
because the 1.3.xx series is the run-up to 2.x. This book is based on the very
latest releases as they came out, so it is as current as any book can be. The
1.3.xx Audacity releases are considerably advanced from the old 1.2.x se-
ries. Every new release is full of wonderful improvements and bug ﬁxes, so
if you’re still using those old 1.2.x versions, you should consider upgrading.
Ubuntu Studio is Ubuntu with a huge set of multimedia applications. It
is 100 percent Ubuntu-compatible, and it uses the standard Ubuntu software
repositories. You can download Ubuntu Studio or simply add the Ubuntu
Studio packages and artwork to any Ubuntu installation. There are several

excellent multimedia Linux distributions, which you can read about in Chap-
ter 13. You can use any Linux version you like; a few important system modi-
ﬁcations you may need to make are covered in Chapter 13.
Windows requires some modiﬁcations too, which you’ll ﬁnd in Chap-
ter 14. Since Windows XP continues to hang on and refuses to enter retire-
ment, you’ll ﬁnd information for Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.
What Can Audacity Do?
Audacity is fast and easy to use. What can you do with it? A whole lot:
•
Work with a wide number of different audio ﬁle formats and encod-
ings, including WAV, AIFF, MP3, FLAC, AU, OKI, MAT4/5, Ogg Vorbis,
WMA, M4A, and AC3.
•
Record live audio.
•
Convert legacy analog media to digital.
•
Make movie soundtracks.
•
Perform unlimited multichannel recording.
•
Edit and mix multiple tracks.
•
Overdub.
•
Use special effects of all kinds: wah-wah, change pitch and tempo, bass
boost, echo, reverse, phaser, and more.
•
Add graceful fades, both in and out.
•
Normalize volume levels.
•
Fix defects such as hiss, static, pops, and hum.
•
Perform frequency analysis.
•
Write your own plug-ins for special effects.
•
Cut, copy, splice, and mix sounds together.
Audacity can open and edit audio ﬁles faster than most other audio
applications and has nearly unlimited undo and redo.
So, what can’t you do with Audacity? Audacity does not support the
RealAudio format, and it does not support MIDI. While it is wonderful for
making mono and stereo recordings, it is not quite as good at making multi-
channel surround sound recordings.
What This Book Covers
In this book, we’ll use Audacity in a number of (I hope) fun and useful au-
dio projects. In Chapter 1, we’ll plug a microphone into a computer and
learn the basics of recording, editing, playback, and Audacity controls. We’ll
also learn some important digital audio terminology and concepts. If you
are new to digital audio production or new to Audacity, you should go through
this chapter ﬁrst.

Introduction

In Chapter 2, we’ll go into detail on audio gear, how to select it, how to
connect it, and how not to spend too much money. The world of audio gear
is vast and confusing, but this chapter sorts it all out for you.
If you’re like me and have a hoard of treasured vinyl LPs, 45s, or vintage
78s that you want both to enjoy and preserve, read Chapter 3 to learn how
to copy them to your computer. From there, you can transfer them to CDs
or export to MP3 or any other digital audio format you want. You can do the
same with any kind of legacy media.
Audacity is a great program for recording live shows or for editing record-
ings of live shows made with portable recorders. Chapter 4 shows you how to
clean up and optimize your recordings for compact disc or DVD-Audio.
Chapter 5 goes into more detail on making audio CDs and compila-
tion CDs. You’ll learn how to normalize different volume levels, break long
ﬁles into separate tracks, transition smoothly between tracks, and edit track
metadata.
In Chapter 6, we learn how to author super high-ﬁdelity DVD-Audio
discs. DVD-Audio is a special audio standard for DVDs; it is not the same
as the audio formats used on movie DVDs. With DVD-Audio, you can au-
thor very high-ﬁdelity DVDs or load several CDs’ worth of music onto a sin-
gle DVD.
Podcasts are all the rage, and Chapter 7 tells you how to make podcasts
that sound good and are bandwidth-efﬁcient, and it covers the basics of In-
ternet streaming audio.
Chapter 8 goes into detail on making the highest-quality audio record-
ings for distribution and tailoring your releases for different types of distri-
bution, such as Internet radio, downloadable formats, and CD. It also offers
some guidance on ﬁnding distributors and other business basics.
Audacity handles multitrack recording capably, so Chapter 9 shows you
how to record multiple tracks, mix, dub, edit, and mixdown to your ﬁnal
mono, stereo, or multichannel surround release. You can play or sing along
to an existing track, record as many tracks at once as your recording inter-
face supports and your computer can handle, and mix separate recording
sessions together.
Don’t pay for ringtones—study Chapter 10 to learn how to make your
own easily. Ringtones need to be not too big and not too small, and they can
be any snippet of music or sounds or even your own voice. Learn some tips
for tailoring your ringtones to sound better on the tiny lo-ﬁspeakers of your
phone.
You can go nuts playing with special effects in Audacity—strange noises,
sound effects, echo, wah-wah, bass boost, tremolo, and so on. Chapter 11
introduces you to a number of them, tells you where to get more, and shows
how to learn to write your own.
In movies and television, ace crime techs take shredded audio rem-
nants and create detailed, high-quality, beautiful recordings as they natter
about their magic algorithms. It’s all hooey. But you can do a lot to clean
up recordings afﬂicted with pops, hiss, and other defects, and Chapter 12
tells how.
Introduction
xxi

Chapter 13 details how to select a Linux distribution for audio produc-
tion, how to conﬁgure it for best performance, and how to troubleshoot and
ﬁx common problems.
Chapter 14 covers the important tweaks Windows users need to make
for quality audio recording.
Audacity is easy to use, but it has a number of options that may not make
sense to anyone who isn’t already an audio engineer, so Chapter 15 goes in-
depth into customization and conﬁguration.
Appendix A is your hardware reference; you’ll ﬁnd examples of audio
hardware in several price ranges that work on both Linux and Windows.
Appendix B is a glossary of audio terminology written for real people;
that is, people who are not physicists or audio engineers and who appreciate
clear explanations in plain English.
Appendix C debunks popular but silly audio myths and saves you from
some common—and expensive—mistakes.
NOTE
Audacity is also available as a source tarball. What do you do with a source tarball?
It contains Audacity’s source code in a compressed archive. You can install Audacity
from source code if you want and customize the compile-time options, examine the code,
modify it, or even modify and redistribute it. If you’re feeling adventurous and want
to help debug daily builds, you can grab the newest Audacity version from Concurrent
Versions System (CVS) and give it a test-drive.
Audacity vs. Ardour
Another popular audio recording application for Linux (and Mac OS X) is
Ardour, which calls itself a digital audio workstation. Ardour aims to meet
the needs of professionals and competes with the likes of ProTools, Nuendo,
Pyramix, and other expensive commercial audio applications. It has a more
sophisticated mixer than Audacity and some nice audio-for-video tools. It
has advanced dubbing abilities, synchronizes with MIDI sequencers, and
supports control surfaces, which are hardware devices for controlling your
software mixers. It has more automation, as well as a number of useful real-
time features such as changing plug-ins on the ﬂy and moving samples to
different tracks or timelines while they are playing.
Which one is better? That depends on what you want to do. Both are
100 percent free software because they are licensed under the GPL, both are
excellent, and both are getting better all the time. For complex multitrack
mixing or precise video soundtrack synchronization, go with Ardour. For
recording long tracks such as live shows, converting LPs and tapes to digital
formats, cleaning up ﬁles marred by hiss or hum or other defects, making
podcasts, making simple video soundtracks, and recording in the ﬁeld, Au-
dacity is an excellent, quality application with a short learning curve and a
lot of useful and advanced features.

AUDACITY FROM START TO FINISH
Let’s ﬁre up Audacity and make a record-
ing. We’ll begin with a quick-start tutorial
and make a simple recording to demonstrate
basic usage. Then we’ll cover the fundamental
Audacity functions in detail from start to ﬁnish: record-
ing, performing common editing tasks, saving your
work, and exporting to various audio ﬁle formats and
quality levels.
We’ll deal with fancy audio hardware later; for now, all you need is any
Linux or Windows computer with an ordinary sound card and either a mi-
crophone with a 1/8′′ mini-plug or a USB microphone or headset. Any
microphone will do for this initial test, even a little cheapo computer mi-
crophone. I recommend an external microphone because built-in computer
mics sound pretty bad and are positioned inconveniently. Of course, if you
have something better and know how to hook it up, by all means use it.
USB devices need to be plugged in before you open Audacity. If you
change a USB device while Audacity is open, you’ll have to close and reopen
Audacity for it to detect the change.

Audacity Quick-Start
Okay then, enough ﬁddling around (unless you’re going to play a ﬁddle)!
Let’s make a quick recording, because that is more fun than sitting around
reading about it. Figure 1-1 shows what a new Audacity window looks like
before you make a recording on a Windows PC.
Figure 1-1: A new, blank Audacity window on a Windows PC
Figure 1-2 shows a new Audacity window on an Ubuntu Linux PC. As
you can see, Audacity is nearly identical on both platforms. The only signif-
icant difference is the recording and playback device chooser. The audio
subsystems on Linux and Windows are very different, so the device choosers
present different options.
Select Edit > Preferences > Devices to set up your default recording
and playback devices. These can be overridden easily from the main Au-
dacity window using the Device toolbar. Figure 1-3 shows a Plantronics USB
headset selected on a Windows PC. (Chapter 15 goes into detail about con-
ﬁguring and customizing Audacity.)
USB devices always announce themselves by name, so you don’t have
to guess. For example, on both Linux and Windows, the recording device
selector will say “Plantronics Headset.” If you plug a microphone directly
into an internal sound card, you will need to know the name of your sound
card’s driver. On Windows systems, don’t select MME, which is the anti-
quated, generic Windows audio interface. You want to select the modern
Windows audio subsystem, which in the Edit > Preferences > Devices dialog

recording and playback devices.
appears as “Windows DirectSound” in the Host line. Figure 1-4 shows what
the selections should look like on a laptop with an onboard SoundMAX au-
dio chipset.
On Linux, you’ll have even more choices. “ALSA:default” on the Device
lines will work for an internal sound card (unless you have changed the de-
fault sound device for your Linux system; see Chapter 13 to learn all about
Linux audio). Pick the device name for a USB device. When you’re ﬁnished,
click OK to close the Preferences dialog.

NOTE
Doing digital audio production on a PC means you’ll have to get very involved with
your sound card drivers and in conﬁguring your PC for good quality and perfor-
mance. Visit Chapters 13 and 14 to learn how to tune your system for audio produc-
tion and how to manage various operating system quirks for controlling volume levels,
balance, and input and output devices.
Before you start recording, save and name your new Audacity project by
selecting File > Save Project As. It is a good habit to do this right away for
every new recording.
In the next section, we’ll learn all about all the tool buttons. For now,
hover your cursor over the toolbars and buttons to learn their names.
Figure 1-5: Input Level Meter
Now let’s test recording levels be-
fore we actually start recording. Go
to the Input Level Meter, shown in
Figure 1-5. Click Start Monitoring
and start making noise. Unlike ana-
log recording, with digital audio you
don’t need to push your recording lev-
els right up to the redline. Try record-
ing to a peak of −6 or −9 dB.
You can use the Mixer toolbar to
control recording and playback volume, sort of. It isn’t really a mixer but
a recording and playback volume control. This is the little toolbar with the
speaker and microphone icons and volume sliders for each. It does not con-
trol volume on all internal sound cards, because some low-end sound cards
do not have drivers that support volume control. It may not control volume
levels on USB devices either, again depending on what their drivers support.
If this is the case, in Windows go to the Sound module in the Control Panel
to control volume levels. Linux users should use alsamixer. (Remember,
4
Chapter 1

Chapters 13 and 14 will help with these.) Or you can just make louder or
quieter noises.
The Input Level Meter uses two different shades of red: bright red bars
for displaying the average volume and dark red bars to show the peak vol-
ume levels. The little vertical blue lines mark the highest volume levels at-
tained during the session, and the little vertical red lines mark the peak
volume levels of the last three seconds. On the right edge of the recording
monitor are clipping indicators that will turn red when your recording level
is too loud. They’re pretty small and stay lit after your recording levels drop,
which limits their usefulness. However, you do need to pay attention to clip-
ping, which occurs when input levels are too high. Anything over 0 dB cre-
ates clipping, and clipping causes distortion.
Now let’s record some sounds. Click the red Record button and keep
making noise. You’ll see something like Figure 1-6. When you’re ﬁnished,
click the Stop or Pause button. With the Stop button, a new track starts the
next time you click Record; the Pause button lets you pick up where you left
off on the same track. If you stop when you meant to pause, don’t worry—
you can append to an existing track by pressing the SHIFT key and clicking
Record.
Figure 1-6: At last, a recording session! When you see blue waveforms, you know it’s
working.
Naturally, when you’re done recording, you’ll want to hear what you
just recorded, and Audacity offers instant gratiﬁcation. Click the Play but-
ton. If you don’t hear anything, it’s because you either selected the wrong
playback device or have a volume control set too low. Stop playback before
changing the playback device. The cursor changes to a little hand when you
hover over the Time Scale, and you can click any point on the Time Scale to
start playback again.

In digital audio it is common practice to record to a low peak level, as
low as −24 dB. The digital audio decibel scale is measured in negative num-
bers up to zero. About the smallest change we can perceive is 1 dB, and
−60 dB is as good as silence for most people, so a practical range to use
is −60 to 0 dB. A +3 dB change doubles the volume, and −3 dB halves it.
A super-low peak such as −24 dB is useful when you’re recording some-
thing with unpredictable levels, such as a live performance. For other, more
controlled circumstances, a good peak level is between −12 dB and −6 dB.
Any sound level over 0 dB will result in clipping, which creates distortion.
Avoiding distortion is very important in digital audio recording. The signal-
to-noise ratio is extremely high, so you don’t need to push your recording
levels to the maximum just to keep noise at tolerable levels.
A low peak level means that your recording won’t be very loud, but that
is no problem. You can easily ﬁx this. Select the whole track by clicking the
track label (Figure 1-7). Then open Effect > Normalize. Check both boxes
in the Normalize dialog and make the maximum amplitude 0 (Figure 1-8).
Figure 1-7: How to select
a whole track
Figure 1-8: Normalization uniformly raises (or
lowers) the volume level of your track.
The ﬁnal step is to export your new recording to a playable audio ﬁle.
Audacity uses its own special ﬁle format that doesn’t work in anything but
Audacity, so you have to export to an audio ﬁle format that works in play-
back devices. Select File > Export to export the project as a WAV ﬁle, which
should be the default choice (Figure 1-9). Name your export ﬁle whatever
you want, maybe something creative like test.wav. The WAV format is almost
universal and will play on nearly any digital playback device or computer
software media player.
Now you can play your test.wav ﬁle on your computer and hear it in all
its glory. Windows users can use Windows Media Player, which is installed by
default, or choose from a host of third-party programs. Linux users also have
any number of media players to choose from: Amarok, Rhythmbox, VLC,
Mplayer, and many more.
It is best to use WAV as your default export format because it is a loss-
less, uncompressed format that provides the highest-quality recordings.
WAVs stand up to a lot of editing without deterioration, whereas lossy for-
mats (such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis) lose information with each edit. You

Figure 1-9: Saving your new audio ﬁle in WAV format
can always export from WAV to a lower-quality, lossy format, but you can’t go
from low to high quality.
All righty then, that’s the short story. Read on to get the unabridged
version.
Audacity in Detail
Keep in mind that Audacity supports nearly unlimited undo, so it is safe to
experiment. Undo works even after saves; you lose your undo history only
when you close your project ﬁle.
When you work on a project, Audacity does not operate directly on your
audio ﬁles. Instead, it copies them into a temporary ﬁle, chops them into a
lot of little pieces, and converts these to ﬁles with .au extensions that play
only in Audacity. You can see this by viewing your project directories in any
ﬁle manager. There is a single .aup ﬁle for each project; this contains all the
metadata Audacity needs to put these little ﬁles back together with the cor-
rect settings. When you open an Audacity project from your ﬁle manager,
select the .aup ﬁle.
Suppose you have a recording of a splendid performance where you
outdid yourself and brought tears to all eyes (of joy, not pain) and this re-
cording is in WAV format. When you import this WAV into Audacity, it is
copied and converted to Audacity’s internal .au format. Your original WAV
is safe and sound and won’t be changed, as long as you don’t overwrite it by
exporting the project back to the same WAV ﬁle.
Audacity from Start to Finish

Converting and splintering your ﬁles might sound like an odd thing to
do, but operating on many little ﬁles is a lot faster than manipulating a few
large ﬁles. Audio ﬁles can consume many megabytes and even gigabytes. Au-
dacity has an automatic crash recovery mechanism, which you will see only if
something bad happens; when you reopen Audacity, it will display a recovery
message. Unsaved data are kept in a temporary ﬁle, so Audacity can usually
recover them. Select Edit > Preferences to set an autosave interval; mine is
at two minutes. And, as with everything we do on computers, good backups
are essential. Hard disk space is cheap these days, so don’t pinch pennies on
storage.
Let’s start our detailed tour with a look at Audacity’s toolbars. All of the
toolbars have handles on their left sides so you can drag them anywhere you
want, even outside of the Audacity window. If you hover the cursor over the
toolbar handles, the toolbar name pops up. Hover over the buttons to see
their names.
Select View > Toolbars to control which toolbars are visible.
Figure 1-10 shows the Control toolbar, which has the Pause, Play, Stop,
Skip to Start, Skip to End, and Record buttons.
Now let’s meet the buttons on the Tools toolbar: Selection, Envelope,
Draw, Zoom, Time Shift, and Multi-Tool (Figure 1-11). These affect the cur-
sor functions.

Envelope
Use for ﬁne control of amplitude (volume levels)
on a track and for creating fade-ins and fade-outs.
Click to create control nodes, and then click and
drag nodes to increase or decrease amplitude.
Control nodes can be dragged both vertically and

Zoom
Left-click to zoom in, right-click to zoom out.
Remember the Zoom buttons! You will probably
use them a lot: Use Zoom In for precise edits and
use Zoom Out to make long tracks manageable.
See the View menu for more Zoom commands
and keyboard shortcuts.
Time Shift
Synchronize tracks by dragging them backward
or forward along the timeline. You can also drag
a track or clip into another track, as long there is
enough empty space to hold it.
Multi-Tool
This is ﬁve tools in one, activated according to
mouse position. Get the Selection and Envelope
tools by moving the cursor vertically, the Time
Shift tool by hovering over the track handles at
the beginning or end of the track, and the Zoom
tool by moving left into the decibel scale; the
zoom view will center over the decibel number
you hover over. The Draw tool appears when you
zoom in far enough to see individual samples.

Redo
Audacity supports nearly unlimited undos and re-

experiment. The Redo button reverses an undo
action or series of undo actions in sequence. You
can’t skip back to a selected action; you have to
redo all of them in order.
Undo
This undoes your last action, or any number of
actions before that in sequence, even after saving
your project. You can’t skip back to a selected
action; you have to undo all of them in order.
Link
Tracks
This tool has a somewhat misleading name. You
might think it’s for selecting multiple tracks, but
its function is to “link audio and label tracks,”
which is quite different. Link Tracks is enabled
by default when you start a new project, and it
keeps your audio and label tracks synchronized
when you modify a track. If you don’t have a la-
bel track, it does nothing. Use it when you make
changes that affect the track length, such as delet-
ing part of a track, inserting silence, or changing
the tempo. Turn off Link Tracks when you copy
and paste entire tracks, because it will mess up
your paste. Link Tracks appears in Audacity 1.3.9,
will be inactive in the 2.0 series, and is scheduled
to reappear in the 2.1 series.

your project ﬁle. (Effect > Change Speed behaves the same way, except it
changes your project ﬁle. Effect > Change Pitch changes the pitch higher
or lower without changing playback speed, and Effect > Change Tempo
changes the speed without changing pitch.)

Managing Audacity Projects
Your ﬁrst step on a new Audacity project should always be to name it us-
ing File > Save As. Then you can press CTRL-S periodically to save changes
or use File > Save. In addition to the .aup ﬁle, which is the project’s mas-
ter metadata ﬁle, Audacity creates a directory that holds the associated au-
dio ﬁles. You can view these in your ﬁle manager; there will be many sub-
directories full of ﬁles with the .au extension.
Adding Audio Files: Import vs. Open
Select File > Open to add an existing audio ﬁle to a new, empty project.
After that, select File > Import to add more ﬁles. Selecting File > Open in
a nonempty project opens the ﬁle in a new window.

Chapter 1

Saving Your Work
Audacity projects are optimized for use as fast workspaces and are not suit-
able for archival storage. There’s no snapshot mechanism for preserving your
work at different stages, and users have reported losing data when projects
become corrupted. I use a belt-and-suspenders approach: I make backups of
my Audacity project ﬁles, and I also make studio master ﬁles in WAV format,
because each approach has its advantages and weaknesses. First we’ll look at
a method for saving Audacity projects at different stages, and then we’ll look
at how to make studio masters in WAV format.
You can create something akin to project snapshots by creating multi-
ple Audacity projects from your original project. First, make a directory to
hold related projects so they don’t get mixed up or lost. Then select File >
Save Project As and give the project a name to help you remember what’s
in it, such as Summer-Festival-1, Summer-Festival-2, or something more de-
scriptive like Summer-Festival-No-Banjos or Summer-Festival-Mondo-Banjos.
When you do this, you’ll see a dialog like Figure 1-18. The crucial question
here is “Copy audio from the following ﬁles into your project to make it
self-contained?” Say yes by clicking the Copy All Audio into Project (Safer)
button. This duplicates project ﬁles and uses more disk space, but it is the
safest option. Sharing ﬁles across multiple projects saves disk space, but the
headaches aren’t worth it because changes in one project affect all projects.
Even worse, you lose redundancy, which is your insurance against any one
project becoming damaged and unusable.
Figure 1-18: Saving a copy of your project under a new project name
You can control this behavior in the Edit > Preferences > Projects di-
alog: When saving a project that depends on other audio ﬁles. This offers
three choices: “Always copy all audio into project,” “Do not copy any audio,”
or “Ask user.”
Audacity from Start to Finish

To make a high-quality studio master WAV ﬁle, export your project by
selecting File > Export. You can do this as many times as you want during
your work on a project, creating multiple masters to preserve your work at
different stages (or until you run out of disk space!). Then you can import
a WAV master whenever you want for further editing, and you can export
to any other audio format from your WAV master. This also gives you the
option of importing your WAV master into another audio-editing program,
which you can’t do with Audacity’s project ﬁles.
The default export quality setting for WAVs is 16-bit integer, which is
not the highest quality. Audacity’s default recording quality setting (select
Edit > Preferences > Quality) is a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit depth
of 32-bit ﬂoat. (Audacity terminology refers to bit depth as sample format, but
bit depth is the correct term.) You can create a high-quality studio master by
exporting to 32-bit ﬂoat WAV. Follow these steps:
1.
Select File > Export.
2.
Select Save as type: Other uncompressed ﬁles.
3.
Click Options and then select Header: WAV (Microsoft) and Encoding:
32 bit ﬂoat.
You will see a window like the one shown in Figure 1-19.
Figure 1-19: Exporting your project to a 32-bit ﬂoat
WAV ﬁle
The resulting ﬁle is not a playable WAV ﬁle, except in Audacity and
other audio editors and digital audio workstations that use 32-bit ﬂoat for
editing. However, it is great for studio masters because you can import and
edit 32-bit ﬂoat WAVs with very little loss of quality and export them to other
audio formats: 16- and 24-bit WAV, Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, and so on.
WAV supports a maximum of 32 tracks in a single ﬁle.
However, this has its drawbacks too. It works ﬁne when you have only a
few tracks to manage—my limit is four—because Audacity does not save the
track names but instead renames all of them with the WAV ﬁlename. Let’s
say you have a four-track recording and the tracks are named vocal, piano,
violin, and vocal2. Export this project to a single WAV ﬁle and name it

project to WAV (on the left
is the original project before
exporting to WAV, and on the
right is shown what happens
when the WAV is imported

testwav.wav. When you import testwav.wav
into Audacity, all four tracks are renamed
testwav 1.wav, testwav 2.wav, and so on. It also
makes tracks 1 and 2 Right and Left, even if
they were originally mono tracks. Figure 1-20
shows the before and after.
You still have all of your individual tracks,
but you lose the track names. On multitrack
projects, I rely very much on track names to stay
organized, so combining them all into a single
WAV ﬁle doesn’t work for me.
For projects that have more than four
tracks, I prefer to save each track as a separate
WAV ﬁle. To do this, select the tracks you want
to export and then select File > Export Multi-
ple. (We will discuss selecting tracks in the next
section.) Each track will be saved as a separate
ﬁle, and the track name will become the ﬁle-
name of the corresponding ﬁle. When I do this,
I put them in their own project directory so
they don’t get mixed up with other projects.
Selecting Tracks and Segments of Tracks
Now let’s learn how to select tracks and parts of tracks. Audacity supports
the usual editing functions computer users are used to—copy and paste,
delete, select, and so on, but it will drive you crazy if you don’t learn how
to do them the Audacity way. A nice feature of Audacity is that it supports
keyboard shortcuts for nearly all functions, so you can use the mouse or
keyboard.
First, make yourself a new recording or import an existing audio ﬁle
by selecting File > Import so you have some tracks to experiment with. Be
sure the Selection tool is active. If you’re using the Multi-Tool, move it up or
down until it changes into the Selection tool, which looks like a little I-beam.
Track focus and track selection are two different things. A yellow track
border shows which track has focus, but if the Track panel is light colored,
then that track has not been selected. Having focus means that the track is
ready to accept keyboard commands; the cursor line is active in that track,
and you can move it back and forth with the arrow keys.
Figure 1-21 shows two tracks: The bottom track has focus, which is in-
dicated by a yellow border, and the top one is selected, which is indicated
by the shaded Track panel. The cursor line extends into both but is active
in the bottom track. Having a selected track without focus and an unselected
track with focus isn’t much use. You can select a starting point for playback
in the track with focus and move it back and forth with the arrow keys, but
that’s about it.
Audacity from Start to Finish
15

Figure 1-21: The top track is selected but does not
have focus, and the bottom track has focus, indicated
by a yellow border, but is not selected.
When a track is selected, it becomes the target of any editing operations
you perform, such as copying, cutting, or applying effects. These will be ap-
plied to the whole track, even if it doesn’t have focus. There are two ways to
select an entire track: You can double-click anywhere on the waveform, or
you can click the track label in the Track panel (see Figure 1-7).
Most times you won’t have to pay attention to focus and selection be-
cause in the normal course of editing, they’ll be where you want them to
be. But sometimes things behave oddly, and being aware of this distinction
should help you understand what’s going on when Audacity seems to be re-
sponding mysteriously.
You can also select part of a track. Figure 1-22 shows a track with only a
segment, rather than the whole track, selected. Note the difference in shad-
ing between the selected and unselected portions.
Figure 1-22: A segment of the top track is selected.
Some laptop screens are not bright enough for the
shading to be readily apparent in the Track panel, so
look at the timeline as well.

click inside a track to select just that track, or left-click in the track label.
SHIFT-click the track label to select and deselect multiple tracks one at a
time, as well as nonadjacent tracks. In Figure 1-23, the ﬁrst and third tracks
were selected with SHIFT-clicking.

ary of your selection, where it will turn into a

You can navigate between tracks and ad-
just selections with your keyboard’s arrow keys.
Pressing the SHIFT and the left-arrow or right-
arrow key enlarges a selection; pressing CTRL-
SHIFT and the left-arrow or right-arrow key
makes it smaller. A slick trick for making a se-
lection across several adjacent tracks is ﬁrst to
make the selection in the top or bottom track
and then to press the up-arrow or down-arrow
key to repeat the selection in the other tracks.

The Skip to Start and Skip to End buttons in your Control toolbar move
the cursor to the start or the end of the track. Pressing the SHIFT key while
clicking the Skip to Start button selects from the cursor position to the be-
ginning of the track, and pressing the SHIFT key while clicking Skip to End
selects from the cursor position to the end of the track.
You can also use the Selection toolbar to make precise selections based
on various track parameters, such as time, samples, and various audio and
video frame rates. You can see these parameters by clicking the drop-down
menu in any of the three ﬁelds on the toolbar (Figure 1-25).
Figure 1-25: The Selection toolbar supports selections based on
a number of useful track parameters.
Suppose you want to select a 12-second segment that starts 48 seconds
from the beginning of the track. There are several ways to get to the 48-
second mark—click with the Selection tool, navigate with the arrow keys,
or use the Selection toolbar. Set Selection Start: seconds and enter 48. Se-
lect the “End” radio button and enter 60 in the middle box. There is your
12-second segment (Figure 1-26.)

The Track panel puts a number of
useful shortcuts at your ﬁngertips
(Figure 1-27). The little X on the top

the bottom collapses and expands the
track. You can also grab and drag the
track borders with the mouse to change their widths. The Gain slider am-
pliﬁes or reduces the track volume without permanently changing it, which
is essential when you’re mixing multiple tracks. The Pan slider controls the
left-right balance.
By default, Audacity plays all tracks on a project when you click the Play

buttons to silence tracks you don’t want to hear. This only affects playback

lets you split or join stereo tracks; lets you set mono, right,
or left channel; allows you to move tracks up or down; and
lets you change the bit depth (which Audacity calls the sam-
ple format) and sampling rate.
A stereo track is split into two separate mono tracks
with Split Stereo Track or Split Stereo to Mono. With Split
Stereo Track, one will be Right, and one will be Left. With
Split Stereo to Mono, two mono tracks are created. To
create a stereo track, place two mono tracks adjacent to
each other and then click Make Stereo Track in the Track
menu of the upper track. Move tracks by clicking and drag-
ging the track label or by selecting Move TrackUp/Down in
the Track menu.
The vertical scale to the right of the Track panel is your guide to the
volume levels of your tracks. The default display is Waveform, and you can
change this to Waveform (dB), Spectrum, or Pitch (EAC) with the Track
menu. Waveform is a commonly used visual scale for displaying the amplitude
(the strength or volume of a signal) of your track. The Waveform vertical
ruler has a linear scale of +1.0 to −1.0; anything that goes over these val-
ues represents clipping, which means you’re getting some distortion. Linear
means that all frequencies are given equal weight on the scale. Decibels are
logarithmic rather than linear, so this is not a true representation, but it is
easy to read.

Waveform (dB) displays amplitude using a logarithmic decibel scale.
Without diving into the mathematical details, logarithmic means that each
3 dB increment represents a doubling in loudness—hence, a sound mea-
sured at 6 dB is twice as loud as a sound measured at 3 dB, and 9 dB is twice
as loud as 6 dB. About the smallest increment of change that humans can
perceive is 1 dB. (Read more about audio terminology in the glossary.)
There is a special decibel scale for digital audio, the Zero Decibels Full
Scale. This represents the digital audio volume range with negative numbers
up to a maximum of 0. In Audacity you can control the decibel range dis-
played in the Waveform (dB) view and on the Meter Toolbar in the Edit >
Preferences > Interface dialog. Click the Meter/Waveform dB Range drop-
down menu to see your options. The smallest scale is −36 dB to 0, and the
widest scale is −145 dB to 0. This only affects the display and does nothing
to your audio tracks.
You can use either waveform display to monitor your recording levels;
I think the default waveform display is easiest to read. You’ll notice the dis-
plays use two shades of blue, one lighter and one darker. The light blue rep-
resents the RMS, or root-mean-square, which translated into ordinary English is
the average volume over time. The darker blue represents the peaks, which
are the transient extremes.
NOTE
RMS and peak ratings are (mis)used in the marketing of audio gear to make you
think you’re getting more than you really are. For example, a set of speakers is rated
at 50 watts RMS/150 watts peak. Ignore the peak value—RMS tells you how much
the speakers can handle continuously. The peak value indicates what the speakers can
tolerate in very short (fraction of a second) bursts.
The Spectrum view represents the energy level (amplitude) of the dif-
ferent frequencies in colors. Red is “hot,” or higher amplitude, and blue
is “cool,” or lower amplitude. If your waveform is mostly blue, it’s not very
loud, and if it’s more red, it’s louder. You can easily test this by selecting a
track or a segment of a track, selecting Effect > Amplify, and giving it a neg-
ative Ampliﬁcation value of −30 dB. This should make it mostly blue. Give it
a value closer to zero to make it more red.
Pitch (EAC) displays the contours of the pitch of your audio using the
enhanced autocorrelation (EAC) algorithm. The EAC algorithm is interest-
ing for doing pitch detection; if you are interested in learning more about
this, enhanced autocorrelation and pitch detection are some good Internet search
terms to start with. Audacity’s implementation of this is pretty basic, so if this
interests you, you’ll probably want to ﬁnd more sophisticated tools.

Cutting Out Unwanted Chunks
You can easily remove parts of tracks that you don’t want. Just select a sec-
tion and then press the DELETE key on your keyboard. If you want to keep
only a small part of the track and remove the rest, select Edit > Trim or click
the Trim button on the Edit toolbar. This saves the part of the track that you
have selected and deletes everything outside of it.
Sometimes you might need to silence a large section of a track while
leaving the track intact. In that case, select the part you want to convert to
silence, and then click the Silence button or select Edit > Silence Audio.
Fade In and Out
When you delete part of a track, you might want to smooth the cut with grace-
ful fades. Fades are integral to audio editing, and Audacity has two ways to
create fades. The easiest way is to select a portion of a track and then select
Effect > Fade In or Fade Out. You control the length of the fade, and Au-
dacity does the rest.
The Envelope tool can ﬁne-tune the amplitude levels; it is good for con-
trolling fades and for ﬁne-tuning amplitude anywhere on an audio track,
including over relatively long segments. Figure 1-29 shows what this looks
like. Click different locations to create control nodes. To get rid of a node,
drag it outside the track border.
Figure 1-29: The Envelope tool creates graceful fades and
gives you ﬁne-grained control of amplitude.
Each node has four handles. The node handles can be moved in any
direction. The outside pair behaves a little differently than the inner pair—
use the outside handles to create more graceful, gradual curves.
The dotted lines on either side of the 30-second mark show where the
borders of the envelope go outside of the track display.
NOTE
In addition to the Zoom buttons in the Editor toolbar, the View menu has some nice
options for manipulating and navigating your tracks such as Fit In Window and
Zoom to Selection, and it shows useful keyboard shortcuts such as CTRL-2 for Zoom
Normal and SHIFT-CTRL-F for Fit Vertically.

Making Quiet Recordings Louder
Suppose your recording is too quiet and you want to amp up the volume.
No problem! Select the part you want to amplify and then select Effect >
Amplify. Audacity automatically calculates how much ampliﬁcation can be
applied without clipping; that is, without going over 0 dB (Figure 1-30).
Don’t check the “Allow clipping” box unless you are very sure you want to
do so.
Figure 1-30: Using Effect > Amplify to raise or lower
the volume of your selection
Another way to amplify a too-quiet recording is to select Effect > Nor-
malize. Check “Remove any DC offset,” check “Normalize maximum ampli-
tude to,” and set a maximum level up to zero. DC offset refers to the mean
amplitude; if this is not zero, then normalization won’t be applied correctly
because the amplitude levels will be unbalanced, and it might create some
distortion.
The difference between Amplify and Normalize is seen when they are
applied to multiple tracks. Amplify changes the volume on all tracks by an
equal amount. If you amplify volume by +9 dB, a track that peaks at −20 dB
will be raised to −11 dB, and a track that peaks at −9 dB will be raised to
0 dB. Normalize, on the other hand, adjusts all tracks to the same maximum
volume level, so some tracks may be changed more than others.
The default maximum setting for both is zero. It’s useful to lower this to
−12 dB or so on your studio masters in order to leave a bit of headroom for
more tweaking without risking clipping. For example, when you downmix
multiple tracks into a single track, the latter will have the combined ampli-
tudes of all those tracks and get louder, maybe a lot louder. Experience will
tell you how much headroom you need. Don’t normalize to zero until you
are making your ﬁnal exports.
Amplify and Normalize can also be used to lower amplitude. In the Am-
plify dialog, enter a negative value, like −6. The Normalize dialog uses only
negative values and won’t allow anything higher than zero.

Timer Record and Sound Activated Recording
Both Timer Record and Sound Activated Recording are in the Transport
menu. To use Sound Activated Recording, select Transport > Sound Activa-
tion Level and set the decibel level you want to trigger recording. It may take
a bit of trial and error to ﬁgure out a level that balances capturing what you
want without also capturing lot of sounds you don’t want. Then turn on the
recording monitor (Meter toolbar) and click the Play button. When a loud
enough sound is detected, Audacity will automatically create a new track and
then use that track for as long as you leave Timer Record activated. Click the
Stop button any time to stop Sound Activated Recording.
Timer Record is just as easy—just set the start and stop times for record-
ing. You can use this together with Sound Activated Recording to set a start
and stop range so that you can go away and leave Audacity running without
worrying about it ﬁlling your hard drive.
Mixer Board
The Mixer Board is a new feature that ﬁrst appeared in Audacity 1.3.8
(Figure 1-31).
Figure 1-31: The Mixer Board puts Pan and Gain controls
front and center.
Audacity from Start to Finish

This is a slick little board with volume units (VU) meters for each track,
plus Pan and Gain sliders. It puts your essential mixing controls within easy
reach, without having to make your tracks extra wide so that you can access
the sliders on the Track panels.
To use the Mixer Board, play your tracks in Audacity and adjust the
relative volumes of your tracks with the Gain sliders, which are on the left
side of the VU meter, and the left-right balance of each track with the Pan
slider. Then make your export. The Pan and Gain sliders do not change
your project ﬁles—they only affect playback in Audacity and how your ex-
ported ﬁle will sound. See Chapter 9 to learn more about multitrack mixing.
Track Metadata
You can preserve useful data in your Audacity projects, such as song titles,
date, artist name, and genre, with the metadata editor. Before your ﬁnal ex-
port, select File > Open Metadata Editor. You’ll see a window like the one
in Figure 1-32. Fill in any of the Artist Name, Album Title, Year, Genre, and
Comments ﬁelds, and these will be applied to each song track. Audacity will
ﬁll in the Track Titles and Track Numbers ﬁelds automatically.
Figure 1-32: Using File > Open Metadata Editor to store useful
information in your Audacity project
If you select Edit > Preferences > Import/Export, there is a "Show
Metadata Editor prior to export step" option. If you check this, the meta-
data editor will open for each track before it is exported so you can review
or edit the metadata.

Final Mixdown
Usually your goal is to mixdown however many tracks you have recorded to a
stereo track. However, Audacity also supports multichannel surround sound,
which is covered in Chapter 9. Before you export, select Edit > Preferences
> Import/Export and select the “Use custom mix” radio button. At export,
an Advanced Mixing Option window appears, which is a simple channel
mapper. Map your tracks to whichever channels you want. Your tracks can
go to the left channel, the right channel, or even multiple channels. Chan-
nel 1 is always the left channel when there are two tracks. (See Figure 1-33
for a simple two-track example.) When you are using this tool, you will be
glad you named your tracks. Chapter 9 goes into more detail on multitrack
mixing and channel mapping.
Figure 1-33: Using Audacity’s mixer to map your tracks to the correct
channels
Audio File Formats and Quality Settings
There are many different audio ﬁle formats, and Audacity supports a lot of
them. Let’s look at WAV, MP3, FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis. These well-supported,
popular formats serve different purposes.
Understanding File Formats
WAV ﬁles are uncompressed, high-quality pulse-code modulation (PCM)
ﬁles. They are large. One minute of a CD-quality stereo WAV recording con-
sumes about 10MB of disk space. WAV is the best-supported format and is
the quality standard by which other formats are measured.
Audacity from Start to Finish
25

MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, not MPEG-3) is a popular compressed,
lossy encoding format; an MP3 ﬁle can be as small as one-tenth the size of
a similar WAV ﬁle and still sound pretty good. This means you can cram a
lot more music into a portable player and have faster downloads and better
online streaming. The trade-off is that quality is lost. See Chapters 13 and 14
to learn how to enable MP3 support in Audacity.
Although MP3 is extremely popular, it is encumbered with messy pat-
ent problems. A number of different companies in different countries claim
they own patents on MP3, and depending on where you live, you may be ex-
pected to pay licensing fees if you want to distribute music encoded in MP3.
The ﬁnal patents won’t expire until 2017. However, the patent situation is
not clear-cut because many independent musicians distribute their music in
MP3 format without paying patent royalties, and patents do not apply in all
countries outside their countries of origin.
Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is an excellent open and free format.
This lossless, compressed format is equivalent in quality to WAV but with
ﬁle sizes that are one-third to a half smaller. FLAC is a great format for a PC
media server, because you get great quality without eating up as much hard
drive space. Online music services distribute their highest-quality downloads
in FLAC. You can even use FLAC for your studio masters if you need to con-
serve storage space. Although the FLAC format does not support 32-bit ﬂoat,
24-bit FLAC ﬁles are still very high quality.
Ogg Vorbis was created as a high-quality, free, and open alternative to
MP3. Ogg ﬁles range from about the same size as MP3 to about 25 percent
larger. Ogg Vorbis is not as widely supported as MP3 and WAV, though its
popularity is increasing. Linux, Windows, and Mac all have a number of
software music players that support playing both standalone Ogg ﬁles and
streaming Ogg. The iPod and Zune do not support Ogg (not a big surprise,
coming from the two titans of lock-in), but a growing number of other play-
back devices do.
Chapter 7 goes into detail about different quality levels for Ogg Vorbis
and MP3, and Chapter 6 discusses WAV and FLAC.
The next section explains some important fundamental concepts of dig-
ital audio and terminology that you’ll encounter a lot, so grab a cup of tea,
put your feet up, and read on.
Understanding Bit Depth and Sampling Rate
Digital audio production can be summed up as converting analog signals
to digital and back again. In other words, you capture sound from an ana-
log microphone or electric musical instrument, run it through an analog-
to-digital converter (ADC), and record the digitized bits to a hard drive or
solid-state storage. The ADC can be a sound card, a preamp/ADC, a stand-
alone ADC, or some other combination device. Somewhere down the road
this digital data will be retrieved and converted to analog form for playback.
26
Chapter 1

Your computer’s sound card performs digital-to-analog conversion during
playback, and so does an ordinary CD or MP3 player.
Your goal is to convert those analog signals as faithfully as possible. Once
they are in digital form, you have a whole world of tools at your disposal to
manipulate them in all kinds of creative ways, and you have a multitude of
options for playback formats and media.
16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit Float
Two common digital audio speciﬁcations are referred to as 16/44.1 and
24/96. Sometimes 16/44.1 is shortened to 16/44. These designations specify
bit depth and sampling rate. Bit depth affects dynamic range, signal-to-noise
ratio, and ﬁdelity. Sampling rate determines the frequency range.
CD-quality audio is deﬁned as 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, two-channel WAV, and
24/96 is higher-than-CD audio quality, such as digital audio tape (DAT),
DVD audio, and studio master recordings. So, we should just go for the
highest numbers to get the best quality, right? Well, no—there are a num-
ber of factors to consider.
Figure 1-34: Audacity
waveform, enlarged so
that the sample points are
visible
Sampling is done by the analog-to-digital con-
verter; it samples the electric voltage in an analog
audio signal at intervals and converts the measure-
ments to digital form. The more times per second
this is done, the more accurate the digital rep-
resentation of the signal. So, a sampling rate of
44.1kHz means 44,100 samples per second per
channel. This is Audacity’s default. You can see
a picture of this by enlarging a section of any Au-
dacity waveform. This will look something like Fig-
ure 1-34, where each dot represents a single audio
sample.
Each audio sample is represented as a numeric
value—in computers, everything is a number. In
CD-quality audio, 16 bits is the range of possible
values per sample, and 16 bits = 65,536. This is the bit depth. Each sample
is not 65,536 bits in size but is given a single 16-bit value that is equal to or
lesser than 65,535 (0 to 65,535.)
For 24/96 recording, which is often used in professional recording, 24
bits gives 16,777,216 possible values. Larger bit depths mean wider dynamic
ranges and ﬁner tonal shadings—and also signiﬁcantly larger ﬁle sizes. One
minute of a stereo recording is about 10MB (5MB per channel) at 16/44.1
and is about 34MB at 24/96.
Theoretically, the dynamic range of 16-bit digital audio is 96 dB, for a
scale of −96 to 0. For 24-bit audio, it is 144 dB, and for 32-bit audio, it is 192
dB. In the real world, the actual dynamic range is lower because of limita-
tions in electronic hardware: around 90 dB for 16-bit audio and 115 dB for
both 24-bit and 32-bit audio.
Audacity from Start to Finish
27

The value of a wide dynamic range is not that you can shock your listen-
ers with sudden extreme volume changes but in having a very high signal-to-
noise ratio, which is also called “having a low noise ﬂoor.” The more signal
and less noise, the better.
As far as adjusting the dynamic range with the listener in mind, a range
of 50 dB to 60 dB in a recording is the maximum most listeners will toler-
ate, and that is under ideal conditions with a good system in a quiet environ-
ment. A picky audiophile with good equipment and a quiet listening space
will enjoy a symphony that uses every bit of a 60 dB dynamic range. A live
symphony concert might encompass an 80 dB range.
Someone listening to music in a noisier environment or on lower-quality
audio gear might be more comfortable with a dynamic range of 20 dB or
even narrower. Audacity lets you tailor your recordings to any dynamic range
you want. (See Chapters 6, 8, and 11 to learn more about dynamic range
compression.)
There is a famous theorem in the audio world called the Nyquist-
Shannon theorem. It is long and detailed—the part that matters here states
that a perfect digital representation of an analog audio signal is possible
when the sampling rate is at least twice as high as the highest frequency in
the signal. The best human hearing can hear up to 20 kHz to 24 kHz, so a
sampling rate of 40 kHz to 48 kHz can (theoretically) reproduce the entire
range of human hearing.
Audacity’s default recording bit depth is 32-bit ﬂoat. Many digital au-
dio workstations, including Audacity, operate at 32-bit ﬂoat internally. It is
important to understand that this is 32-bit ﬂoat, not 32-bit integer. In con-
trast, the 16- and 24-bit depths represent integer values. As usual, the math
is complex, and audio geeks will bore you to tears telling you about it if you
let them, so here is the oversimpliﬁed short story: Integers are whole num-
bers, and ﬂoat means ﬂoating decimal point. This 32-bit ﬂoat number is a
24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. This is signiﬁcant in terms of audio
production—it gives you a dynamic range of about 1500 dB, which means
virtually no noise or clipping, and you get a smoother, more accurate re-
sponse curve across the whole range of your analog-to-digital conversion.
(In comparison, the dynamic range of 32-bit integer is 196 dB.)
Recording and editing at 32-bit ﬂoat is beneﬁcial even with a 16-bit re-
cording interface. If you work to a peak of −24 dB, which is very low and
safe to avoid clipping, your available dynamic range will still exceed what
any hardware supports, and you’ll have plenty of extra bits to throw away
without harming quality. That means you’ll be able to edit and manipulate
your audio ﬁles as much as you want and still be able to make high-quality
16-bit and 24-bit exports. The more processing you apply to your recordings,
the more you want all that extra headroom.
You will always export to a lower bit depth because there is no such
thing as a 32-bit ﬂoat playback device. Playable formats must be integer data,
so your exports will always be to 8-bit, 16-bit, or 24-bit integer. (The word
linear is often used instead of integer; they’re referring to the same thing.)
28
Chapter 1

In practice, many factors will affect the bit depth and sampling rate that
you choose: How good is your hearing, how good is your gear, and what
are the ﬁnal format and playback medium going to be? How good are your
recording techniques? What sort of recordings are you making—nuanced
acoustic instruments and vocals or head-banging rock? Is your computer
powerful enough to process larger audio ﬁles, and do you have enough stor-
age for them?
You can get some good bargains on 16/44.1 recorders and ADCs be-
cause of the “bigger is better” mentality. On the other hand, it doesn’t hurt
to have the extra bandwidth—you can always reduce quality and size, but
(despite what they show you on TV crime shows) you can’t recover what
wasn’t available in the ﬁrst place. When you’re experimenting, my recom-
mendation is to try increasing the bit depth before increasing the sampling
rate. If your hearing and audio gear are good, you should be able to hear
the difference between 16-bit and 24-bit recordings, though I suspect it will
take a side-by-side comparison to make the differences apparent. I record
and save my studio masters at 32-bit ﬂoat/48 kHz WAV and export mainly
to CD-quality 16/44.1. Going to higher sampling rates makes no difference
that I can hear, and it eats up hard drive space.
Audacity supports recording at 16-bit integer, 24-bit integer, and 32-bit
ﬂoat. For comparison, professionals record and edit at 24-bit, 32-bit, and
even 64-bit depths.
NOTE
As we discussed earlier, exporting to 32-bit ﬂoat WAV is a good option to consider for
creating and archiving studio master ﬁles. Then you can import your 32-bit ﬂoat
WAV back into Audacity (or any other audio editor that uses 32-bit ﬂoat), process it,
and export to 16- or 24-bit without loss of quality.
Bitrate, Bit Depth, and File Size
Bit depth is a term with a speciﬁc meaning, which we just learned. Another
common term is bitrate. These two terms mean different things and are often
confused with each other. Bitrate is the amount of data per second needed
to transmit an audio ﬁle and is most commonly expressed as Kbps or Mbps;
16/44.1 stereo is roughly 1.4Mbps, and 24/96 is about 4.6Mbps. You can
easily ﬁgure this out for yourself:
bit depth × sampling rate × channels = bitrate (bit/sec)
16 × 44,100 × 2 = 1,411,200 bits/sec
24 × 96,000 × 2 = 4,608,000 bits/sec
MP3s (and other lossy formats) are described in terms of bitrates
rather than bit depth/sampling rates. The MPEG-1 Layer 3 standard spec-
iﬁes a range of bitrates from 32Kbps to 320Kbps. Pretty lo-ﬁ, 128Kbps is a
common MP3 bitrate left over from the early days of slower Internet down-
load speeds and players with small storage capacities. Now 192Kbps is pretty
common, and a person with good hearing and a decent MP3 player will hear
the difference.
Audacity from Start to Finish
29

Total ﬁle size is an important ﬁgure to ace recording geeks. Digital au-
dio ﬁles are large, and you can eat up a large hard drive in no time during a
busy recording session with a lot of takes.
You can calculate the approximate ﬁle size with this equation:
bit depth × sampling rate × channels × (60 seconds) / 8 = ﬁle
size in bytes for a 1-minute recording
One stereo minute at 24/48 kHz is about 17.3MB:
24 × 48,000 × 2 × 60 / 8 = 17,280,000 bytes
You must divide by 8 to get bytes because there are 8 bits per byte.
Now What?
At this point, you should have a good grasp of the basics of Audacity. Audac-
ity is easy to learn; the hard part is learning audio concepts and terminology.
I’ll be talking about those a lot in the rest of this book, translating them into
practical terms and showing you how to implement them in Audacity.

BUILDING A GOOD DIGITAL SOUND
STUDIO ON THE CHEAP
There is a saying in the photography world:
The person behind the camera matters more
than the camera. The same applies to mak-
ing great audio recordings—the person behind
the gear matters more than the gear. This doesn’t mean
that the gear doesn’t matter, because it does. But merely
owning the most expensive, elite audio equipment won’t
turn you into Tom Dowd or Rick Rubin or Quincy Jones
or George Martin or whoever your favorite legendary
music producer is. It won’t turn average musicians into
stars.
When you’re shopping for audio gear and getting drawn into the “higher
specs and price tags is better!” zone, take a step back and reboot your mind.
Take a deep breath, slow down, and concentrate on learning how to get the
best out of lower-end equipment. Because today’s average digital audio gear
is better than the top-of-the-line analog studio gear of yesteryear, with more

accuracy, ﬁdelity, wider dynamic range, and less noise, it’s a whole lot eas-
ier to record, mix, edit, and apply special effects. You won’t have to fuss so
much with learning how to use your equipment, and you can concentrate
more on learning how to make good recordings with artistic and technical
ﬁdelity. Then if you ﬁnd yourself yearning for a better preamp, better mi-
crophones, better speakers, or what-have-you, you’ll have good reasons, and
you’ll know and appreciate better quality when you ﬁnd it.
In this chapter we’re going to turn a PC into a digital audio workstation,
and we won’t break the bank to do it. We’ll also look at portable digital re-
corders, which cram amazing ﬁdelity and storage capacity into tiny devices
and are endlessly useful in all kinds of circumstances.
Getting Sound In and Out of the Computer
One of the biggest hurdles with PC-based audio production is ﬁguring out
audio gear. There is a huge and bewildering selection of audio components
with every imaginable combination of features and price tags. In this chapter
I’ll discuss the basic elements of a small recording studio. Appendix A goes
into more detail on hardware, with examples of different models and brands
in different price ranges.
There are several ways to interface audio gear with a computer: a PCI or
PCI-E sound card for a desktop computer; a Cardbus or ExpressCard sound
card for laptops; USB 1.1, USB 2.0, or FireWire audio interface for any com-
puter. You will need one of these. Which one? For one- or two-track record-
ing, any of them will do. For heavy-duty multitrack recording, USB 1.1 is not
a candidate. But it’s great for one- and two-track recording, and you’ll have a
lot of excellent, moderately priced devices to choose from. For serious multi-
track recording, you need the faster protocols, especially if you’re going to
record at high bit depths and sampling rates, so we’ll look at their strengths
and weaknesses.
The most essential component in digital audio production is the analog-
to-digital/digital-to-analog converter. The ADC/DAC is how you get analog
audio in and out of your computer. It takes the analog signal from a micro-
phone or instrument and converts it to a digital signal. Then it converts a
digital signal to analog for playback. ADC/DACs come in a multitude of
forms: The most low-end, cheapskate onboard sound chip has one, and of
course so do higher-end audio interfaces. There are all kinds of USB and
FireWire recording interfaces that connect microphones and instruments
to your computer, and with them you don’t need to bother with an internal
sound card at all. There are also slick little portable ADC/DACs for connect-
ing turntables, cassette recorders, and stereo hi-ﬁampliﬁers to a computer,
as well as USB microphones and turntables with built-in USB ADC/DACs.
And for the studio geek with a healthy budget, there are the more expensive
rack-mount ADC/DACs.

studio, which just happens to be mine all mine. Figure 2-1 shows the whole
works: The computer is underneath the table. Starting from the left are
various headphones; then on the desk is an external USB CD/DVD writer,
a four-port powered USB hub, an LCD monitor, a color printer, the all-
important hot beverage mug, a turntable, an excellent old Pioneer stereo
hi-ﬁampliﬁer, a Behringer powered mixer, and a MobilePre USB preamp/
analog-to-digital converter. In front are two dynamic microphones. Not
shown are a pair of nice JBL speakers mounted up on the wall. You can
cram a lot of functionality into a small space.

the amp and mixer; that’s a pose just for the photo op)
Also not shown is a nice Focusrite Safﬁre Pro 26 I/O FireWire multi-
channel recording interface. Focusrite makes great audio hardware and sup-
ports Linux, Mac, and Windows. We’ll see more of the Safﬁre in Chapter 9.

For recording, the Behringer mixer has a pair of RCA recording outputs.
These send a stereo signal via an RCA-pair-to-two-1/4′′ mono TRS adapter to
the two 1/4′′ TRS jacks on the MobilePre. The MobilePre connects with a
USB cable to the computer. Everything plugged into the Behringer is then
captured in Audacity.
NOTE
The terminology for connectors is a bit mixed up, so I am going to refer to the connec-
tors on cables as plugs and the sockets on mixers, preamps, amps, and so forth that
they plug into as jacks. I will also bow to convention and refer to male and female
connectors even though that has always sounded weird to me. Male and female at
least have the virtue of having precise meanings, unlike a lot of audio terminology.

For playback, the MobilePre has a 1/8′′ stereo output. This connects
with a stereo-mini-plug-to-RCA-pair adapter to the Aux input on the Pio-
neer amp. The MobilePre also has a pair of 1/4′′ TRS outputs, so for these I
would need 1/4′′ TRS-to-RCA adapters. Figure 2-2 shows the plug-ins on the
back of the amp. A nice amp like this plus a good ADC/DAC makes a great
hub for a conversion studio, because anything that connects to the amp can
be recorded on your computer.
Figure 2-2: This is the back of a treasured old but versatile Pioneer stereo ampliﬁer.
It can connect two turntables (it even has proper ground connectors for turntables),
two tape decks, a microphone, a tuner, another amp, a preamp, and an Aux
connector for a CD player or other input devices.
I could also cut out the Behringer entirely, for example for interviews
and podcasts, and use only the MobilePre in combination with any computer.
When I’m copying vinyl LPs to CD, it goes like this:
•
Recording: turntable > Pioneer amp > MobilePre > computer
•
Playback: computer > MobilePre > Pioneer amp > speakers
The turntable plugs into the phono ports on the amp. The amp con-
nects to the MobilePre from a pair of recording outputs. I could use an
RCA-pair-to-two-1/4′′ TRS adapter or an RCA-pair-to-stereo-mini-plug, be-
cause the MobilePre is ﬂexible when it comes to making connections.
You can digitize any legacy media with this kind of setup, because what-
ever connects to your hi-ﬁamp or receiver can be copied into your computer.
Both recording and playback are routed through the MobilePre, so I get
to hear the playback on good speakers instead of lo-ﬁcomputer speakers.
The MobilePre has a headphone port for zero-latency monitoring during
recording, which is a nice thing to have. The Behringer mixer (Europower
1280S) isn’t really intended to be a studio mixer; it’s for powering live shows,
34
Chapter 2

which it does most ably, because it is an integrated mixer and 1200-watt
ampliﬁer. When I’m recording a live show, I hook up to it with a laptop and
the MobilePre. I also have a Zoom H2 portable digital recorder, which I can
use in place of the laptop plus MobilePre. The best-quality recordings at live
shows come from plugging directly into the mixer board.
NOTE
The local old-time country band that I like to listen to and record has a rather eccen-
tric sound system. They have a nice PA system, but instead of plugging everyone into
the mixer board, only the singers’ mics are connected to the mixer. All of the musicians
have to bring their own instrument ampliﬁers. This makes for a cluttered stage, and
recording is a nightmare—plugging a recorder into the mixer means the only instru-
ments it hears are whatever the mics pick up. The Zoom H2 has a neat little adapter to
mount it on a mic stand so I can position it anywhere, but it’s not as good as a proper
setup with everything routed through the sound board.
Let’s take a closer look at the MobilePre because it is representative
of a lot of USB recording interfaces. The MobilePre supplies 48v phantom
power for condenser mics and has XLR and TRS jacks, a 1/8′′ stereo in-
put, two 1/4′′ mono outputs, and a 1/8′′ zero-latency headphone port for
monitoring. Both dynamic and condenser mics can plug into the XLR jacks,
as long as they have XLR connectors. You could also use an XLR-to-TRS
adapter to plug a dynamic mic into one of the 1/4′′ inputs. Its built-in ADC
supports sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz at 16 bits, and it draws its power
from the USB bus of your computer, so it doesn’t need its own power cord.
It has physical gain control knobs and a volume control knob for headphones,
so you don’t need to dink around with software controls. (I’d rather twist
a knob than fumble around some weirdo software interface any day.) You
should be able to ﬁnd one for under $150. At 16-bit/48 MHz maximum
recording quality, it’s becoming obsolete because comparable devices sup-
port 24-bit recording. Still, it’s a great little device, and because it is USB 1.1
class-compliant, it runs on any computer without special drivers.
Figures 2-3 and 2-4 show the front and back of the MobilePre.

Sorting Out Connectors
Where do the terms TRS and XLR come from? TRS is tip-ring-sleeve, which
is the physical description of a TRS plug. Figure 2-5 is a labeled photo of a
stereo and a mono TRS jack.
The origins of XLR are a little more complicated. Cannon Electric was
the original manufacturer of the XLR connector, and some old-timers still
call it a cannon plug. It started out as the “Cannon X” series of connectors.
Then later versions added a latch, so there is the L, and then the contacts
were encased in rubber, for the R. Figure 2-6 shows a pair of three-pin XLR
plugs.

Figure 2-6: Here is a three-pin male
XLR plug and a three-pin female XLR
plug.
Figure 2-7 shows a collection of plugs and adapters. You can ﬁnd adapters
to make anything ﬁt anything. However, you must be careful—just because
something ﬁts doesn’t mean it belongs there, so read your product manuals.
Stereo TRS plugs have two black bands near the tip, and mono TRS plugs
have one.

Multichannel Recording, PCI, USB, FireWire
Multichannel recording is done in several different
ways. One way is to use a simple two-track recording
interface like the MobilePre. It supports up to six
inputs at once and routes them into two channels.
There are no mixer controls, so this requires some
ﬁnicking during recording to get a decent balance. A
better way to do multichannel recording with a two-
channel interface like the Pre is to record two tracks
at a time, giving each instrument or performer its
own individual track, rather than trying to cram them all through the Pre
at once. Then Audacity is your mixer, and you have individual control of
each track. Another option for two-channel recording is a good-quality two-
channel PCI sound card like the Emu 1616M PCI, which you can ﬁnd used
for under $200. It comes with a breakout box that supports all kinds of plug-
ins, 24-bit/192 kHz recording, phantom power, and preamps.
My Behringer 1280S gets pressed into service when I have a larger group
over for recording. Any analog mixer will work as long you have an ADC/
DAC to plug it into. My setup is a bit of a hack job since the Behringer is not
really a studio mixer, but it works and sounds good, and it is an example of
how a little ingenuity goes far in the wild world of audio. Like many mixers,
the Behringer outputs to two-channel stereo, so I need to get the mix right
during recording—I’ll have only two channels to work with in Audacity. I
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap

could also record one or two tracks at a time with the Behringer and then
knit them together in Audacity; there is no rule that says you have to plug in
everything at one time. (Though corralling and organizing musicians can be
a bit of a cat-herding experience, and sometimes you have to take what you
can get.)
Audacity from version 1.3.8 supports recording as many tracks at once
as your recording interface supports. Older versions max out at 16. This is
where FireWire and the higher-end PCI sound cards shine, because they
allow recording many tracks at once. The Focusrite Safﬁre Pro 40 is an ex-
ample of a good value in a FireWire recording interface at about $500; this
gives you 8 mic preamps, 20 total inputs and 20 outputs, 24/96 recording,
blinky LEDs, and phantom power on every mic channel. The M-Audio Delta
1010 is a popular higher-end multichannel PCI sound card that connects to
a rack-mount breakout box. It goes for about $600.
A cool new family of devices is USB and FireWire mixers. These give you
everything in one device—preamps, phantom power, mixer board, ADC/
DAC, and direct plug-in to your computer. There are a lot of nice choices
in the $300 to $1,000 range. Behringer’s line of Xenyx USB mixers costs be-
tween $150 to $600. They use class-compliant USB 1.1, so they plug into any
computer with no special drivers needed. The M-Audio NRV10 is a nice little
FireWire mixer/preamp that costs about $700.
How to choose which of these to use? USB and FireWire are portable
and easy to hook up. PCI Express is the fastest. One lane of PCI-E moves
about 250MBps both ways at the same time. That’s 250 megabytes, not mega-
bits. Plain old PCI maxes out at 133MBps. Also, unlike PCI-E, PCI uses a
shared bus, so more PCI devices means more bandwidth contention. Every
PCI-E device has its own dedicated data pipeline, so PCI-E devices don’t have
to share bandwidth. USB 1.1 is rated at 12Mbps (megabits per second), and
USB 2.0 is rated at about 480Mbps, but both ﬁgures are highly theoretical,
and in real life you’re likely to get half that. FireWire is rated at 400Mbps.
However, FireWire gives you higher sustained throughput and better perfor-
mance than USB, a difference that is discussed in more detail in the follow-
ing section.
A common problem with internal sound cards is picking up noise and
electrical interference from hard drives, power supplies, and fans inside your
computer case. This usually isn’t a problem with the better sound cards like
Emu, M-Audio, and RME Hammerfall, but it tends to be more of an issue
with consumer-level and gamer sound cards and low-budget onboard sound.
If you are getting some noise, the ﬁrst thing to check is all your connections—
make sure everything is hooked up correctly and anything that needs to be
grounded is grounded. Sometimes moving a PCI card to a different slot
makes a difference. Check your motherboard manual to see if you have
shared PCI slots; you don’t want to use a shared slot if the other slot is
populated.

Chapter 2

USB or FireWire?
If you like the convenience of a USB audio interface, you might also con-
sider FireWire devices. How do you choose between FireWire or USB? USB
devices usually cost less than FireWire, but the trade-off is you may get poorer
performance because of the differences in the two protocols.
All FireWire interfaces have special controller chips, so they do not add
any extra load to your computer’s CPU. FireWire is a peer protocol, which
means FireWire devices negotiate bus conﬂicts without using host CPU cy-
cles. FireWire gives you two operating modes to choose from: asynchronous
or isynchronous. Isynchronous mode means a device can reserve a certain
portion of bandwidth all for itself that no other devices can use. So there are
no collisions, which translates into high sustained throughput.
If your PC doesn’t have a FireWire interface, it’s easy to add one. PCI
FireWire interfaces cost about $50, and many laptops include a FireWire
port. When you’re shopping for FireWire audio interfaces, be sure to check
for hardware compatibility. As one example, the Presonus FP10 has known
conﬂicts with certain video chipsets, and it has a limited set of FireWire inter-
faces that it is known to work well with.
The Future of FireWire
“FireWire is doomed!” is a common cry of late. That may be true,
though it is going to be with us for some years yet. USB 2.0 sup-
posedly offers the potential to equal FireWire performance, and
USB 3.0 supposedly will eclipse it. Audio hardware manufacturers
have been slow to release USB 2.0 recording interfaces, though
there are now a respectable number of them. A lot of them rely
on custom drivers that are not USB 2.0 compliant, so shop care-
fully lest you buy one that won’t run on your computer. USB 3.0
is still a work in progress, and audio hardware manufacturers are
not known for moving quickly. If you like FireWire recording
devices, by all means buy and use them, and if FireWire ever does
become obsolete, you can still use your gear because nobody is
going to come and take it away from you.
USB operates only in asynchronous mode. Asynchronous means that any
device on the same bus can send data whenever it wants to, so sometimes
there are collisions, which cause latency. USB is host-dependent and puts
a load on the CPU, which can also cause latency. Latency is the enemy of
quality audio.
You’ll see a lot of USB audio devices that still use USB 1.1. USB 1.1 has
two speeds: 1.5Mbps and 12Mbps. The latter is also called full-speed. It’s un-
likely that a USB recording interface will be geared down to 1.5Mbps. The
number of channels you can record at once depends on the quality level
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap
39

you want to record at. CD quality, two channels at 16/44.1, has a bitrate of
1,411,200Mbps. Two channels at 24/96 equals a bitrate of 4,608,000Mbps,
so it seems you could record four 24/96 channels at once. However, that
12Mbps maximum is theoretical, and your real-world throughput will be
half that or less. Most likely you’ll be limited to two-channel 24/96 record-
ing at best. Four channels at 16/44.1 or 24/48 are possible if you are careful
and have a good, fast multicore PC and have it tuned for audio production.
(See “Bitrate, Bit Depth, and File Size” on page 29 to learn about different
bitrates.)
USB 2.0 audio devices require careful shopping, because many of them
are not USB class-compliant and instead supply their own special drivers.
Even Windows users have to do their homework because vendors are slow
to release drivers for new Windows releases. Mac support is decent overall,
and Linux, Unix, and users on other platforms are at the back of the bus as
usual. Some multitrack USB 2.0 devices are getting good reviews. For exam-
ple, the M-Audio Fast Track Ultra 8R (eight in, eight out) gets high marks
and works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
Microphones
The microphones in Figure 2-9 are middle-of-the-road dynamic mics that
cost less than $100 each. The microphone is very important—you won’t
get good recordings from low-quality microphones. There are two common
types of microphones: condenser and dynamic. Condenser mics have a wider
frequency response, are more sensitive, produce louder output, and have a
faster transient response. Transient response is any abrupt change, such as a
rim shot, a hard-strummed guitar, or a singer hitting some hard consonants
(and probably spraying a bit of spit).
Figure 2-9: Audio-Technica stereo
condenser mic, Behringer dynamic
mic, and wind sock
Condenser mics require power.
This is called phantom power when it is
delivered through the microphone ca-
ble, because there isn’t a separate power
cable. They are more fragile than dy-
namic mics. Condenser mics live mostly
in studios. They are also used onstage
in combination with dynamic mics on
drum kits; the condenser mics hang
overhead to capture cymbals and tran-
sients, and dynamic mics are placed
next to the drums. Figure 2-9 shows an
Audio-Technica stereo condenser mic,
a Behringer dynamic mic, and a wind
sock. (Experienced singers know to
avoid brightly colored wind socks be-
cause they look like clown noses.)
40
Chapter 2

Condenser microphones that require phantom power typically use XLR
connectors. Dynamic mics use both XLR connectors and TRS plugs. Dy-
namic mics do not require phantom power, so make sure that the phantom
power is turned off before you plug one in to a phantom-powered XLR jack.
It shouldn’t damage the mic, but it will change how it sounds. It’s common
to see audio gear with both types of microphone connectors, and newer de-
vices have combination jacks that accept both.
The little Audio-Technica Pro 24 stereo condenser mic in Figure 2-9 is a
different kind of condenser mic. It is self-powered by a little mercury battery,
it has a built-in cable, and it plugs into any 1/8′′ TRS stereo microphone
jack, like on laptops, digital recorders, and camcorders.
There are two types of condenser mics: large diaphragm (LDM) and
small diaphragm (SDM). Both record sounds evenly and accurately across
their entire range, though LDMs have a reputation for creating a “warmer”
sound. A large diaphragm mic has a better low-frequency range than a small
diaphragm, but a small diaphragm mic of the same type has a better high-
frequency response. Low tones are characterized as warmer, and high tones
are characterized as cooler and brighter. You’re going to hear all kinds of
characterizations for sound quality: warm, cold, brittle, soft, hard, bright,
dull, and on and on. Trust your own perceptions, and don’t worry about
what other people tell you you should like.
Figure 2-10: A modern
AEA R84 ribbon mic
Dynamic mics have a narrower frequency re-
sponse and are less accurate than condenser mics.
They are rugged, are moisture-resistant, and don’t
need a power supply, so dynamic mics go on stage
and in the ﬁeld. Dynamic mics generally cover the
human vocal range plus a little bit, so this makes
them good for singers.
Another type of microphone is worth consider-
ation, and that is the ribbon mic, which is a type of
dynamic mic. The guts of ribbon mic are a metal rib-
bon suspended in a magnetic ﬁeld. These are expen-
sive but are prized for their clarity, spatial depth, and
realism. They revolutionized the audio industries
back in the 1930s; ribbon microphones set new stan-
dards for realism and accuracy that the condenser
mics of the day could not match. Ribbon mics fell out
of favor somewhat as condenser and dynamic mics
improved. They were expensive, the metal ribbon was
fragile, and their output was so low they needed more
ampliﬁcation than other types of microphones. Mod-
ern ribbon mics are more affordable and durable
and produce louder output than their ancestors, so
they’re deﬁnitely worth trying (Figure 2-10).
Ribbon mics are natively bidirectional, which
means they are sensitive to sounds from both the
front and the rear of the mic in a ﬁgure-eight
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap
41

pattern. They are effective at blocking sound from the sides. The ﬁgure-
eight pattern is on the horizontal axis, so you can tip them sideways to get
a different effect. A pair of matched ribbon mics placed next to each other
at a 90-degree angle is called a Blumlein pair, or crossed ﬁgure eight. This
creates a realistic stereo image. If you don’t want to capture sounds from
one side, for example the audience side, you’ll have to block it somehow
or ﬁnd a ribbon mic with the capture pattern that you want.
Polar Patterns
Important considerations for microphones are polar patterns. Polar pat-
tern describes a mic’s area of sensitivity, as Figure 2-11 shows. These two-
dimensional diagrams don’t show that polar patterns are three-dimensional,
so keep in mind that they’re not ﬂat and horizontal; they encompass areas
with height and depth.
Figure 2-11: Some common microphone polar patterns (Image Credit:
Created by Wikipedia user Galak76, released under the GFDL.)
These are the common polar patterns:
Cardioid
Picks up sound from the front and rejects sounds from the
rear. Sub-cardioid is rather like omnidirectional, with a smaller range
to the rear. Hyper-cardioid and super-cardioid have a narrower range
in front, plus small lobes of rear sensitivity. This is common for stage
mics and especially for vocalists. Different cardioid mics have different
levels of sensitivity. Some have a wide pickup range, so they are good
for a performer who moves around a lot, and some have a small area of
sensitivity, so they are better at not picking up background noises.
42
Chapter 2

Omnidirectional
Picks up sound equally from all directions in a spher-
ical area. Try arranging your band in a circle with an omnidirectional
mic in the middle to get a spacious, natural sound.
Shotgun
The most highly directional of all with a long, narrow front
and smaller rear pickup range. These are commonly used with movie
cameras of all kinds, from ﬁlm to digital, professional and consumer,
and are favorites of wildlife photographers.
Bidirectional
Picks up sound equally well from front and back; does
not pick up sounds from the side. (Not pictured in Figure 2-11.)
Half-omnidirectional, or hemispherical
Picks up about a 180-degree
hemispherical area. You can get some nice live recordings with one of
these because it has a wide pickup area to the front and does not pick up
noises from behind. (Not pictured in Figure 2-11.)
You might be thinking, why not just use shotgun or cardioid mics for
everything so you zero in on just what you want to record? Do whatever you
want; let your own ears and taste be your guide and select your mics to suit
the occasion. Different brands and models of mics have different levels and
types of sensitivity. For example, some are forgiving of a singer who moves
around a lot, while others do a good capture only up close. Wireless head-
sets are wonderful for the energetic performer, and wireless mics mean no
tripping over cables. Some mics emphasize bass frequencies more as you
move closer, like radio DJs that boom forth with exaggerated bass. This is
called the proximity effect.
The Cowboy Junkies Trinity Session album was recorded using a single
ambisonic microphone that reportedly cost about $9,000. Ambisonics refers
to surround-sound recording techniques and equipment that are supposed
to produce a realistic, spatially natural sound. An ambisonic mic has multi-
ple capsules to capture sound from different directions, anywhere from four
to dozens. It’s an interesting niche in audio production; look up ambisonic
and SoundField mics if you are interested in learning more.
Which Microphones for Which Occasions?
There are different microphones for all occasions, such as voice, guitar,
drum, and so on. Vocalists can be especially picky, because different mics
color their voices differently. You’ll ﬁnd plenty of passionate opinions on
this subject. Keep in mind that there are a multitude of factors that affect
how good a recording sounds to you: how it’s edited, the type of equip-
ment you’re listening to, your listening location (home, friend’s house, per-
formance hall, outside, vehicle), and your mood and expectations. We’ve
grown up with decades of recorded audio of all types: acetate, vinyl, differ-
ent types of tape, and now digital. So what sounds “right” is heavily ﬂavored
by what we’re used to hearing. Some folks still hanker for the sound of tinny
’60s AM radio or boomy jukeboxes or quadrophonic eight-tracks. Some
believe that vinyl sounds “warmer” than digital and that tube amps sound
warmer than solid-state.
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap
43

I’ve always wanted to do some blind tests just to see whether the picky
audiophiles in my life can really hear a difference. Number one on my blind
testing wish list is tube amp versus solid-state, and cold tube amp versus one
that has had a 24-hour warm-up, because some of the aforementioned picky
audiophiles insist that tube amps need a long warm-up period or they sound
“cold.”
There are real differences between tube and solid-state. Tube ampliﬁer
systems drive a transformer, which in turn drives the speakers. The trans-
former suppresses a lot of transients like spikes, pops, and clicks, resulting in
a cleaner sound. A cold preamp has more noise than a hot preamp. Tubes
also have a singular noise source, whereas semiconductor devices have mul-
tiple noise sources, increasing the amount of noise you might hear. Still, on
good-quality gear it’s going to take some mighty ﬁne hearing to detect the
difference.
It is nearly impossible to deﬁne a “pure” experience, because even live
performances are colored by their environments and equipment, ambience,
and the way our brains process data. It always surprises me how much worse
my favorite local band sounds on the recordings I make of its performances.
During the shows, I’m having a great time and thinking they sound wonder-
ful. Then later when I hear the playback, I hear all kinds of ﬂaws: off tempo,
out of key, lackluster, you name it. Maybe I’m too picky and too attuned to
listening for mistakes on recordings; maybe during the live shows my brain is
too busy having fun to notice ﬂaws. Maybe I make lousy recordings.
The moral is sound quality depends on your own ears and experience—
what sounds good and right to you is what matters. You can try for the most
realistic ﬁdelity or try for the best artistic and creative ﬁdelity. It’s all subjective.
Microphone Cables
There are many brands of microphone cables, and you can waste a lot
of money on a snooty brand name. Don’t spend a mint; there are many
reasonably priced, good-quality choices. You may run into some confusion
over balanced and unbalanced cables. In the context of connecting micro-
phones, an unbalanced cable is a coaxial cable that terminates in a tip-sleeve
(TS) connector. It has a single conductor wire surrounded by a combina-
tion shield and ground. These are effective at blocking external interfer-
ence but are vulnerable to induced hum and noise and tend to be noisier
than balanced cables. A balanced cable terminates in either a three-pin XLR
connector or a TRS connector. It has two internal wires, one hot and one
cold, surrounded by a shield that is not part of the signal path, so it supplies
a cleaner signal. Balanced cables can run for much longer distances than
unbalanced cables without picking up excessive noise.
Keep in mind that it is the signal that is balanced or unbalanced, and
using a balanced cable will not make an unbalanced signal balanced. How-
ever, a TS cable will convert a balanced signal to unbalanced. You need
to match your cables to your mics and your preamp, amp, mixer, or what-
ever you might be plugging into. Condenser mics that depend on phantom
power mostly likely use three-pin XLR balanced cables, and dynamic mics
44
Chapter 2

use balanced cables with both XLR and TRS connectors. A balanced signal
doesn’t care what carries it, so you can use XLR-to-TRS adapters as needed,
provided that whatever you’re plugging into sends the correct signal.
These days this shouldn’t be something that you have to spend a lot of
time ﬁguring out, since most contemporary audio gear supports balanced
mic connections.
Microphone cables are either stiff or ﬂexible, depending on where they’re
going to be used. Flexible cables are for live performances, and stiff cables
usually reside in studios where they are not moved very often.
Don’t cross electric lines with any of your audio cables if you can help
it, because you may pick up interference. If you have to, cross them at right
angles to reduce the overlap.
Smart Miking
Placing your microphones for best results is an art in itself, and the only way
to get good at it is to practice a lot. You want to be as close as possible but
not so close that you pick up electronic interference or unwanted sounds
such as lip smacks and spit from vocalists. Pop ﬁlters are helpful for vocalists,
and windscreens are essential for outdoor recording.
The “3-to-1 rule” is a simple guide for microphone placement for live
performances or in the studio when you have several mics and performers
set up at the same time in the same room. When microphones are placed
too close together, you may get squeals, dips and peaks, or other forms of
unpleasant interference. The 3-to-1 rule means the distance between adja-
cent mics should be approximately three times the distance between the mic
and the sound source. If there are multiple amps present, as with my fave lo-
cal band where every performer lugs their own amp onstage, these will cause
problems too. Sometimes simply turning an amp to face in a different direc-
tion will cure feedback problems.
Microphone stands are essential—don’t depend on hand-holding.
Goosenecks take up less space and are fast to adjust, but over time they wear
out. Boom stands last forever but take up more space. Some folks prefer tri-
pod feet, which I always trip over, so I prefer weighted bases. Shock mounts
and cages are great for isolating your mics from vibrations and don’t cost
very much.
Microphone Preamp
Microphone preamps are the second most important devices in your audio
chain, after ADC/DACs. As I’ve already talked about in this chapter, I have
an M-Audio MobilePre and a Focusrite Safﬁre Pro 26. With these I don’t
need an internal computer sound card or separate preamp, because they
have their own built-in microphone preamps. However, even if you prefer to
use an internal sound card or have good external recording interfaces, you
may still want to use a separate microphone preamp. Let’s talk about why
the preamp is so important.
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap
45

A preamp—short for preampliﬁer—ampliﬁes a low-level signal to line level.
The output from a microphone, a turntable, and many instrument pickups
is lower than line level. Line level is a standard analog audio signal voltage
that is designed for connecting different audio components. What is this
voltage? Well, that’s a good question because even though it is billed as a
standard voltage, it varies depending on the manufacturer. Most are around
1 to 2 volts. A preamp has a signiﬁcant effect on audio quality: A low-quality
preamp will introduce noise and distortion. A good preamp ampliﬁes the
signal cleanly, without introducing defects or color.
NOTE
Audio terminology gets bent in all kinds of ways—many of the preamps you see for
home hi-ﬁsystems are not like microphone preamps because they don’t do any ampliﬁ-
cation but are just switching units where you plug everything in.
Preamps range from bare-bones models that supply only gain (ampli-
ﬁcation) and phantom power to gaudy delights larded up with all kinds
of special effects, dials, and blinky lights. A lot of audio devices come with
gobs of special effects because it costs practically nothing to add them, and
they make you feel like you’re getting something special. If you like lots of
special effects, this is a nice bonus; just don’t let it distract you from a de-
vice’s real quality. At the least it is nice to have some physical knobs. Debates
over which preamps are best almost take on a religious quality. Professionals
might spend thousands of dollars on a single preamp. You’re welcome to do
this, but in my opinion you’re better off starting out with inexpensive gear
and investing in perfecting your recording techniques. Then when you’re
ready to move up to better gear, you’ll appreciate the difference and know
how to get the most out of it.
Speakers and Headphones
Having both speakers and headphones in your audio chain lets you hear
your recordings in different ways. Studio monitor speakers are supposedly
dead-ﬂat and accurate and don’t add any color of their own. They also tend
to be expensive. My own studio speakers are a set of nice JBL three-way
speakers. They’re not real studio monitors, just nice speakers that I like.
Headphones are essential—you need these for monitoring your recordings.
Audio interfaces that include built-in zero-latency headphone ports are per-
fect for monitoring. I seem to collect headphones: I have a nice Plantron-
ics USB headset, which is great for recording podcasts; a set of Sennheiser
headphones with an ordinary 1/4′′ TRS plug; and wireless Audio-Technica
headphones. My studio speakers are powered by a nice old Pioneer SA 7500
stereo ampliﬁer. I’ve had it repaired twice, and I’m going to keep it going
as long as I can. It’s rated at 45 watts per channel, which doesn’t sound like
much, but it powers those watts with some serious amperage. Amps are the
real measure of power in an ampliﬁer; that is what makes the difference be-
tween a wimpy amp and a good strong clean amp. Wattage doesn’t mean all
that much—that’s just the number salespeople like to focus on.

Chapter 2

None of this is super-duper hi-ﬁ, at least not according to fussy audio-
phile standards, but they’re all good components, and they please me.
Your Computer Must Have Muscle and Vast Drawers
Your computer should be a good modern machine with a high-powered
CPU and a lot of RAM. My studio PC has an AMD Phenom triple-core CPU
with 4GB RAM. Multicore CPUs make a big difference. A single-core CPU
should perform ﬁne for two-track recording and simpler recordings like
podcasts and interviews. For example, I have an old ThinkPad with an
800 MHz CPU and 256MB RAM running Linux that performs nicely as a
ﬁeld recorder for interviews. For more than two tracks, multicore is the
way to go. Don’t worry about AMD versus Intel; they’re both ﬁne, so use
whichever you like best.
You need as much storage as you can afford. CD-quality audio (44.1 kHz,
16-bit WAV) uses around 5MB per track per minute. Don’t forget to add up
all the tracks you are using and all the retakes. You can buy terabyte hard
drives, and by the time you read this, they’ll probably be even larger. An-
other option is to combine the capacity of several hard drives in a RAID
(redundant array of inexpensive disks) array. The two RAID levels that are
useful for audio production are RAID 0 and RAID 10. RAID 0, also called
striping, makes two hard disks look like one, so two 500GB drives appear as a
single terabyte drive. RAID 0 is very fast but has the same weakness as a sin-
gle drive—if one drive in the array fails, you’ll probably lose all of your data.
RAID 10 (using a good-quality hardware controller) is mirroring plus
striping, so you get speed and redundancy. Use a good-quality hardware con-
troller; you don’t want some cheapie that dumps more load on your CPU
but instead one that handles the load itself. It’s more expensive of disks than
the popular RAID 5, but it’s more reliable and a lot faster—you get faster
reads and writes and much faster recovery from a failed drive. I wouldn’t
use RAID 5 or 6 arrays for audio recording; in fact, I don’t use them at all
anymore because they’re too fragile, they’re too slow for writes, and they
propagate parity errors too readily.
I wouldn’t worry about building some super-duper RAID array for record-
ing and editing with Audacity, unless you ﬁnd yourself burning through tera-
byte hard drives all the time. I use a single large hard drive on my studio PC
and am ruthless with housekeeping and getting rid of unneeded ﬁles. I use a
nice little four-disk Linux-powered RAID 10 server for backups.
Operating Systems
In this book I will be covering both Linux and Windows. Each one has its
strengths and pitfalls. If you’re a Windows user, XP is still the most reliable
version even though Vista and Windows 7 have been released. You’ll get
the best hardware and software support and the best performance. Vista
presents special problems because of its own high hardware requirements—
it may bog down your system to the point that you can’t comfortably use it
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap

for audio recording, and driver support for many audio devices is immature.
Audio hardware manufacturers seem a little more interested in Windows 7,
but it is still a hog compared to XP. If you want to upgrade from XP, don’t
bother with Vista; go straight to Windows 7. If your audio hardware and soft-
ware work well on XP, then keep them as long as you can.
Linux users have the usual hassles with hardware manufacturers pre-
tending they don’t exist no matter how many products they buy, hype, and
give free support for. Appendix A will tell you what works well in Linux,
and you’ll also ﬁnd links to sites with current information on audio hard-
ware support in Linux. If it’s any consolation, a lot of audio hardware ven-
dors don’t release very good Windows drivers either. Why? Who knows; it
is a mystery that I waste too much time wondering about. Don’t they want
happy customers?
Latency is the enemy of quality audio, so please refer to Chapters 13 and
14 for tips on tweaking your operating system for best audio performance.
Here are system requirements per the Audacity documentation. Assume
the same for Windows 7 as for Vista:
Windows 98, ME
128MB/500 MHz recommended, 64MB/300 MHz
minimum
Windows 2000, XP
512MB/1 GHz recommended, 128MB/300 MHz
minimum
Windows Vista Home Basic
2GB/1 GHz recommended, 512MB/
1 GHz minimum
Windows Vista Home Premium/Business/Ultimate
4GB/2 GHz
recommended, 1GB/1 GHz minimum
Linux
“Audacity will run best with at least 64MB RAM and a 300
MHz processor,” says the Audacity documentation for Linux users. I
recommend a minimum 800 MHz CPU and 256MB RAM for podcasts,
interviews, and two-track music recording and the most powerful three-
or four-core CPU you can afford for multitrack recording and editing.
Portable Recording
There are several good methods for ﬁeld recording. My two favorites are
to ﬁx up a netbook as a portable recording studio or to use a portable dig-
ital recorder. Netbooks are so cool; I’ve been wishing for netbooks ever
since I discovered computers. Ordinary laptops work ﬁne too, and you get
more powerful CPUs. You have all the same options as you do with a desk-
top computer—your choice of preamps, mixers, and other audio interfaces,
microphones, software—and you can do all of your editing on the spot and
even burn CDs. You also have a nice screen and keyboard, instead of the tiny
screens and buttons found on portable digital recorders.

Chapter 2

Pocket digital recorders work wonderfully well and are fun. These range
from tiny keychain fobs that are the audio equivalent of sticky notes to lit-
tle recorders for good-quality voice dictation to high-quality multichannel
recorders. Let’s see what goes into a high-quality unit.
Figure 2-12: The Zoom H2 with an RCA-to-
1/8′′ stereo plug adapter for connecting
to a mixer or any other two-channel stereo
RCA recording or line output
There are a large number of
them that are priced reasonably, and
you can slip one in your pocket and
carry it anywhere. Carry extra batter-
ies and some extra storage cards, and
you’re ready for anything. My per-
sonal favorite is the Zoom Handy H2
(Figure 2-12). It runs on two AA bat-
teries and also has an AC adapter. It
has four built-in good-quality micro-
phones, so you can record either in
two-channel stereo or in four-channel
surround. It has no speakers, but it
comes with earbuds, and it can also
be used as a USB audio interface on
a computer. Its 1/8′′ line input can
be connected directly to the sound
board at concerts, and it also accepts
an external microphone. It uses SD
cards for storage and supports both
WAV and MP3 ﬁle formats. It costs
about $150.
Some other popular and excellent portable digital recorders are the
Olympus LS10, Marantz PMD 620, Marantz PMD 660, Sony PCM-D50, Yama-
ha Pocketrak 2G, and Zoom H4. All are under $600, and all have built-in
mics. Ideally you’ll be able to get your hands on them and give them good
test drives before purchase because they share a common weakness—tiny
LCD control panels with complicated menus. You’ll also want to test noise
levels, because some of them are nice and quiet when you use the internal
mics but are scratchety with external mics. Most of them accept external
mics—some have only 1/8′′ mini-jacks, and some accept full-sized XLR or
TRS plugs. The ones that have XLR jacks don’t always supply phantom pow-
er for condenser mics. A nice option is to use a battery-powered condenser
mic, and then you don’t have to worry about phantom power.
NOTE
Devices that supply phantom power usually advertise “48v phantom power.” But few
mics actually use 48 volts. They usually use much less—as little as 8 to 10 volts.
Building a Good Digital Sound Studio on the Cheap
49

Some other things to look at are battery life, type, and size of storage
cards. Does it have any built-in storage, and what audio ﬁle formats does it
support? Does it come with useful accessories such as AC adapters, wind-
screen, earbuds, and stands?
An interesting variation is the M-Audio Micro Track II. This has no
built-in mics but is a miniature two-channel recording studio meant to be
used with high-quality external mics. It supports both dynamic and con-
denser mics and supplies a full 48v phantom power for condenser mics.
I prefer to use a USB card reader for transferring ﬁles from a portable
recorder to my computer. Usually it’s faster, and it doesn’t run down recorder
batteries.
The Secret of Recording Your Own Great Audio
The “secret” behind making good-quality audio recordings isn’t much of
a secret: The most important factor is blocking out unwanted noises. Our
brains are wonderful at ignoring sounds we don’t want to pay attention to,
but microphones give equal attention to all noises. Blocking unwanted noise
is harder than it sounds because our modern world is very noisy: vehicle traf-
ﬁc, airplanes, appliances, televisions and stereos, ﬂuorescent lights, $2,000
powered subwoofers roaming the streets at 120 decibels in $500 cars, con-
struction, and so forth. High-frequency noises are easier to block than low-
frequency sounds, as we all know from our futile attempts to escape those
four-wheeled powered subwoofers, which pound their way through all
barriers.
Computers add their own sounds—it’s common to pick up hard drive
and fan noise. So before you stock up on fancy recording equipment, job
one is preparing your recording studio:
•
Use a quiet room with sound-absorbing walls or wall coverings. Old car-
pet and blankets work as well as spendy acoustic foam.
•
Place a good directional microphone close to whatever you are record-
ing and aim it carefully.
•
Shield your mic from your PC.
•
Adjust your sound levels carefully, neither too low nor too high.
•
Mount your microphones in shock cages.
But, you may ask, why go to all that trouble? Why not just ﬁx it later? It’s
all just software anyway. My dear reader, if it were as easy as silly TV shows
and movies portray it, there would be no need for soundproofed music re-
cording studios, and no one would ever holler, “Quiet on the set!” You can
mitigate problems somewhat in Audacity, but you get better results making
as good a recording as possible and saving the ﬁx-its for problems you can’t
avoid. It’s nothing like crime shows where ace audio techs can clean up any
recording, no matter how mangled, to perfect high ﬁdelity. That’s beyond
ﬁction and well into fantasy.

Chapter 2

Hearing Ranges
People who live in so-called primitive societies, without all of our
modern “conveniences,” retain keen hearing well into old age. I
suppose if they wanted to make audio recordings, they wouldn’t
have to work so hard at blocking unwanted background noises.
American Indians and Australia’s Aborigines are reported
to have hearing ranges of 10 Hz to 25 kHz. The average person is
on the order of 32 Hz to 18 kHz. The excellent technical review-
er for this book, Alvin Goats, has an extended hearing range of
about 22 kHz. It is not as cool as it sounds because most sounds
above 18 kHz are noise: fans, power supplies, speaker distortions,
and such. He is sometimes accused of being hard of hearing due
to all of the extra sounds masking what other people are saying.
Gordon Hempton is a wonderful artist who calls himself the
Sound Tracker (http://www.soundtracker.com/). Mr. Hempton has
made a career out of recording the pure sounds of nature, with
no human sounds at all. In 1992 he recorded the chorus of dawn
around the globe. In later years he recorded the sounds of the
Mississippi river according to the writings of Mark Twain and the
sounds of Yosemite National Park according to the writings of
John Muir. He uses a Neumann KU-81i Dummy Head (named
Fritz) to simulate as closely as possible how we hear sounds. He
has a released a number of high-quality CDs so you can hear what
a world without noisy people sounds like.
Mr. Hempton began his recording career in the early 1980s.
A lot of the locations that he recorded back then are now too
noisy to record.
Your PC should be dedicated to the job and not used for anything else,
neither gaming nor web surﬁng nor emailing nor anything, because you
want all of your computer’s power dedicated to recording. If you don’t, you
risk generating skips and stutters. Turn off screensavers, all power manage-
ment, and any antivirus or antimalware software. (Windows users, do I need
to say, don’t be connected to the Internet after doing this?) Turn off all un-
necessary services, scheduled jobs, and everything that is not essential.
Your microphone will pick up noise, vibrations, and interference from
a surprising number of sources. If you still have an old cathode ray tube
(CRT) monitor, replace it with a modern ﬂat thin-ﬁlm transistor liquid crys-
tal diode (TFT-LCD) monitor, because CRTs emit radiation and noise. Some-
times they even resonate to certain sounds and create echoes.
You can make an effective sound barrier between mic and computer
for cheap by attaching a piece of carpet to a piece of plywood or particle

Don’t Smoke
Smoking is bad for you, and it’s bad for computers and au-
dio gear, especially microphones. It’s nasty for visitors to your
studio—they may not appreciate breathing secondhand smoke
and having to shower and change after they leave.
board. Give it feet so it stands on its own, and you have the equivalent of
an expensive piece of a high-tech sound barrier. Both laptop and desktop
machines should sit on nonresonating surfaces. In a pinch, you can set your
laptop on a coat or a pillow, being careful to not block its cooling vents.
Although many how-tos advise making your studio as acoustically “dead”
as possible, without any echoes or resonance, feel free to experiment. You
might like how some things sound in a space with some hard surfaces. Psycho-
acoustics come into play in professional recording studios; they don’t make
perfect anechoic chambers because those are so ﬂat that they sound un-
pleasant. There is no sound reﬂection, nothing that gives depth to sound.
So, professional studios reduce the amount of random noise while preserv-
ing some depth to the sound.

TRANSFERRING VINYL LPS (AND
OTHER LEGACY MEDIA) TO CD
A great way to preserve and enjoy old
recordings is to transfer them from any
legacy medium—vinyl LPs, cassette tapes,
reel-to-reel tapes, vintage 78s, videocassettes,
even eight-track tapes—to CD. Or you can transfer
them to a hard drive, solid-state drive, or whatever
digital storage medium you prefer.
Transferring phonograph records to CD is in demand, and you might
even be able to get a nice sideline going doing this. A lot of people are still
hanging on to their record collections but are afraid to enjoy them because
LPs are fragile. A lot of great albums have never been released on commer-
cial CDs, or the modern CD remasters are not done well. Some people sim-
ply prefer the sound of their old records.
Although you can copy any analog media and convert it to any digital
audio format, in this chapter we’ll talk mostly about transferring vinyl record
albums and singles to CDs. Once you have converted your old analog media
to a digital format, Audacity has a number of tools for cleaning up the sound
quality. You may not always be able to perform perfect restorations, but
you can reduce hiss, clicks, pops, and other defects to quite tolerable levels.

You can also customize dynamic range compression to suit your own needs,
which is a nice thing because on modern popular CDs, dynamic range com-
pression is abused to where it spoils the music. Even if they did it well, it
might not be right for you, so Audacity lets you do it your way.
Finally, we’ll discuss the merits of vinyl versus CD and other media, as
well as the ins and out of connecting your various playback devices to your
computer. If you need help setting up your hardware, skip ahead to the
“Connecting Legacy Devices to Your Computer” on page 67 ﬁrst.
For those of you with golden ears who are not satisﬁed with 16/44.1
CDs, the DVD-Audio format supports up to 24/196. That’s right, 24 bits at
196,000 samples per second. DVD-Audio supports 5.1 surround sound, and
so does Audacity in the 1.3.x releases. If you’re not into surround sound,
you can cram several CDs worth of music at 16/44.1 onto a DVD. We’ll learn
about authoring DVD-Audio disks in Chapter 6.
Okay then, let’s dive into copying, editing, and then making CDs. Please
review Chapter 1 if you need a refresher on the basics of using Audacity.
Preparing Vinyl LPs for Copying
First, clean up your vinyl records as well as you can. Sure, you can do a lot
to clean up digital audio ﬁles, but it’s not like on TV where the ace lab tech
makes pristine restorations effortlessly. That’s ﬁction, my dear readers, and
we are stuck in the real world. It’s better to start with the best-quality record-
ing possible; it’s less work, and you get better results.
I have my nice old Discwasher brushes from the olden days, and it’s a
good thing because the new ones are inferior. Real Discwasher brushes have
a directional nap—hold them one way to clean the record, and then reverse
your stroke on a clean lint-free cloth to clean the brush. There is an arrow
embedded on the handle that points to the leading edge. You can use a real
Discwasher brush dry or with a wet cleaning solution. The correct way to
wet-clean with Discwasher is to apply the cleaning solution to the leading
edge of the brush only, leaving the rest of it dry. You can clean a record on
your turntable while it’s rotating, but be careful you don’t apply so much
pressure that you damage the motor. Apply the wet leading edge of the
brush for three to four turns, and then roll the brush to bring the dry part
in contact with the record for another three to four turns. Give it time to
dry completely before playing it, because playing a wet record can damage
it. (However, on a record that is already in bad, nothing-to-lose condition,
playing it wet might make it sound better. Moisten it carefully with distilled
water or Discwasher D4 ﬂuid, and give it a whirl. It won’t hurt your stylus.)
A nice thing to have for everyday cleaning is a carbon antistatic brush.
These are always used dry and are pretty good at lifting out dust, lint, and
other particles that try to make a home on your records. But they’re no
good for cleaning ﬁngerprints, sticky goo, or other muck that requires a
wet cleaner.
There are all kinds of cleaning solutions, microﬁber cloths, brushes,
and even wet power washers. The debates over the best ways to clean vinyl

Chapter 3

The History of Record Production
The earliest recordings were made on rotating wax cylinders with
a needle in the middle of a vibrating diaphragm attached to a
horn, like an old-fashioned ear trumpet. The horn functioned
like a microphone. The needle vibrations cut an uneven groove
into the wax. Modern mono recordings were made using the
same principle of a vibrating needle cutting into a softer mate-
rial, except the needle was moved by a magnet.
Stereo came about when someone experimented with the
angle of the magnet with respect to the needle and found that
it could be controlled precisely enough to cut each side of the
groove differently, creating two stereo channels. The technology
for producing vinyl records, even with the advent of CDs and dig-
ital audio, has continued to improve, and some record labels are
still producing high-quality vinyl recordings. With all of these ad-
vances, it’s still a single needle doing the recording and playback
for two channels, which results in a bit of crosstalk, so precision
tuning of your turntable is required to get the best performance.
records are endless and loud; I shall leave it to you to do your own home-
work and ﬁgure out what you prefer. You can pick up nasty, dirty, nothing-
to-lose records to practice on at thrift shops for cheap. Given the variety of
claims over what works best, I suspect that vinyl is tougher than we give it
credit for.
NOTE
Never use any kind of alcohol on vintage 78 rpm records or any acetate or nonvinyl
records because it will damage them. The earliest records were made of wax, and there
were many different wax compositions using carnuba, beeswax, and other materials.
People who know about these things recommend not using liquid cleaners at all. If you
have vintage records, I recommend consulting experts who know how to handle them
safely. Solutions containing alcohol are ﬁne for modern vinyl records, and most record
cleaners contain alcohol. Whatever cleaner you use, it must be something that leaves
no residue.
You should also invest in a stylus brush and cleaner, because gunk builds
up on your stylus. This is less controversial; I use the Stanton SC-4 brush and
cleaner, and they do the job just ﬁne. Remember, you cannot be too care-
ful when you’re handling your turntable’s stylus; handle it as gently as you
possibly can by its mounting brace only. Never touch it with your ﬁngers.
Use a stylus gauge to adjust the vertical tracking force of your stylus.
High-quality cartridges require a mere 0.5 to 3 grams. Medium-quality styli,
and those designed for DJs, go as high as 5 grams. Set the tracking force per
the instructions for your particular hardware. Too light and too heavy will
both cause too much wear, so you really want it just right.
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
55

Depending on your turntable and tonearm, you may also have antiskate,
vertical tracking angle, and azimuth adjustments. Your turntable documen-
tation should tell you all about what these are and how to adjust them. The
idea is to make correctly aligned contact without causing asymmetrical wear.
It is worth spending some time tuning your turntable, and you may be sur-
prised at how much difference tiny adjustments make.
Eight Steps to Converting Records to CDs
First let’s list all the steps and then in the next sections go through them in
detail. Vintage records require some special handling, which we’ll get to in
“Copying Vintage 78s” on page 66. If you don’t know how to hook up your
turntable, visit “Connecting Legacy Devices to Your Computer” on page 67
ﬁrst. These are the steps to follow:
1.
Set Audacity’s frame rate to CDDA frames in the Selection toolbar.
2.
Set the project rate to 32-bit ﬂoat/44.1 or 16/44.1.
3.
Copy your album into Audacity into one long track.
4.
Make any ﬁxes such as removing noise and pops, normalizing, compress-
ing, and deleting unnecessary bits.
5.
Enter metadata.
6.
Export the Audacity tracks to CD-ready audio ﬁles.
7.
Use your favorite CD-writing software to copy your songs to a CD.
8.
Pop your new CD into a player and enjoy.
The most time-consuming part is ﬁxing defects. This chapter has some
tips for common ﬁxes, and Chapter 12 is devoted entirely to ﬁx-its and cleanups.
I like to record singles a little differently than in step 3: I prefer to record
each single into its own track, so it looks like Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: Putting each song into a separate Audacity track
56
Chapter 3

Use the Track menu on each track to enter the song titles as the track
names. At export, when all the tracks are exported to CD-ready ﬁles, each
ﬁle will take the track name.
The advantage of using individual Audacity tracks per single is it’s eas-
ier to reorder them, and you can normalize volume levels in one operation.
When all the songs are in one track, normalization won’t bring the quiet
songs up to the same volume as the loud songs. Any variances have to be cor-
rected one song at a time. But when multiple tracks are normalized, all of
them are brought up to the same volume level in one step.
Audacity Settings
First, set the correct frame rate for CD audio in the Selection toolbar, as Fig-
ure 3-2 shows. This ensures that any splits you make will start and end on
a CD frame. Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and
possibly create clicking noises. You can choose either hh:mm:ss + CDDA
frames (75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time plus
CD frames, and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To” box
to ensure that stops and starts are always on the CD frame boundaries.
Figure 3-2: Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio
Then set your quality preferences in the Edit > Preferences > Qual-
ity dialog to a sample rate of 44,100 Hz and a bit depth of 32-bit ﬂoat. The
Red Book CD Audio standard is 16/44.1, but if you have enough disk space,
working in 32-bit ﬂoat has a number of advantages. It gives you the largest
possible dynamic range, which means less noise and a lot of headroom for
editing, so you can do a lot of processing with losing quality.
Recording at 16/44.1 works ﬁne if you want to conserve disk space,
especially if you’re doing straight copying with minimal editing. The more
manipulation you do, the better it is to work in 32-bit ﬂoat.
While you’re in the Preferences menu, review these options as well:
•
On the Recording tab, uncheck “Overdub: Play other tracks while re-
cording new one” and “Software Playthrough: Listen while recording or
monitoring new track.”
•
On the Import/Export tab, check “Show Metadata Editor prior to
export.”
•
Make sure the number of recording channels is set correctly (Devices
tab), which is two-channel stereo. Even old mono LPs use two tracks.

Recording
Then click File > Save Project As and give your project a name, start your
record player, and set your recording levels. You have plenty of headroom,
so give yourself some space to avoid clipping. Using a 32-bit ﬂoat bit depth
means you can record to a peak of −24 dB and still have more dynamic
range than your hardware can use; I usually record to a peak of −9 dB be-
cause a record is not unpredictable like a live show. If it surprises me with
a sudden super-loud passage, I can easily re-record it. Click View > Show
Clipping, and Audacity will highlight any clipping with a bright red line.
Then click the Record button and start playing your record. There’s
nothing much to do except kick back and enjoy the music until it’s time to
ﬂip to side two. Click the Pause button to pause recording while you ﬂip the
record. Every time you click Record, it starts a new track, so use Pause to
keep going on the same track. If you accidentally hit Stop instead, you can
append to your existing track with SHIFT-Record.
It is a good idea to record some noise, like at the beginning of the record
before the music starts and at the end after the music stops, so you can do
some effective noise removal later. A pure noise sample with no music in it is
best. Save this in a separate track.
Fixing Defects
First do a rough trim to delete any unwanted sections. Don’t cut too closely
but leave some extra, and then apply the ﬁnishing touches later. Trimming
away unwanted sections of your tracks is easy; just select the parts you don’t
want and press the DELETE key, or click the Cut button. Another way to do
deletions is to select what you want to keep and then click the Trim button.
This keeps your selection and deletes the rest.
Deleting part of a track makes it shorter, and sometimes you might not
want to do this but rather keep it the same length. Do this by silencing in-
stead of deleting—select the part you want to get rid of and click the Silence
button. This makes it silent instead of removing it, and your track stays the
same length.
The next step is to ﬁx any clipping or scratches. It is common for de-
fects to be in only one channel. This is more characteristic of vinyl because
the needle is pushed by the groove, so the side pushing the needle inward
gets more wear. Tapes will also wear unevenly because one track is on the
“inside” away from the edge of the tape. The track closest to the edge will be
affected the most by magnetism, electrical ﬁelds, and physical damage from
the tape guides.
NOTE
The deﬁnition of track is a bit squishy. An audio track is a single mono track or a
two-channel stereo track, or it’s a single song on a long track with multiple songs.
To ﬁx a defect in only one channel, use the Split Stereo Track command
in the Track panel to break your stereo track into two separate tracks. Then
you can edit each one separately, and when you’re ﬁnished, you can use

Make Stereo Track to put them back together. A nice beneﬁt of dividing
them is that the undamaged track will mask less-than-perfect repairs in the
other track.
Did you know you can insert silence? If you need to pad a track and
make it a little longer or you need to insert a silent gap, ﬁrst click to mark
Figure 3-3: Inserting two
seconds of silence
the point where you want to insert some silence.
Then click Generate > Silence, enter how long
you it want to be, and click OK. The new silent
portion will be inserted to the right of your mark.
Figure 3-3 shows how to create a two-second si-
lence. Note that it contains a drop-down menu
just like the Selection toolbar, with all differ-
ent types of values to use: seconds, hours/min-
utes/seconds, different frame rates, and so on.
Fade In, Fade Out
Figure 3-4: Fade to silence, then back
to normal using the Envelope tool
Fading in and out is done a lot in record-
ings. In Figure 3-4 I deleted a long bor-
ing stretch of applause and left about a
three-second gap, and then I used the
Envelope tool to gracefully fade out to si-
lence and then back in. The Envelope
tool gives you a great deal of control
over fades and volume levels. The little
white squares are control nodes. Create
new nodes by clicking wherever you want
them, drag them in any direction to raise
or lower volume, and drag them beyond
the track borders to get rid of them. En-
velope tools are standard in nearly all
audio-editing applications.
Another way to apply fades is with Effect > Fade Out and Fade In. Se-
lect the part of your track where you want it to fade, click Effect > Fade Out
or Fade In, and it will automatically apply a graceful, uniform fade for you.
You control only the length of the fade.
Some CD-writing applications automatically create a two-second gap be-
tween audio tracks, so beware. You might not want a gap between songs in
a live performance or a gap added to the one that you created in Audacity.
Good CD-writing applications let you control this behavior.
Fixing Warps
Audacity won’t ﬁx a warped record. A top-quality turntable will track a warped
record more accurately than a low-budget turntable. Many how-tos suggest
ﬂattening the warp by carefully warming the record to soften it—in an oven,
in a sunny window, in a warm vehicle—and then placing it inside a clean pa-
per sleeve and putting it under a heavy weight. I have tried the warm vehicle
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
59

method because the idea of using an oven scares me, and sometimes it works
well if you are careful and ﬁnicky about keeping everything clean. Pressing
debris into the soft, warm vinyl won’t improve it any.
You can use Audacity to mitigate some of the bad sounds created by a
warped record, such as clicks, pops, and hiss; see the next section.
Fixing Skips and Pops
You can ﬁnd any skips or pops caused by scratches or warps pretty easily by
looking at the waveform, as Figure 3-5 shows. They appear as abrupt, slender
peaks. Effect > Click Removal is pretty good at removing clicks in batches
without removing music. It looks for spikes in the waveform that are typical
of the pops caused by scratches, deletes the scratches, and then does a bit of
interpolation to reconstruct the waveform. The Select threshold setting de-
termines the sensitivity for deciding when a spike is a scratch. Smaller Select
threshold values are more sensitive, and larger values are less sensitive. Too
much sensitivity means something you want to keep might be identiﬁed as a
click and removed, such as some percussion effects.
Figure 3-5: The area to the left of the cursor line is between songs
and should be relatively ﬂat, but this example is from a record
with a lot of little scratches, so you see many sudden, slender
peaks instead.
The Max spike width value determines the maximum length of a seg-
ment, in milliseconds (ms), that the Click Removal tool will remove. The
default is 20 ms, which is longer than most scratches.
Select a small segment of a track that has some scratches on it and
try a bit of trial and error, which goes quickly thanks to the Click Removal
effect’s Preview button. Listen to the preview, and if it doesn’t sound right,
change the settings and try again. The defaults are pretty good, and once
you have the settings tweaked to your satisfaction, go ahead and apply them
to the whole track.

Chapter 3

NOTE
The default preview length is three seconds. If that is too short, open the Edit > Prefer-
ences > Playback > Length of Preview dialog and make it longer.
You may want to repair a click or pop manually, especially if there are
only a few of them. It doesn’t take long. One way is to select Effect > Am-
plify and lower it to −50 dB, which will
Figure 3-6: Using the Repair tool, be-
fore and after, to repair some clipping
silence it. Another way is to use the Re-
pair tool, which is more surgical. Zoom
in until you can see the individual sam-
ples, select a segment to operate on, and
click Effect > Repair. The Repair tool
operates on a maximum of 128 samples.
Just like the Click Removal tool, it uses
interpolation to reduce and smooth out
the edges of the repaired segment, so it
doesn’t leave a gap. (Figure 3-6 shows
the before and after.)
NOTE
Remember the Zoom tool—you can magnify your waveform enough to see the individ-
ual samples and give yourself plenty of room to make precise edits. To keep your place
when you’re zooming in and out, click to mark your location on the track, and the
Zoom tool will automatically center on your mark.
Finding and Repairing Clipping
Use View > Show Clipping to quickly ﬁnd any clipped segments. Clipping
is caused when the volume of your recording goes over 0 dB. Clipping is
nasty in digital audio because it causes distortion. An easy way to ﬁx a brief
clipped segment is with the Amplify effect. Zoom in and carefully select
the clipped segment, and then select Effect > Amplify to bring it down a
notch or two. Use a negative value for the Ampliﬁcation setting, such as
−3.0. One decibel is about the smallest level of change we can perceive,
and every 3 decibels doubles or, when reducing amplitude, halves the vol-
ume level. So −3 dB is half as loud as 0 dB, and −6 dB is half as loud as
−3 dB. Clipped passages over a few seconds long should be rerecorded.
Noise Removal
Vinyl LPs, on even the ﬁnest systems, are never completely silent. There is
always some sort of background noise: hiss, turntable rumble, tiny scratchy
noises from static electricity or pressing defects in the vinyl. Open the Effect
> Noise Removal effect to get rid of this unwanted noise. It’s not perfect,
and there is always a trade-off between removing noise without causing too
much damage to the music. It works best when you have a good noise pro-
ﬁle and the noise is distinctly different from what you want to keep.
First you need to build a proﬁle of the noise you want to remove, so se-
lect a few seconds of your track that has only noise, such as the very begin-
ning or very end where the stylus is traveling over the record but not over
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
61

the music. The longer your noise sample, the better, from 5 seconds up to
30 seconds or so. Select your noise sample, and then in the Effect > Noise
Removal dialog, click the Get Noise Proﬁle button. Next, select the segment
that you want to apply noise removal to and click OK. You can use the Pre-
view button to make sure it’s doing it right before hitting OK. Apply Noise
Removal as precisely as you can to minimize side effects. Hiss, wow and ﬂut-
ter, hum, and low-level scratchiness are all common defects, and the Noise
Removal tool works well if you have a good clean noise sample.
If you don’t like the results, press CTRL-Z to undo, change some settings,
and try it again. The default noise reduction level is −24 dB, which means
segments identiﬁed as noise are attenuated by −24 dB. If this removes too
much of the recording, reduce this and try it again. A similar tactic that of-
ten works well is to go back to your noise sample, reduce its amplitude a few
dB, create a new proﬁle, and try again. You don’t want to erase the noise
completely because this may erase things you want to keep, just lower it to
where it’s not bothersome.
The Frequency smoothing and Attack/decay time sliders are more ag-
gressive when you move them left and less aggressive on the right sides of
the scales. A larger value for frequency smoothing means it treats a wider
range of frequencies as the same, so it makes larger changes. Attack is how
hard a note is hit, and decay is how long it takes to fade away. Since there is
only one Attack/decay time slider, the attack and decay times will always be
the same. Smaller values are more abrupt, and larger values are more grad-
ual.
Another slick trick is to use the Equalization effect (see Chapter 11 to
learn more) to reduce hiss or rumble by reducing the amplitude of frequen-
cies below 500 Hz and above 15,000 Hz. Of course, this will also affect any
sounds in this range that you want to keep, so it’s not always the best solu-
tion, but it is one more thing to try. You can try this in any part of the fre-
quency range that contains unwanted noise.
Another way to limit a range of frequencies is to use a high-pass or low-
pass ﬁlter. A high-pass ﬁlter blocks low frequencies and allows high frequen-
cies to pass, while a low-pass ﬁlter blocks high frequencies. You may need
to install some plug-ins to get high- and low-pass ﬁlters for Audacity; look in
your Effects menu to see what is installed on your system. (Chapter 11 tells
where to ﬁnd and how to install plug-ins.)
Customizing Dynamic Range Compression
You may want to tailor the dynamic range of your recording for more com-
fortable listening in different environments. Because listening to a record-
ing with a wide dynamic range in a noisy environment like a vehicle or at
work means it’s always too loud or too soft, you can change this with a dy-
namic range compressor. Compressors are used all the time in audio produc-
tion. I think they’re overused, but the neat thing with Audacity is you can
62
Chapter 3

adjust it to please yourself. A compressor usually attenuates the louder fre-
quencies, reducing the difference between the soft and loud passages. Some
compressors also boost the quieter frequencies. “Compress Dynamic Range”
on page 240 tells all about how to apply compression to your recordings.
Normalization
Now that you are ﬁnished with repairs, it is time to normalize the volume
for the whole album. If you copied everything to a single Audacity track,
select the entire track and apply Effect > Normalize. This won’t affect the
dynamic range or change audio quality; all it does is raise the overall vol-
ume level. Set your maximum amplitude no higher than 0.0, which is the
maximum for digital audio, and make sure that “Remove any DC offset” is
checked. DC offset refers to the mean amplitude. If this is not zero, then
normalization won’t be applied correctly because the amplitude levels will
be unbalanced, and it might even create a bit of distortion. When this is ﬁn-
ished, you’re ready to go on to the next section.
If you put each song into a separate Audacity track, press CTRL-A to se-
lect all tracks and then apply normalization. Then skip ahead to “Exporting
to CD-Ready Files, Multiple Audacity Tracks” on page 64.
Dividing a Long Track into Individual Songs
If you copied everything into one long track, you can export this to a 16-bit
WAV ﬁle and then copy it to a CD. But you won’t have individual songs; in-
stead, you’ll have one long track with no way to skip between songs. So here
is how to divide it into individual songs. Start at the very beginning; make
sure you are exactly at the beginning of the track by pressing the HOME key.
Then press CTRL-B. This will create a new label track under your album
track, and the cursor will be inside a little text box. Type the name of the
ﬁrst song into this little box and press ENTER. Then click wherever you want
the break to go between the ﬁrst and second songs, press CTRL-B, and type
in the name of the second song. Keep going until all the songs have their
name labels (Figure 3-7).

Exporting to CD-Ready Files, One Long Audacity Track
If you have copied all your songs into one long Audacity track, this is how
you export them to individual CD-ready audio ﬁles. First open File > Open
Metadata Editor and enter the album title and artist’s name, as well as any
other information that you want to preserve in the track metadata. Leave the
Track Title and Track Number ﬁelds blank, because Audacity will ﬁll those
in for you.
Next, go to File > Export Multiple and choose Export Format: WAV
(Microsoft) signed 16 bit PCM. You’ll see a window like Figure 3-8. I rec-
ommend exporting to a separate directory and not mixing your exports
with your Audacity project ﬁles. Select the “Split ﬁles based on: Labels” and
“Name ﬁles: Using Label/Track Name” radio buttons. Check the “Overwrite
existing ﬁles” box only if you are sure you want newly exported ﬁles to re-
place old ﬁles with the same name. Click OK, and you’re on your way.
Figure 3-8: Exporting each song into an individual, CD-
ready audio ﬁle using the label names as the ﬁlenames
If you enabled “Show Metadata Editor prior to export” in the Edit >
Preferences > Import/Export dialog as I suggested, the Metadata Editor will
appear for every song as it exports. It is okay to turn it off if you don’t need
to review the metadata for every song.
Exporting to CD-Ready Files, Multiple Audacity Tracks
If you copied each song to an individual Audacity track, this is how you ex-
port them to individual CD-ready audio ﬁles. First open File > Open Meta-
data Editor and enter any information common to all the tracks, such as
date, genre, or artist’s name. Leave the Track Title and Track Number ﬁelds
blank, because Audacity will ﬁll those in for you.
Next, go to File > Export Multiple and choose Export Format: WAV
(Microsoft) signed 16 bit PCM. You’ll see a window like Figure 3-9. I rec-
ommend using a separate directory and not mixing your exports with your
64
Chapter 3

Audacity project ﬁles. Select the “Split ﬁles based on: Labels” and “Name
ﬁles: Using Label/Track Name” radio buttons. Check the “Overwrite exist-
ing ﬁles” box only if you are sure you want newly exported ﬁles to replace
old ﬁles with the same name. Click OK, and you’re on your way. You will
end up with each song in a separate ﬁle, and the track names you created
will become the ﬁlenames.
Figure 3-9: Exporting each track into an individual CD-
ready audio ﬁle, using the track names as the ﬁlenames.
Writing Songs to a CD
Now you have a batch of nice individual WAV ﬁles, one ﬁle per song. Write
your songs to a CD with your favorite CD writer application, and you’re done.
Don’t burn at the maximum speed, but throttle down to half speed to make
sure you get a good disk. Be sure to select “New Audio Project,” or whatever
your particular application calls making a music CD, because this creates a
CD in the proper Red Book Audio format. Don’t make an ordinary data CD
because then it won’t work in standard CD players, like in your vehicle or
hi-ﬁsystem. Standard CD players can’t play WAV ﬁles. (Computer CD play-
ers will handle just about anything, because it is all done in software media
players.)
Watch the order of your song tracks—your CD-writing application may
put your songs in alphabetical order, rather than track order. A quick way to
sort them is by date, if your CD-writing software supports this, since the ﬁrst
song exported will always be the oldest and the last one the newest.
If you have an inkjet printer that supports printing on CDs and DVDs,
you can get special CD blanks that are made to be printed on. These have
either a white or silver side that is designed to hold ink and not smear. An-
other newfangled printable CD/DVD requires a special thermal printer,
which can be purchased for about $100. A third printable disk type is called
LightScribe, which requires a special CD/DVD writer. These are in the same
price range as ordinary CD/DVD writers, about $50.

“Do I need to buy a special audio CD?”
The answer to this commonly asked question is no. All CDs are
exactly the same type. Some countries charge a tax on “audio”
CDs that supposedly gets paid to musicians to compensate for lost
income from illegal copying. (If they actually receive a fair share
of this tax, I will eat my favorite vinyl LP.) The other special thing
about them is a pressed data ﬂag that is part of the Serial Copy
Management System (SCMS) to control copying protected mate-
rial. The SCMS encoding controls three states: copy allowed (00),
copy once (11), and copy prohibited (10). It won’t stop you from
making copies of an original CD. If the “copy once” ﬂag is set, it
might interfere with putting a copy on a CD writer that attaches to
your hi-ﬁsystem. Computer hardware and media are exempt from
the laws that mandate SCMS. I use ordinary nonaudio CD blanks,
and they work ﬁne in all CD players.
Copying Vintage 78s
Vintage 78s is shorthand for old monophonic phonograph records made
from about the 1890s to the late 1950s. These are also called short-play records
and wide-groove records. There were no real industry standards until the early
1930s, so older records played at a variety of speeds, from 60 to 130 rpm.
Vintage 78s are made of shellac mixed with dyes, ﬁllers, and other materials,
and they come in a range of sizes all the way up to 16" in diameter. Some are
laminated and will come apart if they get wet. Alcohol will dissolve shellac,
and even too much humidity will hurt it.
Vinyl LPs, whether mono or stereo, play at 33 1/3 rpm, and singles play
at 45 rpm or 78 rpm. Yes, way back in the olden days there were 78 rpm
singles; for example, these were favored by Disney in the early 1960s. You
might also ﬁnd some 45 rpm LPs. Two main differences between these and
vintage 78s is they are made of vinyl rather than shellac and they are cut in
microgrooves rather than wide grooves. The coarse-groove records require a
3 mm stylus, while microgroove records use a 1 mm stylus. You can play old
monophonic LPs and singles with a modern stereo cartridge and stylus, but
not vintage records. There are modern cartridges and styli that are made for
playing these old records, such as the popular Shure M78S.
I’m no expert on vintage 78s, but if you need more information on the
correct ways to store, handle, and play these old-timers, there are a lot of
great resources both online and in the real world. There are many vintage
phonograph record experts, aﬁcionados, and traders, so it’s not hard to ﬁnd
some expert guidance.

Chapter 3

Once you have all the hardware and safe handling sorted out, there are
a few things you need to do differently in Audacity. Open the Edit > Pref-
erences > Devices dialog and set the number of recording channels to 1
(mono). Then go to Edit > Preferences > Import/Export and select “Use
custom mix.” The reason for doing this is to mix down to two channels from
your mono track so you’ll hear music in both speakers on your stereo system.
If you don’t do this, you’ll get playback from only one speaker. Figure 3-10
shows you what Audacity’s mixer panel should look like: Move the slider at
the bottom to create two output channels, and then click “Audio Track” (or
whatever name you gave your track) and “Channel: 2” to link them together.
Figure 3-10: Mixing down a mono recording to two channels for
playback on stereo systems
Connecting Legacy Devices to Your Computer
There are several ways to connect turntables and other legacy components
to your computer. First let’s talk about connectors. The terms plug, port,
socket, and jack are thrown around willy-nilly these days. Just to keep it clear
and simple, I shall call the connecters on cables and adapters plugs, and the
things they plug into (like the RCA and TRS sockets on ampliﬁers) are jacks.
Also, in the interest of honoring standard terminology, I shall refer to plugs
and jacks according to gender, male and female. This is especially important
with gender changers, which are adapters for changing from one connec-
tion type to another.
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
67

In the olden days everyone used 1/4′′ (6.3 mm) TRS plugs, and life was
easy. Then manufacturers started making 1/8′′ (3.5 mm) mini-jacks and
plugs and the even dinkier 3/32′′ (2.5 mm) micro-minis. It doesn’t mat-
ter what your devices have because there are adapters to ﬁt any situation.
In fact, it’s common for devices with mini-plugs to include 1/4′′ adapters,
and you can also get adapters to ﬁt 1/4′′ plugs into mini-jacks. Just make
sure you have a correctly matched adapter, either mono or stereo. Mono
TRS plugs have one black insulator ring, and stereo plugs have two.
RCA audio connectors, fortunately, are still the same as they have always
been. RCA plugs come in a rainbow of colors, and each color has a mean-
ing: Red means right channel, white means left channel or mono channel,
and the other colors are for different surround sound channels. They’re all
the same, so it doesn’t matter if you use the “wrong” colors. There is only
one size. They are also called phono plugs. Figure 2-7 on page 37 shows an
assortment of TRS jacks, adapters, male and female RCA connectors, and a
dual-RCA-to-single-stereo-plug adapter. Adapters are inexpensive, and you
always need them, so get a grab bag for all occasions.
My favorite way to digitize legacy media is to connect a stereo ampliﬁer
or receiver to an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter (ADC/DAC),
which then connects to the computer. Then every component that connects
to the amp—turntable, tape deck, radio tuner, VCR, CD, DVD—is available
to record in Audacity. (CDs and DVDs can be played and copied directly on
your computer; see Chapter 5 to learn how to do this.)
You probably already have an ADC/DAC on your computer—your com-
puter’s sound card. If it has a Line In port, you should use that. These are
light blue 1/8′′ stereo jacks. Depending on your amp or receiver, you should
have a pair of standard RCA outputs you can connect to your sound card,
usually called record out or line out. Flip back to Figure 2-2 on page 34 to see
the back of my treasured old Pioneer ampliﬁer.
Figure 3-11: Because
of the proliferation of
1/8′′ mini-plugs, this is
the workhorse of many
a conversion studio.
So, connecting my amp to an internal computer
sound card requires a two-RCA-to-1/8′′ stereo mini-
plug adapter, as in Figure 3-11.
On surround-sound home theater receivers, con-
sult your manual to ﬁgure out the best recording out-
puts. For example, I have an Onkyo 5.1 system with
a pair of RCA tape outputs, just like my old Pioneer
amp. You have to use the remote control to select the
correct output channels, and then it records whatever
is currently playing.
My favorite recording interface is an M-Audio
MobilePre USB, which is a combination microphone
preamp and ADC/DAC. This replaces an internal
computer sound card. The MobilePre supports a
number of different connectors, so I could use the
two-RCA-to-1/8′′ adapter or a two-RCA-to-two-1/4′′
TRS adapter, as in Figure 3-12.
68
Chapter 3

that the Y-adapter (bottom right) is not needed for connect-
ing the MobilePre to the Record outputs on the ampliﬁer.
The Y-adapter comes in handy when I need to use a
headphone jack for my recording source.
Connecting a Turntable to Your Computer
There are several ways to connect a turntable to your computer in addi-
tion to connecting through your ampliﬁer connected to your computer. A
popular method is to use a USB phono preamp that lets you connect any
turntable, even cherished old ones, directly to your computer. In fact, you
might want to look for a good old turntable instead of a modern one, be-
cause it’s hard to match the quality of those old turntables without spending
a mint. You can pick up decent USB phono preamps for cheap, such as the
ART USB Phono Plus V2 for around $100. It includes a gain control, a clip-
ping indicator, a monitor port, a USB port, RCA inputs and outputs, optical
ports, and an S/PDIF port. The ADC/DAC operates at 16/44.1 and 16/48.
It even includes a phono ground connector, which is a must-have for turnta-
bles that have ground wires. If you don’t ground them, you’ll get an annoy-
ing hum.
You need a phono preamp and not just any old preamp, because phono
preamps apply the RIAA equalization curve correction. This is very impor-
tant. The RIAA equalization curve is an industry standard for attenuating bass
frequencies (below 500 Hz) on a vinyl LP and boosting frequencies above
2,120 Hz. Vinyl LPs have to be recorded this way or the bass grooves would
take up most of the album, resulting in short playing time, and the higher
frequencies would barely be audible. When you play a vinyl record, your in-
tegrated ampliﬁer or receiver corrects this imbalance with a built-in phono
preamp that reverses the RIAA curve. It sounds tinny with hardly any bass,
and you can hear this by turning off your speakers and placing your ear
close to the cartridge while a record is playing.
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
69

NOTE
Ampliﬁers and receivers are called integrated because the preamp is built in. Amps
and receivers that accept separate preamps often still have integrated preamps. In
the wacky world of audio components, you may spend more for a bare ampliﬁer that
doesn’t have an integrated preamp or radio tuner. The most expensive stereo amp I
ever saw had a completely blank faceplate with only a power switch, power LED, and
volume knob.
The RIAA equalization curve became widely adopted starting around
1955, so records from before then may have different equalization curves.
If you want to fuss with making your own handcrafted equalization correc-
tions, you can do this in Audacity. Audacity also has a number of prefab
equalization curves, such as Columbia LP, AES, Decca, and RCA. Use an
ordinary preamp instead of a phono preamp to get an uncorrected signal,
copy your album into Audacity, and then apply your own equalization. Fig-
ure 3-13 shows what the RIAA curve equalizer looks like in Audacity.
Figure 3-13: The Equalization effect allows you to ﬁne-tune equal-
ization any way you want, and it supports creating custom presets.
A good way to connect a turntable to your recording interface, as men-
tioned earlier, is to connect your turntable to your stereo receiver or ampli-
ﬁer in the usual manner and then connect your receiver to your computer’s
recording interface.
One more option to consider is buying a USB turntable with its own
built-in phono preamp. These are becoming popular as more people want
to try converting their own albums to CD. It’s a great concept and conve-
nience, but a lot of them are not very good quality, so shop carefully.
My own personal turntable is an Audio-Technica AT-PL120. This is not
a sweet decades-old turntable but a shiny new direct-drive three-speed with
its own internal phono preamp. That’s right, 33 1/3, 45, and 78. It’s de-
signed to be a DJ turntable, so it comes with an elliptical stylus for playing
records both frontward and backward. (The horror! As if I would do that
to a perfectly good LP!) It has adjustable speed, pitch, antiskate, and feet
70
Chapter 3

levelers, and it’s weighty and solid as a good turntable should be. The inter-
nal preamp is switchable, so you can either connect it directly to a record-
ing interface or switch off the internal preamp and connect to an external
phono preamp. If you want to play vintage 78s, you need to purchase a spe-
cial cartridge and stylus, such as the Shure M78S wide-groove monophonic
cartridge.
NOTE
Our excellent technical consultant Alvin notes that radio DJs used direct-drive turn-
tables so they could rotate them backward: “You manually adjust the record so that
you know where the song begins, then turn the record back one quarter of a turn.
When you hit “play” on those record players, the turntable is at full speed in the one
quarter turn.”
Figure 3-14 shows my own setup at home. I have both recording and
playback routed through my M-Audio MobilePre USB.

Connecting a Tape Deck
Tape decks can connect directly to your computer. Just connect their RCA
output plugs to your recording interface with the appropriate adapter. Your
recording interface might already have RCA inputs.
Which Is Better: Vinyl, Tape, or CDs?
There are endless debates over which has superior sound quality, vinyl LPs
or CDs. I’ve been a serious music fan since I was a wee tot way back in the
days of reel-to-reel tapes and vinyl LPs. My dad was a symphony musician
and music teacher, and to this day I don’t believe he has acknowledged any
music made after the 18th century. (Kidding, Dad! Hugs!) I think CDs are
the bee’s knees.
In the olden days before CDs, a lot of music lovers who wanted to pre-
serve their vinyl played a new LP only once, to copy it to tape. It was no use
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
71

purchasing commercially recorded cassettes because of their inferior quality.
They used the cheapest tape and were plagued with hiss, narrow dynamic
range, and overall cruddy tone. By the early ’70s, commercially recorded
reel tapes were pretty much gone from the market, so if you wanted good-
quality tape recordings, you had to do it yourself.
This might sound like a lot of fussiness to readers who are not familiar
with audio tapes and LPs, but there were shortcomings with both media,
and neither one provided a completely satisfactory solution. It’s easier to
skip tracks on an LP and they’re easier to handle than reel tapes, but it’s
nearly impossible to keep them clean and undamaged. Neither one holds
very much music. A vinyl LP holds 16 to 24 minutes per side; modern dance
music LPs hold 12 minutes or less because of the extreme thumping bass,
which creates wider grooves. Don’t even suggest using a record changer—
those are for people who like having mangled records. A 1,200-foot, 7-inch
reel of 1/4′′ tape, which was common for home recording, holds 64 minutes
per side at 3.75 inches per second (ips) and 32 minutes at 7.5 ips. (In com-
parison, professional recordings were made at 15 and 30 ips.) Neither one is
easily portable, and you can’t play them in cars.
Cassette tapes revolutionized home and portable audio. They were
good compromises among sound quality, portability, and cost, and they were
a lot more rugged than reel tapes or LPs. You can stop a cassette tape at any
point and remove it from the machine; you can’t do that very easily with reel
tapes. Cassettes for the home market travel at 1 7/8 ips, and their tapes are
0.15′′ wide. Sound quality isn’t equal to that of LPs and reel tapes, but if you
have a good recorder and use good-quality Type II or IV tape, it is pretty
nice. Whenever I bought a new vehicle (new to me, that is), the ﬁrst thing
I did was put a good sound system in it. I made a lot of long trips because I
liked going places, and having a big box of music tapes made those trips
even more splendid. Cassette tapes came in a variety of sizes, and I liked 90-
minute cassette tapes because I could get two LPs on one tape. A dual-well
cassette player with auto-reverse delivered 180 uninterrupted minutes of mu-
sic. Larger sizes, such as 120-minute cassettes, were too thin and fragile to
use. Thinner tapes stretch; 60-minute, high-quality tapes are thickest and
suffer the least amount of stretch.
Cassette recorders were the salvation of music lovers. My friends and
I liked to make and exchange mix tapes, because even in my youth oh so
long ago commercial radio was pretty horrible, just the same Top 20 dreck
played over and over, with more commercials than music and annoying DJs
interrupting the music. So, trading mix tapes was a great way to discover new
music. Another cool thing was we could copy just the songs we wanted and
not suffer through the ﬁller that plagued so much popular music. Given the
continual failures of the music industry to deliver what would please its cus-
tomers, it’s amazing that it survives at all. The bosses at the big labels should
give thanks every day to determined customers who ﬁgure out workarounds
that let them enjoy commercially produced music, rather than giving up on
it entirely.

Chapter 3

A Quick Tip About Tape
Alvin recalls that tape is manufactured very wide and very long:
“The outermost edges, and the ﬁrst and last lengths of the tape,
are the poorest and used for the lowest-grade audio tape. The
sections that are higher-grade become the higher quality audio
tape, and the very best became the digital tape for computing.
Because of this you can use most computer tape for audio, which
I do. The large quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) tapes that have gone
bad are fantastic reel-to-reel tapes. I have an ancient solid-state
Ampex home audio recorder, circa 1969 (transistors, point-to-
point wired like the old vacuum tubes). With no noise reduction,
1 7/8-, 3 3/4-, and 7 1/2- inch speeds, with RadioShack’s cheapest
tape and slowest speed, it sounds better than cassette metal tape
and Dolby C noise reduction.”
Cassette tapes are also given credit for spreading Western pop music,
especially punk and rock, in developing nations and Eastern bloc countries.
There isn’t much nostalgia for cassette tapes. They served a purpose,
and some people still like them. But it’s not easy to ﬁnd good cassettes any-
more because manufacturing quality has declined.
Neither tape nor vinyl ages well. Tape is a magnetic medium, so it can
be ruined by stray magnetic ﬁelds. Tape is less prone to collect dust and
scratches than vinyl, but both suffer physical wear and tear. Both will last
decades if they are handled and stored carefully, but the sad fact is the more
you play and enjoy them, the more they will wear out. They won’t suddenly
become unplayable; they tend to lose the high frequencies ﬁrst and fade
over time like a garment that is washed too many times.
The Digital Advantage
Lovers of vinyl claim that it sounds warmer, sounds more true to life, and
has a wider and more accurate dynamic range. CD fans claim that LP aﬁ-
cionados are nostalgic for all the ambience that goes along with playing a
vinyl record: the sounds made by the turntable, the addition of surface noise
from dust and scratches, ﬂipping it to hear the other side, and all the fussi-
ness required to keep LPs in good condition. I miss the cover art, posters,
and generously sized booklets that came with LPs—you just can’t do much
with a tiny CD case. But no matter how careful you are with keeping LPs
clean, handling them carefully, keeping your stylus clean, and keeping your
tonearm optimally balanced and tracked, it is impossible to avoid causing
wear or even damage merely by playing them, because you’re scraping a di-
amond stylus with a Mohs’ scale hardness rating of 10 over a surface with a
Mohs’ hardness of 1.
Transferring Vinyl LPs (and Other Legacy Media) to CD
73

Some LPs survive in better condition than others because they are bet-
ter engineered. Vinyl LPs begin life as master tapes. These are copied to the
master disk, which is made of metal or lacquer. Cutting a record is an ex-
ercise in compromise. Quiet passages can’t be too quiet or they will be lost
in noise, but if they are too loud, the grooves will overlap and create skips.
Louder volume also results in less playing time, so there is as much artistry
in the engineering as there is the in music itself. Unfortunately, all LPs are
not created equal. As the industry matured, a multitude of demands were
placed on the master recording engineers, who were often told to make the
master tapes also serve as masters for cassettes, and butchered for radio play.
The vinyl itself became thinner. In other words, the lowest common denomi-
nator reared its mediocre head. Older LPs are beloved because they’re bet-
ter made.
CDs have most of the technical advantages. The biggest advantage of
digital audio is that copies are equal to the originals. This is not true of ana-
log audio, which loses something with each generation. By the time you get
to a copy of a copy of a copy, you know it’s a long way from the original.
A CD offers as much as a 96 dB dynamic range, whereas the best vinyl
delivers maybe 75 dB and, more typically, in the 50s. So, the CD offers a su-
perior signal-to-noise ratio, plus something that even the best LP system is
hard-pressed to deliver, and that is absolute silence in the silent passages.
True, this absolute silence is largely theoretical because some sound will
probably be created somewhere in your audio chain—a bit of hum, a touch
of electrical interference—but the CD itself is dead silent. Vinyl wins on fre-
quency range, sort of—if you have good enough equipment (which would
make you a rare, wealthy, and elite audiophile indeed), it will capture fre-
quencies as high as 70 to 75 kHz, up there where the bats ﬂy. More typically
it falls into the 10 Hz to 25 kHz range.
Down here in the real world, most audio hardware is designed with up-
per limits of 20 to 30 kHz in mind. The human ear can detect frequencies
up to 25 kHz, and the range of sensation is 50 kHz. If you have something
blasting away at 115 dB sound pressure level at a frequency of 45 kHz, you’ll
feel the pain but not know why. Some folks believe that very high frequen-
cies are still perceived in some manner and add to the listener’s enjoyment.
What they might be talking about are the harmonics. If you have a sound at
100 Hz, there are harmonics of that sound at 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 200 Hz, and so
on. If you clip the harmonics, the sound tends to sound a little dead on the
high end.
I have compared some of my favorite music on both CD and LP, and
it’s the extra noise on LPs that sets them apart. I can really tell the differ-
ence in a symphony—the quiet passages on a CD are unmarred by scratches,
hiss, or rumble, and the loud bits are loud and accurate, without distortion.
If you want to make your own comparisons, make sure you have LPs and
CDs that have been recorded with skill and care. An awful lot of them are
junk, and the trend with modern popular music is simply to crank all lev-
els on a CD to the maximum, with no regard for dynamic range, distortion,
nuances, or balance. Pianos and organs are great for testing the quality of

Chapter 3

Wire Recordings
The original master “tapes” were made on wire recorders, which
used spools of steel wire as the recording medium. Wire recorders
were in wide use until the 1960s, when they were supplanted by
magnetic tape recorders. Old music, like the original Carter Fam-
ily recordings of the 1920s, were recorded on wire recorders. Wire
rusts, and the ﬁdelity is nothing to get excited about, but it is very
durable. Even so, most of those old recordings are lost.
But not all! The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949
won the 2008 Grammy for Best Historical Album. It was restored
from wire recordings and is believed to be his only recorded live
performance. Like a lot of wire recorders, these recordings were
made on a home-built device, which complicates any restoration
process. But restored they were, and now you can enjoy Woody
Guthrie live on CD.
your audio system because their sounds are difﬁcult to reproduce accurately,
they have monster dynamic and frequency ranges, and you can tell pretty
easily if they sound right. Try “Toccata and Fugue in D Minor” by Johann
Sebastian Bach; this covers the full range of the pipe organ, the big kind you
see in cathedrals. At one point, a bass pedal is held so long your speakers
may visibly distort. Pink Floyd’s “Time” from the Dark Side of the Moon exer-
cises the sound separation among left, right, and true center. Jimi Hendrix’s
Electric Ladyland, if you can ﬁnd the original double LP and not some bad
CD remaster, is an amazing piece of studio and artistic wizardry that will ex-
ercise your audio system and reward careful listening.
CDs win hands down for convenience. They’re sturdy, they don’t get
damaged from being played, you don’t have to continually fuss with them,
and they are portable. Most CD players have remote controls, and you can
play the tracks in any order or shufﬂe. You can load multiple CDs in a CD
changer without harm and bliss out for hours.
Despite the efforts of the music industry to foil our fair use rights and
desire to enjoy music the way we want to, it’s as easy to create custom-mix
CDs as it was to create our own mix tapes. And for most of the same reasons:
to package music the way we want and to discover new artists. (Chapter 5
tells how to make compilation CDs.) However, we now have two marvelous
new options that we didn’t have back in the olden days, and that is satellite
radio and Internet radio. Neither one is high on the audio quality scale,
but you can’t beat them for variety and discovering new artists. Commercial
broadcast radio is worse than ever, which I didn’t believe was possible.
CDs also win on cost. A hundred dollars buys a perfectly satisfactory CD
player. Even in the olden days, a good-quality turntable, cartridge, and stylus
cost several hundred dollars, and they haven’t gotten any cheaper. Oh, and

CD Players
You can spend a little or a lot on a CD player. Ideally, you’ll be
able to test them with your own sound system before making a
purchase, especially if you’re going for a higher-end model. As
with all digital audio, the quality of the digital-to-analog converter
determines how good it sounds, so spending more can make a
difference. If you are connecting your CD player to a receiver or
ampliﬁer that has its own DAC (you’ll see optical or coaxial digital
inputs), that gives you two DACs to try. Using the digital connec-
tor means the CD player sends a digital signal to your receiver
and does not use its own DAC. Instead, the receiver performs the
conversion to analog. Using your CD player’s RCA connectors
means your CD player will do the conversion and send an analog
signal to your receiver. If you have a high-end CD player, you
probably don’t want your receiver mucking with its output, so
use the analog RCA connectors. Of course, it’s not always that
simple, because in some modern A/V receivers, the integrated
preamp converts all incoming signals with no regard for whether
they are analog or digital, which is dumb, but there it is. This is
not always documented, so you might have to pester your vendor
to ﬁnd out what you have.
don’t forget the dust cover, which was always an overpriced add-on. And a
stylus-tracking force gauge, and cartridge alignment tool, and special clean-
ing accessories, and so on.
So who wins, vinyl or CDs? Easy—whichever one you like better. Don’t
get hung up on specs; it’s the music and your enjoyment that matters.
Longevity
Longevity is still an open question. The current state of digital storage is not
encouraging for the long term, so you better plan to periodically transfer
your archives to fresh media. There are several problems with long-term dig-
ital storage: One, the physical media may not last for more than a few years
without deteriorating. Two, think of all the closed, proprietary ﬁle formats
that have come and gone in the past 10 or 20 years and are no longer read-
able. Three, if your media survive and the ﬁles are still readable, will you
have a hardware device that can read your media? If someone handed you a
5.25′′ disk, a Zip disk, a 3.5′′ diskette, or a super ﬂoppy disk, would you have
any idea what to do with it? Currently we take CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, and
3.5′′ hard drives for granted, but they are all just a few years old, and we do
not know what the future holds.
76
Chapter 3

NOTE
There might be a business opportunity in old drives and software. Alvin notes, “There’s
a market for those who can transfer from the ancient media to current. I have a Viper
QIC tape drive for the DC300 tapes, a Bernouli drive, a Questech 40MB drive (it was
a favorite of Apple Macintosh’s), a TEAC digital audio cassette drive (205MB stor-
age), Zip and Jaz drives, 250MB Colorado QIC, and other ﬂoppy tape drives.”
Commercial CDs are pressed rather than burned like home-created CDs
and will outlive most home-burned CDs because they are built of sturdier
materials and have deeper grooves. CD-Rs will outlive CD-RWs; don’t use
CD-RWs for anything that you want to last more than a year or two.
There are signiﬁcant differences in brands. Taiyo Yuden is the top-of-
the-line manufacturer of CD and DVD blanks. Taiyo Yuden blanks appear
under their own name and under different brand names, but the secondary
vendors change their suppliers often, so you can’t count on the names to
tell you what you’re getting. Genuine Taiyo Yuden blanks are made only in
Japan. There are fakes, so search online to learn how to identify the real deal.
Verbatim, TDK, and Sony are also considered to be good brands, though
they use multiple suppliers. You can read the disk ID after purchase with
diskDVD Identiﬁer and DVDInfo for Windows, DVD Media Inspector for
Mac, and cdrecord and dvd+rw-mediainfo for Linux.

CREATING AND EDITING LIVE TRACKS
FOR CD
CDs are great for storing and distribut-
ing your own recordings, and you can use
Audacity to prepare your tracks for copying
to a CD.
Suppose you have some long tracks recorded in the studio or from a
live performance. You might want to split them into individual songs or cut
out material between songs and knit them together to sound like one long,
unbroken live track. Maybe you’re cutting and pasting the best of several
different recording sessions. Perhaps you have multitrack recordings that
need to be downmixed to two-channel stereo for CD. You want to clean it all
up and make it sound as good as possible.
Recording live shows is challenging. I’ll talk about several different ways
to do this, from inexpensive and easy to more expensive with ultimate con-
trol over the ﬁnal mix. Then we’ll move on to using Audacity to prepare
your recordings for CD.
NOTE
Please review Chapter 1 if you need to review how to use Audacity.

The workﬂow goes like this:
1.
Record stuff.
2.
Apply cleanups and ﬁxes in Audacity.
3.
Create song titles and metadata for individual songs.
4.
Export to two-channel 16/44.1 WAV.
5.
Copy to CD and enjoy!
The most time-consuming part is ﬁx-its and cleanups. If you don’t need
to do a lot of ﬁxing, it goes fast.
Making Good Live Recordings
In Chapter 2, we learned about putting together a recording studio and how
to turn your computer into a digital audio workstation. Making good live
recordings is harder than making good studio recordings because so many
things are out of your control. However, that’s okay, because you’re not nec-
essarily after some sort of technical perfection but rather capturing the ex-
citement and energy.
Getting good two-channel stereo recordings is pretty easy, because nearly
all audio equipment supports two-channel stereo. If you want multichannel
recordings of live shows (for more control of the mix), then you’ll need
more expensive equipment.
One of the biggest potential hurdles relates to who controls the venue’s
sound system. If it is you, then you can do whatever you want. If the per-
formers or venue have their own system and technicians, then you’ll need
their cooperation.
Remember to record some audience noise in case you need to add a
bit more live ﬂavor. You should also record a few minutes’ worth of various
background and audience noises to use later for noise removal. You want
good samples of noise not mixed with music, or anything you want to keep,
for best noise removal.
Portable Digital Recorder
Figure 4-1: The
Zoom H2 on a
microphone stand.
A little portable digital recorder just might surprise you
with how well it can capture a live performance. The
Zoom H2, which is my favorite compact digital recorder,
has four built-in microphones. You can use either the
front pair or rear pair or all four at once to create a spa-
tial, three-dimensional sound. The Zoom comes with a
little stand to put it on any ﬂat surface and a handle that
ﬁts into a mic stand so you can easily position it anywhere
(Figure 4-1). It’s unobtrusive and even looks like an old-
fashioned microphone.
80
Chapter 4

The Zoom has a 1/8′′ stereo line input, which means you can connect
it directly to a mixer. Usually in live shows all instruments and vocalists are
connected to a single sound console, and even the most low-budget console
should have a pair of stereo RCA recording outputs. The Zoom uses a two-
RCA-to-1/8′′ stereo TRS adapter, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: Zoom H2 with a two-RCA-to-1/8′′ stereo
adapter for connecting to a mixing console
Whatever you hear through headphones connected to a monitoring
port on the sound board is how your recording will sound, so ideally there
will be a good person at the sound board keeping all the channels balanced
and sounding good. Because everything is already mixed down to two chan-
nels, your editing options are limited, so it needs to be right during recording.
The Zoom also has a USB 1.1 port to connect to your computer, so you
can record directly to your computer if you prefer, rather than recording to
the Zoom’s SD storage card.
You don’t have to use the Zoom H2 just because I like it—there are
dozens of different great portable digital recorders to choose from, with
all kinds of feature sets.
Laptop with Audacity
Fix up a laptop with Audacity and a decent recording interface, plug into
the sound console at the show, and you can edit and make CDs on the spot.
Copy the raw tracks to a USB stick for performers who want to do their own
editing. If the internal sound card in your laptop does not suit you, try a nice
external USB recording interface like the one in Figure 4-3, which shows a
ThinkPad and M-Audio MobilePre USB all ready to go to the show.
Another option is to use a higher-end PCMCIA sound card like the Digi-
gram VXpocket v2. The Digigram costs about $500. It works on Linux, Win-
dows, and Mac; provides two channels at full duplex; and supports S/PDIF
and XLR connectors.

Multitrack Recording of a Live Performance
Suppose you want more editing and mixing control, and you want to make a
multichannel live recording. How do you do this? With the right knowledge
and a big enough budget to support all the necessary equipment. Audac-
ity records as many tracks at one time as your recording interface supports,
starting with version 1.3.9. Older Audacity releases support a maximum of
16. (See Chapter 9 to learn more about making good multitrack recordings
with Audacity.)
Don’t try this without really knowing what you are doing, because con-
necting things the wrong way will result in bad sound or even damaged equip-
ment. If you do not have control of the PA system at the venue, then you will
need the cooperation and help of the resident sound engineer. Here are
four different ways to approach making live multitrack recordings.
One option is to supply your own microphones and mic every perfor-
mer and instrument separately from the venue’s sound system. Although
this means a lot of microphones and cables everywhere, this lets you use
your own recording equipment independently of the main sound board.
A more common option is to use microphone and instrument cable
splitters to make each mic and instrument cable do double duty. This is
how many professionals record live concerts; they share mics that are run
through splitters, and each team controls its own recording console. Some-
times these are tucked away backstage, and sometimes they have long cable
runs running outside to mobile recording trucks. This setup has a lot of ﬂex-
ibility, and you can add your own mics as you see ﬁt. For example, it seems
to be a rule that no two people can agree on the correct way to mic drums,
so they will set up their own drum mics.
You’ll need splitters, transformers, maybe some resistors and patch pan-
els, and cables, and you’ll need to know how to connect everything. You’ll
need to know the ins and outs of dealing with phantom power and who sup-
plies it, connecting and disconnecting in the correct order, getting along
with the other stage and sound crews, and lots more.
One more option is to connect directly to a mixing console that sup-
ports multichannel outputs. (A good word to know is busses—the more
busses a mixer has, the more ﬂexible its signal routing options.) Then you
82
Chapter 4

don’t need redundant mics or splitters and long cable runs. Look for direct
outs, aux sends, or subgroup outs. Some outputs send signals that are affected
by the mixer controls, so they’ll have fades and special effects as applied by
the console technician. If you want a straight unprocessed signal, that will
depend on the features of the sound console and what the sound tech can
let you use.
If you are the sound engineer and get to use your own equipment,
consider getting a multichannel digital mixer, like the PreSonus Studio-
Live 16-Channel FireWire Digital Mixer. Then you don’t need a separate
ADC/DAC, and you don’t have to puzzle out how to make analog consoles
designed for live shows also make good digital recordings. Sadly, the Studio-
Live is not supported on Linux, but it has excellent software bundles for Mac
and Windows. This is a super nice, new generation mixer that is designed to
support multichannel recording, both in the studio and in the performance
hall. It costs about $2,000, plus you’ll also need an ampliﬁer for powering
live shows.
Be Nice to the Sound Crews
Be nice to the venue’s sound engineers and crew. They are skilled profes-
sionals who have to combine both science and artistry, and they will make
or break your recordings. Don’t act like you know everything, because they
won’t be fooled. In my experience, sound crews at live shows are nice peo-
ple who share their expertise generously as long as you listen carefully, are
helpful, and keep out of their way.
Audacity Settings for Recording
Let’s run through the appropriate recording settings in Edit > Preferences.
(Please visit Chapters 13 and 14 to learn how to tune your PC for audio
recording and managing your sound devices.)
First, open a new Audacity project and use File > Save As to save and
name your new project. You can’t save changes while Audacity is recording,
so you might take advantage of short breaks to stop recording, press CTRL-S
or use File > Save Project, and then pick up where you left off with SHIFT-
Record.
Set your recording and playback devices on the Edit > Preferences >
Devices tab and set the number of channels you are recording. Audacity will
show only the number of channels that your recording interface supports.
Windows users, always select Windows DirectSound and never MME for the
Host, because MME is the antiquated generic Windows sound interface. You
could select Primary Sound Driver for your recording and playback devices
if you have only one sound card. If you have more than one, then select the
speciﬁc recording interface from the drop-down Recording Device menu
(Figure 4-4). (Your selections will be different, unless you have the same au-
dio interfaces that I have.)

Figure 4-5 shows how it looks on a Linux PC:
Figure 4-5: Setting the correct recording and playback devices in the

You’ll probably want to review your recordings during breaks in the
show, so set your playback device to something that outputs to headphones.
On the Recording tab, uncheck “Overdub,” “Software Playthrough,” and
“Sound Activated Recording.” Leave your Latency settings alone unless you
experience dropouts. Dropouts mean your CPU can’t keep up, so increase
the Audio to buffer value until the dropouts stop (Figure 4-6).
The settings on the Quality tab (Figure 4-7) depend on what your analog-
to-digital converter supports. Let’s say you have an analog mixer connected
to a high-end sound card that supports up to 24/96 (24-bit depth, 96 kHz
sampling rate); if you have enough hard drive space, you could record at 32-
bit depth and 96,000 Hz sampling rate for ultimate high quality. (Bit depth is
called Sample Format in this menu. Bit depth is the correct term.)
84
Chapter 4

Figure 4-6: Entering settings on the Recording tab
Figure 4-7: Settings in the Quality tab are determined by what your
recording interface supports and your preference.
My MobilePre maxes out at 16/48, so I set Audacity to 32-bit ﬂoat/48 for
recording. It’s no good setting a higher sampling rate (upsampling) than
your recording interface supports because there is no magic quality infusion.
It wastes disk space and bogs down your CPU, and upsampling hurts audio
quality. But there are beneﬁts to recording at 32-bit ﬂoat even on 16-bit
sound cards, which is explained in Chapter 1. (See “16/44.1, 24/96, 32-Bit
Float” on page 27 to learn more about quality settings.)
If you are recording from a digital mixer or a mixer with its own dig-
ital output, then that will determine your maximum bit depth/sampling
rate. For example, the Behringer Xenyx X2442USB 24-Channel Mixer is
an analog mixer with a built-in ADC that delivers a 16/48 digital signal via
USB. It plugs right into your computer, so you don’t need a sound card. So
you could set Audacity to record at 32-bit ﬂoat/48 for maximum quality. If
16/48 isn’t good enough, you could connect an outboard ADC that supports
higher bit depths and sampling rates to the Xenyx’s RCA analog recording
outputs.

85

Don’t Switch Your Quality Settings Until You’ve Finished!
It is best to stick with the same quality settings throughout record-
ing and editing, until your ﬁnal exports. Changing bit depths
and resampling are not good for audio quality, so the fewer times
a recording is resampled or exported to a lower bit depth, the
better. I record and edit at 32-bit ﬂoat/48 and then export to
different quality levels as I need them, such as 24-bit WAV and
FLAC for highest quality or the lower-quality Ogg Theora or MP3
formats. If you prefer recording and editing at lower quality levels,
such as 16/44.1 (which is CD quality), the same principle applies:
Use 16/44.1 from recording to ﬁnal edit, and then if you want
lower quality levels, select them as needed at export.
There isn’t much difference between a 44.1 kHz sampling
rate and 48 kHz. The sampling rate determines your frequency
range, which is about half the sample rate. 44.1 kHz covers the
range of human hearing. Sometimes I can hear a small difference
in recordings made at 48 kHz compared to 44.1 kHz recordings,
but I have to be listening for it on a good sound system. There is
a more noticeable difference between 16- and 24-bit recordings.
Start with a high-quality recording, and then you can export to
any number of lesser-quality formats as you want.
Setting Recording Volume Levels
Set your recording levels before you start by clicking the Input Level Meter
(Figure 4-8). Because digital recording has such a high signal-to-noise ratio,
which is also called a low noise ﬂoor, you can set a conservative peak level to
allow for the unpredictability of a live performance. It’s not like recording

itor to set your peak recording levels
before starting recording.
on tape where we had to push recording
levels as high as possible to keep noise
levels at acceptable levels; you don’t want
to go over zero in digital audio because
that causes distortion. I aim for a peak
level of −24 dB for live shows. The Me-
ter toolbar has a little handle on the
right to make it longer or shorter, and
the handle on the left is for dragging
it anywhere you want, even outside of
Audacity.

Chapter 4

Starting, Stopping, and Pausing Recording
When you’re ready to start recording, just click the red Record button. Click
Pause to stop and then Record to continue on the same track. Clicking Stop
and then Record starts new tracks, so if you stop when you meant to pause,
pick up again on the same track by pressing SHIFT-Record.
Monitoring Your Live Recording
The best way to monitor your recording is by plugging headphones into a
monitoring port. For example, the MobilePre has a zero-latency monitoring
port, and there are always monitoring ports on mixers. The better recording
interfaces have zero-latency monitoring ports, which is a good thing to look
for when you’re shopping.
Editing Live Recordings
Well, that was fun! You heard a great show, or had a wonderful studio ses-
sion, and recorded everything successfully. Now how do you get all that
goodness onto a CD?
If you used a digital recorder, you need to copy the ﬁles from the recorder
into your Audacity computer. I prefer to use a separate storage card reader
rather than connecting the recorder to the computer because it usually works
better and faster, especially on non-Windows PCs. Any SD or Compact Flash
card should be seen by your PC as a generic USB storage device, but man-
ufacturers love to infest devices that use them with weird Windows-only ﬁle
transfer managers. This does not make sense to me, since Windows has a
perfectly good built-in USB storage device manager. Many of them also have
a fondness for using USB 1.1, and not the full-speed 12Mbps but the agoniz-
ingly slow 1.5Mbps version, which is super fun when you ﬁll a multigigabyte
SD card.
However you do it, once your recording is transferred to your Audacity
PC, open Audacity and use File > Open to import your recording into Au-
dacity. Then save this new Audacity project with File > Save Project As
Figure 4-9: Making a copy of your original
recording to preserve it
and give it a different name than
your audio ﬁlename. Audacity
will warn you that “Project de-
pends on other audio ﬁles” (Fig-
ure 4-9) and ask whether you
want to copy all audio into your
project. Click Copy All Audio
into Project (Safer). Now you
have your original and a copy,
and whatever you do in your Au-
dacity project does not touch
the original ﬁle. (See “Saving
Your Work” on page 13 to learn
more.)

If your recording has multiple ﬁles, create a separate Audacity project
for each one. I like to use related project names like Fiddle-Festival-1, Fiddle-
Festival-2, and so on.
If you made your original recording in Audacity, you can work from
your original project ﬁle, which will change it, or you can make a copy and
work from that. To make a copy, click File > Save Project As to save it with a
different name.
Editing and Downmixing Multitrack Recordings
You can skip this section if you are working from a two-channel stereo
recording.
This section is a short review of multichannel downmixing, so please
visit Chapter 9 to learn about multitrack recording and mixing in detail.
If you made a multitrack recording, which is three tracks or more, you
have a lot more great editing options than with a two-channel stereo mix.
One track per vocalist or instrument gives you ultimate control, and even if
you had to settle for subgroups because of limitations of the mixer, this is
still a feast of ﬂexibility.
Starting in Audacity version 1.3.8, you can use the sleek new Mixer Board
to adjust the pan and gain on each track by selecting View > Mixer Board.
The playback in Audacity is exactly how your mix sounds, so you get an accu-
rate preview of your mix.
Of course, you can still use the Pan and Gain controls on the Track pan-
els of each track if you prefer.
Editing and ﬁxing your tracks is the same whether you have a stereo
mix or a multitrack recording, which we’ll cover in the following sections.
There are some special hazards with multiple tracks. One is keeping them
synchronized. Be careful with deletions and additions, because this changes
the length of the tracks. Another is downmixing to two-channel stereo com-
bines tracks so they get louder and might create clipping. Third is the Link
Tracks button, which ﬁrst appeared in Audacity 1.3.9. This keeps label tracks
synchronized with the audio tracks. Having a label track at the top of your
project is useful for making notes, and it does not link to the tracks below
Figure 4-10: Chain
links appear when
the Link Tracks
button is active.
it. But a label track that lies underneath your audio
tracks, which is where new label tracks always appear
when you create new ones, creates a track group that
includes all the audio tracks above it. Link Tracks is
enabled by default, so if it gets in your way, just click
the Link Tracks button to turn it off. Newer Audac-
ity versions display chain links that appear when you
make any selection or Time Shift tracks to indicate
that Link Tracks is active (Figure 4-10).
There are two ways to downmix. This ﬁrst method is clicking Tracks >
Mix and Render, which creates a new stereo track in your Audacity project.
You can then make further adjustments before export, such as creating la-
bels, ﬁxes, and other edits. It will sound just like the playback in Audacity
88
Chapter 4

sounds, so when it sounds right in Audacity, it’s ready to go. First set your
left, right, and mono channel assignments in the Track menus. Left is chan-
nel 1, right is channel 2, and mono tracks are mixed down to both.
When you click Tracks > Mix and Render, your tracks are replaced with
a new stereo track. If you would rather have Audacity create a new stereo
track without replacing your original tracks, use the keyboard combination
CTRL-SHIFT-M. I prefer the second method because I want to save my origi-
nal tracks. Then I copy the new stereo track into a new project, ﬁnish edit-
ing, and then export.
Downmixing combines tracks, so they get louder. Make sure View >
Clipping is activated so you can quickly ﬁnd clipped passages. You might
reduce the amplitude of all your tracks before downmixing with Effect >
Amplify to −9 or −12 and then apply Effect > Normalize after downmixing
to bring the volume back up where you want.
The second downmixing method opens a custom mixer, which is really
a channel mapper, at export. Open Edit > Preferences > Import/Export,
and select “Use custom mix.” Then select File > Export, and you’ll get a sim-
ple mixer (Figure 4-11) that allows you to control your channel mapping.
This is how you control which tracks go to the right channel, left channel, or
both. Channel 1 is always the left channel.
Figure 4-11: Downmixing a multichannel recording into two stereo tracks
This does not work with File > Export Multiple, so if you want to divide
your downmixed track into individual songs, you’ll have to import it back
into Audacity.

Special CD Settings in Audacity
The next thing you need to do is go to the Selection toolbar and change the
timing to CD frames, which is 75 frames per second (fps). This ensures that
any cuts you make will start and end on a CD frame. Any audio that lands
outside of these frames will be lost and will possibly create clicking noises.
Figure 4-12 shows what this looks like. You can choose either hh:mm:ss +
CDDA frames (75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time
plus CD frames, and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To”
box to ensure that stops and starts are always on the CD frame boundaries.
Figure 4-12: Setting the correct frame rate for CD audio in
the Selection toolbar
While you’re at the Selection toolbar, set the Project Rate value to
44,100 Hz. Audio ﬁles for CD must be 16/44.1 WAV ﬁles. (The bit depth
will be selected at export.)
Trimming
Now it’s time to do some housecleaning on your recording. Remember that
you have a lot of different views to choose from, such as View > Fit in Win-
dow, View > Fit Vertically, and the Zoom tool. Pressing CTRL-2 returns to
Normal view. View > Zoom to Selection is a great little time-saver that ex-
pands your selection to the width of the window. Remember also that Au-
dacity has nearly unlimited undo, even past saves. You don’t lose your undo
history until you close your project.
A good starting point is to trim away any excess. When you select un-
wanted segments for deletion, leave a little extra. You can always trim more,
but it’s harder to put it back. The shaded area in Figure 4-13 is a bunch of
people speechifying and is not something I want to save, so it’s gone all in
one swoop. There doesn’t appear to be anything at the beginning or in be-
tween the songs to trim right now, so I’ll leave those alone until later.
Another way to trim a lot of excess is to select what you want to keep and
then click the Trim button. This keeps your selection and deletes the rest.
Splitting Stereo Tracks for Surgical Repairs
Sometimes there will be a defect on just one channel of a two-channel stereo
track. If you split this into two tracks, then you can apply repairs to just the
one channel and rejoin the tracks. There are a couple of advantages to this:
The second track helps to mask a less-than-perfect ﬁx, and the ﬁx that you
apply to the defective portion probably won’t help the other channel sound
any better and may even hurt the quality.
90
Chapter 4

Figure 4-13: Using View > Fit in Window to do rough cuts with the entire track dis-
played
To divide a stereo track, go to the Track menu and click Split Stereo
Track. To rejoin the tracks, use the Track menu in the track that is on top
and click Make Stereo Track. The two tracks must be adjacent to each other.
Fixing Clipping and Too-Loud Passages
Hunt down any clipping and too-loud passages and ﬁx them. These throw
off the volume levels for the whole track and shock listeners, so it’s always a
good idea to ﬁx them.
Find any clipping quickly by selecting View > Show Clipping. This marks
any clipped passages with red bars. Zoom in on the clipped segments until
you can precisely select the parts that are too loud and then use a negative
value, such as −3 dB, in Effect > Amplify to lower the volume. Rerecording
clipped segments is better, but since you probably won’t have that oppor-
tunity with a live show, making them less noticeable is the next best thing.
Click the Preview button to see whether it sounds right, and if it doesn’t,
change the Ampliﬁcation value until it does. Then click OK to make it per-
manent.
NOTE
Adjust the length of previews in Edit > Preferences > Playback. The default is three
seconds.
Creating and Editing Live Tracks for CD
91

Look for any extreme peaks that are not clipped, which could be a
drum beat, sudden audience noise, something dropped, a bump of the
mic—whatever it is, check it out and decide whether it needs to be toned
down.
If any clipped or too-loud passage is so obnoxious you want to remove
it entirely, select it and select Edit > Silence (or CTRL-L) to make it totally
silent. You might not want to delete it because that shortens the track, which
would be a problem on a multitrack project. If it is so long that silencing
it would be too noticeable, try patching the annoying part with a clip from
somewhere else. To do this, ﬁrst delete the offending bit with Edit > Split
Cut. This leaves a gap in place of the deleted portion. Then carefully paste
into the gap a segment of the same length copied from another part of the
track, or even from a different track; you can use anything as long as it sounds
all right. This can be ﬁnicky work, so remember to zoom in so you can see
what you’re doing. The Envelope tool is good for smoothing transitions with
careful fades, or try the Draw tool to apply some careful interpolation.
Noise Removal
Audacity’s Noise Removal tool is pretty good, though it can take a few tries
to get it right because noise removal is always a compromise with its side
effects—removing noise also affects the sounds you want to keep. If the
sounds that you want to keep have similar volume and frequencies as the
noise, you might not get very good results. Noise removal works best when
the noise is distinctly different from what you want to keep.
First you need to create a proﬁle of the unwanted noise. This is why you
recorded various audience and background noise samples at the live show,
so you would have good samples to create a proﬁle from. Create a noise
proﬁle by selecting a 5- to 30-second segment of noise, then go to Effect >
Noise Removal and click Get Noise Proﬁle. (If your samples are not long
enough, double them up by copying and pasting them into the same track.)
Then select the part of the track you want to remove the noise from, go
back to Effect > Noise Removal, and click the Preview button to hear how
it sounds (Figure 4-14).
The Noise Removal effect has three adjustable settings: Noise reduction,
Frequency smoothing, and Attack/decay time. Noise reduction controls how
much the volume of the noise is reduced, so a value of −10 turns it down by
10 decibels, and −50 will nuke it into silence. For both Frequency smooth-
ing and Attack/decay time, moving the slider to the left is more aggressive,
and moving it to the right makes gentler changes. A larger value for Fre-
quency smoothing means it changes a wider range of frequencies. Remem-
ber: Attack refers to how hard a note is hit, and decay is how long it takes
to fade away. Smaller values are more abrupt, and larger values are more
gradual.
When the Preview sounds good, click OK. If you don’t like it after press-
ing OK, press CTRL-Z to undo, or use Edit > Undo, to try again.

Chapter 4

Figure 4-14: Using the Noise Removal effect to
tone down unwanted background noises
You can build your noise proﬁle with noise samples from the Freesound
Project (http://www.freesound.org/). This is a collaborative database of Cre-
ative Commons—licensed sounds. You can ﬁnd just about anything here,
including samples of white, pink, and brown noise; buzz from a bad TRS
plug connection; pool hall noise; and lots more. You can contribute your
own samples to the project, too.
Compressing Dynamic Range
Using dynamic range compression wisely is an important skill in audio edit-
ing. For example, in podcasts that have more than one person talking, it’s a
kindness to your listeners to make sure that the volume levels of the various
people speaking are all the same. Compression is also used to change the
character of sounds. For example, drums are mostly rapid peak sounds, so a
bit of compression is used to give them a fuller, richer sound. Compression
can make a vocalist or instrument “pop” out of the mix and make it sound
more vivid. Compression can also help level out an erratic performer, such
as a singer with bad mic technique or an instrumentalist who doesn’t have
good volume control but is loud and soft at the wrong times.
What you can accomplish with compression will be limited by your record-
ings. If you have multitrack recordings with every performer and instrument
on their own tracks, or usefully subgrouped, then you have all kinds of edit-
ing ﬂexibility. If your recording is two-track stereo, then you can’t edit very
surgically, but you can apply compression to the whole recording to make it
sound better in noisy environments, such as vehicles and workplaces. Con-
trolling it yourself means you can measure out just the right amount.
There are several places in the audio chain where compression can be
applied. Was a compressor used during recording? If it was, be careful about
applying any more because that can make your track sound fake or weird.

I’m conservative when it comes to using compression. If something
needs to be louder or quieter, I prefer to adjust it with the Envelope tool or
Amplify effect. In the olden days of tape, compression techniques like Dolby
noise reduction were used to minimize tape hiss. Music was compressed in
the recording and then expanded on playback to lower the noise ﬂoor. Digi-
tal audio has such a high signal-to-noise ratio, this isn’t necessary.
Now let’s learn how to use Audacity’s Compressor effect (Figure 4-15).
Figure 4-15: Audacity’s Compressor effect for applying
dynamic range compression
Select what you want to apply compression to, part of a track or a whole
track, and then click Effect > Compressor to open the Compressor effect.
You can make the Compressor window larger and expand the decibel scales
by dragging the corners.
The Threshold setting determines the starting point, in decibels, where
the gain of the audio signal is reduced. A threshold of −60 dB means every-
thing with an amplitude of −60 dB and above will have reduced gain, which
in most cases is too much, since that will be everything. A threshold of −10
dB means the loudest 10 dB of your track will have its gain reduced.
The Noise Floor setting prevents background noise from being ampli-
ﬁed during pauses by keeping the gain constant until the signal comes back
up to the Threshold level; it does not allow the gain to increase in quiet pas-
sages that are below the Noise Floor decibel setting. If there are no quiet
pauses in your audio, then this setting won’t help much, and you should
move the slider all the way to the left, −80 dB, to make it have no effect.
The Ratio setting controls how much compression, or reduction in
gain, will be applied to sounds that are higher than your Threshold setting.
A higher ratio, such as 4:1, means more compression. An input signal of
4 dB higher than your threshold will be reduced to 1 dB higher than the
94
Chapter 4

threshold, so it applies a 3 dB reduction. Try gentler ratios ﬁrst, starting at
2:1, and then listen to the preview. If it’s not enough, try a higher ratio. Au-
dacity’s compressor has a maximum ratio of 10:1, which is a lot. Other com-
pressors go as high as 60:1.
Attack Time determines how quickly compression is applied, and De-
cay Time determines how long it takes to phase out the compression. A too-
short Attack Time might result in some audible distortion, and a too-long
Decay Time might miss some short peaks. The Preview button helps you try
different settings quickly.
Compression makes your audio quieter, so you may need to amplify
or normalize it after applying compression. The Compressor effect has a
“Make-up gain for 0 dB after compressing” checkbox, which is another way
of saying apply normalization to 0 dB. I don’t use it because I prefer to con-
trol normalization separately, and I don’t always normalize to 0 dB, but it’s
there if you want to save a step.
There is also a “Compress based on Peaks” checkbox. When this box is
unchecked, which is the default, the compressor reduces the gain on sounds
above the Threshold level using RMS values. “Compress based on Peaks”
raises the gain on quieter sounds that are above the Threshold level.
Be careful with compression because it is easy to overdo it. In much of
modern popular music, there is virtually no dynamic range; it’s all rammed
into the same narrow 5 dB or even smaller range with no quiet passages, no
contrast, and just one big shouting blob all boosted to the maximum, some-
times even into distortion. Any emotional impact and artistry are destroyed.
You’re trying to make it more comfortable for different listening environ-
ments or improve how a vocalist or instrument sound, not kill the recording
entirely.
Visit “Compress Dynamic Range” on page 240 to learn more about dy-
namic range compression and how to use the excellent Chris’s Dynamic
Compressor.
Cutting a Single Long Track into Individual Song Tracks
Do this when you have a single stereo track in your Audacity project and
have already done all of your other cleanups and ﬁxes. A single stereo track
in an Audacity project can contain a number of songs, but to Audacity it’s
all one long, unbroken track; it doesn’t know where the song breaks are, so
you have to make them yourself. There are two different approaches you
can take. One is the usual collection of separate songs with a few seconds of
silence dividing them. Another is marking the song breaks so you can skip
around, but with no breaks between them, like a live concert album.
Whichever you prefer, just do as shown in Figure 4-16: Figure out where
you want each song break; then press CTRL-B to mark the spot and create
a label. This is where you type in the name of the song. Labels go at the be-
ginning of the songs, so when you start, ﬁrst press the Home key on your
keyboard to make sure you’re at the very beginning.

Figure 4-16: Creating song titles and breaking up a long track into individual
songs with a label track
If you need to move a label, grab it by its moving handle, which is the
little round dot (Figure 4-17).
The angle handles are for extending labels to mark sections of your
track. These are called region labels (Figure 4-18). Learn all about labels and
label tracks in “Creating and Managing Labels” on page 173.
Figure 4-17: The little

Figure 4-18: Drag

In Audacity versions 1.3.9 and newer, beware the Link Tracks button.
This keeps audio and label tracks synchronized and can get in the way by
forcing tracks to be aligned when you don’t want them to be. Turn off Link
Tracks if it gets in your way, though this is less likely to be a problem for a
single stereo track. Link Tracks probably won’t appear in the ﬁrst 2.x Audac-
ity release but may appear later when the kinks are worked out. Learn more
about Link Tracks in “Link Tracks and Track Groups” on page 176.
Creating Graceful Breaks Between Songs
Figure 4-19: Using the Envelope tool
to create fade-ins and fade-outs
Creating silence between songs, with
graceful fades in and out, is easy in Au-
dacity. There are several tools to choose
from. First, let’s try the Envelope tool.
Figure 4-19 shows it in action, creating
about a 2.5-second fade-out to silence
and then fading back in. The little, white
squares are the node control points. Create
these by clicking the track, and then you
can move them to make adjustments.
Each node has four control points—one
inner pair and one outer pair. Control
96
Chapter 4

points move both horizontally and vertically. To get rid of a node, grab a
control point and drag it outside the track’s boundary.
Envelope tools are standard in most audio-editing applications. It takes
a bit of practice to get the hang of them, but once you ﬁgure them out, you
gain a high degree of control over fades and amplitude.
You may also try selecting Effect > Fade Out and Effect > Fade In,
which is fast and easy. All you control is the length of the fade. First select
the segment that you want to fade and then apply the effect. Figure 4-20
shows how to create a nice 10-second fade-out.
Figure 4-20: First make a selection 10 seconds long and
then apply Effect > Fade Out.
Suppose you want two seconds of silence between songs, but there isn’t
that much space between them—no problem, you can insert as much silence
as you want by selecting Generate > Silence. Use the Selection tool to mark
where you want the silence to begin, select Generate > Silence, set it to two
seconds, and click OK.
NOTE
Beware of CD-writing applications that automatically insert two-second breaks between
songs. This should be a conﬁgurable behavior.
Normalization
One of the last steps to perform is to apply normalization to raise the volume
level of your track. Select the whole track, and then select Effect > Normal-
ize. Check both “Remove any CD offset” and “Normalize maximum ampli-
tude to.” The highest value you can use for the maximum amplitude is zero,
which is a good value to use for a two-channel stereo track.
Optional Track Metadata
You have the option to write track metadata using the File > Open Metadata
Editor dialog. Before export, ﬁll in information common to all the tracks:
artist name, album title, genre, date, and comments. Audacity will automat-
ically ﬁll in the track names from the labels or track names and number
Creating and Editing Live Tracks for CD
97

each track automatically. You can see a preview for each track at export if
you open the Edit > Preferences > Import/Export dialog and check “Show
Metadata Editor prior to export step.” Uncheck this to skip the per-track
preview.
WAV format does not support CD text or metadata. (Other audio ﬁle
formats do, such as Ogg, FLAC, and MP3.) This is not the same as CD text.
CD text is a nonstandard extension to the Red Book CD Audio format that
displays song titles on CD players that support it. Most software CD play-
ers support CD text, and so do newer home and car CD players. Most CD-
writing software supports CD text, so you can enter the individual song titles
when you are authoring the CD. Some CD-writing programs (such as Nero,
which runs on both Linux and Windows) extract song titles from the ﬁle-
names, which is a lovely time-saver.
The metadata are always preserved in your Audacity projects.
Final Export
This has been a great journey, from recording to editing, and now you are
two steps away from creating CDs of your great recordings. The second-to-
last step is to export your recordings to the correct format for CDs, which is
16/44.1 two-channel WAV. This is also the step where your tracks are bro-
ken up into individual song ﬁles. (If your project has more than two tracks,
please see “Editing and Downmixing Multitrack Recordings” on page 88.)
If you have not already set the sampling rate for your project to 44.1,
do so now. Change the Project Rate setting to 44,100 Hz on the Selection
toolbar. Then select Tracks > Resample, set the rate to 44,100, and click
OK. This will take a few minutes on long tracks.
Now click File > Export Multiple. Enter the directory you want to save
your audio ﬁles in and select both “Split ﬁles based on: Labels” and “Name
ﬁles: Using Track/Label Name.”
Click the Options button to set the correct export format. Choose Header:
WAV (Microsoft) and Encoding: Signed 16 bit PCM (Figure 4-21).
Figure 4-21: The correct export format
settings for CDs
Your track will be exported as a bunch of individual WAV ﬁles, one per
label.

Chapter 4

Writing Your Songs to CD
Now you have a batch of nice individual WAV ﬁles, one ﬁle per song. Use
your favorite CD-burning program to put your tunes on a CD. Be sure to cre-
ate an audio project and not a data project, because CDs must be in the Red
Book Audio format to play in all CD players. Set your burn speed to half the
maximum as coaster insurance. Some CD-writing programs, like Nero, auto-
matically grab the song titles from your WAV ﬁlenames, which is a nice time-
saver. Most CD-writing programs create a default two-second gap between
songs, so watch out for this. You can make a live album that sounds like one
long, unbroken track by eliminating these gaps and still have individual song
tracks so you can skip around.
Labeling Your CD
Don’t use sticky paper labels on your CDs, because these degrade the disc
over time. There are better ways to create nice-looking labels. You can get
special CD blanks that are made to be printed on by inkjet printers that sup-
port printing on CDs. These are different from ordinary printers by having a
special tray to hold the disc.
Another type of printable CD requires a special thermal printer. These
are not expensive, usually around $100.
A third type is the LightScribe CD, which requires a special CD writer
and CD blanks. These cost about the same as ordinary CD/DVD writers,
around $50.
There are many software programs for designing your CD labels and
making them look nice and professional.
Mass CD Duplication
You might want to make CDs to distribute, and you can do this without spend-
ing huge amounts of money. There are many laser CD duplicators that are
like your computer’s CD burner, only faster and with multiple trays. These
range from about $400 for simple duplicators with manual feeds to several
thousand dollars for automatic feeds and local data storage.
There are also commercial duplication services with varying levels of ser-
vice, such as cover art and design. These can be cost-effective and save you
time and hassle. The best CDs are pressed rather than burned. A duplica-
tion service that uses a press rather than a laser duplicator costs more and
usually requires larger runs. But your discs will last longer.
“Do I need to buy a special audio CD?” is a common question. No, you
do not. All CDs are exactly the same type, but it is worth sticking with good
brands like Taiyo Yuden (my favorite). Verbatim, Ridata, and MAM-A are
also reliable brands. Always get CD-R; don’t bother with CD-RW except for
experimentation. See “There Is Not a Special Audio CD” on page 102 for
more information.

AUTHORING A COMPILATION CD
You can make custom-mix CDs just like
we used to make custom-mix tapes back
in the olden days. There are many reasons
for making your own custom-mix discs: to make
your own song collections, to make your own greatest
hits samplers, to combine your best live performances,
to make party discs, to make a promotional CD of your
own music, to weed out songs you don’t care for, to
condense several CDs or LPs into fewer discs . . . what-
ever your reasons, it’s easy to do with Audacity.
This newfangled digital era is the best: You can make copies that are
perfect clones of the originals, and it’s faster and easier to edit ﬁles on a
computer than on tape. Creating your own custom CD goes like this: Col-
lect the audio tracks you want to use in Audacity, apply cleanups and edits,
write your track metadata, export to your desired format, write to a CD, and
you’re done.

Audio CDs
There are two types of audio CDs that you can make, and which type you
choose is determined by your playback devices. The standard CD that plays
on all CD players is encoded according to the Red Book CD Audio standard.
This is what commercially recorded CDs use, and this is what you want to use
to make a universally playable disc. That is no big technical deal, because
all you do is choose “Create an audio CD” in your CD-writing program. You
must always create 16/44.1 WAV ﬁles for Red Book CDs.
The second type of CD you can make is written to the Orange Book
standard to play on a computer. Again, this is no big technological deal;
it’s just an ordinary data CD, and in your CD-writing program you’ll choose
“Create a data CD.” On this type of disc you may use any audio ﬁle format
you want, such as FLAC or 24-bit WAV for higher quality or lossy, compressed
formats like Ogg Vorbis or MP3 to cram more songs onto a disc. You are lim-
ited only by your choice of software media player, and these days it’s a rare
software media player that doesn’t support everything under the sun.
You should verify CD-R and CD-RW support in your CD player. CD-RWs
are great for creating temporary collections for parties and special events,
but some CD players don’t handle them very well. Some don’t even handle
CD-Rs well, but that is pretty rare anymore. Some newer CD/DVD players
support non–Red Book formats such as MP3, WAV, and WMA.
NOTE
Alvin, our excellent technical reviewer, explains why older CD players have problems
reading newer discs. “The older azide-based discs had a very large difference in re-
ﬂectance, and the sensitivity of the player was set to this large difference. With CD-RW
and the pthalocyanine (silver)–based discs, the difference in reﬂectivity of the 0 and 1
(burned vs. unburned) disc is much smaller.”
There Is Not a Special Audio CD
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: All blank CDs are exactly the same
type; there is no such thing as a special audio CD, even though you see them
in stores. The only special things about them are a pressed data ﬂag that
is part of the Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) to control copying
protected material and a copying tax that goes to the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) or its equivalent in other countries. The
SCMS encoding controls three states: copy allowed (00), copy once (11),
and copy prohibited (10). It might get in the way if you try to use the kind of
CD player that attaches to your stereo system to copy a copy of a commercial
CD. But you can copy the original all you want, and computer hardware and
media are exempt from being SCSM-compliant.
There are quality differences among brands, and different materials are
used to make the discs. Taiyo Yuden makes its own discs; they are very good
and promise the most longevity. Mitsui, Phillips, Kodak, Verbatim, and TDK
are all reliable as well. The price difference between the good brands and
the not-so-good brands isn’t signiﬁcant. There is no point in pinching pen-
nies because you’ll just create more coasters with the lesser-quality brands,

Convert MP3s to Red Book CD
A commonly asked question is “How do I copy my MP3s to a CD that will
play on every CD player?” They must be converted to 16/44.1 WAV ﬁles
and then Red Book–encoded. To do this, use Audacity to convert MP3s to
16/44.1 WAV format, and then in your CD-writing program select “Create
an audio CD.” It won’t give you WAV quality; it will still be lo-ﬁ, lossy MP3
quality. You won’t get more than 80 minutes of music on your disc even with
the smaller ﬁle sizes. But you’ll have a standard CD that will play anywhere.
CD Writers and Software
These days, most consumer-level CD/DVD burners are pretty good and not
very expensive, about $40 to $90. External USB burners are portable, and
some are bus powered so you don’t need a power cord.
CD-writing software is everywhere. For basic CD writing, you shouldn’t
have to pay money because there are dozens of freebies. There is built-in
CD/DVD-writing software in Windows, though it’s pretty limited. Nero and
Roxio are decent and offer inexpensive editions. For more advanced tasks,
Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect (Windows only) is a decent value in a
CD-mastering program at less than $100, with professional features such as
cross-fades, cue sheets, indexing long live tracks, previews, dithering, resam-
pling, karaoke, and DJ mixes.
Linux users have three good graphical open source applications to choose
from: Brasero, Gnome CD Master, and K3b. All are graphical frontends to
powerful command-line apps such as wodim, cdrdao, and various encoders
and converters. They, of course, can be used on their own without the pretty
graphical interfaces.
Gapless burning is a common problem in do-it-yourself audio circles.
This means creating a CD that plays one long, unbroken track, like a live
show, with no breaks between songs. This can be put together from multi-
ple audio ﬁles or from a single long WAV ﬁle. You need a CD burner that
supports gapless burning, which now should be all CD/DVD burners. Look
for session-at-once (SAO) and disc-at-once (DAO) support. Track-at-once
(TAO) means the laser pauses at the end of each track. SAO burns your
whole session in one pass with no pauses and leaves the CD open so you can
add more tracks, while DAO closes the disc. Use SAO or DAO for gapless
burning of audio CDs.
An extra challenge for CD-authoring software is creating a track index
for a long, unbroken performance. Create a long WAV track in Audacity,
and then create CD text and a track index in your CD-writing program so
you can navigate the disc just like on a CD with multiple song tracks. (You
can’t create this in Audacity.) You should end up with two ﬁles: a .bin ﬁle,
which contains your audio, and a .cue or .toc ﬁle, which contains the disc

index. Some CD-authoring applications use their own weird nonstandard
cue sheet formats; beware of these, because other CD-writing programs
won’t be able to use them, and they might confuse playback devices.
Roxio, CDRWin, Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect, and higher-end
suites by Steinberg and Minnetonka are some programs that can do this for
Windows users. Brasero and Gnome CD Master do the best job for Linux
users. K3b can index long tracks, but its interface for doing this is rather
cumbersome.
Three Ways to Author a CD Compilation in Audacity
There are several ways to create a CD compilation in Audacity. One way is
to copy each song into a single Audacity project, each on its own separate
track. Edit and apply ﬁxes to each track individually, and then normalization
across all tracks is a single step. Give each track its own name, and there are
your song titles. This is a good method for creating a typical audio CD with
multiple song tracks and a short, silent gap between each one.
Another way is to copy all of your songs into a single stereo Audacity
track, apply ﬁxes and edits, and then create a label track to divide them into
individual songs. You can use this to create a CD that appears to be a single
long, unbroken track by creating nice smooth transitions between each song
and then making sure there are no gaps between the songs when you burn
your CD.
With the ﬁrst two methods, your ﬁnal result is a batch of WAV ﬁles, one
ﬁle per song.
A third method is to copy all of your songs into a single stereo Audac-
ity track and apply edits and ﬁxes. Export it as a single 16/44.1 WAV ﬁle,
and then use your CD-writing program to create song titles and divide it into
individual song tracks with two-second gaps, or index the track so that it re-
mains unbroken but still navigable.
Each method has its advantages, so let’s look at each one in detail.
One Track per Song Project
I like this method for creating CDs with multiple song tracks and a standard
two-second silent gap between each one. You can normalize all tracks at
once and edit each one individually without worrying about inadvertently
changing something else. When each song in your project is on its own
track, it looks like Figure 5-1.
Your ﬁrst step is to create a new Audacity project by selecting File > Save
Project As. Next, conﬁgure Audacity with the following settings for creating
CD-ready WAV ﬁles.
Set the frame rate to CD audio in the Selection toolbar, as shown in
Figure 5-2. This ensures that any splits you make will start and end on a CD
frame. Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and possi-
bly create clicking noises. You can choose either hh:mm:ss + CDDA frames
(75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time plus CD
104

the Selection toolbar
frames, and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To” box to
ensure that stops and starts are always on the CD frame boundaries. Set the
Project Rate value to 44,100 Hz.
Now open the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog and make sure
that “Overdub: Play other tracks while recording new one” and “Software
Playthrough: Listen while recording or monitoring new track” are not
checked.
In the Edit > Preferences > Devices dialog, set Channels to 2 (Stereo).
Now add some audio ﬁles to your project. To add audio ﬁles in WAV,
FLAC, or some other format, select File > Import > Audio. If you want to
copy tracks or clips from another Audacity project, open the other project in
a new window and copy and paste.
Name each track with the song name in the Track menu. (At export,
each track will be exported into individual WAV ﬁles that use the track names
as ﬁlenames.)
Next, apply edits and repairs. (See “Fixes and Cleanups” on page 111.) I
like to put one second of silence at the beginning and end of each track and
normalize all of them to 0 dB. Then as I build my CD-ready WAV collection,
they’re all ready to go and don’t need any more processing in Audacity.
Authoring a Compilation CD
105

Make sure that your Project Rate setting is still 44,100 Hz. If the ﬁrst
track you opened or imported was at a different sampling rate, then that
would have become the project rate. It doesn’t matter if you have mixed
sampling rates, because everything will be resampled to the project rate at
export.
An optional step at this point is to enter some metadata by opening
File > Open Metadata Editor. You can enter information such as the album
title, year, genre, and comments. This is saved only in your Audacity project
because WAV ﬁles do not support metadata. (Other audio ﬁle formats do,
such as FLAC, MP3, and Ogg Theora.) Audacity will automatically ﬁll in
each track title from your track names, the track number, and everything
you entered in the Metadata Editor.
If you want to review the metadata for each song as it is exported, open
Edit > Preferences > Import/Export and check “Show Metadata Editor
prior to export step.”
Now you are ready to export your tracks for CD recording. Flip back
to “Final Export” on page 98 if you need a refresher on exporting multiple
tracks. Be sure to click the Options button to set the correct export format.
Click OK and then Export. You will see a conﬁrmation for each song
and a summary when it is ﬁnished as in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: A successful multiple export
Now you have a batch of CD-ready WAV ﬁles. Use your favorite CD-
writing program to create an audio CD and be sure to create an audio
project, not a data project. Most CD software supports CD text and adjust-
ing the gaps between the songs. Beware of default two-second gap settings,
which will add to any gaps you created in Audacity.
Single Audacity Track Compilation Project
For this method, your Audacity screen will look something like Figure 5-4
when you are ﬁnished editing and ready to export. Why do it this way? I
think it’s easier to control fades and transitions between songs, and I like
having everything in a single track. This is my favorite way to create live CDs
with no breaks between songs.
106
Chapter 5

Figure 5-4: This compilation includes songs from various sources, all knit into a single
Audacity track.
Your ﬁrst step, as always, is to create a new Audacity project with File
> Save Project As. Next, conﬁgure Audacity with the following settings for
creating CD-ready WAV ﬁles, just as you did in the previous section.
Set the frame rate to CD audio in the Selection toolbar, as shown in Fig-
ure 5-2. This ensures that any splits you make will start and end on a CD
frame. Any audio that lands outside of these frames will be lost and possi-
bly create clicking noises. You can choose either hh:mm:ss + CDDA frames
(75 fps) or CDDA frames (75 fps). The former shows the time plus CD frames,
and the latter displays only CD frames. Check the “Snap To” box to ensure
that stops and starts are always on the CD frame boundaries. Set the project
rate to 44,100 Hz.
Now open the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog and make sure
that “Overdub: Play other tracks while recording new one” and “Software
Playthrough: Listen while recording or monitoring new track” are not
checked.
In the Edit > Preferences > Devices dialog, set Channels to 2 (Stereo).
Now you can put some audio tracks in your project. If you want to copy
some tracks from another Audacity project, open this in a separate Audacity
window with File > Open or File > Recent Files, and copy and paste. To add
audio ﬁles such as WAV, FLAC, Ogg Theora, and so forth, select File > Im-
port > Audio. Each new import will open in its own track, so you will have to
cut and paste it into your compilation track and then delete the extra track.
When you have all the songs you want, apply edits and repairs (see “Fixes
and Cleanups” on page 111). If your songs vary in volume and you want them
all the same, you’ll have to adjust each one individually using Effect > Am-
plify. Select each song one at a time, and then bring them up to your de-
sired peak amplitude, no more than zero.
Authoring a Compilation CD
107

Now create a label track. This is how each song gets a title and how this
one long track will be split into a bunch of separate song ﬁles. Start by press-
ing the HOME key to make sure you are at the very beginning, and then press
CTRL-B to create the label. Type in the song title and press the RETURN key.
Click at the beginning of the second song, make another label, and keep
going until you’re ﬁnished labeling all the songs (Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5: Creating a label track
Make sure your project rate in the Selection toolbar is still 44,100. Any
clips that have a different sample rate will be resampled to the project rate at
export.
If you’d like, you can enter some metadata, but remember that the in-
formation is saved only in your Audacity project—WAV ﬁles do not support
metadata. To export your project for CD recording, see “Final Export” on
page 98. When you are ﬁnished, you will see a conﬁrmation for each song
and a summary as in Figure 5-3.
Single Audacity Track + CD-Mastering Program
This third method requires a good CD-authoring program that supports CD
text, track splitting, and control of the spacing between tracks. The idea
is to create a single long Audacity track with all of your songs and do your
cleanups and ﬁxes in Audacity. Then export it as a single 16/44.1 WAV ﬁle
and use your CD-writing program to create song titles, to divide the track
into individual songs and adjust the gaps between songs, or to create an in-
dex without breaking up the track.
There are many CD-authoring applications that can do this, such as
Roxio, CDRWin, Sony’s Creative Software CD Architect, and higher-end
suites by Steinberg and Minnetonka for Windows users. Brasero and Gnome
CD Master are best for Linux users.
Let’s use Brasero to illustrate how to do this, because it has the sim-
plest interface. First, create your new audio project and load your audio
ﬁle. Then right-click your ﬁle and click Split File. This opens Brasero’s Split
Track window (Figure 5-6). Select Method: Split track manually, click the
Play button to hear your track, and click Slice to mark a song break.
108
Chapter 5

Figure 5-6: Using Brasero to split a long track
Drag the Play slider back and forth to ﬁnd split points quickly, or just kick
back and listen, clicking the Slice button as the appropriate breakpoints
come along.
When you’re ﬁnished, click OK. This takes you to a window like Fig-
ure 5-7 where you can enter your track titles, and then you can either create
a disc image and cue sheet that you can use in any CD-writing application or
go ahead and burn to disc.
Figure 5-7: Entering song titles and getting ready to burn to disc, or creating a
.bin image and .cue ﬁle that can be used by any CD-writing program
Authoring a Compilation CD
109

This example creates a long track with no breaks between songs. What
if you want song breaks? No worries: Just right-click any track to insert a two-
second pause (Figure 5-8).
Figure 5-8: Using Brasero to insert breaks between
songs
If your long track is a compilation of songs with the usual silent breaks
between each song, try selecting Method: Split track for each silence. Then
it will split it automatically.
Of course, the other CD-authoring applications do things their own way,
but this should give you an idea of the basic steps.
CD Cue Sheets and BIN Files
Cue sheets are used in conjunction with .bin image ﬁles, which contain your
audio, that any CD-writing software can use to burn a new CD. The cue sheet
contains the table of contents for the disc, like this one created by Brasero:
FILE "/home/alrac/winding-road-1.bin" MOTOROLA
TITLE "Audio disc (26 June 10)"
TRACK 01 AUDIO
TITLE "Guitar Summit"
PERFORMER "Winding Road"
INDEX 01 00:00:00
TRACK 02 AUDIO
TITLE "Gone Away Again"
PERFORMER "Winding Road"
INDEX 01 02:50:24
TRACK 03 AUDIO

PERFORMER "Winding Road"
INDEX 01 06:45:63
TRACK 04 AUDIO
TITLE "Montana Two-Step"
PERFORMER "Winding Road"
INDEX 01 14:30:72
Cue sheets are used on both CDs and DVDs. If you’re into ripping com-
mercial CDs and DVDs, you probably already know about cue sheets, be-
cause some ripping software can create them from the table of contents
(TOC) on the CD. You can create and edit these yourself, though I’m lazy
110
Chapter 5

and prefer to have some nice CD-authoring software do it for me. Here are
the most commonly used ﬁelds, including some not used in the Brasero
example:
PERFORMER
The artist or group
FILE
The name of the corresponding disc image ﬁle, with the ﬁle
type. MOTOROLA is a type of binary ﬁle. Other options are BINARY,
WAVE, AIFF, and MP3.
TITLE
The disc title
TRACK
The track number and data mode, which is AUDIO
TITLE
The track title
INDEX
The number 01 marks the start of the track. The time values
are minutes, seconds, and CD frames. (Remember, in Audacity we always
set the time parameter to CDDA Frames in the Selection toolbar.) An
INDEX value of 00 creates a hidden track, which is a gimmick you’ve
probably experienced on some of your own CDs.
PREGAP
How many seconds of silence to insert before a track starts;
for example, 00:02:00 is two seconds.
POSTGAP
How many seconds of silence to insert after a track ends.
You don’t have to use cue sheets. You don’t even have to know any-
thing about them. They’re just another optional item in your CD- and DVD-
authoring toolkit to help you control what goes on your discs. There are
all kinds of free how-tos all over the Internet if you’re interested in learn-
ing more.
Fixes and Cleanups
Chapter 4 included a bunch of information on cleaning up live tracks, and
a lot of that applies to cleaning up compilation CDs too. We’ll review the
basics here along with explanations of a few other ﬁxes that may come up
when you make your compilation discs. We’ll talk about splitting stereo
tracks for more precise editing, normalization, adjusting the gaps between
songs, and graceful fades. See Chapter 12 to learn more about ﬁx-its and
cleanups such as noise removal; dynamic range compression; and ﬁxing
clicks, pops, clipping, and other defects. Chapter 11 is all about applying
special effects.
Splitting Stereo Tracks for Surgical Repairs
Sometimes there will be a defect on just one channel of a two-channel stereo
track. If you split this into two tracks, then you can apply repairs to just the
one channel and then join the tracks back together. There are a couple of
advantages to this: The second track helps to mask a less-than-perfect ﬁx,
and the ﬁx that you apply to the defective portion probably won’t help the
other channel sound any better and may even hurt the quality.
Authoring a Compilation CD
111

To divide a stereo track, go to the Track menu and click Split Stereo
Track. To rejoin the tracks, use the Track menu in the track that is on top
and click Make Stereo Track. The two tracks must be adjacent to each other.
Normalization
Normalization, or raising all your different songs to the same volume levels, is
a common audio-editing task that can be done in CD-writing software. But
again, in Audacity you have a lot more control.
Before normalizing, you should review your tracks for any unusual peaks
that could indicate some kind of defect, such as a bumped mic, a cough,
something dropped, or anything that is so loud it doesn’t sound right. Nor-
malization doesn’t change the dynamic range, so one too-loud peak means
normalization won’t have much effect, and you could end up with a track
that is too quiet overall. To lower the volume on any too-loud peak, zoom
in until you can select it precisely, and then open Effect > Amplify. Enter
a negative value, like −3 dB, to lower the volume. You can use the Preview
button to help adjust it. When it sounds right, click OK, and move on to the
next one.
If you put your whole project into a single Audacity track, you’ll have
to select each song carefully and raise it to your desired maximum volume
level. You should do this before creating any fades. Another way to handle
this is to use the Envelope tool so you can ﬁx it all with one tool.
When every song is on its own individual track, it’s easier—select all
tracks (CTRL-A or Edit > Select All), and then click Effect > Normalize.
Check both “Remove any CD offset” and “Normalize maximum amplitude
to,” and enter your maximum volume level up to 0 dB.
Making Graceful Fades and Song Breaks
Creating breaks between songs, with graceful fades in and out, is easy in
Audacity. Many CD-writing programs can do this too, but you have more
control in Audacity. There are three Audacity tools that I like to use: the
Fade In/Fade Out effects, the Envelope tool, and the Silence generator.
The Fade In/Fade Out effect is fast and simple; all you control is the
length of the fade. First, select the segment that you want to fade, and then
select Effect > Fade Out or Effect > Fade In.
If you need to insert an interval of pure silence, use the Selection tool to
mark where you want the silence to begin, click Generate > Silence, set it to
whatever duration you want, and click OK.
The Envelope tool gives you more control of both the duration and the
degree of fades. Figure 5-9 shows it in action, creating about a 2.5-second
fade-out to silence and then fading back in. The little squares are the node
control points. Create these by clicking the track, and then you can move
them both horizontally and vertically. To get rid of a node, grab a control
point and drag it outside the track’s boundary. Envelope tools are standard
in most audio-editing applications. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang
112
Chapter 5

of them, but once you ﬁgure out how to make them go where you want, you
gain a high degree of control over fades and amplitude.
What about cross-fades, you ask? A cross-fade is when one track fades
out and another fades in at the same time, with some overlap and no break.
Cross-fades are used all the time in soundtracks and music. Some Audacity
plug-ins for creating cross-fades are included in the standard add-on plug-
in packages, but they’re pretty limited. I think it’s easier and better to use
the Envelope tool. Someday Audacity will have a good cross-fade tool. Mean-
while, Figure 5-10 shows my preferred method.
Figure 5-9: Using the Envelope tool
and the Time Shift tool to create fade-
ins and fade-outs
Figure 5-10: Creating
a cross-fade with the
Envelope tool
This shows two Audacity stereo tracks. Let’s call the one on top Song1
and the one on the bottom Song2. Use the Time Shift tool to position Song2
for the desired length of overlap; then use the Envelope tool on each track
to set the length and degree of fade. When it’s just the way you want, you’ll
have to mix down the two tracks into a single stereo track. If you want to
create a lot of cross-fades in a project, use two separate Audacity tracks as
in Figure 5-11. Then you’ll have to mixdown only once.
Figure 5-11: Creating cross-fades between every song by using the
Time Shift tool and the Envelope tool
Click Tracks > Mix and Render to mix your tracks down to a single new
stereo track in your Audacity project, replacing your original tracks. You can
then make further adjustments before export such as creating labels, mak-
ing ﬁxes, and performing other edits. It will sound just like the playback in
Authoring a Compilation CD
113

Audacity sounds, so when it sounds right in Audacity, it’s ready to go. Chan-
nel assignments are controlled in the Track menus: Left, Right, and Mono.
Left is channel 1, Right is channel 2, and Mono tracks are mixed down to
both. (Remember to use CTRL-SHIFT-M if you want Audacity to create a new
stereo track without replacing your original tracks.)
Keep in mind that combining tracks makes them louder, so click View
> Show Clipping to quickly ﬁnd any clipped passages. If the mixdown cre-
ates clipping, undo it, use the Normalize or Amplify effects (Effect menu) to
reduce the amplitudes of your tracks, and try it again. If you go too low, you
can always raise the volume on your ﬁnal, mixed-down track using Effect >
Normalize or Amplify.
See Chapter 9 to learn more about multitrack editing and mixing.
Conﬁguring Audacity for Orange Book CDs
Orange Book CDs are ordinary data CDs without any special audio encod-
ing. These will play on any computer but not in most standalone CD players
like in your car or stereo system. You can mix up audio ﬁle formats on these
and get a lot more minutes of music on a CD.
In the Edit > Preferences > Devices dialog, select 2 channels (stereo).
In the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog, uncheck “Overdub: Play
other tracks while recording new one” and “Software Playthrough: Listen
while recording or monitoring new track.”
In the Selection toolbar, select CDDA Frames (75 fps) and check the
“Snap To” box (Figure 5-2).
Putting an Orange Book CD Collection Together
If you already have a batch of audio ﬁles all ready to copy to a CD, you don’t
need Audacity at all. Just open your CD writer and create a new data CD
project. Copy your ﬁles to the CD, enter CD text if you want, burn the disc,
and you’re done.
There are a couple of different ways to assemble an Orange Book CD
project in Audacity. Remember, your audio ﬁles are treated as ordinary data
ﬁles, so you can use any audio ﬁle format that is supported by your media
player. If the CD will contain all the same formats and quality settings, such
as all FLAC or all Ogg Vorbis or all MP3, you can follow the same steps as for
a Red Book CD, which is to create a single Audacity project containing all
of your songs. Export to your desired format and quality. Then in your CD-
writing program, select “Create a data CD” instead of creating an audio CD.
If you created track metadata, it will be displayed in CD players that support
it (except for WAV ﬁles, which do not support storing metadata).
The ﬁrst audio ﬁle you open will set the project rate. You can resample
audio ﬁles to different sampling rates, but this can hurt audio quality. Up-
sampling doesn’t add more quality, just more bits. Downsampling throws
away bits. A good tactic is not to mix up ﬁles in Audacity but rather to edit
114
Chapter 5

ﬁles that have the same sampling rate in a single Audacity project. After ex-
port, you can mix and match them all you like.
You won’t be able to apply normalization or adjust the breaks between
the tracks in your CD-writing program because it won’t see the ﬁles as au-
dio ﬁles. Apply normalization in Audacity and make sure every track is nor-
malized to the same level, like 0 dB or whatever you prefer. Adjust the gaps
between songs in Audacity in the usual way, with fades and silences.
Figure 5-12 shows what the metadata look like when you play a CD in
Amarok, which is an open source cross-platform media player. The com-
pilation includes a mix of FLAC, WAV, and MP3 ﬁles, which Amarok han-
dles with ease. Pretty much any computer media player should do the same
thing. FLAC format gives you WAV quality in one-third to one-half the ﬁle
size, and it supports metadata.
Figure 5-12: A mixed FLAC, MP3, and WAV CD compilation in Amarok
File Formats and Quality Settings
There are many different audio ﬁle formats; WAV and FLAC are great choices
for highest quality, and Ogg Vorbis and MP3 are good lossy, compressed for-
mats when you need to save space.
An Orange Book CD supports all WAV ﬁles, so you can use 16- or 24-bit
and whatever sampling rate you prefer.
Online music services such as Magnatune, Pristine Classical, and Groove-
shark offer downloads in FLAC format because it is equal in quality to WAV
in a smaller ﬁle size.
FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit depths and has nine compression
levels, from 0 to 8 (Figure 5-13). The default is 5, and that is a good one to
stick with, though nobody will mind if you experiment with the others. The
Authoring a Compilation CD
115

different settings are different levels of compression, with 0 being the least
compression and 8 the most. FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in
quality, only in how much the ﬁles are compressed. The value 8 takes sev-
eral times longer to encode than 5 with not much additional beneﬁt. De-
coding FLAC ﬁles that have been maximally compressed doesn’t take any
longer than decoding ones that have been lightly compressed, so the degree
of compression won’t affect playback.
Ogg Vorbis is also an open and unencumbered format. It has 11 qual-
ity settings in Audacity, from 0 to 10 (Figure 5-14). The value 3 is roughly
equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3, which is pretty lo-ﬁ. I think 6 is good for mu-
sic. Ogg Vorbis uses channel coupling for all levels up to 5, which means
that redundancies between two stereo channels are combined to save band-
width, so you might notice a loss of stereo imaging. Channel coupling is not
used at levels 6 and up. I don’t perceive any gain in going greater than 7,
though your ears may tell you differently.
Figure 5-13: FLACs are lossless
and a great choice for Orange
Book CDs.
Figure 5-14: Ogg Vorbis is a
good-quality lossy, compressed
audio format.
MP3 is a closed, proprietary format with patent encumbrances, though
I have not heard of small-time musicians getting sued for royalties. Nobody
will know what you use on your own personal music discs anyway.
MP3 supports both variable and constant bitrates. Constant bitrates are
best for Internet streaming. Variable bitrate MP3s are good for a Orange
Book CD because they often sound better than constant bitrate ﬁles. A con-
stant bitrate means the same ﬁxed bitrate is used throughout the ﬁle, even
if it needs more or fewer bits in certain passages. Variable bitrate operates
within a range that you select, using more or fewer bits as needed. For my
ears, a variable 170 to 210Kbps MP3 sounds as good as higher-bitrate MP3s,
and it sounds better than the lower bitrates (Figure 5-15). Naturally it is your
ears that must be happy.
Computer Media Players
Software media players will play any audio ﬁle format you throw at them.
Windows users could try Windows Media Player, Winamp, or VLC. Linux
users could start with VLC, Rhythmbox, Mplayer, Songbird, Xmms, or

Amarok. There are dozens, maybe even hundreds, of software media play-
ers, so you should be able to ﬁnd one you like.
Ripping CDs
It’s easy enough to copy and paste into an Audacity project from your own
digital audio ﬁle archives, but what about plucking songs off CDs? The audio
tracks on a CD are written using a special format, the Red Book CD Audio
standard, so you can’t just copy the songs off a CD but must use a special
digital audio extractor, or CD ripper. Some CD-writing programs include rip-
pers, such as Nero (Windows and Linux) and K3b (Linux). There are mul-
titudes of standalone CD rippers for all platforms. For example, Windows
users can try Windows Media Player, Audio Grabber, or the excellent Exact
Audio Copy. Exact Audio Copy has a bit of a learning curve, but once you
get it set up for your system, it is fast and accurate, and it handles damaged
CDs better than any of the others. Linux users have, among many others,
the excellent Grip, KAudiocreator, and VLC Media Player.
CD rippers extract tracks directly from the CD, so you don’t need a
sound card. This how you make a true, 100 percent faithful clone of the
original. You could also intercept the playback signal in various ways and
record that, such as connecting your CD player directly to a recording in-
terface using its RCA connectors, using the line or headphone port on your
stereo ampliﬁer, or even holding a microphone in front of your speakers.
But these techniques won’t produce a perfect copy; they might introduce
some ﬂaws, lose a bit of ﬁdelity, or introduce some alterations such as a dif-
ferent treble/bass curve. This is called the analog hole, which is yet another
silly ogre invented by people in the entertainment industry who seem to
have no understanding of audio technology. You don’t need to be an audio
engineer to understand that the ultimate fate of the digital bits on a CD is
to be converted into an analog signal that we can listen to and that anything
that we hear can be recorded.
Different tactics have been tried in futile attempts to “close the analog
hole,” such as introducing deliberate distortions and signal degradations
Authoring a Compilation CD

to foil copying, getting laws passed to cripple the functionality of audio and
video players, keying playback to watermarks so that only signals bearing the
correct, approved watermarks will play back at all, and putting backdoors in
devices that allow vendors to shut them down remotely or control them in
other ways. It’s a losing arms race because anything that is invented can be
circumvented, and customers are unwilling to leap tall buildings just to hear
their music.
Audio CDs are rarely copy-protected anyway, and the few attempts that
have been made were public failures. Sony BMG was rather severely em-
barrassed when it was discovered that its copy protection secretly installed
rootkits on Windows PCs, which violated laws in various countries and opened
security holes. In the United States, Sony BMG admitted that it violated fed-
eral law and had to deal with a number of civil lawsuits. This so-called copy
protection did not work on anything but Windows PCs, so Linux and Mac
users and owners of standalone CD players and mass CD duplicators were
not affected.
Rippers are useful for recovering tracks from your own CDs and from
deteriorating out-of-print commercial CDs.
NOTE
In this era of “intellectual property” protection craziness (at least in the United States),
the principle of fair use has taken a beating. I’m not going to offer legal advice because
I’m not qualiﬁed, and it would deteriorate into a rant anyway. I do want to offer a
gentle reminder that the other extreme of disregarding copyrights is just as wrong, and
no, we are not entitled to everything for free. And it doesn’t require legal genius for a
person to recognize when they’re taking unfair advantage.
Specialized CD rippers cater mainly to the MP3 crowd, so watch your ﬁle
formats. Most CD and DVD rippers support exporting to a number of dif-
ferent audio ﬁle formats, such as Ogg, WAV, FLAC, AAC, WMA, and MP3.
For best quality, always rip the native format, which for Red Book CDs is
always WAV. Once you have ripped your tracks, you can then edit them in
Audacity just like any other digital audio ﬁle and export to any other formats
you want.
Ripping DVDs
If you want to extract the audio tracks from DVDs, then you need a DVD rip-
per. Some good DVD rippers for Linux are K9copy, K3b, dvd::rip, and VLC
Media Player. HandBrake and DVDFab are good Windows rippers, and VLC
also runs on Windows. Try VLC ﬁrst; it is open source, is free of cost, and
has the most features. With VLC, you can extract and transcode your DVD
audio tracks into almost any format. Again, you’ll get best quality by ripping
to the native format and then can use Audacity to export to other formats if
you need to do so.

AUTHORING SUPER HIGH-FIDELITY
AUDIO DVDS
CD audio is a universal music medium just
like vinyl LPs were. There are multitudes of
playback devices, and audio quality is excel-
lent even on inexpensive CD players. But when
you want higher ﬁdelity or larger storage capacity than
an audio CD (how about seven CDs’ worth on a single
DVD?), what do you do?
You may feel like you are being shunned because all the attention is be-
ing given to newer and better video formats and the only audio lovers get-
ting any attention are MP3 consumers. Lossy formats and tiny portable de-
vices with lo-ﬁearbuds are getting all the glory, while audiophiles are stuck
with aging formats and technologies that haven’t advanced in years. Adding
insult to injury is the never-ending parade of ineffective, hostile DRM (which
stands for digital rights management or digital restrictions management—take
your pick) follies that are infesting new video and audio playback technolo-
gies, like termites in new houses.

Fortunately, there are some options for the golden-eared digital audio-
phile. In this chapter, we’re going to look at DVD-Audio. DVD-Audio is a
special digital audio format for DVD; it is not the same as the audio formats
used in DVD movies. You’ll sacriﬁce some portability because it is not as well
supported as CD audio, but a number of home and vehicle DVD players sup-
port it.
CD audio supports only two-channel 16/44.1 sound. DVD-Audio sup-
ports very high-resolution audio, all the way up to 24/192 and up to six-
channel surround sound. Audacity, from version 1.3.3, also supports these
features.
If you don’t want super-duper high ﬁdelity, you can store a passel of mu-
sic on a DVD. You don’t need any special hardware to create DVD-Audio
disks; you need just an ordinary computer DVD writer and blank DVD me-
dia. You do need special authoring software to create the correct type of
DVD disk image, and you have to use PCM-type audio ﬁle formats such as
FLAC, WAV, and AIFF. I like FLAC because it’s an open, high-quality loss-
less, compressed format that creates ﬁles that are 30 percent to 50 percent
smaller than WAV and AIFF.
Some examples of DVD-authoring software are DVD-AUDIO Solo Plus
(Windows), Minnetonka Audio Software discWelder (Mac and Windows),
Steinberg Wavelab (Windows), and DVD Audio Tools for Linux. See “DVD-
Audio Authoring Software” on page 129 for more information.
NOTE
You may want to review Chapters 1 and 2 for refreshers on using Audacity and for
recording studio basics.
What Are WAV, AIFF, and FLAC?
Let the iPod and Zune set have their tiny, overpriced lo-ﬁdevices, for there
is a whole world of high-ﬁdelity digital audio to explore. As we discussed in
Chapter 3, digital audio has many advantages over analog audio. Audacity
has native support for three high-quality PCM audio formats: WAV, AIFF,
and FLAC. WAV and AIFF are pretty much the same thing.
Waveform Audio Format (WAV) was developed by IBM and Microsoft from
the Interchange File Format (IFF), which was developed by Electronic Arts
(EA) and Commodore-Amiga in the mid-1980s. IFF can carry text, image,
or audio data, and it was intended to be a generic wrapper for exchanging
different types of data across diverse platforms.
Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) was developed by Apple, and it is
also based on IFF. There are small technical differences between WAV and
AIFF because they were developed to run on different operating systems, but
these days both are well supported by most software media players.
Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is a high-quality lossless compressed
format. It is an open and unencumbered standard. Online music services
such as Magnatune, the Philadelphia Orchestra online music store, and
Linn Records offer downloads in FLAC format because it is equal in quality
to WAV in a smaller ﬁle size. FLAC is well supported and growing in popu-
larity.
120
Chapter 6

FLAC, WAV, and AIFF are linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM). Lin-
ear means integer, which we’ll discuss in detail in “Creating High-Quality
Recordings in Audacity” on page 122.
All three are excellent choices for both your studio masters and your ﬁ-
nal exports. You can make perfect copies of them for archiving and backups,
and you can generate lower-resolution copies in lossy formats such as Ogg
Vorbis and MP3. Your workﬂow looks like this:
1.
Source material, such as live recordings or copies of legacy media, is
converted to high-resolution masters in Audacity.
2.
Generate ﬁles for playback in FLAC, WAV, or AIFF.
3.
Use special authoring software to write tracks to DVD.
DVD-Audio Overview
DVD-Audio is a digital audio format for DVDs. It is not the same as the au-
dio formats used in DVD movies but is a different format just for audio.
DVD movies use various compressed, lossy audio formats to preserve disk
space, which even on a DVD is at a premium when you combine movie-
length video and multichannel surround sound. DVD-Audio supports pro-
fessional studio master audio quality, which is 24/192. If you’re content with
CD audio (16/44.1 stereo), you can cram about seven hours’ worth onto
a single standard 4.7GB DVD. At 24/192, you’ll get about 75 minutes of
music on a standard DVD. Some DVD-authoring software supports writing
to 8.5GB double-layer DVDs, so you can really pile in the tunes. The DVD-
Audio standard also supports still pictures and video menus.
NOTE
Sometimes home-burned double-layer DVDs are not reliable on different playback de-
vices. Stick with the good-quality brands of DVD blanks and make sure that your DVD
player supports both double-layer DVD-R and DVD-Audio. Your particular DVD writer
may work better with speciﬁc brands of blanks, so use what your manufacturer recom-
mends.
DVD-Audio is an LPCM format like WAV and AIFF. It supports bit depths
of 16, 20, and 24 and sampling rates up to 192 kHz. Audacity supports 16-
and 24-bit depths and pretty much any sampling rate you want. If the rate
you want isn’t in the Edit > Preferences > Quality dialog, just enter your
own in Edit > Preferences > Quality > Default Sample Rate > Other.
DVD-Audio has a theoretical dynamic range of 144 dB, though the lim-
itations of audio hardware mean your maximum dynamic range is always
about 120 dB. Dynamic range in this context isn’t about cranking the vol-
ume or blasting your listeners with sudden extreme peaks; the advantages of
an extremely wide dynamic range are loads of headroom for recording and
processing and a very low noise ﬂoor.
DVD-Audio supports a range of stereo and surround channel com-
binations at 24 bits: 1.0 mono and 2.0 stereo at sampling rates of 44.1 kHz,
48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, and 192 kHz.
Authoring Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs
121

These all support sampling rates of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and
96 kHz at 24 bits:
•
2.1 stereo
(left, right, LFE)
•
3.0
(left, right, surround)
•
3.1
(left, right, surround, LFE)
•
4.0
(left, right, center, surround)
•
4.1
(left, right, center, surround, LFE)
•
5.0
(left, right, center, surround right, surround left)
•
5.1
(left, right, center, surround right, surround left, LFE)
The low-frequency effects (LFE) channel deserves a bit of explanation. It’s
often assumed to be the subwoofer channel, but this is not quite right. The
LFE channel is a special channel that carries sounds in the 3 Hz to 200 Hz
frequency range, and the LFE signal can be sent to any speaker capable of
handling this range.
Uncompressed DVD-Audio has a bitrate limit of 9.6Mbps, so you can
have glorious 24/192 two-channel stereo. But you’re not going to get un-
compressed 5.1 surround at full 24/192 resolution because 9.6Mbps is not
enough bandwidth for full resolution on all of those channels. The best
you’ll get is 24/96 in 5.1. You can have different resolutions on different
channels, such as 24/96 for the two front channels and 16/48 on the sur-
round channels. You need compression to get higher resolution for 5.1, and
the only compression supported by the DVD-Audio standard is the propri-
etary Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) lossless compression. A license for
MLP is expensive, usually more than $2,000, and available only for Windows
and Mac authoring software.
Creating High-Quality Recordings in Audacity
Your starting point is the highest-quality audio ﬁles you can create. This
does not necessarily mean recording at the highest possible sampling and
bitrates, but using good recording techniques to produce the best-sounding
recordings. As we discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, a lot of factors affect the
quality of your audio recordings: background noise, microphone placement,
the quality of your mics, preamp, analog-to-digital converter, and the power
of your computer.
Audacity supports up to 32/192 recording, so let’s see what the pros and
cons are of using higher resolutions.
More Power
You need a stout CPU to handle high-resolution recording. I have one PC
with an Athlon LE-1620 2.4 GHz and 4GB of RAM. It is a single-core CPU,
and it bogs down at sampling rates higher than 48 kHz. Multicore CPUs are
wonderful for audio production. Audacity is not designed to take advantage
122
Chapter 6

of multiple cores, but you’ll still see a signiﬁcant performance improve-
ment because your operating system will use those extra cores for other
tasks, which frees up CPU cycles for Audacity. I also have a system with a
three-core CPU (AMD Phenom X3), and it handles eight channels at 24/96
with no trouble (using a Focusrite Safﬁre Pro 26 I/O FireWire recording
interface).
I haven’t noticed any advantage in having more than 4GB RAM, but
memory is so cheap it doesn’t hurt to load up. (See Chapters 13 and 14 to
learn about tuning your computer for best audio performance.)
What Bit Depth Is Best?
The Audacity documentation recommends recording at 32-bit ﬂoat and
then downsampling to your desired bit depth for your ﬁnal export. So even
though your ﬁnal product is 24 or 16 bit, starting from 32-bit ﬂoat results
in higher quality than recording in 24- or 16-bit integer. This is true even
if your recording interface supports only 16 bits. You will always downsam-
ple because there are no 32-bit playback devices; you must always export to
24-bit or lower integer (also called linear) formats. 32-bit ﬂoat is always an
intermediate step, not the ﬁnal result.
Let’s talk about what 32-bit ﬂoat is, since it is rather misunderstood. In-
tegers are whole numbers, and ﬂoat means ﬂoating decimal point. A 32-bit
ﬂoat number is a 24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent. 32-bit ﬂoat means
great precision and very high resolution. You get a smoother, more accurate
response curve across the whole range of your analog-to-digital conversion.
Bit depth controls dynamic range, and in audio production dynamic
range is very important. Each bit equals about 6 dB dynamic range. So,
16-bit has a dynamic range of 96 dB, 24-bit is 144 dB, and 32-bit ﬂoat is
about 1,500 dB; 32-bit integer is 196 dB. There are limitations in electronic
hardware that limit actual dynamic range to a maximum of about 120 dB,
and most people don’t care to listen to music with a dynamic range greater
than 50 dB, which is quite a lot. So what’s the point of having very wide dy-
namic range? The value of all that dynamic range is abundant headroom for
editing, lowest noise, less risk of clipping, and lossless exports to lower bit
depths.
Those extra eight bits make all the difference when you’re doing a lot
of manipulation and effects. You can mangle your 32-bit ﬁles to your heart’s
content and when you’re ﬁnished make a lossless 24-bit export. If you started
from a 24-bit ﬁle, applied a lot of processing, and ﬁnished with a 24-bit ex-
port, you would likely introduce some noise and experience some loss of
quality.
We dinosaurs from the analog era have a habit of pushing recording
levels as close to the red line as possible, because there were good reasons
for doing so. Even the best analog tapes and recorders created a bit of hiss
and had a relatively narrow dynamic range, so we had to push the limits of
signal to noise to minimize this. Going a bit over the red line didn’t matter
very much with analog audio because it was a gradual effect—at +2 or +3 the
distortion was bothersome only to the fussiest of listeners. At +4 or +5 you
Authoring Super High-Fidelity Audio DVDs
123

were a cool rock band. In digital audio it’s all or nothing—when a signal
passes 0 dB, everything over zero is discarded, or clipped. You might hear
an audible click or something similar to the familiar analog distortion buzz.
It’s easy to hear for yourself. Just plug in a mic, crank up the gain, and talk
loudly. Or use Generate > Tone to create a sine wave, and then use Effect
> Amplify to crank it way up over zero. You can ﬁnd clipped segments eas-
ily by selecting View > Show Clipping, which uses red bars to mark clipped
passages.
Some documentation says that recording at 32-bit ﬂoat means virtually
no distortion, even if you go over 0 dB. But there are several variables that
affect any sounds that go over 0 dB, mainly the software processing your
sounds. Different Audacity plug-ins, or any other software that you might
use, will process sounds over 0 dB in different ways, so you could still get
clipping and create distortion. It’s not necessary to push your recording lev-
els that high anyway since you have dynamic range to burn.
The short story is that the 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit depths all offer more
dynamic range than you’ll ever be able to use, so you’ll have plenty of head-
room with any of them. When you’re recording at 24-bit depth, you can
handily afford to throw away the top 12 dB. At 16 bits you can set your peaks
to −6 or −9 dB and have no worries. Audacity’s 32-bit ﬂoat means you can
record to a peak of −24 dB, which is helpful at a live show to allow for unex-
pected peaks.
Of course, there are downsides to recording at high bit depths and
sampling rates. Higher resolutions eat up disk space and require more CPU
power (Table 6-1).
Table 6-1: How Much Disk Space per Stereo Minute Is Used
by Different Bit Depth/Sampling Rate Combinations

16/48

24/48
17MB
24/96

24/192
66MB
If you overload your CPU, you’ll get dropouts, which sound terrible. If
you like skips, pops, and fuzz, it’s better to add them on purpose as special
effects.
Consider the complexity of what you’re recording. Simple voice record-
ings, such as an audio book or podcast, don’t beneﬁt much from super-high
resolutions. A solo singer or instrumentalist or a small band can be cap-
tured perfectly at 16/44.1, while a symphony orchestra will use everything
you have.
So the answer to the question “Which one is best?” once again is “It de-
pends.” If you have enough computer power and storage, recording at 32-bit
124
Chapter 6

ﬂoat with any sampling rate gives you loads of elbow room for all kinds of
editing and exporting. You can always go downward, but you can’t go up-
ward. On the other hand, if you are careful and skilled, all the links in your
audio chain are good quality, and your own ears are pleased with the results,
then lower resolutions are plenty ﬁne. The fun part is you can do this any
way you want.
What Sampling Rate Is Best?
Now that we’ve thoroughly thrashed out bit depths, what about sampling
rates? As we learned in Chapter 1, sampling rates determine frequency range.
The frequency range is about half the sampling rate. The best human hear-
ing has a range of about 20 Hz to 22 kHz, so a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz
should cover the range of human hearing. The better audio hardware has
an upper limit of 20 to 30 kHz.
But it’s not quite that simple. Some studies seem to indicate that very
high frequencies are still perceived in some manner and add to the listener’s
enjoyment. What they might be talking about are the harmonics. If you
have a sound at 100 Hz, there are harmonics of that sound at 25 Hz, 50 Hz,
200 Hz, and so on. When you limit the frequency range, you also limit the
harmonics.
If you have good hearing and are fussy about your music, I wager you’ll
be happier with 24 bits than 16. In my experience, bit depth makes a more
obvious difference than sampling rates. I record at 32-bit ﬂoat/48 and ex-
port to 24/48 when I want best quality. Don’t upsample, because all that
does is add bits without adding quality, and most likely it will sound a little
worse.
Saving Your Masters
Audacity project (.aup) ﬁles are not quite adequate for archiving, because
every time you edit a project they change. They are fast and efﬁcient work-
spaces. But project ﬁles have been known to be fragile; if a project becomes
corrupted, you have only Audacity’s automatic recovery mechanism to ﬁx it.
If that fails, game over. A good way to archive your studio masters is to ex-
port them as WAVs or FLACs. The highest quality is a 32-bit ﬂoat WAV. (Se-
lect File > Export > Options.) Then you won’t lose so much as a bit and will
always have a high-quality master. FLAC maxes out at 24-bit integer, which is
still a lot of bits, and FLAC ﬁles are smaller than WAV.
Multitrack recordings take a bit of care to preserve as WAVs or FLACs,
because the Audacity track names and channel mappings get lost at export
and are preserved only in your Audacity project ﬁles. If you export a big
multitrack project as a single ﬁle, you’ll get all your tracks back but without
their track names. Instead, they will all have the ﬁlename. If you select Ex-
port > Multiple, which exports each track into an individual ﬁle, the track
names will become the ﬁlenames.
I save both Audacity project ﬁles and 32-bit ﬂoat WAV masters. “Saving
Your Work” on page 13 goes into more detail on making backups.

Creating 5.1 Surround
Audacity 1.3.8 and newer can record as many tracks at the same time as your
sound card supports and your computer can handle. Older Audacity ver-
sions support a maximum of 16 tracks at once. Set the correct number of
tracks in Edit > Preferences > Devices. If your recording interface supports
fewer channels than you want to record, you’ll have to lay them down in
multiple sessions (see Chapter 9).
Audacity 1.3.3 and newer come with a simple multichannel mixer inter-
face for mapping your tracks to the correct surround channels, as Figure 6-1
shows. Make sure the slider at the bottom is set to the correct number of
output channels.
Figure 6-1: Simple mixer and channel mapper
This mixer appears automatically when you export ﬁles if you open the
Edit > Preferences > Import/Export dialog and select “Use custom mix.”
Unfortunately, Audacity doesn’t tell you what track is going to which chan-
nel. So use this guide, which details the DVD-Audio channel-numbering
convention:

To keep from driving yourself crazy, name your tracks so you know what
they are (using the Track menu), as Figure 6-2 shows. You can name them
whatever you want.

tracks helpful names
Then you’ll see the track names in the mixer. However, in Figure 6-3 the
two front channels are in the wrong order. No problem—just click them to
remap them to the correct channels and make them look like Figure 6-4.

two channels. Tracks can be mapped to more than one channel.

Exporting to 16-Bit
You might try applying some dithering when downsampling from 32 or 24 bits
to 16. This is set in the Edit > Preferences > Quality > High-quality Conver-
sion drop-down menus. Dither is deliberately adding noise to smooth the
rough edges for a cleaner sound. Shaped dither is considered to give the
best results, but it is also the most CPU-intensive. Triangular is a good com-
promise between quality and CPU cost, and rectangular is lightweight and
makes the smallest alterations. Dithering isn’t needed on 24-bit ﬁles, though
I won’t complain if you want to experiment and hear for yourself.
DVD-Audio Authoring Software
Once you have your FLAC, WAV, or AIFF audio ﬁles all ready to copy to a
DVD, all you need are plain old normal DVD blanks, an ordinary computer
DVD writer, and special DVD-Audio authoring software. Here are some
examples:
DVD Audio Tools for Linux
Linux has only one DVD-Audio author-
ing application that I know of, and that is DVD Audio Tools (http://www
.dvd-audio.sourceforge.net/). It has both a command-line interface and a
nice graphical interface. It runs on both Linux and Windows, and it is
free software (licensed under the GPL) and free of cost.
DVD Audio Tools is simple and streamlined—the ﬁrst time you use
it, you should have a playable DVD in an hour. It accepts both FLAC and
WAV ﬁles. You can also use it to “rip” audio tracks from unencrypted
DVDs. DVD Audio Tools only creates a disk image, so you’ll need to
burn the disk with your usual favorite DVD-writing application.
DVD-AUDIO Solo Plus
Cirlinca’s DVD-AUDIO Solo Plus (http://
www.cirlinca.com/products.htm) is a nice Windows program that supports
just about everything you would want to do: It supports multichannel
surround, 8.5GB dual-layer discs, gapless playback, and unencrypted
CD/DVD ripping. Currently, it retails for about $45. Cirlinca does not
offer Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) licenses. (MLP is a patented
method of lossless compression for DVD-Audio.)
Minnetonka Audio Software discWelder
discWelder for Windows
(http://www.minnetonkaaudio.com/) comes in three editions: Bronze,
Chrome, and Steel. Bronze is priced at $99, Steel is $595, and Chrome
wants $2,995 to follow you home. Another $2,000 gets you MLP. Bronze
is comparable to DVD-AUDIO Solo Plus. Steel supports 8.5GB dual-layer
disks and slide show graphics and gives you complete control over mix-
ing and mapping. For that price Chrome should cook your breakfast
and clean your house, but it doesn’t. Instead, it adds support for ani-
mated graphics, lets you have both stereo and surround streams, and
exports to DLT tape. There are also Mac versions.

Steinberg Wavelab
Steinberg’s Wavelab 7 (http://www.steinberg.net/en/
products/wavelab.html) comes in two editions: Wavelab 7 for about $500
and Wavelab Elements 7 for about $100. These come with bales of fea-
tures for audio editing, mastering, special effects, multichannel sur-
round, and, of course, DVD-Audio.
After you spend all that money and go to all that trouble, you don’t
want grotty old hand-scrawled disk labels, do you? No, you don’t, and that
is why you are going to spend a few bucks on a new LightScribe DVD burner.
These cost the same as ordinary old-fashioned DVD burners, which is $50 or
less, and you can burn fancy disk labels right into the disk. You have to pur-
chase LightScribe DVD blanks, which currently cost a small bit more than
the ordinary kind. Both Linux and Windows have software for creating the
labels.
Another option is to purchase inkjet-printable DVD blanks, and then
you can make color labels. You’ll need an inkjet printer with a special
CD/DVD tray to use these.
A plain old felt pen is also perfectly ﬁne for writing your disk labels.
Remember, you don’t want to use sticky paper disk labels, because the
glue degrades the disk over time.
Transferring Legacy Media
In Chapter 3, we learned how to convert legacy analog media to digital for-
mats. Tapes and vinyl records require jumping through some extra hard-
ware hoops to get everything connected. CDs and DVDs are easier, because
you can do everything on your computer. First copy the CD, DVD, or legacy
media to your computer. The popular term for copying CDs and DVDs is rip-
ping, and this is done with special, easily obtained software. Some good DVD
rippers for Linux are K9copy, dvd::rip, and VLC. You need libdvdcss to rip
encoded DVDs. libdvdcss is available in many Linux distributions and should
be easy to ﬁnd.
HandBrake is one of the best Windows DVD rippers, and it even has
a command-line-only version for Linux. VLC also runs on Windows, and
DVDFab Platinum is very good. All of these let you select just the audio tracks.
Try VLC ﬁrst; it is open source and free of cost, and it has the most features.
With VLC you can extract and transcode your DVD-Audio tracks into almost
any format.
CD rippers are legion. Linux users can also try K3B, KAudioCreator,
Brasero, Asunder, SoundJuicer, and Grip. Windows users can also try Win-
dows Media Player, Audiograbber, and Winamp.
A good archive format for CDs ripped to a hard drive is 16-bit FLAC,
and 24-bit FLAC is appropriate for most DVD-Audio tracks. It makes a
perfect copy and saves disk space. If you think you’re going to edit your
ripped tracks, consider archiving them as 32-bit ﬂoat WAV masters to give
yourself some headroom for future editing.

What About SACD?
Music lovers are always asking “What about Sony/Phillips’s Super
Audio CD (SACD)?” SACD is not an option for the home or small
studio because the recorders are very expensive, plus you must
pay format license and patent fees, which is a shame, because it’s
a real breakthrough. SACD takes one-bit samples at a 2.82 MHz
sampling rate. That’s right, 2.82 million times per second. That
is a tad more than the standard Red Book CD sampling rate of
44.1 kHz. On paper, it’s closer to an analog waveform than any
other digital format. SACD does not use pulse code modula-
tion (PCM) but a new method of recording and playback that
is called Direct Stream Digital (DSD). PCM requires interpola-
tion and oversampling ﬁlters, while DSD employs a more direct,
less-complex signal path. SACD has a potential dynamic range of
around 100 dB.
It seems that vendors of both SACD and DVD-Audio became
bogged down in DRM nonsense, rather than marketing these
high-quality formats in a pleasing and attractive manner, so both
have been slow to gain traction in the marketplace. I think they
are both going to fade away eventually.

CREATING PODCASTS
Thanks to the Internet, everyone who is
anyone is making podcasts. Now anyone
with a little bit of recording gear and an In-
ternet connection can create an audio broad-
cast to share with the world. You can tell stories, report
news, and share how-tos. Your podcast can be just you
talking, you interviewing another person, you and a
cohost, or you and a gaggle of cohosts and guests. You
can add a music track or special effects. Making pod-
casts with Audacity is easy and fun.
Once you have created your masterpiece, you need a website to host it
and make it available to your eager audience. The Internet is full of free and
inexpensive podcast hosts. If you have enough bandwidth and want to be
your own server admin, you can be your own host thanks to the multitudes
of free and open source streaming server software.
The term podcast used to refer to downloadable MP3-encoded record-
ings for iPods. Apple made a brief, ferocious attempt to own the word pod
and sicced lawyers on a number of small businesses who dared to use the
word, such as TightPod (laptop-protecting covers), Proﬁt Pod (data collec-
tor for vending machines), Spodradio (a German online broadcaster), and

Podcast Ready (another online broadcaster). Fortunately, it seems that the
attack lawyers have moved on to something else, and it is safe to say “pod”
again. So, that is what we are going to do: pea pod, pod of whales, pod peo-
ple. Open the pod bay door, Hal.
Audacity is a dandy tool for making podcasts. You can use a digital re-
corder and then dump the recording into Audacity for editing, or you can
record directly into a computer. A USB microphone or headset connected
to a netbook makes a great lightweight portable recording studio. Or, you
may indulge in using an entire studio full of fancy expensive gear; it’s en-
tirely up to you.
Up until now in this book I’ve been nattering on about high-quality au-
dio and not using lossy, compressed audio ﬁle formats. With podcasts we’re
going the other way: smaller ﬁle sizes and lossy, compressed formats. You
still want to start with creating a high-quality master, but it’s not necessary
to treat your podcast the same way as an ultimate audiophile music record-
ing, because it is going to be trimmed down for Internet streaming and fast
downloads.
You may want to review Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 ﬁrst to learn the funda-
mentals of using Audacity and how to set up your recording gear.
The Short Story
Making a simple podcast takes just a few steps:
1.
Make your recording.
2.
Edit it in Audacity: trim, repair, normalize—the usual cleanups and
ﬁxes.
3.
Export to a playable compressed format such as Ogg Vorbis or MP3.
4.
Upload to a site where your fans can download and enjoy your podcast.
Let’s take a look at the ﬁner points of making a good podcast.
NOTE
Audio terminology is a bit confused when it comes to deﬁning track. Track can be a
single mono track, a stereo track, and even a sound track. In Audacity, it is helpful
to think of a track as any single editable unit, which is any mono track or stereo track.
Any edits that you make, such as deletions, additions, special effects, and so on, will
be applied equally to the left and right channels in an Audacity stereo track.
Making a Simple Voicecast
The simplest podcast is just you talking. As simple as this sounds, speaking
into a microphone takes a bit of practice. You might practice speaking into
a microphone without creating unwanted noises such as smacks, pops, loud
breathing, clicking dentures, or any other unpleasant sounds. Beware ver-
bal ticks like “uh, um, you know.” Practice gauging the optimal distance be-
tween your mouth and the microphone, and set it up so that you can stand
or sit comfortably. Using a mic stand is better than hand-holding, and if
134
Chapter 7

you’re using a lavalier mic, clip it where your clothing won’t rub on it. I pre-
fer a good-quality USB headset. Speak past the mic as though you have an
audience in the room, rather than into the mic; this will help you energize
your voice and project it in a way that will reduce unwanted side effects. A
windscreen or a foam windsock is essential.
How fast should you speak? This depends on your personality and the
type of material. Usually 120 words per minute is cited as a good rate, though
it will feel slow to most English speakers. This doesn’t necessarily mean a
speed limit of two words per second, but it means relaxing and using care-
fully timed pauses to allow listeners a chance to absorb what you’re saying.
I use a Plantronics stereo USB headset for voice recordings (Figure 7-1).
It’s comfortable and easy to use, and the sound quality is good. USB record-
ing interfaces have their own analog-to-digital converters, so you don’t need
a sound card. They also eliminate the risk of picking up internal computer
noise, which is sometimes a problem with internal sound cards.
Figure 7-1: A good USB headset is a great tool for making
voice recordings.
It takes a lot of practice to speak well without a script or rehearsing, so
don’t feel bad if you need them. It’s better to make as clean a recording as
possible than to clean up a recording all full of bad stuff, and your listeners
will appreciate a crisp, focused presentation.
Audacity Settings
First create a new Audacity project with File > Save Project As.
Then set your recording and playback devices in the Edit > Preferences
> Devices dialog, and set your channels to however many you are recording
at one time. If it is just you with a mono microphone, set one channel. If
you are using a stereo mic or headset, that is two. Beware of cheapo onboard
sound chips, like the ones used in laptops—the microphone input is often
mono even if they claim it’s stereo.
In the Edit > Preferences > Quality dialog, set a default sample rate of
44,100 and a default sample format (which is really bit depth; Audacity has a
Creating Podcasts
135

few terminology quirks) of 32-bit ﬂoat. (See Chapter 1 for more information
on bit depths and sampling rates.) You can record at a higher audio reso-
lution if you prefer, but for a simple voicecast, those extra bits aren’t going
to make any difference. In fact, you could use 16/44.1. It saves disk space,
sounds good, and exports to lower-quality formats like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis
just ﬁne.
Now go to the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog, make sure that
“Overdub: Play other tracks while recording new one” and “Software Play-
through: Listen while recording or monitoring new track” are not checked.
Leave the Preferences menu and click the Input Level Meter to start
monitoring and to set your recording level (Figure 7-2). This might take
a bit of trial and error, depending on how much variation there is in your
voice. Record to a peak of −9 or −12 dB to give yourself a good safety mar-
gin, and you’ll still have a very good signal-to-noise ratio. Never go over zero;
that results in clipping, which creates distortion. The blue lines mark the
highest peak for the session, and the red lines mark the highest peak in the
Figure 7-2: Setting the recording level
last three seconds. The
dark red bars indicate
peak levels, and the light
red bars show the average
amplitude.
Most USB headsets come with Windows software that lets you control
both the input and output volumes. Linux users may have to rely on ALSA
(see Chapter 13) to set the volume levels. The Audacity Mixer toolbar (Fig-
Figure 7-3: The Audacity Mixer toolbar
ure 7-3) works with audio interfaces if
their drivers support volume controls.
Many don’t. This is why I love recording
interfaces with ordinary, old-fashioned
knobs to twiddle.
And now, the moment you’ve been waiting for—click the Record button
and start talking! Figure 7-4 shows a voice recording in progress.
Click Pause to stop recording, and Record to append to your existing
track. If you click Stop and then click Record, you will create a new track. If
you click Stop by mistake, pick up where you left off with SHIFT-Record.
Cleaning Up Your Recording
Once you have recorded your deep thoughts, you can go back and clean
up your recording. First, delete anything you don’t want to keep; just do
a rough cut on your ﬁrst pass and leave a bit extra. You can always delete
more, but you can’t put back very easily. If you have more than one track, be
mindful of keeping them synchronized (though if they do get out of sync,
there are simple ways to get them back together).
Then select View > Show Clipping to highlight in red any clipped seg-
ments. If you ﬁnd some, there are a number of ways to ﬁx them.
If it is a very brief clip, less than a quarter second in duration, zoom in
until you can precisely select the clipped part and delete it. When it’s a frac-
tion of a second, no one will notice.
136
Chapter 7

Figure 7-4: At last, we’re making our recording!
Another way is to re-record the clipped segment at the correct record-
ing level in a second track or Audacity window and then copy that over the
clipped segment. It’s not easy to replace a short segment surgically, so you
might select a longer section to replace. Look for natural breaks so you can
patch the new part in gracefully, as in Figure 7-5. The selection in Figure 7-5
is about four seconds long, even though the clipped portion (indicated by
the three vertical peaks between the six-second mark and the six-and-a-half–
second marks) is less than a half second in duration.
Figure 7-5: Making a smoother patch by selecting a segment to replace at natural
breaks
Now here is a cool trick that I like because it helps me keep track of
where I am editing. If you have used Audacity very much, you know that a
Creating Podcasts
137

slip of the mouse or accidentally hitting a hotkey will lose your place, and if
it’s a long track, it’s a pain to get back to where you where. So, don’t delete
your selection but instead use Edit > Split Delete. This replaces the selec-
tion with an empty gap, as in Figure 7-6. This also keeps your track at the
same length, which you might want if you have two or more tracks to keep
synchronized.
Figure 7-6: Using Edit > Split Delete to leave a gap
marking your deletion
Now you can go ahead and make your rerecording. Don’t worry about
making the recording levels exactly the same as in your original project be-
cause that is easy to adjust with Effect > Amplify. When it is satisfactory, with
nary a belch, bump, or cough, copy it and paste it into the gap (Figure 7-7).
The edges may not exactly match, but we can ﬁx that.
Figure 7-7: Paste the new segment into the gap you
left when you deleted the bad bit.
There are a number of ways to deal with the empty parts on either side
of the new segment. The simplest is to delete them. If you don’t want to
shorten the track, use Generate > Silence to ﬁll the gaps.
Another way is to use the Time Shift tool to move everything together.
The edges will match exactly when you see the Snap Guide appear, which is
a yellow vertical line that appears when borders are perfectly lined up. Click
138
Chapter 7

to mark the place where the borders join, and then zoom way in until you
can use the Repair effect to smooth over the edge of your patch. This op-
erates on a maximum sample size of 128 samples, so zoom way in until you
can make a selection that small. The Zoom tool centers on wherever you
click. Then click Effect > Repair, which uses interpolation to make a seam-
less join.
One more fun Audacity trick for stretching out a patch is to use Effect
> Change Tempo to slow down your patch without changing the pitch. You
can measure the exact length required by selecting the “Length” radio but-
ton in the Selection toolbar and then make a selection from the beginning
of your patch to the end of the gap. The yellow Snap Guides will appear
when you are exactly on your borders. The example in Figure 7-8 needs to
be 60 seconds long.
Then select just your patch, click Effect > Change Tempo, and enter
the new length, as shown in Figure 7-9. Click the Preview button, and if it
doesn’t sound too weird, click OK, and you’re done.

out how long your
patch needs to be

Reducing Too-Tall Peaks
You should also look for any disproportionately tall peaks in your waveform
(Figure 7-10, at 2.7 to 3 seconds), even if they aren’t clipped, and review
them to decide whether they need to be reduced. In this example, I was
speaking too loudly from the excitement of making a podcast, so I used Ef-
fect > Amplify to reduce the amplitude. Yes, it says “amplify,” but if you give
it a negative value (such as −3 or −6 dB), it will attenuate.
You can use trial and error to ﬁgure out how much reduction in volume
to apply, or you can use the Waveform (db) view to get an idea of how much
you need. Change the waveform display to Waveform (db) in the Track
menu (Figure 7-11), and then expand the width of the track (grab the bor-
der with the mouse and pull) until you see the decibel scale on the left (Fig-
ure 7-12). In this example, it looks like the loud part could be as many as
12 decibels too loud, so that gives me a starting point of −12 to try. Remem-
ber, Audacity gives you nearly unlimited undos (Edit > Undo or CTRL-Z), so
it’s safe to use trial and error.

Figure 7-10: The portion from 2.7 to 3 seconds is
too loud.
The decibel scale in the Track panel is adjustable in the Edit > Prefer-
ences > Interface dialog, from 0 to −36 to 0 to −145. This lets you adjust
the display to whatever is useful for you. I usually keep it at −60 because that
gives me plenty of detail without making the scale too large.
Figure 7-11:

Figure 7-12: This selection could be as many as 12 decibels
too loud.
Fades
There are two ways to control fading in and fading out. The easy way is to
select the track segment you want to fade in or out and then click Effect >
Fade In or Fade Out. All you do is control the length of the fade.
For ﬁner-grained control, use the Envelope tool. Click the waveform to
create control nodes, and then drag these around to make different parts of
your track louder or quieter. Drag nodes past the track boundary to get rid
of them.
140
Chapter 7

Normalization
Figure 7-13: The waveform
before normalization (above)
and after (below)
When you have your track all trimmed and
cleaned up, the last step is to apply Effect >
Normalize. Make sure both boxes in the Nor-
malize dialog are checked (“Remove any DC
offset” and “Normalize maximum amplitude”).
DC offset refers to the mean amplitude; if this
is not zero, then normalization won’t be ap-
plied correctly because the amplitude levels will
be off balance, and it might even create a bit
of distortion. Figure 7-13 shows an example of
DC offset, before and after correction. In the
top track, you can see how the whole waveform
is not quite centered on zero, and then in the
bottom track it is.
Export to MP3 or Ogg?
Now that your recording is all cleaned up, it is time to export it to a com-
pressed lossy format, either Ogg Vorbis or MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, not
MPEG-3). (Refer to Chapters 13 and 14 to learn how to enable MP3 support
on Linux and Windows.)
MP3 is the universal portable digital audio format: Everything supports
MP3. As we discussed in Chapter 1, there are differences between Ogg Vor-
bis and MP3. Some listeners claim that Ogg Vorbis delivers higher quality
than MP3. At low bitrates, neither one sounds very good to me; rather, they
sound ﬂat and without character or depth. At higher bitrates, both sound ac-
ceptable, though I think Ogg delivers a more accurate, natural sound. MP3s
sound a bit too-bright and crunchy.
Ogg Vorbis supports multichannel surround, while MP3 supports one or
two channels. MP3 is encumbered by patents held by several different patent
holders in different countries, and the last one expires on 2017. Does this
mean you’ll get a visit from attack lawyers if you distribute your work in MP3
format? I don’t know. It seems that a lot of artists distribute their work as
MP3s without paying license fees and don’t get in trouble. Ask a lawyer who
specializes in these issues.
Even if your listeners all have megamondo broadband, it’s a good prac-
tice to maintain a frugal attitude. And they don’t all have fat pipes; estimates
of US dial-up users range from 25 to 45 percent. Don’t forget that the Inter-
net is international, so your potential audience includes countries that rely
on dial-up and low-speed wireless. Even for broadband users, network con-
gestion and queuing gum up streaming media, so the moral is that stream-
ing audio is still more reliable at lower bitrates.
As always, there are trade-offs. If your podcast host allows it, you can of-
fer your listeners a choice of listening options at different quality levels and
both streaming and downloadable ﬁles.

Ogg Vorbis Quality Settings
Ogg exports are easy in Audacity. You might have read how-tos that say to
use a variable bitrate (vbr) rather than a constant bitrate (cbr). Although
this is good advice, it is unnecessary because Ogg Vorbis does not support
cbr. Select File > Export > Save as type: Ogg Vorbis Files, and then click
the Options button (Figure 7-14). Exporting to Ogg Vorbis is simple: Pick a
number. 0 is the lowest quality and smallest ﬁle size, and 10 is the best qual-
ity and largest ﬁle size.
Figure 7-14: Setting Ogg Vorbis quality level
A variable bitrate means that simple passages will have a lower bitrate,
and more complex passages will have a higher bitrate. This delivers better
quality than a ﬁxed bitrate. You won’t be able to calculate ﬁle sizes precisely,
but the ﬁne folks who invented Ogg Vorbis don’t think much of measuring
quality by bitrates anyway. To give a basis for comparison, a quality setting
of 3 results in an average bitrate of around 112Kbps, and Ogg fans claim it
sounds better than a 128Kbps MP3.
Ogg Vorbis uses lossy channel coupling up to level 5. Redundancies be-
tween the left and right channels are combined to save space. This might
affect the stereo imaging, so if this bothers you, use a quality setting of 6 or
higher because channel coupling is turned off at this level. I use 6. My ears
can’t tell the difference between 7 and up. Your ears, of course, may tell you
a different story.
For a simple voicecast, you can go all the way down to 0, and it still sounds
acceptable.
MP3 Quality Settings
On both Linux and Windows, you may have to install an MP3 encoder sepa-
rately. Use the LAME MP3 encoder because it is high quality, free of cost, and
open source. Linux users can install it from their usual package repositories,
and Windows users should follow the instructions at the Audacity downloads
page (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&item=lame-mp3).
NOTE
Windows users should visit the OSSwin project (http://osswin.sourceforge.net/)
to ﬁnd links to hundreds of excellent open source applications for Windows.

Chapter 7

I don’t know if audio geeks love to argue for the sake of arguing or sim-
ply have strong passions about everything, because MP3 quality settings are
mineﬁelds of controversy. Just follow this simple rule, and you’ll be ﬁne: I,
your author, am right (except when your own ears tell you differently).
In Audacity you have four categories for setting the MP3 bitrate: Preset,
Variable, Average, and Constant.
Preset gives you four different prefab combinations that are recom-
mended by the LAME developers: Medium, Standard, Extreme, and In-
sane. Standard is ﬁne for music, but you can go lower for a simple voicecast.
Medium, Standard, and Extreme all use variable bitrates (vbr). Variable bitrate
means the bitrate varies according to the complexity of the sounds, which
results in better audio quality. In the olden days, variable bitrates gave MP3
players ﬁts because they were designed for constant bitrates (cbr). But that was
a long time ago, and these days variable bitrates shouldn’t present any prob-
lems. Variable bitrates are always deﬁned within a range, like the 170Kbps to
210Kbps of the Standard preset.
Insane uses the maximum constant bitrate, 320Kbps. In my experience,
the Standard setting (170Kbps to 210Kbps) is about as good as MP3 can de-
liver, and anything over that doesn’t make a noticeable difference.
Variable has a range of 10 quality settings. Quality setting 5 is 110Kbps
to 150Kbps, which is ﬁne for simple voicecasts.
Average is, in my opinion, not worth bothering with. It is a compromise
between Variable and Constant bitrates. You set a constant bitrate, but since
it’s an average, a little bit of ﬂuctuation is allowed. So the quality is not quite
as good as Variable, and it’s a little better than Constant bitrate.
Constant bitrates are supposed to work better for streaming audio over
the Internet, and you get a predictable ﬁle size. If you want to use constant
bitrates, Audacity gives you a full range to choose from.
Set Variable Speed: Standard. Standard gives better quality, and it takes
a tiny bit longer to encode.
Figure 7-15 and Figure 7-16 show the MP3 export menus and the various
quality settings.
Leave Channel Mode: Stereo, because you have to be desperate for
storage space to even think of using Joint Stereo. If you are desperate for
storage space, to the point that you’re thinking of encoding your MP3 ﬁles
at a bitrate of 112Kbps or lower, then give it a try. The term joint stereo is a
poor name that does not describe what it does. A popular misconception
is that it joins the two stereo channels and destroys the stereo separation.
As always with audio engineering, it’s more complex than that. Here is a
new audio term for you: human psychoacoustics. Isn’t that a splendid phrase?
No, it doesn’t mean psycho like a crazy person with a big knife, sorry. It
means engineering audio in a way that takes into account how the human
ear perceives sounds, instead of adhering to a strictly mathematical model,
which does not correspond to how human hearing really works. It is quite
sophisticated, and if you don’t like the way joint stereo sounds, it’s easy
enough to do over.

of MP3 bitrates.
Figure 7-16: Audacity offers a range of MP3
quality settings and presets.
What is joint stereo? In the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 standard, it means
using any of several techniques to reduce bitrate while preserving an accept-
able level of quality by merging redundancies in the left and right channels.
These “redundancies” are frequencies that the human perceives as less di-
rectional, which are the upper frequencies. It should improve how record-
ings at low bitrates sound because more audio data are preserved at the ex-
pense of stereo imaging.

MP3s, Encoders, and Other Audio Formats
LAME stands for “LAME Ain’t an MP3 Encoder.” In its early days,
it wasn’t an encoder; it was a set of patches against the original
ISO/IEC demonstration source code, so (very hair-splittingly)
technically it was not an encoder. Over time, the LAME devel-
opers wrote all new code until LAME no longer needed the ISO
sources, and now it is, quite blatantly, an encoder. Because of the
confusing patent issues around the MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3)
format, several alternative formats have been developed: Vorbis
(which is open source), Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and Win-
dows Media Audio (WMA). AAC and WMA have their own issues,
which are discussed in a moment.
None of the MP3 patent holders has ever gone after the devel-
opers of open source encoders or individuals using MP3 for their
own private use.
Other Lossy Formats
There are other lossy, compressed audio formats that generate small ﬁle
sizes, such as AAC, WMA, and RealPlayer. Audacity supports these via the
FFmpeg library on Linux and Windows and has some nice export presets.
You may also use the external encoder of your choice, which you can access
via the Save as type drop-down menu in the Export dialog (Figure 7-17).
Figure 7-17: Using the “external program” option to
export with any installed audio encoder.

See Chapters 13 and 14 to learn how to install FFmpeg and MP3.

145

AAC wasn’t very popular until Apple chose it as the default format for
its iTunes Store and all of its audio devices. WMA is the Windows Media For-
mat, and RealPlayer is . . . well, RealPlayer. AAC, WMA, and RealPlayer are
all closed, proprietary formats that are encumbered with various unpleasant
features such as digital rights management (DRM), tracking software, and
patent guff.
Exporting Your Podcast
Once you have decided what format or formats to export your podcast to,
select File > Export to make your actual exports. You can make all kinds of
exports from the same Audacity project. Note that you can export part of a
track by selecting part of it and then selecting File > Export Selection.
Two-Person Podcasts
Say you don’t want to be a lone pontiﬁcating hermit but instead want a
cohost or want to interview another person. The easiest and best way is
for each person to have their own mono microphone going to a separate
recording channel. This makes it a lot easier to make edits and repairs. Be
kind to your listeners and try to make both voices as close to the same vol-
ume level as you can. Let your ears be your guide more than the waveforms,
because even when the waveform says both voices have equal volume, some
people sound louder. (There’s that psychoacoustic thingie again.)
If you’re using a netbook or laptop with a real stereo microphone port,
you can use a splitter for plugging in two mono mics.
Editing a Two-Track Recording as a Single Stereo Track
When you record two channels, Audacity creates a single stereo track no
matter how you are set up. You can use two separate mono mics or a single
stereo mic, and the default is a single stereo track. Figure 7-18 shows how
this looks. (Notice how the waveform indicates that each person has politely
taken turns to speak.)

Figure 7-19:
The Mixer
Board
You can make adjustments in the relative volumes
of the left and right channels by using the cool new
Mixer Board, which ﬁrst appeared in Audacity 1.3.8 (Fig-
ure 7-19.) Use the Mixer Board to adjust the gain, or vol-
ume level, of the track, and use the Pan slider to adjust
the relative volume of the left and right channels. These
adjustments do not change the project ﬁle; you will hear
the changes in playback in Audacity and in your ﬁnal ex-
port, but your Audacity project ﬁles will not be altered.
The Mixer Board controls are all or nothing; they apply
to the whole track and can’t be applied only to sections of
the track.
This is pretty easy, and if you want more control, you
can split your recording into two mono tracks.
Editing a Two-Track Recording as Two Mono Tracks
Splitting your stereo track into two mono tracks gives
you a lot more control. Click the drop-down arrow in the
Track menu, and select Split Stereo Track (Figure 7-20).
Now you have two separate tracks and can make whatever
changes and ﬁxes you need to each one individually.
Figure 7-20: Split a stereo track into
two mono tracks for easy editing.
You should name each track (also by using the Track menu) so you will
always know what they are.
NOTE
Here is a cool trick for the Mixer Board: If you use certain words in your track names
such as guitar, vocals, piano, and even some abbreviations, the icons will match the
names. See “Customizing the Mixer Board” on page 189 to see a complete listing of
keywords.

After splitting your stereo track into two mono tracks, edit each track
separately, making the usual ﬁxes and matching the volume of your two
speakers as well as you can. By default, Audacity plays all tracks at the same
time when you hit Play. Look on the Mixer Board for the Mute and Solo but-
tons to control which ones you want to hear. Solo automatically mutes all
tracks except the one you want to hear; Mute silences one track at a time.
If your two people talk at the same time, you can separate them by adding
silence. For example, if there is ﬁve seconds of overlap where they are both
yakking at once, add ﬁve seconds of silence to one track to push them apart.
Position the cursor where you want the silence to begin, click Generate >
Silence, and enter how many seconds of silence you want. You may have to
do this several times on both tracks to keep them lined up, especially after
making changes.
When you have everything cleaned up and ready to export, rejoin your
tracks by using the Track menu in the upper track and clicking Make Stereo
Track.
Adding a Background Music Track
Now that you’re aces at producing multitrack podcasts, adding a music track
is as easy as falling over. Just like when you make a solo podcast, your sound-
track should be in a two-channel stereo track even if it is a mono recording.
Then your listeners will hear music in both channels. You can create a two-
channel track from a mono track by copying the track, pasting the copy be-
low the original, and selecting Make Stereo Track from the upper track’s
Track menu.
You can add a music ﬁle to your podcast project by opening the File >
Import > Audio dialog or by copying and pasting from another Audacity
project.
You can adjust the music volume with the Gain slider. Remember, the
Gain slider does not alter your project ﬁle, so it’s a quick way to tune your
mix without making a lot of changes that might mess up your project for
future editing. Another option is to use the Envelope tool to vary it from
pleasant background to thrilling crescendo. The Envelope tool does change
the project ﬁle.
There is an even cooler way to manage the volume on your background
music track, and that is with Effect > Auto Duck. This is perfect for record-
ings with a background music track because it automatically lowers the vol-
ume when the foreground track cuts in and raises it when the foreground
cuts out. In Figure 7-21 we see the setup: A background music track is on
top, and the bottom track is the voice track. When the voices start, I want
the music volume to decrease, and when the voices stop, the music should
get louder. The tracks have to be in this order: the background track on top
and the foreground, or control track, underneath.
148
Chapter 7

Figure 7-21: To use Auto Duck, your background track must be on
top and the foreground, or control track, underneath.
Select the background track and hit Effect > Auto Duck. You’ll see a
control panel like the one in Figure 7-22, which shows the settings I like to
use. These settings create a fast fade-out and a gradual fade-in. The back-
ground track ducks out of the way fast and gracefully glides slowly back in
with just a little bit of overlap with the voice track.
Figure 7-22: My suggested Auto Duck settings for a fast fade-out
and slow fade-in
Creating Podcasts

Figure 7-23 shows the result.
Figure 7-23: Auto Duck has been applied; compare these to the
tracks in Figure 7-21.
Duck Amount is how much volume reduction you want on the back-
ground track.
Maximum Pause determines how long the total fade-in and outs will
take. The values for Outer fade down length and Outer fade up length can-
not total more than the maximum pause.
The Outer fade down length setting determines how quickly the back-
ground track will fade before the voice on the control track comes back.
Anything outside the two vertical lines happens when the control track is
below your threshold. The Inner fade down length setting determines how
much overlap there will be with the control track.
The Outer fade up length setting sets how fast the backing track fades
back in when the voice on the control track stops, and the Inner fade up
length setting controls the overlap. A half second of gently rising music over
the voice isn’t a lot; I think it makes a nice bit of a transition.
The Threshold setting controls the sound level for triggering the Auto
Duck effect.
When you are ﬁnished, you need to mix and render your tracks together
into a single stereo track. If you press CTRL-SHIFT-M, this mixes your project
down into a new stereo track underneath your original tracks. This is how I
prefer to mixdown because it saves my original tracks, and then I copy the
new stereo track into a new Audacity project for ﬁnal tweaks and exports. If
you use Tracks > Mix and Render instead, your original tracks are replaced
by the new stereo track.
Sometimes combining multiple tracks makes them too loud, so undo
Mix and Render (CTRL-Z or Edit > Undo) and use the Gain controls to turn
them down a bit. Then export again. (When you have odd problems with
track volume, such as unbalanced sound, check your Gain sliders.)
Now your podcast with its background music track is ready for export.

BECOMING AN ONLINE STAR
So you want to distribute your own record-
ings and maybe even make some money
selling them. In this wonderful Internet
era, online distribution is easy and inexpensive.
There are two distinct skill sets needed for succeeding
at online music distribution: being technically adept at
creating good recordings in various formats for down-
loading and streaming and understanding the business of being a profes-
sional artist, which is complex and involves tasks like customer service, con-
tracts, and copyright issues. In the ﬁrst section of this chapter, we’ll learn
about creating different audio ﬁle formats for various purposes, such as
lower-quality promotional MP3s, streaming audio, and high-quality down-
loads. In the second part, we’ll take a look at the business of being a record-
ing artist, which is trickier than being a good musician and recording whiz.
File Formats and Audio Quality
With Audacity it is easy to export your audio ﬁles to whatever format you
want. Let’s take a look at your options. The common downloadable formats
are AAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and FLAC.

NOTE
Please review Chapter 1 if you need a refresher on exporting to different audio ﬁle for-
mats, and see Chapters 13 and 14 to learn how to set up and tune your system for
audio production.
AAC is becoming popular because that is the format used by Apple’s
iTunes Store. Version 1.3.6 of Audacity introduced support for importing,
exporting, and converting non-DRM AAC ﬁles via FFmpeg. These have the
M4A (A for audio) ﬁle extension. M4P ﬁles are DRM encumbered. (No, it’s
not P for Pooey, but Protected.)
Creating ﬁles in AAC format in Audacity is easy: Select File > Export
> Save as type: M4A (AAC) Files (FFmpeg) and click the Options button.
In the Options dialog, you have a range of quality settings from 10 to 500,
with 500 being the highest quality. This range represents Fair, Okay, Good,
Better, and Best. The 256 setting is good for a more complex recording. A
very simple recording, such as one-voice spoken-word piece, sounds decent
at 50 (Figure 8-1).
Figure 8-1: Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes format) creates
a ﬁle with an .m4a extension.
Audacity supports many different MP3 options, and you can read all
about them in Chapter 7. Let’s review the ones that are most practical to
use. MP3 supports both constant bitrates and variable bitrates. Variable
bitrates deliver better quality. Your online distribution sites will have spe-
ciﬁc requirements, and with Audacity, you can easily tailor your tunes to
meet them.
The 128Kbps constant bitrate MP3 is the lowest common denomina-
tor in the United States. This will play on every digital audio player, and
some distributors require constant bitrate MP3s for streaming. In Audac-
ity, click File > Export > MP3 Files > Options > Constant > 128Kbits/sec.
152
Chapter 8

The Options dialog gives you a wide range of constant bitrates, from 8Kbps
to 320Kbps. Although 320Kbps is often touted as CD-quality, it isn’t. Your
own ears may tell you differently, but I can’t hear any improvement over
192Kbps.
NOTE
Some low-bandwidth carriers may require bitrates as low as 32Kbps for streaming In-
ternet audio. While this may not sound wonderful, it expands your potential audi-
ence. Half of Internet users in the United States are still on dial-up, and many other
countries still rely on predominantly low-bandwidth Internet services.
Your best Audacity options for variable bitrate MP3s are in the File >
Export > MP3 Files > Options > Variable dialog. Choose your desired qual-
ity setting, set Variable Speed: Standard and Channel Mode: Stereo (Fig-
ure 8-2). There are 10 bitrate options in this menu, from 45Kbps to 85Kbps
to 220Kbps to 260Kbps. I like 170Kbps to 210Kbps as a good level for music,
and I like 110Kbps to 150Kbps for simple spoken-word pieces. The Variable
Speed option limits the variable bitrate to a set range so you can get both
better quality and some predictability.
Figure 8-2: Using variable bitrate settings for MP3s in
Audacity
If your distributor supports it, you should also offer Ogg Vorbis ﬁles for
users who don’t care for MP3. They may prefer the higher quality of Ogg,
or they may using prefer open source, patent-unencumbered formats. Ogg
Vorbis can be streamed or downloaded just like MP3. It delivers high qual-
ity at low bitrates and supports multichannel surround, while MP3 supports
only one or two channels. MP3 is a closed, proprietary standard chock-full of
messy, confusing patent conﬂicts. I haven’t heard of any of the patent hold-
ers coming after anyone who uses an open source encoder like LAME, which
is the preferred MP3 encoder to use with Audacity, and I haven’t heard of
any small-time users getting in trouble for distributing their work in MP3
format. Just be aware that it is an issue for some of your fans, and there is a
possibility it could turn into a problem for you.
Audacity supports Ogg Vorbis, and it is easy to choose your quality
level. Go to File > Export > Ogg Vorbis Files > Options. You get a menu
with a little slider that lets you choose from 11 quality settings, from 0 to 10.
A value of 3 is roughly equivalent to a 128Kbps MP3. A value of 5 is pretty
Becoming an Online Star
153

nice for music, with one possible drawback: Ogg Vorbis uses channel cou-
pling for all levels up to 5. This means that redundancies between two stereo
channels are combined to save bandwidth, so you might notice a loss of
stereo imaging. Channel coupling is not used at levels 6 and up. I don’t per-
ceive any gain in going above 7, though your ears may tell you differently.
Ogg Vorbis support is growing fast, and a lot of playback devices support it
(Figure 8-3).
Figure 8-3: Exporting to Ogg Vorbis format
FLAC is a wonderful lossless, compressed format that gives WAV-quality
audio in a smaller ﬁle size. FLAC ﬁles are typically around a third smaller
than WAVs. FLACs are great for fans who play music from their computers
or have computer-based music servers, and an increasing number of music
players, both home and portable, support FLAC. FLAC cannot be streamed
but must be downloaded and then played.
Figure 8-4: FLAC supports both 16-
and 24-bit.
FLAC supports both 16- and 24-bit
depths and has nine compression levels,
from 0 to 8 (Figure 8-4). The default is 5,
and that is a good one to stick with, though
nobody will yell at you for experimenting
with the others. The different settings are
different levels of compression, with 0 be-
ing the least compression and 8 the most.
FLAC is lossless, so there is no difference in
quality, only in how small the ﬁles are com-
pressed. A value of 8 takes several times longer to encode than 5 with not
much additional beneﬁt. Decoding FLAC ﬁles that have been maximally
compressed doesn’t take any longer than ones that have been lightly com-
pressed, so the degree of compression won’t affect playback.
154
Chapter 8

WAV is the standard for high-quality uncompressed audio. File sizes
are large and cannot be streamed, but they are wonderful for your fans who
want a high-quality ﬁle that can easily be converted to other formats, such
as CD and lower-quality portable formats. And, of course, to enjoy for itself.
Go to File > Export > Other uncompressed ﬁles > Options. In the Uncom-
pressed Export Setup dialog (Figure 8-5), select Header: WAV (Microsoft),
and then choose your encoding. Select either Signed 16 bit PCM or Signed
24 bit PCM. 16-bit is CD quality, and 24-bit is DVD and studio master quality.
Select 24-bit only if your original recording is 24-bit or higher.
Figure 8-5: WAV settings should be either signed 16-bit or 24-bit.
Signed means positive integer, which we learned about in Chapter 1. You
want signed 16- or 24-bit integer because those are playable formats outside
of Audacity. 32-bit ﬂoat is an intermediate editing format used internally by
Audacity and other audio editors.
The Business of a Recording Artist
You’re becoming serious about distributing your own recordings. You’ve
heard all the horror stories about how artists are ripped off by the entertain-
ment industry and have memorized Courtney Love’s wonderful speech to
the Digital Hollywood online entertainment conference on May 16, 2000,
“Courtney Love Does the Math” (http://salon.com/technology/feature/2000/06/
14/love/):
Today I want to talk about piracy and music. What is piracy?
Piracy is the act of stealing an artist’s work without any intention of
paying for it. I’m not talking about Napster-type software.
I’m talking about major label recording contracts.
Becoming an Online Star
155

Frank Zappa and Janis Ian have also written or given talks in this vein,
which you should be able to ﬁnd online.
Or maybe you aren’t worried about possible unpleasant experiences
from signing with a major label, but you want to retain control of your own
destiny and your own work. You want to release recordings engineered to
your speciﬁcations and tailored for different uses, rather than dumbing ev-
erything down for the lowest common denominator. You want to work when
and where you feel like it and not have other people telling you what to do.
When someone actually wants to buy your work, you want to make it as easy
as possible and then keep the money. So, what do you do?
I can’t help you with attaining fame, glory, and groupies. Getting no-
ticed is still the hardest part. But I can point you to resources for online dis-
tribution and tell how to package your recordings for different uses such as
high-quality audiophile, lo-ﬁpromotional MP3s, streaming audio, and CDs.
Establishing an Online Presence
Distribution and promotion used to be the big hurdles for recording artists,
and that was why they needed to make deals with record companies. Now
distribution is easy, thanks to the Internet. An Internet distribution strat-
egy has two parts: your own personal website and as many music distribution
and broadcast sites as you can manage. Always have your own personal site
with photos, contact information, and links to where fans can hear and pur-
chase your music. This increases your search engine presence, and it makes
it easy for fans to ﬁnd you. Do please resist the urge to make this a typical
overproduced site full of special effects and animations and dark, barely
readable color schemes; this guarantees you will chase away your visitors.
Make it clean, simple, readable, and easy to navigate, because nobody cares
how self-indulgent your web designer is. They want to know about you and
how to hear your music, and they don’t want to jump through hoops to get
there.
You should have a consistent online identity. The ﬁrst step to building
your online identity is to register your own domain name. Don’t have an
email address or domain name that promotes someone else’s business, like
carlarockstar@gmail.com or guitarcarla@hotmail.com. Free email addresses
are seriously uncool anyway. Domain names are cheap, about $15 per year.
If you change web hosts and email service providers, your domain name
will always travel with you. Suppose you have a band—let’s say you’re The
Bandits—and your domain is http://thebandits.com/. Now you can do all kinds
of creative things with the domain name. Everyone in your band can have
their own email address, such as drummer@thebandits.com, diva@thebandits
.com, or rockgod@thebandits.com. No matter what music distributors, host-
ing services, or social networking sites you try, http://thebandits.com/ will al-
ways be there for your fans to ﬁnd you.
There are all kinds of domain name registrars such as Dotster, GoDaddy,
Register.com, Tucows, and many more. Most web hosting services also in-
clude domain name registration, but I would keep the two separate. Web
156
Chapter 8

hosting is a brutal business full of ﬂy-by-nights that come and go, and a bad
registrar can make it difﬁcult to transfer to another registrar, or you can
even lose your domain name. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) oversees domain names and maintains a list of ac-
credited registrars (http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/accredited-list.html). This
doesn’t guarantee that their customer service or prices are any good, just
that they are legitimate registrars. WebHostingTalk (http://www.webhostingtalk
.com/) is a great source of real-world information on hosting services and
registrars.
Think carefully about what kind of contact information to put on your
sites, because thanks to the magic of the Internet, communications can turn
into a deep time sink. If you don’t want to spend a lot of time answering
emails, Tweets, forum posts, and so on, then limit how people can reach
you. A web form protected by a captcha is a good way to allow fans to talk
to you without getting buried by spam. Captchas that use simple arithmetic
problems or multiple-choice questions (“If you are a human, click the pic-
ture of the puppy.”) are easy and effective. The kind that obscure text are
annoying and hard for everyone but spammers.
Who is a good web designer? Someone who listens to you; who can ex-
plain what they do in plain English (or language of your choice); and who
favors clean, fast, navigable site design over fancy show-off stuff that chases
your fans away. Always test your sites on a dial-up connection and on a smart-
phone. Broadband is far from universal, and mobile Internet use is explod-
ing, so you need to be tuned in to how your site looks and performs on slow
connections and on tiny screens.
NOTE
Remember to also factor in accessibility for vision-impaired fans. The United States has
an aging population, so it’s good business to welcome all of your fans, and accessible
design is good design for all visitors. If your website designer doesn’t want to bother
with making your site friendly to all visitors, look for a different designer.
Consider having a rented snail mailbox. It’s reliable, it weeds out the
casual stream-of-consciousness Twitter/email communiques, and it ensures
that anyone who really wants to talk to you can do so.
What about MySpace and Facebook? Go for it; they’re free, and you’ll
probably be pleasantly surprised at who ﬁnds you there. Budget some time
to keep them current. You don’t have to log in every day to have deep, mean-
ingful conversations with fans, but deﬁnitely make sure that links and infor-
mation about all of your recordings and performances are current. It takes
time to build a following, so be patient and read all of the helpful informa-
tion that tells you how to get the most beneﬁt out of MySpace and Facebook.
There are no fast, magic solutions, and you shouldn’t believe anyone who
tries to sell you some.
Never ever spam. Do not believe “marketers” who claim they sell gen-
uine guaranteed opt-in mail lists full of people who are happy to hear from
you. This is a lie. You should carefully build your own mailing lists. The right
way is to have a conﬁrmed opt-in, which means when someone signs up, they
have to respond to an email that is sent to conﬁrm their registration. Make
Becoming an Online Star
157

opting out easier than signing up; the lesson that marketers and spammers
refuse to learn is you can’t force people to like you.
Do be careful—there is no such thing as privacy online. Everything you
say is a public performance and recorded forever.
You’ll have to measure your own tolerance for texting, Twitter, and
whatever other newfangled communication tools come along. They can be
powerful and effective, and they can drive you crazy.
Online Music Distributors
Hooking up with an independent online music store that handles sales, gives
you a fair cut, and doesn’t try to glom your copyrights is no longer a fantasy,
and you have many to choose from. Here is a sampling of sites with different
approaches to distributing music and compensating artists.
Magnatune’s (http://www.magnatune.com/) motto is “We are not evil.”
They have another motto that I like better: “You get great music, musicians
get 50%.” That’s 50 percent of sales, not proﬁts. Magnatune distributes mu-
sic in several DRM-free formats: streaming only, which is like listening to
the radio, downloads in various formats, CD, and licenses for commercial
use. All music is try-before-you-buy, and customers can either select what
songs and albums they want to hear or listen to various streams. Magnatune
customers can also get a streaming membership for $15 per month, which
purchases unlimited listening and downloads with no commercials.
Magnatune supports MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis formats.
WAV and FLAC are the highest quality, and WAVs can be written to CDs.
128Kbps MP3s are the lowest quality and are licensed under Creative Com-
mons “Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike” license. This grants liberal
rights for noncommercial uses: sharing, remixes, sampling, and covers. Any
commercial use is expected to pay money. There is a lot of information on
the Magnatune website, and they have live humans to talk to.
You retain all copyrights to your own work and can make deals with
other distributors. Magnatune pays artists every six months, provided they
have earned at least $100.
CD Baby (http://www.cdbaby.com/) sells both DRM-free CDs and MP3
downloads and partners with a number of online stories like iTunes and
Amazon. It also does bulk CD duplication and artwork. CD Baby charges
a $35 setup fee per album; this covers digitizing the CD, converting tracks
into various formats, scanning the cover art, and doing other housekeeping
chores. You set your own CD pricing. CD Baby keeps $4 per disc and 25 per-
cent of download sales. Artists are paid weekly. Your CDs will be available
through a multitude of stores such as Borders and Amazon.
CD Baby offers a nice service for live shows—its Credit Card Swiper
Program. This is a credit/debit card terminal that you can take to shows
and set up on your merchandise table. CD Baby takes a 12.8 percent cut.
This sounds like a lot, but having your own merchant credit card account is
expensive. It will cost you a monthly fee whether you sell anything or not,
plus a percentage of every sale, usually around 2.5 to 3 percent per swiped
158
Chapter 8

transaction. If you sell your CDs on your merchandise tables, CD Baby takes
12.8 percent instead of the usual $4 cut.
CD Baby offers a number of other artist services such as Host Baby (web
hosting), stickers and cards, and a booking service.
eMusic (http://www.emusic.com/) is a well-regarded DRM-free MP3 on-
line music store that is a treasure trove of good indie bands and mainstream
popular music. However, they don’t accept just anyone; they work with es-
tablished music labels, so you need to already be signed on with someone.
eMusic is all corporate and lawyerly and full of bureaucracy. It’s probably a
better deal for music fans than for little-known musicians, though it never
hurts to check it out.
TuneCore (http://www.tunecore.com/) has a ﬂat-rate system. You pay
$9.99 per song plus a $9.99 annual maintenance fee, or $49.99 per album
the ﬁrst year and $19.98 for each year thereafter, plus $19.98 annual mainte-
nance. This gets you into 19 online stores including Amazon MP3, eMusic,
Rhapsody, and Spotify. They also have an Amazon: Disc On Demand op-
tion for selling CDs. There is a two-month lag on sales reporting from most
stores, and TuneCore reports twice per month. After that, you can withdraw
your funds any time. (It requires a PayPal account.)
iTunes (http://www.apple.com/itunes/content-providers/faq.html) is the big
show. There are signiﬁcant hoops to jump through, but nothing ventured,
nothing gained. CD Baby, TuneCore, and SongCast all partner with iTunes,
which is easier than applying directly to iTunes.
The Independent Online Distribution Alliance (IODA) (http://www
.iodalliance.com/) acts as a collective agent and aggregator, using the power
of collective bargaining to give independents a stronger business voice. In
return for a percentage of artists’ royalties, it handles rate negotiations, re-
porting, distribution of works, distribution of royalties, and other grotty but
necessary business chores.
Independent online distribution is a growing business, and you can
ﬁnd many more distribution sites. Promotion is up to you, though every
site provides useful tools and advice to help you. Don’t be a typical clueless
artist and sign your life away or hook up with some rip-off artist. Research-
ing distributors is as easy as sitting down at your computer and doing some
web searches. Don’t forget the gnarly business of taxes and reading the
ﬁne print. When will you get paid? How can you verify sales and payment
records? Copyrights, DRM, closing your account, making changes, getting
help from real live humans, and dispute resolution are all important things
to look at.
Consider choosing distributors by genre, rather than popularity. Sure,
iTunes and Amazon are the big gorillas, but if your niche is sophisticated
jazz, dance music, world music, or some such, look for a distributor that spe-
cializes in your type of music.
It is good to maintain a professional, businesslike approach and remem-
ber mundane details such as keeping your word; contact information; cor-
rect spelling, grammar and punctuation; readable fonts; and nice-looking
artwork. Nobody cares how much you artistically suffer.
Becoming an Online Star

Self-Hosting
Another option is to self-host, which means running your own servers. These
here modern times are not like the olden days of Bulletin Board Services
(BBS) when thousands of people ran their own BBS servers from PCs in
their bedrooms. Maintaining a website, hosting your own downloads, and
offering streams of your work are all feasible for the do-it-yourselfer but
are not for the faint of heart or the technophobe. Bandwidth is the big-
gest problem: If you want to house your servers in your home, ﬁrst ﬁnd out
whether you can get adequate bandwidth for a reasonable price and whether
your Internet service provider will even allow you to run servers. Then you
are responsible for your own security, software, hardware, and system and
network administration. It is satisfying to be the boss of your own servers, but
it does require a lot of skills.
A better option is to use a good hosting service that has all the tools you
need and gives you a good deal on bandwidth. It’s hard to beat a good host-
ing service on bandwidth cost, since they buy in bulk and spread the cost
over many customers. Then the hosting service handles hardware prob-
lems, Internet connectivity, security, and backup power. Plans range from
free for a basic low-trafﬁc site to inexpensive shared hosting (which means
one server with a limited amount of Internet bandwidth serves many cus-
tomers) to paying for your own dedicated, unshared server. You can get
started cheaply and upgrade as you become more successful.
NOTE
Remember WebHosting Talk (http://www.webhostingtalk.com/) for learning
which hosts are good and which ones to avoid.
The free/open source software world has everything you need for run-
ning your own websites. Use the Linux operating system because it is robust
and secure. Then there are bales of great servers to choose from:
•
Drupal, Joomla, Mambo, and Plone are all examples of excellent open
source content management systems (CMS). These are the frameworks
for the content that you want to put on your site so you can easily orga-
nize and post articles, photos, calendars, news, forums, and links.
•
Icecast and Campcaster are excellent open source streaming Ogg Vorbis
and MP3 servers that you can embed on your website.
•
Shoutcast is a closed, proprietary streaming server, and Shoutcast Radio
is a fast and free Internet broadcast service for hosting your streams. You
can also embed Shoutcast streams in your other sites.
Many web hosting services offer Icecast and Shoutcast streaming and, of
course, many other streaming media servers. Any hosting service offers a big
bundle of server software and a nice graphical control panel for everything.
If they don’t have a particular piece of software, ask whether they will install
it, and if the software is free-of-cost open source, they probably will. Most
hosting services rely heavily on open source software because it is free or
inexpensive and because it is good.

Selling Stuff Online
Selling things online can be as simple as having a website and a PayPal ac-
count for accepting payments or a mailing address for checks and money or-
ders. Check and money order fraud are rampant to the point that it may not
be worth accepting either one. PayPal is easy and popular; just be sure you
understand its fee structure so you don’t get surprised at the myriad ways it
nibbles away chunks of your money. Google Checkout has lower fees than
PayPal and doesn’t have PayPal’s reputation for inconsistent, unfair dispute
resolution. You can use both, which will capture more customers since many
of them will not want to sign up for one when they already have an account
at the other.
Processing online credit card payments requires a sophisticated infra-
structure. You don’t want to be one of those shops that makes headlines
when some teenager hacks your customer database and steals all the infor-
mation. Consider using a prefab storefront that has all the payment process-
ing already in place. Start at Amazon.com (http://www.amazonservices.com/
content/sell-on-amazon.htm); it is reputable and reliable, and it posts all of its
prices and policies, so it’s a good starting point for research and compar-
isons. Amazon does not directly sell independent music but partners with
music distributors like CD Baby and TuneCore. Having an Amazon store-
front might be a good venue for your band swag and getting more visibility
and another way to generate CD orders.
You can avoid payment hassles by hosting only free downloads and stream-
ing on your personal site and then linking to your wares on CD Baby, Song-
cast, or whatever distributors you are hooked up with.
The one piece that almost everyone forgets is customer service. How
are customers going to contact you when they have questions or problems,
phone? Email? Who is going to respond, and can you count on them to re-
spond quickly and in a way that keeps customers happy? If you are selling
physical items like CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, and other branded merchandise,
who is going to pack and ship them and how fast? Customer service is ev-
erything. It costs at least ten times more to acquire a new customer than to
keep an existing customer happy, no matter how great your artistic genius.
To DRM or Not to DRM?
Digital rights management (DRM), or as some prefer to call it, digital restric-
tions management, means copy protection, and the various technologies
designed to prevent illegal copying. The concept might sound good, since
the idea of people copying your music for free sounds like a rip-off. But in
practice it’s a nightmare. It doesn’t even slow down big-time pirates who re-
produce and sell thousands of copies of movies and music CDs. It doesn’t
stop the clever kids who want something for nothing. It mainly gets in the
way of legitimate paying customers.
It adds an intolerable overhead burden to online distribution, because
this requires always-available authentication servers. Already this is falling
apart after just a few years. Wal-Mart announced in September 2008 that it
Becoming an Online Star
161

was going to shut down its DRM authentication servers, which meant that
customers would not be able to play their DRM-“protected” music that they
had purchased if they tried to move it to a different machine or restore from
a system failure. Wal-Mart’s remedy was for customers to copy their DRM-
“protected” tracks to CDs, which would then play anywhere. There was such
an outcry that they changed their plans and still maintain their DRM servers.
Even though they have moved to DRM-free distribution, that old DRM bag-
gage is going to haunt them for a long time.
Apple’s iTunes store went DRM-free in February 2008, and existing
DRM-protected ﬁles can be converted to DRM-free versions for 30 cents per
song or 30 percent of the album price. (Thank you for the opportunity to
pay twice.) Yahoo! and Rhapsody have also moved away from DRM. Amazon
and EMI moved in and captured a dominant chunk of the music market by
offering DRM-free tracks from the beginning.
There are a sizable number of doofy DRM schemes that make me
wonder why some people get paychecks for coming up with these brain-
storms, while we sensible people have to scramble for our daily bread. Sony
BMG got busted not once but twice for sneakily installing cloaked rootkits
on Windows computers from “protected” music CDs. Not only was this a
trespass that would have been criminally prosecuted if it were some kid in-
stead of a globalcorp, it opened big security holes in these computers. Other
brilliant DRM ideas that went over like lead balloons were time-bombed mu-
sic tracks that became unplayable after a certain number of days, attempts to
count and limit the numbers of copies that could be made, and downloads
that became unplayable when subscriptions expired. All of these depend on
some kind of central authorization and control, which to my way of think-
ing requires unwarranted intrusions into our personal business and a level
of reliability that few service providers can sustain. I have vinyl LPs that are
older than me—how long do you think digital tracks will survive even with-
out DRM monkeyshines? I can’t fathom the mind-set that can come up with
these sort of hostile, self-defeating Big Brother tactics.
On the other hand, having your work poached is no good either. Re-
cording artists have a right to get paid for their recorded works; I don’t think
much of the folks who say, “Give your recordings away and earn money giv-
ing live performances.” Apparently they have never performed or created a
good recording. I don’t have any wisdom to offer except to treat your paying
customers as well as you can. In real life, and not the bizarro world inhab-
ited by the entertainment industry barons, most people will treat you fairly if
you treat them fairly and do the right thing because it’s the right thing, not
because they are forced to.
Copyrights and Legal Issues
Copyright law is in a seriously weird place right now in the United States and
some other countries as well. The rights of copyright owners keep getting
extended, while fair use is taking a beating, and minor infringements are
escalated into major crimes. Creators are pushed out as the rights holders to
162
Chapter 8

their own works, though that is an old, chronic problem. As Courtney Love
said in “Courtney Love Does the Math”:
. . . a congressional aide named Mitch Glazier, with the sup-
port of the RIAA, added a “technical amendment” to a bill that
deﬁned recorded music as "works for hire" under the 1978 Copy-
right Act.
He did this after all the hearings on the bill were over. By the
time artists found out about the change, it was too late. The bill
was on its way to the White House for the president’s signature.
That subtle change in copyright law will add billions of dol-
lars to record company bank accounts over the next few years—
billions of dollars that rightfully should have been paid to artists. A
“work for hire” is now owned in perpetuity by the record company.
Under the 1978 Copyright Act, artists could reclaim the
copyrights on their work after 35 years. If you wrote and recorded
“Everybody Hurts,” you at least got it back to as a family legacy
after 35 years. But now, because of this corrupt little pisher, “Ev-
erybody Hurts” never gets returned to your family, and can now be
sold to the highest bidder.
. . . By the way, which bill do you think the recording indus-
try used for this amendment? . . . How about the Satellite Home
Viewing Act of 1999?
That charming little provision was overturned retroactively in The Work
Made for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000. But you see what
you’re up against. One way to take matters into your own hands is to release
your works under a Creative Commons license. There are several of them,
and you can read all about them at http://www.creativecommons.org/. These
allow you to deﬁne different degrees of permissions for reuse and distribu-
tion, from permissive to restrictive. When you look for legal advice, be sure
that you ﬁnd an attorney who is well versed in all aspects of copyright law,
including Creative Commons.
Note that I said, “when you look for legal advice,” not “if.” The Internet
is already full of nonlawyers trading legal advice, so do yourself a favor and
ﬁnd a real lawyer to advise you. You can ﬁnd all kinds of information online
and at the library, and then when you meet with an attorney, you’ll be well
prepared. Unfortunately, this is a necessary part of being an artist in these
modern times. You can live on beans and rice, you can patch old clothes,
and you can drive an old car held together with wire and tape. But undo-
ing legal messes is difﬁcult, expensive, and often not possible; prevention is
much cheaper and considerably less stressful.

MULTITRACK RECORDING
Editing and mixing multiple tracks is a
whole lot easier in the digital realm than it
is in the analog world. No waiting for tapes
to rewind, no physically cutting and pasting
tapes—it’s all just pointy-clicky bit shufﬂing. Although
Audacity isn’t the most sophisticated application for
heavy-duty multitrack recording and editing, you can
make excellent mono and stereo recordings with it
and even 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound. It’s the real
deal, with discrete tracks.
NOTE
That’s discrete as in separate, not discreet as in able to keep a secret. Discrete is an
important term in audio because it tells you when you’re getting the real deal, and not
something simulated. For example, a surround sound hi-ﬁsystem will emulate 5.1
sound from a stereo recording, which has only two discrete channels. Real 5.1 has six
discrete channels.

What is Audacity missing? It doesn’t have per-track recording level me-
ters, and you can’t make edits while tracks are playing. When you’re using a
multichannel recording device, you can’t control which input goes to which
track. Multichannel surround mixing is still rather rudimentary: You can
export to 5.1 and 7.1 surround, but Audacity gives you no help mapping
the channels. Audacity’s strengths lie in recording, editing, and mixing for
mono and stereo playback. Ardour might be a better choice for Linux and
Mac users who want to perform heavy-duty studio wizardry, perform multi-
channel surround, and have maximum control, and of course Windows and
Mac users have great thundering herds of other high-end audio production
suites to choose from.
So, what can Audacity do? It will record as many channels at one
time as your recording interface supports and your computer can handle.
Some examples of multichannel recording interfaces are the M-Audio Delta
1010 PCI sound card (10 × 10), the Edirol FA-101 FireWire audio interface
(10 × 10), the RME Hammerfall sound cards, and the M-Audio NRV10,
which is a useful combination of an analog mixer and 10-channel FireWire
DAC/ADC.
Audacity has no hard limit for the total number of tracks in a project;
you can keep adding tracks until your computer keels over. Audacity sup-
ports all of the basic multitrack editing and mixing functions: mix and match
clips, time-shift and synchronize, layer multiple copies of the same track or
clip, do ﬁx-its and special effects, and mixdown to any number of channels
from 1 to 32 (WAV, AIFF, and Ogg Vorbis; other ﬁle formats support fewer
channels). In real life, mono, stereo, and 5.1 surround (6 channel) are your
likeliest options.
Tracks, Channels, and Clips
Let’s take a moment to be sure of our terminology. A single track in Audac-
ity is represented by a single waveform, as in Figure 9-1. I call this a mono
track to make it clear that it’s not a stereo track. However, the deﬁnition
of track is a bit fuzzy in audio and also in Audacity because it treats a stereo
track the same way it treats a mono track—even though there are two chan-
nels with two different waveforms, Audacity sees a stereo track as one track,
and everything you do to it is applied equally to both channels. A track is
also a single song in a track, CD, LP, or tape that contains several songs.
Figure 9-1: This is what a single mono track looks like—one waveform, no
matter how many voices or instruments are recorded on the track.
166
Chapter 9

Channel refers to audio inputs and outputs. When you record using a
single mono microphone, that is a single input channel even if you have
an entire orchestra playing and choir singing. Multichannel recording
interfaces let you use more microphones and instrument plug-ins, which
creates more tracks.
NOTE
The number of input channels in Edit > Preferences > Devices must match the num-
ber of your physical input channels.
You get the ultimate ﬂexibility and control by giving every voice and
instrument its own mic. Studio recording is nothing like live recording—
sometimes every performer is in a separate soundproof cubicle, or recorded
at different times and different locations, so the various band members might
never even be physically present at the same time. It’s a common practice
to use multiple mics on a single performer and then manipulate the result-
ing multiple tracks to create absolute perfect wonderfulness (or an overpro-
duced glop, as the case may be).
Be careful with the physical recording inputs that you plug your mics
and instruments into—some are mono, some will be stereo, some will re-
quire phantom power, and others will be for various other purposes. Be
sure you’re plugging things in correctly—just because it ﬁts doesn’t mean
it’s right.
NOTE
A good habit to develop is to never hotplug anything, unless you are certain it is safe
to do so. Don’t turn on phantom power until after your condenser mics are plugged
in. Don’t plug anything into your amp, preamp, mixer, and so on with the power on,
or at least make sure all volume controls are at zero. Turn power off before unplug-
ging. Most audio equipment is tolerant of a certain amount of abuse. But pops from
hotplugging are annoying and may damage your equipment.
If you use a stereo mic on a mono recording input, only one channel
will record, and you’ll have a stereo track like the one in Figure 9-2 with one
channel blank.
Figure 9-2: This is what happens when you plug a stereo micro-
phone into a single-channel recording input.
No worries if this happens to you; just use the Track menu to separate a
stereo track into two tracks, and then delete the empty one. There are two
split track options: Split Stereo Track creates a left and a right track, while
Multitrack Recording
167

Split Stereo to Mono creates two mono tracks. (You can use this same menu
to join two individual tracks into a single stereo track.) Assigning a track
left, right, or mono is important when you mixdown to stereo: Left tracks
go to the left channel, right tracks go to the right channel, and mono goes
to both. (See “Mixdown to Stereo” on page 188 to learn more.)
Low-end onboard sound chips are notorious for claiming to have stereo
microphone inputs, but then only one channel works. If you try a mono mi-
crophone on one of these, it may not work at all, so I can’t resist giving the
obvious warning: Test it before you need it.
NOTE
See Chapter 2 for a refresher on setting up audio hardware, and consult your product
documentation. Beware anyone who wants to “help” you! It’s your gear, and you don’t
want the help of people who don’t know what they’re doing, which is quite a large
number of folks who think they’re experts (such as professional musicians who have
been on stage all their lives and rely on the old “whack it until something happens”
technique). Your peace of mind and equipment are more important than their egos.
Output channels are like input channels. If you create a 5.1 surround
mix that is six discrete channels—left, right, center, surround left, surround
right, and low-frequency effects (LFE)—you could take a single mono track
and export it to 5.1 surround, as Figure 9-3 shows. I don’t know why you
would want to, but it’s there if you do. Audacity supports a maximum of 32
output channels. If you have a playback device that supports 32 channels,
you will have yourself one heck of a fun time. A more realistic option for all
those channels is to export them to a single 32-bit WAV ﬁle, or 32 individ-
ual WAV ﬁles (using File > Export Multiple), and then import them into a
more sophisticated mixing application for advanced mixing and studio wiz-
ardry. For example, some users like to record and edit in Audacity and then
do the ﬁnal mix in a different program that does things Audacity doesn’t
do, such as support MIDI, or that has more sophisticated multitrack mixing.
Since Audacity is free, it doesn’t cost anything but some time to try different
workﬂows.
Clips are segments of tracks. You can have a lot of fun with clips, such as
changing what a person says in an interview by moving the words around,
making loops, or grabbing clips from different recordings and blending
them together in new and different ways. You can have several clips in a sin-
gle track or put each one in its own track. You can even drag clips from one
track to another using the Time Shift tool (Figure 9-4).
How to Make Multitrack Recordings
There are several ways to make multitrack recordings. One way is to use a
multichannel recording interface and record all of your tracks at one time.
Another way is to record new tracks at different times into an existing project;
this is called overdubbing. Another way to manage a multitrack project is to
run multiple recording sessions, each in its own Audacity project, and then
copy tracks from these into a single Audacity project.

Multitrack Recording
169

For recording larger numbers of tracks at once, I have a Focusrite Saf-
ﬁre Pro 26, which is an excellent multichannel FireWire recording inter-
face. It has eight microphone preamps, phantom power, two ADAT banks
(16 channels), S/PDIF, 24/192 digital I/O, and a lot of other goodies. Fig-
ure 9-5 shows a four-channel recording session in Audacity using the Safﬁre.
As you can see, it doesn’t look special: It’s just four channels all recording at
the same time. The Safﬁre can theoretically handle 26 recording inputs at
one time, which Audacity can handle with no problem; the only limitation is
what my computer can handle. (Audacity versions before 1.3.8 are limited to
16 inputs at once.)
Figure 9-5: Recording four tracks at one time with the Focusrite
Safﬁre Pro
My little M-Audio MobilePre USB can record four inputs at once. How-
ever, it is really a stereo recording interface with only two discrete input and
output channels. So recording four inputs means that two are combined on
each channel, and instead of four tracks that can be manipulated individ-
ually, there are only two. This once again illustrates that in the great wide
world of audio, there are many ways to do things.
Many higher-end sound cards and recording interfaces are designed to
be combined, and then they appear to Audacity as a single interface. Au-
dacity does not have the ability to combine multiple recording interfaces; it
must see a single device with multiple channels. Windows and Mac users get
special drivers and management software to do this. With luck you can com-
bine lower-end sound cards as well. However, in my experience, combining
cheapo sound cards is painful and unreliable on any platform, so I’m going
to pretend that such an option does not exist.
NOTE
Remember that Audacity supports almost unlimited undos and redos, so you can ex-
periment safely. Undo changes with CTRL-Z or Edit > Undo and redo with CTRL-
SHIFT-Z or Edit > Redo.
When you want to add audio ﬁles such as WAV or FLAC to your pro-
ject, import them into your Audacity project with File > Import > Audio.
170
Chapter 9

File > Open launches a new Audacity session, and File > Import > Audio
opens an audio ﬁle into the current project. You can’t import an Audac-
ity project into another Audacity project, but you can open two or more
projects and copy tracks between them.
Figure 9-6: Track
menu
Get well-acquainted with the Track menu (Fig-
ure 9-6) because you will use this a lot.
There are a number of items to note here. You can
split a stereo track using the Track Menu; click Split
Stereo Track/Split Stereo to Mono. Then, for your own
sanity, give each track a descriptive name.
You can join two mono tracks to make a stereo track.
They have to be adjacent to each other, and you have
to select Make Stereo Track from the uppermost track’s
Track menu. Then Audacity will automatically join it to
the next track below. If the tracks are not together, select
Move Track Up/Down from the Track menu or drag one
with the mouse by grabbing it on the track label. (See
Chapter 1 if you don’t remember what all the Audacity
parts are called.)
Playback Tips and Tricks
As you recall from diligent study of Chapter 1, by default Audacity plays all
tracks at once when you press the playback button. Pressing the spacebar
also starts playback. To listen to one track, click Solo in the Track menu. To
listen to some tracks but not all, click the Mute button on the ones you don’t
want to hear. CTRL-U mutes all tracks, and SHIFT-CTRL-U unmutes all tracks.
Position the cursor on the Time Scale at any starting point you want; when it
changes to a little hand, click to start playback at that point. You can skip all
over your track this way without using the Stop/Play buttons.
Figure 9-7: Play back a
selection by creating a
play region on the Time
Scale.
You can quickly play a selected part of a track
by creating a play region by clicking and dragging in
the Time Scale to mark the section you want to play
(Figure 9-7). This plays immediately, and then the
play region disappears.
You can create a persistent selection by selecting
part of the track in the usual way, by clicking and
dragging with the Selection tool. Then click the Play
button to play only that selection, or click SHIFT-Play
to loop-play the selection. Press CTRL-B to create
a region label for the selection (see “Creating and
Managing Labels” on page 173 to learn more about region labels). Press C
(for cut) to hear a preview of what the track will sound like with the selected
part cut out. The default length of the lead-in and lead-out to the cut is one
second; you can change this in Edit > Preferences > Playback.
Multitrack Recording
171

A fast way to play part of a track is to click to mark a stopping point, po-
sition the cursor to the left of the mark (don’t click, just hover) and press B.
Playback will start where the cursor is positioned and stop at your mark. You
can go the other way and place the cursor to the right of your mark, then
press B, and it will play from the selection to the cursor.
Label Tracks
Label tracks are useful for keeping track of what’s happening on your project
tracks. You might remember labels from Chapter 3, where they were used to
divide long tracks copied from vinyl LPs into individual song tracks. When
you’re editing multiple tracks, you can also use them for bookmarks and
notes and to create alignment markers. Each audio track can have its own
label track (Figure 9-8). New label tracks are created by selecting Tracks
> Add New > Label Track. Position label tracks by grabbing the track la-
bel with the cursor and dragging them or by using the Track Menu’s Move
Track Up/Down selection.
Figure 9-8: You may use as many label tracks as you like.
If you depend on label tracks, then you need to take extra care with
backing up your Audacity projects, because they exist only inside Audacity.
Label tracks can be exported and imported just like audio tracks, but unfor-
tunately (as of Audacity 1.3.12), you cannot export multiple label tracks. If
you try to export multiple label tracks (File > Export Labels), they will be
merged into a single text ﬁle, and at import you’ll get a single label track
containing all the labels from all the tracks.
You can place a label track at the very top and use this like a conductor’s
score, with notes and timing marks for the whole project.

Chapter 9

Creating and Managing Labels
Figure 9-9: Point labels mark a single point
on a track, and region labels mark a section.
There are two types of labels: point
labels and region labels. In Chapters
3, 4, and 5, we used point labels to
divide long tracks into individual
songs. Region labels mark a selec-
tion, as Figure 9-9 shows.
Point labels are easy to create.
Stop playback, click in your track
with the Selection tool wherever
you want a new label, and then
press CTRL-B. Type in your label name or whatever text you want, and hit
RETURN. You can also select Tracks > Add Label At Selection. To delete a
label, backspace over the label text until it disappears.
Press CTRL-M to add labels during playback; this is one of the few Audac-
ity functions that doesn’t require stopping everything ﬁrst. When you have
multiple label tracks, remember to ﬁrst select the one you want the new la-
bel in. (Click its track label to select it.)
Take a look at the little handles on the labels, the angles, and the circle.
Grab the circle to move the label. Drag the angle handles to make or resize
a region label. Change a region label to a point label by dragging an angle
handle until all the handles merge.
You can create region labels in several ways. One way is to select part
of your audio track and then select Tracks > Add Label At Selection (or just
press CTRL-B). Another way is to stretch out a point label by dragging its an-
gle handle. The little angle and circle change how they behave when you
have adjoining region labels. The little circle handle creates and moves a
common border, and common borders are separated with the angle handles
(Figure 9-10).
Figure 9-10: Circle handles move the whole label, and angle handles create
and resize region labels. You can join region label borders and then move
the border with the circle handle, and you can separate them with the angle
handles.
Press the TAB key to navigate forward through your bookmarks, and
SHIFT-TAB to go backward. Select Tracks > Edit Labels to edit and reorder
them quickly. Labels are numbered to show which label track they belong to
(Figure 9-11).
Multitrack Recording
173

Figure 9-11: Selecting Tracks > Edit Labels puts all your labels in one place for
easy editing and reordering. Note how the labels are numbered according to their
label tracks, 1, 2, and 3.
Using Labels to Edit Multiple Tracks
You can use labels to mark points or segments across multiple tracks. Sup-
pose you want to delete a 10-second chunk across two audio tracks. Mark
this with a region label, and then click inside the label text (Figure 9-12).
Figure 9-12: Using
a region label
to select track
segments across
multiple tracks
This turns the label text ﬁeld white and selects a 10-
second segment in all tracks above the label track, includ-
ing other label tracks. If this includes tracks you don’t
want affected, deselect the extra tracks (SHIFT-click the
track labels). Press CTRL-X or select Edit > Cut, and the
selections will vanish. You can use this for any editing
function across multiple tracks. You can move the se-
lection or change its size simply by changing the region
label.
It’s not required to use region labels for operations
like these, because you can use the Selection tool to make
selections across multiple tracks. The keyboard works too,
using the up- and down-arrow keys to move the cursor
and using the SHIFT and arrow keys to size selections.

Chapter 9

Aligning and Moving Tracks
There are many ways to move tracks around, both in time and in track or-
der. Audacity has several good tools for moving and aligning your tracks.
One way to move tracks backward and forward in time is by using the
Time Shift tool (Figure 9-13). The Time Shift tool moves an entire track for-
ward or backward in time.
It couldn’t be easier: Just click, hold down the mouse button, and drag
the waveform left or right. You can even drag past the beginning of the track
and move forward in time, which is indicated by little arrows in the track as
in Figure 9-14. This is nondestructive, and you can drag it back out again.
Figure 9-13:
Selecting the
Time Shift tool
Figure 9-14: When you time-shift
beyond the beginning of the track,
two little arrows appear.
When you are time-shifting tracks and they become perfectly aligned
with other tracks, or are exactly aligned with starting at zero, Audacity dis-
plays a vertical yellow line. Audacity calls this a Snap Guide. If there are mul-
tiple boundaries and they are too close together, the Snap Guide will get
confused and not work. Zoom in to give it some elbow room.
As long as a track is a single unbroken waveform, the Time Shift tool
moves the whole waveform. To divide a track into independent segments,
click with the Selection tool to mark where you want to split it, and then se-
lect Edit > Split (or press CTRL-I). The selection line turns white, and now
you have two segments that you can time-shift independently.
NOTE
If Link Tracks is enabled, tracks with label tracks will not split. Disable Link Tracks to
change this.
To rejoin split tracks, time-shift the segments back together. The yellow
Snap Guide line will appear when they are touching. Then change to the
Selection tool, make a selection spanning the join, and select Edit > Join or
press CTRL-J. If there is a gap, selecting Edit > Join will ﬁll it with silence.
Take a look in the Tracks > Align Tracks menu for a treasure trove of
useful track alignment commands. Suppose you have been time-shifting
multiple tracks and they’re all over the place, so you want to reset everything
and start over. Select the tracks you want to line up, select Tracks > Align
Tracks > Align Tracks Together, and then select Tracks > Align Tracks >
Align Tracks with Zero. Poof! Everything is reset to start at zero.
NOTE
Don’t include label tracks because they always start at zero, so this will prevent audio
tracks with any offset from aligning to zero. Deselect label tracks by SHIFT-clicking in
their track labels.
Multitrack Recording
175

Align with Cursor is a fast way to shift a track by a precise amount. Here’s
how it works: Let’s say you want to insert a time offset of 10 seconds at the
beginning of your track. Click at the 10-second point to mark it, and then se-
lect Tracks > Align Tracks > Align with Cursor to move the start of the track
to that point. Align End with Cursor lines up the end of the track with the
cursor.
Align with Selection Start and Align with Selection End are similar to
Align with Cursor, except the track is moved relative to a selection. For ex-
ample, if you have a selection spanning the 5- to 10- seconds segment, Align
with Selection End positions the track to begin at the 10-second mark. Align
with Selection Start moves it the other way so that it starts at the 5-second
mark.
Align End with Selection Start/End work the same way, except they are
relative to the end of the track.
A slick trick with labels is to create an alignment point when you have to
time-shift multiple tracks. Use a point label for this: Create your point label,
Figure 9-15: Tracks 1,
2, and 4 have been
selected.
click the label text, and a line will extend from the la-
bel into all tracks above it. Use the Time Shift tool,
and the yellow Snap Guide will appear when the be-
ginning or end of the track (or tracks) is perfectly
aligned with your point label.
Track alignment can be also made without la-
bels at any arbitrary point on the Time Scale. Using
the Selection tool, click anywhere in a single track
to mark your alignment point, and then extend the
cursor up or down into the other tracks by selecting
them (SHIFT-click in the track labels). SHIFT-click also
unselects. You can select arbitrary tracks using this
method, as Figure 9-15 shows. Then use the Time
Shift tool to line up against the cursor mark or select

A new (and sometimes confusing) feature that appeared in Audacity 1.3.9 is
the Link Tracks button (Edit toolbar). This should be activated (depressed)
by default; this keeps label tracks aligned with audio tracks through time
shifts, tempo changes, cuts, pastes, and other changes. You can turn off Link
Tracks when it gets in your way by clicking (raising) the Link Tracks button
or selecting Tracks > Link Audio and Label Tracks and unchecking the box.
Label tracks are linked to the audio track or tracks immediately above
them, until there is another label track; these are called track groups. Create
a new label track with Tracks > Add New > Label Track. It will appear at
the bottom of the existing tracks, and you can move it by grabbing the track
label and dragging it or by selecting Move Track Up/Down from the Track
menu. You can insert blank label tracks to separate track groups from other
tracks.
176
Chapter 9

When you use the Time Shift tool in a track group, every track in the
group moves as a unit. When you delete part of one track, a corresponding
segment is deleted from every track in the group. When you paste a segment
of audio into one track, the other tracks receive a corresponding length of
silence. When you use Effect > Change Speed and Change Tempo, the ef-
fects are applied to all tracks in the group. Labels are kept in sync through
all these changes.
NOTE
Link Tracks may not be enabled in the Audacity 2.0.x series. They ﬁrst appeared in
Audacity 1.3.9 and should return in the Audacity 2.1.x beta series. Their behavior
may change, so check your Audacity release notes.
Time-Shifting Multiple Tracks at the Same Time
What if you want to time-shift multiple tracks the same amount, all at the
same time? SHIFT-click the track labels to select the tracks you want to time-
shift, or press CTRL-A to select all of them and then use the Time Shift tool
to move them (Figure 9-16).
Figure 9-16: Time-shifting multiple selected tracks. Note that the selected tracks (1 and 3)
are darkened.
If your Audacity version includes the Link Tracks feature, disable it, or
time-shifting the tracks won’t work right.

Splitting Tracks
Splitting tracks is how you break a long track into independent clips that you
can move around as you need. Sometimes you need to move a section a sec-
ond or two to match it up to the other tracks or to separate two people talk-
ing at the same time. Sometimes you want to split a track into a bunch of
short clips. To create clips, position the Selection tool where you want to
make the split, and then press Edit > Split. Now you have two clips and can
use the Time Shift tool to move them around.
Figure 9-17: Selecting Edit > Split
New creates a new track with the cut
segment.
Select Edit > Split Cut to cut a se-
lected portion of a track and leave a gap
so the track length is unchanged. The
cut portion is placed on the clipboard
and can be pasted (CTRL-V or Edit >
Paste) into another location.
Selecting Edit > Split Delete deletes
the selected portion.
Selecting Edit > Split New creates a
new track and moves the cut portion to it
(Figure 9-17).
Working with Clips
If you’re working with short clips, rather than the long tracks we’ve seen
so far, it looks like Figure 9-4. You can have multiple separate clips on the
same track. Each one can be time-shifted independently and even dragged
to other tracks with the Time Shift tool. You can perform edits on the indi-
vidual clips, such as changing the amplitude, applying effects, removing or
pasting in additional material, and ﬁxing defects. The one thing you can-
not do is control the channel mapping when exporting individual clips that
share the same track because this is done per track, so any clips you want to
control this way need to be on their own tracks.
Figure 9-18:
Audacity’s
Snap Guide
feature
Audacity’s Snap Guide feature is helpful when you want to
select a clip precisely, because you’ll see the yellow lines appear
when you are exactly on its borders (Figure 9-18).
Selecting multiple clips is a bit tricky. Press CTRL-A to se-
lect all tracks. To move a selected batch of clips, ﬁrst use the
Selection tool to mark out a segment on the time line that
crosses all the clips you want to move. Then use SHIFT-click
in the Track panels to select tracks, and then use the Time
Shift tool to move them. It’s rather clunky, and you can’t skip
around and select an arbitrary batch of clips (Figure 9-19).
178
Chapter 9

Figure 9-19: You can only select clips in a common region on the timeline. In
this example, the clips with the darkened areas in the ﬁrst three tracks will all
time-shift together.
Time-Shifting Inside Tracks
The Time Shift tool is good for moving an entire audio segment forward or
backward in time, but what if you want to insert a break in the middle of a
track or time-shift a portion of a track? Audacity has a number of different
ways to do this. My favorite method for creating a break or padding a track
is to select Generate > Silence. This avoids splitting the track or deleting
anything; all it does is insert a period of absolute silence of whatever dura-
tion you want. Position the Selection tool where you want the silence to start,
select Generate > Silence, enter the duration of the silence, and click OK
(Figure 9-20).
Figure 9-20: Generating
silence
Multitrack Recording
179

Figure 9-21: Audacity gives you a lot
of different values to choose from for
the duration of your silences.
As Figure 9-21 shows, you have mul-
tiple options for timing the length of the
silence: hours, seconds, milliseconds,
and various frame rates, which I’ll ex-
plain in the next section.
Days, hours, seconds, and millisec-
onds are straightforward, and I admire
anyone who is working with audio ﬁles
with durations measured in days. Samples
displays the number of audio samples
according to your project’s sampling
rate; for example, when your project’s
sampling rate is 44,100 Hz, one second’s
worth of audio is 44,100 samples.
Another way to do this is to split
the track into two or more segments
and then move them apart to create a
break of whatever duration you need.
See “Aligning and Moving Tracks” on page 175 to learn how to do this.
Metronome Track
The ﬁrst and best cure for synchronization problems caused by slightly dif-
ferent tempos is keeping everyone in time when you make your recordings.
In other words, the key is prevention. You know those big, expensive record-
ing studios, with all the soundprooﬁng and expensive gear? They don’t
rely on editing wizardry to ﬁx defects any more than they have to. That is
why they are soundproofed and do multiple takes. And that’s why they use
metronomes to keep all the players in time.
Metronomes don’t cost much, and every recording studio should have
one. Like so many other electronic widgets, they come in a monstrous ar-
ray of styles, features, and prices. Just get one has both a silent blinking and
an audible click beat. If it also includes a tuner, has a sine wave generator,
receives weather forecasts, and makes sandwiches, those are nice bonuses.
Audacity will make a metronome track for you. It is better to use a stand-
alone metronome because that doesn’t use any CPU cycles, but it’s there if
you want it. If you’ve installed the C* Audio Plugin Suite (http://www.de/dsp/
caps.html), look in the Generate menu for C* Click Metronome. You’ll see
a menu like the one in Figure 9-22, where you set the beats per second, vol-
ume, and duration. Damping accepts values from 0.1 to 0.9. Damping makes
the metronome sound muted at higher damping values and more resonant
at lower values.
Similar to a metronome track is a click track. Unlike a metronome track,
it has an accented beat at the beginning of every measure. The pitch of the
accented and nonaccented beats is controlled by MIDI note number val-
ues. MIDI note numbering starts at 0 and ends at 127, spanning almost 11
180

octaves. Number 60 is middle C, and there are 12 notes per octave (see Ta-
ble 9-1 for a MIDI note number cheat sheet).

If you’re wondering why no ﬂat symbols are used, it’s because there is
no ﬂat symbol on a keyboard.
Figure 9-23 shows the conﬁguration panel for Generate > Click Track.
(On Linux it’s deeper in the Generate submenus, depending on what plug-
ins are installed.) First create a new empty track by selecting Tracks > Add
New > Audio Track, and then open Click Track.
Figure 9-23: Conﬁguring the Click Track effect
Most of the options should be self-explanatory. Number of measures
determines the length of the track. Noise click resonance and Individual
click duration affect the tone quality; higher values on both of these make
the click tone more musical.
Overdubbing
Overdubbing is recording a new track while listening to an existing track or
tracks. Overdubbing is one way to record an entire symphony by yourself,
one track at a time. It’s also for simpler projects, of course, such as record-
ing yourself playing a couple of different instruments and singing, doing
pretty harmony with yourself, or recording when everyone but the drummer
showed up and you’re going to record without her (she can record her parts
later).
182
Chapter 9

Figure 9-24: Enable Overdub so you can
listen to an existing track while recording a
new track.
Let’s do a quick overdub. First
open an existing audio track or
record a new one. Then in the
Transport menu, enable Overdub
(Figure 9-24). You can also enable
overdubbing by selecting Edit >
Preferences > Recording. Use the
Device toolbar to route playback
wherever you want it to go. Head-
phones are best in most circum-
stances, because you probably don’t
want microphones picking up the
playback. Then click the Record
button to record a second track.
You’ll hear the ﬁrst track in your
headphones, and you can sing or
play along.
Figure 9-25 shows a simple overdubbing session. Playback of the ﬁrst
track is routed to a headset, and our invisible solo performer is singing along
with it on the second track.
Figure 9-25: Recording a new track while listening to the ﬁrst track
Measuring and Fixing Latency
Latency is a common problem when you are overdubbing, because there is
always some latency in playback. Ordinarily some latency at playback doesn’t
matter because we’re just listening, and the sound doesn’t have to be syn-
chronized with anything else. But when you’re overdubbing, any latency
causes the new tracks to be unsynchronized with the old tracks. An easy way
to demonstrate this is to record yourself counting to 10. Then overdub a sec-
ond track and count to 10 again while trying to match the ﬁrst track. Play
them back, and most likely the second track will not be in sync with the ﬁrst
track.
Multitrack Recording
183

NOTE
Always have Edit > Preferences > Recording >Software Playthrough unchecked.
Using Software Playthrough lets you monitor what you are recording, but that’s the
worst way to do it because it adds latency and uses CPU cycles. It is better to use a
monitoring port on your recording interface.
Audacity lets you compensate for this latency in Edit > Preferences >
Recording > Latency. The default latency correction value is −130 ms, which
probably is not correct for your system. You can see this correction in action
when you’re overdubbing a track, because when you stop recording, Audac-
ity will time-shift the new track by whatever the latency correction value is.
This time shift is indicated in the usual way with a pair of arrows on the left
side of the waveform (Figure 9-26).
Figure 9-26: Automatic application of latency correction by time-
shifting is indicated by the pair of arrows.
One way to get the correct latency correction value is to use trial and er-
ror. A simple method is to record a click or metronome track and then over-
dub a vocal track where you try to match the click track. Sure, you might feel
silly saying “tick tick tick” or “ONE two three four” into a microphone, but
it works. Make sure that the “Snap To” checkbox on the Selection toolbar is
not checked and keep adjusting the latency value until it sounds right.
A more precise method is to measure latency using a loopback cable.
This might sound exotic, but all you’re doing is connecting the playback out-
put of your recording interface back to the recording input. If it’s an inter-
nal sound card, connect the line out to the line in. If it’s a USB or FireWire
interface, it’s going to depend on your device and what kind of connectors it
has, but the task is still the same—connect playback out to record in.
Then set Latency Correction to 0. Make sure that the “Snap To” check-
box on the Selection toolbar is not checked. Select the “Length” radio but-
ton, and set the time parameter to hh:mm:ss + milliseconds.
Next, generate a metronome or click track, 30 seconds long, 180 beats
per second. The number of beats per second can be anything; I prefer a
faster beat because it’s easier to measure.
Figure 9-27: The overdubbed track does
not line up with the ﬁrst track because of
latency.
Turn on overdubbing (Trans-
port > Overdub (on/off)), select
your recording interface for both
the playback and recording devices
on the Device toolbar, and press the
Record button. You should see some-
thing like Figure 9-27.
When you’re ﬁnished recording,
zoom in until you can select the gap
between a click on the top track and
its corresponding click on the bottom
track. If you’re not comfortable using

ning of the ﬁrst beat

the mouse, use the SHIFT and arrow keys to mark the
selection. (Use the arrow keys to move back and forth
and up and down, and use the SHIFT and arrow keys to
select.) You will see something like Figure 9-28.
Now you have a Length value in the Selection
toolbar. In my example, that is 177 ms, which is a lot.
If you want, you can zoom way in to get the most pre-
cise measurement. You’ll probably never get zero la-
tency, but you can get close. Latency correction for
overdubbing always takes a negative value, because
the new track always lags behind the old track. If you
change your recording interface, you should repeat
the loopback test, because different devices have dif-
ferent latencies.
When you read up on latency, you will ﬁnd many
passionate discussions about it and much boasting of
heroic low-latency exploits such as “I got my latency
down to three milliseconds!” That is ﬁne, if dubious, but it is good to keep a
bit of perspective. It’s no good going for super-low latency at the cost of sta-
bility or creating skips and stutters because your CPU can’t keep up. Latency
matters during overdubbing, and Audacity helps you with its conﬁgurable
latency correction. It matters when you use software monitoring, which is
why I prefer using recording interfaces with zero-latency monitoring ports.
It matters anywhere you have additional stops in your audio chain such as
outboard special-effects processors. When you play a note, you want sound
to come out, not lag.
You can reduce latency in your audio production computer by using a
high-speed multicore processor and streamlining your computer and tuning
it for audio production. Chapters 13 and 14 tell you how to do this.
Changing Tempo
Despite your best efforts, sometimes the tempo of your tracks wanders out
of sync. If you’re in a punk band, it’s all right, but otherwise you’ll probably
want to correct this. Select Effect > Change Tempo, which changes tempo
without changing pitch. It’s easy, that is, if you know what values to use, and
unfortunately Audacity does not have a tempo detector. The person who
writes a tempo detection plug-in will be a big hero. I use a stopwatch and
count out the beats during playback. It might take a bit of trial and error,
but it’s usually easier than rerecording.
NTSC, PAL, and CDDA Frames
This is a simpliﬁed explanation of what frames are. If you want to make
movie soundtracks, then this is just an introduction to a key concept, and
you will want to learn more.
Multitrack Recording
185

Frames values are for positioning splits exactly at video and audio frame
borders. Check the “Snap To” box in the Selection toolbar, set your time
value to the appropriate frame type, and then when you make splits or cuts,
they will exactly match the frames. Any audio outside of the frame borders
will be lost and possibly create a click.
National Television System Committee (NTSC) frames pertain to ana-
log broadcast television in North America, some South American countries,
and a few other countries. The NTSC drop frame rate is 29.97 frames per
second (fps), and the NTSC nondrop frame rate is 30 fps. Audacity supports
both. Why two? Why the odd 29.97 number? This is an old standard dating
from the black-and-white TV era. The black-and-white broadcast frame rate
was true 30 fps, but when color was added to the broadcast signal, the frame
rate, for various technical reasons, was slowed down to 29.97 fps. Now pay
close attention, because I am going to call on all of my mighty explaining
powers to explain the difference between drop and nondrop NTSC frame
rates in a way that ordinary, non-video-engineer mortals can understand.
This has never been done in the history of humanity; you’re seeing it here
ﬁrst.
NTSC drop and NTSC nondrop frame rates have only one difference:
They use different timecodes to control the playback speed. There is no dif-
ference in the length of the program, but just a tiny difference in how fast
it is played back. The term drop is unfortunate because it is commonly be-
lieved that video frames are dropped, but this is not true. Video time is mea-
sured by counting video frames. When you shoot one hour’s worth of video
at true nondrop 30 fps, your one-hour project will contain exactly 108,000
frames. If it is broadcast without ﬁrst being converted to drop frame, it will
run about 1 hour and 3.6 seconds, because at a 29.97 frame rate there are
107,892 frames per hour. So, at the end of an hour, there are 108 frames
left over.
If you care to do the math, you’ll see that there is a 1 percent differ-
ence between the two. Naturally this adds up over time, which causes woe
to broadcasters. It also causes woe to ﬁlm editors, who need to be able to
measure cuts and scene lengths accurately.
This discrepancy is cured by inserting a bit of on-purpose amnesia and
self-deceit into the drop frame timecode. With NTSC drop frame, your ﬁlm
is played at 30 fps, but it pretends to be 29.97 fps because that is the require-
ment for NTSC TV broadcast. Every video frame is counted until that 1 per-
cent difference adds up to a whole frame. Then the timecode pretends that
frame does not exist and does not count it, and continues counting on the
next frame. So even though your ﬁlm still has its original 108,000 frames,
the forgetful timecode plays what it thinks are only 107,892 frames in one
hour, but it’s really 108,000. Since it has fooled itself into not seeing those
other 108 frames they get played anyway, the ﬁlm ends on time, and every-
one is happy.
This all sounds complicated and bizarre, but in the video-engineering
world, it was an elegant solution that caused minimal disruption to legacy
broadcast infrastructure. The alternative, with the advent of color, was to
overhaul the entire TV broadcasting system for the new color standard.
186
Chapter 9

All NTSC TV broadcasters require that master tapes submitted to them
use NTSC drop frame. If you’re editing a ﬁlm soundtrack in Audacity, you
can exactly match the correct frame rate.
Phase Alternating Line (PAL) is the color TV broadcast standard for a
good portion of the planet: Australia, much of Asia, South America, Europe,
Greenland, and some African countries. It uses a 25 fps frame rate, which
Audacity supports.
Traditional ﬁlm movies are at 24 fps.
If you’re making an audio track for DVD, you can use NTSC, PAL, or
24 fps. For web streaming, you can use whatever frame rates you want.
The Compact Disk Digital Audio (CDDA) frame rate of 75 fps is for
audio CDs. We learned about this for converting legacy analog media to
CD in Chapter 3. For example, when you copy a vinyl LP into Audacity as
one long track and then split the track into individual songs, selecting the
CDDA frame rate ensures that all that splits will match the CDDA frames,
and you won’t create clicks from the audio being out of sync with the CDDA
frame rate.
Creating Loops
Some folks are totally overboard into loops. Loops are clips played over and
over, such as when turning a few seconds of drumming into a long drum
track, creating a backing music track from a short clip, or being hypnotically
repetitious—whatever pleases you. You’ve probably seen low-budget docu-
mentaries that used loops to stretch a few minutes of music into background
soundtracks.
A simple loop is easy. Start with a single short clip. Select Effect > Re-
peat. Enter how many times you want it to repeat. Audacity even does the
arithmetic for you (Figure 9-29).
Figure 9-29: Creating a simple loop by using a short clip and selecting
Effect > Repeat
You can loop a clip, a whole track, or a selection in a track. The repeated
parts will be appended to the original selection, so if your selection is in the
middle of a track, then the repeats will also be in the middle, starting to the
right of the selection.

Mixdown to Stereo
When you have done all of your edits and cleanups and are getting ready to
mix your tracks down to stereo, go into the Track menus of the individual
tracks and assign them to the appropriate left, right, and mono channels.
Left tracks go to the left channel at mixdown, right tracks go to the right
channel, and mono tracks are mapped to both channels. In Audacity, the
top channel of a stereo track is the left channel, and the bottom one is the
right channel.
NOTE
To learn more about cleaning up your tracks, ﬁxing problems, and special effects, see
Chapters 3, 4, 12, and 11.
Figure 9-30: The Pan slider
adjusts the left-right bal-
ance on mono and stereo
tracks.
You now have the option of adjusting the pan
of each mono or stereo track, which means adjust-
ing their left-right balance to enhance stereo imag-
ing. You can do this either with the Pan slider on
the Track panel or with the Pan slider on the sleek
new Mixer Board that ﬁrst appeared in Audacity
1.3.8. The Pan slider does not change your project
ﬁle; it only affects playback in Audacity and how
your export will sound. Adjust this during play-
back in Audacity so you can hear exactly how your
export will sound. This does not work on left or
right tracks but only on mono and stereo tracks.
Figure 9-30 shows how this looks.
Next to the Pan slider is the Gain slider for
adjusting track volume. Just like pan, gain does not
change your project ﬁle but only controls how your export will sound. This
is also adjustable during playback.
Audacity has several ways to mix and render your tracks down to a ster-
eo track. First make sure that in the Edit > Preferences > Import/Export
dialog you have selected “Always mix all tracks down to Stereo or Mono
channel(s).”
Now select Tracks > Mix and Render. This replaces your tracks with the
new stereo track. If you would rather not have your project tracks replaced
by the new stereo track, don’t select Tracks > Mix and Render but remem-
ber that nifty keyboard shortcut CTRL-SHIFT-M (Audacity 1.3.4 and newer).
This mixes and renders a new stereo track that will appear below your mono
tracks (Figure 9-31).
Now you have a nice stereo track all mixed and ready for more editing
or to export to any number of playable formats. If you elected to use the
CTRL-SHIFT-M command to mix and render, you can export just your new
stereo track by selecting the track (click the track label) and then selecting
File > Export Selection.

Too Loud! Clipping!
It is important at this stage to make sure that View > Show Clipping is
checked. This highlights any clipped passages in your new stereo track with
red bars. When multiple tracks are combined into a single track, they get
louder, so clipping is a common mixdown problem. If your new downmixed
track has clipping, you need to go back, lower some volumes, and mix and
render again.
Figure 9-33: Double-
click the Pan and Gain
sliders to open a little
window where you can
type in your values.
Before changing anything, ﬁrst check your Pan
and Gain sliders. It is easy for these sliders to get
moved even when you don’t intend to move them.
Carefully position the cursor on the slider button and
click without moving it, and it will pop up the exact
value. If you have trouble moving the slider, double-
click it to open a little window where you can type in
your pan or gain value (Figure 9-33).
There are several ways to adjust the amplitude of
your tracks. One is to change the amplitude of the
tracks by selecting Effect > Amplify. Try a negative
value of −3, which will reduce the amplitude by 3 decibels. So if the maxi-
mum amplitude is already at −3, this will make it −6. The value −3 is about
a one-half reduction in volume. That may sound like a lot, but as the human
ear perceives sound, that is about one step. About the minimum change we
can detect is 1 dB. This changes your track, so you may prefer to use the
190
Chapter 9

Gain slider instead. It also changes the amplitude only for mixdown and
does not alter the original track. Whichever method you choose, you can
preview it by clicking the Play button. When you’re mixing multiple tracks,
don’t be surprised if you spend some time getting it right.
Control Your Channel Mapping
You can have more control over mixing and rendering by not using Tracks >
Mix and Render but rather going straight to the File > Export dialog. This
combines mixing, rendering, and exporting all into a single operation. Be-
fore you do this, open the Edit > Preferences > Import/Export dialog and
make sure that “Use Custom Mix” is selected and that “Always mix all tracks
down to Stereo or Mono channel(s)” is not. This allows you to map your
channels at export, and this is when you will be grateful that you gave all of
your tracks useful names (Figure 9-34). You can map tracks to more than
one channel.
Figure 9-34: Mapping your tracks to channels at export (note the

The LFE channel is commonly thought of as the subwoofer channel.
This is not quite correct because it is not the same as the signal that is sent
to the subwoofer port. It’s a special channel for carrying sounds in the 3 to
200 Hz range, and the LFE signal can be sent to any speaker capable of han-
dling it.
For DVD-Audio, use the WAV mappings. (See Chapter 6 for more on
DVD-Audio.) Don’t bother with surround sound for CDs because they only
support two-channel stereo.

Chapter 9

There are some special problems with creating multitrack surround au-
dio in Audacity. Audacity is very good at creating high-quality stereo and
mono tracks, but its abilities to manage multitrack surround are rather lim-
ited. You must know the correct channel mappings yourself for different ﬁle
formats because Audacity does not tell you, and when you import a multi-
channel audio ﬁle into Audacity, it loses the track names and channel map-
pings even if the ﬁle was created in Audacity.
You can test your channel mappings after export by playing your new
audio ﬁle on your computer, if your computer has a multichannel surround
sound card and it is already set up and working correctly. See Chapter 13 to
learn how to set up and test surround sound playback on Linux computers.
Windows users will ﬁnd conﬁguration and testing tools in the Sound module
of the Control Panel, and Windows Media Player supports surround sound.
Another way to test your new surround sound ﬁle is to burn it to a DVD
and play it on a surround hi-ﬁsystem. Yet another way is to play the ﬁle on a
digital music server that serves a surround hi-ﬁsystem.

MAKING YOUR OWN RINGTONES
I’m a cheapskate, and I think that paying
money for ringtones is silly. Why should I,
when I already own mass quantities of CDs
and my own recorded music? I don’t even like
cell phones. When I leave home, I don’t want an elec-
tronic leash. If I crash into the ditch, someone will ﬁnd
me eventually, and who’s to say if I could even reach a
phone when I’m hanging upside down in a mangled
vehicle? It’s really okay to be unconnected once in a
while.
But fortunately for you, excellent readers, this book isn’t about only
what I like. Mobile phone owners love to have customized ringtones and
to use their mobile devices as music players (that they can play loudly on
their tinny lo-ﬁspeakers in public places and annoy grumps like me). Most
mobile service providers make it a matter of personal honor to charge cus-
tomers for every last thing they can do with their phones, including ring-
tones and ﬁle transfers. So, you might say to yourself, ﬁne, I’ll just search
online for free ringtones. Be careful—most of the “free” sites are come-ons
for pay services and sometimes malware. There are some legitimate online
sources for free ringtones; some of them are mediocre amateur efforts, and

some are good. In this era of the Wild Wild Internet, shop carefully and be
on guard.
Since the point of this book is doing your own audio production,
how hard can it be to make your own ringtones and phone-friendly tunes?
Not hard at all. Making the actual audio ﬁles is easy. The hard part is ﬁgur-
ing out what audio ﬁle formats your phone supports and then how to trans-
fer ﬁles into it. So let’s use Audacity to create phone-friendly audio ﬁles and
then look at different ways of transferring ﬁles into your phone. You’re go-
ing to need your phone’s manual or any relevant technical information you
can dig up. If you don’t have a manual, look on your phone manufacturer’s
website.
Please refer to Chapter 1 if you need a refresher on the basics of using
Audacity.
Customizing Audio for a Mobile Phone
First import the audio ﬁle into Audacity that you want to use: Either open
an existing Audacity project or click File > Import > Audio to start a new
project with a WAV, FLAC, MP3, Ogg, or other audio ﬁle. Save it as a
new project because you’re going to make a lot of changes.
If it is a stereo ﬁle, ﬁrst convert it to mono with Tracks > Stereo to Mono.
Unless your phone supports stereo, of course. In Edit > Preferences >
Import/Export, make sure that “Always mix all tracks down to stereo or
mono” is checked.
If you need to create a ringtone of a speciﬁc length, such as 20 to
30 seconds, select a 20- or 30-second portion of the track to use. Here is a
slick trick for precisely measuring your selection length: Position the Selec-
tion tool at the beginning of your clip. Go to the Selection toolbar, select
the “Length” radio button, make sure “Snap To” is not checked, and enter
how many seconds long you want your clip to be. If you’re a bit shaky with
the mouse, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor.
Figure 10-1 shows how to use this method to create an exactly 20-second clip.
Leaving your clip selected, select Edit > Trim (or press CTRL-T) to
cut away the excess. Do any other edits you want, such as ﬁxing problems,
boosting the volume, applying special effects, or whatever you desire. A
good trick is to ﬁre up Audacity’s equalizer to shorten the tone curve be-
cause your phone speaker has a limited frequency range, which you can
ﬁnd in its specs. Equalizing your audio ﬁle to match your phone speaker’s
frequency range will make it sound fuller and less tinny. This also makes it
sound better in earbuds and Bluetooth headsets.
For example, suppose your phone speaker has a range of 500 to
10,000 Hz. In comparison, the full range of human hearing is about 20 to
22,000 Hz. Reduce the frequencies outside this range by 24 dB using Effect
> Equalization. The equalizer has two sets of controls; you may use either
the graphical curve or the interface that looks like a hi-ﬁequalizer. Select
“Graphic EQ” to display the equalizer (Figure 10-2). The equalizer sliders

max out at a 20 dB range, while the curve has a range of 120 dB. A reduction
of −60 dB is well beyond what we can hear and is as good as absolute silence.
In Figure 10-3, I manipulated the curve by clicking the line above 500 Hz
to create a control point, clicking at 20 Hz to create another control point,
and then dragging the 20 Hz control point down to −24. Then I did the

same on the other end starting at 10,000 Hz. To make changes, grab and
move the control points, which you can move in any direction. Gradual
curves sound better than abrupt transitions.
You can enlarge the equalizer window both vertically and horizontally;
making it wider exposes more of the frequency scale. The sliders on the
left increase or decrease the size of the decibel scales. The equalizer has no
undo function, but if you mess up incurably, you can hit the Flat button to
reset to zero. Remove control points by dragging them off the graph.
You can increase amplitude by going over zero, because this is not the
same zero as on the Zero Decibels Full Scale that we use when we’re record-
ing or playing back in Audacity. It does not mark the point at which clipping
occurs. Rather, anything over zero in the equalizer is simply an increase in
amplitude, and anything under zero is a decrease. You can still cause clip-
ping or make it too quiet, so the Preview button will help you with this. The
Preview button will preview the ﬁrst three seconds of your clip by default.
You can change this duration in the Edit > Preferences > Playback dialog.
You might save your customized ringtone equalization curve with the
Save As button, and then you can apply it to all of your ringtones.
The “Linear frequency scale” checkbox, when you’re in Draw curves
view, changes the scale from the default logarithmic view to linear. Use the
logarithmic view when you want to see the lower frequencies in more detail.
The Length of ﬁlter setting controls how many samples Audacity pro-
cesses at a time. The default is 4,001 and should be ﬁne most of the time.
You can adjust this either by moving the slider with the mouse or by using
the arrow keys on your keyboard. It is normal for Audacity to display a green
line that follows the blue line of your equalization curve. This shows the
curve that Audacity will actually use, which is affected by the limitations of
198
Chapter 10

the equalization algorithm. If the green line and blue line diverge signif-
icantly, increase the Length of Filter setting or smooth out your curve to
make the transitions more gradual.
When you’re ﬁnished editing, your ringtone is ready to export, and you
need to know what ﬁle format and speciﬁcation your phone requires. For
example, suppose your phone requires 192Kbps constant-bitrate MP3 at
8,000 Hz sampling rate. No problem. If your project sampling rate is not
already 8 kHz, click Tracks > Resample to resample it to the correct rate.
The Track panel will then show the new sampling rate. Then open the File
> Export > MP3 Files > Options dialog. Select Bit Rate Mode: Constant
and Quality: 192Kbps (Figure 10-4).
Figure 10-4: Exporting to the MP3 format and quality level required by your
phone
With newer phones that support WAV ﬁles, requirements run the gamut
from 8-bit depth 8 kHz sampling rate to 16/44.1. If you need to change the
sampling rate, do that before export by using the Tracks > Resample dialog.
Then export using the File > Export > Other uncompressed ﬁles > WAV
dialog and selecting the appropriate bit depth. Figure 10-5 shows what ex-
porting to an 8-bit WAV looks like.
Remember, resample before export and set the bit depth at export.
What if your phone specs specify a bitrate, such as 64Kbps? The bitrate is
always bit depth times sampling rate times the number of channels, so 8-bit
depth times 8 kHz sampling rates times 1 channel equals a bitrate of 64Kbps.
However, ideally your phone documentation won’t make you do math and
will spell it all out for you.

Figure 10-5: Exporting to 8-bit WAV
Keep in mind the storage available on your phone and how much hi-ﬁis
it worth trying to squeeze into a lo-ﬁplayback device. If you have a choice of
different quality levels, it might pay to experiment with lower quality settings
to ﬁnd a good balance between quality and storage capacity.
Applying Dynamic Range Compression
Little phone speakers can’t handle much dynamic range, so you should
compress the dynamic range of your audio ﬁles to level out variations in
volume. I prefer Effect > Leveller for this because it reduces the gain on
the louder frequencies and raises the gain on the quieter frequencies. The
Leveller effect tends to be harsh, but it sounds pretty good on little mobile
device speakers. Figure 10-6 shows the settings I like to use: a Heavy level of
compression and a low Threshold for Noise. The Threshold for Noise deter-
mines what frequencies it will change, so −80 db means virtually everything,
while −20 dB affects frequencies at −20 dB and up.
After applying the Leveller effect, you might need to normalize your
track to raise the volume as high as possible. Select Effect > Normalize,
check “Remove any DC Offset,” check “Normalize maximum amplitude to,”
and set the decibel value to zero, which is as high as you can go. Figure 10-7
shows a waveform with the ﬁrst half Levelled and Normalized and the sec-
ond half untouched.
Strictly speaking, the Leveller effect doesn’t really behave like a com-
pressor but more like a limiter. A limiter is like a compressor set to a high
ratio, like 20:1 and higher, so rather than smoothly reducing the gain above
your threshold, it squashes it most ﬁrmly.

Phone Audio File Formats
Ordinary audio ﬁle formats aren’t weird enough; most mobile phones also
support a special ringtone format called Ring Tone Text Transfer Language
(RTTTL). Modern mobile phones also support MIDI, MP3, WAV, and a host
of other audio ﬁle formats. Audacity does not support RTTTL or MIDI, but
you can use it to prepare audio clips for RTTTL or MIDI conversion with
other software. Chapters 3, 7, 11, and 12 tell all about cleaning up your au-
dio ﬁles, using different audio formats and quality levels, and special effects.
RTTTL
RTTTL is a text language invented by Nokia that describes ringtones and is
designed to be the universal cell phone ringtone language for easy ringtone
transfers. This is what it looks like in written form:
AbbaDance:d=4,o=5,b=80:32p,2d,8c.,2d#,32d.,16c.,32a#.4,8c.,8d.,2d.
That is ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.” No, really, it is. You can download
RTTTL ringtones just like any other audio ﬁle, or you can type them in
using your phone keypad, if your phone includes a ringtone composer. It
might be called melody maker or something similar. Your phone manual will
tell you which keypresses to use for the RTTTL characters. The AbbaDance
example shows the three required elements: the name, the default value,
and data.
The name ﬁeld is the song name, and it can’t be more than 10 charac-
ters or contain a colon, because the colon marks the end of the name string.
Making Your Own Ringtones
201

The default value ﬁeld deﬁnes the default duration, octave, and tempo:
d
Duration
o
Octave
b
Tempo
Any note not assigned its own duration will use the default. For exam-
ple, d=4 in AbbaQueen means the default duration is a quarter note. There
is a four-octave range numbered from 4 to 7. Tempo sets the beats per minute.
RTTTL describes the standard durations of musical notes:
1
Whole note
2
Half note
4
Quarter note
8
Eighth note
16
Sixteenth note
32
Thirty-second note
.
A dot equals a half-beat
You get whole notes and sharps but no ﬂats, because there is no ﬂat sym-
bol on the keypad. But that’s all right, because sharps and ﬂats overlap—for
example, G-sharp and A-ﬂat are the same thing.

Proprietary Audio File Formats
If your phone requires a proprietary or nonstandard audio ﬁle format not
natively supported by Audacity or you prefer to use AAC, WMA, or some
other format, you can use Audacity ﬁrst to create and edit your audio clips,
export them to WAV format, and then use a ﬁle converter application to
convert the WAV into the correct format. Where do you ﬁnd a converter?
There are skillions of them, which you can ﬁnd with a bit of web searching.
Another option is to install the open source FFmpeg encoder. This is a
high-quality, open source multimedia encoder, and Audacity has FFmpeg
integration built in. FFmpeg is Free software and free of cost. Visit the FFm-
peg documentation page (http://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) to learn
how to download and install it on Mac and Windows. Linux users can install
it from their distribution’s software repositories.
The Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) audio format is a lossy, compressed
encoding and compression technology that encompasses both digital audio
and video as part of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 speciﬁcations. AAC audio is
supposed to sound better than MP3, which is also a lossy, compressed for-
mat. AAC is patented, and anyone who wants to distribute AAC-encoded
content may do so freely without restrictions or payment. But a patent li-
cense is required to develop and distribute AAC codecs.
AAC is the default audio container format for iTunes, though iTunes
also supports WAV, MP3, AIFF, and Apple Lossless. AAC has some abilities
that MP3 does not, such as support for up to 48 channels, while MP3 sup-
ports only 2, and a wider range of sampling frequencies, 8 kHz to 96 kHz,
while MP3 supports only 16 kHz to 48 kHz. AAC is said to handle higher fre-
quencies and stereo imaging better. There are some other differences that
are more interesting to codec designers; the bottom line, as always, is how it
sounds to you.
NOTE
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, one of the original developers of MP3 and one of its many
patent holders, also has a 5.1 surround-sound MP3 encoder and decoder. As most peo-
ple say when they hear about this, “Why bother with cruddy lo-ﬁsix-channel surround
sound? Two cruddy lo-ﬁchannels are plenty.” But for those who are interested, it is
free to evaluate on Mac or Windows only. If you like it and want to use it for anything
other than personal evaluation, it will cost money.
AAC is represented by a host of ﬁle extensions—.m4a, .m4b, .m4p, .m4v,
.m4r, .3gp, .mp4, and .aac—which include both video and audio. Audacity
uses the .m4a extension, which Apple uses to indicate a non-copy-protected
audio-only ﬁle. .m4p is the extension used for encrypted, copy-protected
iTunes audio ﬁles.
Saving your ﬁles in AAC format in Audacity is easy, once FFmpeg is
installed: Click Export > M4A (AAC) Files (FFmpeg) > Options. In the
Options dialog you have a range of quality settings from 10 to 500, with 500
being the highest quality. This range represents Fair, Okay, Good, Better,
and Best. The value 256 is a good setting for a more complex recording. A
simple recording, such as a spoken-word piece, sounds decent at 50, though
100 is noticeably better (Figure 10-8).
Making Your Own Ringtones
203

Figure 10-8: Exporting to AAC format (the default iTunes for-
mat), which creates a ﬁle with an .m4a extension
WMA is Windows Media Audio, a proprietary, lossless audio compres-
sion technology invented by Microsoft. WMA refers to both the codec and
the audio ﬁle format. WMA supports a maximum 48 kHz sampling rate and
two channels. WMA audio is usually encapsulated in an Advanced Systems
Format (ASF) container, which contains metadata such as song name, artist
name, and track number. ASF also supports Windows Media DRM (digital
rights management). The ﬁle extension for DRM and non-DRM WMA ﬁles
is the same, .wma; if you try to play a DRM ﬁle on a player that doesn’t sup-
port Windows DRM, it will label it as unplayable.
In Audacity, open the Export > WMA (version 2) Files (FFmpeg) >
Options dialog. Your only option is to select a bitrate (Figure 10-9).
How to Transfer Files to Your Phone
What most US providers want to you to do is sign up for their online services
and buy all your ringtones and music from them. What if you just want a
phone and not a web browser/email client with a tiny screen? Then you can
order new ringtones attached to text messages. What if you don’t want to
pay for text services or learn to type with your thumbs? Then you must be
some kind of weirdo. Wear the label with pride, and let’s explore other ways
to move ﬁles in and out of our phones. My preferred method is from a PC—
my PC, that is, that I control and don’t have to pay fees to access.
Many phones accept SD storage cards, usually miniSD or microSD cards.
For less than $20, you can get any of these with a USB SD card reader or an
adapter for a standard SD card reader so you can plug it into a standard USB
port on a computer. These cards have several gigabytes of storage capacity.
204
Chapter 10

Figure 10-9: Encoding your ringtone in the WMA format
NOTE
The ﬁrst time you install a new SD card in your phone, you should format it using
the phone’s menu. This creates the right type of ﬁlesystem for your phone. Your phone’s
manual will tell you how. Formatting the storage card erases everything on it.
After formatting a card, just plug it into the appropriate card reader,
plug it into your computer, copy over your new ringtones, and then stuff
the card into your phone and transfer the ﬁles to the correct directory. Your
phone might even have some helpful menu options to make this easy.
Bluetooth is another common option for connecting a mobile phone
to a PC. It’s an odd name for a useful function: very short-range wireless ra-
dio networking, from 1 to 100 feet. If your computer does not have a Blue-
tooth adapter, you can buy a USB Bluetooth adapter for less than $30. Get
Bluetooth 2.0 because that is the newest and fastest standard. To establish
a Bluetooth networking connection, follow the instructions in your camera’s
manual. Typically, you’ll activate Bluetooth on your PC, set it to discovery
mode, and then set up pairing with your phone from the phone’s menu. If
it asks you for a personal identiﬁcation number (PIN), this is usually an arbi-
trary number that you invent at the time of discovery and then duplicate on
the computer to complete the connection.
Some cell phone service providers disable ﬁle transfer via Bluetooth
because they want to overcharge you for online services or charge you ex-
tra up front for a data connection kit, which is a fancy way of saying they want
to gouge you for uncrippling some of the phone’s built-in functions. Fig-
ure 10-10 shows a microSD card, a USB Bluetooth adapter, and accessories.
Of course, you can avoid all this business of paying to unlock phone
functions by purchasing an unlocked phone. You’ll have to ﬁgure out for
yourself if it’s better to go with a branded phone, which is subsidized by the
Making Your Own Ringtones

service provider and locks you in for a year or two, or to pay full price for the
freedom of an unlocked phone.
Figure 10-10: A microSD Flash storage card adapter, a wee Cirago USB Blue-
tooth interface, another adapter, a cute red USB microSD reader, a tiny 2GB
microSD card, and a US quarter for scale
I think the easiest and best way to transfer ﬁles between a computer and
a cell phone is via an ordinary USB cable, and some phones support this.
Any of these methods can be used for any kind of ﬁle transfer, and not
just your ringtones. Photos, contacts, messages, any of the data stored in
your phone can be backed up to a PC or transferred from a PC to your phone.
There are many Windows and Apple software applications for managing
your mobile phone from your computer. These usually cost a few dollars.
There is a good open source, free-of-cost application worth trying that runs
on Linux, Mac, and Windows: BitPim. To quote the BitPim website (http://
www.bitpim.org/):
BitPim is a program that allows you to view and manipulate data
on many CDMA phones. . . . This includes the PhoneBook, Calen-
dar, WallPapers, RingTones (functionality varies by phone), and
the Filesystem.
Now you know how to create and optimize your own custom ringtones
and audio ﬁles for your mobile devices and how to add extra storage so you
can carry around your entire music collection with you. Don’t forget the
earbuds. Or even some fancy, high-end padded headphones, because your
phone speaker might be poo but its sound processor just might be pretty
good, needing only some good headphones to come to life.

AUDACITY PLUG-INS FOR SPECIAL
EFFECTS
Plug-ins are add-on software modules that
give Audacity extra functionality: ﬁlters,
analysis, tone generators, and special effects
of all kinds. Plug-ins are nice because you don’t
have to install a monolithic program with everything
in the world just to get the few extra features that you
really want.
Some are bundled with your Audacity installation, and you can ﬁnd
many more on the Internet. Or you can even write your own. Plug-ins do
not run standalone; they run on hosts, which are applications (such as Au-
dacity and other audio production software) that support the plug-ins. You
will ﬁnd Audacity’s plug-ins in the Generate, Effect, and Analyze menus.
There are three types of plug-ins that work with Audacity: Linux Au-
dio Developer’s Simple Plugin API (LADSPA), Virtual Studio Technology
(VST), and Nyquist. LADSPA is mainly for Linux, though there are some
LADSPA plug-ins for Windows and Mac. VST is for Windows and Mac, and
Nyquist plug-ins work on all three.

Plug-ins are sorted alphabetically in the Audacity menus; there isn’t a
way to sort or organize plug-ins according to your own wishes, such as the
ones you use the most. Finding helpful information about them, such as
what they do or what the various settings mean, is often a bit of a challenge.
There is some information on the Audacity wiki, and the home sites of the
various plug-in projects have documentation of varying degrees of helpful-
ness. It’s easy enough to try them and hear for yourself what they do. In this
chapter, we’ll cover a batch of commonly used plug-ins in detail and deﬁne
some terminology. A brief audio glossary at the end of this chapter explains
some of the more common terms you’ll encounter for plug-ins and special
effects.
Manipulation and analysis of digital and audio signals are part of the
discipline of signal processing. We’re not going to dive into the math and the-
ory of signal processing in this book; to learn more, see the bibliography for
some references.
Let’s dive right into exploring and playing with some of Audacity’s spe-
cial effects. Your own Audacity menus may be different from those in the ex-
amples, depending on which Audacity version you are using and what plug-
ins you have installed. If you don’t know how to ﬁnd and install plug-ins,
skip ahead to the sections in this chapter on ﬁnding and installing plug-ins
on Linux and Windows.
NOTE
When you can’t ﬁnd documentation, sometimes browsing the source code rewards you
with useful information. You can see all of Audacity’s source code online at http://
audacity.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/audacity/audacity-src/. Use the Sticky
Tag menu to select the correct Audacity version, and then look in the nyquist, plug-
ins, and src/effects directories to see the source code for Audacity’s plug-ins.
Cross-Fades
Figure 11-1: A
simple cross-fade

Fade In/Fade out
effects and the Time
Shift tool
Our ﬁrst effect is not even a real Audacity special effect:
cross-fading. A cross-fade is when one track fades out
and another track fades in with some overlap. We hear
this all the time on radio and TV. Audacity doesn’t have
a cross-fade function, but it’s easy enough to create one
with the Time Shift tool.
You need two tracks to do this. Apply Effect >
Fade Out to one, and apply Effect > Fade In to the
other. Then use the Time Shift tool to move the tracks
to create the degree of overlap you want (Figure 11-1).
For ﬁner control of the degree of fades and their
duration, use the Envelope tool.

Chapter 11

Generate Menu
The Generate menu contains plug-ins for creating new tones. Start with a
new, blank Audacity session. Select Generate and then whatever effect you
want to try. This will open a dialog with the available options for the par-
ticular tone. If all the audio in an existing track is selected, generating a
new tone will replace the old one. If a portion of the existing audio is se-
lected, the selection will be replaced. If no existing tracks are selected, then
creating a new tone also creates a new track. You can also select Tracks >
Add New > Audio Track to create additional tracks.
Sine Wave Example
Let’s create a sine wave to get the hang of creating tones. Open the Gener-
ate > Tone dialog. Select a sine waveform, set the frequency (Hz) to 3,999,
set the amplitude to 0.8, and set a duration of whatever you want. The de-
fault is 30 seconds (Figure 11-2).
You will see something like Figure 11-2. Zoom way in to see the classic
sine waveform (Figure 11-3).

Frequency Range of Generated Tones
The available frequency range of your newly generated tones is theoretically
half the project sampling rate. For example, if your project rate is 8,000 Hz,
then the available range for your tones should be 0 to 3,999 Hz. But your
usable range is a bit less. You will know you are at the extreme end of the
range when you see either silence or a pulsing waveform instead of a nice
steady waveform. Figure 11-4 shows a 3,999 Hz sine wave created with project
sampling rates of 8,000, 16,000, and 32,000 Hz (from top to bottom). Fig-
ure 11-5 shows how they look when you zoom way in and how they look
smoother at higher sampling rates.

DTMF Tones
Using the Generate > DTMF tones effect is fun, because you can use it to
play any word or text string in DTMF tones. What, you ask, are DTMF tones?
Those are the tones emitted by an analog touch-tone telephone: dual-tone
multifrequency. It’s called dual-tone because each keypress sends a tone that is
a combination of two tones. The handy table in Figure 11-6, poached from
Wikipedia (with permission), shows the tone matrix for a touch-tone phone.
Figure 11-7 shows the DTMF tone generator dialog. The DTMF sequence
is a word, phrase, or any alphanumeric string. The tone/silence ratio con-
trols the duration of the spaces between each tone.

high frequency and duration, and the tone will
slide up or down according to frequency order.
You can try different waveform types to hear how
they sound: sine, square (alias or no alias), or
sawtooth. The Interpolation setting offers either
Linear or Logarithmic. Linear gives equal time
to all frequencies, while Logarithmic plays the
lower frequencies for a longer period of time
(Figure 11-9).
Generating Noise
Figure 11-10:
Generate > Noise
takes three options: type
of noise, amplitude, and
duration.
The Generate > Noise menu item is for gener-
ating white, pink, or brown noise. Why, you may
ask, would you want to do that? I’m nowhere near
knowledgeable enough to get into the mathemat-
ics, which is the foundation of acoustics and which
is fascinating if you care to learn. I can answer “what
for”: to test audio gear, to conﬁgure sound balance
in music halls, to create background noise to help
sleep or concentration, and to cover up annoying
sounds. Figure 11-10 shows Audacity’s simple noise
generator.
White noise is often used in electronic music production because it has
the useful property of cutting through other noises. It is called white noise
because it is analogous to white light, which is an equal combination of all
light frequencies. White noise is a combination of all audible audio frequen-
cies, so one way to think of it is 20,000 tones all playing at once at the same
amplitude. However, this isn’t strictly accurate, since it is usually generated
by random noise generators in which all frequencies are equally probable,
rather than all played at once. Human hearing is more sensitive to higher
frequencies, so even though the amplitude is the same at all frequencies, we
notice the higher frequencies more. White noise sounds like steam hissing.
Pink noise sounds similar to white noise, but instead of having the same
amplitude at different frequencies, it drops off by 3 dB per octave as frequen-
cies climb, with equal amplitude across each octave. So, lower frequencies
have more power than higher frequencies, and pink noise sounds more like
a roar than a hiss.
Brown noise is also known as red noise. It is called brown for Brownian
motion, not for color, and if you’re interested in why, I shall leave it as your
homework assignment to ﬁnd out. (More math.) Brown noise decreases in
amplitude by 6 dB per octave as frequencies increase, so it has even more
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
211

bass emphasis than pink noise. Pink and brown noise are closer to how hu-
man ears perceive amplitude across the frequency range than white noise.
Figure 11-11 shows what white, pink, and brown noise look like in Au-
dacity. The bottom three tracks are in Spectrum view, which gives you a nice
picture of the relative energy (amplitude) at different frequencies. Red is
“hotter,” or higher amplitude, and blue is “cooler,” or lower amplitude. It’s
just like the light spectrum where the red end of the spectrum is hotter and
blue is cooler. If the image were in color, you would see that the white noise
spectrum is uniform, the pink noise spectrum ranges from red to red-with-
blue, and the range from red to blue is more pronounced in the brown
noise spectrograph. Of course, you can easily create these in Audacity and
see the colors.
Figure 11-11: The ﬁrst three tracks show white, pink, and brown
noise in linear waveforms. The second set of three tracks shows
them in Spectrum view.
Several other types of noise “colors” are not supported in Audacity, un-
less you ﬁnd or write a plug-in. Purple noise is the opposite of brown noise
because amplitude increases 6 db per octave as frequency increases. Blue
noise is the opposite of pink noise: Amplitude increases 3 dB per octave.
We’ve used Generate > Silence several times in this book. It creates a
completely silent interval of whatever duration you want. This is handy for
aligning tracks that are off by a little bit, evening out the spacing in a pod-
212
Chapter 11

cast with two speakers so they don’t talk at the same time, and making sure
that the intervals between songs are absolutely quiet. It’s also useful for test-
ing how silent your playback system really is.
Test Tones
Figure 11-12: Square, sawtooth, and sine
waves
Selecting Generate > Tones is a
fun way to test the limits of your
cheapo (or nice) sound card and
to give yourself an ad hoc hear-
ing test. You can create tones with
sine, square, sawtooth, or square, no
alias waveforms. Zoom way in to
see the waveforms like you see in
books and articles about waveforms
(Figure 11-12).
A sine wave can be thought of
as a pure tone without harmonics,
so when you want a pure tone, you
want a sine wave. A sine wave alter-
nates smoothly from positive (above
the median, or zero line) to nega-
tive (below the median line) and
back again. More complex tones
can be represented by combinations
of sine waves. Sine waves are all
around us: Ocean waves, the Slinky,
alternating current, and light waves
are a few examples. In audio, a sine wave represents frequency, which is mea-
sured in hertz (cycles per second), amplitude (loudness or volume), and phase.
Figure 11-13 shows what these look like in Audacity.
You can think of phase in terms of Audacity’s Time Shift tool; when the
phase is nonzero, that means the waveform is moved forward or backward
in time. A negative value is backward, and a positive value is forward. This
is called linear phase because all frequencies are affected equally. Sometimes
we don’t notice a linear phase shift because there is nothing to compare it
to. An example of this is playing a CD—the music is delayed a little bit by
passing through the digital-to-audio converter, but we don’t care because
we don’t notice it. On the other hand, this is a real problem for overdub-
bing because new tracks will be out of sync with old tracks, so we have to
compensate for it. (See Chapter 9 to learn more about overdubbing and
synchronization.)
Two waveforms deliberately phase-shifted relative to each other will cre-
ate new sounds. A common effect is creating a pleasing echo by duplicating
an audio track and then mixing the two tracks with the second track a lit-
tle bit out of phase. Now you know the secret of overproduced commercial
vocals: They use way too many phase-shifted layers. (If you like echo, try se-
lecting Effect > Echo.)
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
213

Figure 11-13: The top track is a 100 Hz sine wave, and the second track
is 1,000 Hz, showing what different frequencies look like. Both have the
same amplitude. The third track is half the amplitude of the top two, and
the fourth track is a copy of the third track, shifted slightly out of phase.
Phase shift also describes synchronization between two or more wave-
forms. Two waveforms that are exactly in phase combine amplitudes and
sound louder. Two waveforms with varying degrees of being in or out of
phase produce all kinds of different sounds. Two identical waveforms that
are inverted 180 degrees relative to each other cancel each other out. Noise-
cancellation devices do this, with varying degrees of effectiveness.
A square waveform pertains to digital electronics. (The square wave is
sometimes also called the Rademacher function.) Rather than the nice
smooth curve of the analog sine wave, a square waveform represents the in-
stant transitions of digital circuits. Just like everything digital, it’s all binary—
ones or zeroes, on or off. Unlike a sine wave, which represents a pure tone
with no harmonics, square waveforms are chock-full of harmonics. You can
hear a distinct difference when you create a sine waveform and a square
waveform in Audacity and compare them. Square waveforms contain only
odd-integer harmonics, such as ﬁrst, third, and ﬁfth harmonics.
A square, no alias waveform is a dandy demonstration of the distortion
caused by aliasing in digital audio. Create a square tone and a square (no
alias) tone of the same frequency and duration side by side and zoom in.
You’ll see something like Figure 11-14, and there should be an audible dif-
ference when you listen to them, with the no-alias tone sounding smoother
214
Chapter 11

and purer. This is also a great way to experience the effects of different sam-
pling rates; you’ll notice that lower sampling rates have higher distortion.
Figure 11-14: The top waveform is aliased, and the bottom waveform is not.
A sawtooth waveform has both even and odd harmonics, so it is used for
synthesizing complex musical sounds such as stringed instruments.
Click Track
The Click Track effect is a useful plug-in that may not come with your de-
fault Audacity installation (see “Linux Plug-ins“ and “Windows Plug-in“ near
the end of this chapter for information on ﬁnding and installing more plug-
ins). It works on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Click tracks are like metronome
tracks, with one difference: The ﬁrst beat of each measure is accented (Fig-
ure 11-15).
Figure 11-15: The Click Track effect creates a beat track at
conﬁgurable tempo, duration, and tonal qualities.
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
215

The different click types are ping, noise, and tick. The Noise click reso-
nance setting makes them sound crisper or mushier, with higher values be-
ing crisper.
Click Track uses two different default tones: C above middle C for the
ﬁrst beat of each measure, which is represented by MIDI number 72, and
middle C for the remaining beats in each measure, which is MIDI number
60. For example, if you select a waltz beat, which is three beats per measure,
you’ll hear “TICK tick tick TICK tick tick.” There are 12 notes per octave,
including ﬂats and sharps. Figure 11-16 is handy table listing all the MIDI
note numbers.
Figure 11-16: Your handy MIDI note table for
selecting MIDI pitches for a click track
NOTE
Just for fun, sing the “Do Re Mi” song from The Sound of Music to refresh your
memory of the seven whole notes—do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do. (If you’ve forgotten, that
covers one octave plus one note: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A.)
Pluck
Figure 11-17: The Pluck effect gener-
ates tones at different frequencies with
short or long fade-outs.
Another interesting add-on plug-in is
Pluck. It’s pretty simple: Choose your
MIDI note, set the duration, and con-
ﬁgure a gradual or abrupt fade-out.
A higher note like 96 sounds like the
slide-advance tone in old-fashioned
slide shows. (Grade school in the 1960s,
back in the last millennium . . .) A low-
frequency note sounds like a sci-ﬁsound
effect (Figure 11-17).
Risset Drum
The Risset Drum effect creates a nice tone that at lower frequencies
sounds like a deep bass drum, or any large resonant drum with a fat tone,
and at higher frequencies sounds metallic like a cowbell or a triangle (Fig-
ure 11-18).
216
Chapter 11

Figure 11-18: The Risset Drum effect
The Risset Drum effect is named
for the inventor Jean-Claude Risset,
who created a lot of amazing effects
with electronic audio. A Risset pattern
creates the illusion of a rhythm in re-
verse: It sounds like the tempo is in-
creasing when it is really decreasing,
and the other way around. A Risset
rhythm gives the illusion of a rhythm
that is always accelerating even as it
stays the same.
This is a good effect to use for
creating a 2/4 or 4/4 percussion beat.
The settings I used in Figure 11-18 create a deep, booming bass drumbeat
at two beats per second. The Decay value sets the length of the beat, so 0.5
makes two beats per second. This creates only a single beat, so you can pre-
view how a steady repeated beat will sound by clicking SHIFT-Play. Click the
Stop button when you’ve had enough. When you’re ready to create a drum-
beat track, select the beat and then click Effect > Repeat to create a loop.
This opens a dialog with one option: how many times you want it to repeat.
It even does the arithmetic for you and tells you how long it will run (Fig-
ure 11-19).
Figure 11-20 shows what your new drum track will look like.
Figure 11-19: Looping your
Risset beat with the Repeat
effect to create a drum track
Figure 11-20: A drum track created
with the Risset Drum and Repeat
effects
What if the tempo you created isn’t quite right? That is easy to ﬁx with
the Change Tempo effect, which changes the tempo without changing pitch.
Figure 11-21: Use the
Change Tempo effect to
change tempo without
changing pitch.
First undo the Repeat effect so that you are back
to your original, single drum beat. Then click Ef-
fect > Change Tempo and enter your new Beats
per Minute value. In Figure 11-21, it changes
from 120 beats per minute to 150. But of course
it is still just a single beat, so go back to Effect >
Repeat and create a loop again, and there is your
new, faster drum track.
It is best to change the tempo of your sin-
gle, original beat because applying the Change
Tempo effect to your whole loop track will
change where each beat starts, and most of
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
217

them will be off-tempo. Though this could be interesting enough to use, it’s
up to you.
Effect Menu
The effects in the Effect menu don’t create new tones but modify existing
tones. A good way to get the hang of the Effect menu plug-ins is to apply
them to tones created in the Generate menu. A sine wave is great for exper-
imenting with effects because it is a simple tone and you can hear exactly
what the effect does. Another good test tone is a simple recording of your
own speaking or singing voice.
NOTE
Note the Repeat Last Effect (CTRL-R) command at the top of the Effect menu. This is
a fast way to reapply the same effect with the same settings.
Reverberation
Probably the most popular effect in audio editing is reverberation. You have
probably listened to commercial music recordings where the reverb was laid
on too thick and it sounds like the singer is being crushed under layer upon
layer of reverb or like the recording was made in an empty swimming pool.
A little reverb goes a long way. The usual purpose of reverb is to better sim-
ulate a live sound, but of course you can do whatever you like. Reverb can
sound ethereal and distant and be evocative of things half remembered.
Audacity’s Gverb plug-in is cross-platform and has a Preview button so
you can easily try different settings. You should preview reverb settings on
monitor speakers rather than headphones, because the channel separation
in headphones will lessen the reverb effect.
NOTE
The default preview in Audacity is three seconds; you can change this in the Edit >
Preferences > Playback dialog.
There are several ways to approach applying reverb to your audio tracks.
A common technique is to work from a duplicate wet track rather than your
original, unmodiﬁed dry track. When you have tweaked your reverb satis-
factorily, mix the wet track together with a copy of the dry track. Keeping
an original, 100 percent dry track means you can make several reverb tracks
with different settings and control the ﬁnal results in the mix.
You can also edit just a duplicate track, keeping the original for insur-
ance in case the copy becomes a muddled mess. If you are daring, you can
work without a net and operate on your original. Audacity has nearly unlim-
ited undo, so this isn’t all that daring, but bad things can happen and then
you have extra work.
First select a portion of audio or the whole track. To start from neutral
with Gverb, push all sliders all the way to the left (Figure 11-22), except the
Dry signal level, which should be at zero.
218
Chapter 11

Figure 11-22: Gverb with all the settings at neutral, or no reverb
Now you can try the settings and hear what they do. The most notice-
able changes come from the Early reﬂection level and Dry signal level set-
tings. Next give Tail level a go, keeping it at an equal or lesser value than
Early reﬂection level, and then try changing Reverb time. This is what each
setting does:
Roomsize
This is supposed to simulate different room sizes, in square
meters, and it operates mainly on the Early Reﬂection and Tail Levels.
To my ears it doesn’t seem to do much; your mileage may vary. Other
reverb plug-ins and gadgets seem to do this better.
Reverb time
This controls the duration of the reverb in seconds, with
larger values giving longer duration.
Damping
The higher the Damping value, the less intense the reverb.
This simulates different room sizes and surfaces, like a small room with
hard surfaces making a bright sound or a large room with absorbent
surfaces creating a softer, darker effect.
Input bandwidth
This is a tone control, with higher values emphasiz-
ing higher frequencies and sounding brighter.
Dry signal level
This controls how much of the original signal is al-
tered; 0 is none, and −70 is all of it. However, even at zero you will still
hear some changes. The overall volume is reduced along with lower dry
signal levels, so you may need to apply normalization after applying your
reverb.
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
219

Early reﬂection level
This simulates how sound is reﬂected off the
walls and furniture. Early reﬂection is always delayed compared to a dry
signal.
Tail level
This controls the intensity of the reverb. If you make this
value larger than the Early reﬂection level value, it gives an interesting
distance affect, as though you’re listening outside the concert hall.
The Audacity manual suggests a number of prefab settings to try (http://

Freeverb is an older reverb plug-in that is a bit simpler to use, and to
my ears it sounds better (Figure 11-23). The Room Size slider has a wide
and obvious range, and there are both Wet and Dry sliders. Width mimics
speaker spread. Check the “Freeze Mode” checkbox to play the preview dry
without changing your Freeverb settings so you can quickly compare it to the
modiﬁed signal.
Figure 11-23: Freeverb is an another reverb effect.
If Freeverb doesn’t come with your Audacity installation, visit the Free-
verb3 home on SourceForge to get both source code and binary ﬁles (http://
freeverb3.sourceforge.net/).
Now let’s look at the built-in Audacity Effect plug-ins.
Amplify
I use the Effect > Amplify effect a lot for both reducing and increasing am-
plitude. Don’t check “Allow clipping” or go over zero unless you know you
really want to, because anything greater will be clipped and distorted. An
increase of 3 dB is double, and 1 dB is about the smallest change we can per-
ceive. Enter a negative value, such as −3 dB, to reduce amplitude. Amplify
can be applied to a selection, a whole track, or a group of tracks.
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
221

Auto Duck
This is a great effect for recordings with a background music track, such as
a podcast, because it automatically lowers the volume when the foreground
track cuts in and raises it when the foreground cuts out. In Figure 11-24, we
see the setup: On top is a stereo background music track, and the bottom
mono track is a spoken-voice track. When the voice starts, I want the music
volume to decrease, and when the voice stops, the music should return to its
former volume level. They have to be in this order: the background track on
top and the control track underneath.
Figure 11-24: Using Auto Duck, with your background track on top and your foreground,
or control track, underneath
Select the background track, and click Effect > Auto Duck. You’ll see
a control panel like the one in Figure 11-25, which shows the settings I like
to use. These settings create a fast fade-out and a gradual fade-in. The back-
ground track ducks out of the way fast and gracefully glides slowly back in
with just a little bit of overlap with the voice track.
Duck amount is how much volume reduction you want on the back-
ground track.
Maximum pause determines how long the total fade-ins and fade-outs
will take. The Outer fade down length and Outer fade up length values can-
not total more than the Maximum pause value.
The Outer fade down length setting determines how quickly the back-
ground track will fade before the voice on the control track comes back.
Anything outside the two vertical lines in the graph happens when the con-
trol track is below your threshold. The Inner fade down length setting deter-
mines how much overlap there will be with the control track.
The Outer fade up length setting controls how fast the backing track
fades back in when the voice on the control track stops, and the Inner fade
up length setting controls the overlap. A half second of gently rising mu-
sic over the voice isn’t a lot; I think it makes a nice bit of a transition. Fig-
ure 11-26 shows what these tracks look like after the Auto Duck effect is
applied.

Duck effect.

223

Change Pitch
Figure 11-27: The Change Pitch effect
serves up several ways to measure
pitch changes.
Change Pitch changes the pitch without
changing the tempo, so you can adjust
your audio higher or lower in pitch with-
out speeding it up or slowing it down.
I’ve used this on tracks that were a lit-
tle bit out of tune, and it does a nice
job. The Change Pitch effect will do its
best to detect the current frequency and
pitch of your selection, and then you can
go up or down from there (Figure 11-
27). There are all kinds of digital tuners
for instruments and voice that do this
and even fancy rackmount units that au-
tomatically correct the pitch for you.
Phaser
Figure 11-28: The Phaser
effect creates a multitude of
fascinating and eerie sounds,
from soaring vocals to space
aliens.
Using Effect > Phaser splits the signal into two
parts (one wet and one dry), applies your set-
tings to the wet track, and then combines them
back into one. Its primary purpose is to create
an oscillating or vibrato effect, and thanks to the
wonder of modern electronics, you can apply a
multitude of extra effects to it. Try it on a record-
ing of your own voice or a plain sine wave to get
an idea of what it can do. The phaser (phase
shifter) is a popular effect used in all kinds of
music: to create a soaring effect on electric gui-
tars, to sweeten keyboards, and to make all kinds
of spacey science-ﬁction noises (Figure 11-28). (A
similar effect is the ﬂanger, which you get when
you install the extra plug-ins from the Audacity
website.)
The Stages setting determines the number of ﬁlters used at one time,
from 2 to 24. Higher values create a more complex, layered tone, with multi-
ple oscillations.
The Dry/Wet balance accepts values from 0 to 255, with 0 being com-
pletely dry and 255 completely wet.
An LFO frequency is a low-frequency oscillation that creates a pulsing
rhythm or vibrato-type effect. In the Phaser dialog, the available LFO Fre-
quency range is from 1 to 40 Hz, or 1 to 40 pulses per second. Increasing
the value of this setting can have a dramatic effect, depending on the other
224
Chapter 11

settings and how it interacts with them. For example, try setting both LFO
Frequency and Depth to their maximums and see what happens. You know
how ripples in a swimming pool spread out, bounce off the sides, bounce
back, and collide with each other? Sound waves do the same thing, and
you can’t always predict the results. It may help to keep in mind that sound
waves are three-dimensional, so they’re all over the place and not just on a
fairly ﬂat plane like water ripples.
Figure 11-29: Phase shift is measured in degrees
of a circle.
LFO Start Phase determines
the phase shift of your signal,
from 0 to 359 degrees. That’s
right, just like a circle. The de-
gree of phase shift is most eas-
ily explained by looking at Fig-
ure 11-29. A sine wave alternates
smoothly between positive and
negative voltage; positive volt-
age is above the center line, and
negative voltage is below. Where
the waveform crosses the center
line is the zero crossing point, be-
cause that is the point of zero voltage. The starting point of the sine wave is
zero rising to positive; 180 degrees is at zero crossing into negative. When it
gets back to zero from negative, that is a full 360 degrees.
You might recall from earlier in this chapter how this affects your au-
dio signal: Two waveforms at a phase shift of 180 degrees from each other
cancel each other out, and varying degrees of phase shift combine to create
different sounds, from a simple echo to weird space alien noises.
You can also illustrate this three-dimensionally with a Slinky. That’s
right, Slinky is more than a toy—Slinky is a physics teaching tool. Slinky is
a helix, and Slinky represents audio phase in three dimensions. Slinky rip-
ples in longitudinal waves just like sound and in traverse waves that are like
the stretched strings of musical instruments. Slinky illustrates harmonics and
amplitude. Slinky is amazing, and researching “physics of Slinky” will lead
you to all sorts of fascinating knowledge (Figure 11-30).
Depth usually refers to how much the pitch is bent, from 0 to 255, with
higher values producing a more pronounced vibrato effect. However, Au-
dacity’s phaser seems to bend the amplitude rather than the pitch, which
makes a signal that fades in and out quickly. Crank this up along with the
Stages value to get some neat space alien sounds.
Finally, Feedback is the familiar distortion effect that adds crunch and
texture. A higher percentage equals more distortion. Set the Dry/Wet bal-
ance and Feedback value to the maximum to generate some really weird
sci-ﬁsounds like they used in old movies.

Wikipedia user Roger McLassus, released under the GFDL.)
Reverse
Reverse is a simple effect with no options—it turns your audio around back-
ward. Back in the 1970s when disapproving pruney-lipped people were play-
ing LPs backward to ﬁnd the Satanic messages, this would have saved them
a lot of trouble. It was a waste of time anyway, since records with devil mes-
sages played them frontward.
Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift
This is a fun new effect that changes tempo or pitch, or both. But that’s
not all—it also has a sliding effect so you can go from slow to fast, lower to
higher pitch, both at the same time, and the reverse. I know, all of these
effects have been done before in the wonderful Looney Tunes and Mer-
rie Melodies cartoons. But they had to do it the hard way with expensive
equipment.
Checking the Dynamic Transient Sharpening checkbox seems to result
in a wider dynamic range with a bit less distortion. Overdoing Sliding Time
Scale/Pitch Shift will create distortion, and it’s a horsepower hog—on old,
slow PCs it will take a long time.
226
Chapter 11

WahWah
Just like the name says, this makes your signal go “wah-wah.” Maybe I’m eas-
ily amused, but exaggerated WahWah effects applied to nice, ordinary mu-
sic tracks crack me up every time. On a more serious note, the WahWah ef-
fect makes an instrument sound like a voice. One of the most famous uses
of this effect is on Frampton Comes Alive for the song “Do You Feel Like We
Do.” (Admit it, you still own the vinyl double set and take it out and play it
once in a while. Don’t be embarrassed; it’s a great album, and Mr. Framp-
ton is a ﬁne guitarist.) Another standout use of WahWah is in Steely Dan’s
“Haitian Divorce” on the Royal Scam album, which gives the lead guitar a sar-
castic voice.
WahWah is similar to phase shifting. It uses LFO to set the oscillations
per second, from 0.1 to 4 Hz. That’s right, point one to four, a lot slower
than the Phaser effect.
LFO Start Phase and Depth are just like the settings in the Phaser effect.
Figure 11-31: The WahWah
effect makes instruments “talk”
and plays tricks with left-right
channel balance.
Resonance accentuates the higher fre-
quencies; 1 is least effect, and 10 is the most
pronounced.
Wah Frequency Offset emphasizes the
lower frequencies at lower percentage settings
and emphasizes the higher frequencies at the
higher settings. It will cause clipping if you go
too high (Figure 11-31).
The WahWah effect adjusts the phase of
the left and right channels on a stereo track,
making the track sound as though it travels
back and forth between the speakers.
Now let’s take a look at ﬁnding and manag-
ing Audacity plug-ins in Linux and Windows.
Linux Plug-ins
There are two types of Audacity plug-ins that work in Linux: LADSPA and
Nyquist.
Linux LADSPA Plug-ins
There are several specialized Linux distributions for multimedia produc-
tion, such as 64 Studio, dyne:bolic, Planet CCRMA (which is a special set of
packages for Fedora and CentOS), and Ubuntu Studio. There are two ways
to install LADSPA plug-ins. One way is to use your Linux package manager.
64 Studio includes a bundle of more than 300 plug-ins. Debian and Ubuntu
break them out into separate packages. Here are some of the LADSPA plug-
in packages in Debian and Ubuntu:
•
blepvco (LADSPA anti-aliased, minBLEP-based, hard-sync-capable oscil-
lator plug-ins)
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
227

•
blop (Band-limited wavetable-based oscillator plug-ins for LADSPA hosts)
•
caps (C* Audio Plugin Suite)
•
cmt (Computer Music Toolkit LADSPA plug-in collection)
•
ladspa-sdk (useful LADPSA tools for users and developers)
•
swh-plugins (Steve Harris’s LADSPA plug-ins)
•
tap-plugins (Tom’s Audio Processing LADSPA plug-ins)
•
vamp-examples (audio analysis plug-ins)
Look in the Sound section of the download repositories to ﬁnd these.
Install them via your favorite graphical package manager, or use a command-
line tool like aptitude, for example aptitude install blepvco, or whatever
package name you want.
Here are some of the plug-in packages in Planet CCRMA:
•
ladspa-blop-plugins (Band-limited wavetable-based oscillator plug-ins for
LADSPA hosts)

•
ladspa-cmt-plugins (Computer Music Toolkit LADSPA plug-in collec-
tion)
•
ladspa-mcp-plugins (by Fons Adriaensen; currently contains a phaser, a
chorus, and a moog vcf (voltage controlled ﬁlter))
•
ladspa-ﬁl-plugins (four-band parametric equalizer)
•
ladspa-rev-plugins (reverb based on gverb, plus new features)

ladspa-tap-plugins (Tom’s Audio Processing LADSPA plug-in)
•
ladspa-vco-plugins (anti-aliased dirac pulse oscillator)
•
ladspa, ladspa-devel (useful LADPSA tools for users and developers)
Fedora has a graphical package manager, or you can run yum from the
command line, as in yum install ladspa-blop-plugins.
You can also install individual plug-ins by simply copying them either to
/usr/lib/ladspa/, which makes them accessible to all users on your system, or
to your personal home directory, such as /home/carla/.ladspa, which means
they will be available only to you. All LADSPA plug-ins have an .so extension,
for example gong_1424.so.
LADSPA stands for Linux Audio Developer’s Simple Plugin API.
This is a framework for writing universal plug-ins that work in any Linux
audio application by giving application developers a common, simple, well-
documented application programming interface (API) to support. As a
result, a large number of Linux audio applications support LADSPA plug-
ins: Audacity, Ardour, ReZound, Rosegarden, GNU Sound, and many others.

There are several popular LADSPA plug-in projects:
•
Steve Harris’s plug-ins (http://www.plugin.org.uk/ladspa-swh/docs/
ladspa-swh.html)
•
Tom’s Audio Processing plug-ins (TAP) (http://www.tap-plugins

•
CAPS, the C* Audio Plugin Suite (http://www.quitte.de/dsp/caps.html)
•
Computer Music Toolkit (CMT) (http://www.ladspa.org/cmt/)
Naturally this list shows just a few; there are many more.
LADSPA Version 2 (LV2) is the successor to LADSPA. It is more exten-
sible and more ﬂexible. The Linux version of Audacity supports LV2 as of
version 1.3.6. Visit http://www.lv2plug.in/ to get current information on LV2
plug-ins, such as Steve Harris’s LV2 plug-ins (http://www.plugin.org.uk/lv2/)
and other active LV2 projects.
You can get detailed information on individual LADSPA plug-ins by in-
stalling the ladspa-sdk package. This is the package you need to learn to write
your own LADSPA plug-ins, and it also includes some useful commands for
getting information about plug-ins. listplugins shows all your installed plug-
ins, as this snippet demonstrates:

Linux Nyquist Plug-ins
Nyquist plug-ins also work on Linux and have an .ny extension. You can
download some from the Audacity site (http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/
download/nyquistplugins), and a web search will ﬁnd hundreds more. Install
these by copying them to /usr/share/audacity/plug-ins/ for systemwide usage
or to $HOME/.audacity-ﬁles/plug-ins to keep them all to yourself. The Nyquist
programming language (http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/help/nyquist) is
freely available and open source, so you can write and distribute your own
Nyquist plug-ins to your heart’s content.
Windows Plug-ins
Three plug-in types run on Windows: VST, LADSPA, and Nyquist.
Steinberg’s Virtual Studio Technology (VST) is a plug-in standard in-
vented by Steinberg for its Cubase line of MIDI and audio recording and
production software. Steinberg licenses VST to third-party developers so
they can create VST plug-ins for any host; consequently, VST is the most
widely used plug-in standard. Audacity comes with a basic set such as Gverb,
Tremolo, and Vocal Remover.
VST plug-ins have a .dll extension. The Audacity download page (http://
www.audacity.sourceforge.net/download/plugins) has links to more, plus a di-
rectory of VST plug-ins known to work well with Audacity. Installing these
means simply copying them to \Program Files\Audacity\Plug-ins.
You’ll also ﬁnd LADSPA plug-ins that work in Windows on this page.
Nyquist plug-ins work in Windows as well; again, just copy them to \Program
Files\Audacity\Plug-ins.
The Internet is full of audio plug-ins, and you can use the plug-ins that
come with other audio production software.
Audio Effects Glossary
Audio effects have their own terminology, so let’s take a look at some of the
more common terms you’re going to encounter with audio plug-ins.
All-pass ﬁlter
A ﬁlter that passes all frequencies equally and applies
phase shifting. Reverberation effects use all-pass ﬁlters.
Decay
Decay controls how quickly or how slowly a sound fades away.
Delay
This controls the degree of reverberation and how it sounds,
whether it’s just a bright lively touch or an overdone muddy mess. In
the olden days, this was done with tape loops and changing the spacing
between the recording and playback heads on tape recorders. Now all
230
Chapter 11

you do is move a slider or type a numeric value in seconds or fractions of
seconds.
Four basic audio waveforms
A waveform is a visual representation of
a sound, and the four basic waveforms that are important to audio are
sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle. Figure 11-32 shows them side-by-side,
thanks to Wikimedia. Their shapes pertain to all sorts of advanced math,
which is deﬁnitely beyond the scope of this book and my own tiny math
knowledge. These waveforms are not unique to audio but are used in
many disciplines such as math, physics, electrical engineering, and all
different kinds of signal processing.
Figure 11-32: The four basic waveforms
Harmonics
Harmonics can be thought of as overtones, though some
textbooks say they are not the same and then use a boatload of advanced
math to show why. We’ll keep it at the training wheels level: When you
play a note on a musical instrument, that is the fundamental frequency. This
note may also be accompanied by harmonics, which are other notes that
are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. So, a fundamental
frequency of 100Hz can have harmonics of 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, and
so on. These are numbered in order: fundamental frequency, 2, 3, 4, and
so on. Square waveforms contain only odd-numbered harmonics, while
sawtooth waveforms have both even and odd.
One reason to preserve a wide frequency range (which is controlled
by the sampling rate) is to preserve the harmonics, because even if you
can’t hear the full frequency range, you can hear the harmonics. Narrow-
ing the frequency range loses some harmonics in the range you can hear.
High-pass ﬁlter
This passes high frequencies unaltered, while attenu-
ating lower frequencies that are below the cutoff point. So, you could use
this to tone down boomy bass or unbalanced midrange frequencies.
Low-pass ﬁlter
This allows low frequencies to pass unaltered and at-
tenuates higher frequencies above the cutoff point, which you set. Use
Audacity Plug-ins for Special Effects
231

this to tone down recordings where the higher frequencies sound too
bright or where there is noise such as tape or stylus hiss.
Low-pass ﬁlters are also used in hi-ﬁelectronics to route low-
frequency sounds to subwoofers or to whatever speakers can handle
them.
Reverberation
Reverberation is one of the most commonly applied
effects; it tries to simulate a live sound like we hear in a concert hall or
stage show. Reverb is echo, or sound reﬂections, that occur too quickly
to be perceived individually. This is what gives a piece of music a “live”
sound: When we attend a live performance, the music is reﬂected from
innumerable surfaces all around us. A recording studio is usually a de-
liberately “dead” environment, so there is no natural reverb. So, reverb
is applied to recordings to enliven them and make them sound more
realistic. It is used in live shows to create a bigger, more spacious sound.
You can’t control the acoustics where you perform, but you can do a lot
with your electronics to overcome bad acoustics and to tailor your sound
to simulate different environments.
Stiffness
This tries to replicate the sound of physical objects at differ-
ent levels of stiffness, such as woodwind reeds, cymbals, and gongs.
Wet/dry balance
A dry signal has not yet had any special effects ap-
plied to it; an audio signal becomes wet after effects are applied. Most
plug-ins and hardware special effects mixers allow only a proportional
adjustment; if your wet balance is 45 percent, then your dry balance is
55 percent.

FIX-ITS AND CLEANUPS
Audacity has a number of tools for ﬁxing
defects and cleaning up recordings. As I
keep saying, your best approach is to make
the cleanest recordings you can, because that
is a lot easier than ﬁxing them. There is no TV crime-
show magic; there are limits to what you can do.
However, there is a lot you can do to ﬁx problems, so we’re going to
learn how to do that in this chapter. (If you need a refresher, Chapter 1
covers the basics of using Audacity, and Chapter 2 goes into building a sim-
ple recording studio.)
Split Stereo Tracks
Oftentimes only half of a stereo track will have a defect. So, you should split
the track (Split Stereo Track in the Track menu), apply repairs to each track
independently, and then rejoin them with Make Stereo Track from the Track
menu. Then you’ll have the advantage of the good half helping to mask im-
perfect repairs.

Repeat Last Effect
Note the Repeat Last Effect (CTRL-R) command at the top of the Effect
menu. This is a fast way to apply the same effect with the same settings over
and over. The Effects menu is a bit inconvenient because the effects go away
when you click OK, so when you need the same effect over and over, it gets a
bit tedious to wade through the whole menu again and again.
Noise Removal
There is no Hollywood magic wand like those used by the TV-crime lab
techs who take a damaged lo-ﬁrecording, clean it up, separate all the dif-
ferent elements, and magically isolate a voice print of the bad guy from way
in the background . . . or match the exact waveform of the engine noise of
the getaway vehicle and identify the make and model, identify the rare cus-
tom shoes from the sound of footsteps, or any of the other fanciful things
TV writers come up with. It just isn’t so. Trying to separate multiple sounds
on a single track is like trying to decompile a mixed drink; once everything
is mixed together, there really isn’t a practical way to separate it again. Noise
removal is always a compromise with its side effects, and that is why record-
ing studios use multitrack recorders in soundproofed rooms—because get-
ting a clean recording is always better than trying to clean up a mucky one.
However, sometimes unwanted noises sneak in, and you don’t have the
luxury of redoing the recording. Audacity’s Noise Reduction effect works
pretty well when the noise is distinctly different from what you want to keep
and you have a sample of pure noise to build a noise proﬁle. A common
example is the stylus hiss or turntable rumble from a vinyl record album.
These are easy to clean up: First select a section of just the hiss or rumble,
then click Effect > Noise Removal > Get Proﬁle to create a proﬁle of the
noise. Make sure nothing but noise is selected and make it as long as pos-
sible, up to 30 seconds. Even 5- to 10-second proﬁles will work, but longer
ones are more accurate. When Audacity is ﬁnished building the proﬁle, the
Noise Removal panel will disappear.
The next step is to select the track segment you want to ﬁx, select Ef-
fect > Noise Removal, and click OK. It is better to apply Noise Removal as
surgically as you can because it alters your recording. The difference might
not be obvious unless you’re listening for it, but it does make perceptible
changes to the parts you want to keep.
If you don’t like the results, press CTRL-Z to undo, change some settings,
and try it again. The default noise reduction level is −24 dB, which means
frequencies identiﬁed as noise are attenuated by −24 dB. If this removes too
much of the recording, set a higher decibel value, such as −20 dB, and try
it again. A trick that often works well to reduce bad side effects is to go back
to your noise sample, decrease its amplitude a few dB, create a new proﬁle,
and try again. Chances are you won’t be able to erase the noise completely
because doing so may erase things you want to keep, but you can lower it to
where it’s not so noticeable.
234
Chapter 12

The Frequency Smoothing slider is more surgical at smaller values and
affects a wider range of frequencies as you move the slider right to set larger
values. Try smaller values ﬁrst, because they’ll affect less of your recording.
The Attack/decay time slider determines how fast the Noise Removal
effect responds to change in the audio signal. For noise that is fairly steady,
use a larger value. If the noise ﬂuctuates rapidly, then use a smaller value for
a faster response time (Figure 12-1).
Figure 12-1: This shows some gentle Noise Removal
settings: Frequencies identiﬁed as noise are reduced by
19 dB, frequency smoothing is narrow, and attack and
decay times are moderately slow.
Normalization
The Normalize effect (Effect > Normalize) is the workhorse of many a dig-
ital recording studio, because it is common to record to a peak of −12 dB
or lower, sometimes all the way down to −24 dB. Normalization is usually
the last step before export to bring your recording up to a higher peak vol-
ume level. Digital audio has such a wide dynamic range that you can record
to conservative peak levels to avoid distortion and then later normalize your
tracks to bring the peak levels up to a comfortable playback level.
Normalization is also used to bring multiple tracks up to the same peak
volume level. Do not use Normalize if you want to preserve the relative vol-
ume levels of different tracks. For example, if you have one track that peaks
at −6 dB and another one that peaks at −12 dB and you want to keep the
6 dB spread, don’t use Normalize; use Amplify. With Amplify you can raise
or lower them a set amount, for example +3 dB, which would raise them to
−3 dB and −9 dB, respectively. But if you want both tracks raised to a peak
of −3 dB, then Normalize is the tool for the job.
Fix-its and Cleanups
235

Always leave “Remove any DC offset” checked, because DC offset is not
something you want to keep. If there is any DC offset, this indicates that
your mean amplitude is not zero. A little bit of offset is no big deal, but if the
offset is big enough, it will mess up your dynamic range, and it could even
cause some distortion (Figure 12-2).
DC offset is short for DC offset from zero. DC originally meant direct cur-
rent, but now it applies to any waveform representing any type of signal. Fig-
ure 12-3 shows the before and after: The track on top is the original, unnor-
malized track with a bit of DC offset, and the bottom track is normalized and
has no DC offset.
Figure 12-2: Always check “Remove any
DC offset” and “Normalize maximum
amplitude to” and set a maximum decibel
value of zero or less.

after: a bit of DC offset on

Remove Clicks and Scratches
Audacity offers a couple of fast ways to clean up a scratchy recording of a
vinyl LP. Digital recordings can also pick up clicks from various sources.
The ﬁrst of these is Click Removal: It’s not as reliable as manually correct-
ing scratches, but it’s fast and pretty good.
Click Removal
The Click Removal effect (Figure 12-4) looks for spikes in the waveform that
are typical of pops caused by scratches, deletes the scratch, and then does a
bit of interpolation to reconstruct the waveform. The Select Threshold
Figure 12-4: The Click Removal effect
takes only two settings.
setting determines the sensitivity for de-
ciding when a spike is a scratch; it uses
an algorithm that compares the audio on
both sides of the spike to ﬁgure out what
part is the scratch and what part is the
good audio. Its value is the square of the
required ratio between the amplitudes
inside and outside the loud section. In
other words, smaller Select Threshold
236
Chapter 12

values are more sensitive, and larger values are less sensitive. Higher sen-
sitivity means it may alter peaks that are not clicks, and a too-low Select
Threshold will miss some clicks. The Max spike width determines the max-
imum length of a segment, in milliseconds, that the Click Removal tool will
operate on.
Figure 12-5:
Here is a click
that is less than
3 ms long.
To get an idea of the Max spike width value to use,
ﬁrst set the Selection Start value on the Selection toolbar
to Length, and set the time parameter to hh:mm:ss + milli-
seconds. Then zoom in on a click in the waveform and se-
lect it, and you’ll have its length in milliseconds. The Max
spike width should be large enough to include some good
audio samples on both sides of the click so that it will have
enough good audio to compare to. Figure 12-5 shows a
spike that is less than 3 ms long. I usually stick with the de-
fault of 20 ms, which gives good results most of the time.
Loud, obvious scratches are the easiest. The Click Re-
moval effect doesn’t handle sections of light, crackly static
very well; the Noise Removal effect is better for this. Click
Removal is fast and pretty good, but it’s not 100 percent,
and it may mistake percussion effects for scratches.
Repair
Figure 12-6: A brief clipped segment
smoothed over with the Repair effect
The Repair effect is my preferred tool
for ﬁxing scratches. It has to be applied
manually, one scratch at a time, but it
does a great job. Zoom in until you can
precisely select a region no more than
128 samples long, and then select Ef-
fect > Repair. It will delete the selection
and then use interpolation to smoothly
ﬁll the gap. It’s a great tool for all kinds
of surgical ﬁxes: clicks, scratches, pops,
and short clipped segments. Figure 12-6 shows a before and after repair of a
clipped segment.
Draw Tool
Figure 12-7:
Smoothing out a
click with the Draw tool
The Draw tool (Tools toolbar) gives you ultimate con-
trol of repairs at the sample level. First zoom in far
enough to see the individual audio samples. The cur-
sor changes to a little pencil, and then you can use
it to smooth out the contours of the defect to make
it less noticeable. The sound itself doesn’t change
because you’re just making it quieter, as Figure 12-7
shows.
Fix-its and Cleanups

Truncate Silence
What if you have a long recording that you want to trim by a few minutes,
without losing any audio? Perhaps you have a recording with a lot of silences
you would like to trim. The pauses between songs are too long, your deep
thoughts are interspersed with long pauses, or you have a sound-activated
recording with a lot of dead air. The Truncate Silence effect will automati-
cally ﬁnd and shorten those silent intervals.
Don’t use the Truncate Silence effect after you have created fade-ins
and fade-outs, because it will wreck them.
Figure 12-8: These settings for Trun-
cate Silence look for silent passages
longer than 800 ms and then shorten
any silence of −40 dB or quieter to
800 ms.
Effect > Truncate Silence has four
settings: Min silence duration, Max si-
lence duration, Silence compression,
and Threshold for silence. The simplest
way to use this effect is to set the min and
max duration to the same values and ad-
just your threshold so that it catches only
silent passages. In Figure 12-8, any silent
passages (−40 dB or quieter) greater
than 800 ms long will be shortened to
800 ms. (1,000 ms is 1 second.)
Don’t set Max silence duration to
zero because it might crash or do some
other unpredictable behavior. The min-
imum I have found to be reliable is 5 ms, though some folks push it down to
1. If you want no silences at all, you’ll have to delete them manually, though
to my ears 1 ms is as good as zero.
Threshold for silence tells it what threshold to use to mark where the
silent passages begin. A value of −35 or −40 dB works well when the silent
passages are really silent; when they’re noisy like on an LP, with stylus noise
between songs or turntable hum, you might have to kick it up to −25 dB.
The Silence compression setting conﬁgures a ratio, rather than a ﬁxed
length of silence duration, so that your silences will vary in length. You might
want to use this to preserve the natural cadence of a speaking voice or to
make a live performance sound more realistic. Suppose your min duration
is 100 ms and your max duration is 5,000 ms. If you set the silence compres-
sion to 4:1, a 10-second silence will then be reduced to 2 seconds. The re-
sults will vary according to the difference between your max duration and
your longest silences. To get a predictable result, you can use Truncate Si-
lence to shorten the longest silences to whatever maximum you want and
then apply it again using silence compression.

Change Tempo
The Change Tempo effect is a great little ﬁx-it when you’re mixing multiple
tracks and the tempo is off by a small bit on any of them. It changes tempo
without changing the pitch. You can apply it to selections, whole tracks, or
multiple tracks. There are a couple of ways to approach this. One is by trial
and error; just ﬁddle with the Percent Change setting until it sounds right.
Figure 12-9: Change Tempo gives you
three ways to correct the tempo, as
well as a Preview button.
Some folks have great ears and can do
this quickly. You can also set the Beats
per Minute (BPM). If your other tracks
follow a known BPM, then use this. If
you don’t know the correct BPM, play a
minute of a track with the correct tempo
and count the beats. I do this with a stop-
watch, and it works great when no one
else is around to bother me and inter-
rupt my counting.
Finally, there is a setting for Length
in seconds. If you know exactly how long
your track or selection is supposed to be,
this is a fast and easy way to set it right
(Figure 12-9).
Change Pitch
Figure 12-10: Change Pitch alters the
pitch without changing tempo.
This changes the pitch without changing
the tempo, so it’s a great little ﬁx-it when
a performer is off-key. You can apply it
to selections, whole tracks, or multiple
tracks. As you can see in Figure 12-10,
it offers several different settings: You
can change keys, for example from A
to C, or by semitones (half steps), exact
frequency, or a percent. If you have a
good ear, the Percent Change slider and
Preview button are probably fastest.
How do you precisely measure pitch?
The Change Pitch effect comes as close
as it can, though you get more accuracy
with an electronic tuner.

Change Speed
I’m sure the Change Speed effect has many practical applications, but I
always seem to end up using it for amusement because it changes both

tempo and pitch, just like messing around
with turntable speeds. So, you can speed
up your audio to play fast and high, like an
over-caffeinated Alvin and the Chipmunks,
or low and slow like Samuel Ramey, the
famous bass-baritone opera singer, on
tranquilizers. It supports the standard
turntable speeds of 33 1/3, 45, and 78
RPM and a range of arbitrary speeds con-
trolled by a slider or by typing in a per-
centage value (Figure 12-11).
Compress Dynamic Range
This is a dynamic range compressor, not to be confused with ﬁle compres-
sion. Dynamic range compression is commonly thought of as “make the
loud bits quieter and the quiet bits louder.” Most compressors only reduce
gain; they narrow the dynamic range by attenuating the louder parts so that
the range between the soft and loud parts is reduced. It is overused and
abused in commercial recordings, which is a shame because it is a useful
effect when it is used carefully and with good purpose. My preference is to
use compression as little as possible, because I think many “ﬁxes” done with
compression are better worked out during recording, with the Amplify or
Normalize effects, or with the Envelope tool.
You can use compression to improve the balance of recordings by reduc-
ing the dynamic range of tracks that are supposed to be more in the back-
ground and not drawing attention to themselves. Apply some compression
to level out changes in volume and maybe lower their overall volume, and
they become good little supporting players. You can tailor recordings for dif-
ferent playback devices and environments. You can apply compression to an
entire recording or to individual tracks or parts of tracks.
For example, if you want background music for playing in a noisy en-
vironment, compressing its dynamic range will make it easier to listen to
because you’ll have a more consistent volume level, rather than having un-
expected peaks interspersed with inaudible passages. A podcast with sev-
eral different people speaking will beneﬁt from careful volume control and
compression, especially when you’re recording people who are not experi-
enced with talking into microphones and who don’t speak at a consistent
level. For this kind of recording, you’ll get best results by manually adjust-
ing the amplitude until it’s as consistent as you can get it (the Envelope tool
is great for this) and then applying some careful compression to the ﬁnal
mix for a last bit of polish. Adjusting voice tracks can take a fair bit of ﬁness-
ing, because some voices sound louder even when they’re not. You should
also keep in mind how your audience is likely to listen to your recording—if
240
Chapter 12

they’re at work or listening on earbuds or listening to something designed to
soothe them to sleep, be kind and don’t surprise them with sudden spikes in
volume.
Compression can smooth out uneven volume levels caused by an inex-
perienced performer or one who is having a bit of an off day. For example,
your bass guitar player is tired and hits some notes too hard and some not
hard enough. Or your singer has bad mic technique and moves around too
much, so she fades in and out. Maybe you have a vocalist or other soloist
who needs to stand out from the mix, so applying a bit of careful compres-
sion to their track and then increasing the amplitude will push them to the
front.
Most compressors make your selection quieter, so you may have to use
the Amplify or Normalize effect after applying compression.
NOTE
Apply dynamic range compression conservatively, because when it is overdone, it can
create a bellows effect, with the volume rising and lowering on a regular beat. Another
side effect is raising your noise ﬂoor, because noise becomes relatively louder along with
the quieter passages. Yet one more side effect is giving greater emphasis to background
sounds, such as audience noise. Too much compression can introduce distortion.
How Much Dynamic Range?
So, what is a good dynamic range to aim for when you’re applying dynamic
range compression to a recording? The deﬁnitive answer is “It depends.”
First let’s talk about what is possible and what we hear, and then we’ll look
at some examples for various situations.
Human hearing can perceive a range of roughly 120 dB. The maximum
real-life dynamic range in digital audio is about 115 dB. The dynamic range
of a CD is about 96 dB. Vinyl LPs can deliver as much as 60 dB. A live sym-
phony might encompass 80 dB. A comfortable listening range for most folks
is going to be narrower than that, more like 20 to 30 dB, which is still a nice
wide range. What works for you might take some trial and error. My own
rule of thumb is under ideal listening conditions, at home using my good
stereo hi-ﬁ, without distractions or people talking to me, I’m comfortable
with a dynamic range of no more than 50 dB. And that’s when I’m in the
mood for a dramatic opera or symphony or a raucous live rock show. Most
of the time I prefer something a little quieter.
Sometimes you hear new things in familiar recordings when you nar-
row the dynamic range, because this “raises” the quiet parts. (It’s all rela-
tive; reducing the gain on the louder frequencies makes the quieter ones
sound louder.) You might hear feet hitting piano or drum pedals, perform-
ers muttering asides, more nuances in quiet parts—you just don’t know until
you try.
You can easily experiment in Audacity to get a feel for different dy-
namic ranges by recording a simple test ﬁle and then using Effect > Am-
plify to set different parts of it at different dB levels. Figure 12-12 shows
a simple recording where, starting at −50 dB, each 10-second segment is
10 dB louder until it reaches the maximum of 0.

Figure 12-12: A simple dynamic range test: Starting at
−50 dB, each 10-second segment is 10 dB louder.
Modern popular music is typically mashed into a 5 dB or even smaller
range, at peak amplitude or over, which is a horrible thing to do to good
music. In many modern recordings and remastered old recordings, the dy-
namic range is so narrow that it’s like pushing everything to the redline.
There are no quiet passages, no nuance, and no contrast; it’s just one loud
schmear. It destroys nuance and ﬂavor. The reasons for doing this are a
splendid combination of simplicity and stupidity—when we hear two record-
ings at different volume levels, our initial impression favors the louder one
as sounding better. It’s also used to make a track stand out from the pack
when it’s played on radio or TV or in a public place. But that hardly works
anymore since they all do it.
The end result is compressing the life out of a recording. It’s aural junk
food—sure, that ﬁrst hit of a candy bar or potato chip, or whatever your
particular favorite goody is, is mighty nice. But you can’t live on junk food,
and it soon becomes unsatisfying. It’s the same way with overdone compres-
sion; that ﬁrst impression might be “the louder one is better!” But after a
few minutes of listening, most folks change their minds and prefer a better-
engineered recording. Even if you’re not consciously aware that a recording
has been butchered beyond hope with compression, you’ll likely experience
fatigue and get tired of listening. A web search on loudness wars will return a
lot of interesting information.
You can see this as well as hear it by ripping a song from a music CD,
importing it into Audacity, and viewing the waveform. Figure 12-13 shows
a selection from Rickie Lee Jones’s “The Magazine”; compare this to any
Top 40 contemporary CD. “The Magazine” is a wonderful work that rewards
attentive listening on a good sound system, and you can see in the waveform
that it has not been compressed into a useless tiny dynamic range, nor have
all the levels been maxed out. In fact, it doesn’t come anywhere near the red
line. I prefer recordings made with the assumption that I know what to do
with a volume knob.
I won’t give any horrid examples because I’m too chicken to point ﬁn-
gers, but you can ﬁnd plenty with a quick web search and probably in your
own music collection. It’s that same old race to the bottom, the familiar bat-
tle of quality and artistry against pandering to the lowest common denom-
inator. In this modern era, that is lo-ﬁMP3s played on tiny, lo-ﬁportable
devices and computer speakers, and loud systems with horrid powered sub-
woofers that are to music what hot sauce is to food—a little bit adds punctu-
ation and contrast; a big whacking overdose kills off all the ﬂavor and enjoy-
ment and turns it into an act of aggression.

Chapter 12

Figure 12-13: “The Magazine,” by Rickie Lee Jones, was engi-
neered with some actual dynamic range. Note how the peaks are
nowhere near zero, and there is a fair spread between the quietest
and loudest parts of the waveforms.
One more horrid example of dynamic range compression abuse is tele-
vision commercials. They are supposedly not allowed to be louder than the
programming, but they get around this by having no dynamic range at all
but with everything pushed to the maximum. (I think they are louder, too.)
Compressor Settings
Figure 12-14: Audacity’s Compressor
effect is simple, with just a few settings.
That’s enough complaining about
the state of the world. Let’s ﬁre up
Effect > Compressor and learn what
the different settings do (Figure 12-
14). Most times, using compression
is two steps: Apply the Compressor,
and then raise the volume level of
the compressed segment back up to
where you want it.
This is a simple compressor with
only four settings. The pros use ex-
pensive hardware compressors, and
Audacity’s Compressor does not quite
match these in ability. But it’s good
enough for performing basic com-
pression chores.
The Threshold setting deter-
mines the starting point, in decibels,
where the audio signal is attenuated. A threshold of −50 dB means all parts
of the signal with an amplitude of −50 dB and above will be attenuated. This
on most recordings will be everything. Usually you don’t want to compress
everything; you get better results with a light touch and tailoring it for a spe-
ciﬁc purpose.
The Noise Floor setting holds the gain at a constant level on audio
below the Noise Floor setting. If your track has a lot of quiet sections, this
keeps them from being ampliﬁed.
The Ratio setting determines how much compression will be applied.
A 4:1 ratio means an input signal of 4 dB higher than your threshold will
be reduced to 1 dB higher than the threshold. A ratio of inﬁnity brings ev-
erything down to the threshold level. In Audacity’s Compressor effect, the
Fix-its and Cleanups
243

maximum is 10:1. Other compressors go up to 60:1, which in practice is the
same as inﬁnite. The graph in the Compressor gives you a nice visual of this,
showing that low ratios are more gentle and higher ratios result in greater
gain reduction.
Again, my approach is “Less is better.” It’s easy to experiment with this
in Audacity and listen to how your audio quality is affected by different set-
tings. I use compression sparingly, rarely going over a −20 dB threshold
or a 4:1 ratio. If I’m thinking a recording needs more than that, I stop and
think about what it really needs—some careful adjustments with the Enve-
lope tool? Rerecording?
Attack Time determines how quickly the compressor reaches its maxi-
mum effect, and Decay Time determines how long it takes to phase out the
compression. A too-short Attack Time setting could result in some audible
distortion, and a too-long Decay Time might miss some short peaks. You can
get some different effects with different attack times. For example, a longer
Attack Time setting such as 0.5 seconds will not catch and attenuate a sharp
drumbeat, so this adds some punch. A fast Attack Time dampens percussion
and other sharp peaks. You probably want the fastest Attack Time for vocal-
ists, which is 0.1 seconds, unless you’re trying for some unusual effects.
A slower Decay Time can create a long, almost soaring fade-out. This is
a common technique used to extend a guitar note. Audacity’s Compressor
is medium good at this, and it goes up to 10 seconds. If you’re going for a
natural sound, a fast Decay Time is better. Play around with it to see what it
does to different instruments and vocals. For example, a drum track with a
fast Attack Time setting and a slow Decay Time setting will sound interest-
ing, almost backward or echoey, because the beats are not allowed to decay
naturally but are held longer at a louder level.
A common side effect of compression is pumping and breathing. This hap-
pens when you select a high Threshold setting and there is a lot of variation
in the track. The ﬂuctuation of the compressor causes the attack/decay to
become audible. Sometimes this is fun to do on purpose.
Sometimes some odd-sounding artifacts will be appended by the Com-
pressor to the end of your recording. This is a normal by-product of com-
pression, so deal with it by padding the end of your recording with some-
thing you can delete after applying compression.
“Make-up gain for 0dB after compressing” saves a step if you were going
to normalize to zero anyway.
There is a checkbox for “Compress based on Peaks.” When this box is
unchecked, which is the default, the compressor reduces the gain on sounds
above the threshold level. “Compress based on Peaks” raises the gain on qui-
eter sounds that are above the threshold level. I don’t think that it sounds
very good; to me, it’s harsh, and the pumping effect is hard to avoid. But
then it’s your ears that have to be pleased, not mine.

Chris’s Dynamic Compressor
There is another compressor, Chris’s dynamic compressor (http://pdf23ds
.net/software/dynamic-compressor/), that is tailor-made for compressing classi-
cal music in a pleasing way. I think it works great for all kinds of audio and
better than the stock Audacity Compressor effect.
The author, Chris Capel, was inspired to write this compressor because
he often listened to classical music in noisy environments. After spending a
lot of time ﬁddling with the volume controls, which wasn’t very rewarding,
he decided that applying some dynamic range compression to his recordings
was the solution. But the compressors he tried didn’t sound good enough,
so he wrote his own Nyquist compressor plug-in for Audacity. Since it is a
Nyquist plug-in, it will work on Linux, Mac, and Windows; just download
and copy it to your plug-ins directory. It will appear in the Effect menu as
“Compress dynamics.” It has good instructions right on the plug-in itself, as
Figure 12-15 shows.
Mr. Capel is continually changing and improving his plug-in, so you
can keep up by visiting his website. Figure 12-15 shows the simple view. There
is also an advanced view that displays all the options, shown in Figure 12-16.
To get the advanced view, open the plug-in ﬁle compress.ny and follow the in-
structions. This exposes the advanced parameters Attack and Release speed
and Attack and Release exponent. It’s super easy, because all you do is move
a few semicolons.

Chris’s compressor

What sets Chris’s compressor apart is that it looks ahead and adjusts
the gain in anticipation of what is coming next. Most compressors do not
do this but rather react to changes in volume, so there is always a bit of lag.
Sometimes this results in a loud peak abruptly reduced or, worse, some dis-
tortion. Chris’s compressor operates more smoothly and handles percus-
sion and other loud transient events gracefully. It is worth reading the com-
ments on his web page, and he includes some audio samples. The source
ﬁle, compress.ny, is a plaintext ﬁle and contains useful information.
Chris’s compressor is a nice piece of work, so let’s review its options.
Compress ratio operates differently from compression ratio settings on
most other compressors. It works two ways: dynamic compression and dynamic
expansion. Values range from −0.50 to +1.25. Negative values make the quiet
frequencies quieter, which is called dynamic expansion. Positive values reduce
the gain on the louder frequencies, which is called dynamic compression.
The default of 0.5 is pretty nice. It preserves a lot of the original dy-
namic range and sounds natural. According to some posts in the Audacity
forums, 0.77 matches the NPR radio station KPCC Pasadena. So if you want
to be like KPCC Pasadena, now you know how.
Release speed is like the Decay Time setting in the Audacity compres-
sor, controlling how quickly the compression is phased out. Values are in
milliseconds, so fewer milliseconds equal a faster release speed.
Attack speed is similar to the Attack Time setting in the Audacity com-
pressor, controlling how quickly the compression is applied, until it reaches
its peak ratio. If your recording has a lot of rapid peaks, you probably want
a faster attack speed to catch them. However, you can add some punch to
drumbeats, for one example, with a slower attack time so that they are not
compressed as much. Generally, music has faster increases in volume than
decreases, so to keep pace with the music, attack times should be faster, and
release times should be slower.
The effects of the release and attack speeds are more subtle than their
counterparts in the Audacity compressor and less prone to introducing typi-
cal compression artifacts.
Compression hardness controls how quickly compression is applied and
released. A higher hardness value equals slower attack and release speeds,
and a lower value is a faster, more aggressive attack and release. This appears
only in the simpliﬁed view and is like a shortcut for setting the release and
attack speeds, except you can’t adjust them individually.
Floor sets a ﬂoor, or noise gate; the default is −32 dB, which means
nothing below −32 dB is changed. Use this setting to deﬁne a range of the
quieter frequencies that won’t be changed. You might want to do this if you
have a some low-level background noise you don’t want ampliﬁed or you just
don’t want the quieter frequencies altered.
Noise gate falloff takes values from −2 to 10. Positive values reduce
the gain on everything below your Floor setting, and higher values reduce the
gain to a greater degree. Negative values do the opposite and boost frequen-
cies that are below your Floor setting. I usually leave this at zero so it does
246
Chapter 12

nothing, though occasionally I will use it to boost the lower frequencies a
little bit.
Maximum amplitude raises the amplitude after compressing, so you can
save a normalization step. It is not a decibel scale, so it may take a bit of trial
and error to get it right. (I think it’s easier to just apply normalization.)
Attack and Release Exponents take values from 1 to 6, with 1 meaning
do nothing and 6 meaning do the most. What do these do to your record-
ing? They work in concert with your Attack speed and Release speed settings
to control the responsiveness of the compressor. Mr. Capel advises that the
default values of 2.00 and 4.00 should give pleasing results most of the time.
Chris’s Compressor doesn’t remember your last settings after you close
Audacity but instead reverts to the defaults in compress.ny. If you ﬁgure out
some different settings that you like better, you can make those the defaults
by editing compress.ny. Here are some settings as they appear in the ﬁle:
;control compress-ratio "Compress ratio" real "" .5 -.5 1.25
;control floor "Floor" real "dB" -32 -96 0
The ﬁrst numbers are the defaults, and the second set of numbers are
the minimum and maximum values. So if you prefer 0.6 as the default for
the Compress ratio and −25 for the Floor setting, change them like this:
;control compress-ratio "Compress ratio" real "" .6 -.5 1.25
;control floor "Floor" real "dB" -25 -96 0
Leveller
Figure 12-17: Here is the Leveller ef-
fect at moderate settings: a Moderate
Degree of Leveling, which reduces
loud parts and ampliﬁes quiet parts,
and a Threshold for Noise of −20 dB,
which is very conservative.
The Leveller effect is a sort of dynamic
range compressor that reduces loud fre-
quencies and ampliﬁes quiet frequencies
(Figure 12-17). Careful manual adjust-
ment of amplitude, compression, and
normalization gives better results than
using the Leveller effect. Leveller is sim-
ple and fast, but it also introduces notice-
able distortion as you apply higher de-
grees of leveling. Why use it? It’s fast and
easy. It sounds decent on spoken-word
recordings and works best on ringtones.
For ringtones, try a Moderate degree
of leveling and a Threshold for Noise
setting of −40 dB. This will ﬂatten the
whole waveform nicely, so it will sound
richer and fuller on tiny phone speakers.

Equalization
An equalizer gives you control over amplitude according to the frequency.
Instead of the usual bass-midrange-treble controls we’re all used to, the
Equalization effect is like having nearly inﬁnite tone controls.
NOTE
The modern trend in tone controls on less-expensive playback devices is to do away
with bass-midrange-treble knobs and replace them with presets like Rock, Classical,
Jazz, and Live. I hate these. I want knobs to twiddle, by dang, not cheapo microchips
with a limited set of somebody else’s notions of what sounds good.
The Equalization effect has useful prefab options and many custom
tweak options. It has preset equalization correction curves for old vinyl and
acetate records, such as RCA 1938 and 1947, Columbia LP and 78, Decca,
and several others. Recordings made before 1955 didn’t follow any industry
standards; only then did the RIAA equalization curve become widely used
and eventually the industry standard.
Equalization curves were invented to overcome the physical limitations
of vinyl and acetate recordings, because the lower frequencies occupy more
physical space on the records. Without applying an equalization curve, the
recordings would be very short, and the record would be mostly bass grooves
with barely perceptible treble. To compensate, the lower frequencies are
attenuated, and the higher frequencies are ampliﬁed so much that the un-
corrected signal sounds tinny, with hardly any midrange or bass.
NOTE
When you play a record, you can hear the uncorrected signal by putting your ear close
to the stylus.
Your phono gear compensates for this by applying equalization correc-
tion, which is exactly the reverse of the original equalization curve: Lower
frequencies are ampliﬁed, and higher frequences are attenuated. This is
why turntables require a special phono preamp. Adopting the RIAA curve
industrywide meant that all phono gear could then apply the same equaliza-
tion correction.
For contemporary LPs and 45s, all you need is a standard phono preamp.
This is the phono plug-in on your hi-ﬁampliﬁer or computer recording in-
terface. For older records or for custom tweaks on modern vinyl, you can
use a standard nonphono preamp to get the uncorrected signal and then
apply the appropriate equalization curve using the Equalization effect. Or
customize it to suit your own tastes. Once you have a custom curve tweaked
to your satisfaction, use the Save As button to preserve it.
Try some of the equalization presets to get different effects. For exam-
ple, some folks love that old AM radio sound, and now you have an easy way
to replicate it with the amradio curve. Figure 12-18 shows what it looks like,
and as you can see, it must be nostalgia driving the fondness for that old AM
radio sound, because it discards everything outside the 100 Hz to 6,800 Hz
range.

Figure 12-18: The AM radio sound, still beloved by many, is
a very squished equalization curve.
The Equalization window opens small, so you might want to lengthen
and widen it to expand the scales and give yourself some working room. The
sliders on the left let you zoom in on the decibel range you want to work
in. Figure 12-19 shows the Draw curves view, and Figure 12-20 shows the
Graphic EQ view. Draw curves gives you a dynamic range of 120 dB to play
with, while Graphic EQ is limited to 20 dB. If you mess up and want to start
over, click the Flat button.

side the frame to get rid of it. Control points can move in any direction.

The Graphic EQ sliders can be moved in several differ-
ent ways. You can grab them with the mouse. You can click
above or below the slider knob, and this moves it ﬁrst 8 dB
and then in 4 dB increments. Using the arrow keys moves it
1 dB at a time, and SHIFT-click moves it 0.1 dB. Hovering the
cursor over the knob shows your precise frequency and dB
values (Figure 12-21).
The Linear frequency scale setting, when you’re in the
Draw curves view, changes the scale from the default loga-
rithmic view to linear. Use the logarithmic view when you
want to see the lower frequencies in more detail and the lin-
ear view when you want to see all frequencies represented
equally. The logarithmic view is closer to how we actually
perceive sounds.
There are two colored lines in the graph: a thick blue
line and a thin green line. The blue line is the one that you
manipulate, and the green line shows the actual equalization
curve. If they diverge, that is because you are trying to make
your curve too steep. Either adjust your curve or try a larger
length of ﬁlter. This controls the number of samples that Audacity operates
on at a time. The default value of 4,001 should work ﬁne most of the time.
A smaller value produces a smoother curve and might sound better, though
you’ll need good ears and good gear to hear the difference.
You can go over 0 well into the +dB range, and this is okay because it’s
not the same scale as in the track waveforms. It shows how many decibels of
gain you’re applying (or attenuation). The RIAA curve applies nearly 19 dB
250
Chapter 12

of gain to the 20 to 40 Hz range, for example, with no ill effects. But you
must still be careful to not create distortion by going too high, and only trial
and error will show you where this is on a particular recording. Click View
> Show Clipping in the track you’re working on to quickly see whether you
overdid it, because this will mark any clipping with red bars.
Fix Timing and Latency Errors
When you use the Time Shift tool, it’s easy for tracks to become unsynchro-
nized. Suppose your tracks are all over the place and you want to reset all
them to start at zero. Select all the tracks, and then select Tracks > Align
Tracks > Align Tracks Together. Then select Tracks > Align Tracks > Align
With Zero. You could also select Tracks > Align Tracks > Align With Cursor
to line them up at any arbitrary point.
This won’t work if you have Link Tracks activated, which is indicated
by a depressed Link Tracks button. Link Tracks may not be present in your
version of Audacity; see the table of toolbuttons in Chapter 1 to learn more.
The Time Shift tool is a fast and easy way to move a track or a clip for-
ward or backward in time. Simply click the Time Shift button in the Tools
toolbar, and the cursor changes to a double horizontal arrow; drag your
tracks or clips right or left. You can also drag clips to other tracks.
Another way to move a track or clip a precise amount is to prepend it
with silence. Click at the point you want the silence to start, select Generate
> Silence; enter the duration in seconds, milliseconds, samples, or frames;
and then click OK. This will push the track to the right, which is like moving
it backward in time.
When you are overdubbing, latency is always a problem. Audacity auto-
matically time-shifts overdubbed tracks to compensate for latency. The de-
fault latency correction value is −130 ms, which probably is not correct for
your system. You can adjust the latency correction value in the Edit > Pref-
erences > Recording > Latency correction dialog.
How do you know the right latency correction value to use? One way is
trial and error. A more precise method is to use a loopback cable. You need
a cable to connect your playback output to your recording input. On an in-
ternal sound card, this is easy—line out to record in. For other recording
interfaces, such as USB or FireWire, you’ll have to ﬁnd the correct type of
cable and sort out your outputs and inputs.
Then set Latency Correction to 0. Make sure that the “Snap To” check-
box on the Selection toolbar is not checked. Select the Length radio but-
ton on the Selection toolbar and set the time parameter to hh:mm:ss + milli-
seconds.
Next, generate a metronome track 60 seconds long, 180 beats per second.
Then in the Transport menu, check the “Overdub” checkbox, select
your recording interface for both the playback and recording devices on the
Device toolbar, and press the Record button. You should see something like
Figure 12-22.

When you’re ﬁnished recording, zoom in until you can select the gap
between a click on the top track and the its corresponding delayed click
on the bottom track. If you’re not comfortable using the mouse, use the
SHIFT and arrow keys to mark the selection. (Use the arrow keys to move
back and forth and up and down, and use SHIFT and the arrow keys to se-
lect.) You will see something like Figure 12-23. This shows a latency of
177 ms, which is a lot.

If you change your recording interface, you should repeat the latency
tests, because different devices have different latencies.
Analyze Menu
The Analyze menu contains tools for analyzing your audio. I’ll go over two
of them that I think are fairly useful, Plot Spectrum and Silence Finder.
Plot Spectrum makes a nice colored graph showing the amplitudes of
different frequencies. It has all kinds of different algorithms and functions
to choose from. I ignore most of these and use a Hanning window, Spec-
trum algorithm, and 512 or 1024 Size. A smaller Size value shows more de-
tails. The option that is meaningful to me is Axis. Axis offers the standard
choices of Logarithmic or Linear view. When I use Plot Spectrum, I’m look-
ing for obvious indicators, not molecule-sized differences.
One handy use of Plot Spectrum is to measure your ambient noise. You
can get an idea of your ambient noise level with the Input Level Meter in
the main Audacity window, but Plot Spectrum gives you a lot more informa-
tion. Set up your mics as usual, and then select Transport > Timer Record
to record a 20-second sample. Plot Spectrum analyzes only 23.8 seconds at
a time, so you could even set the timer to record 23.8 seconds. Figure 12-24
shows a graph of an ambient noise recording; hovering the cursor over any
point shows the exact frequency, the note, and the decibels both at the cur-
sor and at the nearest peak, which are displayed under the frequency scale.
252
Chapter 12

Figure 12-24: This Plot Spectrum of ambient noise shows the background noise covers
a wide frequency range from 43 Hz to 22,000 Hz, from −32 dB to −82 dB, with the
lowest frequencies being the loudest.
The peaks in Figure 12-24 indicate some kind of regular noise, and
note how the loudest parts are in the lowest frequencies. Remember, this
measures amplitude per frequency, not time, so don’t read this like a wave-
form. It’s showing you which frequencies are the loudest. Since the lowest
frequencies are the loudest, I can switch to Logarithmic view to get a more
detailed look at the lower frequencies (Figure 12-25).
Figure 12-25: Logarithmic view shows the lower frequencies in more detail.

253

Anything over −40 dB is probably going to be noticeable in a recording,
and now I know to look for the source of low-frequency noises. That turned
out to be the subwoofer of the living room hi-ﬁ. A pretty good level to aim
for is −50 dB, and −60 dB guarantees that no background noises will be au-
dible on your recordings.
Another good use for Plot Spectrum is to get a more precise idea of the
dynamic range of a recording that you are going to apply compression to.
Take readings of several of your highest peaks and lowest lows, and then
you’ll have some actual numbers to help you ﬁgure out what threshold to
use. A good starting point is to split the difference: If your highest peak is
−5 dB and your lowest is −35 dB, try a Threshold setting of −20 dB. Your
own ears will tell you what works; this just gives you a reasonable place to
start.
It can be helpful to generate sine waves at different frequencies just to
get the hang of reading the Plot Spectrum graphs and to try the different
algorithms and windows. Figure 12-26 shows what a 8,000 Hz sine wave at
0.8 amplitude looks like.
Figure 12-26: This “pure” 8,000 Hz sine tone actually includes frequencies from 6,000 to
10,000 Hz, and the frequency range narrows as amplitude increases.
As you can see, our “pure” tone isn’t all that pure, with frequencies rang-
ing from 6,000 Hz to 10,000 Hz. The frequency range narrows as amplitude
increases, from 7,500 to 8,500 at −48 dB to 7,800 to 8,100 Hz at 0 db.

Chapter 12

Silence Finder might be useful when you have a lot of songs on a single
track and want to ﬁnd the song breaks and create labels at the breaks auto-
matically. Then you can select Export > Multiple to break up the track into
individual songs. If you want to use the song names for labels, you will still
have to type them yourself. It doesn’t work very well if the silences are not
clean and well deﬁned. For example, Silence Finder would be a handy time-
saver when you are converting vinyl LPs to CDs, but vinyl records often have
enough noise in the song breaks to confuse it.
You can use Plot Spectrum to get an idea of the volume level in the song
breaks and then set the Treat audio below this level as silence value with less
trial and error. There is a funny little gotcha with this: Don’t enter a minus
sign, because that seems to be applied automatically (Figure 12-27).

CONFIGURING LINUX FOR BEST
AUDIO QUALITY
Linux audio is rather messy yet powerful.
This chapter is a guide to getting everything
working correctly for high-end audio produc-
tion. Linux is a wonderful multimedia platform:
It is stable, it is ﬂexible, and if you use a lightweight
graphical environment, you’ll get better performance
out of modest hardware. Although Linux audio has
some rough edges, it is advancing rapidly, and it has
its own universe of sophisticated audio software.
You can use whatever Linux distribution you want, because you can cus-
tomize any Linux distribution to serve as your recording studio, depending
on what hoops you’re willing to jump through. The most important things
you need, aside from Audacity and other audio software applications, are a
real-time preemptible kernel for lowest latency and a few system conﬁgura-
tion tweaks. You can conﬁgure and tune your favorite Linux distribution, or
you can use one of specialized Linux distributions for multimedia produc-
tion that takes care of the details for you.

I used Ubuntu while writing this book because it was the ﬁrst distribu-
tion to bundle the FFADO drivers for FireWire recording interfaces. (I have
the excellent Focusrite Safﬁre Pro 26 I/O for multichannel recording.) Fire-
Wire recording interfaces are great performers, but they present some spe-
cial driver problems, so if you don’t have one, don’t worry about ﬁnding a
distribution that includes FFADO. You can always add it later anyway.
NOTE
The most important step is careful selection of your audio interface. Choose one that
is well-supported on Linux. Life is too short to waste on something that doesn’t want
to work right. Visit the ALSA Sound Card Matrix (http://www.alsa-project.org/
main/index.php/Matrix:Main) to ﬁnd supported sound cards. Also check out
Appendix A for hardware information.
Using Distributions with Real-Time Kernels
If your particular Linux distribution packages a real-time kernel, that takes
care of the biggest hurdle. What is a real-time kernel? This is a kernel where
real-time scheduling and real-time preemption are conﬁgured to favor audio record-
ing for the lowest possible latency. Latency is inherent in computers because
modern CPUs use preemptive multitasking; they perform one task at a time but
switch back and forth between tasks so rapidly that they appear to be per-
forming multiple tasks at once. Multicore CPUs smooth out this switching,
but they still need help from the Linux kernel.
Because the Linux kernel continues to develop at warp speed, some
folks are saying that a special real-time kernel really isn’t necessary anymore
because real-time features are integrated into the mainline kernel. You can
get by without one if you strip your Linux system down to the essentials needed
for audio production and use a modern multicore PC, gigabytes of RAM, and
fast hard drives. I’ll stick with real-time kernels for now, because they behave
a little differently from general-purpose kernels.
Real-time preemption controls how tasks interrupt each other to get the
CPU time they need. It’s like a classroom of kids trying to get the teacher’s
attention, and the teacher can deal with only one at a time. A multicore
CPU is like having more teachers. Interrupts are typically milliseconds in
duration, which doesn’t matter when we’re typing a letter or editing a pho-
tograph but is enough to introduce defects into a recording. So, we can con-
ﬁgure Linux to give the highest scheduling priority to audio functions.
There are latencies inherent in the inner workings of the kernel itself,
which in modern kernels have become very small. So, it is possible to tune
a Linux kernel for very low-latency audio recording, down to less than 10
milliseconds. Anything less than 20 is excellent.
Fedora and CentOS users should use Planet CCRMA packages (http://
ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/planetccrma.html). Planet CCRMA
(pronounced “karma”) is a special collection of RPMs for Fedora and Cen-
tOS that includes a real-time kernel, all kinds of audio software, and up-to-
date audio drivers. Just add the Planet CCRMA repositories to your system
and then use Yum to install, update, and remove packages the usual way.

Chapter 13

Arch Linux is a superior audio production platform, and it has its own
special audio repository, ArchAudio. Red Hat, Mandriva, and openSUSE all
package real-time kernels.
Ubuntu (and Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and all the rest of the family) provides
a real-time kernel and related kernel modules; the bare minimum you need
to get started with Audacity are these packages:
•
audacity
•
linux-rt
Once you have an rt kernel installed, add all human users who are going
to be using Audacity to the audio group (in the /etc/group ﬁle). Then add
these lines to /etc/security/limits.conf :
•
@audio - rtprio 99
•
@audio - memlock 3000000
The ﬁrst line gives all members of the audio group the highest schedul-
ing priority. The second value controls how memory is used.
•
rtprio (real-time priority) values range from 0 to 99, with 99 being the
most favorable priority. This is the very front of the line.
•
memlock determines how much RAM the audio group locks up for it-
self, in kilobytes, and prevents it from writing to the much slower swap
ﬁle. My system has 4GB RAM, so I set a limit of 3GB, or 3,000,000KB.
Some how-tos say to set this to unlimited. This is a bit controversial, be-
cause it seems like common sense to leave some for system processes
and nonaudio applications. A value of unlimited could also result in out-
of-memory errors and interrupt your audio session. Some users report
that setting any memlock value makes no difference.
Many how-tos also say to add one more line: @audio - nice -19. This isn’t
necessary because the rtprio function takes care of scheduling priority. It
doesn’t hurt anything to try it for yourself.
Then reboot to your new kernel. Note that if you are already running
your rt kernel, all you need to do to activate your new group membership
and changes to limits.conf is to log out and then log back in. Then verify
your audio group membership:
$ groups
carla adm disk dialout cdrom audio plugdev lpadmin admin
Verify that your rt kernel is running:
$ uname -r
2.6.32-24-rt
The rt tells you this is a real-time kernel; this example is from Ubuntu
10.04. You should also keep a stock kernel installed. Using a different kernel
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
259

is as easy as rebooting and choosing it from your boot menu. It will also
help with troubleshooting, because you can try tasks that are giving you
problems with different kernels to see whether they behave differently.
Specialized Multimedia Linux Distributions
There are several complete Linux distributions that are customized for au-
dio and multimedia production. Some of them run from a CD, DVD, or
USB stick, with a hard drive installation option. You should still verify audio
group membership, /etc/security/limits.conf settings, and a real-time kernel
like we talked about in the previous section.
Here is a sampling of specialized multimedia Linux distributions:
•
64 Studio (http://www.64studio.com/)
•
Ubuntu Studio (http://www.ubuntustudio.org/)
•
dyne:bolic (http://www.dynebolic.org/)
•
pure:dyne (http://www.puredyne.org/)
•
Musix (http://www.musix.org.ar/en/)
64 Studio
64 Studio is a Debian-based distribution for all digital content creation,
and it includes a huge assortment of audio, video, graphics, and publish-
ing software. It supports both 32- and 64-bit architectures and runs on a wide
range of PC hardware. The maintainers aim for stability rather than bleed-
ing edge, so they issue updates conservatively. 64 Studio also builds and sup-
ports products such as the Trinity Indamixx digital audio workstation and
the Lionstracs Mediastation.
Ubuntu Studio
Ubuntu Studio is akin to 64 Studio in having nearly every Linux multimedia
application there is, except that it is based on Ubuntu, which in turn is de-
rived from Debian. Ubuntu is more than warmed-over Debian; the Ubuntu
development teams maintain its own patches and customizations. Ubuntu
Studio uses more up-to-date packages than 64 Studio, so you get newer soft-
ware releases and perhaps newer bugs. As with all things Ubuntu, there is a
large and enthusiastic user base and good community support.
You can also add Ubuntu Studio packages to a regular Ubuntu system.
Run $ apt-cache search ubuntustudio to see your options. The ubuntustudio-
audio and ubuntustudio-audio-plugins metapackages should give you every-
thing you need for audio production, with one important exception: The
linux-rt kernel is not included, so you will have to install it separately.
dyne:bolic
dyne:bolic is a unique software project. dyne:bolic is not based on any other
Linux distribution but is built from scratch from source code. That’s just
the beginning—dyne:bolic operates in its own creative ways. It uses only
260
Chapter 13

Free software as deﬁned by the Free Software Foundation. This is good news
for users who want a system unencumbered by proprietary software. It runs
from a CD and is optimized both for speed and low hardware requirements,
requiring at a minimum a Pentium II 400 MHz computer or an Xbox game
console. You can use it with either a Linux or Windows PC, you can save
your data to a USB stick or local hard drive, and it has a hard drive instal-
lation option. Customization is not as simple as using Yum or Apt to install
new software packages because you have to build a new CD image. It comes
with good documentation and a friendly user community.
dyne:bolic is Rasta (http://www.rastasoft.org/) software. Jaromil, the main
dyne:bolic developer, says this:
But remember there is no Peace without Justice. This software is
about Resistance in a babylon world which tries to control more
and more the way we communicate and we share informations
and knowledge. This software is for all those who cannot afford
to have the latest expensive hardware to speak out their words of
consciousness and good will. This software has a full range of ap-
plications for the production and not only the fruition of informa-
tion, it’s a full multimedia studio and has nothing to envy to other
proprietary systems, because freedom and share of knowledge
are solid principles for evolution and that’s where this software
comes from.
pure:dyne
pure:dyne was initially based on dyne:bolic but has evolved into a blend of
Ubuntu and Debian. It runs from CD, DVD, USB stick, or a hard drive in-
stallation. It is more up-to-date than dyne:bolic and is optimized for modern
i686 processors, though it will also run on older hardware. It is designed to
be user-customizable and comes with tools to create customized images.
Musix
Musix is Debian based, for 32-bit systems. It comes on a live CD or live DVD,
and it also has a hard drive installation option. Musix is also a 100 percent
free operating system. It provides a lightweight desktop environment based
on IceWM and the wonderful Rox ﬁler, so it is suitable for modest hardware.
Building a Real-Time Kernel
If you don’t want to use a multimedia Linux distribution and your favorite
distro does not package a real-time kernel, you can build your own. A com-
plete kernel-building how-to would be a whole chapter by itself, so I’m not
going to try to stuff one into this chapter. You can easily ﬁnd good how-tos;
look for instructions speciﬁc to your distribution.
You’ll need a proper build environment installed, kernel sources, and
a copy of the conﬁguration ﬁle for your current kernel. Once those are in
place, you need the rt patch, which you can get from the mothership of the
Linux kernel, http://www.kernel.org/. Go to the rt wiki at (http://rt.wiki.kernel
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
261

.org/index.php/Main_Page), and look for the “CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT Patch”
download. It must have the same version number as your kernel sources.
Once you have that, apply it to your kernel sources.
In your kernel makeﬁle, set EXTRAVERSION equal to a value that tells you
this is a real-time kernel, such as EXTRAVERSION = -rt. Then if your kernel ver-
sion is 2.6.33.1, for example, your new kernel name will be linux-2.6.33.1-rt.
Now you are ready to conﬁgure your new kernel. Start with your exist-
ing kernel conﬁguration and run the make oldconfig command; you don’t
need to start from scratch just to enable real-time preemption. Review your
kernel conﬁguration and enable Processor type and features > Preemption
Mode (Complete Preemption (Real-Time)), and Processor type and features
> Timer frequency (1000 Hz).
Then ﬁnish conﬁguration, and compile and install your new kernel.
That should be all there is to it, but review the rt wiki to make sure, because
Linux kernel development is a fast-moving target. Keep your old stock ker-
nel installed as well. You can have as many kernels as you want on your sys-
tem, and if anything goes wrong, you’ll have a good kernel to boot to.
Latency Is Not That Scary
Latency is not the great bugaboo that it is sometimes made out to be.
One way to handle latency is to throw horsepower at it. A modern multi-
core CPU, gigabytes of RAM, and fast hard drives can make latency almost
disappear.
If that is not an option, it helps to understand when latency really is a
problem and when it isn’t. It matters when you are overdubbing. And even
here Audacity helps with that, because it has a conﬁgurable latency correc-
tion in the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog. (See Chapter 12 to learn
how to measure and correct for latency.) It matters when you are playing a
software synthesizer or playing any instrument through special effects plug-
ins on your computer: When you press a key or strum a string, you want mu-
sic to come out, not lag. It matters when you are monitoring a recording
session, because you don’t want what you hear to be out of sync.
In the Edit > Preferences > Recording dialog, there is a setting that
affects latency called “Audio to buffer.” Smaller buffers equal lower latency,
but if they are too small for your CPU to handle, you’ll get dropouts.
Latency doesn’t matter so much during mixing or during multichannel
recording where everything is plugged into a good recording interface that
has a direct path to Audacity with no detours. It is more important to have
a stable setup that doesn’t crash in the middle of a recording session. If you
can live with higher latencies in exchange for stability, that is a good trade.
It’s no good pushing latency levels down to the point of instability.
Interrupts are less of a problem when you run a clean system with every-
thing turned off except what you need for audio production. (See “Linux
System Tweaks” on page 287.)
262
Chapter 13

JACK, the Jack Audio Connection Kit, has its own conﬁguration options
for latency and buffer size, which you can read all about in “Using JACK with
Audacity” on page 276.
Sorting Out Linux Audio
In this book we use Audacity with ALSA and JACK. No PulseAudio, OSS,
aRts, ESD, or whatever else might be lurking in the weeds.
The Linux audio landscape has been complicated for some years,
with multiple subsystems and overlapping functionality, and now it is go-
ing through some signiﬁcant changes. There is not a single Linux audio
API that developers can target, but rather they must deal with a herd of au-
dio servers and subsystems: the Open Sound System (OSS), the Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), the Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESD)
on Gnome, the analog Real time synthesizer (aRts) for KDE2/3, Phonon for
KDE4, PulseAudio, and the JACK Audio Connection Kit.
ESD and aRts are entering retirement, so that thins the herd a bit, leav-
ing PulseAudio (which runs on any Unix-type operating system), Phonon
(KDE4) for controlling playback, and JACK for professional audio produc-
tion. ALSA provides a common driver base for all of these that interacts
directly with audio hardware, and it also provides a useful set of user tools,
such as a mixer, device discovery, a simple player and recorder, and a speaker
tester. PulseAudio is ﬁnding its way into many Linux distributions, such as
Ubuntu and Fedora, and it looks like it will become the dominant desktop
audio server.
PulseAudio is a sound daemon, while Phonon is a multimedia API sup-
porting multiple audio frameworks, including PulseAudio. PulseAudio and
Phonon provide playback mixers and routers and networked sound. Many
Linux applications do not have audio device choosers. For example, the
Firefox web browser only uses the default audio device. PulseAudio and
Phonon let you control which audio device Firefox uses. I prefer to turn
PulseAudio off when I’m using Audacity; “Turning PulseAudio and Phonon
Off” on page 285 tells you how to do this.
What about OSS? Some folks prefer it, and you’re welcome to give it a
try. ALSA is better supported in Linux, and it includes OSS emulation for
applications that want OSS.
NOTE
The Adobe Flash Player music player is buggy and unreliable. For example, Pandora
Radio, the wonderful online music broadcaster, relies entirely on Flash. It is a great
service, and I am happy to be a paid subscriber. But Flash Player is an ongoing source
of trouble. It loses its connection to the audio system periodically, and it doesn’t like
changes in device routing, such as when changing from computer speakers to an exter-
nal sound system. When it ﬂakes out, it takes a either a browser refresh or a restart to
get it going again. If you need an audio source for testing, you should look for some-
thing else.
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
263

JACK is a professional-quality, low-latency (meaning it adds no latency
to your sound chain) sound server for connecting audio hardware to audio
production software. JACK does not run standalone but requires alsa-base.
JACK supports multiple audio backends: OSS; FFADO (formerly Freebob)
for using FireWire recording interfaces on Linux; PortAudio, which is a sim-
ple cross-platform audio API; and CoreAudio, the Mac OS X audio API. Au-
dacity uses PortAudio.
Let’s clear up some common confusions regarding PulseAudio and JACK.
They address two different types of usage: PulseAudio is a device chooser
and audio stream router for playback and recording, while JACK is an au-
dio router for high-end audio production. JACK lets you route the output of
multiple audio applications pretty much any way you want, so you can com-
bine different synths and capture audio streams in various ways for recording.
Pulse is CPU-intensive and creates too much latency for overdubbing and
other latency-sensitive tasks, though both issues are improving as Pulse ma-
tures. It works ﬁne for making simple recordings, and Audacity and JACK
both support Pulse. You need the pulseaudio-module-jack plug-in for JACK
support, which should be in your distro repositories.
When do you use JACK? You don’t need it when your recording inter-
face handles all the connections you need for your recording session. If
everything plugs into a single recording interface, just point Audacity to it,
and you’re good to go. Though even here JACK can help by giving you ﬂex-
ible routing options, letting you mix the audio streams in different ways and
making performance adjustments.
You need JACK when you are using a FireWire recording interface. You
need it when you want to incorporate software audio applications into your
Audacity recording session. (JACK has great MIDI support, though Audacity
does not support MIDI.) A simple example that we’ll go into in detail (in
“Using JACK with Audacity” on page 276) is adding the excellent Hydrogen
software drum machine to an Audacity recording session. If you want to use
Hydrogen to create a drum track in Audacity, you need JACK to connect
the two.
Using ALSA
ALSA has two parts: the low-level base that supplies sound card drivers and
interacts directly with audio hardware and a higher-level interface that con-
tains the userland tools. alsa-base and its dependencies should already be
present, but you may need to install alsa-utils to get the userland tools.
alsa-utils gives you alsamixer, aplay, speaker-test, arecord, and number of sound
ﬁles for testing your speakers.
Open a terminal and type in alsamixer to open the mixer console, shown
in Figure 13-1. ALSA runs in the console via an ncurses interface, which
means it is completely keyboard controlled and does not require an X server.
The top-left caption tells you a lot of useful information: your sound card
and chipset, which set of functions you’re viewing, and the values for the
highlighted setting. Use the arrow keys to navigate back and forth. There
264
Chapter 13

are three views: Playback, Capture, and All. Press the TAB key to toggle be-
tween them. Pressing the ESC key closes alsamixer.
Figure 13-1: Using alsamixer to conﬁgure onboard surround sound. On my
system, all of the modules must be active—Surround, Center, LFE, and Side—
for stereo sound to work, even though their volume controls have no effect.
Press the F2 key to see detailed information on all your detected audio
devices, as in Figure 13-2. Note that they are numbered from zero. Use the
arrow keys to scroll up and down, and press the RETURN key to close the in-
formation window.
Figure 13-2: alsamixer queries the /proc ﬁlesystem to show detailed infor-
mation on your audio devices.

265

Figure 13-3 shows the Playback conﬁguration screen.
Figure 13-3: The alsamixer playback screen controls muting and volume on playback
devices.
Setting Recording and Playback Levels in alsamixer
alsamixer only displays functions that your sound card is capable of perform-
ing. Here are the basic alsamixer commands:
•
The little boxes with MM in the playback menu mean those functions
are muted, or disabled. Toggle the M key to mute/unmute, and the MM
turns to 00.
•
00 means zero volume, so use the up- and down-arrow keys to adjust it.
PAGE UP increases volume by 5, PAGE DOWN decreases volume by 5, and
END sets the volume to 0.
•
When there are two channels on one slider, you can adjust each one
independently. Q increases the left channel, and Z decreases it. E in-
creases the right channel, and C decreases it.
•
In the Capture screen, press the spacebar to select the active recording
(Capture) device. There may be more than two options, so press it sev-
eral times to see what your choices are.
•
Press the F1 key to see a Help menu. F2 displays your /proc information,
which shows you what is actually detected and working, as well as device
addresses.
Sometimes you will experience static or too-low volume that is caused by
having unnecessary functions enabled. For example, the Playback screen for
266
Chapter 13

my ATI onboard sound shows a front mic volume control. When this is en-
abled, it causes static. When I’m using headphones, the Headphone control
needs to be turned on, but changing the volume level has little effect, and I
need to use both the Master and PCM volume controls. The Master volume
control is not needed for the speakers, but the Headphone control is. Trial
and error is about the only way to ﬁgure these things out, and lower-end
sound cards are more troublesome and quirky than the better-quality ones.
Master vs. PCM
There is often confusion over Master and PCM playback settings. You usually
need both Master and PCM to enable playback, though sometimes only the
PCM slider has any effect. If the Master slider has no effect, this means ei-
ther there is no hardware volume control built into your sound card or your
sound card driver is lacking this functionality. Master is the master volume
control, and PCM stands for pulse code modulation. Remember “Audio File
Formats and Quality Settings” on page 25, where we learned about convert-
ing analog signals to digital representations? ALSA’s deﬁnition of PCM sorts
it out for us:
Although abbreviation PCM stands for “pulse code modulation,”
we are understanding it as general digital audio processing with
volume samples generated in continuous time periods.
So think of ALSA’s PCM channel as a virtual sound card.
Multiple Sound Cards
If you have more than one audio interface, alsamixer numbers them from
zero. For example, I have both onboard sound and the M-Audio MobilePre
connected to a USB port. The MobilePre is #1, so to control it, I need to
open alsamixer with this command:
$ alsamixer -c1
-c1 means “card number 1.” How do you know what your card numbers
are? One way is to query /proc:
$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 SB
: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI SB
HDA ATI SB at 0xf9ff4000 irq 16
1 MobilePre
: USB-Audio - MobilePre
M Audio MobilePre at usb-0000:00:12.1-1, full speed
Another way is to press F2 in alsamixer (Figure 13-2).
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
267

Adjusting Volume Levels
When you’re adjusting recording and playback settings in Audacity, you can
have alsamixer open at the same time, as Figure 13-4 shows. It’s a fast way
to tweak volume settings and to ﬁnd out what the alsamixer settings actu-
ally control. In this example, a bit of trial and error showed me that the Mic
Boost and the ﬁrst Capture slider controlled the microphone recording vol-
ume and that this sound card has a real stereo microphone input with two
channels. (Remember, the Q and Z keys raise and lower the volume on the
left channel, and E and C control the right channel.)
Figure 13-4: The alsamixer Capture window controls device selection and volume on
recording devices. Here it is tiled with Audacity for controlling the recording volume level.
Even in a simple setup like this, there are multiple recording level con-
trols, both in ALSA and Audacity. Keep alsamixer open for adjustments dur-
ing recording.
NOTE
If you need a good excuse to splurge on a dual-monitor setup, audio production is a
great reason. You can have Audacity, JACK, and alsamixer on one screen and your
other audio applications (like Hydrogen, other synths, special effects) on the second
screen. Nice and tidy, and you don’t have to keep moving things out of the way.
268
Chapter 13

Hardware Testing with alsa-utils
alsa-utils includes some good commands to help you troubleshoot and test
your hardware. Keep alsamixer open to the sound card you are testing so you
can quickly try different settings. The most common cause of no sound is
because it is muted in alsamixer.
NOTE
If you are running the JACK audio server, turn it off for these tests because these com-
mands may not work when JACK is running. It is best to keep tests as simple as possi-
ble in any case.
This is a quick and annoying way to verify that your default sound card
and speakers work. It should generate some white noise:
$ cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp
CTRL-C stops it. A nicer way is to use aplay to play a WAV ﬁle of your
choosing, like this:
$ aplay -t wav violin-summit.wav
-t means “ﬁle type,” and your choices are voc, wav, raw, and au. wav is the
default.
To see the PCM structure and a nice ASCII VU (volume units) meter,
try this:
$ aplay -vv -t wav -V stereo violin-summit.wav

-V stereo means “display stereo VU meter,” which is represented by the
hash marks. These represent the RMS volume levels (root mean square, or
average volume over time), and the percentage values are the peaks. You
can see that this is a stereo CD-quality ﬁle, or 2-channel 16 bits at 44.1 kHz.
What if you have more than one sound card? Use aplay -l to display the
raw ALSA device information for all of your audio interfaces:
$ aplay -l

ALSA devices are named in the format interface:card,device. Sound cards
are numbered from zero. An ALSA interface is a PCM playback or recording
device, a MIDI device, or a control device such as a mixer. The hw interface
talks directly to the kernel, so this is the most direct way to test your audio
hardware. This example sends a WAV ﬁle to the ﬁrst ALSA interface, the
ATI SB onboard sound chipset at hw:0,0:
$ aplay -vv -t wav -D hw:0,0 angeline-the-baker.wav
Sometimes you’ll see an error message like this: Warning: rate is not
accurate (requested = 44100Hz, got = 48000Hz) please, try the plug plugin.
This means use plughw in place of hw:
$ aplay -vv -t wav -D plughw:0,0 angeline-the-baker.wav
hw makes no conversions of any kind—think of it as your literal playback
device. It can do only what the hardware supports, so some audio ﬁles might
sound weird or not play at all. plughw is a special ALSA plug-in that is like hw
with extra powers; it can perform whatever conversions are necessary to play
your ﬁles. aplay supports only voc, wav, raw, or au, so you might as well stick
with WAVs.
270
Chapter 13

This example plays a ﬁle on the second ALSA device, which in the exam-
ple is the MobilePre:
$ aplay -vv -t wav -D hw:1,0 angeline-the-baker.wav
If there were a third audio interface, it would be hw:2,0.
Testing Speakers
The speaker-test command helps you determine whether your speakers are
connected in the correct order. This example tests two-channel stereo:
$ speaker-test -t wav -D hw:0,0 -c2 -l1
speaker-test 1.0.20
Playback device is hw:0,0
Stream parameters are 48000Hz, S16_LE, 2 channels
WAV file(s)
Rate set to 48000Hz (requested 48000Hz)
Buffer size range from 64 to 16384
Period size range from 32 to 8192

Periods = 4
was set period_size = 4096
was set buffer_size = 16384
0 - Front Left
1 - Front Right
Time per period = 2.732753
You should hear a pleasant woman’s voice say, “Front left, front right.”
-c2 means two channels, and -l1 means run the test once.
This chipset supports 5:1 surround sound, so you can test this too:

Notice the clever gotcha: The speaker-test output numbers the speakers
from zero, but for the -s option, you have to start from 1.
-t wav uses the included default WAV testing ﬁle; you might also try pink,
which generates pink noise, and sine, which sounds like the sine wave tones
from way back in the olden days of TV test screens. (Now they use infomer-
cials. I miss the test screens.) You may specify different frequencies (in Hz)
to use with the sine option, like this example that tests the subwoofer with a
nice low 45 Hz tone:
$ speaker-test -t sine -f 45 -D hw:0,0 -c6 -s6
LFE means low frequency effects channel or low frequency emitter. This
is the channel that handles low-pitched sounds ranging from 3 to 200 Hz.
This is not the same as the physical port that you plug a subwoofer into,
because the LFE signal can be routed to any speaker or speakers that sup-
port it.

Testing Recording
aplay has a companion command, arecord. Remember to check alsamixer
for the correct settings, such as capture device and volume controls. If your
computer has both front and rear microphone ports, alsamixer should have
an option to select the correct one. In this example, two audio devices are
detected:

ALSA Applications
ALSA creates a number of virtual interfaces for your sound card called appli-
cations. You can view these with aplay:

Querying Your Sound Card
How do you know what abilities your sound card has, what bit depths and
sample rates it supports, and how many channels? If you have no manual,
you can query the /proc ﬁlesystem to ﬁnd out. Audio devices are in /proc/
asound. You can browse this directory in any ﬁle manager or from the com-
mand line. For example, on my system /proc/asound/card0 is the onboard
ATI chipset. Reading /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 spits out a lot of informa-
tion, and this snippet shows that this chipset supports high sampling rates
and bit depths:
$ less /proc/asound/card0/codec#0
rates 0x5e0: 44100 48000 88200 96000 192000
bits 0xe: 16 20 24

How did I know which /proc ﬁles to read? I tried ’em all. Do not try to
edit /proc ﬁles. /proc is a pseudo-ﬁlesystem that exists only in memory, show-
ing the current state of the kernel and operating system.
Using JACK with Audacity
The JACK Audio Connection Kit is a marvelous creation. Its original cre-
ator was Paul Davis, and now Mr. Davis and a team of developers support
JACK. It is a professional-quality, low-latency sound server for Linux and any
POSIX-compliant operating system such as Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX,
and IRIX. Currently it runs well on Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD.
NOTE
Phonon (in KDE4) doesn’t get in the way when you’re using Audacity, but Pulse-
Audio often does, so see “Turning PulseAudio and Phonon Off” on page 285 to
learn how to disable it.
JACK acts like a switchboard to route audio signals between your audio
hardware and software without adding latency. JACK can interface with only
one sound card at a time, but it can interface with any number of software
audio production applications, as long as they are JACK-aware. If you have a
hardware device that controls all of your audio sources, then you don’t need
JACK. For example, in my little studio, my MobilePre can handle up to 4 in-
puts, and the Safﬁre Pro can handle as many as 26. If everything I want to
record plugs into one of those, I don’t need JACK. But suppose I want to use
Hydrogen, the software drum kit for Linux? This is an excellent, fun drum
synthesizer that is in most distro repositories, and it comes with a batch of
demos so I can immediately start playing with it. How do I connect Hydro-
gen to Audacity? This is where JACK comes in.
The order in which you start your various applications is important.
First get everything running and connected with JACK, and then Audacity
always starts last. It seems we should be able to open Audacity after JACK
is running, connect it to JACK, and then run whatever else we want. Some-
times this works because JACK updates new connections dynamically. But
Audacity can be ﬁnicky, so I get everything else going ﬁrst. Usually every-
thing works ﬁne on the ﬁrst try, but sometimes Audacity throws out an error
message about having the wrong sound device or some other unhappiness.
Closing and reopening it usually takes care of this.
276
Chapter 13

Let’s use the MobilePre, since it is easy and simple. It has two micro-
phones connected for vocal and a guitar, and then we’ll add a nice drum
track. First close all other audio applications, and then start JACK. JACK can
run from the command line or the Qjackctl graphical interface. We’ll use
Qjackctl, which should appear in your system menu as JACK Control (Fig-
ure 13-5).
Figure 13-5: Qjackctl, the graphical JACK controller
If JACK starts up when you open Qjackctl, stop it, and then click the
Setup button. You’ll see a conﬁguration dialog like Figure 13-6.

Check Realtime in the Parameters column if you are using a real-time

If there is a monitoring port on your recording interface, check H/W
Monitor to enable it. Leave everything else in the ﬁrst column unchecked.

In the next column, leave Priority at (default).

Set your sample rate and make sure it agrees with Audacity, Hydrogen,
and any other audio software you are running. It must be a rate that
your recording interface supports.
6.
Periods/Buffer defaults to 2; leave it there for now.
7.
Leave Port Maximum and Timeout at their defaults of 256 and 500,
respectively.
8.
In the third column, choose “alsa” as the driver.
9.
Choose your input and output devices; click the little arrows to the right
to display all of your sound devices.
10. Set the numbers of input and output channels, which are whatever your
audio interface supports. The MobilePre has two channels for both in-
put and output.
11. Click OK, and then click the Start button. It is normal to see a few xruns
at startup. Click the Messages and Status buttons to display everything
you need to know about your JACK session, both good and bad.
Now start up Hydrogen. Figure 13-7 shows what Hydrogen looks like.
Figure 13-7: The excellent Hydrogen drum synthesizer
278
Chapter 13

Hydrogen, like so many good Linux synths, lets you select which audio
interface to use and which audio backend. Go into Tools > Preferences >
Audio System and select JACK. Make sure that the Connect to Default Out-
put Pair option is not checked (Figure 13-8).
Now go to Project > Open Demo and select a demo to play. Click the
Loop Song button (to the right of the Fast Forward button) to keep it going
while you’re testing.
Next, click the Connect button in Qjackctl. Figure 13-9 is the result. The
System clients are the MobilePre channels; System clients always represent
your audio interface, and of course Hydrogen is labeled as Hydrogen. You
should hear a drum track on the playback device selected in JACK. If you
don’t, connect the two Hydrogen out ports to two System playback ports.
You will see lines connecting them.
Conﬁgure your playback device in JACK’s Setup dialog, whether it’s
headphones, external speakers, or something else.
Figure 13-8: Conﬁguring Hydrogen to
use JACK
Figure 13-9: JACK and Hydrogen are
running, and the Connections window
shows that Hydrogen is connected to your
audio interface’s playback ports.
Now open Audacity. Conﬁgure Audacity to use JACK Audio Connection
Kit: Hydrogen as the recording device and press the Record button. You
should see something like Figure 13-10.
Figure 13-10: Audacity is recording the Hydrogen drum track, thanks to JACK.
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
279

Voilà! Audacity is recording Hydrogen! The JACK Connections window
now displays two new PortAudio clients, which are the Audacity recording
inputs (Figure 13-11).
Figure 13-11: JACK connects Hydrogen and the MobilePre
to Audacity. Audacity is represented by the two PortAudio
clients. In this example, Hydrogen is being recorded through
the two PortAudio clients and simultaneously playing back
through the two system playback ports.
Usually the Connections window opens with the necessary connections
in place and dynamically creates new ones on demand. If it doesn’t or you
want to change them, just click a Readable Client, then click a Writable
Client, and then click the Connect button (or Disconnect). You can create
multiple connections to each client.
The MobilePre is a two-channel recording interface that supports up to
four inputs, so when I record something through the microphones, it goes
into the same two-channel stereo track as the Hydrogen drum track.
In some of the older versions of Audacity and JACK, the recording
device selection was not consistent. Sometimes selecting JACK Audio Con-
nection Kit: System worked, and sometimes I had to use JACK Audio
Connection Kit: <something else>, depending on what else I was using.
So, you may have to try a bit of trial and error.
Connecting a FireWire Recording Interface
Figure 13-12 shows a simple example of using the Safﬁre Pro with JACK and
Audacity. You need the ffado driver for Linux (http://www.ffado.org/) to use
a FireWire recording interface, a FireWire adapter on your computer, and
the correct cable to connect your FireWire device. There are two different
FireWire plugs, 4-pin and 6-pin, and you must have the one that matches
your device.
280
Chapter 13

Figure 13-12: The ffado-mixer for the Focusrite Safﬁre Pro I/O 26
This is how I got the Safﬁre Pro working for this example. First I opened
ffado-mixer, which comes with the ffado driver (Figure 13-12).
Then I started Qjackctl, opened the Setup dialog, changed the driver
to “ﬁrewire,” and changed the Interface to hw:0. Then I opened Hydrogen,
set it to use JACK as the audio backend, and then started a demo loop play-
ing. The Safﬁre has headphone-monitoring ports, so I plugged headphones
into the appropriate port and created connections in the JACK connector
to route Hydrogen’s playback to the ﬁrst two Safﬁre input ports, System
playback_1 and playback_2.
Then I opened Audacity last of all. I made sure the sample rate was
the same in ffado-mixer, JACK, and Audacity, and I conﬁgured Audacity to
record four tracks, using the recording device JACK Audio Connection Kit:
System.
Figure 13-13 shows what this all looks like: There are four PortAudio
clients, which means that four recording channels are open in Audacity. Hy-
drogen is using two of them, and I have two mics plugged into the Safﬁre
Pro for recording on the other two.

Creating Persistent Conﬁgurations
In the JACK Setup dialog, you can create and save multiple proﬁles. Make a
conﬁguration; then on the ﬁrst tab enter a name for it in the Preset Name
box, and then click Save. To open a proﬁle, click the drop-down arrow in
the Preset Name box.
The Connections window only displays your current setup and does not
save it, so you must use the Patchbay to create saved connections. Get every-
thing hooked up the way you like in Connections, open the Patchbay, and
282

then click the New button. A little message
will pop up and ask you if you want to save
your current Connections conﬁguration (Fig-
ure 13-15).
Click Yes, and this will automatically du-
plicate the current settings in the Connec-
tions window. You can modify this or accept it
as is and save it with the Save button, giving it
a unique name (Figure 13-16).

for you or save it as is.
JACK Settings
Let’s take a look at the settings in the Qjackctl Setup window in more detail.
•
“Realtime” should be checked when you have a real-time kernel and un-
checked when you do not.
•
Leave “No Memory Lock” unchecked when you have abundant RAM,
but if you’re making do with a lower-end computer, try checking it if
you get out-of-memory errors. This will prevent JACK from locking up
memory for its exclusive use and freeing it for all processes that need it.
•
Checking “Unlock Memory” helps lower-end computers by reclaiming
memory slurped up by graphics toolkits like Qt and GTK, especially if
you are running VST plug-ins under WINE. Leave it unchecked if you
are not experiencing problems.
•
Checking “Soft Mode” tells JACK to ignore xrun errors and keep run-
ning. Use this when you want JACK to keep running no matter what, for
example during a live show. It’s better to track down and ﬁx the prob-
lem, but it’s not always possible, and xruns don’t always translate into
big defects in your recording.
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
283

•
You can check “Force 16-bit” when your audio interface supports only
16-bit recording. It’s not required because JACK uses 32-bit internally,
and it tests 32-, 24-, and 16-bit settings for your input and output devices.
If your interface supports only 16 bits or you want to record at 16 bits,
this will shush the routine error messages in the Messages window.
•
“H/W Monitor” and “H/W Meter” enable hardware monitoring and
metering for devices with support for these functions. For example, the
MobilePre has a zero-latency monitoring port, so this activates it. H/W
Meter is for ALSA devices only, and few recording interfaces support
this feature.
•
The default Priority is 10, and this maxes out at 89. Usually the default is
ﬁne. If you are running a real-time kernel, try setting it to 70 or greater
to see whether it makes any difference.
•
Frames/Period controls your balance between lower latency and few-
er errors. The default is a buffer of 1,024 frames per second sent from
JACK to your sound card, and the lowest possible value that is supported
by PC hardware is 64. For lower latency, you want a lower value. If you
see a lot of xruns in the Messages window, then increase this to a higher
number until you have no xruns. An xrun is either a buffer overrun or
an underrun, and xruns are audible as crackles and pops. On my sys-
tem, JACK performs well at 128 frames, which results in very low latency.
One audio frame is one sample times the number of channels, so a two-
channel recording has two samples per frame. A period is a CPU pro-
cessing cycle, so a Frames/Period rate of 128 results in a buffer size of
128 samples per channel, for a total of 256 samples per period for two
channels. To get the buffer size in bytes, multiply Frames/Period by Pe-
riods/Buffers by 4.
•
The Sample Rate setting must equal your Audacity sample rate and be
supported by your recording interface. Higher sample rates put a heav-
ier load on your CPU and may require higher values in Frames/Period
and Periods/Buffers.
•
Periods/Buffers is an interesting bit of memory management. JACK
divides the memory buffer into periods and transfers data in units of
periods. The default is two periods per buffer. More periods equals
higher latency and greater stability. Try different values in combina-
tion with Frames/Period to get latency down. For example, if it takes
a high Frames/Period value to get xruns down, like 2,048, try increasing
Periods/Buffers to 3 or 4, and try lowering Frames/Period.
•
Every input or output connection is a port. The default is 256 ports,
which is more than enough for most mortals, and you can have as many
as 1,024.
•
Timeout controls how long JACK waits to kill an application during peri-
ods of heavy congestion. The default is 500 milliseconds.
•
The driver is set to whatever driver your recording interface uses. Free-
bob is the old version of the FFADO driver for FireWire interfaces, so
284
Chapter 13

select “ﬁrewire” since Freebob is obsolete (unless you are running an
old system with actual old Freebob drivers). “dummy” is a fake driver for
testing JACK.
•
The Interface drop-down is active only when you select (default), mean-
ing the ALSA default, for your Input and Output devices. Then you have
a few extra choices such as /dev/dsp and /dev/oss. These are really not
relevant in modern Linux systems, but JACK supports them if your sys-
tem supports them.
•
Dither can make 16-bit recordings sound better; it is analogous to anti-
aliasing fonts or dithering in graphical images. Don’t use dither for
higher-bit depths because it is unnecessary, and they will sound worse.
Think of it as blending the rough edges for a cleaner sound. Shaped
dither is considered to be the best, but it is also the most CPU-intensive.
Triangular is a good compromise between quality and CPU cost, and
rectangular is lightweight and makes the smallest alterations. You don’t
have to use dithering, but it doesn’t hurt to try it. Audacity also has dither,
so be sure to use only one or the other.
•
On the Audio menu, you can choose Duplex, Capture Only, and Play-
back only. Usually Duplex works ﬁne, but you can try the other settings
to see whether there are any performance improvements.
•
Pick your Input and Output Devices from the drop-down menus (the
little arrows on the right).
•
Input Latency and Output Latency are for increasing latency. You
might want to ﬁddle with these to bring your Input and Output streams
into synchronization, especially when overdubbing or applying special
effects.
Turning PulseAudio and Phonon Off
PulseAudio can be a stubborn little daemon. The man page says you can
turn it off with the command pulseaudio --kill. But depending on your
particular Linux distribution, it won’t stay killed; instead, it respawns itself.
This is how it works on Ubuntu 10.04: It has a normal init script to start it
at boot, /etc/rc2.d/S03pulseaudio. But when you try controlling this the nor-
mal way, it doesn’t work, because running /etc/init.d/pulseaudio stop doesn’t
stop it. Removing /etc/rc2.d/S03pulseaudio doesn’t prevent it from starting
at boot. Fortunately, I am even more stubborn and have ﬁgured out how to
control stopping and starting Pulse. I don’t want to remove it; I want it to
run when I want it to run. (If you want to remove Pulse, it shouldn’t hurt
anything to do so.)
First look for a graphical control panel for Pulse with an option to dis-
able it. This is missing from my Ubuntu 10.04 installation but present on
Fedora and other distros. If your system has this, it might be all you need.
If there is no graphical control panel with an option to disable pulse,
open /etc/pulse/client.conf, change autospawn = yes to autospawn = no, and set
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
285

daemon-binary to /bin/true. Make sure they are uncommented, like this:
autospawn = no
daemon-binary = /bin/true
Next, to stop it from starting at boot requires several steps. First remove
the relevant /etc/rc*.d/S*pulseaudio link for your usual runlevel or rename
it to a “kill” link. This prevents init from starting Pulse. On my system, that
looks like this:
# mv /etc/rc2.d/S03pulseaudio /etc/rc2.d/K03pulseaudio
How do you know your runlevel? Use the runlevel command:
$ runlevel
N 2
That means runlevel 2, which is controlled by the links (which must be
links to ﬁles in /etc/init.d, not the ﬁles themselves!) in /etc/rc2.d/. Your distro
may have a nice graphical services manager, which is a good thing to use.
On Ubuntu 10.04, there is one more startup ﬁle to dispense with: /etc/
X11/Xsession.d/70pulseaudio. This starts Pulse when a Gnome session starts.
Move this ﬁle to a different directory, like your home directory. Don’t delete
it because you might want it again someday.
Other distros customize Pulse in different ways, so if these instructions
don’t work, then look for help speciﬁc to your distro. There is no shortage
of it because a lot of users are struggling with this. Another little trick, when
you ﬁnd scripts that start PulseAudio, is to change the binary that they call
from /usr/bin/pulseaudio to /bin/true. This is a nice little executable whose
only job is to “do nothing, successfully.” It keeps the scripts happy, and it’s a
convenient placeholder if you ever want to change it back.
Now that you have purged all the startup scripts, how do you stop and
start PulseAudio? It’s as easy as pie:
$ pulseaudio --kill
$ pulseaudio --start
Phonon is a different kettle of clams. Phonon exists only on KDE4, and
it is impossible to remove because virtually all of KDE4 depends on it. It is
not necessary to stop or remove Phonon in any case, because it uses only
a tiny bit of system resources and adds no latency to your audio chain. It
does have one annoying habit—when a sound daemon like Pulse or JACK
takes control of a sound card, Phonon freaks out and emits an error message
about how that sound card is missing, and it wants to remove the sound card
from its menus. Just click Cancel to shush it.

Linux System Tweaks
Linux is a pretty efﬁcient operating system, so you don’t need to go to heroic
lengths to make it get out of its own way. However, there are a few things
you can do to ensure the best possible performance.
High-powered PC hardware is always good and is cheaper than high-
end audio devices. My audio workstation has an AMD Phenom X3 2.4 GHz
CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a terabyte’s worth of SATA II hard drives. Those
extra cores make a nice difference, because even though Audacity is not op-
timized for multicore processors, those extra cores mean faster, smoother
multitasking. I also have an old laptop with a 1.4 GHz CPU, 1GB of RAM,
and a slower hard drive. This handles up to four-channel 16/44.1 recording
capably, but at higher bit depths or sampling rates it tends to stall. I consider
a 1 GHz CPU and 512MB of RAM to be the bare minimum for music record-
ing and editing. For podcasts and spoken-word recordings, you can go as low
as 128MB RAM and a 500 MHz CPU.
Turn off your screensaver and all fancy video effects. All that Compiz-
Fusion bling is pretty, but it gets in the way of good audio. In fact, you should
turn off everything that is not absolutely needed: Don’t run other applica-
tions, and turn off unnecessary services. There usually isn’t too much cruft;
Bluetooth, wireless daemons on systems without wireless devices, and Wa-
com tablet daemons are the most common on-by-default services that most
users don’t need.
Both KDE and GNOME are heavy-duty desktops that feast on CPU and
memory, so you can slim your system down by using a lighter-weight graph-
ical environment such as Xfce, IceWM, LXDE, Fluxbox, or any of the many
other lightweight Linux graphical environments.
Video is the single most demanding system on your PC, so you might
want to upgrade to a better video card. Many lower-end systems use shared
system memory instead of a dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU). In
other words, they use some of your system RAM to process video, and this is
quite a bit slower because it places an extra load on your system RAM and
CPU, both of which are considerably slower than a GPU. GPUs are so much
faster that they are used to build clusters for very fast, very powerful, high-
end scientiﬁc calculations.
Depending on your distribution, you should have a good graphical sys-
tem resources monitor so you can see where your system resources are being
used. The good old-fashioned top command is still a useful tool for viewing
active processes and how much system resources they are using. After start-
ing top, press 1 to see all the cores in a multicore CPU:

This shows that all is well. The summary at the top tells us many things:
One process is running, and the rest, all 231 of ’em, are sleeping. Three
CPU cores are chugging away.
All of these ﬁelds are explained in the nice man page, man top. Your ver-
sion of top may display different ﬁelds, but it is still the same top command.
The top section is the summary, and the bottom section is the task area.
CPU states (in the summary) are fun to examine in detail, but the main
ﬁelds to keep an eye on are the us, or user ﬁeld, which shows the load per
CPU, and the sy, or system ﬁeld, which shows the load from kernel pro-
cesses. If you are seeing sy values greater than 10 percent consistently, you
should track down the cause, because ordinarily it should be in the single
digits.
The Mem and Swap ﬁelds tell you whether your physical RAM is sufﬁcient.
As long as Swap usage is zero and your Mem is not maxed out, that is ideal for
audio processing, since RAM is many times faster than a swap ﬁle, which is
on your hard disk.
Down in the task area, you see information on every process on your
system. Again, don’t go crazy on the minute details, but look at the biggest
users at the top. This quickly reveals who the CPU and memory hogs are.
Web browsers can be awful hogs in this era of lardy, script- and Flash-heavy
websites, so shut ’em down. Audio processing chews up a lot of CPU cycles,
so that’s the main thing to keep an eye on. If you’re hitting greater than
75 percent consistently, think about upgrading your CPU. The Linux ker-
nel and most CPUs don’t mind working that hard, but at that level you’re
probably noticing slower performance.
You can tune your swap ﬁle size a bit for better performance. If you have
512MB of RAM or less, make your swap ﬁle size at least equal to your RAM
size. If you have 1GB of RAM or more, make your swap ﬁle no larger than
half your RAM. But don’t remove your swap ﬁle entirely—laptops need them
for suspend and hibernate, and if you ever use up all of your physical mem-
ory, that swap ﬁle might save your recording session.
If you are using a PCI sound card, check your motherboard manual to
ﬁnd a slot that does not use shared interrupts. PCI-Express sound cards are
great because PCI-E uses dedicated buses, rather than shared buses like the
old PCI 2.0 standard. There are not a lot of PCI-E sound cards yet; the RME
HDSPe MADI series, for one example, is ﬁrst-rate and works in Linux.
Don’t use networked ﬁle shares, except for storing backups of your au-
dio ﬁles, because they’re too slow.

Chapter 13

The Tangled History of Linux Audio
The original Linux audio subsystem was Sound Blaster 16, which “just hap-
pened” because SB16 sound cards had the best support and a nice API.
Those of us who are old enough to remember i386 PCs might also remem-
ber that competing brands used SB16 emulation because it was the path of
least resistance. This evolved into the Open Sound System (OSS), which is
portable across all Unix and Unix-type operating systems. It still exists and
is maintained, and it is often confused with the OSS-compatible module
in ALSA.
OSS fell out of favor as sound cards got cheaper and depended more on
software to handle mixing, instead of doing the mixing in hardware. And so
ESD (Gnome) and aRts (KDE) were born; these took care of mixing before
sending audio streams to OSS. However, this complicated matters because
Linux developers now had three different sound systems to deal with. The
Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) was then invented as a portability layer that
could use any audio backend, but it has some limitations that prevent it from
ascending the throne as the Great Linux Audio Uniter. Like everything else
in life, it hasn’t gone away but is still used in some applications. You proba-
bly have it on your own systems.
Then OSS went closed source, and users had to pay money for it. That
was the last straw for hardy Linux developers, who retaliated by inventing
ALSA. So, that is how ALSA became the standard Linux audio subsystem. A
good way to start a ﬂame war is to ignite an OSS versus ALSA debate—a lot
of folks still have strong passions on the subject.
OSS 4.x became Free software again when it was released under the GPL
for Linux in 2007, and now there are two versions: the GPL version and a
commercial version that includes some non-Free drivers. Some users claim
that their music sounds better with OSS and that it is simpler and better and
easier to use. I think a lot of that is wishful thinking, but if you like OSS, I
won’t think less of you.
I prefer plain old ALSA. It is the default in virtually all Linux systems,
and it works. As always with Linux, do your homework before you buy to
make sure you purchase well-supported hardware. The ALSA project has a
supported sound cards matrix at http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/
Matrix:Main.
ESD is the old Gnome and Enlightenment sound server, and it runs on
top of ALSA. It can manage multiple sound streams and networked play-
back. PulseAudio has replaced ESD in GNOME.
aRts also manages multiple streams and networked playback. Don’t use
aRts because it increases latency beyond acceptable levels and because it is
doomed—it has been unmaintained for some time now and is outdated.
Phonon replaces aRts in KDE4. Phonon is not a sound server or an API
but is intended to be a universal interface for all audio and video playback
servers and subsystems. Phonon doesn’t get in the way, so you can leave it
alone.
The future of desktop playback audio for Linux is cloudy. PulseAudio is
poised to become the standard sound manager for desktop Linux, but some
Configuring Linux for Best Audio Quality
289

say there are still some deeper problems to resolve that Pulse can’t ﬁx. So,
don’t be surprised by anything.
Sound Cards
Please visit Appendix A to learn about sound cards that are well supported
on Linux, from low-budget to high-end. Remember, it is very important to
shop carefully and purchase hardware that is well supported in Linux. There
is a lot of great quality audio hardware that works in Linux—life is too short
to waste on low-quality or poorly supported audio gear.

CONFIGURING WINDOWS FOR BEST
AUDIO QUALITY
Microsoft Windows users are in an interest-
ing position right now. Windows XP is still
the most popular Windows version, despite
being a Methuselah in computer years as it was
ﬁrst released in 2001. Microsoft has tried several times
to retire it, but it won’t go away. In July 2010, Micro-
soft announced an extension of support for XP SP3
through April 2014. XP will continue to be a downgrade option for Win-
dows 7 buyers for the length of Windows 7’s original equipment manufac-
turer (OEM) life span, which ends two years after the next Windows version
ships. So, XP is going to be with us for a long time yet.
There are compelling reasons to stick with XP on your audio production
computer. It is frugal of system requirements, needing less than 5GB for the
operating system and service packs, and it runs acceptably with a 1 GHz CPU
and 512MB RAM. Put it on a dual-core laptop with a gigabyte of RAM, and
you have a capable portable recording studio.
Windows Vista didn’t get much traction in the marketplace. At the
time this was written, audio hardware manufacturers were ﬁnally catching

up and releasing Vista drivers for their products. Audacity 1.3.x runs ﬁne on
Vista. But Vista is a system resources hog, eating up a good 12+GB of hard
drive space just for itself. Ofﬁcially, it needs a minimum of a 1 GHz CPU and
512GB RAM for Vista Home Basic or 1GB RAM for other editions, but if that
is all you have, it will feel like slogging through deep sand. It needs a 2 GHz
CPU and 2GB RAM just for basic chores such as email and web surﬁng. I
recommend a minimum 2 GHz dual-core CPU and 4GB RAM for running
Audacity on Vista.
Vista system requirements also apply to Windows 7. It’s not very differ-
ent from Vista; it’s more polished, memory management is a little better,
User Account Control is less annoying, and it boots up a little faster. The
Sound control panel has a nice extra feature, a Communications tab with
simple auto-duck settings for your playback device. You can conﬁgure it
for tasks such as automatically muting all other sounds when you receive a
Skype call.
Enabling MP3 Support
Because of patent encumbrances on the MP3 audio format (or more pre-
cisely, MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3), an MP3 encoder is not included with Au-
dacity. However, you can easily get the LAME MP3 encoder, which is a high-
quality, cross-platform free software MP3 encoder and decoder. One way
to get it is to follow the instructions on the Audacity download page. An-
other way is from inside Audacity, by exporting a ﬁle as MP3. If LAME is not
present on your system, you’ll see a dialog like the one in Figure 14-1.
Click the Download button to go directly to the LAME download page.
You can download either a zipped archive or an uncompressed archive. The
installer is a standard Windows .exe ﬁle; just download it, double-click the
downloaded ﬁle, and go through the installation steps. It will put LAME into
\Program Files\Lame For Audacity. You can verify that it installed successfully
by looking at the Edit > Preferences > Libraries dialog. Click MP3 Library:
Locate, and it will display the full ﬁle path (Figure 14-2).
Figure 14-1: To install LAME from
inside Audacity, click the Down-
load button in the MP3 Export
dialog.
Figure 14-2: After you in-
stall LAME, the Libraries
dialog shows the full ﬁle
path.

Chapter 14

Enabling WMA, M4A/M4P Support
Audacity offers native support for open, unencumbered audio codecs
and formats such as WAV, AIFF, Ogg Theora, and FLAC. But just like with
MP3s, Audacity cannot ship with support for closed, proprietary, or patent-
encumbered formats such as Windows Media Audio (WMA), M4A (lossy,
compressed format), or M4P (M4A with DRM added). M4A and M4P are
the default formats for Apple’s iTunes store. They use the Advanced Audio
Coding (AAC) codecs. No licenses or payments are required to distribute
recordings in any form that use AAC, but anyone who makes an AAC en-
coder is required to purchase a patent license. Open source encoders get
around this by releasing source code rather than a ready-to-use binary ap-
plication and by hosting their download servers in friendly countries. Many
countries do not enforce U.S. software patent laws, or even recognize the va-
lidity of software patents, and expressly allow reverse-engineering. So when
it comes to ﬁguring all this out, the Magic 8 Ball has the deﬁnitive answer:
“Reply hazy, try again.”
The short story is you can add support for a large number of nonfree
and encumbered audio (and video) ﬁle formats by installing FFmpeg. Au-
dacity has FFmpeg support built in, and you install it the same way as LAME.
Just like LAME, it will be placed into \Program Files\FFmpeg for Audacity.
Both LAME and FFmpeg can be installed, and their locations on your
system can be veriﬁed from Edit > Preferences > Libraries (Figure 14-3).
Figure 14-3: FFmpeg and LAME can also be in-
stalled from Edit > Preferences > Libraries.
Low-Latency Recording and Audio Driver Fun
Making recordings on computers means you have to care about drivers.
A lot.
The standard Windows Multi-Media Extensions (MME) sound system
supports two-channel 16-bit 44.1Hz recording. This is an old system that has
been around since Windows 3.1. Then Microsoft developed the Windows
Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality
293

Driver Model Kernel Streaming (WDM/KS) and Enhanced Windows Driver
Model (EWDM) drivers for Windows 2000 and newer. Audacity supports
all of these. For recording more than two channels simultaneously, you
want sound cards with full EWDM support. Most audio devices claim WDM
support, but that doesn’t always mean EWDM or WDM/KS, so they may
not support recording from more than two inputs at the same time.
The Audio Streaming Input/Output (ASIO) driver is a high-quality, low-
latency audio interface for Windows. Unfortunately, Audacity cannot ship
with support for it because it is a closed, proprietary driver. So, you have
two options: Stick with devices that support EWDM or WDM/KS, or com-
pile Audacity with ASIO support yourself. To do this, you need the ASIO
software developer’s kit (SDK) from Steinberg, the company that owns the
ASIO driver, and the latest Audacity source code from its CVS repository on
SourceForge. You’ll also need Microsoft Visual C++ 8, which is part of Visual
Studio, to compile Audacity on Windows.
You’ll have to register for a developer account on Steinberg.net before
you can download the ASIO SDK. This is free and easy. Follow the instruc-
tions on the Audacity download page to get the latest Audacity source code.
Then ﬁnd the win\compile.txt ﬁle in the Audacity source tree, because it gives
detailed instructions for building Audacity with ASIO support.
NOTE
There are some licensing issues you must be aware of. You can build your own copies of
Audacity with ASIO support for personal use only: You cannot distribute them. This
would violate both Audacity’s license (the GPL) and Steinberg’s license for ASIO. The
Audacity maintainers encourage users to email Steinberg and politely request that it
open source the ASIO driver.
The cheap and easy way is to ask a friend who already has Microsoft’s
Visual Studio to help you. It may sound like a lot of trouble to compile Au-
dacity to include ASIO support, but for someone who already knows their
way around Visual Studio, it’s pretty simple. Do you need ASIO support
in Audacity? No, if you shop carefully, you can ﬁnd recording interfaces
with good-quality EWDM or WDM/KS drivers. Just having an ASIO driver
doesn’t guarantee that a device will perform well, because there are bad
ASIO drivers. There are also bad EWDM and WDM/KS drivers, so do your
homework before purchasing anything.
If you can ﬁnd a way to enable ASIO support in Audacity, you’ll have
a lot more hardware and conﬁguration options. A lot of higher-end sound
cards support multiple drivers, including ASIO and the WDM family, so you
can try different ones to see which ones perform the best.
Tuning Windows for Best Performance
Good audio recording requires a clean, well-performing computer that is
not bogged down with unnecessary applications and services. Poor Windows
is famous for getting loaded down with useless cruft, so we’re going to review
how to give it a good housecleaning.
294
Chapter 14

A common cause of slow performance is video controllers that use
shared system memory. These suck up both CPU cycles and RAM. If you
have one of these, it will be worth the money to get a discrete graphics con-
troller; the difference in performance will be large and noticeable, because
the processing load will be handled by the video card. If you have cheapo
shared-memory video, you should be able to upgrade, whether it’s on a lap-
top or desktop PC. Your laptop will have very speciﬁc requirements, which
you should be able to ﬁnd out from your manual or the manufacturer’s web-
site. A desktop PC should offer more ﬂexibility.
You have to match your video card to your motherboard, because there
are several different types of PCI slots for desktop PC video cards: PCI, AGP,
and PCI-e. You have to match both the slot and the correct voltage. Also
make sure there is enough room for your new video card, because some
of them are monsters with giant cooling fans. These giant beasts are for
gamers, not audio production rigs. Cheap and small will work ﬁne. You
may need to go into your system BIOS to disable onboard video, if you are
already using that. If all of this sounds like a foreign language to you, you
might look for a knowledgeable friend to assist or even pay a professional.
Always have the latest Windows updates installed, especially service packs.
Make sure you have the latest drivers for your audio devices. Run Defrag and
Disk Cleanup periodically.
Turn off everything that is not essential for recording: other applica-
tions, screensaver, antimalware, system maintenance applications, ﬁrewall,
web browser, email, “entertainment” crapware, adware, fancy special effects—
everything. Virus checkers and Windows ﬁrewalls are notorious system re-
source hogs, but disabling them obviously leaves your system unprotected
so you’ll want to disconnect from any networks. Don’t forget to turn off wi-ﬁ
and Bluetooth. Some laptops have nice physical switches to turn these off;
otherwise, go into the Network Connections control panel to disable them.
If you need to stay connected, you’re stuck with keeping your protections
turned on.
Figure 14-4: Raising Audacity’s priority in the
Task Manager
Raise Audacity’s priority
in the Task Manager. To bring
up the Task Manager, press
CTRL-ALT-DELETE. Press this
combination only once, or Win-
dows will reboot. Go to the Pro-
cesses tab in the Task Manager
and right-click the entry for Au-
dacity (Figure 14-4). The de-
fault priority is normal, and you
should be able to raise it to High
without making other processes
unhappy. Raising it to Realtime
seems like the obvious choice,
but it makes my system unstable.
You may have better results.
Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality

You can safely disable a number of Windows services that consume
memory and CPU cycles with little beneﬁt to you, and some are even secu-
rity risks. Third-party software vendors love to choke Windows with all kinds
of junk. You can look at the Processes tab in the Task Manager to see what
is using up the most CPU and memory, and then a quick web search should
tell what the service is for and whether it’s something you need to keep or
can evict. We’ll look at some common offenders in detail in the next two
sections.
Tuning Windows XP
Figure 14-5: Fine-tuning Windows XP by turning
off unnecessary and dangerous services
First we’ll start with some easy
stuff: In Windows XP, right-click
My Computer and select Prop-
erties. Click the Advanced tab,
and then click the Performance
Settings button (Figure 14-5).
On the Visual Effects tab, select
“Adjust for best performance.”
This turns off the basic Windows
XP eye candy.
While you’re still in Perfor-
mance Options, go to the Ad-
vanced tab. By default the Win-
dows paging ﬁle is dynamic and
changes its size according to de-
mand. Change it to a ﬁxed size
in the Virtual memory menu;
this gives you a little faster per-
formance. If you have 512MB
RAM or less, set your swap ﬁle
size to 1.5 times your RAM. For
1GB to 4GB, make it half your RAM. For more than 4GB, try a minimal size
like 512MB. You want Audacity using your nice fast RAM, not slow paging
ﬁles.
NOTE
The paging ﬁle is virtual memory. If Windows runs out of RAM, it uses the paging
ﬁle that is on your hard drive. Reading and writing to a hard drive are many times
slower than using RAM, so it is always better to have more RAM than to have a bigger
paging ﬁle.
Now leave Performance Options and go to the System Restore tab. I
recommend disabling System Restore by checking the “Turn Off System Re-
store on all drives” checkbox, though if you want to leave it on, that’s okay.
In my experience, it takes up disk space and slows down your system a little
bit without being all that useful, because it seems that failures and problems
are faithfully preserved in System Restore. Your best protection, as always, is
keeping regular data backups on external media.
296
Chapter 14

Next, go to the Automatic Updates tab and turn them off. This means
you have to remember to run updates manually—don’t forget! You don’t
want the updater to kick in during a recording or editing session because it
will bog down your system, pop up messages at you, and then nag you about
restarting.
On the Remote tab, disable “Allow Remote Assistance invitations to be
sent from this computer” and “Allow users to connect remotely to this com-
puter.” Hello, big fat security holes anyone? And they use some system re-
sources. You can always turn them on when you know you need them; the
rest of the time they should be disabled.
We’re ﬁnished with System Properties and ready to move on. Now you
want to look at any services that are set to start at boot and set the ones that
don’t need to be running all the time to Manual or Disabled. Do this in
the Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services dialog. A lot of third-
party software lards down your system with all kinds of unnecessary baggage.
One example is the USB Audio interfaces software CD that came with my
M-Audio MobilePre. Windows XP already has a perfectly good USB audio
interface built in, so you don’t need to install anything extra—the MobilePre
works just ﬁne without the extra guff, which is a driver installer and a rudi-
mentary volume control panel. There’s nothing to get excited about, and
there’s nothing particularly useful. A lot of USB audio devices do this, so try
them ﬁrst without installing anything extra.
Here is a short checklist of services that should be disabled because they
are unnecessary or security risks, or both. It’s not necessary to track down
and nuke every last not-absolutely-essential service, though you’re welcome
to do so. TweakHound (http://www.tweakhound.com/) is a thorough and re-
liable guide to Windows system tuning, including both good tweaks and
bad tweaks. It is also helpful to do web searches on speciﬁc services. Don’t
change anything without knowing what it does; you don’t want to nuke es-
sential Windows services. When you change a running service to Manual or
Disable, you will also have to stop it. Double-click the service to open a con-
ﬁguration dialog.
These are some of the more common offenders:
Alerter
Sends administrative alerts. This is useless and should be
disabled by default in Service Packs 2 and 3.
ClipBook
Another winner in the “Who the heck thought this was a
good idea” category—ClipBook shares the contents of your clipboard
with remote users. It should be disabled by default in XP Service Packs 2
and 3.
Network DDE, Network DDE DSDM
This manages Dynamic Data
Exchange (DDE) network shares, which are nasty things like ClipBook.
It should be disabled by default in XP Service Packs 2 and 3.
Routing and Remote Access
Turn your computer into a router and
share an Internet connection. No, not while you’re recording and edit-
ing. It should be disabled by default in Service Packs 2 and 3.
Configuring Windows for Best Audio Quality

Error Reporting Service
Phones home to Microsoft reporting gosh-
knows-what information. Disable it.
Indexing Service
Although building a database of ﬁles on your sys-
tem for faster searches sounds good in theory, the indexer is a major
hog, and I guarantee it will run exactly when you don’t want it to. I’ve
tried searches both with and without the indexer service, and I don’t see
much difference either way. Disable it.
Messenger
Related to the Alerter service and a famous security hole.
Always disable it.
Infrared Monitor
Does anyone use infrared devices? If you have an
infrared wireless keyboard or mouse or any other device that connects
via infrared, leave this on. Otherwise, disable it.
Smart Card
Is anyone using any kind of smart cards for Windows PCs?
I’ll eat my hat if they are. Turn this off.
Telnet
Why is this even still hanging around? Telnet is completely
insecure—you never ever want to enable telnet access to your PC, except
under completely safe and controlled conditions when you know you re-
ally, really want to and you can be counted on to turn it off when you’re
ﬁnished. Disable it.
Themes
“Provides user experience theme management.” Whatever.
This sucks up as much as 15MB of RAM. Disable it.
Terminal services
This allows remote desktop sharing and administra-
tion. Disable it, and then turn it on only when you want to use it.
WebClient
“The Web Client service allows . . . standard Win32 appli-
cations to create, read, and write ﬁles on Internet ﬁle servers by using
the WebDAV protocol.” Disable it; it’s a notorious security hole that does
nothing useful.
Figure 14-6 shows what the Services control panel looks like.
You may have FTP and World Wide Web Publisher services installed and
enabled; disable them during recording and editing sessions. If you’re not
using your system as an FTP or web server, disable them permanently.
Depending on what’s installed on your system, you’ll ﬁnd all kinds of
third-party services running and bogging down your Windows PC: Norton,
McAfee, TrendMicro, QuickTime, Adobe, Java, Macromedia, weird little
screensaver things, newsfeeds, daily cute puppy pics, bogus system tune-up
and registry cleaners, and so on; it’s quite amazing what goes on behind
your back. Ideally your computer will be a lean, mean, dedicated audio
production machine with as little fat as possible.

Audacity using your nice fast RAM, not slow paging ﬁles.
Close Performance Options and go to the System Protection tab. I rec-
ommend turning off System Restore here, though I won’t complain if you
want to leave it on. To disable it, uncheck all the boxes in the Automatic Re-

viding much beneﬁt. I prefer to rely on good regular data backups, rather
than hoping Windows can cure itself when there are problems.
Now go to the Remote tab and uncheck “Allow Remote Assistance con-
nections to this computer.” This is a potential security hole, and you should
turn it on only when you know you’re going to use it. You’re done here now,
so click OK to close System Properties.
Windows Update, Windows Firewall, and Windows Defender are all con-
ﬁgured in Control Panel > Security Center. To squeeze maximum perfor-
mance out of Windows Vista/7, turn off everything. Of course, when you
do this, your system is vulnerable, so don’t connect to any networks while
you are doing audio work. Automatic Updating is especially troublesome be-
cause it will interrupt whatever you are doing whenever it runs, bother you
with nag messages, and then in most cases want to reboot. Then the restart
can take a long time as it applies and conﬁgures the updates. You can run
the updater manually when it’s convenient for you.
Vista and 7 are better than previous Windows versions at not running
bales of useless and dangerous services. But you should still go through and
do a bit of weeding. Don’t change anything without knowing what it does;
you don’t want to nuke essential Windows services. A quick web search on
speciﬁc services should tell you what you need to know about them, espe-
cially if they are Windows services. TweakHound (http://www.tweakhound
.com/) is a thorough and reliable guide to Windows systems tuning.
Services are controlled in the Control Panel > Programs and Features >

the following services, depending on which ﬂavor of Windows you are run-
ning and what extras are installed.
Indexing Service
Indexes your ﬁles for supposedly faster searches.
It will run when you don’t want it to and gum up a great recording ses-
sion. Turn it off. You won’t see it on Windows 7, which replaces it with
Windows Search. These should be off by default.
Internet Information Services
Are you running an SMTP or FTP
server? No? Then turn this off. It should be off by default.
Microsoft.NET Framework
Microsoft keeps stufﬁng .NET compo-
nents into every available Windows computer, whether it makes sense
to or not. You may have some applications that depend on it, so leave it
alone.

Are you using a tablet PC? No? Then

Always turn these off, except when you

This is touted as a collaboration tool, an up-

Conﬁguring Windows Audio Devices
Figure 14-8: Recording device
picker on Windows XP—don’t
choose Microsoft Sound Mapper
The ancestral Windows MME sound system,
which as we already discussed is old, slow,
and limited, appears in Audacity as MME: Mi-
crosoft Sound Mapper (see Figure 14-8). If
you select this as your recording device, you’ll
get whatever is set as the default recording de-
vice in the Sound control panel. Don’t choose
this for your recording device—select the ex-
act driver for your device. The correct choices
for my system are the MobilePre and the onboard SoundMAX audio chipset.
The Control Panel > Sound control panel includes mixer panels for
adjusting both recording and playback volume. You can use this to adjust
recording levels while recording or playing back in Audacity. On the Play-
back tab, select your playback device and click Conﬁgure to get a simple
speaker tester. This is a fast and easy way to verify that your speakers are
connected correctly and working (Figure 14-9).
Note the simple little VU meter on the Recording tab, showing the record-
ing level (Figure 14-10).
Figure 14-9: Test your speakers in the Play-
back > Conﬁgure dialog. If this were a sleek
5.1 surround system, you would be able to test
that each channel was routed to the correct
speaker and that all speakers were working.

Figure 14-11 shows the Properties dialog for my M-Audio MobilePre in
Vista. Vista calls it “Analog Connector”; fortunately, this can be changed if
you want to give it a more informative name. Use this to enable a sound de-
vice, control the recording levels and balance, and set the recording quality
level. Make sure the quality level in Windows agrees with your Audacity set-
tings. I’m puzzled as to why the Balance setting requires an extra click and
needs its own special dialog when the Levels tab has acres of empty space.
But what do I know; I am not an elite software designer engineer.

CUSTOMIZING AUDACITY
Audacity has a number of conﬁgurable
options in the Edit > Preferences dialog.
You can improve your efﬁciency by setting
Audacity’s default options to suit your own work-
ﬂow, so in this chapter we’re going to learn all about
them.
Audacity underwent major changes in the 1.3 series, which is the beta
for the ﬁnal 2.x release. The Audacity developers are on ﬁre and making a
large number of excellent improvements and additions. What you see in this
chapter should be very close to what the ﬁnal release looks like, but don’t be
surprised if there are some differences.
Customizing Audacity’s Default Options
Audacity’s default options are set in Edit > Preferences, which you can also
open by pressing CTRL-P. Many of these settings can be overridden in the
menus and toolbars, which is faster than opening the Preferences dialog
every time you want to temporarily change a setting. Figure 15-1 shows what
the main Preferences menu looks like in Windows.
Remember to have any USB or FireWire devices plugged in and switched
on before starting Audacity, or Audacity will not detect them.

Let’s start from the top and work our way down.
Devices
In the Devices dialog, the Host is the base sound system of your operating
system. For Windows this should not be MME but Windows DirectSound.
The Playback and Recording devices should be your speciﬁc devices. In Fig-
ure 15-1, I have selected the SoundMAX onboard chipset on my ThinkPad.
Your sound card will probably be something else. You could also select Pri-
mary Sound Driver, which means the default recording and playback devices
are selected in the Sound module in the Windows Control Panel.
Figure 15-1: Selecting the default recording and playback
devices in Windows
For Linux users, the host will be ALSA, the JACK Audio Connection
Kit, or the Open Sound System (OSS). The Playback and Recording device
choosers can use the ALSA defaults or select speciﬁc devices (Figure 15-2).
I think it’s better to always choose the speciﬁc audio interfaces you want Au-
dacity to use, rather than messing around with your system defaults.
Figure 15-2: This is how it looks for Linux users: On my sys-
tem, the default recording device chooser shows an onboard
ATI chipset, the MobilePre USB, and the ALSA default.
304
Chapter 15

The number of recording channels depends on what your recording in-
terface supports. If you have a multichannel interface with 10 channels, for
example, you could select 10 even if you weren’t using that many. Audacity
will then open 10 tracks, so if you record on 6 of them, you will have 4 empty
tracks.
Playback
The Playback dialog (Figure 15-3) controls some special playback features
that are helpful when you’re editing your tracks.
Figure 15-3: The Playback dialog
Many of Audacity’s special effects (in the Generate and Effect menus)
have Preview buttons so you can hear your changes before actually applying
them to your tracks. Length of preview controls the duration of that preview.
Cut Preview is a slick tool for previewing what your track will sound like
when you cut out a section of the track. The default is one second, but you
can set it to whatever you like. Select a portion of a track that you think you
want to cut, but don’t cut it; just select it. Then press the C key on the key-
board, and you’ll hear a preview of the audio before and after your selec-
tion, just as though you had already made the cut. To play the selection,
press the spacebar.
Remember how to change the size of a selected area? Make sure you
have the Selection tool active. Position the cursor near the edge of your se-
lection; it should change to a little I-beam. Hold down the SHIFT key, and
then click and drag. SHIFT-right arrow or SHIFT-left arrow expands the selec-
tion, and SHIFT-CTRL-right arrow or SHIFT-CTRL-left arrow shrinks it.
Seek Time when playing controls the length of Audacity’s jump ahead
feature. When you’re playing a track, press the left- or right-arrow key to
jump backward or forward by the number of seconds in the Short period set-
ting. Press the SHIFT key plus the left- or right-arrow key to jump the length
of the Long period setting.
Customizing Audacity
305

Recording
The Recording dialog (Figure 15-4) controls some key recording features.
Figure 15-4: The Recording window
Check “Overdub: Play other tracks while recording new one” to record
a new track while listening to an existing track or tracks. For example, you
could ﬁrst record a nice ﬁddle track. Then with overdubbing enabled, the
ﬁddle track will play while you record a vocal track, a second ﬁddle, or what-
ever you want.
“Software Playthrough: Listen while recording or monitoring new track”
enables monitoring of your recording session through your playback de-
vice. Software Playthrough works only when the recording input and play-
back are on the same sound card. (Linux users: If they are separate devices,
you can create a connection with JACK.) This isn’t the best way to moni-
tor a recording session, because there will likely be noticeable lag and it
may add enough CPU load to cause skips. A dedicated monitoring port
on your recording interface is better. If you don’t have one, give Software
Playthrough a try. (Note that it says to “uncheck when recording stereo
mix.” In other words, it works only with mono tracks.) You can also enable
and disable Overdub and Software Playthrough from the Transport menu.
You may ﬁnd yourself spending some time in the Latency section, trying
to ﬁnd the best balance between performance and reducing latency. Au-
dio to buffer controls how much audio is buffered in memory. When this
buffer is larger, performance is smoother, but latency increases. When it
is smaller, latency decreases, but if the audio buffer is too small, your CPU
won’t be able to keep up and there will be skips and stutters. Higher latency
is noticeable when you are overdubbing or using Software Playthrough.
Latency correction compensates for the inevitable latency present in
overdubbing. There is always some latency present in playback, so when you
overdub, the new track always lags behind the playback track. (See “Over-
dubbing” on page 182 to learn more.)
Sound Activated Recording can be enabled here, and you can set the
decibel level for triggering recording. You can also do this from the Trans-
port menu.

Chapter 15

Quality
The Quality dialog (Figure 15-5) sets the default audio quality values for
both playback and recording.
Figure 15-5: The Quality dialog
The Sampling section sets the default sampling rate and bit depth, which
in this menu are called Sample Rate and Sample Format, respectively. These
settings can be overridden on the individual Track menus and with the Se-
lection toolbar. Mind the terminology confusion here—sample format and bit
depth are the same thing, but bit depth is the correct term. Only in Audacity
is bit depth called sample format.
The Real-time Conversion settings choose the types of sampling rate
and bit depth conversions that are applied to audio ﬁles for playback in
Audacity. Resampling happens when your audio ﬁles have a different sam-
pling rate than your project rate. If the bit depth of an audio ﬁle is differ-
ent from the project bit depth, it will be converted to the project value. This
doesn’t change the ﬁles because the conversion is done on the ﬂy for play-
back only. Best Sinc Interpolater performs the highest-quality conversion.
But it is CPU-intensive, so if playback bogs down, try Medium Sinc Interpo-
later. Fast Interpolator, Zero order hold (ZOH) interpolator, and Linear
interpolation are very fast but not very good, and they introduce audible
distortion.
Dither is deliberately adding a bit of noise to smooth out the waveform
when a 32- or 24-bit audio ﬁle is converted to 16 bits. Shaped dither is sup-
posed to give the best results, and it is the most CPU-intensive. Triangular is
a compromise between quality and CPU cycles, and rectangular is lightweight
and makes the smallest alterations. You don’t have to apply dithering; your
own ears will tell you if it makes any improvements or not.
The High-quality Conversion settings are just like the Real-time Conver-
sion settings, except they are applied to tracks during mixing and export, so
unlike the Real-time Conversion settings, your project ﬁles are changed.

Interface
The Interface dialog (Figure 15-6) controls some of the elements of the Au-
dacity interface:
Figure 15-6: The Interface dialog
Ergonomic order of audio I/O buttons
Check this to put the buttons
in the Control toolbar in this order: Pause, Play, Stop, Skip to Start, Skip

Pause, Stop, and Skip to End.
Show ‘How to get Help’ message at program start up
Check this to
see a message box full of links to Audacity help resources, such as the
manual and wiki. You may need to install the Audacity manual separately
if you want a local copy. The most current version will be online.
Meter/Waveform dB range
This is where you adjust the display
scale in the Meter toolbar and Waveform dB view (Track menu), from
−36 dB to −145 dB.
Language
This is a nice convenience if you want your Audacity session
to be in a different language than your operating system default. You
also need the language fonts installed on your system.
Location of Manual
Use this to program Help > Manual to either
look for a local copy of the Audacity manual, or to go directly to the
online version.
Closing last window quits Audacity
If you uncheck this box, clos-
ing the last open project will leave Audacity open, and you’ll have to
select File > Exit (or press CTRL-Q) to close completely. This is useful
when you’re doing a lot of projects, such as transferring a batch of vinyl
records to CD, because you can close each project as you ﬁnish without
closing Audacity.

Beep on completion of longer activities
Check this to make Audacity
beep when tasks that take longer than a minute are ﬁnished.
CleanSpeech Mode
CleanSpeech Mode creates a customized, sim-
pliﬁed Audacity interface for quick cleanups and quick MP3 exports.
One extra button is added to the Control toolbar, and the menus are
simpliﬁed (Figure 15-7). The Generate and Analyze menus are removed,
and some of the remaining menus have simpliﬁed sets of commands
and options. When you click the pretty orange CleanSpeech button, you
see something like Figure 15-8. There are two prefab batches, or chain
operations as they are called in Audacity: a fast MP3 converter and the
CleanSpeech batch job for cleaning up plain-speech recordings such as
podcasts.
Figure 15-7: CleanSpeech Mode
button
Figure 15-8: CleanSpeech Mode
has two prefab operations: Clean-
Speech and MP3 Conversion.
The MP3 conversion contains only two operations: normalization
and export to 128Kbps MP3. If you apply CleanSpeech or MP3 conver-
sion to an open project by clicking the Apply to Current Project button,
the exported ﬁles go into a directory named cleaned in the project di-
rectory. You may also start with an empty project, click Apply to Files,
and select ﬁles to convert from a ﬁle picker. The converted ﬁles will be
exported into the same directories as the source audio ﬁles. With the
second method, no new Audacity project is created.
The default CleanSpeech settings are rather harsh because they
apply Noise Removal and the Leveller Effect. Noise Removal needs a cus-
tom noise proﬁle to be effective, and there is no way to build a custom
proﬁle here. The Leveller Effect introduces a signiﬁcant amount of dis-
tortion. It applies the Normalize effect twice, which can increase noise.
You can modify either of these two chains or create new ones, though
at the time this was written, the Audacity chains feature was still rather
immature and not very well documented.
Select File > Edit Chains to see exactly what the prefab CleanSpeech
and MP3 conversions do (Figure 15-9).
Customizing Audacity
309

Figure 15-9: MP3 conversion and CleanSpeech options
But even in its current unﬁnished state, the Audacity developers
have the right idea by making these custom batch jobs customizable
through a graphical interface. To create a new chain, open the File >
Edit Chains dialog (Figure 15-10) and click the Add button in the left
pane. A little message window pops up and asks you to name your new
chain. In this example, I created the new “test” chain.
Figure 15-10: Creating a new custom chain
Now I can add a command to the test chain by clicking the Insert
button (Figure 15-11). This opens the Select Command dialog. This
has more commands in normal mode than in CleanSpeech mode.
To ﬁnd out whether you can customize command parameters, ﬁrst
select a command, and then click the Edit Parameters button. In Fig-
ure 15-12, we do this with the Amplify effect. This opens its normal
dialog, so we can set the Amplify parameters in the usual way.
This doesn’t work for all the commands, but you may ﬁnd you can
create some useful chains to automate routine tasks.

Tracks
The Track dialog (Figure 15-13) controls how your Audacity tracks behave
during recording, editing, and playback:

Update display while playing
This autoscrolls during playback. If it
bogs down your computer too much, you can disable it. Though if it
does, you really need to think about upgrading your computer.
Automatically ﬁt tracks vertically zoomed
This could be a convenient
option: Your tracks are resized vertically to ﬁt the screen. But if your
project has too many tracks, they will get squished very small. Too few
tracks and they will be expanded very large to ﬁll the screen.
Default View Mode
Choose your default waveform display, which has
the same selections as in the Track menu: Waveform, which is Audacity’s
default; Waveform dB; Spectrum; Spectrum log(f); or Pitch EAC. (See
“Track Panel” on page 19 to learn more about these.)

something. When it is checked, all of your tracks are selected by default
when you make no selection.
Enable cut lines
This is a nice little feature that helps you keep track
of recent cuts. When you make a cut, a light blue line marks the loca-
tion. When you move the cursor elsewhere, the blue line turns red.
Enable dragging of left and right selection edges
This allows you to
expand or reduce selections using the mouse. When this is not checked,
you must use the keyboard or the selection bar.
“Move track focus” cycles repeatedly through tracks
When you have
multiple tracks, you can change focus with the up- and down-arrow keys,
and when the cursor comes to the top or bottom track, it automatically
continues to cycle through the tracks as long as you hold the key down.
Editing a clip can move other clips
When this is checked, you can
paste between clips, and Audacity will automatically create space for the
new paste. When it is not checked, if there is not enough room, you will
not be able to paste there.
Solo Button
This has a drop-down menu with three options that con-
trols the behavior of the Solo buttons on the Track panels and Mixer
Board: Standard, Simple, None. In Standard mode, clicking the Solo
button on multiple tracks is equivalent to selecting them, and you can
select multiple tracks this way. In Simple mode, clicking the Solo button
on one track mutes all the others. None removes all the Solo buttons,
leaving only Mute buttons.
Import/Export
Here you can set some useful defaults for importing and exporting audio
ﬁles (Figure 15-14):
Figure 15-14: Setting default importing and exporting
behaviors: Import/Export
When importing audio ﬁles
You must choose one of the ﬁrst two op-
tions: “Make a copy of uncompressed audio ﬁles before editing (safer)”
or “Read uncompressed audio ﬁles directly from the original (faster).”
312
Chapter 15

The ﬁrst option adds redundancy, and it allows you to manipu-
late or delete your source audio ﬁles without damaging your Audacity
project. The second is faster and more frugal of disk space. If you aren’t
going to change the source ﬁles, then use this option. For example, sup-
pose you have a long live recording of your band, and you’re going to
edit it and make some CDs and downloads from it. If you’re like me, you
preserve your originals intact, warts and all, and make backup copies, so
you don’t need Audacity to make additional copies of the originals.
Normalize all tracks in a project
This setting will normalize all
audio ﬁles on import into your project according to the current settings
of Effect > Normalize. I prefer to apply normalization as one of the ﬁnal
steps on most projects, especially when I’m mixing multiple tracks down
to stereo, because mixing tracks together makes them louder. But this
could be a useful option when you are doing a project that doesn’t re-
quire a lot of editing, such as assembling a compilation from audio ﬁles
that are already edited and mixed.
When exporting tracks to an audio ﬁle
“Always mix all tracks
down to Stereo or Mono channel(s)” is the logical choice when you
mainly create stereo or mono mixes. “Use custom mix” opens a channel
mapper at export (Audacity calls it a mixer), which you need for multi-
channel surround exports and when you want a little more control of
stereo exports.
Show Metadata Editor prior to export step
Checking this means
the metadata editor will open for every individual song track or ﬁle at
export so you can verify or edit the metadata for each one individually.
This can be a big job if you are exporting a lot of individual songs or
tracks. You should ﬁrst enter information common to all tracks in File >
Open Metadata Editor, and then Audacity will automatically enter this
for every song and automatically enter each track number.
Projects
The Projects dialog controls autosave intervals and how to manage projects
that are spun off from other projects (Figure 15-15):
When saving a project that depends on other audio ﬁles
I don’t be-
lieve it is a good idea for Audacity projects to depend on other Audacity
projects. They should be self-contained. If you need to be frugal of disk
space, then you might want your Audacity projects to share dependen-
cies, but I think this is asking for trouble, because if anything changes,
it will affect multiple projects. The safe choice is “Always copy all audio
into project (safest).” “Ask user” is all right if you want to decide for each
project individually. You can check whether any project has dependen-
cies by clicking File > Check Dependencies.
Auto save
Click this if you want Audacity to automatically save a
copy of your project at whatever interval you select. The copy goes into
Customizing Audacity

Figure 15-15: Setting default importing and exporting
behaviors: Projects
a separate directory, which Audacity uses for autorecovery of damaged
projects. It doesn’t save the data ﬁles, which are the ones with the .au
extension, but rather the project metadata, which is kept in an XML ﬁle.
Linux users can see these autosave ﬁles in /.audacity-data/AutoSave/;
they’re just like the project .aup ﬁles. On Windows XP and Vista, look
in Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Audacity, and on
Windows 7, refer to Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Audacity.
You can’t save your project while Audacity is running, so it is a good
idea to take advantage of every opportunity to stop recording and save
your project by pressing CTRL-C or clicking File > Save Project as often
as you can.
Libraries
The Libraries dialog conﬁrms if you have LAME and FFMpeg installed, gives
their locations, and gives their versions (Figure 15-16).
Figure 15-16: The Libraries dialog shows the version
number, 3.98.2, and the full ﬁle path. If LAME were not
installed, it would not show these.
If any of these is missing, just click the Download button to ﬁnd and in-
stall them.

Chapter 15

Spectrograms
This dialog controls the level of detail in the track display when you select
the Spectrum or Pitch EAC views of your tracks. These are useful for in-
depth frequency analysis. (Chapter 11 has a nice introduction to frequency
analysis.) There is whole lot of math going on here that I do not under-
stand, but I am grateful to the brainiacs who do understand the math and
reﬁne the algorithms that make digital audio engineering possible. The
ﬁrst setting, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Window, controls how much fre-
quency detail is shown. Larger FFT sizes show more bass frequencies and
less detailed time resolution.
Window type lists things like Rectangular, Hanning, Bartlett, Hamming,
Welch, and Gaussian. In the plainest terms I can think of, without digging
into the math, these are graphical views of digital signals intended to aid
detailed analysis. According to the Wikipedia article “Window Function”
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function/), Blackman-Harris is a lower-
resolution, high-dynamic range window, while all the others are high- and
moderate-resolution windows.
The Minimum/Maximum Frequency settings are useful for trimming
the display when you’re working in limited frequency range, such as with a
voice or a single instrument.
Directories
Tell Audacity what temporary directory you want it to use in the Directories
dialog (Figure 15-17). The normal operating system temp ﬁle is best and
should be already selected by Audacity.
Figure 15-17: Temporary ﬁle location
The Audio Cache setting is a rather desperate option if you are stuck
with a very slow computer. Checking this option keeps all recording in mem-
ory until you stop recording, and then it is written to disk. It will certainly
speed up performance on a computer with a very slow hard drive. But one
little power blip or running out of RAM means your recording session is lost.
There isn’t as much risk on a laptop since it has a battery, and you can set a
minimum memory threshold to trigger writing to disk. Audacity has a hard-
coded minimum of 16MB RAM, so you can’t use a lower setting than that.

Warnings
This one is so easy you can do it in your sleep—decide which warnings you
want Audacity to display for different operations (Figure 15-18).

Effects
This dialog gives you the option to enable or disable Nyquist, VAMP,
LADSPA, or VST effects. (Linux users will not see VST effects because
they do not work on Linux.) I don’t know why you would want to disable
any of these, but you can if you want.
Keyboard and Mouse
In these two dialogs, you can set custom key bindings and see what the
mouse shortcuts are. You can’t change the mouse shortcuts, but you can
customize keyboard shortcuts all you want. Click the function you want to
create a keyboard shortcut for; let’s say it’s Open Metadata Editor. Click the
box next to the Set button and press the keys you want for your shortcut. In
Figure 15-19, I entered CTRL-S and clicked the Set button. Then Audacity
kindly informed me that CTRL-S was already in use. Because Audacity ﬁnds
any conﬂicts for you, it goes fast.

A
AUDIO HARDWARE
The world of audio recording and process-
ing hardware is large and bewildering, and
it uncomfortably straddles both the analog
and digital worlds. It’s not always clear if a par-
ticular device will work with a computer, or what de-
vices are necessary for digital audio recording.
This appendix contains a sampling of sound cards, mixers, analog-to-
digital/digital-to-analog converters, microphones, and portable digital
recorders in various price ranges to give you an idea of what is available.
This is far from a comprehensive catalog, but hopefully it will give you a
good start in understanding audio gear.
The simplest Audacity recording setup needs three things: a computer
running Audacity, an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter, and some
kind of interface to connect microphones or musical instruments to your
ADC/DAC. This could be as simple as a laptop and a microphone. You can
start out cheap and simple and build up over time as you want.
Prices, models, features, and operating system support are all moving
targets. My favorite online shopping site is zZounds (http://www.zzounds.com/).
They carry a huge inventory, have great prices, and provide the best custom-
er service. B&H Photo Video are also ﬁrst-rate (http://www.bhphotovideo.com/).

Both sites are great for learning about products and pricing, and they gener-
ate a lot of useful customer reviews.
PCI, PCI-e, PCMCIA Sound Cards
I like PCI and PCI-e for very fast, trouble-free multichannel recording. PCI-e
is faster than PCI, because each PCI-e slot has its down dedicated bus while
PCI devices share bandwidth. Both are excellent and least-hassle.
PCMCIA interfaces are for laptops. PCI, PCI-e, and PCMCIA often re-
quire separate breakout boxes for connecting mics, mixers, preamps, and
other devices. Some of them, in place of breakout boxes, use breakout cable
bundles.

Stand Alone ADC/DACs
A key component in digital audio recording is a good ADC/DAC. As with all
electronics, they come in many forms, from nice combination devices to as
many separate specialized components as you can cram into your studio.
Behringer ADA8000
When you have a lot of mics to connect, you
need something like this. Rackmount 8-channel 24/48 ADC/DAC, 8
microphone preamps, phantom power. All eight channels can be routed
to the ADAT output for connecting to mixers or other devices, and each
channel has individual line outs. $299. To connect this to your com-
puter, you need an audio interface with ADAT ports like the Multiface II
or the Focusrite Safﬁre Pro or an ADAT interface card in your computer.
These come in all the usual interfaces: PCI, PCI-e, and FireWire. These
range from a couple of hundred of dollars to several hundred dollars.
Windows, Linux, and Mac.
Apogee DA16X
There are many stand alone ADC/DACs for the
professional recording studio that do nothing but analog/digital con-
version, like this one. 16 Channel 24/192 ADC/DAC, 2 × D-sub 25 pin
analog outputs, 1 × D-sub 25 pin inputs, ADAT and word clock for syn-
chronizing multiple devices. One way you might use this converter is to
connect your performers to an analog mixer with mic preamps or per-
haps a separate mic preamp, connect the mixer to the Apogee, and then
connect the Apogee to your computer with a FireWire or PCI interface
card. This unit will set you back about $3,000. Windows and Mac.

GLOSSARY
A–E
ADC/DAC
Analog-to-digital converter, digital-to-analog converter. Analog sounds
such as a singer or an instrument are converted to digital form for record-
ing and editing, then converted back to analog for playback. A CD player
is a DAC. Your computer sound card is an ADC/DAC. An ADC is a cru-
cial piece of equipment. A good one performs a good clean accurate
conversion without introducing noise. Bad ones sound strange and add
noise. Some are designed to add some color, for example to sound like
a certain classic tube amp or recording style from the old days.
Amplitude
Figure B-1: Two identical sine
waves with different amplitudes
Amplitude, as it relates to sounds, can
be thought of as pressure; the greater
the pressure, the louder the sound. It is
also described as intensity or energy. You
can see amplitude in a waveform, as in
Figure B-1. Higher peaks mean greater
amplitude. Both tracks are 1,000 Hz sine
waves created with the Generate > Tone
dialog. The top track has an amplitude of
1.0, and the bottom track has an ampli-
tude of 0.2. These two tones are identical except for their amplitudes.
This is physical pressure, which you can experience under certain
conditions. For example, you can see the cone of a subwoofer pulsate
when it is cranked up loud enough and feel the air movement when
you place your hand in front of it. (And people miles away can “enjoy”

listening to it.) Bill Nye the Science Guy has a cool stunt where he extin-
guishes a candle with a homemade sonic cannon. A loud blast of sound
will ripple water.
Sonic cannons have been tested in a number of creative ways, such
as being used as nonlethal police weapons for dispersing crowds. Theo-
retically, a powerful enough sound blast at the right frequency will burst
eardrums. At less powerful levels, and at the right frequencies, it will cre-
ate nausea and feelings of discomfort and nervousness.
Ambience, Ambient Sounds
Any sounds from your surrounding environment. Ambient sounds add
color and energy, such as crowd noises, the sounds of birds and wind in
the trees, or the special sound qualities from recording in a special loca-
tion such as an open ampitheater or an old cathedral. Ambient sounds
can also be unpleasant, like trafﬁc noise and barking dogs.
Analog Hole
A scary bogeyman invented by the entertainment industry that dem-
onstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of both technology and
customer service. Digital media players must convert audio and video
to an analog form so we can hear and see it; this is what comes out of
your speakers and is what you see on your television. If we can see it, it
can be photographed, and if we can hear it, so can a microphone. Of
course, making copies in these ways results in lower-quality copies, but
it shows there is no way to prevent copying by technological means. The
industry’s efforts to “close the analog hole” have resulted in crippled
home entertainment receivers that send a purposely degraded signal
to the analog outputs or that have disabled the analog outputs. This
sort of crippling does not differentiate between media that you have
the right use however you want, such as your home movies on DVD and
homemade music CDs, and the mass-produced gluck they are trying to
“protect.”
It’s all futile anyway, since all forms of copy protection are cracked
sooner or later, and then you can easily make perfect digital copies.
Bit Depth
Controls dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and overall ﬁdelity and
accuracy. A wider dynamic range results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio,
which is also called a lower noise ﬂoor. In other words, you get more of
the sound you want and less noise introduced by your equipment. In
the olden days of recording on tape, there was always tape hiss and a
certain amount of noise from the tape machines. On vinyl LPs, there
is noise from defects in the vinyl and turntable hum. In digital audio,
noise comes from your electronics; good electronics are described as
delivering a clean sound without any introduced noise.
The common bit depths for audio production are 16 bits, 24 bits,
32 bits, and 32-bit ﬂoating point. A larger bit depth results in a more
accurate, more faithful conversion from analog.
324
Appendix B

Bit depth goes hand in hand with sampling rate. Your analog-to-
digital converter “samples” the audio signal so many times per second.
For example, CD-quality is 16 bits at a sampling rate of 44,100 times per
second. Each individual sample is given a binary 16-bit value. Converted
to decimal, each sample is equal to or less than 65,535 (0–65,535).
24-bit depth has a range of 0–16,777,216 possible values, and 32-bit
has 0–4,294,967,295. Note that these are unsigned integer values. For
example, 32-bit ﬂoating point is a 24-bit mantissa plus an 8-bit exponent.
Audacity and many other audio recording applications and DAWs use
32-bit ﬂoat internally because the ﬂoating decimal point allows for a
very high level of precision and creates all kinds of extra headroom so
you can manipulate your audio ﬁles in all kinds of ways without degrad-
ing them.
A bit depth of 16 has a potential dynamic range of 96 dB; 24 bits,
144 dB; and 32 bits, 192 dB. Audio hardware has a hard limit of about
115 dB. The potential dynamic range of 32-bit ﬂoat is about 1,500 dB,
which means a super low noise ﬂoor and far less potential for clipping.
In some of Audacity’s conﬁguration dialogs bit depth is called sample
format. Bit depth is the correct term.
Channel
A single path for any signal. For example, a mono microphone plugged
into a mono input is one input channel. A stereo signal routed to two
speakers has two playback channels. A music system with discrete 5.1
surround sound has six playback channels. If you plug 10 performers
into a mixer and then plug that mixer into a single mono channel, that
is still one input channel even though your entire band is recording
into it.
Many surround-sound receivers can emulate multichannel surround
from a stereo recording. This is not discrete multichannel surround but
plain old two-channel stereo.
Clipping
When a digital audio signal goes over zero dBFS, it is truncated to the
maximum value of the bit depth you are recording in. This can sound
pretty awful, so avoiding clipping is very important in digital audio.
Cross-fade
This is a nice and common effect: A fade-out overlaps a fade-in. Audac-
ity does not have a cross-fade effect, but it is easy to create a cross-fade
using the Envelope and Time Shift tools. You need two tracks: Manu-
ally create a fade-out on one, a fade-in on the other, and then adjust the
degree of overlap with the Time Shift tool.
DAW
Digital audio workstation, which is a combination recorder-mixer. This
can be a stand alone hardware device or a software application or suite
on a computer.
Glossary

dBFS
Decibels relative to full scale; see Decibel.
Decibel
Decibels measure amplitude, or how loud sounds are. One decibel is
one tenth of a bel, which was named for Alexander Graham Bell. Deci-
bels are also used to measure voltage and signal strength.
In audio, a decibel is not an absolute measurement but a ratio
between the sound we are measuring and an arbitrary reference level.
About the smallest change we can perceive is 1 dB. A gain of 3 dB is
about twice as loud, and a reduction of 3 dB is about half as loud. The
intensity, or amplitude, of a sound is not proportional to how we per-
ceive its loudness. Loudness is a psychoacoustic response, and it takes
about a 10 times increase in the intensity of a sound to make it sound
twice as loud.
In digital audio, we use the decibels relative to full scale, abbreviated as
dBFS. Zero is the loudest we can go without clipping, and digital audio
dB values are expressed as negative numbers.
You might see tables that show the decibel levels of various sounds
from the quietest whisper a person can hear, which is zero, to the thresh-
old of pain, which is usually stated as 120 dB. These are not like the dBFS
scale we use in digital audio but the dBA scale, which is commonly used
to measure environmental and industrial noise.
Discrete
This is discrete as in separate, not discreet as in able to keep one’s mouth
shut. Most stereo systems have two discrete playback channels, and dis-
crete 5.1 surround sound means six separate playback channels. Some-
times 5.1 surround is emulated from a stereo track, so this is not discrete
5.1 surround.
Downmix
Combine multiple audio tracks into fewer tracks, as in downmixing six
tracks to two-channel stereo.
Downsample
Convert to a lower sampling rate. For example, CD audio must be 16 bits/
44,100 Hz sample rate, so a 48 kHz audio ﬁle must be downsampled to
44.1 kHz. Resampling can harm audio quality, so the less often you re-
sample an audio ﬁle the better. Resampling once from a master ﬁle for
export to different audio ﬁle formats is all right; if you resample the re-
sampled ﬁle, chances are you will hear the difference.
DRM
Digital rights management, or digital restrictions management, depend-
ing on your point of view. DRM is various copy-protection technologies
designed to prevent illegal copying of copyrighted media.
326
Appendix B

F–J
Frequency
Sound frequencies are measured in hertz, which are cycles per second,
or how long it takes one complete sound wave to pass by a given point
in one second. Higher frequencies create higher-pitched tones. Hertz is
abbreviated as Hz. Kilohertz is kHz, megahertz is MHz, and gigahertz is
GHz. The highest note on an 88-key piano is C8 at 4,186 Hz, or 4.186 kHz.
The Guinness World Records holder for the lowest note produced by a
human voice, Roger Menees, sang an F-sharp at 0.393 Hz. That’s right,
less than 1 hertz and far beyond the lowest key on an 88-key piano key-
board, which is A0 at 27.5 Hz.
Figure B-2 shows two sine waves of the same amplitude but different
frequencies. The top waveform is 100 Hz, and the bottom is 1,000 Hz.
Figure B-2: Two sine waves of the same
amplitude and different frequencies.
NOTE
The ofﬁcial recording that Mr. Menees made to win his Guinness World Record
is the “property” of the Guinness company, so he cannot use this recording of his
own voice.
Fundamental Frequency
Nearly all sounds are complex and have multiple frequencies. When you
play a trombone or strum a guitar, every note has multiple harmonic
frequencies, so which one is the note? It is the lowest frequency; that is
what we call the pitch, and that is what we tune our instruments to. Pitch
is subjective rather than objective; pitch is what we perceive the note to
be. Usually it’s pretty easy to say, “That note is middle C,” or A below C
or F-sharp or what-have-you.
But with some instruments it is not so easy to detect the pitch. For
example, when you beat a gong or a cymbal, can you pick out a distinct
note? With most gongs and cymbals, the overtones and harmonics are so
complex you can’t.
Harmonic Frequencies
A harmonic frequency is a multiple of the fundamental frequency. For
example, when the fundamental frequency is 100 Hz, the ﬁrst harmonic
frequency is 200 Hz, the second is 300 Hz, and so on.
Glossary
327

Hertz

High-Z, Low-Z
See Impedance.
Hotplug
Plug or unplug an electronic device while the power is on. Usually this
is a bad idea because it can make a loud popping noise or even cause
damage, so a good habit to form is to always power your equipment off
before connecting or disconnecting anything.
Impedance
Impedance is electrical resistance. The short story is to always match
your impedances for whatever audio hardware you are connecting.
You’ll want to pay some extra attention to microphone impedance.
Lower impedance is better: 600 ohms or less. Medium impedance is 600
to 10,000 ohms, and high impedance is more than 10,000. Some higher-
end mics support multiple impedance ratings and have switches to select
the one you want to use. When you see High-Z and Low-Z, that is short-
hand for high impedance and low impedance. But these are imprecise,
so it’s better to know your exact ratings.
High-impedance mics are usually lower-quality mics, and they lose
signal strength over longer cable runs. If you can’t match impedances
exactly, connect your mic to an input with the same or higher imped-
ance. If you go the other way, you’ll lose signal strength. Nothing se-
riously bad will happen with mismatched mic and input impedances,
though you might experience loss of signal strength and lesser audio
quality.
A line matching transformer is a useful gadget for connecting devices
with mismatched impendances and converting them to match.
Intellectual Property
An imprecise, misused, meaningless propaganda term. The relevant le-
gal terms are trademark, copyright, and patent.
K–O
Latency
Lag, delay. Low latency is important for overdubbing and for monitor-
ing a recording session. Many things affect latency: the speed of your
computer’s CPU, how lean and clean your operating system is, sound
card drivers, computer busses (USB, PCI, FireWire), special effects pro-
cessors, and other outboard audio devices.
Metadata
Data about data; a means of storing information about a computer ﬁle
inside the ﬁle headers. Audacity has a metadata editor for recording
session information such as artist, title, date, and genre.
328
Appendix B

Mixdown
Same as downmix.
Overdubbing
Making a multitrack recording a few tracks at a time. It’s how one per-
son can record an entire symphony by themselves, one track at a time.
Many commercial recordings are recorded in bits and pieces, and the
performers may never be present at the same recording session or even
use the same studio. In Audacity, you can record an instrument track
and then play it back while you record a second track. There is always
a bit of latency in overdubbing this way, so Audacity has a customizable
latency correction.
P–T
Peak Level
Highest volume level in your recording. Usually peaks are transient
events and are higher and more abrupt than your RMS levels. Peak and
RMS levels are represented by two different shades of blue in Audacity
waveforms.
Phase
Phase is about timing, the location in time of a waveform relative to
its beginning. When the phase of a waveform is nonzero, it has been
moved forward or backward in time. We do this in Audacity with the
Time Shift tool. Sound waves interact with each other in all kinds of
complex and interesting ways, and phase shifting is often used to create
audio special effects. For example, you can create a pleasing echo by
copying an audio track, shifting the phase of the copy a little bit, and
mixing the copy and original back together.
Two waveforms that are exactly in phase combine their amplitudes
and sound louder. Sounds that mix randomly may create totally new
sounds. Two waveforms that are phase-shifted 180 degrees relative to
each other cancel each other out. Noise-cancellation devices do this,
though with varying degrees of effectiveness because sounds are com-
plex and don’t match up exactly. When loudspeakers are not placed
correctly, you might hear part of the song disappear, like the lead singer
sounds muted, because of phase shifting.
When you are placing microphones, you must take phase into ac-
count, especially if you are using multiple mics. For example, it is a com-
mon practice to use multiple mics on a drum kit, with some on the ﬂoor
and some overhead. If they are not spaced correctly, they will be out of
sync and create some lag or phase shift to cause some partial cancella-
tion so the drums sound thin and weak.
Pitch
Pitch and frequency are often thought of as being the same thing, but
they’re not. Frequencies can be measured objectively, while pitch is usu-
ally subjective. The ear can be fooled, as demonstrated by the French
Glossary
329

composer Jean Claude Risset. Mr. Risset is known for creating auditory
illusions such as the Risset rhythm, which sounds as though it is forever
increasing in tempo when in fact it is maintaining the same tempo. The
human ear perceives that a high pitch gets higher as it grows louder,
while a low tone sounds as though its pitch is dropping as it gets louder.
You can easily try this yourself by generating some sine tones at differ-
ent frequencies in Audacity and gradually increasing and decreasing the
volume.
In music, we think of pitch as being the musical notes, so we tune
our instruments to a pitch of middle C, or G below C, or whatever the
notes/pitches are.
Psychoacoustics
The study of how humans perceive sounds. Much of our perception is
relative; for example, going out into trafﬁc noise isn’t as dramatic an
event after a day of working in a noisy store as when leaving a quiet li-
brary. Some sounds mask other sounds, and so we might use white noise
to mask other noise.
Audio is very subjective, and recordings can be tailored to take ad-
vantage of psychoacoustics. Modern high-tech hearing aids use psychoa-
coustic models to make noises sound more natural. Psychoacoustic mod-
els are used to make lossy audio formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis
sound better.
RMS
Root mean square, or the average volume of your recording over time.
Contrast with the Peak Level, which is the highest volume level. Audac-
ity represents RMS and peak levels with two different shades of blue in
waveforms.
Sample Format
See Bit Depth.
Sampling Rate
The number of times per second the analog-to-digital converter “sam-
ples” the analog signal. The sampling rate determines the frequency
range of your recording. Theoretically, a perfect digital representation
of an analog audio signal is possible when the sampling rate is at least
twice as high as the highest frequency in the signal. The best human
hearing can hear up to 20–24 kHz, so a sampling rate of 40–48 kHz can
(theoretically) reproduce the entire range of human hearing.
Tempo
The speed of the music in beats per minute. You might have noticed
that tempo and energy don’t always correlate with each other—that
some songs with slow tempos have great energy, while some faster songs
feel draggy. Try listening more closely when you notice this—is it some
quality projected by the performers? The rhythm section? Is it because
the song is in a minor key, or a major key?
330
Appendix B

Threshold of Pain
The sound pressure level (amplitude) at which we feel pain. This varies
a little among individual people, and it varies only slightly at different
frequencies.
Timbre
Timbre, pronounced TAM-ber, is a catch-all term for describing the qual-
ity of a sound, such as warm, cold, soft, brittle, reedy, full, rich, thin,
breathy, stout, and so on. Timbre describes the qualities that differen-
tiate different instruments even when they play the same notes, like cel-
los, violas, and violins; bassoons and bass clarinets; or very similar instru-
ments such as two acoustic guitars.
Try listening to any older Allman Brothers Band recording and see
if you can tell the difference between the two lead guitar players, Duane
Allman and Dickey Betts. The Tiptons Sax Quartet is four saxophone
players and a drummer, so their recordings are splendid for honing
your listening skills. When you listen to the B-52s, can you tell Cindy Wil-
son and Kate Pierson apart?
Track
A track, like a channel, is any single audio path or unit. A mono track
in Audacity is a single track. A stereo track in Audacity is also a single
track, even though it has two discrete channels, because Audacity sees
it as a single unit and anything you do to it is applied equally to both
channels. When you burn an audio CD, you can choose TAO (track at
once), which means the laser burns your entire track without pauses.
This single CD track can have multiple songs, and a single song is also a
track.
Transient Response
An abrupt high-energy peak in a waveform caused by a sudden event
like a drumbeat, a hard-strummed string, or a bumped microphone.
U–Z
Upsample
Convert to a higher sampling rate; for example, resampling a 44.1 kHz
audio ﬁle to 48 kHz. Upsampling is pointless because it does not im-
prove audio quality and, in fact, may introduce some defects. You should
upsample only when you have to meet speciﬁc requirements for certain
tasks, such as upsampling a 22,050 Hz ﬁle for CD audio, which must be
44.1 kHz.
VU Meter
VU stands for volume unit. You might recall VU meters from the olden
days of analog tape recording, which we used to monitor recording
volume levels. VU meters typically had a scale of 20 to +3, a moving
needle, and a little red clipping or peak light. VU meters had a rather
slow response time, though avoiding clipping was not as crucial for ana-
log recording as it is for digital recording.

SEVEN MYTHS OF DIGITAL AUDIO
There are a number of persistent, silly au-
dio myths that refuse to die. The funny part
is that a few blind listening tests would dis-
prove them, or as the old geek saying goes, “One
experiment is worth a thousand arguments.” Here are
my favorites.
The Myth of the Golden Ear
Some audiophiles love to obsess over specs and are convinced that, yes,
they too can hear super-high frequencies just like bats, and the super-low
frequencies just like whatever animal hears super-low frequencies, and they
need every last possible hertz, and it must be ﬁltered through special organic
electricity or their listening experience is ruined. Their equipment must be
elite and overpriced, and the Sacred Listening Room must be specially en-
gineered. They are more sensitive than ordinary mortals, and we just don’t
appreciate what they go through.
Salespeople and equipment reviewers exploit this attitude mercilessly.
It’s a proven way to sell overpriced gear. These salespeople and reviewers
don’t have any special hearing abilities, just acute sensitivities to the smell
of money.

Of course, it is true that hearing acuity and perception vary among in-
dividual people, but in any random assortment of humans with good, un-
damaged hearing, the differentiator is how educated their ears are. This is
true of all of our senses—when you know what to look for, you become an
ace birdwatcher. When you learn to differentiate different ﬂavors, aromas,
and characteristics in wine, it becomes a multifaceted pleasure instead of just
an easy, pleasant buzz. Experienced riders learn how to interpret all the sig-
nals a horse gives—mood, intent, what’s ahead—and how to communicate
back to the horse. Just like everything else we do, listening is a learning pro-
cess. You might start out unable to tell the difference between a viola and a
violin, but with experience you learn to identify the individual musicians in
a band or orchestra. Even when it’s the Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone
Quartet. That’s right, four saxophone players and nothing else; two alto,
one tenor, and one baritone sax. To the inexperienced ear, it’s just a blur
of saxophones, but with a bit of listening, you can tell right away who is play-
ing what.
Back in the olden analog days, they didn’t have super-duper hi-ﬁre-
cording studios, and they sure as heck didn’t have super-duper hi-ﬁplayback
devices. The best recordings from the olden days feature talented, skilled
musicians and talented, skilled engineers who knew how to get the most out
of their equipment. If specs are all that matter, we might as listen to pure
sine waves. There are no shortcuts to spending time listening, comparing,
experimenting, and learning to listen.
The Myth of Burn-In
This is another one that deserves a wooden stake through its vitals. Audio
electronics and speakers sound the same when they’re brand-new as they do
after decades of use, barring damage and component failure. Giving them
a period of “burn-in,” which is simply switching them on and then leaving
them on for whatever magic burn-in interval is required, is silly and does
nothing to change how they sound.
Tube amp-o-philes are particularly prone to burn-in ﬁts and will in-
sist that a new amp sounds “cold” and, after 24 hours or whatever, sounds
“warm.” ’Taint so; it’s all the same. There are many things that affect how
we perceive sounds: temperature, humidity, mood, whether we are rested or
tired, whether we have been in a quiet or noisy environment all day. Audio
electronics are pretty much always the same.
The Myth of Tube Superiority
Tube amps are obsolete. Solid-state does everything they can do, cheaper
and better and with less distortion. Tube amps need more service over their
lifetimes because tubes burn out and lose power, and you might even need
to re-tension their sockets. You’ve probably heard lyrical odes to the “tube
sound.” Tube amps are perfectly good for those who prefer them. If there is
334
Appendix C

a “tube sound” that you like, it is most likely distortion created by the amp. If
you want your amps to be neutral and reproduce your audio as accurately as
possible, you want solid-state.
The Myth of Uber Cables
You’re welcome to spend signiﬁcant wads of money on cables if you really
want to. You’ll probably get more enjoyment out of papering your walls with
dollar bills, lighting cigars with twenties, or making stylish garments out of
Ben Franklins, because spending gobs of money on audio cables does not
make them better than sensibly priced cables. You’ll want to avoid weird,
cruddy, no-name brands, but otherwise any cable that is manufactured to
the appropriate speciﬁcations is equal to any other. Look for good construc-
tion, strong connectors, good insulation, and specs and identifying informa-
tion printed on the sheaths. Sometimes there are useful options like right-
angle plugs or swivel plugs. If you want to waste your money, do please pick
something more worthy than overpriced audio cables.
Gold-plated connectors add shininess, higher price tags, and some cor-
rosion resistance. They don’t make the sound better.
The Myth of Analog Superiority
Analog audio cannot compete with digital audio for ﬁdelity; signal-to-noise
ratio; lack of distortion; and ease of editing, manipulation, and reproduc-
tion. Some folks like analog artifacts such as the “fat” sound of pushing ana-
log circuits to their limits, distortion, feedback, and so on. No worries, every-
one is entitled to their preferences. Though it’s worth noting these can be
reproduced in digital audio.
The Myth That You Don’t Need Tone Controls
This one really gets my goat. You enter the high-end snooty audio store to
try out some high-quality equipment. Hey, why not, you won’t know until
you listen to it, right? You are escorted to The Room of Acoustic Perfection.
There you are seated in the precisely positioned Listening Chair, in front of
banks of speakers, amps, preamps, no receivers because those are not snooty
enough, and high-end CD players. These are all connected to a switching
system so that you can easily try out different combinations. Very nice so far.
Your salesperson will be into something above the common herd; perhaps
jazz, maybe some classical, maybe some off-the-wall independent labels. Cer-
tainly no Top 40 or teenybop pop.
So on goes the music, and you sink back into pleasant bliss. But as you
listen, you notice it’s not quite right. You want a little less treble, perhaps,
and a little more bass. Maybe the midrange is a touch wimpy and you want
to kick it up a tick or two. Tough luck, buster, because those ﬁne amps only
control volume and balance. You don’t get tone controls. Why? Because, as
Seven Myths of Digital Audio
335

the salesperson explains, real audiophiles listen to the music as it is “meant
to be listened to.” So no tone controls for you, and if you want any, then you
are defective. Though not too defective to drop a few thousand dollars on
a hi-ﬁsystem with no tone controls; fortunately, the salesperson is magnani-
mous and will permit you to do that.
Unfortunately, this is a complete myth. Most recordings are not “per-
fectly engineered”; all of them are compromises. Because even the best-
engineered recordings are not proof against the environments they are
played in or the individual characteristics of your hi-ﬁcomponents. They
will sound different depending what they are played on, the rooms they
are played in, temperature and humidity, your moods—every day it’s a lit-
tle different, and God gave us tone controls so we could hear recordings the
way we want to. Maybe you have some big bad feelings to work off and need
some aggressive subwoofering. Maybe you want it light and soothing. Maybe
you just like to twiddle knobs. That is your right, and you must not allow pre-
tentious salespersons to take it away from you.
The Myth That Someone Else Knows Better Than You
For the most part, fussy audiophiles are fussy about all the wrong things.
There are two categories of people who can teach you actual useful knowl-
edge, and those are musicians and recording engineers. I mean real musi-
cians and real recording engineers, not wannabes who think that when the
knob goes to 11 it means the amp is louder than amps that go to 10. Record-
ing engineers are just as much artists as engineers, and even mediocre ones
can teach you a lot about the nuts and bolts of making recordings.
It takes practice, experimentation, and a lot of listening, and the ulti-
mate decision about what is good is entirely yours. You have to learn to train
your own ear and taste and not depend on what other people tell you be-
cause they don’t experience audio the same way you do. Especially if they’re
trying to sell you something.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful docu-
ment "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redis-
tribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, 
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not 
being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document 
must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, 
which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free 
software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the 
same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can 
be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed 
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or refer-
ence.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed 
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a 
notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under 
the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any 
member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, 
modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a por-
tion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another lan-
guage.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that 
deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Doc-
ument's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly 
within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Sec-
ondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of histor-
ical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, 
ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as 
being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under 
this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to 
be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Docu-
ment does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or 
Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A 
Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a 
format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the doc-
ument straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic 
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for 
input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to 
text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence 
of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not 
Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A 
copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, 
Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and 
standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. 
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include 
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or 
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-
generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes 
only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages 
as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For 
works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the 
most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the 
public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is pre-
cisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another lan-
guage. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as 
"Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of 
such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" 
according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this 
License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by 
reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that 
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncom-
mercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this 
License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other condi-
tions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or con-
trol the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may 
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies 
you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly 
display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the 
Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, 
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-
Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also 
clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the 
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on 
the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the 
title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other 
respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the 
first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adja-
cent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, 
you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or 
state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general net-
work-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete 
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you 
must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, 
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at 
least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents 
or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before 
redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated 
version of the Document.
4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sec-
tions 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, 
with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and mod-
ification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do 
these things in the Modified Version:
z
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Docu-
ment, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the 
History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the 
original publisher of that version gives permission.
z
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for 
authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the 
principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), 
unless they release you from this requirement.
z
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the pub-
lisher.
z
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
z
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copy-
right notices.
z
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public per-
mission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in 
the Addendum below.
z
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover 
Texts given in the Document's license notice.
z
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

z
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at 
least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the 
Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the 
title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an 
item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
z
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Trans-
parent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document 
for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You 
may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the 
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
z
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the 
section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor 
acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
z
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their 
titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
z
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the 
Modified version.
z
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title 
with any Invariant Section.
z
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as 
Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option 
designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invari-
ant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any 
other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorse-
ments of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or 
that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 
words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only 
one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through 
arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the 
same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting 
on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission 
from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to 
use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the 
terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combi-
nation all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them 
all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all 
their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical 
Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections 
with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding 
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if 
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of 
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various origi-
nal documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled 
"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Enti-
tled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under 
this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a 
single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License 
for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually 
under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and 
follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent docu-
ments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" 
if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compi-
lation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an 
aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not them-
selves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, 
then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts 
may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic 
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on 
printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Docu-
ment under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires spe-
cial permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all 
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may 
include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any War-
ranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and 
the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the 
translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version 
will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", 
the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the 
actual title.
9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, 
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copy-
right holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and 
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of 
the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the 
copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you 
have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and 
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties 
who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been termi-
nated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does 
not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documenta-
tion License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document 
specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of 
any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever 
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a 
proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement 
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server 
that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit 
those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Mul-
tiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works 
thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by 
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business 
in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that 
same organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of 
another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that 
were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently 
incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-
SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicens-
ing.
How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the 
document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:
    Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the 
"with...Texts." line with this:
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the 
three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing 
these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General 
Public License, to permit their use in free software.
