Preface to the Fourth Edition
It is my great pleasure to author the fourth edition of Textbook of Microbiol-
ogy and Immunology, a book which has received huge support from the
readers across India and abroad for the previous editions. A large number of
suggestions and feedback were received from the faculty members and
students using the previous edition of the book and a sincere attempt has
been made to incorporate the appropriate suggestions while preparing this
edition.
In the backdrop of the transitions of modern healthcare from generic to
personalized, One health replacing the health, medical education is going
through transformations to accommodate the new and revise or update the
basics. In this landscape, the resurgence of existing pathogens, emerging and
re-emerging infections, and the worldwide phenomenon of antimicrobial
resistance have made microbiology more relevant where contextual clinical
interventions demand more corroboration with accurate diagnosis and
syndrome-based investigation rather than classical organismal views. It has
been future triggered by our present century’s experience with the COVID-19
pandemic where parallel scientiﬁc advances in terms of molecular tools and
technology and their affordability as a whole have brought whole new
revolutions in our understandings and dealings with pathogens. As such, a
reﬂection of these developments in the existing academic book was necessary
for the fraternity including the student and teachers.
The recent introduction of “Competency-Based Medical Education”
(CBME) by the National Medical Commission, India, has resulted in a sea
change in the microbiology syllabus for the undergraduate (MBBS) and
postgraduate (MD) students of this country. The approach has shifted from
organism-related teaching to system and syndrome-based exposition of infec-
tious diseases which is more relevant for the training of a medical student in
Faculty of Medicine.
This fourth edition of Textbook of Microbiology and Immunology has,
therefore, made the ﬁrst attempt to be more inclusive and contextual to meet
the current demand gap in simplistic approaches keeping stock of the latest
development in the ﬁeld of medical microbiology and immunology. While
doing so, this book has blended the traditional organism-based learning and a
syndromic approach to infectious disease, together with the introduction of
new and modiﬁed chapters incorporating the latest information in this ﬁeld.
This book contains 72 chapters distributed in six speciﬁc sections.

Preface to the Fourth Edition
Part I deals with the aspects of General Microbiology. Whereas the earlier
books in the subject dealt almost exclusively with bacteria in focus, in this
edition due importance has been given to other classes of microbes like fungi,
viruses, etc. Separate chapters have been assigned to these organisms so that
the student can have a baseline knowledge about them. In addition, the
chapters on antimicrobial agents and diagnostic methods have been
completely rewritten to encompass all pathogenic microbes and parasites. A
notable feature is the addition of a new chapter on genomics and proteomics
which are gaining increasing importance not only in Microbiology but in
almost all specialties of medical sciences.
Part II deals with immunology in the context of medical education and
requirements. It has been revised to make it more concise and updated to
accommodate the newer developments in this ﬁeld. Each chapter has detailed
components of immune systems, diseases, etc. and has described the underly-
ing processes.
Parts III, IV and V deal with bacteriology, virology and basic mycology,
respectively. Wherein the ﬁrst few chapters of these sections describe the
history and current status and approaches involving antimicrobial therapy and
laboratory diagnosis including molecular; the rest of the chapters give a
speciﬁc look into different types of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. This
book contains the latest updates on their description, taxonomic status and
diseases including the symptoms. It also considers the detection and manage-
ment roadmaps that have been prescribed by the competent national and
international regulatory bodies.
Part VI describes the applied aspects of clinical microbiology. It deals with
pathogens in water, milk, air and food, and also collects information on the
plethora of healthcare-associated infections. It also updates knowledge on
waste handling, management, diagnostic modalities and quality assurance
strategies and program in a diagnostic laboratory. As such, this section shall
act as a handbook for the practitioner and the laboratory personnel to provide
good
services
by
maintaining
appropriate
measures
and
regulatory
compliances.
Glossary and Further readings are also included, at the end, for the beneﬁt
of all.
I hope that the book in its new format will be well appreciated by the
readers and can serve not only as a textbook for undergraduate medical
students but will also form a foundation base for the postgraduate students
on which they can build up their more advanced knowledge. Any suggestion
or feedback from the readers will be highly appreciated and can be addressed
to me subhashparija@gmail.com for further improvement in subsequent
editions.

Preface to the First Edition
The intent of the book is to provide an up-to-date information on microbial
diseases which are emerging as an important health problem worldwide. This
book has been written to provide a comprehensive coverage of basic and
clinical microbiology, including immunology, bacteriology, virology and
mycology, in a clear and succinct manner. The book also intends to provide
an accurate presentation of clinically relevant information to the learners of
medical microbiology.
Textbook of Microbiology and Immunology consists of six sections. Parts I
and II deals with general microbiology and immunology, respectively. Parts
III, IV and V deals with bacteriology, virology and mycology, respectively.
Lastly, Part VI deals with applied microbiology and includes epidemiology
and control of community infections, hospital infections, antimicrobial che-
motherapy, water analysis and immunisation.
Emphasis, throughout the text, is made on the clinical applications of
microbiology to study infectious diseases.
Cultivation and identiﬁcation of each organism along with pathogenesis of
diseases, clinical manifestations, diagnostic laboratory tests, treatment and
prevention and control of resulting infections are thoroughly updated to
include most recent advances in the ﬁeld. Details are summarised in the
tabular format. Clinical cases are provided in most of the chapters. The
book is profusely illustrated with line diagrams and photomicrographs both
black and white and colour.
I believe this book will be a useful source of comprehensive information
for students mainly the undergraduate students of medicine, allied sciences
and others who are interested in medical microbiology.
I welcome reader’s views and suggestions for further improvement of
the book in the future edition. Suggestions may kindly be e-mailed at
subhashparija@yahoo.co.in.

Introduction and History
of Microbiology
1
Medical Microbiology
Medical microbiology is a branch of microbiol-
ogy that deals with the study of microorganisms
including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites of
medical importance that are capable of causing
diseases in humans. It also includes the study of
microbial
pathogenesis,
disease
pathology,
immunology and epidemiology of diseases.
Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553 AD), a physi-
cian, suggested that invisible living creatures
caused disease. In his book “De contagione,
contagiosis morbiset curatione (On Contagion,
Contagious
Diseases
and
their
Treatment)”,
published in 1546, he proposed the revolutionary
theory that infectious diseases are transmitted
from person to person by minute, invisible
particles, or seminaria, that are self-replicating
and act on the body’s humours to cause disease.
However, his theories were ahead of time. They
were proved only after 200 years when the micro-
scope was invented.
Scientists and Their Contributions
to the Development of Microbiology
Anton van Leeuwenhoek: The
Microscopist
The
ﬁrst
person
to
observe
and
describe
microorganisms
accurately
was
an
amateur
microscopist
Antony
van
Leeuwenhoek
(1632–1723) of Delft, Holland. Leeuwenhoek
earned his living as a draper and haberdasher
(a dealer in men’s clothing and accessories).
However, he spent much of his spare time
constructing simple microscopes composed of
double convex glass lenses held between two
silver plates. His microscopes could magnify
around 50–300 times. In 1673, Leeuwenhoek
sent detailed letters describing his discoveries to
the Royal Society of London. It is clear from his
descriptions that he saw both bacteria and
protozoa. However, he did not evaluate these
organisms as agents of disease.

Louis Pasteur: Father of Microbiology
Louis Pasteur, a French microbiologist, is known
as the father of medical microbiology for his
immense contributions to the ﬁeld of medical
microbiology (Fig. 1.1). He ﬁrst coined the term
“microbiology” for the study of organisms of
microscopic
size.
Many
of
his
signiﬁcant
contributions
are
discussed
in
subsequent
sections.

(germ theory of disease). Pasteur had resolved
the controversy by 1861 and had shown how
to keep solutions sterile.
In the early nineteenth century, support for the
germ theory of disease began to accumulate.
Agostino Bassi (1773–1856) ﬁrst showed that
a microorganism could cause disease in 1835
by demonstrating that a fungal infection
caused
the
silkworm
disease.
He
also
suggested that many diseases were due to
microbial infections. In 1845, MJ Berkeley
proved that a fungus caused the great potato
blight of Ireland.
2. Pasteurisation: Pasteur, for the ﬁrst time,
demonstrated
that
he
could
kill
many
microorganisms in wine by heating and then
rapidly cooling the wine, a process now called
pasteurisation.
Before pasteurisation, the concept of heating
to kill microbes had existed. It was common to
protect the beer and vinegar. Nicolas Appert,
the inventor of in-container sterilisation, also
known as canning, had already shown that
treating
food
with
heat
could
preserve
it. However, Pasteur determined the exact
time and temperature that would kill the
harmful microorganisms in the wine without
changing its taste. For this, he obtained a pat-
ent
for
the
process
by
the
name
of
pasteurisation. The process was ﬁrst used com-
mercially in 1862 to protect milk.
3. Vaccination
In 1877, Pasteur studied anthrax, a disease
mainly of cattle and sheep. He developed a
vaccine using a weakened strain of the anthrax
bacillus, Bacillus anthracis. He attenuated the
culture of anthrax bacillus by incubation at a
high temperature of 42–43 C and inoculated
the attenuated bacilli in the animals. He
demonstrated that animals receiving inocula-
tion of such attenuated strains developed spe-
ciﬁc protection against anthrax. In 1885, he
also developed the ﬁrst vaccine against rabies
in humans that saved millions of human lives
worldwide. Pasteur coined the term “vaccine”
to commemorate Edward Jenner, who used
such
preparations
for
protection
against
smallpox.
Joseph Lister: The Pioneer of Antiseptics
Indirect evidence that microorganisms are the
agents of human disease came from English sur-
geon Joseph Lister (1827–1912). Lister devel-
oped an antiseptic surgery system to prevent
wound
infections
from
preventing
microorganisms from entering the wounds. In
this system, the instruments were sterilised by
heat and phenol was used in the surgical dressing.
Phenol was also used to clean the surgical area.
This system was successful, and it transformed
the way surgery was done. It also provided strong
indirect evidence for the role of microorganisms
in disease because phenol, which killed the bacte-
ria, also prevented wound infections.
Robert Koch: The Founder of Koch
Postulates
German physician Robert Koch (1843–1910) was
the ﬁrst to directly demonstrate the role of bacte-
ria in causing disease from the study of anthrax.

Koch used the criteria proposed by his former
teacher, Jacob Henle (1809–1885), to establish
the
relationship
between
B.
anthracis
and
anthrax. He published his ﬁndings in 1876,
brieﬂy
describing
the
scientiﬁc
method
he
followed.
1. Koch Postulates: Koch postulates (criteria)
were useful to prove the claim that a microor-
ganism isolated from disease was indeed caus-
ally related to it. A microorganism was
accepted as the causative agent of infectious

disease only when it satisﬁed all the following
criteria (Fig. 1.2):
(a)
The microorganism must be present in
every case of the disease but absent
from a healthy host.
(b)
The suspected microorganism must be
isolated and grown in pure culture from
lesions of the disease.

(e)
The speciﬁc antibodies to the bacterium
should be demonstrable in the serum of
patients suffering from the disease. This
was an additional criterion that was
introduced subsequently.
Most human bacterial pathogens satisfy Koch
postulates except for Mycobacterium leprae
and Treponema pallidum, the causative agents
of leprosy and syphilis, respectively. Both
these bacteria are yet to be grown in cell-free
culture media.
2. Solid medium for the culture of bacteria:
Koch pioneered the use of agar as a base for
culture media. He developed the pour plate
method and was the ﬁrst to use solid culture
media for the culture of bacteria. This devel-
opment made possible the isolation of pure
cultures that contained only one type of bacte-
rium and directly stimulated progress in all
areas of bacteriology. Koch also developed
media suitable for growing bacteria isolated
from the body. He developed the nutrient
broth and nutrient agar media that are still
widely used worldwide. In 1882, Koch had
used these techniques to isolate the bacillus
that caused tuberculosis in humans. He also
discovered that cholera was caused by Vibrio
cholerae. He invented the hot air oven and
steam steriliser, and introduced methods to
determine the efﬁcacy of antiseptics.
3. Koch Phenomenon: Koch phenomenon is a
hypersensitivity reaction against tuberculosis
bacilli demonstrated in guinea pigs. Koch
ﬁrst demonstrated this, wherein he showed
that guinea pigs already infected with tubercle
bacillus developed an exaggerated inﬂamma-
tory response on a challenge with tubercle
bacillus or its protein.
There
followed
a
golden
age
of
about
40–50 years in which most of the major bacterial
pathogens were isolated (Table 1.1).
The Science of Virology
In 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky, a Russian scientist,
demonstrated that the sap of leaves infected with
tobacco mosaic disease retains its infectious
properties
even
after
ﬁltration
through
Chamberland ﬁlter candles. This provided an
operational deﬁnition of viruses and an experi-
mental technique by which an agent could be
considered a virus.
Beijerinck,
a
Dutch
soil
microbiologist,
showed that the ﬁltered sap could be diluted and
then regain its strength after replication in the
living and growing tissue of the plant. The agent
could reproduce itself but only in living tissues,
not in the cell-free sap of the plant. This explained
the failure to culture the pathogen outside its host.
These observations contributed immensely to
discovering an organism smaller than bacteria

(a ﬁlterable agent) that is not observable in the
light microscope and can reproduce itself only in
living cells or tissues. Beijerinck called this agent
a contagium vivumﬂuidum or a contagious living
liquid.
Immunology as a New Discipline
7
The concept of contagium vivumﬂuidum or a
contagious living liquid began a 25-year debate
about the nature of viruses: whether they were
liquids or particles? This conﬂict was laid to rest
when d’Herelle developed the plaque assay in
1917 and the development of electron microscopy
by
Ruska
(1934)
when
the
ﬁrst
electron
micrographs of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
were taken in 1939. After that, viruses were
accepted as particles.
Loefﬂer and Frosch (1898) described and
isolated the ﬁrst ﬁlterable agent from animals,
the foot-and-mouth disease virus of cattle. Walter
Reed and his team in Cuba (1902) recognised the
ﬁrst human ﬁlterable virus, the yellow fever virus.
Landsteiner and Popper (1909) demonstrated that
poliomyelitis was caused by a ﬁlterable virus and
successfully
transmitted
the
infection
to
monkeys.
Goodpasture
(1930)
used
chick
embryos for the cultivation of viruses.
Initially, the term virus (taken from the Latin
for slimy liquid or poison) was used interchange-
ably for any infectious agent and so was applied
to TMV and all other agents of the class.
d’Herelle and Twort: Founders
of the Principles of Modern Virology
Twort
and
d’Herelle
(1915)
independently
observed
a
lytic
phenomenon
in
bacterial
cultures,
which
they
attributed
to
viruses.
d’Herelle named these viruses as bacteriophages.
He developed the use of limiting dilutions with
the plaque assay to titre the virus preparation. He
suggested that the appearance of plaques in the
plaque assay shows the viruses to be particulate or
corpuscular.
d’Herelle also demonstrated that the attach-
ment (adsorption) of the virus to the host cell is
the ﬁrst step in the pathogenesis of a virus infec-
tion. The attachment of a virus occurred when
only bacteria sensitive to the virus were mixed
with it, demonstrating the host range speciﬁcity of
a virus at the adsorption step. He described the
process of cell lysis and subsequently the release
of infectious virus particles. He developed many
other techniques that are still used in virology.
d’Herelle was, in many ways, one of the founders
of the principles of modern virology.
Immunology as a New Discipline
In the ﬁfth century AD, the earliest smallpox
inoculation took place in China. In the 1900s,
John Lister, an English merchant, reported the
Chinese method to the Royal Society. A Jesuit
priest, Father d’Entrecolles, provided the details
of this method, and according to him, scabs from
pustules are to be collected, and a powder made
from them is to be blown into an infant’s nose.
Pus-coated scabs or thread can be stored, but the
operation was usually face-to-face with a patient.
In 1747, the same method was used in Japan. A
tika or dot would be made on the child, usually on
the
child’s
foot,
by
tikadars
during
the
pre-colonial period in India.
In 1798, Edward Jenner, an English physician,
signiﬁcantly improved this method. Jenner was
fascinated that the milkmaid who had contracted
cowpox’s mild disease was subsequently immune
to
smallpox.
This
made
him
believe
that
inoculating cowpox pustule into people may pro-
tect them against smallpox. He tested this idea on
an 8-year-old boy by inoculating him with ﬂuid
from a cowpox pustule, and later, he infected the
child with smallpox. As predicted, the child did
not develop smallpox. Pasteur followed this up
with the development of vaccines for chicken
cholera, anthrax and rabies. Although Pasteur
proved that vaccination worked, he could not
explain how.
The experimental work of Emil von Behring
and Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1890 gave the ﬁrst
insight into the mechanism of immunity. They
demonstrated that serum contained elements that
protected against infections, thus laying the foun-
dation for identifying humoral immunity. In rec-
ognition of this work, von Behring received the
Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901.

Introduction and History of Microbiology
In 1883, Elie Metchnikoff showed that cells
also contribute to the animal’s immunity, even
before that a serum component could transfer
immunity was discovered. He was able to observe
that
a
few
white
blood
cells
ingested
microorganisms and other foreign material. He
named them phagocytes. He also found that
these phagocytes were more active in immunised
animals. Therefore, he hypothesised that cells
other than the serum components were the major
effector of immunity. The active phagocytic cells
identiﬁed by Metchnikoff were most likely blood
monocytes and neutrophils.
One of the greatest enigmas facing early
immunologists was the speciﬁcity of the antibody
molecule for foreign material or antigen. The
following theories were proposed to explain this
mechanism of speciﬁcity:
1. The selective theory: The earliest conception
of the selective theory dates back to Paul
Ehrlich in 1900. In the 1930s and 1940s, the
selective theory was challenged by various
instructional theories, in which antigen played
a central role in determining the speciﬁcity of
the antibody molecule.
2. The instructional theory: According to the
instructional theories, a particular antigen
would serve as a template around which the
antibody would fold. Friedrich Breinl and
Felix Haurowitz ﬁrst postulated this in the
1930s and redeﬁned it in the 1940s in terms
of protein folding by Linus Pauling.
3. The clonal selection theory: The instructional
theories were formally disproved in the 1960s,
during which information was beginning to
appear
regarding
the
structure
of
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), Ribonucleic
Acid (RNA) and protein. This information
offered new insights into the vexing problem
of how an individual could make antibodies
against almost anything. Then, in the 1950s,
selective theories resurfaced due to new exper-
imental data and through the pioneering
contributions of Niels Jerne, David Talmadge
and F. Macfarlane Burnet. They reﬁned it into
a theory that came to be known as the clonal
selection theory.
The Discovery of Chemotherapeutic
Agents
There was no chemical treatment against bacterial
infections until the 1930s. Prevention was the
only way to protect patients. The Western culture
was obsessed with the threat of germs and the
responsibility to avoid infection. During this time,
there was lots of hope for a wonder drug. In 1889,
Paul Vuillemin, a pupil of Louis Pasteur, coined
the term “antibiosis”.
Paul Ehrlich invented the precursor technique
to Gram-staining of bacteria. He demonstrated
that
dyes
react
speciﬁcally
with
various
components of blood cells and the cells of other
tissues. Then he tested the dyes for therapeutic
properties. He developed Salvarsan, an arsenical
compound, in 1909. The compound, known as
the “magic bullet”, could destroy T. pallidum, the
causative agent of syphilis. This treatment proved
effective against syphilis. This work was of
epochal importance, stimulating research that
led to the development of sulpha drugs, penicillin
and other antibiotics. He, therefore, is known as
the father of chemotherapy.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are a particular class of drugs gener-
ally obtained from microorganisms and are used
to treat bacterial infections. However, they are
ineffective against viral infections and most
other infections. Antibiotics are secreted as sec-
ondary metabolites by microorganisms to protect
them from other microorganisms. The word
“antibiotic” did not follow immediately, but the
drug pyocyanase, a weakly effective antibiotic,
was marketed from the late nineteenth century
into the 1930s. Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928
accidentally discovered that a substance produced
by the fungus destroyed the pyogenic bacteria,
staphylococci. This initiated the beginning of the
antibiotic era. Other similar antibiotics were dis-
covered in rapid succession. The sulphonamide
drugs discovered subsequently offered cures for
many bacterial infections.

Impact of Molecular Biology in Medical Microbiology
9
From their accidental discovery to the present
era, several classes of antibiotics have been
identiﬁed from various microorganisms. It has
long served as a tool for humanity for protection
against pathogenic bacteria. Unfortunately, this
has historically led to the misuse of antibiotics
that has offered pathogens to develop resistance
against antibiotics. The development of such anti-
biotic resistance is one of today’s leading public
health threats. Limited therapeutic options in the
absence of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections
increase the morbidity and mortality associated
with the infectious diseases caused by bacteria. A
group
of
pathogens,
collectively
called
ESKAPE—comprising six bacterial pathogens,
Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,
Klebsiella
pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter
baumannii,
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
Enterobacter
spp.—have
disturbed
health
systems globally, leading to life-threatening nos-
ocomial infections due to multidrug resistance. In
addition to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria,
which are resistant to more than one antimicrobial
drug, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria
have been developed, which are resistant to all
or almost all approved antimicrobial agents.
Given the limitation of currently circulating
antibiotics, a growing need has been felt to ﬁnd
newer classes of antibiotics through extensive
research and development (R&D). In this direc-
tion, the Global Antibiotic Research and Devel-
opment
Partnership
(GARDP)
has
been
developed jointly by the WHO and the Drugs
for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi). The
GARDP, with an aim to accelerate and deliver
new and improved antibiotics to tackle drug-
resistant infections, is working with more than
50
public
and
private
sector
partners
in
20 countries.
Impact of Molecular Biology
in Medical Microbiology
In today’s world, humans have a greater under-
standing of the infectious organism due to the
ability to look into the gene structure-function
level. This approach, which belongs to molecular
biology, has greatly escalated efforts towards
pathogen detection, surveillance, host-pathogen
interaction and ﬁnding medical countermeasures
that have accumulated more efﬁciency and accu-
racy in medical microbiology. In clinical settings,
it could detect antimicrobial resistance genes and
provide public health information such as strain
characterisation by genotyping and also facilitate
improved treatment of viral infections by viral
resistance and viral load testing against antiviral
therapies. Molecular epidemiology is far more
advanced and newer approaches to epidemiologi-
cal investigations and has emerged by combining
molecular biology with traditional epidemiology.
It looks at and investigates diseases by consider-
ing genetics and environmental factors at a
molecular level. This helps identify important
molecules, genes and pathways that inﬂuence
disease development and enable accurate elucida-
tion of disease aetiology, distribution pattern and
penetrance in families and populations. Histori-
cally, the phrase “Molecular epidemiology” was
introduced by Kilbeurne in 1973 in his article
“Molecular Epidemiology of Inﬂuenza” and
later formalised by Schulte and Perera in their
book on Molecular Epidemiology: “principles
and practice”.
As such, from the traditional approaches of
understanding microbes from phenotypes and
biochemical properties, the present era is marked
with dealing with the DNA, RNA and protein of a
microorganism
or
whole
community
of
microorganisms
either
culturable
or
non-culturable
approaches.
The
journey
of
molecular biology started in 1953 by the discov-
ery of DNA’s molecular structure by James
Watson and Francis Crick. However, astonishing
adoption and transformation in this sector were
for discovering the in-vitro DNA ampliﬁcation
process, known as the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). This method was discussed by Dr. Kary
Banks Mullis in 1983. This landmark discovery
and other potential discoveries like ﬁnding
restriction enzymes and other genome-modifying
tools enabled precise manipulation of the genes. It
has
also
contributed
to
understanding
the
functions
of
the
genes.
The
detection
of
pathogens using PCR has become the hallmark

of quality and speciﬁcity in the diagnostic labora-
tory. Speciﬁc conserved genes in pathogen
(e.g. 16S rRNA for bacteria, structural genes for
viruses and 18S rRNA for fungi) are targeted to
amplify and detect pathogens in the sample. Fur-
ther,
the
advent
of
highly
parallel
DNA
sequencers
and
high-throughput
mass
spectrometers with remarkable mass accuracy
and sensitivity is propelling microbiology into a
new era, extending its focus from the properties of
single
organism
types
in
isolation
to
the
operations of whole communities. These new
ﬁelds,
termed
metagenomics,
metatran-
scriptomics and metabolomics, look into the
microbial taxonomic proﬁle, functional proﬁle
and metabolic proﬁles, respectively.

The health and function of humans are driven
by their genes and the resident microorganisms
(human microbiome), which interact at the
molecular and cellular levels in response to envi-
ronmental
and
other
factors.
The
resident
microorganisms that outnumber human cells pro-
tect an individual from multiple risk factors,
including invading pathogens and other diseases.
As
such,
humans
are
considered
“supra-
organism”, a composite of microbial and human
cells wherein human genetic and metabolic
features are essentially a blend of human and
microbial traits.
From this understanding and with the advent
of tools enabling analysing large volume of
genes, the Human Genome Project was initiated
in 1990 by the US Department of Energy (DOE)
and the National Institutes of Health, USA. The
project was completed in 2013. It completely
sequenced approximately 22,300 protein-coding
genes that form 99% of the human genome’s
gene-containing regions with an accuracy of
99.99%. Among many outcomes, the project has
led to successful mapping, that is, number, loca-
tion, size and sequence, of human genes in the
entire genome. In addition, it has allowed for the
identiﬁcation
of
disease-causing
alleles
and

enabled the production of speciﬁc gene probes to
detect sufferers and carriers of genetic diseases.
Impact of Molecular Biology in Medical Microbiology

The Human Microbiome Project was an
experimental extension of the Human Genome
Project that aims to generate resources for a com-
prehensive
characterisation
of
the
human
microbiome to understand its impact on human
health and disease. Funded by the National Insti-
tute of Health, USA, the ﬁrst phase, known as the
Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (launched in
2007), studied the human inhabitant microbial
communities on nasal, oral, skin, gastrointestinal
and urogenital areas. As the second phase of the
project, the Integrative HMP (iHMP) (launched in
2014) gathered multiple -omic data from both the
microbiome and the human host to understand
host-microbiome
interactions
and
determine
their role in pathogenesis and host immunity.
Among many achievements, these projects have
enabled
capturing
the

of
the
human

and
identiﬁed healthy and diseased gut microbiota
and so on.

Classification, Nomenclature
and Taxonomy of Microbes
2
Classiﬁcation may be deﬁned as the arrangement
of organisms into taxonomic groups (taxa) on the
basis of their phenotypic (observable) and geno-
typic (genetic) similarities and differences. It
allows for proper and systematic grouping of
microorganisms. Organisms are classiﬁed into
three
main
kingdoms:
animals,
plants
and
Protista.
The
Protista
contain
unicellular
microorganisms
including
eukaryotes
and
prokaryotes.
Classification of Microorganisms
Carl Woese in 1990 put forward the three
domains and six kingdom classiﬁcations to
group all existing living organisms. This is
based primarily on variations in the 16S ribo-
somal RNA structure.
Domain
It is the ﬁrst and the highest group encompassing
all living beings. The three domains are as
follows:
1. Archaea: These are prokaryotes and members
of this group are the most ancient organisms.
Though similar to bacteria, these lack nuclear
membranes, the cell wall is devoid of peptido-
glycan and these can survive in extremes of
temperatures or salinity.

13
2. Bacteria: These are “eubacteria” or true bac-
teria, having lipid-containing cell membranes
and their cell wall contains peptidoglycan.
3. Eukarya: These have a eukaryote cell struc-
ture, with membrane-bound nuclei, and pepti-
doglycan is absent from the cell wall.
Kingdom
It is the next higher grouping of organisms and in
the older classiﬁcation, there were ﬁve kingdoms:
Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.
With the introduction of the domain system, the
Monera kingdom has been split into kingdoms
Archaebacteria and Eubacteria (Table 2.1). Medi-
cally important disease-causing organisms belong
to four kingdoms only, with archaebacteria and
plantae being non-pathogenic (except for some
poisonous substances produced by certain plants).
Medically Important Kingdoms
Kingdom Eubacteria: These are prokaryotic
unicellular organisms with a circular DNA
and characteristic rRNA. Peptidoglycan is
present in the cell wall. There are ﬁve main
groups
of
Eubacteria—Proteobacteria,
Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Chlamydiae and
Spirochetes—of which proteobacteria contain
the highest number of pathogens.
Kingdom Fungi: For a long time, fungi were
classiﬁed under the plant kingdom but later a
separate kingdom was assigned to these

organisms. The morphology of the fungal
structures had been used for a long time in
classiﬁcation. The recent application of geno-
mic studies and sequencing has led to the
description of nine phyla, in which members
of a few groups are human pathogens.
Kingdom Protista: Protozoan parasites are uni-
cellular organisms which have been classed
under the Kingdom of Protista. At present,
there are 11 phyla of protozoan parasites of
which the following phyla comprise medically
important protozoan parasites: Amoebozoa,
Trichozoa, Percolozoa, Euglenozoa, Miozoa
and Ciliophora.
Kingdom Animalia: In contrast to protozoa, the
animalia
kingdom
contains
multicellular
organisms, and the helminth parasites and
ectoparasites
of
medical
importance
are
members of this group. Trematodes, cestodes
and nematodes are the three major helminth
groups studied in medical parasitology, while
ectoparasites are largely insects.
In addition to the abovementioned organisms, a
distinctly
separate
group
of
disease-causing
agents are the viruses. By their nature, viruses
are considered non-living outside a living body,
but can replicate inside a live cell or host. The
nature of the nucleic acid content of viruses forms
the basis of their classiﬁcation into DNA and
RNA viruses. The two groups are further divided
into families based on the special features of the
nucleic acids, their mode of replication and basic
structural features.
Nomenclature and Taxonomy
of Microorganism
Nomenclature
refers
to
the
naming
of
microorganisms.
Taxonomy (alternatively “systematics”) is the
science of classifying organisms leading to their
nomenclature. Two kinds of names are usually
given to microorganisms—common name and
scientiﬁc name:
1. The common or casual name for a microor-
ganism varies from country to country and is
usually known in the local language. For
example, tubercle bacillus, typhoid bacillus
and gonococcus are common names for com-
munication at the local level.
2. The scientiﬁc name is the international name
that is accepted throughout the world. By
accepted taxonomic conventions, the order
names
end
in
ales
(e.g.
the
order
Eubacteriales), the family names end in aceae
(e.g. the family Enterobacteriaceae) and the
tribe names end in eae (e.g. the tribe Proteae).
The order, family and tribe names begin with
capital letters. The genus name also begins
with a capital letter, but the species name
(e.g. coli) begins with a running letter and
not
a
capital
letter.
Both
the
genus
(e.g. Escherichia) and species names are either
italicised or underlined when written in the
text. The scientiﬁc name of the bacterium
when written for the ﬁrst time is written in
full (e.g. Escherichia coli), but is later men-

When bacteria are referred to as a group,
their

The taxonomic processes and nomenclature of
bacteria and archaea are governed by the Interna-

Division
of
the
International
Union
of
Microbiological Societies. Nomenclature is done
as per the International Code of Nomenclature of
Prokaryotes (ICNP), formerly the International

Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB) or
Bacteriological Code (BC). Novel taxa are validly
published in the Society’s Journal, that is, the
International Journal of Systematic and Evolu-
tionary Microbiology (IJSEM; previously Inter-
national Journal of Systematic Bacteriology).
Publication of novel taxa in other scientiﬁc
journals is also accepted as valid nomenclature
subject to the assessment and inclusion in the
IJSEM journal as Approved List of Bacterial
Names.
Nomenclature and Taxonomy of Microorganism
15
The nomenclature of eukaryotic microbial
groups is provided for by other codes and
governed by the organisations mentioned below:
•
Fungi and algae by the International Code of
Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants. It is
published and managed by the International
Association of Plant Taxonomy (IATP),
•
Protozoa by the International Code of Zoolog-
ical Nomenclature. It is published and man-
aged by the International Commission on
Zoological Nomenclature.
•
Viruses by the International Code of Virus
Classiﬁcation and Nomenclature. It is manged
by the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses.
Bacterial Taxonomy
Although no universally accepted bacterial clas-
siﬁcation
system
is
available,
three
main
approaches are usually followed. These include
(1) phylogenetic, (2) adansonian and (3) molecu-
lar
and
genetic
classiﬁcations,
which
are
discussed in the subsequent sections.
1. Phylogenetic
Classiﬁcation:
Phylogenetic
classiﬁcation is a type of hierarchical classiﬁ-
cation that presents a branching tree-like
arrangement, with one characteristic being
employed for divisions at each branch or
level. It is called phylogenetic classiﬁcation
because it denotes an evolutionary arrange-
ment of the species.
This classiﬁcation groups together the types
that are related on an evolutionary basis
where
several
groups
are
used
such
as
Divisions, Classes, Orders, Families, Tribes,
Genera and Species. Some characters of spe-
cial
importance,
such
as
Gram
staining
properties, lactose fermentation, spore forma-
tion and so on, are used to differentiate
between the major groups. Less important
properties (nutritional requirements for growth
of bacteria, production of certain enzymes by
bacteria and so on) distinguish between the
minor groups such as the genera and the
species.
Bergey Manual of Systematic Bacteriology is
an authoritative published compilation that
describes a phylogenetic classiﬁcation of bac-
teria. The manual is a compilation of names
and descriptions of bacteria, and is extremely
useful for identifying newly isolated bacterial
types.
It
describes
their
essential
characteristics such as the morphology of the
bacteria,
staining
properties,
cultural
characteristics, biochemical reactions, anti-
genic structure, the guanine to cytosine ratio
of DNA and so on, which are used for
identifying and classifying bacteria. It is the
deﬁnitive reference book accepted worldwide.
2. Adansonian Classiﬁcation: The adansonian
classiﬁcation, the ﬁrst classiﬁcation, was pro-
posed by Michael Adanson in the eighteenth
century
and
considers
the
characteristics
expressed at the time of the study. Hence, it
is called a Phenetic system. This classiﬁcation
gives equal weight to all measurable features
and groups of bacteria based on similarities of
several characteristics.
The availability of computer facilities has
expanded the scope of phenetic classiﬁcation.
It allows for the comparison of a vast number
of properties of several organisms simulta-
neously. A computer analysis of a large num-
ber of characteristics of a bacterium facilitates
the identiﬁcation of several broad sub-groups
of bacterial strains that are further sub-divided
into
species
and
are
represented
in
a

dendrogram (Fig.
). This type of classiﬁca-
tion, based on a large number of properties, is
known as numerical taxonomy.

taxonomy based on the
dendrogram
2. Molecular and Genetic Classiﬁcation: The
molecular classiﬁcation is based on the homol-
ogy of the DNA base sequences of the
microorganisms.
First,
DNA
is
extracted
from the organism, and the DNA relatedness
of the microorganisms is tested, and the nucle-
otide sequence of the DNA is studied using
DNA hybridisation or recombination methods.
The degree of hybridisation can be assessed by
many methods, such as by using labelled DNA
preparations.
The genetic relatedness can also be assessed
by studying the messenger RNA (mRNA).
Also, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) analysis is of
immense value. Evolutionary relationships
among widely divergent organisms have been
shown by studying the nucleotide sequence of
16S ribosomal RNA from different biologic
sources. It has contributed to the understand-
ing of new groups of bacteria such as the
archaebacteria. In recent times, genetic classi-
ﬁcation is increasingly being used to study
viruses.
Intraspecies Classification
Intraspecies classiﬁcation makes an attempt to
sub-classify species of a bacteria based on
biochemical
properties
(bio-types),
antigenic
properties (serotypes), susceptibility to bacterio-
phage
(phage
types)
and
production
of
bacteriocins (colicin types). Recently, molecular
methods have increasingly been used for intraspe-
cies classiﬁcation of microorganisms, especially
viruses.
Molecular methods of intraspecies classiﬁca-
tion are of two types—phenotypic and genotypic.
•
Phenotypic methods are based primarily on
the study of expressed characteristics by
microorganisms
and
are
carried
out
by
performing electrophoretic typing of bacterial
proteins and immunoblotting.
•
Genotypic methods include direct analysis of
genes, and chromosomal and extrachromo-
somal DNA. These genotypic methods include
plasmid proﬁle analysis, restriction endonucle-
ase analysis of chromosomal DNA with
Southern
blotting,
PCR
and
nucleotide
sequence analysis.
Type Cultures
The original cultures of all the reference bacteria,
including new species, would be preserved in
international reference centres. These culture
collections are made available to researchers/
microbiologists for research and comparison.

The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC),
established in 1925, is now headquartered in
Manassas, Virginia, USA.

Nomenclature, Taxonomy
and Classification of Viruses
The initial classiﬁcation of viruses was based on
the sites of their isolation or the symptomatology
of the disease. Since the formation of the Interna-
tional Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) in 1966, a systematic classiﬁcation of
viral taxonomy and nomenclature was carried
out. The ICTV has been introducing a systematic
approach for the classiﬁcation and nomenclature
of the viruses. The ICTV has grouped viruses into
families based on (1) the type of nucleic acid they
possess, (2) their means of replication and
(3) their morphology (e.g. membrane envelope).
The sufﬁx virus is used for genus names,
viridae for family names and ales for order
names. In formal usage, the family and genus
names are used in the following manner: for
example,
family
Rhabdoviridae,
genus
Lyssavirus, human rabies virus. A viral species
is a group of viruses that share the same genetic
information and ecological niche. These viral
species are designated by descriptive common
names,
such
as
human
herpes
virus,
with
sub-species, if any, designated by a number
(e.g. HHV-1).
Depending on the type of nucleic acids that
viruses possess, they are classiﬁed into two
groups: deoxyriboviruses, which contain DNA
(DNA virus), and riboviruses, which contain
RNA (RNA virus). The DNA and RNA viruses
associated with human diseases are divided into
six and 13 families, respectively.
Taxonomy and Classification of Fungi
Taxonomy
The
members
of
the
fungal
kingdom
are
eukaryotes and although most of them are multi-
cellular, some like the yeast have a single-cell
structure. Table 2.2 shows the differentiating
features of fungi from bacteria, which is a pro-
karyotic organism. For a long time, fungi were
classiﬁed under the plant kingdom, but later a
separate
kingdom
was
assigned
to
these
organisms.
The basis of fungal classiﬁcation largely
remains the morphology of the yeast or the
mould, together with other features, particularly
the mode of reproduction and the type of spores
produced. Four phyla were initially described
based
on
these
features.
Subsequently,
the

taxonomy of fungi underwent a state of ﬂux, a
situation which is being resolved in recent years
by the application of genomic studies. Novel
relationships between various fungal groups have
been revealed by using the tools of molecular
biology and through the sequencing of 18S ribo-
somal RNA. As per the latest understanding, nine
phylum-level
groups
have
been
described:
Opisthosporidia, Chytridiomycota, Neocallimasti-
gomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Zoopagomycota,
Mucoromycota, Glomeromycota, Basidiomycota
and Ascomycota.

Classification of Fungal Diseases
Mycosis (Pleural: Mycoses) is the terminology
used for a fungal disease. Fungal infections can
be classiﬁed as follows:
1. Superﬁcial mycoses: These infections are
conﬁned to the outer layers of the skin, nail
or hair (keratinised layers), and rarely invade
the deeper tissue or viscera. Those infections,
which are limited to stratum corneum or the
outermost layer of the skin, are termed super-
ﬁcial mycoses, while infections which affect

Taxonomy and Classification of Fungi
19
only skin, hair and nails in human are termed
dermatophytoses.
2. Subcutaneous mycoses: Infections in this cat-
egory are conﬁned to the subcutaneous tissue
and only rarely spread systemically to affect
the underlying muscles and bones.
3. Systemic mycoses: These infections may
involve deep viscera and become widely
disseminated. These are frequently caused by
dimorphic fungi and affect the lungs.
4. Opportunistic mycoses: These are caused by
low-virulence fungi infecting primarily the
immunocompromised hosts.

The microbial world comprises diverse organisms
with a wide range of cellular and molecular
organisations. The disease-causing agents may
be classiﬁed into seven groups: bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, helminths, arthropods, viruses and
prions. Except for viruses and prions, all have a
deﬁnite cellular structure. However, only the bac-
teria have a prokaryotic cell structure, while
others (except viruses and prions) have a eukary-
otic cellular structure. Among medically impor-
tant
organisms,
unicellular
morphology
is
exhibited by bacteria, the protozoan parasites
and a few fungi.
The kingdom Protista has been divided into
three groups based on cellular organisation and
biochemistry
differences:
prokaryotes,
eukaryotes and the most recently described
archaebacteria.
Prokaryotes: Bacteria and blue-green algae
(Cyanobacteria) are prokaryotes. Bacteria are
unicellular free-living organisms having both
DNA
and
RNA.
They
are
capable
of
performing all essential life processes, for
example, growth, reproduction and metabo-
lism. They do not show any true branching
except actinomycetales, the higher bacteria.
Bacteria lack chlorophyll, unlike blue-green
algae, which contain chlorophyll.
Eukaryotes: Fungi, algae other than blue-green,
protozoa and slime moulds are eukaryotes.

Archaebacteria: These are more closely related
to eukaryotes than to prokaryotes. They, how-
ever, do not include any human pathogens.
Differences
between
prokaryotes
and
eukaryotes have been summarised in Table 3.1.
Size of Microorganisms
All microbes except the worms are microscopic
and very small in size. Their size is measured in
units of length called microns or nanometres. A
micron (micrometre, μm) is the unit of measure-
ment used in bacteriology.
1 micron (μm)
1/1000 millimetre (mm)
1 nanometre (nm)
1/1000 micron (μm)
1 Angstrom unit (A)
1/10 nanometre (nm)
Bacteria of medical importance measure 2–5 μm
(length)
0.2–1.5 μm (width)
Size of protozoal parasites: <50 μm. Some may
be twice this size
Size of a fungal spore: 2–50 μm in diameter
Microscopy
A microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to
produce a magniﬁed image of an object that is
invisible to the unaided eye. The naked eye

cannot visualise bacteria because the limit of res-
olution with the unaided eye is about 200 μm. So,
the
study
of
bacteria
requires
the
use
of
microscopes.

Types of Microscopy
The following types of microscopy are used for
the examination of microorganisms:
Optical or Light Microscope
The light microscope uses natural or artiﬁcial
transmitted light as the light source. The resolving
power of a microscope is the ability of the
microscope’s lens system to distinguish two
closely placed objects as distinct and separate
entities. Resolving power depends on the wave-
length of light used to illuminate the object and
the numerical aperture of the microscope. It is
about half of the wavelength of light being used.
For example, the smallest particle which can be
resolved by yellow light with a wavelength of
0.4 μm is about 0.2 μm. The microscope’s
resolving power can be optimised by properly
using a condenser that focuses light on the
object’s plane. Resolving power is enhanced fur-
ther by adjusting the medium through which light
passes between the object and the objective lens.
For example, the use of immersion oil, whose
refractive index is similar to that of glass,
improves resolving power. The numerical aper-
ture of the microscope is deﬁned as the light-
gathering power of the microscope.
Different types of light microscopy include
bright-ﬁeld microscopy, dark-ground microscopy
and phase-contrast microscopy.
1. Bright-ﬁeld microscopy: Bright-ﬁeld micros-
copy is the most common form of light micros-
copy that uses a compound light microscope.
A compound light microscope consists of a
compound lens system that contains several
objective lenses, for example, lenses of low
power (10), high power (40) and oil
immersion (100). It also contains a ﬁxed
ocular (eyepiece) lens of 10 or 5. The
ﬁnal magniﬁcation is the multiplication of the

power of the objective lens with that of the
eyepiece (Fig.
Bright-ﬁeld microscopy has many uses, like
examining either wet ﬁlms or “hanging drop”
preparations for demonstrating the motility of
ﬂagellated bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa)
and
protozoa
(e.g.
Trichomonas
vaginalis,
Giardia
intestinalis). The wet preparation is also help-
ful in demonstrating microorganisms in urine
or faeces and detecting fungi in the skin. In
addition, it is helpful for demonstration of the
structural details. It is also helpful in measur-
ing the approximate size of the bacteria, fungi
and protozoa in stained preparations.
3.1).
Fig. 3.2 Principle of dark-ground microscopy
2. Dark-ground
microscopy:
Dark-ground
microscopy uses reﬂected light instead of
transmitted light used in the ordinary light
microscope (Fig. 3.2). The dark-ﬁeld con-
denser with a central circular stop illuminates
the object with a cone of light which prevents
light from falling directly on the objective lens.
Instead, light rays falling on the object are
reﬂected or scattered onto the objective lens.
Due
to
this,
the
microorganisms
appear
brightly stained against a dark background.
Dark-ground
microscopy
is
useful
for
demonstrating
very
thin
bacteria
(e.g. spirochetes) not visible under ordinary
illumination. This is a frequently used method
for
rapid
demonstration
of
Treponema
pallidum in clinical specimens. It is also

helpful for demonstrating the motility of ﬂag-
ellated bacteria and protozoa.
3. Phase-contrast microscopy: Phase-contrast
microscopy uses a speciﬁc optical system that
converts differences in phase in an organism
into differences in light intensity, thereby pro-
ducing light and dark contrast in the image
(Fig. 3.3). The optical system includes a spe-
cial condenser and objective lens, which can
be ﬁtted to an ordinary light microscope to
convert it into a phase-contrast microscope.
Phase-contrast microscopy helps examine liv-
ing
microorganisms,
particularly
protozoa
(e.g. T. vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica),
and the internal structures of a living cell by
improving
the
contrast-differentiating
structures within the cell that differ in their
thickness and refractive index.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy needs a microscope
ﬁtted with an ultraviolet light source. Fluores-
cence microscopy is based on the principle that
specimens stained with ﬂuorescent dye when
exposed to ultraviolet light result in the emission
of a longer wavelength of light (i.e. visible light)
(Fig. 3.4). As a result, the bacteria stained with
ﬂuorescent dye appear as brightly glowing
objects against a dark background. Auramine O,
acridine orange and rhodamine are the ﬂuorescent
dyes used to visualise bacteria. The resolution of
a ﬂuorescence microscope is much more due to
the short wavelength of ultraviolet light.
Fig. 3.4 Principle of ﬂuorescence microscopy
In
diagnostic
microbiology,
ﬂuorescence
microscopy is used to directly demonstrate
antigens of a pathogen in clinical specimens
using
a
direct
ﬂuorescent
antibody
test
(e.g. direct detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
Corynebacterium diphtheriae). It is also used to
estimate antibodies in the serum using an indirect
ﬂuorescent antibody test (IFA) (e.g. IFA in lepto-
spirosis, syphilis, brucellosis).
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
(CLSM)
The ﬁrst CLSM was developed by Egger and
Petran in 1960, almost 10 years after it was
conceptualised in 1950s by Minsky. However,
the commercial instruments became available in
1987. CLSM helps generate high-resolution opti-
cal images with depth selectivity and allows for
protein
localisation
in
speciﬁc
cellular

compartments. Although it produces lower reso-
lution than an electron microscope, it has become
an essential tool in microscopy due to fewer
requirements for specimen preparation and its
ability to obtain 3D live imaging and access to
dynamic cellular and molecular processes. By
using ﬂuorescence imaging as the core compo-
nent, CLSM uses point-by-point examination of
samples using laser excitation. It helps obtain
images from the focal plane only and removes
the background noise resulting from sample
thickness. As such, it is not useful in deep tissue
imaging.

Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy, invented by Max Knoll and
Ernst Ruska in 1931, uses a beam of electrons
instead of light. Electromagnets focus the electron
beam, and the object to be examined is kept on the
beam’s path, thus scattering the electrons and
producing an image that is focused on a screen.
Since the resolving power is half of the wave-
length and the wavelength of electrons is approx-
imately 0.005 nm compared to the 5000 nm
wavelength
of
visible
light,
the
electron
microscope’s resolution is very high, theoretically
100,000
times
that
of
a
light
microscope.
However, in practice, the resolving power of the
electron microscope is about 0.1 nm.
There have been many developments in elec-
tron microscopy that include scanning electron
microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy and so
on. Scanning electron microscopy a technique
development that provides a three-dimensional
image of the object and high resolution. Trans-
mission electron microscopy is a technique
where a beam of electrons passes through the
specimen, giving higher resolution and ultrastruc-
tural details. Finally, immunoelectron micros-
copy is a method to enhance sensitivity and
speciﬁcity by reacting the specimen with a spe-
ciﬁc
antiviral
antibody
that
results
in
the
clumping of viral particles. In this method, an
antibody may also be conjugated with gold to
visualise and determine the location of speciﬁc
antigenic determinants in a specimen.
The electron microscope is widely used for
(1) rapid detection of viruses directly in clinical
specimens, which is especially useful in detecting
non-cultivable viruses, and (2) ultrastructural
study of various microorganisms.
Differences between an electron microscope
and a light microscope are summarised in
Table 3.2.

Sterilisation and Disinfection
4
Microbes
are
ubiquitous,
and
many
microorganisms are associated with undesirable
consequences, such as food spoilage and disease.
Therefore, killing microorganisms or inhibiting
their growth is essential to minimising their
destructive effects. The aim is to (1) destroy
pathogens and prevent their transmission, and
(2) reduce or eliminate microorganisms that can
contaminate water, food and other substances.
Definition of Frequently Used Terms
Sterilisation: The process by which an article,
surface
or
medium
is
freed
of
all
living
microorganisms either in the vegetative or in the
spore state is known as sterilisation. Any material
subjected to this process is said to be sterile.
However, these terms are used only in the abso-
lute sense, that is, an object is sterile or not sterile.
It cannot be slightly sterile or almost sterile.
Often, sterilisation is done by using a physical
agent like heat, but at times it is also done by
using chemicals. These are known as sterilants,
and they have the ability to kill the spores.
Disinfection refers to using a chemical that
destroys or removes all pathogenic organisms. It
destroys vegetative pathogens but not bacterial
endospores. When used in higher concentrations,
disinfectants can be toxic to human and other
animal tissue. Hence, they are typically used
only on inanimate objects. Disinfection also
ensures the removal of harmful products of
microorganisms such as toxins from the articles.
A few examples of disinfection are (1) application
of 5% bleach solution to clean the examination
table, (2) food utensils used by a diseased indi-
vidual
can
be
disinfected
by
boiling
and
(3) thermometers used for medical purposes can
be immersed in an isopropyl alcohol solution
between uses.

Sepsis is deﬁned as the microbial growth in the
body or microbial toxins in blood and other
tissues. Asepsis refers to any practice that
prevents the entry of infectious agents into sterile
tissues and thus prevents infection.
Antiseptics are chemical agents that can be
safely used directly on open body surfaces
(e.g. skin, mucous membranes), open wounds
and surgical cuts to eliminate or prevent the prop-
agation of the vegetative forms of pathogens.
Examples of a few antisepsis procedures are
(1) preparation of the skin with iodine compounds
prior to surgical incisions, (2) treating an open
root canal with cotton swabs dipped in hydrogen
peroxide, and (3) use of germicidal soap for
handwashing.
Bactericidal agents (germicides) are agents
used to kill bacteria. Bacteriostatic agents are
used to stop the multiplication of bacteria. How-
ever, they cannot kill the bacteria; bactericidal
agents may be used as bacteriostatic agents at
higher dilutions. Decontamination is a process
by which an article or area can be made free from
contaminants such as microbes, chemicals, radio-
active agents and other hazardous materials.

Cleaning before sterilisation or disinfection is
always advisable because cleaning reduces the
dirt and microbial load, thus making sterilisation
more effective.

Sterilisation and Disinfection
Sterilisation
Methods of sterilisation can be broadly classiﬁed
as physical and chemical methods of sterilisation.
Heat Sterilisation
Heat
is
the
most
dependable
method
of
sterilisation. It is usually the method of choice
for sterilisation unless contraindicated. Higher
temperatures that exceed the maximum are micro-
bicidal, whereas lower temperatures below the
minimum tend to have inhibitory or micro
biostatic effects. Two types of physical heat are
used in sterilisation—moist and dry heat.
Many factors inﬂuence the sterilisation by heat
method. These include (1) nature of heat used for
sterilisation—dry or moist, (2) temperature and
time of heating, (3) microbial load present on the
article or area, (4) ability of the organisms to
withstand heat, for example, spores of certain
species of bacteria are resistant to normal heating
and (5) type of material to be sterilised.
Mode of action In dry heat, protein denatur-
ation, oxidative damage and the toxic effect due
to accumulation of high-level electrolytes are the
reasons for cell death. On the other hand, moist
heat kills microbes by denaturation and coagula-
tion of their proteins. The dry heat technique
requires high temperature to kill bacteria or their
spores by oxidative damage, and such a high
temperature
is
not
recommended
for
the
sterilisation of some of the articles. Most bacterial
proteins are resistant in a moisture-free environ-
ment and do not undergo denaturation. Hence, the
ability of steam to release latent heat when it
condenses on a cooler surface is being exploited
to kill microbes. In the case of spores, condensed
steam on their surface raises the temperature
inside spores and increases their water content.
It results in the destruction of spores by hydroly-
sis and the breakdown of the protein.
Thermal death time is the minimum time
necessary to kill a suspension of organisms at a
ﬁxed temperature in a speciﬁed environment. The
time required for sterilisation is always inversely
proportional to the temperature of exposure and is
also related to the number of organisms present in
the suspension, their spore-forming ability and
strain-speciﬁc
characteristics.
Recommended
minimum sterilisation time should be calculated
only
after
an
article
reaches
its
optimum
sterilisation temperature. The thermal death time
is also dependent on the medium in which
microbes are suspended. Organic substances,
proteins, nucleic acids, starch, gelatine, sugar,
fat and oils slow down the sterilisation process
by
increasing
thermal
death
time,
whereas
disinfectants and extreme pH conditions acceler-
ate bacterial killing.
Moist Heat Sterilisation
Moist heat can be present in the form of hot water,
boiling water or vapourised water (steam). In
general, moist heat temperature ranges from
60 to 135 C. The steam temperature can be
regulated by adjusting the pressure in a closed
container. Moist heat kills microorganisms by
denaturation
and
coagulation
of
proteins.
Sterilisation by moist heat is of various types as
follows:
Sterilisation at a Temperature Below 100 C
Pasteurisation is an example of sterilisation at a
temperature <100 C. In this method, heat is
applied to liquids to destroy potential agents of
infection and spoilage without affecting the
liquid’s ﬂavour and food value. The technique is
named after Louis Pasteur, who devised this
method. This method is used extensively to
sterilise milk and other fresh beverages that are
easily
contaminated
during
collection
and
processing, such as fruit juices, beer and wine.
The ﬂash method and the holder method are
the two methods of pasteurisation. In the ﬂash
method, milk is exposed to heat at 72 C for

15–20 s. This is followed by a sudden cooling to
13 C or lower. In the holder method, milk is
exposed for 30 min to a temperature of 63 C,
followed by cooling to 13 C or lower, but not
less than 6 C. The ﬂash method is preferable for
the sterilisation of milk because it is unlikely to
alter the ﬂavour and nutrient content, and it is
highly efﬁcient in destroying certain resistant
pathogens like Coxiella and Mycobacterium.
Sterilisation
29
Although
pasteurisation
inactivates
most
viruses and destroys the vegetative stages of
97–99% of bacteria and fungi, it does not kill
endospores
or
thermoduric
species
(yeasts,
micrococci
and
non-pathogenic
lactobacilli).
Even after pasteurisation, milk is not sterile. It
contains about 20,000 or more microbes per
millilitre. That is why even a carton of milk that
has not been opened also spoils on prolonged
storage. Newer techniques in which milk is
processed with an ultrahigh temperature (UHT)
of 134 C for 1–2 s have now been used to
produce sterile milk with a storage life of
3 months.
Vaccine baths are a type of water bath instru-
ment that maintain a low temperature to sterilise
heat-labile vaccines. For example, during vaccine
production, the vaccine-containing medium is
gently heated at 45–55 C for hours in the vaccine
water bath.
Sterilisation at a Temperature of 100 C
Boiling
Exposing materials to boiling water for 30 min
kills most non-spore-forming pathogens, includ-
ing resistant species, such as the tubercle bacillus
and staphylococci. However, it does not kill bac-
terial spores. Sterilisation by boiling is facilitated
by adding 2% sodium bicarbonate to water. Since
boiling only once at 100 C does not kill all the
spores,
this
method
cannot
be
used
for
sterilisation but only for disinfection. Hence, it
is not recommended for sterilising instruments
used for surgical procedures. The most signiﬁcant
disadvantage of this method is that the items
sterilised
by
boiling
can
easily
be
re-contaminated when removed from the water
after boiling.
Free Steam at Atmospheric Pressure (100 C)
Usually, a Koch or Arnold steam steriliser is used
for heat-labile substances that degrade at higher
temperatures
and
pressure,
such
as
during
autoclaving. These substances are exposed to
steam at atmospheric pressure for 90 min, during
which the moist heat kills most vegetative forms
of the bacteria except for the thermophiles.
Sterilisation at a Temperature Above 100 C
This method is otherwise known as sterilisation
by steam under pressure. Under normal atmo-
spheric pressure at sea level, that is, 1-atm steam
can reach a maximum temperature of 100 C.
When pressurised in a closed chamber, the
steam temperature can be raised above this point
since when a gas is compressed, its temperature
rises directly in relation to pressure. So, when the
pressure increases by 5 psi above normal atmo-
spheric pressure, the steam temperature rises to
109 C. When the pressure is increased to 10 psi
above normal, its temperature will be 115 C and
at 15 psi (a total of 2 atm), the temperature
reaches up to 121 C. A combined effect of
increased pressure and raised temperature kills
the
microbes.
This
forms
the
principle
of
sterilisation by steam under pressure. A special
device is required that can subject pure steam to
pressures greater than 1 atm to achieve such
pressure-temperature
combinations.
In
health
and commercial industries, autoclaves are being
used for this purpose, which can be comparable
with the working principles of home appliance
“pressure cooker”.
An autoclave is a cylindrical metal chamber
with an airtight door at one end and racks to hold
materials. A screw clamp fastens the lid, and an
asbestos washer makes it airtight. A discharge tap
for air and steam is present at the upper side,
along with a pressure gauge and a safety valve.
Heating is carried out by electricity. The inner
chamber is loaded with materials for sterilisation.
Steam circulates within the jacket and is supplied
under pressure to the inner chamber. The water in
the autoclave boils when its vapour pressure
equals the surrounding atmosphere. Following
the pressure increase inside the closed vessel,
the temperature at which the water boils inside

the autoclave increases. The saturated steam,
which has higher penetrative power, on coming
in contact with a cooler surface of the article,
condenses into water and releases latent heat to
the article surface. For example, when approxi-
mately 1600 mL of steam at atmospheric pressure
at 100 C condenses into 1 mL of water at 100 C,
it liberates 518 cal of heat. The gross drop in the
steam volume pulls in more steam to that surface
area, and this process lasts until the temperature
of the surface elevates to that of the steam.
Sterilisation
is
achieved
when
the
steam
condenses against the objects in the chamber
and gradually raises their temperature. The
condensed water facilitates moist conditions that
ensure the killing of microbes.

Sterilisation and Disinfection
Sterilisation
condition: Many
studies
have
shown that the most appropriate temperature–
pressure combination for sterilisation by auto-
clave is 15 psi at 121 C. The pressure can also
be raised to increase temperature (increasing the
pressure to 30 psi will raise the temperature by
11
C), but increasing the temperature will
increase the exposure time. This may harm the
things which are being sterilised. Over-loading
should be avoided because it prevents steam
from circulating freely around the contents and
impedes the full contact that is necessary. The
holding time varies from 10 min for light loads
to 40 min for heavy or bulky ones. The average
time is 20 min.
Types of autoclaves: From the point of view of
industrial design and scope of action, autoclaves
belong to three categories:
•
Class N autoclaves do not have a vacuum
pump. As such, it does not ensure effective
steam penetration and allows only sterilisation
of instruments with a solid structure.
•
Class B autoclaves are the most advanced
steam
sterilisers.
With
a
fractionated
pre-vacuum that removes air from the chamber
and ensures effective steam penetration, it can
sterilise all types of materials. It is a commonly
used
autoclave
in
medical
settings
and
approved medical device.
•
Class S autoclaves are an intermediate class
between N and B. It has a vacuum pump that
removes the air from the chamber before
starting the sterilisation process. However, it
creates a single-stage pre-vacuum and so is
less effective than class B autoclaves.
In
most
clinical
laboratory
and
hospital
settings, class B autoclaves are either vertical or
horizontal
type.
Compared
to
horizontal
autoclaves, the vertical ones can work as a
passthrough mechanism and are useful in clean
room settings.
Uses of autoclaves: Autoclaves have many
applications. It is an excellent method to sterilise
heat-resistant materials, such as rubber (gloves),
glassware, cloth (surgical dressings), metallic
instruments, liquids, paper, some media and
some heat-resistant plastics. It is also helpful for
sterilising heat-sensitive items, such as plastic
Petri plates that need to be discarded. It is also
useful for sterilising materials that cannot with-
stand the higher temperature of the hot-air oven.
However,
the
autoclave
is
ineffective
in
sterilising substances that repel moisture (oils,
waxes or powders). Types and uses of various
moist heat sterilisation methods are summarised
in Table 4.1.
Sterilisation controls: Various sterilisation con-
trol indicators are used to determine sterilisation
efﬁcacy by moist heat. Thermocouples are used
to record temperatures directly in autoclaves by a
potentiometer. The Browne tube is the most
commonly used chemical indicator of moist heat
sterilisation in the autoclave. It contains a red
solution that turns green when exposed to a tem-
perature of 121 C for 15 min in an autoclave.
Biological
indicators
such
as
Geobacillus
stearothermophilus spores are used as indicators
of moist heat sterilisation in autoclaves. This is a
thermophilic
bacterium
with
an
optimum

temperature of 55–60 C, and its spores require
exposure at 121 C for 12 min to be destroyed.
The efﬁcacy of the autoclave is increased by
placing paper strips impregnated with 106 spores
in envelopes, and these envelopes are kept in
different parts of the load inside the autoclave.
These strips, after sterilisation, are inoculated into
a suitable recovery medium and incubated at
55 C for 5 days. Spores are destroyed if the
sterilising condition of the autoclave is proper.

Intermittent Sterilisation
Certain heat-labile substances (e.g. serum, sugar,
egg) that cannot withstand the high temperature
of the autoclave can be sterilised by the process of
intermittent sterilisation, known as tyndallisation.
Tyndallisation is carried out for 3 days and
requires a chamber to hold the materials and a
reservoir for boiling water. The items to be
sterilised are kept in the chamber and exposed to
free-ﬂowing steam at 100 C for 20 min for three
consecutive days. On the ﬁrst day, all the vegeta-
tive forms of the bacteria, yeasts and moulds are
killed but not spores. The surviving spores are
allowed to germinate to vegetative forms on the
second day and are killed on re-exposure to
steam. Finally, the third day re-ensures the killing
of all the spores by germination to vegetative
forms.
Intermittent sterilisation by inspissation is
used most often to sterilise heat-sensitive culture
media, such as those containing sera (e.g. Loefﬂer
serum slope) and egg (e.g. Lowenstein–Jensen
medium). This is carried out by heating them at
80–85 C in an inspissator on three successive
days (Fig. 4.1).

media, such as Lowenstein–Jensen media. (Courtesy of
Prof Tuhina Banerjee)
Dry Heat Sterilisation
Sterilisation by dry heat uses air with a low or no
moisture content, where the role of moisture in
sterilisation is minimal or nil. In general, the
temperature employed for dry heating ranges
from 160 C to more than 1000 C. The dry
heat kills microorganisms by protein denatur-
ation, oxidative damage and the toxic effect of
increased electrolytes. The use of dry heat is not
so versatile compared to moist heat; however, it
has numerous applications in routine sterilisation
procedures. Depending on the method used for

dry heat sterilisation, the temperature and time
employed also vary, but generally dry heat
would require more temperature and time than
moist heat.

Sterilisation and Disinfection
Flaming
Sterilisation of the inoculating loop or wire, the
tip of forceps, searing spatulas and so on is done
by holding them in the ﬂame of the Bunsen
burner till they become red hot. Glass slides,
scalpels and mouths of culture tubes are sterilised
by passing them through the Bunsen ﬂame with-
out allowing them to become red hot.
Incineration
Incineration safely destroys infective materials by
burning them to ashes. Incinerators are regularly
used in hospitals and research labs to destroy
hospital and laboratory wastes. The method is
used to destroy and dispose of infectious material,
such
as syringes,
needles,
culture
material,
dressings, bandages, bedding, animal carcasses
and pathology samples in a fast and effective
way. However, it is not used for metals and
heat-resistant glass materials.
Hot-air Oven
The hot-air oven is the most widely used method
and
provides
another
means
of
dry
heat
sterilisation. The hot-air oven is electrically
heated, which generates hot air. A fan in the
oven ensures even distribution of hot air in the
chamber. A thermostat ensures hot air circulation
at the chamber’s desired temperature. The heated
and circulated air transfers its heat to the materials
inside the chamber. While sterilising by the
hot-air oven, it should be ensured that the oven
is not overloaded. The materials should be dry
and arranged to allow free circulation of air inside
the chamber. It is essential to ﬁt the test tubes,
ﬂasks and so on with cotton plugs and wrap Petri
dishes and pipettes with paper. Sterilisation by
hot-air oven requires exposure to 160–180 C
for 2 h and 30 min, ensuring thorough heating
of the objects and destruction of spores.
The hot-air oven is used in laboratories and
clinics for heat-resistant items that are not
sterilised well by moist heat. They are used for
sterilisation of (1) glassware (syringes, Petri
dishes, ﬂasks, pipettes, test tubes etc.), (2) surgical
instruments (scalpels, scissors, forceps etc.),
(3) chemicals (liquid parafﬁn, sulphonamide
powders etc.) and (4) oils that are not penetrated
well by the steam used in moist heat sterilisation.
Sterilisation Controls
Various sterilisation controls are used. Colour
indicator methods such as Browne tubes are
routinely used for sterilisation control for dry
heat sterilisation. After complete sterilisation for
60 min at 160 C, the Browne tube turns green.
Biological
indicators
include
spores
of
non-toxigenic Clostridium tetani and Bacillus
subtilis to ensure complete sterilisation by dry
heat methods. A paper strip containing approxi-
mately 106 spores is placed inside an envelope
and subjected to sterilisation along with other
articles. After the complete sterilisation, paper
strips are inoculated into a thioglycollate medium
or a cooked meat medium and incubated anaero-
bically for 37 C. The medium is incubated for
5 days and observed for any turbidity suggestive
of
growth.
No
growth
indicates
efﬁcient
sterilisation. The various parameters of heat ster-
ilization is summarised in Table 4.2.
Cold Sterilisation
This includes methods of sterilisation by ﬁlters,
radiation
and
high-frequency
sound
(sonic)
waves carried out at a lower temperature.
Filtration
Filtration is a way to reduce the microbial popu-
lation in solutions of heat-labile material by using
various ﬁlters. Filters are used to sterilise these
heat-labile solutions. They remove contaminating
microorganisms
from
solutions
rather
than
directly destroying them.
Filters
Candle ﬁlters are made up of (1) diatomaceous
earth (e.g. Berkefeld ﬁlters), or (2) unglazed
porcelain (e.g. Chamberland ﬁlters). They are
available in different grades of porosity and

Asbestos ﬁlters are made up of asbestos, such as
magnesium silicate. Seitz and Sterimat ﬁlters
are examples of such ﬁlters. These are dispos-
able and single-use discs available in different
grades. They have a high adsorbing capacity
and tend to alkalinise the ﬁltered ﬂuid. How-
ever, their use is limited by the carcinogenic
potential of asbestos.
Sintered glass ﬁlters are made up of ﬁnely pow-
dered glass particles fused together. They have
low absorbing properties and are available in
different pore sizes. Although they can be
cleaned easily, these ﬁlters are brittle and
expensive.
Membrane ﬁlters are made up of (1) cellulose
acetate, (2) cellulose nitrate, (3) polycarbonate,
(4) polyvinylidene ﬂuoride, or (5) other syn-
thetic materials. These ﬁlters are circular
porous membranes and are usually 0.1 mm
thick. Membranes with pores about 0.2 μm
are used because the pore size is smaller than
the size of bacteria, even though a wide variety
of pore sizes (0.015–12 μm) are available
(Fig.
4.2),
Membrane
ﬁlters
remove
microorganisms by screening them out in the
way a sieve separates large sand particles from
small ones.
These ﬁlters have many uses. They are used to
sterilise pharmaceutical substances, ophthalmic
solutions, liquid culture media, oils, antibiotics
and other heat-sensitive solutions. They are used
to
obtain
bacteria-free
ﬁltrates
of
clinical
specimens for virus isolation. They are also used
to separate toxins and bacteriophages from
bacteria.

Radiations
Ionising and non-ionising radiations are the two
types
of
radiation
used
for
sterilisation
(Table 4.3).
Ionising Radiation
Ionising radiation is an excellent sterilising agent
with
very
high
penetrating
power.
These
radiations penetrate deep into objects and destroy
bacterial endospores and vegetative cells, both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic. These are, however,
not
that
effective
against
viruses.
Ionising
radiations include (1) X-rays, (2) gamma rays
and (3) cosmic rays. Gamma radiation from a
cobalt-60 source is used to sterilise antibiotics,
hormones, sutures, catheters, animal feeds, metal
foils and plastic disposables, such as syringes.
This has also been used to sterilise and “pasteur-
ise” meat and other food items.
Irradiation
usually
kills
Escherichia
coli
O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobac-
ter jejuni and other pathogens. Since there is no
detectable temperature increase in this method,
this method is commonly referred to as “cold
sterilisation”. The Food and Drug Administration
and
the
World
Health
Organization
have
approved food irradiation and declared it safe.
Gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source is
used to sterilise antibiotics, hormones, sutures,
catheters, animal feeds, metal foils and plastic
disposables, such as syringes.
Non-ionising Radiations
Non-ionising radiations include infrared and
ultraviolet radiations.
Infrared radiations are used for rapid and mass
sterilisation
of
disposable
syringes
and
catheters.
–
wavelength, is quite lethal and has signiﬁcant
bactericidal activity. It acts by denaturation of
bacterial protein and interferes with the repli-
cation of bacterial DNA. UV radiation is used
primarily for disinfection of closed areas in
microbiology laboratories, inoculation hoods,
laminar ﬂow and operating theatres. It kills
most vegetative bacteria but not spores. Also,
it does not penetrate glass, dirt ﬁlms, water and
other substances very effectively.
High-Frequency Sound (Sonic) Waves
High-frequency sound (sonic) waves beyond the
human ear’s sensitivity are known to disrupt
cells. Sonication transmits vibrations through a
water-ﬁlled chamber (sonicator) to induce pres-
sure changes and create intense points of turbu-
lence that can stress and burst cells in the vicinity.
Sonication also forcefully dislodges foreign mat-
ter from objects. The heat generated by the sonic
waves (up to 80 C) also contributes to the anti-
microbial action.
Gram-negative rods are most sensitive to ultra-
sonic vibrations, while Gram-positive cocci, fun-
gal spores and bacterial spores are resistant to
them. Ultrasonic devices are used in dental and
some medical ofﬁces to clear debris and saliva
from instruments before sterilisation and clean
dental
restorations.
However,
most
sonic
machines are not reliable for regular use in disin-
fection or sterilisation.

cacy of sterilisation techniques are summarised

Sterilisation by Chemical Agents
Several chemical agents are used as antiseptics
and disinfectants. All these chemical agents
(e.g. alcohols, aldehydes) are described later
under disinfection.
Effect of Cold and Desiccation
The main beneﬁt of cold treatment is to slow the
growth of cultures and microbes in food during
processing and storage. It is essential to know that
cold
merely
retards
the
activities
of
most
microbes. Although cold temperatures kill some
microbes, gradual cooling, long-term refrigera-
tion or deep freezing adversely affect most
microorganisms. Cultures of bacteria, viruses
and fungi can be preserved for a more extended
period in freezing temperatures ranging from 70
to 135 C. Even at this temperature, some of the
psychrophile grow and produce toxic products.
S. aureus, Clostridium species (spore formers),
Streptococcus species and several types of yeasts,
moulds and viruses are the pathogens that can
survive for several months in refrigerated food
items.
Lyophilisation is a process of freezing and
drying. This is one of the most widely used
techniques for preserving the microorganisms
and cells in a viable condition for years. Cultures
are frozen instantaneously and subjected to a vac-
uum that quickly removes the water. In this
method, there is no formation of ice that damages
the cells, and not all cells will withstand this
process; however, many of them survive after
reconstitution of lyophilised culture. Since the
effects of chilling, freezing and desiccation are
unpredictable and uncertain, they are not regarded
as methods of disinfection or sterilisation. Addi-
tionally, these procedures will not ensure that
pathogens have been killed efﬁciently.
Disinfection
The process of inactivating microorganisms by
direct exposure to chemical or physical agents is
known as disinfection. Disinfectants are products
or biocides that destroy or inhibit the growth of
microorganisms on inanimate objects or surfaces.
Disinfectants can be sporistatic but are not neces-
sarily sporicidal. Antiseptics are products that
destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganisms
in or on living tissue.
Antiseptics and disinfectants are used exten-
sively in hospitals for various purposes, such as
topical and hard surface applications. They play
an important role in infection control practices
and
are
helpful
in
combating
nosocomial
infections. Differences between sterilisation and
disinfection have been summarised in Table 4.5.
Properties of an Ideal Disinfectant
An ideal disinfectant or antiseptic has many
characteristics. (1) Ideally, the disinfectant must
have a broad range of antimicrobial activity. It
should be effective against a wide range of infec-
tious agents (Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, fungi, viruses and bac-
terial endospores) at higher dilutions. (2) It should
act in the presence of organic matter. (3) It should
not be toxic to humans or corrosive. This balance
between
effectiveness
and
low
toxicity
for
animals is hard to achieve in practice. Some
chemicals are used despite their low effectiveness
because they are relatively non-toxic. (4) It
should be stable upon storage and not undergo
any chemical change. (5) It should be odourless
or have a pleasant odour. (6) It should be soluble

in
water
and
lipids
for
penetration
into
microorganisms. (7) It should be effective in
acidic and alkaline media. (8) It should have
speedy action. (9) It should be relatively inexpen-
sive if possible.

Process that reduces the number of contaminating
microorganisms, liable to cause infection to a level
which is deemed no longer harmful to health.

Surgical instruments, needles, syringes, parenteral
ﬂuid, arthroscopes, media, reagents and equipment
in laboratory use.
Endotracheal tubes, aspirators, gastroscopes, bed
pans, urinals etc.
Action of Disinfectants
Disinfectants act in many ways. They damage the
cell wall and alter the permeability of the cell
membrane, resulting in exposure, damage or
loss of the cellular contents. They alter proteins
and form protein salts or cause coagulation of
proteins. They inhibit enzyme action and inhibit
nucleic acid synthesis or alter nucleic acid
molecules.
They
also
cause
oxidation
or
hydrolysis.
Factors Influencing Activity
of Disinfectants
Various physical and chemical factors inﬂuence
the efﬁciency of disinfectant. These include the
following:
1. Temperature:
Increase

temperature

ever, because disinfectants are chemicals, very
high temperatures degrade and weaken their
germicidal activity, which results in ineffec-
tive disinfection.
2. pH: pH inﬂuences the antimicrobial activity of
disinfectants. For disinfectants like glutaralde-
hyde and quaternary ammonium compounds,
it improves the activity but works opposite for
phenols, hypochlorites and iodine.
3. Relative humidity: It inﬂuences the activity of
gaseous disinfectants/sterilants, such as EtO,
chlorine dioxide and formaldehyde.
4. Water hardness: Divalent cations present in
hard water develop insoluble precipitates
when in contact with disinfectant. It reduces
the efﬁciency of the disinfectant.
5. Type of microorganism and duration of
exposure: Vegetative cells are more suscepti-
ble than spores. Spores may be resistant to the
action
of
disinfectants.
Bioﬁlm-forming
microbes are more resistant to disinfectants.
Effectiveness also depends on the duration of
exposure.
6. Physiological state of the cell: Young and
metabolically active cells are more sensitive
than old dormant cells. Non-growing cells
may not be affected.
7. Environment:
The
physical
or
chemical
properties of the medium or substance inﬂu-
ence the rate and efﬁciency of disinfectants.
For example, serum, blood, pus or faecal or
lubricant material can interfere with the anti-
microbial activity of disinfectants.
Types of Disinfectants
Disinfectants include the following:
Phenols
In 1867, Joseph Lister used phenolic compounds
to reduce the risk of infection during operations.
Phenolic compounds can be bactericidal, bacteri-
ostatic or fungicidal. They act by denaturing
proteins and disrupting cell membranes. They

are effective in the presence of organic material
and remain active on surfaces long after applica-
tion. Hence, they are the most widely used
antiseptics and disinfectants in laboratories and
hospitals
worldwide.
Different
phenolic
compounds are as follows:
Disinfection
37
Phenol: It is effective against vegetative forms of
bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cer-
tain fungi. It is an excellent disinfectant for
faeces, blood, pus, sputum and so on. It has a
low degree of activity as compared to other
derivatives. It is not suitable for application to
the skin or mucous membrane.
Cresols: These are more germicidal and less poi-
sonous than phenol but corrosive to living
tissues. They are used for cleaning ﬂoors (1%
solution), disinfection of surgical instruments
and disinfection of contaminated objects.
Lysol is a solution of cresols in soap.
Halogenated
diphenyl
compounds:
These
include hexachlorophene and chlorhexidine.
These are highly effective against both Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are
used as skin antiseptics and for the cleaning of
wound surfaces. Hexachlorophene has been
one of the most popular antiseptics because
once applied, it persists on the skin and
reduces the growth of skin bacteria for longer
periods. However, it can cause brain damage
and is now used in hospital nurseries only after
a staphylococcal outbreak.
Halogens
Halogens are ﬂuorine, bromine, chlorine and
iodine—a group of non-metallic elements that
commonly occur in minerals, seawater and salts.
Although they can occur either in the ionic
(halide) or non-ionic state, most halogens exert
their antimicrobial activity primarily in their
non-ionic state but not in the halide state
(e.g. chloride, iodide).
These agents are highly effective disinfectants
and antiseptics because they possess microbicidal
rather than microbiostatic effects. With longer
exposure, they act as a sporicidal agent also.
Hence, halogens are used as an active ingredient
in approximately one-third of all currently avail-
able antimicrobial chemicals. Chlorine and iodine
are the only two routinely used halogens because
ﬂuorine and bromine are dangerous to handle.
Chlorine
and
its
compounds: For
around
200 years, chlorine has been used for antisepsis
and disinfection. Liquid and gaseous chlorine and
hypochlorite are the major forms of chlorine used
to control microbes. These compounds react with
water and give hypochlorous acid (HOCl); this
oxidises the sulfhydryl (SH) group of cysteine
and interferes with the disulphide bond of various
enzymes. Thus, the enzymes are denatured per-
manently. Liquid and gaseous chlorine are used
almost exclusively for large-scale disinfection of
drinking water, sewage and wastewater from
sources such as agriculture and industry. Chlorine
kills bacterial cells and endospores, fungi and
viruses. Water treatment with chlorine destroys
many
pathogenic
vegetative
microorganisms
without unduly affecting their taste. Moreover,
chlorination at a concentration of 0.6–1.0 part of
chlorine per million parts of water makes water
potable and safe to use.
Hypochlorites are perhaps the most exten-
sively used of all chlorine compounds. They are
used for (1) sanitisation and disinfection of food
equipment in dairies, restaurants and canneries,
(2) treatment of swimming pools, spas, drinking
water and even fresh foods and (3) treatment of
wounds; and disinfection of equipment, beddings
and instruments. Common household bleach is a
weak solution (5%) of sodium hypochlorite used
as an all-around disinfectant, deodoriser and stain
remover. It is frequently used to treat water
supplies as an alternative to pure chlorine.
However, the signiﬁcant limitations of chlo-
rine compounds are that they are ineffective if
used at an alkaline pH and are less effective in
the presence of excess organic matter and rela-
tively unstable, especially if exposed to light.
Iodine and its compounds: Iodine is a pungent
black chemical that forms brown solutions when

dissolved in water or alcohol. Iodine rapidly
penetrates the cells of microorganisms, where it
disturbs a variety of metabolic functions. It
interferes with proteins’ hydrogen and disulphide
bonds (similar to chlorine). It kills all types of
microorganisms if optimum concentrations and
exposure times are used. Iodine activity, unlike
chlorine, is not as adversely affected by organic
matter
and
pH.
The
two
primary
iodine
preparations are free iodine in solution and
iodophors.
38
4
Sterilisation and Disinfection
Aqueous iodine consists of 2% free iodine in
solution and 2.4% sodium iodide. It is commonly
used as a topical antiseptic prior to surgical
procedures and seldom in treating burnt and
infected skin. A stronger iodine solution (5%
iodine and 10% potassium iodide) is used for
disinfecting plastic items, rubber instruments,
thermometers and cutting blades.
Iodine tincture comprises a 2% iodine solu-
tion and sodium iodide in 70% alcohol. This is
used as a skin antiseptic. Iodine is an extreme
irritant to the skin and is toxic when absorbed,
so at present, these tinctures (5–7%) are not
regarded safe routine antiseptics. Iodine tablets
can be used to disinfect water in emergency
conditions
or
to
destroy
pathogens
in
contaminated water supplies.
Iodophors are iodine complexes and neutral
polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol. This formu-
lation allows for an increased degree of penetra-
tion and slows the release of free iodine. Free
iodine solution, which was used in antisepsis, is
replaced by iodophores, which are less prone to
staining or irritating tissues. Betadine, povidone
and iodine are the common iodophor compounds
that contain 2–10% of available iodine.
They are used to prepare the skin and mucous
membranes for surgery and surgical hand scrubs.
They are also used to treat burns and disinfect
equipment. A recent study has shown that
betadine solution is an effective means of
preventing eye infections in newborns, and it
may replace antibiotics and silver nitrate as the
method of choice.
Alcohols
Alcohols are among the most widely used
disinfectants and antiseptics. They are bacteri-
cidal and fungicidal but not sporicidal. They
have no action against spores and viruses. Ethyl
alcohol and isopropyl alcohol are the two most
popular alcohol germicides. They are effective at
a concentration of 60–70% in water. They act by
denaturing bacterial proteins and possibly by
dissolving membrane lipids. They are used as
skin antiseptics. Isopropyl alcohol is used for the
disinfection
of
clinical
thermometers.
A
10–15 min soaking is sufﬁcient to disinfect
thermometers. Methyl alcohol is effective against
fungal spores.
Aldehydes
Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are the two
most
commonly
used
aldehydes
used
as
disinfectants. They are highly reactive molecules
that
combine
with
nucleic
and
alkylating
molecules. They are sporicidal and can also be
used as chemical sterilants.
Formaldehyde: It is usually dissolved in water or
alcohol before use. In an aqueous solution, it is
bactericidal, sporicidal and effective against
viruses. Formalin solution is 40% aldehyde in
an aqueous solution. It is used to (1) preserve
fresh tissue specimens, (2) destroy anthrax
spores in hair and wool, (3) prepare toxoids
from toxins, (4) sterilise bacterial vaccines,
and (5) kill bacterial cultures and suspensions.
Glutaraldehyde: A 2% buffered glutaraldehyde
solution can be used as an efﬁcient disinfec-
tant. It is less irritating than formaldehyde and
useful in disinfecting hospital and laboratory
equipment.
Generally,
glutaraldehyde
disinfects objects within 10 min but may
need longer (12 h) to destroy all spores. Glu-
taraldehyde is especially effective against
tubercle bacilli, fungi and viruses. It can be
used
for
cleaning
cystoscopes
and
bronchoscopes, corrugated rubber anaesthetic
tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal
tubes, metal instruments and polythene tubing.

Disinfection
39
Gases
Various gaseous agents are used to sterilise a
large volume of heat-sensitive disposable items
and instruments. Ethylene oxide, formaldehyde
gas and beta-propiolactone are frequently used
gaseous agents.
Ethylene oxide: It is a colourless liquid used for
gaseous sterilisation. It is active against all
kinds of bacteria, spores and viruses. It kills
all types of microorganisms by inhibiting
proteins and nucleic acids. It is both microbi-
cidal and sporicidal. It is a highly effective
sterilising agent because it rapidly penetrates
packing materials, including plastic wraps. It is
used to sterilise disposable plastic Petri dishes,
sutures,
syringes,
heart-lung
machines,
respirators and dental equipment. Ethylene
oxide is highly inﬂammable and carcinogenic.
Extensive aeration of the sterilised materials is
necessary to remove the residual ethylene
oxide gas, which is toxic.
Formaldehyde gas: It is used for (1) the fumiga-
tion of operation theatres, wards, sick rooms
and laboratories, and (2) the sterilisation of
instruments and heat-sensitive catheters, cloth-
ing and bedding, furniture, books and so
on. The formaldehyde gas is produced by
adding 150 g of potassium permanganate to
280 mL formalin in 1000 ft.3 of room volume.
The room to be sterilised is completely closed
and sealed at least for 48 h after fumigation
with formalin gas. Sterilisation is achieved by
condensation of gas on the exposed surface.
The gas is toxic when inhaled and is irritant to
the eye; hence its effect should be nulliﬁed by
exposure to ammonia. It is highly inﬂammable
and carcinogenic.
Beta-propiolactone (BPL): It is a condensation
product of ketone and formaldehyde. It is
active against all microorganisms and viruses.
It is more efﬁcient than formaldehyde for
fumigation purposes. It has been used to
sterilise vaccines and sera in liquid form.
BPL destroys microorganisms more rapidly
than ethylene oxide, but it has low penetration
capacity and may act carcinogenic. Hence,
BPL has not been used as widely as ethylene
oxide. Recently, vapour-phase hydrogen per-
oxide
has
been
used
to
decontaminate
biological wastes.
Hydrogen peroxide fogging: It can be used as a
replacement method for fumigation. In this
method, fogging machines are ﬁlled with
hydrogen peroxide as disinfectants and used
as per the requirements. Due to the short cycle
time and non-toxic nature, this method is
advantageous over conventional fumigation
techniques.
Surface Active Agents
Surface active agents, such as detergents, alter
energy relationships at interfaces producing a
reduction in surface tension. Detergents are
organic molecules that serve as wetting agents
and emulsiﬁers because they have polar hydro-
philic and non-polar hydrophobic ends. In addi-
tion, due to their amphipathic nature, detergents
solubilise and are very effective cleansing agents.
They are different from soaps, which are derived
from fats.
Cationic
surface-active
agents:
Cationic
detergents are effective disinfectants. Cationic
detergents like benzalkonium chloride and
cetylpyridinium chloride kill most bacteria
but not M. tuberculosis, endospores or viruses.
They do have the advantages of being stable
and non-toxic, but they are inactivated by hard
water and soap. These are often used as skin
antiseptics and disinfectants for the disinfec-
tion of food utensils and small instruments.
Quaternary ammonium compounds, such as
cetrimide, are the most popular cationic
detergents. They act by disrupting microbial
membranes
and
possibly
by
denaturing
proteins.
Anionic surface-active agents: These include
soaps prepared either from saturated or unsat-
urated fatty acids, which act better at acidic
pH. The soaps prepared from saturated fatty
acids
are
more
effective
against
Gram-
negative organisms, whereas those prepared
from unsaturated fatty acids are more active
against Gram-positive bacilli and Neisseria.

Non-ionic surface active agents: These are
40
4
Sterilisation and Disinfection
non-toxic, and some may even promote bacte-
ria growth.
Amphoteric or ampholytic compounds: These
are active against a wide range of Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also
against a few viruses. These are known as
“Tego” compounds.
Oxidising Agents
This group includes halogens, hydrogen perox-
ide, potassium permanganate and sodium perbo-
rate. They are good disinfectants and antiseptics
but are less effective in the presence of organic
matter. As a 3% solution, hydrogen peroxide is a
weak disinfectant. It is helpful for cleaning
wounds and mouthwash or gargle. Potassium
permanganate is bactericidal and active against
viruses also.
Dyes
The dyes that have been used extensively as skin
and wound antiseptics include acridine dyes and
aniline dyes.
Acridine dyes include acriﬂavine, euﬂavine,
proﬂavine and aminacrine. They show more
activity
against
Gram-positive
bacteria
than
against Gram-negative organisms. They interfere
with the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins in
bacterial cells. The yellow acridine dyes, acriﬂa-
vine and proﬂavine, are sometimes used for anti-
sepsis and wound treatment in medical and
veterinary clinics. Aniline dyes such as gentian
violet, crystal violet and malachite green are also
more active against Gram-positive bacteria than
against Gram-negative organisms. They are also
effective
against
various
fungi,
hence
are
incorporated into solutions and ointments to
treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm.
The
dyes,
nevertheless,
have
limited
applications because they stain and have a narrow
spectrum of antimicrobial activity. They also
have no activity against tubercle bacilli. The pres-
ence of organic matter also inhibits their actions.
Heavy Metals
Soluble salts of mercury, silver, copper, arsenic
and other heavy metals have antibacterial activity,
both bactericidal and bacteriostatic. They com-
bine with proteins, often with their sulfhydryl
groups, and inactivate them. They may also pre-
cipitate cell proteins. Silver compounds are
widely used as antiseptics. Silver sulphadiazine
is used for burns. Silver nitrate is used as a pro-
phylactic agent in ophthalmia neonatorum in
newborns. Copper sulphate is an effective algi-
cide in lakes and swimming pools. Mercuric chlo-
ride is used as a disinfectant. These compounds,
however, are increasingly replaced by other less
toxic and more effective germicides.
Acids and Alkalis
Acids (sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric
acid and benzoic acid) and alkalis (potassium
and sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydrox-
ide) are germicidal. They kill microorganisms by
hydrolysis and by altering the pH of the medium.
They are rarely used as disinfectants.
Organic acids preserve food by preventing
bacterial and fungal growth, and spore germina-
tion. They are widely used as they are safe to eat
too. Acetic acid in the form of vinegar inhibits
bacterial growth. Propionic acid is added to cakes
and bread to inhibit mould growth. The addition
of lactic acid into sauerkraut and olives prevents
the growth of anaerobic bacteria, especially
clostridia. Similarly, the addition of benzoic and
sorbic acids to beverages, syrups and margarine
inhibits the growth of yeasts.
Activities of commonly used disinfectants
against various microorganisms are summarised
in Table 4.6, and a list of commonly used
sterilisation techniques and their utility in some
of the important materials are listed in Tables 4.7
and 4.8.
Testing of Disinfectants
The efﬁciency of disinfectants can be determined
by the (1) phenol coefﬁcient (Rideal–Walker)
test, (2) Chick–Martin test, (3) capacity (Kelsey–
Sykes) test and (4) in-use (Kelsey–Maurer) test.
Phenol Coefficient (Rideal–Walker) Test
Rideal and Walker designed the phenol coefﬁ-
cient test to compare the performance of a disin-
fectant with that of phenol for the ability to kill

Salmonella Typhi. The phenol coefﬁcient is
determined by dividing the dilution of the disin-
fectant in question, which sterilises the suspen-
sion of S. Typhi in a given time by the dilution of
phenol which sterilises the suspension at the
same time.

For the test, a series of dilutions of phenol and
the experimental disinfectant is inoculated with

the test bacteria S. Typhi and S. aureus, then
placed in a 20 or 37
C water bath. These
inoculated
disinfectant
tubes
are
then
sub-cultured on a regular fresh medium at 5-min
intervals, and the sub-cultures are incubated for
two or more days. The highest dilutions that kill
the bacteria after a 10-min exposure, but not after
5 min, are used in calculating the phenol coefﬁ-
cient. Here, the reciprocal of the suitable test
disinfectant dilution is divided by that for phenol
to ﬁnd the coefﬁcient. For example, suppose that
the phenol dilution was 1/90 and the maximum
effective dilution for disinfectant X tested was
1/450, then the phenol coefﬁcient of X would
be 5.
42
4
Sterilisation and Disinfection
The higher the phenol coefﬁcient value, the
more effective is the disinfectant. Therefore, a
phenol coefﬁcient value of more than 1 indicates
that the disinfectant is more efﬁcient than phenol.
The test, however, does not show the action of the
disinfectant in natural conditions, that is, in the
presence of organic contaminants.
Chick–Martin Tests
It is a modiﬁcation of Rideal–Walker test, in
which the disinfectant acts in the presence of
organic contaminants (e.g. dried yeast, faeces) to
simulate natural conditions.
Capacity (Kelsey–Sykes) Test
The capacity (Kelsey–Sykes) test determines the
appropriate use of dilutions of the disinfectants. It
measures the capacity of a disinfectant to retain its
activity when repeatedly used microbiologically.
The assessment of a disinfectant is done by its
ability to kill bacteria by demonstrating growth or
no growth on recovery culture media but not by
comparison with phenol. The test is performed
under clean and dirty conditions, showing the
effectiveness of a disinfectant in the presence of
organic material.
In-Use (Kelsey–Maurer) Test
The “in-use” (Kelsey–Maurer) test determines
whether the chosen disinfectant is effective, in
actual use and in-hospital practice, and also for
the
period
of
its
use.
The
disinfectant’s
effectiveness is determined by its ability to inac-
tivate a known number of standard strains of
pathogenic staphylococcus on a given surface
within a given time. The in-use test more accu-
rately determines a disinfectant’s effectiveness
than the phenol coefﬁcient test.
Sterilisation and Disinfection
in Hospital Settings
Presently, in all infection-control programmes
designed for a health care setup, sterilisation and
disinfection play a pivotal role. It was initially
conceptualised and practised by Pasteur, Lister
and Koch. Acquisition of infection is said to be
often associated with the use of contaminated
materials or devices in a patient. The classiﬁca-
tion by Spaulding of the devices used on the
patient determines the type of method selected
for sterilisation or disinfection.
Spaulding Classification
Critical Items
The items or devices that enter the sterile tissue or
the vascular system and pose a high risk of infec-
tion if contaminated with microorganisms are
classiﬁed as critical items. This includes cardiac
catheters, implants, surgical instruments and so
on. Sterilisation of these articles is done either by
autoclaving if heat stable or by using ethylene
oxide or hydrogen peroxide gas plasma if heat
labile.
Semicritical Items
Semicritical items are those which come in con-
tact with the mucous membranes or non-intact
skin. Most of these items like endoscopes and
bronchoscopes require a high level of disinfection
between patients, which is done by glutaralde-
hyde,
a
high-level
disinfectant.
Semicritical
items used for neonates like a thermometer and
BP cuffs require only intermediate-level disinfec-
tion. As they cannot be treated with glutaralde-
hyde, alcohol treatment should be followed.

Newer Methods of Sterilisation of Heat-Sensitive Articles
43
Non-critical Items
Items like bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, bed rails,
bedside tables and so on, which do not interfere
with the mucous membrane but come in contact
only with the intact skin, are non-critical items. As
they carry no risk of transmitting microbes directly
to the patients, a low-level disinfectant is enough to
clean these items.
High-Level Disinfectant
High-level disinfectants are chemicals that can
kill all microorganisms except some spores.
Some activity against a smaller number of spores
can be observed if the contact time increases, such
as glutaraldehyde and hydrogen peroxide.
Intermediate-Level Disinfectant
These chemicals can kill all microbes, including
non-enveloped viruses, mycobacteria and so on,
except spores—for example, alcohol, phenolic
compounds and iodophors.
Low-Level Disinfectant
Chemicals that can kill only vegetative bacteria,
fungi and lipid-enveloped viruses are called
low-level disinfectants, for example, quaternary
ammonium compounds.
Newer Methods of Sterilisation
of Heat-Sensitive Articles
Hydrogen Peroxide
Low-temperature sterilisation using hydrogen
peroxide vapour is useful for sterilising metal
and non-metal objects which are heat or moisture
sensitive. However, it cannot be used for liquid
items or linen materials. The cycle time is about
1 h. It is non-toxic and hence safe for the environ-
ment, as well as for workers.
Accelerated hydrogen peroxide is another new
disinfectant for high-level disinfection where
hydrogen
peroxide
acts
together
with
low
concentrations of surfactants. It can be used for
heat-sensitive semicritical items, including ﬂexi-
ble
endoscopes.
It
has
sporicidal,
mycobactericidal and fungicidal activities, apart
from acting on bacteria and viruses.
Peracetic Acid
It is a more powerful oxidiser than hydrogen
peroxide and has sporicidal activity. It is fre-
quently used in combination with hydrogen per-
oxide to sterilise hemodialysers and for plasma
sterilisation.
Plasma Sterilisation
Plasma has unique properties. It consists of ions,
electrons and neutrals. For sterilisation, hydrogen
peroxide is passed through a chamber where gas
plasma is generated in a vacuum through radio-
frequency or microwave (Fig. 4.3). This electrical
ﬁeld causes the gas to ionise; that is, ions and
electrons are generated. It owes its sterilising
properties to these charged particles, many of
which are highly reactive free radicals. As the
process is carried out at a low temperature of
37–44 C, gas plasma can sterilise heat- and
moisture-sensitive
items.
It
is
used
for
arthroscopes,
urethroscopes,
plastic
devices,

and
so
on.
Liquids
or
instruments with dead-end lumens cannot be
sterilised by this method. This is a safe process,
and sterilised items can be used immediately
without aeration.

Sterilisation and Disinfection
Ozone Sterilisation
Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas and can be
generated
from
molecular
oxygen
(O2)
b
energising it. The extra oxygen atom is loosely
bound and is available to oxidise other molecules
and hence highly reactive and a powerful micro-
bicidal agent. The instrument is operated electri-
cally 30–35 C using oxygen and water, and any
residual ozone is converted back to molecular
oxygen and water vapour at the end of the pro-
cess. It is used for moisture- and heat-sensitive
items like metal and plastic instruments.

Microbial Genetics
5
Genetics is the study of heredity and variation to
understand
the
cause
of
resemblance
and
differences between parents and their progeny.
The term genetics was coined by William
Bateson, a British biologist, in 1906.
The unit of heredity is the gene, a segment of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries in its
nucleotide sequence information for a speciﬁc
biochemical or physiologic property. All heredi-
tary properties are encoded in DNA. Hence, chro-
mosomal DNA plays an essential role in the
maintenance of character from generation to gen-
eration. Genes carry the information to code for
all the necessary components and the actions of
life. The genes at each cell division are replicated,
and a copy is transmitted to each daughter cell.
Terminologies in Genetics
Codon: A codon is nothing but a sequence of
three
(triplet)
adjacent
DNA
or
RNA
nucleotides on mRNA that determines the
insertion of a speciﬁc amino acid or stop signal
during protein synthesis. The salient features
of the codon are as follows: (1) Codon is
degenerate means more than one codon may
exist for the same amino acid. For example,
the triplet codon AUU codes for isoleucine but
the other triplets AUC and AUA also code for
the same Isoleucine. (2) Codon is non-
overlapping means three nucleotides in one
particular codon do not participate in the other

adjacent codon. (3) Nonsense codons or ter-
mination codons or stop codons are the three
codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) that do not
code for any amino acid; instead, they termi-
nate the synthesis of a polypeptide.
Gene: A stretch of DNA that codes for the syn-
thesis of a particular polypeptide is called a
gene. It is the basic physical and functional
unit of heredity. Many genes may exist in a
DNA molecule. The bacterial chromosome is
made up of a single and circular DNA mole-
cule that is double-stranded.
Introns and exons: Introns are the intervening
or noncoding regions in DNA that do not code
for any protein, whereas the regions of DNA
coding for the proteins are called exons. The
introns and exons are copied during the tran-
scription process, but introns are removed
(spliced out) in the RNA molecule before
being translated into a protein.
Basic Principles of Molecular Biology
The central dogma of molecular biology refers to
the ﬂow of genetic information, which is stored
and carried by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) onto
ribonucleic acid (through a process called tran-
scription) and then ﬁnally to the synthesis of a
speciﬁc polypeptide (through a process called
translation).
Speciﬁc
polypeptides
such
as
proteins and enzymes determine the nature and
function of a cell. Hence, DNA primarily is an

essential component of heredity, the storehouse of
all information for protein synthesis in almost all
life forms. However, RNA remains the genetic
material in some viruses instead of DNA.

Microbial Genetics
DNA Structure
The DNA is the key fundamental component of
the gene, which carries the genetic information
transcribed onto ribonucleic acid and then trans-
lated as the particular polypeptide. The basic
structure of the DNA molecule was ﬁrst described
by Watson and Crick, for which they were
honoured with the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The
DNA molecule is composed of two strands of
complementary nucleotides wound together in
the form of a double helix (Fig. 5.1). The double
helix has a diameter of 2 nm. Each complete turn
of the double helix contains 10 nucleotide pairs
and is 3.4 nm in length.
Fig. 5.1 Watson-Cricks structure of DNA: a schematic diagram (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Difference_
DNA_RNA-EN.svg)
Each DNA strand has a backbone of deoxyri-
bose (sugar) and phosphate group residues
arranged alternately. To each sugar are attached
one of four nitrogenous bases, two purines (ade-
nine and guanine) and two pyrimidines (thymine
and cytosine).
The two complementary strands are held
together by hydrogen bonds between the nitroge-
nous bases on the opposite strands. The hydrogen
bonding follows a speciﬁc binding manner in
which hydrogen bonds are formed only between
guanine and cytosine and between adenine and
thymine. Guanine and cytosine form a comple-
mentary base pair, and adenine and thymine form
another base pair.

Bacterial Genetics
47
Therefore, a molecule of DNA contains as
many units of adenine as thymine and of guanine
as cytosine. The ratio of adenine and thymine to
guanine and cytosine is constant for each species
but varies widely from one bacterial species to
another. During replication, the DNA molecule
replicates, ﬁrst by unwinding at one end to form a
fork and then by separating strands at the other
end. Each strand then acts as a template for
synthesising a complementary strand with which
it then forms a double helix.
RNA Structure
The structure of RNA is similar to that of DNA
except for two signiﬁcant differences: (1) In
DNA, the sugar is d-2-deoxyribose; in RNA, the
sugar is d-ribose. (2) RNA contains the nitroge-
nous base uracil instead of the thymine present in
DNA. Based on structure and function, RNA can
be differentiated into three types: (1) Messenger
RNA (mRNA), (2) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and
(3) Transfer RNA (tRNA).
The most common function of RNA is the
communication of DNA gene sequences in the
form of mRNA to ribosomes. For mRNA synthe-
sis, DNA acts as a template; hence adenine, gua-
nine, cytosine and uracil in mRNA become
complementary to the thymine, cytosine, guanine
and
adenine,
respectively,
in
DNA.
The
ribosomes, which contain rRNA and proteins,
translate this message into the primary structure
of proteins via aminoacyl-tRNAs.
Bacterial Genetics
Extrachromosomal DNA Substances
Most bacteria, in addition to chromosomal DNA,
possess
extrachromosomal
genetic
elements.
Plasmids are such extrachromosomal substances.
These are not required for the normal life and
functioning of the host bacterium, but their pres-
ence in the bacterium confers new properties such
as drug resistance, toxigenicity and so on.
Plasmids
Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA substances.
They are replicons maintained as discrete, extra-
chromosomal genetic elements in bacteria. They
are usually much smaller than the bacterial chro-
mosome (varying from less than 5 to more than
several 100 kbp). However, plasmids as large as
two million base pairs can occur in some bacteria.
Plasmids are circular and double-stranded DNA
molecules that encode traits not essential for bac-
terial viability. They are capable of replicating
independently of the bacterial chromosomes.
The plasmids can also be present as integrated
with
bacterial
chromosomes,
and
plasmids
integrated with the host chromosome are known
as episomes. Plasmids are present in both Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Types of Plasmids
Plasmids, depending on their transmissibility and
nature of the factor, can be of the following types:
1. Plasmids, depending on transmissibility, are
of two types.
Transmissible plasmids: They can be trans-
ferred from cell to cell by genetic transfer
known as conjugation. They are large (mol.
wt. 40–100 million) plasmids. They contain
more than a dozen genes responsible for the
synthesis of the sex pilus and the synthesis of
enzymes required for their transfer. Usually,
one to three plasmid copies are present in
a cell.
Non-transmissible plasmids: These cannot
be transferred from cell to cell because they
do not contain the transfer genes. They are
small
(mol.
wt.
3–20
million),
usually
non-conjugative, and have high copy numbers
(typically 10–60 per chromosome). They
depend on their bacterial host to provide
some functions required for replication and
are distributed randomly between daughter
cells at the division.
2. Depending
on
the
nature
of
factors,
plasmids are of the following types:
F factor: The F plasmid, also called the F
factor, is a transfer factor that contains the

genetic information essential for controlling
the mating process of the bacteria during con-
jugation. The F plasmid of Escherichia coli is
the prototype for fertility plasmids in Gram-
negative bacteria. Strains of E. coli with an
extrachromosomal F plasmid are called F+
and function as donors, while strains lacking
F plasmid are F and behave as recipients.
The conjugative functions of the F plasmid
are determined by a cluster of at least 25 trans-
fer
(tra)
genes.
These
genes
determine
(1) expression of pili, (2) synthesis and transfer
of DNA during mating, (3) interference with
the ability of F+ bacteria to serve as recipients,
and (4) other functions.
48
5
Microbial Genetics
The F plasmid in E. coli can occur as an
extrachromosomal
genetic
element
or
be
integrated into the bacterial chromosome.
Both the F plasmid and the bacterial chromo-
some are circular DNA molecules. Hence,
reciprocal recombination produces a larger
DNA circle consisting of F-plasmid DNA
inserted linearly into the chromosome.
R factor: Resistance factors, also called R
factors,
are
extrachromosomal
plasmids.
They are circular with double-stranded DNA.
R factors occur in two sizes: large plasmids
(mol. wt. 60 million) and small plasmids (mol.
wt. 10 million). The large plasmids are
conjugative “R” factors, containing extra
DNA to code for the conjugation process.
The small plasmids contain only the “r”
genes and are not conjugative. The R factor
consists of two components: the resistance
transfer factor (RTF) and the resistant determi-
nant (r). The RTF is responsible for the conju-
gational transfer, while each “r” determinant
carries resistance for one of the several
antibiotics.
The R factors are responsible for the spread of
multiple-drug resistance among bacteria. They
carry the genes for various enzymes that can
destroy antibiotics and modify the membrane
transport system. The R factor may carry one
antibiotic resistance gene or may carry two or
more of these genes. The R factor carrying
more than two genes has many clinical
implications: First and foremost, a bacterium
carrying such genes will show resistance to
more than one type of antibiotic, such as peni-
cillin and aminoglycosides. The second impor-
tance is that the use of an antibiotic that selects
an organism for a bacterium resistant to one
antibiotic (such as penicillin) will select for a
bacterium resistant to other antibiotics (such as
tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, chlorampheni-
col, erythromycin). They may also carry genes
for resistance to metal ions. For example, the
genes code for enzymes that reduce mercuric
ions to elementary mercury, thereby making
the bacteria resistant to the action of mercuric
ions. They also carry resistance to certain
bacteriophages by coding for the enzymes,
for example, restriction endonucleases that
degrade
the
DNA
of
the
infecting
bacteriophages.
Colicinogenic (Col) factor: The Col factor is
a plasmid that resembles the F factor in pro-
moting conjugation, leading to self-transfer
and,
at
times,
transfer
of
segments
of
chromosomes. The Col factor encodes for the
production of colicins, which are antibiotics-
like substances speciﬁcally and selectively
lethal to other enteric bacteria. They also
encode for the production of diphthericin and
pyocyanin
produced
by
Corynebacterium
diphtheriae
and
Pseudomonas
pyocyanin,
respectively, which are substances similar to
colicins.
Transfer of plasmids during conjugation is
responsible for the spread of multiple drug resis-
tance among bacteria. The plasmid responsible
for drug resistance consists of two components,
namely, RTF and a resistance determinant
(r) for each of the several drugs. Transferable
drug resistance occurs widely among pathogenic
and commensal bacteria of humans and animals.
The plasmid is also responsible for the produc-
tion of colicins, the antibiotics-like substances
lethal to other Gram-negative bacteria. The plas-
mid that encodes for the production of colicins is
known as the Col factor and is transferred by
conjugation.

Bacterial Variations
Bacteria
show
phenotypic
and
genotypic
variations.
Phenotypic Variations
Phenotype (phaeno ¼ display) is the physical
appearance/expression of a particular bacteria. It
purely
depends
on
external
environmental
conditions, and it is a reversible phenomenon.
For example, Salmonella Typhi, a ﬂagellated bac-
terium, loses its ﬂagella when grown on phenol
agar but regains it when subcultured back on
nutrient broth. Similarly, the Lac operon model
of E. coli is also an example of phenotypic varia-
tion. E. coli possesses an enzyme called beta-
galactosidase, which ferments lactose; the gene
responsible
for
the
beta-galactosidase
gets
activated only in the presence of lactose. Hence,
the presence of lactose in the medium is crucial
for switching on the beta-galactosidase gene.
Some enzymes are produced upon induction
with the substrate and are called inducible
enzymes, whereas many other enzymes are sub-
strate independent and synthesised even in the
absence of substrate, and are called constitutive
enzymes.
Phenotypic variations are mainly dependent on
environmental factors, non-heritable, temporary,
reversible and limited in number compared to
genotypic variations.
Genotypic Variations
Genotype of a particular organism is established
by sum total of gene(genome), which are trans-
ferable
from parents to progeny. Genotype
includes complete genome with enormous num-
ber of genes, which may or may not be expressed
in a given environmental condition. Genotype
variations are either due to mutations or by
genetic transfer by one of the following methods
such as transformation, transduction, lysogenic
conversion and conjugation.
Mutations
A mutation is a random, undirected, heritable
variation seen in the cell’s DNA. It is caused by
a change in the base sequence of DNA due to the
addition, deletion or substitution of one or more
bases in the nucleotide sequence. It can involve
any of the genes present in the bacterial chromo-
some. The mutation results in the insertion of a
different amino acid into a protein, resulting in the
appearance of an altered phenotype.
Types of Mutations
Mutations are a natural event occurring in divid-
ing cells. The frequency of mutations ranges from
102 to 1010 per bacterium per division. These
occur spontaneously or are enhanced by different
mutagens. Mutations are of three types: (1) base
substitution,
(2)
frame-shift
mutation
and
(3) mutations due to transposons or insertion
sequences.
Mutation Due to Base Substitution: This type
of mutation occurs when one base in the nucleo-
tide sequence is inserted in the place of another.
This occurs during replication of DNA either
due to an error in the function of the DN
polymerase or due to a mutagen that alters the
hydrogen bonding of the base being used as a
template in such a manner that the wrong base is
inserted. The base substitution mutation may be
of two types: missense mutation and nonsense
mutation.
A missense mutation is one in which the base
substitution results in a codon that speciﬁes a
different amino acid to be inserted. A nonsense
mutation is another type of mutation in which the
base substitution produces a terminal codon that
stops protein synthesis prematurely. The entire
protein function is destroyed during the process
of nonsense mutation.
Mutation Due to Frame-Shift Mutation: It is
the second type of mutation. This occurs when
one or more base pairs are added or deleted in the
DNA. Therefore, this leads to shifting the reading
frame
of
the
ribosome,
resulting
in
the
incorporation of the wrong amino acids down-
stream from the mutation. Thus, the frame-shift
mutation results in the production of an inactive
protein.

50
5
Microbial Genetics
Mutation Due to Transposons or Insertion
Sequence: This is the third type of mutation
that
occurs
when
transposons
or
insertion
sequences are integrated into the DNA. These
newly inserted pieces of DNA cause profound
changes in the gene into which they are inserted
and also cause changes in the adjacent genes.
Causative Agents of Induced Mutation
Mutation can be caused by viruses, radiation or
chemicals.
Bacterial Viruses
Bacterial viruses (mutator bacteriophage) are an
example of viruses that cause a high frequency of
mutation by inserting their DNA into the bacterial
chromosome. Mutations can occur in various
genes
as
viral
DNA
can
insert
bacterial
chromosomes
at
many
different
sites.
The
mutations caused by these viruses may be either
frame-shift mutations or deletions.
Radiations
X-rays and ultraviolet radiations are examples of
radiation that can cause mutation in chromosomal
DNA. X-rays damage DNA in many ways. They
cause damage by producing free radicals that can
attack the bases or alter them in the strand,
thereby changing their hydrogen bonding. They
also damage DNA by breaking the covalent
bonds that hold the ribose phosphate together.
Ultraviolet radiation causes damage in DNA
by cross-linking the adjacent pyrimidine bases
to form dimers. For example, the cross-linking
of adjacent thymine to form thymine dimers
results in the inability of DNA to replicate
correctly.
Chemicals
Various
chemicals,
such
as
nitrous
acid,
alkylating agents and benzopyrene, and base
analogues, such as 5-bromouracil, cause mutation
in several ways:
Benzopyrene is commonly present in tobacco
smoke that binds to existing DNA bases and
causes frame-shift mutations. The benzopy-
rene, a carcinogen and a mutagen, intercalates
between the adjacent bases, thereby distorting
and offsetting the nucleotide sequence in
the DNA.
Nitrous acid and alkylating agents act by alter-
ing the existing base in the DNA. This results
in the formation of a hydrogen bond with the
wrong base. For example, adenine does not
form a bond with thymine but makes the
wrong pair with cytosine.
Base analogues such as 5-bromouracil have less
hydrogen bonding capacity than thymine, so
they bind to guanine with better frequency.
This results in a mutation due to a transition
from an AT base pair to a GC base pair.
Iododeoxyuridine, an antiviral drug, also acts
as a base-pair analogue.
Effects of Mutations
Mutations in the bacteria cause many changes in
their various properties. The mutation alters drug
susceptibility, antigenic structure and virulence of
mutant bacteria. It also alters the susceptibility of
bacteria to bacteriophages, alter their colony mor-
phology and pigment productions, and affect their
ability to produce capsules or ﬂagella. The devel-
opment of drug resistance due to mutations in
bacteria is a major health concern.
1. Conditional Lethal Mutation
Lethal mutations occur when some mutations
involve vital functions, resulting in the produc-
tion of nonviable mutants. On the other hand, a
conditional lethal mutation is a form of lethal
mutation, in which mutation is expressed only
under certain conditions, resulting in the pro-
duction of viable mutants. This is of medical
importance because it is used for preparing
vaccine strains. Temperature-sensitive strains
are the most common example of conditional
lethal mutations.
The temperature-sensitive organisms have the
unique property of replicating at a low permis-
sive temperature, such as 32 C, but cannot
grow at a higher restrictive temperature, such
as 37 C. This is due to a mutation that causes
changes in an amino acid in an essential pro-
tein, allowing these organisms to function at
32 C but not at 37 C. The temperature-

sensitive inﬂuenza virus strain used in the
experimental vaccine is an example of condi-
tional lethal mutations. This inﬂuenza vaccine
contains a virus that can grow at 32 C and
infect the nose, and can replicate and induce
immunity. However, the virus cannot grow at
37 C, hence cannot infect the lungs and does
not cause pneumonia.
Gene Transfer
51
2. Spontaneous Mutations
In mutations that occur spontaneously in
nature, their spontaneous mutation rate varies,
that is, large genes mutate more frequently. A
ﬁxed frequency of mutation takes place in each
gene. Approximately, 104 to 1010 mutations
per bacterium per division occur in each gene
in a single bacterium. Spontaneous mutation
occurs due to errors in DNA replication while
the progeny strand is copied. For example,
naturally, thymine forms a bond with adenine,
but in case of occurrence of spontaneous muta-
tion, instead of adenine, thymine binds with
guanine [T ¼ A (normal); T ¼ G (spontaneous
mutation)].
Bacterial mutations are of prime importance in
the ﬁeld of drug susceptibility testing and live
vaccine studies. This is because mutation may
alter any characteristic of a bacterium by
affecting any gene. The mutants can be distin-
guished by virulence, type of colony, morpho-
logical
features,
host
range,
biochemical
reactions, nutritional requirements, antigenic
structure and so on.

Gene Transfer
Gene or DNA transfer in bacterial cells is broadly
of two types: (1) transfer of DNA between bacte-
rial cells; and (2) transfer of DNA within bacterial
cells.
Transfer of DNA Between Bacterial Cells
Genetic information can be transferred from one
bacterium to another by transformation, transduc-
tion and conjugation (Fig. 5.2).
Transformation
It is a process of transferring genetic information
through the agency of free DNA from one bacte-
rium to another. This may occur either in nature

or in a laboratory. In nature, DNA is released
from a bacterium by lysis, which may be taken
up by the recipient bacterium that must be com-
petent. This natural process of transfer of genetic
material appears to play no role in disease. How-
ever, in laboratory conditions, DNA may be
extracted from one type of bacterium and
introduced into genetically different bacteria.
When puriﬁed DNA is injected into the nucleus
of a bacterial cell, the process is called transfec-
tion. Transfection is frequently used in genetic
engineering studies.

Microbial Genetics
Grifﬁth (1922), in his classical experiment on
mice, demonstrated that neither of the mice died
when
injected
separately
with
a
live,
non-capsulated Pneumococcus (nonvirulent) and
heat-killed,
capsulated
Pneumococcus
(nonvirulent). However, the mice died when
they were injected with a mixture of these strains.
He could isolate live, capsulated pneumococci
from the dead mice, which were virulent. He
demonstrated that some factor in heat-killed, cap-
sulated pneumococci had transferred the material
for capsule synthesis in the non-capsulated strains
of the bacteria, making them virulent (Fig. 5.3).
McLeod and McCarthy in 1944 demonstrated
that DNA extracted from encapsulated, smooth
pneumococci could transform non-encapsulated,
rough pneumococci into capsulated, smooth
organisms. They demonstrated the transforming
principle of DNA. The experimental use of trans-
formation revealed important information about
DNA and was the ﬁrst example of genetic
exchange in bacteria. Another bacterium where
transformation
is
observed
is
Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae.
Transduction
Transduction is the transfer of a portion of DNA
from one bacterium to another mediated by a
bacteriophage (Fig. 5.4). During replication of
the virus within the cell, a piece of bacterial
DNA is incorporated into the bacteriophage and
is carried into the recipient bacterium at the time
of infection. The phage DNA within the recipient
bacterial cell integrates into the cell DNA during a
process
called
lysogenic
conversion.
Transduction is of two types: generalised trans-
duction and specialised transduction.
1. Generalised Transduction
This occurs when a small fraction of the phage
virions produced during the lytic cycle are
atypical. It contains an arbitrary section of the
bacterial genome rather than phage DNA.
Every transducing phage handles a distinct
set of closely related genes that portray a
small section of the bacterial genome. Trans-
duction
carried
out
by
such
different
populations of phage is called generalised
transduction. Each section of the bacterial
genome certainly has the same chance of
being transferred from the donor bacteria to
the recipient bacteria.
Generalised transduction involves any seg-
ment of the donor DNA at random. This
occurs because the cell DNA is fragmented
after such infection, and pieces of the same
DNA, the same size as viral DNA, are
incorporated into the bacterial DNA. This
occurs at a frequency of about 1 in every
1000 viruses. Generalised transduction may
be complete or abortive:
Complete transduction is characterised by
the production of stable recombinants that
inherit donor genes and retain the ability to
express them.
Abortive transduction refers to the transient
expression of one or more donor genes without
the formation of recombinant progeny. The
donor DNA fragment does not replicate in
abortive transduction, and only one bacterium
contains the donor DNA fragment among the
progeny of the original transductant. The
donor gene products become progressively
diluted in all other progeny after each genera-
tion of bacterial growth until the donor pheno-
type can no longer be expressed.
On selective medium, abortive transductants
produce minute colonies that can be distin-
guished
easily
from
colonies
of
stable
transductants. Furthermore, the frequency of
abortive transduction is typically one to two
times more than generalised transduction. This
indicates
that

2. Specialised Transduction
Specialised
transduction
results
from
the
lysogenisation of the recipient bacterium by
specialised transducing phage and expression
of the donor genes. Specialised transducing
phages are formed only when lysogenic
donor bacteria enter the lytic cycle and release
phage progeny.
The specialised transducing phages are rare
recombinants that lack part of the normal

phage genome. They contain part of the bacte-
rial chromosome present adjacent to the site of
the pro-phage attachment. Many specialised
transducing phages are defective. They cannot
complete the lytic cycle of phage growth in
infected cells unless helper phages are present
to
provide
missing
phage
functions.
Specialised transduction differs from general-
ised transduction in many ways. The former is
mediated only by speciﬁc temperate phages,
and only a few speciﬁc donor genes can be
transferred to the recipient bacteria.

Transduction is not only conﬁned to the trans-
fer of chromosomal DNA but also that of

plasmids
and
episomes.
Transformation
involving the transfer of plasmids from one
bacterium
to
another
by
transduction
is
responsible
for
penicillin
resistance
in
staphylococci. Transduction appears to be the
most widespread mechanism of gene transfer
among bacteria. This method also provides an
excellent tool for the genetic mapping of bac-
teria. It can occur in many bacteria for which
bacteriophages are known. In addition, it may
occasionally occur in eukaryotic cells.
Gene Transfer
55
The process of lysogenic conversion confers a
new property to the bacterial cell; for example,
non-pathogenic bacteria can become patho-
genic
by
lysogenic
conversion.
Bacteriophages encode diphtheria toxin, botu-
linum toxin, cholera toxin and erythrogenic
toxin, and can be transferred from one bacte-
rium to another by transduction.
Conjugation
Bacterial conjugation is a process by which the
transfer of genetic material takes between the
donor bacterium and the recipient bacterium of
related species by direct cell-to-cell contact.
Plasmids
are
the
main
extrachromosomal
elements transmitted by conjugation (Fig. 5.5).
Fig. 5.5 A schematic diagram showing transmission of genetic material by conjugation
This
gene
transfer
mechanism
was
ﬁrst
described in E. coli K12 by Joshua Lederberg
and Edward Tatum in 1946. Bacterial conjugation
is also considered sexual reproduction or mating
in bacteria. During the conjugation process, the
donor or male bacterium possesses a special plas-
mid called F plasmid (F+) that codes for the
projected structure called ﬁmbria or sex pilus or
conjugation tube. The recipient or female bacte-
rium does not contain a similar plasmid (F);
hence there is no sex pilus structure. The ﬁmbria
of donor connects with the recipient bacterium,
and transfer of plasmid DNA and portions of host
DNA sometimes occurs. The transferred genetic
information is beneﬁcial to the recipient bacte-
rium and may include antibiotic resistance or the
ability to use new metabolites.
High-frequency recombination (Hfr): The
long length of DNA can be transferred by the
process of conjugation. The Hfr strain is a type
of F+ cell that has an F plasmid integrated into the
bacterial DNA. Hence they acquire the capability
of transferring the chromosome to another cell. A

whole
chromosome
can
be
transferred
if
integrated with the F plasmid. In this process,
the single strand of DNA that enters the recipient
F cell contains a part of the F factor at one end,
followed by the bacterial chromosome, and then
by the remainder of the F factor. The bacterial
genes adjacent to the leading piece of the F factor
are the most frequently transferred. The newly
acquired DNA recombines with the recipient
DNA and becomes an integral component of the
genetic material. The complete transfer of the
bacterial DNA is usually completed in approxi-
mately 100 min.
56
5
Microbial Genetics
In the conjugation process between the F+ and
F bacteria, conjugation (i.e. transfer rate) is high
in F plasmids, whereas transfer rate is very low in
chromosomal
genes,
which
is
speciﬁcally
mediated by the Hfr mutants in F+ bacteria. In
mating between the Hfr and F strains, the tra
region of a plasmid is transferred only at the end
of the conjugation process after the whole bacte-
rial chromosome has been transferred. In most
instances, recombinants produced due to the mat-
ing across the Hfr and F cells fail to acquire the
whole set of F plasmid genes and are character-
istically F, whereas in mating between the F+
and F strains, the F plasmid transfers quickly
resulting in F+ recombinants.
In Gram-positive bacteria also, conjugation
occurs by producing adhesions by the donor bac-
teria. These adhesions make them cluster with
recipient cells without the involvement of sex
pili. Some recipient bacteria, for example Strepto-
coccus spp., generate sex pheromones that facili-
tate conjugation. Table 5.1 shows a comparison of
transformation, transduction and conjugation.
Many plasmids transmitted through the pro-
cess
of conjugation
carry
genes
for
many
enzymes, toxins and resistance to one or more
antibiotics as follows:

wastes in the environment.
Transfer of DNA Within Bacterial Cells
Transfer of DNA within the bacterial cells can
occur by transposons, integrative conjugating
elements and programmed rearrangement.

Fig. 5.6 Structure of a transposon
Transposons
Transposons are a type of mobile DNA of
2000–20,000 bp. They can transfer DNA from
one site of the bacterial chromosome to another
site or a plasmid (Fig. 5.6). Barbara McClintock,
a geneticist working in maize genetics, gave the
idea of transposons or jumping genes.
The mode of genetic transfer by transposon is
called transposition. Transposition differs from
recombination in that a segment of DNA can be
transferred from one molecule to another with no
genetic homology with either the transposable
element or the donor DNA.
Transposons do not occur independently but
have the characteristic of jumping from one part
of a chromosome to another or a plasmid. They
can also jump from one plasmid to another or
back to the chromosome; hence, they are called
jumping genes. Transposition in prokaryotes
usually involves two steps—self-replication and
recombination. They jump from one part to
another by synthesising a copy of their DNA
and inserting it at another site in the bacterial
chromosome or the plasmid. Transposons, unlike
plasmids, are not self-replicating and depend on
chromosomal or plasmid DNA for replication.
The plasmid can contain several transposons
carrying drug-resistance genes, which code for
drug-resistance enzymes, toxins or metabolic
enzymes. These transposons can either cause
mutations in the gene into which they insert or
alter the expression of nearby genes.
Insertion sequences: The simplest form of
transposons are the insertion sequences. These
are a type of transposons that have a few bases
varying from 800 to 1500 bp. They are found as
multiple copies at the end of larger transposon
units. These cause mutations by moving from one
side to another in the DNA sequence and are
believed to control various cellular responses.
Integrative Conjugative Elements
Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are ways
of horizontal gene transfer and self-transmissible
mobile genetic elements. The elements exchange
by conjugation but need to integrate into the
chromosome to propagate. They cannot replicate
autonomously. ICEs integrate into and replicate
with the host cell chromosome, whereas plasmids
exist as extrachromosomal (usually circular)
autonomously replicating DNA molecules.
Programmed Rearrangements
The transfer of DNA within bacteria can also
occur by programmed rearrangement. In this
programmed rearrangement, the gene moves
from a silent site where it is not expressed to an
active site where transcription and translation
occur.
Many silent genes are present in the DNA that
encode variants of the antigens. Presentation of
the new gene into the active site occurs sequen-
tially and repeatedly, manifesting in antigenic
variations in the bacteria and parasites. This
mechanism is responsible for antigenic variations
seen
in
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae,
Borrelia
recurrentis and Trypanosome brucei.
Viral Genetics
Viruses, like other living beings, obey the law of
genetics. The viruses show variation in their
genomic structure by two principal methods—
mutations and recombination.

Microbial Genetics
Mutation
A mutation is the most important mechanism of
genetic modiﬁcation in viruses. Mutations occur
spontaneously and readily in viral genomes caus-
ing frequent changes in the nucleic acids. This
results in new viral strains showing properties
different from parental or wild-type viruses.
Mutations occur during every viral infection, the
frequency of mutations being about 10+5. New
variants of strains are identiﬁed by their nucleo-
tide
sequence,
antigenic
differences
or
by
differences
in
their
structural
or
functional
properties. Mutations in the essential genes of
the virus cause the inactivation of the virus. This
is known as lethal mutation. However, mutations
in the other genes alter the antigenicity and path-
ogenicity of the virus and induce drug resistance
in viruses. Mutations in viruses may be induced
by mutagens, such as irradiation or chemical
agents,
such
as
5-ﬂuorouracil,
or
even
spontaneously.
Lethal Mutations
Mutations in essential genes are known as lethal
mutations. Mutations in viruses lead to the for-
mation of various mutants, which show new
functional or structural proteins. This leads to
the formation of new viral mutants, which are
difﬁcult to isolate because the virus cannot rep-
licate. Selective removal or loss of a portion of
the viral genome and the subsequent loss of
function that it encodes lead to the formation of
the
deletion
mutant.
Other
mutations
may
produce:
•
Attenuated
mutants—variant
strains
that
cause less severe infections in humans and
animals.
•
Host range mutants—variant strains showing
differences in the tissue type and species of
target cells affected by viruses.
•
Plaque mutants—variant strains showing
differences in their size or appearance in
infected host cells.
•
Conditional
mutants—for
example,
temperature-sensitive
or
cold-sensitive
mutants.
Temperature-sensitive mutants can grow only
at a low temperature (28–37 C). This is due to a
mutation in the gene for an essential protein that
allows viral replication only at low temperatures.
These temperature-sensitive mutants are used
extensively to study viral genetics and evaluated
for possible use in live viral vaccines.
Recombination
Genetic recombination may occur when two dif-
ferent but related viruses infect a cell simulta-
neously. This leads to extra-molecular genetic
exchange between the two viruses, leading to
the production of a progeny virion that possesses
genes from both the viruses. Genetic recombina-
tion may occur between (1) two active infectious
viruses, (2) one active and another inactive virus
and (3) two inactive viruses.
Intramolecular Recombination
Intramolecular recombination occurs between
two closely related DNA viruses. For example,
infection of the host cell by two closely related
herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex virus types
1 and 2, produces recombinant, new hybrid
strains. These new hybrid strains possess genes
from both viruses: types 1 and 2. This process has
also been observed in closely related RNA
viruses. For example, the recombination of
Sindbis and eastern equine encephalitis virus has
led to the formation of western equine encephali-
tis
virus,
another
togavirus.
Intramolecular
recombination
may
be
re-assortment
or
re-activation.
Re-assortment
It is another process of genetic recombination. It
occurs between viruses with segmented genomes,
such as inﬂuenza virus A and B (8 segments),
Reoviridae
(10–12
segments),
Bunyaviridae
(3 segments) and Arenaviridae and Birnaviridae
(2 segments). An exchange of segments occurs
between these viruses, resulting in new hybrid
strains. Synthesis of new strains of inﬂuenza A
by co-infection with a virus from a different

species is an example of genetic recombination
by re-assortment that occurs in nature.
Viral Genetics
59
Re-activation
It is of two types: (1) cross-reactivation or marker
rescue and (2) multiplicity re-activation.
Cross-reactivation
(marker
rescue):
This
occurs between an active virus and a related
inactive
virus,
resulting
in
a
progeny
possessing one or more genetic traits of the
inactivated virus. For example, in inﬂuenza
virus, when a new epidemic strain (e.g. strain
A1) that does not often grow well in eggs as
compared to the established strain is grown in
eggs along with a standard strain (e.g. strain
A2) inactivated by UV irradiation, it results in
the production of a new hybrid strain. The
hybrid strain may have antigenic properties
of strain A2 but genetic characteristics of A1.
Such viruses have been evaluated widely in
the production of inﬂuenza vaccines. Marker
rescue is also used to map the genome of the
herpes simplex virus.
Multiplicity re-activation: This is a phenome-
non in which a live virus may be produced
when a cell is infected with two or more
(high multiplicity) virus particles of the same
virus, each of which has suffered lethal muta-
tion in a different gene due to UV irradiation.
Thus, it may be possible to obtain a full com-
plement of undamaged genes from the total
genetic pool, resulting in the production of
infectious virion progeny. Therefore, there is
a potential danger of multiplicity re-activation
occurring following the administration of
UV-irradiated vaccine. So, UV irradiation is
not safe to produce inactivated virus vaccines.
Non-genetic Interaction Between Viral
Gene Products
Non-genetic
interaction
between
viral
gene
products takes place in the following four ways:
(1) complementation, (2) phenotypic mixing,
(3) genotype mixing and (4) interference.
Complementation
Complementation is a functional
interaction
between the gene products of two viruses when
two viruses (one or both of which may be infec-
tive) infect a cell simultaneously. In this process,
their
gene
products,
such
as
proteins
and
enzymes, complement the action of each other
to have an increased yield of one or both viruses.
This occurs even between unrelated viruses. In
this process, a defective virus strain can be res-
cued by the replication of another mutant or by a
wild-type strain. For example, adenovirus is
defective in simian cells, but it can be rescued
by SV40. The SV40 virus can grow in monkey
cells and produce a gene product that adenovirus
needs,
thereby
complementing
adenovirus
replication.
Phenotypic Mixing
In this process, virus products from cells infected
with different virus strains may be phenotypically
mixed and have the properties of one strain but
the genome of another. This is not a stable varia-
tion; on subsequent passage, the capsid will be
found to be of the original type only. In pheno-
typic mixing, when the nucleic acid of one virus
is surrounded by the entire capsid of the other
virus, it is called transcapsidation. Pseudo types
are
produced
when
transcapsidation
occurs
between different types of viruses, but this is rare.
Genotypic Mixing
All the viruses of vertebrates are haploid except
retroviruses, which are diploid, but sometimes
several nucleocapsids may be enclosed within a
single envelope. This phenomenon of genotypic
mixing is known as polyploidy. No recombina-
tion between the virus’s genomes occurs, and it is
not a stable change.
Interference
Interference denotes inhibition of the growth of
one virus in a host cell when it is simultaneously
infected with another virus. Interferon is the most
important mediator of interference. Auto interfer-
ence is another type of interference in which a
high
multiplicity
of
infection
inhibits
the

production of infectious progeny. In contrast,
mixed infections sometimes increase the yield of
one virus and produce well-marked cytopathic
effects in the cell lines. This phenomenon is
called enhancement.

Transcription
The process of making an mRNA from a speciﬁc
gene
sequence
is
known
as
transcription.
Although
the
process
is
fundamental
in
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and is performed by
enzymes called RNA polymerases as the ﬁrst step
towards
gene
expression,
there
are
some
differences (Table 5.2). Prokaryotic RNA poly-
merase is a ﬁve-subunit (α, α, β, β0 and σ) holo-
enzyme. Four of these subunits, that is, α, α, β and
β0, compose the polymerase core and the σ is
involved only in transcription initiation.
The two promoter consensus sequences, or
regions, namely the 10 region, is TATAAT.
The 35 sequence, TTGACA, exists in bacteria.
During the transcription, the σ subunit of RNA
polymerase recognises and binds the 35 region.
After this recognition, the core polymerase binds
to the entire promoter region, where 10 regions
facilitate the unwinding of DNA to initiate RNA
synthesis.
For
decades,
bacterial
transcription
has
remained
an
excellent
target
for
novel
antibacterial development. Actinomycin D and
rifampin are the commonly used antibiotics that
prevent transcription. The rifamycins bind to bac-
terial RNA polymerase and prevent the extension
of
RNA
chains
beyond
a
length
of
2–3
nucleotides. It is the ﬁrst-line antituberculosis
agent and is among the only antituberculosis
agents able to clear the infection and prevent
relapse. Some of the reasons that transcription
inhibition is the preferred centre for antibacterial
discovery are (1) transcription is an essential pro-
cess for cell viability, (2) bacterial RNA polymer-
ase and other transcription factors are highly
conserved. This enables speciﬁc action on pro-
karyotic without harming the eukaryotic tran-
scription, thus resulting in
lesser cytotoxicity
and (3) numerous high-resolution structures of
RNA polymerase and transcription complexes
enable structure-based drug design.
Translation
In a prokaryotic organism, transcription and
translation occur simultaneously in the cyto-
plasm. Because the chromosome size is small
compared to the eukaryotic genome, all func-
tional genes (the cluster is called an operon) for
an activity are transcribed from polycistronic
mRNA and translated together.
Like the eukaryotes, bacterial translation is
divided into initiation, elongation and termina-
tion, where 70S ribosomes carry out the elonga-
tion process. The translation is initiated by the
binding of the 30S subunit of the ribosome at a
purine-rich region (the Shine-Dalgarno sequence)
upstream of the AUG initiation codon of mRNA.
The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is complementary
to a pyrimidine-rich region on the 16S rRNA of
the 30S subunit and plays a crucial role in pro-
karyotic translation. Elongation is a stepwise
process where the ribosome slides along the
mRNA and stitches the amino acids after it enters
the ribosome through the A site, peptide bond
formation in the P site and release through the E

site. Termination is achieved by release factors
(RF) proteins where RF1 recognises the UAA and
UAG stop codons, and RF2 recognises UGA stop
codons. These factors hydrolyse the ester bond in
peptidyl-tRNA and release the newly synthesised
protein from the ribosome.
Fungal Genetics
61
Several antibiotics work by preventing speciﬁc
steps in translation. Some of the antibiotics and
their targeted actions are:
1. Tetracyclines like doxycycline prevent the
binding of aminoacyl-tRNA by blocking the
A (aminoacyl) site of the 30S ribosome.
2. Aminoglycoside antibiotics like streptomycin
prevent the formation of the 30S initiation
complex.
In
contrast,
kanamycin
and
tobramycin bind to the 30S ribosome but
block the formation of the larger 70S initiation
complex. Hygromycin B speciﬁcally binds to
the 30S subunit in a region that contains the A,
P and E sites of tRNA.
3. Erythromycin, a macrolide, binds to the 23S
rRNA component of the 50S ribosome and
interferes with the assembly of 50S subunits.
4. Lincomycin and clindamycin inhibit peptidyl
transferase activity and prevent elongation.
5. Puromycin acts as an analogue of the 3-
0-terminal ends of aminoacyl-tRNA. It disrupts
synthesis
and
leads
to
premature
chain
termination.
Operons and Regulation of Gene
Expression in Prokaryotes
In the bacterial genome, operons are a cluster of
genes (components of the same biochemical
functions) that are transcribed together to give a
single
messenger
RNA
(mRNA)
molecule
(i.e. polycistronic mRNA). It allows for the coor-
dinated regulation, transcription and translation of
functionally related genes by encoding multiple
proteins.
Because the genes in an operon are function-
ally related, their expression during transcription
is regulated together to determine the fate of a
particular biochemical function. This process of
expression of gene regulation to switch on or off
biological functions is carried out by a set of two
major proteins, that is, repressors and activators.
In general, an operon is said to be functional
when the genes are transcribed, and proteins are
produced in the presence of activators. Likewise,
repressors bind to the genes in an operon that
prevents their transcription and translation and
switches off the biological function.
The most widely studied operon in the bacte-
rial system is the Lac operon. The genes in the
operon are responsible for the transport and
metabolism of lactose by a bacterium. In a 50 to
30 direction, the operon consists of a CAP-binding
site,
promoter,
operator
and
three
enzyme-
producing genes, namely, Z, Y and A. The Z
gene
codes
for
beta-galactosidase,
which
catalyses the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose
and galactose. The Y gene codes for permease,
which regulates the cell’s lactose permeability,
and the A gene codes for transacetylase, which
assists the enzyme beta-galactosidase.
The CAP is the activator protein that binds to
the CAP site to turn the operon on, and the Lac
repressor binds to the operator site to turn off the
operon. The operon is functional when the genes
coding for the enzymes are expressed only when
lactose is present and glucose is absent. In the
excess presence of glucose, the repressor prevents
the transcription of Z, Y and A genes that turn off
the
operon.
A
catabolite
activator
protein
activates the transcription of the operon only
when glucose levels are low.
Fungal Genetics
Fungal genome contains more noncoding DNA
(repetitive elements and introns) than coding
DNA (genes). The noncoding DNA, such as
introns, telomeres etc., provides the genome plas-
ticity to fungi during environmental/stress adap-
tation. The fungal genome architecture contains
Gene cluster region (gene coding for toxins/sec-
ondary metabolites), Gene sparse region (repeat
rich region), isochore-like region, subtelomeric
region
and
conditionally
dispensable
chromosomes.
Fungi show a large diversity in genome size,
which ranges from 2 Mb (Microsporidia) to 2 Gb

(Pucciniales), suggesting multiple genome reduc-
tion/expansion events in fungi during host/envi-
ronmental adaptation. Some obligate parasitic
fungi and yeast have small genome sizes, such
as
Microsporidia
(2–6
Mb),
Pneumocystis
(8 Mb), Candida (12–16 Mb) and Cryptococcus
(20 Mb). These fungi lost most of the noncoding
DNA to acquire a smaller genome and cell size.
By contrast, most ﬁlamentous fungi have large
genome sizes by the expansion of noncoding
DNA, such as Aspergillus oryzae (37 Mb), Neu-
rospora crassa (41 Mb), Schizophyllum com-
mune (38.5 Mb) and Rhizopus (40–50 Mb).

Microbial Genetics
Genome Evolution
Genomic changes in small-scale variation such as
changes in nucleotide level and gene level,
changes in alleles within a species, horizontal
gene transfer, introgression, and meiotic drive
elements and large-scale variation contribute to
genome evolution.
Small-Scale Evolution of Fungal Genomes
Small-scale evolution includes mutation (single
nucleotide changes), transposition and repetitive
sequences expansion/contraction.
•
Hypermutation
Fungal isolates with greater mutation rates
than reference strains of the same species are
called
hypermutator
phenotypes.
The
hypermutator strains have been described in
human fungal pathogens such as Cryptococcus
neoformans and Candida glabrata. These
fungi carry mutations in the DNA mismatch
repair pathway, thus displaying hypermutator
phenotypes. Hypermutation is beneﬁcial for
stress adaptations but disadvantageous in the
long term.
•
Fast-evolving regions of the fungal genome
Introns, intergenic sequences, centromeres and
subtelomeric sites are the fast-evolving regions
in the fungal genome. The evolution of introns
occurs by ancestral introns retentions and fre-
quent intron loss or gain. Intergenic sequences
encode long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to
regulate gene expression, morphogenesis, cel-
lular metabolism, mating behaviours, viru-
lence, drug resistance and genomic stability.
Centromeres are rapidly evolving sequences
among fungi. The centromere length varies
between 100 bp and 300 kb among related
species. The centromeres architecture and not
sequence is critical for its function.
Other fast evolving genomic regions are the
subtelomeres and the repeat-rich regions of
fungi
that
harbour
virulence
genes.
Subtelomeric loci are prone to rapid expansion
or
contraction
and
often
encode
genes
associated
with
virulence
and
secondary
metabolites. The rapid subtelomeric evolution
increased the virulence in Candida auris and
Aspergillus fumigatus. Interestingly, C. auris
lineage with low virulence exhibits high muta-
tion in subtelomeric regions.
•
Allelic transmission
The
gene
transmission
between
species/
kingdoms can grossly impact genomic evolu-
tion. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), genetic
introgression and meiotic drive elements are
strong forces of genomic evolution in fungi.
HGT is more frequently observed in pathogenic
fungi such as Malassezia species (acquisition of
bacterial ﬂavohemoglobin and other genes) and
Microsporidia (2% genes derived from HGT).
Introgression also occurs with high frequency
in fungi. For example, the loss and regain of
fermentation
capability
by
Kluyveromyces
lactis by introgression of a subtelomeric locus
from Kluyveromyces marxianus.
Large-Scale Evolution of Fungal Genomes
Large-scale genomic evolution includes chromo-
somal
structural
rearrangements
such
as
deletions,
inversions,
duplications,
and
translocations and chromosome copy number
variation such as polyploidy and aneuploidy.
•
Chromosomal structural rearrangements
Structural
variations
within
chromosomes
have a critical role in the evolution of functions
in fungal species, including host adaptation,
metabolism,
pathogenicity
and
speciation.
Chromosome rearrangements facilitated by

centromeres
have
been
observed
in
Malassezia, Candida and Cryptococcus.
Fungal Genetics
63
•
Chromosome copy number variation
Fungi can undergo both polyploidy (change in
chromosome set numbers) and aneuploidy
(change in chromosome numbers) for stress
adaptation. Polyploidy is common among fun-
gal pathogens. Human fungal pathogen includ-
ing, Candida albicans (haploid, diploid and
tetraploid) and C. neoformans (haploid and
titan cells) induces ploidy variation for rapid
stress
adaptation
whereas
aneuploidy
is
associated with drug resistance in pathogenic
fungi like C. albicans and C. neoformans by
isochromosome formation and aneuploidy,
respectively.
•
B chromosomes
B chromosomes (also called as an accessory or
supernumerary chromosomes) are dispensable
extra chromosomes found in some fungi. B
chromosomes transmit in a non-Mendelian
phenomenon and do not interact with the
core (A) chromosomes set. Their size ranges
from 400 Kb to 3 Mb. The loss or gain of B
chromosomes has been observed in stress
adaptation,
suggesting
a
critical
role
in
genome plasticity. These chromosomes are
essential for imparting virulence and are trans-
mitted horizontally.
Application for Fungal Genetics in
Identification
Apart from causing infections among humans,
fungi also cause a wide spectrum of diseases in
plants and animals. The precise diagnosis of fungi
is of utmost importance owing to the morbidity
and mortality caused, especially in various sus-
ceptible hosts. Among the diagnostic methods
though the phenotypic methods are being rou-
tinely used among laboratories, they have inher-
ent hindrances of being tedious, time-consuming
and entail experience. These roadblocks acting as
a major obstacle to the precise identiﬁcation of
fungi underlined the requisite for implementing
genotypic methods for routine diagnosis. Due to
the multicopy nature (15–20 copies) of the ribo-
somal DNA gene, this is used as the target for
identiﬁcation. However, single-copy genes such
as beta-tubulin, calmodulin and chitin synthase
may be necessary to identify some species. The
rDNA consists of 18s, internal transcribed spacer
1 (ITS-1) 1, 5.8s, ITS-2 and 28s regions; each
copy of rDNA is separated by an intergenic
spacer
region
(IGS).
ITS
region
is
more
conserved and generally used as the target for
identiﬁcation by sequencing and other methods.
Pan fungal primers are available to amplify most
fungi, including yeasts and moulds. Multiple
modalities
like
polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and
DNA sequencing have been exploited for the
same. PCR is considered the simplest and most
inexpensive modality for which many studies
deciphered ITS as the most suitable candidate
for fungal barcoding with the highest probability
of precise identiﬁcation of a larger group of fungi.
Various studies have also been performed to
determine the performance of 18S and 28s
rDNA PCR compared to ITS PCR and culture.

Human Normal Microbial Flora
and Microbiome
6
Humans get colonised with a microbial popula-
tion immediately after birth, which persists
throughout the individual’s lifetime. Normal
microbial ﬂora are the microorganisms that
inhabit the skin and mucous membranes of a
healthy human being and are regularly found at
various anatomical sites. The term indigenous
microbiota is also used for them. For all practical
purposes, they are commensals without any dele-
terious effect on the host, but some can act as
pathogens in certain circumstances.
It has been estimated that humans have
approximately 1013 cells in their bodies, and
about 1014 bacteria are associated with them.
Most bacteria are present in the large bowel,
which constitutes the normal ﬂora. Fundamen-
tally, the organisms are present in parts of the
body that are exposed to or communicate with
the external environment, namely, the skin, nose,
mouth
and
intestinal
and
urogenital
tracts
(Table 6.1). Internal organs and tissues are nor-
mally sterile.
In a pregnant mother, the human foetus lives in
a sterile environment protected from microbes
except when pathogens like cytomegalovirus,
rubella virus or Toxoplasma gondii cross the pla-
centa for the ﬁrst 9 months of life. At the time of
birth,
the
newborn
is
confronted
with
the
mother’s vaginal microbes and environmental
organisms. The infant’s skin surface is initially
colonised, followed by the oropharynx, the gas-
trointestinal tract and mucosal surfaces.

Microbes that can cause serious diseases are
normally found in and on the human body. Not
the recovery of a speciﬁc organism, but the recov-
ery of the organism in a normally sterile site is the
hallmark
of
the
pathogenesis
of
microbial
infections. For example, Escherichia coli is a
normal resident conﬁned to the gastrointestinal
tract. If it is demonstrated in the stool, it may be
considered normal, but if it is found in the abdom-
inal cavity or the patient’s bloodstream, this
would be considered abnormal. Similarly, certain
organisms are never present as part of the normal
microbial ﬂora in humans; hence, their recovery
is always associated with clinically signiﬁcant
diseases (e.g. Bacillus anthracis, Brucella spp.,
Francisella tularensis, Histoplasma capsulatum).
Viruses
and
parasites
are
not
found
as
commensals in the host and are not considered
members of the normal microbial ﬂora.
Normal Microbial Flora
The normal microbial ﬂora is more or less con-
stant for each mammalian species and is broadly
divided into transient ﬂora and resident ﬂora.
Transient ﬂora: These organisms may or may
not be pathogenic and inhabit a particular site
for variable periods from a few hours to a few
weeks. Their occurrence is inﬂuenced by many
factors, including the hospital environment of
an
admitted
patient,
where

resident ﬂora can colonise the person. They
can assume a pathogenic role if there is a
disturbance
of

Resident ﬂora: These are normal ﬂora always
present at a particular site. Even if removed
by
chemicals
or
drugs,
they
promptly
re-appear again within a short span. Examples
include Staphylococcus epidermidis on skin or
E. coli in the intestine.
Diseases result when the interaction between
microbes and the human host results in a patho-
logical process. This process is mediated by
microbial factors or the host’s immune response
to the organism’s presence. The other microbe
and host interaction outcomes are either transient
or prolonged colonisation. Infection is another
term used for colonisation, which does not
imply disease but rather the association of the
microbe with the human host for a time.
Factors Determining Colonisation by
Microbes
Factors that determine whether exposure to
microbes results in transient passage through a
human
host
or
prolonged
colonisation
are
complex and involve microbial properties, host
characteristics and environmental factors.
The colonisation of skin is accomplished by
organisms that can tolerate the dry surface and are
resistant to the fatty acids produced by anaerobic
bacteria and from the metabolism of sebum
triglycerides. The most important factors that
determine colonisation in the human body are
the properties of the speciﬁc organism. For
example, the oropharynx provides the organisms
with opportunities to colonise saliva, mucosal
surface, tongue and gingiva, and the teeth line.
Thus, oxygen-sensitive bacteria proliferate in
the
gingival
crevices.
Streptococcus
mutans
organisms adhere to the hard surface of teeth by
polysaccharides. Bacteria can also bind to cells
lining the oropharynx, intestine and vagina via
speciﬁc receptors for the bacterial pili. This type
of adhesion prevents the mechanical elimination
of organisms.
Various host factors determine the success of
colonisation with the microbe. Nutritional and
environmental conditions must favour the sur-
vival of microbes. The age of the host also
inﬂuences microbial colonisation. In addition,
the hormonal secretions, alteration of dietary
habits, person-to-person interaction, sexual activ-
ity and many other factors determine the estab-
lishment of the normal microbiota.

Normal Microbial Flora
67
Establishment of Normal Flora
The foetus inside the uterus is sterile but gets
colonised during its passage through the birth
canal. With its ﬁrst feed, organisms start entering
the intestines, and the outside environment helps
in the microbial colonisation of skin. It has been
found that a stable ﬂora gets established in about
48 h of birth. Numerous factors are responsible
for inﬂuencing the composition of normal ﬂora,
including age, sex, the genetic make-up of the
person and dietary habits. Hospitalised patients
constitute a special group where the resident ﬂora
changes
subtly,
and
many
of
the
hospital
pathogens normally found only in health care
institutions
can
cause
colonisation.
Such
organisms pose a serious risk of causing serious
infections as the patient is already compromised
in some way, either medically or surgically.
Bacteria
like
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa,
Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Staphylococ-
cus aureus, Klebsiella, Candida albicans and
non-albicans are some of the problem pathogens
which can cause even life-threatening infections
like pneumonia and sepsis.
Importance of Normal Microbial Flora
The normal microbiota prevents colonisation with
potentially pathogenic organisms and maintains a
protected environment. For example, when the
normal intestinal ﬂora has been reduced or
removed by antibiotics, Clostridium difﬁcile
produces gastrointestinal disease. The production
of proteolytic enzymes by microbes augments
host factors in the digestion of food. Intestinal
bacteria can also synthesise vitamins and other
biological products (e.g. biotin, pantothenic acid,
pyridoxine, riboﬂavin, vitamin K). Colicins pro-
duced by some bacteria of normal ﬂora prevent
harmful effects of the bacteria.
Beneficial Effects of Normal Flora
They confer many beneﬁts to the host. (1) They
prevent the colonisation of body sites by patho-
genic microbes. They compete with the attach-
ment of the pathogens, and since they outnumber
the invading organisms, the latter are eliminated.
This has been proved experimentally where
germ-free animals can be infected with far fewer
pathogenic
organisms
than
normal
animals.
(2) The intestinal bacteria synthesise vitamins-
B12 and -K, and the excess is absorbed by the
intestine. (3) Bacteriocins, volatile fatty acids
and peroxides generated by the normal ﬂora can
effectively kill invading microbes. (4) These
organisms act as foreign substances and induce
antibody production. Such antibodies cross-react
and may act against related but pathogenic bacte-
ria in the body, either in the blood or at mucosal
sites.
Harmful Effects of Normal Flora
The organisms which co-inhabit the human body
are largely beneﬁcial for the individual, but in
certain conditions, they may pose a danger as
well. They may act as pathogens if the person’s
immune status is lowered or there is a breach in
the continuity leading to dispersion of these
organisms to other body sites. Intestinal micro-
ﬂora may compete with the host and deprive the
host of nutrients. Some members of the normal
ﬂora may help a pathogen by providing some
essential nutrients, and in such cases, a synergism
between the pathogenic and the non-pathogenic
organisms can occur. Some residents of the upper
respiratory tract, like pneumococcus, may get
transferred to other individuals, causing infection.
Infections Caused by Resident Flora
There are two situations in which the resident
ﬂora may assume a pathogenic role, and such
infections are termed endogenous infections.
First, any major disturbance of the host or host
defences like immunosuppression can result in
the failure of the resident ﬂora to eliminate or
suppress the pathogenic transient ﬂora. In such
situations, the transient ﬂora, and sometimes even
the resident ﬂora, may invade healthy tissues and
cause infection. These infections are also referred
to as opportunistic infections. Second, any break
in the continuity of skin or mucous membrane
may cause the resident ﬂora to invade tissues

where they behave as foreign organisms and ini-
tiate infection and disease process. Table 6.2
enumerates some of the important infections
caused by normal ﬂora.

Microorganisms at Anatomical Sites
The number of resident microorganisms in any
individual far outnumbers the human body’s total
number of cells. The highest number found in
the intestines is to the tune of 1014, while the
numbers are 1010–1012 in the skin and the oral
cavity. Some members are predominant at a par-
ticular site, while others are present in fewer
numbers.
The human body serves as a home for numer-
ous microbes qualitatively and quantitatively.
They cover the skin and mucosal surfaces; occa-
sionally, they invade sterile sites to produce dis-
ease. These microorganisms are a barrier to more
virulent microorganisms, provide vitamins and
required growth factors, or exist as commensal
inhabitants. The complexity of the microbiota is
inﬂuenced over time by environmental, host and
microbial factors. Thus, the knowledge of the
human microbiota forms a fundamental building
block of the normal physiological processes in the
human body.
Respiratory Tract
Nares are inhabited by a small number of
organisms, which include the Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium,
Peptostreptococcus
and
Fusobacterium species. The microbial population
in the nasopharynx is much more complex, with
the
predominance
of
the
streptococci
and
Neisseria
species.
Streptococcus
salivarius,
Streptococcus parasanguinis and Streptococcus
pneumoniae can be readily recovered from the
nasopharynx.
Twelve
species
of
Neisseria
have
been
recovered
from
nasopharyngeal
carriers. Colonisation with Neisseria meningitidis
varies from 10% to 95%, with the highest
incidence in young adults. Other Neisseria
species
that
colonise
the
nasopharynx
are
Neisseria subﬂava, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria
mucosa and Neisseria lactamica. Gram-negative
coccobacilli
that
colonise
the
nasopharynx
include the Moraxella catarrhalis and Kingella
species. Non-capsulated strains of Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae are also commonly found in the
nasopharynx.
Gastrointestinal Tract
The oropharynx is a complex mixture of
ecosystems. Gram-positive and Gram-negative
cocci predominate in the oropharynx. Overall,
anaerobes outnumber aerobes with a ratio of
100:1. The most common anaerobic bacteria pres-
ent in the oropharynx are Peptostreptococcus,
Veillonella, Actinomyces and Fusobacterium,
whereas the most common aerobic bacteria are
Streptococcus
and
Neisseria.
Gram-negative
cocci and coccobacilli also colonise the orophar-
ynx. Veillonella, anaerobic Gram-negative cocci,
are the most numerous Gram-negative cocci
found in the oropharynx.
The predominant anaerobes found in the oro-
pharynx are the Fusobacterium, Bacteroides,
Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Selenomonas
species. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the most
common Fusobacterium found in the mouth.
Fungal
colonisation
of
the
oropharynx
is
restricted to yeasts; C. albicans is present in
almost all individuals. Entamoeba gingivalis and
Trichomonas tenax are the only protozoa present
in the oropharynx.

Normal Microbial Flora
69
The stomach contains hydrochloric acid and
pepsinogen, and is an inhospitable organ. For this
reason, the normal microbial ﬂora is very sparse
in
the
stomach.
The
organisms
present
in
the stomach are the acid-tolerant Lactobacillus
spp.,
Streptococcus
spp.
and
Helicobacter
pylori. H. pylori can become pathogenic and
causes gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and
gastric malignancy. In the upper part of the small
intestine, the number of microbes is less than
105/mL of ﬂuid. They are predominantly anaero-
bic, consisting of Lactobacillus, Peptostrep-
tococcus, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas and
Prevotella. The microbial ﬂora shifts to resemble
colonic bacteria if upper tract obstruction and
stasis
occur.
This
leads
to
malabsorption
syndrome.
The large intestine is the organ most densely
populated with microbial ﬂora. It consists of
more than 108 aerobic bacteria and 1011 anaero-
bic bacteria per gram of faeces, various yeasts
and non-pathogenic parasites. E. coli causes
colonisation soon after an infant is born. It is the
most common facultative organism responsible
for intra-abdominal infections. Other members
of Enterobacteriaceae like Citrobacter spp., Kleb-
siella spp., Enterobacter spp. and Proteus spp.
can establish residence in the intestine. Various
species of Candida and protozoa colonise the
large intestine.
Genitourinary Tract
The
genitourinary
tract
is
generally
sterile
except for the female urethra and vagina. The
ureters, kidneys, prostate and cervix are normally
sterile. The female urethra is colonised with a
large number of lactobacilli, streptococcal species
and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Faecal
organisms, such as E. coli, Enterococcus spp.
and Candida spp., can also colonise the female
urethra, which is transient.
The microbial ﬂora in the vagina is more
numerous
and
diverse.
Lactobacilli
are
the
predominant organisms, with the most commonly
isolated species being Lactobacillus acidophilus,
Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei
and Lactobacillus cellobiose. Other anaerobes
commonly
isolated
from
the
vagina
are
the
Biﬁdobacterium,
Peptostreptococcus,
Porphyromonas and Prevotella species. The aer-
obic bacteria present in the vagina include
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococ-
cus (viridans group and beta-haemolytic strains),
Corynebacterium spp., Gardnerella vaginalis,
Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp. and members
of Enterobacteriaceae. The ﬂagellate Trichomo-
nas vaginalis is present in small numbers in
healthy
women.
The
Candida
species
and
Torulopsis glabrata are common members of
the microbial ﬂora of the vagina.
Body Surface
Human
skin
is
constantly
bombarded
by
organisms present in the environment. The skin
is exposed to extremes of temperature, moisture
and chemical disinfectants. There the microbial
population is less numerous and complex than at
other body sites. The skin is not a homogenous
surface. There are relatively dry areas like palms
and soles; areas with more apocrine glands, such
as axillary, inguinal and perianal areas; and areas
rich with sebaceous glands like forehead and
nasolabial folds. Most organisms proliferate in
the moist area. Thus higher densities of microbes
are present in areas rich with sweat glands. The
skin of the face, perirectal area or groin has a
more complex microbial ﬂora than that at other
sites (Fig. 6.1).
Anaerobic bacteria are 10- to 100-fold more
numerous on the skin surface than aerobic bacte-
ria. Gram-positive bacteria predominate over
Gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria more com-
monly recovered from skin surfaces are Staphylo-
coccus spp., Micrococcus spp., Corynebacterium
spp., Peptostreptococcus and Propionibacterium
spp. S. epidermidis is the most commonly isolated
bacterium. Gram-negative bacteria are generally
not recovered from the skin surface, except dur-
ing transient colonisation. Acinetobacter spp.
organisms have adapted to survive in moist
areas of the skin.
Fungal colonisation of the skin surface is tran-
sient. This includes colonisation with yeasts
(C. albicans, Malassezia furfur and Rhodotorula)
and dermatophytes. Among these, M. furfur is
present in most individuals.

Human Normal Microbial Flora and Microbiome
Fig. 6.1 Sites of normal microbial ﬂora of the human
In the conjunctiva, the ﬂushing action of tears
and the presence of lysozymes in tears usually
make the site free of bacteria. The organisms
present in the conjunctiva are Corynebacterium
xerosis,
Moraxella
spp.,
S.
aureus
and
non-haemolytic streptococci.
Sterile Sites
The body ﬂuids, including blood, cerebrospinal
ﬂuid, synovial, pleural, pericardial, peritoneal and
other exudates, are normally sterile or transiently
infected by microbes. Some microbes from the
mouth and gastrointestinal tract can invade
the bloodstream in healthy individuals (during
tooth brushing or a bowel movement). These
organisms are rapidly removed and are of little
signiﬁcance. Thus, the isolation of an organism
from body ﬂuids should be considered signiﬁcant
unless the specimen is contaminated during its
collection.
Organ tissues are also generally sterile unless
they are infected following systemic spread.

Some bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis
may be disseminated to the lungs, liver and
kidneys during initial infection and remain dor-
mant. In this situation, the organism can be recov-
ered from tissue samples. Long-term colonisation
with organisms like Pneumocystis carinii or
latent viruses, such as herpes simplex virus or
cytomegalovirus, may commonly occur. The
external auditory meatus, being an extension of
the skin, is colonised primarily by S. epidermidis
and diphtheroids.
The Human Microbiome
71
Effects of Alteration of Normal
Microbial Flora
Some conditions could adversely affect the nor-
mal microﬂora of the human body, including
skin, gut and so on. It includes diseases such as
obesity, inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), dia-
betes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, atherosclero-
sis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis, hepatocel-
lular carcinoma and therapies including immuno-
suppression, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and
antibiotics. Under such conditions, normal ﬂora
may be reduced, lost or replaced by other
microorganisms, that is, population suppression
or replacement. As a result, it allows the
pathogens to invade and colonise in the absence
of the defence system enacted by the normal ﬂora.
Such pathogens, commonly known as opportu-
nistic pathogens, impair the overall health of the
susceptible individual and can cause infections
depending on the location it has replaced the
normal ﬂora. For example, replacement of skin
and gut microﬂora can lead to higher chances of
skin diseases (dermatitis) and gastrointestinal
complications, respectively.
Pseudomembranous
colitis
is
an
acute
inﬂammatory disease of the colon that may
cause mild colon inﬂammation to a severe life-
threatening condition. Only after the 1970s,
C. difﬁcile was found to be associated with
pseudomembranous colitis. This condition is
mainly caused by the indiscriminate use of
antibiotics that disrupts the normal ﬂora’s bal-
ance, thus providing a suitable environment for
the proliferation of the pathogenic microbes. Cer-
tain antibiotics like ﬂuoroquinolones, penicillin,
clindamycin and cephalosporins may lead to
overgrowth of C. difﬁcile (which is otherwise
present in few numbers as normal ﬂora) by
suppressing the growth of the gut ﬂora that nor-
mally keeps it in check. The toxins produced by
C. difﬁcile rise in quantity to cause damage to the
colon. This condition is treatable if it is diagnosed
on time. Thus to prevent the suppression of gut
ﬂora, wherever possible, an accurate dosage of
narrow-spectrum
antibiotics
has
to
be
administered at the right time.
The Human Microbiome
Commensal organisms outnumber body cells by
ten to one in the human body. It is estimated that
the total number of bacteria in a healthy adult is
3.8  1013. Most of them reside in the gut, partic-
ularly the large intestine. The total genome and
gene product of these commensal organisms
living in humans is known as the microbiome.
The
number
of
genes
in
an
individual’s
microbiome is 200 times the number of genes in
the human genome. The microbiome’s composi-
tion is dynamic in infancy, with the ﬁrst
colonisation occurring in the sterile gut and
other parts of the body in the newborn. However,
by the end of infancy, the core microbiome is
fully formed predominantly of anaerobic bacteria
such as Bacteroides, Biﬁdobacterium and Clos-
tridium spp. in the gut.
The microbiome plays a vital role in human
development, immunity and nutrition and beneﬁts
the individual in several ways. The gut bacteria
competitively inhibit the colonisation of patho-
genic bacteria and thus protect us from various
infections. It also helps in the digestion of food
and the production of vitamins K, B12, thiamine
and riboﬂavin. It also plays a vital role in the
functioning of the immune system. Disturbance
of the normal microbiome is termed dysbiosis and
is associated with various autoimmune disorders
like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dys-
trophy and multiple sclerosis. Changes in gene
activity
and
metabolic
processes
may
be

responsible for this type of abnormal immune
response against self-antigens.
72
6
Human Normal Microbial Flora and Microbiome
One of the recent procedures being tried is
faecal microbiota transplantation or faecal
transplantation, where stool of a normal individ-
ual is introduced into the large intestine by instru-
mentation
like
colonoscopy
to
restore
the
microbiota in a diseased person. It has been tried
successfully to cure severe C. difﬁcile infections
and treat colitis, constipation and irritable bowel
syndrome.
Probiotics and Prebiotics
Probiotics are preparations of live beneﬁcial gut
microorganisms that maintain the normal gut
microﬂora and beneﬁt the host. There are differ-
ent groups of probiotic microorganisms. The
most common are bacteria belonging to the
genus Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacterium. Yeast
like Saccharomyces boulardii is also used as
probiotics. Yoghurt, Sauerkraut, Miso Soup,
Soft Cheeses, Keﬁr, Sourdough Bread, Acidoph-
ilus Milk and so on are examples of probiotic
foods that contain live preparation of beneﬁcial
microorganisms.
In
case
of
gastrointestinal
complications that lead to loss of gut microﬂora
(e.g. use of broad-spectrum antibiotics kills the
gut microﬂora), probiotics help restore the gut
microbiome.
On
the
other
hand,
prebiotics
are
the
non-digestible dietary ingredient that beneﬁcially
affect the host by selectively stimulating the
growth or activity of a limited number of bacteria
in the colon. Fructooligosaccharides are a primary
example of prebiotics. Prebiotics are naturally
found in many fruits and vegetables, especially
those containing complex carbohydrates, such as
ﬁbre and resistant starch.

Microbial Infections
7
The host-parasite relationship is determined by
the interaction between host factors and the
infecting microorganisms. The outcome of any
microbial infection depends on the interaction
between the host and the parasite. The relation-
ship between the host and parasite may be symbi-
osis, commensalism or disease.
Symbiosis describes a situation where both the
microorganisms and the host species live together
with mutual beneﬁt. There is an element of sym-
biosis in the relationship between the human host
and the gut ﬂora. Commensalism is an associa-
tion in which only the microorganism derives
beneﬁt without causing any injury to the host.
Most human microbes are commensals. The dis-
ease is caused by certain microorganisms known
as pathogens. Microorganisms vary in their abil-
ity to cause disease in humans.
Types of Microorganisms
Microorganisms may be of the following types:
Saprophytes:
These
are
free-living
microorganisms that live on dead or decaying
organic matter. They are usually present in soil
and water. They are generally unable to invade
the living body.
Parasites: These are microorganisms that live on
a living host, derive nutrition from the host

73
without any beneﬁt to the host and cause
harm to the infected host.
Commensals: These are microorganisms that live
on a living host without causing any injury to
the
host.
Most
human
microbes
are
commensals.
Pathogens: A microorganism capable of causing
disease, especially if it causes disease in
immunocompetent people, is called a patho-
gen. These pathogens, however, represent
a very small proportion of the microbial
species.
Opportunistic pathogens: A microbe capable of
causing disease only in immunocompromised
people is an opportunistic pathogen. These
organisms can cause disease only if one or
more of humans’ usual defence mechanisms
are reduced or altered by accident, by intent
(e.g. surgery), an underlying metabolic disor-
der or an infectious disease (e.g. AIDS).
The words virulence and virulent are derived
from the Latin word virulentus, meaning “full of
poison”. The term virulentus is derived from the
Latin words virus (poison) and lentus (fullness),
and, in turn, the term virus may be related to the
Sanskrit word visham, meaning “poison”. The
virulence of a microbe is determined by virulence
factors, such as capsules, exotoxins or endotoxins
(Table 7.1).

Commensalism and the Microbiome
Commensal organisms outnumber body cells by
ten to one in the human body. It is estimated that
the total number of bacteria in a healthy adult is
3.8  1013. The majority of them reside in the gut,
particularly the large intestine. The total genome
and gene product of these commensal organisms
living in humans is the microbiome. The number
of genes in an individual’s microbiome is
200 times the number of genes in the human
genome.
The
microbiome’s
composition
is
dynamic in infancy, with the ﬁrst colonisation
occurring in the newborn’s sterile gut and other
parts of the body. However, by the end of infancy,
the core microbiome is fully formed predomi-
nantly of anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides,
Biﬁdobacterium, and Clostridium spp. in the gut.
The microbiome plays a vital role in human
development,
immunity
and
nutrition,
and
beneﬁts the individual in several ways. The gut
bacteria competitively inhibit the colonisation of
pathogenic bacteria and thus protect us from vari-
ous infections. It also helps in the digestion of
food and the production of vitamins K, B12,
thiamine and riboﬂavin. It also plays a vital role
in the functioning of the immune system. Distur-
bance of the normal microbiome is termed
dysbiosis, and it is associated with various auto-
immune
disorders
like
diabetes,
rheumatoid
arthritis, muscular dystrophy and multiple sclero-
sis. Changes in the gene activity and metabolic
processes may be responsible for this type of
abnormal immune response against self-antigens.
One of the recent procedures being tried is
faecal microbiota transplantation or faecal
transplantation, where stool of an average indi-
vidual is introduced into the large intestine by
instrumentation like colonoscopy to restore the
microbiota in a diseased person. It has been tried
successfully to cure severe Clostridium difﬁcile
infections and treat colitis, constipation and irrita-
ble bowel syndrome.
Infection
This is a process when an organism enters the
body, increases in number and causes damage to
the host. All infections do not invariably result in
disease. The term infection has more than one
meaning: the presence of microbes in the body
and the symptoms of the disease. The presence of
microbes in the body does not always result in
symptoms of the disease.
Infestation indicates scenarios where large num-
bers of disease-carrying animals or insects
occupy a place or host and cause damages
including structural, chemical and biological.
Infestation increases chances of disease disper-
sion from one location to another unless con-
trolled otherwise. In most cases, mites, ticks
and lice carry the parasitic pathogens and
result in infestation, either external or internal,

depending
on
the
parasites’
location
in
the host.
Growth of microorganisms in a site on a host is
called colonisation. In normal conditions,
enteric bacteria colonise the intestine, grow
and
form
the
normal
ﬂora.
However,
colonisation of pathogens including opportu-
nistic pathogens leads to disease.
Types of Infections
Infections may be of various types:
Primary infection: This condition denotes an
initial infection with an organism in a host.
Reinfection: This condition denotes subsequent
infection with the same organism in the
same host.
Secondary infection: This condition denotes an
infection with a new organism in a host whose
body resistance is already lowered by a
pre-existing infectious disease.
Cross-infection: This condition denotes an infec-
tion with a new organism from another host or
another external source in a patient already
suffering from a disease.
Nosocomial infection: Cross-infections acquired
in hospitals are called hospital-acquired, hos-
pital-associated or nosocomial infections.
Iatrogenic infection: This condition denotes a
physician-induced
infection
resulting
from
therapy with drugs or investigation procedures.
Subclinical
infection:
Inapparent
clinical
infections are called sub-clinical infections.
Latent infections: This denotes a condition in
which some organisms may remain in a latent
or hidden stage in the host, and subsequently,
they multiply to produce clinical disease when
host resistance is lowered.
Transmission of Infection
Three critical components play an essential role in
successfully
transmitting
microbial
diseases.
These are (1) sources, (2) mode of transmission
and (3) susceptible host.
Sources of Infection
Sources of microbial infections are human, ani-
mal, plant, soil or inanimate matter in which
organisms usually live, multiply and cause the
infections
with
or
without
overt
clinical
manifestations. Humans are usually the common
reservoirs of many microbial infections. Animals
are reservoirs of zoonotic infections, such as
plague (e.g. rats), rabies (e.g. dogs), cysticercosis
(e.g. pigs) and so on. The sources of infections
may be endogenous or exogenous.
Endogenous sources: The source of infection
is the normal bacterial ﬂora present in the
human body. These bacteria are usually
non-pathogenic
but
in
certain
situations
become pathogenic and cause infections at
different sites in the same host. For example,
Escherichia coli present as normal ﬂora of the
intestine may cause urinary tract infection in
the same host. Similarly, viridans streptococci
present as part of the normal ﬂora of the mouth
may cause infective endocarditis.
Exogenous sources: The source of infection is
from outside the host’s body. Most of the
microbial infections are exogenous. The exog-
enous sources include the following:
Humans
Humans are the most common sources of
infections caused by microorganisms. They may
be either patients or carriers. A patient suffering
from an active infection is an important source of
infection for others.
Carrier: A carrier is a person who harbours path-
ogenic microorganisms without showing any
signs and symptoms of the disease. Carriers
are also important sources of infections. A
carrier may be a (1) healthy carrier, (2) conva-
lescent
carrier,
(3)
temporary
carrier
or
(4) chronic carrier.
A healthy carrier is a host who harbours
the microorganism without ever suffering from
the
disease
caused
by
that
microorganism.
A convalescent carrier is a host who continues
to
harbour
the
microorganism
even
after

recovering from the clinical disease caused by the
same pathogen. A temporary carrier is a host
who harbours the microorganism up to 6 months
after recovering from the disease caused by the
same pathogen. Finally, a chronic carrier is a
host who harbours the microorganism for many
years after recovering from the clinical disease
caused by the same pathogen.
76

Microbial Infections
Animals
Animals are also important sources of infection
for humans. Symptomatic, as well as asymptom-
atic, animals can transmit infections to humans.
Asymptomatic animals act as a reservoir of
human infections. These are called reservoir
hosts. Infections transmitted from animals to
humans are called zoonotic infections. Examples
of
zoonotic
infections
include
bacterial
(e.g. plague, anthrax, bovine tuberculosis), viral
(e.g.
rabies,
Japanese
encephalitis),
fungal
(e.g. dermatophytic infections) and parasitic
(e.g.
toxoplasmosis,
cysticercosis,
hydatid
disease).

Insects
Insects, such as mosquitoes, ticks, mites, ﬂies,
ﬂeas and lice, may transmit a wide variety of
microorganisms to humans (Table 7.2). The
diseases transmitted by insects are collectively
referred to as arthropod-borne diseases and the
insects transmitting these pathogens are called
vectors. Insect vectors may transmit the infection
in
two
ways:
mechanical
transmission
and
biological transmission.
Mechanical transmission is by vectors such
as insects (e.g. domestic ﬂies) carrying enteric

bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp. etc.)
mechanically on their legs, wings and surface of
the body and transfer them to food. Biological
transmission is carried out by vectors in which
the microorganisms multiply or undergo a part of
their life cycle before being transmitted to
humans. For example, rat ﬂea and female Anoph-
eles mosquitoes are biological vectors that trans-
mit plague and malaria, respectively, to humans
by biting. Besides acting as vectors, insects also
act as reservoir hosts (e.g. ticks in relapsing
fever).

Extrinsic incubation period (EIP) is the time
taken by a pathogen to grow in an intermediate
host before it could transmit by the host. As such,
it is a time-dependent journey of a pathogen
through several vector tissues and organs. For
example, the EIP of malaria (period of sporog-
ony) is the time taken by the parasites to grow in
the mosquito and reach the salivary glands to
make the mosquito infectious.
Environment
These include food, water and soil and inanimate
objects.
Food contaminated with pathogens also acts
as a source of infection and causes diarrhoea,
dysentery, food poisoning and gastroenteritis.
Water contaminated with microorganisms also
acts as a source of infection and transmits water-
borne diseases, such as leptospirosis, cholera,
dysentery, hepatitis A infection and so on. Soil,
a perfect ecosystem for microbial growth, is
responsible for the transmission of soil-borne
pathogens including Salmonella enterica, Cam-
pylobacter spp., E. coli, Legionella spp. (pneu-
monia; Legionnaires’ disease), Mycobacterium
leprae (leprosy), Shigella spp. (shigellosis) and
so on.
Modes of Transmission
Microbial pathogens causing various infectious
diseases are transmitted from one host to another
in many ways as follows (Table 7.3).
Contact
Transmission of microorganisms from person to
person occurs by direct or indirect contact.
Transmission by direct contact occurs through
touching, kissing, sex and so on. The diseases
transmitted by direct contact include common
cold, staphylococcal infections and sexually
transmitted infections (e.g. gonorrhoea, syphilis,
AIDS).
The
term
contagious
disease
was
used earlier for the disease acquired by direct
contact.
Microorganisms can also be transmitted by
indirect
contact
through
inanimate objects,
such as clothing, handkerchiefs, toys and so on,
called fomites. Inﬂuenza, tuberculosis and certain
superﬁcial fungal infections are diseases transmit-
ted by fomites.

78

Microbial Infections
Inoculation
Infections can be transmitted by the inoculation of
microorganisms directly into the host’s tissues.
For example, tetanus is transmitted by direct inoc-
ulation of Clostridium tetani spores present in the
soil to the injured tissues in the host. These spores
then germinate to vegetative forms of bacteria and
migrate along the neural tissues to cause tetanus.
Similarly, through their act of biting, rabid dogs
inoculate the rabies virus directly to host tissue
and cause rabies in humans.
Iatrogenic infection occurs following the use of
unsterile syringes and equipment in a hospital.
Hepatitis B and C and HIV infections are
examples of iatrogenic infections caused by
the
use
of
contaminated
syringes
and
contaminated blood and blood products.
Laboratory-acquired infections (LAI) occurs
to the laboratory personnel working with
pathogens. It is most common where appropri-
ate laboratory safety measures and personnel
training have not been critically considered. A
LAI could be obtained through inhalation, per-
cutaneous inoculation (needle and syringe,
cuts or abrasions from contaminated items
and animal bites), contact between mucous
membranes and contaminated material (hands
or surfaces) and ingestion (aspiration through a
pipette, smoking or eating). Depending on the
pathogen being handled, the person may be
symptomatic or remain asymptomatic.
Ingestion
Ingestion of water and food contaminated with
microorganisms can transmit a wide variety of
microbial infections. For example, food poison-
ing caused by Bacillus cereus is transmitted by
rice contaminated with bacterial spores that sur-
vive boiling. Cholera, typhoid, food poisoning,
hepatitis A, poliomyelitis and many parasitic
infections are other diseases transmitted by inges-
tion of contaminated food and water.
Inhalation
Infections are transmitted by inhalation of drop-
let nuclei that are discharged into the air by
coughing,
sneezing
or
talking.
Respiratory
pathogens are shed into the environment by
patients in secretions from the nose or throat
during coughing, sneezing or talking. Small
droplets (less than 0.1 mm in diameter) become
airborne as minute particles or droplet nuclei
(1–10 μm in diameter), whereas large droplets
fall to the ground. Measles, inﬂuenza, whooping
cough, tuberculosis and aspergillosis are a few
examples of infectious diseases acquired by
inhalation.
Vectors
Mosquitoes, ﬂies, ﬂeas, ticks, mites and lice are
the vectors that transmit many diseases, as men-
tioned earlier.
Susceptible Host
The infective agent enters the body through four
main routes such as genital tract, respiratory tract,
gastrointestinal tract and skin. The pathogens can
be transmitted either as vertical or horizontal
transmission.
Vertical transmission: Certain bacteria (Trepo-
nema pallidum), viruses (rubella and cytomeg-
alovirus) and parasites (Toxoplasma gondii)
can be transferred from mother to foetus by a
process
called
vertical
transmission.
The
organisms can be transmitted vertically in
three ways: (1) across the placenta, (2) within
the birth canal during birth and (3) through
breast milk. Table 7.4 summarises a list of
diseases transmitted vertically.
Horizontal transmission: Unlike vertical trans-
mission, horizontal transmission occurs from
person to person and is not from mother to
offspring (Fig. 7.1).
Pathogenesis of Infections
The pathogenesis of infectious diseases is com-
plex. The outcome of infection depends on vari-
ous factors of the microbe and the host. These
include (1) the ability of the organism to break
host barriers and evade destruction by innate local
and tissue host defences, (2) the ability of the
organism to replicate, spread, establish infection

and cause disease, (3) the ability of the organism
to transmit to a new susceptible host and (4) the
innate and adaptive immunologic ability of the
host to control and eliminate the invading
microorganism.

Factors Predisposing to Microbial
Pathogenicity
Pathogenicity is the capacity of a pathogen spe-
cies to cause disease, whereas virulence is
used to describe the sum of disease-causing
properties of a population (strain) within the
species. Pathogens can be distinguished from
their avirulent counterparts by speciﬁc genes
or gene clusters in the genome known as path-
ogenicity islands.
Virulence is a measure of a microbe’s ability to
cause disease. It is a quantitative measure of
pathogenicity and is measured by the number
of organisms required to cause disease. It
means that a highly virulent microbe requires
fewer organisms to cause disease than a less
virulent one; hence it is directly dependent on
the infectious dose of the organism.
The virulence of bacteria, in particular, depends
on the following factors:
Adhesions
Adherence of bacteria to the body surface is
the most important event in the pathogenesis of
the disease. Once bacteria enter the host’s body,
they must adhere to the cells of a tissue surface. If
they do not adhere, they will be swept away by
mucus and other ﬂuids that bathe the tissue
surface.
Specialised molecules mediate bacterial adher-
ence to the cell surface. The various molecules
that mediate adherence to the cell surface are
called adhesins. These adhesins allow the bacte-
ria to adhere to the surface of human cells,
thereby promoting their ability to cause disease.
Conversely, microorganisms that lack this mech-
anism are non-pathogenic. Bacterial adhesins are
divided into two major groups: pili (ﬁmbriae) and
non-pilus adhesins (ﬁmbrial adhesins).
Pili These ﬁbres extend from the bacterial
surfaces and attach bacteria to speciﬁc receptors
on the host cells. The pili of many Gram-negative
bacteria bind directly to sugar residues of
glycolipids or glycoproteins present on the mem-
brane of the host cells. They also act as a protein
scaffold to which another more speciﬁc adhesive
protein can attach.

80
7
Microbial Infections
Fig. 7.1 Schematic diagram showing horizontal and vertical transmission of infections
The pili of the Gram-negative bacteria are
classiﬁed into ﬁve types. They are critical in the
pathogenesis of infections caused by them. Also,
antigenic variation in the actual structural pilin
protein can lead to antigenic diversity in the
pathogen.
Most E. coli strains that cause pyogenic
nephritis produce an adhesin protein called
P-pili (pyelonephritis-associated pili) encoded
by pap genes. Many of these adhesin proteins
are present at the tip of the pili that bind speciﬁc
receptors on the surface of the urinary bladder.
The binding prevents the bacteria from being
washed away from the urinary bladder by the
ﬂushing action of the urine.
Similarly, the pili of Neisseria gonorrhoeae
mediate the organism’s attachment by binding to
oligosaccharide receptors on the epithelial cells of
the urethra. The gonococci use pili as primary
adhesins and opacity-associated proteins (Opa)
as secondary adhesins to cells. These Opa
proteins intercede adherence to polymorphonu-
clear
cells.
A
part
of
gonococci
survives
subsequent phagocytosis by these cells. In organ
cultures of the uterine (fallopian) tube, the
gonococci afﬁx to the microvilli of non-ciliated
cells and emerge to activate engulfment by these
cells. These gonococci develop intracellularly
and drift to the sub-epithelial space by an unex-
plained action.

Infection
81
Non-pilus adhesins These include glycocalyx
and other adhesins present on the bacterial
surfaces. The glycocalyx is a polysaccharide
“slime layer” secreted by some strains of bacteria
that
mediates
strong
adherence
to
certain
structures, such as catheters, prosthetic implants
and heart valves. For example, the glycocalyx of
Staphylococcus epidermidis and certain viridans
streptococci allows the bacteria to adhere ﬁrmly
to the endothelium of the heart valve. The matrix
formed by these adhesins-forming proteins is
called a bioﬁlm.
Bioﬁlms
are
important
in
pathogenesis
because they protect the bacteria from host
defence and antibiotics. In addition, the bioﬁlms
facilitate bacteria colonisation, especially surgical
appliances, such as artiﬁcial valves or indwelling
catheters. Streptococcus pyogenes makes use of
non-pilus adhesins (such as lipoteichoic acid, pro-
tein F and M protein) to bind to epithelial cells.
Recently, it has been shown that certain strains of
E. coli and Shigella spp. have surface proteins
called curli, which help bind bacteria to the host
endothelium and extracellular proteins.
Bioﬁlms are important in human infections
that are persistent and difﬁcult to treat. A few
examples include (1) S. epidermidis and Staphy-
lococcus aureus infections of central venous
catheters; (2) eye infections that occur with con-
tact lenses and intraocular lenses; (3) infections in
dental plaque and (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa
airway infections in cystic ﬁbrosis patients.
Bioﬁlm also confers an inherent resistance to
anti-microbial
agents,
whether
these
anti-
microbial agents are anti-biotics, disinfectants or
germicides.
The
mechanisms
of
resistance
include (1) delayed penetration of anti-microbial
agents through the bioﬁlm matrix, (2) the altered
growth rate of bioﬁlm organisms and (3) other
physiological changes due to the bioﬁlm mode of
growth.
Invasiveness
Invasiveness refers to the ability of an organism
to invade the host cells after establishing infec-
tion. “Invasion” is the term commonly used to
describe the entry of bacteria into host cells,
implying an active role for the organisms and a
passive role for the host cells. For many disease-
causing bacteria, invasion of the host’s epithelium
is central to the infectious process. Some bacteria
(e.g. Salmonella spp.) invade tissues through the
intracellular junctions in the cytoplasm. Some
bacteria (e.g. Shigella spp.) multiply within host
cells, whereas others do not.
Shigella spp. initiate the infection process by
adhering to host cells in the small intestine. Mul-
tiple proteins, including the invasion plasmid
antigens (IpA-D), contribute to the process.
Once inside the cells, the shigellae are either
lysed or escape from the phagocytic vesicle,
multiplying in the cytoplasm.
Other bacteria (e.g. Yersinia spp.) invade spe-
ciﬁc types of hosts’ epithelial cells and may sub-
sequently enter the tissue. Once inside the host
cell, they may remain enclosed in a vacuole com-
posed of the host cell membrane, or the vacuole
membrane may dissolve, and the bacteria may
disperse within the cell and from one cell to
another.
Invasion of tissues followed by inﬂammation
is enhanced by many factors, which include:
(1)
enzymes,
(2)
antiphagocytic
factors,
(3) inﬂammation and (4) intracellular survival.
1. Enzymes:
The
invasion
of
bacteria
is
enhanced by many enzymes. Many species of
bacteria produce enzymes that are not intrinsi-
cally toxic but do play important roles in the
infectious process. Some of these enzymes are
discussed below:
(a)
Hyaluronidases
and
collagenase:
Hyaluronidases and collagenase are the
enzymes that hydrolyse hyaluronic acid
and
degrade
collagen,
respectively,
thereby allowing the bacteria to spread
through subcutaneous tissues.
Hyaluronidases are produced by many
bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci
and anaerobes) and aid in their spread
through tissues. For example, hyaluroni-
dase produced by S. pyogenes degrades
hyaluronic acid in the subcutaneous tis-
sue, thereby facilitating the organism to
spread rapidly. Clostridium perfringens

produces the proteolytic enzyme collage-
nase, which degrades collagen (the major
protein of ﬁbrous connective tissue), and
promotes the spread of infection in the
tissue.

Microbial Infections
(b)
Coagulase:
S.
aureus
produces
the
enzyme coagulase, which coagulates the
plasma in association with blood factors.
Coagulase contributes to the formation of
ﬁbrin
walls
around
staphylococcal
lesions, which protects bacteria from
phagocytosis by walling off the infected
area. The enzyme also causes ﬁbrin depo-
sition on the surfaces of individual
staphylococci, which may help protect
them from phagocytosis or destruction
within phagocytic cells.
(c)
Streptokinase
(ﬁbrinolysin):
Ma
haemolytic
streptococci
produce
the
enzyme streptokinase, which activates
plasma proteolytic enzyme. This enzyme
can then dissolve coagulated plasma and
thereby possibly aids in the rapid spread of
streptococci through tissues. Streptokinase
has been used to treat acute myocardial
infarction to dissolve ﬁbrin clots.
Fig. 7.2 Schematic
diagram showing various
stages of the infection
process
(d)
IgA1 proteases: Certain pathogenic bac-
teria produce enzymes IgA1 proteases
that split IgA1 at speciﬁc proline–threo-
nine or proline–serine bonds in the hinge
region and inactivate its antibody activ-
ity. IgA1 protease is an important viru-
lence factor of the pathogens, such as
N. gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis,
Haemophilus inﬂuenza and Streptococ-
cus pneumoniae. Production of IgA1 pro-
tease allows the pathogens to inactivate
the primary antibody found on mucosal
surfaces and thereby facilitates the attach-
ment of these bacteria to the mucous
membrane.
2. Antiphagocytic
factors:
Many
bacterial
pathogens are rapidly killed once they are
ingested
by
polymorphonuclear
cells
or
macrophages.
However,
some
pathogens
evade phagocytosis or leukocyte microbicidal
mechanisms by several antiphagocytic factors.
(a)
Capsule: The capsule surrounding bacte-
ria such as S. pneumoniae (Fig. 7.2) and
N. meningitidis is the most important
antiphagocytic
factor.
It
retards
the
phagocytosis of bacteria by preventing

Infection
83
the phagocytes from adhering to the
bacteria.
(b)
Cell wall proteins: Cell wall proteins,
such as the protein A and protein M, of
S. aureus and S. pyogenes, especially are
antiphagocytic. For example, protein A
of S. aureus binds to IgG and prevents
complement activation. M protein of
S. pyogenes is antiphagocytic.
(c)
Cytotoxins: Certain bacteria produce
cytotoxins that interfere with chemotaxis
or
phagocyte
killing.
For
example,
S. aureus produces haemolysins and
leukocidins that lyse and damage RBCs
and WBCs.
(d)
Surface antigens: Surface antigens of
bacteria such as Vi antigen of S. typhi
and K antigen of E. coli make the bacteria
resistant to phagocytosis and lytic activity
of complement.
3. Inﬂammation: Inﬂammation is an important
host defence induced by the presence of bacte-
ria in the body. It is of two types: pyogenic and
granulomatous. Pyogenic inﬂammation is the
host defence seen primarily against pyogenic
or
pus-producing
bacteria,
such
as
S. pyogenes. It typically consists of neutrophils
and the production of speciﬁc antibodies and
elevated levels of complement. Granuloma-
tous inﬂammation is the host defence seen
primarily
against
intracellular
granuloma-
producing bacteria, such as Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M. leprae and so on. The
response
consists
of
the
production
of
macrophages and CD4+ T cells.
4. Intracellular Survival: A few mechanisms
suggested for intracellular survival of bacteria
include
(1)
inhibition
of
phagolysosome
fusion,
(2)
resistance
to
the
action
of

1. Bacteria
(such
as
Chlamydia,
M. tuberculosis) interfering with the forma-
tion of phagolysosomes in a phagocyte can
evade the host defence process and survive
intracellularly. Thus, these bacteria live
within cells and are protected from attack
by macrophages and neutrophils. On the
other hand, bacteria that do not interfere
with the formation of phagolysosomes are
killed by the phagocytes.
2. Capsular polysaccharide in Mycobacterium
lepraemurium
and
mycoside
in
M. tuberculosis makes these bacteria resis-
tant to the action of lysosomal enzymes.
3. Certain bacteria, such as rickettsiae, escape
from the phagosome into the host cell’s
cytoplasm before the phagosome fuses
with a lysosome and hence they remain
intracellularly.
A list of intracellular pathogens is given in
Table 7.5.
Toxigenicity
Toxins produced by bacteria are generally classi-
ﬁed into two groups: exotoxins and endotoxins.
Exotoxins
Exotoxins are heat-labile proteins that are pro-
duced by several Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. These are bacterial products
secreted into tissues and directly harm tissues or
trigger destructive biological activities (Fig. 7.3).
The genes coding for these proteins is frequently
encoded on a plasmid or bacteriophage DNA.
Some important toxins encoded by plasmids are
the tetanus toxin of C. tetani and heat-labile and

heat-stable toxins of enterotoxigenic E. coli.
Toxins encoded by bacteriophage DNA are the
cholera toxins, the diphtheria toxin and the botu-
linum toxin.
84
7
Microbial Infections
Fig. 7.3 Schematic diagram showing mode of action of
exotoxin
Exotoxins are good antigens; they induce the
synthesis
of
protective
antibodies
called
antitoxins. Some of these antitoxins are useful in
the treatment of botulism, tetanus and other
diseases. Exotoxins treated with formaldehyde
or acid or heat can be converted into toxoids.
The toxoids lack toxicity but retain antigenicity.
Hence, these are used in protective vaccines.
Exotoxins
are
some
of
the
most
toxic
substances known. They are highly potent even
in minute amounts. Botulinum toxin is the most
potent one, and it has been estimated that 3 kg of
botulinum toxin can kill all persons in the world.
Similarly, the fatal dose of tetanus toxin for a
human is estimated to be less than 1 |ULg.
Many toxins have a dimeric A–B subunit
structure. The diphtheria toxin, the tetanus toxin,
the cholera toxins and the enterotoxin of E. coli
are examples of exotoxins with an A–B subunit
structure. A is the active subunit that possesses
the toxic activity, and B is the binding subunit
responsible for the binding of exotoxin to speciﬁc
receptors of the membrane of human cells.
These toxins are very speciﬁc in their mecha-
nism of action and act at speciﬁc tissue sites. The
biochemical
targets
of
A–B
toxin
include
ribosomes, transport mechanisms and intracellu-
lar signalling (cyclic adenosine monophosphate,
CAMP; G protein production); all these cause
diarrhoea, loss of neuronal functions or even
death.
Unlike endotoxins, exotoxins have speciﬁc
pharmacological activities and do not produce
fever.
Endotoxins
The term endotoxin was coined in 1893 by
Pfeiffer
to
distinguish
the
class
of
toxic
substances released after lysis of bacteria from
the toxic substances (exotoxins) secreted by
Gram-negative bacteria, but not by Gram-positive
bacteria. They are lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
components of the outer membrane of Gram-
negative bacteria. Unlike exotoxins, these form
an integral part of the cell wall, which are actively
released from the cells. The genes encode the
enzymes that produce the LPS on the bacterial
chromosome, but not on plasmids or bacterio-
phage
DNA,
which
usually
encodes
the
exotoxins. They are heat-stable and released
from the bacterial cell surface by disintegrating
the cell wall. They are weakly antigenic and do
not induce or poorly induce protective antibodies.
Hence, their action is not neutralised by the pro-
tective antibodies. They cannot be toxoided.
Endotoxic shock: Endotoxins at low concentra-
tion induce a protective response, such as
fever, vasodilation and activation of immunity
and
inﬂammatory
response.
However,
endotoxins at very high concentrations, as
seen in the blood of patients with Gram-
negative bacterial sepsis, cause a syndrome
of
endotoxic
shock.
Endotoxic
shock
is
characterised by fever, leucopenia, thrombo-
cytopenia, sudden fall of blood pressure, cir-
culatory collapse and sudden death. This is
because a high endotoxin concentration can
activate the alternative pathway of comple-
ment and cause vasodilation and capillary

leakage, resulting in high fever, hypertension
and shock. It also causes the blood coagulation
pathway activation, leading to disseminated
intravascular coagulation. Endotoxins are not
destroyed by autoclaving; hence infusion of a
sterile solution containing endotoxins can
cause serious illness (Table 7.6).
Table 7.7 summarises the differences between
exotoxins and endotoxins.
Superantigens:
Superantigens
are
a
special
group of toxins. These bind simultaneously
with the T cell receptor and major histocom-
patibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules
on another cell. It leads to nonspeciﬁc activa-
tion of T cells, causing a life-threatening auto-
immune-like response due to the production of
a large amount of interleukins, such as IL-1

drome toxin) of S. aureus and erythrogenic
toxin of type A or C of S. pyogenes.
Genetic Materials
Genes
Made with DNA, a gene is a functional unit that is
transcribed and translated into one functional
mRNA and protein, respectively. All functions
in a body are encoded by different genes that are
usually present in chromosomes. In prokaryotes,
some of the genes are also present in plasmid, for
example, antibiotic resistance genes.

86
7
Microbial Infections
Plasmids
Plasmids are extra-chromosomal DNA materials
and some of them carry speciﬁc genes responsible
for drug resistance or virulence factors. Plasmids
can be transferred from one bacterium to other
bacteria through conjugation. Thus, certain bacte-
rial virulence characteristics may be solely depen-
dent on the presence or absence of the plasmid
inside the cell. E. coli colonisation of intestinal
mucosa through surface antigen and enterotoxin
production by E. coli and S. aureus are the
examples
of
plasmid-borne
virulence
characteristics.
In the modern era, antibiotic resistance is a
major concern in treating bacterial infections.
The main reason for the raise in antibiotic resis-
tance is plasmids carrying genes for antibiotic
resistance. These plasmids can be easily trans-
ferred among bacteria.
Bacteriophages
In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, virulence is due
to the diphtheria toxin. The gene responsible for
diphtheria toxin production is not an integral part
of the Corynebacterium genome but is acquired
through lysogenic conversion from a beta or other
tox + corynephages.
Communicability
The survival and distribution of the parasite in a
community mainly depend on its ability to spread
from one host to another, called communicability.
Virulence and communicability are two different
entities, and they need not be correlating to each
other. In some cases, a highly virulent organism
may kill its host, thereby hindering its existence
in the community.
Generally, intestinal and respiratory infections
have
high
communicability
because
these
pathogens spread among a community through
the secretory materials of the infected individuals.
However, in certain infections, humans act as a
dead-end host, thereby interrupting the communi-
cability of the pathogen. Thus, only a pathogen
strain with high degrees of virulence and commu-
nicability can cause epidemic and pandemic
diseases.
Other Factors
The 50% lethal dose (LD50) is the number of
organisms required to kill half of the hosts. The
50% infectious dose (ID50) is the number of
microbes required to cause infection in half of
the hosts. The infectious dose of an organism
required to cause disease varies among the patho-
genic bacteria.
Infecting dose is the minimum number of
organisms required to cause an infection. It is
one of the most important factors that determine
the
transmission
and
epidemic
potential
of
foodborne pathogens. The lower the infection
dose, the higher is the pathogenicity of a patho-
gen. For example, the E. coli O157:H7 has an
infecting dose of 100 bacteria.
Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease
The infection process involves the sequential
stages
of
(1)
entry
of
the
organisms
and
evasion of the local defences, (2) adherence
to cell surfaces, (3) growth and multiplication of
the
bacteria
at
the
site
of
adherence,
(4) manifestations of disease and (5) termination
of the disease.
Skin,
mucus,
ciliated
epithelium
and
secretions containing antibacterial substances
(e.g. lysozyme) are the natural barriers of the
human and animal hosts that prevent microbial
entry. However, these barriers are sometimes bro-
ken (e.g. a break in the skin, an ulcer in the
intestine, a tumour), thereby allowing the entry
of microbes into the host (Table 7.8). On entry,
the microbes spread through blood circulation to
other sites in the body.
Immunopathogenesis
In certain diseases, the symptoms are caused not
by the organism itself but due to the immune
response to the presence of such organism. For
example, immune complexes deposited in the
glomerulus of the kidney cause post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis. Antibodies produced against
the M proteins of S. pyogenes cross-react with
joint, heart and brain tissues producing disease

manifestations of rheumatic fever. Similarly, the
host immune response is an important cause of
disease symptoms in patients suffering from
syphilis caused by T. pallidum, Lyme disease
caused by Borrelia and other diseases.

Clinical Manifestations
Diseases caused by various pathogenic and
opportunistic pathogens cause a variety of clinical
manifestations in infected human hosts.
Stages of an Infectious Disease
There are four discrete stages of an infectious
disease.
Incubation Period
This denotes the time interval between the entry
of the infective agent and the onset of clinical
manifestations of the disease. During this period,
the infective agent undergoes multiplication after
reaching the selective tissue.
Prodrome Period
It is the time during which only nonspeciﬁc
symptoms of the disease occur.
Specific Illness Period
It is the time during which the characteristic
features of the disease occur.
Recovery Period
It is the time during which the symptoms resolve
and health is restored.
Not all the cases that recover become free of
the organism. Some become chronic carriers and
act as sources of infection for others. Though
some cases may not develop an infection, they
can act as a link in the transmission of infection.
This is called sub-clinical infection.
Termination of an infectious disease may
occur by the resolution or continuation of the
disease. This depends on a complex interaction
of host immunity with pathogens and host
response to treatment with speciﬁc anti-microbial
agents.
Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases
The diseases that can be spread from one person
to another are communicable diseases. Most
microbial infections are communicable diseases.
Three epidemiological terms are often used to
describe infection: endemic, epidemic and pan-
demic. The infection that occurs at a persistent,
usually low level in a certain geographical area is
called endemic. The infection that occurs at a
much higher rate than usual is known as an epi-
demic. Infection that spreads rapidly over large
areas of the world is known as a pandemic.
Geographical Distributions
Geographical
distribution
of
the
infections,
including bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic,
depends on many factors, including (1) the pres-
ence of vectors for the transmission of disease,
(2) co-factors facilitating the transmission of dis-
ease and (3) the presence of a susceptible

population in the particular area. For example, the
presence of suitable arthropod vectors for a par-
ticular virus in large numbers increases the risk of
a high prevalence of that viral disease in that
community.
88
7
Microbial Infections
The microbial infections in a community
may occur as an (1) outbreak, (2) endemic, (3) epi-
demic, or (4) pandemic. These terms only denote
the spread of infection and are not a measure to
determine the virulence or pathogenicity of a
pathogen. The outbreak of a disease usually
occurs from a common source, for example,
infected food, and is seen only in clusters of
people. The World Health Organization (WHO)
in its Disease Outbreak News (DONs) monitors
and provides information on outbreaks globally.
Some of the recent outbreaks include the Lassa
fever in Great Britain, UK, and the Nipah virus in
Kerala, India.
Endemics (Greek éndēm(os), where én means
“in or within” and dēm(os) means “people”) are
diseases that are conﬁned to a particular geo-
graphical location. An outbreak turns to endemic
when it spreads from a cluster to the entire popu-
lation of a region. Most of the parasitic infections
like malaria are considered endemic in tropical
regions.
Epidemics of infection, in contrast, occur in
large geographical areas. An epidemic usually
occurs due to the introduction of a new strain of
virus, parasite or bacteria into an immunologi-
cally susceptible population. Some of the notable
epidemics are the H1N1 inﬂuenza epidemic in the
USA, MERS in the Middle East, the Lassa fever
in Mali and Ebola in West Africa.
Pandemics are usually worldwide epidemics
resulting from the introduction of a new virus, for
example, the HIV. The COVID-19 pandemic
occurred due to the introduction of new strains
of coronavirus.
Microbial
diseases
also
show
seasonal
differences; for example, enteric viruses are
more prevalent in the summer due to poor
hygiene and the use of contaminated water
because of a shortage of water supply. Similarly,
respiratory viruses are more prevalent during
winter due to overcrowding, which facilitates
the spread of viruses.
Events like climate change, urbanisation and
deforestation have nearly dissolved the wildlife-
human boundaries. It has allowed pathogen
spillovers and its spread to newer geographical
regions. As a single contributing factor, climate
change has triggered a cascade of climate adapta-
tion events in the pathogen that in turn is
inﬂuencing
the
host-pathogen-transmission
triangle. Vector-borne diseases like malaria and
dengue are reportedly spreading to European
regions that are becoming warmer and turning
into global diseases of concern. Spillovers of
new, emerging and re-emerging viruses have
become more frequent. For example, the new
SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought a pandemic
after spillover from bats.
Reservoir of Infection
Infected humans are usual reservoirs of viruses.
They serve as a source of infection for other
susceptible hosts. It includes sexually transmitted
diseases, polio, measles, mumps, streptococcal
infection and so on. Because humans are the
sole reservoir for these infections, eradication of
the disease from the last reservoir can completely
eradicate the disease itself. Eradication of small-
pox is an example of such an event.
For many other diseases, animals act as
reservoirs. Pathogens transmitted from these ani-
mal reservoirs to humans are called zoonotic
diseases; for example, rabies is a zoonotic viral
disease, and the infection is transmitted from
infected dogs, bats, foxes, cats and so on to
humans. More than 200 pathogens are known to
be zoonotic. It is estimated that 60% of emerging
infectious diseases are zoonotic. Recent viral
outbreaks like MERS, SARS, Ebola, Lassa,
Nipah and the recent COVID-19 pandemic have
a zoonotic origin.
Mosquitoes, ticks and sand ﬂies are arthropods
that act as vectors for transmission of malaria,
lymphatic
ﬁlariasis,
togaviruses,
ﬂaviviruses,
bunyaviruses and reoviruses. Some important
vector-borne diseases are presented in Table 7.2.

In 2017, the WHO launched the “Global Vector
Control Response (GVCR) 2017–2030” to pro-
vide strategic guidance to countries for urgent
strengthening
of
vector
control
to
prevent
diseases and respond to outbreaks.
Infection
89
Emerging and Re-emerging Infections
The term “emerging and re-emerging diseases”
was coined in 2000 by the Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg. “Emerging infectious diseases” are
diseases of infectious origin whose incidence in
humans has increased in the past two decades or
threatens to increase in the near future. Emerging
infectious diseases were those that, like AIDS and
Ebola, were previously unknown to have afﬂicted
humans. Re-emerging diseases, such as cholera
and plague, were familiar scourges whose inci-
dence was rising or whose geographical range
was expanding. The WHO has added a few
more clauses to describe these two categories:
Emerging
infectious
diseases
(EIDs)
are
diseases that are newly recognised, newly
introduced or newly evolved, or that have
recently and rapidly changed in incidence or
expanded their geographical, host or vector

range (WHO/FAO/OIE 2004). They also
include diseases that have affected a given
region in the past, declined over time or were
controlled, but again resurfaced in growing
numbers (WHO 2014).
Re-emerging diseases are diseases that reappear
after they have been on a signiﬁcant decline.
Re-emergence may happen because of a
breakdown in public health measures for
diseases that were once under control. They
can also happen when new strains of known
disease-causing organisms appear. Human
behaviour affects re-emergence. For example,
overuse of antibiotics has led to disease-
causing
organisms
that
are
resistant
to
medicines. It has allowed a return of diseases
that once were treatable and controllable.
Re-emerging diseases include malaria, tuber-
culosis, cholera, pertussis, inﬂuenza, pneumo-
coccal disease and gonorrhoea.
Table 7.9 provides a list of emerging and
re-emerging diseases. A study revealed that
60.3% of EIDs infecting humans between 1940
and 2004 were zoonotic with wildlife playing a
great role, and one in ﬁve was transmitted by
invertebrate vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks

and midges. A WHO-endorsed expert committee
(WHO
2018–2019)
has
updated
the
list
(Table 7.10) of current and future priority
emerging diseases based on seven criteria. This
list has been recently updated again with the
addition of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) that recently hit the world (WHO
2020b).

Diagnostic Methods in Microbial
Infections
8
Laboratory diagnosis of an infectious disease is
one of the most important functions of Medical/
Clinical microbiology and forms an integral part
of this speciality. In a patient suspected of
suffering from an infection, the specimen is
obtained from the individual and sent to the
microbiology laboratory to ascertain the causative
organism. After various tests and procedures, a
positive or negative report is sent to the treating
clinician, conﬁrming or disproving the initial
diagnosis. In some cases, particularly bacterial
infections, an antimicrobial sensitivity proﬁle is
also sent along with the identity of the organisms,
which helps the clinician in instituting pathogen-
directed antimicrobial therapy.
The Diagnostic Principles
Identifying a microbe in a patient’s specimen can
be done in three broad manners. These include
(1) visualisation of the microbe or demonstration
of microbial product or isolation of the microbe in
pure form (as per Koch’s Postulates) followed by
identiﬁcation, (2) detection of patient’s immune
response by detection of antibodies (most com-
mon) or patient’s immune defence system and
(3) ampliﬁcation of pathogen’s nucleic acid.
In practice, the following procedures are
employed and selected as per the requirement
and laboratory capacity:

Appropriate Specimen Collection
and Transport
The pre-analytical phase of sample collection and
its transport plays a crucial role in the test out-
come since a sample that is not suitable can result
in misleading test results. The specimen should
reﬂect the infection process and is commonly
obtained from the lesion’s principal site. An ade-
quate amount of sample is collected since the
number of microorganisms may be scanty in the
sample collected. Normally, any organism in a
specimen collected from a normally sterile site
is reﬂective of the infection; the same does not
hold when samples are taken from areas such as
skin, mouth and throat, where commensal ﬂora
are also present. In the latter cases, the area should
be appropriately cleaned before sample collec-
tion, or some invasive procedure can be used to

prevent contamination with unwanted ﬂora. Thus,
a good idea about the nature of ﬂora from the
collection site is necessary for the correct inter-
pretation of results. All specimens are collected in
sterile containers and transported to the laboratory
in the quickest possible time. In case of delay in
transport or processing, specimens are stored at
4–8 C in a refrigerator. Transport media in tubes
or vials are commercially available, which are
used when shipping the specimen to laboratories
situated at a distance and may require a few hours
for transport.

Diagnostic Methods in Microbial Infections
Microscopy
Light microscopy and ﬂuorescent microscopy
play an important role as a ﬁrst step in the initial
examination of the specimen. By microscopy, we
get a preliminary idea about the nature of the
infective organism and the presence of other
host-derived cells like leucocytes.
Fig. 8.1 Principle of Gram
staining
Unstained direct examination of the wet prep-
aration of the sample helps detect bacterial motil-
ity, identify protozoan or helminthic parasites and
conﬁrm fungal structures.
Stained preparation of the sample is a general
procedure
primarily
used
for
bacteria
and
useful for other groups of organisms. A stain is
a dye that is applied to a sample for better
visualisation of microorganisms. The most com-
mon stain used in microbiology is the Gram
stain (Fig. 8.1), which helps us to distinguish
between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-
teria and gives us an idea about the morphology,
whether cocci or bacilli. Acid-fast stain is used for
Mycobacterium,
while
other
stains
such
as
Giemsa and Trichrome are used for various
other specimens to visualise other groups of
organisms.
Fluorescent staining (Fig. 8.2) is used for
directly staining the sample with mono- or poly-
clonal antibodies tagged with a ﬂuorescent dye. It
provides a rapid and speciﬁc means of detecting

the microorganism or its antigen. Microscopy
remains the gold standard for identifying most
of the protozoan parasites and helminths. The
important stains used are given in Table 8.1.

Cultivation (Culture) of Microorganisms
The microorganisms present in a specimen need
to be grown by some means so that proper
identiﬁcation can be done. Bacteria and fungi
grow on artiﬁcial media, while viruses and bacte-
ria such as Chlamydia and Rickettsia can only be
grown inside cells in tissue culture. Both liquids
and solid artiﬁcial culture media are widely used.
While liquid culture is very sensitive when very
few organisms are present in a specimen, solid
media are necessary for growing discrete colonies
in pure form from a specimen and are also helpful
for counting the number of bacteria present in a

sample expressed as colony-forming units/ml.
This is because a colony of microorganisms
contains thousands of cells derived from a single
cell that has been cultured. There is no single
medium capable of growing all the bacteria,
hence judicious use should be made in selecting
the media that can support the growth of probable
organisms present in a particular specimen. Incu-
bation at 37 C for 48–72 h is sufﬁcient for most
bacteria’s visible growth. For fungi, a lower tem-
perature (27 C) and a more prolonged incubation
period are generally needed except for yeasts and
yeast-like fungi, which can grow at 37
C
(Fig. 8.3).

Most viruses and a few bacteria can only be
grown in viable cells derived from humans or
animals.
This
technique
involves
laboratory
expertise and is time-consuming and hence not
frequently used in many laboratories. Cultivation
for
parasites
is
not
performed
in
routine
laboratories, except occasionally for leishmania,
trypanosome and trichomonas. Egg hatching
technique to grow the larval form for deﬁnitive
identiﬁcation of a helminth parasite can also be
undertaken.
Identification of Culture-Grown Microbe
Bacteria or fungi grown in a culture medium are
further identiﬁed to the genus and, in many
instances, to the species level by using a battery
of phenotypic characteristics. These include,
among others, growth conditions such as temper-
ature, time and atmospheric requirements; colo-
nial appearance; staining properties; biochemical
reactions using various substrates; and antigenic
properties. The polymerase chain reaction can
also be performed on the culture material to
amplify the DNA or RNA.
Filamentous fungi are principally identiﬁed
based on colony characters and microscopic mor-
phological features. Virus identiﬁcation in tissue
culture relies on the changes in the cells brought
about by the viral growth (cytopathic effects)
(Fig. 8.4) along with the detection of viral
antigens and/or viral nucleic acid by ampliﬁcation
techniques.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
A logical step after isolating the bacterial patho-
gen from a patient’s sample is to ﬁnd out the
sensitivity of the isolate to the antibiotics that
can be used for targeted therapy of the infection.
Traditionally,
this
is
done
with
antibiotic-
impregnated discs containing a ﬁxed concentra-
tion of the drug and applied to a lawn culture of
the bacteria. The zone of inhibition of bacterial
growth around the disc gives an idea of whether
the particular isolate is sensitive or resistant to the
antibiotic. This is the principle of the disc diffu-
sion technique (Fig. 8.5).
A more accurate method is to determine the
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) by
breakpoint dilution. MIC is carried out either on a
solid medium or more often in a liquid medium or
by using the Epsilometer (E) test. MIC determi-
nation is also an integral part of automated
systems where simultaneous identiﬁcation and
sensitivity proﬁle are available after the requisite
hours
of
incubation.
Although
the
above
techniques are standardised for many yeast and
yeast-like fungi, the same is not available for
many ﬁlamentous fungi. Antiviral susceptibility
testing may be done by phenotypic methods such
as plaque reduction, dye uptake or enzyme
immune assays, but it is not suitable for most
routine laboratories. Similarly, except for a few
protozoan parasites like malaria, phenotypic
methods for drug sensitivity testing are lacking.
In the last two to three decades, molecular
testing to determine the expression of drug resis-
tance gene/s is gaining steady popularity and
gradually replacing the phenotypic method. This
method can be used for bacteria, viruses, parasites
or fungi, and in many instances, it may be done
directly with the patient’s sample.
Animal Pathogenicity Tests
Laboratory animals have an important role in
the
ﬁelds
of
infectious
and
non-infectious
diseases. In microbiology, animal inoculation of
a patient’s sample to isolate the causative agents
has been most commonly done for viruses, some
bacteria like tubercle bacilli and protozoan
parasites like toxoplasma. Apart from diagnostic
use, animal studies give invaluable information
on the pathogenesis and immune response to
microorganisms. They have played a pivotal role
in vaccine development. Small animals such as
monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice
and rats are commonly used for diagnostic
purposes. Depending on the likely pathogen, the

specimen can be inoculated through various
routes such as intra-peritoneal, intra-cerebral and
subcutaneous. In most instances, the animal needs
to be sacriﬁced to study the internal organs and
detect the pathogen. As a result of stringent ethi-
cal restrictions on animal use and the develop-
ment of newer and more sensitive methods,
animal inoculation purely for the diagnosis of
infection is no longer in use.

Serological Tests
Detection of Antibodies
Antibody detection in a patient’s body ﬂuids, par-
ticularly serum, is commonly practised. It gives
indirect proof of infection, which may or may not
indicate a disease state since even in asymptomatic
infection, antibody levels may be increased. Most
of the tests available can detect the IgG fraction,
which in many cases is retrospective since they
appear after about 2–4 weeks of infection. On the
other hand, IgM appears after 7–10 days and is a
better indicator of acute infection. The dictum of a
serological test is to look for rising titre, that is, a
fourfold or more rise in antibody titre between
acute and convalescent sera collected 3–4 weeks
apart. However, since it cannot be followed in
actual practice, a single serum sample is com-
monly tested and either high IgG or the presence
of IgM/IgA/IgE is taken as a diagnostic proof of
the infection process.
Enzyme immune assay in various formats is
the most popular procedure used in the majority
of laboratories. ELISA is useful for testing a large
number of samples at a time Rapid immunochro-
matographic tests are also often used as a point-
of-care (POC) test to give immediate results.
Chemiluminescence is another rapid method for
antibody testing. Here luminol and derivatives of
isoluminol are used as chemiluminescent labels.
It is highly speciﬁc and considered to be more
sensitive compared to ELISA. The indirect ﬂuo-
rescence antibody (IFA) test was once quite
popular, but EIA has largely replaced it. This is
because of the ease of performance of the test,
quick
turnaround
time
and
freedom
from
observer’s subjective interpretation. However,

IFA remains the standard test in certain instances
like chlamydial infections.
The Diagnostic Principles
97
Detection of Antigens
In many instances, it is easier to detect the micro-
bial antigen in the patient’s sample, and it is both
a quick and a speciﬁc method. Polyclonal or
preferably monoclonal antibodies tagged with a
ﬂuorescent dye or an enzyme can be used to
detect the antigen by direct ﬂuorescent technique
or enzyme immune assay.
Rapid
point-of-care
immunochroma-
tography tests based on enzyme immune assay
are also available. Other methods for antigen
detection include the latex agglutination test and
co-agglutination test, where the antibody is
coated on latex particles or the Cowan strain of
Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Monoclonal
antibodies used in the test format can identify
species and may even be used for strain separa-
tion in the same species based on antigenic struc-
ture. Antigen testing can provide quick results,
but these tests lack sensitivity, particularly if
the antigen concentration is low. Antigen tests
are widely used for capsular antigen detection
for
Streptococcus
pneumoniae,
Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae type b and Cryptococcus neoformans
in CSF; Rotavirus, Crptosporidium, Giardia and
Entamoeba histolytica in stool; and hepatitis B
virus and HIV antigens in the blood.
Fig. 8.6 Tuberculin test
Assessment of Cell-Mediated Immune
System
A few tests can help in understanding the status of
the body’s immune system and can be of help in
diagnosis as well. The intradermal tests for
diagnosing infectious diseases detect mainly the
Type IV hypersensitivity reaction or Delayed-
Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) to the injected
antigens (exception: Casoni’s test for hydatid dis-
ease is Type I hypersensitivity reaction). Intrader-
mal tests for detecting DTH are read at 48–72 h
with some exceptions like the Lepromin test.
While taking the reading, the induration size is
more important than erythema. Although many
such tests have been described, only the Tubercu-
lin test (Fig. 8.6) is routinely performed in many
countries. In vitro immune functional assay for
tuberculosis in the form of Interferon-Gamma
Release Assays (IGRAs) has replaced the tuber-
culin test in many countries to diagnose latent
tuberculosis.

Diagnostic Methods in Microbial Infections
Recent Approaches in Diagnostic
Microbiology
Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT)
Developed at the turn of the last century, NAAT
has revolutionised the ﬁeld of microbiology with
its wide applications. These include polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), real-time polymerase chain
reaction (real-time PCR), ligase chain reaction
(LCR),
transcription-mediated
ampliﬁcation
(TMA), nucleic acid sequence-based ampliﬁca-
tion (NASBA), strand displacement ampliﬁcation
(SDA) and so on.
The conventional polymerase chain reaction
where the ampliﬁed DNA is visualised by gel
electrophoresis is being rapidly replaced with
real-time PCR in diagnostic microbiology. Real-
time PCR gives a picture of the ampliﬁcation
process in real time, and there is no need for
post-ampliﬁcation
electrophoresis,
which
eliminates contamination. The copy number of
nucleic acid can also be determined if a set of
standards with known copy numbers is included,
which gets ampliﬁed along with the test sample
(quantitative PCR, qPCR).

Ghosal)
In multiplex PCR, primers for more than one
pathogen can be included in the test system,
which allows to group the tests according to the
disease syndromes. For example, the commercial
system of Bioﬁre Film Array system from
bioMerieux company has got respiratory, gastro-
intestinal,
blood
culture
and
meningitis-
encephalitis panels which can detect 20–25
pathogens in each panel. This helps the clinician
to take a syndromic approach and order the tests
accordingly. For details of these other techniques,
refer to Chap. 9.
Most of the NAATs require sample extraction
and processing before detection. It requires labo-
ratory set-up, consumables and experts to handle
the infectious agent safely and ensure efﬁcient
extraction. However, many new tools have
recently come up that can give results directly
without processing the sample. One such example
is GeneXpert® (Fig. 8.7) System (developed by
Cephid), which has automated entire molecular
diagnostics. The process known as CB-NAAT
uses PCR reaction reagents in a cartridge and
only requires direct loading of the sample on
them. The machine automatically performs the
extraction to results without manual intervention.

It effectively reduces safety concerns that arise
from the human handling of infectious agents.
Recent Approaches in Diagnostic Microbiology
99
Sequencing
Sequencing of a gene has established itself as a
powerful diagnostic tool where other methods
have given inconclusive results. Sequencing of
ribosomal DNA using panfungal primers is now
the gold standard for the identiﬁcation of fungi.
DNA sequencing can also be used for precise
species identiﬁcation and is widely used in bacte-
rial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogen identiﬁ-
cation and strain differentiation.
Automated Methods
Automated methods are now available, which
take only hours for the characterisation of
isolates. These include the detection of speciﬁc
enzymes, toxins, antigens or metabolic end
products. Automated systems for bacterial identi-
ﬁcation include Phoenix bacterial identiﬁcation
system (BD biosciences), MALDI-TOF (Matrix-
assisted
laser
desorption/ionisation
time-of-
ﬂight),
VITEK-2
bacterial
identiﬁcation,
MicroScan WalkAway system and so on. The
cartridge-based GeneXpert is also an automated
nucleic
acid
ampliﬁcation
process.
These
methods have got more added advantages than
the conventional methods in the aspect of contin-
uous monitoring, more sensitive, rapid and fewer
chances of contamination. The latest platform of
Matrix Associated Laser Desorption/Ionisation
Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) is increasingly
being used for the identiﬁcation of the bacteria,
yeast and also to some extent moulds.
Detection of Metabolites
Microbial
metabolites
are
deﬁned
as
the
intermediate products of the metabolism of
microorganisms. Metabolites can be grouped
into primary and secondary metabolites. Primary
metabolites are essential for the proper growth
of
microorganisms.
Examples
of
primary
metabolites are ethanol, lactic acid and certain
amino acids. Secondary metabolites have no role
in development, growth and reproduction. They
are produced during the stationary phase of
growth.
Examples
of
secondary
metabolites
include antibiotics, mycotoxins and so on. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Mass
spectrometry (MS), Gas chromatography (GC)
and Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to
mass spectrometry (MS) are the frequently used
methods for the detection of metabolites.
Immunochromatographic Tests
Lateral
ﬂow
immunochromatographic
tests
(ICTs) are the commonly used rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) for the detection of infectious diseases.
In contrast to complex molecular tools and
technologies that require clinical establishments
for diagnosis, such ICTs offer portability and are
perfect as a point-of-care (POC) test. For the
detection of pathogens, it contains biomarkers
(antigen) for the pathogens incorporated on a
paper strip. When a sample containing the patho-
gen is placed on the paper, it develops lines
corresponding to the binding of the antibody
(present in the sample) and the biomarker
indicating the presence of the particular antigen
or antibody. Such tests are easy to interpret and do
not require any technical expertise.

Genomics, Proteomics and Molecular
Biology in Microbiology

The science of microbiology had relied for a long
time on phenotypic markers such as culture, mor-
phology, biochemical and serological properties
of the microbes to characterise them. But it was
realised early that gaps existed in the knowledge
about the biology of these organisms and many
unresolved issues remained in the taxonomy,
identiﬁcation, pathogenesis and so on. The dis-
covery of the structure and ﬁner details of DNA in
the 1950s heralded the application of DNA-based
studies of microorganisms. Phenotypic studies
started getting supplemented by genotypic stud-
ies, which brought about a revolution in our
knowledge about microbes. In recent times, the
study of the proteins encoded by the genes has
opened up a new ﬁeld of proteomics with diverse
applications.
From discovering DNA structure and the
genetic engineering strategies, science has never
looked back and opened a new avenue where the
gene structure and function played a signiﬁcant
role in technological advancements. The recent
development and applications of genomics, pro-
teomics and molecular biology have contributed
immensely to Medical Microbiology, especially
in diagnostic microbiology.
Genomics
DNA is the building block of the genes in a living
being.
The
set
of
genes
constitutes
the
chromosome and the whole framework forms
the genome. Thus the genome is the whole of
the genetic material of the organism, or, in other
words, the complete set of genes is designated as
the genome. The term was ﬁrst coined by Hans
Winkler in 1920 from the words gene and chro-
mosome. The introduction of the chain termina-
tion method to sequence DNA in 1977 by
Frederick Sanger followed by whole genome
sequencing technologies paved the way for the
modern era of genomics.

Technologies
Sanger chain termination method and Maxam-
Gilbert Sequencing methods were developed in
the
1970s
but
could
sequence
only
small
fragments and were manual methods. Thus
Sanger method has a read length of only
400–900 base pairs (bp). The Shotgun approach
which came soon after was useful to study the
sequence of a larger piece of DNA (more than
1000 bp) by breaking up the DNA into small
fragments, followed by sequencing each piece
separately.
Pyrosequencing
technology
was
described in 1993 and has a capacity to sequence
up to 700 bp. Newer automated methods of
sequencing started appearing in 1990s and these
commercial sequencers have established their
places in the twenty-ﬁrst century. They are not
only automated but also allow the entire genome

to be sequenced (Whole Genome Sequencing,
WGS) in one go and popularly they are known
as “next-generation” or “second generation”
sequencers. Some of these technologies such as
Single
molecule
real-time
sequencing
and
Nanopore DNA sequencing are referred to as
long-read sequencers and have read lengths of
20,000 nucleotides or more, with average read
lengths of 5 kb. They are also known as “third
generation” sequencing methods. In contrast, a
large
number
of
short-read
commercial
sequencers based on different technologies are
available. These include, among others, Illumina
dye sequencing, SOLiD sequencing by ligation,
DNA nanoball sequencing, ion semiconductor
sequencing and so on. Efforts are continuing to
develop
faster,
more
high-throughput
technologies.

Genomics, Proteomics and Molecular Biology in Microbiology
Applications
The era of microbe sequencing started with
bacteriophages in 1976. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae
was the ﬁrst pathogenic microorganism which
was fully sequenced in 1995. Since then, a large
number of bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites
have been studied and their whole genome
sequence is known. However, although all the
genes of these organisms have been identiﬁed,
the functions of many of them still remain
unknown or not annotated. The applications of
genomic studies can be grouped as follows:
Identification of the Pathogen
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is one of the
deﬁnitive
methods
for
strain
identiﬁcation.
Although unlikely to replace the conventional
methods or MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted Laser
Desorption/Ionisation
Time-of-Flight)
in
this
aspect, WGS is most useful for those organisms
which are difﬁcult to diagnose by routine
methods.
At
present,
the
identiﬁcation
of
organisms by PCR ampliﬁcation of gene/s or
16S rDNA sequencing is nothing but the product
of genomic studies of organisms.
Identification Directly from Sample
and Metagenomic
Metagenomics is a methodology where all the
DNA in a given sample is sequenced. Using
bioinformatics
tools,
the
non-pathogenic
organisms and human DNA are excluded and
the pathogenic DNA is identiﬁed. Samples like
urine or CSF taken from normally sterile sites will
give better results than from a sample with large
microbiota like stool. Identiﬁcation is highly
accurate and results can be obtained even if few
organisms are present.
Detection of Resistance to Antibiotics
Resistance to certain antibiotics can be predicted
by WGS by analysis of the data. Mutations which
are responsible for rifampicin resistance can also
be detected. The currently used methods may be
more of practical use for detecting resistance to
common bacteria. Nevertheless WGS may help in
detecting resistance to slowly growing organisms
or for cases where phenotypic methods are not
standardised.
Diagnostic Test Development
New diagnostic tests for existing and novel
pathogens have been developed using sequencing
tools. The genome sequences are also useful for
the identiﬁcation of targets for the development of
diagnostic PCR and serological tests.
Detection of Virulence Factors
Apart from being able to detect antimicrobial
resistance mentioned above, genome data may
also be useful for detecting toxins of organisms
and also new ones which may not be detectable
by existing methods.
Epidemiological Typing of Strains
Restriction
fragment
length
polymorphism,
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis and so on are the
investigative methods commonly used for epide-
miological tracking of strains during outbreaks or
epidemics. But all these methods have varying
resolution power and often do not give reproduc-
ible results. WGS has much higher discriminatory

power and has the potential to replace the
traditional methods in the not too distant future.
It can be considered the ideal typing method since
it can identify a single genome change between
isolates. Many studies have employed single
nucleotide polymorphism for strain differentia-
tion. WGS can also help in mapping the route of
transmission and how the pathogen spread during
an epidemic.
Proteomics
103
Proteomics
The term proteome was ﬁrst coined in 1994 by
Wilkins and his co-workers to describe the “PRO-
Tein complement expressed by a genOME”. It is
the set of all proteins expressed by the genome
and
the
study
of
proteome
is
known
as
proteomics.
Scopes of Proteomics
It has wide-ranging scope encompassing every-
thing related to proteins. These include annotation
of genomes, protein expression, protein function,
modiﬁcations
of
proteins
after
translation,
localisation of proteins and interaction between
proteins. Towards this end, proteomics is divided
into the following three subdivisions:
1. Protein
expression
proteomics:
Here
protein expression of the whole proteome
between samples can be compared which can
identify new proteins or pathogen-speciﬁc
proteins.
2. Structural proteomics: It is also known as the
“cell map” where all the proteins of a cell are
identiﬁed, along with their compartmenta-
lisation or location and their interaction with
each other.
3. Functional proteomics: It involves the study
and characterisation of a selected group of
proteins which can give information about
the pathogenesis of a disease, signalling of
proteins and protein-drug interactions.
Tools for Proteomics
The present-day proteomic analysis essentially
uses two methods. In the “bottom-up” method,
short peptides generated by protein fragmentation
are analysed for proteome identiﬁcation, while
in the “top-down” method whole protein is
analysed. Essentially, in the ﬁrst approach, the
protein is ﬁrst digested into peptides with
enzymes, followed by their separation by liquid
chromatography. Alternatively, in gel-based tech-
nology, the proteins are ﬁrst separated by gel
electrophoresis, followed by enzymatic digestion.
The ﬁnal step involves the use of mass spectrom-
etry which analyses the peptide fragments and
produces the mass spectroscopy spectrum. The
data is then studied using various database search
engines which give the qualitative identity of the
proteome. In the “top down” approach, proteo-
lytic methods are not used and it is mainly useful
for puriﬁed proteins. The third approach is a
quantitative
method
where
amino
acids
or
peptides are either labelled or non-labelled to
ﬁnd out the relative abundance of the proteins in
a sample.
Applications in Microbiology
Although still in its early stages, proteomics has
made its inroads in microbiology. The following
are some of its important applications.
Elucidation of Host–Pathogen Interaction
Proteomic analysis can reveal important informa-
tion regarding host and pathogen interaction and
the microbe expressed proteins involved in the
pathogenesis can be clearly identiﬁed. It has
been found that microbial proteins interact with
host proteins and alter the normal cellular
process.
Pathogen Identification
Proteomic analysis has arrived in a big way
into
the
identiﬁcation
of
a
pathogen
from

culture material or even a clinical sample by
the use of Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/
Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy
(MALDI-TOF MS). It is now available in many
diagnostic laboratories around the world, includ-
ing in India. Apart from identifying organisms at
the species level, it can also help in strain differ-
entiation. In this method, the protein is extracted
from the sample and mixed with the matrix
(an energy absorbent organic compound) on a
target plate. The sample within the matrix is
subjected to short laser pulses and desorption
and ionisation produces an ionic state and the
ions get separated on the basis of their mass-to-
charge (m/z) ratio. These ions reach the detector at
the time-of-ﬂight tube. The m/z ratio of an ion is
measured by determining the time required for it
to travel the length of the ﬂight tube. As a result, a
characteristic spectrum is produced called peptide
mass ﬁngerprint. Final identiﬁcation of the organ-
ism is done by comparing the ﬁngerprint with the
existing databases. It has found application in
bacterial, fungal and viral identiﬁcation directly
from a sample. Apart from identiﬁcation, this
technique has also been employed to detect anti-
microbial resistance.

Development of Vaccines
Protective antigens can be identiﬁed using prote-
ome analysis and bioinformatics tools which can
be used for future vaccine development.
Drug Development
Another area of potential use is designing of
appropriate antibiotics for resistant organisms.
The resistance mechanism can be studied and
the targets can be identiﬁed and a response library
can be created for future drug development.
In essence, proteomics and genomics have
entered medical microbiology in a big way and
are likely to make rapid progress in the future.
These approaches may ultimately pave the way
for personalised medicine or individual patient-
centric treatment of infectious diseases.
Molecular Biology
The use of molecular tools and techniques in the
diagnostic
laboratory
has
been
remarkably
adopted with applications ranging from genetic
testing, epidemiologic studies, tissue typing, in
situ hybridisation, forensics, parentage testing
and detection, identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of
microorganisms for disease diagnosis.
Molecular techniques used in microbiological
diagnosis include nucleic acid ampliﬁcation,
DNA sequencing and typing, direct molecular
probe techniques (in situ hybridisation) and
nucleic acid quantiﬁcation. Across the platforms,
several commercially available IVD certiﬁed
reagents, equipment and test kits are now avail-
able that have helped clinicians in giving more
evidence-based patient care. It has almost swept
away previous generation methodologies that
were primarily manual and dependent on bio-
chemical and morphological observations. Rapid
growth in precision medicine, cell and gene ther-
apy and its translation into modern healthcare
have necessitated functional molecular testing
where devices have been developed to analyse
large genomes, analyse, interpret and maintain
data for accurate and timely assessment. Routine
clinical testing, disease diagnostics and Specialty
tests such as genetics, immunology, oncology and
endocrinology are now reported based on genetic
markers and gene functions. The rapid develop-
ment of AI has introduced machine dependencies
capable of running the service to reporting with
minimal manual interventions.

also extended to medical microbiology, with most

Nucleic Acid Probes
Nucleic acid probes, otherwise known as DNA
probes, are segments of DNA and RNA labelled
with radioisotopes or enzymes that can hybridise
to
complementary
nucleic
acids
with
high
speciﬁcity.
DNA probes have practical value because
they can detect speciﬁc nucleotide sequences in
unknown samples. The probes carry reporter
particles, such as radioactive labels, which are
isotopes that emit radiation, or luminescent labels,
which give off visible light. Reactions can be
exposed by setting the photographic ﬁlm in con-
tact with the test reaction. Fluorescent probes
consist of dyes that can be seen with ultraviolet
light. Probes can be used in a broad range of
analytic procedures.
Two diverse nucleic acids can infuse by coa-
lescing
at
their
integral
sites.
All
distinct
combinations
are
probable:
single-stranded
DNA can coalesce with other single-stranded
DNA or RNA, and RNA can incorporate with
other RNA. This property forms the basis of
specially
formulated
oligonucleotide
tracers
called gene probes.
Applications of DNA probes
DNA probes are non-ampliﬁed methods; they
only
detect
DNA
in
specimens
without
amplifying the same (Fig. 9.1). Many DNA
probes have been developed and used in clinical
microbiology.
They are used to directly detect microbes in
clinical specimens (e.g. Mycobacterium tubercu-
losis,
Streptococcus
pyogenes,
Candida
albicans). They are also used for (1) identiﬁcation
of culture isolates, (2) strain identiﬁcation for
epidemiological typing, (3) identiﬁcation of viru-
lence factors of microbial agents and (4) identiﬁ-
cation of toxins (e.g. diphtheria toxin).
Some regions of human DNA exhibit substan-
tial variability in the distribution of restriction
sites. This variability is termed restriction frag-
ment length polymorphism (FLP). Oligonucle-
otide probes that hybridise with RFLP DNA
fragments can be used to trace DNA from a
small sample to its human donor. Thus, the tech-
nique is valuable to forensic science. RFLP
applications in medicine include identifying
genetic regions closely linked to human genes
with dysfunctions coupled to genetic disease.
This
information
is
valuable
in
genetic
counselling.
Blotting Techniques
Blotting is a well-established technique in molec-
ular biology to detect speciﬁc biomolecules
(DNA, RNA or protein) from a complex mixture
after separating it in a gel matrix following gel
electrophoresis. The separated biomolecules are

transferred on an inert membrane, the process
called blotting, and then a biomolecule is located
by using a labelled probe speciﬁc to the biomole-
cule. Initially, the radiolabelling of probes was
followed that later mostly shifted to ﬂuorescent
and chemiluminescent technologies. As such,
blotting is adjunct to gel electrophoresis, and the
result is dependent on the resolution ability of the
gel electrophoresis.
106

Genomics, Proteomics and Molecular Biology in Microbiology
Fig. 9.1 DNA probes
Depending on the biomolecules to be blotted
and identiﬁed, blotting methods are classiﬁed into
the following three types:
Southern Blotting
Developed by Edwin M. Southern in 1975, it
refers to detecting speciﬁc DNA in a mixture of
DNA. DNA mixtures separated in agarose gel
electrophoresis are transferred on the nitrocellu-
lose membrane and then detected using a DNA
probe. The probe being speciﬁc to the interest
hybridises with the DNA of interest and produces
a signal that could be visualised. The application
of Southern blotting includes the identiﬁcation of
one or more restriction fragments that contain a
gene or other DNA sequence of interest and in the

detection of RFLPs used in the construction of
genomic maps.
Molecular Biology
107
Northern Blotting
It applies to RNA detection wherein the process
remains the same as Southern blotting. It has
found
potential
application
in
determining
expression patterns of genes between tissues,
organs,
developmental
stages,
environmental
stress levels and pathogen infection.
Western Blotting
It refers to the detection of protein. In this, a
mixture of proteins separated in Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis is transferred on a nitrocellu-
lose membrane. The desired protein is detected by
using labelled antibodies speciﬁc to the protein
(Fig. 9.2).
DNA Amplification Techniques
The chain reaction was the ﬁrst technique which
became popular in a short time. Apart from PCR,
there are similar techniques which are used in
various settings.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
In 1983, Kary Mullis developed a new technique
that made it possible to synthesise large quantities
of a DNA fragment without cloning it. This
technique is called polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and has great practical importance and
impact on biotechnology. This technique can pre-
pare
large
quantities
of
a
particular
DNA
sequence.
Fig. 9.2 Western blotting
In PCR, oligonucleotide sequences identical to
those ﬂanking the targeted sequence are ﬁrst
synthesised. These synthetic oligonucleotides
are usually about 20 nucleotides long and serve
as primers for DNA synthesis. Pieces ranging in
size from less than 100 bp to several 1000 bp in
length can be ampliﬁed, and only 10–100 pmol
primer is required. The concentration of target
DNA can be as low as 10–15 mL.
The reaction mix for PCR contains (1) the
target DNA, (2) a substantial excess of the desired
primers, (3) a thermostable DNA polymerase and
(4) four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Only
DNA polymerases that can function at high
temperatures can be employed in the PCR tech-
nique. The two popular enzymes used in the PCR
are Taq polymerase from the thermophilic bacte-
rium Thermus aquaticus and the Vent polymerase
from Thermococcus litoralis.
The PCR cycle takes place in three steps as
follows (Fig. 9.3):
•
Step 1: The target DNA containing the
sequence to be ampliﬁed is heat-denatured to

108
9
Genomics, Proteomics and Molecular Biology in Microbiology
Fig. 9.3 Steps in the PCR
cycle
separate its complementary strands. Normally
the target DNA is between 100 and 5000 bp in
length.
•
Step 2: The temperature is lowered so that the
primers can anneal to the DNA on both sides
of the target sequence. Because the primers are
present in excess, the targeted DNA strands
normally anneal to the primers rather than
each other.
•
Step 3: DNA polymerase extends the primers
and synthesises copies of the target DNA
sequence
using
the
deoxyribonucleoside
triphosphates.
At the end of one cycle, the targeted sequences
on both strands are copied. The four strands from
the ﬁrst cycle are copied to produce eight
fragments when the three-step cycle is repeated.
The third cycle yields 16 products. Theoretically,
20 cycles will produce about one million copies
of the target DNA sequence, and 30 cycles yield
around one billion copies.
Multiplex PCR: It is another modiﬁcation of
PCR in which two or more target sequences
can be demonstrated simultaneously in a sin-
gle specimen at the same time (Fig. 9.4). This

method uses two or more primer sets to
amplify different targets. Multiplex is now
increasingly evaluated for simultaneous dem-
onstration of two or more pathogens in a clini-
cal specimen.
Real-time PCR (RT PCR): It is the most recent
development. It is so named because the PCR
amplicons
can be detected in real time
(Fig. 9.5). In fact, “real time” refers to the
detection of amplicons after each PCR cycle.
Results can be obtained in considerably less
time than it takes to perform a conventional
PCR assay. Several commercial instruments
are available that combine PCR ampliﬁcation
of target DNA with the detection of amplicons
in the same closed vessel. Probe detection
formats
involve
detecting
ﬂuorophores.
Results could be either quantitative or qualita-
tive. For the quantiﬁcation, called quantitative
RT PCR (qRT PCR), standards in different
concentrations are also ampliﬁed along with
the target. From a standard curve developed

using
the

patterns
of
the
standards, the unknown concentration of the
target could be identiﬁed.
Nested PCR: It is a modiﬁcation of classical PCR
systems where two pairs of primers are used to
increase the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the
PCR. The ﬁrst primer pair ampliﬁes the region
of DNA, wherein the second primer pair
ampliﬁes
the
ﬁrst-round
amplicon
by
annealing to a sequence internal to the
sequence ampliﬁed by the ﬁrst prime set.
This second recognition only allows ampliﬁ-
cation of desired DNA wherein the increased
sensitivity arises from the high total cycle
number. In semi-nested PCR, one of the
primers in the second PCR is identical to the
ﬁrst.
Applications of PCR The PCR and other
molecular techniques have already proven excep-
tionally valuable in many areas of molecular biol-
ogy, medicine and biotechnology. These methods
are useful for the following reasons:
1. Amplify very small quantities of a speciﬁc
DNA and provide sufﬁcient material for accu-
rately sequencing the fragment or cloning it by
standard technique.
2. Detect previously unrecognised or uncultiva-
ble microorganisms.
3. Detect the genes responsible for drug resis-
tance. They supplement conventional antimi-
crobial
susceptibility
testing
to
detect
methicillin resistance in staphylococci, rifam-
picin resistance in M. tuberculosis and so on.
4. Predict
and
monitor
the
response
of
individuals chronically infected with hepatitis
B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or
HIV to antiviral therapy.
5. Provide useful information that may predict
the progression of the disease. Determination
of HIV-1 viral load as a predictor of progres-
sion to AIDS is an example.
6. Diagnose AIDS, Lyme disease, chlamydia,
tuberculosis, hepatitis, the human papilloma-
virus and other infectious agents.
7. Detect genetic diseases such as sickle cell
anaemia,
phenylketonuria
and
muscular
dystrophy.
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Assay (LAMP)
In LAMP, four pairs of primers are used to take
advantage of strand displacement activity of
DNA polymerase. The forward inner primer
hybridise with a target to initiate LAMP. The
DNA synthesis is initiated upon the annealing of
the outer primer to its complementary region. Its
extension
causes
strand
displacement
that
releases a ssDNA molecule. This molecule serves
as template for second inner and outer primers
that produces a stem-loop DNA structure. Next,
LAMP enters in the cycling phase in which one
inner primer hybridises to the stem-loop and
initiates displacement DNA synthesis. This yields
the original stem–loop molecule and a new stem–
loop DNA with a stem twice as long (Fig. 9.6)
Compared to PCR, LAMP is 10- to 100-fold
more sensitive. It also does not require an initial
template denaturation step at 95 C and allows
results to be visualised by the naked eye

(e.g. turbidimetry). This makes it ideal for PoC
applications.

Ligase Chain Reaction
It is a type of probe ampliﬁcation method where
two oligonucleotide probes labelled with capture
haptens are used. They hybridise side by side on
each of the denatured target DNA with the forma-
tion of a nick. The DNA ligase molecule is used
to seal the nick and such ligated molecule is
allowed to amplify. The ampliﬁcation product is
detected by microparticle enzyme immunoassay.
Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA)
and Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based
Amplification (NASBA)
Like LAMP, these are also isothermal processes
where there is no need for a thermal cycler. In
principle, both are very similar and are essentially
RNA ampliﬁcation techniques. The RNA is
converted to cDNA by a process of reverse tran-
scription
and
then
the
RNA
copies
are
synthesised
by
using
RNA
polymerase.
In
TMA,
reverse
transcriptase
with
inherent
RNAse H property is used while in NASBA
Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcrip-
tase (AMV RT) is used. The ﬁnal products are
detected by hybridisation.
Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA)
It is a technically easy-to-use isothermal tech-
nique which can detect minute amounts of nucleic
acids. Real-time detection of ampliﬁed products
is possible using ﬂuorescent probes, similar to
real-time PCR.
Non-amplification DNA Techniques
In
molecular
diagnosis,
the
ﬁrst-generation
technologies
were completely
dependent on
nucleic
acid
ampliﬁcation
technologies
(NAATs) using PCRs. Despite PCRs being
highly sensitive, they require large, sophisticated
equipment
to
maintain
different
working
temperatures, which has largely prevented them

from becoming a novel integrated device for sin-
gle workﬂow and high-throughput analysis.

Genomics, Proteomics and Molecular Biology in Microbiology
However, rapid scientiﬁc advancement has
brought
innovations
where
non-PCR-based
DNA ampliﬁcation technologies and tools have
been developed to overcome the limitation of the
previous technologies.
DNA Microarray
A DNA microarray (DNA chip) is a collection of
microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid sur-
face. Each spot contains thousands of copies of a
speciﬁc DNA sequence, known as probes. Each
microarray includes a few probe sets for a speciﬁc
gene target. Probe-target hybridisation is detected
and quantiﬁed by detecting ﬂuorophore-, silver-,
or chemiluminescence-labelled targets. It thus
helps to determine the relative abundance of
transcripts in the target sample. It has found
potential applications in genotyping, gene expres-
sion proﬁling, transcription factor binding assays
and so on (Fig. 9.7).

Molecular Biology Applications
in Microbial Genetics
After the DNA is transferred from one donor
bacterium to the recipient through transformation,
transduction or conjugation, it combines with the
chromosome of the bacterium by a process called
recombination.
Recombination is of two types: homologous
and non-homologous. Homologous recombina-
tion takes place between two pieces of DNA,
showing extensive homologous reunions. This
results in the pairing up and exchange of pieces
by the processes of breakage and reunion. The
non-homologous
recombination
takes
place
between two pieces of DNA, showing little or
no homology.
Molecular Genetics
Molecular genetics basically deals with studying
the structure and function of genes at the molecu-
lar level. Advancements and methodologies in

molecular genetics in analysing and manipulating
DNA can help understand heredity, genetic
diseases and genetic variation. In this section, a
few
techniques
and
their
applications
are
discussed later.
Molecular Biology
113
Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the process of modifying
the genome of a particular organism. In recent
years, with the help of engineering, bacterial
genetics has modiﬁed biology. At a sensible
cost, desired DNA can be detected and ampliﬁed,
and their genes can be expressed at desired con-
tent in other expression systems at a reasonable
cost. It directly impacts society, especially agri-
culture and the healthcare system.
Restriction Endonucleases
Restriction endonucleases are enzymes produced
by bacteria and are used to split large fragments of
DNA into smaller pieces which can be visualised
under UV light when run on an agarose gel. Many
restriction enzymes are available in nature, and
they speciﬁcally cleave double-stranded DNA at
a particular site. In nature, bacteria use these
restriction
endonucleases
to
destroy
foreign
DNA, which may enter the bacterial cytoplasm.
Restriction enzymes are generally used in recom-
binant DNA technology and molecular epidemio-
logical studies. EcoRI, HindIII and so on are
examples
of
frequently
used
restriction
endonucleases.
Hybridisation Technique
Hybridisation probes are used routinely in the
cloning of DNA. The amino acid sequence of a
protein is used to deduce the DNA sequence from
which a probe may be constructed and employed
to detect a bacterial colony containing the cloned
gene. cDNA, encoded by mRNA, is used to
detect the gene that encodes the mRNA.
Hybridisation
is
of
different
types.
The
hybridisation of DNA to RNA is known as
Northern
blot,
which
provides
quantitative
information
about
RNA
synthesis.
The
hybridisation of DNA to DNA is known as the
Southern blot. This method is useful to detect
speciﬁc DNA sequences in restriction fragments
separated on gels. These blots can be used to
detect overlapping restriction fragments. West-
ern blot is a technique used to detect genes, in
which antibodies are used to detect cloned genes
by binding to their protein products.
Cloning these fragments makes it possible to
isolate ﬂanking regions of DNA by a technique
known as chromosomal walking.
DNA Sequencing
DNA sequencing shows gene structure that helps
research workers to ﬁnd out the structure of gene
products.
DNA sequencing has many applications. DNA
sequence
analysis
demonstrates
regulatory
regions that control gene expression and genetic
“hot spots” particularly susceptible to mutation.
Information obtained by DNA sequencing makes
it possible to understand or alter the function of
genes. A comparison of DNA sequences shows
evolutionary relationships that provide a frame-
work
for
the
deﬁnite
classiﬁcation
of
microorganisms, including viruses. In addition,
the comparison of DNA sequences facilitates the
identiﬁcation of conserved regions, which are
useful
for
developing
speciﬁc
hybridisation
probes
to
detect
microorganisms,
including
viruses in clinical samples.
Maxam-Gilbert
technique
and
Sanger
(dideoxy termination) methods are used rou-
tinely
for
DNA
sequence
determination.
Maxam-Gilbert technique depends on the relative
chemical liability of different nucleotide bonds,
whereas the Sanger method interrupts the elonga-
tion
of
DNA
sequences
by
incorporating
dideoxynucleotides into the sequences.
Genetic Mapping
Genetic mapping is mapping the entire chromo-
some to develop methods to identify gene
locations and new genes and understand their
function. In 1913, Alfred Sturtevant created the
ﬁrst genetic chromosome map from the fruit ﬂy
(Drosophila melanogaster). It has been used to
ﬁnd genes responsible for inherited disorders
such as cystic ﬁbrosis and Duchenne muscular
dystrophy. It also helps ﬁnd many genes that are
believed to play a role in developing more

common disorders such as asthma, heart disease,
diabetes, cancer and psychiatric conditions.

Recombinant DNA Technology
In recombinant DNA technology, a particular
phenotype for DNA bounded is recognised and
combined. Once puriﬁed, the gene or genes are
combined with other pieces of DNA to recombi-
nant DNA molecules. These are inseminated
(gene cloning) by infusion into an organism that
is not necessarily the initial gene donor or in the
same division.
Cloning Vectors and Hosts
A good recombinant vector has two indispensable
qualities: it must be capable of carrying a signiﬁ-
cant piece of the donor DNA and the cloning host
must readily accept it.
Cloning Vectors
Cloned vectors include plasmids, bacteriophages
and hybrid vectors.
1. Plasmids are excellent vectors because they
are small, well characterised, easy to manipu-
late and can be transferred into appropriate
host cells through transformation. Escherichia
coli plasmid carries genetic markers for resis-
tance to antibiotics, although it is restricted by
the relatively small amount of foreign DNA it
can accept.
2. Bacteriophages are also good vectors because
they can naturally inject DNA into bacterial
hosts through transduction. The Charon2
phage is a modiﬁed phage vector that lacks a
large part of its genome; hence, it can carry a
relatively large segment of foreign DNA.
3. Hybrid vectors have been developed by splic-
ing two different vectors together. A cosmid is
an example of a hybrid vector that combines a
plasmid and a phage and can carry relatively
large genomic sequences. A hybrid E. coli-
yeast vector can be inserted in bacterial and
yeast cloning hosts.
Cloning Hosts
E. coli is the traditional cloning host still used in
most experiments. This is because this bacterium
was the initial recombinant host used and
the protocols using these are well approved,
comparatively easy and authenticated. There
are
hundreds
of
functional
cloning
vectors
which have been reﬁned for the organism.
The main drawback with E. coli is its lack of
ﬂexibility
incorrectly
expressing
eukaryotic
genes.
The
yeast
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
is
another alternative host used for research and
certain industrial processes. This host, being
eukaryotic, acquired mechanisms for processing
and adapting eukaryotic gene products. Many
known approaches may also assign different bac-
teria (Bacillus subtilis), plant and animal cell
cultures and even live animals to be attributed as
cloning hosts.
Biological Products of Recombinant DNA
Technology
Pharmaceutical companies use recombinant DNA
technology to manufacture medicines that other
means cannot produce. Diseases caused by a lack
of essential hormones (e.g. diabetes and dwarf-
ism) are now being treated by replacing the genes
of the missing hormone. Porcine and bovine insu-
lin were once the only forms available to treat
diabetes, even though such animal products were
used to cause allergic reactions in certain sensi-
tive individuals. In contrast, dwarﬁsm that cannot
be treated with animal growth hormones was
treated
only
with
human
growth
hormone
(HGH) obtained from the pituitaries of cadavers.
At one time, not enough HGH was available to
treat thousands of children in need. However,
now the scenario is changed by the advent of
recombinant HGH. Recombinant technology has
changed the outcome of these and many other
conditions by enabling the large-scale manufac-
ture of lifesaving hormones and enzymes of
human origin.
Genetically Modified Organisms
The process of artiﬁcially introducing foreign
genes into organisms is termed transfection,
and the recombinant organisms produced in this
way are called transgenic or genetically modiﬁed
organisms.

Molecular Biology
115
Gene Therapy
Gene therapy is a technique for replacing a faulty
gene with a normal one in individuals with fatal
or extremely debilitating genetic diseases. The
inherent beneﬁt of this therapy is to permanently
cure the physiological dysfunction by repairing
the genetic defect.
The ﬁrst gene therapy experiment in humans
was started in 1990 by researchers at the National
Institutes of Health USA. A 4-year-old girl was
the subject who was suffering from a severe
immunodeﬁciency disease produced by the lack
of enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). She was
given her own blood cells known to contain a
functional ADA gene that had been modiﬁed.
Later, other children suffering were administered
a similar type of therapy. So far, the children have
shown exceptional advancement and continue to
be healthy, but the treatment is not permanent and
must be repeated. Proper scientiﬁc controlled
trials are required before its induction as a routine
clinical practice.

Part II
Immunology

Immunity
10
The term immunity is derived from the Latin
word “immunis” (exempt), which originally
referred to the protection from legal prosecution
offered to the Roman senators during their tenures
in ofﬁce. Subsequently, this term was adopted to
designate
the
naturally
acquired
protection
against diseases, such as measles or smallpox. It
indicated that an individual could develop life-
long resistance to a certain disease after having
contracted it only once. The cells and molecules
responsible for immunity constitute the immune
system, and their collective and coordinated
response to foreign substances is called the
immune response.
The concept of immunity has existed since
ancient times. An example is a Chinese custom
of making children resistant to smallpox by
making them inhale powders made from the
skin lesions of patients recovering from the dis-
ease. Thucydides records the ﬁrst European men-
tion of immunity in Athens during the ﬁfth
century BC. In describing the plague in Athens,
he wrote in 430 BC that only those who had
recovered from it could nurse the sick because
they would not contract the disease a second time.
Von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato’s
experiments in 1890 gave an idea about the mech-
anism of immunity. This earned Von Behring a
Nobel Prize in medicine in 1901. Kitasato
showed that serum from animals immunised to
diphtheria could transfer the immune state to
non-immunised animals. Since then, immunology
has come a long way as a ﬁeld of study. It has
been and remains one of the hottest research
ﬁelds, as shown by the statistic that about
17 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists
involved in immunological research.

The immune system’s primary function is to
prevent
or
limit
infections
by
pathogenic
microorganisms,
such
as
bacteria,
viruses,
parasites and fungi. Recognising microorganisms
and foreign substances is the ﬁrst event in the
host’s immune responses. The body’s defence
mechanisms can be broadly divided into innate
(native) and acquired (adaptive) immunity.
Innate or Native Immunity
Innate or native immunity is the immunity present
by birth in an individual. It is due to an
individual’s genetic and constitutional make-up;
hence, prior contact with microorganisms or their
products is not essential. It acts as the ﬁrst line of
defence
of
the
host
immune
system.
The
mechanisms involved in innate immunity are
present in place even before exposure to the for-
eign agent. They are not speciﬁc to any infectious
agent and do not seem to improve response on
repeated
exposures.
Phagocytic
cells
(e.g. macrophages and neutrophils), barriers
(e.g. skin and mucous membrane) and various
antimicrobial compounds synthesised by the
host play important roles in innate immunity.
Innate immunity may be classiﬁed as individual
immunity, racial immunity and species immunity.

120
10
Immunity
Individual Immunity
It denotes resistance to infection, which varies
among individuals of the same race and species
and is genetically determined. For example, if one
homozygous twin develops tuberculosis, there is
very likely that the other twin will also develop
tuberculosis. However, there is a very low possi-
bility of the other twin suffering from tuberculosis
in heterozygous twins.
Racial Immunity
It denotes a difference in susceptibility or resis-
tance to infection among different races within
the same species. For example, races with sickle
cell anaemia prevalent on the Mediterranean coast
are immune to infection caused by the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This is due to
a genetic abnormality of erythrocytes, resulting in
sickle-shaped
erythrocytes
that
prevent
parasitisation
by
P.
falciparum.
Similarly,
individuals with a hereditary deﬁciency of glu-
cose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase are also less
susceptible to infection by P. falciparum.
Species Immunity
It denotes a total or relative resistance to a patho-
gen shown by all members of a particular species.
For example, chickens are resistant to Bacillus
anthracis, rats are resistant to Corynebacterium
diphtheriae and humans are susceptible to these
bacteria. The exact reason for such a type of
immunity is not known.
Factors Influencing Innate Immunity
The factors that may inﬂuence the host’s innate
immunity include the age and nutritional status of
the host.
Age
Extremes of age make an individual highly sus-
ceptible to various infections. The immature
immune system partly explains this in very
young children and waning immunity in older
individuals.
The
foetus-in-utero
is
usually
protected from maternal infections by the placen-
tal barrier. However, human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV), rubella virus, cytomegalovirus and
Toxoplasma gondii cross the placental barrier and
cause congenital infections.
Very old people are susceptible to suffering
more
than
young
people
from
a
disease
(e.g. pneumonia) and have high mortality. Mea-
sles, mumps, poliomyelitis and chickenpox are a
few examples of the diseases that cause more
severe clinical illness in adults than in young
children.
Nutrition
Nutritional status of the host plays a vital role in
innate immunity. Both humoral and cell-mediated
immunities are lowered in malnutrition. For
example, neutrophil activity is reduced, interferon
response is decreased and C3 and factor B of the
complement are decreased in protein-calorie mal-
nutrition. The deﬁciency of vitamin A, vitamin C
and folic acid makes an individual highly suscep-
tible to infection by many microbial pathogens.
Hormones
Individuals
with
certain
hormonal
disorders
become increasingly susceptible to infection.
For example, individuals suffering from diabetes
mellitus, hypothyroidism and adrenal dysfunction
are increasingly susceptible to staphylococcal
infection, streptococcal infection, candidiasis,
aspergillosis,
zygomycosis
and
many
other
microbial infections. Similarly, pregnant women
are more susceptible to many infections due to
higher levels of steroids during pregnancy.
Mechanisms of Innate Immunity
Innate immunity of the host performs the two
most
important
functions.
It
kills
invading

microbes
and
activates
acquired
(adaptive)
immune processes. Innate immunity, unlike adap-
tive immunity, does not have any memory and
does not improve after re-exposure to the same
microorganism. The innate immunity acts by the
following mechanisms:
Innate or Native Immunity
121
Epithelial Surfaces
They act as mechanical barriers and prevent the
entry of microorganisms into the body.
Skin
The
intact
skin
prevents
the
entry
of
microorganisms. When there are breaks in the
skin due to wounds, scratches or abrasion,
microorganisms can easily enter and cause infec-
tion. That is why pathogens can enter the body
when insects with pathogenic organisms bite the
skin surface (e.g. mosquitoes, mites, ticks, ﬂeas
and sandﬂies). Also, glands in the skin secrete
sebum, which consists of lactic acid and fatty
acids that maintain the skin pH between 3 and
5.
This
inhibits
the
growth
of
most
microorganisms.
Mucous Membrane
The mucous membrane forms a large part of the
outer covering of the human host’s gastrointesti-
nal, respiratory, genitourinary and many other
tracts. Several non-speciﬁc defence mechanisms
act to prevent the entry of microorganisms.
Epithelial cells of mucous membranes secrete
mucus that entraps invading microorganisms.
Saliva, tears and other body secretions wash
away invading microorganisms, preventing their
attachment to the initial site of infections. These
secretions also contain antibacterial or antiviral
substances that can kill invading pathogens. In
the lower respiratory tract, the mucous membrane
is covered by cilia, the hair-like protrusions of the
epithelial cell membranes. The synchronous
movement
of
cilia
moves
mucus-entrapped
microorganisms from the lower respiratory tract
towards the nose. Gastric acidity also destroys
microorganisms
since
few
ingested
microorganisms can survive the low pH of stom-
ach contents.
The vaginal microbiota is predominantly
made up of lactobacilli. They not only block the
entry of pathogens, but the lactic acid produced
produces
an
acidic
environment
with
a
pH 3.0–4.5. These also contribute to innate
defence mechanisms by inhibiting or killing
invading pathogens. In contrast to the female
reproductive tract, the male reproductive tract is
sterile. The ﬂushing action of urine can remove
many microbes which might have gained access
to the urethra. In addition, the seminal plasma has
got many antibacterial substances, among which
semenogelin plays an important role. Major bac-
tericidal activity is shown by peptides derived by
proteolysis of seminogelin I and II, which is
dependent on zinc ions present in the seminal
ﬂuid in high concentration.
Several enzymes are of importance in innate
defence. Lysozyme is most important, found in
saliva, tears, respiratory tract and reproductive
tracts, which can disrupt the peptidoglycan layer
of bacteria, causing its death.
Microbial Antagonisms
Non-pathogenic organisms tend to colonise the
epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces. These normal
ﬂorae generally compete with pathogens for
attachment sites on the epithelial cell surface
and
necessary
nutrients.
For
example,
in
antibiotic-associated
diarrhoea,
extraneous
organisms such as Staphylococcus may replace
normal gut ﬂora and cause enterocolitis. Simi-
larly, germ-free animal models have been found
to be highly susceptible to multiple infections.
Hence, normal ﬂora is an important constituent
of innate immunity.
Antibacterial Constituents of Blood
and Tissues
The complement system plays a vital role in
destroying invading organisms from blood and
tissues.
In
complementary
to
this,
several
antibacterial substances have been described to
play a critical role in innate immunity. Anthrax
groups of bacilli are sensitive to a relatively ther-
mostable substance called beta-lysine. Lukins and
plakins are the basic polypeptides extracted from
leukocytes and platelets, respectively, found to

have an antibacterial effect. Acidic substances,
such as lactic acid produced in muscle and inﬂam-
matory sites, are lethal to invading microbes.
Interferons
are
naturally
secreted
signalling
proteins of host cells in response to pathogen
invasion and are commonly used in acute viral
infection therapy. Lactoferrin, calprotectin and
psoriasin are proteins found in mucosal secretions
at multiple body sites. These can cause sequestra-
tion of metal ions such as iron, manganese or zinc
and deprive the bacteria or the fungi of these
metals, causing inhibition of their growth. In
addition, they can also disrupt the cell membrane.
The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), made up of
less than 100 amino acids, are a group of defence
molecules present in many living beings, includ-
ing the skin and epithelium of humans. The
important AMPs are α- and β-defensins and
cathelicidin, which can kill many pathogens by
causing membrane damage of bacteria, fungi,
parasites and even viruses. They can also enter
the microbial body and cause inhibition of DNA
or RNA synthesis.
122
10
Immunity
Cellular Factors
Although the skin and mucosa defence system
provides
a
formidable
barrier
to
invading
pathogens, these microbes can cross the epithelial
barrier and gain entry into tissue spaces in many
instances. In such circumstances, a non-speciﬁc
immune response is mediated by various cells
that can detect foreign organisms.
The phagocytic cells make up the second
defence barrier, and such cells include mono-
cyte/macrophages,
neutrophils
and
dendritic
cells.
Many
tissues
harbour
resident
macrophages, such as the Kupffer cells in the
liver or the Langerhans cells in the skin, which
can
take
care
of
pathogens.
Lymphocytes
associated with certain mucosal surfaces like the
intestine (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Sys-
tem or MALT) provide both innate and adaptive
immune functions at these sites. Natural Killer
(NK)
cells
are
particularly
important
in
destroying intracellular pathogens like viruses
and malignant cells by causing the death of the
host cell, harbouring the pathogen and activating
adaptive immune response by cytokine signal.
Several new cell subsets have been described in
recent years, which play a dual role in innate and
adaptive immunity. These include γ-δ T Cells,
NK T cells, Innate Lymphoid cells (ILCs) and
alternatively activated macrophages (AAM).
Phagocytosis
It is another important defence mechanism. It is a
process of ingestion of extracellular particulate
material by cells, such as neutrophils, blood
monocytes and tissue macrophages. It is a type
of endocytosis in which invading microorganisms
are ingested by the phagocytic cells. During
phagocytosis,
the
cell’s
plasma
membrane
expands around the particulate material, which
may include whole pathogenic microorganisms.
The engulfment of the matter ultimately forms
large vesicles called phagosomes.
Interestingly, certain microbes such as Myco-
bacterium and Brucella have been known to pos-
sess immune evasion mechanisms by multiplying
inside phagosomes. In such cases, phagocytosis
eventually helps disseminate and progress the
disease. However, in agranulocytosis (depleted
phagocytic cells) and chronic granulomatous
diseases
(presence
of
functionally
deﬁcient
phagocytes), patients are more prone to infection,
which indicates the importance of phagocytic
cells in innate immunity. The natural killer
(NK) cells, a subset of lymphocytes, also play
an important role in non-speciﬁc immunity.
Interferons activate NK cells and speciﬁcally kill
virally infected cells and tumour cells.
Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)
These are proteins present on the host immune
cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages,
with unique pattern recognition capabilities.
They recognise unique, conserved proteins of
microbes and activate immune systems. Thirteen
different TLRs can recognise different pathogens
and enhance innate immune mechanisms by
phagocytosis and inﬂammation.
Fever
Fever results in increased host metabolism and, in
some cases, the destruction of the invading path-
ogen. For example, fever stimulates interferon

production in viral infections and, in turn, kills the
virus and causes recovery from infection. Before
the penicillin discovery, therapeutic induction of
fever was one of the treatment modalities used to
kill Treponema pallidum in syphilis patients.
Innate or Native Immunity
123
Inflammation
Tissue damage caused by a wound or an invading
pathogenic microorganism induces a complex
sequence of events, collectively known as the
inﬂammatory responses. The end result of inﬂam-
mation may be the activation of a speciﬁc
immune response to the invasion or clearance of
the invader by components of the innate immune
system. The four cardinal features of inﬂamma-
tory responses are rubor (redness), calor (temper-
ature rise), dolor (pain) and tumor (swelling).
Histamine,
kinins,
acute-phase
proteins
and
defensin are the important mediators of inﬂam-
matory reactions.
Histamine
It is a chemical substance produced by a variety
of cells in response to tissue injury. It is one of the
principal mediators of the inﬂammatory response.
It binds to receptors on nearby capillaries and
venules, causing vasodilatation and increased
permeability.
Kinins
These are other important mediators of inﬂamma-
tory response. They are normally present in blood
plasma
in
an
inactive
form.
Tissue
injury
activates these small peptides, which then cause
vasodilatation and increased permeability of
capillaries.
Bradykinin
also
stimulates
pain
receptors in the skin. This effect probably serves
a protective role because pain typically causes an
individual to protect the injured area.
Acute-phase Reactant Proteins
These include C-reactive proteins and mannose-
binding proteins that form part of the innate
immunity. These proteins are produced at an
increased concentration in plasma during an
acute-phase reaction as a non-speciﬁc response
to microorganisms and other forms of tissue
injury. They are synthesised in the liver in
response to cytokines called pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines,
namely,
interleukin-1
(IL-1),
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tissue necrosis factor
(TNF).
They
are
called
pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines because they enhance the inﬂammatory
responses.
Defensins
These are another important component of innate
immunity. They are cationic peptides that pro-
duce pores in the membrane of the bacteria and
thereby kill them. These are present mainly in the
lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract.
The
respiratory
tract
contains
β-defensins,
whereas
the
gastrointestinal
tract
contains
α-defensins.
The
α-defensins
also
exhibit
antiviral activity. They bind to the CXCR4
receptors and block the entry of the HIV virus
into the cell. How these defensins differentiate
microbes from some cells is not known.

nity since the potency of immune response is
acquired by experience only. It is the resistance
acquired by an individual during life. In other
words, it refers to antigen-speciﬁc immune
response.
Differences
between
innate
and
acquired
immunity
are
summarised
in
Table 10.2. Characteristic features of acquired
immunity include the following:
1. Antigenic speciﬁcity: The immune system
can recognise and distinguish antigens. This
speciﬁcity property is initiated and undertaken
by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as
activated T cells, B cells, macrophages, den-
dritic cells and thymic epithelial cells.
2. Diversity: This property enables the immune
system to respond to a large variety of
antigens. Many genes form the basis of such
diversity.
3. Immunologic memory: The development of
immunological memory is the important fea-
ture of acquired immunity in which pathogens
are “remembered” through memory B cells
and memory T cells. Repeated exposure to
the same antigen leads to a secondary response
that is more speciﬁc, heightened and quick.

4. Self/non-self-recognition: Recognition and
distinguishing speciﬁc “non-self” (foreign)
antigens in the presence of “self” during anti-
gen presentation is another feature. This self-
tolerance property prevents injury to the host
during responses to foreign antigens. Multiple
mechanisms
regulate
and
ensure
this
self-tolerance property; any defect in these
mechanisms may lead to autoimmunity.
Types of Acquired Immunity
Acquired immunity against a microbe may be
induced by the host’s response to the microbe or
by transferring antibodies or lymphocytes speciﬁc
to the microbes. It is of two types: active immu-
nity and passive immunity.
Active Immunity
The immunity induced by exposure to a foreign
antigen is called active immunity. It is also called
adaptive immunity, as it represents the adaptive
response of an individual after contact with a
speciﬁc pathogen or other antigens. This contact
may be in the form of (1) clinical or sub-clinical
infection, (2) immunisation with live or killed
infectious agents or their antigens or (3) exposure
to microbial products, such as toxins and toxoids.
In all these circumstances, the host’s immune
system is stimulated to elicit an immune response
consisting of antibodies and activated helper T
(Th) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes/cells
(CTLs). Active immunity is mediated by humoral
immunity and cell-mediated immunity. Different
immune system components and functions medi-
ate these two types of immunities in different
ways
to
kill
different
types
of
pathogens
(Table 10.3).
Active immunity develops after
a latent
period, during which the host’s immunity is
geared up to act against the microorganism.
Hence, it is slow in onset, especially during this
primary response. However, once the active
immunity develops, it is long-lasting, which is
the primary advantage of active immunity.
Types of Active Immunity
Active immunity is of two types: natural active
immunity and artiﬁcial active immunity.
1. Natural active immunity: It is acquired by
natural
clinical
or
sub-clinical
infections.
Such natural immunity is long-lasting. For
example, individuals suffering from smallpox
become immune to a second disease attack.

Similarly, a person with infection by Hepatitis
A virus develops immunity, which may be
lifelong. Temporary immunity is induced by
the majority of wild infections where the indi-
vidual remains protected for a few months to a
few years.
A special kind of naturally acquired protective
immunity is premunition, which is commonly
seen with some parasitic infections in hyper-
endemic areas. It is also known as infection-
immunity, where previous infections protect
an individual against subsequent attacks by a
larger number of parasites. It is seen in
malaria-endemic zones, and the reason behind
it is not exactly clear. Either a low level of
parasitaemia in the host or the presence of
antibodies
may
be
responsible
for
this
phenomenon.
2. Artiﬁcial active immunity: It is induced in
individuals by vaccines. There is a wide
range of vaccines available against many
microbial pathogens. These may be live
vaccines,
killed
vaccines
or
vaccines
containing bacterial products.
Live
vaccines
are
made
by
attenuation
(reduced virulence) of pathogens, which can be
administered
orally
or
parenterally.
These
vaccines initiate infection without harming the
host (without disease), but it activates the immune
system as natural infection. Thus, immunity
acquired by live vaccines lasts for a long time
and may require booster doses.
Killed vaccines are less immunogenic than
live vaccines and need repeated doses of admin-
istration. In general, a minimum of two doses are
required to generate immunity. The ﬁrst dose is
called the primary dose, and the subsequent
doses are known as booster doses. The route of
administration is usually parenteral, and vaccine
potency may be enhanced by combining with an
adjuvant such as aluminium phosphate.
Examples of bacterial vaccines include live
(BCG for tuberculosis), killed (cholera vaccine),
sub-unit (typhoid VI antigen) and bacterial
products (tetanus toxoid). The bacterial polysac-
charide
vaccines
are
made
up
of
capsular
polysaccharides (Pneumococcal, Meningococcal
and
Haemophilus
inﬂuenza
type
b).
Viral
vaccines include live (Sabin—oral polio vac-
cine), killed (Salk—injectable polio vaccine)
and sub-unit (hepatitis B vaccine).
Passive Immunity
When immunity is conferred by the transfer of
serum
or
lymphocytes
from
a
speciﬁcally
immunised individual, it is known as passive
immunity. This is a useful method for rapidly
conferring resistance without waiting for the
development of an active immune response. Pas-
sive immunity may be natural or artiﬁcial.

Natural Passive Immunity
It is observed when IgG is passed from mother to
foetus during pregnancy. This forms the basis of
preventing neonatal tetanus in neonates by active
immunisation of pregnant mothers. It is achieved
by administering tetanus toxoid to pregnant
mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy.
This induces a high level of antibodies in the
mother against tetanus toxin, which is subse-
quently
transmitted
from
mother
to
foetus
through the placenta. The antibodies subse-
quently protect neonates after birth against the
risk of tetanus. Natural passive immunity is also
observed by the passage of IgA from mother to
newborn during breastfeeding.
Artificial Passive Immunity
It is induced in an individual by administering
preformed antibodies, generally in the form of
antiserum, raised against an infecting agent.
Administration of these antisera makes large
amounts of antibodies available in the recipient
host to neutralise the action of toxins.
The preformed antibodies against rabies and
hepatitis A and B viruses and so on given during
the incubation period prevent virus replication
and alter the course of infection. The immediate
availability of a large number of antibodies is the
main advantage of passive immunity. However,
the short lifespan of these antibodies and the
possibility
of
hypersensitivity
reaction
if
antibodies prepared in other animal species are
given to hypersensitive individuals to these ani-
mal globulins (e.g. serum sickness) are the two
noted
disadvantages
of
passive
immunity.
Differences between passive and active immunity
are summarised in Table 10.4.
Combined Passive-Active Immunisation
It is carried out by giving both preformed
antibodies (antiserum) and a vaccine to provide
immediate protection and long-term protection,
respectively, against a disease. This approach is
followed to prevent certain infectious conditions,
namely, tetanus, rabies and hepatitis B.
Local Immunity
The immunity at the site of invasion and multipli-
cation of a pathogen is called local immunity.
Secretory IgA antibodies confer local immunity
in various body secretions. These antibodies are
produced locally by plasma cells present on
mucosal surfaces or in secretory glands. Addi-
tionally, attenuated live viral vaccines are given
orally or intranasally to induce local immunity in
gut mucosa and nasal mucosa.

128
10
Immunity
Herd Immunity
Herd immunity refers to an overall immunity level
in a community. Eradication of an infectious dis-
ease from a population depends on developing a
high level of herd immunity against the pathogen.
Conversely, when herd immunity against disease
is very low, indicating a larger number of suscep-
tible people in the community, an epidemic of
disease is likely to occur.
Measurement of Immunity
The resistance offered by an individual’s immune
system to the invading pathogen is called immu-
nity. Since the pathogen alters immunity, it can-
not be calculated accurately. In general, an
estimate of immunity is calculated by collecting
data from many individuals and applying appro-
priate statistical tools.
immunity measurement is the demonstration of a
speciﬁc antibody in an individual to a particular
The type of immune response in immunity can
be
calculated
qualitatively
or
quantitatively
depending on the pathogen. A simple method of
pathogen. However, the demonstration of a single
antibody is not always an indicator of immunity
because the host can produce several antibodies
and cell-mediated responses towards a particular
pathogen. The antibody detection may be done by
several methods such as ELISA, agglutination,
precipitation, western blotting, hemagglutination
inhibition, neutralisation and many others. If the
knowledge about the protective antigen of the
pathogen is unclear, then the serological methods
employed
to
measure
immunity
yield
an
incomprehensive result. However, in certain
organisms like Corynebacterium, where pathoge-
nicity is due to a well-deﬁned antigen, the immu-
nity of an individual towards diphtheria can be
evaluated accurately by in vivo (Schick test) and
in vitro assays. Similarly, if protection against
disease is cell mediated, skin tests for delayed
hypersensitivity and in vitro cell-mediated immu-
nity tests may be employed to evaluate individual
immunity.

Structure and Function of Immune
System
11
The lymphoreticular system consists of intricate
networking of cells with diverse morphology,
which spreads across various organs and tissues
of the human body, and its cumulative effect is
responsible for the immune response. It is made
of lymphoid and reticuloendothelial components.
The lymphoid cells consisting of lymphocytes
and plasma cells confer speciﬁc immunity. Simi-
larly, the reticuloendothelial system consisting of
phagocytic
cells
and
plasma
cells
confers
non-speciﬁc immunity. The important function
of these immune cells is to clear invading foreign
antigens or microbes from blood and tissues.
The speciﬁc immune response to an antigen is
of two types: humoral or antibody-mediated
immunity, mediated by antibodies produced by
plasma cells, and cell-mediated immunity (CMI),
mediated by sensitised lymphocytes. The immune
system is classiﬁed into various tissues, hence
broadly called lymphoid or immune tissues.
These tissues, which developed into an organ of
highly speciﬁc functions, are described as lym-
phoid organs.
Lymphoid System
The lymphoid system includes lymphoid organs
and lymphoid tissues. The lymphoid organs are
classiﬁed into central (primary) and peripheral
(secondary) lymphoid organs based on their
function.

Central (Primary) Lymphoid Organs
Central or primary lymphoid organs are the major
sites for lymphopoiesis. These organs have the
ability to produce progenitor cells of the lympho-
cytic lineage. These are the organs in which pre-
cursor lymphocytes proliferate, develop and
differentiate from lymphoid stem cells to become
immunologically competent cells (ICCs). The pri-
mary lymphoid organs include the thymus and
bone marrow. In mammals, T cells mature in the
thymus and B cells in the foetal liver and bone
marrow. After acquiring immunological compe-
tency, the lymphocytes migrate to secondary lym-
phoid organs to induce an appropriate immune
response on exposure to antigens.
Thymus
The thymus is the ﬁrst lymphoid organ to
develop. It is a bi-lobed ﬂat organ located above
the heart and surrounded by a capsule. Each lobe
is separated into lobules and is connected to each
other by trabeculae, connective tissue. The
lobules are separated into two sections: cortex
and medulla. The stroma of the organ is com-
posed of dendritic cells, epithelial cells and
macrophages (Fig. 11.1). The thymus attains its
maximal size during puberty and atrophies, with
an increase in total fat content of the organ and a
decrease in the cortical and medullary cells.
The cortex consists mainly of (1) cortical
thymocytes,
the
T
lymphocytes,
which
are

immunologically immature cells, and (2) a small
fraction of plasma cells and macrophages. Addi-
tionally, the cortex has two cells, the nurse cells
and the cortical cells, which are subpopulations of
epithelial cells, forming a network in the cortex.
The
medulla
mainly
constitutes
mature
T
lymphocytes. The epithelial cell-to-lymphocyte
ratio is more in the medulla when compared to
the cortex. One of the conspicuous and unique
features of the medulla is the presence of concen-
tric rings of squamous epithelial cells known as
Hassall corpuscles.

Structure and Function of Immune System
Fig. 11.1 A schematic
diagram of the thymus
A vast diversity of T cells is produced in the
thymus, which distinguishes and acts against a
multitude number of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) antigens. The thymus promotes
the demise of those T cells that can no longer
identify MHC antigen and which react with self-
antigen MHC that may evoke autoimmune dis-
ease. Almost 95% of the thymocytes die in the
thymus by apoptosis, without even developing
into mature cells.
Functions
The thymus is the only clearly individualised
primary lymphoid organ in mammals. It has
many
functions.
The
production
of
thymic
lymphocytes is the primary function of the thy-
mus. It is a major organ for the proliferation of
lymphocytes in the body. The thymus is believed
to play a crucial role in determining the differen-
tiation of T lymphocytes. New surface antigens
acquire through the maturation of lymphocytes
which are called T lymphocytes (thymus depen-
dent). During the development of the organ, the
thymus holds control of the immunological com-
petence of the cells. Lymphocyte proliferation in
the thymus, unlike in the peripheral lymphoid
organs, is not dependent on antigenic stimulus.
The T lymphocytes play a major role in CMI.
The
neonatally
thymectomised
mice
are
associated with gross deﬁciency of CMI, which
leads to lymphopenia, deﬁcient graft rejection and
running disease. Another classical example is the
DiGeorge syndrome, where congenital aplasia

has been associated with deﬁciency of CMI due
to the absence of thymus.
Lymphoid System
131
Bone Marrow
Some lymphoid cells develop and mature within
the bone marrow and are called B cells (B for
bursa of Fabricius or bone marrow). The func-
tion of the bursa of Fabricius in birds is played by
the bone marrow in humans. Bone marrow is the
site for stem cell proliferation, the origin of pre-B
cells and their maturation to immunoglobulin-
producing lymphocytes. For this, stromal cells
combine directly with the B cells to secrete dif-
ferent cytokines essential for the maturation of B
cells. A selection process occurs within the bone
marrow to remove antibody receptors of self-
reacting B cells. This process is similar to the
thymic selection that occurs during the matura-
tion of T cells.
Bone marrow dysfunction: The bone marrow
is the most important site for the development and
maturation of B cells. Nevertheless, in addition to
B cells, the bone marrow contains various
immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells, regulatory T cells, NK-T cells, dendritic
cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Any
condition that compromises bone marrow func-
tion adversely affects the individual’s immune
response. Bone marrow dysfunction or failure
may be congenital or acquired. Fanconi anaemia,
Schwachman-Diamond
syndrome,
aplastic
anaemia, sideroblastic anaemia, myelodysplastic
syndrome, leukaemias and so on are conditions
where the patients become immunocompromised
and susceptible to various infections.
Peripheral (Secondary) Lymphoid
Organs
Peripheral or secondary lymphoid organs consist
of lymph nodes, spleen and non-encapsulated
structures, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissues (MALT). These organs serve as the sites
for the interaction of mature lymphocytes with
antigens.
Lymph Nodes
The lymph nodes are extremely numerous and
disseminated all over the body. They play a
dynamic role in the initial or inductive states of
the immune response. Lymph nodes measure
1–25 mm in diameter and are surrounded by a
connective tissue capsule. The lymph node has
two main parts: cortex and medulla. The reticu-
lum or framework of the lymph node is composed
of phagocytes and specialised types of reticular or
dendritic cells.
Cortex: The cortex and the deep cortex, also
known as the paracortical area, are densely
populated by lymphocytes. Roughly spherical
areas containing densely packed lymphocytes,
termed primary lymphoid follicles or nodules,
are found in the cortex. B and T lymphocytes
are found in different areas in the cortex.
The primary lymphoid follicles predominately
contain
B
lymphocytes.
They
also
contain
macrophages,
dendritic
cells
and
some
T
lymphocytes. The primary follicles are very
densely packed with small lymphocytes, not
actively involved in an immune response. The
larger, less dense follicles, termed secondary
follicles, are found in the cortex of a lymph
node draining an area where an infection has
occurred. The secondary follicles contain clear
germinal centres where B lymphocytes actively
divide due to antigenic stimulation.
T lymphocytes are found predominantly in the
deep cortex or paracortical area; hence, the
paracortical area is termed T dependent. Also,
interdigitating cells exist in the paracortical area,
where
the
antigen
is
presented
to
the
T
lymphocytes.
Medulla: Medulla is predominately packed with
medullary cords and is less densely populated.
These cords are elongated branching bands of
the lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages.
They drain into the hilar efferent lymphatic
vessels. Plasma cells are also found in the medul-
lary cords.

Structure and Function of Immune System
After cell division, B cells undergo a rigorous
selection process where more than 90% of cells
die through apoptosis. When the lymph takes an
antigen into a regional node, it is trapped and
presented by interdigitating dendritic cells present
in the paracortex region, along with class II MHC
molecules, resulting in the TH cells activation.
The primary activation of the B cells takes place
in the paracortex region, rich in T cells. After the
activation of Th and B cells, they form small foci,
consisting of proliferating B cells mainly near the
margins of the paracortex. Some of the B cells in
the foci distinguish into plasma cells that secrete
IgM and IgG.
Functions
Lymph nodes act as ﬁlters for the lymph, the ﬂuid
and cellular content of the lymphocytic circula-
tory system. They also provide sites forming ring-
shaped structures composed of lymphocytes,
monocytes and dendritic cells for initiating
immune responses. In lymphoid cells, plasma
cells producing antibodies were generated after
the activation of B cells by the antigen. However,
only a small fraction of activated B cells ﬁnd their
way to enter the germinal centres. These B cells
undergo a few processes of cell division during
which the genes mutate at a high level that
encodes for antibodies.
Spleen
The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ. It is a
large, ovoid secondary lymphoid organ located
high in the left abdominal cavity. The spleen
parenchyma is heterogeneous and is composed
of white and red pulp. It is surrounded by a
capsule made of connective tissue. Unlike the
lymph nodes, the spleen is not supplied by lym-
phatic vessels. Instead, blood-borne antigens and
lymphocytes are carried into the spleen through
the splenic artery. The narrow central arterioles,
derived from the splenic artery after multiple
branching, are surrounded by lymphoid tissue
(periarteriolar lymphatic sheath). T lymphocytes
are present in the lymphatic sheath of the white
pulp surrounding the arteriole. B lymphocytes are
distributed primarily in the germinal centre,
perifollicular area and mantle layer, which lies
close to the arterioles peripherally.
Functions
The spleen plays a signiﬁcant role in mounting
immune responses to antigens in the bloodstream.
The circulating antigens are trapped by the
macrophages present in the marginal zone.
These macrophages then process the antigen,
migrate deeper into the white pulp and initiate
the immune response by interacting with T and
B lymphocytes.
The spleen also facilitates in ﬁltering or
clearing of (1) infectious organisms, (2) aged or
defectively formed elements (e.g. spherocytes,
ovalocytes) and (3) particulate matter from
the peripheral blood. In addition, the spleen
traps blood-borne antigens and microbes. The
macrophages lining up the splenic cords perform
the primary ﬁltering function.
Clinical signiﬁcance of splenectomy: In chil-
dren, splenectomy often leads to an increased
incidence of bacterial sepsis caused primarily
by
Streptococcus
pneumoniae,
Neisseria
meningitidis and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. I
adults, the adverse effects are less, although, in
some adults, it makes the host more susceptible to
blood-borne bacterial infections.
Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissues
(MALTs)
MALTs consist of the lymphoid tissues of the
intestinal tract, genitourinary tract, tracheobron-
chial tree and mammary glands. The MALT is
non-capsulated and contains both T and B
lymphocytes, and the latter predominate. Struc-
turally, these tissues include clusters of lymphoid
cells in the lamina propria of intestinal villi,
tonsils, appendix and Peyer patches.
MALTs play a signiﬁcant role in the defence
system of humans. This is evidenced by the large
population of plasma cells producing antibodies
in MALT, which exceeds the number of plasma
cells in the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes

combined. In addition to spleen and lymph
nodes,
MALTs
facilitate
interaction
among
circulating leucocytes. Such lymphoid tissues
present in the gut from the adenoids and tonsils
to the follicles in the colon are called the
gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and
those in the respiratory tract are called the
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT).
The follicles present in the Peyer patch are highly
rich in B cells that differentiate to produce IgA
antibodies in plasma cells. M cells, specialised
epithelial cells, are found predominantly in the
dome epithelia of Peyer patches, mainly in the
ileum. These cells engulf the bacteria, virus, small
particles and so on and transport them to the
sub-mucosal macrophages, where these materials
are presented to T and B lymphocytes after
processing.

Structure and Function of Immune System
Lymphocytes
The lymphocytes occupy a very special place
among the leucocytes. They make up 20–40%
of total blood leucocytes and 99% of the cells
found in the lymph. The lymphocytes consist of
heterogeneous populations of cells that differ sig-
niﬁcantly in terms of origin, lifespan, preferred
areas of settlement within the lymphoid organs,
surface structure and function. They differentiate
from stem cells in the foetal liver, bone marrow
and thymus into two main functional classes: B
cells and T cells. They are found in the peripheral
blood and all lymphoid tissues.
Classification
The lymphocytes, depending on the cell mem-
brane components and functions, are subdivided
into three types: T cells, B cells and Natural Killer
(NK) cells.
Lymphocyte Structure
A typical small lymphocyte is 6–10 μm in diame-
ter with a large round nucleus. The chromatin is
dark and dense, and the cytoplasm appears as a
thin rim around the nucleus. The large lympho-
cyte is 14–16 μm from which null cells arise. Of
about 1012 lymphocytes that are present in the
human body, approximately 109 are replaced
daily by fresh lymphocytes.
Lymphocytic Recirculation
Central or primary lymphoid organs are the major
sites for lymphopoiesis. These organs have the
ability to produce progenitor cells of the lympho-
cytic lineage. These are the organs in which pre-
cursor lymphocytes proliferate, develop and
differentiate from lymphoid stem cells to become
ICCs. These cells mix together and circulate in
the body, which is known as “lymphocytic recir-
culation”. Whenever a foreign particulate antigen
enters the body, it is carried to the local and
regional lymph nodes by lymphatics, where it is
imprisoned. In lymph nodes, the lymphocytes
react with antigens and produce an immune
response. Lymphocytes are the only leucocytes
that continuously migrate from tissues back into
the blood using the lymphatic system and create
complete
blood–tissues–lymph–blood
circula-
tion. Generally, the majority of the lymphocytes
complete this circulation several times during
their lifespan. A cycle of circulation requires
approximately 1 or 2 days. These recirculating
lymphocytes will be picked by lymphoid tissues
whenever necessary. T cells mainly constitute the
circulating lymphocytes, and B cells are more
sessile in nature.
Functions
The major cellular components of the immune
response are both T and B lymphocytes. They
participate in immune reactions due to their
ability to interact speciﬁcally with antigenic
substances
and
react
to
non-self-antigenic
determinants. They also contribute to the memory
of the immune system.
Immune Responses
The lymphocytes educate themselves in a central
lymphoid organ to become ICCs. Naïve cells are
mature T and B cells prior to the antigen expo-
sure. The naïve cells can be activated upon stim-
ulation with a speciﬁc antigen to produce a
speciﬁc immune response and immunological
memory. Lymphocytes carry surface receptors
that will help in recognising speciﬁc antigens.
The interaction between an antigen and ICC
may result in immunological tolerance or induc-
tion of immune response. The immune responses
are of various types, and they depend on the
antigen and the type of immune cells interacting
with the antigen. For example, stimulated T cells
produce cytokines and induce CMI, whereas the
B cell stimulation leads to a humoral immune
response.
Surface Markers
The surface antigen markers present on the
lymphocytes help understand the cell differentia-
tion
stage
and
functional
properties.
These
markers denote the functional properties and the
stages of differentiation of the cells.
Owing to the advancement in recombinant
DNA technology, it became easy to identify vast

numbers of surface antigens present on various
lymphocytes
through
monoclonal
antibodies.
Hence, depending on the cluster of monoclonal
antibodies interacting with a particular antigen,
cluster
differentiation
(CD)
numbers
were
designated. The CD number helps identify a spe-
ciﬁc subset of lymphocytes, which is important in
understanding an individual’s immunological sta-
tus in certain infections such as HIV. Thus, far
more
than
150
CDs
have
been
identiﬁed.
Table 11.1 includes a list of a few CDs and their
association with different types of immune cells.
Cells of the Lymphoreticular System
135
Differences Between T and B
Lymphocyte Cells
The CD markers can be used as a sole, clear
marker
to
differentiate
between
T
and
B
lymphocytes; T cell possesses CD3 receptor,
whereas B cells have Ig molecule on their
surface. Similarly, many other methods are also
available.
Rosette formation with sheep RBCs (SRBC
or E rosette) can be seen in T cells but not with B
cells. Here, CD2 antigen on T lymphocyte
interacts with CD2 receptors present on the
RBC surface to form a rosette. The B cell surface
has a C3 (CR2) receptor, which binds to sheep
RBCs coated with antibodies and complement
(EAC rosettes). T cells lack this receptor, but
Epstein–Barr virus possesses a CR2 receptor.
Mature B cells have immunoglobulin molecules
on their surface, which will help interact with
speciﬁc antigens, but T cells do not have Ig on
their surface; instead, they have T-cell receptors
(TCR). The B cells have distinct, separate Ig
surface
molecules
for
a
particular
antigen.
Approximately 105 Ig molecules are present on
each B cell. The IgM is the ﬁrst Ig to appear on B
cells, followed by IgG, IgA, IgE or IgD. Thymus-
speciﬁc antigens are present only in T cells but
not in B cells.

seen after interaction with bacterial endotoxins,
Cowan 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus and
Epstein–Barr virus. Under electron microscopy,
T cells do not show any cytoplasmic projection,
but B cells possess an enormous number of
microvilli and a widespread ﬁlamentous surface.
Differences between T cells, B cells and
macrophages are summarised in Table 11.2.
T Cell
T-Cell Maturation
Thymus-derived cells, T lymphocytes or T cells,
are so designated because the thymus plays a
crucial role in their differentiation. They are the
key players in adaptive immunity. They partici-
pate directly in immune responses and orchestrate
and regulate the activities of other cells. T-cell
precursors migrate from the yolk sac, bone mar-
row and liver to primary lymphoid organs such as
the thymus during the early embryonic and post-
natal stages of life. In the thymus, progenitor T
cells undergo differentiation, and the initial
identiﬁable cell in the T-cell lineage possesses a
CD7 molecule on its surface; subsequently, they

T lymphocytes show the following features:
(1)
They
constitute
65–80%
of
the
small
lymphocytes present in the circulation, (2) are
usually present in the inner sub-cortical regions
but not seen in the germinal centres of the lymph
nodes, (3) have a longer lifespan (months to
years) than B lymphocytes, (4) are stimulated to
divide after exposing to certain mitogens, such as
phytohemagglutinin
or
concanavalin
A
and
(5) most human T cells have receptors for sheep
erythrocytes on their surface which help them in
rosette formation. This property is used to iden-
tify T cells in a mixed population of cells.
T-Cell Receptors (TCR)
These are heterodimer glycoproteins expressed
on the T-cell surface. TCR for antigen is made
of two polypeptides, namely, alpha and beta.
These peptides are associated with CD3 proteins
(Fig. 11.3). Single T cell has unique TCR on their
surface; hence, an individual possesses hundreds
of millions of T cells. Activated T cells and
activated B cells produce many cells speciﬁc to
those antigens.
T-cell alpha and beta polypeptides show many
similarities to immunoglobulin heavy chain in the
following ways: (1) the genes coding for T-cell
polypeptides are formed by rearrangement of
multiple regions of DNA. (2) there are V (vari-
able), D (diversity), J (joining) and C (constant)
segments. These segments can rearrange in vari-
ous
combinations
to
yield
more
than
107
diversiﬁed receptor proteins. (3) RAG-1 and
RAG-2 genes catalyse the gene rearrangement
process. These two genes are similar in T and B
cells and encode the recombinase enzymes. How-
ever, they differ from immunoglobulins by hav-
ing two chains rather than four chains in
immunoglobulins. They also recognise antigens
only in conjunction with MHC proteins, whereas
immunoglobulins recognise free antigens.
Immature T cells: These cells carrying TCR for
self-antigens are destroyed in the thymus dur-
ing the early course of life. This is the basis of

Cells of the Lymphoreticular System

self-tolerance, that is, no immune response to
autoantigens. However, T cells capable of
interacting with self-antigens are produced
during their entire life, but these T-cell clones
are regularly deleted by the antigen-speciﬁc
suppressor cells to check on autoimmunity.
Mature T cells: These cells consist of many CD
molecules on them (CD 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 etc.) but
upon functional maturity, they acquire a spe-
ciﬁc set of CDs. Based on the presence of CD
molecules, T lymphocytes can be divided into
two
major
subsets,
namely,
CD
82
4+
(T helper cell) and CD 8+ 42 (T cytotoxic
cells). These mature cells then develop MHC
restriction; that is, T helper cells respond
only when
antigens
are
presented along
with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class
II molecules, and T cytotoxic cells respond
only when antigens are presented along with
HLA class I molecules. Both CD4 and CD8 T
cells have TCRαβ on their surface, which
facilitates T-cell interaction with processed
antigens.
Certain T cells possess TCR γδ; their actual
role in the immune response is unclear. However,
it is believed that these cells participate in innate
immune response, particularly against intracellu-
lar bacterial pathogens, epithelial lining defence
and also in homeostasis. Overall, cells bearing
TCR γδ are considered immune surveillance
cells.
During T-cell maturation, surface antigens
progressively change, and these changes can be
identiﬁed by analysing their surface markers. The
identiﬁcation of CD markers has got a diagnostic
implication. For example, T-cell malignancies
can be classiﬁed into acute or chronic based on
the presence of premature or mature T cells,
respectively. Similarly, in HIV infection, CD4
count plays a signiﬁcant role in understanding
antiviral therapy efﬁcacy.
Types of T Cells
Based on their functions, target cells and surface
markers, the T cells can be classiﬁed into effector
T cells and regulatory T cells (Fig. 11.4).
Depending on whether they have CD4 or CD8
proteins on their surface, T cells are subdivided
into two major groups: CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T
cells. Mature T cells have either CD4 or CD8
proteins, but never both. The regulation of
immune responses is mediated primarily by
helper
(CD4+)
T
cells,
which
produce
interleukins.
Various
effector
functions
are
mediated primarily by cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells,
which kill allografts, tumour cells and virus-
infected cells.

138

Structure and Function of Immune System
Fig. 11.4 Different T cells and their functions
Effector T Cells
Effector T cells are the most important cells
which perform immune response functions. Cur-
rent knowledge has revealed that they can
modulate both innate and adaptive immune
responses. When the naïve T cells differentiate
into effector T cells, there is a complete change in
the cytokine types produced by these cells. The
new set of cytokine production is driven mainly
by activated cells of the innate and adaptive
immune systems.
T Helper or CD4+ T Cells
CD4 cells are also known as helper T (Th) cells.
They constitute about 65% of peripheral T cells
and are found mainly in the thymic medulla,
tonsils and blood. CD4 displayed on the surfaces
of these T cells recognises a non-peptide-binding
portion of MHC class II molecules. Therefore,
CD4+ T cells are only limited to recognising
MHC
class
II
complexes.
The
helper
T
lymphocytes
are
involved
in
inducing
and
regulating immune responses.
CD4+ T cells perform the following helper
functions: (1) The CD4 cell helps transform B
cells to plasma cells, (2) helps CD8+ T cells
convert into activated cytotoxic T cells and
(3) helps mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity
reactions
through
macrophages.
The
main
functions of helper T cells are summarised as
follows: (4) help in the antigen-speciﬁc activation
of B cells and effector T cells, (5) h-1 cytokines
activate cytotoxic inﬂammatory and delayed
hypersensitivity reactions, (6) Th-2 cells help in

the production of interleukins which encourage
the production of antibodies, especially IgE and
(7) Th-2 cytokines are associated with regulation
of strong antibody and allergic responses.
Cells of the Lymphoreticular System
139
All these functions are mediated by Th-1 and
Th-2 cells—the two subpopulations of CD4+ T
cells. The Th-1 cells activate cytotoxic T cells by
producing IL-2. They help develop hypersensitiv-
ity responses by producing IL-2 and gamma inter-
feron primarily. The Th-2 cells perform B-cell
helper functions by producing IL-4 and IL-5
primarily.
The balance between Th-1 and Th-2 cells is
regulated
by
gamma
interferon
and
IL-12.
Gamma interferon inhibits the production of
Th-2 cells, whereas IL-12 increases the number
of Th-1 cells, thereby increasing host defence
against microorganisms that are controlled by a
delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Table 11.3
shows a comparison of Th-1 and Th-2 cells.
T Cytotoxic or CD8+ T Cells
CD8+ T cells are also known as cytotoxic T
(Tc) and suppressor T (Ts) cells. They account
for approximately one-third of all mature CD3+
cells. They are found mainly in the human bone
marrow and gut lymphoid tissue. CD8+ T
glycoprotein expressed on the surfaces of these
T cells recognises a non-peptide-binding portion
of MHC class I molecules. Hence, CD8+ T cells
are
restricted
to
recognising
MHC
class
I
complexes.

CD8+
T
cells
perform
mainly
cytotoxic
functions. They kill (1) virus-infected cells,
(2) allograft cells and (3) tumour cells. Two
pathways help in the mediation of T-cell-
mediated cytotoxicity. One pathway releases
perforin proteins which form channels in the
targeted cell membranes. These channels facili-
tate the diffusion of enzymes such as granzymes
(serine esterases) into the cytoplasm. The exact
mechanism of granzymes in inducing apoptosis
has not been well established, but granzyme-
induced apoptosis is a Ca2+-dependent process.
Another pathway depends on signals delivered by
the cytotoxic cell to the target cell, which requires
cell-to-cell
contact.
This
pathway
is
Ca2+
independent.
The ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is approx-
imately 2:1 in normal human peripheral blood.
This may be signiﬁcantly altered in immunodeﬁ-
ciency,
autoimmune
and
other
disorders.
Differences between CD4 and CD8 T cells are
summarised in Table 11.4.

Structure and Function of Immune System
Memory T Cells
As the name suggests, Memory T cells confer
host immunity with the ability to respond rapidly
and vigorously for many years after the initial
exposure
to
a
microbe
or
other
foreign
substances.
The memory produced against a speciﬁc anti-
gen shows the following characteristics: (1) mem-
ory cells survive for many years and have the
capacity to multiply, (2) a large number of mem-
ory cells are produced following a primary infec-
tion, and consequently during secondary response
is enhanced and is greater than the primary
response, (3) a small quantity of antigens is sufﬁ-
cient to activate memory cells and requires less
co-stimulation than that of naïve and unactivated
T cells and (4) greater amounts of interleukins are
produced by activated memory cells than that of
naïve T cells when they are ﬁrst activated.
Regulatory T Cells
Treg cells have CD4+ molecules on their surface.
The main functions of these cells are regulation of
immune response and deletion of cell clones
which are active against autoantigens. TGF β is
the major cytokine produced by the suppressor T
cells.
Activation of T Cells
Recognition of complex on the surface of
antigen-presenting
cells
(APCs),
such
as
macrophages and dendritic cells, consisting of
both the antigen and a class II MHC protein by
TCR present on T cells, is most important for
activating helper T cells. Two signals are required
to activate T cells. The ﬁrst is the interaction of
the antigen and the MHC protein with the T-cell-
receptor-speciﬁc antigen. IL-1 secreted by the
macrophages is also necessary for efﬁcient helper
T-cell activation. The second is a co-stimulatory
signal required for activation of T cells.
Functions of T Cells
T cells perform two crucial functions: cytotoxic-
ity and delayed hypersensitivity.
Cytotoxicity activity of T cells is required
primarily to destroy virus-infected cells and
tumour cells. It also plays an important role in
graft rejection. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions
against antigens of many intracellular pathogens
are mediated by the CD4 cells, particularly the
Th-1 subset cells and macrophages. The CD4
cells produce interleukins, such as gamma inter-
feron, macrophage activation factor and macro-
phage inhibition factor, which mediate delayed
hypersensitivity reactions.
B Cells
B Cell Maturation
The
bone-marrow-derived
lymphocytes
are
known as B lymphocytes or B cells. Plasma
cells are derived from mature B cells. Both B
cells and plasma cells synthesise and secrete
immunoglobulin. The bursa of Fabricius, a lym-
phoid organ present near the caudal end of the
gut, plays a signiﬁcant role in differentiating B
cells in birds. However, a mammalian equivalent
to the bursa is yet to be found. Here the early
stages of maturation of these lymphocytes occur
in the bone marrow.
Nearly
30%
of
the
recirculating
small
lymphocytes are composed of B cells. The B
cells have a short lifespan of days or weeks.
Nearly 109 B cells are produced every day. B
cells are found in the germinal centres of the
lymph nodes, in the white pulp of the spleen and
in the MALT. B cells perform two important
functions. First, they differentiate into plasma
cells and produce antibodies. Second, they can
present antigens to helper T cells.
The clonal selection theory explains the ori-
gin of antibody formation. According to this pos-
tulation, each immunologically competent B cell
possesses receptors for either IgM or IgD that can
combine with one antigen or closely related
antigens. After binding the antigen, the B cell is
activated to proliferate and form a clone of cells.
Selected B cells are transformed into plasma cells
that secrete antibodies speciﬁc to the antigen.
Plasma cells synthesise the immunoglobulin
with the same antigenic speciﬁcity as those car-
ried by activated B cells. The same clonal selec-
tion also occurs with T cells.
B-cell precursors, during embryogenesis, ﬁrst
proliferate and develop in the foetal liver. From

there, they migrate to the bone marrow, the main
site of B-cell maturation in adults. Unlike T cells,
they do not require the thymus for maturation.
Pre-B cells exhibit only M heavy chains in the
cytoplasm
but
do
not
have
surface
immunoglobulins and light chains. Pre-B cells
are found in the bone marrow, whereas B cells
are found in the circulation. Owing to allelic
exclusion, individual B cells are committed to
producing a single class of immunoglobulin
molecules consisting of either kappa or lambda
light chain. These B cells produce antibodies to a
speciﬁc antigenic epitope. B cells develop immu-
nological tolerance towards self-antigens by
clonal deletion or anergy during the initial
developmental stage.
Cells of the Lymphoreticular System
141
Fig. 11.5 B-cell maturation process
B cells mature in two phases: antigen-inde-
pendent phase, which consists of stem cells and
pre-B
cells,
and
antigen-dependent
phase,
which consists of the cells such as activated B
cells
and
plasma
cells
that
proliferate
on
interactions of antigen with B cells (Fig. 11.5).

142
11
Structure and Function of Immune System
Types of B Cells
Plasma Cells
Activation of B cells leads to the production of
many plasma cells. Subsequently, the plasma
cells
produce
a
large
number
of
speciﬁc
immunoglobulins complementary to the epitope
of the antigen. Plasma cells originate from termi-
nally differentiated B cells. Plasma cells are oval
or egg-shaped structures characterised by a stel-
late (star-like pattern) nucleus, non-staining Golgi
and basophilic cytoplasm.
The main function of the plasma cells is
to
produce
and
secrete
all
the
classes
of
immunoglobulins into the ﬂuids around the
cells.
They
secrete
thousands
of
antibody
molecules per second, speciﬁc to the epitope
of the antigen, for a few days and then die.
They,
however,
do
not
express
membrane
immunoglobulins. They divide very poorly, if at
all, and are usually found in the bone marrow and
the perimucosal lymphoid tissues. They have a
short lifespan of 30 days, during which they pro-
duce large quantities of immunoglobulins.
Memory B Cells
Some of the activated B cells produce memory
cells, which remain in a stage of quiescence
for months or years. Most memory B cells
have surface IgG that acts as the antigen receptor,
but some even have surface IgM. These quiescent
memory cells are activated rapidly on re-exposure
to antigen. The interleukins secreted by the mem-
ory T cells facilitate the memory B cells to pro-
duce antibodies. The memory cells are helpful in
rapid antibody production during the secondary
immune responses.
B1 Cells
The B1 cells are a separate lineage of B cells
and possess the T-cell marker CD5 on their sur-
face. These are predominant in foetal and initial
stages of neonatal life. The B1 cell precursors
migrate from the foetal liver to the peritoneal
cavity.
Further,
they
multiply
and
secrete
polyreactive
antibodies
(low-afﬁnity
IgM),
including autoantibodies at higher concentrations.
These T- independent natural IgM antibodies are
produced without any antigen stimuli and may
contribute
to
the
initiation
of
autoimmune
disorders.
Activation of B Cells
Activation of B cells to produce the full range of
antibodies ﬁrst requires recognition of the epitope
by the T-cell-antigen receptor and the production
of IL-4 and IL-5 by the helper T cells. In addition,
it also requires other co-stimulatory interactions
of CD28 on the T cells with B7 on the B cells.
The CD28–B7 interaction is essential to produce
IL-2. It also includes CD40L on the T cells, which
must interact with CD40 on the B cells. The
CD40L–CD40 interaction is essential for class
switching from IgM to IgG and switching
between other immunoglobulin classes.
Null Cells
Null cells are a small section of lymphocytes, also
called null lymphocytes, synthesised in the bone
marrow. Unlike T- and B-lymphocytes which
carry speciﬁc surface markers, null cells do not
carry these speciﬁc markers. These cells lack
immunologic memory and speciﬁcity.
Among lymphocytes, about 5–10% of cells are
null cells which lack the features of T and B cells.
These cells are larger than small lymphocytes,
almost double the size, and also called large
granular lymphocytes (LGL) containing sunken
nuclei and profuse cytoplasm with azurophilic
granules, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus. LGL cells are a
heterogeneous
group
with
different
surface
markers and functional properties. Natural killer
(NK) cells are the most important type among
LGL, followed by antibody-dependent cytotoxic
cells (ADCC) and lymphokine-activated killer
(LAK) cells.
Natural Killer (NK) Cells
NK cells are specialised in killing a certain group
of target cells, mainly virus-infected host cells,
foreign cells and malignant cells. These are
non-phagocytic, non-adherent to the surface and
provide the ﬁrst line of defence against infection
and act spontaneously without prior sensitisation;

therefore, it is considered an innate immune
response. The thymus is not required for the
development. The NK cells are also involved in
the regulatory mechanisms such as reciprocal
interaction
with
dendritic
cells,
T
cells,
macrophages and so on. However, their activities
are not enhanced by prior exposure and are not
speciﬁc to any virus.
Cells of the Lymphoreticular System
143
NK cells comprise approximately 5–10% of
peripheral lymphocytes and are found in the
spleen and peripheral blood. The number remains
normal even in severe combined immunodeﬁ-
ciency disease. They lack both T-cell (CD3) and
surface IgM and IgD (surface immunoglobulin)
markers. They also lack immunologic memory
and, unlike cytotoxic T cells, do not have any
TCRs, and the killing of target cells does not
require recognition of MHC proteins. These
cells do not carry antigen receptors of any kind
but can recognise antibody molecules bound to
target cells and destroy those cells using the exact
general mechanisms involved in T-lymphocyte
cytotoxicity. They also have a cognition mecha-
nism that allows them to destroy tumour cells and
virus-infected cells.
NK cells develop within the bone marrow and
lack TCR but possess another set of receptors
called killer activation receptors and killer inhibi-
tion receptors. They also possess NK T cells,
another subset of T cells, which share some func-
tional characteristics with the NK cells. However,
unlike NK cells, these NK T cells are stimulated
by lipids, glycolipids and hydrophobic peptides
presented by a non-classical class I molecule
CD1D and secrete large amounts of cytokines,
especially IL-4.
Functions of the NK Cells
The main functions of NK cells are to kill virus-
infected cells and tumours. They do so by secret-
ing cytotoxins such as perforins and granzymes
similar to those of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and
also by FasL-mediated apoptosis. They kill the
viruses without speciﬁc antibodies by a mecha-
nism called ADCC. Both IL-12 and gamma
interferons are potent activators of NK cells.
Antibody-Dependent Cytotoxic Cells (ADCC)
These cells were called killer (K) cells initially
but are now classiﬁed as NK cells. They have
surface receptors for the Fc part of Ig and are a
subpopulation of LGLs. They can lyse cells
sensitised with IgG antibodies in a distinct mech-
anism different from Tc cells.
Lymphokine-Activated Killer (LAK) Cells
These are NK lymphocytes that are treated with
interleukin-2 (IL-2) and are speciﬁcally cytotoxic
to a wide range of tumour cells. IL-2 is also
demonstrated to be a growth factor for NK cells.
These LAK cells can be used in treating some
tumours (e.g. renal cell carcinoma).
Phagocytic Cells
Phagocytosis is a crucial defence mechanism in
animals by which a cell engulfs and destroys
invading particles such as bacteria and fungi.
Phagocytosis is carried out by a phagosome that
may be certain types of WBCs or their derivatives
like mononuclear macrophages/polymorphonu-
clear macrophages. The process begins with a
macrophage or neutrophil recognising the invad-
ing organism and engulﬁng it to form a phago-
cytic vesicle or phagosome.
Macrophages
Macrophages measure about 20–80 μm and are
the largest lymphoid cells in peripheral blood.
Monocytes undergo a series of changes or differ-
entiate to become macrophages. They are found
in all tissues, more commonly in the liver, spleen
and
connective
tissues.
Macrophages
are
involved in different functions and are named
according to their location, for example, adipose
tissue macrophages, Kupffer cells, Langerhans
cells, osteoclasts and so on. Mononuclear macro-
phage cells originate from precursor cells in the
bone marrow and later become monocytes. Mul-
tinucleated cells and epithelioid cells seen in
granulomatous inﬂammatory lesions such as
tuberculosis originate from mononuclear macro-
phage cells.

144
11
Structure and Function of Immune System
Clinical Significance of Macrophages
These are essential in eliminating cell debris and
dead cells. In addition, macrophages, along with
dendritic cells, play a crucial role in initiating
immune response by presenting antigens. The
antigen is presented to the corresponding helper
T cells after digestion by the macrophages.
Macrophages express many surface receptors,
including
Ia
proteins,
Fc
part
of
IgG,
activated complement components and various
lymphokines. Mac I (macrophage-1 antigen or
macrophage integrin) protein antigens are found
on mouse macrophages; similarly, MI markers
are found on human macrophages closely related
to CR3, a cell receptor for C3 components.
Macrophage Participation in Immune
Response
Macrophage participates in the induction and
execution of the speciﬁc immune response. The
antigen is trapped and presented in optimal con-
centration to the lymphocytes. If the concentra-
tion of antigen presented is too high, it may
produce immunological tolerance, and if it is too
low, it may not be immunogenic. For certain
antigens, antigen processing and presentation by
macrophages are required to generate antibodies.
Both T cells and macrophages require surface
determinants coded by the same MHC genes for
the processing and presentation of antigens. After
the antigen is presented to the surface of the
infected macrophage, MHC class II stimulates
the T cell. Conversely, if a different MHC antigen
is presented, T cells are not stimulated; this con-
dition is called MHC restriction.
The
phagocytic
activity
is
greater
in
macrophages, particularly after activation by
soluble
mediators
released
during
immune
responses, than in monocytes. Differentiation of
monocyte into a tissue macrophage involves
several changes. The macrophage enlarges 5–10
folds, with intracellular organelles of the cells
increasing and exhibiting complexity. Further,
the cell attains high phagocytic ability and
produces hydrolytic enzymes at higher levels.
The cell also starts the process of secreting a
variety of soluble factors.

Macrophage-like cells have a diverse set of
functions in different tissues and hence are
named based on the location of the tissue. For
example, (1) histiocytes in connective tissues,
(2) osteoclasts in the bone, (3) microglial cells
in the brain, (4) alveolar macrophages in the lung,
(5) Kupffer cells in the liver and (6) mesangial
cells in the kidney.
Functions of Macrophages
Macrophages perform three
main functions:
phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine
production (Table 11.5).
1. Phagocytosis:
Phagocytosis
of
bacteria,
viruses and other foreign particles is the most
important
function
of
macrophages.
The
macrophages on their cell surfaces have Fc
receptors that interact with the Fc component
of the IgG, thereby facilitating ingestion of
the opsonised organisms. They also have
receptors for C3b, another important opsonin.
After ingestion, the phagosome containing the
microbe fuses with a lysosome. The microbe
within the phagolysosome is killed by reactive
oxygen, reactive nitrogen compounds and
lysosomal enzymes.
2. Antigen presentation: After ingestion and
degradation of foreign materials, the antigen
fragments are presented on the macrophage
cell surface in conjunction with class II MHC
proteins for interaction with the TCR of CD4+
helper T cells. Degradation of the foreign

protein is stopped following the association of
antigen with the class II MHC proteins in the
cytoplasm. This is followed by the transporta-
tion of the complex to the cell surface by
transporter proteins.
3. Cytokine production: Macrophages produce
several cytokines, including IL-1, TNF and
IL-8. IL-1 plays a vital role in activating helper
T cells, whereas TNF plays an important medi-
ator in inﬂammatory reactions. IL-8 attracts
neutrophils and T cells to the site of infection.
Microphages
These are the polymorphonuclear leucocytes;
these
include
neutrophils,
eosinophils
and
basophils. Both neutrophils and eosinophils are
phagocytic, whereas basophils are not.
Neutrophils
These are the predominant phagocytic cells
observed during acute infections. Phagocytic
activity increases in the presence of opsonin,
whereas the phagocytic activity of neutrophils is
non-speciﬁc in nature.
Eosinophils
These play an important role in defence against
parasitic infections, though their phagocytic role
is signiﬁcantly lower than neutrophils. They are
commonly found in tissues rather than blood; the
important features of eosinophil are the presence
of small, round homogeneous and large ovoid
granules. The granules consist of various hydro-
lytic enzymes, which help in the extracellular
killing of large parasitic cells.
Basophils
These cells are found in blood and tissues (mast
cells). They are non-phagocytic granulocytes that
function by releasing pharmacologically active
substances (histamine, serotonin and other hydro-
lytic enzymes) from their cytoplasmic granules.
These substances play a signiﬁcant role in certain
allergic responses.
Mast cells are derived from the myeloid stem
cells and differ from basophils. They are present
widely in various tissues, such as the mucosal
epithelial tissue of the respiratory, digestive, and
genitourinary tracts, connective tissues of many
organs and the skin. Mast cells possess cytoplas-
mic
granules
in
large
numbers,
similar
to
circulating basophils, which include histamine
and other pharmacologically active compounds.
These cells play a signiﬁcant function in the
development of allergies in combination with
blood basophils.
Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)
Antigen-presenting
cells
(APCs)
include
macrophages, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes.
These APCs possess MHC class II molecules on
their surface. T helper cell only recognises if the
processed antigens are presented with MHC II
molecules of APCs. In turn, T helper cells acti-
vate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.
Dendritic Cells
Dendritic cells resemble neuronal dendrites with
many long, narrow processes; hence, they are
called so. These long processes are beneﬁcial in
making efﬁcient contacts with foreign materials.
They
are
mainly
found
in
the
skin
(e.g. Langerhans cells) and the mucosa, from
where they migrate to local lymph nodes for the
presentation of antigen to helper T cells.
Dendritic cells play a vital role in primary
immune response where they present the antigen
into T cells. They are derived from bone marrow
cells and express class II MHC proteins on their
surface and also present antigen to CD4+ T cells.
They have little or no role to play in phagocytosis.
They also serve as professional APCs, although
macrophages and B cells are the major APCs.
Four types of dendritic cells are known:
(1) Langerhans cells, (2) interstitial dendritic
cells, (3) myeloid cells and (4) lymphoid dendritic
cells. All these cells constitutively express high
levels of both class II MHC molecules and
members of the co-stimulatory B7 family. The
mature and immature forms of Langerhans cells
and interstitial dendritic cells travel to drain in the
lymph nodes, after a microbial invasion or during

the inﬂammation process. These cells present the
antigen to the Th cells, which helps initiate
immune responses.

Structure and Function of Immune System
Follicular Dendritic Cells
These cells are similar to the dendritic cells except
for their sites of presence and functions. These
cells are present in B-cell-containing germinal
centres of the follicles in the spleen and lymph
nodes. These cells do not present antigen to
helper T cells but combine with antigen-antibody
complexes by Fc receptors found on their
surfaces.
Abnormalities of Immune Cells
These are generally inherited defects in speciﬁc
or
non-speciﬁc
immune
systems.
Affected
individuals are susceptible to different infections
depending upon the nature of the abnormality.
Some examples due to abnormalities of immune
cells include chronic granulomatous disease
caused by the defective intracellular killing mech-
anism of phagocytes, DiGeorge syndrome where
congenital aplasia of the thymus occurs and so on.
Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC)
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
was ﬁrst detected as the genetic locus encoding
the
glycoprotein
molecules
(transplantation
antigens) responsible for the rapid rejection of
tissue grafts transplanted between genetically
non-identical individuals. Gorer, in 1930, was
the ﬁrst to identify the antigens responsible for
allograft rejection that led to the discovery of a
major histocompatible complex. In mice, he
demonstrated two blood group antigens (antigen
1 and antigen 2). Antigen 1 was found in all
strains of mice, whereas antigen 2 was found in
certain strains of mice and was responsible for
allograft rejection. This was named H2 antigen
and was found to be the major histocompatible
antigen. This antigen was coded by a closely
linked multiallelic cluster of genes called the
MHC, named as H2 complex.
The
name
histocompatibility
was
coined
because this discovery was made based on the
transplantation experiments. The alloantigens
present on the surface of the human leucocytes
determine the histocompatibility during trans-
plantation. Hence, human MHC molecules are
synonymously called HLA and MHC complexes
are termed HLA complex (Fig. 11.6).
Histocompatible antigen denotes the cell sur-
face antigens that induce immune responses to an
incompatible host, resulting in allograft rejection.
The MHC in humans is known as the HLA
complex. In humans, these alloantigens are pres-
ent on the surface of leucocytes and are called
HLA and the set of genes encoding for them is
named the HLA complex. Carbohydrate antigens
of erythrocytes (blood groups) and glycoprotein
antigens of cell membranes are the two major
transplantation
antigens
of
humans.
Snell,
Dauseset and Benacerraf (1980) were awarded
the Nobel Prize for their work on MHC and
genetic control of immune responses.
Functions of MHC
The MHC performs many functions. It kills virus-
infected cells and tumour cells. In addition, it
takes part in the non-speciﬁc killing of virus-
infected cells and tumour cells. The killing of
cells is independent of antigen presentation by
MHC proteins. The killing of cells is carried out
by perforins and granzymes, which cause apopto-
sis of the target cell. Killing is activated by the
failure of a cell to present antigen with class I
MHC or by reducing class I MHC proteins on the
cell surface.
Classes of Proteins
Almost all animal species, including human
beings, possess these genes on a segment of a
chromosome pair, coding for three different clas-
ses of proteins. Class I proteins are responsible
for histocompatibility, allograft acceptance and
rejection. Class II proteins play an important

role in the regulation of immune response.
Finally, class III molecules involve components
of the complement system such as the C2, C4 and
B factor.
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
147

HLA Complex
In humans, the HLA complex of genes is located
on the short arm of chromosome 6, containing
several genes that are critical to immune function
(Figs. 11.6 and 11.7). The HLA complex of genes
is classiﬁed as Class I (HLA-A, HLA-B and
HLA-C), Class II (HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and
HLA-DR.) found within the HLA-D region of
the HLA complex, and Class III (TNFs alpha
and beta cells) complement loci which encode
for C2, C4 and factor B of the complement sys-
tem, respectively.
A locus means the position where a particular
gene is located on the chromosome. HLA loci
are usually multiallelic, meaning that genes pres-
ent on the locus can be any one of several alter-
native forms. There are 24 alleles at the HLA-A
locus and 50 at the HLA-B locus. Each allele
expresses a distinct antigen. The HLA system is
pleomorphic, and every person inherits one set of
HLA genes from each parent. The WHO ofﬁcial
Committee has recommended a set of guidelines
for
the
nomenclature
of
the
HLA
system.
Recognised
alleles
and
their
corresponding
antigens are indicated by alphabet(s) and a num-
ber (e.g. HLA-A1, HLA-DR7).
HLA Molecules
The HLA genes encode various enzymes and
structural molecules essential for the activation
and function of B and T cells. The genes encode
MHC proteins classiﬁed into three groups or clas-
ses known as the class I, class II and class III
molecules.
HLA Class I Molecules
These are glycoproteins found on the surface of
virtually all nucleated cells in the body. Class I
proteins are encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B and
HLA-C loci. Allelic genes encode approximately
20 different proteins at the A locus, 40 at the B
locus, and 8 at the C locus (Table 11.6). The
entire class I is composed of a transmembrane

glycoprotein
of
45,000
Da,
heavy
chain,
non-covalently
associated
with
a
β2-
microglobulin (a non-HC-encoded polypeptide
of MW 12,000 Da). Like that of an immunoglob-
ulin molecule, the heavy chain has a variable and
constant region. The variable region is highly
pleomorphic.
The
polymorphism
of
these
molecules is important in the recognition of self
and non-self. The constant region of the heavy
chain binds with the CD8 proteins of the cyto-
toxic T cells. Class I proteins are involved in graft
rejection and cell-mediated cytolysis.

HLA Class II Molecules
These are glycoproteins, and unlike class I
proteins, they have a restricted tissue distribution.
They are chieﬂy found on macrophages, B cells
and other APCs, such as dendritic cells of the
spleen and Langerhans cells of the skin. Their
expression on other cells (e.g. endothelial cells)
can be induced by gamma interferon. They are
highly polymorphic glycoproteins composed of
two non-covalently associated transmembrane
glycoproteins of MW of about 33,000 and
29,000 Da.
The genes on the HLA-D locus encode class II
proteins. This locus retains control of immune
responsiveness, and different allelic forms of
these genes confer striking differences in the abil-
ity to mount an immune response against a given
antigen. The class II MHC locus also includes
genes encoding proteins involved in antigen
processing, for example, transporter associated
with antigen processing (TAP). Class II proteins

are primarily responsible for the graft-versus-host
and mixed leucocyte responses.
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
149
HLA Class III Molecules
The class III MHC locus encodes complement
proteins (C2, C4) of the classical pathways, pro-
perdin and factor B of the alternative pathway and
several cytokines. HLA class III molecules are
polymorphic.
HLA Typing
HLA typing or tissue typing is usually performed
to determine the closest MCH match between
donors and recipients before transplantation sur-
gery. The methods commonly used in the labora-
tory include (1) molecular methods using DNA
sequence, (2) serological assays and (3) mixed
lymphocyte culture (MLC) techniques. All these
methods are used to determine the haplotype, that
is, the class I and class II alleles on both donor and
recipient chromosomes.
DNA probe and PCR are highly speciﬁc and
sensitive methods used to detect the different
alleles. Serological assays using a battery of
antibodies speciﬁc for different class I and class
II proteins are also used to demonstrate the
alleles. If these two methods fail to provide sufﬁ-
cient data, additional information can be obtained
by performing the MLC technique, also known as
mixed lymphocyte reaction.
Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction
This test is performed by using stimulator
lymphocytes from a potential donor, which are
ﬁrst killed by irradiation. Then it is mixed with
live responder lymphocytes from the recipient.
The resultant mixture is then incubated in cell
culture to allow DNA synthesis, which is detected
by adding tritiated thymidine. The more the DNA
synthesis in the responder cells, the more foreign
are the class II MHC proteins of donor cells.
Therefore, a large amount of DNA synthesis
indicates that class II (HLA-D) MHC proteins of
donors and recipients are not similar. This shows
an unsatisfactory match between donor and
recipients, and thereby graft is likely to be
rejected. On the other hand, the least production
of DNA suggests the best donor and a good match
between the donor and recipients.
Applications of HLA Typing
Its highly pleomorphic nature is responsible for
the
distinct
difference
between
the
HLA
molecules of one person to another person.
HLA typing has vast applications. HLA typing
is a required test before transplantation to know
the compatibility between donor and recipient
HLA molecules. It is also used in resolving
paternity disputes. It is also used in anthropo-
logical studies. The HLA molecules of humans
are distinct and large variations can be seen based
on the different ethnicities and races. The differ-
ent population studies based on HLA typing sug-
gest that humans originated from Africa and then
migrated to other parts of the world. It is also used
as a genetic marker for ﬁnding the association of
HLA with diseases, such as the association of
HLA-B27
with
ankylosing
spondylitis
and
HLA-DR4 with rheumatoid arthritis.
It is now known that MHC molecules bind
peptide antigens and present them to T cells.
Thus, these transplantation antigens are responsi-
ble for antigen recognition by the TCR. In this
respect, the TCR is different from the antibody.
Antibody molecules interact with antigen
directly;
the
TCR
only
recognises
antigen
presented by MHC molecules on another cell,
the APC. The TCR is speciﬁc for the antigen,
but the antigen must be presented on a self-
MHC molecule. The TCR is also speciﬁc for the
MHC molecule. If the antigen is presented by
another allelic form of the MHC molecule
in vitro (usually in an experimental situation),
there is no recognition by the TCR. This phenom-
enon is known as MHC restriction. Both classes
I and II MHC molecules are involved in this
phenomenon. Peptide antigens associated with
class I MHC molecules are recognised by CD8+
cytotoxic
T
lymphocytes,
whereas
class
II-associated peptide antigens are recognised by
CD4+ helper T cells.

Antigen
12
An antigen is a molecule which, when introduced
parenterally into the body, initiates the production
of an antibody with which it reacts speciﬁcally in
an observable manner.
Molecules that can be recognised by the
immunoglobulin receptor of B cells or by the
T-cell receptor when complexed with major histo-
compatibility
complex
(MHC)
are
called
antigens. The word antigen is a shortened form
of the words “antibody generator”. Antigens are
substances that react with antibodies, whereas
immunogens are molecules that induce an
immune response. In most cases, antigens are
immunogens, and the terms are used interchange-
ably. The antigens that are not immunogenic but
can participate in immune reactions are termed
haptens. The term immunogenicity means the
ability of an antigen to elicit an immune reaction
in the form of a B-cell or T-cell response, whereas
the term antigenicity means just the ability to
combine speciﬁcally with the products of the
above responses. All immunogenic molecules
are antigenic too, but all antigenic molecules can-
not be considered immunogenic. Thus, haptens
can be said to lack immunogenicity.
Determinants of Antigenicity
Several factors have been identiﬁed that make a
substance immunogenic.

151
Molecular Size
Antigenicity depends on the molecular size. In
general, protein molecules with large molecular
weight are highly antigenic. Substances with
molecular weights of about 100,000 Da and
more are highly immunogenic, whereas those
with less than 5000 Da are generally not immu-
nogenic. This property has been exploited in
experimental studies by using high molecular
weight proteins such as bovine gamma globulin
(MW 150,000 Da) to induce an immune reaction.
Substances with low molecular weight may be
made antigenic by adsorbing these on carrier
particles, such as bentonite, kaolin and other
inert particles.
Foreignness
To
be
immunogenic,
a
molecule
must
be
recognised as non-self, that is, foreign. The mole-
cule is considered self or non-self by the immune
system depending on whether or not the molecule
was exposed to the immune system during foetal
development.
Foreignness implies the ability of the host to
tolerate self-antigens. Tolerance to self-antigens
develops by contact with them in the initial
phases of the development of the immune system,
particularly
during
the
development
of

lymphocytes. In general, the more distantly
related two species are, the greater the immuno-
genicity of a molecule from one species will be
when exposed to the other. For example, the
bovine serum albumin is more immunogenic in
a chicken than in a goat. A graft from an unrelated
human will be rejected within about 2 weeks
unless immunosuppressive drugs are used, but a
graft from a chimpanzee will be rejected within
hours even if drugs are used. In contrast, a kidney
graft from an identical twin will be accepted
readily.

Antigen
Chemical-Structural Complexity
Proteins
are
the
most
potent
immunogens,
followed by polysaccharides. Nucleic acids and
lipids are inefﬁcient in eliciting a good immune
reaction, although they may act as haptens. The
structural complexity of a protein contributes to
its immunogenicity. Chains of single amino acids
or single sugars are poorly immunogenic, but if
different amino acids or sugars are combined in
the same molecule, the immunogenicity is greatly
enhanced.
In
cell-mediated
immunity,
the
response of T cells to the peptide component of
the proteins depends on how the peptide is
recognised and presented by the MHC cells.
Therefore, protein structure plays an essential
role in its immunogenicity, especially in inducing
cellular immunity.
The lipid-speciﬁc antibodies are not easily
produced; hence, they do not play a signiﬁcant
role in immunity. However, these antibodies have
a role in measuring certain lipid-based molecules
and drugs. These antibodies are produced ﬁrst by
treating lipids with haptens and then conjugating
with suitable carrier molecules, such as the
proteins (e.g. haemocyanin or bovine serum
albumin).
Stability
Highly stable and non-degradable substances
(e.g. some plastics, metals, or chains of δ-amino
acids) are not immunogenic. This is because
internalisation, processing and presentation by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are always essen-
tial for mounting an immune response. Therefore,
very stable substances (such as silicon) have been
successful as non-immunogenic materials for
reconstructive surgeries, such as breast implants.
On the other hand, if a substance is very unsta-
ble, it may break up before an APC can internalise
it and hence become immunogenic. In addition,
large, insoluble complexes are more immuno-
genic than smaller, soluble ones. This is because
macrophages
ﬁnd
it
easier to
phagocytose,
degrade and present the insoluble complexes
than the soluble complexes.
Other Factors
The biological system also plays an essential role
in determining the immunological efﬁciency of
an antigen. For example, some substances are
immunogenic in one individual but not in others
(i.e. responders and non-responders). This is
because individuals may lack or have altered
genes that code for the receptors for antigen on
B cells and T cells, or they may not have the
appropriate genes needed for the APC to present
antigen to the helper T (Th) cells.
Dosage and route of the antigen by which it
comes into contact with the immune system also
inﬂuence the immunogenicity of the antigen.
Very low doses of antigen do not stimulate an
immune
response,
either
because
too
few
lymphocytes
are
contacted
or
because
a
non-responsive state is elicited. Conversely, an
extremely high dose also fails to elicit tolerance.
Repeated administration of antigens (booster
doses) may be required to enhance the host’s
immune response to certain antigens. This is par-
ticularly important in the case of vaccines, where
a prerequisite immune level needs to be attained.
Hence the booster doses of vaccines, such as DPT
(diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus), DT (diphtheria,
tetanus) and so on, are given to ensure good
protective
levels
of
antibodies.
Generally,
antigens are administered by the parenteral route
to produce a good level of antibodies. The
antigens can be given by (1) intravenous,

(2) subcutaneous, (3) intradermal, (4) intramuscu-
lar, (5) intra-peritoneal and (6) mucosal routes.
Usually, the subcutaneous route of administration
proves to be better than intravenous routes at
eliciting an immune response.
Antigenic Specificity
153
Adjuvants These are the substances that, when
mixed with an antigen and injected with it, boost
the immunogenicity of the antigen. Adjuvants
increase both the strength and the duration of
the immune response. Adjuvants boost the immu-
nogenicity of antigens in several ways. Adjuvants
such as aluminium potassium sulphate (alum) and
Freund’s water-in-oil adjuvant prolong antigen
persistence by forming a depot at the injection
site. Alum precipitates the antigen and releases it
a little at a time. The water-in-oil emulsion forms
small droplets with the antigen and also releases
these slowly over time.
Freund’s complete adjuvant contains, in addi-
tion
to
the
emulsifying
factors,
heat-killed
mycobacteria. The bacterial components activate
macrophages and increase both the production of
IL-1 and the level of B7 membrane molecules,
which enhances the immune response. The
increased expression of Class II MHC increases
the ability of APC to present antigen to Th
cells. B7 molecules on the APC bind to CD28, a
cell surface protein on Th cells, triggering
costimulation, an enhancement of the T-cell
immune response.
Some adjuvants, such as synthetic polyribonu-
cleotides
and
bacterial
lipopolysaccharides
(LPS), stimulate non-speciﬁc lymphocyte prolif-
eration and bring about their action.
Antigenic Specificity
Antigenic speciﬁcity of the antigen depends on
antigenic determinants or epitopes.
Epitopes
An epitope is deﬁned as the immunologically
active region of an immunogen that binds to
antigen-speciﬁc
membrane
receptors
on
lymphocytes or secreted antibodies. The interac-
tion between cells of the immune system and
antigens occurs at many levels, and the complex-
ity of any antigen is mirrored by its epitope
(Fig. 12.1). There are two types of epitopes:
B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes.
B-Cell Epitopes
These are antigenic determinants recognised by B
cells. The B-cell epitope can combine with its
receptor only if the antigen molecule is in its
native state. The complementary surfaces of the
antibody and the antigen molecules appear to be
relatively ﬂat. Smaller molecules often ﬁt nicely
within a particular depression or groove in the
antigen-binding site of the antibody molecule.
The B-cell epitope is about six or seven sugar
residues or amino acids long. They are also
often found in regions of proteins with higher
mobility; this may make it possible for an epitope
to shift just a bit to ﬁt into an almost-right site.
T-Cell Epitopes
T-cell epitopes recognise amino acids in proteins
but do not recognise polysaccharides or nucleic
acid antigens. This is why polysaccharides are
considered
T
cell-independent
antigens
and
proteins as T-cell-dependent antigens. The pri-
mary sequence of amino acids in proteins
determines the antigenic determinants recognised
by T cells. Free peptides are not recognised by T
cells, whereas the complex of MHC molecules
and peptides are recognised by T cells. Thus, for a
T-cell response, it should recognise both the anti-
genic determinant and the MHC, and therefore it
is said to be MHC restricted. In general, T-cell
epitopes or antigenic determinants are small and
are only 8–15 amino acids long. The antigenic
determinants are limited to those parts of the
antigen that can bind to MHC molecules.
There are two types of epitopes of protein
antigens depending on their interaction with the
paratope (antigen-binding site on the antibody
molecule) and its structural conﬁguration:
1. Conformational epitope: This constitutes the
most common type of epitope, which has a

154
12
Antigen
Fig. 12.1 Epitopes (linear
and conformational)
non-continuous amino acid sequence. As a
result, their interaction with the corresponding
paratope is determined by the tertiary structure
of the antigen.
2. Linear epitope: Here, the epitope is made up
of a continuous sequence of amino acids and
the interaction with the paratope is determined
by the primary structure of the antigen. T
lymphocytes
recognise
only
the
linear
epitopes, while B cells and antibodies can
recognise both linear and conformational
types of epitopes.
3. Paratope: A paratope is the region of an anti-
body that recognises and binds to the epitope
of an antigen. Paratopes are produced by the
complementary binding of light and heavy
chains resulting in a three-dimensional struc-
ture. In theory, 104 heavy chains can combine
with 104 light chains to generate 108 different
paratopes. The paratope region is present in
the variable region of the antibody and
consists of 5–10 amino acids.
Types of Specificity
The speciﬁcity of antigens is of various types.
Species Specificity
Tissues of all individuals in a species possess
certain species-speciﬁc antigens. However, some
degree of cross-reaction occurs between antigens
from related species. The species speciﬁcity
shows a phylogenetic relationship. The phyloge-
netic relationship is useful (1) in tracing evolu-
tionary relationships between species and (2) in
identifying species from blood and seminal stains
in forensic medicine.

Biological Classes of Antigens
155
Isospecificity
It is determined by the presence of isoantigens or
histocompatibility antigens.
Isoantigens are antigens are found in some,
but not all, species members. A species may be
grouped depending on the presence of different
isoantigens in its members. These are genetically
determined. Human erythrocyte antigens, based
on which individuals are classiﬁed into different
blood
groups,
are
the
best
examples
of
isoantigens in humans. The blood groups are of
primary importance in (1) transfusion of blood
and blood products, (2) isoimmunisation during
pregnancy and (3) providing valuable evidence in
paternity disputes, the results of which are
supplemented by more recent DNA ﬁngerprinting
tests.
Histocompatibility antigens are the cellular
determinants speciﬁc for each individual of a
species. These antigens are associated with the
plasma membrane of tissue cells. Human leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA) is the major histocompatibil-
ity antigen determining homograft rejection.
Therefore, HLA typing is essential before carry-
ing out tissue or organ transplantation from one
individual to another.
Autospecificity
Self-antigens are generally non-antigenic. How-
ever, sequestrated antigens (such as eye lens pro-
tein and sperm) are exceptions because these are
not recognised as self-antigens. This is because
the immune system never encounters corneal tis-
sue and sperm during the development of toler-
ance to self-antigens. Therefore, these tissues
become immunogenic if accidentally or experi-
mentally released into the blood or tissues.
Organ Specificity
Antigen characteristics of an organ or tissue are
called organ-speciﬁc antigens. These antigens
found in the brain, kidney and lens tissues share
the same antigen speciﬁcity even from different
animal species. Organ-speciﬁc antigens, such as
brain-speciﬁc antigens, shared by human and
sheep brains, are one example. The anti-rabies
vaccines
prepared
from
sheep
brain,
when
given, may induce an immune response in some
humans, causing damage to the neural tissues of
the recipient. This may result in neuroparalytic
complications in some individuals.
Heterophile Specificity
It is determined by the presence of heterophile
antigens. The same or closely related antigens,
sometimes
present
in
tissues
of
different
biological species, classes or kingdoms, are
known
as
heterophile
antigens.
Antibodies
against the heterophile antigens produced by one
species cross-react with the antigens of other spe-
cies. This property is exploited for the diagnosis
of many infectious diseases. Weil–Felix reaction,
Paul–Bunnell test and cold agglutination tests are
examples of serological tests that use such hetero-
phile antigens.
Weil–Felix reaction is a test used for the

Biological Classes of Antigens
Based on their ability to induce antibody produc-
tion, antigens are classiﬁed as (1) T-cell-depen-
dent antigens, (2) T-cell-independent antigens
and (3) superantigens.
T-Cell-Dependent Antigens (TD)
The majority of naturally occurring proteins are
T-cell-dependent antigens, and these antigens
cannot induce antibody production upon direct
contact with B cells. T-dependent antigens are

Characteristics
T-cell-dependent antigen
made up of a few copies of several antigenic
determinants. These antigens bind to the Ig recep-
tor present on the B cells, which are then
internalised and processed into smaller peptides
and then expressed on the B cell surface. Further,
B cells form a complex with MHC II and present
themselves to T helper cells. Upon recognising
processed antigenic determinants, Th cell secretes
cytokines and expresses CD40 ligands on it. After
that, the Th cell interacts with CD 40 markers
present on the B cells in the presence of cytokines
to
produce
antibodies
against
the
speciﬁc
antigens.

T-Cell-Independent Antigens (TI)
These antigens stimulate B cells to produce
antibodies without any direct involvement of T
cells.
Most
microbial
antigens
such
as
carbohydrates, lipids and certain nucleic acids
are
T-independent
antigens.
Further,
these
antigens are of two types.
Type-1
antigens
include
endotoxins
and
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of microbes. They
are mitogenic, thus helping B cell multiplica-
tion and polyclonal B cell activation.
Type-2 antigens include polymeric compounds
such as polysaccharides (pneumococcal cap-
sular polysaccharides) or proteins (ﬂagellar
proteins).
These
antigens,
along
with
cytokines, activate B cells to produce speciﬁc
antibodies and augment other immune cell
functions such as dendritic cells, mast cells,
macrophages
and
NK
cells.
Differences
between T-cell-dependent antigens and T-
cell-independent
antigens
are
listed
in
Table 12.1.
Boivin antigens are lipopolysaccharide analogues
which are endotoxins released from Gram-
negative bacteria cell wall.
Superantigens
Superantigens are a class of molecules that can
interact with APCs and T lymphocytes in a
non-speciﬁc way. The superantigens act differ-
ently by interacting with both MHC class II
molecules of the APC and the Vβ domain of the
T-lymphocyte receptor in a sequential manner
(Fig. 12.2). They do not require processing and
hence can bind to MHC molecules outside the
peptide or antigen-binding groove. Superantigens
are considered the most powerful mitogen, and a

e
dose of less than 0.1 pg/mL can be lethal. This
interaction results in the activation of a larger
number of T cells (up to 25%) than conventional
antigens (1%), leading to massive cytokine
expression and immunomodulation. As a result,
there is polyclonal activation of T cells with the
production of large amounts of cytokines like
IFN-γ. IFN-γ, in turn, causes the activation of
macrophages to produce IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α.
The net result is the development of a “cytokine
storm”. Examples of superantigens are staphylo-
coccal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxins,
exfoliative
toxins
and
viral
proteins.
Most
recently,
the
SARS-Coronavirus-2
has
been
shown to produce a cytokine storm leading to
death in many instances. The diseases associated
with superantigens in humans are listed in
Table 12.2. Distinguishing features between anti-
gen and superantigen are listed in the Table 12.3.
Biological Classes of Antigens
157
Haptens
A hapten is a low molecular weight substance
that is antigenic but not immunogenic. It cannot
elicit an immune response by itself but can
combine with a product of a speciﬁc immun
response (Incomplete antigen). A carrier mole-
cule which is commonly a protein, combined
with a hapten, makes the complex immunogenic.
A hapten-carrier conjugate (Complete antigen)
can produce three different types of antibodies:
against the hapten, against the protein and
new epitopes formed due to conjugation. Uru-
shiol toxin is found in poison ivy, and when it
enters the body, it is converted to quinone, the
hapten. It reacts with skin protein and acts as an
antigen causing contact dermatitis. Penicillin
and halothane are other examples of haptens
that can cause human disease. Haptens can be
of two types. Simple hapten contains only
one epitope or antibody-binding site, and the
hapten-antibody complex cannot be visualised
in a precipitation reaction. Complex hapten
has two or more antibody-binding sites, and the
complex can be visualised in a precipitation
reaction.

Haptens fail to activate helper T cells due to
their inability to bind to MHC proteins since
haptens are not proteins, and only proteins can
be
presented
by
MHC
proteins.
Moreover,
haptens cannot activate B cells since they are

univalent. On the contrary, they can activate B
cells when covalently bound to a “carrier” pro-
tein; since then, they form an immunogenic
hapten-carrier conjugate (Fig. 12.3). Then, they
bind to the IgM receptor on the B cells, and the
hapten-carrier protein complex is internalised. B
cells present a peptide of the carrier protein to the
helper T cells in association with Class II MHC
protein. The activated helper T cells then produce
interleukins, which stimulate the B cells to pro-
duce antibodies to the hapten.

taken in, processed and pieces of the carrier are
presented by these B cells and TH cells. In the
body, the formation of hapten-carrier conjugates
is the basis for developing allergic responses to
drugs, such as penicillin.
Pathogen Determinants Recognition
by Innate Immune System
Usually, the adaptive immune system reacts
speciﬁcally
to
a
particular
pathogen
by
recognising its discrete antigenic determinants
with the help of speciﬁc receptors present on the
immune cells. In contrast, the components of the
innate immune system can recognise the unique
molecular patterns shared by many pathogens.
These unique molecular patterns shared by multi-
ple pathogens are termed pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), and the innate
immune receptors that recognise PAMPs are
called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). A
single PRR can recognise a particular PAMP
present on different pathogens.

Pathogen Determinants Recognition by Innate Immune System
159
Broadly, PRRs are categorised into three
classes.
Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)
TLRs are transmembrane receptors on the host
immune
cells
such
as
dendritic
cells
and
macrophages with unique pattern recognition
capabilities. There are 13 different types of
TLRs that can recognise different pathogens and
enhance innate immune mechanisms by phagocy-
tosis and inﬂammation at the site of infection.
Scavenger Receptors (SR)
SRs are expressed by macrophages, dendritic
cells and certain endothelial cells. They can bind
to the bacterial cell wall components such as
LPS, peptidoglycans and damaged or apoptotic
cells. SRs are involved in lipid metabolism and
play an important role in clearing damaged host
cells and other molecules. Examples of scavenger
receptors include CD-36, CD-68, SRB-1 and
so on.
Mannose Receptors
These are found on the surface of phagocytes and
can bind to the mannose-rich glycans, the
components of the microbial glycoproteins and
glycolipids. Mannose-rich glycans are short car-
bohydrate chains with mannose or fucose as the
terminal sugar, and they are usually present in
microbes but not in humans.

Antibodies
13
Antibodies
are
globulinproteins
(immunoglobulins) that are synthesised in serum
and tissue ﬂuids and react speciﬁcally with the
antigen that stimulates their production. Three
types of globulins are present in the blood:
alpha, beta and gamma.
The antibodies are the gamma globulins.
Antibodies are one of the major plasma proteins,
and against infection, they are often referred to as
the “ﬁrst line of defence”. Von Behring and
Kitasato performed the ﬁrst experiments that
proved the physical existence of antibodies in
1890. They demonstrated that serum obtained
from rabbits immunised with tetanus or diphthe-
ria toxins could prevent disease in mice infected
with such pathogens. The unknown substance
that was present in serum and protected on trans-
fer was named “antitoxin” by Tizzoni and Cattani
in 1891. Subsequently, experimental works by
Paul Ehrlich and Jules Bordet demonstrated that
a protective response could be generated even
against whole cells (erythrocytes). The more
inclusive term antibody subsequently replaced
the term antitoxin.
Tiselius and Kabat accomplished the ﬁrst suc-
cessful attempt to identify antibody molecules in
1939 by electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 13.1).
They
demonstrated
that
hyperimmunisation
increased the concentration of γ-globulins in
serum and that this fraction contained antibody
activity. Since most antibodies are found in these
Gamma globulin fractions, these are named
immunoglobulins (Ig). Porter in 1959 succeeded
in digesting rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) with
the proteolytic enzyme papain. Edelman and
Poulik using a similar method split myeloma
globulins into two distinct components, which
subsequently were termed heavy (H) and light
(L) chains.

The World Health Organization (WHO) in
1964 coined the term immunoglobulin (Ig) for
the
term
antibody.
The
immunoglobulins
synthesised
primarily
by
plasma
cells
and
lymphocytes
are
structural
and
chemical
concepts. The immunoglobulin includes antibody
globulins and the cryoglobulins, macroglobulins,
and
abnormal
myeloma
proteins.
Thus,
all
antibodies, which are biological and functional
models,
are
immunoglobulins,
but
not
all
immunoglobulins may be antibodies.
Immunoglobulins
or
antibodies
constitute
20–25% of the total serum protein. Depending
on physiochemical and antigenic differences,
they
are
divided
into
ﬁve
classes
of
immunoglobulins: (1) immunoglobulin G (IgG),
(2) immunoglobulin M (IgM), (3) immunoglobu-
lin A (IgA), (4) immunoglobulin E (IgE) and
(5) immunoglobulin D (IgD).
The most crucial function of antibodies is to
confer protection against microbial pathogens.
Antibodies confer protection in many ways:
(1) they prevent attachment of microbes to muco-
sal surfaces of the host, (2) they reduce the viru-
lence of microbes by neutralising toxins and
viruses,
(3)
they
facilitate
phagocytosis
by
opsonisation of microbes and (4) they activate

complement, leading to complement-mediated
activities against microbes.

Structure of Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins. A single
antibody molecule has two identical heavy chains
and two identical light chains, H2L2, or a multi-
ple (H2L2) n of this basic four-chain structure.
This gives immunoglobulin an overall “Y” or “T”
shape, which is the most widely recognised fea-
ture of immunoglobulin structure.
Digestion of Immunoglobulins by
Enzymes
The immunoglobulin molecule can be broken
into many “sections” or “fragments” by the action
of proteolytic enzymes.
The enzyme papain cleaves just above the
interchain disulphide bonds linking the heavy
chains. Peptide bonds in the “hinge” region are
broken on the treatment of antibody molecule
with
papain,
producing
two
identical
Fab
fragments
and
one
Fc
fragment.
The
Fab
fragments
produced
during
cleavage
noncovalently bind to the antigen.
The enzyme pepsin cleaves just below these
bonds, generating different digestion products
(Fig. 13.2). Treatment with pepsin cleaves immu-
noglobulin but at a different site, producing an Fc
fragment and two Fab fragments, F (ab)2, which
upon
exposure
to
reducing
conditions
are
separated into Fab monomeric units.
Each immunoglobulin molecule, in essence,
contains the following components.
Immunoglobulin Chains
They are a complex structure of four polypeptide
chains: two identical heavy (typically 55 kDa
each) chains and two identical light chains
(25 kDa each). The terms “heavy” and “light”
refer to the molecular weights of the chains,
whereas light chains have a molecular weight of
25,000 Da. The heavy chains are longer, and the
light chains are shorter (Fig. 13.3). Sub-isotypes
exist for α and γ chains, and this leads to the
existence
of
subclasses
of
the
respective
immunoglobulins.

Structure of Immunoglobulins
163
Fig. 13.2 Proteolytic cleavage of antibody by papain and pepsin
Heavy Chains
An immunoglobulin molecule has two heavy
chains. Each heavy chain is made of 420–440
amino acids. The two heavy chains are held
together by one to ﬁve disulphide (S–S) bonds.
Each heavy chain is bound to a light chain by a
disulphide bond and non-covalent bonds such as
salt linkages, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
bonds to form a heterodimer of heavy and light
chains (H-L). Similar non-covalent interactions
and disulphide bridges link the two identical
heavy and light (H-L) chains to each other to
form
the
basic
four-chain
(H-L)2
antibody
structure.
The heavy chains of a given antibody mole-
cule determine the class of that antibody. For
example, IgM contains mu (μ), IgG contains
gamma (γ), IgA contains alpha (α), IgD contains
delta (δ) and IgE contains epsilon (ɛ) heavy
chains (Table 13.1). These heavy chains are struc-
turally and antigenically distinct for each class of
immunoglobulin. They differ in size, carbohy-
drate content and antigens.
Light Chains
An immunoglobulin molecule has two light
chains. Each light chain is made of 220–240
amino acids. A light chain is attached to the

heavy chain by a disulphide bond. The light
chains are structurally and chemically similar in
all classes of immunoglobulins. They are of two
types: kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). These two differ
in their amino acids present in constant regions.
Each immunoglobulin has either two κ or two λ
chains but never both. The κ and λ chains are
present in human serum in a ratio of 2:1.

Variable and Constant Regions
Each polypeptide chain of an immunoglobulin
molecule contains an amino-terminal part and a
carboxy-terminal part. The amino-terminal part is
called the variable region (V region) and the
carboxy-terminal part is called the constant region
(C region). Both heavy and light chains contain
variable and constant regions.
Variable region: The amino-terminal half of the
light or heavy chain, consisting of 100–110
amino acids, is known as variable or V regions
(VL in light chains and VH in heavy chains).
V region is different for each class of immu-
noglobulin. The variable regions of both light
and heavy chains consist of three highly vari-
able regions known as hypervariable regions.
The antigen combining sites Fab of the anti-
body molecule that consists of only 5–10
amino acids each are present in the hypervari-
able region of both light and heavy chains.
These antigen-binding sites are responsible

Structure of Immunoglobulins
165
for the speciﬁc binding of antibodies with
antigens. The high speciﬁcity of antibodies is
primarily due to these hypervariable regions.
Constant region: The carboxyl-terminal half of
the molecule is called the constant (C) region.
It consists of two basic amino acid sequences.
The Fc fragment, found to crystallise under
low ionic conditions, is present in the constant
region of the heavy chain. The constant region
of the heavy chain has many biological
functions. It is responsible for activating the
complement, binding to cell surface receptors,
placental transfer and many other biological
activities. The constant region of the light
chain has no biological function.
Hinge Region: It is a ﬂexible amino acid stretch
present in between CH1 and CH2 heavy chains
of immunoglobulin molecules which links the
two heavy chains by disulphide bonds. It is
rich in cysteine and proline amino acids and
has
an
extremely
variable
amino
acid
sequence. Different classes and subclasses of
immunoglobulins have a varying number of
disulphide bonds. The hinge region is present
in γ, α and δ heavy chains but ɛ and μ heavy
chains are devoid of it. However, ɛ and μ
heavy chains have an additional hinge-like
domain with approximately 110 amino acids.
Immunoglobulin Domains
These regions are composed of three-dimensional
folded structures with repeating segments called
domains. Each heavy chain consists of one vari-
able (VH) and three constant (CH) domains. IgG
and IgA have three CH domains (CH1, CH2 and
CH3), whereas IgM and IgE have four domains
(CH1, CH2, CH3 and CH4). Each light chain
consists of one variable (VL) and one constant
domain (CL).
Biosynthesis of Immunoglobulins
B lymphocytes and plasma cells take part in the
synthesis of immunoglobulins. Resting B cells
synthesise
only
small
amounts
of
immunoglobulins that mainly get incorporated
into cell membranes. Plasma cells, the most
differentiated B cells, are specialised to produce
and secrete large amounts of immunoglobulins.
Heavy and light chains are synthesised in sep-
arate polyribosomes of the plasma cell. Plasma
cells secrete free light chains; free heavy chains
are not secreted by plasma cells. Heavy chains
require light chains to form a complete immuno-
globulin molecule. Synthesised heavy chains are
transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for
glycosylation.
Both IgM and IgA are polymeric antibodies,
which have one additional polypeptide chain, that
is, the J chain. The J chain is synthesised by all
plasma cells, including those that produce IgG.
However, it is only incorporated into polymeric
forms of IgM and IgA. IgM proteins are assem-
bled in two steps. First, the monomeric units are
assembled. Then, ﬁve monomers and one J chain
combine
via
covalent
bonds
to
produce
a
pentameric molecule.
Metabolism of Immunoglobulins
The half-life (T 1/2) of immunoglobulin is one of
the most commonly used parameters to assess the
catabolic rate of immunoglobulins. The half-life
is
the
time
taken
to
reduce
circulating
immunoglobulins to half after reaching equilib-
rium. The half-life is found by injecting a
radiolabelled isotope (131I) with immunoglobulin.
The IgG is the immunoglobulin class with the
longest half-life (average of 21 days) except
IgG3. The IgG3 has a considerably shorter half-
life (average of 7 days) that is nearer to that of IgA
(5–6 days) and IgM (5 days). IgE and IgD have a
half-life of 1–5 days and 2–8 days, respectively.
Immunoglobulin Classes
The structure and biological functions of ﬁve
classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE
and IgD) are described.

80% of the total serum immunoglobulin. The
average serum concentration of IgG is about
8–16 mg/mL. It contains less carbohydrate than
other immunoglobulins. IgG is a 7S immunoglob-
ulin with a molecular weight of 150,000 Da. It has
a half-life of 23 days—the longest among all the
immunoglobulins. Other properties of the IgG are

IgG structure
The IgG molecule contains two γ chains and two
κ, or γ chains joined together by disulphide
bonds. The γ chain is a 51-kDa, 450-amino acid
residue heavy polypeptide chain. It consists of
one
variable
VH
domain
and
a
constant
(C) region with three domains designated CH1,
CH2 and CH3. The hinge region is situated
between CH1 and CH2. Proteolytic enzymes,
such as papain and pepsin, cleave an IgG mole-
cule in the hinge region to produce Fab and F
(ab0) 2 and Fc fragments.
Biological Activities
In response to infection, IgG antibodies appear
late after the appearance of IgM antibodies but
persist for a longer period. It confers protection
against the microorganisms present in the blood
and tissues. It is distributed equally in the intra-
and extravascular compartments. It is the only
immunoglobulin
that
crosses
the
placenta;
hence, it confers natural passive immunity to
newborns. It takes part in precipitation, comple-
ment ﬁxation and neutralisation of toxins and
viruses. In addition, it binds to microorganisms
and
facilitates
the
phagocytosis
of
microorganisms.
Subclasses of IgG
There are four subclasses of IgG (IgG1, IgG2,
IgG3
and
IgG4)
in
humans
with
four
corresponding γ chain isotypes designated γ-1,
γ-2, γ-3 and γ-4. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4
have a difference in their hinge regions. The

number and position of the disulphide bond
which links two γ chains in IgG are also different.
Human γ chain isotypes show only a 5% differ-
ence in amino acid sequence in the hinge region.
Inter-heavy γ chain disulphide bonds are formed
in the hinge region by cysteine residues. There are
two inter-heavy chain disulphide bonds in IgG1
and IgG4, whereas IgG2 has four and IgG3
has 11.

Functions
of
IgG:
The
functions
of
four
subclasses of IgG vary. IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4
are
special
because
these
are
the
only
immunoglobulins with the ability to cross the
placental barrier. Therefore, they play an
important role in protecting the developing
foetus against infections. IgG3, IgG1 and
IgG2, in order of their efﬁciency, are effective
in the activation of the complement. IgG1 and
IgG3 bind with high afﬁnity to Fc receptors on
phagocytic
cells
and
thus
mediate
opsonisation. On the other hand, IgG4 has an
intermediate afﬁnity for Fc receptors, while
IgG2 has an extremely low afﬁnity.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM)
IgM constitutes about 5–8% of total serum
immunoglobulins. It is distributed mainly intra-
vascularly. It is a heavy molecule (19S) with a
molecular weight varying from
900,000
to
1,000,000 Da (millionaire molecule). It has a
half-life of 5 days (Table 13.2).
It is also the ﬁrst immunoglobulin synthesised
by a neonate at about 20 weeks of age. IgM is not
transported across the placenta; hence, the pres-
ence of IgM in the foetus or newborn indicates
intrauterine infection. Therefore, the detection of
IgM antibodies in serum is helpful for the diag-
nosis of congenital infections, such as syphilis,
rubella and toxoplasmosis.
IgM Structure
IgM is basically a pentamer, composed of ﬁve
immunoglobulin subunits (monomeric subunits,
IgMs) and one molecule of the J chain. Each
monomeric IgM comprises two light chains (κ
or γ light chains) and two heavy chains (μ). The
heavy chains are larger than those of IgG by about
20,000 Da, corresponding to an extra domain on
the constant region (CH4). Two subclasses of
IgM (IgM1 and IgM2) are described, which differ
in their μ chains. IgM1 consists of μ1 chain, and
IgM2 consists of μ2 chain (Fig. 13.4). Serum IgM
has a higher valency when compared to other
isotypes, which is due to its pentameric structure
with 10 binding sites. Ten small hapten molecules
can bind to one IgM molecule, but only fewer
molecules can bind due to steric hindrance.
Monomeric IgM, with a molecular weight of
180,000 Da, is expressed as a membrane-bound
antibody on B cells. As mentioned earlier, the J
chain found in the IgM molecule was believed to
play a signiﬁcant role in the secretion of its
polymerised form. Being present on the mem-
brane of B cells, IgM acts as the antigen-binding
molecule in the antigen-antibody complex.
Treatment of serum with 2-mercaptoethanol
destroys IgM without affecting IgG antibodies.
This forms the basis for differential estimation
of IgM and IgG antibodies in serum pre-treated
with 2-mercaptoethanol.
Biological Activities
IgM is the ﬁrst immunoglobulin produced in a
primary response to an antigen. The immuno-
globulin confers protection against the invasion
of blood by microbial pathogens. The deﬁciency
of IgM antibodies is associated with septicaemia.
Because of its high valency, Pentameric IgM is
more efﬁcient than other isotypes in binding
antigens with many repeating epitopes, such as
viral particles and red blood cells. It is more
efﬁcient than IgG in activating complement.
Complement activation requires two Fc regions

nearby, and this requirement is fulﬁlled by the
pentameric structure of a single molecule of IgM.

Antibodies
Fig. 13.4 Schematic diagram of immunoglobulins and their functions
IgM antibodies are short-lived and disappear
early compared to IgG. The presence of IgM
antibody in serum, therefore, indicates recent
infection.
Immunoglobulin A (IgA)
IgA is the second major serum immunoglobulin,
comprising nearly 10–15% of serum immuno-
globulin. It has a half-life of 6–8 days. It is the
major immunoglobulin in saliva, tears and colos-
trum (Table 13.2).
IgA Structure
IgA occurs in two forms: serum IgA and secre-
tory IgA.
Serum IgA is present in the serum and is a
monomeric 7S molecule with a molecular
weight of 60,000 Da. It has a half-life of
6–8 days. It has two subclasses, IgA1 and
IgA2, which are two α-chain isotypes α-1
and α-2, respectively. The α-2 chain has two
allotypes, A2m (1) and A2m (2), and does not
have disulphide bonds linking heavy to light
chains. Differences in the two chains are found

Fig. 13.5 Schematic
diagram of secretory
immunoglobulin A (IgA)
in two CH1 and ﬁve CH3 positions. Thus,
there are three varieties of a-heavy chains in
humans.
Secretory IgA is a dimer or tetramer 11S with a
molecular weight of 400,000 Da. It consists of
a J-chain polypeptide and a polypeptide chain
called secretory component (SC) or secretory
piece (Fig. 13.5). An additional segment of
18-amino acid residues at the penultimate
position of the chain contains a cysteine resi-
due where the J chain can be attached through
a disulphide bond. The SC is a polypeptide
with a molecular weight of 70,000 Da pro-
duced
by
epithelial
cells
of
mucous
membranes. The secretory piece protects IgA
from denaturation by enzymes secreted by
bacteria colonising the intestinal mucosa. It
consists of ﬁve immunoglobulin-like domains
that bind to the Fc region of the IgA dimer.
This interaction is stabilised by a disulphide
bond between the ﬁfth domain of the SC and
one of the chains
of the dimeric IgA.
IgA-secreting plasma cells are concentrated
along mucous membrane surfaces. The daily
production of secretory IgA is greater than that
of any other immunoglobulin.
Secretory IgA is the major immunoglobulin
present in external secretions, such as breast
milk, saliva, tears and mucus of the bronchial,
genitourinary and digestive tracts. IgA inhibits
the adherence of microorganisms to the intestinal
mucosa surface, thereby preventing their entry
into host tissues. IgA activates the complement
not by the classical pathway but by the alternative
pathway.
Biological Activities
Secretory IgA protects the mucous membranes
against microbial pathogens. As IgA is poly-
meric, it can cross-link multiple epitopes of a
large antigen. It also performs effector functions
at the mucous membrane site through which most
pathogenic organisms enter. Secretory IgA binds
to the viral and bacterial surface antigens to form
a complex and inhibits the pathogens from
attaching to the mucosal cells. This prevents bac-
terial colonisation and viral infection. These
complexes are eliminated by ciliated epithelial
cells in the respiratory tract or gut peristalsis.
Breast milk contains secretory IgA and many
other molecules that protect newborns against
infection
during
the
ﬁrst
month
of
life.
Breastfeeding plays a vital role in maintaining
the health of newborns because the immune sys-
tem of infants is not fully functional. Defence
against
certain
bacteria
such
as
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella
spp. and viruses such as reovirus, polio and inﬂu-
enza are provided by secretory IgA.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
IgE constitutes less than 1% of the total immuno-
globulin pool. It is present in serum at a very low
concentration (0.3 μg/mL). It is mainly found
extravascularly inlining of the respiratory and
intestinal tracts. IgE is an 8S molecule with a
molecular weight of 190,000 Da and a half-life
of 2–3 days. Unlike other immunoglobulins that
are heat stable, IgE is a heat-labile protein—easily
inactivated at 56 C in 1 h. IgE does not cross the
placenta or does not ﬁx the complement. It is
susceptible to mercaptoethanol (Table 13.2).

170
13
Antibodies
Fig. 13.6 Schematic
diagram of
immunoglobulin E (IgE)
Structure
Two heavy polypeptide chains, along with two κ
or two λ light chains, fastened together by
disulphide bonds, comprise an IgE molecule.
This chain is a 72-kDa, 550-amino acid residue
polypeptide chain. It consists of one variable
region, designated VH and a four-domain con-
stant region, designated CH1, CH2, CH3 and
CH4. This heavy chain does not possess a hinge
region. In humans, the e heavy chain has
428 amino acid residues in the constant region
(Fig. 13.6).
Biological Activities
IgE, also known as reaginic antibody, mediates
the type I immediate hypersensitivity (atopy)
reactions. It is responsible for the symptoms of
hay fever, asthma and anaphylactic shock. There
are FC receptors in the membrane of blood
basophils and tissue mast to which IgE binds.
When there is cross-linkage of receptor-bound
IgE molecule with antigen, the basophils and
mast cells are induced to translocate
their
granules to the plasma membrane. This then
releases their content to the extracellular environ-
ment. This process is known as degranulation.
Owing
to
this,
many
active
mediators are
released, which induces allergy.
Localised mast cell degranulation induced by
IgE may also release mediators that facilitate a
build-up
of
various
cells
necessary
for
antiparasitic defence. It plays an essential role in
defence against helminthic infections in humans.
Immunoglobulin D (IgD)
IgD
comprises
less
than
1%
of
serum
immunoglobulins. It is a 7S monomer with a
molecular weight of 180,000 Da. The half-life
of IgD is only 2–3 days (Table 13.2). IgD has
the basic four-chain monomeric structure with
two
δ
heavy
chains
(molecular
weight
63,000 Da each) and either two κ or two λ light
chains
(molecular
weight
22,000
Da
each)
(Table 13.2). IgD is present on the surface of B
lymphocytes, and both IgD and IgM serve as
recognition receptors for antigens. However, the
role of IgD in immunity continues to remain
elusive.
Table 13.3 summarises the roles of various
immunoglobulins in human defence.
Abnormal Immunoglobulins
Abnormal immunoglobulins are other structurally
similar proteins found in the serum in certain

pathological conditions, such as multiple mye-
loma, heavy chain disease and cryoglobulinemia
and sometimes in healthy individuals.

Multiple Myeloma
Bence–Jones (BJ) proteins were the earliest
abnormal proteins described in 1847 and are
found in patients with multiple myeloma. These
proteins are the light chains of immunoglobulins
and hence occur as either κ or λ form. In a patient,
it may occur as either κ or λ but never in both
forms. BJ proteins have a peculiar property of
coagulating at 40–60 C and redissolving again
at a higher temperature of 80–100 C.
In
multiple
myeloma,
plasma
cells
synthesising IgG, IgA, IgD or IgE are affected.
Myeloma involving IgM-producing plasma cells
is known as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.
This condition is characterised by excessive pro-
duction of the respective myeloma proteins
(M proteins) and that of their light chains
(BJ proteins). BJ protein can also be detected in
amyloidosis cases. The urine dipstick test for
proteins is positive if BJ protein is present. It
can be detected using the conventional electro-
phoresis or capillary zone electrophoresis, while
immunoﬁxation electrophoresis and immunoelec-
trophoresis are used for conﬁrmation. In recent
years, the free light chain assay has become pop-
ular, which measures the concentrations of free κ
or λ light chains. A ratio of κ:λ of 0.26–1.65 is
considered the reference range. Any increase or
decrease from the above lower and upper limits
denotes the presence of excess κ and λ chain
proteins, respectively.
The advancement in understanding the immu-
noglobulin function happened only after studying
myeloma proteins. For example, the immune sera
were absorbed with other myeloma proteins and
were used to identify allotypic, idiotypic and
isotypic.
Heavy Chain Disease
Heavy chain disease (HCD) is a different disor-
der, which is a lymphoid neoplasia, characterised
by an excess production of heavy chains of the
immunoglobulins. This condition is characterised
by the production of truncated monoclonal
isolated heavy chains without the light chains.
There are three varieties, of which the α-HCD is
the commonest form with well-deﬁned features,
while the other two varieties, namely γ-HCD and
μ-HCD, have variable presentations. They are all
rare
types
of
B-cell
lymphoplasma-cell
proliferative disorders. α-HCD presents as lym-
phoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT),
γ-HCD
as
lymphoplasmacytoid
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while μ-HCD can pres-
ent as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or chronic lym-
phocytic leukaemia.
Cryoglobulinemia
Cryoglobulinemia is a condition characterised by
the presence of cryoglobulins in blood. The con-
dition may not always be associated with disease
but is often found in patients with macroglobuli-
nemia,
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
and
myelomas. Most cryoglobulins consist of either
IgG or IgM or their mixed precipitates. In
cryoglobulinemia,

and

on

Antibodies
Antigen Determinants (Paratope)
of Immunoglobulin
There are three major types of immunoglobulin
antigen determinants
or paratopes:
isotypes,
allotypes and idiotypes. These contribute to
immunoglobulin speciﬁcity.
Isotypes
The isotype of an immunoglobulin refers to the
distinct differences in the constant region of the
immunoglobulin’s light or heavy chain. They are
antigenic determinants that characterise the vari-
ous classes and subclasses of heavy chains and
those of light chains. Immunoglobulins are clas-
siﬁed based on various heavy chain isotypes.
Heavy chains are distinguished by the presence
of heavy chain markers, such as μ, γ, α, δ and ɛ in
the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD and
IgE, respectively. The light chains are also distin-
guished by isotype markers, such as κ and γ.
Isotypes are present in all members of a species
and all normal human beings. However, some
individuals with immunodeﬁciencies may lack
one or more isotypes. Anti-isotype antibodies
are used to quantify the immunoglobulin classes
and subclasses and diagnose certain immunodeﬁ-
ciency disorders characterised by the absence or
decreased production of antibodies.
Allotypes
The allotype refers to allelic differences in both
variable and constant regions of immunoglobulin,
and
the
preﬁx
“allo”
means
different
in
individuals of a species. The allotype markers
are present in the constant regions of light and
heavy chains. They are Am on α heavy chains,
Gm on γ heavy chains and Km on κ light chains.
Allotype markers are absent on μ, δ and ɛ heavy
chains and λ light chains. More than 25 Gm types,
3 Km allotypes and 2 Am on IgA have been
described. Allotypes are present in some but not
in all members of a species and are inherited in a
simple Mendelian fashion. Individual allotypes
are present in individual members of a species
but not in all members of species. The allotypes
have importance in monitoring bone marrow
grafts, paternity tests, and forensic medicine for
identifying an individual from blood stains or
semen.
Idiotypes
The idiotype refers to a speciﬁcity that is
associated with the hypervariable region. These
are nothing but antigenic determinants created by
combining sites of an immunoglobulin molecule.
Idiotype markers are found on the Fab fragment
of an antibody molecule in the hypervariable
region of the heavy and light chains. Idiotypes
are speciﬁc for each antibody molecule. Anti-
idiotypic
antibodies
produced
against
Fab
fragments prevent antigen-antibody interaction.
It
has
been
postulated
that
anti-idiotypic
antibodies have a role in regulating immune
responses. These antibodies have been found use-
ful in the therapy of B-cell malignancies and
vaccine development by stimulating B cells to
produce antibodies.
Antibody Diversity
Antibodies have the diversity to respond to a
variety of antigens. Antibody diversity means
the presence of a large number of antibodies that
can bind to a variety of antigens. It is one of the
important structure–function relationships in anti-
gen recognition. Antibody repertoire accounts for
the overall antibodies with different speciﬁcities.
The immune system can create billions of differ-
ent antibodies with a limited number of genes,
possibly by recombining different DNA segments
during B cell development prior to antigen expo-
sure. The gene fragments used during recombina-
tion
determine
the
speciﬁcity
of
generated
antibodies.
Clinical Significance
The development of engineered antibodies could
be possible for therapeutic purposes based on the
knowledge of immunoglobulin genes to treat var-
ious
lymphomas
and
autoimmune
diseases.

Meanwhile, the genetic variation and mutability
in certain viruses cause constantly changing
antigens which could, in turn, generate diverse
immune responses in the host. This poses a sig-
niﬁcant challenge in developing vaccines. For
instance, the human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV) constantly changes its antigen expression
pattern, creating signiﬁcant challenges in devel-
oping a vaccine against it.
Structure of Immunoglobulins
173
Class Switching
During an immune response in the host, B
lymphocytes can switch expression of immuno-
globulin (antibodies) from isotype IgM to other
isotypes IgG, IgE or IgA. This biological mecha-
nism is called immunoglobulin class switching,
also termed class-switch recombination (CSR)
or isotype switching. During this phenomenon,
in the constant region of the antibody, the heavy
chain is changed (switched), but the variable
region of the heavy chain remains the same.
Since the variable region remains unaltered, the
class switching process does not affect the antigen
speciﬁcity and afﬁnity.
Antibody class switching occurs in mature B
cells via its membrane-bound antibody molecule
(termed B-cell receptor) to generate different anti-
body classes. It occurs by a unique type of recom-
bination within special G-rich tandem repeated
DNA sequences (GAGCT and TGGGG) called
switch sites (or SS) located upstream of each
heavy chain. Speciﬁc recombinases bind to these
switch sites and undertake recombination to hap-
pen. Class switching is determined by three cru-
cial factors: (1) switch regions/sites, (2) speciﬁc
switch recombinases and (3) cytokine signals
(e.g. IL-4).
Clinical Significance
Failure in immunoglobulin class switching could
be responsible for various disease complications.
Primary immunodeﬁciency diseases that include
recombination deﬁciencies (Ig CSR deﬁciencies)
or
hyper
IgM
syndromes
(HIGM)
are
characterised by defective CD40 signalling of B
cells. Affected patients’ serum shows low levels
of IgG and IgA, but in contrast normal or elevated
levels of IgM, leading to the increased suscepti-
bility of an individual to frequent bacterial
infections of the skin and respiratory tract.
Genetic Regulations of Immunoglobulin
Production
The human body can produce an innumerable
number of different antibodies with different
speciﬁcities. This type of diversity is possible
because of three reasons: the presence of a large
number of genes for the variable regions of the
heavy and light chains in the embryonic life;
DNA deletions and rearrangements and RNA
splicing resulting in the generation of a large
number of B cell lineages encoding different
heavy and light chains; and high frequency of
mutations in the heavy and light chains. It is to
be noted that different chromosomes encode the
heavy and light chains: Chromosome 14 encodes
for heavy chains, while chromosomes 2 and
22 encode for the κ and λ light chains.
Antibody diversity is generated in two stages:
somatic
recombination
and
somatic
hypermutation.
Somatic Recombination of V(D)J
Recombination
V(D)J stands for Variable, Diverse and Joining
regions recombinations. B cell maturation results
in splicing out the DNA of all genes from each
region except one and combining the three
remaining genes to form one VDJ segment.
Each of these three regions contains multiple
gene segments. The heavy chain gene contains
gene segments of all three regions, but the light
chain gene lacks the D region. V(D)J segment,
along with a constant region gene, is the back-
ground for subsequent antibody production. For
the heavy chains of antibodies and the β and δ
genes of the T-cell receptor, one D and one J
segments are chosen and brought together to
form the D-J rearrangement. Next, a V region is
selected and joined with the D-J segment to form
a complete VDJ exon. Rearrangements for the
immunoglobulin light chain genes and the α and

γ genes of T-cell receptors occur in a single V-J
recombination step due to the absence of a D
segment from both loci. As a result of DNA
rearrangement, one copy of each type of gene
segment can go to any given lymphocyte,
generating an enormous antibody diversity to
the tune of 3  1011 combinations. The whole
process occurs in the bone marrow for B cells and
the thymus for T cells. There is a near-random
manner in which V, D and J segments combine
and this random nature results in the vast diversity
of proteins that can match the innumerable
antigens in nature.
174
13
Antibodies
Somatic Hypermutation
B cell activation results in rapid cell division, and,
as a consequence, the genes encoding the variable
regions of both heavy and light chains undergo a
high rate of point mutation. This causes diversiﬁ-
cation of B-cell receptors so that the immune
system adapts itself to recognise the plethora of
antigens encountered by it during an individual’s
lifetime. This process is highly programmed so
that only one nucleotide change per variable gene
per cell division occurs. As a result, both high-
afﬁnity
and
low-afﬁnity
antibodies
can
be
generated,
but
normally
the
high-afﬁnity
antibodies
out-compete
the
low-afﬁnity
antibodies for better function and survival. This
phenomenon is termed afﬁnity maturation.
Monoclonal Antibodies
Antibodies that arise from a single clone of cells
(e.g. myeloma) are homogeneous and are called
monoclonal antibodies. For example, in multiple
myeloma, antibodies are produced by a single
clone of plasma cells against a single antigenic
determinant, and hence antibodies are monoclo-
nal. The monoclonal antibodies differ from poly-
clonal antibodies, which are heterologous and
formed by several different clones of plasma
cells in response to antigen.
Kohler and Milstein, in 1975, were the ﬁrst to
describe a method for producing monoclonal
antibodies against the desired antigen, for which
they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1984.
Monoclonal antibodies are produced by the
fusion of myeloma cells with antibody-producing
cells, resulting in the production of hybridomas.
Such hybridomas produce virtually unlimited
antibodies
that
are
useful
in
research
and
diagnostics.
Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies
Hybridoma cells are prepared in the following
ways (Fig. 13.7):
•
First, an animal (e.g. mouse) is immunised
with the antigen of interest.
•
Spleen cells (lymphocytes) are then fused with
mouse myeloma cells and grown in culture,
which is deﬁcient in the enzyme hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT).
•
Fusion of the cells is facilitated by adding
certain chemicals, such as polyethylene glycol.
The fused cells are grown in a special culture
medium (HAT medium) that supports the
growth of the fused hybrid cells but not of
the parent cells.
•
Finally, the resulting clones of cells are
screened to produce antibodies to the antigen
of interest.
•
These clones are then selected for continuous
cultivation.
The
hybridomas
can
be
maintained indeﬁnitely and will continue to
produce
monoclonal
antibodies.
Myeloma
cell provides hybrid cell immortality, whereas
splenic plasma cell provides the antibody-
producing capacity.
Humanised (Chimeric) Monoclonal
Antibodies
Since mouse monoclonal antibodies are not suit-
able for human therapeutic use, humanised mono-
clonal antibodies, called chimeric antibodies,
have been produced with modiﬁcation of the
original
technique.
The
chimeric
antibodies
consisting of human constant regions and mouse
variable regions are being prepared for use in the
treatment of leukaemia. Chimeric antibodies are
also used to kill tumour cells by delivering toxins,
such as diphtheria, to tumour cells or by killing
tumour
cells
through
complement-mediated
cytotoxicity.

Application of Monoclonal Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies are now used widely in
research and therapeutics. They are used in vari-
ous clinical situations, such as to treat cancer and
autoimmune diseases. They are used to induce
immunosuppression in transplant surgery and
prevent infectious diseases. They are extensively
used in diagnostic applications in bacterial, viral,
parasitic
and
other
infections.
Monoclonal
antibodies are used widely as diagnostic reagents
in
ELISA,
immunoﬂuorescence
and
other
techniques in diagnostic microbiology.
Antibody Engineering
Recent advances in biotechnology have made
possible the development of human monoclonal
antibodies. This was made possible by fusing
human genes (of a particular antibody fragment)
and bacteriophage genes. Bacteria were then
infected with these bacteriophages to produce
large
quantities
of
desired
antibodies.
This
approach has been successfully employed to
build whole libraries of antibodies. This approach
has made revolutionary changes in the ﬁeld of
immunotherapy.

Complement System
14
The term complement refers to the ability of
some non-speciﬁc proteins in human serum to
complement, that is, augment the effects of other
immune system components. The complement
system, an important component of the human
innate host defence system, consists of approxi-
mately 20 proteins present in normal human
serum.
The Complement
The complement system is an extremely powerful
system comprising rapidly acting glycoproteins,
several pro-enzymes and components, called trig-
gered enzyme cascades. Each pro-enzyme in the
enzyme cascade
activates
molecules of the
succeeding component culminating in amplifying
the response at each step. The complement sys-
tem also includes kinin and ﬁbrinolytic and the
coagulation
system.
All
normal
individuals
always have complement components in their
blood.
Properties of Complement
Complement is present in sera of all mammals,
including
humans,
and
in
lower
animals,
including birds, amphibians and ﬁshes. These
are heat-labile substances that are inactivated by
heating serum at 56 C for 30 min. These are
glycoproteins and are synthesised primarily by
liver
cells
and
to
a
very
less
extent
by
macrophages and many other cell types. The syn-
thesis
rate
of
the
various
complement
glycoproteins increases when complement is
activated and consumed.

The complement usually does not bind to the
antigen or antibody but only to the antigen–anti-
body complex. The importance of the comple-
ment lies in the fact that it contributes to both
the
acquired
and
innate
immunities
of
an
individual.
Nomenclature of Complement
Complement
components
are
designated
by
numerals, namely, C1–9. These components cir-
culate in the plasma as pro-enzymes that are
functionally inactive. Activation involves cleav-
age by proteolysis into peptide fragments. The
fragments
are
designated
with
lowercase
sufﬁxes—for example, C3 is cleaved into two
fragments, C3a and C3b. Normally, the large
fragment is designated “b”, and the small frag-
ment
“a”.
However,
for
historical
reasons,

concerning the fragments of C2, the large frag-
ment is designated C2a, and the small one is
designated C2b.

Complement System
Components of Complement
The main components of the complement system
are all protein molecules with different functions.
These
include
the
complement
protein
C;
factors P, B and D; mannose-binding lectin
(MBL); and MBL serine proteases (MASP).
C1 Complex
This complex consists of a single C1q molecule
bound to two molecules, each of C1r and C1s.
C1q is a calcium-dependent sugar-binding pro-
tein that belongs to the collectin family of
proteins. When C1q binds to a pathogen, it causes
a conformational change in the C1r-C1s compo-
nent. This leads to activation of C1r, which has
enzymatic activity and causes cleavage of C1s, an
active serine protease. C1q forms a bridge
between innate and adaptive systems since it can
bind directly to a pathogen and antigen–antibody
complex. The activated C1 enzymes act on C4
and C2, causing their cleavage and initiating the
classical pathway.
Factor P (Properdin)
It is a positive regulatory factor capable of bind-
ing to microbial surface and stabilising the C3b.
Bb complex in the alternative pathway. Its deﬁ-
ciency predisposes the individual to meningococ-
cal infections.
Factors B, D
These are components of the alternative pathway.
Factor D is a protease that can cleave Factor B to
Ba and Bb.
MBL and MASP
Mannose- or mannan-binding lectin is a serum
protein that binds to the mannose residue on
bacterial and viral surfaces. It is similar to C1q
and belongs to the same collectin family. MASP-
1 and MASP-2 are two enzymes, and MBL forms
a complex with them. The binding of the MBL
complex to a pathogen surface causes activation
of MASP-1 and MASP-2, resulting in cleavage of
C4 and C2. In this way, the lectin pathway causes
complement activation analogous to the classical
pathway.
Functions of Complement
There are four main effects of complement.
1. It causes lysis of cells (such as bacteria,
viruses, allografts and tumour cells).
2. It generates mediators of chemotaxis that par-
ticipate in triggering speciﬁc cell functions,
inﬂammation and secretion of immunoregula-
tory molecules.
3. It facilitates opsonisation, the process by
which bacteria are more readily and more efﬁ-
ciently engulfed by phagocytes.
4. It
causes
immune
clearance,
in
which
immune complexes from the circulation are
removed and are transported to the spleen
and liver.
Complement Activation
Complement activation occurs through any of the
following three pathways: (1) classical pathway,
(2) alternative or properdin pathway and
(3) lectin pathway. Of these, alternative and lec-
tin pathways are important in the host’s innate
immunity since they activate the complement
system when the human host is infected by a
microorganism for the ﬁrst time because the anti-
body required to trigger the classical pathway is
not present.
All three activation pathways lead to the activa-
tion of C3, resulting in the production of C3b.
Hence, C3b is the central molecule in activating
the complement cascade. The C3b has two critical
functions to perform. First, it combines with other
components of the complement to produce C5
convertase, the enzyme that leads to the production
of membrane attack complex (MAC); and sec-
ond, it opsonises bacteria due to the presence of
receptors for C3b on the surface of the phagocytes.

The Complement
179
The ﬁnal steps leading to the formation of an
MAC are the same in all the pathways. A sequen-
tial, rapid cascading pattern ensues when these
complement components are activated, which can
break away or bind to a previously activated com-
plement component complex. Usually, once each
component is activated, it ampliﬁes the successive
steps in the series by activating many other
molecules involved in the cascading process.
Classical Pathway of Complement
Activation
The classical pathway is a chain of events in
which complement components react in speciﬁc
sequences as a cascade resulting in cell lysis. It is
activated by an antibody bound to antigen but
never by the native or free antibody.
Activators of the Classical Pathway
The classical pathway of complement is activated
by immunoglobulins IgM and IgG. Usually, the
most
efﬁcient
immunoglobulins
are
IgG3,
followed by IgG1 and IgG2. IgG4 do not show
their efﬁciency in activating the classical path-
way. Native, free IgG or IgM do not activate the
complement system. A single, native IgG mole-
cule will not bind and activate the complement
pathway. However, if antibodies of the IgG class
are aggregated by antigen binding, this will result
in complement ﬁxation and activation. Antigen–
antibody complex formation helps induce the Fc
portion of the IgM molecule, which exposes a
binding site for the C1 component of the comple-
ment system to undergo conformational changes.
The classical pathway is also activated by
Staphylococcal protein A, C-reactive protein and
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
Steps in Activation of the Classical Pathway
Activation of the classical pathway of the com-
plement system is usually very simple; it begins
with the reaction of soluble antigen–antibody
complex (immune complexes) formation or in
the presence of a suitable target (a bacterial cell)
the antibody binds to the antigen (Fig. 14.1). Fol-
lowing are the sequential steps in the activation of
the classical pathway:
1. Activation of C1 is the ﬁrst step in the cas-
cade of classical pathway activation. The C1 is
a
complex
of
three
different
types
of
molecules: C1q, C1r and C1s. C1q ﬁrst
combines with the Fc portion of the bound
antibody, IgM or IgG. C1q has six combining
sites. Effective activation occurs after C1q is
attached to IgM or IgG by at least two of its
binding sites. Two IgG molecules or one mol-
ecule of IgM can therefore initiate this process.
2. Binding of C1 to the antigen–antibody com-
plex is the next step. C1q binding in the pres-
ence of calcium ions leads to activation of C1r
and C1s, leading to C1qrs complex. Activated
C1s is an esterase that splits C4 into two
fragments: a small soluble fragment (C4a)
and
a
larger
fragment
(C4b).
C4a
has
anaphylatoxin activity, and C4b binds to the
cell membrane along with C1.
3. C4b in the presence of Mg2+ splits C2 into C2a
and C2b. The smaller fragment (C2b) diffuses
away, while the larger fragment (C2a) remains
attached to C4b. The resulting C4b2a complex
possesses enzymatic activity and is called C3
convertase,
which
converts
C3
into
an
active form.
4. The C3 convertase activates thousands of C3
molecules and splits these molecules into C3a
and C3b. One single molecule of C3 can gen-
erate more than 200 molecules of C3b, which
results in massive ampliﬁcation of the cascad-
ing reaction at this step. At this juncture, C3b
binds with C4b2a to give rise to a trimolecular
complex called C4b2a3b, which is also known
as C5 convertase. Then this C5 convertase
enzyme splits the C5 molecule into two sepa-
rate molecules, C5a and C5b, in which C5a
diffuses
away,
while
the
C5b
molecule
attaches to another new molecule that is C6
to initiate the formation of C5b-9 complex,
otherwise known as MAC.
Formation of the MAC: This involves the par-
ticipation of the complement components C5b,
C6, C7, C8 and C9. The initial step in the MAC
formation is the cleavage of C5 with the forma-
tion of C5b. Then, C5b binds to C6, and the

resulting C5b,6 complex binds to C7. As a result
of these reactions, a conformational change
occurs, and a hydrophobic site is exposed on
C7, which then inserts into the cell membrane
through its lipid layer. In the subsequent stages,
C8 and C9 also get bound to C5b,6,7 with the
exposure of their hydrophobic sites and insertion
into the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. The
polymerisation
of
10–16
molecules
of
C9
induced by C8 results in the pore-forming com-
plex or MAC, represented as C5b,6,7,8,9. Elec-
tron microscopic studies have shown that the
MAC has a hydrophobic external end that helps
in binding and a hydrophilic internal channel. The
channel has a diameter of about 100 Å, which
allows the cell’s internal contents to leak out. It
also causes disturbance of proton gradient of the
cell membrane, attack by lysozyme and eventual
destruction of the cell (Fig. 14.2).

Alternative Pathway of Complement
Activation
Pillemer ﬁrst described the alternative pathway in
1954. It differs from the classical pathway in
(1) the nature of activating substances and
(2) the sequence of events itself. The alternative
pathway is unique in not requiring antigen–anti-
body complexes to activate the complement. This
pathway does not depend on antibodies and does
not involve the early complement components
(C1, C2 and C4) for activation of the comple-
ment. It, therefore, can be activated before the
establishment of an immune response to the
infecting pathogen (Fig. 14.3).
Activators: of the alternative pathway of com-
plement activation include (1) IgA, (2) IgD,

and (5) nephritic factor.
The Complement
181
Fig. 14.3 Alternative
pathway of activation of the
complement
Steps of Activation of Alternative Pathway
The initial component of the alternative pathway
involves four serum proteins: C3b, factor B, fac-
tor D and properdin.
1. In the ﬁrst step, a serum protein called factor B
(C3 pro-activator) binds with C3b to form the
C3bB complex. The Mg2+, the only ion
required to activate the alternative pathway,
stabilises the interaction between C3b and
factor B.
2. The C3bB is split into two fragments, Ba and
Bb, by another serum protein called factor D
(C3 pro-activator convertase). The Ba is
released into the medium, and the Bb binds
to C3b, forming the C3bBb complex, which
possesses the C3 convertase activity.
3. The C3bBb complex is extremely labile and
has a half-life of only 5 min, but by binding
with properdin (also called factor P), it
stabilises C3 convertase, which becomes heat
stable.
4. The C3 convertase then hydrolyses C3 to pro-
duce the MAC, ﬁnally, leading to further steps
in the cascade, in the same way as occurs in the
classical pathway.
Lectin Pathway of Complement Activation
Lectin pathway utilises all the components of
classical pathway activation, except the C1
proteins. As the name suggests, the lectin path-
way is triggered by the mannose-binding lectins.
The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is one such
acute-phase protein produced during the inﬂam-
matory response that takes part in this pathway of
complement activation. MBL is a large serum
protein that binds to non-reduced mannose, fruc-
tose and glucosamine on Neisseria, Salmonella,
Listeria,
Candida
albicans,
Cryptococcus
neoformans
and
other
cell
surfaces
with

mannose-containing polysaccharides (mannans)
(Fig. 14.4).

The function of MBL is similar to that of C1q.
Binding of MBL to a pathogen results in the
secretion
of
two
MBL-associated
serine
proteases: MASP-1 and MASP-2, similar to C1r
and C1s, respectively. For activation of MASPs, a
trimolecular complex formation of MBL/MASP-
1/MASP-2 is required and forms a C1-like active
complex. Subsequently, it causes cleavage and
activation of C4 and C2 to produce C5 convertase
without any need for speciﬁc antibody binding.
Subsequently, it proceeds to produce MAC in the
same way that occurs in the classical and alterna-
tive pathways.
The formation of the MAC is the terminal
sequence of all three different pathways, includ-
ing the classical pathway. All three pathways
converge at the step involving the formation of
the MAC. The MAC forms a transmembrane
channel of 100 Å diameter in the cell. That allows
the free exchange of ions between the cell and its
surrounding medium. In turn, this results in a
rapid increase in osmotic pressure of the cell due
to the rapid inﬂux of ions into the cell and their
association
with
cytoplasmic
proteins.
Ulti-
mately, this would lead to a rapid inﬂux of water
molecules inside the cell, swelling of the cell and
some cell types may also rupture, resulting in cell
lysis.
Differences between classical, alternative and
lectin pathways are summarised in Table 14.1.
Regulation of Complement Activation
Since the complement system involves the forma-
tion of many biologically active substances, many
regulatory systems prevent unwarranted damage
to the human host. The following are regulators of
the complement activation.
Inhibitors
C1 esterase inhibitors (C1sINH) are present in
normal serum. These prevent the formation and
function of the C1qrs complex by causing C1s to
dissociate from C1qrs. The C1sINH inhibitor is a
heat-labile alpha serum. It also inhibits multiple
esterases found in blood, including plasmin,
kininogen and the Hageman factor. This inhibitor
will not prevent normal complement cascade but
would check autolytic prolongation of comple-
ment pathways. S protein is another example of
a complement pathway inhibitor. The S proteins
are present in normal serum and bind to C67,
thereby controlling the cytolytic action of the
MAC (Fig. 14.5).
Inactivators
Multiple substances have inhibitory effects over
different steps of the activation sequence of the
classical pathway. These are considered to be host
cell protective mechanisms. These include:
1. Factor Ia serum beta-globulin, earlier called
C3b, C4bINAC or conglutinogen-activating

in

C3
activation.
3. Anaphylatoxin activator, an alpha-globulin,
has the enzymatic ability to break down the
anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a) released
during complement pathways.
4. C4-binding protein checks the activity of cell-
bound C4b.
5. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is another
inhibitory substance located in a large variety
of host cell membranes. This factor is termed
so because it can accelerate the dissociation of
active C4b2a complexes by stopping their
ability to activate native C. Additionally,
DAF can also bind to membrane-bound C4b
and C3b to prevent its subsequent interaction
with C2a and factor B, respectively, because of

184
14
Complement System
which the formation of two types of C3
convertases (C4b2a and C3bBb) will be
stopped. Due to this, C3 breakdown would
decrease, and the host cells tend to undergo
sparing
from
complement-mediated
mem-
brane damage.
Regulation of alternative pathway
The alternative pathway has its own set of regu-
latory proteins and mechanisms. It is mediated by
the binding of factor H to C3b and cleavage of
this complex by speciﬁc plasma inhibitor factor I,
a protease. This reduces the amount of C5
convertase available.
Biological Effects of Complement
The central role of complement is to amplify the
humoral immune response. Through its various
products, the complement participates in the
inﬂammatory response, opsonisation of antigen,
viral neutralisation and clearance of immune
complexes (Fig. 14.6). The biological effects of
complement systems are described as follows.
Fig. 14.6 Biological
effects of complement
system
Phagocytosis
C5a
is
a
chemotactic
molecule
speciﬁcally
recognised by polymorphonuclear leukocytes or
phagocytic cells. This chemical substance is
responsible for the migration of leukocytes to a
tissue, where an antigen–antibody reaction is
occurring. At that speciﬁc reaction site, phago-
cytic cells start to recognise the opsonised
particles, and ﬁnally, the cell engulfs them inside
and neutralises.
The C5a has a role in the chemotaxis of
neutrophils. Similarly, it also activates these
cells, which in turn cause their reversible aggre-
gation and release some stored enzymes such as
proteases. It also enhances the adhesiveness of
neutrophils to the endothelium.
Opsonisation
Complement plays a vital role in the opsonisation
of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Bacteria and
viruses are easily phagocytosed by phagocytic
cells in the presence of complement component
C3b. This is because the receptors for the C3b
component are present on the surface of many
phagocytes.

The Complement
185
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Complement participates in type II (cytotoxic)
and type III (immune complex) hypersensitivity
reactions. The C3a, C4a and C5a components
stimulate degranulation of mast cells with the
release of mediators, such as histamine. Upon
binding with basophils and mast cell receptors,
the C3a fragments induce them to release vasoac-
tive molecules such as heparin and histamine.
Once histamine is released into the tissues, it
causes an increased blood capillary permeability
and contraction of smooth muscles. Further,
ﬂuids are released into the surrounding tissue,
causing tissue swelling and oedema.
These two molecules, C3a and C5a, have been
reported to possess direct activity on endothelial
cells resulting in increased vascular permeability.
The end consequences are more or less similar to
a classical anaphylactic reaction where IgE
antibodies bound to the mast cells and basophil
membranes react with the corresponding antigen.
Hence,
C3a
and
C5a
are
also
called
anaphylatoxins.
Cytolysis
Complement mediates cytolysis. Insertion of
C5b–9 complex (MAC) into the cell membrane
leads to killing or lysis of erythrocytes, bacteria
and tumour cells. The insertion of the MAC com-
plex results in disruption of the membrane, lead-
ing to the entry of water and electrolytes into
the cell.
Autoimmune Diseases
In autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid
arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, the
levels of the complement system components are
reduced in serum. The complement system also
plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and disease
progression of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
Endotoxic Shock
Endotoxin elicits a robust immune response; it is
also an efﬁcient activator of the alternative com-
plement pathway. Therefore, there will be a mas-
sive C3 ﬁxation and platelet adherence during
endotoxic shock. Because of the huge destruction
of platelets, the platelet factors are released into
the blood, resulting in disseminated intravascular
coagulation and thrombocytopenia. Similar path-
ogenesis mechanisms may be observed in Gram-
negative
bacterial
septicaemia
and
dengue
haemorrhagic fever. Shwartzman reaction is a
rare reaction of a body to an endotoxin, which
results in thrombosis in the affected tissue. Pro-
tection against Shwartzman reaction is conferred
in individuals with depleted complement levels in
their serum.
Generally,
the
complement
system
gets
activated on Gram-negative bacterial invasion,
but some Gram-negative and most Gram-positive
bacteria have evolved immune-evasion strategies
to overcome the complement-mediated damage
and are listed in Table 14.2.
Conglutination
In bovine serum, there is an unusual protein pres-
ent called conglutinin (K). This protein is respon-
sible for clumping particles or cells coated with
C. This type of agglutination reaction is called
conglutination. Conglutinin always binds with
the C3 molecule only. Therefore, conglutinin
acts as an antibody to C. However, it is not an
immunoglobulin molecule, but it necessitates the
presence of Ca2+ for its activity. Immunisation
with complement-coated materials can be useful
in producing antibodies with conglutinin-like
activity such as immunoconglutinin (IK).
Deficiency of Complement
Complement plays a vital role in the well-being of
humans. The deﬁciency of various components
may result in many diseases. Angioedema is
caused by an inherited deﬁciency of C1 esterase
inhibitors. The low level of C1 esterase inhibitors
leads to overproduction of esterase. This leads to
an increase in the release of anaphylatoxins,
which cause capillary permeability and oedema.
Complement-mediated haemolysis is caused by
acquired deﬁciency of DAF. The condition
manifests clinically as paroxysmal nocturnal
haemoglobinuria. Inherited or acquired deﬁ-
ciency of C5–8 components greatly enhance sus-
ceptibility to Neisseria bacteraemia and other

Pathogen
Mechanism of evasion
Examples
infections. Deﬁciency of C3 leads to severe
recurrent pyogenic sinusitis and respiratory
infections. The synthesis of sufﬁcient quantities
of complement is reduced in patients with severe
liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis or alco-
holic cirrhosis. These patients, therefore, are
highly susceptible to infections caused by pyo-
genic
bacteria.

example, C1 is synthesised in the intestinal epi-
thelium, C2 and C4 in the macrophages, C5 and
C8 in the spleen and C3, C6 and C9 in the liver.
There is an increase in C3, C4, C5 and C6 in the
acute phase of inﬂammation. Complement and

disease process. Recurrent infections, mainly by
Neisseria spp. due to complement defects, auto-

where complement quantitation is indicated.
The Complement
187
Various methods are available for complement
estimation differing in sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
They can be grouped as follows:
Functional Assays
Total Complement Activity of the Classical,
Lectin and Alternative Pathways
The total complement activity can be assessed
by the haemolytic tests, which were the ﬁrst
test developed for this purpose. The assay can
be performed using antibody-sensitised sheep
erythrocytes in tubes or agarose gel. The test
is reported as reciprocal of the sample dilution
causing
50%
(CH50)
or
100%
(CH100)
haemolysis. Guinea pig, rabbit or chicken red
blood cell (RBC) is employed for detecting
alternate pathway activity (AH50). Enzyme-
linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
tests
have also been developed where the functional
activity of the three pathways can be detected
using immobilised IgM, lipopolysaccharide or
mannose, which act as activators of the classi-
cal,
alternative
and
lectin
pathways,
respectively.
Activity of Individual Components
Here, plasma from which complement has been
removed is taken and puriﬁed speciﬁc comple-
ment protein is added to it so that the haemolytic
activity for that pathway is regained.
Immunochemical Assays
Radial immunodiffusion, ELISA or nephelometry
can detect and quantify individual complement
components. C3 and C4 components are com-
monly measured in many laboratories by these
methods.
Analysis of Complement Activation
Products
In contrast to the haemolytic assays or quantiﬁca-
tion of individual components, the analysis of the
increase in complement activation in disease
conditions gives a more realistic picture. Newer
assays using monoclonal antibodies in a capture
ELISA format can detect the activation products
at different stages and individual pathways.
C1rs-C1 inhibitor, C4d and C4bc for the classical
pathway; Ba, Bb and C3bBbP in the alternative
pathway; C3 and its activation products; and
ﬁnally, the C5b-9 terminal product all can be
measured by this technique and are commercially
available.
Assays for Complement-Binding
Autoantibodies
C1q or C1 inhibitor autoantibodies can be
measured in a patient’s serum using puriﬁed com-
plement as antigen by ELISA.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions
15
The interactions between antigens and antibodies
are known as antigen–antibody reactions. The
reactions are highly speciﬁc, and an antigen reacts
only with antibodies produced by itself or with
closely related antigens.
The antigen–antibody reactions have many
uses. Since these reactions are essentially speciﬁc,
they have been used in the laboratory for the
diagnosis of infectious diseases by detection of
either the antigen or the antibody in vitro. The
antigen and antibody reactions also form the basis
of immunity against microbial diseases in vivo. It
may
cause
tissue
injury in
hypersensitivity
reactions and autoimmune diseases in the host.
General Features of Antigen–Antibody
Reactions
Antigen and antibody reactions show the follow-
ing features:
1. Antigen–antibody reactions usually show a
high degree of speciﬁcity. This is because an
antigen combines only with a homologous
antibody and vice versa. The speciﬁcity, how-
ever, is not absolute. However, cross-reactions
between antigens and antibodies are some-
times responsible for causing diseases in
hosts and for showing false and positive labo-
ratory tests.
2. During the antigen–antibody reaction, not
fragments but entire molecules react, and

189
there is no irreversible chemical alteration in
either antigens or antibodies.
3. Electrostatic, hydrogen, van der Waals and
hydrophobic interactions are the intermolecu-
lar
forces
involved
in
antigen–antibody
reactions.
4. The antigen–antibody combination occurs
at the surface. For that reason, the “good ﬁt”
between an antigenic determinant and an
antibody-combining site determines the stabil-
ity of the antigen–antibody reaction. Multiple
bonding between the antigen and the antibody
ensures that the antigen will be bound tightly
to the antibodies.
5. Both antigens and antibodies participate in the
formation of precipitates and agglutinates.
6. The combination of the antigen and antibody
molecules is ﬁrm but reversible. The ﬁrm-
ness of the reaction is inﬂuenced by afﬁnity
and avidity.
Afﬁnity denotes the intensity of attraction
between
antigen
and
antibody.
Low-afﬁnity
antibodies bind antigen weakly and tend to disso-
ciate readily, whereas high-afﬁnity antibodies bind
antigen more tightly and remain bound longer.
High-afﬁnity binding is believed to result from a
very close ﬁt between the antigen-binding sites and
the corresponding antigenic determinants that
facilitate the development of strong non-covalent
interactions between antigen and antibody.
Avidity measures the overall strength of bind-
ing
of
an
antigen
with
many
antigenic

determinants and multivalent antibodies. Avidity
is a better indicator of the strength of interactions
in real biological systems than afﬁnity. Therefore,
the avidity of an antigen–antibody reaction is
dependent on the valencies of both antigens and
antibodies and is greater than the sum total of
individual afﬁnities.
190
15
Antigen–Antibody Reactions
Stages in Antigen–Antibody Reactions
The antigen–antibody reaction occurs in three
stages: primary, secondary and tertiary:
Primary Stage
The primary stage is the initial interaction
between antigen and antibody. It is rapid and
reversible but without any visible effects. The
ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals
forces and hydrophobic interactions are the
weaker intermolecular forces that bind antigen
and antibodies together in this primary stage.
However, covalent binding, a stronger intermo-
lecular force between antigen and antibody, does
not occur in this stage. The primary reaction can
be measured by estimating both free and bound
antigens or antibodies separately in the reaction
mixture. Several methods, including radioactive
isotopes,
ﬂuorescent
dyes,
ferritin
or
other
markers, are used for this purpose.
Secondary Stage
The secondary stage is an irreversible interaction
between antigen and antibody, with visible
effects,
such
as
agglutination,
precipitation,
neutralisation,
complement
ﬁxation
and
immobilisation of motile organisms. The binding
between antigen and antibody during this stage
occurs by covalent binding. A single antibody is
capable of causing different types of antigen–
antibody reactions, and a single antigen is capable
of inducing the production of different classes of
immunoglobulins, which differ in their biological
properties.

The results of agglutination, precipitation,
neutralisation
and
other
tests
are
usually
expressed as a titre. Titre is the highest dilution
of serum that gives a positive reaction in the test.
A higher titre means a greater level of antibodies
in serum. For example, a serum with a titre of
1/128 contains more antibodies than a serum with
a titre of 1/8.
Tertiary Stage
Some in vivo antigen–antibody reaction turns into
a chain reaction, leading to neutralisation or
destruction of injurious antigen. Tissue damage
can be seen in clinical allergies and other immu-
nological diseases. Humoral immune response
against infectious diseases involves the tertiary
stage of antigen–antibody reaction.
Depending on the type of serological reaction,
various immunoglobulin classes react differently
(Table 15.1).
Measurement of Antigen
and Antibody
The antigens and antibodies involved in primary,
secondary and tertiary stages of antigen–antibody
reaction can be measured by various methods.
The unit of measurement may be in terms of
mass, units and titre value. Usually, antibodies
are titrated against sera. On the other hand,
antigens may also be measured using titration.
The serum antibody titre is the highest dilution
of the serum in which observable reaction against
the speciﬁc antigen can be seen. Sensitivity and
speciﬁcity are the two critical parameters of all
serological tests.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
191
Sensitivity (true-positive rate) is the ability
of a particular test to detect antibodies or antigens
in very small quantities. A highly sensitive test
does not miss any positive cases. That is, false-
negative results will be absent or minimal.
Speciﬁcity (true-negative rate) is the ability
of a particular test to correctly identify speciﬁc
antigens or antibodies present in a homologous
mixture. Highly speciﬁc tests do not show any
false-positive reactions. As the number of false-
positive cases increases, the speciﬁcity of that
particular test decreases.
Generally,
sensitivity
and
speciﬁcity
are
inversely proportional.
Quantitative Assays
These are used to get the actual concentration of
an antigen or, more commonly, an antibody in a
sample. In the older immunoassays, different
dilutions of the sample were used to ﬁnd out
the endpoint, and the reciprocal of the dilution
or the titre was taken as an indirect measure of the
quantity of the analyte in the sample. Widal
agglutination
test
or
the
classical
Venereal
Diseases Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests are
examples of such types of immunoassays. In
recent years, technological advances have helped
in accurate determination of the analyte in the
sample
to
micro-
or
pico-gram
levels.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
Fluorescent immunoassay, Chemiluminescence
immunoassay,
Microarray
immunoassay
and
some Point-of-care assays can accurately quantify
an antibody or antigen in a sample. Detection of
protective antibody levels by ELISA after vacci-
nation by hepatitis B or tetanus toxoid are two
such areas of application.
Qualitative Assays
In contrast to quantitative assays, in many
situations, the mere presence or absence of an
antigen or antibody in a specimen is enough to
conclude a patient’s disease condition. In such
cases, any classical tests like agglutination or
precipitation test or modern techniques like
ELISA or Fluorescent antibody test can be
performed.
Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used
in the Laboratory
Antigen-antibody reaction-based tests are widely
used in the laboratory to detect either serum
antibodies or antigens to diagnose a wide variety
of infectious diseases. These tests are also used to
diagnose autoimmune diseases and in typing
blood
and
tissues
before
transplantation
(Table 15.2).
Precipitation Reaction
Precipitation is a type of antigen–antibody reac-
tion in which the antigen occurs in a soluble form.
A precipitation test is a test in which an antibody
interacts with the soluble antigen in the presence
of an electrolyte at a speciﬁed pH and temperature
to produce a precipitate. A lattice is formed
between the antigens and antibodies; it is visible
as an insoluble precipitate in certain cases. Lattice
formation depends on the afﬁnity of both the
antigen and antibody. Antibodies that aggregate
soluble antigens are called precipitins. Instead of
sedimenting, the reaction is known as ﬂocculation
when
the
precipitate
remains
suspended as
ﬂoccules. For a precipitate to occur, antibody
must have a bivalent structure of the binding
site; a precipitate will not form with monovalent
Fab fragments. In addition, the antigen must have
at least two copies of the same epitope or have
different
epitopes
that
react
with
different
antibodies present in polyclonal antisera; the anti-
gen must be either bivalent or polyvalent in
nature.
Mechanism of Precipitation
Antigen and antibody reaction occurs optimally
only when the proportion of the antigen and anti-
body in the reaction mixture is equivalent (zone
of equivalence; Fig. 15.1). On either side of the
equivalence
zone,
precipitation is
prevented

because of an excess of either antigen or anti-
body. The zone of antibody excess is known as
the pro-zone phenomenon, and the zone of anti-
gen
excess
is
known
as
the
post-zone
phenomenon.

Fig. 15.1 Prozone
phenomenon
Marrack, in 1934, proposed the lattice hypoth-
esis to explain the precipitation mechanism. The
Marrack hypothesis assumes that each antibody
molecule must have at least two binding sites, and
an antigen must be multivalent.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
193
Fig. 15.2 Marrack lattice hypothesis
In the zone of equivalence where optimum
precipitation occurs, the number of multivalent
sites of antigen and antibody is approximately
equal. In this zone, precipitation occurs due to
random, reversible reactions whereby each anti-
body binds to more than one antigen and vice
versa, forming a stable network or lattice—com-
bining the results in a multimolecular lattice that
increases in size until it precipitates out of
solution.
There is too much antibody in the pro-zone
phenomenon for efﬁcient lattice formation. This
is because the antigen combines with only a few
antibodies, and no cross-linkage is formed.
In
the
post-zone
phenomenon,
small
aggregates are surrounded by excess antigen,
and again no lattice network is formed. Thus,
for precipitation reactions to be detectable, they
must
be
run
in
the
zone
of
equivalence
(Fig. 15.2).
The pro-zone and post-zone phenomena are
considered in the interpretation of serological
tests because false-negative reactions can occur
in either of these conditions. A false-negative
reaction suspected to be due to the pro-zone phe-
nomenon can be rectiﬁed by diluting the antibody
and performing the test. In the post-zone phenom-
enon, excess antigen presence might lead to
obscure results due to fewer antibodies. Typi-
cally, such a test should be repeated with an
additional patient sample taken about a week
later. The delay would allow the immune system
for the further production of antibodies. If the test
results are negative, it is unlikely that the patient
has that particular antibody.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions
Application of Precipitation Reactions
Precipitation reactions are sensitive for the detec-
tion of antigen. Antigen as little as 1 μg of protein
can be detected by this method. They are less
sensitive for the detection of antibodies. They
are employed (1) in a diagnostic microbiology
laboratory, by using the VDRL test for syphilis,
grouping streptococci by the Lance ﬁeld tech-
nique, detection of toxigenicity of Corynebacte-
rium diphtheriae etc.; (2) for identiﬁcation of
blood and seminal stains in forensic science; and
(3) for detection of food adulterants in food and
food products.
Types of Precipitation Reactions
Precipitation reactions can be broadly of three
types:
Precipitation in Solution
Ring test and ﬂocculation test are examples of
precipitation in solution.
Ring test: In this test, antigen solution is lay-
ered over antiserum in a test tube. Precipitation
between antigen and antibodies in antiserum solu-
tion is marked by the appearance of a ring of
precipitation at the junction of two liquid layers.
C-reactive
protein
(CRP)
and
streptococcal
grouping by the Lanceﬁeld methods are examples
of the ring test.
Flocculation test: Flocculation test may be
performed in a slide or tube. VDRL test for detec-
tion of reaginic antibodies in syphilis is an exam-
ple of a slide ﬂocculation test. In this test, a drop
of VDRL antigen suspension is added to a drop of
patients’ serum on a cavity slide, and the result is
recorded after shaking the slide on a VDRL
shaker. In a positive test, the ﬂoccules appear,
which can be demonstrated well under a micro-
scope. Kahn’s test for syphilis is an example of
the tube ﬂocculation test. The tube ﬂocculation
test for standardisation of toxins and toxoids is
another example.
Immunodiffusion (Precipitation in Gel)
The precipitation test in soft (1%) agar gel or
agarose gel is termed as the immunodiffusion
test. In this test, reactants are added to the gel,
and an antigen–antibody combination occurs
using diffusion. The diffusion rate is affected by
the size of the particles, temperature, gel viscos-
ity, amount of hydration and interactions between
the matrix and reactants. An agar concentration of
0.3–1.5% allows for diffusion of most reactants.
Agarose is often preferred to agar because agar
has a strong negative charge, while agarose has
almost none, so interactions between the gel and
reactants are minimised.
The advantages of immunodiffusion reactions
are that (1) in this test, the line of precipitation is
visible as a band, which can also be stained for
preservation; and (2) the test can be used to detect
identity, cross-reaction and non-identity between
different antigens in a reacting mixture.
Immunodiffusion
reactions
are
classiﬁed
based on the number of reactants diffusing and
direction of diffusion, as follows:
Single diffusion in one dimension: Single
diffusion in one dimension, as the name suggests,
is the single diffusion of antigen in agar in one
dimension. It is otherwise called the Oudin pro-
cedure because it was pioneered by Oudin, who
used gels for precipitation reactions for the ﬁrst
time. In this method, the antibody is incorporated
into agar gel in a test tube, and the antigen solu-
tion is poured over it. Over time, the antigen
diffuses downward towards the antibody in agar
gel, and a line of precipitation is formed. The
number of precipitate bands shows the number
of different antigens present in the antigen
solution.
Single diffusion in two dimensions: Single
diffusion in two dimensions is also called radial
immunodiffusion. In this method, antiserum
solution containing antibody is incorporated in
agar gel on a slide or Petri dish. The wells are
cut on the surface of the gel. The antigen is then
applied to a well-cut into the gel. When antibody
already present in the gel reacts with the antigen,
which diffuses out of the well, a precipitation ring
is formed around the wells. The diameter of the
ring is directly proportional to the concentration
of the antigen. Therefore, the greater the amount
of antigen in the well, the farther the ring will be
from the well.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
195
Radial immunodiffusion has been used quan-
titatively to estimate antibodies and antigens in
the serum. It is used to measure IgG, IgM, IgA
and complement components in the serum,
antibodies to inﬂuenza virus in sera, and serum
transferrin and α-fetoprotein. However, currently,
the test has recently been replaced by more sensi-
tive and automated methods, such as nephelome-
try and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs).
Double diffusion in one dimension: This
method is also called Oakley– Fulthorpe proce-
dure. In this method, the antibody is incorporated
in agar gel in a test tube, above which a layer of
plain agar is placed. The antigen is then layered
on top of this plain agar. Over time, the antigen
and antibody move towards each other through
the intervening layer of plain agar. In this zone of
plain agar, both antigen and antibody react to
form a band of precipitation at their optimum
concentration.
Double diffusion in two dimensions: This
method is also called the Ouchterlony proce-
dure. In this method, both the antigen and anti-
body diffuse independently through agar gel in
two dimensions, horizontally and vertically. The
test is performed by putting wells in the agar gel
poured on a glass slide or in a Petri dish. The
antiserum consisting of antibodies is placed in the
central well, and different antigens are added to
the wells surrounding the centre well. After an
incubation period of 12–48 h in a moist chamber,
the lines of precipitins are formed at the sites of a
combination of antigens and antibodies.
Three types of reactions can be demonstrated:
(1) line of precipitation at their junction forming
an arc represents serologic identity or the pres-
ence of a common epitope in antigens, (2) a pat-
tern of crossed lines demonstrates two separate
reactions
and
indicates
that
the
compared
antigens are unrelated and share no common
epitopes, and (3) fusion of two lines with a spur
indicates cross-reaction or partial identity. In this
last case, the two antigens share a common epi-
tope, but the antigen and traverse do not capture
some antibody molecules through the initial pre-
cipitin line to combine with additional epitopes
found in the more complex antigen.
Double diffusion in two dimensions has been
used for (1) demonstration of antibodies in
serodiagnosis of smallpox, (2) identiﬁcation of
fungal antigens and (3) detection of antibodies
to extractable nuclear antigens. Elek precipitation
test in the gel is a special test used for demonstra-
tion of toxigenicity of C. diphtheriae.
Precipitation in Agar with an Electric Field
(Electroimmunodiffusion)
The immunodiffusion methods described above
are too slow, and the results can only be obtained
after several hours. On the other hand, using an
electric current can cause quick movement of the
molecules resulting in much faster antigen–anti-
body precipitation, which is the underlying prin-
ciple for all electrodiffusion techniques described
below.
1. Immunoelectrophoresis: It is a process of
combination of immunodiffusion and electro-
phoresis. It is a method in which different
antigens in serum are separated according to
their charge under an electric ﬁeld. In this
method, a drop of antigen is placed into a
well in agar on a glass slide. An electric current
is then passed through the agar. According to
their charge and size, antigens move in the
electric ﬁeld during electrophoresis. Following
electrophoresis, a trough is cut into the agar
and is ﬁlled with the antibody and diffusion is
allowed to occur. As the antigen and antibody
diffuse towards each other, they form a series
of lines of precipitation. The main advantage
of
immunoelectrophoresis
is
that
several
antigens can be identiﬁed in serum. The
method detects normal and abnormal proteins
in human serum, such as myeloma proteins.
2. Counter-current
immunoelectrophoresis
(CIE): It depends on the movement of antigen
towards the anode and antibody towards the
cathode through the agar under an electric
ﬁeld. The test is performed on a glass slide
with agarose in which a pair of wells is
punched out. One well is ﬁlled with antigen
and the other with antibodies. Electric current
is then passed through the gel. The migration
of antigen and antibody is greatly facilitated

196
15
Antigen–Antibody Reactions
under an electric ﬁeld, and the line of precipi-
tation is made visible in 30–60 min.
The test has many uses. It is a rapid and highly
speciﬁc method for detecting antigens and
antibodies in the serum, cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) and other body ﬂuids in diagnosing
many infectious diseases, including bacterial,
viral, fungal and parasitic. It is commonly used
for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
α-fetoprotein, hydatid and amoebic antigens
in the serum and cryptococcal antigen in the
CSF.
3. Rocket electrophoresis: This technique is an
adaptation of radial immunodiffusion devel-
oped by Laurell. In this method, an antibody
is incorporated in the gel, and the antigen is
placed in wells cut in the gel. Electric current is
then passed through the gel, facilitating the
migration of antigen into the agar. This results
in forming a precipitin line that is conical in
shape, resembling a rocket. That is why it is
known as rocket electrophoresis. The rocket’s
height, measured from the well to the apex, is
directly proportional to the amount of antigen
in the sample. Rocket electrophoresis is used
mainly for quantitative estimation of antigen in
the serum.
4. Two-dimensional electrophoresis: This tech-
nique is a variant of rocket electrophoresis.
This is a double-diffusion technique used for
qualitative and quantitative analyses of sera for
a wide range of antigens. This test is a
two-stage
procedure.
In
the
ﬁrst
stage,
antigens in the solution are separated by elec-
trophoresis. Then, in the second stage, electro-
phoresis is carried out again but perpendicular
to
the
ﬁrst
stage
to
obtain
rocket-like
precipitation.
A small trough is ﬁrst cut in agar gel on a glass
plate and ﬁlled with the antigen solution in this
test. Electric current is then passed through the
gel, and the antigens migrate into the gel at a rate
proportional to their net electric charge. In the
second stage, after electrophoresis, the gel piece
containing the separated antigens is placed on a
second glass plate, and the agar containing anti-
body is poured around the gel piece. A second
electric potential is applied at right angles to the
ﬁrst direction of migration. The pre-separated
antigens then migrate into the gel containing
antibodies at a rate proportional to their net
charge and precipitate with antibodies in the gel,
forming precipitates.
This method is qualitative in that it identiﬁes
different antigens present in the serum solution
and quantitative in that it detects the amount of
different antigens present in the solution.
Agglutination Reaction
Agglutination is an antigen–antibody reaction in
which a particulate antigen combines with its
antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a
speciﬁed temperature and pH, resulting in the
formation of visible clumping of particles. Agglu-
tination occurs optimally when antigens and
antibodies react in equivalent proportions. In
agglutination reactions, serial dilutions of the
antibody solution are made, and a constant
amount of particulate antigen is added to serially
diluted antibody solutions. After several hours of
incubation at 37 C, clumping is recorded by
visual inspection. The titre of the antiserum is
recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution
that causes clumping. Since the cells have many
antigenic determinants on their surface, the phe-
nomenon
of
antibody
excess
is
rarely
encountered.
Occasionally, antibodies are formed that react
with a cell’s antigenic determinants but do not
cause any agglutination. They inhibit the aggluti-
nation by the complete antibodies added subse-
quently. Such antibodies are called blocking
antibodies. Anti-Rh antibodies and anti-brucella
antibodies are a few examples of such blocking
antibodies. Agglutination reactions have various
applications in detecting antigens and antibodies
in serum and other body ﬂuids. They are very
sensitive, and the test result can be read visually
with ease.
Agglutination reactions are mostly similar to
precipitation reactions in their fundamentals and
share similar features. This reaction is analogous
to the precipitation reaction in that antibodies act

Direct Coombs test: In this test, the
sensitisation of red blood cells (RBCs)
as a bridge to form a lattice network of antibodies
and the cells that carry the antigen on their sur-
face. Because cells are so much larger than a
soluble antigen, the result is more visible when
the cells aggregate into clumps.
Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
197
Agglutination differs from precipitation reac-
tion in that since the former reaction takes place at
the surface of the particle involved, the antigen
must be exposed and bind with the antibody to
produce visible clumps.
Types of Agglutination Reactions
Agglutination reactions are broadly of two types:
direct agglutination and passive agglutination.
The agglutination reactions that employ the
antigens found naturally on a particle are known
as direct agglutination. This is different from pas-
sive
agglutination,
which
employs
particles
coated with antigens not normally found on their
surfaces.
Direct Agglutination
Direct agglutination reactions can broadly be of
the following types.
Slide agglutination test: It is a basic aggluti-
nation reaction performed on a slide. Identiﬁca-
tion of bacterial types represents a classic
example of a direct slide agglutination that is
still used today. In this test, a suspension of bac-
teria is prepared and is added to a drop of
standardised antiserum. A positive reaction is
indicated by the clumping of bacteria and clearing
of the background solution. Clumping occurs
instantly or within seconds in a positive test. A
control consisting of antigen suspension in saline
without adding antiserum is included on the same
slide. It is used to validate the results and detect
possible false-positives due to autoagglutination
of the antigen.
Slide agglutination is used as a routine proce-
dure (1) to identify bacterial strains, such as Sal-
monella, Shigella, Vibrio, etc., isolated from
clinical specimens; and (2) for blood grouping
and cross-matching.
Tube agglutination test: Tube agglutination
test, as the name suggests, is performed in glass
tubes. Typically, in these tests, the patient’s
serum is diluted in a series of tubes and bacterial
antigens speciﬁc for the suspected disease are
added to it. Antigen and antibody reactions are
demonstrated by demonstrating visible clumps of
agglutination. It is a standard method used for
quantitative estimation of antibodies in the
serum. Tube agglutination tests are routinely
used for demonstration of antibodies in the
serum for serodiagnosis of enteric fever and bru-
cellosis, such as:
Heterophile agglutination test: This test
depends on the demonstration of heterophilic
antibodies in serum present in certain bacterial
infections:
1. Weil–Felix test is an example of heterophile
agglutination reaction for serodiagnosis of
rickettsial
infections.
In
this
test,
the
cross-reacting antibodies produced against
the rickettsial pathogen are detected using
cross-reacting related antigens (e.g. Proteus
strains OXK, OX19 and OX2). Although the
antibodies are produced against rickettsial
organisms, they cross-react with antigens of
Proteus strains OXK, OX19 and OX2. Paul–
Bunnell test is another heterophile agglutina-
tion test used to detect antibodies in infectious
mononucleosis by using sheep erythrocytes as
antigens.
Finally,
the
Streptococcus
MG
agglutination test is a similar test used to
detect antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae
causing primary atypical pneumonia.
2. Antiglobulin (Coombs) test: The Coombs
test
was
originally
devised
by
Coombs,
Mourant and Race to detect incomplete anti-
Rh
antibodies
that
do
not
agglutinate
Rh + erythrocytes in saline. When serum-
containing incomplete anti-Rh antibodies are
mixed with Rh + erythrocytes in saline, incom-
plete antibody antiglobulin coats the surface of
erythrocytes but does not cause any agglutina-
tion. When such erythrocytes are treated with
antiglobulin or Coombs serum (rabbit antise-
rum against human seven globulin), then the
cells are agglutinated.
Coombs test is of two types: (a) direct Coombs
test and (b) indirect Coombs test.
(a)

with
incomplete
antibodies
occurs
in vivo. The cell-bound antibodies can
be detected by this test in which antise-
rum against human immunoglobulin is
used to agglutinate a patient’s red blood
cells.
Latex particles are inexpensive, relatively sta-
ble and do no cross-reactivity with other
antibodies. Therefore, these particles can be
coated with antibodies to detect the antigen in
the serum and other body ﬂuids. The use of
monoclonal
antibodies
has
reduced
the

Indirect Coombs test: In this test,
RBCs’
sensitisation
with
incomplete
antibodies occurs in vitro. In this test,
the patient’s serum is mixed with normal
red blood cells and antiserum to human
immunoglobulin is added. Agglutination
occurs if antibodies are present in the
patient’s serum (Fig. 15.3).
Coombs tests are used to detect anti-Rh
antibodies and incomplete antibodies in brucello-
sis and other diseases.
Passive Agglutination
Passive agglutination employs carrier particles
that are coated with soluble antigens. This is
usually done to convert precipitation reactions
into agglutination reactions since the latter are
easier to perform and interpret and are more sen-
sitive
than
precipitation
reactions
to
detect
antibodies. When the antibody instead of antigens
is adsorbed on the carrier particle for detection of
antigens,
it
is
called
reverse
passive
agglutination.
Until the 1970s, erythrocytes were the major
carrier particles used to coat antigens. Recently,
however, a variety of other particles, including
polystyrene latex, bentonite and charcoal, have
been used for this purpose. Particle size varies
from 7 μ for RBCs to 0.05 μ for very ﬁne latex
particles. The use of synthetic beads or particles
provides the advantage of consistency, uniformity
and stability. Reactions are also easy to read
visually. The passive agglutination reaction can
be of the following types depending on the carrier
particles used.
1. Latex agglutination test: It is a test that
employs latex particles as a carrier of antigen
or antibodies. In 1955, Singer and Plotz acci-
dentally found that IgG was naturally adsorbed
to the surface of polystyrene latex particles.

cross-reactions resulting in a reduction of
false-positive
reactions.
Additionally,
the
large particle size of the latex facilitates better
visualisation of antigen–antibody reactions by
the naked eye observation. The tests are usu-
ally performed on cardboard cards or glass
slides, and positive reactions are graded on a
Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
199
scale of 1+ to 4 + .
The latex agglutination tests are used to rap-
idly identify antigens of group B Streptococ-
cus,
Staphylococcus
aureus,
Neisseria
meningitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans etc.
The tests have also been useful for detecting
soluble microbial antigens in urine, spinal ﬂuid
and serum to diagnose various infectious
diseases. These tests are being used to detect
RA factor, anti-streptolysin O (ASLO), CRP
etc., in serum specimens.
2. Haemagglutination test: RBCs are used as
carrier particles in haemagglutination tests.
RBCs of sheep, humans, chicks etc. are com-
monly used in the test. When RBCs are coated
with antigen to detect antibodies in the serum,
the test is called the indirect haemagglu-
tination (IHA) test. The IHA is the most
commonly used test for serodiagnosis of
many parasitic diseases, including amoebiasis,
hydatid disease and toxoplasmosis.
When antibodies are attached to the RBCs to
detect microbial antigens, it is known as
reverse
passive
haemagglutination
(RPHA). The RPHA has been used exten-
sively in the past to detect viral antigens,
such as in HBsAg in the serum for diagnosis
of hepatitis B infection. The test has also been
used to detect antigens in many other viral and
parasitic infections.
(a)
Viral haemagglutination: Many viruses,
including inﬂuenza, mumps and measles,
can agglutinate RBCs without antigen–
antibody reactions. This process is called
viral
haemagglutination.
This
haemagglutination can be inhibited by
an antibody speciﬁcally directed against
the virus, and this phenomenon is called
haemagglutination
inhibition.
This
forms
the
basis
of
the
viral
haemagglutination inhibition test, which
detects antibodies in patients’ sera that
neutralise the agglutinating viruses. The
patient’s serum is ﬁrst incubated with a
viral preparation to perform this test.
Then the RBCs that the virus is known
to agglutinate are added to the mixture. If
the antibody is present, this will combine
with viral particles and prevent agglutina-
tion, and a lack of or reduction in aggluti-
nation indicates the presence of antibody
in the patient’s serum.
3. Coagglutination test: Coagglutination is a
type
of
agglutination
reaction
in
which
Cowan I strain of S. aureus is used as a carrier
particle to coat antibodies. Cowan I strain of
S. aureus contains protein A, an anti-antibody,
that combines with the Fc portion of immuno-
globulin, IgG, leaving the Fab region free to
react with the antigen present in the specimens
(Fig. 15.4). In a positive test, protein A bearing
S. aureus coated with antibodies will be
agglutinated if mixed with a speciﬁc antigen.
The advantage of the test is that these particles

are more refractory to changes in ionic
strength.
Coagglutination
test
has
been
used
for
(1) detection of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF
for
diagnosis
of
cryptococcal
meningitis;
(2) detection of amoebic and hydatid antigens in
the serum for diagnosis of amoebiasis and cystic
echinococcosis, respectively; and (3) grouping of
streptococci and mycobacteria and for typing of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Complement-Dependent Serological
Tests
A complement system is a group of serum
proteins present in normal serum. The system
consists of 20 or more serum proteins interacting
with each other and cell membranes. It is a bio-
chemical cascade that helps to clear pathogens
from the body. It aids the antibodies in lysing
bacteria and promotes phagocytosis and immune
adherence. The complement-dependent serologi-
cal tests may be of the following types.
Complement Fixation Test (CFT)
The principle of the complement ﬁxation test is
that when antigen and antibodies of the IgM or
the IgG classes are mixed, complement is “ﬁxed”
to the antigen–antibody complex. If this occurs
on the surface of RBCs, the complement cascade
will be activated, and haemolysis will occur. The
complement ﬁxation test consists of two antigen–
antibody complement systems: (i) an indicator
system, and (ii) a test system.
1. Indicator system: It consists of RBCs that
have been preincubated with a speciﬁc anti-
RBC antibody, in concentrations that do not
cause agglutination, and no haemolysis of
RBCs occurs in the absence of complement.
Such RBCs are designated as “sensitised” red
cells.
2. Test system: In the test system, the patient’s
serum is ﬁrst heated to 56 C to inactivate the
native complement. The inactivated serum is
washed to avoid cross-reactivity because these
anti-RBC antibodies may interfere with the
assay. The puriﬁed serum is then mixed with
the serum and diluted with fresh pig serum,
which is a complement. Then the mixture is
incubated for 30 min at 37
C to allow
antibody–antigen
to
form
complexes
(Fig. 15.5).
In the complement ﬁxation test, “sensitised”
red cells are added to the mixture. If the red cells
are
lysed,
it
indicates
that
there
were
no
antibodies speciﬁc to the antigen in the patient’s
serum. The complement, therefore, was not con-
sumed in the test system and was available to be
used by the anti-RBC antibodies, resulting in
haemolysis. This reaction is considered negative.
Conversely, the test is considered positive if the
red cells are not lysed. This is because no lysis of
the cells indicates that the patient’s serum had
antibodies speciﬁc to the antigen, which have a
“ﬁxed” complement. Hence, no complement was
available to be activated by the indicator system.
The complement ﬁxation reactions were used
earlier to diagnose many infections, such as
(1) Wassermann test for syphilis, and (2) tests
for
demonstration
of
antibodies
to
M. pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, many dif-
ferent viruses and to fungi (such as Cryptococcus
spp., Histoplasma and Coccidioides immitis).
However, since this test is technically very cum-
bersome and often difﬁcult, it is no longer used
nowadays.
Types of Complement Fixation Test
1. Indirect complement ﬁxation test: This test
is carried out to test the sera that cannot ﬁx
guinea pig complement. These include avian
sera (e.g. parrot, duck) and mammalian sera
(e.g. cat, horse). The test is carried out in
duplicate, and after the ﬁrst test, the standard
antiserum known to ﬁx the complement is
added to one set. Haemolysis indicates a posi-
tive test. If the serum contains an antibody in a
positive test, the antigen would have been used
up in the ﬁrst test. Standard antiserum added
subsequently would fail to ﬁx the complement,
therefore causing haemolysis.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
201
Fig. 15.5 Complement
ﬁxation test
2. Conglutinating
complement
adsorption
test: It is an alternative method for systems
that do not ﬁx guinea pig complement. Sheep
erythrocytes, sensitised with bovine serum, are
used as the indicator system. The bovine
serum contains conglutinin, a β-globulin that
acts as an antibody to the complement. There-
fore,
conglutinin
causes
agglutination
of
sensitised sheep erythrocytes if combined
with complement, known as conglutination.
If the horse complement had been used up by
the antigen–antibody reaction in the ﬁrst step,
the agglutination of the sensitised cells does
not occur.
3. Immune adherence test: Immune adherence
test is a test in which certain pathogens
(e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Treponema pallidum)
react with speciﬁc antibodies in the presence
of complement and adhere to erythrocytes or
platelets. The adherence of cells to bacteria is
known as immune adherence. This facilitates
phagocytosis of the bacteria.
4. Immobilisation test: The immobilisation test
is a complement-dependent test in which
certain live bacteria, such as T. pallidum, are
immobilised when mixed with the patient’s
serum in the presence of complement. This
forms
the
basis
of
the
T.
pallidum
immobilisation test. A positive test shows
serum to contain treponemal antibodies.
5. Cytolytic or cytocidal reactions: When a live
bacterium, such as V. cholerae, is mixed with
its speciﬁc antibody in the presence of com-
plement, the bacterium is killed and lysed.
This forms the basis of the test used to measure
anti-cholera antibodies in the serum.
Neutralisation Tests
Neutralisation is an antigen–antibody reaction in
which the biological effects of viruses and toxins
are neutralised by homologous antibodies known
as neutralising antibodies. These tests are broadly
of two types: virus neutralisation and toxin
neutralisation.

202
15
Antigen–Antibody Reactions
Virus Neutralisation Tests
In
virus
neutralisation
tests,
viruses
are
neutralised by their speciﬁc antibodies. Inocula-
tion of viruses in cell cultures, eggs and animals
results in the replication and growth of viruses.
Growth of viruses is inhibited on injecting virus-
speciﬁc
neutralising
antibodies
into
these
systems. This forms the basis of the virus
neutralisation test.
The viral haemagglutination inhibition test
is an example of a virus neutralisation test fre-
quently used to diagnose viral infections, such as
inﬂuenza, mumps and measles. If a patient’s serum
contains antibodies against certain viruses that
have the property of agglutinating the red blood
cells, these antibodies react with the viruses and
inhibit the agglutination of the red blood cells.
Toxin Neutralisation Tests
Toxin neutralisation tests are based on the princi-
ple
that
the
biological
action
of
toxin
is
neutralised by reacting with speciﬁc neutralising
antibodies
called
antitoxins.
Examples
of
neutralisation tests include:
Schick test, an in-vivo test, is used to demon-
strate immunity or susceptibility against diphtheria.
This test depends on the ability of circulating anti-
toxin to neutralize diphtheria toxin administered
intradermally.
Anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) test, an in-vitro
test, is used to detect the ASLO antibody in
patients with past Group A streptococci infection.
Raised or rising levels of ASLO antibodies indi-
cate past or present infection, and Nagler reaction
is used for rapid detection of C. welchii. This test
is used to detect alpha-toxin of Clostridium
perfringens in clinical specimens.
Immunofluorescence
The property of certain dyes absorbing light
rays at one particular wavelength (ultraviolet
[UV] light) and emitting them at a different
wavelength (visible light) is known as ﬂuores-
cence. Fluorescent dyes, such as ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate and lissamine rhodamine, can be
tagged with antibody molecules. They emit blue-
green and orange-red ﬂuorescence, respectively,
under the ﬂuorescence microscope’s ultraviolet
(UV) rays. This forms the basis of the immuno-
logical
test.
Immunoﬂuorescence
tests
have
wide applications in research and diagnostics.
These tests are broadly of two types: (1) direct
immunoﬂuorescence
test
and
(2)
indirect
immunoﬂuorescence test.
Direct Immunofluorescence Test
A direct immunoﬂuorescence test is used to detect
the unknown antigen in a cell or tissue by
employing
a
known
labelled
antibody
that
interacts directly with the unknown antigen. If
the antigen is present, it reacts with labelled
antibodies, and the antibody-coated antigen is
observed under the UV light of the ﬂuorescence
microscope (Fig. 15.6).
Direct immunoﬂuorescence test is widely used
to detect bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi or other
antigens in CSF, blood, stool, urine, tissues and
other specimens. The test is used for antemortem
diagnosis of rabies by detecting rabies virus anti-
gen in the skin smear collected from the nape of
the neck in humans and the saliva of dogs. The
test is also used to detect N. gonorrhoea,
C. diphtheriae, T. pallidum etc., directly in appro-
priate clinical specimens.
The
need
to
prepare
separately
labelled
antibodies for each pathogen is the principal dis-
advantage of the direct immunoﬂuorescence test.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Test
The test detects speciﬁc antibodies in the serum
and other body ﬂuids for the serodiagnosis of
many infectious diseases.
Indirect immunoﬂuorescence is a two-stage
process. In the ﬁrst stage, a known antigen is
ﬁxed on a slide. Then the patient’s serum to be
tested is applied to the slide, followed by careful
washing.
If
the
patient’s
serum
contains
antibodies against the antigen, it will combine
with the antigen on the slide. In the second
stage, the combination of antibody with antigen

can
be
detected
by
adding
a
ﬂuorescent
dye-labelled antibody to human IgG, which is
examined by a ﬂuorescence microscope.
Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
203
Fig. 15.6 Direct
ﬂuorescent antibody test
The ﬁrst step in the indirect immunoﬂuores-
cence test is incubating a ﬁxed antigen (e.g. in a
cell or tissue) with an unlabelled antibody, which
becomes associated with the antigen. Next, after
careful
washing,
a
ﬂuorescent
antibody
(e.g. ﬂuorescently labelled anti-IgG) is added to
the smear. This second antibody will become
associated with the ﬁrst, and the antigen–antibody
complex can be visualised on the ﬂuorescence
microscope.
The indirect method has the advantage of
using a single labelled antiglobulin (antibody to
IgG) as a “universal reagent” to detect many
different
speciﬁc
antigen–antibody
reactions.
The test is often more sensitive than the direct
immunoﬂuorescence test.
Indirect
immunoﬂuorescence
test
is
used
widely to (1) detect speciﬁc antibodies for
serodiagnosis
of
syphilis,
leptospirosis,
amoebiasis, toxoplasmosis and many other infec-
tious diseases; (2) identify the class of a given
antibody by using ﬂuorescent antibodies speciﬁc
for different immunoglobulin isotypes; (3) iden-
tify and enumerate lymphocyte subpopulations
by
employing
monoclonal
antibodies
and
cytoﬂuorographs; and (4) detect autoantibodies,
such as antinuclear antibodies in autoimmune
diseases.
The major limitation of immunoﬂuorescence
is that the technique requires (1) expensive ﬂuo-
rescence microscope and reagents, (2) trained
personnel and (3) has a factor of subjectivity
that may result in erroneous results.

204

Antigen–Antibody Reactions
Enzyme Immunoassays
Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can be used to
detect antigens or antibodies in the patient’s
serum and other body ﬂuids. In EIA techniques,
antigen or antibody labelled with enzymes is
used. Alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxi-
dase and galactosidase are the enzymes used in
the EIA tests.
The commonly used EIAs are enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The ELISA
technique was ﬁrst conceptualised and developed
by Peter Perlmann and Eva Engvall at Stockholm
University, Sweden.
These assays involve using an immunosorbent
speciﬁc to either the antigen or antibody. Follow-
ing the antigen–antibody reaction, chromogenic
substrate
speciﬁc
to
the
enzyme
(o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride for peroxi-
dase, p-nitrophenyl phosphate for alkaline phos-
phatase etc.) is added. The reaction is detected by
reading the optical density. Usually, a standard
curve based on known concentrations of antigen
or antibody is prepared from which the unknown
quantities are calculated. Different types of
ELISAs are available to detect and quantify either
the antigen or antibodies in serum and other
body ﬂuids. These include indirect ELISA,
sandwich
ELISA,
competitive
ELISA
and
ELISPOT (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot)
assay.
Fig. 15.7 Indirect ELISA test
Indirect ELISA
The indirect ELISA is used to estimate antibodies
in the serum and other body ﬂuids quantitatively.
In this method, specimens are added to microtiter
plate wells coated with antigens to which speciﬁc
antibodies are to be detected. After a period of
incubation, the wells are washed. If antibody was
present in the sample, antigen–antibody complex
would have been formed and will not get washed
away. On the other hand, if the speciﬁc antibody
were not present in the specimen, there would be
no complex formation. Next, an anti-isotype anti-
body conjugated with an enzyme is added and
incubated. After another washing step, a substrate
for the enzyme is added. If there were complex
formation in the initial step, the secondary
anti-isotype antibody would have bound to the
primary antibody, and there would be a chromo-
genic reaction between the enzyme and substrate.
By measuring the optical density values of the
wells, after a stop solution has been added to
arrest the chromogenic reaction, one can deter-
mine the amount of antigen–antibody complex
formed in the ﬁrst step (Fig. 15.7).

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
205
The test is extensively used to determine
serum antibodies for diagnosing human immuno-
deﬁciency
virus
(HIV)
infection,
Japanese
encephalitis, dengue and other viral infections.
Sandwich ELISA
The sandwich ELISA is used for the detection of
antigen. In this test, the known antibody is coated
and immobilised onto the wells of microtiter
plates. The test sample containing the suspected
antigen is added to the wells and is allowed to
react with the antibodies in the wells. After wash-
ing the well, a second enzyme-conjugated anti-
body speciﬁc for a different epitope of the antigen
is added and allowed to incubate. After removing
any free secondary antibody by rewashing, the
speciﬁc substrate is added, and the ensuing chro-
mogenic reaction is measured. The chromogenic
reaction is then compared with a standard curve to
determine the exact amount of the antigen present
in the test sample. In a positive test, an enzyme
acts on the substrate to produce a colour, and its
intensity can be measured by a spectrophotometer
or ELISA reader. The change in colour can also
be observed by the naked eye.
The sandwich ELISA detects rotavirus and
enterotoxin of Escherichia coli in faeces.
Competitive ELISA
Competitive ELISA is another technique used to
estimate antibodies present in a specimen, such as
serum. The principle of the test is that two speciﬁc
antibodies, one conjugated with enzyme and the
other present in test serum (if the serum is positive
for antibodies), are used. Competition occurs
between the two antibodies for the same antigen.
The appearance of colour indicates a negative test
(absence of antibodies), while the absence of
colour indicates a positive test (presence of
antibodies).
In this test, the microtiter wells are coated with
HIV antigens. The sera to be tested are added to
these wells and incubated at 37 C, and then
washed. If antibodies are present in the test
serum, an antigen–antibody reaction occurs. The
antigen–antibody reaction is detected by adding
enzyme-labelled-speciﬁc HIV antibodies. In a
positive test, no antigen is left for these antibodies
to act. Hence, the antibodies remain free and are
washed away during washing. When the substrate
is added, no enzyme is available to act on
it. Therefore, a positive result indicates no colour
reaction. In a negative test, in which no antibodies
are present in the serum, antigen in the coated
wells is available to combine with enzyme-
conjugated antibodies, and the enzyme acts on
the substrate to produce colour.
Competitive ELISA is the most commonly
used test for detecting HIV antibodies in serum
in patients with HIV.
Capture ELISA
This works on ELISA principles, and these
methods are much simpler, rapid and reliable in
the diagnostic scenario. For example, card and
dipstick methods are widely used to diagnose
various infectious diseases nowadays. Because
of its rapid and reliable nature, capturing ELISA
is very useful in the initial diagnosis and early
treatment of many diseases.
Cassette ELISA (Cylinder ELISA)
Cassette ELISA is a simple modiﬁcation of the
conventional ELISA technique; it is one of the
highly useful diagnostic methods, and even a very
few samples can be processed. The whole test
procedure ﬁnishes within 10–20 min. Each sam-
ple can be processed individually, as cassette
ELISA test units are packed separately in a dis-
posable pouch. There is no need to use any
instruments to carry out the assay procedure,
and the assay results can be read through naked
eyes. Another advantage of this test is that the test
unit includes in-built control, which helps in
instant validation of the assay. The HIV tri-dot
test used to detect HIV type 1 and 2 antibodies is
an example of cassette ELISA. In this test, spe-
ciﬁc HIV type 1 and 2 antibodies are immobilised
on the nitrocellulose membrane at two different
ﬁxed spots along with another spot for the
control.
ELISPOT Assay
ELISPOT assay is a modiﬁcation of ELISA. It
allows the quantitative determination of the num-
ber of cells in a population producing antibodies

speciﬁc for a given antigen or an antigen for
which one has a speciﬁc antibody. These tests
have found application widely in the measure-
ment of cytokines.
206

Antigen–Antibody Reactions
Applications of ELISA
ELISA is extensively used in the diagnosis of a
wide
variety
of
infectious
as
well
as
non-infectious
diseases.
These
are
widely
employed to diagnose HIV, hepatitis virus, rota-
virus, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella, etc. A few
examples of such uses are as follows:
1. Detection of viral infections such as HIV, Jap-
anese
encephalitis,
dengue,
hepatitis,
inﬂuenza.
2. Detection of rotavirus, Entamoeba histolytica,
Giardia intestinalis, Taenia, etc. in stool
samples.
3. Detection of bacterial infections including
tuberculosis, syphilis, enteric fever, H. pylori
infections, etc.
4. Detection of parasitic infections like neurocys-
ticercosis, amoebiasis, lymphatic ﬁlariasis, etc.
5. Detection of E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmo-
nella, etc. in food and food products.
Radioimmunoassay
When radioisotopes instead of enzymes are used
as labels to be conjugated with antigens or
antibodies, the technique of detection of the
antigen–antibody complex is called radioimmu-
noassay (RIA). In 1960, Rosalyn Yalow and Sol-
omon Berson of the Veterans Administration
Hospital in New York described RIA for the
ﬁrst time. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in
1977 for their work on developing RIA for pep-
tide hormones.
The classical RIA methods are based on the
principle of competitive binding. Labelled and
unlabelled antigens compete to bind with the
antibody
when
radiolabelled
and
unlabelled
antigens
are
incubated
together
with
the
corresponding
antibody.
The
quantity
of
unlabelled antigen is directly proportional to the
amount of radiolabelled antigen, which is not
bound.
In the ﬁrst step, mixtures of ﬁxed amounts of
labelled antigen, a variable amount of cold anti-
gen and samples with unknown concentrations
are prepared—following which similar amounts
of antibodies are added to the mixtures. Second
antibody or reagents that promote precipitation of
antigen–antibody complexes are added to precip-
itate
out
antigen–antibody
complexes.
The
amount of radiolabelled antigen precipitated
with the antibody is determined by counting
radioactivity.
Finally,
a
standard
curve
is
constructed
by
plotting
the
percentage
of
antibody-bound
radiolabelled
antigen
against
known
concentrations
of
a
standardised
unlabelled antigen. The antigen concentrations
in patient samples are extrapolated from that
curve. The major advantage of RIA is its
extremely high sensitivity.
Applications of RIA
The test can be used to determine very small
quantities
(e.g.
nanogram)
of
antigens
and
antibodies in the serum. The test is used to quan-
tify hormones, drugs, HBsAg and other viral
antigens. The main drawbacks of the RIA include
(1) the cost of equipment and reagents, (2) the
short shelf-life of radiolabelled compounds and
(3) the problems associated with the disposal of
radioactive waste.
Western Blot Techniques
Western blotting is called so because the proce-
dure is similar to Southern blotting, which Edwin
Southern developed to detect deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA). However, while Southern blotting
is done to detect DNA, Western blotting is done
to detect proteins.
Western blotting is usually done on a tissue
homogenate or extract. It uses sodium dodecyl
sulphate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), a type of gel electrophoresis, to
ﬁrst separate various proteins in a mixture based
on their shape and size. The protein bands thus
obtained
are
transferred
or
blotted
onto
a

nitrocellulose or nylon membrane where they are
“probed” with antibodies speciﬁc to the protein to
be detected. The antigen–antibody complexes
that form on the band containing the protein
recognised by the antibody can be visualised in
various ways, including enzyme immunoassays
or
radioimmunoassays.
The
enzyme-linked
antibodies against the protein are generally used
detection
procedures.
After
binding
of
the
enzyme–antibody conjugate, the addition of sub-
strate, which will produce coloured and insoluble
products, causes the appearance of a coloured
band at the site of the target antigen.
Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
207
Fig. 15.8 Western blot test
The higher sensitivity can be improved to
determine the site of protein interest if a chemilu-
minescent compound and suitable enhancing
agents are used to produce light at the antigen
site (Fig. 15.8).
Applications of Western Blot
Western blot identiﬁes a speciﬁc protein in a
complex mixture of proteins. In this method, anti-
gen with known molecular weight can be
separated by SDS-PAGE. Then the same can be
blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The sam-
ple suspected to contain antibodies is used to
probe any speciﬁc antigens. Antibody–antigen
reaction is detected using an enzyme-linked sec-
ondary antibody speciﬁc to the test species or a
radiolabelled antibody. It is also used to estimate
the size of the protein and the amount of protein
present in the mixture.
The Western blot test is most widely used as a
conﬁrmatory test for the diagnosis of HIV, where
this procedure is used to determine whether the
patient has antibodies that react with one or more
viral proteins or not. Western blotting is also used
to demonstrate speciﬁc antibodies in the serum to
diagnose
neurocysticercosis
and
tubercular
meningitis.
Immunochromatographic Tests (ICTs)
ICT is a qualitative, single-step test technique
used to diagnose various infections. One of the

most frequently used rapid diagnostic tests is
identifying serum antigens or antibodies of infec-
tious agents such as the hepatitis B virus. The
ICTs are also commonly used for the rapid diag-
nosis of parasitic diseases such as malaria and
diarrhoea caused by coccidian parasites. These
methods are simple, economical, quick and reli-
able. The procedure is also employed to detect
antigens of many pathogens in serum and other
body ﬂuids.
208
15
Antigen–Antibody Reactions
ICT for HbsAg is a rectangular column with a
centrally situated membrane impregnated with
anti-HBsAg antibody and colloidal gold dye con-
jugate. This device contains three windows. The
ﬁrst window is used for patient serum loading.
Soon after that, serum starts moving upstream
towards the other two windows by capillary
action. The second window is the test site where
colloidal
gold
conjugate
and
anti-HBsAg
antibodies are ﬁxed, forming a complex with a
serum sample containing HBsAg and producing
red coloured bands. The test site will not react to
normal serum without any HBsAg. Finally, the
third window is an in-built control, and it should
be positive for all the samples. If the third window
bands are not visible, the test should be consid-
ered invalid, and serum should be retested with
fresh ICT.
Chemiluminescence Assay
The chemiluminescence assay uses chemilumi-
nescent compounds that emit energy in the form
of light during the antigen–antibody reactions.
The emitted lights are measured, and the concen-
tration of the analyte is calculated. The assay is a
fully automated method used for drug sensitivity
testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Immunohistochemical Technique
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunohisto-
chemical technique is the process of detecting
surface or intracellular antigens in cells of a tissue
section based on the principle of ﬂuorescent-
tagged
antibodies
that
bind
speciﬁcally
to
antigens in biological tissues. This method helps
to visualise antigen–antibody reactions in situ.
Immunohistochemistry is widely used to diag-
nose abnormal cell populations in cancerous
tumours. Commonly used ﬂuorescent dyes are
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin and
rhodamine.
Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry is a laser-based ﬂuorescence
technique employed for identifying, counting
and sorting cells bearing particular antigens or
the markers on their surface. In this method,
cells stained with ﬂuorescence dye-tagged-mono-
clonal antibody are suspended in a stream of ﬂuid
and allowed to pass through lasers and electronic
detection systems for their qualitative and quanti-
tative analyses.
Flow
cytometry
allows
simultaneous
multiparametric analysis of the physical and
chemical characteristics of up to thousands of
particles per second. Determination of different
molecules on the cell surface (antigenic markers)
and differentiation of cell size and shape can be
done by using forward and side scattering options
available in the ﬂow cytometry machine settings.
Flow cytometry is routinely used in the diag-
nosis of health disorders. It is used to count blood
cells,
including
differential
leukocyte
count
(DLC), for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of
leukaemia and lymphomas; to count and sort
T-cell subsets (CD4 and CD8 counts in HIV
patients); to study the cell cycle and programmed
cell death (apoptosis); etc. It has many other
applications in basic research clinical trials.
Turbidimetry and Nephelometry
Turbidimetry and nephelometry are the two
methods used to detect and quantitate precipita-
tion reactions in serum and are based on the
phenomenon of light scattering by precipitates
in a solution.
Turbidimetry is a measurement of turbidity or
cloudiness of precipitate in a solution.

Antigen–Antibody Reactions Used in the Laboratory
209
Nephelometry is an improvement on this tech-
nique because it measures the light scattered at a
particular angle from the incident beam as it
passes through a suspension containing the
antigen–antibody precipitate. The amount of
light scattered is an index of the concentration of
the solution. Beginning with a constant amount of
antibodies, an increasing amount of antigen
would
increase
antigen–antibody
complexes.
Thus,
the
relationship
between
antigen
concentrations, as indicated by the antigen–anti-
body complex formation, and light scattering
approaches linearity. The exact values of the anti-
gen or antibody in the serum can be estimated
using a computer through this system. Laser
beams have been used as the source of incident
light to improve the sensitivity of this system.
Nephelometry is now becoming the method of
choice for use in various laboratories to measure
plasma proteins, including IgG, IgM and IgA,
complement components, RA (rheumatoid arthri-
tis) factor, and ASLO (anti-streptolysin O).
Immunoelectron Microscopic Assays
Immunoelectron microscopy, ﬁrst developed in
1941,
is
a
method
for
visualising
and
characterising
antigen–antibody
reactions
in
tissues and cell cultures and identifying viruses
in tissues or cultured cells. Gold is the most
preferred probe since it is available in various
sizes from 5 to 150 nm and is highly electron
opaque. Normally, transmission electron micros-
copy is used in this technique. The antigen–anti-
body complex can be seen using colloidal gold of
known diameter conjugated to the antibody mol-
ecule. The immunoferritin technique is an older
method where electron-dense ferritin molecules
are conjugated to the immunoglobulin and used
as a probe. Gold-labelled enzymes as probes have
also been used to localise biomolecules like
nucleic acids.

Immune Response
16
The speciﬁc reactivity induced by an antigenic
stimulus in a host is known as an immune
response. The immune system is developed in a
host primarily to protect the host from the harmful
effects of invading pathogens or infectious
organisms
by
stimulating
various
immune
responses. The host immunological system can
recognise foreign substances, and the immune
response
that
follows
is
associated
with
macrophages and B-cells or T-cells. There are
two main sites where pathogens may reside in
an infected host—extracellularly in tissue spaces
or intracellularly within a host cell; the immune
system has different ways of dealing with
pathogens at these sites.
Types of Immunity
An encounter with a microbial or viral agent
usually elicits a complex variety of responses.
The immune response can be antibody-mediated
(humoral),
cell-mediated
(cellular)
or
both.
Humoral immunity acts mainly against extracel-
lular pathogens, whereas cell-mediated immunity
(CMI)
acts
against
intracellular
pathogens
(Table 16.1).

Humoral Immunity
(Antibody-Mediated Immunity)
Humoral immunity is mediated by soluble host
proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. It
is
based
on
the
action
of
antibodies
and
complements. It provides the ﬁrst line of defence
against
a
wide
range
of
invading
foreign
substances.
It
is
directed
primarily
against
(1) extracellular bacteria, in particular exotoxin-
producing bacteria, such as Corynebacterium
diphtheriae, Clostridium tetani etc., (2) bacteria
whose virulence is due to polysaccharide capsules
(e.g.
Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae,
Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and
(3) certain viruses that cause infection through
the respiratory or intestinal tract. It helps to pre-
vent recurrence of viral infections. The humoral
immunity also participates in the pathogenesis of
hypersensitivity reactions (types I, II and III) and
certain autoimmune diseases.
Production of Antibodies
It is the main feature of humoral immune
responses. The antibody production involves
three steps: (1) the afferent limb that consists of
the antigen entry, its location and outcome in the
tissues along with its contact with suitable immune

cells; (2) the central function that involves antigen
processing and control of antibody production; and
(3) the efferent limb that consists of antibody
secretion, its distribution in tissues, blood and
other body ﬂuids and its manifestations in combat-
ing antigen of a pathogen.

The production of antibodies follows a charac-
teristic pattern as follows:
1. Lag phase: This is the immediate phase fol-
lowing exposure to antigen. During this phase,
no antibodies are detected in circulation.
2. Log
phase:
This
is
the
next
phase
characterised by a steady rise in antibody titres
in the circulation.
3. Plateau: This is a phase of equilibrium
between antibody synthesis and catabolism.
4. Phase of decline: This phase is characterised
by an increase in antibody catabolism com-
pared to antibody production, leading to a fall
in antibody titre in the circulation.
Humoral Immune Response
It is of two types: primary and secondary.
Primary Response
During the primary response, when an individual
encounters an antigen for the ﬁrst time, antibody
response to that antigen is detectable in the serum
after a longer lag period (lag phase) than occurs
in the secondary response. The serum antibody
concentration continues to rise (log phase) for
several weeks, and then it sustains (plateau
phase) for a while and ﬁnally, antibody level
declines (phase of decline); it may drop to very
low levels. A small clone of B-cells and plasma
cells speciﬁc for the antigen are formed during
this primary response.
The lag period is typically of 7–10 days dura-
tion but can be longer, even for weeks, depending
on the nature of the antigen. For example, the lag
phase may be as long as 2–3 weeks with some
antigens, such as diphtheria toxoid, whereas it
may be as short as a few hours with pneumococ-
cal polysaccharides. The lag period also depends
on the dose of the antigen and the route of admin-
istration, whether oral or parenteral. IgM is the
ﬁrst antibody to be formed, followed by IgG, IgA
or both. IgM levels tend to decline sooner than
IgG levels (Fig. 16.1).
Secondary Response
The antibody response is typically more rapid in
the secondary response due to a second encounter
with the same antigen or a closely related “cross-
reacting” antigen, months or years after the pri-
mary response. The lag period is typically very
short (only 3–5 days). The antibody level is also
much higher than that during the primary response.
These changes in secondary response are
attributed to the persistence of antigen-speciﬁc

“memory cells” following the ﬁrst contact with
the antigen. These memory cells proliferate in
large numbers to produce large clones of speciﬁc
B-cells and plasma cells that mediate the second-
ary response. The amount of IgM produced in the
secondary response is qualitatively similar to that
produced after the ﬁrst contact with the antigen;
however, much more IgG is produced, and the
IgG level tends to persist much longer than in the
primary response. Furthermore, such an antibody
tends to bind antigen more ﬁrmly (i.e. to have
higher afﬁnity) and thus to dissociate less easily.
Improved antibody binding is due to mutations in
the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that encodes
the antigen-binding site. This process is called
somatic hypermutation.

The differences between primary and second-
ary humoral immune responses are listed in
Table 16.2.
Elimination of Antigens
Route of administration of antigen affects the site
of localisation of these antigens in the body. For
example, most of the antigens introduced subcu-
taneously are localised mainly in the draining
lymph nodes, and only a small amount is there
in the spleen. On the other hand, most of the
antigens introduced intravenously are localised
in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, kidney and
lungs but not in lymph nodes. Approximately
three-fourths of these antigens are broken down
by reticuloendothelial cells and excreted in the
urine.
Particulate antigens are removed in
two
phases—the non-immune and immune elimina-
tion phases. In the non-immune phase, the antigen
is engulfed by the phagocytes, and processed to
make it inactive and then eliminated. The immune
phase begins with the appearance of the ﬁrst
antibody to that antigen. This antibody forms
complexes with the antigen, which are then
phagocytosed
and
eliminated.
This
immune
phase removes antigen at an accelerated rate.
Soluble antigens are eliminated in three stages
or
phases—equilibration,
metabolism
and
immune elimination. In the phase of equilibra-
tion, the antigen diffuses into the extravascular
spaces. The antigen levels fall owing to catabolic
decay in the metabolism phase. The phase of
immune elimination is characterised by the for-
mation of antigen–antibody complexes, leading
to rapid clearance of antigen. However, these
complexes can damage tissue, causing immune
complex diseases (e.g. serum sickness).
The rate of antigen elimination depends on its
metabolism
rate,
protein
antigens
being
eliminated in a few days, whereas polysaccharide
antigens require months or years for the same.
This principle can be exploited in designing
vaccines (e.g. pneumococcal polysaccharide can
persist for up to 20 years in humans, so it can be a
good vaccine candidate).
Production of Antibodies Following
Antigen Presentation
Synthesis and production of antibodies typically
are dependent on a complex interaction of three
cells, namely macrophages, helper T-cells and
B-cells. The process undergoes through following
stages:
Antigen Processing
This is the ﬁrst step in which antigens are
presented to immunocompetent cells by antigen-
presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages
and dendritic cells. Processing by macrophages
appears
to
be
a
prerequisite
for
forming
antibodies
against
many
T-cell-dependent
antigens (Fig.
16.2),
such
as
proteins
and
erythrocytes.
However,
antibody
production
does not require macrophage participation in the
case of T-cell-independent antigens. Both the

macrophages and dendritic cells present either
native or processed antigen at the cell surface.
Macrophages play a key role by modulating the
optimum
dose
of
antigen
presented
to
lymphocytes to induce immune responses.
Humoral Immunity (Antibody-Mediated Immunity)
215
Fig. 16.2 T-cell-dependent immune response
T- and B-Cell Activation
After processing antigens by a macrophage, anti-
gen fragments appear on surfaces of macrophages
in association with Class-II MHC (Major Histo-
compatibility Complex) proteins. The antigen-
Class-II MHC protein complex binds to speciﬁc
receptors present on the surface of helper T-cells.
Subsequently,
these
helper
T-cells
produce
cytokines
that
activate
B-cells,
producing
antibodies speciﬁc to that antigen. The activated
cytokines are interleukin-2 (IL-2: T-cell growth
factor),
IL-4
(B-cell
growth
factor)
and
interleukin-5 (B-cell differentiation factor). The
activated B-cells undergo clonal proliferation
and differentiate to form plasma cells, producing
speciﬁc immunoglobulins (antibodies). Major
host defence functions of antibodies include
neutralisation
of
toxins
and
viruses
and
opsonisation (coating) of the pathogen, which
aids its uptake by phagocytic cells.
Although helper T-cells play a key role in the
formation
of
antibodies,
certain
substances
(e.g.
polysaccharides)
can
activate
B-cells
directly
without
the
help
of
T-cells.
Such
substances
are
called
T-cell-independent
antigens. These antigens, however, induce only
the production of IgM antibodies but no other
antibodies by B-cells. This is because B-cells
require IL-4 and IL-5 to switch classes to produce
IgG, IgA and IgE. These IL-4 and IL-5 are pro-
duced by T-helper-cells only.
B-cells perform two important functions:
(1) They recognise antigens with their surface
IgM that acts as an antigen receptor; besides,
they present epitopes to helper T-cells in associa-
tion with Class-II MHC proteins. IgM antigen
receptor
on
the
B-cells
recognises
foreign
proteins
and
lipids,
carbohydrates,
DNA,
ribonucleic acid (RNA) etc. (2) On the other
hand, Class-II MHC proteins present protein
fragments to the helper T-cells. The IgM antigen
receptor binds with this wide variety of molecules
that stimulate B-cells to produce antibodies
against all the molecules possible.

216

Immune Response
Factors Influencing the Production
of Antibodies
Many factors affect the production of antibodies.
Genetic Factors
These factors inﬂuence the response of the host to
antigen. Persons responding to antigens are called
responders, whereas persons not responding are
called non-responders. These differences are con-
trolled genetically and controlled by the immune
response (Ir) gene located in the short arm of the
sixth chromosome.
Age
The embryo and the infant, at birth, are not fully
immunologically competent. Full competence is
achieved by about the age of 5–7 years for IgG
and 10–15 years for IgA by the development of
lymphoid organs.
Nutritional Status
Malnutrition affects both the humoral and cell-
mediated immunities. Deﬁciencies of amino acids
and vitamins have been shown to decrease the
production of antibodies.
Route of Antigen Administration
Induction of immune response in a host depends
on the route of administration of the antigen.
Parenteral administration of the antigen induces
a better immune response than the oral or nasal
routes.
Multiple Antigens Administration
Antibody responses vary when two or more
antigens are administered simultaneously. Anti-
body responses to one or more of them may be
diminished due to antigenic competition or
enhanced as seen after vaccination with the triple
vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), or
may be similar. Hence, different antigens’ nature
and relative proportions should be carefully
adjusted for optimal effect.
Antigen Doses
A minimum critical antigen dose is essential to
elicit an optimum immunological response. A
very high or small dose fails to stimulate the
immune system. This phenomenon is referred to
as immunological paralysis.
Antigen Interactions
The concomitant administration of two or more
antigens can have two effects. Either the antibody
production against one or more antigens will be
enhanced, or it may be diminished. It has impor-
tance in vaccinology where multiple serotypes of
the same pathogen (like a multivalent pneumo-
coccal vaccine) or antigen cocktail of diverse
organisms are used for active immunisation. The
classical example is the diphtheria-pertussis-teta-
nus vaccine, where the presence of a protein
component of the pertussis fraction enhances the
immunogenicity
of
diphtheria
and
tetanus
toxoids.
Adjuvants
Adjuvants are substances that enhance the immu-
nogenicity of an antigen. The adjuvants delay the
release of an antigen from the injection site and
prolong the antigenic stimulus. The substances
that are used as adjuvants include: (1) Freund’s
incomplete
adjuvant
(protein
antigen
incorporated in the water phase of water in oil
emulsion);
(2)
Freund’s
complete
adjuvant
(incomplete adjuvant along with the suspension
of killed tubercle bacilli); (3) aluminium salts,
both phosphate and hydroxide and (4) others,
such as silica particles, beryllium sulphate,
endotoxin etc.
An adjuvant functions in many ways. It
(1) causes sustained release of antigen from the
depot, (2) enhances the immunogenicity of
non-antigenic substances, (3) increases the con-
centration
and
persistence
of
antibodies,
(4) induces and enhances CMI, (5) activates
macrophages, and (6) stimulates lymphocytes
non-speciﬁcally.
Immunosuppressive Agents
Immunosuppressive agents are those that sup-
press the immune response. They are used in
transplantation surgery and in situations that
require suppression of host immunity. The agents
are as follows:

X-irradiation: Sub-lethal dose of irradiation is
Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
217
toxic to replicating cells and is used to sup-
press antibody formation. Antibody produc-
tion ceases after 24 h of receiving irradiation.
Radiometric drugs: These include alkylating
agents (such as cyclophosphamide, nitrogen
mustard), which suppress antibody production.
Cyclophosphamide,
given
for
3
days,
completely suppresses the antibody response.
It selectively prevents the replication of B-cells.
Corticosteroids:
Corticosteroids
are
anti-
inﬂammatory
drugs
that
diminish
the
responsiveness of both B- and T-cells. They
alter the maturation of activated cells by
suppressing the production of interleukins.
They suppress delayed hypersensitivity, but in
therapeutic doses for a short period, they have
little effect on the production of antibodies.
Antimetabolites:
These
include
folic
acid
antagonists (such as methotrexate); analogues
of purine (6-mercaptopurine and azathio-
prine); and analogues of cytosine (cytosine
arabinose) and uracil (5-ﬂuorouracil). These
substances inhibit DNA and RNA syntheses,
inhibiting cell division and differentiation,
essential for cellular and humoral immune
responses. These are usually used for the pre-
vention of graft rejection.
Antilymphocyte serum (ALS): It is a heteroge-
neous
antiserum
raised
against
T-lymphocytes. The ALS acts mainly against
circulating
lymphocytes
but
not
against
lymphocytes in lymphoid organs. It is mainly
used to prevent graft rejection in transplanta-
tion surgery.
Effect of Antibodies
The primary defence mechanism of the host is to
produce antibodies against infectious pathogens
and their products. Antibodies act by the follow-
ing mechanism:
Neutralisation
Antibodies bind to the pathogen or foreign sub-
stance, thus blocking the pathogen’s binding to
their targets. For example, antibodies produced
against the bacterial toxins prevent their binding
to
the
host
cells,
thus
making
the
toxin
ineffective. In the same way, antibodies prevent
infection or colonisation of virus or bacterial
pathogen by binding to them and blocking the
binding of the pathogen to target cells.
Opsonisation
Antibody opsonises the pathogen or foreign sub-
stance by binding to them and assisting in
phagocytes’ uptake and destruction of substances.
The Fc receptors of the phagocytes interact with
the Fc region of another antibody, thus facilitating
the pathogen for phagocytosis.
Complement Activation
Antibody activates the complement cascade that
effectively kills certain bacteria and viruses.
Additionally, pathogens can be opsonised by cer-
tain components of the complement cascade
(e.g. C3b), thus rendering the uptake of the path-
ogen via complement receptors by phagocytes.
Antibodies can be induced in the host actively
by using vaccines or acquired passively to confer
immediate protection against the pathogen. For
example, hyperimmunised sera containing ready-
made antitoxins against toxins of tetanus, botu-
lism or diphtheria are given to neutralise the
actions of these toxins immediately in the body.
Also, hyperimmune sera containing a high titre of
speciﬁc antibodies are given to inhibit attachment
and replication of rabies and hepatitis A and B
viruses early during the period of incubation.
Tests for Detection of Humoral Immunity
The measurement of IgG, IgM and IgA in the
patient’s serum is the primary method for
detecting humoral immunity. Radial immunodif-
fusion
and
immunoelectrophoresis
are
the
methods frequently employed for the measure-
ment of antibodies.
Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a speciﬁc type
of acquired immune response not mediated by
antibodies but by sensitised T-cells. This form
of immunity is transferred from donor to recipi-
ent, not with antisera but with intact lymphocytes;

hence it is called a cell-mediated immune reac-
tion. It is stimulated by T-helper type I (Th1)
lymphocytes
and
the
cytokines
released
in
response to antigens. This type of immunity kills
the infected cells by recognising antigens found
on them. CMI mainly targets the microbes that
survive the phagocytosis and also that infect
non-phagocytes. CMI removes the virus-infected
cells actively and protects against protozoans,
intracellular bacteria and fungi. It plays an impor-
tant function in transplant rejection and graft–host
reaction.
218
16
Immune Response
Functions of CMI
It
performs
the
following
immunological
functions: (1) It confers immunity in diseases
caused by obligate intracellular pathogens such
as bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Myco-
bacterium leprae, Brucella etc.), viruses (small-
pox, measles, mumps etc.), fungi (Histoplasma
capsulatum,
Blastomyces
dermatitidis,
Coccidioides immitis etc.) and parasites (Toxo-
plasma gondii, Leishmania donovani etc.). (2) It
participates in immunological surveillance and
immunity against cancer. (3) It plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of delayed hypersensitiv-
ity reactions and certain autoimmune diseases,
such as autoimmune thyroiditis, encephalitis.
Induction of CMI
The induction of the CMI depends on the nature
of the antigenic stimulus. It is best developed
following infection with intracellular parasites.
Only T-cell-dependent antigens induce CMI.
Killed vaccines or other non-living antigens do
not
induce
CMI
unless
administered
with
Freund’s adjuvants. Induction of CMI involves
sequence stages of (1) antigen processing and
presentation to T-cells, (2) recognition of antigen
by T-cells, and ﬁnally (3) release of cytokines by
Tc lymphocytes.
1. Antigen processing and presentation to
T-cells: Induction of CMI begins with the
presentation of foreign antigen by APCs to
T-lymphocytes.
Proteins
from
exogenous
antigens, such as bacteria, are internalised via
endocytic
vesicles
into
APCs,
such
as
macrophages (Fig. 16.3). Then, they are
exposed to cellular proteases in intracellular
vesicles.
Peptides,
approximately
10–30
amino acid residues in length, are generated
in
endosomal
vesicles.
The
endosomal
vesicles can then fuse with exocytic vesicles
containing Class-II MHC molecules.
2. Recognition of antigen by T-cells: T-cells
recognise antigens only when presented with
MHC molecules. The combination of foreign
antigen
and
Class-I
MHC
molecule
is
recognised by CD8+ cells. These CD8+ cells,
after recognition, differentiate into Tc and Ts
lymphocytes. On the other hand, CD4+ cells
recognise the combination of antigen and
Class-II MHC antigen, after which they are
differentiated into Th and Td cells. Subse-
quently, the sensitised T-lymphocytes undergo
blast transformation, clonal proliferation and
differentiation into memory cells and effector
cells, such as Th, Tc, Td and Ts.
3. Release of cytokines by Tc lymphocytes:
Finally, the lymphokines, which are biologi-
cally active products responsible for various
manifestations of CMI, are released by the
activated lymphocytes resulting in the lysis of
the target cells.
Cytokines
The
interleukins,
lymphokines,
chemokines,
interferons (IFNs) and tumour necrosis factors
(TNFs) altogether are called cytokines. Usually,
hormones or growth factors are not considered
cytokines. However, some overlaps in the termi-
nology still exist. These small stretches of peptide
cell signalling molecules regulate the host’s
immunological,
inﬂammatory
and
reparative
responses.
Cytokines
are
highly
active
and
potent
hormone-like substances that mediate biological
effects
even
at
femtomolar
concentrations.
Cytokines actively participate in a wide range of
biological activities varying from chemotaxis to

activation of speciﬁc cells. They are produced in
response to speciﬁc antigenic stimuli, and they
are not stored as preformed proteins. They are
synthesised by the initiation of gene transcription,
and their messenger-RNAs (mRNAs) also have a
very short period.
Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
219
Fig. 16.3 Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses
Cytokines are biologically active substances
secreted by monocytes, lymphocytes and other
cells and are actively involved in innate immu-
nity, adaptive immunity and inﬂammation. The
initial terminologies used to identify cytokines are
based on their established biological effects
(Table 16.3). The substances that are released
from T-lymphocytes are called lymphokines.
On the other hand, substances released from
macrophages
or
monocytes
are
termed
monokines. The secretory products of leucocytes
are called interleukin, and they have regulatory
effects
on
other
immune
cells.
Similarly,
interferons (IFNs), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
and other secretory products have such regulatory
effects.
These
small
proteins
with
speciﬁc
biological activities (important in cell signalling)
have been termed cytokines.
The cytokines differ from endocrine hormones
because: (1) cytokines are not the products of
specialised cells, but they are being produced by
immune system components, which are widely
distributed in the body such as lymphocytes,
macrophages, ﬁbroblasts and platelets; (2) the

mode of action is paracrine or autocrine, that is,
they act directly on the producing cell themselves
or nearby cells but not through systemic means;
and (3) cytokines are pleiotropic, that is, they are
involved in various biological activities.

Due to the introduction of recombinant DNA

and characterised. Few cytokines synthesised by
recombinant DNA technology are being used as
protein
therapeutics.
The
list
of
important
cytokines, and their sources and functions are
highlighted in Table 16.4.
Interleukins
Different interleukins have regulatory effects on
other immune cells.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1): It is a protein produced
mainly
by
activated
macrophages
and
monocytes. Its production is stimulated by
antigens, toxins and inﬂammatory processes
but
inhibited
by
cyclosporine
and
corticosteroids. It is an important interleukin
that mediates a wide range of metabolic, phys-
iological, inﬂammatory and haematological
activities. It has many important functions. It
activates a wide range of target cells, including
T- and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelial
cells and ﬁbroblasts to proliferate, differentiate
or synthesise speciﬁc products. For example, it
stimulates helper T-cells to produce IL-2 and
stimulates B-cells to proliferate and synthesise
antibodies etc. It acts on the hypothalamus to
cause fever associated with infections and
other inﬂammatory reactions.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2): IL-2 is mainly produced by
helper T-cells. It is a major T-cell growth
factor. It stimulates both helper and cytotoxic
T-cells to grow. IL-2 stimulates the monocytes
and natural killer (NK) cells and activates the
growth of B-cells. IL-2 activates the T-cells in
an autocrine manner resulting in the IL-2R
expression and IL-2 production. IL-2 binds to
IL-R, stimulating cell division. If an antigen no
longer activates the T-cells, the IL-2R will

eventually decay and end the proliferative
phase.
Interleukin-3 (IL-3): IL-3, upon interaction with
the IL-3 receptor, facilitates its function. It is
involved in the proliferation of multipotent
haematopoietic stem cells into myeloid pro-
genitor cells. IL-3 acts as a bone marrow
stem cell growth factor and is also called a
multi-colony-stimulating factor (CSF).
Interleukin-4 (IL-4): It is a protein produced
mainly by helper T-cells and macrophages. It
stimulates the development of Th-2 cells, the
subset of helper T-cells that produces IL-4 and
IL-5 and enhances humoral immunity by pro-
ducing antibodies. It is also required for class
(isotype)
switching
from
one
class
of
antibodies
to
another
within
antibody-
producing cells.
Interleukin-5 (IL-5): It is a protein produced by
helper T-cells. It promotes the growth and
differentiation of B-cells and eosinophils. It
enhances IgA synthesis and stimulates the pro-
duction and activation of eosinophils.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6): It is a protein produced by
helper T-cells and macrophages. It stimulates
the production of acute-phase proteins by the
liver. It also acts on the hypothalamus to cause
fever.
Other interleukins (ILs): IL-10, IL-12 and IL-13
are
the
other
interleukins
that
affect
lymphocytes.
Activated
macrophages
and
Th-2 cells produce IL-10. It is predominantly
an inhibitory cytokine. It inhibits the produc-
tion of type-I IFN. It inhibits the production of
IFN-γ by Th-1 cells, which changes the
immune system’s responses to Th-2 cells.
IL-10
inhibits
cytokine
production
by
activated macrophages and inhibits the Class-
II
MHC
expression
and
co-stimulatory
molecules in the macrophages, which results
in immune response depression.
IL-12 is produced by the activation of den-
dritic cells and macrophages. IL-12 induces the
IFN-γ production and stimulates the differentia-
tion of Th cells to become Th-1 cells. In addition,
it enhances the cytolytic functions of Tc and NK
cells.
IL-13
is produced by Th-2 cells.
It is
associated with the pathogenesis of allergic air-
way disease (asthma). It is involved in the occur-
rence of hyper-responsiveness seen in asthma.
Colony-Stimulating Factors (CSFs)
Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are secreted
glycoproteins that stimulate stem cells in the
bone marrow to form specialised white blood
cells. Haemopoietic stem cells are cultured on a
semi-solid matrix such as soft agar, and then
exogenous
factors
(stimulants)
can
be
administered to achieve proliferation and differ-
entiation of the cells into speciﬁc kinds of blood
cells. For example, factors capable of forming
macrophage colonies are called macrophage
colony-stimulating factors, for granulocytes,
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor etc. Certain
factors induce the growth of all haemopoietic cell
types and are called multi-CSFs, for example,
IL-3. CSFs have clinical applications in patients
undergoing chemotherapy. Neutropenia and bone
marrow are the known causes of chemotherapy.
CSFs tend to reduce the duration of a patient
being neutropenic and thus help to survive the
damage to bone marrow. It is also useful in
treating haemopoietic dysfunction in infections.
Interferons (IFNs)
Typically, a cell infected with a virus will release
IFNs, which helps adjacent cells to gain antiviral
properties (interfere with viral replication),
hence the name IFN was coined for this cytokine.
So far, more than 20 IFNs have been identiﬁed in
humans and other animals. IFNs can be divided
into three major classes. Leucocytes produce
IFN-α, ﬁbroblasts produce IFN-β and T-cells
activated by antigens, mitogens or IL-2 exposure
produce IFN-γ.
Other than antiviral activity, IFNs also have
other functions such as activation of NK cells and
macrophages, up-regulation of antigen presenta-
tion by elevated expression of MHC molecules
present on the APCs etc. Flu-like symptoms,
fever and myalgia commonly found in infections
are mainly due to the production of IFNs and
other cytokines. IFN-γ is responsible for many
immunological effects and antitumour activity.

Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
223
Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-b)
TGF-β is an inhibitory cytokine produced by
T-cells and other types of cells. It helps in the
activation of macrophages and inhibits T-cell pro-
liferation. TGF-β acts on endothelial cells and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, preventing the
proinﬂammatory cytokine effects. In essence, it
suppresses the immune response when it is not
required after an infection, promoting the healing
process.
Tissue Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a)
The
activated
macrophages
produce
TNF-α
against the microbes, mainly to the lipopoly-
saccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. It mediates
acute inﬂammation and produces chemokines
that are chemotactic cytokines. TNF-α stimulates
endothelial
cells
by
producing
adhesion
molecules, which mediates the arrival of the
macrophages and neutrophils to the site of infec-
tion. It also induces the hypothalamus to stimulate
fever and promotes the acute-phase protein
production.
Chemokines
Chemokines are a subtype of low-molecular-
weight cytokines with a characteristic structural
pattern. More than 50 chemokines varying in size
from 68 to 120 amino acids have been identiﬁed.
The alpha-chemokines, such as IL-8, are pro-
duced by activated mononuclear cells, which
attract neutrophils. The beta-chemokines such as
RANTES—“regulated upon activation, normal
T-cell expressed and secreted”—and MCAF—
“monocyte chemotactic and activating factor”—
are produced by activated T-cells and attract
macrophages and monocytes.
Chemokines are produced by endothelial cells,
resident macrophages and various cells present at
the
site
of
infection.
They
attract
either
macrophages or neutrophils to the site of infec-
tion; hence they are involved in chemical-induced
migration of leukocytes—a process called che-
motaxis. Speciﬁc receptors for chemokines are
present
on
the
surface
of
monocytes
and
neutrophils. They also facilitate the migration of
white cells into the tissue to reach the infected
area. They do so by activating integrins on the
surface of neutrophils and macrophages that bind
to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)
proteins on the surface of the endothelium.
Tests for Detection of CMI
The CMI can be detected by in vivo and in vitro
tests as follows:
CMI In-Vivo Tests
Skin tests are useful to detect delayed hypersen-
sitivity reactions to common antigens that come
in
contact
with
the
body.
Puriﬁed
protein
derivatives in the tuberculin test, dinitrochlor-
obenzene
or
dinitroﬂuorobenzene,
are
the
antigens used for skin testing. Most normal peo-
ple respond with delayed-type reactions to these
skin antigens. The absence of reactions to these
skin tests suggests impairment of the CMI.
CMI In-Vitro Tests
Many in vitro tests are available for the detection
of CMI.
1. Migration inhibiting factor (MIF) test: This
test is performed to determine the CMI by
making a semi-quantitative assessment of the
migration inhibition of leukocytes. This test
depends on the principle that cultured T-cells
produce macrophage migration inhibiting fac-
tor on exposure to the antigen to which they
are sensitised. In this test, human peripheral
leukocytes are incubated in capillary tubes in a
culture chamber containing culture ﬂuid. In the
absence of antigen, the leukocytes migrate out
to the open end of the tube to form a fan-like
pattern. In the presence of antigen, the
leukocytes are prevented from migrating.
2. Lymphocyte blast transformation: A large
number of T-cells undergo blast transforma-
tion when exposed to certain mitogens, such as
phytohemagglutinin
and
concanavalin.
Sensitised
T-lymphocytes
are
transformed
into large blast cells with a great increase in
DNA synthesis on exposure to the speciﬁc
antigen. An increase in DNA synthesis is

then
measured
by
incorporating
tritiated
thymidine.
3. Enumeration of T-cells, B-cells and subpop-
ulation: Fluorescence-activated cell sorter is
used to count the number of each type of
cells, whether T- or B-cells. In this method,
cells are labelled with monoclonal antibodies
tagged with a ﬂuorescent dye, such as ﬂuores-
cent or rhodamine. Then, the number of cells
that ﬂuoresce is registered bypassing those
single cells through a laser light beam.
The total number of B-cells can be counted
using ﬂuorescein labelled antibodies against
all immunoglobulin classes. Speciﬁc monoclo-
nal antibodies directed against T-cell marker
allows the counting of T-cells, CD4 helper
cells, CD8 suppressor cells and other cells.
The ratio of CD4 to CD8 in a normal person
is 1.5 or more but becomes less than one in a
person with acquired immunodeﬁciency syn-
drome (AIDS).
4. Rosette formation: Rosette is a lymphocyte
attached to three or more sheep erythrocytes.
Most T-cells form rosettes when mixed with
sheep erythrocytes. T-cell rosette is referred to
as E-rosette. T-cells can be determined by
counting E-rosettes. Rosette formation is use-
ful to detect T-cells, hence the CMI of the host.
5. Molecular methods: Some other assays have
been described, including the ﬁnding of alter-
ation of surface markers like CD25 and CD71
after activation of lymphocytes and measure-
ment
of
T-cell
cytokine
by
ELISPOT
(Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay.
For
tuberculosis,
the
interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ)-released
assays
measure
T-lymphocyte production of IFN-γ in response
to antigen stimulation, a measure of cell-
mediated immunity.
Transfer Factor (TF)
Lawrence, in 1954, ﬁrst reported the transfer of
CMI in humans by injection of an extract from the
leukocytes from the immunised host. The extract
from leukocytes contained a soluble substance
known as transfer factor (TF). The transferred
immunity is speciﬁc in that CMI can be trans-
ferred only to those antigens to which the donor is
speciﬁc. Transferred immunity is systemic and
not local. TF does not transfer humoral immunity.
TF is a nucleotide with a low molecular weight
of 2000–4000 Da. It is resistant to trypsin but gets
inactivated by heating at 56 C for 30 min. It is
non-antigenic. The exact mode of action of TF is
not known. It is believed to stimulate the release
of lymphokines from sensitised T-lymphocytes.
TF has many clinical applications. It is used to
treat disseminated infections associated with deﬁ-
cient CMI, such as tuberculosis and lepromatous
leprosy. It is also used to treat malignant mela-
noma and other types of cancer. It is employed to
treat Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and other T-cell-
deﬁcient syndromes.
Immunological Tolerance
Immunological tolerance is a state of speciﬁc
immunologic unresponsiveness to a particular
antigen to which a person has been exposed ear-
lier. The immune tolerance prevents the body to
mount an immune response against the self-
antigen.
Types of Immune Tolerance
The immune tolerance may be of two types: nat-
ural or acquired.
Natural
tolerance:
Natural
tolerance
is
non-responsiveness
to
self-antigens.
It
develops during the embryonic life, and any
antigen that comes in contact with the immune
system during its embryonic life is recognised
as self-antigen. The self-antigen would not
induce any immune response. Burnet and
Fenner also postulated that foreign antigens
would
not
induce
immune
responses
if
administered during embryonic life.
Acquired
tolerance:
Acquired
tolerance
develops when a potential immunogen induces
a state of unresponsiveness to itself. The anti-
gen
must
be
repeatedly
or
persistently
administered
to
maintain
the
acquired

Immunological Tolerance
225
tolerance. This is probably necessary because
of the continuous production of new B- and
T-cells that must be rendered tolerant.
Speciﬁc immunological tolerance: It is the
absence of immune response against a speciﬁc
or targeted antigen and maintenance of such
non-response in the individual. This has been
explored for the treatment and prevention of
autoimmune diseases. This kind of therapy
will
allow
the
individual
to
tolerate
autoreactive immune cells but permit the
immune system to react to other antigens.
Many such strategies are in experimental
phases, and
a few, like
soluble-peptide-
induced
tolerance
and
DNA-vaccination-
induced tolerance, and oral- or nasal-induced
tolerance, have entered clinical trial stages.
Factors Influencing Immunological
Tolerance
The induction of immune tolerance depends on
many factors.
1. Species and immune competence of the
host: Tolerance depends on the immunologi-
cal maturity of the host. Embryos and neonatal
animals are immunologically immature, hence
are more susceptible to induction of tolerance.
Rabbits and mice can be made tolerant more
rapidly than guinea pigs and chickens.
2. Physical nature, dose and route of adminis-
tration of antigens: These depend on the
nature of the antigen. Soluble antigens and
haptens can induce more immune tolerance
than the aggregated antigens. For example,
heat-aggregated human gamma globulin is
more tolerogenic than de-aggregated gamma
globulin in mice. It may be due to enhanced
phagocytosis of aggregated proteins than solu-
ble antigens by macrophages, in which they
can be presented to antibody-forming cells,
thus inducing antibody synthesis.
The induction of tolerance is dose-dependent
also. For example, a very simple molecule
induces tolerance more readily than a complex
one. Repeated minute doses and high doses of
antigen induce B-cell tolerance, whereas a mod-
erate degree of the same antigen may be immuno-
genic. The route of administration is also
important. In guinea pigs, intravenous or oral
administration of certain haptens causes toler-
ance, whereas intradermal administration causes
induction of immunity.
T-cells become tolerant more readily than
B-cells and remain tolerant longer. Tolerance is
overcome spontaneously or by injection of cross-
reacting antigens. For example, in rabbits, toler-
ance to bovine serum albumin can be abolished
by immunisation with cross-reacting human
serum albumin. The administration of immuno-
suppressive drugs can enhance tolerance. For
example, tolerance is enhanced in patients who
have received organ transplants.
Theories of Immune Response
There are two sets of theories of an immune
response. These are instructive theories and selec-
tive theories.
Instructive Theory
Instructive theory suggests that an immunocom-
petent cell can synthesise antibodies of all speci-
ﬁcity. The antigen directs the immunocompetent
cell to produce complementary antibodies.
Two instructive theories are postulated. Direct
template theory was ﬁrst postulated by Breinl
and Haurowitz. They suggested that a particular
antigen or antigenic determinant could serve as a
template model for folding the antibody pro-
duced. Thus, the antibody was assumed to con-
ﬁgure complementarily to the antigen template.
Burnett and Fenner postulated indirect tem-
plate theory in 1949. They suggested that the
entry
of
antigenic
determinants
into
the
antibody-producing cells induced a heritable
change in these cells. A genocopy of the antigenic
determinant was incorporated into the genome
and transmitted to the progeny cells.
However, both instructive theories that tried to
explain speciﬁcity and secondary responses are
no longer accepted.

226
16
Immune Response
Selective Theories
Three selective theories were postulated as
follows:
Sidechain Theory
This theory was proposed by Ehrlich. According
to this theory, immunocompetent cells have sur-
face receptors capable of reacting with antigens,
which have complementary side chains. When
antigens are introduced into the host, they com-
bine with those cell receptors with a complemen-
tary ﬁt. This inactivates the receptors. There is an
overproduction of the same type of receptors that
circulate
as
antibodies
as
a
compensatory
mechanism.
Natural Selection Theory
This theory was proposed by Jerne. According to
this theory, millions of globulin molecules were
formed against all possible range of antigens dur-
ing embryonic life. When introduced to the host,
the antigen combines selectively with the globu-
lin molecule that has the nearest complementary
ﬁt. The globulin with the combined antigen
stimulates antibody-forming cells to produce the
same type of antibody.
Both Side chain theory and Natural selection
theory, like instructive theories, are abandoned.
Clonal Selection Theory
The clonal selection theory is most widely
accepted and provides a framework for a better
understanding of the speciﬁcity, immunological
memory and the property of recognition of self
and non-self by adaptive immunity. Burnet
suggested that immunological speciﬁcity existed
in the cell but not in the serum and proposed the
most
acceptable
clonal
selection
theory.
According to this theory, many clones of immu-
nologically competent cells (ICCs) bearing spe-
ciﬁc antibody patterns are produced during foetal
development by the somatic mutations of ICCs
against all possible antigens.
unique receptor speciﬁcity, which is decided long
before the antigen is presented to lymphocytes.
This theory suggests that an individual ICC
exhibits membrane receptors, which are highly
speciﬁc against a particular antigen. ICC has a
Cells are activated upon the antigen binding to its
speciﬁc receptor and cause cellular proliferation
to form clones, synthesising the antibody.
Immune Network Hypothesis
Niels Jerne postulated the immune network
hypothesis of an adaptive immune system in
1974. According to this theory, the immune sys-
tem consists of lymphocytes and immunoglobulin
molecules bearing variable regions (V), which
form an interacting network. The V regions are
highly variable, and they bind to various antigens
and even to other V regions of the same immune
system. Thus, the immune system is a complex
network of V–V interactions.
The idiotypes are the shared characteristic
between a group of immunoglobulins, and they
have distinct amino acid sequences at the antigen-
binding site and adjacent parts of the V region. At
times, the idiotype acts as an antigenic determi-
nant and may induce anti-idiotypic antibodies.
Further,
these
anti-idiotypic
antibodies
can
induce antibodies to themselves, continuing this
process. This, in turn, forms an idiotype network-
ing, which is responsible for regulating the
amount of antibodies produced and the number
of antibody-forming cells in action. This postulate
by Niels Jerne about antibody production and
regulation of the immune system fetched a
Nobel
Prize
for
Physiology
and
Medicine
in 1984.
It is estimated that an individual’s immune
system produces approximately 108 various anti-
body molecules. According to the longstanding
dogma of “one gene-one protein”, producing such
a huge number of antibody molecules requires
millions of genes. However, the discovery of
split genes responsible for immunoglobulin pro-
duction has resolved this problem and clariﬁed
the genetic basis of antibody diversity. For this
outstanding discovery, Japanese scientist Susumu
Tonegawa was awarded a Nobel Prize for Physi-
ology and Medicine in 1987.

Hypersensitivity
17
Hypersensitivity reaction denotes an immune
response resulting in exaggerated or inappropri-
ate reactions harmful to the host, following con-
tact with speciﬁc antigens. It is a harmful
immune response in which tissue damage is
induced
by
exaggerated
or
inappropriate
immune responses in a sensitised individual on
re-exposure to the same antigen. Both the
humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune
response may participate in hypersensitivity
reactions. Prince of Monaco ﬁrst observed the
deleterious effects of jellyﬁsh on bathers. Subse-
quently, Portier and Richet suggested a toxin to
be responsible for these effects and coined the
term “anaphylaxis”.
Hypersensitivity
essentially
has
two
components. First sensitising or priming dose
(ﬁrst dose) of antigen is essential, which is
required to prime the immune system, followed
by a shocking dose (second dose) of the same
antigen that results in injurious consequences.
Classification of Hypersensitivity
Reactions
Hypersensitivity has been broadly classiﬁed into
immediate and delayed types depending on the
time taken for the reactions and the mechanisms
that cause the tissue damage. In the former, the
response is seen within minutes or hours after
exposure to the antigen, and in the latter, the
process takes days together to manifest as
symptoms.

227
Gell and Coombs classiﬁed hypersensitivity
reactions into four categories based on the time
elapsed from exposure of antigen to the reaction
and the arm of the immune system involved.
Types I, II and III are antibody-mediated and
are
known
as
immediate
hypersensitivity
reactions;
type-IV
is
cell-mediated
(i.e. mediated by cell-mediated immunity) and
is known as delayed hypersensitivity reactions.
Type-V hypersensitivity reaction has been
described later. It is called stimulatory-type
reaction and is a modiﬁcation of type-II hyper-
sensitivity reaction.
Type-I
(anaphylactic,
IgE
or
reagin-
dependent) hypersensitivity: It is also known as
IgE-mediated or reagin-dependent hypersensitiv-
ity reactions. IgE is responsible for sensitising
mast cells and providing recognition of antigen
for
immediate
hypersensitivity
reactions.
Individuals sensitised with antigen will have IgE
molecules ﬁxed on the mast cells and basophils.
An anaphylactic antigen reacts with IgE-ﬁxed
cells
and
releases
pharmacologically
active
substances from the basophils and mast cells dur-
ing subsequent exposure. The short time lag
between exposure to antigen and onset of clinical
symptoms is due to the presence of pre-formed
mediators in the mast cells. Thus, the time taken
for these reactions to initiate is minimal, so the
onset of symptoms seems to be immediate.

Type-II (cytotoxic) hypersensitivity: It is
mainly mediated by IgG antibodies, which react
with the cell surface or tissue antigens. Further, in
the presence of complements or mononuclear
cells, destruction of the cell takes place.
228
17
Hypersensitivity
Type-III (immune complex) hypersensitiv-
ity: Here, the antigen–antibody complexes medi-
ate hypersensitivity reaction. These immune
complexes may deposit in small blood vessels
and other tissues to interfere with their functions.
Type-IV delayed cell-mediated hypersensi-
tivity: This is due to the cell-mediated response
and does not involve antibodies. The antigen
speciﬁcally stimulates T-lymphocytes, and in
turn, secretion of lymphokines and phagocyte
accumulation occurs.
Type-V stimulatory hypersensitivity: This
type of hypersensitivity reaction is a modiﬁcation
of type-II reaction. Here, antibodies react with
host cell surface receptors, leading to cell prolif-
eration and differentiation.
Differences between immediate and delayed
hypersensitivities
have
been
summarised
in
Table 17.1.
Type-I Reactions (Immediate
Anaphylactic) Hypersensitivity
Type-I hypersensitivity reaction is commonly
called an allergic or immediate hypersensitivity
reaction. This reaction is always rapid, occurring
within minutes of exposure to an antigen, and
always involves IgE-mediated degranulation of
basophils or mast cells. The type-I reaction can
occur in two forms: anaphylaxis and atopy.
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially fatal and
systemic manifestation of immediate hypersensi-
tivity
reaction.
Individuals,
once
sensitised,
remain so for a long period.
Mechanism of Anaphylaxis
Both antigens and haptens can cause anaphylaxis.
The sensitising antigen and shocking antigen are
immunologically related. The initiator of type-I
reaction is otherwise known as an allergen.
Typical allergens include plant pollen, proteins
(e.g. foreign serum and vaccines), certain food
items (e.g. eggs, milk, seafood and nuts), drugs
(e.g. penicillin and local anaesthetics), insect
products (venom from bees, wasps and ants),
dust mites, mould spores and animal hair.
The exact reason for these substances to act as
allergens is not known, although they show some
common characteristics. Because these reactions
are T-cell dependent, T-cell-independent antigens
such as polysaccharides cannot elicit type-I
reactions.
Cytotoxic IgE antibody is the key immuno-
globulin molecule. The binding of IgE to the
mast cells is also known as sensitisation because
IgE-coated mast cells are ready to be activated on
repeat antigen encounters. It occurs when an anti-
gen (allergen) binds to IgE on the surface of mast
cells. On exposure to the antigen, Th2 cells spe-
ciﬁc to the antigen are activated, leading to the
stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE antibodies
(Fig. 17.1). The IgE then binds to the Fc portion
of mast cells and basophils with high afﬁnity. On
re-exposure to the antigen, the allergen cross-
links the bound IgE, followed by activation of
IgE and degranulation of basophils and mast
cells
to
release
pharmacologically
active
mediators within minutes.
In anaphylaxis, the effector cells include
(1) mast cells, (2) basophils and (3) eosinophils.
All these three cells contain cytoplasmic granules
whose contents are the major mediators of aller-
gic reactions. Also, all these three cell types pro-
duce lipid mediators and cytokines that induce
inﬂammation. Mast cells are the prime mediators
of anaphylaxis. Secretion of pre-formed contents
of their granules occurs by a regulated process of
exocytosis—synthesis and secretion of lipid
mediators;
and
synthesis
and
secretion
of
cytokines.
Pharmacological Mediators of Anaphylaxis
Instead of a single substance, many substances
are responsible for all manifestations of anaphy-
laxis. These include primary mediators and sec-
ondary mediators.

Primary Mediators
These are the pre-existing compounds present
inside basophils and mast cells and include the
followings:
1. Histamine: It is the most important mediator
of anaphylaxis. It is found in a pre-formed
state in granules of mast cells and basophils.
It causes vasodilatation, increased capillary
permeability and smooth muscle contraction.
It is the principal mediator of allergic rhinitis
(hay
fever),
urticaria
and
angioedema.
Antihistamines that block histamine receptors
Fig. 17.1 A schematic
diagram showing type-I
hypersensitivity reaction
are relatively effective against allergic rhinitis
but not against asthma.
2. Slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis
(SRS-A): These are produced by leukocytes.
These consist of several leukotrienes, which
do not occur in a pre-formed state but are
produced
during
anaphylaxis
reactions.
Leukotrienes
are
principal
mediators
of
bronchoconstriction in asthma and are not
inhibited
by
antihistamines.
They
cause
increased vascular permeability and smooth
muscle contraction.

Hypersensitivity
3. Serotonin: Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine
is found in a pre-formed state in mast cells and
platelets. It causes vasoconstriction, increased
capillary permeability and smooth muscle
contraction.
4. Eosinophilic chemotactic factors of anaphy-
laxis (ECF-A): It is found in a pre-formed
state in granules of mast cells. It attracts
eosinophils to the site of action. However,
the role of eosinophils is not clear in type-I
hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, it is
believed to reduce the severity of type-I hyper-
sensitivity
by
releasing
histaminase
and
arylsulphatase enzymes that degrade histamine
and SRS-A, respectively.
5. Secondary mediators are produced upon
stimulation by mast cells, basophils and other
leukocytes.
6. Prostaglandins
and
leukotrienes:
The
prostaglandins and leukotrienes are generated
after
the
degranulation
of
mast
cells.
Prostaglandins are lipid autacoids derived
from arachidonic acid and cause bronchocon-
striction and dilatation, platelet aggregation
and increased permeability of capillaries.
Leukotrienes belong to the eicosanoid family
and
are
synthesised
through
the
5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid
metabolism. The eosinophils, basophils and
mast cells are the primary producers of
cysteinyl leukotrienes. These leukotrienes are
1000 times more potent than histamine in
causing prolonged bronchoconstriction and
inducing mucus secretion, which is the under-
lying cause of asthmatic attacks in anaphylac-
tic reactions.
7. Platelet-activating factor (PAF): It is a low-
molecular-weight
phospholipid
responsible
for platelet aggregation, inﬂammation and ana-
phylaxis. PAF is produced in response to spe-
ciﬁc antigenic stimuli by various immune cells
such as neutrophils, basophils, platelets and
endothelial cells.
8. Enzymatic mediators: Mast cell granules
release
enzymes
such
as
proteases
and
hydrolases, contributing to an anaphylactic
reaction.
Types of Anaphylaxis
Cutaneous Anaphylaxis It is a wheal and
ﬂare reaction followed by intradermal inocula-
tion of a small shocking dose of antigens to a
previously sensitised host. The wheal is a cen-
tral, irregular, blanched, elevated, pale area
caused by oedema, surrounded by a ﬂare in
an area of erythema. A cutaneous anaphylactic
skin test helps identify allergens responsible
for the atopic disease (type-I hypersensitivity
disorder). In highly sensitised individuals,
introducing a small quantity of antigen (like
in skin tests) may lead to serious complications
and death. Adrenaline injections are used for
emergency treatment of allergic reactions
(type-1).
2. Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA) It is
an extremely sensitive test to detect antibodies
in vivo. Ovary ﬁrst described this method in
1958. In PCA, a small quantity of antibodies is
passively transferred to a normal animal by
intradermal injection. After a latent period
(4–24 h), a homologous antigen is injected
intravenously along with Evans blue dye, fol-
lowing which immediate bluing of skin at the
site of intradermal injection can be observed
due to the wheal and ﬂare reaction. PCA test
can be utilised to detect human IgG antibodies,
which is heterocytotropic and able to bind with
cells
of
other
species,
whereas
IgE
is
homocytotropic and cannot bind to cells of
other species, so PCA test cannot detect IgE
antibody.
Anaphylaxis
in
vitro:
The
vascular
and
non-vascular smooth muscle tissues obtained
from speciﬁcally sensitised animals of various
species and humans contract to a speciﬁc antigen
in vitro, and this phenomenon is called the
Schultz–Dale
phenomenon.
Passive
sensitisation of normal animal tissue can also be
done by appropriate treatment with the serum
obtained from sensitised animals. This immuno-
logical phenomenon is useful for demonstrating
immediate-type hypersensitivity in actively or
passively sensitised tissues.

Classification of Hypersensitivity Reactions
231
Clinical Manifestations of Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening condi-
tion that damages multiple organs usually. The
time for the symptoms to start exhibiting is based
on the hypersensitivity level and the amount,
exposure region and diffusibility of the antigen.
Multiple organs are affected usually, including
the skin (angioedema, urticaria, pruritus and
ﬂushing),
cardiovascular
system
(cardiac
arrhythmias and hypotension) and respiratory
tract (laryngeal oedema and bronchospasm).
When the death occurs, it is usually due to laryn-
geal oedema, intractable bronchospasm, hypoten-
sive shock or cardiac arrhythmias developing
within the ﬁrst 2 h (Table 17.2).
Anaphylactoid reaction: This appears to be
clinically similar to anaphylactic reaction but
differs
in
many
ways.
First,
it
is
not
IgE-mediated. Second, the inciting agents (such
as drugs or iodinated contrast media) stimulate
basophils and mast cells directly to release
mediators without any involvement of the IgE.
Management and Prevention of Anaphylaxis
Desensitisation is an effective way to prevent
systemic anaphylaxis. It is of two types: acute
desensitisation and chronic desensitisation.
Acute desensitisation involves administering
small amounts of antigen to which the person is
sensitive at an interval of 15 min. The complex of
antigen–IgE is produced in small quantities;
hence enough mediators are not released to pro-
duce a major reaction. However, this action is
short-lived because of the return of hypersensitiv-
ity reaction due to the continued production
of IgE.
Chronic desensitisation involves the long-
term administration of antigen to which the per-
son is sensitive at an interval of weeks. This
stimulates
the
production
of
IgA-
and
IgG-blocking
antibodies
that
prevent
the
subsequent antigen from binding to mast cells,
preventing the reaction.
Administration of drugs to inhibit the action of
mediators, maintenance of airways and support of
respiratory and cardiac functions form the main-
stay of treating anaphylactic reactions.
Atopy
The term atopy was ﬁrst coined by Coca to denote
a condition of familial hypersensitivities that
occur spontaneously in humans. Atopy is a recur-
rent, non-fatal and local manifestation of immedi-
ate hypersensitivity reaction. Atopy is associated
with mutations in certain genes encoding the
alpha chain of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor.
These mutations facilitate the effectiveness of
IL-4, resulting in an increased production of IgE
synthesis by B-cells.
The atopy shows a high degree of familial
predisposition and is associated with a high
level of IgE. It is localised to a speciﬁc tissue,
often involving epithelial surfaces at the site of
antigen entry. It is mediated by IgE antibodies,
which are homocytotropic (i.e. species-speciﬁc).
Only human IgE can ﬁx to surface of mast cells.
Common manifestations of atopy are asthma,
rhinitis, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. The
commonest atopic reaction is bronchial asthma.
Atopic individuals produce high levels of IgE in
response to allergens as against the normal
individuals who do not. This depends on an
individual’s propensity to mount a Th2 response
because it is only Th2 cell-derived cytokines that
stimulate the heavy-chain isotype switching to the
IgE class in B-cells. Stimulation of heavy-chain
isotype switching to the IgE class may be
inﬂuenced by various factors, including inherited
genes, the nature of the antigens and the history of
antigen exposure.
Atopic hypersensitivity is non-transferable by
lymphoid cells but transferable by serum. This
observation was used in the past to diagnose
PCA reaction by Prausnitz–Kustner reaction.
Prausnitz–Kustner Reaction
This is based on the special afﬁnity of IgE anti-
body for skin cells. In this experiment, serum was
collected from Kustner, who suffered from gas-
trointestinal allergy to certain cooked ﬁsh. The
same serum was given intradermally to Prausnitz,
who was then given another intradermal injection
of a small quantity of cooked ﬁsh into the same
site 24 h later. This resulted in a wheal and ﬂare at
the injection site within minutes. The test,

Atopy Sensitivity
Overproduction of IgE antibodies leads to atopic
sensitivity,
frequently
corresponding
with
decreasing levels of IgA. IgA deﬁciency may be
a predisposing factor for atopy. In the case of
normal individuals, IgA, which lines the respira-
tory and intestinal mucosa, deals with inhalant
and ingestion antigens, respectively; therefore
there is no participation of IgE-forming cells. In
IgA deﬁciency, antigens cause overproduction of
IgE by massive stimulation of IgE-producing
cells.
When an antigen combines with IgE-ﬁxed
cells, pharmacologically active substances are
released,
which
leads
to
atopic
symptoms.
Depending on the site of entry of the antigen,
clinical symptoms vary—conjunctivitis (follow-
ing exposure through eyes), rhinitis (following
exposure
through
the
nose),
gastrointestinal
symptoms
(intestinal
route)
and
dermatitis
(through the skin). Occasionally, the symptoms
may be away from the portal of entry. For exam-
ple, ingestion of antigens leads to urticaria. Usu-
ally, the treatment of atopy is the speciﬁc
desensitisation of the host.
Radioallergosorbent test (RAST), enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and pas-
sive agglutination tests are the frequently used
tests for detecting IgE in the serum for diagnosis
of atopy.
Type-II Reactions (Cytotoxic
Hypersensitivity)
Type-II
reaction
is
mediated
by
antibodies
directed against antigens on the cell membrane
that
activates
complement,
thereby
causing
antibody-mediated
destruction
of
cells
(Fig. 17.2). A membrane attack complex damages

the cell membrane during activation of the
complement.
Classification of Hypersensitivity Reactions
233
The reactions involve a combination of IgG or
IgM antibodies with the cell-ﬁxed antigens or
alternately circulating antigens absorbed onto
cells. The antigen–antibody reaction leads to
complement activation, resulting in forming a
membrane attack complex. This complex then
acts on the cells, causing damage to the cells, as
seen
in
complement-mediated
lysis
in
Rh
haemolytic
disease,
transfusion
reaction
or
haemolytic anaemia. Similarly, the antibodies
combining with tissue antigens contribute to the
pathogenesis of Goodpasture syndrome, pemphi-
gus and myasthenia gravis.
Free antigens or haptens may bind to the cell
surface in some instances. Subsequently, the
combination of speciﬁc antibodies with this anti-
gen or hapten leads to a reaction that damages the
cell. Certain drugs (such as penicillin, quinidine,
phenacetin) may induce haemolysis of red blood
cells (RBCs) in this way. They attach to the
surface of red blood cells and induce the forma-
tion of IgG antibodies. These autoantibodies then
react with the red blood cell surface, causing
haemolysis. Similarly, quinacrines attach to the
surface of platelets and induce autoantibodies that
lyse the platelets, causing thrombocytopaenia.
Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated
Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
It is another mechanism that involves the binding
of cytotoxic cells with Fc receptors in the
Fc-binding part of the antibodies coating the tar-
get cells. The antibody coating the target cell can
also cause its destruction by acting as an opsonin.
This mechanism is important in immunity against
large-sized pathogens, such as the helminths.
Type-III Reactions
(Immune-Complex-Mediated
Hypersensitivity)
Type-III reaction is mediated by antigen–anti-
body immune complexes, which induce an
inﬂammatory reaction in tissues.
In many situations, reactions between the vari-
ous antigens and antibodies in the body lead to
the formation of immune complexes (Fig. 17.3).
In the normal course, these immune complexes
are normally removed by the mononuclear-
phagocyte system through the participation of
RBCs. However, the body may be exposed to an
excess of antigens in many conditions, such as
persistent infection with a microbial organism,
autoimmunity to self-components and repeated
contact with environmental agents. When the
clearance capacity of this system is exceeded,
deposition of the complexes takes place in vari-
ous tissues.
Immune complexes are deposited (1) on blood
vessel walls, (2) in the synovial membrane of
joints, (3) on the glomerular basement membrane
of the kidneys, and (4) on the choroid plexus of
the brain. Sometimes, immune complexes are
formed at the site of inﬂammation itself. These
in situ immune complexes are potent activators of
the complement system and cause disease.
Arthus reactions and serum sickness reactions
are
two
typical
manifestations
of
type-III
hypersensitivity.
Arthus Reactions
Arthus reaction is an inﬂammatory reaction
caused by the deposition of immune complexes
at a localised site. This reaction is named after
Dr. Arthus, who ﬁrst described this reaction. The
time taken for the reaction from the antigen expo-
sure is 5 h generally. Tissue damage is caused by
the
deposition
of
antigen–antibody
immune
complexes and complements. Through its product
of activation, the complement causes vascular
occlusion and necrosis.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is the clinical
manifestation. Farmer lung, cheese-washer lung,
wood-worker lung and wheat-miller lung are
examples
of
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis
associated with different occupations. All these
conditions are caused by the inhalation of fungi or
bacteria present in different products handled by
infected people. Arthus reaction can also occur
locally at the site of tetanus immunisation if
toxoids are given at the same site within a very
short period of 5 years.

234

Fig. 17.2 A schematic diagram showing type-II hypersensitivity reaction
Serum Sickness
Serum sickness is a systemic inﬂammatory reac-
tion
caused
by
the
deposition
of
immune
complexes at many body sites. The condition
manifests after a single injection of a high con-
centration of foreign serum. It appears a few days
to 2 weeks after injection of foreign serum or
certain drugs, such as penicillin. However,
Fig. 17.3 A schematic diagram showing type-III hypersensitivity reaction

serum sickness is considered an immediate hyper-
sensitivity reaction because symptoms appear
immediately
after
the
immune
complex
formation.
Classification of Hypersensitivity Reactions
235
Unlike type-I hypersensitivity reaction, a sin-
gle injection acts as priming and shocking doses.
The typical manifestations are fever, lymphade-
nopathy, rashes, arthritis, splenomegaly and
eosinophilia. The disease is self-limited and
clears without sequelae.
Type-IV Delayed (Cell-Mediated)
Hypersensitivity
Type-IV
hypersensitivity
reaction
is
called
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) because the
response is delayed. It starts hours or days after
primary contact with the antigen and often lasts
for days. It differs from the other types of hyper-
sensitivity by being mediated through cell-
mediated immunity. This reaction occurs due to
the
activation
of
speciﬁcally
sensitised
T-lymphocytes
rather
than
the
antibodies
(Fig. 17.4).
Initially described by Robert Koch in tubercu-
losis as a localised reaction, this form of hyper-
sensitivity was known as tuberculin reaction.
Later, it was renamed as DTH on the realisation
that the reaction can be elicited in various patho-
logic conditions. DTH reactions are mainly of
two types: (1) contact dermatitis type and
(2) tuberculin (infection) type (another type, cuta-
neous basophil hypersensitivity, is discussed
later).

Contact Dermatitis
Contact dermatitis is a manifestation of DTH
occurring after sensitisation to certain substances.
These include drugs, such as sulphonamides
and neomycin; plant products, such as poison
ivy and poison oak; chemicals, such as formalde-
hyde and nickel and cosmetics, soaps and other
substances. This reaction manifests when these
substances acting as haptens enter the skin and
combine with body proteins to become complete
antigens to which a person becomes sensitised.
On second exposure to the same antigen, the
immune system responds by the attack of cyto-
toxic T-cells that cause damage, mostly in
the skin.
The condition manifests as itching, erythema,
vesicle, eczema or skin necrosis within 12–48 h
of the second exposure.
Tuberculin (Infection) Type of Delayed
Hypersensitivity
Tuberculin reaction is a typical example of
delayed
hypersensitivity
to
antigens
of
microorganisms, which is being used to diagnose
the disease.
Tuberculin Skin Test
This test is carried out to determine whether an
individual has been exposed previously to Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis or not. In this test, a small
amount of tuberculin (puriﬁed protein derivative,
PPD), a protein obtained from the M. tuberculosis
cell wall, is intradermally injected. The exhibition
of a slightly swollen, red, ﬁrm lesion after
48–72 h in the place of injection indicates a
positive test. A positive test indicates that the
person has been infected with the bacteria but
does not conﬁrm the presence of the disease
tuberculosis.
However,
if
a
person
with
a
tuberculin-negative skin test becomes positive, it

indicates that the patient has been recently
infected.
236
17
Hypersensitivity
The skin test, however, can even become neg-
ative in (1) infected persons receiving therapy
with
immunosuppressive
drugs
(such
as
corticosteroids and anticancer drugs) and (2) in
those suffering from the diseases associated with
suppressed cell-mediated immunity (such as
acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome [AIDS],
sarcoidosis,
lymphoma,
post-measles
vaccination).
Various Other Skin Tests are used to Detect
DTH
These include many skin tests in bacterial, fungal,
viral and helminthic infections. Positive skin tests
in coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis
and other fungal infections suggest exposure to
the fungi. In both viral and parasitic infections,
skin tests are less speciﬁc and less useful than
serological tests for diagnosis.
The lepromin test is a useful test for leprosy. A
positive lepromin test indicates the presence of
tuberculoid leprosy with intact cell-mediated
immunity. On the other hand, a negative lepromin
test indicates the presence of lepromatous leprosy
with impaired cell-mediated immunity.
Differences between contact dermatitis and
tuberculin-type
hypersensitivity
reaction
are
summarised in Table 17.3.
Type-V Reactions (Stimulatory-Type
Hypersensitivity)
In
this
type
of
hypersensitivity
reaction,
antibodies combine with antigens on the cell sur-
face, which induces cells to proliferate and differ-
entiate and enhances the activity of effector cells.
Type-V hypersensitivity reaction plays an impor-
tant role in the pathogenesis of Graves’ disease, in
which thyroid hormones are produced in excess
quantity. It is postulated that a long-acting thy-
roid-stimulating antibody, an autoantibody to thy-
roid membrane antigen, combines with thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors on a thy-
roid cell surface. Interaction with the TSH recep-
tor produces an effect similar to the TSH,
resulting in excess production and secretion of
thyroid hormone, responsible for Graves’ disease.
Table 17.4 summarises important features of
various types of hypersensitivity.
Cutaneous Basophil Hypersensitivity
It is a distinct form of lymphocyte-mediated
hypersensitivity reaction (resembling the tubercu-
lin response) with a delayed time-course different
from both the classic delayed-type and immediate
hypersensitivity reactions. Basophils on arrival at
the local site (basophil inﬁltration) may cause
degranulation, and the released vasoamine may
have protective or regulatory effects. This phe-
nomenon was formerly called Jones–Mote reac-
tion. It occurs in humans, guinea pigs and other
animals.
Cutaneous basophil
hypersensitivity
may be induced by sensitisation with various
antigenic
immunogens
(viruses,
allografts,
parasites, fungal antigens etc.). This reaction is
mediated by both T- and B-lymphocytes, and its
clinical signiﬁcance is yet to be known.
Shwartzman Reaction
Shwartzman
reaction
is
also
termed
the
Shwartzman phenomenon. It is a rare reaction
of a body or a local tissue characterised by
haemorrhagic necrosis due to antigen–antibody
reaction to particular types of toxins, called
endotoxins and other certain bacterial substances
(a variety of polyanions, glycogen or antigen/
antibody complexes). It is not an actual hypersen-
sitivity reaction but superﬁcially resembles a
hypersensitivity reaction, thus commonly dealt
with hypersensitivity reactions.
Shwartzman ﬁrst observed this phenomenon
in 1928; hence this reaction is called by his
name. He injected a culture ﬁltrate of Salmonella
Typhi intradermally into a rabbit, then 24 h later
same culture ﬁltrate was injected intravenously
into the same rabbit. Following this, he could
observe the development of a haemorrhagic
necrotic lesion at the site of intradermal inocula-
tion. During initial intradermal inoculation, vas-
cular damage occurs due to the aggregation of
leukocytes, and it is responsible for the develop-
ment of intravascular clotting, necrosis and

haemorrhagic lesion formation following intrave-
nous inoculation of antigens.

It is a two-stage reaction where intravascular
ﬁbrin thrombi are produced by the ﬁrst encounter
with endotoxin, which results in the reticuloendo-
thelial blockade. Upon a second encounter with
endotoxin,
the
reticuloendothelial
blockade
prevents the clearance of thrombi, resulting in
tissue necrosis and/or haemorrhage.
The initial intradermal dose (preparatory) and
the intravenous dose (provocative) need not be of
the same or related endotoxins to develop a
Shwartzman
reaction.
Because
of
this
non-speciﬁcity and short interval between two
doses,
the
Shwartzman
reaction
cannot
be
considered a hypersensitivity reaction. If both
preparatory and provocative doses are given
intravenously, the animal dies within 12–24 h,
and this reaction was ﬁrst described by Sanarelli
in the experimental cholera model. Hence, this
reaction is called as Sanarelli–Shwartzman
reaction.
Shwartzman phenomenon is usually observed
during delivery or abortion when foreign bodies
are introduced into the tissues of the female repro-
ductive system. It can also be observed in some
clinical conditions, such as fulminant meningo-
coccal septicaemia (Waterhouse–Friderichsen
syndrome).

Autoimmunity
18
Autoimmunity is a condition when the body
produces autoantibodies and immunologically
competent T-lymphocytes against its tissues.
Conditions
where
the
mechanisms
of
self-
tolerance fail are termed autoimmune disorders,
and the phenomenon is called autoimmunity.
Autoimmunity means protection against self;
however, it leads to injury to self in practice.
Autoimmunity is involved in different and dis-
tinct diseases at the clinical level, such as rheu-
matoid
arthritis,
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus, haemolytic anaemias, systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis and
myasthenia gravis.
Ehrlich, in 1901, ﬁrst postulated the existence
of tolerance to self-antigens as also those
situations where this mechanism would fail,
leading to horror autotoxicus. More recently,
understanding
the
various
immunological
mechanisms and disorders has led to the same
conclusions.
Autoimmunity diseases are chronic and non-
reversible. They are characterised by (1) any
levels of immunoglobulins; (2) presence of
demonstrable level of autoantibodies; (3) deposi-
tion of lymphocytes and plasma cells; and
(4) immunoglobulins or their derivatives at the
site of the lesion. Treatment with corticosteroids
or other immunosuppressive therapy beneﬁts the
patient.

239
Immunological Tolerance
Tolerance is a state of speciﬁc immunological
unresponsiveness to a certain antigen or epitope,
although the immune system is otherwise func-
tioning normally. The antigens present during
embryonic life are usually considered self and
do not stimulate an immunologic response;
hence the host remains tolerant to those antigens.
The absence of an immune response in the foetus
is due to the deletion of self-reactive T-cell
precursors in the thymus. On the other hand, the
antigens not present during the maturation pro-
cess are considered non-self and usually elicit an
immunologic response against those antigens.
Mechanisms of Tolerance
Both T-cells and B-cells participate in intoler-
ance, but T-cell tolerance plays a major role in
immunosuppressive
cell
tolerance,
which
is
explained by theories of clonal deletion, clonal
anergy and clonal ignorance.
Clonal deletion
The theory of clonal deletion described by Bur-
net, Fenner and Medawar based on their studies
on mice was the ﬁrst theory of tolerance. Recent
studies suggest that T-lymphocytes acquire the

ability to distinguish self from non-self by the
process of clonal deletion during the early phases
of life. This process involves killing T-cells (neg-
ative selection) that act against antigens, mainly
self-MHC – major histocompatibility complex –
molecules present in the foetus during that time.
The self-reactive cells die by apoptosis, a process
of programmed cell death.
240
18
Autoimmunity
Clonal anergy
Clonal energy is a process that leads to the inca-
pacitation of the self-reactive T-cells. These cells
become incapable of mounting an immune
response due to lack of proper co-stimulation
and are called anergic.
Clonal ignorance
This term describes self-reactive T-cells that
ignore self-antigens. These self-reactive T-cells
ignore self-antigens because the antigens are pres-
ent in very small quantities. Also, these self-
reactive cells are kept ignorant by physical sepa-
ration from the target antigens, such as the blood-
brain barrier.
B-cells’ tolerance to self-antigens is also due
to (1) clonal deletion of B-cell precursors while
they are in the bone marrow, and (2) clonal
anergy of B-cells in the periphery.
Mechanisms of Autoimmunity
The following mechanisms have been proposed
for the pathogenesis of autoimmunity:
Release of Sequestrated Antigens
Certain tissues, such as sperm, the central nervous
system, the lens and the uveal system of the eye,
are sequestrated or hidden. These sites are nor-
mally never exposed to the immune system for
various reasons. These are called immunologi-
cally privileged sites. When these hidden or
sequestrated antigens are released/exposed as a
result of injury, the host immune system—both
cellular and humoral—does not consider them as
self but as foreign, and hence attacks them. For
example, lens protein is enclosed within its cap-
sule
and
has
no
contact
with
circulation.
Therefore, immunological tolerance against lens
protein is not developed during foetal life. Fol-
lowing injury or cataract surgery, when this anti-
gen is leaked into circulation, it elicits an immune
response,
resulting
in
damage
to
another
eye’s lens.
Similarly, developing sperms are found within
the lumen of the testicular tubules, which are
sealed off early in embryonic development, prior
to the development of the immune system. These
developing sperms are enclosed within a sheath
of tightly joined Sertoli cells, hence are never
accessed to immune cells. If these are exposed
by surgery or vasectomy and injury, an immune
response occurs against the sperm, producing
spermatogenesis that may lead to male sterility.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), histones and
mitochondrial
enzymes
are
the
intracellular
antigens normally sequestrated from the immune
system.
However,
certain
viral
or
bacterial
infections
and
exposure
to
radiation
and
chemicals can damage these cells and release
sequestrated intracellular antigens into circula-
tion. These antigens then elicit a strong immune
response.
The
autoantibodies
are
produced
against these antigens, which combine with sub-
sequently released sequestrated antigens. This
results in the formation of immune complexes,
which causes damage to tissues. For example,
following infection by mumps, the virus causes
damage to the basement membrane of seminifer-
ous tubules, thereby eliciting an immune response
and resulting in orchitis.
Antigenic Alteration
Certain physical, chemical or biological factors
may alter tissue antigens, resulting in the forma-
tion
of
new
cell
surface
antigens
called
neoantigens. Intracellular pathogens, including
viruses, may induce alteration of cell antigens.
These neoantigens are no longer recognised as
self. Therefore, they appear foreign to the
immune system, eliciting an immune response.
Procainamide-induced SLE, myxovirus (viral
neuraminidase acting on erythrocytes inducing
altered antigen), infectious mononucleosis etc.
are examples of autoimmune diseases caused by
this mechanism.

Immunological Tolerance
241
Epitope Spreading
Epitope spreading is the term used to describe the
new exposure of sequestrated autoantigens due to
cell damage caused by viral infections. It is
another process that is believed to contribute to
the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. These newly
exposed
autoantigens
or
epitopes
stimulate
autoreactive T-cells, resulting in autoimmune
diseases. For example, in experimental animal
infection, multiple sclerosis-like diseases are
caused by an infection with an encephalomyelitis
virus. In this condition, the self-reactive T-cells
are directed against cellular antigens but not
against the virus that causes the sclerosis-like
disease.
Molecular Mimicry
Molecular mimicry is a process in which infection
by a particular microbial pathogen is associated
with the subsequent development of speciﬁc auto-
immune diseases. Sharing of M protein of Strep-
tococcus pyogenes and myosin of cardiac muscle
is one of many examples of molecular mimicry.
Repeated infections with S. pyogenes induce the
production
of
antibodies
against
certain
M
proteins that cross-react with myosin of cardiac
muscle, resulting in damage to cardiac tissue,
leading to rheumatic fever (Fig. 18.1). Similarly,
infection with Shigella spp. or Chlamydia spp.
may result in Reiter’s syndrome and infection
with Campylobacter spp. may lead to Guillain–
Barre syndrome. Development of encephalitis in
certain cases following vaccination with rabies
Semple vaccine is due to molecular mimicry of
sheep brain antigens, used in the vaccine, with
neural tissues in the brain.
Fig. 18.1 Pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever
Cross-Reacting Foreign Antigen
In
rare
instances,
infectious
agents process
antigens similar to those on the host tissue cells.
Thus, the antibodies generated by the immune
system to that particular antigen show cross-
reactivity with self-antigens, and it makes the
basis of autoimmunity. These cross-reactive
autoantibodies produced by the external antigen
stimulus can cause severe damage to host organs.
Several species have organ-speciﬁc antigens;
these heterologous antigens, when injected, may
elicit an immune response, causing damage to the
speciﬁc organ of the host.
An example of organ-speciﬁc cross-reactive
antigen is the neural vaccine developed by rabies
injected sheep brain tissue, which was used for
the vaccination against rabies in humans. The
sheep brain tissue antigen present in the vaccine
stimulates
antibody
production,
and
these
antibodies are cross-reactive to human brain
tissues, causing neurological injury.
Other cross-reacting foreign antigens, such as
Streptococcal M protein, and antibodies devel-
oped against these antigens are cross-reactive to
the heart muscle membranes, resulting in rheu-
matic fever. Thus, the repeated streptococcal
infection may result in heart muscle damage.
Some nephritogenic strains of streptococci pos-
sess similar antigens present on the human renal

glomeruli; thus, infection with such strains may
lead to glomerulonephritis. A similar autoim-
mune disorder can be seen in Chagas disease
caused by trypanosomes in which some of the
trypanosoma antigens resemble antigens present
on the surface of the specialised nerve cells
involved in
proper bowel
movements. The
cross-reacting antibody reacts with these nerve
cell antigens, disrupting the bowel movement
pattern.

Autoimmunity
Polyclonal B-Cell Activation
Polyclonal B-cell activation has a crucial role in
the pathogenesis of the systemic autoimmune dis-
ease. The possible mechanism of polyclonal
B-cell activation involves activation of multiple
B-cell clones by certain stimuli such as chemicals
(cyclophosphazenic compounds with ethylene-
amino groups), enzymes (trypsin), antibiotics
(nystatin) and infections with some of the
microbes.
In
some
infectious
diseases,
non-speciﬁc antibodies are formed; for example,
in mycoplasma infection, anti-human erythrocyte
cold antibodies react with red blood cells (RBCs)
of humans, and in infectious mononucleosis, anti-
sheep erythrocyte antibodies are produced. The
IgM polyclonal antibodies produced during poly-
clonal B-cell activation resemble the natural
antibodies of CD5+ B-cells.
Altered T- or B-Cell Function
Different experimental models suggest that CD4+
TH cells are involved in the development of auto-
immunity. The two T-cell subsets, Th1 and Th2
cells, are antagonists to each other. Elevated
levels of helper T-cell function and reduced sup-
pressor T-cell function could cause autoimmu-
nity. Defects in the thymus, abnormalities in
stem cell development and macrophage dysfunc-
tion have also been reported as causes of autoim-
munity. Similarly, idiotype and anti-idiotype
network
defects
also
have
implications
for
autoimmunity.
Studies have shown that genetic factors are
also important determinants of autoimmunity.
There is a familial clustering; monozygotic
twins are more prone to autoimmune disorders
than dizygotic twins. Mutations in single genes
have also been postulated as reasons for autoim-
munity. Though there are multiple proposed
mechanisms to alter T- or B-cell function, so far,
no single mechanism has shown its actual role in
autoimmunity.
Pathogenesis of Autoimmunity
Each of the mentioned immune mechanisms, as
mentioned subsequently, contribute a signiﬁcant
role in speciﬁc diseases or may be concurrently
involved speciﬁcally in multi-organ associated
and systemic autoimmune disorders.
Autoantibodies and Associated Diseases
Autoantibody-associated
disorders
are
characterised by the presence of autoantibodies
in the individual’s serum and by the deposition of
autoantibodies in tissues. Autoantibodies may be
directly involved in the pathogenesis of certain
diseases, while in others they may serve simply as
disease markers without a known pathogenic role.
They may also be instrumental in triggering vari-
ous pathogenic mechanisms leading to tissue
injury and cell death. Autoantibodies play a key
role in the pathogenesis of (1) myasthenia gravis,
(2) pemphigus vulgaris and (3) various autoim-
mune cytopaenias.
Immune Complexes Carrying
Autoantigens
The formation of immune complexes between
self-antigens
and
autoantibodies,
leading
to
end-organ damage, is another pathogenic mecha-
nism seen in autoimmune disorders. Only those
immune complexes of adequate size manage to
activate the complement system and are involved
in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Sys-
temic
lupus
erythematosus
(SLE)
and
polyarteritis nodosa are classic examples of auto-
immune diseases in which immune complexes
play a major pathogenic role.
Self-Reactive T-Lymphocytes
These antigens that are sequestrated or concealed
from the circulation, which are not exposed to the
developing T-cells in the thymus, do not develop

self-tolerance. Mature T-cells’ exposure to such
concealed antigens at a later stage results in their
stimulation.
Induction
of
autoantibodies
to
sperms
after
vasectomy,
sympathetic
ophthalmitis and the presence of antibodies to
myocardial cells after myocardial infarction are
examples.
Immunological Tolerance
243
Inappropriate Expression of Class-II MHC
Molecules
This can also sensitise self-reactive T-cells in
certain other situations. This is supported by the
clinical
observations
showing
increased
fre-
quency of autoimmune diseases in families and
increased clinical concordance rates in monozy-
gotic twins. Polyclonal B-cell activation may also
lead to the initiation of the autoimmune disease
process.
Animal models of autoimmunity: Better
understanding of the autoimmune disease has
been facilitated by many experimental studies in
animal models. The usual models used are mice
and rats. Experimentally induced autoimmune
diseases in these animals include (1) myasthenia
gravis, (2) multiple sclerosis, (3) rheumatoid
arthritis and (4) Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Classification of Autoimmune Disorders
Different molecules, cells and tissues are affected
in autoimmune diseases. Table 18.1 summarises
affected tissue, target antigens and resultant auto-
immune diseases. Autoimmune diseases can be
broadly classiﬁed as organ-speciﬁc autoimmune
diseases and systemic autoimmune diseases.
Organ-Specific Autoimmune Diseases
These are diseases in which autoantibodies are
produced targeting only the tissue of a single
organ, thus affecting it solely. These diseases
can be further sub-grouped based on tissue
damage as: (1) diseases triggered by a cell-
mediated autoimmune reaction, and (2) diseases
mediated by the action of autoantibodies.
Diseases Triggered by a Cell-Mediated
Autoimmune Reaction
Some of the diseases where the main mechanism
of
cell
damage
is
directly
mediated
by
lymphocytes are discussed below.
Hashimoto thyroiditis: Primarily, it is a
sub-clinical disease where no thyroid dysfunction
is apparent, and therapy is not required until the
later phases of the disease. The disease is devel-
oped by a variety of unknown factors that are
triggered by a cell-mediated autoimmune reac-
tion. The disease occurs commonly during the
third to ﬁfth decades, with a female-to-male
ratio of 10:1. It produces both autoantibodies
and Th1 cells speciﬁc for thyroid antigens. It is
the most common form of thyroiditis, and it usu-
ally has a chronic evolution.
A slow progression functionally characterises
the disease to hypothyroidism with an insidious
onset of symptoms. Most patients become hypo-
thyroid with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, cold
intolerance and constipation. The detection of
antithyroglobulin antibodies usually conﬁrms
the diagnosis.
Addison
disease
(chronic
primary
hypoadrenalism): The condition, also called
chronic primary hypoadrenalism, is caused in
two ways, either exposure to exogenous agents
or idiopathic. The idiopathic manifestation was
found to be involved by certain immune-related
mechanisms because, in more than half of the
patients, autoantibodies have been found against
the microsomes of adrenal cells. So, these
autoantibodies are found to have a major role in
the pathogenesis of the disease. The diagnosis is
conﬁrmed
by
demonstration
of
antiadrenal
antibodies by indirect immunoﬂuorescence test.
Addison disease is frequently associated with
other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroiditis,
pernicious anaemia and diabetes mellitus.
Diseases Mediated by Autoantibodies
In a few autoimmune disorders, antibodies act as
agonists that bind to hormone receptors instead of
normal ligands and trigger improper activity. This

Affected tissue
Disease
Target-antigen tissue affected
leads to the high output of mediators or elevation
in
cell
growth.
On
the
other
hand,
some
autoantibodies act as antagonists and block recep-
tor function by binding to hormone receptors.
This usually leads to impaired or decreased
production of mediators and moderate atrophy
of the diseased organ.

Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is the
prototype
autoimmune
disease
mediated
by
blocking
antibodies.
It
is
a
disorder
of

neuromuscular transmission. Autoantibodies pro-
duced in the patient with these diseases attach to
acetylcholine receptors lying on the motor end
plates of muscles. Furthermore, these antibodies
prevent the usual binding of acetylcholine and
lead to complement-mediated lysis of the cells.
Immunological Tolerance
245
Increased muscular fatigue and weakness,
especially becoming more pronounced following
exercise, are the usual symptoms of myasthenia
gravis. The face, tongue and upper extremities are
also
frequently
involved.
Skeletal
muscle
involvement is usually proximal. The disease is
usually
marked
by
spontaneous
remission
periods. Thymic abnormalities are frequent in
myasthenia gravis. About 10% of the patients
develop
malignant
tumours
of
the
thymus
(thymomas). The ﬁnding of anti-acetylcholine
receptor antibodies conﬁrms the diagnosis.
Graves’ disease: It occurs due to the produc-
tion of autoantibodies against the thyrotrophic
hormone.
The
thyroid-stimulating
hormone
(TSH) receptor antibodies (also known as long-
acting thyroid stimulators, thyroid-stimulating
immunoglobulin
and
thyroid-stimulating
antibodies) stimulate the activity of the thyroid
gland in Graves’ disease. These antibodies can
stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by
activating the adenylate cyclase system after
binding to the TSH receptor. These antibodies
are detected in 80–90% of patients with Graves’
disease and are usually of the IgG isotype.
Protruding eyeballs, also known as exophthal-
mos, is the classical presentation of the condition.
Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism include
increased
metabolic
rate
with
weight
loss,
nervousness, weakness, sweating, heat intoler-
ance and loose stools. This disease is more preva-
lent in women in their 30s. Thyroid gland biopsy
shows scattered lymphoplasmacytic interstitial
inﬁltration. Diagnostic tests show elevated levels
of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (triiodothyronine
and thyroxine) and elevated uptake of T3 and
antithyroid receptor antibodies.
Autoimmune orchitis: Primary autoimmune
orchitis is deﬁned by infertility and asymptomatic
orchitis associated with anti-sperm antibodies
(ASA: 100%) attached to the basement mem-
brane of seminiferous tubules in infertile men,
without any systemic disease. It is characterised
by inﬂammation of the testis and the presence of
speciﬁc anti-sperm antibodies (ASA). Secondary
autoimmune orchitis is indicated by symptomatic
orchitis and/or testicular vasculitis corresponding
with a systemic autoimmune disease, particularly
vasculitis.
Systemic Autoimmune Diseases
The autoantibodies are produced against a wide
range of host tissues in systemic autoimmune
diseases. These diseases reﬂect a general defect
in immune regulation that results in hyperactive
T-cells and B-cells. Tissue damage is widespread,
more generalised and leads to multi-system
disorders. Tissue damage is caused by cell-
mediated immune responses, autoantibodies or
the accumulation of immune complexes.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
SLE
is
a
generalised
autoimmune
disease
associated with humoral and cellular immunity
abnormalities with various clinical presentations.
It is most common in females of childbearing age.
The clinical manifestations of SLE vary among
different patients. The kind of organ (vital versus
non-vital) that becomes involved determines the
seriousness and the overall prognosis of the dis-
ease. A wide range of autoantibodies to a vast
range of tissue antigens, such as DNA, histones,
RBCs, platelets, leukocytes and clotting factors,
are produced in patients with SLE. When these
autoantibodies
combine
with
their
speciﬁc
antigens, it produces a variety of symptoms.
Demonstration
of
lupus
erythematosus
(LE) cells by incubating normal neutrophils with
damaged leukocytes pre-incubated with sera
obtained from SLE patients is typical of SLE.
The cell is a peculiar-looking polymorphonuclear
leukocyte that has ingested nuclear material.
Sunlight exposure is the ﬁrst environmental
factor to be identiﬁed that inﬂuences the clinical
evolution of SLE in a patient. Exposure to sun-
light may precede the clinical expression of the
disease or disease relapse. This is due to the
Langerhans cells of the skin and keratinocytes
that release signiﬁcant amounts of interleukin-1
upon
exposure
to
ultraviolet
(UV)
light.

Infections and also drugs are responsible for
setting off the disease process in certain suscepti-
ble individuals.
246
18
Autoimmunity
Laboratory diagnosis of SLE is made by
demonstrating antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in
various tissues and cell lines as substrates by an
indirect immunoﬂuorescence test. Demonstration
of nuclear ﬂuorescence after incubating the cells
with the patient’s serum indicates a positive test.
Four patterns of ﬂuorescence can be seen,
indicating different types of ANAs. ANA tests
have high sensitivity but low speciﬁcity. To rule
out the diagnosis of SLE, a negative result should
be obtained. A high value of titre does not con-
ﬁrm SLE but strongly suggests SLE. A false-
positive test can be seen in persistent infection,
and collagen and autoimmune disorders. Anti
dsDNA are found almost exclusively in SLE
(60–70% of the patients). Levels of serum anti-
DNA antibodies may vary with disease activity,
but they are poor predictors of disease activity.
There are several techniques to detect signiﬁ-
cantly elevated circulating immune complex
levels in SLE patients during the acute phase of
the disease.
Treatment of the condition is carried out by
administering corticosteroids and other anti-
inﬂammatory drugs. Other examples of systemic
autoimmune diseases include multiple sclerosis
and rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis
It is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease-
causing inﬂammation primarily affecting joints
and resulting in painful deformity and immobil-
ity. It is the most common type of autoimmune
arthritis and is associated with serositis, myocar-
ditis and vasculitis. Women are more prone to
suffer from this autoimmune disorder. It is a sys-
temic whole-body disorder principally affecting
synovial tissues, ultimately causing swollen and
oedematous joints due to the inﬁltration of
lymphocytes and plasma cells. Rheumatoid fac-
tor (RF) is the circulating autoantibody (antibody
produced against self-tissues) found in rheuma-
toid arthritis affected individuals. It is raised
against the Fc portion of IgG (an antibody against
an antibody), and altogether RF and IgG form
immune complexes that contribute to the disease
process.
RF in the serum of suspected rheumatoid
arthritis patients can be detected by using aggluti-
nation tests such as the Rose–Waaler test, which
is often modiﬁed from time to time.
Polyarteritis nodosa
It is a necrotising angiitis of small- or medium-
sized muscular arteries. It is commonly associated
with renal and visceral vessels. It may sometimes
end fatally with coronary artery thrombosis, cere-
bral haemorrhage or even gastrointestinal tract
bleeding. Though it is considered an autoimmune
disorder, the speciﬁc antibodies responsible for
the polyarteritis nodosa have not yet been
recognised. Infantile polyarteritis nodosa is a con-
dition found in infants. In polyarteritis nodosa,
the rosary sign (localised swellings appear like
strings of the rosary) is considered as one of the
diagnostic features of the vasculitis.
Sjögren Syndrome
It is a chronic autoimmune disorder, usually
involving a triad of conjunctivitis sicca (dry
eyes), xerostomia (dryness of mouth with or with-
out salivary gland enlargement) and rheumatoid
arthritis. The autoimmunity of this disorder is
mainly due to the destruction of the exocrine
glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal
glands, by host white blood cells. This syndrome
may be classiﬁed into primary or secondary types.
The primary Sjögren syndrome occurs by itself,
but secondary Sjögren syndrome occurs in
patients
with
collagen
diseases.
Individuals
suffering from Sjögren syndrome possess antinu-
clear antibodies and rheumatoid factors in their
sera, which can be used for diagnostic purposes.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Autoimmune
Diseases
Detection of autoantibodies remains the corner-
stone for the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions.
However, it has to be kept in mind that the mere
presence of such antibodies is not indicative of
disease since these autoantibodies may be present

in healthy individuals and patients suffering from
non-autoimmune diseases. Thus, the patient’s
clinical condition should be co-related with the
laboratory ﬁndings to interpret test results accu-
rately. The tests for autoantibodies can be divided
into screening tests and additional conﬁrmatory
tests.
Immunological Tolerance
247
Screening Test (Detection of Antinuclear
Antibody, ANA)
This is the initial test to rule in or rule out a
suspected autoimmune disease. Indirect immuno-
ﬂuorescent antibody test (IFAT) using human
HEp2 cells as the antigen is considered the gold
standard, although this test is also available in
ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay)
or immunoblot formats. This test screens approx-
imately
150
autoantibodies
directed
against
nuclear antigens and cell cytoplasm. If positive,
the titre and the pattern of immunoﬂuorescence
should be noted. Titres above 1:80 are considered
positive. The ﬂuorescent patterns like homoge-
nous, diffuse, speckled, peripheral suggest some
speciﬁc autoimmune diseases. In contrast, ELISA
provides high sensitivity but poor speciﬁcity. As
mentioned earlier, the mere presence of ANA is
not conclusive of autoimmune disease because it
is present in up to 15% of normal individuals
without any disease and 10–40% of the elderly
population. Moreover, it may be positive in unre-
lated infectious diseases like hepatitis C, tubercu-
losis and certain parasitic diseases.
Tests for Specific Autoantibodies
If ANA is positive in a patient strongly suspected
of having an autoimmune disease, further testing
should be done to diagnose speciﬁc conditions
like systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed con-
nective tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome, sys-
temic
sclerosis,
polymyositis
and
CREST
(calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal
dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia)
syndrome. Various autoantibodies like dsDNA,
chromatin,
Smith,
ribonuclear
protein,
centromere-b can be detected by ELISA or West-
ern blot methods.
Other Tests
In addition to the above autoantibodies, other
parameters like antineutrophil cytoplasmic anti-
body (ANCA), rheumatoid factor, complement
levels, immunoglobulin fractions, HLA B27
may be useful in the diagnosis of some autoim-
mune diseases.
Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases
Treatment of autoimmune diseases has undergone
a revolutionary change in the last two decades
with the introduction of biological drugs that
can modulate or block various immune system
pathways.
Traditionally,
anti-inﬂammatory
agents, analgesics and immunosuppressants like
corticosteroids were the mainstay of therapy.
However, in recent years, with a better under-
standing of the immune process and pathogenesis
of autoimmune diseases, various inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies directed against immune
response
molecules
are
increasingly
being
licensed and used. Some of these target cytokines
like TNF-α, IL-17, IL-1 receptor, while others
target T-cells (CD28) or B-cells (CD20). More
recent agents are directed against Janus kinases
(JAKs) and integrins.
HLA Association with Autoimmune
Diseases
The risk for many autoimmune diseases appears
to be associated with the presence of particular
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Some
autoimmune diseases have increased frequencies
in
persons
carrying
certain
HLA
genes.

Immunodeﬁciency
disorders
are
conditions
where the defence mechanism of the body is
impaired. They show enhanced susceptibility to
infection
with
common
or
opportunistic
microorganisms and increased susceptibility to
malignancies. Immunodeﬁciency can occur in
T-cells, B-cells, complement and phagocytes—
the major components of the immune system.
Immunodeﬁciency disorders can be classiﬁed as
primary
immunodeﬁciencies
or
secondary
immunodeﬁciencies.
Primary Immunodeficiencies
Primary immunodeﬁciency is a condition that
arises in the immune system due to a genetic or
developmental defect. In such cases, the genetic
defect present at birth sometimes may not reveal
until later in life. Most primary immunodeﬁ-
ciencies are inherited from parents to offspring
and may affect adaptive or innate immune
functions. Primary immunodeﬁciency diseases
can be classiﬁed as: (1) disorders of speciﬁc
immunity, (2) disorders of complement and
(3) disorders of phagocyte deﬁciencies.

X-Linked Hypogammaglobulinemia
X-linked
hypogammaglobulinemia,
infantile
agammaglobulinemia or X-linked agammaglobu-
linemia (XLA) is the prototype of “pure” B-cell
deﬁciency. This disease is transmitted in the
majority of cases as a sex-linked trait. The gene
responsible for this defect codes for the B-cell
progenitor kinase or Bruton tyrosine kinase
(Btk) protein located on the locus Xq21.2–22.
Btk plays an important role in B-cell differentia-
tion and maturation, and is also part of the group
of tyrosine kinases involved in B-cell signaling in
adult life.
In most cases, mutations in Btk are associated
with infantile agammaglobulinemia. X-linked
hypogammaglobulinemia
is
associated
with
extremely low levels of IgG, and lack of other
classes of immunoglobulin is the characteristic
feature of this disease. Individuals with XLA
disease lack peripheral B-cells and are often
affected by recurrent bacterial infections, starting
from 9 months of age.
The most common infections are caused by the
pyogenic organisms such as Staphylococcus
aureus,
Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae,
Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae with
the following condition such as pharyngitis,
sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, meningitis, pyo-
derma,
purulent
conjunctivitis,
otitis
media,
empyema, purulent arthritis and septicaemia.
The
recurrent
bronchopulmonary
infections
cause bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive
lung diseases. These patients are diagnosed with

a high frequency of Giardia lamblia infections
that cause chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption.
250
19
Immunodeficiency Diseases
Patients with agammaglobulinemia condition
have a higher chance to develop paralytic polio
upon attenuated virus vaccination. They also have
a high probability of developing chronic viral
meningoencephalitis
caused
by
echovirus.
About 30–35% of the cases develop arthritis in
the
large
joints
caused
by
Ureaplasma
urealyticum infections. This condition is best
treated with replacement therapy using gamma
globulin (a plasma fraction containing predomi-
nantly IgG, obtained from normal healthy donors)
administered intravenously.
Selective Immunoglobulin Deficiencies
In this condition, only one or more of the
immunoglobulins are deﬁcient in serum, while
the others remain normal or elevated. IgA deﬁ-
ciency is the most common example of selective
immunoglobulin deﬁciency. Indication of IgA
deﬁciency is the mere absence of serum and
secretory IgA. In such conditions, the level of
IgA is <5 ng/dL. However, the levels of other
immunoglobulin classes are normal or increased.
IgA plays a signiﬁcant role in the defence of
mucosal surface and is the principal immunoglob-
ulin in secretions. Thus, individuals with deﬁ-
ciency of IgA have a high incidence rate of
respiratory,
gastrointestinal
and
urogenital
infections. These patients also have an increased
incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as sys-
temic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthri-
tis. Some atopic individuals have a high incidence
of this IgA disorder. Certain patients with selec-
tive deﬁciency of IgA have signiﬁcant titres of
antibody against IgA and develop anaphylactic
reactions when receiving IgA-containing blood
transfusions.
Selective IgA deﬁciency is diagnosed by
demonstrating less than 5 mg/dL of IgA in
serum. They, however, have normal levels of
IgG and IgM antibodies. Some individuals
develop antibodies against IgG, IgM and IgA.
Hyper-IgM Syndrome
The condition is characterised by a high concen-
tration of serum IgM but a very low concentration
of serum IgG, IgA and IgE. They have normal
numbers of T-cells and B-cells. Some of these
immunodeﬁciencies are X-linked, and some are
inherited as autosomal recessives. Patients with
this condition are susceptible to recurrent micro-
bial infections and many autoimmune disorders,
such
as
thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia
and
haemolytic anaemia.
Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of
Infancy
The condition is characterised by hypogamma-
globulinemia in infants due to progressive catab-
olism of maternal IgG during the second and third
months of life. This condition may persist until
2–3 years of age and become progressively more
accentuated. In many cases, the delay in the syn-
thesis of immunoglobulin is due to the deﬁciency
in the function of TH cells. Intravenous gamma
globulin can be detected till the immunoglobulin
levels are normalised in children. However, nor-
mal functions of the immune system develop with
time in most children.
Interleukin-12 (IL-12) Receptor Deficiency
Patients with interleukin-12 receptor deﬁciency
are highly susceptible to disseminated mycobac-
terial infections. Lack of interleukin-12 receptor
prevents IL-12 from initiating a Th-1 response,
which is essential to prevent mycobacterial
infections.
Transcobalamin II Deficiency
It is an autosomal recessive trait associated with
vitamin B12 deﬁciency, megaloblastic anaemia
and intestinal villous atrophy. This, in turn,
results in low levels of plasma cells, decreased
immunoglobulin levels and impairment of phago-
cytosis. These disorders can be restored by intake
of vitamin B12. However, phagocytic functions
cannot be restored.

Primary Immunodeficiencies
251
Cellular Immunodeficiencies
Cellular
immunodeﬁciencies
include
the
followings:
Thymic Aplasia (DiGeorge Syndrome)
DiGeorge syndrome or thymic aplasia is a classic
example of a pure T-cell deﬁciency. This syn-
drome is not hereditary, even though it is a con-
genital immunodeﬁciency. It is caused by the
viral infection in the intrauterine prior to the
eighth week of life and involves microdeletions
in the chromosome region 22q11. From an immu-
nological perspective, this syndrome arises in the
third and fourth pharyngeal clefts due to embryo-
genesis defects during 6–8 weeks of foetal life,
causing the thymus and parathyroid development
deﬁciency.
Tetany
and
hypocalcaemia,
both
characteristics
of
hypoparathyroidism,
are
observed in DiGeorge syndrome, in addition to
the defects in T-cell immunity. Defective cell-
mediated immunity (CMI) may increase the
patient’s susceptibility to opportunistic infections
and render the individual vulnerable to a graft-
versus-host
reaction
in
blood
transfusion
recipients.
However,
serum
immunoglobulin
levels are within normal limits, and there is a
normal
immune
response
following
immunisation
with
commonly
employed
immunogens.
Considerable success in treating DiGeorge
syndrome has been achieved with foetal thymic
transplants and the passive administration of thy-
mic humoral factors.
Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis
Some patients with chronic infection of skin and
mucosa with Candida albicans have exhibited a
selective deﬁciency of cell-mediated immunity.
Affected individuals develop severe and wide-
spread forms of candidal infections. There will
be a selective deﬁciency in reactivity to Candida
antigens in skin tests and lowered in vitro prolif-
eration of lymphocytes’ response to C. albicans.
When tested with other antigens and mitogens,
the functions of T-lymphocytes remain normal.
Furthermore, a humoral immune response is
found to be normal for C. albicans. The success
rate with antimycotic agents for symptomatic
therapy is very minimal.
Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (PNP)
Deficiency
This is an autosomal recessive inherited trait
resulting in the deﬁciency of PNP enzymes
responsible for the sequential breakdown of
purines into hypoxanthine and ultimately uric
acid. The patients with PNP deﬁciency show
decreased CMI and recurrent chronic infection.
The usual clinical presentation of these PNP deﬁ-
cient individuals involves hypoplastic anaemia,
candidiasis, diarrhoea and recurrent pneumonia.
The serum’s low uric acid levels due to defected
purine metabolism may be used for diagnostic
purposes. Treatment options are quite less.
Combined Immunodeficiencies
Combined B-cell and T-cell deﬁciencies include
the following conditions.
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)
The condition includes many syndromes with
severe deﬁciency of both humoral and cell-
mediated
immune
responses.
All
these
are
inherited diseases with a defect in the differentia-
tion of early stem cells. These are of two types:
X-linked and autosomal.
X-linked SCID is linked with a defective gene
coding for a polypeptide chain common to most
interleukin receptors like IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-11
and IL-15. It results in a decreased level of IL-2
production and T-cell and B-cell lymphopenia.
After immunogen challenges, there will be a
lack of cellular immunity, delayed-type hypersen-
sitivity and the normal synthesis of antibodies.
Autosomal SCID is due to the mutation in the
gene encoding a tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70,
which plays an important role in signal transduc-
tion in T-cells. Other SCID patients show
mutations in other genes, such as RAG-1 or
RAG-2.
SCID is an infant disease; the affected
individuals die within the initial 2 years of life.
The
infants
develop
a
measles-like
rash

exhibiting
hyperpigmentation
and
develop
severe, repeated infections, mostly pulmonary
infection. These infants exhibit severe suscepti-
bility to Pneumocystis carinii, C. albicans and
other pathogens. The bone marrow graft from
HLA-DR
(Human
Leukocyte
Antigen–DR
isotype) matched siblings can help to normalise
all these forms of SCID. This grafting method is
usually successful; however, there is a higher
chance for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)
development.
252
19
Immunodeficiency Diseases
Graft-Versus-Host
Disease
(GVHD)
is
observed in SCID patients receiving unirradiated
blood transfusions. It can also develop due to the
contamination
of
fresh
blood
with
viable
T-lymphocytes after transfusion. It is usually
followed by fever, splenomegaly, thrombocyto-
penia, Coombs positive haemolytic anaemia,
maculopapular rash in the volar surfaces, diar-
rhoea and protein-losing enteropathy. Poor out-
come is seen in full-blown conditions, and
usually patient dies within 10–14 days after the
onset of symptomatology. This reaction can be
averted with the help of frozen or irradiated blood
products in transfusion. An effort in producing a
bone marrow with only stem cells appears to be a
promising treatment option.
Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked reces-
sive immunodeﬁciency disease of infants. It is
characterised by thrombocytopenia, eczema and
increased IgA and IgE levels. There is decreased
cell-mediated immunity. The inability to mount
an IgM response to the capsular polysaccharide of
bacteria is the most important defect. There will
be an increase in the IgA and IgE levels. On the
other hand, the IgM levels were found to be
lower, although IgG levels remained normal.
The T-cells lack the markedly ﬁmbriated surface
of normal T-cells under electron microscopy. The
defect appears to be caused by the inability of
T-cells to provide help to B-cells. Bone marrow
transplantation corrects the deﬁciency.
Ataxia-Telangiectasia
It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by
gene mutations that encode deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) repair enzymes. This condition is
characterised by ataxia, telangiectasia and recur-
rent infections in babies of 2 years of age. IgA
deﬁciency and lymphopenia commonly occur.
Nezelof Syndrome
Nezlelof syndrome denotes a group of disorders
of various origins, characterised by depressed
CMI and abnormal immunoglobulin synthesis.
In this disorder, patients are susceptible to a
wide range of recurrent microbial infections. Thy-
mic dysplasia occurs with lymphoid depletion
and plasma cells in abundance in the spleen,
lymph node and other parts of the body. Anti-
genic stimuli do not induce antibody production
by B-cells. Haemolytic anaemia is common.
Treatment options are bone marrow transplanta-
tion, transfer factor and thymus transplantation.
Constant antimicrobial therapy is very much
needed to combat recurrent microbial infections.
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
Class II Deficiency
It is an autosomal recessive disease failing to
express MHC molecules on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages
and B-cells. This results in a deﬁciency of CD4
T-cells. The lack of these helper T-cells results in
the production of deﬁcient antibodies.
Immunodeficiency with Thymoma
It is a benign thymic tumour, usually seen in
adults. The condition is associated with impaired
CMI, agammaglobulinemia and also aplastic
anaemia. Surgical removal is the mainstay of
treatment.
Short-Limbed Dwarﬁsm is an autosomal
recessive trait characterised by short-limbed
dwarﬁsm, ectodermal dysplasia, thymic defects
and susceptibility to recurrent infections.
Episodic
lymphopenia
with
lymphocytotoxin is a familial disorder in which
the patient suffers from profound and episodic
depression of T-cell functions. This is due to the
action
of
circulating
complement-dependent
lymphotoxin, which acts as an antilymphocyte
antibody. This leads to a lack of immunological

memory,
abolishing
the
secondary
immune
response
Primary Immunodeficiencies
253
Complement Deficiencies
Most of the complement deﬁciency disorders in
humans are genetic mediated and usually autoso-
mal recessive traits. Complement deﬁciencies
include the following conditions:
Recurrent Infections
This condition is caused by a deﬁciency of C1, C3
or C5, or even C6, C7 or C8 components of the
complement. Patients with C3 deﬁciency are
highly susceptible to S. aureus and other pyo-
genic bacteria infections. Similarly, patients with
C6, C7 or C8 deﬁciency are more susceptible to
bacteraemia with N. meningitidis or Neisseria
gonorrhoeae.
Autoimmune Diseases
Patients
with
deﬁciencies
in
C2
and
C4
components have diseases resembling systemic
lupus
erythematosus
or
other
autoimmune
diseases. Patients with C2 deﬁciency are usually
asymptomatic, and C2 deﬁciency is the most
common complement defect.
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria
It is a disease characterised by haemoglobinuria
during the night when the patient is asleep. The
haemoglobinuria occurs due to complement-
mediated haemolysis, especially at night. This is
because the lower concentration of oxygen in the
blood during sleep increases the susceptibility of
the red blood cells to lysis. This occurs in patients
with a defect in the gene for the molecules that
attach decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and other
proteins to the cell membrane. This results in a
deﬁciency of DAF on the surface of blood cell
precursors, leading to increased activation of
complement and increased haemolysis.

Job’s syndrome
Chemotaxis
Lazy leucocyte syndrome
All phagocytic cell locomotion depressed
Leucocyte G6PD deﬁciency
Deﬁcient G6PD in leucocytes
NADPH: (reduced) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
Hereditary Angioedema
Hereditary angioedema is a disease caused by a
deﬁciency of C1 inhibitor, a component of the
complement.
This
deﬁciency
results
in
an
increased production of vasoactive components,
such as C3a and C5a, which leads to increased
capillary permeability and oedema in the larynx
and several other organs. Steroids (such as
oxymetholone and danazol) are used to treat the
condition because they increase the concentration
of C1 inhibitors, thereby preventing the increased
production of more C3a and C5a.
Phagocyte Deficiencies
Phagocyte deﬁciencies include the following
conditions (Table 19.1).
Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)
It is a disorder inherited in two-thirds of the cases
as an X-linked trait and the remaining as an auto-
somal recessive trait.
The clinical condition is evident prior to the
second year of life and is linked with an enzyme
NADPH—(reduced) nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide
phosphate—oxidase
deﬁciency.
The
deﬁciency of the enzyme causes a reduced intake
of
oxygen
and
glucose
utilisation
in
the
neutrophils and monocytes using the hexose
monophosphate
shunt
pathway.
Though
neutrophils engulf the microorganism by phago-
cytosis, it does not produce superoxide and other
oxygen intermediates, which involve the respira-
tory burst. These conditions combined result in
reduced intracellular removal of bacteria and

fungi.
Hence,
the
individual
with
these
manifestations
shows
high
susceptibility
to
microbial
infection
caused
by
Aspergillus,
Serratia
marcescens
and
Staphylococcus
epidermidis,
which
have
less
virulence
comparatively.
254
19
Immunodeficiency Diseases
Individuals with CGD exhibit pneumonia,
hepatosplenomegaly,
osteomyelitis,
abscesses
and draining lymph nodes. The diagnosis of
CGD is carried out by using the quantitative
nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test and the quanti-
tative killing curve. Therapy includes interferon-
gamma, antibiotics and surgical drainage of
abscesses.
Chediak–Higashi Syndrome
This syndrome is a disorder in children caused by
an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is
detected by the presence of large, stable lyso-
somal granules in leucocytes and the slow
degranulation process. In blood platelets, the
large cytoplasmic granular inclusions exist simi-
lar to their appearance in white blood cells and
can be visualised in peripheral blood smears by
light microscopy. It is identiﬁed by defective
neutrophil chemotaxis mechanism and changes
in the cells’ ability to destroy the ingested
microorganisms.
The
majority
of
affected
individuals die during childhood, although occa-
sional cases may live longer.
There is no effective therapy other than
antibiotics to treat the infecting microorganisms.
High doses of ascorbic acid have been shown to
restore normal chemotaxis, bactericidal activity
and degranulation.
Job Syndrome
Job syndrome is caused by the failure of helper
T-cells to produce interferon- gamma, which
reduces macrophages’ ability to kill bacteria.
This results in an increased production of Th-2
and consequently an increased production of IgE.
All these, in turn, cause more histamine produc-
tion that prevents certain components of inﬂam-
matory
reaction
and
inhibits
chemotaxis.
Therefore, the patient with this syndrome suffers
repeatedly from staphylococcal abscesses and
eczema with a high level of IgE.
Leucocyte Adhesion Deficiency
It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a
mutation in the gene encoding the B-chain of an
integrin that mediates the adhesion of leucocytes
to microbes. This causes poor adhesion of
neutrophils to endothelial surfaces, hence phago-
cytosis of bacteria.
Myeloperoxidase Deficiency
It is a disease associated with the deﬁciency of the
enzyme myeloperoxidase, which is essential for
producing hypochlorite, a microbicidal agent.
The deﬁciency of this enzyme is frequently seen
but has little clinical importance. This is because
other
intracellular
killing
mechanisms
of
leucocytes are intact.
Tuftsin Deficiency
Tuftsin is a tetrapeptide primarily produced in the
spleen. Tuftsin speciﬁcally binds to the receptors
on phagocytic cells and modulates their migra-
tion, and phagocytic and bactericidal activities.
Tuftsin deﬁciency can occur as hereditary or
after splenectomy. Patients with tuftsin deﬁciency
suffer from frequent bacterial infections, espe-
cially by capsulated bacteria.
Lazy Leucocyte Syndrome
It is caused due to the abnormality of leucocyte
function, that is, a deﬁciency of chemotaxis.
These patients are more susceptible to bacterial
infection, with regular stomatitis, gingivitis and
otitis. The patient’s bone marrow shows a normal
number of neutrophils, but neutropenia exists in
peripheral blood. Further, leucocytes exhibit
diminished and slower responses to chemical
and inﬂammatory stimuli.
Hyper-IgE Syndrome
It is a rare syndrome characterised by early onset
of eczema, recurrent bacterial infections such as
staphylococcal skin abscesses, frequent lung
infections, eosinophilia, ten times increased IgE

levels in serum. CMI and humoral responses,
however, are unaltered.
Secondary Immunodeficiencies
255
Shwachman Disease
The condition is mainly due to decreased neutro-
phil mobility, malfunctioning of the pancreas and
abnormalities in the bone. Because of this deﬁ-
ciency, patients suffer from recurrent bacterial
infections.
Actin-Binding Protein Deficiency
In this patient, defective actin-binding protein is
responsible for the slow mobility of leucocytes
and frequent infection.
Secondary Immunodeficiencies
Secondary immunodeﬁciencies occur secondary
to numerous diseases or conditions or as a conse-
quence of therapeutic measures that causes the
immune system depression. Secondary immuno-
deﬁciency
occurs
in
most
immunodeﬁcient
individuals, which are due to either pathological
conditions altering the immune mechanism or the
introduction of therapeutic compounds causing
immunosuppressive effects. By far, the most
common
secondary
immunodeﬁciency
is
acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS),
which results from infection with the human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV).
Secondary immunodeﬁciencies are more com-
mon than primary immunodeﬁciencies and may
be categorised as: (1) humoral deﬁciencies,
(2)
cellular
deﬁciencies,
(3)
complement
deﬁciencies and (4) phagocytic deﬁciencies.
Humoral Deficiencies
Common Variable
Hypogammaglobulinemia
This occurs in persons aged between 13 and
35 years. In this condition, the number of
B-cells is normal, but the ability to produce IgG
and other immunoglobulins is greatly reduced.
The cell-mediated immunity is normal. Patients
with this condition are highly susceptible to
infections
caused
by
S.
pneumoniae,
H. inﬂuenzae and other pyogenic bacteria. The
administration of intravenous gamma globulin
reduces the infections caused by these bacteria.
Malnutrition: In malnutrition, the synthesis of
IgG is reduced due to a low supply of amino
acids. People with malnutrition, hence, are sus-
ceptible to infection by pyogenic bacteria.
Cellular Deficiencies
Acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS):
Patients with AIDS caused by HIV are highly
susceptible to infection by many opportunistic
pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and
parasites. This is attributed to the loss of helper
T-cell activity. The virus speciﬁcally infects and
kills the cells bearing CD4 surface receptors. The
immunity is highly suppressed, and failure of
immune surveillance leads to a high incidence
of tumours. For detail, refer to Chap. 68.
Measles
T-cell function is altered, but immunoglobulins
are normal in patients suffering from measles.
Patients show a temporary suppression of delayed
hypersensitivity.
Complement Deficiencies
Liver Failure
The synthesis of complement proteins is reduced
in chronic hepatitis B or C and liver failure caused
by alcoholic cirrhosis. Hence, these patients are
highly susceptible to infection by pyogenic
bacteria.
Malnutrition
In severe malnutrition, the synthesis of comple-
ment proteins by the liver is reduced due to a low
supply of amino acids. Therefore, people with
malnutrition are susceptible to infection by pyo-
genic bacteria.
Phagocyte Deficiencies
Neutropenia
The condition is characterised by a low neutrophil
count (less than 500 μL1), caused commonly by

cytotoxic drugs, such as those used in cancer
therapy. The patients are susceptible to severe
bacterial infections caused by pyogenic bacteria,
such as S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. Immuno-
deﬁciency diseases have been summarised in

Laboratory Diagnosis
of Immunodeficiency Disorders
Laboratory studies are necessary to arrive at a
diagnosis and the clinical ﬁndings in primary
immunodeﬁciency
disorders.
The
laboratory
tests can be divided into identifying antibody
deﬁciencies, cellular (T-cell) defects, neutrophil
disorders and complement deﬁciencies. Basic
screening with a complete blood count is essential
in all such cases.
Tests for Antibody Deficiency
The screening test includes measuring IgG, IgM
and IgA in the patient’s serum. Speciﬁc antibody
measurement can also be done by the response to

#
#
#
protein or polysaccharide vaccines, and values are
taken before and after vaccine administration. In
addition, a ﬂow cytometry study should be
undertaken to identify and enumerate the number
of B-cells in circulation. Detection of gene defect
is an advanced test where the sequencing of a
gene or whole-genome analysis can conﬁrm a
particular diagnosis.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Immunodeficiency Disorders
257
Tests for Cell-Mediated Immune
Deficiency
The blood count gives a preliminary idea about
these deﬁciencies where we ﬁnd decreased lym-
phocyte count. This can be conﬁrmed by using
ﬂow cytometry using markers speciﬁc for differ-
ent T-cell subsets. Functional assays for T-cell
activity are possible by cell culture studies. The
T-cells are cultured under the inﬂuence of
mitogens like phytohaemagglutinin or antigens
like tetanus toxoid to look for proliferation or by
their ability to produce speciﬁc cytokines like
interferons. Genetic defects can be detected by
mutation analysis following sequencing, which
is highly speciﬁc to diagnose some of the primary
immunodeﬁciency disorders.
Tests for Neutrophil Function
There is normal or elevated neutrophil count in
conditions like chronic granulomatous disease
and leukocyte adhesion deﬁciency. In such
cases, functional testing can be done by a dye
reduction test or the nitro blue tetrazolium test
where the cells are challenged with a bacterium
or candida, and the absence of the oxidative burst
can
be
detected.
Another
test
using
ﬂow
cytometry can measure the oxidative burst of
such
activated
neutrophils
using
the
dye
dihydroergotamine-123. This test is highly sensi-
tive. The diagnosis of leukocyte adhesion deﬁ-
ciency
(LAD)
type
1
also
relies
on
ﬂow
cytometry. However, in all such cases, the most
deﬁnitive
method
of
diagnosis
is
gene
sequencing.
Tests for Complement Defects
The total haemolytic complement assay or CH50
remains the best screening test for complement
deﬁciencies. For defects in the alternative path-
way, AH50 can be done. A negative CH50 or
AH50 assay is an indication of complement
deﬁciency.
A
basic
algorithm
can
be
followed
for
suspected primary immunodeﬁciency disorders,
which can be summarised as follows:
(a)
Basic screening: Blood count and serum IgM, IgG
and IgA levels.
(b)
Flow cytometry analysis: Differentiation of B- and
T-lymphocytes, followed by detection of their subsets.
(c)
Functional testing.
(d)
Mutation analysis by Sanger’s or Whole-genome
sequencing.

Immunology of Transplantation
and Malignancy
20
Successful transplantation requires a multitude of
important steps: surgical asepsis, development of
surgical techniques of vascular anastomosis,
genetic matching of donors with hosts, use of
agents that could suppress the immune system
and prevention of infection in both recipients
and donor. The development of strict antiseptic
techniques contributes immensely to controlling
the infection, while the proper use of immunosup-
pressive drugs and tissue typing increases the
success rate of transplantation.
Transplant Immunology
The transfer of cells, tissues or organs from one
site of one individual to another or in between two
individuals
is
known
as
transplantation.
In
the transplantation between two individuals, the
donor
is
an
individual
who
provides
the
transplanted organ, and the recipient is an indi-
vidual who receives the transplant.
Classification of Transplants
Transplants could be classiﬁed based on many
criteria:
1. Based on the nature of organ or tissue
transplanted—for
example,
kidney,
heart,
skin transplant.

259
2. Based on the anatomical site of origin of the
transplant and the site of its placement, they
can be classiﬁed as (i) Orthotopic: these grafts
are placed in natural positions, for example, in
skin grafts; and (ii) Heterotopic: grafts placed
in abnormal sites, for example, transplantation
of thyroid tissue in a subcutaneous pocket.
3. Based on vitality, it may be of living or dead
materials. These include (i) Vital grafts: live
grafts, such as the kidney or heart, which are
expected to survive and function physiologi-
cally in the recipient; and (ii) Structural or
static grafts: non-living transplants like bone
or artery that merely provide scaffolding on
which new tissue is laid by the recipient.
Types of Transplants/Grafts
There are four different basic types of transplants.
These reﬂect the genetic relationship of the donor
with the recipient. The degree of immune
response to a graft varies with the type of graft
in transplantation (Fig. 20.1).
Autograft: An autograft is the transfer of an
individual’s tissue or organ from one site to
another site in the body. In simpler terms, in this
context, the recipient is also the donor. Examples
of autograft transplants include skin transplants in
burn patients and patients suffering from coro-
nary heart disease who undergo bypass surgery.
Syngraft: A syngraft is a transfer of tissue
between two genetically identical individuals,

that is, identical twins. In 1954, a syngraft, the
ﬁrst successful human kidney transplant, was
performed between identical twins.
260
20
Immunology of Transplantation and Malignancy
Fig. 20.1 Grafts in
transplantation
Allograft: The transfer of an organ or tissue
between genetically diverse members of a similar
species is referred to as an allograft, that is, from
one human to another. This is the predominant
form of transplantation today, and allografts have
dominated transplant research for many years.
Xenograft: A xenograft is the transfer of
tissues or organs between members of different
species. It represents the most disparate genetic
relationships and is always rejected by an immu-
nocompetent recipient.
Transplantation immunology is the study of
the events that occur after an allograft, or a xeno-
graft,
is removed from a donor
and then
transplanted into a recipient.
The Allograft Reaction
Allografts are rejected by a process called allo-
graft reaction. The immune response provoked by
the recipient against the graft due to the incom-
patibility between tissue antigens of the donor
and recipient can be deﬁned as graft rejection.
The problem of rejection was ﬁrst recognised
when attempts to replace damaged skin on burn
patients with skin from unrelated donors were
found to be relatively unsuccessful. During a
period of 1–2 weeks, the skin would undergo
necrosis and peel off. The failure of such grafts
led scientists like Peter Medawar and many others
to study skin transplantation in animal models.
These experiments established that the failure of
skin grafting was caused by an inﬂammatory
reaction, now called rejection. Results of several

experimental studies imply that adaptive immune
response is responsible for rejection.
Transplant Immunology
261
Fig. 20.2 Allograft
rejection. (a) Direct and
indirect allorecognition. (b)
Acute and chronic allograft
rejection mechanisms
Mechanisms of Allograft Rejection
The recognition by the T-cells of a graft recipient
by
allogeneic
MHC
(Major
Incompatibility
Complex)
molecules
can
be
presented
in
two ways: (i) direct presentation and (ii) indirect
presentation (Fig. 20.2).
Direct Presentation
Direct presentation includes the recognition of an
intact
MHC
molecule
displayed
by
donor
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the graft. It
depends on the similarity in the structure of an
intact foreign (allogeneic) molecule and self-
MHC
molecules.
As
many
as
2%
of
an
individual’s T-cells can recognise and respond
to a single foreign MHC molecule, and this high
frequency of T-cells reactive with allogeneic
MHC molecules is one reason that allografts elicit
strong immune responses in vivo.
Indirect Presentation
The “indirect presentation” involves the recogni-
tion of processed allogeneic MHC molecules but
not an intact MHC molecule. The indirect presen-
tation may result in recognition by CD4+ T-cells
itself. This is due to the antigen initially acquired
by the endosomal vesicular pathway and presented
by class II MHC molecules. Few antigens of graft
cells that are phagocytosed tend to access the class
I MHC pathway of antigen presentation, indirectly
recognised by CD8+ T-cells.
Stages of Graft Rejection
Graft
rejection
might
occur
either
in
the
sensitisation phase or in the effector mechanisms
phase.
The Phase of Sensitisation
In this phase, lymphocytes of the recipient, which
are antigen-reactive, multiply in the presence of
alloantigens on the graft. During this phase,
CD4+
and
CD8+
T-cells
detect
antigens
expressed on the foreign graft cells and multiply.
The proliferating CD4+ T-cell is the major cell
that can directly identify class II alloantigens or
hosts APCs presenting alloantigen peptides. The
proliferated population of activated Th cells plays
an important role in provoking the different effec-
tor mechanisms involving allograft rejection.
The Phase of Effector Mechanisms
Destruction of the graft by the immune cells
occurs in this phase. Many effector mechanisms
are
involved
in
allograft
rejection.
The
commonest are cell-mediated reactions involving
delayed-type
hypersensitivity
and
cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity. The
least
common
mechanisms
involved
are
antibodies with complement lysis and destruction
through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto-
toxicity (ADCC).
An inﬂux of T-cells and macrophages into the
graft is the hallmark of graft rejection involving
cell-mediated reactions. Histologically, the inﬁl-
tration in many cases resembles that seen during a
delayed-type hypersensitive response, in which

cytokines produced by TH cells promote macro-
phage inﬁltration.

Clinical Features of Graft Rejection
Based primarily on time elapsed between trans-
plantation and the rejection episode, rejection
episodes
are
classiﬁed
as
(i)
hyperacute,
(ii) acute and (iii) chronic rejections.
Hyperacute Rejection
Hyperacute rejection usually occurs within the
ﬁrst
few
hours
post-transplantation
and
is
mediated by preformed antibodies against ABO
or MHC antigens of the graft. The key role in this
rejection can be due to the antibodies directed
against other alloantigens, such as vascular endo-
thelial antigens. If the antibodies bind to the
tissues that are transplanted, rejection can be due
to either (i) by complement system activation,
which
results
in
chemotactic
migration
of
granulocytes and turning on the inﬂammatory
cascades, or (ii) by ADCC.
Acute Rejection
Acute rejection occurs mostly in the ﬁrst few days
or weeks after transplantation. When acute rejec-
tion occurs in the ﬁrst few days after grafting, it
may imply a secondary immune response (sec-
ond-set response). This signiﬁes that the patient
was earlier sensitised to the human leukocyte
antigens (HLAs) already present in the organ
donor (this may be due to an earlier transplant,
pregnancy or blood transfusions). When graft
rejection occurs in the ﬁrst week after grafting, it
usually refers to a ﬁrst-set primary immune
response (ﬁrst-set response). About 70% of
graft recipient patients account for one or more
rejection episodes.
T-lymphocytes predominantly mediate acute
rejection.
CD4+
helper
T-lymphocytes
are
believed to play a key role in acute rejection of
the graft. In a rejected organ, the cellular
inﬁltrates
usually
contain
a
majority
of
monocytes and T-lymphocytes of either helper
or cytotoxic phenotypes, and to a lesser extent
of B-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells,
eosinophils and neutrophils. All these cells can
play an important role in the process of rejection.
The initial diagnosis of acute rejection is usu-
ally implied to suspicion clinically. Deteriorating
of the functional capacity of the grafted organ acts
as the main basis for the suspicion of the diagno-
sis of acute rejection. The biopsy of the grafted
organ is a basic requirement for conﬁrmation.
Mononuclear cell inﬁltration in tissues of rejected
grafts is a characteristic ﬁnding. The measure-
ment of cytokines (such as interleukin [IL]-2) in
serum and urine (in the case of renal transplants)
is another diagnostic approach. In most cases, if
detected early, acute rejection can be reversed by
increasing the dose of immunosuppressive agents
or
by
brieﬂy
administering
additional
immunosuppressants.
Delayed or Chronic Rejection
This is characterised by an insidiously progres-
sive loss of function of the grafted organ. The
functional deterioration associated with chronic
rejection appears to be due to both immune and
non-immune
processes.
Vascular
endothelial
injury is the most common feature. Granulocytes,
monocytes and platelets are found to increasingly
adhere to injured vascular endothelium. The dam-
aged endothelium is usually enveloped by a layer
of platelets and ﬁbrin, which helps in the multi-
plication of ﬁbroblasts and smooth muscle cells.
It eventually leads to enlarging of lesions in the
blood vessels, which advances towards ﬁbrosis
and occlusion.
The greater the agreement between donor and
recipient, the more likely the transplant will sur-
vive. For instance, when a six-antigen match
involves the allocation of two HLA-A antigens,
two HLA-B antigens and two HLA-DR antigens
among donor and recipient. Although antigeni-
cally different grafts may persist, while a strong
immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclosporine,
has been used, the persistence of the graft can be
still enhanced by having as many antigenic
matches feasible.
Histocompatibility Antigens
The recipient tissue does not possess antigens that
are present on the grafted tissue. Hence, host

tissue mounts an immune response against the
transplant. If the antigens present on the grafted
tissue are similar to that of the recipient, then
there will not be any immune response even
though donor and recipient are not syngeneic,
which results in successful transplantation. The
two parent strains with genotypes AA and BB
upon
breading
produce
ﬁrst-generation
(F1)
hybrid AB. The F1 hybrid comprises representa-
tive antigens from both the parents, and hence, F1
hybrids can accept grafts from either of the
parents. However, transplantation in the reverse
direction from F1 hybrid to parents will not be
successful because parent strain AA reacts with
antigen B of the F1 hybrid, and parent strain BB
reacts with antigen A of F1 hybrid.
Transplant Immunology
263
Eichwald–Silmser effect: Most of the time,
the transplants between the members of highly
inbred animals are found to be successful, but
the grafts are rejected only when the donor is
male and the recipient is female. The reason for
the
rejection
is,
grafted
male
tissue
(XY)
possesses
Y
chromosome
determined
antigens, which are absent in the female recipient
tissue (XX). However, a male can receive graft
successfully from a female. This kind of unilateral
sex-linked
histocompatibility
is
called
the
Eichwald–Silmser effect.
The
transplantation
or
histocompatibility
antigens are cell-surface glycoproteins expressed
on nucleated cells participating in the graft rejec-
tion process. The system of cell antigens that
plays a vital role in allograft transplantation is
called the “major histocompatibility system”.
The major histocompatibility system of humans
is called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
system.
Histocompatibility Testing
Blood Group Analysis
Basic ABO blood grouping determines the pres-
ence or absence of antigens on donor red blood
cells (RBCs) and the presence or absence of spe-
ciﬁc antibodies to the same antigens in the
recipient’s serum or blood cells. Transplantation
with ABO-incompatible graft results ends up with
rejection.
HLA Compatibility Test
HLA is a protein (or marker) located on the sur-
face of white blood cells and other tissues in the
body, and its compatibility with a donor is a
foremost important factor for the survival of allo-
graft. The best transplant outcome depends upon
the close match between the patient’s HLA and
the donor’s HLA. HLA
typing
and tissue
matching are used to test HLA compatibility.
HLA Typing Methods
HLA typing is not the same as ABO blood typing.
HLA typing is performed in laboratories by
separating blood into components such as red
blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and
plasma or serum. HLA typing is performed on
the white blood cells known as lymphocytes.
Microlympho-Cytotoxicity Test
In this test, puriﬁed lymphocyte suspensions from
donor and recipient are added to microwells
containing a standard panel of typing antisera
(containing monoclonal antibodies), complement
and trypan blue stain. Cells carrying antigens
corresponding to the HLA antiserum are killed
by complement-mediated membrane damage.
These cells can be detected using vital stains
such as eosin or trypan blue. Cell death indicates
that the test cells (recipient and donor cells) pos-
sess the antigens being tested for, namely
HLA-A,
HLA-B
and
HLA-DR
antigens.
Although this method of HLA typing is prelimi-
nary, it does not provide direct information about
sequence variation in alleles.
Molecular Methods
Molecular methods are highly speciﬁc and help
distinguish subtle variations in the HLA genes. In
this method, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is
ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using sequence-speciﬁc primers and digested
with a speciﬁc restriction enzyme (a technique
called PCR-RFLP or polymerase chain reaction-
restriction fragment length polymorphism) to
generate a speciﬁc restriction pattern. Alleles are
identiﬁed according to the pattern.

264
20
Immunology of Transplantation and Malignancy
Tissue Matching or Tissue Typing
It is a procedure in which the tissues of a prospec-
tive donor and recipient are tested for compatibil-
ity prior to transplantation. This is done by the
functional assay called mixed lymphocyte reac-
tion or culture (MLR or MLC). This assay
measures
the
proliferative
response
of
lymphocytes on exposure to HLA-incompatible
antigens
from
one
individual
(recipient)
to
lymphocytes from another individual (donor).
The
intensity
of
the
reaction
(proliferative
response) is a measure of the antigenic disparity
between the donor and recipient lymphocytes.
This
is
a
one-way
test
in
which
donor
lymphocytes
are
killed,
and
only
recipient
lymphocytes are permitted to be transformed in
response to the incompatible antigens on the
donor cells. The MLR can be executed on
lymphocytes from the alike individuals (AUTO-
MLR), from dissimilar individuals of the same
species
(ALLO-MLR)
or
individuals
from
diverse species (XENO-MLR).
Prevention of Graft Rejection
Immunosuppression of the host prevents graft
rejection (Table 20.1). It is achieved by treatment
with
radiation,
corticosteroids
and
antilymphocyte
serum.
Cyclosporin
A
and
rapamycin are also used, which cause immuno-
suppression by speciﬁc inhibition of T-cells.

Graft-Versus-Host (GVH) Reaction
When a patient with a known immunodeﬁciency
disease such as primary, secondary or iatrogenic
acquires a graft of an organ rich in immunocom-
petent cells, there is a reasonable risk in which a
graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction can be evoked.
This is in contrast to graft rejection due to the
reaction of the host to the grafted tissue (host-
versus-graft response).
The GVH reactions occur when the following
conditions are present: (i) the donor graft must
contain immunocompetent T-cells, (ii) the host
must be immunocompromised and must not reject
the graft, and (iii) the recipient should express
transplant antigens, such as MHC proteins,
which are absent in the graft.
GVH reactions are a signiﬁcant problem in
transplantation of (i) bone marrow or thymus in
infants and children with primary immunodeﬁ-
ciencies, (ii) bone marrow in adults and (iii)
small bowel, lung and even liver—the organs
that have a substantial amount of lymphoid
tissues, and reactions occur because the donor
T-lymphocytes become activated, proliferate and
differentiate into helper and effector cells in the
irradiated,
immunocompromised
host.
These
activated T-cells attack the host cells and tissues,
producing the signs and symptoms of GVH dis-
ease. The donor’s cytotoxic T-cells play a key
role in destroying the recipient’s cells. The crucial
role of the donor T-cells is demonstrated by the
fact that removing these T-cells from a bone
marrow graft prevents GVH reactions.

A
Immunology of Malignancy
265
Transplantation of organs such as the heart and
kidneys—poor
in
endogenous
lymphoid
tissues—rarely results in a GVH reaction.
All the known immunosuppressive drugs
utilised in the prevention and treatment of rejec-
tion have also been used to treat the GVH reac-
tion. The tranquiliser drug such as thalidomide
was known for its teratogenic effects and has been
successfully used in treating chronic GVH non-
responder to conventional immunosuppressants.
Privileged Sites
In the human body, there are anatomical regions
that are minimally exposed to the immune sys-
tem, and even foreign antigens entering these
regions are protected and do not elicit any
immune response. These areas include the brain
and central nervous system (CNS), the eyes and
the testes. It seems to be nature’s mechanism to
protect these highly vulnerable tissues from the
collateral damage, which is part of any immune
response in the body. Previously, it was thought
that the self-tolerance at these sites is due to the
physical barrier that blocks lymphocytes’ entry
and other immune cells. However, cell-tracking
studies have shown a constant turnover of bone-
marrow-derived cells to the brain and retina, and
circulating T-cells can enter the CNS tissues
before the onset of autoimmune diseases. The
previous idea about the absence of lymphatics
and antigen-presenting cells at these sites has
also been disproved by the fact that the CNS
(not the brain parenchyma) has got lymphatic
drainage system and by the presence of antigen-
presenting cells in the retina.
According to recent studies, it has been pro-
posed that Fas death receptors are responsible for
immune evasion at the privilege sites. FasL is
expressed by very few cells, including the cells
lining the inner chambers of the eyes and Sertoli
cells in the testes. FasL interacts with Fas on
activated T-cells and causes apoptosis of these
T-cells before they can differentiate into effector
cells and can attack the tissues. In addition to that,
immunosuppressive cytokines and regulatory
T-cells also have some role to play in immune
privilege.
Immunology of Malignancy
Tumour immunology has been deﬁned as part of
immunology that deals with the antigens on
tumour cells and the immune response to them.
Tumour cells express developmental antigens that
are usually seen only in the prenatal period due to
their loss of differentiation. The alpha-fetoprotein
and carcinoembryonic antigen are examples of
such antigens. Tumours or neoplasia are said to
develop when the balance between cell death and
renewal is disturbed such that numerous clones of
a single cell group are produced in an uncon-
trolled fashion.
A tumour that is not capable of indeﬁnite
growth
and
does
not
invade
the
healthy
surrounding tissue extensively is benign.
tumour that continues to grow and becomes pro-
gressively invasive is malignant; the term cancer
refers speciﬁcally to a malignant tumour. In addi-
tion to uncontrolled growth, malignant tumours
exhibit metastasis. In this process, a small group
of cancerous cells move from a tumour, attack the
blood or lymphatic vessels and drift to other
tissues, where they continue to multiply. By this
process, a primary tumour at one site advances to
a secondary tumour at another site.
Medical Evidence of Immune Response
in Malignancy
Many clinical observations show the immune
system response in preventing, arresting and
rarely curing malignancies.
Spontaneous Regression
In neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma cases,
it has been reported that, in rare instances, there is
a chance of spontaneous regression of full-blown
tumours. The reasons for the spontaneous regres-
sion of tumours could be an analogy of the
immune response occurring during infections.
Chemotherapy
In rare cases, chemotherapy to choriocarcinoma
and Burkitt lymphoma patients may lead to

o
dramatic recovery and cure. At times, a single
dose may result in a complete cure. Interestingly,
in a few cancer types, including hypernephroma
with pulmonary metastases, surgical removal of
primary cancer often slows down the metastases.
The reason could be that removing a large mass of
cancer cells facilitates the immune system to act
effectively on the remaining cancer cells and
regress metastases. Usually, the immune response
is more effective if the tumour size is below the
critical mass.
266
20
Immunology of Transplantation and Malignancy
Overcoming Defence Mechanisms
During an autopsy, certain cancers are unexpect-
edly observed without their clinical prevalence.
This indicates the suppression of the growth of
malignant cells by the host immune system, but
some of them are successful in overcoming the
defence mechanisms to develop into clinical
cancers.
Cellular Response
The presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
macrophages inﬁltrating tumours provides evi-
dence of immune response against malignancy.
Tumours with such indications of cellular ﬁltra-
tion have a better disease prognosis than those
without them.
Immunodeficiency States
The immune system plays a natural role in
preventing tumour formation. That indicates that
if the immune system of an individual is deﬁcient,
he/she should be more prone to cancer. For exam-
ple, the high prevalence of cancer, particularly
lymphoreticular malignancies, can be seen in
conditions such as congenital immunodeﬁciency
states,
acquired
immunodeﬁciency
syndrome
(AIDS) and individuals going through immuno-
suppressive therapy.
Features of Malignant Cells
Malignant cells exhibit many features: (i) once
cells become malignant, they stop functioning
normally and add to the burden on the body by
competing with the normal cells for space and
nutrition, (ii) the more “undifferentiated” a cell
is, the lesser its functionality and more its malig-
nant nature, (iii) they undergo rapid and uncon-
trolled division and (iv) they lose their homing
instinct and start invading the basement mem-
brane and enter the vasculature to spread to dis-
similar tissues, leading to metastasis and spread
of cancer.
It has been postulated that the immune system
is partly responsible for protecting the body
against the development of malignancies. At the
same time, the prevalence of numerous cancers in
immunocompetent individuals indicates that the
immune system has only a partial role in
protecting against malignancies and is not very
efﬁcient at it.
Tumour Antigens
Tumour cells also express unique molecules that
can be classiﬁed into two groups as follows:
Tumour-Specific Antigens
Tumour-speciﬁc antigens, also called tumour-
speciﬁc transplantation antigens (TSTAs), are
unique to tumours. They are not found in other
cells of the body. They are usually the products of
mutated genes seen in cancer cells. Cytosolic
processing of the abnormal proteins yields unique
peptides and, when presented by the appropriate
MHC class I molecules, elicits a cell-mediated
immune response.
Various physical and chemical carcinogens
cause malignancies by inducing mutation in key
genes that modulate cell growth. Ras’s proto-
oncogene
products,
including
the
p21Ras
proteins and other related gene products, are an
example of TSTA. These Ras proteins afﬁx t
guanine nucleotides such as GTP (Guanosine tri-
phosphate) and GDP (Guanosine diphosphate),
which exhibit intrinsic GTPase activity. Some
mutations are associated with Ras’s genes in
malignant cells. They turn out to end in single
amino acid substitutions at speciﬁc positions such
as 12, 13 or 61, which produces elevated enzy-
matic activity of the related gene product. As a
result, these cells achieve transforming capacity.
Moreover, these products are also recognised as
foreign antigens by the cellular immune response.

Immunology of Malignancy
267
Another mode through which the tumour cells
may express unique and novel antigens is by
integrating with proviral genomes. These virus-
induced tumours usually have their genome
integrated with the proviral genome; hence the
proteins encoded and expressed are sometimes
novel and recognised by the cellular immune
response. Viruses that have been implicated in
tumorigenesis
include
Epstein–Barr
virus
(EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C
virus (HCV).
Tumour-Associated Transplantation Antigens
(TATAs)
Tumour-associated
transplantation
antigens
(TATAs) are the other class of tumour antigens.
These antigens are expressed by (i) tumour cells
and also by (ii) normal cells at low levels or only
during the process of differentiation. The expres-
sion of these antigens is considerably depressed
or enhanced after malignant transformation. They
can be of the following types:
1. Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens:
They represent an abnormal form of mucin-
associated antigen detected in breast and pan-
creatic cancers.
2. Differential antigens: These include CD10
and prostate-speciﬁc antigens (PSAs). The lat-
ter is used as a diagnostic indicator in prostatic
cancer.
3. Oncofetal antigens: These antigens are found
in embryonic and malignant cells but are
absent in normal adult cells. Alpha-fetoprotein
and carcinoembryonic antigens are examples
of this antigen found in hepatomas and colonic
cancers, respectively. Silent tumour-associated
genes are not expressed in normal cells but are
actively transcribed in tumour cells. The
tissue-speciﬁc genes or differentiation genes
are usually seen on the surface of normal
cells, or they may shed to the circulation;
however, in normal cells, their usual levels of
expression are very low. This ﬁnds practical
application in the diagnosis of malignancies,
as illustrated by the PSA assay for prostate
carcinoma diagnosis.
4. Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA): PSA is a
kallikrein-like serine protease formed solely
from the epithelial cells in the prostate gland.
This antigen is measurable at comparatively
higher levels in seminal plasma and very low
levels in the serum of healthy men. The evalu-
ation of serum PSA levels proves to be a very
helpful marker in diagnosing prostate carci-
noma. It is also conﬁrmed to be the most
purposeful serum marker for neoplasia. In
healthy men, at the age group of 21–30, the
levels of PSA range between 0.65 and 0.66 ng/
mL, and at the age group 61–70, between 1.15
and 0.68 ng/mL. Considerably, the increased
levels of PSA can be demonstrated in patients
(63–86%) with prostatic carcinoma, and it
directly corresponds to the stage of carcinoma.
In
essence,
tumour
antigens
capable
of
stimulating an immune reaction may be one of
the different types. First, these antigens are
uniquely expressed by tumour cells alone. Also,
there are the products of genes that have been
mutated during the transformation process, lead-
ing to the expression of abnormal products. Sec-
ond, certain antigens expressed by tumours are
present only when normal cells are undergoing
the process of differentiation, and these are also
readily
recognised
by
the
immune
system.
Finally, the over-expressed antigens by the
tumour cells elicit a good immune response.
Immune Reactions against Tumours
Tumour antigens can elicit a comprehensive
immune response involving both the cellular and
humoral immune responses.
Cellular Immune Responses
T-lymphocytes play an important role in tumour
immunity. They act both as cytotoxic effector
cells and as central modulating cells. Through
these effector cells, they control the speciﬁc cell-
mediated antitumour immune responses and
upregulate non-speciﬁc killing mechanisms. The
T-lymphocytes’
activation
by
tumour
cell
substances results in antigen recognition, which
leads to the secretion of non-speciﬁc immunoreg-
ulatory factors. These factors can upregulate the
tumour-killing function of monocytes, leukocytes

and products. Second, these enhance the ability of
NK cells and monocytes to participate in ADCC
against tumour cells. Macrophages also play an
important role in tumour response. Clustering of
macrophages around tumour cells is associated
with tumour regression and is seen in the case of
numerous cancers.
268
20
Immunology of Transplantation and Malignancy
Humoral Immune Responses
B-lymphocytes
produce
tumour-speciﬁc
antibodies,
which
may
induce
complement-
dependent cytotoxicity of tumour cells or may
mediate ADCC. ADCC can be mediated by vari-
ous cells expressing Fc7 receptors (NK cells,
monocytes or macrophages and granulocytes) by
recognising and destroying IgG-coated tumour
cells.
Immunosurveillance
The formation of cancer cells within our body is a
usual phenomenon. Trillions of normal cells pres-
ent in the body, thousands in a day, would be
subjected to malignant degeneration in response
to the carcinogenic stimuli. Our immune system
plays an important role in stopping the growth of
these cancerous cells and halting the development
of deﬁnite malignancy.
Ehrlich initially put forward the concept of
surveillance in immune response, and later on, it
was modiﬁed by Thomas and Burnet. Ehrlich ﬁrst
suggested that though cancer cells frequently
arise in the body, they are recognised as foreign
and eliminated. Later, Burnet postulated the sur-
veillance in immune response theory. He pro-
posed
that
the
immune
system
usually
be
vigilant over the cells in our body. Additionally,
he suggested that on recognising a cell or a cluster
of cells that have become cancerous, efforts will
be taken to destroy them, hence inhibiting the
growth of the tumour.
Mechanisms
Immunological surveillance is very important to
check cancer cell growth and proliferation.
Immunological surveillance mechanisms mainly
work based on the following:
1. The ability of the immune system to recognise
and target the cells (cancerous) that express
antigens that are not found on normal cells.
Failure of this would lead to an increased
incidence
of
cancer.
For
instance,
cells
infected with the following oncogenic viruses
express different antigens from normal cells.
Oncogenic viruses such as human papilloma-
virus pose a risk factor for cervical cancer,
Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by the virus
KSHV (Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes-
virus),
Burkitt
lymphoma
is
caused
by
Epstein–Barr virus and hepatitis B develops
to liver cancer.
2. A few gene products of the host are over-
expressed or under-expressed in cancer cells.
For example, a protein named NY-ESO1 is
over-expressed
in
tumour
cells
(e.g. melanoma, and lung and breast cancers),
but it is not being expressed by normal cells.
Another
example
is
increased
HER2
–
“Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor
2” – a growth factor receptor found on some
kind of tumour cells (some breast cancers,
lymphomas).
Despite the surveillance mechanisms men-
tioned above, if there is the development of a
tumour, then it represents a lapse in surveillance.
This failure may be linked to the very quick rate
of proliferation of cancer cells, low immunoge-
nicity of tumour antigens or the production of
certain cytokines like transforming growth fac-
tor-β
(TGF-β)
that
suppresses
cell-mediated
immunity (CMI). Tumour cells often express
low class I MHC molecules to escape from the
destruction caused by CD8+ CTLs (cytotoxic
lymphocytes).
Immunotherapy of Cancer
Immunotherapy
of
cancer
involves
various
approaches, as mentioned in the subsequent
sections.
Non-Specific Active Immunotherapy
This includes treatment with various non-speciﬁc
immune modulators. Bacillus Calmette–Guerin
(BCG) vaccine has been shown to possess
antitumour activity. When injected directly into

certain solid tumours, the vaccine may cause
regression of the tumour. The antitumour effect
is believed to be due to the activation of
macrophages and NK cells. The BCG therapy
has been reported to be beneﬁcial in treating
bladder cancer, malignant melanomas, stage I
lung cancer and certain leukaemias. Corynebac-
terium
parvum
also
possesses
antitumour
activities. Its antitumour effect is due to its ability
to stimulate macrophages and B-cells. It shows a
synergistic effect when used in conjunction with
cyclophosphamide. It is useful in the treatment of
metastatic breast cancer and various types of lung
cancer.
Immunology of Malignancy
269
Other
non-speciﬁc
immunomodulators
include:
(1)
dinitrochlorobenzene
(DNCB),
evaluated in squamous and basal carcinoma,
(2) levamisole for stimulating CMI and macro-
phage function, (3) interferon to stimulate NK
cell function, (4) cytokine IL-2 to stimulate kill-
ing of cancer cells by cytotoxic T-cells, (5) NK
cells, macrophages and thymic hormones to
restore T-cell function and (6) tuftsin to stimulate
phagocytic cells.
Antigen-Specific Therapy
Antigen-speciﬁc therapy includes (i) vaccination
with tumour antigen, (ii) treatment with transfer
factor, (iii) treatment with immune ribonucleic
acid (RNA), (iv) treatment with monoclonal
antibodies
raised
against
tumour-associated
antigens (TAAs) given alone or in conjunction
with the cytotoxic drug and (v) modiﬁcation of
tumour
antigenicity
by
treatment
with
neuraminidase.
Passive Immunotherapy
Passive immunotherapy is the earliest method of
special therapy comprising antibodies or other
immune system components made in vitro and
administered to patients to provide immunity
against the growing tumour and neutralise the
circulating tumour antigens. However, passive
immunotherapies do not stimulate a patient’s
immune
system
the
way
vaccines
do. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy is the
most widely used cancer immunotherapy today
among passive immunotherapies. Monoclonal
antibodies target and bind only to cancer cell-
surface speciﬁc antigens.
Adoptive Immunotherapy
Adoptive
immunotherapy
is
a
promising
approach for the treatment of cancer. This immu-
notherapy is based on the infusion of naturally
occurring
lymphocytes
or
gene-engineered
T-cells, which could mediate tumour regression
in patients with metastatic cancer. However, the
primary challenge in this adoptive immunother-
apy is to identify tumour-speciﬁc targets to avoid
off-tumour, on-target toxicity and, additionally,
this immunotherapy might be ineffective if there
is a large mass of tumour cells.
Immunomodulation
It is deﬁned as the stimulation or suppression of
the immune system with the help of drugs or
biological agents to ﬁght against cancer, infection
or other diseases, and such agents are termed
immunomodulators. Stimulation or augmentation
of the immune response is useful in the therapy of
immunodeﬁciency
to
ﬁght
infections
and
malignancies. On the other hand, weakening or
suppressing the immune system is desirable in
autoimmune disorders and organ transplantations.
The agents that help augment the immune
response
include
cytokines
(IL-2
and
α-interferon), IL-11, erythropoietin granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF). BCG vaccine boosts cell-mediated
immunity and is used in the therapy of bladder
cancers. Drugs like thalidomide, lenalidomide
and pomalidomide cause release of IL-2 and are
used in malignancies.
The agents that can blunt the immune response
can act at various targets. Some of them interfere
with
antigen
presentation
(anti-CD
154, CTLA4-Ig), while others can interfere with
T-cell activation (calcineurin inhibitors, including
cyclosporine A and tacrolimus) or T-cell prolifer-
ation
(sirolimus,
mycophenolate
mofetil,
leﬂunomide). These agents ﬁnd their main use in
preventing organ rejection after transplantation.

Immunohaematology
and Immunoprophylaxis
21
Immunohaematology is the study of blood group
antigens and antibodies and their interactions in
health and disease. Immunoprophylaxis is the
prevention of disease either by active or passive
immunity.
Immunohematology
Ehrlich and Morgenroth ﬁrst described blood
groups in goats based on antigens of their red
cells in an article published in the Berliner
klinische Wochenschrift in 1900. Subsequently,
Karl Landsteiner, a Viennese pathologist, suc-
cessfully identiﬁed the human ABO blood groups
for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
30 years later. After this initial discovery, blood
grouping was developed as a science, and many
different systems of grouping were designed
based on many isoantigens on the surface of
erythrocytes. The ABO and Rh blood systems
are among the well-known human blood groups
described in the literature.
ABO Blood Group System
ABO blood group system was the ﬁrst human red
cell antigen system to be characterised. The ABO
blood group substances are glycopeptides with
oligosaccharide side chains (Fig. 21.1).
The ABO system contains four blood groups,
and
the
blood
group
of
an
individual
is
determined by the presence or absence of two
distinct antigens, A and B, on the surface of the
red cell membrane. Red cells of blood group A
carry antigen A, cells of blood group B carry
antigen B and cells of blood group AB have
both A and B antigens (Table 21.1). On the
other hand, blood group O cells have neither A
nor B antigens. Four blood groups are also
differentiated by the presence or absence of two
distinct isoantibodies in the serum. Serum of
blood group A individuals have anti-B antibodies,
blood group B have anti-A antibodies and blood
group O have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.
The blood group AB does not contain any anti-A
and anti-B antibodies in the serum.

The frequency of ABO blood groups differs
across the world. The most prevalent blood group
is O, and less abundantly seen is AB. In the Indian
context, the highest to the lowest distribution of
blood group is as follows: O (40%), B (33%), A
(22%) and AB (5%). The naturally occurring IgM
anti-A and anti-B are identiﬁed in the serum in the
absence of the corresponding red cell antigen in
the ABO blood group system. Even though
alloantibodies are described as naturally occur-
ring, the antibodies anti-A and anti-B are not
measurable in the blood of newborn infants.
These antibodies are detectable at about 3 months
of age. Even when the person gets older, the
naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies’
concentration in the blood becomes less detect-
able, and hence in the serum of some elderly
patients,
these
antibodies
are
undetectable.

Naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies
are IgM in nature and react optimally between
4 and 18 C. However, these saline agglutinating
antibodies
are
less
reactive
at
37
C.
ABO-incompatible
pregnancy
or
transfusion
may lead to the production of immune antibodies,
which are IgG molecules capable of agglutinating
albumin
and
reacting
optimally
at
37
C.
Isoantibodies in the presence of complement act
as haemolysins, and these antibodies are clinically
more signiﬁcant than natural antibodies because of
their involvement in severe transfusion reactions.

H Antigen
Red cells of all ABO groups possess a common
antigen, the H antigen, or H substance. H antigen
is a glycoprotein and structurally is an l-fucose. It
is a precursor for the production of A and B
antigens. A and B antigens are formed by adding
N-acetylgalactosamine
and galactose,
respec-
tively, to l-fucose of H antigen.
Due to its universal distribution, the H antigen
is not that important in blood grouping or transfu-
sion. However, in rare instances, such as in
“Bombay”, or OH blood, both A and B antigens

and
H
antigens
are
absent
in
the
blood.
Individuals with the “Bombay” blood group
have anti-A, anti-B and anti-H antibodies, hence
are not compatible with most of the red cells.
Immunohematology
273
RH Blood Group System
In 1939, Philip Levine discovered that most
women who gave birth to newborns with a
haemolytic disease whose sera contained an anti-
body that reacted with the infant red cells, most
(85%) of them were Caucasians. Landsteiner and
Wiener, in 1940, infused blood into rabbits and
guinea pigs from the monkey Macacus rhesus;
this led to the discovery that the antibody that
agglutinated rhesus (Rh) red cells points to have
a similar speciﬁcity as compared to the neonatal
antibody. Donors whose cells showed agglutina-
tion with the antibody to Rh red cells have an
Rh-positive blood group, while those donors
whose cells were not showing agglutination
have an Rh-negative blood group. A recent dis-
covery reveals that the antibody discovered by
Landsteiner and Wiener shows reaction with an
antigen (LW), which is distinct but is similar to
the one that is detected in haemolytic disease,
even though the Rh nomenclature remains.
Rh Blood Group Antigens
Rh blood group system refers to the ﬁve major Rh
antigens, namely C, c, D, E and e, and there are
many other less frequent Rh antigens present. Of
all the known Rh antigens, RhD, antigen D is
most signiﬁcant. The individuals usually either
have or do not have the antigen D, which is
present on the surface of the red blood cells
(RBCs). These individuals are usually termed as
“RhD-positive” (who have RhD antigen) or
“RhD-negative” (who do not have antigen) fol-
lowing their ABO blood type. There are several
alloantigenic determinants within the Rh system.
Rh Typing
The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system is next in
importance to the ABO system in blood transfu-
sion practice, but it is not of equal signiﬁcance in
every country because the frequency of the most
important Rhesus antigens, i.e. antigen D, varies
in different populations. Clinically, the antigen D
has a lot of medical importance. This is because
RhD-negative
individuals
who
receive
RhD-positive erythrocytes by transfusion can
develop alloantibodies that may cause haemolytic
reactions, called Rh incompatibility reactions. A
person is grouped as Rhesus (Rh) positive or
negative based on the presence or absence of
antigen D (Rho) on red cells and hence can be
accomplished by testing with anti-D (anti-Rh
factor)
serum.
The
distribution
of
the
Rh-positives varies across the globe and between
the races. Indians show 93% Rh positivity and the
remaining
7%
are
Rh-negative,
whereas
European descendants carry 85% Rh antigen.
Du antigen is a variant of antigen D, and
individuals belonging to Du subtypes react to
some but not all anti-D sera. Du subtypes that
are not capable of reacting with anti-D sera
would
have
the
ability
to
absorb
anti-D
antibodies. Du subtype detection of an individual
can be done by direct Coombs test, in which the
Du subtype RBCs treated with anti-D sera is used.
In blood donation, Du subtype individuals are
regarded as Rh-positive. However, during blood
transfusion to Du individuals, Rh-negative blood
transfusion
is
recommended
to
avoid
the
complications that might develop due to prior
sensitisation of that individual with Rh-positive
blood.
Antigen
D
even
creates
a
problem
in
RhD-negative mothers bearing a child with
RhD-positive red cells obtained from the father.
An entry of foetal erythrocytes into the maternal
circulation at either parturition or trauma caused
during the pregnancy, such as in amniocentesis,
will ultimately lead to alloimmunisation recorded
against the RhD antigen. This may continue to
cause haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)
in future pregnancies. This now can be prevented
by administering the Rh (D) immunoglobulin to
the women within 72 h of delivery.
Unlike the ABO system, there are no natural
antibodies
against
Rh
antigens.
Antibodies
against Rh antigens develop only in certain
situations, such as Rh-incompatible pregnancy
or transfusion. Most of these antibodies are IgG
antibodies and a few IgM antibodies. These are
incomplete antibodies and can be detected in

newborn blood by direct Coombs test and in
mother blood by indirect Coombs test.
274
21
Immunohaematology and Immunoprophylaxis
According to the International Society for
Blood Transfusion, more than 30 human blood
grouping systems are present, but ABO and Rh
blood group systems have clinical importance as
they cause haemolytic disease. ABO and Rh
blood grouping have a wide application in genet-
ics, forensic medicine, anthropology and tissue
typing.
Medical Importance of Blood Transfusion
The process of transferring blood or blood-based
products from one person into another can be
deﬁned as blood transfusion. Blood transfusions
often are life-saving in certain situations, such as
extensive blood loss due to trauma or during
major surgery. It may also be used to treat severe
anaemia, leucopenia or thrombocytopenia caused
by a systemic blood disease. Individuals with
haemophilia,
sickle-cell
disease
or
other
haemoglobinopathies
may
require
frequent
blood transfusions.
Prior to blood transfusion, there is a list of
procedures that need to be accomplished to
ensure the correct blood group selection for the
patient. These are carried out to ensure the ABO
and Rh compatibility between donor and recipient
in which both the blood groups are typed, and to
exclude
the
presence
of
antibodies
in
the
recipient’s serum, as this could react with the
transfused red cells.
Choice of Donor
Many conditions must be satisﬁed in choosing a
donor for safety in blood transfusion. It should be
ensured that (1) plasma of the recipient should not
contain any antibodies that will haemolyse the
donor’s red blood cells, (2) plasma of the donor
should
not
have
any
antibodies
that
will
haemolyse the recipient’s red blood cells and
(3) red blood cells of the donor should not have
any antigen that is absent in the recipient. In that
case, transfused cells are considered “foreign
antigens” by the recipient’s immune system,
which will mount an immune response.
The O group has been designated as the uni-
versal donor. In the transfused O blood group, the
anti-A and anti-B antibodies do not ordinarily
cause any damage to the red cells of A or B
group recipients because they will be rendered
ineffective by dilution in the recipient’s plasma.
However, some isoantibodies in high titres (1:200
or above) may be present in O group plasma,
which can damage recipient red cells. This is
known as the dangerous O group.
Individuals with an ABO blood group having
red blood cells expressing antigens A and B, but
the serum not consisting of antibodies anti-A and
anti-B are termed as universal recipients. Hence,
red blood cells that contain any of the ABO
antigens, that is, from an individual with type A,
B, AB or O, may be transfused to the universal
recipient without inducing a haemolytic transfu-
sion reaction. A universal recipient is Rh-positive
who
has
RhD
antigen
on
the
surface
of
erythrocytes,
hereby
to
prevent
causing
a
haemolytic transfusion reaction.
Cross-Matching
The easiest way to identify antibodies in the
recipient’s serum that can cause haemolysis of
the red cells transfused is by testing the patient’s
serum with the donor’s cells (i.e. major cross-
match).
Coombs cross-match: Most of the time, the
saline slide test does not detect Rh and other
minor incompatibilities. Therefore, the Coombs
cross-match was used to discriminate the other
minor incompatibility during cross-matching. In
Coombs cross-match, washed donor cells and
recipient serum are incubated in a water bath at
37 C for 2 h. Following this, a direct Coombs test is
performed. This detects all types of incompatibilities
along with the detection of incomplete antibodies.
Risks Related to the Blood Transfusion
of Infectious Origin
Transmission of infectious agents through blood
is the most important complication. Due to this,
there are constant developments in screening and
testing; because of that, in present days, the blood

products obtained are much safer than before.
However, the risk cannot be ruled out completely
because
many
infections
undergo
window
periods during which they are not measurable by
diagnostic assays. Many infectious agents could
be transmitted if the blood is transfused from
infected individuals. These include (1) viruses,
such as human immunodeﬁciency viruses I and
II (HIV I and II), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepati-
tis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and
cytomegaloviruses (CMV); (2) bacteria, such as
Treponema pallidum and Leptospira interrogans;
and (3) protozoa, such as Toxoplasma gondii,
Leishmania donovani and Plasmodium species.
Of these pathogens, the transmission of HIV I
and II, HBV and HCV is a major concern.
Immunohematology
275
Haemolytic Disease of Newborn
(Erythroblastosis Foetalis)
Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) is an
alloimmune condition. This condition develops in
the foetus, where the foetus will have IgG
antibodies transferred from the mother via the
placenta. These antibodies subsequently attack
and lyse the red blood cells in the foetal circula-
tion, resulting in reticulocytosis and anaemia.
This condition in the foetus varies from mild to
very severe, and foetal death may occur due to
heart failure, that is, hydrops foetalis. When the
disease progresses to a moderate or severe stage,
erythroblasts can be seen in the foetal blood, and
this condition of the disease is termed as erythro-
blastosis foetalis.
Immune-mediated destruction of foetal and/or
newborn erythrocytes occurs in the presence of
IgG antibodies of maternal blood directed against
the antigens on the foetal blood cells. This is
because IgG is the only antibody that can cross
the placenta and reach the foetal circulation. Anti-
D and anti-A or anti-B are the two types of
antibodies most usually involved in haemolytic
disease of the newborn. The Anti-A or anti-B
antibodies are usually IgM in nature, but in cer-
tain conditions, IgG antibodies can also develop
as seen in the case of group O mothers. This can
be seen as an alternative to stimulation of the
immune system (certain vaccines are known to
contain
blood
group
substances
or
polysaccharides that are cross-reactive) or may
occur without any known cause.
When the body is exposed to a foreign antigen,
antibodies are produced in the body. In a mother,
there is exposure to a foreign antigen that in turn
produces IgG (as opposite to IgM, which cannot
cross the placenta); the IgG will react with the
antigen, and if persistent in the foetus, may inﬂu-
ence in utero and shall be present after delivery.
Detection of Rh Antibodies
Anti-Rh antibodies are mainly of IgG class, and
they cannot agglutinate Rh-positive cells in
saline. This is because they are “incomplete”. A
few anti-Rh antibodies are “complete” and can
agglutinate Rh-positive cells in saline. These
“complete” antibodies are of IgM class and are
irrelevant in the pathogenesis of the haemolytic
disease as they are unable to cross the placenta.
Detection of IgG anti-D antibodies can be
carried out by (1) using a colloid medium such
as 20% bovine serum albumin; (2) using red cells
treated with enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin, ﬁcin
or bromelin; and (3) the indirect Coombs test (the
most sensitive method).
Identification of Rh Incompatibility
Rh typing should be a part of the routine antenatal
examination. Foetal complications should be
expected when the woman is Rh-negative, and
the
father
is
Rh-positive.
Women
with
Rh-incompatible pregnancies should be screened
for Rh antibodies using the indirect Coombs test
at 32–34 weeks of pregnancy and once a month
afterwards.
Intrauterine
transfusion
with
Rh-negative blood is indicated if the haemolytic
disease is diagnosed antepartum. The red cells
introduced will circulate and will survive nor-
mally. It may be necessary for premature delivery
followed by transfusion in some cases. If a baby is
born with haemolytic disease, exchange transfu-
sion with Rh-negative, ABO-compatible blood
must be the treatment of choice.
ABO Haemolytic Diseases
ABO haemolytic diseases occur in a very less
number of cases, even though materno-foetal
ABO incompatibility is very common. The

condition is usually seen in O group mothers
bearing blood group A or B foetus. It occurs
largely
in
O
group
mothers
because
the
isoantibodies are largely IgG in nature and can
cross the placenta. It does not occur in mothers
with blood group A or B because natural
antibodies are mainly IgM in nature, which does
not cross the placenta and sensitise the foetus.
276
21
Immunohaematology and Immunoprophylaxis
Unlike haemolytic disease of the newborn, the
ABO haemolytic diseases can occur even in a ﬁrst
child even without prior immunisation. This is
because the ABO disease is caused by naturally
occurring
maternal
isoantibodies.
ABO
haemolytic disease is a much milder condition
than that of Rh disease. The diagnosis of ABO
incompatibility is made by a positive indirect
Coombs test but a negative direct Coombs test.
Peripheral blood smear characteristically shows
spherocytosis.
Immunoprophylaxis
Immunoprophylaxis is the prevention of disease
by the production of active or passive immunity.
Owing to the regular vaccination programmes,
the frequency of occurrence of various diseases
such
as
poliomyelitis,
diphtheria,
measles,
mumps, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough),
rubella
(German
measles)
has
declined
drastically.
Disease prevention is possible by vaccination,
a cost-effective method. Vaccines have largely
contributed to the ﬁght to eradicate the deadly
global scourges, like smallpox. The last case of
naturally acquired smallpox was reported in
October 1977; since then, there have been no
reports from around the globe. Other diseases
like
diphtheria,
pertussis,
tetanus,
measles,
mumps, rubella and poliomyelitis, also known
as “vaccine-preventable diseases”, have been
successfully brought down to negligible levels
in most developed nations and in some cases in
the developing nations as well.
Active or passive immunisation can be effec-
tive
in
developing
immunity
to
infectious
organisms. Immunity, in either case, can be
acquired by two means: (1) natural processes,
usually by transfer from mother to foetus or by
the previous infection by the organism; and
(2) artiﬁcial processes, by injection of antibodies
or administration of vaccines etc. Passive immu-
nity may be induced by agents, including
antibodies from human or animal sources. How-
ever, active immunity is attained by inoculation
of the pathogen that may induce immunity but is
not capable of causing a disease or with antigenic
elements of the pathogen.
Immunoprophylaxis is broadly of two types:
First is routine immunisation, which is used for all
children. Second is immunisation of individuals
or selected groups, used for individuals or groups
exposed to the risk of speciﬁc diseases.
Active Immunisation
Active immunisation can be acquired either by
natural or artiﬁcial means. Natural immunity may
be due to infection with a microorganism,
whereas artiﬁcial immunity may be artiﬁcially
acquired by administering a vaccine. As the
name implies, active immunisation involves the
active role played by the host immune system.
The antigen-reactive B- and T-cells proliferate,
resulting in the formation of memory cells. Vari-
ous vaccines based on active immunisation have
dramatically reduced the number of deaths (espe-
cially among children) from infectious agents.
Vaccines may be (1) live attenuated, (2) killed
or (3) in the form of toxoids (Table 21.2).
Live-Attenuated Vaccines
As the name suggests, these vaccines contain
live-attenuated organisms that have lost their
pathogenicity
but
have
antigenicity.
The
attenuated organisms are the suspensions of live
organisms
with
reduced
virulence.
These
organisms multiply in the body and provide a
continuous antigenic stimulus, resulting in the
production of protective antibodies without pro-
ducing the disease. They are also capable of gen-
eration
of
memory
cells.
For
viruses
and
intracellular bacteria, these vaccines can provide
a cell-mediated immune response since they can
grow inside the host cell.

Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), smallpox
vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV), measles,
mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and yellow
fever vaccine are some of the examples of live
vaccines.
These
live
vaccines
are
usually
contraindicated for use in immunocompromised
patients, such as patients with HIV (human
immunodeﬁciency
virus),
leukaemia,
malignancies. Some of the important features of
live-attenuated vaccines include:
1. The live-attenuated vaccines have the rare
potential to revert to the virulent form.
Vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis when
using the oral polio vaccine has been reported.
2. The organism in the live vaccine may be able
to cross the placenta and cause foetal infection.
So, similar to immunocompromised patients,
these vaccines should be avoided during
pregnancy.
3. The vaccines need a cold chain to maintain the
viability of the organisms. High temperatures
can inactivate these vaccines, particularly the
viral vaccines, leading to vaccine failure.
Killed Inactivated Vaccines
These vaccines contain killed pathogens, hence
do not replicate in the body. At least three doses
of the killed vaccine followed by a booster dose
are essential to confer protective immunity. These
vaccines may not produce an adequate immune
response, and the response may be short-lived.
However, in contrast to live vaccines, they have
an excellent safety proﬁle and can be given to
immunocompromised
patients
and
pregnant
women. Typhoid, cholera, pertussis, pneumococ-
cal, rabies, hepatitis B and inﬂuenza vaccines are
examples of killed-attenuated vaccines.
Toxoids
Toxoids are modiﬁed toxins that have retained
their antigenicity but have lost their toxicity.
These are given to confer protection against
diseases caused by the production of toxins.
Two toxoids most widely used for immunisation
are tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. DPT—
diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus—vaccine is a triple
vaccine consisting of tetanus and diphtheria
toxoids and pertussis killed vaccine.
Adsorption of toxoids to a mineral carrier,
such as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phos-
phate, enhances the antigenicity of toxoids. This
is because these adsorbed toxoids remain longer
in a depot after injection and continue to stimulate
the host’s immune system for a longer time.
These are usually prepared by treating toxins
with formalin.
Subunit Vaccines
Subunit
vaccines
are
specialised
vaccines
prepared by purifying the fragments of major
immunogenic components of microorganisms
and
are
produced
by
recombinant
deoxyribonucleic
acid
(DNA)
technology

(hepatitis B subunit vaccine). The immune
response occurs, but there is no certainty that
memory cells will be produced.
278
21
Immunohaematology and Immunoprophylaxis
Cellular Fractions
Cellular fractions or bacterial polysaccharides are
polymers with repetitive sugar units linked by
glycosidic bonds. Certain vaccines are prepared
from
cellular
fractions
like
extracellular
polysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides (CPS)
and
lipopolysaccharides
of
microorganisms.
Puriﬁed cell-wall components and CPS from
Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal vaccine)
and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal
vaccine) are used to produce vaccines against
these pathogens. The safety and efﬁcacy of these
vaccines are high, but they are of limited use.
Recombinant Vaccines
The concept behind the recombinant vaccine is
that a more targeted immune response is pro-
duced when the most immunogenic protein or
peptide (epitope) from the infectious agent is
administered. These proteins are produced in an
expression system (bacteria, yeast or mammalian
system)
by
recombinant
technology.
The
expressed proteins are then puriﬁed, combined
with an adjuvant, and administered to boost the
immune response (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine and
pertussis vaccine). Since 1981, recombinant pro-
tein vaccine against hepatitis B infection has been
available. This vaccine uses the surface antigen of
hepatitis B, and it is the ﬁrst recombinant vaccine
to be cloned in yeast.
Conjugate Vaccine
It is a subtype of subunit vaccine where the bac-
terial polysaccharide, which is poorly immuno-
genic by itself, is bound to a carrier protein that
helps
in
increasing
the
long-term
immune
response. Various protein carriers are used for
conjugation, including diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids. Thus, it can be used in infants where
plain polysaccharide vaccines are ineffective.
The three conjugate vaccines commonly used
are Haemophilus inﬂuenza type b (Hib), pneumo-
coccal 7 valent, 10 valent and 13 valent vaccines
and meningococcal A vaccine.
DNA Vaccines
These are novel potential vaccine candidates,
sometimes
referred
to
as
third-generation
vaccines, and involve the direct introduction into
the tissue of a DNA sequence encoding an anti-
gen on a plasmid vector. Since plasmids are
non-living entities, there is no risk for reversion
to a pathogenic phase. The advantages include
stimulation of both T- and B-lymphocytes, vac-
cine stability, absence of any organism and ease
of large-scale production. These vaccines were
ﬁrst tried for HIV and, later, for inﬂuenza virus,
human papillomavirus, hepatitis viruses and
malaria parasite in animal models. Phase 1 clinical
trials, however, have shown disappointing results
with poor immunogenicity for both cell-mediated
and antibody-mediated immunity, although they
were found to be safe without many side effects.
No DNA vaccine is licensed for human use yet
but has been approved for West Nile Virus in
horses and canine melanoma. A DNA-based
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine
was recently approved in 2021 for emergency
use in India.
mRNA Vaccines
This type of vaccine uses a copy of the messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA encodes
for the antigen of a pathogen that is delivered to
the immune cells, which in turn produces the
designated protein (antigen) of the organisms
resulting in an immune response. This type of
approach has been used to develop a widely
used vaccine against severe acute respiratory syn-
drome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to combat
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Edible Vaccines
It is another new approach that is being explored,
where antigens will be delivered through edible
plant
products.
They
can
be
produced
by
introducing the desired gene into a plant to man-
ufacture the encoded protein. The envelope

protein of a speciﬁc virus or bacteria that has no
pathogenicity
is
used
for
this
purpose.
Advantages include affordability, ease of mass
production and the ease of administration by con-
suming the plant product like its fruit, and very
importantly, their ability to induce mucosal
immunity at the gut level. Potato, tomato, banana,
tobacco, rice and edible algae are some of the
plants that are potential candidates, and the
diseases that have been targeted in various studies
include, among others, cholera, hepatitis A and B,
Norwalk disease, inﬂuenza and malaria.

Immunisation Schedule
World Health Organisation (WHO)
Immunisation Programmes
Globally, in 1975, smallpox was reported to be
successfully eradicated through effective vaccina-
tion programmes and strengthened surveillance.
Following this, to control vaccine-preventable
diseases, in 1978, the Expanded Programme on
Immunisation (EPI) was launched in India. Diph-
theria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, typhoid
and childhood tuberculosis were the diseases
initially selected to cover 80% of all the infants.
After a while, in 1985, this programme was
universalised
and
named
as
Universal
Immunisation
Programme
(UIP).
In
this
programme, the typhoid vaccine was withdrawn,
and the measles vaccine was included. UIP was
implemented in a phased manner with the pri-
mary immunisation schedule for all infants and
tetanus toxoid immunisation for all pregnant
women, and intended to cover all the districts
around the country by 1990.
Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP)
Its vision is to achieve and sustain universal
immunisation with three doses of DPT and
OPV, one dose of both measles and BCG in
infants, and two primary doses or one booster
dose of tetanus toxoid in pregnant women. This
also includes storing and transporting vaccines by
a reliable cold-chain system and attaining self-
sufﬁciency in the production of all required
vaccines.
The UIP became a component of the Child
Survival
and
Safe
Motherhood
Programme
(CSSM) in 1992; it also became an important
part of the Reproductive and Child Health
Programme (RCH) in 1997. The cold-chain sys-
tem was strengthened throughout the country, and
extensive training programmes were launched.
Polio Eradication Programme with the National
Immunisation Days (NIDs) and active surveil-
lance for acute ﬂaccid paralysis (AFP) for
intensiﬁed
polio
eradication
was
started
in
1995–1996. This programme was laid down
with the assistance of the National Polio Surveil-
lance Project.
National Immunisation Schedule
The immunisation programme in India was
introduced in 1978 as the Expanded Programme
of Immunisation (EPI), which gained momentum
in 1985 and was expanded as the Universal
Immunisation
Programme
(UIP)
to
be
implemented in a phased manner to cover all
districts in the country by 1989–1990. UIP
became a part of the Child Survival and Safe
Motherhood Programme in 1992. Since 1997,
immunisation activities have been an important
component of the National Reproductive and
Child Health Programme and are currently one
of the key areas under the National Rural Health
Mission (NRHM) since 2005. Under the Univer-
sal Immunisation Programme, the Government of
India is providing vaccination to prevent the fol-
lowing
vaccine-preventable
diseases,
i.e. diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles,
a severe form of childhood tuberculosis (BCG),
hepatitis B, H. inﬂuenza type b (Hib) and Rotavi-
rus diarrhoea. One signiﬁcant achievement is that
from 2011, no wild poliovirus case was reported
from the country and India was certiﬁed as a
“polio-free country” along with other South-East
Asia Region countries of the WHO.
National
Technical
Advisory
Group
on
Immunisation recommended introduction of
injectable polio vaccine (IPV) as an additional
dose along with a third dose of DPT in the entire
country from the ﬁrst quarter of 2016. In 2013,
India, along with other South-East Asia Region,
declared
commitment
towards
measles

elimination and rubella/congenital rubella syn-
drome (CRS) control by 2020. Towards this
direction, the rubella vaccine is to be introduced
as MR—measles, rubella—vaccine replacing
the measles-containing vaccine, with ﬁrst dose
at 9 months and the second dose at 16–
24 months. In addition, the Japanese encephali-
tis vaccine has been introduced in endemic
areas in 20 states. The introduction of a penta-
valent vaccine incorporating Hib, DPT and hep-
atitis B is another new step that has been taken
as part of the immunisation schedule. National

Passive Immunisation
Passive
immunisation
is
carried
out
by
administering human and animal sera, which
serve as the readymade source of prepared
antibodies against a particular pathogen. These
are given to an individual to confer immediate
protection against a particular pathogen. The
immunity, however, is of short duration.
Human Sera
Normal
human
immunoglobulins
include
(1) pooled human immunoglobulin and (2) spe-
ciﬁc hyperimmune immunoglobulin.

Immunoprophylaxis
281
Pooled Human Immunoglobulin
It
is
prepared
from
normal
human
serum
containing a high concentration of a particular
antibody. It is usually used for short-term prophy-
laxis of hepatitis A, measles.
Specific Hyperimmune Immunoglobulin
Speciﬁc
hyperimmune
immunoglobulin
is
prepared from patients convalescing from the dis-
ease or individuals actively immunised against a
speciﬁc disease. These hyperimmune sera are
available against a variety of diseases. Examples
are
human
rabies
immunoglobulin
(HRIG)
against rabies, human tetanus immunoglobulin
(HTIG) against tetanus, hepatitis B immunoglob-
ulin (HBIG) against hepatitis B and varicella-
zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) against varicella-
zoster. These hyperimmune sera are usually
given intramuscularly. They are usually not
given shortly before or after active immunisation
to avoid inhibition of immune responses.
Animal Sera
Animal sera are prepared in animals. These sera
rich
in
antibodies
are
produced
by
active
immunisation
of
animals,
such
as
horses.
Antitetanus
serum
and
antivenom
sera
are
examples of such sera used against tetanus and
snake bites, respectively. The disadvantages of
these sera are that in some recipients, they may
cause serum sickness and anaphylaxis; moreover,
they are eliminated much more rapidly from
humans.
Combined Active and Passive
Immunisation
Combined active and passive immunisation is
often carried out to confer slowly developing
immunity and immediate passive immunity,
respectively, against certain diseases, such as
diphtheria, tetanus and rabies.
Individual Immunisation
The
vaccines
mentioned
in
the
universal
immunisation schedule are selected based on
economic considerations and the epidemiology
of infectious diseases in the region. But there are
many vaccines available, which can supplement
the schedule depending on the individual cases
and affordability.
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted from one
person to another through blood and body ﬂuids
and primarily infects the liver. Healthcare person-
nel and people constantly exposed to infected
blood or other body ﬂuids are at a high risk of
infection. Infected mothers are the commonest
mode of spread to infants globally. Chronic
HBV carriers are generally 90% of the infants
infected at birth through their mothers or approx-
imately 30–50% of those before the age of
5 years. Adults who are newly infected contribute
to only a 6–10% risk of chronic infection. There-
fore,
routine
administration
of
hepatitis
B
immunisations at birth is highly recommended.
Vaccination with at least three doses of the
hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. Infants are
given a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth.
HBV
in
combination
with
the
DPT
and
inactivated polio vaccines are recommended for
children between the ages of 6 weeks and 7 years.
HBV and Hib (H. inﬂuenza type b) conjugate
vaccine may be given to children between the
ages of 6 weeks and 15 months. Dialysis patients
and immunocompromised people may require
additional doses.
MR Vaccine
MR (measles, rubella) vaccine is given for
preventing both measles and rubella disease in
the child. MR vaccine is being introduced instead
of MMR vaccine as there is not enough evidence
to suggest that mumps is a disease of public
health importance. MR vaccine gives lifelong
protection in most children.
MR campaign: MR campaign is a special
campaign to vaccinate all children of 9 months
to <15 years of age group with one dose of MR
vaccine. The MR campaign dose is given to all
targeted
children,
both
immunised
and
unimmunised,
irrespective
of
prior
measles/
rubella infection. The goal of the MR campaign
is to accelerate population immunity by reaching

100% target children with the MR vaccine that
will reduce cases and deaths from measles and
disabilities
from
CRS
(congenital
rubella
syndrome).

Immunohaematology and Immunoprophylaxis
Typhoid Vaccine
Recently, two newer vaccines have replaced the
older vaccine used in typhoid fever. These
vaccines are oral live-attenuated vaccines using
a weakened strain of Salmonella Typhi that is
given orally and a parenteral capsular polysaccha-
ride vaccine that is given by injection.
The oral typhoid vaccine can be administered
to children 6 years of age or older and adults. It is
given in a total dosage of four capsules, one
capsule taken orally every other day. A booster
dose is needed every 5 years for people who
continue to remain at risk. The polysaccharide
typhoid vaccine is given by injection to children
older than 2 years. One shot is enough to provide
protection. A booster dose is needed every 2 years
for people who remain at risk for exposure. Efﬁ-
cacy of 50–80% was seen from the two licensed
vaccines. The oral vaccine has shown a protective
efﬁcacy of 62% for at least 7 years after the
last dose.
Vaccination During Outbreaks
There has been controversy regarding the useful-
ness of administering a vaccine during the out-
break of the particular disease against which the
vaccine is being used. This problem has been
studied in detail regarding measles vaccination
to children during a measles outbreak. The weight
of evidence suggests that because of the high
transmissibility of the virus, mass vaccination
will not stop the epidemic but will reduce the
death in settings where most infections occur in
children below 5 years of age. The lessons learnt
from the measles study have been applied to the
recent COVID-19 pandemic, where it has also
been found that although the available vaccines
cannot stop infection, they deﬁnitely reduce the
severity of illness and mortality.
Newer Vaccines in the Experimental
or Clinical Trial Stages
The traditional vaccine development approach
relied on the isolation of the organisms and then
employing whole or part of the organisms as
antigen to develop an immune response. This
approach has been largely superseded in recent
years due to the knowledge gained from genomic
studies and the associated proteomics. It allows
the prediction of all antigens without growing the
organisms. The potential vaccine candidates are
identiﬁed by proteomic analysis of the organism
in silico with the help of computers, and this
approach has been termed Reverse Vaccinology.
With the modern approach, new vaccines are
being explored not only for diseases for which
no vaccines are available but also to improve the
existing vaccines in terms of immunogenicity and
duration of effectiveness. Studies are underway to
develop new vaccine candidates for various bac-
terial, viral, protozoan and helminthic diseases.
Many of them have entered clinical trials, like
those of malaria, acquired immunodeﬁciency
syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, kala-azar etc.

Part III
Bacteriology

Introduction to Bacteriology
22
Microbes are tiny little creatures, invisible to
naked eyes. Initial taxonomical classiﬁcation
broadly categorised bacteria under the animal
and plant kingdoms. However, currently, bacteria
are placed under a separate kingdom called
Protista. The kingdom Protista mainly comprises
Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. Organisms such
as fungi, protozoa, algae (other than blue-green
algae)
and
slime
moulds
are
included
in
Eukaryotes, whereas bacteria and blue-green
algae belong to Prokaryotes.
Classification
Traditionally, all life forms are classiﬁed into
kingdoms. Such kingdom bases classiﬁcation
started with two kingdom classiﬁcations of
Linnaeus in 1735 that slowly evolved and
expanded by different individuals with the addi-
tion of more kingdoms. In the latest, seven
kingdoms distributed in two superkingdoms
(empire) based classiﬁcation were introduced in
2015.

285
In contrast, classiﬁcation was also done to
determine life form evolution based on genetic
information. Such classiﬁcation made by Carl
Woese has introduced the concept of domains
instead of kingdoms. Life has been three distinct
domains, namely Eubacteria, Archaebacteria and
Eukarya. Phylogenetically it was noted that
Eubacteria (we know as bacteria) were separated
ﬁrst in evolution, whereas Archaebacteria and
Eukarya
(including
plants,
fungi,
animals,
humans) diverged later in the timeline.
Viruses, a non-living entity, were not consid-
ered in any classiﬁcation systems and hence are
neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes.
The Linnaean system of nomenclature is
followed
for
naming
a
bacterium,
like
Escherichia coli, where Escherichia is the genus
and coli is the species. The name should be
italicised or underlined.
The basis of the classiﬁcation of bacteria is not
completely perfect, and a combination of pheno-
typic and genetic characters is commonly used.
The phylogenetic basis of classiﬁcation considers
various morphological, biological and antigenic
properties of the bacterium. A phylogenetic tree is
constructed based on weightage given to individ-
ual characteristics (which is different for various
attributes), reﬂecting the organism’s evolutionary
position. On the other hand, the phenetic or
Adansonian classiﬁcation or its further reﬁne-
ment, the Numerical Taxonomy method, is simi-
lar
but
gives
equal
weightage
to
each
characteristic. The genetic relatedness of the

organisms is the basis for molecular classiﬁcation
where traditionally the guanine+cytosine content
has been used. The G¼C content for a particular
species is remarkably constant. The classiﬁcation
system has been undergoing tremendous changes
by using genome sequencing in recent years. The
classiﬁcation relies on average nucleotide identity
(ANI), where whole genomes of organisms are
compared in contrast to the previous generation
approaches on GC content analysis. Most of the
important pathogenic bacteria have undergone
whole-genome sequencing leading to precise
identiﬁcation and degree of relatedness between
closely associated members in a group.
286
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
In addition to the species level identiﬁcation,
many bacteria can be subdivided below the spe-
cies level into subspecies by either antigenic
properties of cell components or a set of biochem-
ical and related tests. This has helped describe the
pathogenesis and the variation in the disease
spectrum of a particular species. The use of
terms like subspecies, serogroups, serovars or
biotypes refers to this type of sub-classiﬁcation.
Shape of Bacteria
Depending on their shape, bacteria are classiﬁed
into several types.
1. Cocci: The cocci (kokkos, berry) are oval or
spherical cells. These may be arranged in pairs
(e.g.
pneumococci,
meningococci
and
gonococci),
tetrads
(micrococci),
chains
(e.g.
streptococci)
and
clusters
(e.g. staphylococci).
2. Bacilli: The bacilli (bacillus, rod) are rod
shaped. These bacilli may show either of
the following arrangement. (1) Coccobacilli:
The length of the bacteria is approximately the
same as its width, for example, Brucella.
(2) Streptobacilli: These are arranged in
chains,
for
example,
Streptobacillus.
(3) Comma shaped: They exhibit a curved
appearance,
for
example,
Vibrio;
and
(4) Spirilla: They exhibit rigid spiral forms,
for example, Spirillum.
3. Spirochetes: Spirochetes (Spira, coil; chaite,
hair) are slender, ﬂexuous spiral forms, for
example, Treponema.
4. Actinomycetes: Actinomycetes (actin, ray;
mykes, fungus) are branching ﬁlamentous bac-
teria resembling fungi. They possess a rigid
cell wall.
5. Mycoplasmas: These are cell wall deﬁcient
bacteria without stable morphology. They
occur
as
round
or
oval
bodies
and
as
interlacing ﬁlaments in nature.
At times cell wall synthesis of bacteria
becomes defective either spontaneously or due
to antibiotics like penicillin. As a result, bacteria
lose their distinctive shape, and such cells are
called protoplast, spheroplasts or L forms.
An arrangement of the bacteria depends on its
plane of cell division (binary ﬁssion) and the
tendency of daughter cells to remain attached
even after complete cell division. For example,
corynebacteria arrange themselves in cuneiform
or Chinese letter pattern. Similarly, most cocci
arrange
themselves
in
various
patterns,
as
described earlier.
Bacterial Anatomy
Bacterial cell shows the following structures:
Cell envelope: It provides a structural and physi-
ological barrier between the protoplasm of the
cell and the external environment. It gives
bacteria rigidity and shape and protects bacte-
ria against osmotic lysis. The cell envelope
primarily
consists
of
two
components:
(1) rigid cell wall and (2) cytoplasmic or
plasma membrane beneath the cell wall.
Cell interior: It encloses the protoplasm, which
consists of (1) cytoplasm, (2) cytoplasmic
inclusions (mesosomes, ribosomes, inclusion
granules and vacuoles) and (3) nucleus, a sin-
gle circular DNA (Fig. 22.1).
Additional structures: Some bacterial cells may
have additional appendages such as ﬁmbriae
for adhesion, and ﬂagella for locomotion. Sim-
ilarly, some bacteria are covered with a slime

layer or well-deﬁned capsule, which helps in
immune evasion.
Cell Envelope
This
includes
cell
wall
and
cytoplasmic
membrane.
Cell Wall
Prokaryotic cells are almost always bounded by a
fairly rigid and chemically complex structure
between the cell membrane and capsule/slime
layer called the cell wall. The cell wall provides
shape to the cell and protects bacteria from
changes in osmotic pressure, which measures
5–20 atmospheres within the bacteria cell. The
cell wall cannot be visualised by direct light
microscopy and does not stain with simple stains.
Structure: Generally, cell walls of bacteria
range from 10 to 25 nm in thickness and makeup
to 20–30% of the dry weight of the cell. Peptido-
glycan is the main component of the cell wall and
is responsible for the shape and strength of the
cell. It is a disaccharide and contains two sugar
derivatives—N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl
muramic acid—joined together by short peptide
chains. The spaces formed during peptidoglycan
scaffolding contain other chemicals, and their
composition varies from species to species.
Bacterial cells can be classiﬁed into Gram-
positive or Gram-negative based on the structural
differences in the cell walls. In general, the cell
walls of Gram-positive bacteria have simpler
chemical structures than Gram-negative bacteria.
The cell wall bears bacterial antigens that are
important in virulence and immunity.
Gram-Positive Cell Wall
The Gram-negative cell wall is thick (15–80 nm)
and more homogeneous than the thin (2 nm)
Gram-negative cell wall. The Gram-positive cell
wall contains a large amount of peptidoglycan
present in several layers that constitute about
40–80% of the dry weight of the cell wall
(Fig. 22.2). The Gram-positive cell wall consists
primarily of teichoic and teichuronic acids.
1. Teichoic acids: Teichoic acids are polymers of
polyribitol
phosphate
or
polyglycerol
phosphate-containing
ribitol
and
glycerol.
Teichoic acids are of two types—wall teichoic
acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA).
Teichoic acids have many functions. (1) They
constitute major surface antigens of those
Gram-positive species that possess them. In
Streptococcus pneumoniae, the teichoic acids
bear
the
antigenic
determinants
called
Forssman antigen. In Streptococcus pyogenes,
LTA is associated with the M protein that
protrudes from the cell membrane through
the peptidoglycan layer. The long M protein
molecules
together
with
the
LTA
form
microﬁbrils that facilitate the attachment of

S. pyogenes to animal cells. (a) They are also
used as antigens for the serological classiﬁca-
tion of bacteria. (b) They serve as substrates
for many autolytic enzymes’. (c) They bind
magnesium ions and may play a role in sup-
plying this ion to the cell. (d) They play a role
in the normal functioning of the cell wall and
provide an external permeability barrier to
Gram-positive bacteria. (e) Membrane teichoic
acid serves to anchor the underlying cell
membrane.
2. Teichuronic acid: Teichuronic acid consists
of repeat units of sugar acids (such as N-acetyl
mannuronic or D-glucuronic acid). They are
synthesised in place of teichoic acids when
phosphate supply to the cell is limited.
The Gram-positive cell wall also contains neu-
tral sugars (such as mannose, arabinose, rham-
nose and glucosamine) and acidic sugars (such
as glucuronic acid and mannuronic acid)
which occur as sub-units of polysaccharides
in the cell wall.
Gram-Negative Cell Wall
The Gram-negative cell wall is much more com-
plex than the Gram-positive cell wall. Peptidogly-
can content in the Gram-negative cell wall is
signiﬁcantly less than in the Gram-positive cell
wall. The Gram-negative cell wall contains
(1) lipopolysaccharides, (2) outer membrane,
(3) lipoprotein layer and (4) peptidoglycan
(Fig. 22.3).
1. Lipopolysaccharides:
Lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) are complex molecules present in the
outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
Structurally, the LPS consist of three main
components—lipid A (Region III), the core
oligosaccharide (Region II) and the O polysac-
charide or O-antigen (Region I) (Fig. 22.4).
Lipid A consists of hydroxymyristic acid, a
unique
fatty
acid
associated
with
the
endotoxic
activity
of
the
LPS.
The
endotoxic activities include pyrogenicity,
lethal
effect,
tissue
necrosis,
anticomplementary activity, B-cell mitoge-
nicity,
immunoadjuvant
property
and
antitumour activity.
Core oligosaccharide: This includes two
characteristic sugars—keto-deoxy octanoic
acid (KDO) and a heptose—joined together
by lipid A. This is genus speciﬁc and simi-
lar
to
all
Gram-negative
bacteria.
Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are smaller
glycolipids.
They
are
relatively
short,
multi-antennary (i.e. branched) glycans
present
in
bacteria
(e.g.
Neisseria
meningitidis,
Neisseria
gonorrhoea,
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and Haemophilus
ducreyi) that colonise mucosal surfaces.
They exhibit extensive antigenic and struc-
tural diversity even within a single strain.
LOS are an important virulence factor.
Epitopes on LOS have a terminal N-
acetyllactosamine
(Gal((3)l-4-GlcNAc)
residue, which is immunochemically simi-
lar to the precursor of the human erythro-
cyte
antigen.
Sialylation
of
the
N-
acetyllactosamine residue in vivo provides
the
organism
with
the
environmental
advantages of molecular mimicry of a host
antigen and the biologic masking thought to
be provided by sialic acids.
O polysaccharide or O-antigen: It is the por-
tion extending outwards from the core. It

has several peculiar sugars and varies in
composition between bacterial strains, con-
ferring species-speciﬁc antigen speciﬁcity.
It is exposed to the host immune system.
Gram-negative bacteria may thwart host
defences by rapidly changing the nature of
their O side chains to avoid detection.
2. Outer membrane: The outer membrane is a
bilayered structure; its inner part resembles in
composition with that of the cell membrane,
while its outer part contains a distinctive com-
ponent called lipopolysaccharide. The outer
membrane and plasma membrane appear to
be in direct contact at many sites in the
Gram-negative wall. The outer membrane
consists of porins, outer membrane proteins
and other proteins.
Porins are special channels consisting of pro-
tein molecules called porins, present in the
outer membrane. They permit the passive
diffusion of low-molecular-weight hydro-
philic compounds, such as sugars, amino
acids and certain ions; exclude hydrophobic
molecules and serve to protect the cell.
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are of
various
types.
Omp
C,
D,
F
and
PhoE&LamB are the four major proteins
responsible for most of the transmembrane
diffusion of maltose and maltodextrins. On
A protein anchors the outer membrane to
the peptidoglycan layer. It is also the sex
pilus receptor in F-mediated bacterial con-
jugation. Tsx is one of omps and serves as a
receptor for T6 bacteriophage. It is respon-
sible for the transmembrane diffusion of
nucleosides and some amino acids. These
are involved in the transport of speciﬁc
molecules, such as vitamin B12 and iron-
siderophore complexes; it also contains a
limited number of minor proteins, such as
enzymes, phospholipases and proteases.
3. Lipoprotein layer: The lipoprotein layer is
mainly
composed
of
Braun
lipoprotein.
Braun lipoprotein is a small lipoprotein that
is covalently joined to the underlying peptido-
glycan and embedded in the outer membrane
by its hydrophobic end. The lipoprotein
stabilises the outer membrane of the Gram-
negative cell wall.
4. Peptidoglycan: It is 2–3 nm thin and is bound
by the lipoprotein and plasma membrane.
Differences
between
Gram-positive
and
Gram-negative cell walls are summarised in
Table 22.1.
Periplasmic Space
Periplasmic space is a distinct space between the
cell membrane and outer membrane (innermost
layer of Gram-negative cell wall) in Gram-
negative bacteria. The periplasmic space contains
many proteins that participate in nutrient acquisi-
tion. It also contains many hydrolytic enzymes,
beta-lactamases binding proteins and enzymes
that participate in the peptidoglycan synthesis.
The periplasmic space is less distinct in Gram-
positive cell walls.
Cell Wall of Acid-Fast Bacilli
The cell wall of acid-fast bacilli, such as Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis, contains large amounts of
waxes known as mycolic acids. The cell wall is
composed of peptidoglycan and lipid. The inner
lipid bilayer contains mycolic acids linked to an

arabinose glycan protein, and the outer layer
contains other extractable lipids. Its structure
makes these bacteria resistant to harsh chemicals,
including detergents and strong acids. During
staining, if the dye is introduced into these cells
by brief heating or treatment with detergents, they
resist decolourisation by sulphuric acid or acid
alcohol
and
are
therefore
called
acid-fast
organisms.
Bacterial Anatomy
291
Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis
Many agents, such as antibiotics, lysozyme and
bacteriophages, interfere or inhibit the synthesis
of bacterial cell wall components, resulting in the
formation of defective bacteria or atypical forms
of bacteria. These defective forms include i) cell
wall deﬁcient forms, ii) pleomorphic bacteria and
iii) involution forms.
Cell Wall Deficient Forms
These may be of various types, such as—
protoplasts,
spheroplasts,
mycoplasma
and
L-forms.
Protoplasts are defective unstable forms of bac-
teria with an intact cytoplasmic membrane but
without any cell wall. In hypertonic media,
these are produced from Gram-positive cells
on treatment with lysozyme.
Spheroplasts are defective forms derived from
Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of
EDTA
(ethylene
diaminetetraacetic
acid).
The EDTA disrupts the outer membrane
allowing access to lysozyme and resulting in
the formation of spheroplasts. Spheroplasts are
osmotically fragile and still retain the outer
membrane and entrapped peptidoglycan.
Mycoplasma is naturally occurring bacteria with-
out a cell wall. They do not possess any deﬁ-
nite shape. They are very minute in size,
measuring 50–300 nm in diameter.
L-forms is named after Lister Institute, London,
where the abnormal form of Streptobacillus
moniliformis was ﬁrst demonstrated. The
L-forms do not exhibit any regular size and
shape. They may be spherical or disc-shaped,
about 0.1–20 μm in diameter. They are difﬁ-
cult to cultivate and usually require a medium
that is solidiﬁed with agar and has the right
osmotic strength. They are produced more
readily with exposure to penicillin than with
lysozyme. Some bacterial species produce
L-forms spontaneously. L-forms in the host
may produce chronic infections and are rela-
tively resistant to antibiotic treatment.
Pleomorphic Bacteria
Pleomorphic bacteria (e.g. Yersinia pestis) may
show considerable variation in size and shape
called pleomorphism.
Involution Forms
The involution forms are those that, on the ageing
of culture, show swollen and aberrant forms,
especially in high salt concentration.
Demonstration of Cell Wall
The cell walls can be demonstrated by (1) differ-
ential staining procedure, (2) electron micros-
copy,
(3)
plasmolysis,
(4)
microdissection,
(5) mechanical rupture of the cell and (6) serolog-
ical test by exposure to speciﬁc antibodies.
Cytoplasmic Membrane
Cytoplasmic membrane or plasma membrane is a
thin (5–10 nm) semipermeable membrane that
acts as an osmotic barrier. It lies beneath the cell
wall separating it from the cell cytoplasm. Bacte-
rial plasma membranes usually have a higher
proportion of protein than eukaryotic membranes.
Cell
membrane
primarily
consists
of
phospholipids and proteins. It also contains
enzymes associated with DNA biosynthesis, cell
wall polymers and membrane lipids. They usually
differ from eukaryotic membranes in lacking
sterols, such as cholesterol, except in Myco-
plasma. The cytoplasmic membrane acts as a
semipermeable membrane regulating the inﬂow
and outﬂow of metabolites to and from the proto-
plasm. It also helps in electron transport and
oxidative phosphorylation.

Introduction to Bacteriology
Cell Interior
This encloses the protoplasm, which comprises
many components such as cytoplasm, cytoplas-
mic inclusions and nucleus.
Cytoplasm
Bacterial cytoplasm is a colloidal suspension of
various organic and inorganic solutes in a viscous
watery solution. It consists of nearly 70% water.
The cytoplasm contains all the biosynthetic
components required by a bacterium for growth
and cell division, together with genetic material.
Cytoplasmic Inclusions
These
include
ribosomes,
mesosomes
and
intracytoplasmic inclusions bodies.
1. Ribosomes
The cytoplasmic matrix often is packed with
ribosomes. Ribosomes look like small, featureless
particles
at
low
magniﬁcation
in
electron
micrographs. They consist of two subunits of
the 30S and 50S, giving a net 70S. Ribosomes
are important because they serve as the sites of
protein synthesis. Matrix ribosomes synthesise
proteins destined to remain within the cell,
whereas plasma membrane
ribosomes make
proteins for transport to the outside. They are
also the sites of actions of several antibiotics,
such
as
aminoglycosides,
macrolides
and
tetracyclines.
2. Mesosomes
These
are
vesicular
convoluted
or
multi-
laminated structures formed by invagination of
the
plasma
membrane
into
the
cytoplasm.
Mesosomes are of two types—septal and lateral.
The septal mesosome attached to the bacterial
DNA
coordinates
nuclear
and
cytoplasmic
divisions during binary ﬁssion. The function of
lateral
mesosomes
remains
to
be
known.
Mesosomes are analogous to the mitochondria
of eukaryotes and are the principal sites of respi-
ratory enzymes in bacteria.
3. Intracytoplasmic Inclusion Bodies
Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are present in
the protoplasm of bacteria. They may be of two
types: (1) organic inclusion bodies, which usually
contain either glycogen or polyhydroxy butyrate,
and (2) inorganic inclusion bodies, which may be
of polyphosphate granules or sulphur granules.
Their main function is believed to be storage.
They are also the sources of carbon, inorganic
substances and energy. Some inclusion bodies
also function to reduce osmotic pressure.
Examples of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies
include
metachromatic
granules
or
volutin
granules, starch inclusions and lipid inclusions.
Volutin granules, typically present in Corynebac-
terium diphtheriae, can be demonstrated by
Albert stain. Similarly, starch granules present in
the bacteria can be demonstrated on staining with
iodine. Lipid inclusion found in mycobacteria is
demonstrated by Sudan black dye. Bacterial cyto-
plasm, unlike that of eukaryotes, lacks endoplas-
mic reticulum and mitochondria. It also does not
show any protoplasmic streaming.
Nucleoid
The bacterial nucleoid is unique because it is
neither enclosed in a nuclear membrane nor
associated with any nucleolus. It is a haploid
and replicates by simple ﬁssion. The nucleus of
the bacteria consists of a single circle of double-
stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) arranged
in a supercoiled circular structure. It measures
about 1000 μm when straightened.
The chromosome is located in an irregularly
shaped region called nucleoid but is often referred
to as a bacterial chromosome because of the anal-
ogy with the eukaryotic structure. The nucleoid is
visible through the light microscope after staining
with the Feulgen stain, speciﬁcally reacting with
DNA. In actively growing bacteria, the bacterial
DNA can account for up to 20% of the volume of
the bacterium and has projections that extend into
the cytoplasmic matrix. Careful electron micro-
scopic studies often have shown the nucleoid to
be in contact with either the mesosome or the
plasma membrane.

Bacterial Anatomy
293
Many bacteria also possess smaller circles of
extrachromosomal DNA called plasmids. The
plasmids are double-stranded DNA molecules,
usually circular, that can exist and replicate inde-
pendently. Plasmids are not required for host
growth and reproduction, although they may
carry genes that confer the bacterium with
properties such as antibiotic resistance or the
capacity to produce toxins or enzymes.
Additional Structures
Many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
possess a gel-like layer outside the envelope
when growing in their natural environments.
When a gel-like layer forms a well-deﬁned
condensed layer around the bacterial envelope, it
is called a capsule. The surface appendages of
some bacteria include surface appendages such as
ﬂagella and ﬁmbriae or pili.
Capsule
The capsule surrounding the bacteria is demon-
strable by a light microscope. When this gel-like
layer is narrower, detectable only by indirect
serological methods or by electron microscope
but not by light microscope, it is called a micro-
capsule. The capsule is mostly made up of
polysaccharides, often referred to collectively as
exopolysaccharides.
Exopolysaccharides
are
sometimes
neutral
homopolysaccharides
(e.g. the glucans and fructans of many oral
streptococci) or negatively charged (Table 22.2).
However, Bacillus anthracis has a capsule com-
prising of polyamine acids, such as D-glutamic
acid. The D-glutamic acid is probably analogous
to the negatively charged polysaccharide capsule.

Functions
The
capsule
has
various
functions.
(1)
It
contributes to the invasiveness of bacteria by
protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. (2) It
also prevents bacteria from generating an immune
response in infected hosts. (3) It facilitates adher-
ence
of
bacteria
to
surfaces.
Streptococcus
mutans, for example, owes its capacity to the
glycocalyx to adhere tightly to tooth enamel to
its glycocalyx. (4) It plays a role in forming
bioﬁlms.; and (5) the glycocalyx layer of the
capsule may also play a role in resistance to
desiccation.
Demonstration of Capsule
The capsule is fully hydrated and can be
demonstrated by light microscopy in either living
or stained bacteria as follows:
Special Capsular Staining Methods
These include the Welch method and M’Faydean
capsule stain.
Welch’s method uses copper as mordant. This
involves treating ﬁxed smear with hot crystal
violet solution followed by rinsing with copper
sulphate solution. The latter is used to remove the
excess stain because conventional washing with
water would dissolve the capsule. The copper salt
also gives colour to the background, with the
result that the cell and background appear dark
blue and the capsule of the bacteria a much paler
blue. Using polychrome methylene blue stain,
McFadyen capsule stain is a frequently used
method
for
demonstrating
the
capsule
of
B. anthracis.

294
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
Negative staining with India ink is also
known as the wet India ink method. It is the
simplest way to demonstrate a capsule. It is car-
ried out by mixing a suspension of bacteria with
an equal volume of Indian ink on a slide, covering
it with a coverslip, and examining it under a
microscope. The capsule appears as a clear zone
around the cell. This method is useful for improv-
ing the visualisation of encapsulated bacteria in
clinical samples, such as blood or cerebrospinal
ﬂuid.
Serologic methods are also used to demon-
strate
capsules
since
they
are
antigenic.
Quellung’s reaction is such a serological method
for demonstrating the capsule. When a suspen-
sion of bacterium is mixed with its speciﬁc
anticapsular serum and methylene blue and exam-
ined under a microscope, the capsule becomes
very prominent and appears swollen due to
increased refractoriness. This method is useful
for rapidly identifying capsular serotypes of
S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. inﬂuenzae,
Yersinia, Bacillus etc.
Slime Layer
An amorphous viscid colloidal material secreted
by some bacteria extracellularly is termed as
loose or free slime or glycocalyx. They are resis-
tant
to
proteolytic
enzymes
and
protein-
denaturing
agents.
The
slime
layer
protein
protects the cell from wall-degrading enzymes
and bacteriophages. It plays an important role in
maintaining cell shape, and it may also be
involved in cell adhesion to host epidermal
surfaces.
Surface Appendages
The surface appendages of the bacteria include
ﬂagella and ﬁmbriae or pili.
Flagella
Bacterial ﬂagella are thread-like appendages
intricately embedded in the cell envelope. These
structures are responsible for conferring motility
to the bacteria. The arrangement of ﬂagella varies
between different bacterial species.
Depending on the arrangement, ﬂagella can be
of the following types: Monotrichous (single
polar ﬂagellum), for example, Vibrio cholerae;
Lophotrichous (multiple polar ﬂagella), for
example,
Spirilla;
Peritrichous
(ﬂagella
distributed over the entire cell), for example, Sal-
monella typhi, E. coli and Amphitrichous (single
ﬂagellum at both the ends), for example, Spiril-
lum minus (Fig. 22.5).
Structure: The ﬂagella are 3–20 μm in length
and 0.01–0.03 μm in diameter. The main part of
the ﬁlament is made up of protein subunits called
ﬂagellin arranged in several helices around a cen-
tral hollow core. The ﬂagellum is attached to the
bacterial cell body by a complex structure
consisting of a hook and a basal body. The basal
body bears a set of rings, one pair in Gram-
positive bacteria and two pairs in Gram-negative
bacteria, through which the bacteria rotate either
in a clockwise or an anticlockwise direction.
Above the ﬁlament base is the hook, a short
curved structure between the external ﬁlament
and basal body. This part produces a propeller-
like repulsion from the revolving ﬂagellum
(Fig. 22.6).
Spirochetes are motile bacteria but without any
external ﬂagella. They are motile due to the pres-
ence of an axial ﬁlament. Axial ﬁlament consists
of a bundle of ﬂagellum-like structures between
the cell surface and an outer sheath and connects
one end of the cell to the other. They are some-
times called the endoﬂagellates.

Functions
Flagella are primarily responsible for the motility
of bacteria by chemotaxis. They may play a role
in bacterial survival and pathogenesis. They are
highly antigenic, possess H antigens, and some of
the immune responses to infection are directed
against these proteins. The ﬂagella of different
bacteria differ antigenically. Flagellar antibodies
are not protective but help in serodiagnosis.
Demonstration of Flagella
Direct and indirect methods can demonstrate the
ﬂagella.
Direct methods include a direct demonstra-
tion of the capsule by electron microscope.
These also include a demonstration of the capsule
after staining by special staining methods, such as
the Ryu method and Hugh–Leifson method.
Since ﬂagella are very thin structures, these
staining methods demonstrate ﬂagella by increas-
ing
their
thickness
by
mordanting
with
tannic acid.
Indirect methods of ﬂagella demonstration
include the bacteria’s motility by (1) dark-ground
microscopy,
(2)
hanging
drop
method
or
(3) observing spreading type growth on semisolid
media, such as mannitol motility medium.
Pili (Fimbriae)
Pili
or
ﬁmbriae are
synonymous
for
most
purposes. They are hair-like ﬁlaments that extend
from the cell surface and are found almost exclu-
sively on Gram-negative bacteria. They are com-
posed of structural protein sub-units termed
pilins.
Structure: The pili are shorter and straighter
than ﬂagella, although the basic structure is simi-
lar. Like ﬂagella, it consists of helices of a protein
called pilins. Minor proteins termed adhesins are
located at the tips of pili and are responsible for
the attachment properties. Pilins are arranged
around a hollow core but without a motor. They
are 0.5 μm long and 10 nm thick. They are anti-
genic. Pili haemagglutinate.
RBCs of guinea pigs are speciﬁcally inhibited
by mannose, based on which they are classiﬁed

R
into four types. Type 1, these occur in E. coli,
Klebsiella, Shigella and Salmonella. They are
mannose sensitive. Type 2 are present in Salmo-
nella
gallinarum
and
Salmonella
pullorum,
devoid of any haemagglutinating or adhesive
properties. Type 3 are present in some strains of
Klebsiella, Serratia etc. They agglutinate RBC
only after heating and are mannose resistant, and
Type 4 are mannose resistant and occur in
Proteus.
296
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
Sex pili is a specialised kind of pili responsible
for the attachment of donor and recipient cells in
bacterial conjugation. These pili are longer
(10–20 μm) and vary 1–4 in number. These are
of two types: F pili: They speciﬁcally adsorb
male-speciﬁc RNA and DNA bacteriophages.
They are encoded by sex factor F and fertility
inhibition-positive
resistance
factors
(ﬁ+
factors). I pili: They adsorb male-speciﬁc ﬁla-
mentous DNA phages, encoded by col. factor
and ﬁ—R factor.
Functions of Pili
Pili play a major role in the adherence of symbi-
otic and pathogenic bacteria to host cells, which is
a necessary step in initiating infection. Transfer of
bacterial DNA takes place through sex pili during
conjugation.
Demonstration of Pili
The pili can be detected directly by electron
microscope; and by agglutination of guinea pigs,
fowl, horses and pigs RBCs. They agglutinate
human and sheep RBCs weakly. The haemagglu-
tination can be speciﬁcally inhibited by
D-
mannose.
Some Gram-positive bacteria do not possess
typical pili but instead possess a ﬁne ﬁbrillar
arrangement of proteins on their surfaces known
as ﬁbrils. These ﬁbrils bind to the host surfaces.
M-protein of S. pyogenes is an example of Gram-
positive bacteria possessing ﬁbrils.
Bacterial Spores
Spores are highly resistant resting phase of some
of the bacteria. The organism survives in spores, a
dormant state, for longer periods of starvation and
other adverse conditions.
Sporulation is a primitive process of differen-
tiation
with
the
formation
of
endospores
(e.g. spores of aerobic Bacillus spp. and anaerobic
Clostridium spp.). The sporulation process begins
in nutrition-deprived conditions. It begins with
the formation of an axial ﬁlament. The process
continues with the infolding of the membrane to
produce a double membrane structure whose fac-
ing
surfaces
correspond
to
the
cell
wall-
synthesising surface of the cell envelope. Two
spore membranes then engage in the active syn-
thesis of special layers that form the cell enve-
lope: the spore wall and the cortex, lying outside
the facing membranes. In the newly isolated cyto-
plasm or core, many vegetative cell enzymes are
degraded and are replaced by a set of unique
spore constituents. During sporulation, each cell
forms
a
single
internal
spore;
the
spore
germinates to produce a single vegetative cell.
Morphology
The bacterial endospores are a highly resistant
resting phase of bacteria. The spore shows the
following structures:
1. Core: The core contains a complete nucleus
(chromosome), all of the components of the
protein-synthesising apparatus and an energy-
generating system based on glycolysis. The
heat resistance of spores is partly due to their
dehydrated state and the presence of large
amounts (5–15% of the spore dry weight) of
calcium dipicolinate in the core.
2. Spore wall: This is the innermost layer
surrounding the inner spore membrane. It
contains normal peptidoglycan and becomes
the cell wall of the germinating vegetative cell.
3. Cortex: It is the thickest layer of the spore
envelope containing unusual peptidoglycan.
It is extremely sensitive to lysozyme, and its
autolysis plays a role in spore germination.
4. Protein coat: It is composed of a keratin-like
protein
containing
many
intramolecular
disulphide bonds; this layer confers relative
resistance to antibacterial chemical agents
due to its impermeability (Fig. 22.7).

r
Physiology (Growth and Multiplication) of Bacteria
297
Fig. 22.7 Diagrammatic representation of bacterial spore
The spores may vary among different species
depending on the spores’ position, shape and
relative size. For example, spores may be central
(Bacillus), sub-terminal (Cl. perfringens) or ter-
minal (Cl. tetani); maybe oval (Cl. tertium) o
spherical (Cl. tetani) in shape; and maybe bulging
(Clostridium) or non-bulging (Bacillus).
Properties of Spores
Bacterial spores are resistant to ordinary boiling,
disinfectants and heating. Spores of all medically
important bacteria are destroyed by autoclaving at
121 C for 15 min. The conversion of a spore into
a vegetative cell under suitable conditions is
known as germination. The germination process
occurs in three stages: activation, initiation and
outgrowth.
Demonstration of Spores
Spores may be seen as refractile bodies in
unstained
preparations.
Spores
are
usually
demonstrated by staining with malachite green
or carbol fuchsin. In Gram staining, spores appear
as an unstained refractile body inside the cell. The
spores appear as red acid-fast bodies on staining
by modiﬁed ZN stain (using 0.25–0.5% sulphuric
acid instead of 20% sulphuric acid).
The spores have certain uses in clinical micro-
biology. The spores of Bacillus stearother-
mophilus are used to indicate proper sterilisation
by autoclaving. These spores are destroyed at a
temperature of 121 C for 10–20 min, the time
required for autoclaving. The spores of certain
bacteria, such as B. anthracis, are misused as
bioterrorism agents.
Physiology (Growth
and Multiplication) of Bacteria
Bacterial growth can be deﬁned as an orderly
increase of all the cell’s chemical components.
Cell multiplication is a consequence of growth
that increases the number of bacteria making up
a population or culture.

298
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
Multiplication
Most bacteria divide by binary ﬁssion, in which
the bacteria undergo cell division to produce two
daughter cells identical to the parent cell. Bacte-
rial growth can be equated to cell number: one
bacterium divides into two, these two produce
four, and then eight and so on. The growth rate
of a bacterium is therefore measured by measur-
ing the change in bacterial number per unit time.
During bacterial cell division, nuclear division
takes
place
before
cytoplasmic
separation.
Hence, dividing cells show two nuclear bodies
inside a single cell. The cytoplasmic division
occurs by constricting the plasma membrane or
developing the transverse septum across the cell.
Some of the bacteria arrange themselves in a
particular pattern because of the partial attach-
ment of the daughter cells after cell division.
Generation time is the time required for a
bacterium to give rise to two daughter cells
under optimum conditions. The generation time
for most pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli, is
about 20 min. The generation time is longer
(i.e. 20 h) for M. tuberculosis and the longest
(i.e. 20 days) for Mycobacterium leprae. A bacte-
rium replicates and multiplies rapidly, producing
millions of cells within 24 h. For example, E. coli
in about 7 h can undergo 20 generations and
produce 1 million cells. In about 10 h, it can
undergo 30 generations and produce 1 billion
cells and in 24 h produces 1021 cells (Fig. 22.8).
However, in actual practice, the multiplication of
bacteria is arrested after a few cell divisions due
to exhaustion of nutrients and accumulation of
toxic products.
Bacterial Growth
When grown in a small vessel containing a liquid
culture medium (batch culture), bacterial growth
is arrested after a few cycles of cell divisions due
to depletion of nutrient supplies or the accumula-
tion of toxic by-products of bacterial metabolism.
In certain research and industrial setups, mainte-
nance of a continuous culture of bacteria is
necessary, which can be accomplished with the
help of a chemostat or turbidistat. These are
special
devices
used
to
replenish
depleted
nutrients of the culture medium, and they also
remove toxic metabolic by-products along with
the dead bacterial cells.
Fig. 22.8 Generation time of the bacteria
In the case of pathogenic bacteria, the condi-
tion for multiplication inside the host tissue may

be intermediate between batch culture and contin-
uous culture; because the host may be a source of
inexhaustible nutrients, but its immune system
combats infection. In liquid culture, bacterial
growth is diffused, but each bacterial colony
represents a clone of cells derived from a single
parent cell in solid media.
Physiology (Growth and Multiplication) of Bacteria
299
Bacterial Growth Curve
When a broth culture is inoculated with a small
bacterial inoculum, the population size of the
bacteria increases showing a classical pattern.
The bacterial growth curve shows four distinct
phases (Fig. 22.9).
1. Lag phase: After a liquid culture broth is
inoculated, the multiplication of bacteria does
not start immediately. It takes some time to
multiply. The time between inoculation and
the beginning of multiplication is known as
the lag phase. In this phase, the inoculated
bacteria become acclimatised to the environ-
ment, switch on various enzymes and adjust to
the environmental temperature and atmo-
spheric conditions. During this phase, there is
an increase in the size of bacteria but no appre-
ciable increase in the number of bacterial cells.
The cells are active metabolically.
The duration of the lag phase varies with the
bacterial species, nature of culture medium,
incubation temperature etc. It may vary from
1 h to several days.
Fig. 22.9 Bacterial growth
curve
2. Log phase: This phase is characterised by
rapid exponential cell growth (i.e. 1 to 2 to
4 to 8). The bacterial population doubles dur-
ing every generation. They multiply at their
maximum rate. The bacterial cells are small
and uniformly stained. The microbes are sen-
sitive to adverse conditions, such as antibiotics
and other antimicrobial agents.
3. Stationary phase: After the log phase, the
bacterial growth almost stops completely due
to lack of essential nutrients, lack of water
oxygen, changes in pH of the medium etc.
and accumulation of their toxic metabolic
wastes. The death rate of bacteria exceeds the
rate of replication of bacteria. Endospores start
forming during this stage. Bacteria become
Gram variable and show irregular staining.
Many bacteria start producing exotoxins.
4. Decline phase: During this phase, the bacterial
population declines due to the death of cells.
The decline phase starts due to the accumula-
tion of toxic products and autolytic enzymes
and the exhaustion of nutrients. Involution
forms are common in this stage.
The total and viable counts plotted on the
bacterial growth curve run parallel up to the sta-
tionary phase. After that, viable count enters the

phase of decline, whereas total count continues
steadily without any phase of decline. However,
in the case of autolytic bacteria, even the total
count shows the phase of decline.

Bacteria undergo various morphological and
physiological changes during various phases of
the growth curve. Towards the end of the Lag
phase, bacterial cell attains maximum size. In the
Log phase, bacterial cells appear smaller and
stain uniformly. In the Stationary phase, bacte-
rial cells are Gram variable. In this phase, bacteria
possess plenty of intracellular storage granules
responsible
for
uneven
gram
staining
characteristics. Sporulation is common in this
phase. Most of the bacteria produce secondary
metabolites (e.g. exotoxins) and antibiotics. Invo-
lution forms are quite common in the phase of
decline.
The growth rate during different phases of the
bacterial
growth
curve
is
summarised
in
Table 22.3.
Continuous culture: It is a method of culture
useful for industrial and research purposes. This
is achieved by using a special device for
replenishing nutrients and continuously removing
the bacterial population so that bacteria growth is
not inhibited due to a lack of nutrients or the
accumulation of toxic bacterial metabolites.
Bacterial Counts
Microbial concentrations can be measured in
terms of (1) cell concentration (the number of
viable cells per unit volume of culture) or (2) bio-
mass concentration (dry weight of cells per unit
volume of culture). At a given time, the number
of bacteria can be estimated by performing a total
or viable count.
Total Count
This denotes the total number of bacteria in the
sample, irrespective of whether they are living or
dead. This can be obtained by (a) Counting
chambers can be used for direct counting under
the microscope. (b) Electronic devices such as
Coulter counter can be used for total count deter-
mination. (c) Stained smears prepared by spread-
ing the known volume of the culture over a
measured area on the slide are also used for direct
counting. (d) Absorptiometer or nephelometer
uses opacity measurement for total count calcula-
tion. (e) Relative numbers of bacterial cells in a
smear of a culture mixed with known numbers of
other cells can also be used to compare and deter-
mine the total cont. (f) Wet weight or dry weight
calculation: here, bacterial cells are separated by
either centrifugation or ﬁltration, and then wet or
dry weight is calculated to determine total count
by using appropriate formulae and (g) Chemical
assay of cell components such as nitrogen is also
being used for total count determination.
Viable Count
This usually indicates the number of living or
viable bacteria. This count can be obtained by
dilution or plating method.
•
In the dilution method, several tubes with
liquid culture media are incubated with vary-
ing dilutions of sample and the viable count is
calculated from the number of tubes showing
bacterial growth. In this method, the bacterial
suspension is diluted by using several tubes so
that at one point, a unit quantity of suspension
does not yield growth upon inoculation into
suitable liquid culture media (extinction). Fur-
ther, the viable count can be calculated using
suitable statistical methods based on the num-
ber of tubes showing growth. This method is
widely used in microbiological testing of water
for the presumptive coliform count in drinking
water.
•
In the plate method, a diluted sample is spread
on the surface of an agar plate. The number of
colonies that grow after a suitable incubation

Physiology (Growth and Multiplication) of Bacteria
301
time indicates the viable count of the bacteria.
The method described by Miles and Misra
(1938) is in common use, in which serially
diluted bacterial suspensions are poured on
the Petri plate containing solid medium and
colonies are counted to obtain the viable count.
Bacterial Nutrition
The minimum requirements for the growth of
bacteria include water, a source of carbon, a
source of nitrogen and certain inorganic salts.
These are required for the synthesis of proteins,
enzymes etc. For example, nitrogen is required to
synthesise proteins, DNA, RNA and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). Sulphur is required for cer-
tain amino acids and vitamins, and phosphorus is
required
for
nucleic
acids,
ATP
and
phospholipids. In addition, inorganic ions, such
as potassium, sodium, iron, magnesium, calcium
and chloride, are required to facilitate enzymatic
catalysis and maintain chemical gradients across
the cell membrane.
Some bacteria grow in a variety of simple
media. E. coli and other members of the family
Enterobacteriaceae are examples of bacteria that
can grow in a variety of simple media containing
the inorganic salts and with a source of energy,
the simplest being glucose. The inorganic salts in
the media provide major essential elements of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphate
and sulphur. These chemicals are usually present
in the media and are not added speciﬁcally.
On the other hand, H. inﬂuenzae and other
related bacteria are very fastidious and have cer-
tain growth requirements. They require certain
amino acids, vitamins and other growth factors
that are supplied by adding yeast extract and meat
digests to the media. They also require the addi-
tion of blood or serum for their growth.
Factors Affecting Growth of Bacteria
A variety of factors affect the growth of bacteria.
These are discussed in the subsequent sections:
Oxygen
Bacteria can be broadly classiﬁed into aerobic and
anaerobic based on their oxygen requirements.
Aerobic Bacteria
Aerobic bacteria are those which grow in the
presence of oxygen. They may be (1) Obligate
aerobes—which can grow only in the presence of
oxygen (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa); (2) Fac-
ultative aerobes—which are ordinary aerobes
but can also grow without oxygen (e.g. E. coli).
Most of the pathogenic bacteria are facultative
aerobes; and (3) Microaerophilic bacteria—
those bacteria that can grow in the presence of
low oxygen and the presence of low (4%) con-
centration of carbon dioxide (e.g. Campylobacter
jejuni).
Some
fermentative
organisms
(e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum) are aerotolerant
but do not contain the enzyme catalase or super-
oxide dismutase. Oxygen is not reduced, and
therefore hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nascent
oxygen (O2
) are not produced.
Anaerobic Bacteria
Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can grow
only in the absence of oxygen (e.g. Clostridium
botulinum, Clostridium tetani). These bacteria
lack the enzymes superoxide dismutase and cata-
lase; hence oxygen is lethal to these organisms.
The apparent oxygen toxicity of anaerobic
bacteria is a less understood mechanism. How-
ever, it is attributable to the accumulation of
hydrogen peroxide and other toxic peroxides
inside bacterial cells in the presence of oxygen.
Aerobic bacteria possess an enzyme called cata-
lase which converts harmful hydrogen peroxide
into harmless products, but anaerobes are devoid
of this enzyme. Another reason for apparent oxy-
gen toxicity is that obligate anaerobes possess key
enzymes of metabolism which work only in the
reduced state, that is, in the absence of oxygen.
Bacterial metabolism plays a key role in
understanding a bacterium’s oxygen-dependent
or
independent
nature.
In
aerobic
bacteria,

metabolic pathway intermediates and energy are
obtained only by oxidation, and oxygen serves as
the ﬁnal hydrogen acceptor molecule, while in
anaerobes ﬁnal hydrogen acceptor molecule will
be other than oxygen. Facultative anaerobes may
act vice versa. Aerobes use atmospheric oxygen
as the ultimate electron acceptor (aerobic respira-
tion); the complex carbon and energy source may
be completely oxidised to carbon and water, the
simpler molecules. During this process, energy is
generated by the production of energy-rich phos-
phate bonds and the conversion of adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) to ATP; this process is called
oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of anaer-
obic bacteria, nitrates or sulphates act as the ﬁnal
electron acceptor molecule instead of oxygen
(anaerobic respiration).
302
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
Anaerobic metabolism involves a series of
oxidoreduction
reactions;
here,
carbon
and
energy sources act as electron acceptors and
donors. This process is known as fermentation,
and it yields various organic end products such as
acids alcohols along with carbon dioxide and
hydrogen gas. Fermentation facilitates energy
production by forming energy-rich phosphate
bonds by adding organic phosphate into interme-
diate metabolites. This process is called sub-
strate-level
phosphorylation.
Further,
these
energy-rich phosphate bonds are utilised to con-
vert ADP into ATP.
Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Potential
It is a system that is very important in determining
bacterial growth. The redox potential of the sys-
tem indicates the readiness of all the components
of a system to take part with electrons. The redox
potential of a medium can be estimated by mea-
suring the electrical potential difference set up
between the medium and an unattackable elec-
trode immersed in it; this electrical potential is
measured in millivolts. On the other hand,
oxidation-reduction indicators such as methylene
blue can be used to measure the redox potential of
a medium by noting the colour change in the
medium. This is a simpler but less accurate
method of estimating the redox potential.
Carbon Dioxide
The organisms that require higher amounts of
carbon dioxide (CO2) for their growth are called
capnophilic bacteria. They grow well in the
presence of 5–10% CO2 and 15% O2. In a candle
jar, 3% CO2 can be achieved. Examples of such
bacteria include H. inﬂuenzae, Brucella abortus.
Temperature
The optimum temperature for most of the patho-
genic bacteria is 37 C. The optimal temperature,
however, is variable. Depending on their temper-
ature range, the growth of bacteria is grouped as
follows:
Psychrophiles
These bacteria are cold-loving microbes that grow
within a temperature range of 0–20 C. Most soil
and water saprophytes belong to this group.
Mesophiles
These are moderate temperature loving microbes
that grow between 25 and 40 C. Most pathogenic
bacteria belong to this group.
Thermophiles
These are heat-loving microbes. They can grow at
a
high-temperature
range
of
55–80
C.
B. stearothermophilus is an example.
Bacterial viability to temperature may vary
from one particular group of bacteria to other. In
sterilisation, heat is being used as one of the
important modalities of killing bacteria. Dry heat
kills bacteria by oxidation and charring, whereas
moist heat kills bacteria by coagulation and dena-
turation. Thermal death point: It is the lowest
temperature that kills a bacterium under standard
conditions
in
a
given
time.
Under
moist
conditions, the thermal death point of most of
the
vegetative,
mesophilic
bacteria
will
be
between 50 and 65 C, but spores have a higher
range of 100–120 C. A very few bacterial spe-
cies do not survive in low temperatures; other-
wise, most survive well. Bacterial specimens
stored in a refrigerator or deep freezer can be
easily revived. Rapid freezing by dry ice (solid

carbon dioxide) or storage and stabilisation with
glycerol reduces the risk of death of bacteria
during long-term storage.
Bacteriocins
303
pH
Most pathogenic bacteria grow between pH 7.2
and 7.6. Very few bacteria, such as lactobacilli,
can grow at acidic pH below 4.0. Many food
items, such as pickles and cheese, are prevented
from spoilage by acids produced during fermen-
tation. V. cholerae is an example of a bacteria that
can grow at an alkaline (8.2–8.9) pH.
Light
Depending on the source of energy bacteria make
use of, they may be classiﬁed as phototrophs
(bacteria deriving energy from sunlight) or
chemotrophs (bacteria deriving energy from
chemical sources).
Osmotic Pressure
Microbes obtain almost all their nutrients in solu-
tion from the surrounding water. Hence factors
such as osmotic pressure and salt concentration of
the solution affect the growth of bacteria. Bacte-
ria, by virtue of the mechanical strength of their
cell wall, can withstand a wide range of external
osmotic variations. Organisms requiring high
osmotic pressures are called osmophilic bacteria.
Sudden exposure of bacteria to a hypertonic solu-
tion may cause the withdrawal of water due to
osmosis, leading to shrinkage of the protoplasm
(plasmolysis). On the other hand, sudden transfer
of bacteria from the concentrated solution to dis-
tilled water may cause excessive imbibition of
water leading to swelling and bursting of the
cell (plasmoptysis).
Certain lower forms of bacteria fail to grow in
cell-free culture media and require living cells to
grow. Treponema pallidum and M. leprae are two
pathogenic bacteria that cannot grow in an artiﬁ-
cial culture media but can only be cultured when
inoculated into living animals.
Bacteriocins
In 1925, Gratia found the production of highly
speciﬁc antibiotic compounds produced from a
strain of E. coli that was active against another
strain of the same species. Later on, such
compounds produced by E. coli and other
members of Enterobacteriaceae were called by
the name colicin. Interestingly, the same phenom-
enon was observed in many other species of bac-
teria;
hence
these
colicin-like
substances
produced by various bacteria were called by a
generic name bacteriocin. Bacteriocin is a highly
speciﬁc antibiotic-like substance produced by
certain strains of bacteria which are active against
other strains of the same or different species.
Based on the species of origin, bacteriocins are
called by speciﬁc names such as colicins from
E. coli, pyocins from P. aeruginosa, megacins
from Bacillus megaterium and diphthericins
from C. diphtheriae.
Bacteriocins are made of proteins, but few of
them have associated lipopolysaccharide contents
derived from the bacteria’s cell wall producing
them. The bacteriocins resemble phages in many
aspects; they adsorb speciﬁc bacterial surfaces
targeting
speciﬁc
receptors,
even
some
bacteriocins and phages have similar receptor
sites on the bacterial cell wall. Under an electron
microscope, bacteriocins like pyocins appear like
the tail structures of phages. Hence, they may be
reﬂected as a product of the defective genome of
phages that had integrated with the bacteria’s
genome. Bacteriocins speciﬁcally kill certain
strains of the same species of bacteria; hence
these are used in bacterial typing of certain bacte-
rial species such as P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp.,
Shigella sonnei.
The presence of Col factors (colicinogenic
factor) determines the ability of bacteria to
synthesise bacteriocins. Col factors are episomes,
and they can be transferred from one bacterium to
another through transduction and conjugation.
Bacteria having col. factor can be induced for
bacteriocin production by certain physical and
chemical agents such as UV rays, nitrogen
mustard.

304
22
Introduction to Bacteriology
Bacteriocin typing scheme mainly depends
on the ability of the bacteriocin produced by the
test strain of bacteria to kill the standard indicator
strains of bacteria. On the other hand, in phage
typing, the sensitivity of the test strains to the
lytic action of the phage plays a major role. Gen-
erally, the plate diffusion technique is used for
bacteriocin typing. In this method, test strain is
inoculated as a broad streak at the centre of the
solid culture medium. After incubation, the
growth of the test bacterium should be scraped
off completely, and the remaining bacterial cells
are killed by exposing them to chloroform
vapour.
Further, standard
indicator
bacterial
strains are streaked right angles to the original
inoculum and plates are incubated. The pattern
of inhibition of standard strain indicates the bac-
teriocin type of the test bacterium.

Antimicrobial Therapy
23
Any chemical used in treatment, relief or prophy-
laxis of disease is deﬁned as a chemotherapeutic
drug or agent. When chemotherapeutic drugs are
given to control infection, the practice is termed
antimicrobial
chemotherapy.
Antimicrobial
drugs (also termed anti-infective drugs) are a spe-
cial class of compounds capable even in high
dilutions
of
destroying
or
inhibiting
microorganisms. The origin of modern antimicro-
bial drugs is varied.
Antibiotics are substances produced by the
natural
metabolic
processes
of
some
microorganisms that can inhibit or destroy other
microorganisms. Synthetic antimicrobial drugs
are
derived
from
dyes
or
other
organic
compounds
through
chemical
reactions.
Although division into these two categories has
been traditional, they tend to overlap because
most
antibiotics,
termed
semi-synthetic
antibiotics, are now chemically altered in the
laboratory. The current trend is to use the term
antimicrobic for all antimicrobial drugs, regard-
less of origin.
Antimicrobial drugs vary in their spectrum of
activities.
They
may
be
broad-spectrum
or
narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum
or extended-spectrum antibiotics are active
against a wider range of different microbes. For
example, tetracyclines are active against various
Gram-positive
and
Gram-negative
bacteria,
rickettsiae, mycoplasmas and even protozoa.
Narrow-spectrum
antibiotics
are
effective
against one or very few microbes. For example,
vancomycin is active against certain Gram-
positive bacteria (such as staphylococci and
enterococci) or griseofulvin, which is used only
against fungal skin infections.

used in clinical practice.
Mechanisms of Action of
Antimicrobials
Antimicrobial drugs may be bactericidal or bac-
teriostatic. Whereas a bacteriostatic drug and bac-
tericidal drugs kill bacteria. They are very much
useful in (1) life-threatening situations, (2) endo-
carditis, (3) patients with low polymorphonuclear
count (below 500 μL1) and (4) conditions in
which bacteriostatic drugs do not cause a cure.
Bacteriostatic drugs inhibit the growth of
bacteria but do not kill them. They depend on
the host defence mechanisms such as phagocytes
to kill the bacteria. Hence these drugs are not used
when the patient has too few neutrophils.
The mode of action of antimicrobial drugs
varies depending on its site of inhibition. Some
of the antimicrobials and their mode of action are
classiﬁed as follows:
Inhibition of Protein Synthesis
The majority of antibiotics inhibit translation and
prevent the formation of functional proteins

essential for cellular activities. These drugs target
different
steps
in
protein
synthesis.
Some
examples are:

cephalosporins
(a)
Tetracyclines, doxycycline, prevents the
binding of aminoacyl-tRNA by blocking
the A (aminoacyl) site of the 30S ribosome.
(b)
Aminoglycoside antibiotics like streptomy-
cin prevent the formation of the 30S initia-
tion complex. In contrast, Kanamycin and
tobramycin bind to the 30S ribosome but
block the formation of the larger 70S initia-
tion complex. Hygromycin B speciﬁcally
binds to the 30S subunit in a region that
contains the A, P and E sites of tRNA.
(c)
Erythromycin, a macrolide, binds to the 23S
rRNA component of the 50S ribosome and
interferes with the assembly of 50S subunits.
(d)
Lincomycin
and
clindamycin
inhibit
peptidyl transferase activity and prevent
elongation.
(e)
Puromycin acts as an analogue of the 3-
0-terminal
ends
of
aminoacyl-tRNA.
It
disrupts synthesis and leads to premature
chain termination.
Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis
Beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin and cepha-
losporin inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Like-
wise, glycopeptide antibiotics like vancomycin
also inhibit cell wall synthesis. These cell wall
synthesis inhibitors have a long history of use;
however, resistance to these groups has emerged
very rapidly due to misuse. Table 23.1 provides a
list of cephalosporins used in clinical practice.
Due to its characteristic four-membered beta-
lactam ring, the beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit
cross-linking of bacterial cell wall components
that essentially prevent the formation of a new
cell wall. In the absence of a cell wall, the cell
bursts due to osmotic pressures. The enzyme
beta-lactamase
degrades
the
antibiotic
and
protects the agent in some resistant bacteria.
In contrast, glycopeptide antibiotics like van-
comycin bind the acyl-D-ala-D-ala residues that
interlink two peptidoglycan layers of the cell
wall. This binding prevents layers from cross-
linking with each other and effectively reduces
the strength of the cell wall. It results in
dislodging of the cell wall and makes the cell
vulnerable to osmotic pressure.

Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis
Nalidixic acid and ﬂuoroquinolones are examples
of antibiotics that inhibit nucleic acid synthesis.
They belong to the group of antimicrobials
known as quinolones. These antibiotics bind to
the subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase,
thus preventing DNA coiling and inducing the
formation of cleavage complexes. This results in
the termination of the DNA synthesis process that
essentially stops the downstream mechanisms,
i.e. transcription and translations.
Action on the Bacterial Cell Membrane
Antibiotics (e.g. Nisin) and peptide antibiotics
(like Polymyxin B or E) bind to the Lipid II and
Lipid A of the cell membrane. Such binding alters
the membrane’s permeability by developing open
pores in the membrane (for Nisin) or preventing
the
respiratory
processes
occurring
on
the
membrane (for polymyxin B). It results in the
loss of cytoplasmic components through the
pore or prevents cellular respiration, which can
kill the cell.
Cellular target sites of antimicrobial drugs are
listed in Table 23.2 and Fig. 23.1.
Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs
Antibiotic resistance is seen more commonly in
hospital-acquired infections than in community-
acquired infections. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria
are
more
commonly
seen
in
hospital
environments due to the widespread use of
antibiotics in hospitals that are selected for these
bacteria. These hospital strains of bacteria are
characterised by developing resistance to multiple
antibiotics simultaneously. Common examples of
such strains of bacteria showing drug resistance
include hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus
and Gram-negative enteric bacteria, such as

Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Resistance to multiple antibiotics is mediated by
plasmid-carrying
several
genes
that
encode
enzymes responsible for the resistance.
308
23
Antimicrobial Therapy
Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance
There are many different mechanisms by which
microorganisms might exhibit resistance to drugs.
These are (1) production of enzymes, (2) produc-
tion of altered enzymes, (3) synthesis of modiﬁed
targets, (4) alteration of the permeability of cell
wall, (5) alteration of metabolic pathways and
(6) efﬂux pump (Fig. 23..2).
Resistance by bacteria against antibiotics may
be classiﬁed as of (1) non-genetic basis and
(2) genetic basis.
Non-genetic Basis of Resistance
Non-genetic basis of resistance plays a less impor-
tant role in the development of drug resistance:
1. Certain bacteria under ordinary circumstances
are usually killed by penicillins. However, if
Fig. 23..2 Schematic
diagram showing the
mechanisms of drug
resistance in antibiotics
they lose their cell wall and become protoplast,
these bacteria become non-susceptible to the
action
of
cell-wall-acting
drugs
such
as
penicillins.
2. In certain conditions, such as in the abscess
cavity, bacteria can be walled off, which
prevents drugs from penetrating effectively
into bacteria. However, surgical drainage of
pus makes these bacteria again susceptible to
antibiotics.
3. Presence of foreign bodies (such as surgical
implants and catheters) and penetration injury
caused by splinters and sharpeners make suc-
cessful antibiotic treatment more difﬁcult.
4. Non-replicating bacteria in their resting stage
are less sensitive to the action of cell wall
inhibitors
such
as
penicillin
and
cephalosporins. This is particularly true for
certain bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis which remains in the resting stage in
tissues for many years, during which it is
insensitive to drugs. However, when these
bacteria begin to multiply, they become sus-
ceptible to antibiotics.

Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs
309
Genetic Basis of Drug Resistance
The genetic basis of drug resistance, mediated by
a genetic change in bacteria, is most important in
developing drug resistance in bacteria. This is
broadly of three types: (1) chromosome-mediated
resistance, (2) plasmid-mediated resistance and
(3) transposon-mediated resistance.
Chromosome-Mediated Resistance
Chromosome-mediated resistance occurs as a
result of spontaneous mutation. This is caused
by a mutation in the gene that codes for either
the target of the drug or the transport system in the
membrane of the cell wall, which controls the
entry of drugs into cells. The frequency of chro-
mosomal mutation is much less than the plasmid-
mediated resistance. It varies between 107 and
109.
Mutational resistance in M. tuberculosis is of
much importance in treating tuberculosis. Treat-
ment
of
tuberculosis
with
two
or
more
antitubercular drugs is carried out to prevent the
emergence of multi-drug resistance in tuberculo-
sis. This is based on the principle that it is most
unlikely that the bacterium, M. tuberculosis,
becomes
concurrently
resistant
to
all
the
antibiotics given simultaneously. There is a less
likely resistant mutation because on treatment
with
antitubercular
drugs,
a
mutant
of
M. tuberculosis resistant to one drug, and it
appears, will be destroyed by the other drug.
Plasmid-Mediated Resistance
Plasmid-mediated drug resistance in bacteria
occurs by the transfer of plasmid and genetic
materials. It is mediated by a resistance plasmid,
otherwise known as the R factor.
R Factors
These
are
circular,
double-stranded
DNA
molecules that carry the genes responsible for
resistance
against
various
antibiotics.
These
factors may carry one or even two or more resis-
tant genes. The genes encode various enzymes
that
destroy
the
antibiotics
by
degrading
antibiotics or modifying the membrane transport
systems. For example, the genes code for
enzymes like β-lactamases that destroy the
β-lactam
ring
(responsible
for
the
anti-
bactericidal action of β-lactam antibiotics, such
as penicillins and cephalosporins).
Plasmid-mediated resistance plays a very
important role in antibiotic usage in clinical prac-
tice. This is because a high rate of transfer of
plasmids from one bacterium to another occurs
by conjugation, plasmids mediate resistance to
multiple antibiotics, and plasmid-mediated resis-
tance occurs mostly in Gram-negative bacteria.
Transposons-Mediated Drug Resistance
Drug resistance is also mediated by transposons
that often carry the drug resistance genes.
Transposons are small pieces of DNA that move
from one site of the bacterial chromosome to
another and from the bacterial chromosome to
plasmid DNA. Many R factors carry one or
more transposons.
Specific Mechanisms of Resistance in
Antibiotics
Vancomycin
Resistance to vancomycin is mediated by change
in the D-ALA-D-ALA part of peptide in the pepti-
doglycan to D-ALA-D-lactate. This results in the
inability of vancomycin to bind to the bacteria.
Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus spp. has
been increasingly documented in different clini-
cal conditions.
Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE)
The ﬁrst VRE was detected in 1986 in the
European countries (the United Kingdom and
France), and later in the United States, an Entero-
coccus faecalis clinical isolate was reported for
VanB resistance. VRE has been reported and
documented in many other countries such as
Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada and
Malaysia. However, the human VRE infections
incidence rate is comparatively lower (1–3%) in
European countries than in the United States,
where the rate is high and alarmingly increasing.
In enterococci, seven types of glycopeptide
resistance have been documented, namely, the

VanA, VanB, VanC, VanD, VanE, VanG and
VanL, which are described based on their speciﬁc
ligase genes (e.g. vanA, vanB). Related gene
clusters have been found in non-pathogenic
organisms. The common end point of these
phenotypes is the formation of a peptidoglycan
precursor
with
decreased
afﬁnity
for
glycopeptides, resulting in decreased inhibition
of
peptidoglycan
synthesis.
Peptidoglycan
precursors ending in the depsipeptide D-alanyl-
D-lactate are produced in VanA, VanB and
VanD strains, whereas VanC, VanE and VanL
(recently described in an E. faecalis strain)
isolates produce precursors terminating in D-ala-
nyl-D-serine, instead of the normally occurring D-
alanyl-D-alanine.
310
23
Antimicrobial Therapy
The vanA gene cluster was originally detected
in the Tn1546 transposon. These or related
genetic elements are usually carried by plasmids
and occasionally by host chromosomes; this
plasmid-borne transposon has also been found in
clinical trials isolates of S. aureus (vancomycin-
resistant S. aureus strains).
In enterococci, the glycopeptide resistance is
categorised into the intrinsic class (characteristic
of species) and the acquired class. The intrinsic
class is the characteristic of the motile species
such as Enterococcus casseliﬂavus/ﬂavescens
and
Enterococcus
gallinarum,
members
of
which carry the naturally occurring vanC-1 and
vanC-2/vanC-3
genes,
respectively.
These
enterococci show variable minimum inhibitory
concentrations
(MICs)
of
vancomycin,
with
many falling in the susceptible range, and clinical
failures have been reported following vancomy-
cin use. In general, the isolation of these species
does not require strict infection control isolation
procedures unless they are highly resistant,
suggesting the added presence of potentially
transferable vanA or vanB genes.
Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(VRSA)
In 1997, the ﬁrst clinical isolate of S. aureus with
diminished susceptibility to vancomycin (strain
Mu50) was described in Japan. This strain
displayed a vancomycin MIC of 8 μg/mL, which
is in the range of intermediate susceptibility
(4–8 μg/mL) as per the current Clinical and Lab-
oratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints. It
thus was referred to as vancomycin-intermediate
S. aureus (VISA) or glycopeptide-intermediate
S. aureus (GISA).
Others from various countries followed this
initial report. The precursors of these VISA
isolates are the heteroresistant-VISA (hVISA or
hGISA) with sub-populations of cells that can
grow at a vancomycin concentration of 8 μg/
mL. As of late 2008, nine clinical isolates of
VRSA harbouring the enterococcal vanA gene
have been described in the United States, with
MICs ranging from 32 to 1024 μg/mL.
Aminoglycosides
Three important mechanisms mediate resistance
to aminoglycosides.
1. Plasmid-dependent
resistance
to
aminoglycosides enzymes is the most impor-
tant mechanism. It depends on the production
of
plasmid-mediated
phosphorylating,
adenylating and acetylating enzymes that
destroy the drugs.
2. Chromosomal
resistance
of
microbes
to
aminoglycosides is the second mechanism.
Chromosomal mutation in genes results in
the lack of a speciﬁc protein receptor on the
30S subunit of the ribosome, essential for
binding the drug.
3. A “permeability defect” is the third mecha-
nism of resistance. This leads to an outer mem-
brane change that reduces the active transport
of the aminoglycoside into the cell so that the
drug cannot reach the ribosome. Often this is
plasmid-mediated.
Tetracyclines
Resistance
to
tetracyclines
occurs
by
three
mechanisms: (1) efﬂux, (2) ribosomal protection
and (3) chemical modiﬁcation. The ﬁrst two are
the most important. Efﬂux pumps, located in
the bacterial cell cytoplasmic membrane, pump
the drug out of the cell. Tet gene products protect
the ribosome, possibly through mechanisms that
induce conformational changes. These conforma-
tional changes either prevent the binding of the

tetracyclines or cause their dissociation from the
ribosome. This is often plasmid controlled.
Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs
311
Macrolides
Resistance to macrolides, such as erythromycin,
is caused by a plasmid-encoded enzyme that
methylates the 23S ribosomal RNA, thereby
blocking the binding of the drug.
Sulphonamides and Trimethoprim
Resistance to sulphonamide is caused by a
plasmid-mediated transport system that actively
exports the drug out of bacteria. It is also caused
by a chromosomal mutation in the gene that codes
for the target enzyme dihydrofolate synthetase,
resulting in a reduced binding afﬁnity of the drug.
Resistance to trimethoprim is caused by a
chromosomal mutation in the gene coding for
dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces
dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate.
Quinolones
Quinolone resistance occurs mainly due to chro-
mosomal mutations that modify the bacterial
DNA gyrase. Resistance is also caused by
changes in the outer membrane proteins of the
bacteria, which results in reduced uptake of the
drugs into bacteria.
Penicillins and Cephalosporins
Three mechanisms mainly mediate resistance to
penicillin: (1) production of penicillin-destroying
enzymes, (2) mutation genes coding for PBP and
(3) reduced permeability to the drug.
1. Production of Penicillin-Destroying
Enzymes (β-Lactamases)
Resistance to penicillins may be determined by
the
organism’s
production
of
penicillin-
destroying
enzymes
(β-lactamases).
β-lactamases, such as penicillinases and cephalos-
porinases, open the β-lactam ring of penicillins
and cephalosporins and abolish their antimicro-
bial activity. β-lactamases have been described
for many species of Gram-positive and Gram-
negative
bacteria.
Some
β-lactamases
are
plasmid-mediated
(e.g.
penicillinase
of
S. aureus), while others are chromosomally
mediated (e.g. many species of Gram-negative
bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter
spp., Pseudomonas spp.).
Certain species of Gram-negative bacilli, such
as Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli, produce
one particular group of β-lactamases. These
enzymes confer bacteria the ability to hydrolyse
the β-lactam rings of cefotaxime, ceftazidime or
aztreonam and hence described as extended-
spectrum-lactamases.
2. Mutation in Genes Coding for PBP
This form of resistance occurs due to the absence
of some penicillin receptors (PBP) and occurs due
to chromosomal mutation. Both low-level and
high-level resistance that is seen in Streptococcus
pneumoniae to penicillin G and S. aureus to
nafcillin is due to this mechanism.
3. Reduced Permeability to Drug
Low-level resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoea to
penicillin is caused by poor permeability of the
drug. However, high-level resistance is mediated
by a plasmid coding for penicillinase.
Cephalosporins are resistant to β-lactamases in
varying degrees.
Metronidazole
Metronidazole is a bactericidal drug that acts by
inhibiting DNA synthesis. It is effective against
anaerobes and protozoa.
Chloramphenicol
Microorganisms
resistant
to
chloramphenicol
produce
the
enzyme
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase that destroys drug activity. A
plasmid usually mediates the production of this
enzyme.
Antitubercular Drugs
Antitubercular drugs include isoniazid, ethambu-
tol, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin.
Isoniazid is a bacteriostatic agent. It penetrates
well into the tissue ﬂuid and also acts on intracel-
lular organisms. Resistance to isoniazid is mainly
due to the loss of enzyme catalase that activates
isoniazid
to
active
metabolites
that
inhibit
mycolic acid synthesis.

312
23
Antimicrobial Therapy
Ethambutol acts by interfering with RNA
metabolism. The bacteria develop resistance due
to mutation in the gene coding for arabinosyl-
transferase, which synthesises arabinogalactan in
the mycobacterial cell wall. Rifampin inhibits
RNA synthesis. The bacteria develop resistance
due
to
mutation
in
the
gene
coding
for
DNA-dependent
RNA
polymerases.
Pyrazinamide resistance is due to mutation of
the gene coding for bacterial amidase, which
converts it to its active form, pyrazinoic acid.
Therefore, combination therapy in tuberculo-
sis is essential to prevent the emergence of drug
resistance.
Carbapenems
Production of Carbapenemases, Including
NDM Metallo-Beta-Lactamase
New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is
an enzyme produced by bacteria and causes resis-
tance to a broad range of bacteria range of beta-
lactam
antibiotics.
They
also
comprise
the
carbapenem family of antibiotics, the mainstay
of antibiotics used to treat antibiotic-resistant bac-
terial infections. The gene coding for the NDM-1
enzyme is one of the constituents of a large gene
family coding for the carbapenemases, a beta-
lactamase enzyme. The “superbugs” are those
bacteria
producing
carbapenemases
whose
infections are difﬁcult to treat, and generally,
they are sensitive to polymyxins and tigecycline.
The
ﬁrst
NDM-1
was
reported
in
a
K. pneumoniae clinical isolate in 2008 from an
Indian-origin Swedish patient. Later, it was found
in bacteria isolated from clinical samples of vari-
ous countries such as Japan, India, Pakistan,
United Kingdom, United States, Canada and
Brazil.
The
Gram-negative
bacilli,
such
as
E. coli and K. pneumoniae, are the most common
bacteria known to produce the NDM-1 enzyme;
however, the gene responsible for this enzyme
can transfer from one bacterial strain to another
via horizontal gene transfer.
The NDM-1 was named after New Delhi, the
capital city of India, as it was ﬁrst described by a
Swedish national who was sick with an antibiotic-
resistant bacterial infection acquired in India in
December 2009. This patient was not treated with
antibiotics in a New Delhi hospital, but his infec-
tion was not cured. However, soon after his return
to Sweden, the K. pneumoniae strain was
identiﬁed with the novel gene for carbapenem
resistant, following which a new mechanism of
resistance was established stating that “clearly
arose in India, but there are few data arising
from India to suggest how widespread it is”,
though, the exact geographical region for the
resistance has not been conﬁrmed. On the other
hand, a study conducted during March 2010 from
a Mumbai hospital detected carbapenem-resistant
bacterial isolates in patients mostly of blaNDM-
1 gene.
In May 2010 in the United Kingdom, an indi-
vidual from Coventry was reported with E. coli
infection expressing the NDM-1 gene. The
patient was of Indian origin and had undergone
dialysis
treatment
in
India
approximately
18 months ago. The bacterium was highly resis-
tant to all antibiotics in the initial tests, but later, it
was found to be susceptible to colistin and
tigecycline.
Hence,
the
utilisation
of
many
nations’ healthcare systems by the international
traveller and patients is believed to be the reason
for the “rapid spread of NDM-1 gene with poten-
tially serious consequences.”
Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing
Antibiotic sensitivity testing is carried out to
determine the appropriate antibiotic agent for a
particular bacterial strain isolated from clinical
specimens. Antibiotic sensitivity testing can be
carried out by diffusion or dilution methods, as
follows:
Disc Diffusion Tests
Disc diffusion tests are the most commonly used
methods in a laboratory to determine the suscep-
tibility of bacteria isolates to antibiotics. In this
method, as the name suggests, discs impregnated
with known concentrations of antibiotics are
placed on an agar plate that has been inoculated

with a culture of the bacterium to be tested. The
plate is incubated at 37 C for 18–24 h. After
diffusion, the concentration of antibiotics usually
remains higher near the site of the antibiotic disc
but decreases with distance. Susceptibility to the
particular antibiotic is determined by measuring
the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth around
the disc (Fig. 23.3).
Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing
313
Selection of media: The medium that supports
both test and control strains is selected for anti-
biotic susceptibility testing of the bacteria. For
example, Mueller–Hinton agar is used for test-
ing Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus
spp., blood agar for Streptococcus spp. and
Enterococcus spp. species, chocolate agar for
Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae
and
Wellcotest
medium for sulphonamides and cotrimoxazole.
The medium is prepared by pouring onto the
ﬂat horizontal surface of Petri dishes of
100 mm to a depth of 4 mm. The pH of the
medium is maintained at 7.2–7.4. More alka-
line pH increases the activity of tetracyclines,
novobiocin and fusidic acid, whereas an acidic
pH reduces the activity of aminoglycosides
and macrolides, such as erythromycin. The
plates after preparation may be stored at 4 C
for up to 1 week.
Preparation of the inoculum: For testing the
antibiotic sensitivity, the bacteria are ﬁrst
isolated in pure culture on a solid medium.
At least three to four morphologically similar
bacteria colonies to be tested are touched and
inoculated into the appropriate broth and
incubated at 37 C for 4–6 h. The bacterial
suspension density in the broth is adjusted to
1.5  108 cfu/mL by comparing its turbidity
with that of 0.5 McFarland opacity standard
tube. The broth is inoculated on the medium
by streaking with sterile swabs. A sterile cot-
ton swab is dipped into the broth, and excess
broth is removed by rotation of the swab
against the sides of the tube above the ﬂuid
level.
Antibiotic
discs:
Only
clinically
relevant
antibiotics are tested in antibiotic susceptibility
tests. Antibiotic discs (6-mm ﬁlter paper discs)
can be prepared from pure antimicrobial
agents in laboratories or obtained commer-
cially. The discs are applied with sterile for-
ceps, a sharp needle or a dispenser onto the
surface of the medium, streaked with test
strains, and the reading is reported after
incubating the plate for 18–24 h at 37 C
aerobically.
Types of Disc Diffusion Tests
Disc diffusion tests are of the following types:
Kirby–Bauer Disc Diffusion Method
Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method is the most
common method used routinely to determine the
antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from
clinical specimens. Both test and control strains
are tested in separate plates in this method.
The test is performed by inoculating the test
organism in a suitable broth solution, followed by
incubation at 37 C for 2–4 h. Then 0.1 mL of the
broth is inoculated on the surface of the agar
medium by streaking with a sterile swab. This
method uses either nutrient agar or Mueller–
Hinton agar in Petri dishes. The inoculated
medium is incubated overnight at 37 C. The
susceptibility of the drug is determined from the
zones
of
inhibition
of
bacterial
growth
surrounding the antibiotic discs. The diameters
of the zone of inhibition are calculated with ver-
nier callipers or a thin transparent millimetre scale
to the nearest millimetre. The point of abrupt
diminution of the zone is considered the zone
edge. A maximum of six antibiotic discs are
tested in a Petri dish of 85 mm size (Fig. 23.4).
Interpretation of the zone size is made as per
the interpretation chart. Bacteria can be consid-
ered
sensitive,
intermediate
or
resistant
to
antibiotics depending on the zone size.
Stokes Method
This is a disc diffusion method, which uses built-
in controls against many variables. In this
method, the Petri dish containing the Mueller–
Hinton agar is partitioned into three equal parts
horizontally. The test strain is inoculated in the
central portion of the plate, whereas the control
strain is inoculated in the upper and lower third

portion of the plate. However, in the modiﬁed
Stokes method, the control strain is inoculated in
the central part, but test strains are inoculated on
the upper and lower third of the plate. The plates
are incubated at 37 C and observed for zones of
bacterial inhibition around the discs (Fig. 23.5). A
maximum of six antibiotic discs can be applied on
a 100 mm Petri dish.

The result is reported by comparing the zones
of inhibition of test and control bacteria. The zone

sizes are measured from the edge of the disc to the
edge of the zone. It is interpreted as follows:
Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing
315
Fig. 23.5 Schematic diagram showing Stokes method of
antibiotic sensitivity
Sensitive (S): The zone of the test bacterium is
equal to or more than that of the control strain.
The differences between the zone sizes of con-
trol and test strains should not be more than
3 mm if the zone size of the test bacterium is
smaller than that of control.
Intermediate (I): The zone size of the test bacte-
rium should be at least 2 mm, and the
differences between the zone of test and con-
trol strain should be at least 3 mm.
Resistant (R): The zone size of the test bacterium
is 2 mm or less.
Interpretation of Disc Diffusion Tests
Results of disc diffusion tests, such as Kirby–
Bauer and Stokes method, are interpreted as
follows:
Sensitive (S): Infection treatable by the normal
dosage of the antibiotic.
Intermediate (I): Infection may respond to a
higher dosage.
Resistant (R): Unlikely to respond to the usual
dosage of the antibiotics.
However, for certain bacteria and antibiotic
discs, the following may be kept in mind while
interpreting results of disc diffusion tests:
1. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and other
bacteria producing swarming produce a thin
ﬁlm on the agar surface, often extending into
inhibition zones. In such situations, the zones
of swarming should be ignored, and the clear
outer margin should be measured to determine
the zones of inhibition.
2. Many strains of MRSA grow very slowly in
the presence of methicillin. They produce
growth within the zone of inhibition on incu-
bation for more than 48 h. This problem can be
overcome by incubating the bacteria at 30 C
or by using 5% salt agar and incubating at
37 C.
3. Penicillinase-producing
Staphylococcus
strains often fail to secrete enough enzymes
to neutralise penicillin close to the antibiotic

316

disc. In such a situation, it may show a zone of
inhibition, but with the presence of large
colonies at the edge of the zone and without
any gradual fading away of the growth of the
bacteria towards the disc. In such conditions,
the zones of inhibition should not be consid-
ered, and they should be reported resistant
irrespective of the zone size.
4. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole should be
tested separately to know whether the bacte-
rium is sensitive to both or only to one of
these. These should never be tested in combi-
nation, the way these two drugs are used in
combination in clinical practice.
Dilution Tests
Dilution tests are performed to determine the MIC
of an antimicrobial agent. MIC is deﬁned as the
lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent
that inhibits the growth of organisms. Estimation
of the MIC is useful to a) regulate the therapeutic
dose of the antibiotic accurately in the treatment
of many life-threatening situations, such as bacte-
rial endocarditis and b) test antimicrobial sensi-
tivity patterns of slow-growing bacteria, such as
M. tuberculosis. Following methods are carried
out to determine the MIC.
Broth Dilution Method
The broth dilution method is a quantitative
method for determining the MIC of an antimicro-
bial agent that inhibits the growth of organisms
in vitro. In this method, the antimicrobial agent
has serially diluted in Mueller–Hinton broth by
doubling dilution in tubes and then a standard
suspension of the broth culture of the test organ-
ism is added to each of the antibiotic dilutions and
control tube. This is mixed gently and incubated
at 37 C for 16–18 h. An organism of known
susceptibility is included as a control. The MIC
is recorded by noting the lowest concentration of
the drug at which there is no visible growth, as
demonstrated by the lack of turbidity in the tube.
The main advantage of this method is that this is a
simple procedure for testing a small number of
isolates.
The
added
advantage
is
that
the
bacteria’s minimum bactericidal concentration
(MBC) can be determined using the same tube.
The MBC is determined by sub-culturing from
each tube, showing no growth on a nutrient agar
without any antibiotics. Sub-cultures are made
from each tube, showing no growth into the nutri-
ent agar plates without any antibiotics. The plates
are examined for growth, if any, after incubation
overnight at 37 C. The tube containing the low-
est concentration of the drug that fails to show
any growth on the sub-culture plate is considered
as the MBC of the antibiotic for that strain. Broth
dilution may be of two types—macrodilution and
microdilution. Broth microdilution is done using
microtiter plates and is considered the “gold
standard.”
Agar Dilution Method
The Agar dilution method is a quantitative
method for determining the MIC of an antimicro-
bial agent against the test organism. It is useful to
test organisms from serious infections like bacte-
rial endocarditis or to verify equivocal results of
the disc diffusion test.
Mueller–Hinton agar is used in this method.
Serial dilutions of the antibiotic are made in agar
and poured onto Petri dishes. Dilutions are made
in distilled water and added to the agar melted and
cooled to not more than 60 C. One control plate
is inoculated without antibiotics. The organism to
be tested is inoculated and incubated overnight at
37 C. Plates are examined for the presence or
absence of growth of the bacteria. The concentra-
tion at which bacterial growth is completely
inhibited is considered the MIC of the antibiotic.
The organisms are reported sensitive, interme-
diate or resistant by comparing the test MIC
values with CLSI guidelines. The method’s
main advantage is that many organisms can be
tested simultaneously on each plate containing an
antibiotic solution.
Epsilometer Test (E-test)
Epsilometer test (E-test), based on the principle of
disc diffusion, is an automated system for mea-
suring the MIC of a bacterial isolate. In this
method, a plastic absorbent strip is immobilised

with a continuous gradient of antibiotics on one
side. On the other side, MIC interpretative scale is
used corresponding to 15 twofold MIC dilutions.
This strip is then placed on an agar plate
inoculated with the test organism with the MIC
scale facing towards the opening side of the plate.
An elliptical zone of growth inhibition is seen
around the strip after incubation at 37 C over-
night. The MIC is read from the scale at the
intersection of the zone with the strip. The end
point is always read at complete inhibition of all
growth, including hazes and isolated colonies.
E-test is a very useful test for easy interpretation
of the MIC of an antibiotic (Fig. 23.6).
Antibiotics Assays in Body Fluids

Pramodhini)
Antibiotics Assays in Body Fluids
Antibiotics assays are carried out to demonstrate
antibiotics’ toxic and therapeutic levels in the
blood and other body ﬂuids. In this method, the
MIC of the antibiotic for the test organism is done
ﬁrst by the standard broth dilution method. The
test with the patient’s serum is done concurrently.
Serial dilutions of the patients’ serum in nutrient
broth are carried out, and to each, a standard drop
of culture is added and incubated for 18 h. The
highest dilution of serum which has inhibited the
growth of the assay organism is noted. This is
equivalent to the MIC of the antibiotic in ques-
tion. Multiplication of the MIC by the serum
dilution gives the antibiotic concentration that
was present in the patient’s undiluted serum.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial
Diseases
24
The clinical manifestations of bacterial diseases
may be non-speciﬁc and protean. Nevertheless,
they provide a clue in the diagnosis of bacterial
diseases. Laboratory diagnosis, therefore, plays
an important role in conﬁrming the bacterial
aetiology of suspected bacterial infections.
The procedures for the laboratory diagnosis,
including identiﬁcation of bacteria, involve the
steps of (1) microscopic demonstration of bacteria
in clinical specimens, (2) culture and isolation of
bacteria in the culture media or laboratory
animals, (3) identiﬁcation of bacteria based on
their growth characteristics in medium, and bio-
chemical characteristics followed by antibiotic
sensitivity, (4) detection of speciﬁc bacterial
antigens and antibodies in serum and various
other body ﬂuids, (5) detection of nucleic acids
of bacteria by molecular techniques, (6) typing of
bacterial strains and (7) rapid identiﬁcation
methods.
The
identiﬁcation
of
bacteria
is
supplemented by automation methods wherever
applicable.
Conventional Tests in Diagnostic
Bacteriology
Microscopy
The wet mount preparation is useful for
demonstrating the motility of bacteria by light
microscopy or demonstration of spirochetes by
dark-ground microscopy. Stained preparations
are used to demonstrate structural details of the
bacteria by producing colour contrast.

Staining Methods
Various staining techniques are used in the
microscopy of bacteria.
Simple Stains
Methylene blue and basic fuchsin are simple
stains that provide colour contrast but impart the
same colour to all the bacteria in a smear.
Negative Stains
Bacteria are mixed with dyes, such as Indian ink,
that produce a uniform dark-coloured background
against which the unstained organisms stand out
in contrast. This is used to demonstrate the bacte-
rial capsule that is usually not stained by simple
stains. India Ink method for demonstration of the
capsule is a common example.
Impregnation Stains
Cells and structures that are too thin to be
visualised by the light microscope can be ren-
dered visible by the impregnation of silver on
their surface. The silver impregnation method is
common for staining spirochetes, such as Trepo-
nema pallidum, Leptospira, Borrelia.
Differential Stains
Differential stains impart different colours to dif-
ferent bacteria or different bacterial structures.

The commonly used differential stains include
Gram stain, acid-fast stain and Albert stain.
320
24
Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
1. Gram Stain
Gram stain was devised by Christian Gram, a
Danish microbiologist, in 1884, as a convenient
method for classifying bacteria. Gram stain also
provides useful information on the structure of
bacterial cell envelopes.
Principle
The exact mechanism of Gram reaction is
unclear, but various theories have been put for-
ward. Gram-positive bacteria’s protoplasm is
more acidic than Gram-negative bacteria so it
may be the reason for the strong binding of the
basic primary dye to Gram-positive bacterial pro-
toplasm. The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria
is made up of a thick peptidoglycan layer, which
enables Gram-positive bacteria to retain the dye–
iodine complex. The Gram-negative bacterial cell
wall is rich in lipid content. Thus, decolourisation
with organic solvents like acetone makes way for
secondary dye contents.
Decolourisation is an important step in Gram
staining because prolonged decolourisation may
damage Gram-positive bacterial cell walls and
make them appear Gram-negative. On the other
hand, inadequate decolourisation may cause all
cells to appear Gram-positive.
Procedure
1. Heat ﬁx the slide, followed by Primary
staining with basic dyes, such as methyl violet,
crystal violet, for about 1 min.
2. Application of mordant in the form of a dilute
solution of iodine for a minute.
3. Decolourisation with ethanol, acetone or ani-
line (10–30 s).
4. Counterstaining with acidic dyes, such as
carbol fuchsin, safranine or neutral red for
30 s.
Gram staining is an essential procedure that is
used in the identiﬁcation of bacteria. The stain
differentiates bacteria into two broad groups.
Gram-positive bacteria are those that resist
decolourisation and retain the primary dye–iodine
complex, appearing violet. They have a relatively
thick amorphous wall and more acidic proto-
plasm, which retain the basic violet dye and
iodine complex within the cell. Gram-negative
bacteria are decolourised by organic solvents and
take
counterstain,
appearing
red.
The
decolourising agent, such as acetone or ethanol,
used during staining disrupts this membranous
envelope, and the dye and iodine complex is
washed out of Gram-negative bacteria.
Application
It is an essential and routine protocol used in
diagnostic microbiology. Since Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria have different growth
requirements, antibiotic susceptibility and patho-
genicity, proper Gram staining and interpretation
play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment.
There are certain groups of bacteria, such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium
leprae that cannot be considered typical Gram-
negative or Gram-positive bacteria. This is
because these bacteria either do not take up the
Gram stain or have a different envelope type.
These mycobacteria possess a waxy envelope
containing complex glycolipids that make them
impervious to the Gram stain.
2. Acid-Fast Stain
The acid-fast stain was discovered by Ehrlich,
who found that after staining with aniline dyes,
tubercle bacilli resist decolourisation with acid.
The method was modiﬁed by Ziehl and Neelsen
subsequently; hence it is widely known as Ziehl–
Neelsen (ZN) stain.
Principle
Acid fastness is due to the (1) high content of
lipids, fatty acids, components of mycolic acid,
and (2) higher alcohols found in the cell wall of
the Mycobacterium. Acid fastness also depends
on the integrity of the cell wall.
Procedure
1. Fixed smears are ﬁrst stained by a strong
carbol fuchsin with heat application. Heating
facilitates the entry of phenolic carbol fuchsin
stain into the bacteria.

Conventional Tests in Diagnostic Bacteriology
321
2. It is then decolourised with 5–20% (depending
on the bacteria to be stained) sulphuric acid.
3. It is then counterstained with a contrasting
dye, such as methylene blue. The acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) retain the red colour of carbol
fuchsin and appear bright red in stained
smears. On the other hand, pus cells and epi-
thelial cells present in the smear take up the
blue
colour
of
the
counterstain
and
appear blue.
Application
The ZN smear is best used for staining bacteria
such as M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, Nocardia and
Actinomyces. It is also used for staining of
oocysts of intestinal coccidian parasites (such as
Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora).
3. Albert Stain
Albert stain is used for staining the volutin
granules of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
Principle
Volutin granules of C. diphtheria have an afﬁnity
for basic dyes and are called metachromatic
granules. These granules are stained bluish-
black against green protoplasm on staining by
Albert stain.
Procedure
1. Fixed smears are stained with Albert I stain;
excesses stain is drained and washed.
2. Pour excess Albert II stain on the slide to cover
the smear entirely.
3. Remove the excess stain and observe under
microscopy.
Application
They are used to identify C. diphtheriae, the
causative agent of diphtheria. These bacilli
arrange themselves in V or L form. At the poles
of these bacteria, metachromatic granules are
present, which takes up Albert stain and helps in
easy identiﬁcation. Metachromatic granules are
also called polar bodies, volutin or Babes-
Ernst granules. These granules can also be
stained by Neisser and Ponder staining technique.
Culture
Laboratory diagnosis of an infection is usually
conﬁrmed
by
isolating
and
culturing
microorganisms in artiﬁcial media. Bacteria are
cultured in either liquid (broth) or solid (agar)
artiﬁcial media.
Culture Media
Koch pioneered the use of agar as a base for
culture media. He developed the pour plate
method and was the ﬁrst to use solid culture
media for the culture of bacteria. At ﬁrst, Koch
cultured bacteria on the sterile surfaces of cut,
boiled potatoes. This was unsatisfactory because
bacteria would not always grow well on potatoes.
He then tried to solidify regular liquid media by
adding
gelatine.
Separate
bacterial
colonies
developed after the surface had been streaked
with a bacterial sample. The sample could also
be mixed with liqueﬁed gelatine medium. After
hardening the medium, separate colonies were
produced by individual bacteria present in the
sample.
Although
gelatine
has
several
advantages, it has few drawbacks to be used as a
solidifying agent, as gelatin was digested by most
bacteria and melted if the temperature rises above
28
C.
One
of
Koch’s
assistants,
Fannie
Eilshemius Hesse, the wife of Walther Hesse,
provided an easy alternative material for the gela-
tin problem. She recommended agar instead of
gelatin as a solidifying agent, which she had been
using to make jellies. Agar does not melt until the
temperature reaches 100 C and is not digested by
bacteria. Also, the Petri dish (plate), a container
for solid culture media, was developed by
Richard Petri, one of Koch’s assistants.
Ingredients of Culture Media
The basic constituents of culture media include
the following.
1. Agar
Agar is the main component used universally for
the preparation of solid media. It is obtained from
various seaweeds and, after necessary processing,
is usually available as a powder or as long shreds.

Agar has a unique property of melting at 98 C
and solidifying at 42 C. The jellifying property
of agar varies depending on the type of agar used
(e.g. New Zealand agar is more jellifying than
Japanese agar). Agar does not have any nutritive
value and is also not affected by the growth of
bacteria.
322
24
Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Agar is usually used in a concentration of
2–3%. Agar is hydrolysed at high temperatures
and high acid or alkaline pH.
2. Peptone
Peptone is another important ingredient of cul-
tural media. It is a complex mixture of partially
digested proteins. It is obtained by digestion of
lean meat or other protein materials (such as heart
muscle, casein, ﬁbrin or soy ﬂour) with proteo-
lytic enzymes (e.g. pepsin, trypsin or papain).
Peptone is an important source of nutrition for
bacteria to grow. It contains peptones, proteoses,
amino acids, inorganic salts (phosphates, potas-
sium and magnesium) and certain accessory
factors such as nicotinic acid and riboﬂavin.
Neopeptone and protease peptone are special
types of peptones with high nutritive value.
3. Other Ingredients
Other common media ingredients include water,
sodium chloride and other electrolytes, meat
extract, yeast extract, malt extract, blood and
serum. Meat extract is available commercially as
Lab-Lemco.
It
contains
inorganic
salts,
carbohydrates, certain growth factors and protein
degradation products. Blood or serum is usually
used for enriching the culture of bacteria. Usually,
5–10% deﬁbrinated sheep, or human blood
is used.
Types of Culture Media
Culture media can be classiﬁed into several ways
as follows:
1. Liquid Media, Semi-Solid Media
and Solid Media
The media depending on their consistency can be
liquid media, semi-solid media and solid media.
Liquid Media
Liquid media provide greater sensitivity for the
isolation of small numbers of microorganisms.
Examples of liquid media include peptone, nutri-
ent broth, sugar media and enrichment media.
Liquid media offer a few other advantages.
Mixed cultures identiﬁcation in liquid media
need
further
sub-culturing
on
solid
media;
hence,
individual,
isolated
colonies
can
be
processed and identiﬁed. Quantiﬁcation of bacte-
rial growth cannot be done ordinarily in liquid
media. Bacteria grown in liquid cultures often
form colloidal suspensions. Uses of some com-
mon liquid media are summarised in Table 24.1.
Solid Media
Agar is used as a solidifying agent in most culture
media. By varying the agar concentration, it is
possible to make the medium solid or semi-solid.
However, somewhat less sensitive than liquid
media, solid media provide isolated colonies that
can be quantiﬁed and identiﬁed. Some genera and
species of bacteria can be recognised based on
their colony morphologies.
Nutrient agar (Fig. 24.1) prepared by adding
2% agar to nutrient broth is the simplest and most
common medium used routinely in diagnostic
laboratories. The composition and uses of some
common
solid
media
are
summarised
in
Table 24.2.
Semi-Solid Media
The addition of a reduced concentration of agar
(0.2–0.4%) makes the medium semi-solid, which
facilitates the spread of the bacteria in the
medium. Examples of semi-solid media are man-
nitol motility medium and other motility testing
mediums.
2. Simple, Complex, Synthetic
and Special Media
Simple, complex, synthetic and special media are
the different types of media used for bacteria
culture.

Simple Media
The simple or basal media include nutrient broth
and peptone water, which form the basis of other
media.
The nutrient broth is an example of a simple
liquid medium that consists of peptone, meat
extract, sodium chloride and water. Adding
0.5% glucose to a nutrient broth makes it glu-
cose broth.
Nutrient agar is an example of a simple solid
medium. The medium is used routinely to
isolate many bacteria from clinical specimens.

Pramodhini)
Complex Media
Most of the media other than basal media are
usually known as complex media [e.g. chocolate
agar, MacConkeyagar, Robertson cooked meat
(RCM)
medium,
Lowenstein–Jensen
(LJ) medium]. Complex media have some com-
plex ingredients, consisting of many chemicals in
unknown proportions. This is an undeﬁned
medium because the amino acid source contains
various compounds with the exact composition
unknown.

Synthetic Media
A deﬁned medium, also known as synthetic
medium,
contains
known
quantities
of
all
ingredients. All the chemicals used are known,
and they do not contain any animal, yeast or plant
tissue. These media consist of trace elements,
vitamins,
and
deﬁned
carbon
and
nitrogen
sources required by certain microbes. Glucose or
glycerol is often used as carbon sources and
ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitrogen
sources.
Dubos medium with Tween 80 is an example of
this medium.
Special Media
These include (1) enriched media, (2) enrichment
media, (3) selective media, (4) indicator or differ-
ential media, (5) transport media and (6) sugar
media.
Enriched Media
The enriched media are invariably solid media
that facilitate the growth of certain fastidious bac-
teria. These media are prepared by adding
substances like blood, serum and egg to the
basal media to meet the nutritional requirements
of more exacting and more fastidious bacteria.
Blood agar, chocolate agar, Loefﬂer serum slope
(LSS) and LJ medium are examples of enriched
media. Blood agar is an enriched medium in
which nutritionally rich whole blood supplements
constitute the basic nutrients. The blood agar
media heated slowly to 75 C, turned brown
colour, and hence is named chocolate agar.
1. Brain–heart infusion broth (BHIB): It is a
highly nutritive media composed of nonenzy-
matic infusion from calf brain and cow heart
along with peptones and dextrose. It can be
used as a regular media and is also useful in
isolating more fastidious bacteria. Brain–heart
infusion agar can be obtained by adding agar
to the broth.
2. Blood agar: As the name suggests, blood is an
integral part of blood agar, and the remaining
composition is the same as nutrient agar.
Sheep, horse, cow and pig blood are the source
of blood. In India, sheep blood is commonly
used for blood agar preparation. Blood agar is
a solid, enriched and non-selective medium. It
is widely used for routine diagnostic purposes
and supports the growth of aerobic and anaer-
obic bacteria and certain fungi. In the case
of certain Gram-positive cocci, blood agar is
used to assess haemolysis; thus, blood agar
acts as a differential media. Haemolysis on
blood agar can be categorised into three types
(Fig. 24.2):

Conventional Tests in Diagnostic Bacteriology
325
Fig. 24.2 Blood agar
showing beta haemolytic
colonies of group A
Streptococci
(a)
Beta haemolysis: Certain bacteria such
as Staphylococcus aureus show complete
lysis of red blood cells and haemoglobin
around their colonies on blood agar. This
kind of clear haemolysis is called beta
haemolysis.
(b)
Alpha haemolysis: Certain bacteria such
as viridans streptococci show partial lysis
of red blood cells and haemoglobin
around their colonies on blood agar,
resulting in greenish discolouration. This
kind of partial, greenish discolouration is
regarded as alpha haemolysis.
(c)
Gamma
haemolysis:
In
gamma
haemolysis,
there
will
not
be
any
haemolysis around the bacterial colonies
grown on a blood agar medium.
3. Chocolate agar: This solid medium is similar
in composition to blood agar, but because of
heating, contents of RBCs leak out and give
chocolate colour to the medium; hence it is
called chocolate agar. During heating, RBCs
release substances like haemoglobin, haemin
(X factor) and nicotinamide adenine dinucle-
otide (V factor) into the medium. These
contents are necessary for isolating fastidious
organisms such as Haemophilus inﬂuenzae,
Neisseria
meningitides,
Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, Moraxella spp. etc.
Enrichment Media
Enrichment media are liquid media that stimulate
the growth of certain bacteria or suppress the
growth of others for isolation of desired patho-
genic bacteria. Commensal bacteria, such as
Escherichia coli present in faeces tend to over-
grow pathogenic ones in stool specimens. In such
situations, enrichment media (such as selenite-F
broth or tetrathionate broth) are used to isolate
Salmonella Typhi and Shigella spp. from faeces.
Enrichment media are useful for isolating wanted
bacteria from the stool and other specimens
containing more than one species of bacteria.
Selective Media
These are solid media that contain substances that
inhibit the growth of all but a few bacteria but at
the same time facilitate isolation of certain
bacteria:
Thayer-Martin medium: This medium is used
to
isolate
N.
gonorrhoeae
from
clinical
samples selectively. It contains 3.0 mg vanco-
mycin, 7.5 mg colistin and 12.5 units of nysta-
tin per millilitre of agar. These antimicrobials
at this concentration suppress the growth of
microorganisms other than N. gonorrhoeae.
LJ medium: It is used for the Mycobacterial
culture. LJ medium is an egg-based medium
consisting of hen’s eggs, mineral salts, aspara-
gine, glycerol and malachite green. Malachite
green inhibits most of the microorganisms
present
in
the
sputum,
thus
selectively
supporting the growth of the Mycobacterium
on the LJ medium. LJ medium is the primary
isolation medium for Mycobacterium, and

ology laboratories are summarised in Table 24.3.
Indicator or Differential Media
Indicator or differential media distinguish one
microorganism from another growing on the
same media by their growth characteristics.
These
media
depend
on
the
biochemical
properties of a microorganism growing in the
presence of speciﬁc nutrients or indicators such
as neutral red, phenol red, eosin or methylene
blue. The medium changes colour when a bacte-
rium grows in them. For example, S. typhi grows
as black colonies on Wilson and Blair’s medium
containing sulphite. With respect to certain
media, terms used for media can be interchange-
able. For example, blood agar is an enriched
media, but it can also differentiate haemolysis
produced by the Gram positive. Thus, blood
agar can be called enriched and/or differential
media. Eosin methylene blue (EMB), the medium
used for differential for lactose and sucrose fer-
mentation, and MacConkey, differential for lac-
tose fermentation are a few examples.
MacConkey
agar:
Primary
use
of
MacConkey
agar
is
to
differentiate
Gram-
negative bacteria based on their ability to ferment
lactose present in the medium. It also inhibits the
growth
of
Gram-positive
bacteria.
Lactose
fermenting bacteria such as E. coli produce pink
colonies, whereas non-lactose fermenting bacte-
ria such as Salmonella spp. form pale or
colourless
colonies
on
MacConkey
agar
(Fig. 24.3). Fermentation of lactose in the
medium makes it acidic and leads to the forma-
tion of pink colonies in the presence of neutral
red.
Transport Media
Transport media are used to maintain the viability
of
certain
delicate
organisms
in
clinical
specimens during their transport to the laboratory.
They typically contain only buffers and salt. They
lack carbon, nitrogen and organic growth factors,
and hence do not facilitate microbial multiplica-
tion. Stuart transport medium for N. gonorrhoeae
is an example.
Sugar Media
Sugar media contain 1% “sugar”, which in micro-
biology denotes any fermentable substance such
as glucose, sucrose, lactose and mannitol rou-
tinely used for fermentation tests. It consists of
1% sugar in peptone. The indicator used in sugar
media is the Andrade indicator that consists of
0.005% acid fuchsin in 1 N NaOH. The produc-
tion of acid after fermentation of sugar is

indicated by the change of colour of the medium
to pink due to the presence of an indicator. Dur-
ham tube is kept inverted inside the sugar tube to
demonstrate gas production. Production of gas is
indicated by the demonstration of gas bubbles in
the Durham tube.
Conventional Tests in Diagnostic Bacteriology
327

Anaerobic Media
These media support the growth of anaerobic/
facultative anaerobic bacteria.
RCM medium is routinely used for anaerobic
bacterial culture. Further, the identiﬁcation of
anaerobic bacteria requires special media to
demonstrate
their
biochemical
properties.
Neomycin blood agar is also commonly used
in anaerobic culture; it helps to isolate the
bacteria grown in RCM.
Thioglycolate medium is semi-solid. It supports
the growth of aerobes, facultative anaerobes
and anaerobes at the top, middle and bottom
of the medium, respectively. This medium
forms an oxygen gradient from top to bottom,
thus facilitating the growth of organisms of all
oxygen requirements. This medium is boiled
and cooled before use to eliminate its oxygen.
It contains an oxygen indicator that turns pink
or blue if exposed to oxygen. The stab culture
method is used to inoculate this medium.
Incubation of Culture Media
For bacteria, two agar plates should be inoculated
and kept both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions
at 37 C for a minimum of 48 h. Aerobic culture
can usually be regarded as negative if no growth
is present after 48 h of incubation. In the case of
anaerobic culture, 7 days of incubation is sufﬁ-
cient to declare no growth. If Propionibacterium
acnes is suspected, anaerobic culture plates
should be incubated for 14 days. Nowadays,

dehydrated media are available for wide use in
diagnostic laboratories because of the simplicity
of procedure and are less cumbersome to prepare.
These dehydrated media are prepared by simply
reconstituting in distilled water and sterilising it
before use.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Culture Methods
Culture methods are very crucial in a microbiol-
ogy laboratory. Various culture methods are car-
ried out to (1) isolate bacteria in pure culture and
identify the same by performing various tests,
(2) demonstrate biochemical, antigenic and other
phenotypic and genomic properties of the isolated
colonies. (3) demonstrate the susceptibility of the
isolated bacteria to antibiotics, bacteriophages,
bacteriocins etc. (4) prepare antigens for various
uses; and (5) maintain stock culture.
Methods of Culture for Aerobic Bacteria
Various methods are used for culturing of bacte-
ria. These include (1) streak culture, (2) lawn
culture, (3) pour-plate culture, (4) stroke culture,
(5) stab culture and (6) liquid culture.
1. Streak Culture
Streak culture is the most useful method for
obtaining discrete bacteria colonies. It is carried
out by streaking on the surface of a solid media
plate using a platinum or nichrome loop of
2–4 mm diameter.
In this method, a loopful of the inoculum is
placed near the peripheral area of the plate. The
inoculum is then spread with the loop to about
one-fourth of the plate with close parallel strokes.
From the primary inoculum, it is spread thinly
over the plate by streaking with the loop in paral-
lel lines. The loop is ﬂamed and cooled between
the streaks to obtain isolated colonies. The
inoculated culture plate is incubated at 37 C
overnight to demonstrate colonies. Conﬂuent
growth occurs at the primary inoculum but
becomes
progressively
thinner,
and
well-
separated colonies are demonstrated on the ﬁnal
streaks of the inoculum. Single isolated colonies
obtained by this method are very useful for study-
ing various bacteria properties.
2. Lawn Culture
The lawn culture provides a uniform layer of
bacterial growth on a solid medium. It is carried
out by ﬂooding the surface of the solid media
plate with a liquid culture or suspension of bacte-
ria, pipetting off the excess inoculum and ﬁnally
incubating the plate overnight at 37 C. Alterna-
tively, the culture plate may be inoculated by a
sterile swab soaked in liquid bacterial culture or
suspension and incubated overnight to demon-
strate the bacterial colonies.
The lawn culture method is useful (1) to carry
out antibiotic sensitivity testing by disc diffusion
method, (2) to carry out bacteriophage typing,
and (3) to produce a large amount of bacterial
growth required to prepare bacterial antigens
and vaccines.
3. Pour-Plate Culture
The pour-plate culture is used to determine an
approximate number of viable organisms in
liquids, such as water or urine. It quantiﬁes bacte-
ria in urine cultures and estimates the viable bac-
terial count in a suspension.
This method is carried out in tubes containing
15 mL of molten agar. The molten agar in tubes is
left to cool in a water bath at 45 C. The inoculum
to be tested is diluted in serial dilution. Then 1 mL
each of diluted inoculum is added to each tube of
molten agar and mixed well. The contents of
tubes are poured into sterile Petri dishes and
allowed to set. After overnight incubation of
these
Petri
dishes
at
37
C,
colonies
are
distributed
throughout
the
medium’s
depth,
which can be counted using a colony counter.
4. Stroke Culture
Stroke culture provides a pure growth of bacteria
for carrying out slide agglutination and other
diagnostic tests for bacterial pathogenicity. It is
carried out in tubes usually containing nutrient
agar slopes.
5. Stab Culture
Stab culture is prepared by stabbing the medium
in tubes with a long, straight wire and incubating
at 37 C. Stab culture is frequently used for

(1) maintaining stock cultures, (2) demonstration
of oxygen requirement of bacteria and (3) demon-
stration of gelatin liquefaction of bacteria.
Conventional Tests in Diagnostic Bacteriology
329
6. Liquid Culture
Liquid culture is prepared in liquid media
enclosed in tubes, ﬂasks or bottles. The medium
is inoculated by touching with a charged loop or
adding the inoculum with pipettes or syringes and
incubating at 37 C, then subculturing onto solid
media for ﬁnal identiﬁcation.
Liquid culture is speciﬁcally used (1) for blood
culture and for sterility tests, where the concen-
tration of bacteria is expected to be mallei (2) for
the culture of specimens containing antibiotics
and other antibacterial substances, as these are
rendered ineffective by dilutions in the medium,
and (3) when large yields of bacteria are required.
A major disadvantage of liquid culture is that it
does not provide a pure culture of the bacteria,
and also, the bacterial growth does not exhibit
special characteristic appearances.
Methods of Culture for Anaerobic Bacteria
Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only
in the absence of oxygen. These anaerobes are
killed when exposed to the atmosphere for as
brieﬂy as 10 min. Some anaerobes are tolerant
to small amounts of oxygen. On the other hand,
facultative anaerobes are those anaerobes that
grow with or without oxygen.
Anaerobic bacterial culture is used to grow
anaerobes from a clinical specimen. Culture and
identiﬁcation of anaerobes are essential for
initiating appropriate treatment. The failure to do
so may have serious consequences, such as ampu-
tation, organ failure, sepsis, meningitis and even
death.
1. Specimen Collection
Specimens frequently used for anaerobic culture
include (1) blood, bile, bone marrow, cerebrospi-
nal ﬂuid, direct lung aspirate and tissue biopsy
from a normally sterile site; (2) ﬂuid aspirated
from a normally sterile site, such as a joint;
(3) pus specimens from a dental abscess, burn
wound,
abdominal
or
pelvic
abscess;
and
(4) specimens from the knife, gunshot or surgical
wounds.
Collecting a contamination-free specimen and
protecting it from oxygen exposure during collec-
tion forms the mainstay of anaerobic culture. The
specimens must be obtained from an appropriate
site without contaminating the sample with bacte-
ria from the adjacent skin, mucous membrane, or
tissue.
Abscesses or ﬂuids are usually collected using
a sterile syringe and then tightly capped to pre-
vent air entry. Tissue samples are placed into a
degassed bag and sealed or into a gassed-out
screw-top vial that may contain oxygen-free
pre-reduced culture medium and tightly capped.
The specimens need to be plated as rapidly as
possible onto culture media to isolate bacteria.
Swabs are always avoided when collecting
specimens for anaerobic culture because cotton
ﬁbres may be detrimental to anaerobes. Coughed
throat discharge (sputum), rectal swab, nasal or
throat swab, urethral swab and voided urine are
some of the specimens that are not suitable for
processing anaerobic cultures.
2. Culture Media
The commonly used media for anaerobic culture
include
Robertson
cooked
meat
broth,
thioglycolate broth, Willis and Hobbs media and
neomycin blood agar. Robertson cooked meat
(RCM) broth is the most widely used medium in
an anaerobic culture. It consists of nutrient broth
and pieces of fat-free minced cooked meat of ox
heart with a layer of sterile liquid parafﬁn over
it. Unsaturated fatty acids and even glutathione
and cysteine in the meat extract utilise oxygen for
auto-oxidation. The medium before inoculation is
usually boiled at 80 C in a water bath to make the
medium free of oxygen. The media after inocula-
tion and incubation allows the growth of even
strict anaerobes and indicates their saccharolytic
or proteolytic activities as meat is turned red or
black, respectively.
Methods of Anaerobiasis
Anaerobic cultures are carried out in an environ-
ment free of oxygen, followed by incubation at
95 F (35 C) for at least 48 h before the plates are

examined for growth. The cultures of anaerobic
bacteria are carried out as follows:
330
24
Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
(a)
McIntosh and Fildes anaerobic jar: It is
the most
widely used
and dependable
method of anaerobiosis. It consists of a
glass or metal jar with a metal lid that can
be clamped airtight with the help of a screw.
The lid has one inlet tube and another outlet
tube. The outlet tube is connected to a vac-
uum pump by which the air is evacuated out
of the jar. The inlet tube is connected to a
source of hydrogen supply. The lid has two
electric terminals also that can be connected
to an electric supply. The underside of the lid
contains a catalyst (e.g. alumina pellets
coated with palladium) that catalyses the
combination of hydrogen with residual oxy-
gen present in the air. This method ensures
complete anaerobiosis.
The culture media are inoculated with the
specimens suspected to contain anaerobic
bacteria. The inoculated media are then
kept inside the jar, and the lid is closed
airtight. The anaerobiosis in the jar is carried
out by ﬁrst evacuating the air from the jar
through an outlet tube with the help of a
vacuum pump. The outlet tube is closed,
and then the sealed jar containing the culture
plates is replaced with hydrogen gas and
passed through the inlet tube till reduced
atmospheric pressure is brought to normal
atmospheric pressure, which is monitored on
the vacuum gauge as zero. The electrical
terminals are then switched on to heat the
catalyst that catalyses a combination of
hydrogen with residual oxygen and ensures
complete anaerobiosis in the jar.
Reduced methylene blue is used as the indi-
cator of anaerobiosis in the jar. If anaerobio-
sis is complete, it remains colourless; if
anaerobiosis is not complete, it turns blue
on exposure to oxygen.
(b)
Gaspack system: It is a simple and effective
method of production of hydrogen gas for
anaerobiosis. It does not require the cumber-
some evacuation method and gas ﬁling after
evacuation. Carbon dioxide, which is also
generated, is required for growth by some
anaerobes. Water activates the gas pack sys-
tem, resulting in hydrogen and carbon diox-
ide production. Hydrogen combines with
oxygen in the air in the presence of a catalyst
and maintains anaerobiosis. In this method,
the inoculated plates are kept along with the
gas pack envelope with water added in the
airtight jar.
It is the method of choice for preparing
anaerobic jars. It is commercially available
as
a
disposable
envelope
containing
chemicals that produce hydrogen and carbon
dioxide by adding water.
(c)
Anaerobic glove box: This innovation is
developed to isolate anaerobic bacteria. It
uses a clear-vinyl large chamber with gloves
attached to it and is supplied with a gas
mixture of 80% nitrogen, 10% carbon diox-
ide and 10% hydrogen. A lock is ﬁtted at one
end of the chamber with two hatches, one for
the outlet and the other for the inlet to the
chamber. After placing specimens in the
lock, the outlet hatch is closed, and the air
is exchanged with the gas mixture in the
lock. The inlet hatch is opened then to
bring the specimen into the chamber.
(d)
Anoxomat: This is a fully automated system
that evacuates a portion of the jar contents
and reﬁlls the jar with an anaerobic gas
mixture. During this procedure, the oxygen
concentration in the air is rareﬁed. For an
anaerobic atmosphere, this procedure is
repeated three times, after which the oxygen
concentration is rareﬁed to 0.16%. A small
catalyst removes this very small percentage
of oxygen content. Anoxomat is capable of
producing micro-aerophilic conditions also.
The method is increasingly used to process
clinical
specimens
to
isolate
anaerobic
bacteria.
Other Methods of Anaerobiosis
These include the following methods.
(a)
Reducing agents: Inclusion of reducing
agents
such
as
1%
glucose,
0.1%
thioglycolate,
0.1%
ascorbic
acid
and

Laboratory Identification of Bacteria
331
0.05% cysteine into the culture medium
would reduce the oxygen concentration of
the medium, in turn favouring an anaerobic
environment.
(b)
Broth: The addition of pieces of red-hot
metallic iron into the broth and layering it
with sterile vaseline creates an anaerobic
environment
inside
the
broth.
Culture
medium
like
Smith-Noguchi
medium
contains fresh animal tissues, which facili-
tate reduced environment within the medium
and supports the growth of many anaerobes.
(c)
Agar
concentration:
Slightly
increased
agar concentration reduces the oxygen diffu-
sion into the medium, facilitating anaerobic
bacterial growth.
Methods of Isolating Pure Cultures
The methods used to isolate pure cultures are
listed below.
1. Surface plating technique is routinely used for
bacterial isolation in diagnostic bacteriology.
Isolated colonies of interest are further used
for biochemical or molecular identiﬁcation.
2. Enrichment, selective and indicator media
play an important role in isolating pathogenic
organisms from clinical samples such as faeces,
which consist of numerous normal ﬂorae.
3. Pre-treatment of specimens with speciﬁc bac-
tericidal substances destroys unwanted normal
ﬂora without harming the integrity of the
organism of our interest. For example, in
Mycobacterium culture, sputum samples need
alkali treatment to kill the abundant commen-
sal ﬂora present in them. However, this
pre-treatment does not affect Mycobacterium
cell integrity.
4. Incubation at different temperatures can
also be used to isolate certain bacteria in pure
culture. For example, Neisseria catarrhalis
can be separated from N. meningitides by
incubating the mixed culture at 22 C, as this
temperature is suitable only for the growth of
N. catarrhalis.
5. Heating is used to isolate Clostridium tetani
from dust or similar sources. Heating kills all
vegetative forms of bacteria, but only spores of
spore-forming bacteria survive, which can be
isolated by culture.
6. Craigie tube is used to separate motile bacte-
ria from non-motile bacteria.
7. Animal inoculation is also a good old method
for isolating pathogenic bacteria from a clini-
cal sample or mixed culture. For example,
Anthrax bacilli can be identiﬁed from other
sporulating, non-pathogenic, aerobic bacteria
by inoculating into a suitable animal model.
Only anthrax bacilli can multiply and cause
fatal septicaemia. Further, it can be cultured
from heart blood.
8. Selective ﬁlters are used to separate different
sizes of bacteria. Usually, bacterial ﬁlters are
used to separate viruses from bacteria.
Laboratory Identification of Bacteria
It
is
not
always
possible
to
identify
microorganisms by microscopic methods alone
due to the similarity of bacteria in their morphol-
ogy and staining characters. Hence, further study
of microorganisms is essential for their identiﬁca-
tion. For this purpose, organisms have been
grown in artiﬁcial media in the laboratory.
Conventional Tests in Diagnostic
Bacteriology
The
identiﬁcation
of
bacteria
involves
the
following steps: (1) morphology of bacterial col-
ony on solid medium, (2) growth in a liquid
medium, (3) Staining
reactions, (4) Hanging
drop preparations, (5) biochemical reactions,
(6) animal pathogenicity testing in laboratory
animals, (7) antibiotic sensitivity, (8) typing of
bacterial strains, (9) serology and (10) rapid bed-
side tests.
Morphology of Bacterial Colony on Solid
Medium
Morphology of the bacterial colony on solid
medium depends on many factors, such as nature
of culture medium, temperature and time of

incubation,
age
of
culture
and
number
of
subcultures done.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Fig. 24.4 Ziehl–Neelsen
staining to differentiate
acid-fast bacilli from non-
acid-fast bacilli
The characteristics noted include (1) Size: The
colonies may be a few millimetres in size: pinhead
size (S. aureus) or pinpoint (streptococci). (2)
Shape: The shape may be circular or irregular. (3)
Surface: Surface of the colonies may be smooth,
rough or granular. (4) Elevation: The colonies on
the medium may be ﬂat, raised, low convex, convex
or umbonate. (5) Edge: The edge may be entire,
lobate, crenated, undulate or ciliate’s. (6) Opacity:
The colonies may be transparent, translucent or
opaquing. (7) Pigment and haemolysis: Certain
bacterial colonies are associated with the production
of pigments and haemolysis around them. (8) Con-
sistency: Bacterial colonies may be mucoid, friable
ﬁrm and butyrous.
Growth in Liquid Medium
Nutrient broth and peptone water are frequently
used as liquid media for the growth of bacteria.
The characteristics of bacterial growth in liquid
media provide some clues in presumptive identi-
ﬁcation. For example, streptococci produce gran-
ular deposits at the bottom of the liquid medium,
whereas most Gram-negative bacteria produce
uniform turbidity. Pseudomonas spp. and other
aerobic bacteria produce surface pellicles in liq-
uid media. The pigment production of some bac-
teria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be
appreciated in liquid media.
Staining Reactions
The
study
of
morphology
and
staining
characteristics is useful in identifying the isolate.
Smears prepared on glass slides from bacterial
colonies grown on either solid or liquid media are
examined for bacteria by appropriate staining. Gram
staining is most widely used to differentiate
between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacte-
ria. Ziehl–Neelsen stain differentiates acid-fast
bacilli (e.g. M. tuberculosis, M. leprae) from non-
acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 24.4). Albert stain is used to
demonstrate
metachromatic
granules
in
C. diphtheriae.
Hanging Drop Preparation
Hanging drop preparation helps to distinguish
motile
bacteria
from
those
of
non-motile
bacteria.
Biochemical Reactions
Biochemical reactions are very important in
identifying bacterial isolates and different bacte-
rial species. These tests depend on the presence of
certain enzymes, such as catalase, oxidase, urease,
gelatinase, produced by the bacteria. Commonly
used biochemical tests are described below.
Catalase Test
It is used to detect the presence of enzyme cata-
lase
in
a
bacterium.
The
enzyme
catalase
catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide
with the release of free oxygen. It is found in

r
most aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
The main exception is Streptococcus spp. It is not
found in anaerobes. Red blood cells contain cata-
lase and their presence, and therefore, give a
false-positive result.
Laboratory Identification of Bacteria
333
The catalase test is primarily used to differen-
tiate Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. In this
test, a small amount of culture to be tested is
picked from a nutrient agar plate with a sterile
platinum loop or glass rod, and this is inserted
into hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) held on a
slide or in a tube. Immediate production of air
bubbles in the solution denotes a positive test, and
no bubbles indicate a negative test.
Oxidase Test
This test determines the presence of enzyme oxi-
dase in many bacteria. The enzyme oxidase
catalyses the oxidation of reduced cytochrome
by molecular oxygen. Kovac oxidase reagent
that contains tetramethyl-p-phenylenediaminedi-
hydrochloride is the main reagent used in the
oxidase test. The dye serves as an alternate sub-
strate for the cytochrome oxidase reaction. In the
reduced state, the reagent is colourless, but when
oxidised, it becomes purple.
The dry ﬁlter paper method is performed by
impregnating ﬁlter paper strips with 1% Kovac
oxidase reagent. The paper is smeared with the
bacterial colonies tested by a glass rod. In a posi-
tive test, the smeared area on the ﬁlter paper turns
deep purple within 10 s. No colour change
indicates a negative test.
Oxidase-positive bacteria include Neisseria
spp., Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas
spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Moraxella spp.
Oxidase-negative bacteria include all members
of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
Indole Test
The test is used to detect the ability of bacteria to
decompose amino acid tryptophan into indole,
which accumulates in the medium. Tryptophan or
peptone broth is the medium used for the indole
test. The test is performed by inoculating the
medium with bacteria, incubating at 37 C fo
24–48 h. Then, ﬁve drops of Kovac reagent
containing amyl or isoamyl alcohol, p-dimethyl
amino
benzaldehyde
and
concentrated
hydrochloric acid are added to the inoculated
medium. A positive test is indicated by the forma-
tion of a red ring at the surface of the medium. No
colour change indicates a negative test (Fig. 24.5).
Indole-positive bacteria are E. coli, Vibrio
cholerae, Proteus vulgaris and Edwardsiella
spp. Indole-negative bacteria are S. typhi, Klebsi-
ella spp. and Proteus mirabilis.
Sugar Fermentation Tests
A carbohydrate fermentation test is done to deter-
mine the ability of a bacterium to ferment a spe-
ciﬁc
carbohydrate
incorporated
in
a
basal
medium, producing acid or acid with visible gas.
The
carbohydrates
include
glucose,
lactose,
sucrose, maltose. The sugar medium contains
1% sugar. Andrade indicator is a solution of
acid fuchsin to which sodium hydroxide is
added. It is a pH indicator that is added to the
basal medium, which indicates the formation of
organic acids.
The test is performed by inoculating the sugar
media with bacteria, incubating at 37
C for
18–24 h. The change of the colour to pinkish-
red (acidic) is considered a positive test result,
whereas yellow to colourless (alkaline) sugar
indicates a negative test result. Production of gas
is indicated by the appearance of gas bubbles in
the Durham tube.
All members of the family Enterobacteriaceae
ferment
glucose,
whereas
Salmonella
spp.
ferments glucose and mannitol and E. coli and
Klebsiella spp. ferment glucose and lactose.
Oxidation–Fermentation Test
Oxidation–fermentation test (OF test) determines
the oxidative or fermentative metabolism of
carbohydrates by a bacterium. OF test is used to
know whether a bacterium has the enzymes nec-
essary for the aerobic breakdown of glucose
(i.e. oxidation) and/or for the fermentation of
glucose.
The
test
differentiates
Enterobac-
teriaceae (fermenters) from the members of the
family Pseudomonadaceae (the non-fermenters).

Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Fig. 24.5 Indole test
Kligler Iron Agar/Triple Sugar Iron Agar Test
Kligler iron agar (KIA) and triple sugar iron agar
(TSI) tests are used to determine the ability of an
organism
to
attack
a
speciﬁc
carbohydrate
incorporated into a basal growth medium, with
or without the production of gas, along with the
production of hydrogen sulphide (Fig. 24.6). KIA
medium contains two carbohydrates: lactose and
glucose, in a ratio of 10:1. TSI contains a third
carbohydrate, sucrose, in addition to lactose and
glucose.
The test is performed by inoculating KIA or
TSI with an inoculating needle by stabbing the
butt, streaking the slant, and incubating at 37 C
for 18–24 h. During incubation, the bacterium
ﬁrst utilises glucose and then lactose and sucrose.
After 18–24 h, the glucose concentration is
depleted in the slant and the butt. The bacteria
start oxidative degradation of the peptone present
in the slant, resulting in the production of alkaline
by-products, thereby changing the indicator to a
red colour. Anaerobic fermentation of glucose in
the butt produces a large volume of acid, which
neutralises the alkalinity caused by peptone deg-
radation; hence, the butt remains yellow. Yellow
colour (acidic), therefore, indicates fermentation
of
carbohydrates,
and red
colour
(alkaline)
indicates
no fermentation. The presence of
bubbles in the butt indicates gas production dur-
ing the fermentation of carbohydrates.
Certain
bacteria
produce
H2S,
which
is
detected as a black precipitate that blackens the
slant and butt of the medium. The medium is
turned black due to a combination of H2S with
ferric ions from ferric salts present in the medium
to form ferrous sulphide as black precipitates.
Three basic fermentation patterns are observed
on KIA medium after incubation at 37 C for
24 h:
1. Fermentation of glucose only (alkali/acid or
K/A reaction; K denotes alkaline reaction
and
A
denotes
acidic
reaction):
After
18–24 h, the low glucose concentration is
completely used up, and the organism starts
to utilise the peptones present in the medium,
resulting in an alkaline pH in slant (red). In the

Laboratory Identification of Bacteria
335
Fig. 24.6 Kligler iron agar showing production of hydro-
gen sulphide
butt, a yellow colour exists due to the anaero-
bic degradation of glucose.
2. Fermentation of lactose and glucose (acid/
acid or A/A reaction): Lactose is present in
10 times the amount of glucose. In 18–24 h,
the lactose is not depleted and therefore, acidic
conditions exist in the butt and slant.
3. Neither
lactose
nor
glucose
fermented
(alkali/alkali
or
K/K
reaction):
Many
Gram-negative, non-enteric bacilli cannot fer-
ment glucose or lactose. A reaction of K/K
results from the aerobic catabolism of peptone
by the organism.
H2S production and carbohydrate fermentation
patterns are generally characteristic for speciﬁc
bacterial
groups,
especially
the
Enterobacteriaceae.
Urease Test
The test is used to determine the ability of an
organism to split urea into ammonia by the
enzyme urease. Production of ammonia makes
the medium alkaline; thus, the indicator phenol
red changes to red or pink in colour. The test is
performed
in
Christensen
urease
medium.
Urease-positive bacteria produce a pink colour.
The urease test is useful for screening urease
production by Proteus spp., Morganella spp. and
some Providencia spp. Proteus spp. is rapidly
urease positive—usually within 6 h. Another
example
of
urease
producing
organism
is
Helicobacter pylori, the production of which is
essential for its survival in the acidic pH of the
stomach.
Citrate Test
The citrate test is used to demonstrate the ability
of an organism to utilise citrate as the sole source
of carbon for metabolism. Koser citrate medium
(a liquid medium) and Simmon citrate medium
(a solid medium) are used for the test. Growth in
the Simmon medium is accompanied by a rise in
pH to change the medium from its initial green
colour to deep blue. Hence, growth with blue
colour on the slant indicates a positive test, and
no growth without any colour change indicates a
negative test. In Koser liquid medium, turbidity
indicates a positive test and absence of turbidity
indicates a negative test.
Nitrate Reduction Test
The test is used to determine the presence of
enzyme nitrate reductase in the bacteria. The
enzyme reduces nitrate to nitrites or free nitrogen
gas. The test is carried out by inoculating the
broth containing 1% potassium nitrate (KNO3)
and incubating it at 37 C for up to 5 days. Then
1–2 drops of a reagent consisting of a mixture of
1 mL of naphthylamine and 1 mL of sulphanilic
acid are added. The red colour developed within a

few minutes signiﬁes a positive reaction, whereas
the absence of colour indicates a negative
reaction.
336
24
Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
Nitrate reduction test is used mainly to identify
members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, which
are usually positive for nitrate reduction test.
Methyl Red Test
The test detects the ability of an organism to
produce and maintain stable acid end products
during the fermentation of glucose, thereby
maintaining a sustained pH below 4.5. The test
is performed by inoculating a glucose phosphate
broth and incubating it at 37 C for 2–5 days. Five
drops of 0.04% of MR solution are then added to
the inoculated medium, mixed, and the result is
read immediately. Development of red colour
denotes a positive test, and yellow colour
indicates a negative test. E. coli, Yersinia spp.
and Listeria monocytogenes are examples of
MR-test-positive bacteria.
Methyl red test is commonly used to differen-
tiate E. coli (MR positive) from Enterobacter
(MR negative) and Yersinia spp. (MR positive)
from other Gram-negative, non-enteric bacteria
(MR negative).
Voges–Proskauer Test
Voges–Proskauer (VP) test detects the production
of acetyl methyl carbinol (acetoin), a natural
product formed from pyruvic acid in the course
of glucose fermentation. In the presence of alkali
and atmospheric oxygen, the acetoin is oxidised
to diacetyl that reacts with alpha-naphthol to pro-
duce a red colour. This test is performed by
inoculating the glucose phosphate broth with the
organism and incubating it at 37 C for 48 h. Then
approximately three drops of alpha-naphthol are
added, followed by the addition of 1 drop of 40%
potassium hydroxide. The reagents are mixed
well and are allowed to stand for 30 min. In the
positive test, the pink colour appears in 2–5 min,
deepening to magenta in 30 min. The solution
remains colourless for 30 min in the negative
test. Staphylococcus spp., V. cholerae biotype
eltor, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. are
the
common
examples
of
VP-test-positive
bacteria.
Indole, MR, VP and citrate tests, commonly
referred to as “IMViC tests”, are the most fre-
quently used tests to identify enteric, Gram-
negative bacteria.
Hydrogen Sulphide Production
These tests are carried out to demonstrate H2S
produced by certain bacteria. Production of H2S
is demonstrated by inoculating the bacteria in the
media containing lead acetate, ferric ammonium
citrate or ferrous acetate and incubating overnight
at 37
C. H2S-producing bacteria by their
enzymatic actions produce H2S from sulphur-
containing amino acids in the medium. Produc-
tion of sulphur produces black colour in the
media, visible to the naked eye.
Filter paper strip is another method of demon-
stration of the production of H2S. In this method,
a ﬁlter paper strip impregnated with lead acetate is
kept between the cotton plug and the medium in
the tube. The blackening of the paper indicates
the production of H2S. P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris
and Salmonella spp. are some examples of the
H2S-producing bacteria.
Laboratory Animals
Some pathogenic bacteria and their bacterial
metabolites produce characteristic lesions in lab-
oratory animals. The most commonly employed
animals are rats, guinea pigs, mice and rabbits.
Depending on the organisms to be tested, these
animals may be inoculated by subcutaneous,
intramuscular,
intravenous,
intraperitoneal
or
intracerebral routes. The identiﬁcation of the bac-
teria is made depending on the post-mortem
ﬁndings and cultural properties of the bacteria.
For example, guinea pigs are commonly used
for
performing
animal
pathogenicity
of
C.
diphtheriae, Clostridium perfringens and M.
tuberculosis.
Antibiotic Sensitivity
Determination of antibiotic sensitivity of an iso-
late from a patient is essential for the choice of
drug therapy. In some cases, the sensitivity of an
organism to a particular agent helps in the identi-
ﬁcation. For example, Streptococcus pyogenes is
sensitive
to
bacitracin
and
Streptococcus

pneumoniae to optochin. The sensitivity to the
antibiotic can be determined by disc diffusion
test, serial dilution tests and E-test, as described
in detail in Chap. 23.
Laboratory Identification of Bacteria
337
Typing of Bacterial Strains
The ability to discriminate between similar strains
of bacteria may be important in tracing sources or
modes of spread of infection in a community.
Typing methods are widely used for epidemio-
logical
studies.
These
include
phenotypic
techniques and genotypic techniques.
Phenotypic Techniques
Phenotypic techniques include (1) Bio typing: It
relies on a set of biochemical reactions to distin-
guish different strains within a given species.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is an example
of this type. (2) Serotyping: Different strains of
organisms
of
the
same
species
can
be
differentiated based on the difference in the
expression of antigenic determinants on the cell
surface. (3) Bacteriocin typing: This is used in
the case of bacterial species for which many lytic
bacteriophages
have
been
identiﬁed,
and
(4) Phage typing: This has been the mainstay of
strain discrimination and is widely used in epide-
miological studies.
Gas-Liquid Chromatography
Gas-liquid chromatography, commonly referred
to as gas chromatography, is a highly sensitive
tool for detecting fatty acids in microorganisms. It
has long been used for the chemotaxonomic anal-
ysis of microorganisms wherein cellular fatty
acids are processed through transesteriﬁcation,
saponiﬁcation
and
extraction.
Finally,
it
is
derivatised to form fatty acid methyl esters
(FAME)
and
passed
through
the
gas
chromatography’s
silica
columns.
Individual
FAME present in the sample produces a speciﬁc
peak in a gas chromatogram with respect to the
time of retention in the column. A novel species
develops a pattern in gas chromatogram that is
different from closely related species of the same
genus.
Genotypic Techniques
Genotypic techniques depend on differences
related to the genome of bacteria. Genotypic
techniques employed to differentiate strains of
bacteria include plasmid proﬁle analysis and
restriction
endonuclease
analysis
of
chromosomal DNA.
Serology
1. Agglutination
of
biochemically
conﬁrmed
bacteria with speciﬁc antisera facilitates fur-
ther identifying the isolated bacteria. Aggluti-
nation test identiﬁes presumptive isolates of
pathogens (e.g. Salmonella) from clinical
samples. It is also used for the grouping of
beta-haemolytic streptococci.
2. A group of serological tests like ﬂocculation
tests,
neutralisation
tests,
hemagglutinin-
inhibition tests, enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assays (ELISAs) and chemiluminescence
immunoassays are available for detection of
antigen or antibodies that develop in response
to certain diseases, including infections and
autoimmune disorders.
Flocculation tests result in precipitation or ﬂoc-
culation when antigen–antibody reacts. Floccu-
lant precipitate conﬁrms a positive indication of
a targeted disease. For example, the venereal dis-
ease research laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis
is a very popular nontreponemal, qualitative test
for screening syphilis where antibodies, if present
in the body in response to the syphilis is,
precipitated using speciﬁc antigens.
ELISA
ELISA uses enzyme-tagged antibodies that, when
bound to the target, could produce colour by
forming a chemiluminescent product after break-
ing a substrate. ELISA is performed using serum,
plasma, cell culture, cell lysates, saliva, tissue
lysates and urine.
1. Direct ELISA uses one enzyme-linked anti-
body (primary) that binds to the target antigen.
Such
antigen–antibody
binding
could
be
detected when a substrate is added to the

338
24
Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
solution, and the enzyme in the primary anti-
body breaks it to produce a coloured product.
2. Indirect ELISA uses two antibodies. At ﬁrst,
an unconjugated primary detection antibody
binds to the speciﬁc antigen. Then, the
enzyme-conjugated
secondary
antibody
is
added that binds to the Fc region of the pri-
mary antibody.
3. Sandwich ELISA also uses two antibodies,
both of which bind to the antigen in a manner
that sandwich an antigen molecule in between
two antibodies. This type of ELISA uses an
antibody-coated plate on which the sample is
added. Antigen speciﬁc to the primary antigen
is present in the sample binds to the antibody.
A secondary enzyme conjugate antibody is
then added that also binds to the other end of
the antigen and produces colour when a sub-
strate is added to the complex.
Rapid (Bed Side) Tests
Latex particle agglutination (LAT), agglutination
(Co-A) are the most frequently used techniques in
the clinical laboratory to detect microbial antigens
directly in clinical specimens rapidly. Antibody to
a speciﬁc antigen is bound to latex particles in
LAT or a heat-killed and treated protein A-rich
strain
of
S.
aureus
of
Co-A
to
produce
agglutination.
Immunochromatographic Tests
Lateral
ﬂow
immunochromatographic
tests
(ICTs) are the commonly used rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) to detect infectious diseases. In con-
trast to complex molecular tools and technologies
that require clinical establishments for diagnosis,
such ICTs offer portability and are perfect as a
point-of-care (POC) test. For the detection of
pathogens, it contains biomarkers (antigen) for
the pathogens incorporated on a paper strip.
When placed on the paper, the sample containing
the pathogen develops lines corresponding to the
binding of the antibody (present in the sample)
and the biomarker. Such tests are easy to interpret
and do not require any technical expertise.
Newer Tests in Diagnostic Bacteriology
Nucleic Acid-Based Tests
Molecular methods, such as nucleic acid probes,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other
ampliﬁcation procedures, are increasingly used
to identify microorganisms.
Genetic probes are based on detecting unique
nucleotide sequences with the DNA or RNA of a
microorganism.
The
hybridisation
of
the
sequence with a complementary sequence of
DNA or RNA follows the cleavage of the
double-stranded DNA of the microorganism in
the specimen. The genetic probe-based technique
is also used for the detection of M.tuberculosis
infection.
PCR has major applications in detecting
infections
caused
by
difﬁcult
to
culture
microorganisms (e.g. HIV) or that have not yet
been successfully cultured (e.g. Whipple disease
bacillus).
Automated Methods
Automated methods are now available, which
take only hours to characterise isolates. These
include
detecting
speciﬁc
enzymes,
toxins,
antigens or metabolic end products. Several
instruments like GeneXpert have been developed
that
detects
pathogens
from
samples
in
a
cartridge-based
nucleic
acid
ampliﬁcation
process.
MALDI-TOF
Like DNA, pathogens have unique proteome
signatures
and
could
be
identiﬁed
using
MALDI-TOF. Very recent, it is gaining attention
and emerging as an alternative tool for early iden-
tiﬁcation of bacteria in blood cultures, urinary
tract infections (UTIs), cerebrospinal ﬂuids, respi-
ratory tract infections, stool samples etc. The
technology produces results within 30 min and
reduces the need for microbiological processing
for diagnosis.

Staphylococcus
25
The
genus
Staphylococcus
consists
of
61 recognised species, most of which are animal
pathogens or commensals. The bacteria belong-
ing to this genus are aerobic and facultative anaer-
obic, catalase-positive, oxidase negative and are
arranged in clusters, pairs or tetrads.
Staphylococcus aureus is the most important
human pathogen. The other important human
pathogens are coagulase-negative staphylococci
(CONS), including Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylo-
coccus warneri, Staphylococcus saccharolyticus,
Staphylococcus schleiferi and Staphylococcus
lugdunensis.
Staphylococci can acquire resistance to many
antibiotics and therefore can cause major clinical
and
epidemiological
problems
in
hospitals.
Human infections caused by Staphylococcus,
Micrococcus and Stomatococcus are summarised
in Table 25.1.
Staphylococcus aureus
S. aureus is an important human pathogen that
causes a spectrum of clinical diseases. These
range from superﬁcial skin lesions like folliculitis
to deep-seated abscesses and various pyogenic
infections like endocarditis, osteomyelitis. The
bacterium also causes toxin-mediated diseases,
such as food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome
(TSS) and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
(SSSS).

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
They are Gram-positive cocci, measuring around
1
μm
in
diameter.
They
are
non-motile,
non-sporing. They are non-capsulated. They,
however, contain a microcapsule that can be
visualised by electron microscope only, but not
by a light microscope.
The cocci are typically arranged in irregular
grape-like clusters. This appearance is due to the
incomplete separation of daughter cells during
successive divisions of bacteria, which takes
place in perpendicular planes. The grape-like
clustering is seen when the bacteria are grown in
solid media, but usually, short chains are seen
when grown in liquid media. In smears taken
from pus, the cocci are present either singly or
in pairs, clusters, or short chains of three or four
cells.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Staphylococci
are
aerobes
and
facultative
anaerobes but can also grow in the absence of
oxygen. They grow at a temperature range of
10–42 C (optimum temperature 37 C) and a
pH range of 7.4–7.6 (optimum pH 7).

Nutrient Agar
S. aureus produces round, convex, well-deﬁned
colonies measuring 2–4 mm in diameter. The
colonies show a butyrous consistency with a
smooth glistening surface.

S. aureus produces characteristic golden-
yellow colonies due to the production of a
non-diffusible golden-yellow pigment. The pig-
ment is believed to be a lipoprotein allied to
carotene. The pigment production is enhanced
by incubation at 22 C in the presence of oxygen.
Milk agar and 1% glycerol monoacetate agar
are other media that facilitate pigment production.
The growth gives a characteristic “oil paint”
appearance on nutrient agar slopes.

Pramodhini)
Blood Agar
S. aureus produces a clear zone of haemolysis
(beta-haemolysis)
surrounding
the
colonies
(Fig. 25.1). Haemolysis is well marked on sheep

or rabbit blood agar, especially when incubated in
an atmosphere of 20–25% CO2. Sheep blood agar
is used for primary isolation. Haemolysis is weak
on horse blood agar. Human blood is not used, as
it may contain antibiotics or other inhibitors.
Other species of Staphylococcus do not produce
haemolysis.
Staphylococcus aureus
341
MacConkey Agar
S. aureus produces small pink colonies due to
lactose fermentation.
Mannitol salt agar, milk agar and glycerol
monoacetate agar are the commonly used selec-
tive media for isolating S. aureus from clinical
specimens containing normal bacterial ﬂora
(e.g. stools). Mannitol salt agar contains 1%
mannitol, 7.5% sodium chloride and 0.0025%
phenol red indicator. Most strains of S. aureus
ferment mannitol with acid production, which
gives rise to yellow zone formation around the
colonies.
Other Properties
S. aureus is coagulase positive. Coagulase pro-
duction is used to differentiate S. aureus from
S. epidermidis and other CONS. It is phosphatase
positive. Phosphatase production can also differ-
entiate S. aureus from S. epidermidis, as the latter
either does not produce or has very weak phos-
phatase activity. It is oxidase negative and
catalase-positive. It produces enzyme catalase
(unlike Streptococcus), which degrades H2O2
into nascent oxygen and water.
S. aureus ferments mannitol, sucrose, malt-
ose and trehalose under aerobic conditions, pro-
ducing
acid
but
no
gas.

mannitol is of diagnostic importance because
most strains of S. aureus ferment mannitol,
while S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus do
not ferment mannitol.
Susceptibility to physical and chemical
agents: The cocci withstand moist heat at 60 C
for 30 min but are killed after 30 min. They are
also killed rapidly by disinfectants, such as phe-
nol, chlorhexidine and hexachlorophene. The
cocci are very sensitive to aniline dyes, such as
crystal violet. The dye at a concentration of 1:
500,000 inhibits the growth of the cocci on the
blood agar medium but permits the growth of
streptococci.
Pathogenesis
S. aureus causes broadly two types of diseases:
(1) infection by multiplying in tissues causing
inﬂammation and (2) toxin-mediated diseases
also by liberating toxins.
Virulence Factors
S. aureus produces several virulence factors
(Table 25.2), which include (1) cell-surface
proteins, (2) cell-associated factors, (3) extracellu-
lar enzymes and (4) toxins.
Cell-Surface Proteins
Protein A
Protein A is the major protein in the cell wall and
has a molecular weight of 13,000 Da. It is present
in large quantities in the cell wall of certain strains
of S. aureus, such as the Cowan’s strain of
S. aureus (SAPA). This is a group-speciﬁc anti-
gen. The antigen is present in more than 90% of
strains of S. aureus. Protein A is absent in both
the CONS and micrococci.
It is an important virulence factor since it has
non-speciﬁc interaction with the Fc portion of the
immunoglobulin
G
(IgG),
leaving
the
Fab
portions free to combine with a speciﬁc antigen.
It
is
chemotactic,
anticomplementary
and
antiphagocytic. It causes platelet injury and elicits
hypersensitivity reactions.
Coagulase
S. aureus has a unique ability to clot various
mammalian plasma. Clotting of plasma is brought
about by the action of the enzyme coagulase
secreted by the pathogenic strains of S. aureus.
The enzyme coagulase is of two types: (1) free
coagulase and (2) bound coagulase.
Free Coagulase
It is a heat-labile and ﬁlterable enzyme. It has
eight antigenic types (A, B, C, D, E, F, G and
H). Most human S. aureus strains produce

antigenic type A. The enzyme coagulase, in asso-
ciation with coagulase-reacting factor (CRF)
present in plasma, converts ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrin.
In the absence of CRF, coagulase cannot bring
about clotting like in the case of the guinea pig
plasma. This ﬁbrin coats the bacterial cells, ren-
dering them resistant to opsonisation and phago-
cytosis, making bacteria more virulent. All
coagulase-producing staphylococci are, by deﬁni-
tion,
S.
aureus.
Coagulase
production
is
demonstrated by the tube coagulase test, which
is important for identifying S. aureus.

IL-2)
Enterotoxin
Super-antigen, acts by producing large amounts of interleukins (IL-1 and IL-2)

Leukocidin toxin
Panton-valentine leucocidin
Leukocidin is thermostable and causes lysis of leukocytes
Cytolytic toxins (Alpha, Beta,
Delta haemolysis
Causes lysis of erythrocytes
Bound Coagulase
It is otherwise known as the clumping factor. It is
a heat-stable protein and is present in the cell
wall. This enzyme brings about clumping of the
staphylococci when mixed with plasma by
directly acting on ﬁbrinogen. Lysis of the cell
releases the enzyme. Unlike free coagulase, the
clumping factor does not need CRF for its action;
only one type has been identiﬁed to date. Bound
coagulase is not a virulence factor.
Differences between coagulase and clumping
factors are summarised in Table 25.3.
Cell Wall-Associated Factors
These include capsular polysaccharide, protein A,
peptidoglycan and teichoic acid (Fig. 25.2).
Capsular Polysaccharide
Few strains of S. aureus are capsulated. These
strains are more virulent than the non-capsulated
ones. The capsule protects the bacteria from
phagocytosis. The capsule also facilitates adher-
ence of the cocci to host cells and to prosthetic
implants.
Cell Wall Polysaccharide Peptidoglycan
It activates the complement, stimulates the pro-
duction of the antibodies and inhibits chemotaxis
by inﬂammatory cells. S. aureus cell wall is rich

in peptidoglycans. Peptidoglycan is a polysaccha-
ride
polymer
that
provides
rigidity
to
the
bacteria’s cell wall. It has the characteristic
pentaglycine bridges that link tetrapeptides to
the muramic acid residues.

Teichoic Acid
It mediates the attachment of staphylococci to
mucosal cells. It is the major antigenic determi-
nant of the cell wall of S. aureus. It is a polymer of
ribitol phosphate. Antibodies to teichoic acids
develop in endocarditis and certain other staphy-
lococcal infections.
Extracellular Enzymes
The enzymes include coagulase, catalase, hyal-
uronidase, penicillinase and other enzymes.
Catalase
The enzyme catalase reduces H2O2 to nascent
oxygen and water. This nascent oxygen causes
oxidative damage to host tissue. This enzyme is
produced after phagocytosis or during the metab-
olism of the bacteria. All strains of staphylococci
produce catalase, unlike streptococci.
Hyaluronidase
The enzyme hyaluronidase hydrolyses the acidic
mucopolysaccharides present in the matrix of the
connective tissues, thereby facilitating the spread
of bacteria in tissues.
Penicillinase
More than 90% of S. aureus produce the enzyme
penicillinase. The enzyme inactivates the penicil-
lin group of antibiotics, hence is responsible for
the widespread occurrence of penicillin-resistant
staphylococci. The gene for this enzyme is
acquired through plasmids.
Other Enzymes
These include phosphatase, deoxyribonucleases,
nucleases, proteases, phospholipase and lipases.
Toxins
Toxins include toxic shock syndrome toxin
(TSST),
enterotoxin,
exfoliative
toxin,
leucocidins and haemolysins.
Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin
TSST is an antigenic protein with a molecular
weight of 22,000 Da and resembles enterotoxin F,

and
exotoxin
C.
Production
of
toxin
is
pH-dependent and occurs at pH 7–8. The toxin
causes toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSST is a
super-antigen and hence a potent stimulant of T
lymphocytes, resulting in the release of a large
number of interleukins (IL-1 and IL-2) and
tumour necrosis factor, ultimately manifesting in
TSS. S. aureus strains are
responsible for
menstruation-associated TSS and half of the
strains
responsible
for
non-menstruation
associated TSS produce TSST-1. The strains pro-
ducing TSST-1 belong to the bacteriophage
group I.
344
25
Staphylococcus
Enterotoxin
Enterotoxin is a heat-stable protein capable of
resisting boiling for about 30 min. It is also
gut-enzyme resistant. The toxin is produced by
nearly one-third of all the strains of S. aureus, and
these strains belong to bacteriophage group III
(6/47). Nine antigenic types (A, B, C1, 2, and
3, D, E, G, H, I and J) of enterotoxins have been
described, out of which types A and B are most
important. These
proteins
are
of molecular
weights ranging from 26,000 to 30,000 Da.
The toxins are super-antigens. These, like
other super-antigens, act by producing large
amounts of interleukins, IL-1 and IL-2. They are
responsible for causing staphylococcal food poi-
soning
and
pseudomembranous
enterocolitis
post-antibiotic therapy.
Exfoliative Toxin
Exfoliative toxin is of two types: (1) toxin A
(molecular weight of 30,000 Da) and (2) toxin B
(molecular weight of 29,500 Da). Toxin A is heat
stable, while toxin B is heat labile. The toxin is
antigenic, and speciﬁc antibodies against the
toxin are protective. The strains producing this
toxin belong to bacteriophage group II.
The toxin breaks intercellular bridges in the
stratum granulosum of the epidermis and causes
its separation from the underlying tissue, resulting
in blistering and exfoliating skin disease. The
toxin in localised form causes bullous impetigo
and, in generalised form, causes SSSS in children
below 4 years of age.
Leucocidins
Leukocidins include alpha-lysin, Panton-Valen-
tine leukocidin (PV-leukocidin) and leukolysin.
Alpha-lysin is the most important leucocidin.
It causes marked necrosis of the skin and
haemolysis by damaging the cell membrane,
releasing low-molecular-weight substances from
the damaged cells.
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is six in
number, consisting of two components. The
molecular weight is around 32 kDa. These toxins
cause
the
death
of
human
leukocytes
and
macrophages without causing any lysis. The
toxin has been associated with community-
acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus methicil-
lin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA).
Leucolysin is thermostable and causes lysis of
leukocytes and necrosis of tissues in vivo.
Haemolysins
S. aureus produces four haemolysins: alpha (α),
beta (β), gamma (γ) and delta (δ) haemolysins.
Alpha-haemolysin is a protein with a molec-
ular weight of 33 kDa. It has lethal effects on
various cell types and lyses erythrocytes of sev-
eral animal species.
Beta-haemolysin is sphingomyelinase that is
active on a variety of cells. It is a protein with a
molecular weight of 35 kDa. It is a hot-cold
haemolysin; that is, its haemolytic properties are
increased by exposure of the RBCs to cold
temperatures.
Delta-haemolysin is a protein with a molecu-
lar weight of 8 kDa. It acts primarily as a
surfactant.
Gamma-haemolysin
consists
of
three
proteins. The three delta-haemolysin proteins
interact with one of the two PV-leukocidin
proteins.
Clinical Syndromes
S. aureus is pyogenic bacteria that cause localised
lesions in contrast to streptococcal lesions that are
spreading in nature. Staphylococci adhere to the
damaged skin, mucosa or tissue surfaces. At these

sites, they evade defence mechanisms of the host,
colonise and cause tissue damage. They produce
disease by (1) multiplying in tissues, (2) liberating
toxins and (3) stimulating inﬂammation.
Staphylococcus aureus
345
The diseases caused by S. aureus can be
divided into two groups: (1) inﬂammatory staph-
ylococcal diseases and (2) toxin-mediated staph-
ylococcal diseases.
Inflammatory Staphylococcal Diseases
These include the following conditions:
Staphylococcal skin infections include impe-
tigo,
folliculitis,
furuncles,
carbuncles,
paronychia, surgical wound infection, blepharitis
and post-partum breast infection. S. aureus is the
most common cause of boils. The infection is
acquired either by self-inoculation from a carrier
site, such as the nose or through contact with
another person harbouring the bacteria.
Bacteraemia and septicaemia may occur
from any localised lesion, especially wound
infection or due to intravenous drug abuse.
S. aureus is an important cause of acute bacterial
endocarditis of normal or prosthetic heart valves
which is associated with high mortality. S. aureus
is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in
children. The bacteria reach bone through the
bloodstream or by direct implantation following
trauma.
Staphylococcal pneumonia may occur in
post-operative patients following a viral respira-
tory infection, leading to empyema; it also leads
to
chronic
sinusitis.
It
causes
deep-seated
abscesses in any organ after bacteraemia.
Toxin-Mediated Staphylococcal Diseases
These include staphylococcal food poisoning,
staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and staphy-
lococcal scalded skin syndrome.
Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by
enterotoxin. The enterotoxin is a preformed
toxin already present in the contaminated food
before consumption. Milk and milk products
and animal products like ﬁsh and meat kept at
room temperature after cooking are mainly
incriminated. When kept at room temperature,
the contaminating staphylococci multiply and
produce toxin adequate (as little as 25 μg of toxin
B can lead to illness) to cause food poisoning.
The toxin acts by stimulating the release of large
amounts of interleukins IL-1 and IL-2. It is fairly
heat resistant and so is not inactivated by brief
cooking.
Often a food handler, who is a carrier of
S. aureus (nose, skin) or is suffering from staphy-
lococcal skin infection, is the source of infection.
The onset of symptoms is sudden, appearing
within 2–6 h of ingestion of food. It is a self-
limiting
condition
characterised
by
nausea,
vomiting,
abdominal
cramps
and
watery,
non-bloody diarrhoea.
Staphylococcal
Toxic
Shock
Syndrome
(STSS) is caused by TSST. The toxin is a super-
antigen, which causes STSS by stimulating the
release of large amounts of interleukins IL-1 and
IL-2 in the body.
The STSS is an acute and potentially life-
threatening condition similar to Gram-negative
sepsis and septic shock. It is a multi-system dis-
ease characterised by fever, hypotension, myal-
gia, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucosal hyperaemia
and an erythematous rash followed by desquama-
tion of the skin, particularly on palms and soles.
This condition was ﬁrst documented in 1980 in
the United States among the menstruating women
who used highly absorbent vaginal tampons; the
vaginal swab from these women showed a heavy
growth of S. aureus. This condition can also
occur in other individuals who have a local site
of staphylococcal infection on skin or mucosa or
any other extra-genital site.
Staphylococcal
Scalded
Skin
Syndrome
(SSSS)
is
caused
by
the
exfoliative
toxin
exfoliatin. The condition is seen commonly in
infants and children. It is associated with exten-
sive exfoliation of the skin, in which the outer
layer of the epidermis is separated from the under-
lying tissue. The appearance of extensive bullae
characterises it. These bullae, when ruptured, may
leave behind scalded, red, tender skin. The lesion
typically starts peri-oriﬁcially or in skin folds. It
usually resolves within 10 days.
Pemphigus neonatorum and bullous impetigo
are the milder forms, whereas Ritter’s diseases in

the newborn and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the
older persons are the severe forms of the SSSS.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Specimens to be collected for demonstration of
staphylococci depend on the nature of the lesion
(Table 25.4).
Microscopy
Demonstration of Gram-positive cocci arranged
in clusters and pus cells in the Gram-stained
smears of pus (Fig. 25.3), wound exudate etc.,
are the characteristic features of pyogenic infec-
tion caused by S. aureus. It is noteworthy that
microscopy alone is not adequate to differentiate
various species of staphylococci or micrococci
from one another. It is also of no value for sputum
and other specimens where mixed bacterial ﬂora
is present.
Culture and Identification
The specimens are inoculated onto nutrient agar
and blood agar and incubated at 37 C for 24 h.
Large, circular, smooth, convex and glistening
colonies showing golden-yellow pigments can
be observed on nutrient agar. On blood agar, the
colonies show a zone of beta-haemolysis; any
other species of staphylococci do not show this.
Specimens
from
heavily
contaminated
sources,
such
as
vomitus
and
faeces,
are
inoculated on selective media (e.g. mannitol salt
agar or salt milk agar). These media inhibit the
growth of Gram-negative bacteria but allow the

growth of staphylococci and certain other Gram-
positive cocci.
Staphylococcus aureus
347
Coagulase Test
Coagulase test is an important test to detect
S. aureus. The test is done in two ways: tube
coagulase test and slide coagulase test.
A tube coagulase test is carried out to detect
free coagulase. In this test, 0.1 mL of an overnight
broth culture is mixed with 0.5 mL of a 1:10
dilution of human or rabbit plasma. The plasma-
broth culture mixture is incubated in a water bath
at 37 C for 3–6 h. In a positive test, the plasma is
coagulated and does not ﬂow (Fig. 25.4). Human
or rabbit plasma, rich in CRF, is used in the test.
The plasma is collected in vials containing
anticoagulants, such as oxalate, heparin or Ethyl-
ene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Citrated
plasma is not used because if the specimen is
contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli, the lat-
ter may utilise the citrate and produce a false-
positive reaction.
Fig. 25.4 Tube
coagulase test
Slide coagulase test detects the bound coagu-
lase or the clumping factor. The test is performed
by
mixing
a
dense
suspension
of
the
staphylococci with a loopful of undiluted rabbit
plasma on a slide. In a positive test, clumping
takes place within 10 s.
Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing
Antibiotic sensitivity testing plays an important
role in treatment because often staphylococci
develop resistance to routine antibiotics. Hence,
an antibiotic susceptibility test can be used as a
guide to treat patients with appropriate drugs.
Detection of MRSA in a Laboratory
The
laboratory’s
screening
for
MRSA
is
performed with a 30 μg disc of cefoxitin as per
the present guidelines. Cefoxitin is a surrogate
marker for detection of the MRSA strains.
Besides, oxacillin screen agar containing 6 μg/ml
of oxacillin in Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented
with 4% NaCl is one of the alternative methods of

testing
for
MRSA.
In
addition,
there
are
FDA-approved molecular assays for detecting
the mecA gene and commercially available chro-
mogenic agars for MRSA detection. Finally, latex
agglutination or immunochromatographic mem-
brane
tests
for
PBP2a
can
be
used
to
detect MRSA.

Serology
These may be helpful in the diagnosis of hidden
deep
infections.
The
body
produces
anti-
staphylolysin antibodies in response to a staphy-
lococcal infection, which may be useful in
diagnosing
deep-seated
staphylococcal
infections. If these antibody titres rise to more
than 2 units/mL, it may indicate staphylococcal
infections. The anti-staphylolysin antibody test
has mainly been used to diagnose chronic osteo-
myelitis, and elevated results are also evident in
joint infections.
Molecular Detection
For correct detection of species of S. aureus in
clinical samples, several antibiotic-resistant genes
like MecA, SCCMec as well as coagulase genes
(CoA) and those for the cell wall components
(PBP2a) are often detected by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Classical PCR, RT PCR and
multiplex PCR are the common tools used for
detection. Commercial kits and platforms like
GeneXpert (Cephid) are available for faster diag-
nostic purposes.
Typing
Typing of staphylococcal isolates is useful in an
epidemiological survey.
1. Bacteriophage Typing
Strains of staphylococci can be typed by bacteri-
ophage typing, which is useful in epidemiological
studies. Bacteriophage typing is based on the
susceptibility of cocci to bacteriophages. This is
carried out by the pattern method, where a set of
23 standard typing phages of S. aureus is used to
type staphylococcal isolates and distinguish them
from one another by their patterns of susceptibil-
ity to lysis. In this method, the strain of S. aureus
to be typed is inoculated on a nutrient agar plate to
produce a lawn culture. After drying the plate,
various phages at their routine test dilution (RTD)
are applied over marked squares on a plate. Such
plates are then incubated overnight at 30 C and
observed for the presence or absence of lysis of
the colonies by the phages.
The phage-type of a strain is known by the
designation of the phages that lyse it. Thus if a
strain is lysed by phages 83A, 84 and 85, it is
called phage-type 83A/84/85. By this method,
most of the strains of staphylococci can be classi-
ﬁed and divided into ﬁve lytic groups, while a few
cannot be classiﬁed and constitute the unclassi-
ﬁed group (Table 25.5). The National reference
centre for staphylococcal phage typing in India is
in the Department of Microbiology, Maulana
Azad Medical College, New Delhi.
2. Molecular Typing
These include plasmid proﬁle, DNA ﬁngerprint-
ing using RFLP, random ampliﬁcation of poly-
morphic
DNA(RAPD)
ribotyping
and
PCR-based analysis of genetic pleomorphism.
Sequence-based typing methods (MLST) and
PFGE have recently been used in epidemiological
investigations.
3. Other Typing Methods
S. aureus has been classiﬁed into six biotypes
(A, B, C, D, E and F) by serotyping. Most
human pathogenic strains belong to biotype A.

Staphylococcus aureus
349
Treatment
Systemic antibiotics are necessary for deep-seated
and systemic infections. Benzylpenicillin is the
drug of choice for penicillin-sensitive strains of
S. aureus. Erythromycin, vancomycin or ﬁrst-
generation cephalosporins are recommended for
patients with an allergy to penicillin.
Antibiotics Resistance in Staphylococci
The emergence of bacterial resistance of different
types among the staphylococcal strains word
wide is a matter of serious concern.
Penicillin Resistance in Staphylococci
Penicillin resistance in bacteria has been increas-
ingly recognised since 1945. Nearly 80% or more
strains of S. aureus are resistant to penicillin. It is
of three types:
1. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance
This type of resistance may be due to the produc-
tion of the enzyme penicillinase (beta-lactamase),
which
is
plasmid
mediated.
This
enzyme
inactivates penicillin by splitting the beta-lactam
rings.
Staphylococci
produce
four
types
of
penicillinases (A, B, C and D). Penicillinase
plasmids are transmitted to the staphylococci by
both transduction and conjugation. The plasmids
also carry markers of resistance to heavy metals,
such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and bis-
muth, as well as to other antibiotics, such as
erythromycin and fusidic acid. Beta-lactamase
producing trains are sensitive to beta-lactamase
inhibitor
formulations
such
as
amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid.
2. Chromosomal-mediated resistance
This type of resistance is characterised by a
reduction in the afﬁnity of the penicillin-binding
proteins (PBPs) present on the cell wall of the
staphylococci to the beta-lactam antibiotics.
This also contributes to the resistance of
staphylococci to penicillins and other beta-
lactam antibiotics.
3. Tolerance to penicillin
Staphylococci developing tolerance to penicillin
are only inhibited but not killed.
Penicillin-resistant strains can be treated with
beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins such as cloxa-
cillin, methicillin or vancomycin.
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA)
This occurs due to a reduction in the afﬁnity of the
penicillin-binding proteins (PB2A) present on the
cell wall of the staphylococci to the beta-lactam
antibiotics. This is regulated by a set of staphylo-
coccal
cassette
chromosomal
mec
genes
(SCCmec), especially the mecA gene. The chro-
mosomal mecA gene is responsible for producing
PB2A proteins, thereby conferring a high degree
of intrinsic resistance to all the B-lactams. MRSA
denotes the resistance of S. aureus to penicillin
and all other beta-lactam antibiotics, including the
third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
MRSA strains are classiﬁed as community-
acquired
MRSA
(CA
MRSA)
or
hospital-
acquired (HA MRSA). The HA-MRSA and
CA-MRSA strains can be differentiated in certain
aspects, though not with complete certainty. The
SCCmec types I, II and III are usually associated
with HA-MRSA, while SCCmec types IV and V
are seen in CA-MRSA. Drug resistance in
CA-MRSA is less as compared to HA-MRSA.
The
gene
encoding
the
bicomponent
toxin
named Panton-Valentine leucocidin (luk-PV) is
commonly
seen
in
CA-MRSA.
HA-MRSA
infections usually are associated with invasive
procedures or devices and can spread by health
care workers due to improper infection control
practices. CA-MRSA usually spreads by skin-to-
skin contact in overcrowded communities with
inadequate hygiene. However, with an extensive
circulation of both types of MRSA, this distinc-
tion is gradually losing its importance.
For invasive infections due to MRSA strains,
vancomycin or daptomycin is the drug of choice.
Alternative agents used for second-line therapy
include telavancin, ceftaroline and linezolid.
Vancomycin resistance Staphylococcus aureus
(VRSA)
These are usually the strains of MRSA that have
also acquired resistance to vancomycin. VRSA
strains have been recognised in some places
around the globe. This type of resistance is due

to the acquisition of vanA gene clusters. There are
only limited drugs available for the treatment of
VRSA. These include daptomycin, linezolid,
telavancin,
ceftaroline
and
quinupristin–
dalfopristin.
350
25
Staphylococcus
While VRSA is not commonly encountered,
MRSA strains with intermediate or reduced sus-
ceptibility to vancomycin are common entities in
clinical settings. These strains with intermediate
susceptibility to vancomycin are called Vanco-
mycin intermediate resistance (VISA). Any
strain with a heterogeneously resistant population
of S. aureus is called h-VISA, which ultimately
progresses to VISA. Infections due to VISA
strains are treated similarly to those for VRSA.
The use of appropriate infection control practices,
including contact precautions and adherence to
hand hygiene by healthcare personnel, can reduce
the spread of VISA and VRSA.
Epidemic Methicillin-resistant (EMRSA)
has been observed in some strains of MRSA.
These strains have been noted to get easily
disseminated in hospital environments, thus caus-
ing
many
healthcare-associated
infections
(HAIs). Epidemic strains of MRSA are deﬁned
as those identiﬁed in two or more patients in two
or more hospitals. Among others, EMRSA-15 has
emerged as a dominant clone in hospitals across
the globe. Infections due to these strains are
treated as those with MRSA. The colonisation of
healthcare workers with these strains is treated
with applications of nasal mupirocin (2%,) and
whole-body
antisepsis
(3%
hexachlorophene
emulsion or 20% cetrimide shampoo).
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Staphylococcal infections are found throughout
the world. Nearly one-third of the adult popula-
tion is an asymptomatic carrier of staphylococci.
Hospital infections caused by S. aureus are
worldwide in distribution.
Habitat
Staphylococci are the primary pathogens of
humans
and
animals.
They
are
present
as
commensals on the skin, in the glands of the
skin and on mucous membranes. The cocci are
commonly found in the intertriginous skin folds,
perineum, axillae and vagina. Approximately
35–50% of normal adults carry S. aureus in the
anterior nares, 10% in the perineum and 5–10% in
the vagina.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Human cases and carriers are important reservoirs
of infection.
Human cases of cutaneous and respiratory
infections shed large numbers of staphylococci
into the environment for a prolonged period.
Staphylococci colonise the skin very early in life
(in
neonates
on
the
umbilical
stump).
Staphylococci shed by the patients and carriers
contaminate handkerchiefs, bed linens, blankets
and other inanimate fomites and persist in them
for weeks. S. aureus found in the nose and some-
times on the skin, especially in hospital staff and
patients, is the main source of infection in
hospitals.
Staphylococcal carriers play a major role in
transmitting the infections. Staphylococcal car-
riage is very common in the babies born in the
hospitals;
their
umbilical
stump
is
usually
colonised with Staphylococci. On the other
hand, healthy adults are persistent or intermittent
nasal carriers, and they play a key role in the
epidemiology and pathogenesis of staphylococcal
infections. However, the persistent nasal carriers
are at high risk of self-infection, especially during
surgical site infections, other infections and
bacteraemias. Few persistent carriers are called
shredders, and they release a large number of
staphylococci into their surroundings, which can
be persistent for many days to weeks. Hence,
proper handwashing and topical agents used on
the skin and nose, such as mupirocin and chlor-
hexidine to eradicate the agents, effectively

prevent and control nosocomial infections caused
by MRSA.
Staphylococcus epidermidis
351
Domestic animals, such as cows, can also be
reservoirs of staphylococcal infection.
Staphylococcal infections may be acquired
through self-inoculation from the nose or other
sites in patients who harbour staphylococci
(endogenous infection) or direct contact with
infected humans, carriers, and less frequently,
animals (exogenous infection). Exogenous infec-
tion can also be acquired by close contact with
infected fomites or inhalation of air droplets in a
heavily contaminated environment.
Hospital-Acquired S. aureus Infections
Infections caused by MRSA have been increas-
ingly reported worldwide since 1980. The infec-
tion is also being increasingly reported now from
different hospitals. MRSA usually colonises the
broken skin and can cause a wide range of local
and systemic staphylococcal infections.
Hospital staffs harbouring MRSA are the chief
source of infection for the patients. These strains
can cause a wide range of infections, including
bacteraemia, endocarditis and pneumonia. These
strains are increasingly recognised as important
agents
of
hospital-acquired
infection
in
hospitalised patients undergoing prosthetic heart
valve surgery.
S. aureus is the most common cause of
hospital-acquired infections. Certain strains of
S. aureus causing hospital infections are known
as
hospital
strains.
They
exhibit
certain
properties: (1) they are usually resistant to peni-
cillin,
methicillin
and
other
routinely
used
antibiotics, (2) they belong to certain bacterio-
phage
types
and
(3)
some
of
the
strains
(e.g. phage-type 80/81) are known to cause hos-
pital infections throughout the world. Such strains
are known as “epidemic strains.”
Prevention and Control
S. aureus infection does not cause any life-long
immunity. It causes repeated infections in a
susceptible host.
There is no effective immunisation with
toxoids or bacterial vaccines against staphylococ-
cal infection. Cleanliness, frequent handwashing
and aseptic management of lesions help control
S. aureus infection. Treating with nasal creams
containing neomycin or bacitracin prevents recur-
rent infections in nasal carriers of S. aureus. The
topical
application
of
antimicrobial
agents
prevents the dissemination of infection from the
abscesses.
Other Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci
Other than S. aureus, few other Staphylococcus
species such as Staphylococcus intermedius and
Staphylococcus hyicus show coagulase positivity
upon slide or tube coagulation tests. These spe-
cies are involved in animal infections but do not
cause human infections.
Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CONS)
Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) are
the normal ﬂora of the skin. CONS are opportu-
nistic
bacteria.
They
cause
infections
in
debilitated or immunocompromised patients and
patients ﬁtted with urinary catheters, cardiac
valves, pacemakers and artiﬁcial joints.
Staphylococcus epidermidis
S. epidermidis forms white colonies on blood
agar. It is catalase positive, coagulase negative
and does not ferment mannitol. It tolerates salt,
survives drying and is highly antibiotic resistant.
It is a normal skin commensal. The carriage rate is
as high as 100%. This bacterium is transmitted by
self-inoculation or contact with infected patients
and hospital personnel.
The ability to produce slime (Bioﬁlm) is an
important virulence factor of the bacterium.
S. epidermidis causes infection by adhering itself
to the surface of the intravenous plastic catheters
and prosthetic devices. The adherence is believed
to be facilitated by polysaccharide glycocalyx
known as slime, produced in large quantities by
the bacteria. Slime also inhibits the action of
lymphocytes and neutrophils. S. epidermidis is

an important agent of hospital-acquired infection.
The bacteria are usually multi-drug resistant. It
causes infection in patients with intravenous
catheters and other prosthetic devices, such as
heart valves leading to bacteriaemia. It causes
central-line-associated
bloodstream
infection
(BSI). It also causes endocarditis in patients
with prosthetic valves, especially among drug
addicts. Vancomycin is the drug of choice to
treat infection caused by S. epidermidis.
352
25
Staphylococcus
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
S. saprophyticus forms white colonies on blood
agar. It is catalase positive, coagulase negative
and does not ferment mannitol. It normally
inhabits the skin and genital mucosa. The bacte-
rium causes
urinary tract infection by endogenous spreading
colonised women. It adheres to the epithelial cells
lining the urogenital tract. It causes dysuria,
pyuria and haematuria. It also causes urethritis,
catheter-associated urinary tract infections, pros-
tatitis in elderly men and rarely, sepsis and endo-
carditis.
Urinary
tract
infection
caused
by
S. saprophyticus can be treated with quinolones
such
as
norﬂoxacin
or
with
trimethoprim
sulfamethoxazole.

S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus are distin-
guished from each other by their reaction to anti-
biotic novobiocin—S. epidermidis is sensitive to
novobiocin, while S. saprophyticus is resistant.
Polymyxin B sensitivity is carried out by using a
300-U polymyxin B disk on an overnight culture
of staphylococci on Mueller–Hinton agar. Poly-
myxin resistance is shown by an inhibition zone
of <10 mm.

Micrococcus
Micrococci,
compared
to
staphylococci,
are
larger and measure up to 2 μm in diameter. In
smears, they appear as Gram-positive cocci
arranged in tetrads (Fig. 25.5). In culture, they
produce colonies with yellow, pink or red
pigments. It is doubtful that they are human
pathogens. Hugh and Leifson’s oxidative fermen-
tation test can differentiate micrococci from
staphylococci.

Case Study
A group of 25 students of 11–12 years of age
studying in a higher secondary school were
admitted to a hospital with complaints of severe
vomiting and diarrhoea within 3 h of consuming
the food prepared in their school. History
revealed that a new cook appointed a few days
back in the school prepared the food. All the
students consumed the same food. Children
were treated and were discharged after observing
them overnight in the hospital.

Alpha-haemolytic streptococci produce
a
narrow,
greenish
zone
of
partial
haemolysis of RBCs around the colonies.
The greenish discolouration is due to the
formation
of
a
reduced
product
of
haemoglobin.
Most
alpha-haemolytic
streptococci are found as commensals in
the upper respiratory tract of humans and
may
cause
opportunistic
infections.
Viridans streptococci and pneumococci
are examples.
Streptococcus, Enterococcus
and Pneumococcus
26
Streptococci are Gram-positive cocci arranged in
pairs or chains and require complex nutrients for
their growth. Streptococci are part of the normal
ﬂora in humans and animals. They are catalase
negative, by which they are distinguished from
staphylococci. They are relatively fastidious bac-
teria requiring enriched medium, such as blood
agar, for their growth.
Streptococcus
The streptococci are classiﬁed into aerobes and
obligate anaerobes based on their oxygen require-
ment. Obligate anaerobes are designated as
peptostreptococcus,
described
in
detail
in
Chap. 30. The aerobes and facultative anaerobes
are further classiﬁed as follows.
1. Streptococci based on oxygen requirement are
classiﬁed into aerobes and obligate anaerobes
Streptococci are further classiﬁed based on
haemolysis on blood agar. Brown (1919)
classiﬁed these aerobic streptococci into three
groups based on their growth in 5% horse
blood agar:

355
(b)
Beta-haemolytic streptococci produce a
well-deﬁned, clear and colourless zone of
haemolysis (2–4 mm wide) around the
colonies. RBCs in the zone of haemolysis
are completely lysed. This lysis is due to
the liberation of enzymes streptolysin O
(SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). The term
haemolytic streptococci apply only to
beta-haemolytic streptococci. Most of
the pathogenic streptococci belong to
this group, and amongst them, Strepto-
coccus
pyogenes
is
the
most
important one.
(c)
Gamma-haemolytic streptococci do not
produce any haemolysis or discolouration
on blood agar. These non-haemolytic
streptococci
are
generally
found
as
commensals. These cocci are now placed
under a separate genus, Enterococcus.
2. Streptococci are also classiﬁed based on the
cell wall carbohydrate antigen(C)
Lanceﬁeld
classiﬁcation,
suggested
by
Lanceﬁeld (1933), is a serological classiﬁca-
tion of the beta-haemolytic streptococci. The
classiﬁcation is based on the detection of
group-speciﬁc
carbohydrate
antigen
(C antigen) on the cell wall of the streptococci.
In this
classiﬁcation, the beta-haemolytic
streptococci are classiﬁed into 21 serological

Based on the M, T and R protein antigens
present on the cell surface, S. pyogenes has
been further classiﬁed into 80 serotypes. This
classiﬁcation is known as Grifﬁth typing. M
protein is the most important type-speciﬁc
antigen. This serotyping is important for epi-
demiological studies (Fig. 26.1).
Streptococcus pyogenes (Group
A Streptococci)
S. pyogenes is the most important human patho-
gen. It causes pyogenic infections (bacterial phar-
yngitis and cellulitis), toxin-mediated diseases
(scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome) and
immunological diseases (Acute glomerulonephri-
tis and rheumatic fever).
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
S. pyogenes is Gram-positive cocci measuring
0.6–1.0 μm in diameter. It is arranged in long
chains. Some strains of S. pyogenes and group C
streptococci produce capsules during the ﬁrst
2–4 h of growth. The capsule is composed of
hyaluronic acid containing repeating glucuronic
acid and N-acetyl glucosamine molecules. It is
chemically similar to host connective tissue and
is therefore non-antigenic. Capsulated strains pro-
duce mucoid colonies on the blood agar. The
bacteria are catalase negative; by this property,
they are distinguished from staphylococci.
Culture
S. pyogenes grows on enriched media, such as
blood agar. It produces small white to grey
colonies with a clear zone of beta-haemolysis.
The presence of 10% CO2 enhances the growth
and haemolysis of colonies.

Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Pathogenesis
Streptococci have more than 20 soluble antigens,
enzymes and toxins (Table 26.2) that contribute
to the pathogenesis of various stages of strepto-
coccal diseases.
Virulence Factors
Cell Wall-Associated Factors
These include several factors present on the cell
wall and include group-speciﬁc carbohydrate
antigen, protein antigen and pili.
1. Group-Specific Carbohydrate Antigen
The cell wall contains a group-speciﬁc polysac-
charide, a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and
rhamnose. It is non-toxic and hapten in rabbits.
Based
on
group-speciﬁc
carbohydrate
(C) antigen, S. pyogenes strains have been
divided into 21 groups (A–W) except I and J by
Lanceﬁeld; hence they are known as Lanceﬁeld
groups. The “C” antigen can be extracted by acid
extraction with hydrochloric acid (Lanceﬁeld
method), formamide extraction at 150 C (Fuller
method),
autoclaving
(Rantz
and
Randall
method) and enzyme produced by Streptomyces
albus extraction (Maxted method). After the
extraction, the carbohydrate component is treated
with type-speciﬁc antiserum by a precipitation
reaction or by immunoﬂuorescence to group the
isolates of S. pyogenes (Fig. 26.2).

2. Type-Specific Proteins
The cell wall of S. pyogenes has three major
proteins: M, T and R.
M proteins are the most important protein. It is
the chief virulence factor of the cocci. It
inhibits phagocytosis and facilitates the attach-
ment of cocci to epithelial cells. Based on M
protein, S. pyogenes is divided into more than
80 (l–60) serotypes. S. pyogenes of M types
1,3,5,6,14,18,19 and 24 are rheumatogenic.
T proteins are trypsin-resistant (T) proteins and
are acid- and heat-labile. T typing of strains of
S. pyogenes is useful in the epidemiological
surveillance of the infection caused by cocci.
R proteins are pepsin sensitive but trypsin resis-
tant. These are present in certain Group A, B,
C and G streptococci strains.
3. Pili (Fimbria)
These are hair-like projections that appear outside
the Group A streptococci capsule. It partly
consists of M protein and has a lipoteichoic acid
which helps in the adhesion of streptococci into
epithelial cells.
Toxins
1. Haemolysins:
Streptolysin O is an oxygen-labile protein. It
causes beta-haemolysis only when colonies
are grown under the surface of the blood
agar plate. It is antigenic, and anti-streptolysin
antibodies (ASO) against it develop in strep-
tococcal infection. Demonstration of ASLO is
important for determining a recent group A
streptococcal
infection
and
the
late
complications
of
streptococcal
infections
after the organisms have been eliminated
from the host.

SLO

ium

cereolysin
of
Bacillus

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococci)
359
cereus
and
listeriolysin
of
Listeria
monocytogenes.
Streptolysin S is a serum-soluble (hence named as
S)
and
oxygen-stable
protein.
It
is
non-antigenic. Hence, no antibodies against
this toxin are demonstrated in serum. This
toxin is responsible for haemolysis around the
colonies grown on the surface of the blood agar.
It inhibits chemotaxis and is antiphagocytic.
2. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs):
The toxin, otherwise called erythrogenic toxins, is
of three types: A, B and C. Types A and B
production is
regulated
by a bacteriophage
phage
in
their
genome.
The
chromosome
mediates
type
C.
These
toxins
act
as
superantigens and are responsible for scarlet
fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
Enzymes
1. Streptokinase:
This enzyme is produced by S. pyogenes and
group C and G streptococci. The enzyme is of
two types: streptokinase A and B. The streptoki-
nase activates plasminogen to form plasmin
which breaks down the ﬁbrin barrier around the
infected site, thereby facilitating the spread of the
infection. This thrombolytic property of the
enzyme is made good use of in the medical man-
agement of myocardial infarction. Treatment is
done by giving streptokinase intravenously.
2. Deoxyribonucleases (DNAase or
streptodornase):
Most strains of S. pyogenes produce these
enzymes.
The
enzymes
are
four
types:
deoxyribonucleases A, B, C and D. The enzyme
depolymerises free DNA present in the pus,
thereby reducing the viscosity of pus and helping
in the spread of the infection. The enzymes are
antigenic. Demonstration of anti-DNase B anti-
body in serum is diagnostic of S. pyogenes
infections, particularly in skin infections.
3. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADase):
NADase speciﬁcally acts on the coenzyme NAD
to release nicotinamide. The actual biological
importance of The NADase is not clear. How-
ever, it is believed to have leucotoxic activity.
4. Hyaluronidase:
The enzyme is produced by S. pyogenes and other
groups, such as B, C and G streptococci, Strepto-
coccus suis, S. anginosus and S. pneumoniae. The
enzyme splits hyaluronic acid present in host
connective tissue, thereby facilitating the spread
of the bacteria through tissues. The enzyme is
antigenic.
5. Serum opacity factor:
This is a lipoproteinase produced by some M
types of S. pyogenes. This enzyme produces
opacity when applied to agar gel containing
swine or horse serum; hence it is known as
serum opacity factor (SOP).
6. Other enzymes:
These include neuraminidase, amylase, esterase,
lipase and beta-glucuronidase. However, their
role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains
unclear.
Clinical Syndromes
S. pyogenes produces a variety of clinical
manifestations. These infections can be classiﬁed
broadly as suppurative streptococcal infections,
toxin-mediated infections and non-suppurative
infections.
Suppurative Streptococcal Infections
Adherence of S. pyogenes to the surface of host
cells is the ﬁrst stage in the pathogenesis of the
disease. The cocci adhere to the epithelium of the
pharynx with the help of pili, lipoteichoic acid, F
proteins
and
M
proteins.
Subsequently,
S. pyogenes invades into epithelial cells mediated
by M protein, F protein and other antigens of the
cocci. Invasion of the cocci is suggested to be
responsible for the persistence of infection, such
as streptococcal pharyngitis and invasion into
deep tissues.
S. pyogenes is the most common bacterium
causing
pharyngitis
or
sore
throat.
The

incubation period is 1–4 days. Pharyngitis is
characterised by inﬂammation of pharyngeal
mucosa with exudate formation, tender enlarged
cervical lymph nodes, fever and leucocytosis. The
condition is commonly seen in children, and it
spreads by droplet nuclei. Uncomplicated phar-
yngitis resolves within 3–5 days.
360
26
Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Pyoderma or impetigo is a localised skin
infection, primarily affecting the face, arms, legs
and other exposed parts of the body. The infection
is acquired by direct contact with an infected
person or fomites. The condition is caused by a
limited number of S. pyogenes (49, 53–55, 59–61
etc.) of S. pyogenes. The condition is seen mainly
in young children. In the tropics, impetigo is one
of the important causes of acute glomerular
nephritis in children.
Erysipelas is an acute and diffused skin infec-
tion
affecting
superﬁcial
lymphatics.
It
is
characterised by red, swollen, and indurated skin
with well-marked and raised borders. Commonly,
the face and legs are affected. Erysipelas occurs
most commonly in young children or older adults.
Cellulitis is the infection of the skin and sub-
cutaneous tissues. It is characterised by local
inﬂammation like oedema, erythema, tenderness,
fever, headache, malaise and other systemic
manifestations. It is spreading in nature, often
without any apparent focus of infection.
Necrotising fasciitis is a rapidly spreading
streptococcal infection of superﬁcial and deep
fascia. The infection is caused by certain M
strains of S. pyogenes (M types 1 and 3), which
produce pyrogenic exotoxins. These strains are
also called “ﬂesh-eating strains” due to the exten-
sive destruction of muscle and fascia caused by
them. The condition is also associated with a
toxic
shock-like
syndrome,
leading
to
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
and
multi-system failure.
Toxin-Mediated Infections
Scarlet fever is a complication of streptococcal
pharyngitis
caused
by
certain
strains
of
S. pyogenes producing pyrogenic exotoxins. It
manifests as fever, pharyngitis and a characteris-
tic rash. The rash is followed by desquamation.
However, with penicillin and other antibiotics,
the condition has become rare.
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by
certain strains of S. pyogenes (M serotypes 1 or
3) with a prominent hyaluronic acid capsule. This
is a condition similar to staphylococcal toxic
shock
syndrome.
The
condition
manifests
initially as pain at the site of inﬂammation and
non-speciﬁc systemic complaints, such as nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and chills. The condi-
tion progresses subsequently to multi-organ fail-
ure and shock. The condition occurs in people of
all ages.
Non-Suppurative Streptococcal Infections
Many S. pyogenes cell components have anti-
genic similarities with various human-tissue
antigens. The antigenic cross-reactions may be
the reasons for rheumatic fever and other strepto-
coccal diseases. Due to antigenic cross-reactions,
the immune system produces autoantibodies,
which damage human tissue or organs, leading
to various clinical manifestations.
Acute
glomerulonephritis
(AGN)
is
a
non-suppurative complication of S. pyogenes
infection. The onset of infection typically occurs
2–3 weeks following skin infection or pharyngi-
tis. It is caused by certain nephritogenic types
such as pharyngeal (M types 1 and 12) and
pyodermal strains (M types 49, 53–55 and
59–61). M protein-type 49 skin infection is most
frequently implicated. The disease occurs due to
the deposition of antigen–antibody complexes on
the glomerular basement membrane, initiating
inﬂammation. This leads to hypertension, gener-
alised oedema, haematuria and proteinuria.
Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disease
exacerbated by the recurrence of streptococcal
infection. It is caused by certain rheumatogenic
strains of S. pyogenes. Rheumatic fever occurs
due to antigenic cross-reaction between strepto-
coccal proteins and the connective tissue antigens
of the heart and joints. It has a latent period of
2–4 weeks. It is characterised by fever, migrating
polyarthritis, presence of Aschoff nodules and
carditis. Damage to heart valves may occur dur-
ing infection (Table 26.3).

Acquired immunity to streptococcal infection
is based on developing speciﬁc antibodies against

of streptococci lasts longer in untreated than
treated persons.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
The nature of specimens to be collected depends
upon the disease manifestations. Throat swabs,
nasal swabs, pus, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, blood, ster-
ile body ﬂuid etc. are collected for culture. Pikes
transport medium is used in case of delay in
receipt of specimens. The serum is used for
serology.
Microscopy
Gram staining of pus or exudates is a rapid and
presumptive diagnostic procedure. The presence
of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains
(Fig. 26.3) in association with leucocytes is sug-
gestive of streptococcal infection. However,
Gram staining is of no value in pharyngitis or
genital infections because the streptococci are
found as part of the normal ﬂora in the
oropharynx.
Culture and Identification
Throat swab culture is the most speciﬁc for the
diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Ideally,
the throat swab specimen should be collected
from the tonsils and posterior part of the orophar-
ynx because more bacteria are present at this site
than in the anterior part of the mouth. After
collecting the specimen, they are plated immedi-
ately on the blood agar plate; in case of delay,
they are sent to the laboratory in Pikes transport
medium.
In the laboratory, the specimens are inoculated
on a 5% sheep blood agar and incubated at
37 C aerobically in the presence of 5–10% CO2
for 2–3 days. The culture of the swabs on blood
agar shows a clear zone of beta-haemolysis
surrounding the small translucent to opaque
colonies (Fig. 26.4).
Crystal violet blood agar is a selective
medium for the culture of S. pyogenes. The addi-
tion of 0.0001% crystal violet to blood agar
makes
the
medium
highly
selective
for
S. pyogenes. This inhibits all other Gram-positive
cocci
while
allowing
selective
growth
of
S. pyogenes. PNF medium (horse blood agar
containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin
sulphate and fusidic acid) is another selective
medium used to isolate S. pyogenes. These two


media are used to isolate streptococci from
specimens with mixed ﬂora.

Biochemical reactions are of little diagnostic
value in the identiﬁcation of cocci.
Rapid Direct Antigen Detection Test
Detection of group-speciﬁc carbohydrate antigen
A directly in the throat swabs by direct ﬂuores-
cent antibody test is very rapid and speciﬁc. The
result for this test is obtained within 4 h. The test
is as speciﬁc as a culture but is less sensitive.
Bacitracin Sensitivity Test
S. pyogenes can be distinguished from other
streptococcal
groups
by
their
sensitivity
to
bacitracin. Bacitracin test is simple to perform
and is useful for presumptive identiﬁcation of
S. pyogenes. It is positive in more than 95% of
S. pyogenes strains and negative in non-group A
streptococci (Fig. 26.5).
Serology
Serology is of value in the diagnosis of acute
glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever.
Antistreptolysin
O
(ASLO)
antibodies
appear in serum 3–4 weeks after initial infection
by S. pyogenes. A titre greater than 200 indicates
streptococcal infections. Higher antibody titres
are found in patients with acute rheumatic but
not in patients with glomerulonephritis and strep-
tococcal pyoderma.
Antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNAse B)
and other streptococcal enzyme antibodies are
also demonstrated in S. pyogenes infections. The
demonstration
of
antibodies
against
these
antigens (titre > 300) may prove useful in
diagnosing
streptococcal
pharyngitis
and
pyoderma.
Streptomyces test is a simple and convenient
passive haemagglutination test. It is used to detect
the streptococcal-speciﬁc antibodies in the patient

sera. The test is for all types of human streptococ-
cal infections.

Typing
S. pyogens typing is based on MTR protein, com-
monly used for epidemiological studies. This typ-
ing method employs various precipitation or
agglutination
techniques
by
using
speciﬁc
antisera.
Treatment
Treatment of S. pyogenes infections by antibiotics
varies depending upon the clinical conditions.
Penicillin is highly effective against S. pyogenes.
As of now, no penicillin-resistant strains of
S. pyogenes have been documented in clinical
practice. Penicillin, therefore, remains the drug
of choice, except in penicillin-allergic individuals
and
complicated
or
invasive
diseases.
Erythromycin and clindamycin are given to
patients allergic to penicillins. Recently, strains
resistant to erythromycin have been reported.
Sulphonamides and tetracycline are not used for
streptococcal infections.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
S. pyogenes infections are worldwide in distribu-
tion. Prevalence of streptococcal pyoderma is
higher in tropics with no seasonal variation,
whereas it is more common in winter months in
temperate countries.
Rheumatic fever is most frequently observed
in children aged 515 years, the age group most
susceptible to S. pyogenes infections. The attack
rate of rheumatic fever following upper respira-
tory tract infection is approximately 3% for

persons with untreated or inadequately treated
infections.

Habitat
Streptococci are normal ﬂora of the oral cavity,
nasopharynx, skin, ﬁngernails, perianal region
and intestine of humans.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission of
Infection
Respiratory and salivary secretions in the form of
droplets and contaminated fomites are the sources
of
S.
pyogenes
infection.
Person-to-
person transmission is the main route of transmis-
sion. The infection is transmitted through respira-
tory droplets by direct contact with an infected
patient, fomites or arthropod vectors. Children
with untreated acute infections spread organisms
by their salivary droplet and nasal discharge.
Overcrowding (crowded homes and classrooms)
is an important factor in transmission. Both impe-
tigo and pharyngitis are more likely to occur in
children living in crowded homes and under poor
hygienic conditions.
Prevention and Control
Chemoprophylaxis is most important in the pre-
vention of acute glomerulonephritis or rheumatic
fever.
Long-term
chemoprophylaxis
using
penicillins to prevent streptococcal infection is
recommended for children with a history of
acute rheumatic fever. Antibiotic prophylaxis
prevents streptococcal re-infection and further
damage to the heart. Antibiotic prophylaxis is
not recommended for patients with glomerular
nephritis.
A
multivalent
streptococcal
vaccine
containing multiple M protein epitopes has been
evaluated. Its efﬁcacy is being proved in animal
models. The vaccine is still in the experimental
stage and is yet to be used in clinical practice.

Group B Streptococci (GBS)
365
Other Haemolytic Streptococci
Streptococci belonging to groups B, C, F and G
and rarely H, K, O and R can also be associated
with human infections.
Group B Streptococci (GBS)
S. agalactiae is the only species belonging to
group B streptococci. This is a pathogen of the
cattle causing bovine mastitis, hence named
“agalactiae”.
S.
agalactiae
is
Gram-positive
cocci arranged in pairs and short chains in clinical
specimens and is morphologically similar to
S. pyogenes.
S. agalactiae is a commensal in the genitouri-
nary tract and lower gastrointestinal tract. A vagi-
nal carriage rate as high as 40–50% has been
observed in some pregnant women. More than
50% of infants born to these mothers through
vaginal delivery are colonised with S. agalactiae.
S. agalactiae in neonates can cause either
early-onset or late-onset infections. Early-onset
infection is acquired either in utero or from the
mother’s vagina during delivery. The clinical
symptoms develop during the ﬁrst week of life.
The condition is characterised by septicaemia,
meningitis or pneumonia. Late-onset infection is
acquired from the mother or from another infant
(environment) during 2–12 weeks of life. The
condition manifests as septicaemia and meningi-
tis. S. agalactiae in pregnant women causes uri-
nary tract infection, particularly immediately after
delivery. In non-pregnant women and men,
S. agalactiae can cause osteomyelitis, arthritis,
peritonitis and skin infections.
Fig. 26.6 CAMP test for
Streptococcus agalactiae
(https://commons.
wikimedia.org/wiki/File:
CAMP_test.JPG)
After overnight incubation, the cocci grow
readily on blood agar and produce large colonies
with beta-haemolysis. The CAMP test was ﬁrst
described in 1944 by Christie, Atkins and Munch–
Peterson. The basis for the test is that S. agalactiae
produces a diffusible and heat-stable protein,
known as a CAMP factor that accentuates
RBCs’ haemolysis. The staphylococci produce
an enzyme sphingomyelinase C which binds to
the RBCs present in the blood agar. RBCs
undergo haemolysis on exposure to CAMP factor
liberated by S. agalactiae, producing a butterﬂy
appearance (Fig. 26.6). Haemolysis showing a

typical butterﬂy appearance indicates a positive
test. S. agalactiae is CAMP positives. Agalactiae
is hippurate hydrolysis positive. It hydrolyses the
hippurate to produce hippuric acid.
366
26
Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Penicillin is the drug of choice. Vancomycin is
given to persons allergic to penicillins. Recently,
strains resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline
have been documented.
Group C Streptococci
Group C streptococci are usually pathogens of
animals. Streptococcus equisimilis is a group C
Streptococcus
which
can
cause
occasional
infections in humans. It causes upper respiratory
tract infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endo-
carditis, brain abscess and puerperal sepsis.
S. equisimilis shows tolerance to treatment with
penicillin; therefore, patients may not respond to
treatment with penicillin.
Group F Streptococci
Group
F
Streptococci
are
called
“minute
streptococci”. They grow well on blood agar in
the presence of CO2. Streptococcus MG is a
member of this group that can cause primary
atypical pneumonia in humans. Demonstration
of cold agglutinins in serum is diagnostic of pri-
mary atypical pneumonia.
Group G Streptococci
Group G streptococci are the commensals of
humans, monkeys and dogs. They may occasion-
ally cause infections, such as tonsillitis, urinary
tract infection and endocarditis in humans.
Group D Streptococci
Streptococcus
bovis
is
important
group
D
streptococci.
It
is
associated
with
human
infections, such as urinary tract infections and
rarely endocarditis. It is susceptible to penicillins.
Viridans Streptococci
Viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group
of
alpha-haemolytic
and
non-haemolytic
streptococci. These bacteria produce a green pig-
ment on the blood agar and are called viridans
(Latin for “green”). Most isolates of viridans
streptococci do not possess a group-speciﬁc car-
bohydrate; hence, they cannot be classiﬁed under
the Lanceﬁeld classiﬁcation of streptococci. A
few examples are Streptococcus mitis, Strepto-
coccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and
Streptococcus sanguinis. These are commensal
ﬂora in the oral cavity, oropharynx, gastrointesti-
nal tract and genitourinary tract.
Viridans streptococci can cause a variety of
infections. They are commonly implicated in den-
tal caries, sub-acute bacterial endocarditis and
intra-abdominal
suppurative
infections.
S. sanguinis is the most common causative
agent of bacterial endocarditis in individuals
with pre-existing heart lesions. There is transient
bacteraemia following tooth extraction or other
dental procedures, after which bacteria adhere to
the damaged heart valves or prosthetic heart
valves. Prophylactic use of antibiotics before den-
tal procedures prevents such complications.
Earlier, most strains of Viridans streptococci
were sensitive to penicillins. However, moder-
ately resistant and highly resistant strains have
been reported recently, particularly in the S.
mitis group. Broad-spectrum cephalosporins or
vancomycin are recommended for the treatment
of these penicillin-resistant strains.
Other Streptococci
A few other streptococci have pathogenic poten-
tial and infrequently may cause human infections.
It includes:

Enterococcus

Zoonotic Streptococci
Streptococcus equi and Streptococcus equinus
cause infections in farm animals and sometimes
cause human infections. On the other hand, in
recent years, S. suis has gained prominence as a
causative agent of meningitis and sepsis in
humans with up to 15% mortality. It is a normal
commensal of the upper respiratory tract of pigs,
and infections are conﬁned to workers in pig
farms or those working in abattoirs. Streptococ-
cus iniae is a pathogen of freshwater ﬁsh like
tilapia and may cause cellulitis, meningitis or
sepsis among ﬁsh handlers.
Nutritionally Variant Streptococci (NVS)
These are normal commensals of the upper respi-
ratory tract and oral cavity in humans and are so
named
because
they
require
pyridoxine
or
L-cysteine as growth factors and grow as satellite
colonies around helper bacteria which provide
them with these factors. Originally designated
the species of Streptococcus adjacent and Strep-
tococcus defectives, they were later reclassiﬁed
into
two
new
genera
of
Abiotrophia
and
Granulicatella. They are implicated in several
bacteraemia cases progressing to endocarditis. A
signiﬁcant resistance of these organisms to
penicillins and other β-lactams has been noted.

The enterococci were classiﬁed earlier as group D
streptococci because they possess the group
D-cell wall antigen. These enterococci, however,
showed several distinctive features (Table 26.4)
by
which
they
were
separated
from
the
streptococci. The genus Enterococcus has 16 spe-
cies. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus
faecium are two important species known to
cause human infections (Table 26.5).
Enterococci are commonly found in humans’
and animals’ gastrointestinal and genital tracts.
Enterococci now are emerging as important
agents of nosocomial infections. They cause uri-
nary tract infections, especially in hospitalised
patients. Indwelling catheters and urinary tract
instrumentation
are
important
predisposing
factors. They are frequently isolated from cases
of wound infections, particularly intra-abdominal.
They also cause bacteraemia, infection of the bile
duct and endocarditis.
The antimicrobial therapy includes a combina-
tion of aminoglycosides with penicillin, ampicil-
lin or vancomycin. Enterococci are less sensitive

to penicillin and gentamicin and are resistant to
cephalosporins. Plasmid-mediated resistance is a
major cause of resistance amongst drug-resistant
strains of Enterococcus. Vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus has been emerging in recent years.

Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Pneumococcus
S. pneumoniae is a normal inhabitant of naso-
pharynx. They are the common cause of pneumo-
nia worldwide.
Properties of Bacteria
Morphology
S. pneumoniae is Gram-positive cocci. In stained
clinical specimens, they appear typically “lanceo-
late -shaped” with one end pointed and the other
end round. They are arranged in pairs (diplococci)
with the broad ends in apposition to each other. In
cultures, they usually appear more rounded and
are arranged in short chains. A polysaccharide
capsule completely envelops each pair of cocci.
The capsule is visualised by staining it directly
with speciﬁc stains or by India ink negative
staining or by Quellung reaction. The capsules
are present in strains isolated from clinical
specimens but are lost on repeated cultivation,
which is called smooth-to-rough variation.
Fig. 26.7 Blood agar
showing alpha-haemolysis
and optochin sensitivity on
blood agar produced by
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Culture and Biochemical Properties
S. pneumoniae is an aerobe and a facultative
anaerobe. It grows at an optimum temperature of
37
C (range 25–42
C) and pH 7.8 (range
6.5–8.3). The growth is enhanced by the presence
of 5–10% CO. Pneumococci are fastidious. They
grow only on an enriched media such as blood
agar or chocolate agar (supplemented with blood
products)
which
will
supply
nutrients
pH
buffers etc.
On blood agar morphology of the colonies
varies depending on the nature of the strain
(whether capsulated or non-capsulated), the type
of incubation (whether aerobic or anaerobic) and
the time of incubation. Colonies on blood agar in
anaerobic
incubation
show
beta-haemolysis
(greenish
discolouration),
but
show
alpha-
haemolysis in aerobic incubation (Fig. 26.7).

Capsulated strains after overnight incubation pro-
duce round and mucoid colonies measuring
1–3 mm in diameter. Some strains, for example,
type 3 S. pneumoniae (most virulent), produce
copious quantities of capsular material and
hence
produce
large
mucoid
colonies.
Non-capsulated strains produce small and ﬂat
colonies.
Pneumococcus
369
On
prolonged
incubation,
the
colonies
undergo autolysis and the centres become ﬂat-
tened or depressed (umbonation) and edges
become raised, giving the colonies a typical
draughtsman appearance (Fig. 26.8). The cen-
tral ﬂattening or depression is due to the produc-
tion of intracellular enzymes, such as amidase,
which lyses the bacteria. Bile salts, sodium
lauryl sulphate and other surface-active agents
enhance the process of autolysis of the bacterial
colonies.
The capsules are present in strains isolated
from clinical specimens but are lost on repeated
cultivation. This is called smooth-to-rough vari-
ation. Non-capsulated rough (R) strains are avir-
ulent; these forms arise as spontaneous mutants
and outgrow the parental smooth (S) strains in
artiﬁcial
culture.
In
tissues,
R
forms
are
eliminated by phagocytosis. Transformation of a
rough strain to a smooth one is also possible by
treatment
with
smooth
capsular
substance
containing DNA.
In the liquid media such as glucose broth,
pneumococcal growth shows uniform turbidity.
Due to the action of intracellular enzymes,
pneumococci undergo autolysis in liquid culture,
which can be enhanced by the sodium lauryl
sulphate, bile salts and other surface-active
agents. However, autolysis will not occur in
heat-killed cultures.

S. pneumoniae ferments many sugars, produc-
ing acid only but no gas. Fermentation of sugars
is carried out in Hiss serum water or in serum agar
slopes. S. pneumoniae ferments inulin, and this is
an important test to differentiate it from those
streptococci that do not ferment inulin. Bile solu-
bility is a constant feature of pneumococci and is
positive
in
all
the
capsulated
and
some
non-capsulated variants. Pneumococci are cata-
lase and oxidase negative.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Pneumococci are delicate bacteria. They are
killed by heating at 52 C for 15 min and by
usual strengths of disinfectants. Pneumococcal
colonies die on prolonged incubation.
Optochin Sensitivity Test
Pneumococci
are
sensitive
to
optochin
(ethylhydrocupreine)—a useful property to dif-
ferentiate these from streptococci. Optochin sen-
sitivity is usually performed by a paper disc
containing 5 μg of the compound; an inhibition
zone of 14 mm or more indicates sensitivity to
optochin. In recent times, occasional optochin-
resistant
pneumococci
have
also
been
documented. The optochin targets an H + ATPase
in pneumococci and resistance is thought to be
due to a point mutation in one of sub-unit ar or c
of the H + ATPase. This resistance to optochin is
not related to the virulence of the bacteria.
Antigenic Structure
S. pneumoniae has three important antigenic
components: C polysaccharide, F antigen and M
protein.
1. C polysaccharide is present on the surface of
cell wall. The exposed part of teichoic acid,
which is linked to peptidoglycan layer and
extends through the capsule, is known as C

370
26
Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
polysaccharide or C antigen. This is a species-
speciﬁc antigen and in no way related to the
group-speciﬁc C carbohydrate antigen found
in beta-haemolytic streptococci. The C poly-
saccharide
present
in
the
cell
wall
of
pneumococci precipitates with C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP), a serum globulin.
The
CRP
is
an
acute-phase
substance
synthesised in the liver. It is not produced
speciﬁcally against C antigen of pneumococci.
It is present in low concentrations in healthy
individuals, but the concentration increases in
inﬂammation,
malignancies
and
bacterial
infections. CRP increases during pneumonia
and disappears during convalescence, hence
can be used as a prognostic tool. CRP is used
as an index of the treatment in rheumatic fever
and certain other conditions.
2. F antigen is the other type of teichoic acid,
which is covalently bound to the lipids in
cytoplasmic membrane. It is so called because
it cross-reacts with the Forssman surface anti-
gen of the mammalian cells. F proteins medi-
ate the binding of pneumococci to the host cell
surface.
3. M protein is a type-speciﬁc protein similar to
the M protein of S. pyogenes, but is immuno-
logically
distinct.
Antibodies
against
M
proteins are not protective, as they do not
inhibit phagocytosis of pneumococci.
Pathogenesis
Pneumococci cause disease primarily by their
capacity to multiply in host tissues by avoiding
the host defence mechanisms.
Virulence Factors
The polysaccharide capsule surrounds the cell
wall. The capsule is essential for virulence, its
role being to protect the cocci from phagocytosis.
Virulent strains of S. pneumoniae have a complex
polysaccharide capsule. The acidic and hydro-
philic nature of the capsule allows the bacteria
to
escape
phagocytosis
by
macrophages
(Fig. 26.9).
The
antibody
to
Pneumolysin
is
a
membrane-damaging
toxin
produced
by
pneumococci. The toxin alters the mucociliary
clearance function of respiratory epithelium and
inhibits phagocytic cell oxidative burst essential
for intracellular killing of the bacteria. It activates
the classical complement pathway resulting in the
production of C3a and C5a, thereby contributing
to the disease process.
IgA protease, the
enzyme
produced by
pneumococci disrupts secretory IgA-mediated
clearance of the bacteria and thereby enhances
the ability of the bacteria to colonise mucosa of
the upper respiratory tract.
Cell wall associated polymers and proteins
include teichoic acid, peptidoglycan, protein
adhesin, phosphorylcholine, F protein that con-
tribute to pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases
in various ways (Table 26.6).
Pathogenesis of Pneumococcal Disease
S. pneumoniae causes disease through the phages
of (1) colonisation and invasion, (2) tissue
destruction and (3) avoidance of opsonisation
and phagocytosis.
S. pneumoniae colonises the oropharynx by
adhering to the epithelial cells of pharynx. The
cocci also release an enzyme, secretory IgA pro-
tease, which destroys the secretory IgA and
thereby enhances the ability of the cocci to colo-
nise mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.
Pneumolysin liberated by the cocci destroys the
ciliated epithelial cells and phagocytic cells by
binding to cholesterol in the epithelial cell mem-
brane. This adversely affects mucociliary clear-
ance function of respiratory epithelium.
The process of tissue destruction is mediated
by many factors, such as cell wall teichoic acid,
peptidoglycan
and
phosphorylcholine.
The
destructive action is further supplemented by
hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacteria.
Presence of capsule helps the bacteria to evade
phagocytosis. This allows S. pneumoniae to sur-
vive, multiply and spread to various organs. The
antiphagocytic
action
of
capsule
is
further
supplemented by pneumolysin, which causes

inhibition of phagocytic cell oxidative burst,
required for intracellular killing of bacteria.

Twenty-three serotypes of S. pneumoniae are
known to cause disease in humans. Out of these,

serotypes 3, 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F of
S. pneumoniae causes the majority of invasive
disease. Host immunity is type speciﬁc with pro-
duction
of
anticapsular
antibodies.
These
antibodies appearing in serum 5–8 days after the
onset of infection are protective against the pneu-
mococcal serotype causing the infection.

Clinical Syndromes
Pneumonia
S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial
pneumonia, both lobar pneumonia and bron-
chopneumonia. Pneumonia develops when bac-
terium multiplies in the alveoli. Since the disease
is associated with aspiration and is localised in the
lower lobes of the lungs, it is called lobar pneu-
monia. Pneumonia is common at the extreme of
ages, in children and in elderly, who have a more
generalised bronchopneumonia.
Pneumococci are the most common bacterial
cause of childhood pneumonia, especially in chil-
dren younger than 5 years. Serotypes 6, 14, 18, 19
and 23 are responsible for most cases of pneumo-
nia in children. Serotypes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and
12 cause pneumonia in adults. Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the
other causes of acute pneumonia. Mycoplasma
pneumoniae,
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
and
Legionella spp. are the causative agents of atypi-
cal pneumonia.
Meningitis
Pneumococcus is the most common cause of
pyogenic meningitis in children, although the
condition can occur in all age groups. Meningitis
is always secondary to other pneumococcal
infections, such as pneumonia, bacteraemia and
infections of the ear or sinuses. The bacteria reach
the brain through blood stream or from nasophar-
ynx, following head trauma or dural tear particu-
larly with cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) leak. Even
with antibacterial therapy, the mortality due to
pneumococcal meningitis is nearly 25%in chil-
dren and in adults.

S. pneumoniae occur in patients with prior viral
infections. Other conditions include endocarditis,
prosthetic or natural joint septic arthritis, myositis

All these infections result from an infection of
tissues during bacteraemia.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar
lavage ﬂuid, CSF, pleural ﬂuid, joint ﬂuid,
abscess ﬂuid, bones and other biopsy material
are the specimens collected for Gram staining
and culture.
Microscopy
Gram staining of sputum is a rapid method for
diagnosis of acute pneumonia. Stained smears
showing lanceolate-shaped, Gram-positive cocci
in pairs surrounded by a capsule are good evi-
dence of pneumococcal infection. The morphol-
ogy of the pneumococci may be altered in the
patient receiving antibacterial therapy.
Gram staining of CSF is used for demonstra-
tion of Gram-positive diplococci—inside the
polymorphs as well as outside in a CSF smear.
Gram staining is positive in 90% of these cases
(Fig. 26.10).
Gram staining of a buffy coat or blood
smear is frequently positive in cases of over-
whelming pneumococcal sepsis and is useful for
rapid presumptive diagnosis of this condition. In
acute pneumococcal otitis media, Gram stain of
an aspirated ﬂuid smear from the middle ear is
useful to demonstrate the bacteria.

smear of CSF showing
Streptococcus pneumoniae
in pairs ( 1000)
Culture and Identification
Sputum is plated on blood agar and incubated in
the presence of 5–10% carbon dioxide. Grey
colonies with alpha-haemolysis are observed
after overnight incubation. Sputum culture may
be negative due to normal ﬂora outgrowing
pneumococci or due to rapid autolysis.
Diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis is con-
ﬁrmed by CSF culture and is positive in most of
untreated cases. However, the culture is negative
in more than 50% of cases who have received
treatment even with a single dose of antibiotics. In
the acute phase of pneumonia, the blood can be
cultured in glucose broth. Demonstration of the
pneumococci in the blood shows bad prognosis.
Culture of aspirated ﬂuid from the middle ear or
from the sinus is a deﬁnitive method for diagnosis
of otitis media or sinusitis. However, culture is
not recommended for specimens collected from
the nasopharynx or from the external ear.
S. pneumoniae colonies are identiﬁed by many
tests.
S. pneumoniae is identiﬁed by its sensitivity to
optochin
(Optochin
sensitivity
test).
In
th
method, a ﬁlter paper disc containing optochin

(ethylhydrocupreine dihydrochloride) is applied on
the middle of blood agar plate streaked with
pneumococci and is incubated overnight. In a posi-
tive test, a zone of inhibition of 14 mm or more is
observed around the disc after overnight incubation.
374
26
Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Bile solubility test is a very useful test to
identify S. pneumoniae. It detects an autolytic
enzyme,
amidase,
present
in
pneumococci,
which breaks the bond between alanine and
muramic acid of the peptidoglycan of the pneu-
mococcal cell wall. The enzyme amidase is
activated by bile salts present in bile, resulting
in lysis of pneumococci. The test is carried out by
applying a loopful of 10% sodium deoxycholate
solution on the young colonies in the blood agar.
Most colonies of pneumococci are dissolved
within a few minutes.
Pneumococci ferment inulin; hence inulin fer-
mentation test is a useful test to differentiate
pneumococci from streptococci as the latter do
not ferment it.
S. pneumoniae can be isolated from clinical
specimens containing few pneumococci by intra-
peritoneal inoculation in mice. Pneumococci are
demonstrated in the peritoneal exudate and heart
blood of the mice, which die 1–3 days after
inoculation.
Table 26.7 summarises important biochemical
tests used to differentiate pneumococci from
viridans streptococci.
Serology
The indirect hemagglutination, indirect ﬂuores-
cent antibody test and ELISA are used to demon-
strate
speciﬁc
pneumococcal
antibodies
in
invasive pneumococcal diseases.
Latex agglutination test using the latex
particles
coated
with
anti-CRP
antibody
is
employed to detect CRP. The CRP is used as a
prognostic marker in acute cases of acute pneu-
mococcal pneumonia, acute rheumatic fever and
other infectious diseases. CRP is found in sera
from cases of acute pneumonia but is absent dur-
ing the convalescent phase of the disease.
Procalcitonin level is found to be elevated in
the invasive pneumococcal diseases, and this bio-
marker can be used as a prognostic marker to
determine antibiotic treatment response.

SSS can be detected in the CSF by precipita-

used to detect capsular polysaccharide antigen in
the blood, urine, CSF etc., by CIEP. Recently an
immunochromatographic test (ICT) has been
used or the detection of the antigen in the urine.
Molecular Detection
PCR-based methods are very much useful in the
identiﬁcation
of
pneumococcus
in
patients
undergoing antibiotic therapy. Further, molecular
methods
can
be
used
for
epidemiological
purposes. Real-time PCR targeting autolysin
gene, lytA and permease gene of the pia ABC
transporter, piaB are the gold standard for
PCR-based detection of S. pneumoniae. Other
target includes surface adhesion gene (psaA) and
the spn9802 gene fragment.
Typing of Pneumococci
Serotyping
S. pneumoniae is classiﬁed into more than 90 dif-
ferent serotypes (1–90) based on the antigenic
structure of the capsular polysaccharide. Of
these, only 23 serotypes are associated with pneu-
mococcal diseases. Serotyping of S. pneumoniae
is not carried out routinely and is done only for
epidemiological studies. Serotyping is carried out
by the following methods:
1. Quellung reaction is due to swelling (Latin
quellung: swelling) of the capsule in the pres-
ence of the type-speciﬁc antiserum against
SSS. This reaction was ﬁrst described by

type-speciﬁc antiserum is added to a drop of
suspension of pneumococci on a glass slide
along with a drop of methylene blue solution.
The capsule, in the presence of the speciﬁc
homologous antiserum, becomes apparently
swollen,

and
refractile
(Fig. 26.11).
2. Counter-current
immunoelectrophoretic
(CIEP) demonstrates precipitation of the
SSSs with speciﬁc serum. This is also a rapid
test used to serotype pneumococci.
3. Latex agglutination test is another rapid test
used for serotyping of pneumococci.
Molecular Typing
Pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and
ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism are the
DNA ﬁnger printing methods, which are being
used currently for typing of pneumococci. Other
praised methods include multilogues sequence
typing
(MLST),
multilocus
enzyme
electrophoresis.

Treatment
Most pneumococci are susceptible to penicillin,
amoxicillin and erythromycin.
Most pneumococci are susceptible to penicil-
lin. Strains that are susceptible to penicillin are
also susceptible to nearly all other antibiotics. But
since 1977, penicillin-resistant pneumococci
are being increasingly documented. Penicillin-
resistant strains may be moderately resistant
(minimum inhibitory
concentration
or
MIC,
>0.1–1 (μg/mL) or highly resistant (MIC >
2 μg/mL). The resistance to penicillin and other
beta-lactam
antibiotics
is
not

as

cline,

and

seen most often in S. pneumoniae serotypes 6, 9,
14, 19 and 23.

Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Pneumococcus
Amoxicillin is the drug of choice for treatment
of otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia caused
by penicillin-resistant pneumococci with interme-
diate resistance. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice
for non-CNS invasive pneumococcal diseases
caused by penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant
pneumococci. Vancomycin is a reserved antibi-
otic, used only if the pneumococcus is resistant to
ceftriaxone.
Epidemiology
S. pneumoniae is worldwide in distribution.
S. pneumoniae is a normal inhabitant of throat
and nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal colonisation
occurs in approximately 5–75% of the popula-
tion. Colonisation is more common in children
than in adults.
Pneumococci are strict human pathogens.
They cause infection exclusively in humans. Hor-
izontal transmission requires close person-to-per-
son
contact,
hence
overcrowding
facilitates
spread of infection. Respiratory and pharyngeal
secretions of carriers and patients are the sources
of infection. Infection is acquired by inhalation of
droplets nuclei and by coming in contact with
contaminated fomites. Pneumococcal infection
accounts
for
more
deaths
than
any
other
vaccine-preventable disease. Children between
6 months and 4 years of age and adults over
60 years of age are most commonly at risk for
pneumococcal infection.

Prevention and Control
Pneumococcal vaccines play an important role in
the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.
23-valent
pneumococcal
polysaccharide
vaccine is available for use against pneumococcal
infections. The vaccine confers 80–90% protec-
tion. The vaccine contains capsular antigens from
each of 23 serotypes of S. pneumoniae most com-
monly involved in human infections. The vaccine
is effective and safe in children older than 5 years.
It is not recommended for use in children younger
than 2 years.
7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV7) is made available recently for the
immunisation of infants and toddlers up to
2 years age. It is targeted against serotypes
4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, conjugated to
CRM

Since 2009, two novel PCVs, PCV10 and
PCV13 were introduced that give protection
against 10 and 13 serotypes, respectively. Both
single- or double-dose vaccine formulations are
available. These vaccines offer better coverage
for multiple serotypes that commonly cause dis-
ease in low- and middle-income countries. It also
results in reduction of CAP hospitalisations in
children, mostly in developed countries. PCV10
and PCV13 have been introduced in national
immunisation programs by several nations by
replacing PCV7 (Table 26.10).
Case Study
A 6-year-old child was admitted to hospital with
high-grade fever (>103 C), headache, stiff neck,
vomiting, lethargy and altered sensorium for
3 days. Gram staining of the CSF smear showed
Gram-positive cocci. The same bacteria were
isolated from CSF by culture. The patient died
despite prompt treatment with ceftriaxone.

Genus Neisseria
The genus contains 29 recognised species. They
are
oxidase-positive
and
mostly
catalase-
positive. They ferment sugars with the produc-
tion of acid but no gas. Neisseria gonorrhoeae
and Neisseria meningitidis are the two important
species that cause human infections. These two
species are strictly pathogens for
humans,
whereas
the
other
Neisseria
species
are
commensals of the mouth and upper respiratory
tract and hence cause opportunistic infections
(Table 27.1).
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
In 1879, Neisser described the gonococcus in
gonorrhoeal pus for the ﬁrst time. In 1985,
Bumm cultured this organism and inoculated it
into healthy volunteers to prove its pathogenicity.
N. gonorrhoeae is a strict human pathogen. It is
the causative agent of gonorrhoea, one of the
most
common
sexually

diseases
worldwide.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
N. gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative and aerobic
diplococcus. It is mostly intracellular—found
within
the
polymorphonuclear
(PMN)
leucocytes—and some cells contain as many as
a hundred cocci. Smears from the pus sample
show the intracellular kidney-shaped cocci, typi-
cally arranged in pairs with concave sides facing
each other.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
N. gonorrhoeae is a fastidious coccus. It is aero-
bic and requires complex media for growth. The
cocci grow on enriched media, such as blood or
chocolate agar. These cannot grow on ordinary
media, such as nutrient agar or Mueller–Hinton
agar. The growth of bacteria is enhanced by incu-
bation in a humid atmosphere supplemented with
5–10% CO2.
Thayer–Martin Medium
Thayer–Martin medium (chocolate agar medium
containing antibiotics, such as colistin, nystatin
and vancomycin) and modiﬁed New York City
medium (a translucent medium containing vanco-
mycin, colistin trimethoprim and either nystatin or
amphotericin B) are selective media used for isola-
tion of gonococci from the clinical specimens
containing mixed microbial ﬂora. In these media,

the
growth
of
contaminating
bacteria
is
suppressed, including commensal Neisseria. On
these media, N. gonorrhoeae produces small,
translucent and convex colonies which are soft
and easily friable. Four types of colonies (T1, T2,
T3 and T4) of gonococci have been recognised.
Types 1 and 2 are small and are brown-pigmented
colonies. The strains producing these colonies that
possess pili are virulent and cause acute cases of
gonorrhoea. Types 3 and 4 are large and are
non-pigmented colonies. The cocci producing
these colonies do not possess pili and are avirulent.

N. gonorrhoeae ferments glucose with the pro-
duction of acid but no gas. It does not ferment
maltose, lactose, sucrose or fructose. This is an
important feature to differentiate N. gonorrhoeae
from N. meningitidis. N. gonorrhoeae utilises
glucose only, whereas N. meningitidis utilises
both glucose and maltose. It is oxidase- and cata-
lase-positive.
Rapid carbohydrate utilisation test (RCUT)
is based on the ability of a bacterium to ferment a
sugar by pre-existing enzymes present in it. The
test result is not dependent on the growth of the
bacterium on a sugar-containing medium. It is a
rapid and sensitive test; hence, the utility of this
test is recommended.

Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
The gonococci are highly delicate bacteria. They
die rapidly on drying. They are also killed by soap
and many other disinfectants, such as phenol,
chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene and antiseptics.
They are killed at a temperature as low as 25 C.
Freeze drying (70 C) or storing in liquid nitro-
gen is the most effective method for storing
gonococci for a longer period.
Antigenic Structure
The cell wall of N. gonorrhoeae is similar to any
other Gram-negative bacteria. These contain the
following proteins (Fig. 27.1).
1. The outer membrane proteins (OMP) are
present in the outer membrane. They mediate
the uptake of iron essential for the growth and

Biological functions
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
381
metabolism of the cocci. They promote iron
intake by binding to haemoglobin, transferrin
and lactoferrin. These proteins are of three
types: (1) Por proteins, (2) Opa proteins and
(3) Rmp proteins
Por proteins, earlier known as protein I, are
porin proteins that form pores or channels in
the outer membrane. Por proteins are of two
types: Por-A and Por-B, each with various
antigenic variations. Strains producing Por-A
proteins
are
commonly
associated
with
disseminated disease because these proteins
prevent the killing of gonococci in the serum
by the serum-complement components. The
antigenic variations observed in Por proteins
form the basis for the serotype classiﬁcation of
N. gonorrhoeae.
Opa proteins, also known as opacity proteins,
were formerly known as protein II. These
proteins are found in the membrane and medi-
ate adherence of the bacteria to each other and
the eukaryotic cells. Strains producing Opa
proteins produce opaque colonies in culture.
The Rmp proteins, also known as reduction-
modiﬁable proteins, were formerly known as
protein III. These are proteins found in the
outer membrane of gonococci and lead to the
production of antibodies that block serum bac-
tericidal activity against gonococci.
2. Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) is another major
antigen present in the bacteria’s cell wall. This
antigen consists of lipid A and oligosaccharides
similar to that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of
Gram-negative bacteria. However, LOS does

ase and beta-lactamase are the other important
proteins. IgA1 protease degrades secretory
IgA1, whereas beta-lactamase degrades beta-
lactam rings in penicillin.
Pathogenesis
N. gonorrhoeae causes disease both by multiplying
in tissues and by causing inﬂammation.
Virulence Factors
N. gonorrhoeae does not form a true carbohy-
drate capsule, unlike N. meningitidis. Instead, it
forms a polyphosphate capsule loosely associated
with its cell surface. The capsule is most evident
in freshly isolated gonococci, and it prevents
phagocytosis of the gonococci.
Pili are hair-like structures that extend from
the cytoplasmic membrane through the outer
membrane. The pili are composed of the proteins
known as pilins, which are repeating protein
subunits. There is a marked antigenic variation
in gonococcal pili. More than 100 serotypes are
known. The pili mediate attachment of gonococci
to non-ciliated epithelial cells. They also contrib-
ute to virulence by preventing ingestion and kill-
ing of gonococci by neutrophils (Table 27.2).
Pathogenesis of Gonorrhoea
It
is
a
sexually
transmitted
disease.
N.
gonorrhoeae
infection
occurs
following

mucosal inoculation during vaginal, anal or oral
sexual
contact.
Ophthalmia
neonatorum
is
acquired non-sexually. This infection occurs fol-
lowing a conjunctival inoculation during vaginal
delivery.
382
27
Neisseria and Moraxella
Gonorrhoea is primarily a genital infection
restricted to the urethra in men and cervix in
women. The gonococci attach to the mucosal
cells and cause disease. Subsequently, they enter
the cells, multiply inside and pass through them
into
the
sub-epithelial
space,
establishing
the infection. The pili and Opa proteins aid in
the attachment of gonococci to the mucosa. The
Opa proteins also facilitate the subsequent migra-
tion of gonococci into the epithelial cells. The Por
proteins inhibit phagolysosome fusion in the
phagocytes, protecting the phagocytosed bacteria
from intracellular killing. The LOS of the gono-
coccal cell wall stimulates the production of
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and other
inﬂammatory responses. All these contribute to
most of the symptoms associated with gonococcal
infection.
Clinical Syndromes
Gonorrhoea
The incubation period varies from 2 to 8 days.
Gonorrhoea in Men
It is characterised by urethritis with burning mic-
turition and serious urethral discharge. Subse-
quently, the discharge becomes more profuse,
purulent and even blood-tinged. Occasionally,
the
infections
progress
towards
periurethral
tissues
causing
abscesses,
and
multiple
discharging sinuses are known as water can peri-
neum. Anorectal gonorrhoea (proctitis) and gon-
ococcal pharyngitis occur in homosexual men
following rectal intercourse or by orogenital con-
tact, respectively. Pharyngitis is most commonly
acquired during orogenital contact.
Gonorrhoea in Women
Endocervix is the primary site of gonorrhoea in
women because gonococci invade only the
endocervical
columnar
epithelial
cells.
The
bacteria cannot infect the squamous epithelial
cells in the vagina of post-pubescent women.
The urethra, rectum and pharynx are the other
sites of infection in women. The infection is
mostly asymptomatic in women. The presence
of vaginal discharge, dysuria, dyspareunia and
mild lower abdominal pain are the common
symptoms.
Pelvic inﬂammatory disease (PID) is the most
important complication in females following gon-
ococcal infection. Increased vaginal discharge or
purulent urethral discharge, dysuria, lower abdom-
inal pain and intermenstrual bleeding are the com-
mon symptoms of PID. Tubal scarring, ectopic
pregnancy
and
infertility
are
the
major
complications in women following PID.
Disseminated gonococcal infections (DGI)
occurs because of the haematogenous spread of
gonococci from the primary site of infection. The
DGI is mostly seen in untreated asymptomatic
women and persons with complement deﬁciency.
The strains that cause DGI are characterised by
their resistance to the bactericidal action of serum,
marked sensitivity to penicillin and autotropism
for arginine, hypoxanthine and uracil (for growth,
they require these substances in the medium).
Gonococcal
vulvovaginitis
occurs
in
pre-pubertal girls through sexual contact.
Ophthalmia Neonatorum
It is a non-sexually transmitted infection caused
by N. gonorrhoeae. This is a condition of bilateral
conjunctivitis of a neonate born by vaginal deliv-
ery to an infected mother. Gonococci can cause
permanent injury to the eye in a very short time.
Of late, the condition has become rare following
the instillation of 1% silver nitrate solution in
newborn babies’ eyes.
Other Gonococcal Infections
Anorectal gonorrhoea (proctitis) and gonococ-
cal pharyngitis occur in homosexual men fol-
lowing
rectal
intercourse
or
by
orogenital
contact, respectively. Pharyngitis is most com-
monly acquired during orogenital contact. Phar-
yngitis is often asymptomatic; however, it may
present as exudative pharyngitis with cervical
lymphadenopathy.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae
383
Purulent gonococcal conjunctivitis occurs in
adults following autoinoculation of gonococci
into the conjunctival sac from a primary site of
infection, such as the genitals. Conjunctivitis may
rapidly progress to panophthalmitis and loss of
the eye unless promptly treated.
Acute perihepatitis (Fitz–Hugh and Curtis
syndrome)
is
caused
by
the
spread
of
N. gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis to
the liver capsule and above the peritoneum from
the fallopian tubes directly.
Repeated gonococcal infections occur due to
the antigenic changes of the pili and OMPs. The
various body sites affected by gonococci is shown
in Fig. 27.2. Persons with a deﬁciency of the late-
acting complement components (C6–C9) are at
risk of disseminated infections.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Urethral discharge in males and cervical dis-
charge in females are the specimens of choice in
acute gonococcal infection. In females, the cer-
vix is ﬁrst cleaned of the exudate while collecting
endocervical discharge. A swab is then placed
into the external os and rotated for several
seconds. The high vaginal swab is not satisfac-
tory. In males, discharge present at the meatus is
collected. The meatus is ﬁrst cleaned with gauze
soaked in saline. The urethral discharge is then
collected with the help of a platinum loop. If no
discharge is present at the meatus, urethral
specimens are collected by inserting and rotating
a small swab 2–3 cm into the urethra. Calcium


alginate or rayon swab on a metal shaft is usually
used for this purpose.

Neisseria and Moraxella

intracellular Neisseria
gonorrhoeae in Gram-
stained smear of pus
exudate ( 1000)
In chronic gonococcal infection, since ure-
thral discharge is less, the exudate after the pros-
tatic massage or morning drops of secretion and
urine is collected. Rectal specimens are fre-
quently useful in asymptomatic women and
homosexual and bisexual men. Samples are col-
lected from the pharynx, urethra, cervix, rectum
and blood and synovial ﬂuid in patients with
possible DGI.
After collection, the specimens are transported
and processed immediately in the laboratory. If
the delay is unavoidable, specimens are collected
in charcoal-impregnated swabs. The swabs are
transported to the laboratory in Stuart transport
medium.
Microscopy
Demonstration of typical Gram-negative intracel-
lular
diplococci
is
characteristic
of
N. gonorrhoeae (Fig. 27.3). In men, the presence
of
four
or
more
PMN
leucocytes
per
oil-immersion ﬁeld in Gram-stained urethral exu-
date smear is diagnostic of urethritis. Gram stain
helps in the presumptive diagnosis of the gono-
coccal infection. It is more than 90% sensitive and
98% speciﬁc for diagnosing gonococcal infection
in symptomatic males. However, in asymptom-
atic males, the sensitivity of the Gram stain is
only 60% or less. The demonstration of 10 or
more PMN in the wet mount examination of the
centrifuged early morning (the ﬁrst) voided urine
under high power suggests urethritis in men.
In women, the presence of more than 10 PMN
per high-power ﬁeld on an endocervical smear is
suggestive
of
cervicitis.
Gram
stain
of
endocervical smears is less sensitive (50–60%)
and 82–90% speciﬁc in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic women.
Gram stain is not a sensitive method for
detecting gonococci in patients with anorectal
gonorrhoea, pharyngitis and skin lesions. Speci-
ﬁcity is also less because commensal Neisseria

species in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal
tract
can
be
confused
with
those
of
N. gonorrhoeae. However, it is not a sensitive
method for detecting gonococci in patients with
anorectal
gonorrhoea,
pharyngitis
and
skin
lesions.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
385
Detection of Gonococcal Antigen
Direct ﬂuorescent antibody (DFA) test and direct
enzyme immunoassays (EIA) are increasingly
being used. These two tests detect gonococcal
antigens in urethral discharge, endocervical dis-
charge and other clinical specimens for diagnosis.
Culture and Identification
Isolation of N. gonorrhoeae from specimens by
culture conﬁrms the diagnosis of gonorrhoea.
Genital, rectal and pharyngeal specimens are
inoculated
immediately
on
a
non-selective
medium (e.g. blood agar or chocolate agar) and
on a selective medium (e.g. Modiﬁed Thayer–
Martin medium).
The colonies of gonococci are examined on
chocolate agar after 48 h of incubation at
35–36 C in the presence of 5–10% CO2. The
colonies are small, round, translucent and convex
with a ﬁnely granular surface. On Thayer–Martin
medium, the colonies show similar morphology
as that on chocolate agar. The mixed microbial
ﬂora
present
in
the
clinical
specimens
is
suppressed by the selective media. However, the
vancomycin
present
in
the
selective
media
inhibits some strains of gonococci.
N. gonorrhoeae ferments glucose with the pro-
duction of acid but no gas. It does not ferment
maltose, lactose, sucrose or fructose. This is an
important feature to differentiate N. gonorrhoeae
from N. meningitidis. N. gonorrhoeae utilises
glucose only, whereas N. meningitidis utilises
both glucose and maltose.
Rapid carbohydrate utilisation test (RCUT)
is a rapid sugar fermentation test. It is based on
the ability of a bacterium to ferment sugar by
pre-existing enzymes present in the gonococci.
It is a rapid and sensitive test.
Strain Typing
N.
gonorrhoeae
strains
can
be
typed
by
auxotyping and serotyping.
Auxotyping is based on the addition of spe-
ciﬁc nutrients and co-factors in the medium for
the
growth
of
gonococci.
There
are
over
30 auxotypes. The most common auxotypes are
prototrophic
or
wild
type
(proto),
praline-
requiring type (pro) and the strains requiring argi-
nine, hypoxanthine and uracil (AHU).
Serotyping is based on the OMP “porin”,
which is further divided into serovars (e.g. 1A-4,
1B-12) based on agglutination with a panel of
monoclonal antibodies. This helps in contact
tracing and has epidemiological uses in discrimi-
nating strains with antibiotic resistance and sever-
ity of infections.
Serology
The serological tests are not used in routine
diagnoses.
Molecular Detection
Nucleic acid hybridisation, signal ampliﬁcation,
polymerase chain reaction, strand displacement
ampliﬁcation and transcription-mediated ampliﬁ-
cation are the FDA-approved methods for molec-
ular detection of N. gonorrhoea. DNA probes
(Gen probe) are commercially available to detect
bacteria
in
the
genital
and
other
clinical
specimens directly. These probes are speciﬁc,
sensitive and rapid for nucleic acid detection of
N. gonorrhoeae. The results become available
within 2–4 h.
Treatment
Penicillin is the drug of choice for penicillin-
sensitive strains of N. gonorrhoeae.
Penicillin-resistant Strains of
N. gonorrhoeae
Initially, gonococci were highly sensitive to peni-
cillin. However, since 1957, strains of gonococci
with decreased sensitivity to penicillin have been
documented. Most of them are beta-lactamase
(penicillinase) produced by virtue of plasmid
transmission. These strains show a high level of
resistance
to
penicillin.
Some
strains
of
N. gonorrhoeae not producing beta-lactamase
yet showing resistance to penicillin have also

been reported. This resistance is mediated chro-
mosomally and is of a low level. Chromosomal-
mediated resistance to other antibiotics, such as
tetracycline, erythromycin and aminoglycosides,
has also been reported.
386
27
Neisseria and Moraxella
Ceftriaxone,
ceﬁxime,
ciproﬂoxacin
or
oﬂoxacin are the alternative drugs in cases of
penicillin
resistance
or
penicillin-allergic
individuals. A single dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg
intramuscularly or ceﬁxime (400 mg), ciproﬂox-
acin (500 mg) or oﬂoxacin (400 mg) as a single
dose orally is also effective.
WHO Guidelines for Treatment
For genital and anorectal infections,
WHO
recommends
dual
therapy
with
ceftriaxone
250
mg
intramuscular
(IM)
along
with
azithromycin 1 g per oral (PO) as a single dose
followed by ceﬁxime 400 mg PO as a single dose
along with azithromycin 1 g PO as a single dose.
Treatment failures are managed by either of the
following regimens as ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a
single dose with azithromycin 2 g PO as a single
dose or ceﬁxime 800 mg orally as a single dose
with azithromycin 2 g PO as a single dose or
gentamicin 240 mg IM as a single dose with
azithromycin 2 g PO as a single dose or spectino-
mycin 2 g IM as a single dose along with
azithromycin 2 g PO as a single dose.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Gonococcal infection is reported throughout the
world. WHO estimated ~87 million gonococcal
infections globally in 2016. However, the trend is
increasing where emerging antimicrobial resis-
tance is worsening the global situation. It dispro-
portionately affects marginalised populations.
The prevalence is high in sexually active young
adults living in low-income countries, among
sexual
and
gender
minorities,
racial/ethnic
minorities and indigenous communities and sex
workers compared to the general population in
high-income countries. However, this condition
has a low incidence rate in European countries
and is nearly eliminated in Sweden. In pregnant
women, the prevalence of gonorrhoea infection is
10% in Africa, 5% in Latin and 4% in Asia.
Habitat
N. gonorrhoeae is exclusively a human pathogen.
The gonococci are only found in infected
conditions. In infected women, the gonococci
are most commonly found in the endocervix
and, in infected men, found in the urethra.
Gonococci can also be found in the pharynx,
rectum and eyes in both men and women. The
gonococci are not found as normal human ﬂora in
the mucosa of the urethra, cervix or vagina.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Only humans, especially asymptomatic infected
men and women, are reservoirs of infections.
Asymptomatic carriage is more common in
women than in men. Purulent urethra or cervical
discharge is the most common source of infec-
tion. The infection is transmitted primarily by
sexual contact. N. gonorrhoeae infection occurs
following mucosal inoculation during vaginal,
anal or oral sexual contact. Increased sexual con-
tact with infected partners increases the risk of
acquiring the infection. Less frequently, ophthal-
mia neonatorum is acquired non-sexually. This
infection occurs following a conjunctival inocu-
lation during vaginal delivery. Less frequently,
the disease is transmitted through the rectum,
oropharynx or through the birth canal.
The gonococci are not found as normal human
ﬂora in the mucosa of the urethra, cervix or
vagina. Fomites do not play any role in transmit-
ting the disease because gonococci die rapidly
outside the human body.
Prevention and Control
Currently, there is no effective vaccine available
against N. gonorrhoeae. Chemoprophylaxis by
the prophylactic use of penicillin is also ineffec-
tive and may promote the development of resis-
tant strains. Therefore, health education, early

in
detection of cases, tracing of contacts and follow-
up and screening of sexual contacts are important
in preventing gonorrhoeal infections. Gonococcal
conjunctivitis in newborns is prevented by using
erythromycin ointment.
Neisseria meningitidis
387
Non-Gonococcal or Non-Specific
Urethritis
Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-speciﬁc
urethritis (NSU) refers to a case of chronic ure-
thritis where gonococci cannot be demonstrated.
Some of these cases may be due to Reiter’s
syndrome. These include the triad of NGU, con-
junctivitis and arthritis. Some of them may be
gonococcal infections that cannot be diagnosed
by routine tests, as they exist in L-forms, which is
undetectable. It is caused by C. trachomatis,
Ureoplasma
urealyticum
and
Mycoplasma
hominis. Occasionally, Herpes virus, cytomega-
lovirus,
Candida
albicans,
Trichomonas
vaginalis and bacteria, such as Acinetobacter
lwofﬁi and Gardnerella vaginalis. Since the
aetiology of the disease is not so clear and well
deﬁned, the management of NGU remains a
difﬁcult task.
Neisseria meningitidis
N. meningitidis causes a spectrum of diseases
ranging from meningococcaemia (rapidly fatal)
to transient bacteraemia (relatively benign). It is
also
the
second
most
common
cause
of
community-acquired meningitis in adults.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
N. meningitidis is Gram-negative, spherical or
oval cocci arranged in pairs with the adjacent
sides ﬂattened. The cocci are usually found inside
the leucocytes in smears from pus cells and other
specimens.
They
measure
0.6–0.8
μm
diameter. Freshly isolated bacteria are usually
capsulated. Meningococci are oxidase- and cata-
lase-positive.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Meningococci are strict aerobes. They grow opti-
mally at a temperature between 36 and 39 C and
at an optimum pH of 7.4–7.6. Their growth is
enhanced by incubation in a moist atmosphere
in the presence of 5% CO2.
Meningococci are fastidious bacteria with
complex nutritional requirements. They do not
grow on ordinary media but grow well on the
medium enriched with blood or serum, such as
blood agar, chocolate agar and Mueller–Hinton
agar. The blood or serum promotes the growth of
bacteria by neutralising inhibitory substances
found in the media rather than by providing addi-
tional requirements.
On blood agar, N. meningitidis produces
small, round (1–2 mm in diameter), convex,
grey and translucent non-pigmented colonies
with entire edges after 24 h of incubation. At
48 h, the colonies become larger with an opaque
raised centre and crenated with a transparent mar-
gin. It does not produce any haemolysis on blood
agar. Strains of meningococci with large polysac-
charide capsules appear as mucoid colonies.
Meningococci
produce
large
colonies
on
chocolate agar.
Thayer–Martin
medium
with
antibiotics
(vancomycin, colistin, nystatin and trimethoprim)
and New York City medium are the selective
media commonly used to isolate the bacteria from
clinical specimens containing mixed bacterial ﬂora.
N. meningitidis is oxidase- and catalase-posi-
tive. These two tests are important biochemical
markers for the preliminary identiﬁcation of this
organism. Alcaligenes spp., Aeromonas spp., Vib-
rio spp., Campylobacter spp. and Pseudomonas
spp. are the other bacteria that are oxidase-positive.
Oxidase tests can be performed in two ways.
In the ﬁrst method, 1% solution of oxidase
reagent (test can—diamine—dihydrochloride) is
poured on the culture media; the Neisseria
colonies turn deep purple. In the second method,

Biological functions
a few colonies of Neisseria are rubbed with a
glass rod on a strip of ﬁlter paper moistened
with oxidase reagent. A deep purple colour
develops immediately.
388
27
Neisseria and Moraxella
N. meningitidis ferments glucose and maltose
with acid but no gas. It does not ferment sucrose
or lactose. Fermentation tests are required for the
ﬁnal identiﬁcation of Neisseria species. It does
not produce hydrogen sulphide and does not
reduce nitrates.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
N. meningitidis is a highly delicate organism. It is
highly
sensitive
to
heat,
desiccation
and
disinfectants.
Antigenic Structure
Depending on group-speciﬁc capsular polysac-
charide antigens, meningococci are sub-divided
into 13 serogroups. Serogroups A, B, C, D, X,
Y, Z, W135, 29E, H, I, K and L are of human
importance. Group A is responsible for most of
the
epidemics
of
meningitis.
Group
C
is
associated with localised outbreaks of meningitis.
Serogroups Y and W135 meningococci cause
disease more commonly than the serogroups X
and Z. Meningococci that lack group-speciﬁc
antigens are considered non-pathogenic.
Each serogroup includes many serotypes. The
classiﬁcation of meningococci serogroups into
serotypes is based on the differences in their
outer membrane proteins and the oligosaccharide
part of LOS. For example, group A meningococci
have a single serotype, whereas group B and C
meningococci consist of many serotypes.

factors
Capsule
Prevents phagocytosis
LOS
endotoxin
Causes damage of the blood vessels
Stimulates release of TNF-α which results in host cell damage
IgA protease
Destroys IgA immunoglobulin, thereby helps gonococci to attach to the epithelial cells of the upper
respiratory tract
Pathogenesis
N. meningitidis colonises the human nasophar-
ynx. Under speciﬁc conditions, the meningococci
invade the bloodstream and then reaches the
brain, causing meningitis.
Virulence Factors
N. meningitidis is surrounded by a prominent
polysaccharide capsule. The capsule contributes
to
virulence
by
inhibiting
phagocytosis.
It
protects meningococci from destruction by the
leucocytes.
LOS endotoxin is present in the outer mem-
brane of N. meningitidis. It is responsible for
damage to the blood vessels associated with
meningococcal infections. The continuous pro-
duction
and
release
of
endotoxin
by
meningococci causes severe endotoxin reaction
in patients with meningococcal disease.
IgA protease acts by clearing the secretory
IgA. It, thereby, helps the meningococci attach
to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory
tract. The virulence factor of meningococci are
summarised in Table 27.3.
Pathogeneses of Meningitis
Meningococci are acquired by airborne droplets
of nasopharyngeal secretions of infected hosts.
Initially, N. meningitidis causes a localised infec-
tion by colonising the nasopharynx. From this
site, the meningococci invade the sub-mucosa
and reach the central nervous system (CNS) by
the invasion of the bloodstream. Meningococci
can also reach the CNS by direct contiguous
spread from the nasopharynx. They travel along
the olfactory nerve and through the cribriform
plate
reach
the
subarachnoid
space
of
the

unionised
CNS,
the
bacteria
multiply.
Uncontrolled multiplication of bacteria in the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) causes a cascade of
meningeal inﬂammation resulting in meningitis.
Neisseria meningitidis
389
Clinical Syndromes
Meningococcal infection of the nasopharynx is
usually sub-clinical. Asymptomatic nasopharyn-
geal carriage of meningococci is of short duration
and resolves within several weeks.
Meningitis
Meningitis is a febrile illness of short duration
and is characterised by headaches and a stiff
neck.
The
noted
complications
are
mental
obtundation, stupor and coma due to increased
intracranial pressure. The condition is most com-
mon in children and young adults. Meningococ-
cal meningitis is rapidly fatal, requiring early
diagnosis and treatment. Serious complications
like cranial nerve dysfunctions, hearing loss,
paralysis, seizures. The prognosis of untreated
infections is mostly fatal. With treatment, the
prognosis in children is better than in adults. In
children, chances of post-meningitis developmen-
tal delays always remain.
Meningococcaemia
Meningococcaemia with or without meningitis is
a
life-threatening
condition.
The
condition
presents as an acute fever with petechial rash.
Small petechial rashes are found on the trunk
and lower extremities. The rashes subsequently
may coalesce to form large haemorrhagic lesions.
Waterhouse–Frederickson Syndrome
It is an overwhelming systemic infection caused
by meningococci. This condition is characterised
by severe disseminated intravascular coagulation,
shock and multi-organ failure, including the
destruction of the adrenal glands. The condition
is invariably fatal. It is most commonly seen in
persons suffering from deﬁciency of C5–C9
components of the complement.
Recurrent meningococcal meningitis is seen
in patients with hereditary deﬁciency of various
complement system components.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Blood and CSF are the specimens of choice for
demonstration of meningococci in the early stage
of meningitis. Blood is collected in blood culture
media
containing
glucose
broth
or
sodium
taurocholate broth. Nasopharyngeal swabs are
useful to detect carriers. They are collected
using sterile swabs and are transported in Stuart
transport medium to the laboratory.
CSF is collected by lumbar puncture and
blood
by
venepuncture
in
strict
aseptic
conditions. Meningococcal meningitis produces
various inﬂammatory changes in the blood, and
CSF in bacterial meningitis is more turbid. It
contains more than 1000 WBC/μL, and the cells
are predominantly PMN cells. The total protein
content is increased. The total glucose level,
which is normally 60% of simultaneous blood
glucose level, is lowered (hypoglycorrhachia).
The intracranial pressure may be elevated.
CSF is never refrigerated as Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae, another agent of meningitis, may die
at the cold temperature. It is transported immedi-
ately to the laboratory for processing. The CSF
received in the laboratory is processed in three
parts: The ﬁrst part is centrifuged, and a smear is
prepared from the deposit for Gram staining. The
supernatant is tested for meningococcal antigens.
The second part of CSF is used for direct culture.
Finally, the third part is incubated overnight with
an equal volume of glucose broth and then
sub-cultured
onto
the
blood
agar
and
chocolate agar.
Microscopy
Gram staining of the CSF is a very useful method
for detecting meningococci. They are seen as
Gram-negative diplococci present mainly inside
the leucocytes. Some may even be present extra-
cellularly. In fulminant meningococcaemia, Gram
staining of the peripheral blood buffy coat may
show Gram-negative diplococci.
Culture and Identification
Isolation of N. meningitidis from the CSF, blood
and other clinical specimens by culture conﬁrms

the diagnosis of meningococcal infection. The
CSF is inoculated immediately on blood agar or
chocolate agar and incubated at 35–36 C in the
presence of 5% CO2. The colonies on blood agar
after 24 h of incubation are small, round (1–2 mm
in diameter) and convex. They are grey and trans-
lucent non-pigmented colonies with entire edges.
At 48 h, the colonies become larger with an
opaque raised centre and crenated with a transpar-
ent margin. It does not produce any haemolysis
on blood agar. Strains of meningococci with
large
polysaccharide
capsules
appear
as
mucoid colonies. Meningococci produce large
colonies on chocolate agar.
390
27
Neisseria and Moraxella
Blood is inoculated immediately into blood
culture
bottles
containing
glucose
broth
or
sodium taurocholate broth and incubated at
35–36 C. Sub-cultures are made on blood agar
or chocolate agar from these broths and are
pre-incubated overnight at 35–36 C in the pres-
ence of 5% CO2. The cultures should be
incubated for 4–7 days with a daily sub-culture.
Blood culture is often positive during the early
stage of meningitis and in meningococcaemia.
Other specimens, such as nasopharyngeal
swabs and petechial exudates, are processed sim-
ilarly as described earlier for CSF. Thayer–Mar-
tin
medium
with
antibiotics
(vancomycin,
colistin,
nystatin
and
trimethoprim)
and
New York City medium are the selective media
used to isolate the bacteria from nasopharyngeal
swabs containing mixed bacterial ﬂora.
N. meningitidis ferments glucose and maltose
with acid but no gas. It does not ferment sucrose
or lactose.
Serogrouping of meningococci grown on cul-
ture is carried out by slide agglutination with
speciﬁc
hyperimmune
serum.
Serotyping
of
strains is useful for identifying meningococci
strains for epidemiological studies.
Antigen Detection
Detection of soluble polysaccharide antigen in the
CSF is useful for diagnosing meningitis. Latex
agglutination test and ELISA using speciﬁc
antibodies are useful to detect the soluble antigen
in the CSF. Antigen detection is useful when
bacteria are scanty in the CSF. However, antigen
detection is not useful in meningitis caused by
Group
B
meningococci.
This
is
because
N.
meningitidis
serogroup
B
is
relatively
non-immunogenic and does not react with spe-
ciﬁc antibodies.
Serology
ELISA is useful for demonstrating antibodies
against speciﬁc polysaccharide antigens in the
serum. Serology is useful in chronic meningococ-
cal infections where cultures have proved nega-
tive for meningococci.
Molecular Detection
PCR is a highly sensitive technique than the cul-
ture, even in the patients’ receiving antibiotics.
Unlike culture, the results are available within
24 h. PCR has been used to detect N. meningitidis
DNA in clinical specimens. The test is useful in
detecting meningococcal DNA in CSF even in
small quantities and is a highly sensitive tech-
nique than the culturing method. The drawback
of this test is its high cost and the need for exper-
tise to operate the PCR. The test, therefore, is only
used in a large-scale outbreak when many
specimens are to be analysed and in a tertiary
healthcare centre.
Treatment
Prompt and speciﬁc antimicrobial therapy of
meningococcaemia or meningococcal meningitis
is most crucial. Intravenous penicillin G is the
drug of choice for the treatment of meningitis.
The MIC of penicillin usually ranges from
0.01–0.05 μg/mL against meningococcal isolates.
Chloramphenicol, rifampicin, erythromycin,
tetracycline
and
cephalosporins
(ceftriaxone,
cefotaxime and cefuroxime) are useful in the
treatment of bacterial meningitis. Ceftriaxone
has an additional advantage of eradicating the
nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci. Chlor-
amphenicol is useful for patients who are allergic


to penicillin. Meningococci are not susceptible to
vancomycin
and
polymyxin.
Recently,
meningococci
resistance
to
sulphadiazine
(MIC
0.128 μg/mL) has been documented.
Neisseria meningitidis
391
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Meningococcal
disease
occurs
worldwide.
N. meningitidis serogroup A usually causes
epidemics; serogroup B causes both epidemics
and outbreaks, while serogroup C mostly causes
localised outbreaks. Endemic meningitis is more
common in children below the age of 5 and
elderly people. Large outbreaks of meningococ-
cal disease have occurred in central African
countries, with attack rates as high as 400–500
cases per 100,000 people. Epidemics of meningo-
coccal disease have occurred in many parts of the
world.
Meningococci of group A are associated with
diseases
in
underdeveloped
countries;
meningococci of group B, C or Y are responsible
for most (90%) of the cases of meningococcal
diseases in the developed countries (Table 27.4).
Habitat
N. meningitidis is primarily a pathogen of
humans. Meningococci are found in the naso-
pharynx and oral cavity. Asymptomatic carriage
of N. meningitidis varies from as low as 1% to as
high as 40% in the population. The carriage rates
are highest in school-going children, in young
adults and the population with low economic
status.

Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Human is the only reservoir of meningococcal
infection. Nasopharyngeal secretion is the most
common source of infection. Meningococci are
transmitted by airborne droplets of infected naso-
pharyngeal secretions (the most common source
of infection). Family members living in crowded
conditions or the people who live in close
populations
(such
as
military
barracks
and
prisons) and older people are more susceptible
to infection.
The exact prevalence of meningococcal dis-
ease in India is largely unknown. However,
large outbreaks and sporadic cases have been
reported, which indicate a low prevalence of
around 2.7% among all conﬁrmed cases of men-
ingitis. Meningococcal disease in India is caused
predominantly by serogroup A though other
serogroups, namely B, C, W and Y, have also
been reported.
Prevention and Control
This includes antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis
and vaccines.
Antimicrobial Chemoprophylaxis
Antimicrobial
chemoprophylaxis
of
close
contacts is the key component in preventing sec-
ondary cases of sporadic meningococcal disease.
Person-to-person transmission can be interrupted
by the administration of antibiotics which eradi-
cate the asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier
state.
Sulphonamides,
rifampin,
minocycline,

ciproﬂoxacin and ceftriaxone are frequently used
to eradicate meningococci from the nasopharynx.

Neisseria and Moraxella
Vaccines
Four types of meningococcal vaccines, including
two conjugate vaccines and recombinant protein
vaccines, are available against meningococci. The
conjugate vaccines contain meningococcal A, C,
W and Y polysaccharides conjugated to diphthe-
ria toxoid protein carrier. It does not contain any
preservative or an adjuvant. The other vaccines
contain recombinant proteins like Neisserial
adhesin A (NadA), Neisserial Heparin Binding
Antigen (NHBA) and factor H binding protein
(fHbp) along with Outer Membrane Vesicles
(OMV) and aluminium hydroxide as adjuvants.
The latter protects against infections caused by
the B serogroup.
Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide
vaccine
(MPSV4)
is
effective
against
the
meningococci
infections
caused
by
serogroups A, C, W135 and Y. This vaccine is
injected intramuscularly. These vaccines are not
effective in children under 2 years of age.
Tetravalent
meningococcal
polysaccharide-
protein conjugate vaccine (MCV4) is being used
for the people aged 11–55 years for vaccination
against meningococci in the United States.
The conjugate vaccines that protect against the
four serogroups are administered to adolescents
in two doses. The ﬁrst dose is given at 11 or
12 years of age, followed by the second dose at
16 years of age. In addition, this is also
administered to the at-risk population, including
immunocompromised
people,
travellers
to
endemic regions and laboratory personnel. The
recombinant vaccine against serogroup B is
recommended for people 10 years or older who
are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococ-
cal diseases like patients with splenectomy, com-
plement deﬁciencies and outbreaks. Usually,
more than a single dose is required for effective
protection
as
protective
antibodies
decrease
quickly after vaccination with the latter type.
No vaccine is available against the group B
meningococci due to their non-immunogenic
property of capsular antigen. However, lately,
progress has been achieved in developing vaccine
preparation against group B meningococci. At
present, the vaccine is in the experimental stage
and constitutes an OMP that helps stimulate
group-speciﬁc bactericidal antibodies.
Commensal Neisseria
Commensal Neisseria is found as part of normal
bacterial ﬂora, mostly of the respiratory tract.
These include Neisseria ﬂavescens, Neisseria
sicca,
Neisseria
lactamica
and
Neisseria
subﬂava. The commensal Neisseria differs from
pathogenic Neisseria species. They can grow on
ordinary agar not enriched with blood and serum
and can also grow at 22 C. They do not require a
high percentage of CO2 for their growth. They
produce greenish-yellow or yellow colonies on
the media.
N.
ﬂavescens
and
N.
sicca
have
been
associated with isolated cases of meningitis, oste-
omyelitis, acute otitis media and acute sinusitis.
Most
of
these
strains
are
susceptible
to
penicillins.
Lactamica
is
frequently
isolated
from the nasopharynx.
Genus Moraxella
Neisseria
catarrhalis—which
was
later
designated as Branhamella catarrhalis and is
now renamed Moraxella catarrhalis—is a com-
mensal of the upper respiratory tract and is occa-
sionally found in the female genital tract. It is a
recognised respiratory opportunistic pathogen in
the immunocompromised host and hospitalised
people.
Genus Moraxella consists of at least seven
species that can cause infections in humans.
These are M. catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata,
Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis,
Moraxella
phenylpyruvica
and
Moraxella
atlantae. These are Gram-negative diplococci or
coccobacilli.
M. catarrhalis is the most important human
pathogen. It is found as a normal commensal in
the respiratory tract of humans. It is a Gram-
negative coccus measuring about 0.8 μm in diam-
eter. It is arranged singly or in pairs with adjacent
sides ﬂattened. The bacteria are also found in

groups of tetrads. Most strains grow on nutrient
agar, blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey
agar. After 24 h of incubation on blood agar, they
produce non-haemolytic, white or greyish, con-
vex colonies with entire margins. On prolonged
incubation at 4 h, the colonies become large with
elevated margins and a raised opaque centre. The
bacteria do not grow on the media selective for
gonococci due to the presence of colistin, to
which it is sensitive.

M.
catarrhalis
is
oxidase-

positive. It is differentiated from Neisseria spe-
cies by a positive DNAse test and a positive
tributyrin hydrolysis test. It is an opportunistic
pathogen, a common cause of bronchitis and
bronchopneumonia seen in patients with chronic
pulmonary disease and elderly patients. The bac-
terium is also associated with sinusitis and otitis,
most commonly in healthy people. In immuno-
compromised patients and children, it causes
infections (e.g. otitis media, maxillary sinusitis,
meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, sepsis) in
immunocompromised patients and children. It is
multi-drug resistant and is resistant to penicillins
due to the production of beta-lactamases but is
susceptible
to
other
antibiotics,
such
as
trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, erythromycin,

Case Study
A 22-year-old female complained of lower
abdominal pain on and off for the last 3 months.
She complained of a feeling of heaviness in the
pelvis and pain during sexual intercourse. A ten-
der mass was found on the right side during the
examination. Gram staining of cervical swab
showed plenty of pus cells and a few Gram-
negative cocci. She gave a history of allergy to

Corynebacterium and Coryneform
Bacteria
28
The
genus
Corynebacterium
consists
of
136 recognised species, of which at least 30 spe-
cies are known to be associated with human
diseases.
Genus Corynebacterium
Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causal agent of
diphtheria, is the most widely studied species.
Non-diphtherial
corynebacteria—collectively
referred to as diphtheroids—originally were
believed to be mainly contaminants. These
diphtheroids have recently been recognised as
pathogenic, especially in immunocompromised
hosts (Table 28.1).
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
C. diphtheriae is the most important species caus-
ing diphtheria. Diphtheria is an acute upper respi-
ratory tract illness characterised by sore throat,
low-grade fever and an adherent membrane on
the tonsil(s), pharynx and/or nose.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C.
diphtheriae
is
a
Gram-positive
bacillus
showing
maximum
pleomorphism
on
Gram
staining. The bacteria characteristically appear in
palisades or as individual cells lying at sharp
angles to each other in V and L formation. This
Chinese letter pattern formation or cuneiform
arrangement is caused by the incomplete separa-
tion of the daughter cells during division when
the organism is grown on nutritionally inadequate
media, such as coagulated egg medium or
Loefﬂer coagulated serum.

The bacterium measures 3–6  0.6–0.8 μm,
slender and sometimes has swollen ends. Most
bacteria have two to three granules at the swollen
ends, which give reddish-purple colour when
stained with Loefﬂer alkaline methylene blue.
The rest of the bacterium is unevenly stained
with the dye. The granules are also known as
metachromatic granules, Babe–Ernest granules
or volutin granules. These granules, which are
the accumulation of polymerised phosphates, are
responsible for the beaded appearance of the bac-
teria. The granules can be demonstrated by spe-
cial staining techniques, such as Albert stain,
Neisser stain and Ponder stain.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
C.
diphtheriae
grows
best
under
aerobic
conditions. It grows on media enriched with
blood, serum or egg.
Loefﬂer serum slope is an enriched medium
frequently used for the culture of C. diphtheriae.
The bacteria, on this medium, produce a luxuriant
growth in 6–8 h at a temperature of 37 C.
Initially, the colonies are small, circular, opaque
and white, but on prolonged incubation, the

colonies become larger and show a distinctly
yellow tint. Loefﬂer serum slope does not support
the growth of streptococci and pneumococci.

MacLeod or Hoyle tellurite blood agar
media are examples of selective media used for
the culture of C. diphtheriae. Tellurite (0.04%)
present in the media inhibits the growth of other
contaminant bacteria. On the tellurite agar,
C. diphtheriae produces characteristic grey or
black coloured colonies after 48 h of incubation
(Fig. 28.1). C. diphtheriae reduces tellurite to
metallic tellurium, which is incorporated in the
colonies, giving them a characteristic grey or
black colour. C. diphtheriae is classiﬁed into
three distinct biotypes (mitis, intermedius and
gravis) based on the colony morphologies on
cysteine tellurite agar (Table 28.2).

The bacteria do not ferment lactose, mannitol and

Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Diphtheria bacilli are readily killed by heating at
58 C for 10 min and 100 C for 1 min. The usual
strengths of antiseptics destroy them. They are
resistant to the action of light, desiccation and
freezing. They remain fully virulent and viable
in-ﬂoor dust and blankets even for up to 5 weeks.
Pathogenesis
Diphtheria is a classic example of toxin-mediated
bacterial disease.
Virulence Factors
Diphtheria toxin produced by C. diphtheriae is
the key virulence factor of the bacteria.
Diphtheria Toxin
Diphtheria toxin is an exotoxin. This is produced
only by C. diphtheriae (tox+ strains) containing
intracellular
structural tox
genes.
The
gene
responsible for toxin production is present in the
prophage chromosome (corynephages (tox+)).
However, the tox gene expression is regulated
by a bacterial repressor protein. This repressor
protein is activated by iron molecules, and thus,
iron inﬂuences the production of toxins. The pres-
ence of iron at 0.1 mg/L in the medium is opti-
mum for producing the toxin. Non-toxigenic
strains can become toxigenic by acquiring beta
bacteriophages. This process is known as phage
conversion or lysogenic conversion. Such lyso-
genic bacteria produce high levels of toxin only
under iron-deﬁcient conditions.
Diphtheria toxin is a powerful exotoxin. As
little as 0.0001 mg can cause death in a 250 g
guinea pig in 96 h. It is a protein with a molecular

weight of 58,000 Da. It consists of two function-
ally distinct polypeptide chain fragments A
(24,000-Da protein) and B (38,000-Da protein).
A disulphide bridge links both fragments. Frag-
ment A is the active component of the toxin.
Fragment B is the binding component that binds
toxins to the cells. Neither of the fragments is
toxigenic on their own, but act together to cause
toxigenicity. The toxin is activated by the
enzymes such as proteases present in the infected
cells. The toxin binds to a speciﬁc receptor (now
known as the HB-EGF receptor) present on sus-
ceptible cells and enters by a process known as
receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Corynebacterium and Coryneform Bacteria
Pathogenesis of Diphtheria
C. diphtheriae is transmitted by nasopharyngeal
secretions or infected skin lesions. It usually
enters the body through the upper respiratory
tract but can also enter through the skin, genital
tract or eye. Infection begins by adherence of
toxigenic strains in the nasopharyngeal cavity.
Non-toxigenic C. diphtheria can often indirectly
obtain the tox gene by releasing toxigenic
corynebacteriophage
and
in
situ
lysogenic
conversion.
Growth and multiplication of C. diphtheriae
are restricted to the nasopharynx, the site of infec-
tion. Toxaemia and the systemic manifestation of
diphtheria occur due to the absorption of toxin
from the membrane site in the nasopharyngeal
cavity.
The toxin binds to the HB-EGF receptor is
present on cells and enters the cell by receptor-
mediated endocytosis. A fragment of the toxin is
cleaved and released from the B subunit. Frag-
ment A then gains entry into the cell and catalyses
ADP ribosylation. This leads to the inhibition of
the NAD in protein synthesis. Ultimately, inacti-
vation of all the host–cell EF-2 (elongation factor)
molecules causes cell death, which clinically
manifests as the necrotic lesion of diphtheria.
Clinical Syndromes
The clinical manifestations of diphtheria depend
upon the following: (1) immune status of the
patient, (2) virulence of the bacteria and (3) the
site of the infection.
Respiratory Diphtheria
It is usually caused by toxigenic strains (tox+) of
C. diphtheriae. The incubation period varies from
2 to 5 days. Sore throat is the usual initial symp-
tom in the absence of systemic complaints.
The initial lesion usually occurs on the tonsils
and oropharynx, and from this site, it may spread
to the nasopharynx, larynx and trachea. The
organisms multiply rapidly in the epithelial
cells, resulting in a local lesion and secreting
exotoxins that cause necrosis of the cells in that
area. The combination of cell debris and exuda-
tive inﬂammatory response (leading to accumula-
tion of red blood cells, necrosed cells, bacteria,
ﬁbrin and lymphocytes) results in the formation
of the characteristic pseudomembrane of diphthe-
ria (Fig. 28.2). This is formed on the palate,
pharynx, epiglottis, larynx or trachea and may
extend to the tracheobronchial tree. It is thick,
leathery, greyish-blue or white. The membrane
adheres
very
tenaciously
to
the
underlying
mucosa, and if attempts are made to remove it
forcibly, the raw bleeding surface is exposed.
Spreading of the membrane down the bronchial
tree can occur, causing respiratory tract obstruc-
tion and dyspnoea. The condition is associated
with marked oedema of the tonsils, uvula, sub-
mandibular region and anterior neck (bull neck).
Complications occur following the effect of
toxins on various sites. These include myocardi-
tis, neurotoxicity, kidney failure, pneumonia.
Cutaneous Diphtheria
Cutaneous diphtheria is generally caused by
non-toxigenic
strains
(tox
strains)
of
C. diphtheriae. The condition is an indolent
non-progressive infection of the skin. It is
characterised by a superﬁcial, non-healing ulcer
with a grey-brown membrane. Extremities are
affected more often than the trunk or head. Cuta-
neous diphtheria often causes no toxicity while
producing natural immunity. However, it may
cause
epidemics
in
poorly
immunised
populations.

Diphtheria of Other Sites
The external ear, eye (usually the palpebral
conjunctivae) and genital mucosa are the other
sites
of
diphtheria.
Septicaemia
caused
by
C. diphtheriae is rare but is invariably fatal.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is carried out not for the
treatment of individual cases. It is carried out
only for epidemiological purposes and for the
initiation of control measures of diphtheria.
Specimens
These include swabs from the nose, throat, pieces
of pseudomembrane, if possible, even from
beneath the membrane, biopsy tissue etc. At
least two swabs from the infected site are
obtained. The ﬁrst swab is used to make a direct
smear, and the other is used for the culture.
The specimens are collected as soon as possi-
ble when diphtheria is suspected, even if treat-
ment with antibiotics has been started. These are
then transported to the laboratory in a sterile
empty container or silica gel sachets for immedi-
ate processing.
Microscopy
Gram stain of the smear shows Gram-positive
bacilli with swollen ends. The bacteria character-
istically appear in palisades or as individual cells
lying at sharp angles to each other in V and L
formation. This Chinese letter pattern formation
or cuneiform arrangement is caused by the incom-
plete separation of the daughter cells during
division.
Albert, Neisser or Ponder stain of direct
smears shows metachromatic granules in the
bacilli (Fig. 28.3). These granules are also
known
as Babe–Ernest
granules
or
volutin
granules. These granules are rich in polymerised


phosphates, which are responsible for the beaded
appearance of the bacteria. Most bacteria have
two to three granules at the swollen ends, which
give reddish-purple colour when stained with
Loefﬂer alkaline methylene blue.

Examination of smears, however, has many
limitations. First, diphtheria bacilli may not
always be demonstrated in the smears. Second,
it may be difﬁcult to differentiate the bacilli from
commensal corynebacteria frequently found in
the throat.
Direct Immunofluorescence
It
is
useful
for
detecting
and
identifying
C. diphtheriae in smears collected from the
pseudomembrane
using
a
speciﬁc
antibody
tagged with ﬂuorescent dye.
Culture and Identification
The culture of specimens for C. diphtheriae is
essential to conﬁrm the diagnosis of diphtheria.
The specimens are inoculated on non-selective
media (e.g. sheep blood agar) as well as on selec-
tive media (e.g. tellurite agar) or enriched media
(e.g.
Loefﬂer,
Hoyle,
Mueller
or
Tinsdale
medium).
Loefﬂer serum slope is an enriched medium
frequently used for the culture of C. diphtheriae.
After inoculation of the specimens, the bacteria
produce a luxuriant growth in 6–8 h at a tempera-
ture of 37 C. Initially, the colonies are small,
circular, opaque and white, but on prolonged
incubation, the colonies become larger and show
a distinctly yellow tint. Loefﬂer serum slope does
not support the growth of streptococci and
pneumococci. Hence culture on sheep blood
agar is required to differentiate C. diphtheria
from these bacteria causing pharyngitis, mimick-
ing diphtheria.
MacLeod or Hoyle tellurite blood agar is very
useful for isolating C. diphtheriae from contacts,
carriers and convalescents. This is because

clinical specimens obtained contain several other
bacteria. Tellurite (0.04%) present in the media
inhibits the growth of other contaminant bacteria.
On the tellurite agar, C. diphtheriae produces
characteristic grey or black coloured colonies
after 48 h of incubation. The bacteria reduce
tellurite
to
metallic
tellurium,
which
is
incorporated in the colonies, giving them a char-
acteristic grey or black colour. C. diphtheriae is
classiﬁed into three distinct biotypes, mitis,
intermedius and gravis, based on the colony
morphologies
on
cysteine
tellurite
agar
(Table 28.2).
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
401
Grams staining of colony isolate shows Gram-
positive bacilli showing a Chinese letter pattern
formation or cuneiform arrangement. Identiﬁed
by biochemical tests and production of toxins as
follows:
C. diphtheriae ferments many sugars (glucose,
galactose, maltose and dextrin), producing acid
but no gas. Hiss serum water is always used for
testing the fermentation of sugars. The bacteria do
not ferment lactose, mannitol and sucrose. Some
strains of virulent C. diphtheriae ferment sucrose.
Toxigenicity Testing
All strains of C. diphtheriae are tested for the
production of toxins. In vivo tests and in vitro
tests can demonstrate the production of toxins.
Currently, in vivo tests such as subcutaneous
and intradermal tests in guinea pigs and rabbits
are
not being
used because
of restrictions
imposed by animal protection acts. In vitro tests
are increasingly used.
Fig. 28.4 Diagrammatic
representation of Elek gel
precipitation test
In Vitro Tests for Detection
of Diphtheria Toxin
Elek gel precipitation test is an immunoprecipita-
tion test for demonstration of biological activity
of the toxin, initially described in 1949. It is an
in vitro neutralisation reaction between toxin and
antitoxin. A modiﬁed test recommended by Diph-
theria reference Unit, WHO, is currently used. In
this method, a rectangular strip of ﬁlter paper
impregnated with diphtheria antitoxin (10 IU/
mL)
is
placed
on
horse
serum
agar.
C. diphtheriae to be tested for toxicity is streaked
on the medium at right angles to the ﬁlter paper
strip. A known toxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae
(positive control) and non-toxigenic strain of
C.
diphtheriae
(negative
control)
are
also
inoculated along with the test strain at right angles
to the strip. The plate is incubated for 48 h. The
toxin produced by the growth of the test strain
diffuses into the agar and reacts with the anti-
toxin, thereby forming the line of precipitation.
In strains that are negative, no precipitin lines are
seen (Fig. 28.4).
Tissue Culture Test
Chinese hamster ovary cell lines and African
green monkey kidney cell lines are used to detect
the production of toxins. The toxigenicity of
diphtheria
bacilli
is
demonstrated
by
incorporating strains in an agar overlay of cell
culture monolayers. The toxin produced by the
bacteria diffuses into the cells below and kills the
cells in the monolayer.

402
28
Corynebacterium and Coryneform Bacteria
Sero
Immunochromatography and ELISA tests are
being used to detect the toxin of isolates of
C. diphtheriae from clinical specimens.
Molecular Detection
A polymerase chain reaction is a useful method
for directly detecting the toxigenic strain of
C. diphtheriae in a clinical specimen. The assay
allows detection of the diphtherial toxin gene
(TOX) in the bacteria. The test can also detect
non-viable
C.
diphtheriae
organisms
in
specimens collected even after starting antibiotic
therapy.
Among all the tools, real-time PCR is the
preferred choice for detecting diphtheria toxin-
encoding gene tox in an isolate or specimen. It
shows accuracy to differentiate C. diphtheriae
and Corynebacterium ulcerans despite the tox
genes of both organisms differ from each other
in about 5% of their base pair. TaqMan hydrolysis
and LightCycler hybridisation probes are the two
most widely applied real-time PCR detection
methods used in diagnosis.
Typing of Corynebactrium diphtheriae
The use of “Typing” of C. diphtheriae strains by
various methods helps in global monitoring of the
spread of this important pathogen. Further, it
helps in outbreak containment, identifying the
index case in any outbreak, and understanding
the spread in the community, country and inter-
continental spread.
Serotyping
Serotyping of C. diphtheriae strains is classiﬁed
into various serotypes by agglutination reactions.
Mitis strains have been classiﬁed into 40 types,
intermedius into four types, and gravis into
13 types. Gravis type-II strains are found world-
wide, whereas types I and III are commonly
found in Great Britain. Type IV is mainly found
in Egypt, whereas type V is found in the United
States.
Bacteriophage Typing
So far, about 15 bacteriophage types have been
identiﬁed. The mitis includes types I and III,
intermedius includes types IV and VI, avirulent
gravis includes type VII and remaining bacterio-
phage types come under virulent gravis type of
C. diphtheriae.
Biotyping
Bio typing by automated systems using biochem-
ical tests is frequently used. Four biotypes,
namely mitis, gravis, intermedius and belfanti,
are noted, of which most of the outbreaks
reported are due to gravis.
Molecular Typing
Molecular typing of C. diphtheriae strains can
also be done using molecular biology techniques.
These include restriction endonuclease digestion
patterns of C. diphtheriae chromosomal DNA
and genetic probe for cloned corynebacterial
insertion sequences. In ribotyping, strains are
typed with the BstEII enzyme, and individual
patterns are compared and analysed. Besides,
pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random
ampliﬁcation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and
ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
have also been used in typing.
Treatment
Treatment of diphtheria is started immediately on
clinical suspicion and diagnosis of diphtheria.
Diphtheria antitoxin is the mainstay of therapy
in diphtheria. Diphtheria antitoxin is a hyper-
immune antiserum produced in horses. The dos-
age
recommended
is
20,000–100,000
U
depending on the severity of the infection. The
antitoxin is administered by the intravenous route
with infusion over 30–60 min. The antitoxin
neutralises only free toxin before the toxin enters
the cells but is ineffective after the toxin has
entered the cell. Antitoxin appears to be of no
value in treating cutaneous diphtheria and in the
treatment of asymptomatic carriers.
Antimicrobial therapy is useful in the treat-
ment of diphtheria. Antibiotics limit the produc-
tion of toxins, eradicate diphtheria bacteria from
infected hosts and prevent transmission of the
bacteria
to
patient
contacts.
Penicillin
and

erythromycin
are
the
only
antibiotics
recommended for treatment. Both antibiotics are
equally effective in resolving fever and local
symptoms. Erythromycin is marginally superior
in eradicating the carrier state. Elimination of the
bacteria is demonstrated by at least two succes-
sive negative nose and throat cultures or skin
cultures obtained 24 h’ apart after the completion
of the therapy. Treatment with erythromycin is
repeated if culture results remain positive. Antibi-
otic therapy, however, is not a substitute for anti-
toxin therapy.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
403
Epidemiology
Geogrphical Distribution
The largest epidemic of diphtheria occurred from
1990 to 1996 throughout the states of the former
Soviet Union. Most cases were reported among
adolescents and adults rather than children. More
than 110,000 cases and 2900 fatalities from diph-
theria were reported during the epidemic. In the
United States, Europe and Eastern Europe, recent
diphtheria
outbreaks
have
occurred
largely
among alcohol and/or drug abusers.
Habitat
The upper respiratory tract of an infected host is
the primary habitat of C. diphtheriae. The bacte-
ria also inhbit the superﬁcial layer of the skin
lesions.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission of
Infections
Humans are the only natural host and thus are the
only
signiﬁcant
reservoirs
of
infection
of
C. diphtheriae. Common sources of infection
include infective droplets or nasopharyngeal
secretions. Direct human contact facilitates the
transmission of the disease. Patients with active
infection are more likely to spread the infection.
When diphtheria was endemic, the disease was
most commonly seen in children younger than
15 years. Recently, the epidemiology has shifted
to adults. This is because adults lacked natural
exposure to toxigenic C. diphtheriae in the vac-
cine era and also received fewer booster doses.
Both
symptomatic
and
asymptomatic
individuals transmit diphtheria and contribute to
global epidemiology. However, the asymptom-
atic carriers result in ~70% fewer infections
cases than symptomatic individuals. Such asymp-
tomatic cases are identiﬁed through contact
tracing.
Prevention and Control
In diphtheria, immunity against clinical diseases
depends on the presence of antitoxin in the blood-
stream in response to clinical or sub-clinical dis-
ease or active immunisation. Infants below
6 months of age carry IgG antibodies derived
from the immune mother either transplacentally
or through breastfeeding. The antibodies later
developed are IgG and IgA types. Most young
children are highly susceptible to infection in
areas where diphtheria is endemic, and mass
immunisation is not practised.
Prevention of diphtheria can be achieved by
either active, passive or combined immunisation.
Active Immunisation
Vaccines
Active immunisation by vaccination with diph-
theria toxoid is the key to preventing diphtheria.
Two types of toxoids are available. Fool toxoid is
prepared by treating the exotoxin with formalde-
hyde. This treatment inactivates the toxic effects
but maintains the antigenicity. Adsorbed toxoid is
prepared by adsorbing puriﬁed toxoid, usually
with aluminium phosphate as an adsorbent. This
also acts as an adjuvant and increases the immu-
nogenicity of the vaccines. Adsorbed toxoid,
therefore, is more immunogenic than the formol
toxoid. Administration of the vaccine stimulates
the production of antibodies with speciﬁc protec-
tive properties. Serum antitoxin concentration of
0.01 IU/mL is usually accepted as the minimum
protective level, and 0.1 IU/mL provides a deﬁ-
nitely protective level.
DTP or triple vaccines are typically com-
bined with tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis
(triple DTaP vaccine). It is the vaccine of choice

for children aged 6 weeks to 6 years, as
recommended by the Universal Immunisation
Programme. Diphtheria toxoid is given in a dos-
age of 10–25 Lf (limit of ﬂocculation) to all the
children.
404
28
Corynebacterium and Coryneform Bacteria
The primary immunisation schedule for
infants and children consists of the ﬁrst three
doses of DTP, separated by a minimum of
4 weeks. The fourth dose is given 1 year after
the third dose. A booster dose is given at the age
of 4–6 years. A further booster dose is given at
school entry. For adults and children older than
7 years, a lower dose of diphtheria toxoid (Td) is
the vaccine of choice, and the primary series
comprises three doses. For pregnant mothers,
the National Immunization schedule advocated
the administration of the adult dose of diphtheria
vaccine, Td, as mentioned above, early in preg-
nancy followed by a second dose following
4 weeks after Td-1. In case of vaccination as per
the above schedule in a previous pregnancy
within 3 years, a single booster dose of Td is
required.
The vaccine decreases local tissue spread of
C. diphtheria. It also prevents toxic complications
and diminishes transmission of diphtheria. The
vaccine provides herd immunity when at least
70–80% of a population is immunised. However,
it does not prevent the subsequent respiratory or
cutaneous carriage of toxigenic C. diphtheriae.
Passive Immunisation
Passive
immunisation
is
carried
out
by
administering 500–1000 U of antidiphtheritic
serum (ADS) injected subcutaneously. The effec-
tive neutralisation of diphtheria toxin is mediated
by antitoxin with a long half-life period present in
the ADS. ADS is usually recommended as an
emergency
measure
for
treating
susceptible
persons. It helps to reduce the fatality rate most
effectively.
Combined Immunisation
Combined immunisation is carried out by simul-
taneous administration of ADS and diphtheria
toxoid. The ADS is given in one arm, whereas
the toxoid is given in the other arm, followed by a
complete schedule of vaccination with toxoid.
Other Pathogenic Corynebacterium
Species
C. ulcerans usually causes skin infections but is
occasionally
associated
with
diphtheria-like
lesions, such as pharyngitis and respiratory dis-
ease. It resembles C. diphtheriae gravis type but
differs from it by (1) reducing nitrate to nitrite,
(2) liquefying gelatin and (3) fermenting treha-
lose. C. ulcerans produces two types of toxins:
one resembles that of C. diphtheriae, and the
other resembles that of Corynebacterium pseudo-
tuberculosis. It is also pathogenic for animals.
The bacteria can cause infection in cows and
can be transmitted to humans through milk.
Antidiphtheria toxin confers protection against
the infection caused by C. ulcerans.
C. pseudotuberculosis causes infection in
immunocompromised hosts. It causes native and
prosthetic valve endocarditis, pneumonia, lung
abscesses,
tracheobronchitis
and
suppurative
lymphadenitis. Corynebacterium jeikeium can is
another species that colonise the skin of healthy
people. It is an opportunistic pathogen in immu-
nocompromised patients with haematological
disorders or intravascular catheters.
Corynebacterium urealyticum is an important
agent of urinary tract infection. The bacterium has
been reported to cause chronic or recurrent cysti-
tis, bladder stones and pyelonephritis. People
with prior urinary tract abnormalities or recent
urologic procedures are at the highest risk for
this disease. Corynebacterium striatum is found
on catheters in patients with neutropenia and
malignancies. The bacterium causes respiratory
tract infections and foreign body infections. Cory-
nebacterium haemolyticum causes as many as
10% of all pharyngitis cases in patients between
10 and 30 years. The bacteria produce an extra-
cellular toxin that causes an erythrogenic rash
associated with pharyngitis.

conjunctiva and other areas. Only recently the
role of these organisms in causing human
infections has been recognised. The most com-
mon
diphtheroids
include
Corynebacterium
xerosis found in the human conjunctival sac and
Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum found in
the human throat; also, these are found to be
associated with human infections. Differences

summarised in Table 28.3.
Coryneform Bacteria
Besides genus Corynebacterium, other genera of
irregularly shaped, Gram-positive bacteria have
been identiﬁed to colonise and cause disease in

Case Study
An 8-year-old child was admitted to the hospital
with low-grade fever (<100 F), malaise, dyspha-
gia and headache. Examination revealed a ﬁbri-
nous membrane on the pharynx. A pair of swabs
collected from the membrane was sent to the
microbiology
laboratory
to
diagnose
C. diphtheriae. The child was administered anti-
toxin by the intravenous route and treated with
antibiotics. Subsequently, the laboratory report
conﬁrmed isolation of a toxigenic C. diphtheriae
from the specimen 3 days later.

Bacillus
29
The family Bacillaceae consists of rod-shaped
Gram-positive bacteria that form endospores.
The family includes two main groups of spore-
forming bacteria: The anaerobic spore-forming
bacteria of the genus Clostridium and the aerobic
or facultatively anaerobic spore-forming bacteria
of the genus Bacillus.
The Genus Bacillus
The genus Bacillus is frequently known as aerobic
spore bearers. They are ubiquitous and are present
in soil, dust, air and water. These bacteria are also
frequently isolated as contaminants in bacteriolog-
ical culture media. The genus Bacillus consists of
more than 50 species. Bacillus anthracis and
Bacillus cereus are the two most important species
that cause infections in humans and animals.
B. anthracis causes anthrax, while B. cereus causes
food poisoning. The human infections caused by
Bacillus species are summarised in Table 29.1.
Bacillus anthracis
B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, has a
worldwide distribution. Anthrax is caused by inha-
lation,
skin
exposure
or
gastrointestinal
(GI) absorption. The use of anthrax as a biological
warfare agent is an additional concern now.
B. anthracis is of considerable historical inter-
est due to many reasons. It was the ﬁrst
pathogenic bacterium to be seen under a micro-
scope. It was the ﬁrst bacterium shown to be the
cause of a disease. From studies on anthrax, Koch
established his famous postulates in 1876. Robert
Koch cultured the B. anthracis using pure culture
in 1877 and proved the anthrax bacilli’s ability to
form endospores. He also produced anthrax in
experimental
animals
by
administering
B. anthracis spores. It was the ﬁrst bacterium to
be isolated in pure culture and shown to possess
spores. For the ﬁrst time, spores were discovered
from B. anthracis and Bacillus subtilis by Koch
and Cohn, and they established the germ theory of
disease. It was the ﬁrst bacterium used to prepare
attenuated vaccines by Louis Pasteur.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
B. anthracis is a Gram-positive spore-forming
bacillus. It is a very large bacillus measuring
1–1.2 am in width and 3–5 μm in length. In
smears from infected tissues, the bacteria are
found as single, in pairs and short chains, the
entire chain being surrounded by a capsule. In
culture, B. anthracis grows as long chains and
may appear similar to streptobacilli. In these
chains, the bacilli are arranged end-to-end, and
the ends of the bacilli are truncated, not rounded,
or often concave and somewhat swollen. This
gives the chain of bacilli a bamboo-stick
appearance.

It is capsulated. The bacterium forms the cap-
sule only when grown on nutrient agar containing
0.7% sodium bicarbonate in the presence of
5–20% carbon dioxide. The capsule is a polypep-
tide (polymer of d-glutamic acid) in nature. It
protects the bacteria against leucocytic phagocy-
tosis and lysis. It is usually formed in the tissues
but is absent when grown in ordinary culture
conditions. It is easily visualised using a methy-
lene blue or India ink stain. A 60-megadalton
plasmid, pX02, mediate the production of the
capsule. Therefore, the transfer of this plasmid
to non-capsulated B. anthracis by transduction
makes the recipient strain capsulated.
Spores
Gram staining of B. anthracis shows the charac-
teristic squared ends with spores as unstained
spaces. Anthrax spores are oval, central in posi-
tion and are refractile. They are of the same width
as the bacillary body, so they do not cause bulg-
ing of vegetative cells. The anthrax spore consists
of the central protoplast, cortex and spore coat.
The central protoplastor germ cell of the spore
carries the constituents of the future vegetative
cell. It also consists of dipicolinic acid, which is
responsible for the heat resistance property of the
spore. The cortex surrounding the protoplast
consists
largely
of
peptidoglycan
(murein),
which protects the spore from radiation and
heat. As the spores germinate, the cortical mem-
brane or protoplast wall acts as the cell wall for
the new vegetative cell. The sport coat comprises
50% of the spore’s volume and protects the spores
from enzymes, chemicals etc.
The spores are highly refractile and are resis-
tant to staining, heat, cold, radiation, desiccation
and disinfectants. Spores are never found in host
tissues unless the infected body ﬂuids are exposed
to ambient air.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
B. anthracis is an aerobe and facultative anaer-
obe. The bacteria grow at a temperature range of
12–45 C, the optimum temperature being 37 C.
They grow on a wide range of media, including
ordinary nutrient media and several selective
media.
On nutrient agar after 24 h of incubation,
B. anthracis produces greyish and granular
colonies measuring 2–3 mm in diameter. Under
low-power microscopy, the edges of the colony
appear as long, interlacing chains of bacilli,
resembling locks of matted hair, which gives
them a medusa head appearance with an uneven
surface and wavy margin.
B. anthracis on a solid medium containing
0.05–0.5 U of penicillin/mL produces large,
spherical colonies within 3–6 h and occurs in
chains on the surface of the agar, resembling a
string of pearls. This property is known as the
string
of
pearls
reaction
and
is
useful
in
differentiating B. anthracis from B. cereus and
other aerobic spore bearers.
In a gelatin stab, there is growth down the stab
line with lateral spikes, longer near the surface,
giving an inverted ﬁr tree appearance. The lique-
faction process is slow and late, which occurs
after 7 days at 20 C and starts at the surface
(Fig. 29.1).
Knisely
Polymyxin
B-lysozyme-EDTA-
thallous acetate (PLET medium) agar medium
is a selective medium used to isolate B. anthracis
from mixtures containing other spore-bearing
bacilli. The medium comprises heart infusion
agar, polymyxin, lysozyme, ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and thallous acetate.
Production of capsular material is associated
with forming a characteristic mucoid or “smooth”
(S) colony type. Capsulated bacteria on serum or
bicarbonate medium produce smooth or mucoid

colonies. They are virulent strains. Rough (R)
variants that lack capsules are relatively avirulent.

B. anthracis are catalase positive. They dem-
onstrate a weak lecithinase reaction on egg-yolk
agar, which gives a narrow zone of opalescence
around the colonies. They reduce nitrate to nitrite
and

from
glucose,
maltose,
sucrose, trehalose and dextrin, but not from lac-
tose, arabinose, d-xylose or d-mannitol.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents:
Bacillus vegetative forms are susceptible to moist
heat; they are killed at 60 C in 30 min. Bacillus
spores are resistant to hostile physical and chemi-
cal conditions, ranging from desert sands and hot
springs to Arctic soils and freshwater to marine
sediments. They remain viable at temperatures,
pH values and salt concentrations at which few
other organisms could survive. The spores may
survive in the dry state and certain soils for
50 years or more. They survive in 5% phenol
for weeks. The spores are killed by moist heat at
100 C in 60 min. They are also killed by 4%
(w/v) formaldehyde or 4% (w/v) potassium per-
manganate in a few minutes.
Destruction of the spores in animal products is
achieved by duckering. Duckering is a procedure
that was used to reduce anthrax spores in wool
below critical infection levels without destroying
the animal hairs and bristles. In this procedure,
2% formaldehyde is used at 30–40 C for 20 min
for the disinfection of wool, while 0.25% formal-
dehyde solution is used at 60 C for 6 h for
disinfection of animal hair and bristles.
Antigenic Properties
Three types of antigens are present in anthrax
bacilli.
The capsular antigen is present in virulent
capsulated strains of B. anthracis. Antibodies
against the capsular antigen are not protective.
Cell wall antigen is present in the cell wall and
is
made
up
of
N-acetylglucosamine
and
d-galactose. It cross-reacts with blood group A
antigen and capsular polysaccharide of type
14 Pneumococcus. The antibody against the cell
wall antigen is not protective. The somatic anti-
gen is a heat-labile protein present in the bacterial
body. It stimulates the immune system to produce
protective antibodies.

Virulence factors
Biological functions
Bacterial capsule
Protects anthrax bacilli against leucocytic phagocytosis and lysis; if engulfed, resist killing and
digestion.
Anthrax toxin
complex
Anthrax toxin complex is plasmid-encoded and comprises of the following three proteins.
Protective antigen
(PA)
Entry of the bacilli into the host cell. Binds the complex to receptors on macrophage surface.
Oedema factor
(EF)
Causes cellular oedema within the target tissue and also inhibits neutrophil function. Blocks
adenyl cyclase pathway within cells.
Lethal factor (LF)
Release of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 by macrophages.
Pathogenesis
Virulence Factors
Virulence of B. anthracis (Table 29.2) depends
on the bacterial capsule and anthrax toxin
complex.
Bacterial Capsule
The poly-D-glutamyl capsule is non-toxic. It
protects the bacteria phagocytes. It has a signiﬁ-
cant function in the pathogenesis of anthrax and
has the main role in the development of infection.
Anthrax Toxin Complex
Local and fatal effects are due to the toxins pro-
duced by B. anthracis: Anthrax toxin is an exo-
toxin that is a protein in nature. Anthrax toxin
complex comprises three components: protective
antigen, oedema factor and lethal factor.
Protective antigen (PA) is an 82.7 kDa pro-
tein. It is called PA because antibodies against
this antigen are protective against the action of
anthrax toxin. The PA is the binding (B) domain
of anthrax toxin and is necessary for the entry of
the bacteria into the host cell. It binds to the cell
receptors in the target tissue. After the attach-
ment, an additional binding site is exposed due
to the cleavage of a fragment that combines with
EF to form an oedema toxin or LF to form a lethal
toxin.
Oedema factor is an 88.9 kDa protein. It is a
component
of
the
oedema
toxin.
It
is
a
calmodulin-dependent
adenylate
cyclase
that
converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This causes
an increase in the cellular cAMP levels, leading to
cellular oedema within the target tissues. The
oedema factor also causes inhibition of neutrophil
function and lowers the production of tumour
necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6
(IL-6) by monocytes.
The lethal factor is a 90.2 kDa protein. It is a
zinc metalloprotease that inactivates mitogen-
activated protein kinase, leading to the inhibition
of intracellular signalling. It stimulates the release
of
TNF-alpha
and
interleukin-1
(IL-1)
by
macrophages. This mechanism is thought to con-
tribute to sudden death from toxic effects in
animals with high degrees of bacteraemia. The
local and fatal effects of the infection are due to
the toxins produced by B. anthracis.
Pathogenesis of Cutaneous Anthrax
Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of
anthrax and constitutes more than 95% of the
naturally occurring anthrax. The condition is
caused by the entry of spores through the skin
lacerations, abrasions or through ﬂy bites, usually
on the face, neck or arms.
After ingestion by macrophages at the entry
site, the spores germinate to form the vegetative
forms of the bacteria. Virulent anthrax bacilli
multiply at the site of infection with the produc-
tion of capsules and toxins. Phagocytes migrate to
the area, but the encapsulated anthrax bacilli resist
phagocytic engulfment; or, if engulfed, resist kill-
ing and digestion. The anthrax toxin causes fur-
ther impairment of phagocytic activity and its
lethal effect on leucocytes, including phagocytes,
at the site. The lethal toxin or oedema toxin is
internalised
by
endocytosis.
Oedema
toxin
produces the characteristic oedema of anthrax.
Subsequently, the bacteria and their toxins enter
the circulation, causing systemic morbidity.

Bacillus anthracis
411
Clinical Syndromes
B. anthracis in humans causes anthrax of various
types, such as cutaneous anthrax, gastrointestinal
anthrax,
inhalational
anthrax
and
anthrax
meningitis.
Cutaneous Anthrax
This is commonly found in farmers and persons
handling infected carcasses. People carrying
hides of infected animals may also develop cuta-
neous anthrax, hence called “Hide Porters dis-
ease”. Cutaneous anthrax may progress through
the stages of papule, vesicle and eschar.
The lesion begins as a painless, pruritic papule
at the inoculation site of spores. The papule,
which is the primary lesion, becomes a 1–2-cm
vesicle within 2 days. The vesicle is ﬁlled with
clear or serosanguineous ﬂuid containing numer-
ous large, Gram-positive bacilli and very rare
leucocytes. A characteristic non-pitting, gelati-
nous oedema surrounds the lesion. The vesicle
enlarges, and satellite vesicles may develop. Sub-
sequently, the vesicle ruptures undergo necrosis
and enlarge, forming an ulcer covered by a char-
acteristic black eschar (Fig. 29.2). The skin in
the surrounding areas may become oedematous
and necrotic but not purulent. The name anthrax,
meaning coal, comes from the eschar, which is
black coloured. The lesion is called malignant
pustule due to its characteristic appearance; how-
ever, these lesions are neither malignant nor pus-
tular. Lesions are painless but, on occasion, are
slightly pruritic. Occasionally, multiple bullae
develop along with marked toxic effects, and the
lesions, especially on the face or neck, become
massively oedematous.
Fig. 29.2 Black eschar with a rim of erythema and oedema: cutaneous anthrax (https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=
2033)
Cutaneous anthrax usually remains localised.
Without treatment, the condition spreads to the
blood and disseminates to cause systemic infec-
tion in nearly one-ﬁfth of the cases. Prompt anti-
biotic therapy prevents the dissemination of the
infection but does not affect the natural history of
the lesion. With treatment, the mortality due to
cutaneous anthrax is approximately 1%.
Gastrointestinal Anthrax
The
condition
is
caused
by
ingestion
of
undercooked
meat
of
infected
carcasses
containing spores. The anthrax spores invade the
mucosa of the GI tract and reach mesenteric
lymph nodes. The spores in lymph nodes germi-
nate to vegetative forms and begin multiplying,
causing the occlusion of the lymphatic system.

This leads to ascites, haemorrhagic adenitis and
oedematous stomach and intestine. Abdominal
pain and fever are the ﬁrst symptoms to appear
2–5
days
after
ingesting
the
food.
These
symptoms are followed by nausea, vomiting and
diarrhoea. Without antibiotic therapy, death is
rapid. Mortality is very high and is always more
than 50%.
412
29
Bacillus
Inhalational or Pulmonary Anthrax
Inhalational or pulmonary anthrax is also known
as wool sorters disease. The condition occurs
after inhaling spores into the lungs. The median
lethal
inhalational
dose
for
humans—
extrapolated from data on experimental infection
in
monkeys—has
been
estimated
to
be
2500–55,000 spores. The spores are present in
the dust or the ﬁlaments of wool from infected
animals, particularly in wool factories. Alveolar
macrophages engulf the spores and present them
to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Anthrax in the
lungs
causes
pulmonary
oedema
and
haemorrhagic mediastinitis, but not pneumonia.
Death occurs within 24–36 h. The disease has a
high fatality rate.
Anthrax Meningitis
Anthrax meningitis may occur commonly due to
bacteraemia from inhalational anthrax but is a less
common manifestation of anthrax. The meninges
are
characteristically
haemorrhagic
and
oedematous.
Cerebrospinal
ﬂuid
(CSF)
is
typically haemorrhagic and exhibits a polymor-
phonuclear
pleocytosis.
Numerous
large,
encapsulated,
Gram-positive
bacilli
are
demonstrated in the CSF. Mortality is as high as
100%, but occasionally, patients treated with
antibiotics have survived.
Laboratory Diagnosis
It is essential to follow biosafety (level II)
precautions while handling clinical specimens
suspected
of
anthrax
in
a
microbiology
laboratory.
Specimens
These include vesicular ﬂuid, ﬂuid from under the
eschar (in cutaneous anthrax); blood, lymph node
or splenic aspirates (in septicaemic and inhala-
tional anthrax); CSF (in anthrax meningitis); and
sputum and blood (in inhalational anthrax).
Microscopy
The smears are stained with Gram stain, poly-
chrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) and
Giemsa stain.
Gram-stained smear of a skin lesion (vesicu-
lar
ﬂuid
or
eschar),
CSF
or
blood
show
encapsulated, broad, large, Gram-positive bacilli.
The bacteria are found as single, in pairs and short
chains. The bacilli do not show any spores. By
Gram staining, presumptive identiﬁcation of
anthrax can be made (Fig. 29.3).
Giemsa-stained smears show purple bacilli
surrounded by a red capsule.
Blood
smears
containing
anthrax
bacilli
stained with polychrome methylene blue show
an amorphous purple material around the bacilli.
This amorphous purple material represents the
disintegrated capsule and is a characteristic of
anthrax bacillus. This reaction is known as the
McFadyean reaction and is used for presump-
tive diagnosis of anthrax (Fig. 29.4). In smears
from infected tissues, the bacteria are found as
single, in pairs, and short chains, with the entire
chain being surrounded by a capsule.
Sudan black B stain is used to demonstrate
fat globules within the bacilli.
Direct ﬂuorescent antibody (DFA) test is
used for capsule and polysaccharide cell wall
antigen of the bacteria.
Culture and Identification
Clinical specimens are inoculated on blood or
nutrient agar or specialised selective media to
isolate B. anthracis. Knisely PLET medium is
used to isolate B. anthracis from soil and clinical
materials
containing
numerous
other
spore-
forming bacteria.
The absence of haemolysis on blood agar and
the formation of medusa head colonies are the
characteristic features of B. anthracis. Gram-



positive, spore-forming bacilli in the Gram-
stained smear of the colony, non-motile and cap-
sulated bacteria, positive string-of-pearls test and
lysis by gamma-phage are the identifying features
of B. anthracis.

Animal Inoculation
B. anthracis can be isolated by collecting
specimens from the contaminated tissue and
applying them over the shaven skin sites of
guinea pigs. The bacteria present in the specimen
penetrate the skin through minute abrasions.
Later, the bacilli are demonstrated in the sputum
and heart blood of the guinea pigs, which die
2–3 days after the inoculation.
Serology
Serodiagnosis
of
anthrax
is
based
on
demonstrating antibodies against a protective
antigen in the patient’s serum.
ELISA test has been used extensively to dem-
onstrate serum IgG against the protective antigen.
The test is considered positive if a single acute-
phase serum shows a high titre of antibodies or a
fourfold greater rise in the antibody titre is
observed between acute and convalescent serum
specimens. The test is highly sensitive and spe-
ciﬁc. Speciﬁc IgG anti-PA antibodies are detected
as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms,
but a high IgG level is observed only 40 days after
the onset of symptoms.
Ascoli thermo-precipitation test is used in
animals, mainly for rapid diagnosis when the
tissue received is putrid and viable bacilli are

unlikely to be found. The tissues are ground up in
saline, boiled for 5 min and ﬁltered. When this
extract is layered over the anti-anthrax serum in a
narrow tube, a ring of precipitate appears at the
junction of two liquids within 5 min in a
positive case.

Bacillus
Molecular Detection
B. anthracis-speciﬁc primers can be used for fur-
ther molecular analysis. MLVA (multiple-locus
and strain characterisation) and other techniques
can be used for epidemiological studies and strain
characterisation.
Treatment
B. anthracis is generally sensitive to penicillin;
therefore, penicillin G is the ﬁrst-line treatment.
Penicillin, such as amoxicillin or amoxicillin/
clavulanic
acid,
effectively
treats
cutaneous
anthrax. However, after October 2001, ciproﬂox-
acin or doxycycline is usually recommended due
to
the
possibility
of
genetically engineered
penicillin-resistant anthrax strains.
Patients with inhalational anthrax are treated
with a multidrug regimen of either ciproﬂoxacin
or doxycycline along with at least one more anti-
biotic,
such
as
vancomycin,
imipenem,
meropenem and aminoglycosides. A recombinant
human monoclonal antibody (Raxibacumab) has
been used in prophylaxis since 2012 for inhala-
tional anthrax.
Ciproﬂoxacin or doxycycline for 60 days is
effective against cases of GI anthrax. Doxycy-
cline is not suitable for use in suspected cases of
anthrax meningitis because it has poor penetra-
tion of the central nervous system.
Anthrax
immune
globulin
intravenous
(AIGIV), a human polyclonal antiserum, has
also been used with antibiotics to manage serious
manifestations of anthrax.
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
CDC recommends oral antibiotic therapy in
persons
exposed
to
B.
anthracis.
The
recommended drugs are ciproﬂoxacin or doxycy-
cline. Alternate agents include levoﬂoxacin,
clindamycin,
amoxicillin
or
penicillin
for
penicillin-susceptible strains. Antimicrobial drug
prophylaxis for 60 days for immediate protection
and a 3-dose series of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
for long-term protection is recommended.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Anthrax is distributed worldwide and is present in
the soil as extremely resistant spores. They cause
infection in humans, farms and wild animals fed
with
contaminated
food
or
grazed
on
contaminated ground. The extent of disease is
approximately 20,000–100,000 cases annually
throughout
the
world.
Despite
vaccination
programs, the condition is frequently documented
in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America
and the Indian subcontinent. Epidemics of human
anthrax have been reported in Russia and
Zimbabwe.
Anthrax is enzootic in India. An epizootic
outbreak of anthrax infections in sheep has been
documented in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka. Many human cases of cutaneous and
GI infections have been documented in these
states and other parts of the country.
Habitat
B. anthracis spores are ubiquitous. They are
found in the soil, water and air. Spores are formed
in culture or soil under unfavourable conditions
for growth. Anthrax spores need oxygen for spor-
ulation. These germinate when exposed to a
nutrient-rich condition, such as the tissues or
blood of an animal or human host. Rainfall
stimulates anthrax spore germination while ﬂies
and vultures spread the spores.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Infected animals are reservoirs of infection.
Anthrax
in
humans
is
primarily
zoonotic
(Fig. 29.5). Infected animals or contaminated ani-
mal products (such as hides, wool, hair and ivory
tusks and poorly cooked infected meat) are the
important sources of
infection
for humans.

Humans acquire anthrax infection by close con-
tact with infected animals or contaminated animal
products, such as hides, wool, hair and ivory
tusks (cutaneous anthrax). Ingestion of poorly
cooked infected meat contaminated with anthrax
spores (GI anthrax). Inhalation of aerosolised
anthrax spores associated with the large-scale
processing of hides and wool in enclosed factory
spaces (inhalational anthrax).

Heat resistant spores in soil
Fig. 29.5 Transmission of anthrax
Direct spread of the disease from humans to
humans is rare. Infected animals discharge many
bacilli from their mouth, nose and rectum. These
bacilli sporulate in the soil and remain viable over
a long period. The contaminated soil is an impor-
tant reservoir of infection for animals. Infection
occurs in susceptible animals by ingesting the
spores present in the soil.
Anthrax and Biological Warfare
Inhalation of spores disseminated by terrorists is
an important transmission mode in biological
warfare. The possible use of anthrax spores in
bioterrorism was a major concern. B. anthracis, a
biological weapon used in bioterrorism, was cre-
ated by aerosols containing anthrax spores.
Weapon-grade anthrax spores in bioterrorism
may be dispersed as an aerosol for mass effect
or by restricted spore dissemination and contami-
nation via letters or packages.
CDC Guidelines for Identification After the
Threat of Bioterrorism
CDC has established a Laboratory Response Net-
work (LRN). It is a three-tier system with the
following components:
1. Sentinel
Labs:
These
are
local
clinical
laboratories that can conduct the preliminary
tests of a specimen to rule out the presence of
B. anthracis. If it is unable to rule out, and
anthrax is strongly suspected, the specimen is
sent to the next level or reference lab. Mor-
phology
of
the
bacterium,
growth
characteristics
on
sheep
blood
agar
and
haemolysis, catalase test and motility are
done
to
rule
out
anthrax.
If
all
the
characteristics are present, it is suspected to
be B. anthracis.
2. Reference
Labs:
These
public
health
laboratories can verify whether the organism

416
29
Bacillus
is B. anthracis. Once veriﬁed, it is sent to the
highest level national lab
3. National Labs: These are CDC or armed force
laboratories that carry on advanced testing of
the organism’s properties, including testing for
antibiotics.
Prevention and Control
These include chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics,
vaccination in humans and animals, and decon-
tamination of animal products.
Chemoprophylaxis
Chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics is indicated
for people who have been exposed to anthrax
but do not have symptoms of the disease. This is
useful to reduce the risk or progression of disease
due to inhaled anthrax spores. Ciproﬂoxacin,
tetracyclines including doxycycline, or penicillin
administered for 60 days is effective.
Vaccination in Humans
Humans
show
intermediate
susceptibility
to
B. anthracis. A non-cellular human anthrax vac-
cine called anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) is
available for individuals in high-risk occupations
such as veterinarians and animal handlers. The
vaccine is developed using the protective antigen
(PA) harvested from the B. anthracis culture ﬁl-
trate of an avirulent, non-encapsulated strain that
produces PA during their growth.
Pre-Exposure Immunisation
Pre-exposure
immunisation
for
anthrax
is
recommended
for
high-risk
individuals.
It
consists of three subcutaneous injections at
2 weeks apart followed by three more subcutane-
ous
injections
administered
at
6,
12
and
18 months. Annual booster injections for the
anthrax vaccine are necessarily required to retain
a protective level of immunity. The anthrax vac-
cine is recommended to use as part of the post-
exposure treatment of healthy individuals from
18 to 65 years of age who are at risk of exposure
to anthrax, along with antibiotics.
Vaccination in Animals
Control of anthrax in animals is essential to pre-
vent transmission of infection to humans. A
non-encapsulated toxigenic strain has been used
effectively for vaccination in livestock.
Pasteur’s anthrax vaccine was the ﬁrst vac-
cine invented by Louise Pasteur, which was an
active
immunisation
of
animals
to
prevent
anthrax.
Pasteur
vaccine
was
prepared
by
attenuating anthrax bacilli by growing them at
42–43 C. Sterne vaccine contains spores of a
non-encapsulated
avirulent
mutant
strain
of
B. anthracis. The mutant strain produces suble-
thal amounts of the toxin that induces the forma-
tion of protective antibodies. Maulucci vaccine is
prepared using stable attenuated Carbozoo strain
in 2% saponin. The animal is protected for a year
with a single injection of spore vaccine. It is
extensively used in animals; however, it is not
safe for human use, but in Russia, these vaccines
have been used for vaccination in humans.
The vaccination of animals has also been used
to protect people living in an area endemic for the
disease and protect persons dealing with animal
and animal products.
Decontamination of Animal Products
These include proper sterilisation of animal
products, such as wool, hides, and improvement
of personal hygiene. Animal carcasses suspected
of having died of anthrax are buried deep in burnt
lime (calcium oxide) or cremated to prevent soil
contamination.
Anthracoid Bacilli
Bacillus species resembling B. anthracis are col-
lectively called anthrocoid or pseudo anthrax
bacilli. These are opportunistic pathogens with
low virulence. They are ubiquitous organisms,
present virtually in all environments. Some of
them
are
frequent
laboratory
contaminants.
B. cereus is the most important pathogen causing
GI,
ocular
and
catheter-related
infections.
B. subtilis may act as an opportunistic pathogen,
causing eye infections and septicaemia. Bacillus

licheniformis has also been incriminated in
patients with food poisoning. Spores of Bacillus
stearothermophilus is used to test the efﬁciency
of sterilisation by autoclaves. Some Bacillus spe-
cies are used to produce antibiotics, such as
bacitracin, tyrothricin and polymyxin.
Bacillus cereus
417
Bacillus cereus
B. cereus is the most important pathogen known
to cause food poisoning. Episodes of B. cereus
food poisoning occur sporadically worldwide.
This occurs due to the ingestion of contaminated
food in which bacteria have multiplied to high
levels under conditions of improper storage after
cooking. B. cereus is widely distributed in nature,
such as soil, vegetables, milk, cereals, spices,
meat and poultry. Cereus is a spore-forming
Gram-positive bacillus. It resembles B. anthracis
but differs by certain features, as mentioned in
Table 29.3.
B. cereus produces many toxins and enzymes
responsible for many syndromes. The heat-labile
enterotoxin of B. cereus is similar to that pro-
duced by Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli.
The toxin stimulates the adenyl cyclase-cAMP
system causing profuse watery diarrhoea. Like
other enterotoxins, it causes accumulation of
ﬂuid in ligated rabbit ileal loop. The toxin causes
a diarrhoeal form of B. cereus food poisoning.
The heat-stable enterotoxin of B. cereus causes an
emetic form of B. cereus food poisoning, but the
exact mechanism of action of the toxin is not
known.

B. cereus also produces at least three other
toxins
(1)
cerolysin,
a
potent
haemolysin;
(2)
necrotic
toxin,
a
heat-labile
toxin
and
(3) phospholipase C, a potent lecithinase. They
have been implicated in causing ocular infections
such as panophthalmitis.
B. cereus causes two types of food poisoning:
Diarrheal and Emetic forms. Diarrheal form of
food poisoning is caused by B. cereus serotypes
2, 6, 8, 9, 10 or 12. It manifests as acute abdomi-
nal pain, diarrhoea and nausea; vomiting is rare.
The disease generally lasts for 24 h or more. The
faecal
samples
contain
small
numbers
of
B. cereus.
Emetic form of B. cereus food poisoning,
caused by heat-stable enterotoxin, results from
the consumption of contaminated rice. Most
bacilli are killed during the initial cooking of
rice, but heat-resistant spores survive. If the food
is kept at room temperature, the spores germinate
to vegetative forms, multiplying and producing
enterotoxins. Heat-resistant enterotoxins are not
killed on reheating the rice. On ingestion of the
rice, the toxin causes nausea, vomiting and
abdominal cramps after a short incubation period

of 6 h. Diarrhoea and fever are rare. B. cereus is
present in large numbers in the cooked rice and
the faecal samples of these patients. The disease
usually lasts for a shorter duration of 24 h or less.
The emetic form of food poisoning is caused by
B. cereus serotypes 1, 3 or 5.
418
29
Bacillus
Food poisoning is mild and self-limiting,
requiring no speciﬁc treatment. Other Bacillus
infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics.
It is resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins. It is
sensitive
to
gentamicin,
ciproﬂoxacin,
clindamycin and vancomycin. Food poisoning is
prevented by adequate cooking, avoiding recon-
tamination of cooked food and proper storage
(efﬁcient refrigeration).
Diagnosis of the food poisoning is by the
culture of the suspected food, faeces and vomitus
are cultured on ordinary media or a special media.
Spore-bearing Gram-positive bacilli may be seen
on a smear from the colonies. It is generally
motile, but non-motile strains may also occur. It
is a facultative anaerobe. Mannitol, egg yolk,
phenol red polymyxin agar (MYPA) is the selec-
tive media used to isolate B. cereus from faeces
and other sources.
Case Study
A group of 35 people in a village joined in a
community dinner. They consumed a mutton
preparation, among other dishes. Two days after
dinner, 20 of them fell sick with severe abdominal
pain and fever, followed by nausea, vomiting and
diarrhoea. Some patients had bloody diarrhoea.
All were admitted to a local hospital. History
revealed that the meat of a sheep, which died in
the morning, was cooked for dinner. Few other
sheep were also found to be dead. Veterinary
doctors examined the carcasses of the sheep and
diagnosed anthrax to be the cause of death of
these animals. The patients suspected to be
suffering from GI anthrax were treated with a
course of ciproﬂoxacin. All the patients recovered
fully.

Genus Mycobacterium and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
30
The genus Mycobacterium included in the family
Mycobacteriaceae consists of non-motile, non-
spore-forming and aerobic bacilli.
Genus Mycobacterium
They
are
slightly
curved
rods,
sometimes
showing ﬁlamentous and branching forms. In liq-
uid medium, they form mould-like pellicle;
hence, the name Mycobacterium is derived from
the
word
“mould”,
meaning
fungus-like
bacterium.
The cell wall is thick, complex and rich in
lipids, making the surface hydrophobic. The
lipid-rich cell wall also makes the bacteria resis-
tant to commonly used disinfectants and labora-
tory staining reagents. Due to their lipid-rich
waxy cell wall, mycobacteria are difﬁcult to
stain.
However,
once
stained,
they
resist
decolourisation with acid solution and alcohol.
They
are,
therefore,
called
acid-fast
bacilli
(AFB). Although they are Gram-positive, they
are difﬁcult to stain and they stain poorly with
Gram stain. Most mycobacteria are slow growers,
and the generation time is 2–24 h. These bacteria
require 3–8 weeks of incubation to produce
demonstrable colonies on the solid media.

Classification
The
genus
Mycobacterium
contains
194 recognised species, many of which cause
disease in humans. Mycobacterium species caus-
ing most human infections are summarised in
Table 30.1. Mycobacterium leprae was the ﬁrst
species of the genus Mycobacterium to be
identiﬁed by Hansen in 1874. Furthermore,
Robert Koch in 1882 isolated the mammalian
tubercle bacillus and established its role as a
causative agent of tuberculosis, as it satisﬁed all
the criteria of Koch postulates. Subsequently,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated
as the causative agent of tuberculosis.
The genus Mycobacterium can be broadly
categorised into three groups based on their abil-
ity to cause human infections: obligate parasites,
opportunistic pathogens and saprophytes.
Obligate Parasites
M. tuberculosis complex is the term used cur-
rently, including four species that can cause
tuberculosis in humans and other mammals.
These are: (1) M. tuberculosis, the human type;
(2) Mycobacterium bovis, bovine type; (3) Myco-
bacterium africanum, a species intermediates
between human and bovine types and causing
human tuberculosis mostly in tropical Africa and
(4)
Mycobacterium
microti,
another
species
which is pathogenic for goats and other small
animals but does not cause any human infection.

M. leprae causes leprosy in humans. Despite its
early discovery, very less is known about
biological requirements, and it has never been
cultured in vitro so far.

Opportunistic Pathogens
Non-tuberculous mycobacterium is isolated
from different types of sources. This species has
been isolated from cold- and warm-blooded
animals, skin ulcers and environmental sources,
such as soil and water.
Saprophytic Mycobacteria
These are the third group of mycobacterial spe-
cies isolated from different sources. This group
contains Mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium
smegmatis (present in smegma) and Mycobacte-
rium phlei (present in the grass). M. smegmatis is
a rapid grower and usually contaminates urine
cultures.
General Properties
Genus Mycobacterium is acid-fast. They contain
mycolic acid, consisting of 60–90 carbons that are
split to produce fatty acid methyl esters. They
contain a high guanine and cytosine content
(61–71%) in the DNA.
The cell wall of Mycobacterium is complex. It
is typical as that of Gram-positive bacteria. It
contains
a
unique
cytoplasmic
membrane,
surrounded by thick peptidoglycan and a layer
of highly antigenic mycolic acid. It is thick and
lipid-rich.
The
mycolic
acid
consists
of
peptidoglycolipids, glycolipids and lipids. The
outer layer consists of peptic chains and is an
important antigen of the bacteria which induces
cellular immunity in infected patients. A puriﬁed
protein derivative (PPD) of this layer is used as
a source of antigen in the skin test to demonstrate
the
hypersensitive
reaction
of
the
host
to
M. tuberculosis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
M. tuberculosis is the causative agent of tubercu-
losis—the number one infectious killer disease
worldwide.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
M. tuberculosis is straight or slightly curved rods
occurring singly, in pairs or small clumps. They
measure about 3  0.3 μm in size; sometimes,
long ﬁlamentous forms are also seen. M. bovis is
usually shorter and stouter than M. tuberculosis.
M. tuberculosis is acid-fast and alcohol fast;
it resists decolourisation by 20% sulphuric acid
and absolute alcohol. This acid-fast staining is the
most important property of the bacteria and is
used widely to identify the bacteria. Ziehl–
Neelsen (ZN)-staining procedure is used to dem-
onstrate
the
acid
fastness
of
the
bacteria.
M. tuberculosis stains bright red with this stain,
while the tissue cells and other organisms are
stained blue. These bacilli can also be stained by
Auramine O stain and examined under a ﬂuores-
cent microscope. They appear as bright ﬂuores-
cent rods against a dark background. Many
granules (Much granules) that are the non-acid-

fast form of tubercle bacilli present in the cold
abscess pus, which could produce the disease
when injected into susceptible animals. They are
Gram-positive but are difﬁcult to stain. They are
non-motile, non-sporing and non-capsulated.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
421

growth of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis: one medium

Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, while the
other medium showing no
growth
Culture and Biochemical Properties
M. tuberculosis is an obligate aerobe and charac-
teristically grows very slowly in media. The opti-
mum temperature is 37 C, and the bacteria do not
grow below 25 C or above 40 C. The optimum
pH is 6.4–7.0. It is a slow-growing bacillus with
an average generation time of 14–15 h. The
colonies usually appear in almost 2 weeks but
sometimes require incubation up to 8 weeks to
appear. M. tuberculosis can grow on a wide range
of enriched solid and liquid media.
The
examples
of
solid
media
are
(1) egg-containing media [Lowenstein–Jensen
(LJ)
medium,
Petragnani
and
Dorset
egg
medium]; (2) blood-containing media (Tarshis
medium),
serum-combining
media
(Loefﬂer
serum
slope)
or
(3)
potato-based
media
(Pawlowsky
medium).
On
these
media,
M. tuberculosis produces dry, rough, raised and
irregular colonies with a wrinkled surface. LJ
medium is the most widely used and is also
recommended by the International Union against
Tuberculosis. The medium consists of coagulated
whole egg, asparagines, malachite green, mineral
salt and glycerol or sodium pyruvate. Malachite
green inhibits the growth of bacteria other than
mycobacterium. The addition of 0.75% glycerol
enhances the growth of M. tuberculosis but is
inhibitory to the growth of M. bovis. After
6–8
weeks
of
incubation,
M.
tuberculosis
produces yellowish or buff-coloured colonies on
the LJ medium. They are tenacious and not easily
emulsiﬁed (Fig. 30.1). The identiﬁcation of tuber-
cle bacilli and other related mycobacterium is
described in the ﬂow chart (Fig. 30.2).
The commonly used liquid media include
Soloac
solutions,
Dubos
medium
and
Middlebrook
and
Beck
medium.
In
liquid
media, M. tuberculosis produces growth that
appears ﬁrst at the bottom and then grips up to
the sides and produces a surface pellicle that may
extend along the sides above the medium. The
bacteria in Dubos medium containing Tween
80 produce a diffuse growth. In glycerol broth,
they form a whitish-wrinkled pellicle on the sur-
face and a granular deposit at the bottom. Virulent
strains usually form long serpentine cords in liq-
uid media. In contrast, avirulent strains produce a
relatively dispersed growth in the medium. The
liquid media are not used for the routine culture of
the bacilli. They are usually used to prepare
mycobacterial antigens for vaccines and assess
the antibiotic sensitivity of M. tuberculosis.

M. tuberculosis is catalase-positive. They lose
their catalase activity when they become resistant
to isoniazid (INH). Catalase-negative strains of
M. tuberculosis are not virulent for guinea pigs.
It
is amidase-positive.
It produces amidase
enzymes,
such
as
nicotinamidase
and
pyrazinamide,
which
split
various
amide
substrates. M. tuberculosis is positive for the
nitrate reduction test. It produces the enzyme
nitrate reductase, thereby reducing nitrate to
nitrite. M. bovis and Mycobacterium avium lack
the enzyme nitroreductase and therefore are neg-
ative for nitrate reduction test. Tuberculosis, a
well as M. bovis, is neutral red-positive. They
bind neutral red in alkaline buffer solution. Niacin
production, nitrate reduction and production of
pyrazinamidases are useful tests to differentiate
M. tuberculosis from M. bovis (Table 30.2).
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Mycobacteria are killed by heating at 60 C for
15–20 min. The killing of the bacteria is depen-
dent on the nature of the clinical specimen in
which the bacteria are present. Mycobacteria in
the sputum may survive for 20–30 h, but in dried
sputum protected from the sunlight, they may
survive longer, up to 6 months. In droplet nuclei,
they may remain alive for 8–10 days. Bacteria are
killed when exposed to direct sunlight for 2 h but
remain
viable
at
room
temperature
for
6–8 months.
Tubercle bacilli are sensitive to formaldehyde
and glutaraldehyde. A tincture of iodine destroys
them in 5 min and 80% ethanol in 2–10 min. They
are
generally
more
resistant
to
chemical
disinfectants
than
other
non-spore-forming
bacilli. They can survive exposure to 5% phenol,
15% sulphuric acid, 3% nitric acid, 5% oxalic
acid and 4% sodium hydroxide. Tuberculosis is
susceptible to pyrazinamide, while M. bovis and
other mycobacteria are resistant. M. tuberculosis
is resistant to thiophen-2-carboxylic acid hydra-
zine (TCH), while M. bovis is susceptible.
Antigenic Structure
The cell wall of M. tuberculosis consists of four
layers:
(1)
peptidoglycan
layer,
(2) arabinogalactan layer, (3) mycolic acid layer
and (4) mycosides. The peptidoglycan layer is the
innermost
layer
covalently
linked
with
arabinogalactan (polysaccharide), and its terminal

ends are linked to mycolic acid. This layer is
overlaid with polypeptides and a layer of mycolic
acid consisting of free lipids, glycolipids and
peptidoglycolipids. The peptide chains in the
outer layer are important antigens that stimulate
cell-mediated
immunity
(CMI)
in
infected
humans. PPDs are extracted and partially puriﬁed
preparation of these proteins, which are used as
antigens in tuberculin skin test (TST). The
mycolic acid fraction of the lipids of the cell
wall is responsible for many of the characteristic
properties of the bacilli. These include (1) acid
fastness, (2) slow growth by delaying permeation
of nutrients, (3) resistance to commonly used
antibiotics,
(4)
resistance
to
detergents,
(5) unusual resistance to killing by acids and
alkalis and (6) clumping or cord formation.

M.
tuberculosis
strains
are
antigenically
homogenous. They are antigenically similar to
M. bovis and M. microti but are distinct from
other species. Mycobacteria possess two types
of antigens: cell wall insoluble polysaccharide
antigens
and
cytoplasmic
soluble
protein
antigens.
Group
speciﬁcity
is
due
to
polysaccharides present in the cell wall. These
include
arabinogalactans,
lipoarabinomannan,
lipids, glycolipids and peptidoglycolipids. The
cytoplasmic protein antigens confer type speciﬁc-
ity. These include antigen 5, antigen 6, antigen
14, antigen 19, antigen 33, antigen 38 and antigen
60. Mycobacteria protein (tuberculin) is responsi-
ble for developing delayed hypersensitivity in
humans
following
infection
by
peptidogly-
colipids. The human, bovine and murine bacilli
are antigenically similar. Tuberculin also shows
some antigenic relationship with that of atypical
mycobacterium.
Pathogenesis
M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a classic
mycobacterial disease in humans.
Virulence Factors
The capability of M. tuberculosis for intracellular
growth in alveolar macrophages is the main deter-
minant
of
the
virulence
of
the
bacteria.
M. tuberculosis does not produce any toxin.
Although cord factor and sulpholipids are
toxic substances produced by mycobacterium,
their role as virulence factors is doubtful. The
cord factor was so-called because of the false
belief that it is responsible for producing serpen-
tine cords typically found on the surface of the
liquid or solid media by M. tuberculosis. The cord
factor was originally thought to be a virulent
factor that no longer holds true. Sulpholipids
are
doubtful
virulence
factors.
They
are
associated with the virulence of tubercle bacilli

by preventing the fusion of phagosome and lyso-
some inside the macrophages, thereby allowing
the bacteria to multiply within the macrophages.
The main pathology in the infected tissue caused
by mycobacterial infection is primarily due to
responses of the host to M. tuberculosis infection
rather than any virulence factor produced by it.
424

Genus Mycobacterium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Pathogenesis of Tuberculosis
It depends on whether the tuberculosis is primary
or post-primary, depending on the time of infec-
tion and the type of host immune response.
Primary tuberculosis represents the initial
infection caused by M. tuberculosis in an infected
host. This condition is usually seen in young
children in endemic countries like India. On inha-
lation of the aerosolised bacteria, the bacilli reach
the lower respiratory tract. The majority of the
inhaled bacteria are killed by the natural defen-
sive mechanisms of the upper respiratory tract.
The
bacilli
that
survive
these
defensive
mechanisms reach the lungs and enter alveolar
macrophages. The phagocytosed bacilli inhibit
acidiﬁcation of the phagosomes and prevent
subsequent fusion of phagosome and lysosome.
This allows the bacterial multiplication freely
either in the phagosome or the cytoplasm. Multi-
plication inside the cells leads to the destruction
of the cells and the release of mycobacteria. This
is followed by further cycles of phagocytosis of
bacteria
by
macrophages,
multiplication
of
mycobacteria and lysis of macrophages.
Macrophages transport some bacilli to the hilar
lymph nodes. They are attracted to this site by the
presence of bacilli, cellular components and che-
motactic factors, such as complement C5a of the
serum. This leads to the formation of the focus
known as Ghon focus which is formed of multi-
nucleated giant cells known as Langerhans cells.
The Ghon focus is commonly found in the lower
lobe or in, the lower part of the upper lobe of the
lungs. This focus is also associated with the
enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes. Both
Ghon focus and enlarged lymph nodes constitute
the primary complex which usually develops in
3–8 weeks after infection by tubercle bacilli. This
primary complex is associated with the develop-
ment of tuberculin hypersensitivity. The lesion in
the majority of cases heals spontaneously within
2–6 months.
If few bacilli are present, the bacilli are
destroyed by macrophages with minimal tissue
damage. However, if many bacilli are present, it
leads to the development of tissue necrosis. Mul-
tiple host factors contribute to the process of
tissue necrosis. These include (1) local activation
of the complement, (2) exposure to macrophage-
derived hydrolytic enzymes, (3) cytokine toxicity
and (4) reactive oxygen intermediates. The bacilli
may be present as dormant in this stage or may
become re-activated in old age or the following
therapy or following immunosuppressive disease.
Reactivation of the site causes post-primary (sec-
ondary) tuberculosis.
Exogenous reinfection or reactivation of latent
infection
causes
post-primary
(secondary)
tuberculosis. Immunocompromised patients like
people infected with HIV patients who receive
transplants are more susceptible to reactivation
of the primary lesion. Secondary tuberculosis
differs
from
primary
tuberculosis
by
many
features. (1) Granulomas of secondary tuberculo-
sis occur more commonly in the upper lobes of
the lung. The lung lesions undergo caseous necro-
sis and tissue destruction, forming cavities in the
immunodeﬁcient hosts. The lesions disseminate
widely into lungs and other organs, such as
kidneys, bones, meninges. (2) Involvement of
lymph nodes is usual and (3) The cavities may
rupture into blood vessels, causing dissemination
of mycobacteria in the body, or these may rupture
into airways, releasing mycobacterium in aerosol
and sputum.
Extrapulmonary tuberculosis usually occurs
due to the spread of the bacilli through blood
circulation during the initial stage of multiplica-
tion at the site of primary infection, that is,
the lung.
Pathology
Tubercle is the key pathology in tuberculosis.
This is an avascular granulomatous condition. It
comprises a peripheral zone of lymphocytes and
ﬁbroblasts and a central zone consisting of giant
cells with or without caseation (Fig. 30.3). The
lesions are mainly of two types, exudative and

productive tubercular lesions. The exudative
tuberculous lesion is an acute inﬂammatory reac-
tion. This condition is associated with an increase
in the number of polymorphonuclear leucocytes
and subsequently with that of lymphocytes and
mononuclear cells and ﬂuid accumulation. This
lesion is seen more commonly in patients
(1) infected with more virulent bacilli, (2) with
an increased load of bacilli and (3) with increased
delayed-type
hypersensitivity
(DTH)
host
response. Productive tuberculosis lesion is pri-
marily cellular. It is associated with protective
immunity rather than the DTH response.

Immunity in Tuberculosis
M. tuberculosis infection in an infected host
induces cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The
CMI is manifested either as delayed tuberculin
hypersensitivity (DTH) or as resistance to infec-
tion. The course of infection is determined by the
interaction of hypersensitivity or host immunity.
Robert Koch ﬁrst described tuberculin hyper-
sensitivity reaction in experimentally infected
guinea pigs. The demonstration of this tuberculin
reactivity in guinea pigs is known as the Koch
phenomenon. Koch phenomenon is demonstrated
by subcutaneous injection of pure culture of viru-
lent tubercle bacilli in a normal guinea pig.
Initially,
no
immediate
visible
reaction
is
observed at the site of inoculation in the guinea
pigs. However, after 10–14 days, a hard nodule
appears at the site of inoculation, which soon
breaks down to form an ulcer that persists till
the animal dies of progressive tuberculosis. The
regional lymph nodes draining the region become
enlarged and caseous. In contrast, when a guinea
pig already inoculated 4–6 weeks earlier by tuber-
cle bacilli is injected with tubercle bacilli, an
individual lesion develops at the site of the second
inoculation within 24–48 h. In a day, the lesion
undergoes necrosis to produce a shallow ulcer
that heals rapidly, involving the regional lymph
nodes and other tissues.
The Koch phenomenon is a combination of
both hypersensitivity and immunity, which has
three components: (1) local reaction (induration
and necrosis), (2) a focal response (congestion
and even haemorrhage around tuberculous foci)
and (3) a systemic response (fever) which may
even be fatal.
The DTH can be induced by live attenuated
and killed bacilli, bacillary products and tubercu-
lar protein (tuberculin). Usually, live or killed
bacilli or tubercular proteins are employed to
demonstrate
hypersensitivity
reactions.
This
hypersensitivity reaction can be transferred pas-
sively by cells but not by serum.

426
30
Genus Mycobacterium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Tuberculin test (Mantoux test) is performed
to demonstrate delayed type IV or cell-mediated
hypersensitivity reaction to tubercle bacilli. Orig-
inally, the tuberculin test was performed using a
protein known as old tuberculin (OT) prepared by
Robert Koch. The OT is a protein component of
tubercle bacilli prepared from a 6–8-week culture
ﬁltrate of M. tuberculosis cultured in 5% glycerol,
concentrated ten-fold by evaporation on a steam
bath. The OT is a crude protein that consists of
protein as a constituent but varies from batch to
batch in its purity and potency. The OT has now
been replaced by using PPD of tubercle bacilli.
The development of antibodies in serum
characterises
humoral
immunity.
Antibodies
against polysaccharides, proteins and phosphate
antigens
of
tubercle
bacilli
have
been
demonstrated
in
serum
of
patients
with
tuberculosis.
Clinical Syndromes
M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis
The
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis
depend on the site of infection. However, primary
infection is usually pulmonary. M. tuberculosis
causes
pulmonary
tuberculosis
and
extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
Pulmonary Tuberculosis
The condition manifests as fever, weight loss and
productive cough. Other systematic manifestation
includes night sweats, anorexia and fatigue.
Bloody and purulent sputum may be seen. This
is associated with cavitary lesions in the lung.
Various forms in which pulmonary tuberculosis
may manifest are re-activated pulmonary disease,
progressive pulmonary disease and involvement
of
pleura.
Pulmonary
complications
include
relapse,
aspergillomas,
bronchiectasis,
broncholithiasis and ﬁbrothorax.
Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis
The condition varies depending on the site of
infection as follows:
Genitourinary tuberculosis is one of the most
common extrapulmonary manifestations of tuber-
culosis. The typical symptoms include dysuria,
increased frequency of urination and ﬂank pain.
The condition in men may manifest as epididymi-
tis or a growth in the scrotal area. In women, the
condition may manifest as a pelvic inﬂammatory
disease. Genitourinary tuberculosis is responsible
for approximately 10% of sterility in women.
The clinical manifestation of Gastrointestinal
tuberculosis depends on the site affected in the
gastrointestinal tract. For example, infection of
the stomach or duodenum manifests as abdominal
pain mimicking peptic ulcer disease, whereas
infection of the large intestine manifests as pain
in the abdomen, diarrhoea etc. Tubercular menin-
gitis is one of the most severe complications of
tuberculosis. The condition may persist as a head-
ache which is either intermittent or persistent.
Tubercular lymphadenitis or scrofula most com-
monly involves the neck along the sternoclei-
domastoid muscle. The condition is usually
unilateral, with little or no pain. Skeletal tubercu-
losis involving the spine is the most common site
involved in skeletal tuberculosis resulting in Pott
disease. Other conditions include miliary tubercu-
losis, tuberculosis of the skin and tuberculosis of
the middle ear and ocular structures.
Miliary disease, disseminated tuberculosis and
tubercular
meningitis
are
the
most
serious
complications of primary tuberculosis. Pleural
effusion and pneumothorax are the noted pulmo-
nary complications of tuberculosis. Intestinal per-
foration, obstruction and malabsorption are the
complications of tuberculosis of the small intes-
tine. Hydronephrosis and autonephrectomy are
renal complications, whereas paraplegia is the
complication of Pott disease of the spine.
HIV Patients with Tuberculosis
These are more likely to progress to disseminated
disease. These patients usually do not have a
cavitary
pulmonary
disease
or
upper
lobe
inﬁltrates in the lung. Patients with tuberculosis
should be tested for HIV, and those with HIV
need to be tested periodically for tuberculosis by
TST and chest radiography. HIV re-activates
latent tuberculosis infection, makes the disease

more serious and renders treatment ineffective.
On treatment with antiretroviral therapy, the
patients with both HIV and tuberculosis develop
various clinical manifestations, including fever,
lymphadenopathy, and non-invasive pulmonary
inﬁltrates. This has been suggested due to a stron-
ger immune response to M. tuberculosis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
427
Laboratory Diagnosis
Deﬁnitive diagnosis of tuberculosis is made by
detecting M. tuberculosis from clinical specimens
by microscopy or culture.
Specimens
Sputum is the specimen of choice for pulmonary
tuberculosis. Sputum, not saliva, is collected in
the morning into a clean wide-mouthed container,
such as a sputum cup. The collection of morning
sputum specimens is ideal. If sputum is scanty, a
24-h specimen may be collected. Sputum speci-
men collected on three consecutive days increases
the chance of detecting tubercle bacilli.
Gastric aspirate may be used in place of
sputum, especially in young children who cannot
produce the sputum. Propylene glycol in 10%
sodium chloride (aerosol) is used for stimulating
cough
in
elder
children
so
that
bronchial
secretions are collected. Bronchoalveolar lavage
is also used for the diagnosis of pulmonary
tuberculosis.
Urine is the specimen of choice for the
diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis. This is
collected either as three consecutive early morn-
ing samples or as a single sample of completely
voided urine in 24 h. The urine specimens are
collected in large, clean, sterile containers of
500 mL or more capacity and sent to the labora-
tory for processing. The urine specimens are
centrifuged at 300 rpm for 30 min, and the
sediments are used for culture on selective
media for M. tuberculosis.
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) is collected for
diagnosis of tubercular meningitis. The CSF is
centrifuged, and the sediment after centrifugation
is stained for smears and is inoculated on the
media for culture. On standing for a long time,
CSF develops a spider web, the examination of
which shows more bacilli.
Pleural ﬂuid, peritoneal ﬂuid and other
exudates are collected in containers with citrate
to prevent coagulation. Bone marrow and liver
tissue are usually collected from patients with
miliary tuberculosis, and blood is collected from
patients with HIV for isolation of bacteria by
culture.
It is essential to collect all these specimens
before starting antitubercular therapy and be
transported as soon as possible for staining and
culture. In case of delay, the specimens are
refrigerated at 4 C but not more than overnight.
Further delay in processing decreases the possi-
bility of isolation of tubercle bacilli by culture. In
general, few tubercle bacilli are present in
extrapulmonary specimens than in sputum.
The Concentration of Specimens
Concentration methods have been described for
the concentration of mycobacteria in sputum and
other specimens. The concentrated sediments are
used for microscopy, as well as for culture and
animal inoculation. Several methods are now
in use.
The Petroff method is simple and widely used.
In this method, an equal volume of sputum and
4% sodium hydroxide solution are mixed and
incubated at 37 C with frequent shaking till it
becomes clear, on an average of 20 min. It is then
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The superna-
tant is discarded, and the sediment is neutralised
by adding 8% hydrochloric acid. Phenol red is
used as an indicator. Other methods of concentra-
tion of specimens use dilute acids (6% sulphuric
acid, 5% oxalic acid or 3% hydrochloric acid) or
mucolytic agents (N-acetyl-L-cysteine along with
sodium
hydroxide
and
pancreatin,
desogen,
zephiran and cetrimide).
Microscopy
ZN staining of sputum microscopy is the most
dependable
and
conventional
method
for
demonstrating AFB by the ZN-staining method.
The sputum smears are made by using new slides


every time. The slides should not be re-used
because AFB may adhere to the surface of the
slide and may not be removed from the slide
during the process of cleaning.

smear of sputum specimen
showing pink coloured
acid-fast bacilli ( 1000)
In this method, the smears are made from the
thick purulent part of the sputum and then are
air-dried ﬁxed by heating. The carbolfuchsin is
poured over the smear and heated for 5–7 min. It
is then washed with water. Then the slide is
washed with 20% sulphuric acid to decolourise.
This is carried out till no more stain is to come off.
Then it is washed with 95% ethanol for 2 min.
After this washing, the slide is stained with
Loefﬂer methylene blue, 1% picric acid or 0.2%
malachite green for a minute. The stained smear is
examined under an oil immersion lens (100).
Acid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright
red
against
a
blue
background.
At
least
50,000–100,000 bacilli should be present per
millilitre of sputum in order to be examined,
taking about 10 min before giving a negative
report. The presence of at least two or more typi-
cal bacilli in the smear is reported as positive for
AFB (Fig. 30.4).

The smears are graded depending on the num-

on examination by oil immersion lens as per
Revised
National
Tuberculosis
Control
Programme (RNTCP) (Govt of India) guidelines.
Smear grading is useful (1) in a quantitative assess-
ment of the number of bacilli in the sputum
(Table 30.3); (2) to estimate the infectiousness of
the patient; (3) to monitor the effectiveness of
antimycobacterial therapy and (4) to determine
the discontinuation of respiratory isolation.
Microscopic demonstration of AFB in stained
smears is the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculo-
sis. This is because ZN staining of AFB smears
cannot be used to differentiate M. tuberculosis
from other acid-fast organisms, such as sapro-
phytic mycobacteria or Nocardia species. Sapro-
phytic mycobacteria may present an appearance

similar to that of M. tuberculosis. Nevertheless,
saprophytic mycobacteria stain uniformly with-
out any barred or beaded appearance and are
usually only acid-fast but not alcohol fast. More-
over, these saprophytic mycobacteria are usually
not present in the sputum and other respiratory
secretions but are found in urogenital specimens,
gastric aspirates and faecal specimens.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
429
Kinyoun modiﬁcation of acid-fast staining
is a method in which there is no heating of the
stain, and it is therefore called a cold method.
Here, instead of increasing the concentration of
phenol acid, increasing the duration of staining
is used.
Auramine–rhodamine staining is the ﬂuo-
rescent stain used as a variation of the traditional
ZN stain for demonstrating AFB. In this method,
the smears are stained with auramine–rhodamine
or auramine–phenol ﬂuorescent dyes and are
examined by ﬂuorescent microscope under ultra-
violet
illumination.
AFB
appears
as
bright
ﬂuorescing rods against a dark background.
Because of their contrast, the bacilli are visualised
even under a high-power objective compared to
the oil immersion objective in ZN stain, thus
enabling rapid screening of the larger areas of
the smear. The ﬂuorescent-stained slides can be
screened faster because the AFB stands out
against the non-ﬂuorescent background. This is
the major advantage of this staining method;
hence it is adopted in the laboratories where
many smears are to be examined for AFB. How-
ever,
it
is
always
essential
to
conﬁrm
ﬂuorochrome-positive smears by ZN staining.
Culture and Identification
Culture is the deﬁnitive method to detect and
identify M. tuberculosis. The culture is also a
more sensitive diagnostic method than smear
microscopy. The culture may be positive with as
few as 10–100 AFB per millimetre of a digested
concentrated specimen. Another advantage of
culture is that it helps identify speciﬁc species
and determine drug susceptibility patterns of
isolated strains.
LJ medium is an egg-based medium, and the
Middlebrook7H10 and 7H11 media are agar-
based media and these are conventionally used
for culture. Since M. tuberculosis is a slow-
growing organism, a period of 6–8 weeks is
required for colonies to appear on these conven-
tional culture media after incubation at 37 C.
Growth of most strains of M. tuberculosis may
appear during this period. However, cultures
should not be discarded as negative until they
have been observed for 12 weeks.
Luxuriant eugonic growth of white to buff-
coloured, rough, raised, irregular and tough
colonies on LJ medium after 4–6 weeks are
identiﬁed by smear, and a battery of biochemical
tests, and other tests. The colony smear shows
straight or slightly curved AFB by microscopy.
A catalase test is performed to detect the
enzyme catalase produced by various Mycobac-
terium species. This test is performed by mixing
equal volumes of 30% hydrogen peroxide and
10% Tween 80 in a test tube. Then a few colonies
of mycobacteria are picked up by a nichrome wire
loop and are inoculated in the ﬂuid. Formation of
air bubbles in the ﬂuid is observed within 1 min.
The demonstration of bubbles in the ﬂuid
indicates a positive test (Fig. 30.5). If the bubbles
appear in the ﬂuid immediately, it is considered
strongly positive, but it is considered weakly pos-
itive if they appear slowly. The absence of any
bubble
is
considered
a
negative
test.
M.
tuberculosis
and
M.
bovis
are
weakly
catalase-positive. The bacilli lose their catalase
activity when they develop resistance to INH.
Nitrate reduction test detects the presence of
enzyme
nitrate
reductase
produced
by
M. tuberculosis and other Mycobacterium spe-
cies. It is performed by adding colonies of the
mycobacteria to a buffered solution containing
nitrate and incubating at 37 C for 2 h. After
incubation, sulphanilamide and N-naphthyl-eth-
ylene diamine hydrochloride solution is added.
Development of pink or red colour within
30–60 s is suggestive of a positive test. M. tuber-
culosis and other mycobacterial species are nitrate
reductase test-positive, whereas M. bovis and
M. avium are negative.
Niacin test is performed by adding 1 mL of
sterile
normal
saline
to
colonies
of
M. tuberculosis in the LJ medium. The medium
is kept in a slanting position so that the colonies

of Mycobacterium are completely covered by
normal saline. After some time, 0.5 mL of the
ﬂuid is collected and is placed in a clean screw-
capped test tube. 0.5 mL of alcoholic aniline and
0.5 mL of 10% cyanogen bromide are added to
this ﬂuid. A yellow colour develops in the solu-
tion within a few minutes in a positive test. It is an
important test to identify niacin-positive human
strains of M. tuberculosis and differentiate them
from
niacin-negative
M.
bovis
strains.
M. tuberculosis is niacin test-positive; M. bovis,
negative.

Arylsulphatase test is performed by culturing
mycobacteria in a medium containing 0.001 M
tripotassium phenolphthalein disulphate. Myco-
bacterium
species
producing
the
enzyme
arylsulphatase split phenolphthalein free from
tripotassium
phenolphthalein
disulphate.
The
free phenolphthalein is detected by adding 2 N
sodium hydroxide to the culture. The develop-
ment
of
the
pink
colour
indicates
a
positive
reaction.
M.
tuberculosis
is
arylsulphatase-negative, while some other Myco-
bacterium species are arylsulphatase-positive.
Neutral red test is carried out to detect certain
strains of mycobacteria to bind neutral red in an
alkaline buffer solution. The development of pink
or red-stained colonies in the amber-coloured
ﬂuid suggests a positive test. M. tuberculosis
and M. bovis are neutral red test-positive.
Peroxidase test is positive for tubercle bacilli,
whereas atypical mycobacteria were found to be
negative peroxidase test. Similar to catalase activ-
ity, peroxidase activity of tubercle bacilli will be
lost on conferring INH resistance.
Amidase test detects the ability of certain
mycobacteria to split amides, such as, acetamide,
nicotinamide,
pyrazinamide,
carbamide
and
benzamide. The development of blue colour
indicates
a
positive
test
in
the
ﬂuid.
M. tuberculosis is amidase-positive.
Tween 80 hydrolysis is performed to demon-
strate the enzyme lipase produced by certain
mycobacterial species. Development of pink col-
our indicates a positive test. M. tuberculosis
shows a variable result. Mycobacterium kansasii
produces a positive test within 3–6 h, while other
mycobacteria species produce a positive test
within 3–10 days.
M. tuberculosis is pyrazinamidase test-posi-
tive. It is sensitive to 50 μg/mL pyrazinamide.
M. bovis is pyrazinamidase test-negative. The
enzyme pyrazinamidase hydrolyses pyrazinamide
to produce ammonia and pyrazonic acid in this

test. The pyrazonic acid can be detected upon the
addition of ferric ammonium sulphate.

Mycobacteria Drug Susceptibility Testing
With the emergence of multi-drug resistant
(MDR) mycobacteria, the determination of drug
susceptibility testing is important for starting
appropriate
treatment.
Phenotypic
and
genotyping methods can demonstrate drug sus-
ceptibility. Phenotypic methods include (1) resis-
tance ratio method, (2) absolute concentration
method, (3) proportion method and (4) radiomet-
ric
methods.
Genotypic
methods
include
(1)
DNA
sequencing,
(2)
solid-phase
hybridisation and iii) PCR–single-stranded com-
bination polymorphism analysis.
Tuberculin Skin Test
The tuberculin skin test is a widely used test for
the diagnosis of tuberculosis. It is used for
(1) evaluation of tuberculosis cases and for diag-
nosis of suspected M. tuberculosis cases, (2) diag-
nosis of active tuberculosis infection in infants
and young children, (3) the selection of a suscep-
tible population for Bacille Calmette–Guerin
(BCG) vaccination and (4) the prevalence mea-
surement
of
tuberculosis
infection
in
a
community.
Mantoux test is the recommended method to
perform a tuberculin skin test. The test is
performed by intradermal injection of 0.1 mL or
5 tuberculin units (TU) PPD into the volar aspect
of the forearm using a 27G needle. PPD must be
injected between the layers of the skin but not
subcutaneously. Development of induration of
10 mm or more at the injection site after
48–72 h is considered a positive test. Induration,
less than 5 mm, is negative, while between 6 and
9 mm is considered equivocal. Erythraemia is not
considered in the reading of the cutaneous. The
test is negative with the PPD of 5 TU, and then
the test may be repeated using a PPD of 10 or
100 TU. PPD of 1 TU is used when the recipient
is considered to be extremely hypersensitive to
the antigen. Multiple puncture tests include the
Heaf test and time test. Heaf test is performed by
using the hit gun and by using disposable prongs
carrying
dried
PPD.
These
tests
may
be
satisfactory for screening and surveys but are
not useful as diagnostic tests because they lack
sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
A positive skin test indicates hypersensitivity
of the individual to the tubercle protein. This
suggests
infection
with
M.
tuberculosis
or
immunisation by BCG vaccination in recent or
past with or without clinical disease. The test
becomes positive 4–6 weeks after infection or
immunisation. The tubercle test positivity gradu-
ally disappears within 4–5 years in the absence of
re-exposure to the tubercle bacilli. In endemic
areas, this positivity is maintained due to repeated
exposure to it. A negative tubercle test indicates
that the person has never come in contact with the
tubercle bacilli. Tuberculin skin test exhibits
false-positive reactions in patients with infection
by environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
False-negative reactions may occur in patients
with (1) BCG vaccination, (2) immunosuppres-
sive
therapy,
(3)
impaired
CMI,
(4) lymphoreticular malignancies, (5) immunode-
ﬁciency, (6) malnutrition and (7) miliary tubercu-
losis.
Improper
administration,
such
as
subcutaneous injection of PPD or injection of
too little volume of antigen, contamination of
PPD or improper storage, are the other factors
that may give rise to false-negative reactions.
Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)
The test for CMI is useful to detect latent Myco-
bacterium infection. It is an in vitro blood test of
cell-mediated
immune
response
where
it
measures the T-cell release of IFN-γ following
stimulation
by
antigens
speciﬁc
to
the
M. tuberculosis complex, i.e. early secreted anti-
genic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture ﬁltrate pro-
tein 10 (CFP-10). It has a speciﬁcity of >95% in
settings with a low TB incidence. It has less cross-
reactivity and so is not affected by BCG vaccina-
tion. Results are obtained within 24–48 h. Two
commercial IGRAs kits, i.e. the QuantiFERON-
TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) assay (Cellestis/Qiagen,
Carnegie, Australia) and the T-SPOT.TB assay
(Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, United King-
dom) has been approved by US FDA.

Serology
M. tuberculosis infection is associated with ele-
vated levels of antibodies in the serum. Various
mycobacterial antigens have been used in these
serological tests, including BCG, 5 and 6 kDa
proteins of M. tuberculosis, 32 and 64 kDa pro-
tein of M. bovis etc. Detection of antibodies by
serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA), is of limited value in
diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis. Latex agglu-
tination test using latex particles coated with rab-
bit antibody against M. tuberculosis has been
used to demonstrate antigen in the CSF for diag-
nosis of tuberculosis meningitis.
Animal Inoculation Tests
M. tuberculosis is highly pathogenic for guinea
pigs,
while
catalase-negative
INH-resistant
strains and most strains isolated from south
India are weakly pathogenic for guinea pigs.
M. tuberculosis is non-pathogenic for rabbits.
M. bovis is pathogenic for both rabbits and guinea
pigs. Inoculation in guinea pigs was earlier
widely used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
However, guinea pig inoculation is now regarded
as obsolete because it is cumbersome, costly and
less sensitive than culture. Guinea pig inoculation
is, however, superior to culture for isolation of
M. bovis from clinical samples.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other
nucleic acid ampliﬁcation methods are useful for
directly detecting M. tuberculosis in clinical
specimens, such as CSF. The AMPICLOR
M. tuberculosis direct test is an example of
nucleic acid ampliﬁcation tests. The AMPICLOR
test targets the insertion sequence IS6110 in the
DNA of the tubercle bacilli. The test’s sensitivity
varies from 40% to 60%, and speciﬁcity is 95% in
smear-positive cases of tuberculosis. The test is
also rapid. Disadvantages of the test include con-
tamination of clinical specimen by-products of
previous
ampliﬁcation
and
the
presence
of
inhibitors that may give rise to false-negative or
false-positive
reactions.
Nucleic
acid
hybridisation using DNA probes have been used
to identify the Mycobacterium species. These
commercially available probes help identify the
M. tuberculosis complex much earlier. The DNA
probes show a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 100%
when at least 100,000 tubercle bacilli are present.
This test uses chemiluminescent ester-labelled
single-stranded DNA probes. The chemilumines-
cence is determined by using a luminometer. A
positive
DNA
probe
test
indicates
the
mycobacteria to be M. tuberculosis, M. bovis or
M. africanum. The probe cannot differentiate
between these species. CBNATT (Cartridge
based Nucleic Acid Ampliﬁcation is also avail-
able for simultaneous detection of Mycobacte-
rium
tuberculosis
(MTB)
and
Rifampicin
resistance.
As a tool for detection, real-time PCR is the
most used, followed by conventional and digital
PCRs.
Many
commercial
systems
like
XpertMTB/RIF (Cepheid, United States) have
been endorsed by WHO to detect the MTB com-
plex and drug resistance screening. Likewise,
TruenatMTB,
TruenatMTB
Plus
and
TruenatMTB-Rif Dx have been developed by
Molbio Diagnostics, Goa, India. It is a chip-
based, micro real-time PCR-based assay for TB
detection that produce results in 1 h on the porta-
ble and is a more affordable alternative to Xpert.
Rapid and Automated Methods
The conventional methods are very slow, time-
consuming and require 6–8 weeks to isolate
M. tuberculosis. Hence, recently more rapid and
automated methods are being increasingly used to
diagnose tuberculosis. These recent methods
include automated radiometric culture methods
(e.g. BACTEC), SEPTICHEK, mycobacterial
growth indicator tubes (MGITs).
Automated radiometric culture methods,
such
as
BACTEC,
employ
a
liquid
Middlebrook7H12
medium
containing
radiometric palmitic acid labelled with radioac-
tive carbon-14 (14C). The medium also contains
several antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth
of other non-mycobacterial microbes. The test
result
is
noted
by
the
demonstration
of
radiolabelled 14CO2 produced during the growth
of mycobacteria. Growth of mycobacteria is

usually detected within 9–16 days. SEPTICHEK
is another rapid method for the isolation of
mycobacteria. This non-radiometric method is
based on a biphasic broth-based system that
decreases the mean recovery time versus conven-
tional methods. A new method employs MGITs
which show microbial growth and provide a
quantitative index of M. tuberculosis growth.
Round-bottom
tubes
with
oxygen-sensitive
sensors at the bottom are used in the test.

Treatment
Chemotherapy
by
antitubercular
drugs
has
revolutionised the treatment of tuberculosis.
Therapy with antituberculous drugs causes the
disappearance
of
caseous
or
granulomatous
lesions. Antituberculous drugs are classiﬁed as
ﬁrst-line and second-line drugs.
First-Line Antitubercular Drugs
These include rifampicin, INH, ethambutol, strep-
tomycin and pyrazinamide. All ﬁrst-line drugs,
except for ethambutol, are bactericidal. These
drugs have less toxicity and show greater efﬁcacy
than second-line drugs. Both INH and rifampicin
are effective against tubercle bacilli in necrotic
foci and intracellular mycobacteria. In contrast,
streptomycin, aminoglycosides and capreomycin
show poor intracellular penetration. A combina-
tion of four drugs (INH, rifampicin, pyrazinamide
and ethambutol) is given for 6–7 months for
treatment of smear-positive cases of tuberculosis.
These are given three times a week for the ﬁrst
2 months, followed by only two drugs (INH and
rifampicin) 3 times a week.
The emergence of natural drug resistance in
M. tuberculosis is a major problem in chemother-
apy of tuberculosis. This occurs by mutation with
a frequency of appropriately 106 cell divisions.
Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is deﬁned as
resistance to rifampicin and INH with or without
resistance to one or more other drugs. This is
because rifampicin and INH form the mainstay
of short-term chemotherapy and M. tuberculosis
strains resistant to both these drugs are unlikely to
respond to treatment. MDR is of two types—
primary and secondary. If the tuberculosis cases
are treated with a single antitubercular drug, the
sub-population of tubercle bacilli susceptible to
that drug is killed, whereas populations not sus-
ceptible to the drug continue to multiply. There-
fore, the use of multiple antitubercular agents in
treating tuberculosis is useful. The emergence of
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a
very serious problem and is deﬁned as resistance
to rifampicin and INH with or without resistance
to one or more other drugs. This is because rifam-
picin and INH form the mainstay of short-term
chemotherapy, and M. tuberculosis strains resis-
tant to both these drugs are unlikely to respond to
treatment. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is of
two types—primary and secondary.
Primary MDR is deﬁned as the development
of
resistance
to
antitubercular
treatment
in
individuals with no history of antitubercular treat-
ment. It usually occurs in a) patients residing in
areas with a high prevalence of drug-resistant
M. tuberculosis, b) those exposed to drug-
resistant contagious tuberculosis and c) those
with HIV infections and in the individuals using
intravenous drugs. Secondary MDR is deﬁned as
the emergence of antitubercular resistance during
infection and antitubercular treatment. It usually
develops in (1) patients treated within appropriate
drug
regimens
and
(2)
those
not
taking
antituberculous drugs regularly.
Second-Line Antitubercular Drugs
These are used for cases of tuberculosis where
ﬁrst-line drugs become ineffective. These include
many old and new drugs, such as ciproﬂoxacin,
cycloserine, ethionamide, kanamycin, oﬂoxacin,
levoﬂoxacin, capreomycin.
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
This is a method being recently followed for the
treatment of cases of tuberculosis. The DOT is
extremely useful for preventing drug resistance
by ensuring patient compliance. The DOT is
administered under the direct supervision of
healthcare workers of the patients one of the
family members.

Genus Mycobacterium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Epidemiology
Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one infectious
killer disease worldwide. It is most common in
Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern
Europe. According to WHO, more than 9.9 mil-
lion new tuberculosis cases occur every year, with
1.5 million deaths. In addition to disease burden,
it costs huge economic burden where income loss
equivalent on average to more than 50% of
income are documented.
Geographical Distribution
One-third of the world’s population is infected
with M. tuberculosis. Nearly two-thirds of all
tuberculosis cases occur in developing countries,
including India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Philippines, Nigeria, Indonesia and South Africa.
Habitat
M. tuberculosis primarily inhabits the respiratory
tract of the infected human host. The droplet
nuclei consisting of M. tuberculosis have been
found in the terminal air spaces of the lung.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
The source of M. tuberculosis infections is only
human beings. The degree of infection in infected
humans is very important as it decides whether
the disease would be transmissible. There are
about 100–10,000 bacilli in pulmonary lesions
with cavities. Cases with cavitary lesions have
more potential to be highly infectious. Infection
is less in cases treated with antitubercular therapy
when compared to cases that are not treated. The
decrease in infectiousness is primarily due to a
reduction in the bacillary load in the lungs.
Humans acquire M. tuberculosis infection
most frequently by inhalation of infectious
aerosolised droplets. These infective aerosolised
droplets are usually coughed or sneezed into the
environment by a patient suffering from pulmo-
nary tuberculosis. The acts of coughing, sneezing
and speaking release many droplets containing as
many as 3000 air-borne infectious droplet nuclei
per cough. The size of the droplet nucleus is 5 μm
or less. It contains about 1–10 tubercle bacilli. By
theory, even a single tubercle bacillus can cause
disease, but in reality, infection is caused by
inhaling around 5–200 bacilli. As these droplets
are small in size, they remain suspended in the air
for a very long time. The infection is acquired
rarely by inoculation. M. tuberculosis primarily
causes natural infections in humans. The bacteria
may also cause natural infection in mammals
such as other primates, dogs and animals that
come in close contact with infected humans. In
experimental infections, M. tuberculosis is highly
infectious for guinea pigs and hamsters but is
usually non-pathogenic for bovines, goats, cats
and rabbits.
M. bovis produces tuberculosis in cattle, as
well
as
in
humans
and
other
primates.
Aerosolised bacilli spread the infection amongst
animals in moist cough sprays. The infected
animals usually excrete the bacilli in their milk.
The infection is transmitted to humans by inges-
tion of raw milk of the cows infected with
M.
bovis.
Person-to-person
transmission
of
M. bovis usually does not occur. M. bovis is
more pathogenic for animals. Experimentally, it
is highly pathogenic for guinea pigs, calves and
rats and non-pathogenic for fowl.
African strains of M. africanum are the strains
of tubercle bacilli that are isolated mostly from
Africa. Asian type strains are of low virulence for
guinea pigs, susceptible to hydrogen peroxide,
resistant to INH and usually isolated from South
India. These Asian strains have also been isolated
from other Asian countries and Asians abroad.
Differential
features
of
various
strains
of
M. tuberculosis are summarised in Table 30.4.
Typing Methods
Various typing methods are very useful in an
epidemiological survey. Mainly, they can be
categorised into molecular and phenotypic typing
methods.
Molecular typing methods play an important
role in a molecular epidemiological survey.
Strains of the tubercle bacilli can be differentiated
easily by using DNA ﬁngerprinting technologies.
IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism
(IS6110RFLP typing) typing method is used for

A
I
A
distinguishing
between
isolates
of
M. tuberculosis. In this method, speciﬁc PCR
amplicons are digested with particular restriction
enzymes and run-on agarose gel to visualise dis-
tinct bands. It has been widely evaluated that the
discriminatory power of RFLP typing with
IS6110 is sufﬁciently high and can be used for
clinical
and
epidemiological
surveys.
The
spoligotyping (spacer oligotyping) method is
based on the polymorphism present on the direct
repeat locus, a highly conserved region present in
all MTB complex in a unique locus. This method
is very useful in the case of mycobacterial strains
bearing a low copy number of the IS6110 gene.

Phage type

Phenotypic typing methods were previously
used for epidemiological surveys; however, they
were side-lined because of their low discrimina-
tory power in distinguishing the Mycobacterial
species. Bacteriophage typing can classify tuber-
cle bacilli into four distinct phage types, Type A,
B, C and an intermediate phage-type I, which
exists between phage-type A and B. These
phage types have different distribution patterns
across the globe. Phage type A is cosmopolitan
in distribution, type B is restricted to the
European continent and Type C is sparsely
distributed. In India and other sub-continental
countries, type I is more prevalent. Bacteriophage
33D was ﬁrst isolated from an environmental
mycobacterial isolate, and it was found to be
lytic to all variants of M. tuberculosis, except for
the BCG strain. Bacteriocin typing can classify
Mycobacterium into two types. Because of this
low discriminatory power, this typing method is
not in use.
Prevention and Control
These include chemoprophylaxis, vaccination
and general health measures.
Chemoprophylaxis
Chemoprophylaxis or preventive chemotherapy
is carried out by using antitubercular drugs, such
as INH. INH is usually used for the treatment of
(1) persons with latent tuberculosis, (2) patients
with HIV infection, (3) recent contact of patients
with contagious tuberculosis in the past 3 months,
even if TST result is negative, (4) unvaccinated
children and (5) elderly person with radiological
evidence of quiescent disease. These cases are
treated by INH, given in a dose of 5 mg/kg daily
for 6–12 months. Results of the study have shown
that chemoprophylaxis by INH has considerably
reduced the risk of acquiring the disease nearly
by 90%.
Vaccination
Vaccination against tuberculosis is carried out by
the administration of the BCG vaccine. BCG is a
live
attenuated
vaccine
prepared
from
an
attenuated strain of M. bovis. This attenuated
strain was originally prepared by Calmette and
Guerin (1921). They sub-cultured the bacterium
every 3 weeks for 239 sub-cultures on potatoes
soaked in sterile bile containing 5% glycerol dur-
ing a period of 13 years. The BCG vaccine is
available in liquid and freeze-dried (lyophilised)
form. The lyophilised form is commonly used,
which is reconstituted with sterile physiological
saline to make a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mL
before administration. The reconstituted vaccine
has a shelf life of 3–6 h. The vaccine is given by
the administration of 0.1 mL of reconstituted

vaccine intradermally. In a positive test, a small
nodule
develops
at
the
site of
inoculation
2–3 weeks after injection. It increases slowly in
size, and by about 5 weeks, it attains a diameter of
4–8 mm. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow
ulcer which heals by scarring. Following BCG
vaccination, a tuberculin-negative individual is
converted into a positive reactor. The immunity
following BCG vaccination is similar and may
last for 10–15 years.
436
30
Genus Mycobacterium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
The vaccine is now being used in more than
100 countries and is given to infants, usually at
birth. The WHO recommends using the vaccine
in children who have asymptomatic HIV infec-
tion in areas where the risk of tuberculosis is high.
In earlier days, there were huge concerns
regarding the safety of the BCG vaccine. This
was mainly due to the Lubeck incidence, where
BCG vaccine containing virulent, live tubercle
bacilli were administered orally to children,
which
produced
severe,
fatal
tuberculosis
amongst immunised children. To avoid such
mistakes during BCG vaccine production, a strin-
gent safety policy has been laid down that helped
in a drastic reduction of such consequences that
may occur due to BCG vaccination. However,
BCG
vaccination
is
associated
with
complications. Local complications following
BCG vaccination include abscess, keloid, indo-
lent ulcer, tuberculides, lupoid lesions, lupus
vulgaris
or
conﬂuent
lesions.
Regional
complications include enlargement and suppura-
tion
of
draining
lymph
nodes.
General
complications that include fever is the most com-
mon apart from mediastinal adenitis, erythema
nodosum
and
formation
of
keloids
upon
wounding at other parts of the body. BCG vac-
cine is contraindicated in immunosuppressed
patients with (1) HIV infection, (2) primary or
secondary immunodeﬁciency and (3) in patients
receiving steroids.
Although BCG vaccination has been used
since 1921, and approximately 3 billion doses of
vaccines have been given, the vaccine’s efﬁcacy
continues to be controversial. Several ﬁeld trials
have been performed to assess the efﬁciency of
the vaccine. The results have varied widely from
80% protection to a total absence of protection.
However, two meta-analyses of the vaccine trials,
including those conducted in India, have shown
that the BCG vaccine is effective against miliary
and meningeal tuberculosis. BCG vaccination
offers many added advantages. It can also induce
the immune system non-speciﬁcally, conferring
partial immunity against diseases like leprosy and
leukaemia. Repeated BCG injections have been
used as adjunctive therapy in some kinds of
malignancies. Some research demonstrated that
BCG could be more useful than PPD for tubercu-
lin testing.
General Health Measures
General health measures include adequate nutri-
tion, good housing and health education.
RNTCP is a national tuberculosis control ini-
tiative program introduced in 1993 and launched
large scale in 1997 in India. Based on the WHO
recommended strategy, directly observed treat-
ment (DOTS), short course chemotherapy was
implemented for tuberculosis control in India.
The strategy’s main aim is to offer standardised,
cost-effective treatment and proper diagnostic
facilities. This strategy’s main aim is to reduce
drug resistance by ensuring the patient’s compli-
ance. Indian DOTS strategy is the fastest-growing
program globally, and treatments are given based
on three categories, I, II and III. The algorithms
used for diagnosis and treatment strategy have
been standardised, and it also recognises standard
and accredited laboratories for drug susceptibility
testing.
The primary drugs used for DOTS are INH,
rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and strep-
tomycin. Further, due to the emergence of drug-
resistant strains, the DOTS plus regimen is
recommended in selected areas and not for uni-
versal use. Based on the data obtained from a
recent survey, RNTCP has issued a daily regimen
instead of the existing alternative day regimen in
selected states, and it was found to be effective in
reducing relapse rates and drug resistance.
By adopting the WHO 2010 guidelines, the
RNTCP has recommended three standard treat-
ment regimens:

1.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
437
A new patient regimen containing 6 months of
rifampicin: 2HRZE/4HR.
2. Re-treatment regimen with the ﬁrst-line drugs
2HRZES/1HRZE/5HRE.
3. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) regimen.
The End TB Strategy of the World Health
Organisation
In 2014, World Health Assembly adopted the
WHO’s post-2015 End TB Strategy, an ambitious
blueprint to reduce TB incidence by 80%, TB
deaths by 90% and eliminate catastrophic costs
for TB-affected households by 2030. Being a part
of
newly
adopted
Sustainable
Development
Goals, the End TB strategy lays a roadmap to
provide a uniﬁed response to ending TB deaths,
disease and suffering by building on three strate-
gic pillars:
1. Pillar 1: Integrated, patient-centred TB care
and prevention. It focuses on early detection,
treatment and prevention for all TB patients by
ensuring equal, unhindered access to afford-
able services.
2. Pillar 2: Bold policies and supportive systems.
By intensifying participation across govern-
ment, communities and private stakeholders,
this pillar seeks to (1) strengthen health and
social sector policies and systems to prevent
and end TB; (2) support the implementation of
universal health coverage, social protection
and
strengthened
regulatory
frameworks;
(3) address the social determinants of TB and
tackle it.
3. Pillar 3: Intensiﬁed research and innovation
by adopting new tools and technologies in
operational research to design, implement
and scale innovations. It also calls for an
urgent boost in research investments so that
new tools are developed and made rapidly
available and widely accessible in the next
decade. It envisages the availability of better
diagnostics, including new point-of-care tests;
safer, easier and shorter treatment regimens;
safer and more effective treatment for latent
TB infection and effective pre-and post-expo-
sure vaccines.
Case Study
A 30-year-old male labourer working in a stone-
crushing unit attended Medicine OPD with a his-
tory of fever and cough with purulent sputum for
the past 3 months, associated with loss of weight
and loss of appetite and cough with expecto-
ration. Gram stain of sputum sample showed nor-
mal commensal ﬂora. White blood cell (WBC)
count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were
raised. Chest X-ray showed the presence of a
cavity in the left apical lobe of the lung.
ZN-stain smear of the sputum sample showed
the presence of AFB. Serum was positive for

Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium
lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis
Mycobacteria
31
Mycobacterium leprae is the causative agent of
leprosy, a chronic granulomatous disease primar-
ily affecting the skin and peripheral nervous sys-
tem. M. leprae was the ﬁrst bacterial pathogen
associated with a speciﬁc human disease and the
only mycobacterium known to cause infection of
the nervous tissue. The Koch postulates have
never been fulﬁlled for M. leprae because so far,
it has not been cultivated in vitro.
Mycobacterium leprae
M. leprae was discovered in 1873 by Arinuer
Hansen in Italy. Leprosy was not initially thought
to be an infectious disease, despite the discovery
of M. leprae. Tremendous advancement has been
made on the knowledge of pathogenesis, cause,
treatment and prevention of leprosy during the
last three decades. Nevertheless, the lesions
were responsible for the social stigma attached
to the disease.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
M. leprae is less acid-fast than Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Hence, 5% sulphuric acid, instead
of 20%, is used for decolourisation after staining
with carbol fuchsin. It is a straight or slightly
curved rod with parallel sides and rounded ends.
It measures 1–8 μm in length and 0.2–0.5 μm in
diameter, showing considerable morphological
variations. The bacteria exhibit cubical lateral or
even branching forms. It is Gram-positive and
stains
more
readily
than
M. tuberculosis. M. leprae is an obligate intracel-
lular bacterium that multiplies preferentially in
tissues
at
a
cooler
temperature.
They
are
non-motile and non-sporing.

M. leprae bacilli are seen singly and in groups
intracellularly and extracellularly lying free out-
side the cell. The bacilli inside the cell are usually
present in parallel bundles of 50 or more. Acid-
fast bacteria are bound together by a lipid-like
substance known as glia. These masses of bacte-
ria are known as globi. The parallel rows of bacilli
in the globi present a cigar bundle type of appear-
ance. These are present inside the large undiffer-
entiated
histiocytes,
which
have
a
foamy
appearance. These are known as Virchow lepra
cells or foamy cells.
The genomic sequence of M. leprae has been
mapped and completed recently. The genes
responsible for its major protein have been cloned
and sequenced. One important ﬁnding is that
M. leprae retains genes for the formation of the
mycobacterial cell wall. Like that of other
mycobacteria, the cell wall of M. leprae consists
of four layers. Peptidoglycan is the innermost
layer, which gives the bacteria rigidity and
shape. Lipoarabino mannose-B (LAM-B) is a
layer next to the peptidoglycan layer. Adense

palisade of characteristic long-chain fatty acid
known as mycolic acid is the third layer attached
to the LAM-B membrane. A layer composed of
mycosides is the outermost fourth layer of the cell
wall. Phenolic glycolipid (PGL)-1 is the major
component of the outermost layer of the cell wall.

Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria
Culture and Biochemical Properties
So far, M. leprae has not been cultivated in vitro
either in bacteriological media or in tissue culture.
Many attempts have been made to develop a
suitable
experimental
animal
model
for
M. leprae.
Footpads of mice were ﬁrst employed by
Shepard, in 1960, to culture leprae bacilli in the
footpads of mice kept at a low temperature of
20 C. Intradermal inoculation of lepra bacilli
into the footpads of mice results in granuloma
development at the inoculation site in 1–6 months.
The mouse footpad model has been used to test
(1) the maximum required concentration of
antileprosy drugs and (2) the sensitivity of the
bacilli to new antileprosy drugs.
Thymectomised mouse is an experimental
animal model in which cell-mediated immunity
(CMI) is suppressed by thymectomy on the
administration of anti-lymphocytic serum. In
such mice, inoculation of M. leprae produces a
generalised infection similar to that of leproma-
tous leprosy.
The
nine-banded
armadillo
(Dasypus
novemcinctus) is another animal highly suscepti-
ble to infection with M. leprae. In armadillos,
M. leprae causes a generalised infection with
extensive
multiplication
of
the
bacteria.
M. leprae in these animals produces a lesion
typical of lepromatous leprosy and survives for
about 400 days in infected armadillos. This ani-
mal is now being used as the most important
source of lepra bacilli for genetic studies, includ-
ing the development of the vaccine. Natural
infections by Mycobacterium organisms resem-
bling M. leprae have also been observed in
some wild armadillos held in captivity in Texas
and Mexico.
Other animals that have been used for exper-
imental infection by M. leprae include slender
loris, Indian pangolin and Korean chipmunks.
M. leprae shows the longest generation time
among all bacteria. It requires 12–13 days to
double in experimentally infected mice compared
to about 14 h in the case of M. tuberculosis and
about 20 min in the case of coliform bacilli.
Adaptation in Cell Culture Media
The ICRC (Indian Cancer Research Center)
bacillus is an example of an acid-fast bacillus
and was ﬁrst isolated from a leprosy patient
employing human foetal spinal ganglion cell cul-
ture. This bacillus was reported in 1962 from the
Indian Cancer Research Center, Mumbai and has
been adapted for growth on Lowenstein–Jensen
(LJ) medium. However, its relation to M. leprae is
uncertain, and many studies have suggested that
ICRC bacillus is not M. leprae but may be a
variant of Mycobacterium belonging to the Myco-
bacterium avium intracellular group.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
M. leprae remains viable in a warm, humid envi-
ronment for 9–16 days and moist soil for 46 days.
They also remain viable on exposure to ultravio-
let light for 30 min and direct sunlight for 2 h.
Antigenic Structure
M. leprae contains a wide variety of mycobacte-
rial antigens. LAM-B is a major antigen of
M. leprae. It is highly immunogenic and induces
a high level of serum antibodies. It is distinct from
the lipoarabino mannose of M. tuberculosis.
M. leprae consists of a large number of protein
antigens. The major protein antigens include
65-kDa proteins, 28-kDa protein and 18-kDa pro-
tein. The 65-kDa heat shock protein induces a
humoral antibody response in the initial phase of
M. leprae infection. The 28-kDa antigen protein
is the superoxide dismutase of M. leprae. The
protein stimulates a higher antibody response in
lepromatous leprosy than tuberculoid leprosy.
The 18-kDa protein is one of the most important
antigens which produces both humoral and cell-
mediated responses in a person.

Host Immunity
M. leprae infection induces the development of
antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunities
in the infected host. The CMI is the only protec-
tive mechanism against the disease. The progres-
sion of the disease is primarily dependent on the
CMI. The CMI is intact in tubercular leprosy,
whereas it is lacking or minimal in lepromatous
leprosy (Fig. 31.1). The infected persons with
tuberculoid leprosy show a strong delayed hyper-
sensitivity
reaction
to
lepromin.
The
macrophages phagocytose the bacilli and destroy
them.
Classification of Leprosy
Ridley and Jopling (1966) introduced a system of
classiﬁcation
of
leprosy
based
on
clinical,
histopathological and immunological ﬁndings.
This classiﬁcation is used to differentiate types
of leprosy and helps in determining the prognosis
following treatment with antileprosy therapy.
They classiﬁed leprosy into ﬁve groups: (1) tuber-
culoid (TT), (2) borderline tuberculoid (BT),
(3) borderline (BB), (4) borderline lepromatous
(BL) and (5) lepromatous (LL). Lepromatous
leprosy and tuberculoid leprosy are the two
extreme or polar forms of the disease.
In
contrast,
WHO
has
classiﬁed
as
paucibacillary leprosy (PB) and multibacillary
leprosy (MB), focusing on the purpose of treat-
ment. The classiﬁcation is based on the number of
skin lesions and the number of nerves involved.
PB is characterised by 1 to 5 lesions with an
asymmetrical shape and deﬁnite loss of sensation
having
one
nerve
involvement.
MB
is
characterised by more than ﬁve symmetrical
lesions and with or without loss of sensation but
involving more than two nerves.
Pathogenesis of Leprosy
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease
exclusively of humans.
Virulence Factors
M. leprae is an obligate intracellular acid-fast
bacillus with an afﬁnity towards macrophages
and Schwann cells. The virulence of M. leprae
is mainly due to its capabilities for intracellular
multiplication and growth and the host’s immune
system that inﬂuences the clinical form of the
disease.
Phenolic glycolipid-1 is the major antigen
component of the outermost layer of the cell
wall. This lipid is speciﬁc to M. leprae and is
the best-studied virulence factor of M. leprae.
PGL-1 binds to the C3 component of the comple-
ment, which leads to phagocytosis mediated by
complement receptors 1, 3 and 4 found on the cell
surfaces. PGL-1 protects the lepra bacillus, once
inside the phagocytic cells, from oxidative killing
by macrophages by removing hydroxyl radicals
and
superoxide
anions.
The
antigen
also
suppresses CMI and protects M. leprae from the
action of host cell enzymes.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also play an
important role in the pathogenesis of leprosy.
TLR-1 and TLR-2 are found on the surface of
Schwann cells, especially in patients with tuber-
culoid leprosy. M. leprae activates this receptor
on Schwann cells, activating apoptosis genes and
enhancing the onset of nerve damage seen in the
mild disease. Type 1 reversal reactions occur due
to a sudden increase in T-cell immunity. Type
2 reaction occurs due to activation of tumour
necrosis
factor-alpha
and the
deposition
of
immune complexes in tissues with neutrophilic
invasion. Thus M. leprae causes leprosy, a
chronic granulomatous disease.

Immunogenetics of Leprosy
Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II serolog-
ical typing has shown an association of tubercu-
loid leprosy with DR2 in the Indian population.
DRB1-1501 and -1502 are the predominant
subtypes of DR2 associated with lepromatous
leprosy. These two subtypes are implicated in
the
presentation
of
pathogenic
peptides
of
mycobacteria.
DQ1
presentation
has
been
suggested to be associated with an immunosup-
pression gene for M. leprae since lepromatous
leprosy and borderline leprosy has shown an
increased frequency of DQ1.
In tuberculoid leprosy, M. leprae peptides
probably bind selectively to HLA allele forms
(HLA-DR2) and other positively associated DR
antigens and stimulate T-cell clones that result in
a harmful immune response. Complete energy to
native heat shock proteins is characteristically
seen in lepromatous leprosy.
Clinical Syndromes
Leprosy
Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease pri-
marily affecting the skin, peripheral nervous sys-
tem and nasal mucosa but can affect any organ or
tissue. The clinical manifestations of leprosy
depend on the immune status of the host and the
spread of the bacilli. The incubation period varies
from 6 months to 40 years or longer. The mean
incubation period for tuberculoid leprosy is
4 years, and lepromatous leprosy is 10 years.
WHO classiﬁcation of leprosy based on clini-
cal manifestations and smear ﬁndings have clas-
siﬁed leprosy into multi-bacillary leprosy (MB)
(smear collected from any site positive for bacilli)
or paucibacillary leprosy (PB) (smear is nega-
tive for bacilli). Based on Madrid classiﬁcation
(1953), leprosy has been classiﬁed into four
groups:
(1)
lepromatous,
(2)
tuberculoid,
(3) dimorphous and (4) indeterminate. Lepro-
matous leprosy and tuberculoid leprosy are the
two extreme or polar forms of the disease.
Lepromatous Leprosy
The condition is seen in persons with low CMI.
The skin lesions are usually bilaterally symmetri-
cal and non-anaesthetic. These include macules,
nodules, plaques, or papules. These are extensive
and are most severe at the cooler parts of the
body. This form of the disease is associated with
disﬁgurative lesions. The skin of the face and
forehead becomes thickened and corrugated, giv-
ing rise to a typical leonine face. Bacilli in large
numbers are shed in oral and nasal secretions. The
lateral part of the eyebrows may be lost. Other
disﬁguring lesions include pendulous ear lobes,
hoarseness of voice, involvement of cornea
(Fig. 31.2), perforation of the nasal septum and
nasal collapse. Even in most advanced cases, the
destructive lesions in leprosy are limited to the
peripheral nerves, skin and upper respiratory
passages above the larynx, anterior chamber of
the eye, testis, hands and feet.

¼
Mycobacterium leprae
443
Lepromatous leprosy is known as multi-
bacillary leprosy because the lepra bacilli are
seen in large numbers inside or outside the cells.
The patients are highly infectious to others. The
lepromin test is negative due to low or nearly
absence CMI. In contrast, humoral immunity is
stronger
in
lepromatous
leprosy
and
is
characterised
by
strong
humoral
antibody
responses. High levels of antibodies are found in
the serum. Autoantibodies are also frequently
found. Tuberculin sensitivity may be negative or
suppressed in untreated lepromatous leprosy, but
it becomes positive after treatment.
Tuberculoid Leprosy
It is seen in patients with stronger CMI, a higher
degree of resistance. Skin lesions are few and
sharply demarcated. The macular anaesthetic
patches have raised, and the erythematous border
with a dry, scaly appearance in the centre with
complete anaesthesia. They are usually circular,
or serpiginous, and often hypopigmented. The
skin lesions are commonly found on the face,
limbs, buttocks or elsewhere. They, however,
are not found in the axilla, perineum, or scalp.
Bacilli are scanty or few in the lesions, hence are
of minimal infectivity to others. Neural involve-
ment is common in tuberculoid leprosy. The
ulnar, peroneal and greater auricular nerves are
involved, leading to tender, thickened nerves with
subsequent loss of function. Damage to the nerve
can result in wrist drop or foot drop.
Fig. 31.3 A case of
borderline tuberculous
leprosy, or dimorphous
leprosy. (Courtesy: https://
phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?
pid 19226)
Tuberculoid
leprosy
is
also
known
as
paucibacillary disease. It is characterised by a
positive lepromin test. The humoral antibody
response is weak; hence antibodies in the serum
are rare. Tuberculin sensitivity is positive, and the
prognosis is good.
Borderline or Dimorphous Leprosy
It is another form of leprosy, which exhibits
lesions characteristics of both tuberculoid and
lepromatous leprosy. Skin lesions are few, asym-
metric and have nearly complete anaesthesia
(Fig. 31.3). Peripheral nerves are thickened and
involved asymmetrically. This form of leprosy
can regress to the tuberculoid form, or it can
progress to a lepromatous form, depending on
chemotherapy or change in host immunity.
Indeterminate Leprosy
It is the most unstable form of leprosy. This form
is not characteristic of either lepromatous or
tuberculoid leprosy. In some cases, it may prog-
ress either to tuberculoid or lepromatous leprosy.
In some other cases, it may undergo spontaneous
healing.

Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria
Purely Neuritic Leprosy
It is an additional form of leprosy described
recently. It is characterised by asymptomatic
peripheral neuropathies without any skin lesions.
These cases are negative for the bacteria.
Lepra Reactions
The course of leprosy may be interspersed with
the reactional stage. These reactions, which are of
allergic nature and occur nearly in one-third of the
patients, are known as lepra reactions. These
reactions are considered a medical emergency,
requiring immediate treatment and management.
Lepra reactions are of the following types:
Lepra type I reaction is a type IV cell-
mediated allergic hypersensitivity. This reaction
is seen mostly in patients with borderline leprosy,
occurring spontaneously or more often during
chemotherapy. These reactions are characterised
by the development of skin erythema with
oedema and tenderness of peripheral nerves.
These reversal reactions usually suggest a shift
towards tuberculoid form after the start of chemo-
therapy. It is precipitated by puberty, pregnancy
and childbirth. This reaction usually occurs dur-
ing the ﬁrst 2 months of therapy to up to
12 months.
Lepra type II reactions are type III humoral
hypersensitivity reactions with a systemic inﬂam-
matory response due to deposition of immune
complexes. The appearance of crops of painful
erythematous
nodules
on
the
skin
and
subcutaneous tissue is the characteristic manifes-
tation. Other symptoms include fever, malaise,
arthralgia, neuralgia, iridocyclitis, arthritis and
proteinuria. This condition occurs in 20% of
patients with lepromatous leprosy and 10% of
patients with borderline leprosy. This reaction
occurs after a few years of therapy and relapse
intermittently over several years.

rosy are summarised in Table 31.1.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of leprosy is essentially clinical.
Laboratory diagnosis of leprosy is essentially
based on microscopy’s demonstration of acid-
fast M. leprae in the skin smears.
Specimens
In lepromatous leprosy, lepra bacilli are always
found in large numbers in the skin and the nose.
Therefore,
smears
collected
from
the
nasal
mucosa, skin lesions and ear lobules are the
specimens of choice for microscopy. Occasion-
ally, the specimens may be collected from lymph


nodes and affected nerves in lepromatous leprosy.
In tuberculoid leprosy, the bacilli are not found in
these specimens.
Mycobacterium leprae
445
Skin smears are collected from the leprous
lesions, such as nodules, thick papules and areas
of inﬁltration. In cases of patches, the samples are
obtained from the edge of the lesion rather than
from the centre. In patients with only diffuse
inﬁltrations, skin smears are collected from ﬁve
to six different sites, including the skin over the
ear lobes, buttocks, forehead, cheeks and chin.
The skin smears from these sites are collected
by the slit and scrape method. In this method,
the skin is pinched up and raised between the
thumb and index ﬁnger of the left hand, which
squeezes out blood from that part, thereby
minimising bleeding when a cut is made. Then
with the help of a scalpel, a cut about 5 mm is
made on the pinched skin, deep enough to get into
the inﬁltrated layers. After wiping of blood or
lymph that may have exudated, the blade of
the scalpel is turned at a right angle to the cut
and the sides and bottom of the cut are scraped
with the point of the blade several times in the
same direction so that the tissue ﬂuid and pulp but
not blood are collected on one side of the blade.
Obtained ﬂuid and tissues are thickly spread on a
slide
and
stained
by
Ziehl–Nielsen
(ZN) technique.
Fig. 31.4 Slit-skin smear
showing acid fast
Mycobacterium leprae
( 1000)
Nasal smears from the nasal lesions are col-
lected by scraping material from the mucous
membrane of the internal nasal septum, particu-
larly from inferior turbinate folds of the nasal
septum. This mucous membrane is then spread
on a slide, and a uniform smear is made, which is
stained by the ZN method, as mentioned earlier.
Microscopy
The slit-skin smears, nasal smears, or smears
from other specimens are stained using the ZN
method and decolourised with 5% instead of 20%
sulphuric acid. In a positive, stained smear,
red-coloured acid-fast bacilli are seen on exami-
nation by oil immersion lens (Fig. 31.4). The
smears are graded based on the numbers of
bacilli, as mentioned in Table 31.2.
Bacillary index and morphological index are
two indices based on the demonstration of
M. leprae in smears from skin or nasal discharges.
These two indices are useful for (1) demonstrating
the viability of organisms, (2) assessing the
amount of infection and (3) assessing patients’
progress after treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents.

Bacillary index (BI) is an expression of the
extent of bacterial load. It is calculated by
counting six to eight stained smears under the
100 oil immersion lens. This index is obtained
by totalling the number of plusses (plus scored in
all the smears and divided by the number of the
smears). For this index, a minimum of four skin
lesions, a nasal swab and both ear lobes are
examined. The bacillary index can be affected
by the thickness of the ﬁlm, depth of the skin
incision and thoroughness of the scrap.
Morphological index (MI) uses the unifor-
mity of the bacilli as a criterion to differentiate
live bacilli from dead bacilli in the stained smears.
It is calculated by counting solid stained bacilli
out of the total number of bacilli counted. The
lepra bacilli that stain uniformly with carbol fuch-
sin as solid acid-fast rods are believed to be via-
ble.
The
bacilli
that
stain
irregularly
are
considered dead and degenerated. The percentage
of uniformly stained bacilli in the tissues is
known as the morphological index (MI). This
index is useful for assessing the response of
patients with leprosy to antileprosy agents and is
more useful than the bacteriological index (BI). A
decrease in MI indicates a better response of the
patients to chemotherapy. In contrast, a decrease
in MI followed by an increased MI indicates a
poor response to chemotherapeutic agents.
Other methods that are also used to detect
viable
lepra
bacilli
include
(1)
ﬂuorescent
diacetate-ethidium bromide (FDA–EB) staining,
(2) laser microscope mass analysis (LAMMA),
bioluminescent technology and (3) macrophage-
based assays.
Nasal smears are positive in lepromatous and
borderline leprosy but are negative in tuberculoid
leprosy, mid-borderline leprosy and borderline
tuberculoid leprosy. Examination of nasal smears
is useful to know whether a leprosy patient is
infectious or not. The lepra bacilli usually disap-
pear more rapidly from the nose than from the
skin lesions following chemotherapy.
Biopsy
Skin biopsy is useful for the diagnosis and proper
classiﬁcation of leprosy. The samples are usually
obtained from the edge of the lesion; a biopsy
smear or scalpel may be used for the purpose.
Nerve biopsy is a very useful method in the
diagnosis of leprosy. This is useful to differentiate
the lepromatous cause of thickened nerves from
other non-lepromatous causes of thickened nerves
in people living in the disease’s endemic areas.
This is also useful to rule out other diseases, such
as
polyradiculoneuropathy,
hereditary
neuropathies,
or
polyarteritis
nodosa.
Nerve
biopsy is the only method to conﬁrm the diagno-
sis in cases of leprosy with pure neuropathic
forms.
Lepromin Test
The lepromin test is used to study host immunity
to M. leprae and was ﬁrst described by Mitsuda in
1919. It is an intradermal skin test performed
using lepromin antigen, a suspension of killed
M. leprae obtained from infected human or arma-
dillo tissue.
Antigen
Originally, crude antigen obtained from human
lepromatous tissue rich in M. leprae was used as
antigen. Mitsuda ﬁrst prepared this antigen in
1919 by using antigens extracted from skin

lesions of lepromatous patients. This antigen,
known as standard Mitsuda lepromin, contains
4.0  107 M. leprae per mL, The antigen has a
shelf life of 2 years when stored at 4 C. The
standard lepromin antigen has been recently
prepared from armadillo-derived lepra bacilli
(Lepromin A) by replacing human-derived lepra
bacilli (Lepromin H).
Mycobacterium leprae
447
Dharmender
antigen
is
an
example
of
Bacillary lepromin type of antigen. This contains
more bacillary components and fewer tissue
components. Indian scientist Dharmender ﬁrst
prepared this antigen by separating the bacilli
from
ﬁnely
ground
lepromatous
tissue
and
treating it with chloroform. The suspension is
then evaporated to make it dry and then washed
with ether to remove the lipids. The antigen,
ﬁnally, is reconstituted in phenol saline for use.
Test
Lepromin skin test is performed by intradermal
injection of lepromin antigen into the forearm.
Two types of reactions are observed after the
test. First, early or Fernandez reaction and sec-
ond, late or Mitsuda reaction.

reaction in the form of a
papule (https://www.
researchgate.net/ﬁgure/
Erythematous-lesion-in-
the-dorsal-region_ﬁg1_
259368237)
Early or Fernandez reaction is observed
after 48 h of injection. A positive reaction is
characterised by the appearance of a localised
area of inﬂammation with congestion and oedema
measuring 10 mm and more in diameter during
24–48 h of injection. These lesions disappear
within 3–4 days. The positive Fernandez reaction,
like tuberculin reaction, indicates a delayed type
of hypersensitivity to antigens of M. leprae or
mycobacteria that cross-react with M. leprae.
The positive reaction suggests that the patient
has been infected by leprae bacilli sometime in
the
past.
Late
or
Mitsuda
reaction
is
characterised by the development of a nodule at
the inoculation site after 3–4 weeks of injection
(Fig.
31.5).
The
nodule
subsequently
may
undergo necrosis followed by ulceration. The
ulcer takes several weeks to heal. Positive
Mitsuda reaction indicates that the immune sys-
tem
can
induce
an
efﬁcient
cell-mediated
response. Mitsuda reaction is positive in tubercu-
loid leprosy.
The lepromin test is used mainly to determine
the type of leprosy. A positive test suggests resis-
tance to disease in tuberculoid leprosy. A

negative test suggests a lack of resistance to the
disease in lepromatous leprosy patients. It is also
used to monitor the response of leprosy patients to
treatment with chemotherapy. A positive reaction
indicates a good prognosis, while a negative test
suggests a very bad prognosis. It is used to assess
host resistance to leprosy.
448
31
Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria
The lepromin test is not used to conﬁrm the
diagnosis of leprosy. It is also not useful to indi-
cate prior contact with the person with leprae
bacilli.
Healthy
people
residing
in
areas
non-endemic for leprosy with no chance of con-
tact with the bacilli may show a positive lepromin
reaction.
Serology
Serodiagnosis
of
leprosy
is
based
on
demonstrating antibodies to M. leprae, speciﬁc
PGL-1 antigens. ELISA and latex agglutination
tests are used to detect serum antibodies. The
serology is useful primarily in patients with
untreated lepromatous leprosy, as most (90%) of
patients have higher levels of serum antibodies.
The
serology,
however,
is
less
useful
for
diagnosing paucibacillary disease because serum
antibodies are present in only 40–60% of such
patients.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used for
identifying
DNA
that
encodes
65-
and
18-kDa
M.
leprae
proteins
and
repetitive
sequences of M. leprae. It is used to monitor
treatment, diagnose relapses, or determine the
need for chemotherapy. It is most useful in cases
of
leprosy
showing
atypical
clinical
or
histopathological features but positive for acid-
fast bacilli. It is not useful for diagnosing cases
when acid-fast bacilli are not detected by light
microscopy.
Evidence indicates that PCR is the most pre-
ferred choice in difﬁcult-to-diagnose cases. It
results from incorrect diagnosis and results in
early identiﬁcation. It could facilitate the identiﬁ-
cation of clinical manifestations like pure neural
leprosy
(PNL)
and
atypical
skin
clinical
presentations. Results obtained are 100% speciﬁc,
while the sensitivity is greater than 90% in
patients.
Treatment
The management of leprosy depends on treatment
by chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapy
followed by physical, social and psychological
rehabilitation.
Chemotherapy
The goals of chemotherapy against leprosy are to
(1) stop infection, (2) reduce morbidity, (3) pre-
vent complications and (4) eradicate the disease.
Dapsone was the ﬁrst effective chemotherapeutic
agent used against leprosy. Earlier it was used as a
monotherapy, but it resulted in the development
of resistance against the drug by lepra bacilli.
Hence since 1981, the WHO has advocated mul-
tiple drug therapy (MDT) against leprosy, like
tuberculosis.
Multiple drug therapy (MDT) against lep-
rosy quickly decreases the contagiousness of the
disease, reduces relapse, reduces reactions and
reduces disabilities. Moreover, MDT prevents
dapsone resistance. The duration of treatment
varies
from
6
months
to
2
years.
The
recommendations of WHO for treatment of lep-
rosy in adults are as follows:
1. Single skin lesion: A single dose of the drug,
which includes rifampicin 600 mg, oﬂoxacin
400 mg and minocycline 100 mg.
2. Paucibacillary disease: Dapsone 100 mg daily
and rifampicin 600 mg once a month was
given for 6 months.
3. Multibacillary disease: Rifampin (rifampicin)
600 mg once a month, dapsone 100 mg daily,
clofazimine 300 mg once a month and 50 mg
daily are given for 1 year.
A minimum of 2 years of follow-up for
paucibacillary and 8 years for multibacillary
cases is required to detect any relapse. The treat-
ment schedule for children consists of dapsone
(2 mg/kg) daily, clofazimine (6 mg/kg) once a
month under the supervision and 1 mg/kg daily

self-administered and rifampin (10 mg/kg) once a
month.
Mycobacterium leprae
449
Reactions during treatment with MDT are a
major problem. These reactions need urgent treat-
ment, failing which they can give rise to irrevers-
ible deformities. Early diagnosis and timely
initiation
of
anti-inﬂammatory
measures
are
important. MDT is not stopped during reactions
and
is
continued
at
full
doses
without
interruption.
Immunotherapy
Many
immunotherapy
agents
have
been
evaluated for the treatment of leprosy. These
include immunomodulatory drugs, transfer fac-
tor, acetoacetylated M. leprae and delipidiﬁed
cell components of M. leprae. These agents
have been shown to enhance CMI, which results
in increased killing and rapid clearing of dead
lepra bacilli. Immunotherapy in combination
with chemotherapy has shown to be more beneﬁ-
cial, better tolerated by patients and is not
associated with increased lepra reactions.
Epidemiology
Leprosy is a disease prevalent worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
The worldwide prevalence of leprosy is <1 case/
10,000 population. Most cases of leprosy are
found
in
Southeast
Asia,
Africa
and
the
Americas. Fifteen endemic countries in these
areas have a prevalence of >1 case/10,000
populations. More than 120,000 new cases were
reported globally in 2020. Among the new cases,
7198 new cases were detected with grade2
disabilities (G2D). However, the number suffered
from the impact of COVID-19 that affected
programme implementation resulting in a reduc-
tion in new case detection by 37% in 2020 com-
pared with 2019.
Habitat
In an infected host, M. leprae is found in large
numbers in infected nasal secretions of patients
with lepromatous leprosy.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Leprosy
is
an
exclusively
human
disease.
Humans are the prime reservoir of M. leprae.
Nine-banded armadillo, chimpanzee and manga-
bey monkeys are the three animal species known
to be important animal reservoirs of leprosy. Lep-
rosy is not a highly infectious disease. Leproma-
tous forms of the disease, but not the tuberculoid
form, is infectious.
Leprosy is primarily transmitted by infected
nasal secretions. Infections by a very large num-
ber of lepra bacilli lead to lepromatous leprosy.
Nasal secretions from patients with lepromatous
leprosy are an important source of infection. Very
large numbers of lepra bacilli are shed in the nasal
secretions. As high as 8  108 bacilli can be
discharged during a single nose blow of the
patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy.
Inhalation of infectious aerosol and skin con-
tact
with
respiratory
secretions
or
wound
exudates are the most important routes of infec-
tion in leprosy. The following observations sup-
port the transmission of infection through the
respiratory route: (1) a large number of morpho-
logically intact lepra bacilli are demonstrated in
the nasal discharges, (2) the organisms have not
been detected on the surface of the skin, (3) lepra
bacilli survive for several hours or days outside
the human host and (4) experimental transmission
of
leprosy
has
been
achieved
by
aerosols
containing M. leprae and by topical application
in immunosuppressed mice. Leprosy is usually
not spread by means of direct contact through
intact skin, though close contacts are more
susceptible.
Prevention and Control
The preventive and control measures include:
(1) early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy and
surveillance of contacts, (2) health education,
(3) vaccines and (4) chemoprophylaxis.
Attempts have been made to develop and eval-
uate vaccines against leprosy. The antileprosy
vaccines can be used as both immunoprophylactic

and therapeutic agents. The vaccines that have
been evaluated currently include the M. avium-
intracellular complex (Mycobacterium ICRC)
vaccine, intracellular–Guerin (BCG) vaccine,
Mycobacterium w vaccine; BCG plus heat-killed
M. leprae, Mycobacterium tufu and Mycobacte-
rium habana vaccine. BCG vaccine has shown
variable results in conferring protection against
certain
populations.
However,
repeat
immunisation with BCG has been shown to con-
fer further protection. Both Mycobacterium w and
Mycobacterium ICRC vaccines are used in India.
Mycobacterium ICRC vaccine was prepared in
1979 and contained gamma-radiation-inactivated
ICRC bacilli. Uses of these vaccines—both in
mouse models and human studies—have shown
better results.

Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria
Many studies using one or more antileprosy
drugs (dapsone, acedapsone and rifampicin) as
chemoprophylaxis have failed to show any sig-
niﬁcant protection against leprosy.
WHO Roadmap on Leprosy
In 2018, WHO had developed “WHO guidelines
for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
leprosy 2018”. It recommended three drugs,
namely rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine, to
both paucibacillary and multibacillary types of
leprosy.
Recently in April 2021, WHO has released
“Towards
Zero
Leprosy
–
Global
Leprosy
(Hansen’s disease) Strategy 2021–-2030”. With
a goal to eliminate leprosy by achieving zeros in
cases, infection, transmission, disability, stigma
and discrimination, the strategy aims for a 70%
reduction in the annual number of new cases,
90% reduction in rate per million population of
new cases with grade-2 disability (G2D) and 90%
reduction in rate per million children of new child
cases with leprosy.
To operationalise the strategy, four pillars
have been implemented:
1. Implement integrated, country-owned zero
leprosy roadmaps in all endemic countries.
2. Scale-up
leprosy
prevention
alongside
integrated active case detection.
3. Manage leprosy and its complications and pre-
vent new disability.
4. Combat stigma and ensure human rights are
respected.
Mycobacterium lepraemurium
M.
lepraemurium
was
ﬁrst
described
by
Stefansky as the causative agent of leprosy in
rats in 1901 at Odessa. The rat leprosy was
found in 4–5% of slaughtered rats investigated
during an attack of human plague. The condition,
subsequently, has been documented with variable
incidence from different countries of the world.
M. lepraemurium resembles M. leprae and is
found in the mononuclear cells of the subcutane-
ous tissues, lymph nodes and the nodules in the
lungs and liver of the infected rat. However, both
M. lepraemurium and M. leprae are not related
species, and they differ from each other, as shown
by DNA studies. M. lepraemurium is cultivated
with difﬁculty in Ogawa egg-yolk medium
(pH 5.8–6.3) at 37 C and also in rat ﬁbroblasts
cell lines. Lepraemurium in rats causes rat lep-
rosy, which is characterised by two forms: glan-
dular
form
and
musculocutaneous
form.
Enlarged, hard and whitish inguinal, axillary and
cervical lymph nodes are found in the glandular
type and ulceration and loss of hair are found in
the musculocutaneous type. The bacteria do not
cause disease in humans.
Case Study
A 25-year-old male attended Dermatology OPD
and complained of hypopigmented patches on
limbs and a few on the buttocks. On examination,
the ulnar nerve was found to be tender and thick-
ened. Skin biopsy and nasal secretion were nega-
tive for acid-fast bacilli. The lepromin test was
positive. The condition was diagnosed as leprosy.

Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM)
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are the
mycobacteria other than the tubercle and lepra
bacilli. These are also known as mycobacteria
other than tubercle bacilli (MOTT). These bacte-
ria, which normally occur as saprophytes of soil
and water, may occasionally cause opportunistic
infections in humans that resemble tuberculosis.
These bacteria, therefore, were also earlier known
as
atypical,
environmental
or
opportunistic
mycobacteria.
NTM or atypical mycobacteria show the fol-
lowing features: (1) They can grow at 25, 37 C
and even at 44 C. (2) Some of them are rapid
growers.
They
produce
colonies
within
1–2 weeks of incubation in Lowenstein–Jensen
(LJ) medium. (3) Some of them may produce
bright yellow or orange pigments during their
growth on the LJ medium. (4) They are acid-fast
as well as alcohol fast. They may differ from or
may resemble the tubercle bacilli. (5) They are
arylsulphatase test positive but are niacin and
neutral red test negative. (6) They are usually
resistant to antitubercular drugs, such as strepto-
mycin, isoniazid (INH) and p-aminosalicylic acid
and (7) They are non-pathogenic for guinea pigs
but pathogenic for the mouse.

NTM have been classiﬁed as rapid growers
and slow growers. Mycobacterium fortuitum,
Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium
abscessus are examples of more rapidly growing
Mycobacterium species, which require incubation
for 3 days or more to develop the colonies.
M. avium-intracellulare complex and Mycobac-
terium kansasii are the slow-growing Mycobacte-
rium species that require 3–8 weeks of incubation
for their growth.
Most
human
infections
are
caused
by
M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. M. avium com-
plex, M. kansasii, M. abscessus, M. chelonae and
M. fortuitum are examples of MOTT associated
with frequent human infections (Table 31.3).
Runyon Classification

saprophytic

rate and their ability to produce pigments in the
presence or absence of light. This classiﬁcation
system is known as Runyon classiﬁcation
(Table 31.4).
Photochromogens (Runyon Group I)
These includes mycobacteria, which produce pig-
ment on exposure to light(photochromogens).

exposed to light for 1 h in the presence of air and
is re-incubated for 24–48 h. These bacteria pro-
duce
yellow-orange
pigments
during
such
conditions. They do not produce any pigments
in the colonies that are incubated in the dark.
These mycobacteria are slow-growing but grow
faster (after 7 days) than the tubercle bacilli. The
most common species are M. kansasii, Mycobac-
terium marinum and Mycobacterium simiae.
Some of these mycobacteria produce diseases
similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. Most of these
mycobacteria have been isolated from water and
soil in the environment.

M. kansasii reduces nitrates to nitrites and
shows a positive Tween 80 hydrolysis test within
3–6 h, whereas other mycobacteria species pro-
duce positive test within 3–10 days. M. kansasii
causes a disease identical to pulmonary tubercu-
losis, which is associated with the formation of a
cavity and scarring, usually in the upper lobe of
the lungs. This species is the second most com-
mon NTM, next to the M. avium complex, as a
causative agent of lung diseases. These strains
have been frequently isolated from tap water,
and infected tap water is believed to be the
major source of infection. M. kansasii grows rap-
idly on LJ medium, producing visible colonies
within 2 weeks. It is sensitive to rifampicin and
other antitubercular drugs.
M. marinum closely resembles M. kansasii
but is differentiated from it by its (1) poor growth
at 37 C, (2) failure to reduce nitrate to nitrite and
(3) failure to produce the enzyme catalase.
M. marinum—originally isolated from ﬁsh—is
the causative agent of swimming pool or ﬁsh
tank granuloma. This condition is associated
with the development of superﬁcial granuloma-
tous lesions in the skin.
M. simiae associated with pulmonary disease
in humans was originally isolated from monkeys.
This species grows well at 37 C and is niacin
positive, like M. tuberculosis.
Scotochromogens (Runyon Group II)
These include mycobacteria, are characterised by
their ability to produce yellow, orange or red
pigmented colonies on the LJ medium even
when incubated in the dark (scotochromogen)
(Fig. 31.6). These species are widely distributed
in
the
environment.
Mycobacterium
scrofulaceum,
Mycobacterium
gordonae
and
Mycobacterium szulgai are important species.
M. scrofulaceum causes infection localised to
lymphatic tissues and is responsible for causing

scrofula or cervical adenitis in children. Morpho-
logically, on staining, the bacillus shows short or
long ﬁlaments. It is sensitive to cyclobenzaprine
but resistant to INH.
Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM)
453
Fig. 31.6 LJ medium showing the colonies of Mycobac-
terium fortuitum
M. gordonae rarely causes pulmonary disease.
It is often found as a contaminant in tap water,
hence called tap water scotochromogen. This is
also found as a contaminant in clinical specimens.
M. gordonae does not hydrolyse urea, nicotin-
amide and pyrazinamide; in this respect, it differs
from M. scrofulaceum.
M. szulgai occasionally may cause pulmonary
disease and bursitis. It is a scotochromogen when
grown at 37 C and a photochromogen when
grown at 27 C.
Non-Photochromogens (Runyon Group III)
These are the mycobacteria that do not produce
pigment
in
the
dark
or
exposure
to
light
(non-photochromogens).
These
include
M. avium complex, Mycobacterium xenopi and
Mycobacterium
ulcerans. They also include
Mycobacterium terrae, Mycobacterium triviale
and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum, which
rarely cause infections in humans.
M. avium complex possesses 28 agglutination
types. Types 1, 2 and 3 are considered M. avium
and
other
types
(Types
4–28)
as
M. intracellulare. They are found commonly in
the environment, such as in soil and water (brack-
ish, ocean and drinking water). They are strongly
acid-fast mycobacteria with a cell wall rich in
lipids. The ability to grow inside the cells is the
main virulence determinant of the bacteria. In
infected humans, the development of the disease
depends primarily on the host’s response to
infection.
M. avium complex produces a disease similar
to
pulmonary
tuberculosis
in
patients
with
compromised
pulmonary
function,
such
as
patients with chronic bronchitis or obstructive
pulmonary disease, that is, previous damage to
lungs due to infection or other diseases. In
patients with human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV)
infection,
it
produces
a
typically
disseminated disease affecting virtually every
organ in infected humans. The intensity of
infections in these patients is very high. In some
patients,
tissues
are
overloaded
with
mycobacteria,
and
blood
contains
nearly
100–1000
mycobacteria/mL
of
blood.
The
disseminated infection is commonly seen in
persons at the terminal stage of the immunologi-
cal disorder, with their CD4 count falling below
10 cells/mm3. The infection is acquired following
inhalation of infectious aerosols. The infection is

also acquired by ingesting the water or food
contaminated with mycobacteria. Person-to-per-
son transmission does not occur.
454
31
Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria
Diagnosis of infection is made by microscopy
of clinical specimens and culture on LJ medium.
Treatment with clarithromycin or azithromycin
combined with ethambutol and rifabutin for a
long period is effective. Chemoprophylaxis with
clarithromycin or azithromycin in AIDS patients
with low CD4 cell count has drastically reduced
the incidence of infection in these patients.
M. xenopi was originally isolated from a
cutaneous
lesion
of
a
South
African
toad
(Xenopus laevis). The organism is a thermophilic
mycobacterium, which may occasionally cause
chronic pulmonary lesions in humans. Most of
these
infections
have
been
documented
in
London. The bacteria have been isolated from
mostly hot water taps and main water supplies
in hospitals.
M. ulcerans is a skin pathogen that was origi-
nally isolated from human ulcerative skin lesions
in Australia (1958). Subsequently, the species
causing similar cutaneous lesions have been
documented from Uganda (Buruli ulcer), Nigeria,
Congo, Malaysia, New Guinea and Mexico.
M. ulcerans grows slowly on LJ medium in
4–8 weeks when incubated at 31–34 C. How-
ever, this species fails to grow when incubated at
37 C in primary culture. M. ulcerans is the only
known
mycobacterial
species
to
produce
exotoxins. This toxin is a phospholipoprotein–
lipopolysaccharide complex with a high molecu-
lar weight. The toxin produces inﬂammation and
necrosis when inoculated intradermally into the
skin of guinea pigs, and lesions similar to those
seen in humans are formed. Therefore, it is
believed that the toxin plays an important role in
the pathogenesis of ulcers—the main pathology
of the disease seen in humans.

. After an incubation period of a few weeks,
the infection begins with minor injuries on the
skin through which mycobacteria gain access.
Indurated nodule at the inoculation site, which
breaks down, forming an indolent ulcer, is the
typical lesion. Ulcers of the skin are typically
seen on the legs or the arms. Diagnosis is based
on microscopy of the smears collected from the
edge of the ulcer. Large numbers of acid-fast and
alcohol-fast bacilli are seen in the stained smear
by microscopy. Finally, the ulcer heals with the
formation of scars. M. marinum and M. ulcerans
belong to two different groups, but both are
exclusively skin pathogens, and their differential
features are listed in Table 31.5.
Rapid Growers (Runyon Group IV)
These are a heterogeneous group of mycobacteria
that rapidly produce visible growth on LJ medium
within 1 week of incubation at 37 or 25 C. This
group
may
also
include
photochromogens,
scotochromogens or non-photochromogens spe-
cies. Some of the rapid growers are chromogenic

ventional antibacterial antibiotics. Differential

Rapid growers are associated with diseases of
deep subcutaneous tissues following trauma or
iatrogenic infections. These species have been
isolated from (1) contaminated wound dressing,
(2)
infections
associated
with
intravenous
catheters or (3) infections associated with pros-
thetic devices, such as heart-lung machines. Such
infections are now being increasingly recognised
from hospitalised patients due to an increase in
the use of such medical devices.
M. fortuitum and M. chelonae cause chronic
abscesses in humans following infections of
vaccines and other preparations contaminated by
these mycobacteria. The infection also occurs
following some injury. They are non-chromogen
do not produce any pigments. The bacilli are
usually found in the soil. M. fortuitum causes a
pulmonary disease similar to pulmonary tubercu-
losis. Both M. chelonae and M. fortuitum grow
well at 35 C and form white- to cream-coloured
colonies and reveal coccoid to ﬁlamentous mor-
phology on staining.
M. phlei is mostly non-pathogenic. It produces
buff-coloured colonies, which become yellow to
orange on further incubation. It differs from
M. smegmatis by its ability to grow at 52 C and
survive heating at 60 C for 4 h. M. smegmatis is
normally found in smegma, a whitish secretion
around the oriﬁce of the urethra. These bacilli are
slender, curved and rigid rods. These bacilli are
both acid and alcohol fast, but some bacilli may
only
be
acid-fast
but
not
alcohol
fast.
M.
smegmatis
is
a
rare
human
pathogen
associated with occasional cases of lung, skin
and bone infections.
Treatment
Most of the environmental mycobacteria are
resistant to common antituberculous drugs. Nev-
ertheless, M. avium and M. kansasii infections
may be treated with rifampicin, INH and etham-
butol. Various combinations of drugs, including
rifabutin, clofazimine, quinolones, macrolides
and others, are also used in the treatment.
Epidemiology
NTMs as environmental bacteria are ubiquitous
and are prevalent in soil, water and air. Infection
by these mycobacteria may result in sensitisation
to mycobacterial antigens. This results in a
weakly positive Mantoux reaction due to the
cross-reactivity with the tubercle bacillus protein.
Protective response to BCG vaccination could be
inﬂuenced by the sensitisation with environmen-
tal mycobacteria. This might be one of the
reasons
for
a
wide
variation
in
protective
responses of the BCG vaccine in ﬁeld trials in

different parts of the world. It has been observed
that NTM diseases are more frequent in areas
where tuberculosis is rare. Conversely, opportu-
nistic mycobacterial diseases are rare in the area
endemic for tuberculosis. Opportunistic myco-
bacterial species such as M. avium, M. kansasii
and M. xenopi may colonise tap water. Use of this
contaminated
water
during
staining
for
mycobacteria may give false-positive results.

Actinomycetes
32
Actinomycetes are Gram-positive, catalase-posi-
tive, non-motile bacilli. They are considered tran-
sitional forms between bacteria and fungi. They
have a cell wall with muraminic acid similar to
bacteria, possess prokaryotic nuclei and are sen-
sitive to various antibiotics. They also produce
delicate ﬁlament-like hyphae, similar to fungal
hyphal forms. These hyphal forms are seen in
bacteria isolated by culture and are also seen in
clinical specimens.
The actinomycetes include a wide range of
bacteria found in soil and putreﬁed vegetables.
They are also found in humans and animals. The
actinomycetes include anaerobic or facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the genus Actino-
myces. Furthermore, aerobic actinomycetes can
be broadly classiﬁed into two groups depending
on the presence or absence of mycolic acids in the
cell wall.
1. Actinomycetes with mycolic acids: This
group includes members of three families:
Corynebacteriaceae,
Mycobacteriaceae
and
Nocardiaceae.
The
family
Nocardiaceae
consists
of
four
genera:
Nocardia,
Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella and Gordonia.
Members of all these genera stain poorly with
Gram stain and are partially acid-fast.
2. Actinomycetes without mycolic acid: This
group includes many opportunistic pathogens,

such as Actinomadura, Nocardiopsis, Strepto-
myces, Dermatophilus, Oerskovia, Rothia,
Tropheryma
and
thermophilic
actinomycetes—Saccharopolyspora,
Saccharomonospora and Thermoactinomyces.
Human infections caused by actinomycetes are
summarised in Table 32.1.
Actinomyces
In 1877, a mould-like organism in the lesion of
“lumpy jaw” (actinomycosis) in cattle was found
by Bollinger. Harz coined the name Actinomyces,
which refers to the ray-like appearance of the
organism in the granules that is typical of the
lesions. Actinomyces refers to ray fungus. In
1891, an anaerobic bacillus was isolated from
human lesions, which produced experimental
infection in guinea pigs and rabbits by Wolff
and Israel. This was known as Actinomyces
israelii.
A. israelii is the most common Actinomyces
causing human infection. Other species are Acti-
nomyces gerencsonei, Actinomyces turicensis,
Actinomyces radingae, Actinomyces europaeus,
Actinomyces
naeslundii,
Actinomyces
odontolyticus, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomy-
ces meyeri and Propionibacterium propionicum.

non-sporing and weakly acid-fast in Kinyoun
acid-fast staining. They measure 0.5–1 μm i
diameter. They often grow in ﬁlaments that sepa-
rate into bacillary and coccoid ﬁlaments.
Culture
Actinomyces are facultative anaerobes. They
grow better under anaerobic or microaerophilic
conditions
at
an
optimum
temperature
of
35–37 C. The presence of 5–10% CO2 facilitates
growth. Actinomyces species grow slowly; they
need a longer incubation period of 3–4 days.
A. israelii may require even 7–14 days for
growth.
Brain–heart infusion agar or heart infusion
agar supplemented with 5% deﬁbrinated rabbit,
sheep or horse blood is the enriched medium used
frequently for Actinomyces. On this medium, in
anaerobic to microaerophilic conditions, the bac-
teria form colonies with a characteristic molar-
tooth appearance.
Heart
infusion
blood
and
thioglycolate
blood supplemented with 0.1–0.2% sterile rabbit
serum are examples of liquid media used to
culture Actinomyces species. In thioglycolate
broth,
the
production
of
general
turbidity
indicates
Actinomyces
bovis,
whereas
the
deposition of ﬂuffy balls at the bottom of the
tube indicates A. israelii.
Pathogenesis
Actinomyces species are present as normal ﬂora of
the oral cavity and in the lower gastrointestinal
tract and female genital tract of human hosts.
Actinomyces by themselves are not virulent.
They require the presence of devitalised or dead
tissue and a break in the continuity of the mucosal
membranes
to
cause
infection.
Actinomyces
always need companion bacteria to initiate infec-
tion. These accompanying bacteria help establish
infection by releasing toxins or enzymes or
inhibiting host immunity.
These companion bacteria are believed to act
as co-pathogens that enhance the virulence of
Actinomyces. These companion bacteria include
Biﬁdobacterium
dentium,
Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans,
Eikenella
corrodens,
Haemophilus
aphrophilus,
Bacteroides,
Fusobacterium,
staphylococci
and
anaerobic
streptococci.
Once Actinomyces establish the infection, the
immune system of the infected human host
stimulates an intense inﬂammatory response in
the form of a suppurative granulomatous and
ﬁbrotic reaction. Infection by Actinomyces typi-
cally
spreads
contiguously
and
invades

surrounding tissues and organs. Finally, the infec-
tion results in the production of draining sinus
tracts which contain much-damaged tissue. Bac-
teria from this site may disseminate through blood
circulation to distant organs.
Actinomyces
459
Clinical Syndromes
Actinomyces causes actinomycosis.
Actinomycosis
Actinomycosis is a sub-acute and chronic bacte-
rial infection. It is characterised by contiguous
spread
and
suppurative
and
granulomatous
inﬂammation. The condition is associated with
the formation of multiple abscesses and the devel-
opment of sinus tracts discharging white to
yellowish granules, known as sulphur granules
(Fig. 32.1). Actinomycosis may manifest as
(1) cervicofacial actinomycosis, (2) thoracic acti-
nomycosis and (3) actinomycosis of the abdomen
and pelvis.
Cervicofacial Actinomycosis
It is the most common manifestation in humans,
comprising about two-thirds of reported cases.
The infection occurs in the cervicofacial region,
typically following oral surgery in patients with
poor
oral
hygiene.
Initially,
the
condition
manifests as a swelling of the soft tissue of the
perimandibular area. Subsequently, during the
course of the infection, the disease spreads
directly into the adjacent tissues and leads to the
formation of ﬁstulas. These ﬁstulas or sinus tracts
discharge purulent material containing yellow
granules, known as sulphur granules. If left
untreated, this condition may spread to the
blood and eventually to the brain and the orbit.

granules of actinomycosis.

images/20030129/9/PHIL_
3041_lores.jpg)
Thoracic Actinomycosis
It is responsible for 15–20% of cases of actino-
mycosis. It is caused by aspiration of oropharyn-
geal
secretions
containing
Actinomyces
and
occasionally during perforation of the oesopha-
gus. The condition also occurs by direct spread
from an actinomycotic lesion of the nape of the
neck or the abdomen or through blood circulation
from other distant sites. The condition commonly
presents as a pulmonary inﬁltrate or mass involv-
ing the lung. This condition, without speciﬁc
treatment,
can
rapidly
spread
superﬁcially
through the pleural cavity, pericardium and
chest wall. Finally, the condition results in the
formation of multiple sinuses, which discharge
sulphur granules.

Actinomycetes
Actinomycosis of the Abdomen and Pelvis
The condition accounts for nearly 10–20% of
reported cases. The ileocaecal region is the most
common site involved in the condition. The con-
dition typically presents as a slowly growing
tumour. The infection subsequently spreads and
involves abdominal organs, including the abdom-
inal wall, leading to the formation of draining
sinuses. Actinomycosis of the pelvis is commonly
associated with prolonged (for many years) use of
intrauterine contraceptive devices. The infection
spreads directly from the uterus to the pelvis.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory
diagnosis
is
made
by
directly
detecting Actinomyces in specimens by micros-
copy and isolating the organism by culture.
Specimens
The
specimens
include
sputum,
bronchial
secretions and discharges and infected tissues.
All these specimens may contain a large number
of sulphur granules. The sulphur granules are also
present on the dressings removed from a draining
sinus tract. It is essential to transport these
specimens immediately to the laboratory for
processing,
preferably
under
anaerobic
conditions.
Microscopy
Sulphur granules are white to yellow and vary in
size from minute specs to large granules. These
granules are separated from pus and other
specimens,
and
are
collected
directly
from
draining sinuses. These are crushed between two
slides and are stained by the Gram or Ziehl–
Neelsen staining method, using 1% sulphuric
acid for decolourisation. The stained smears
show
Gram-positive
hyphal
fragments,
surrounded by a peripheral zone of swollen,
radiating, club-shaped structures presenting a
sun-ray appearance. These club-shaped structures
are Gram-positive and acid-fast, and are believed
to be antigen complexes.
Culture
Sulphur granules or pus-containing Actinomyces
are
immediately
cultured
under
anaerobic
conditions at 35–37 C for up to 14 days. The
specimens are inoculated on blood agar, BHI agar
and into thioglycollate broth and incubated anaer-
obically at 37 C. After 10 days of anaerobic
incubation, A. israelii produces large (2–5 m
in diameter), white, smooth, entire or lobulated
colonies resembling a molar tooth.
Actinomycetes
colonies
are
identiﬁed
by
microscopy, biochemical reactions, direct ﬂuores-
cent antibody test and gel immunodiffusion test.
The direct ﬂuorescent antibody test and gel
immunodiffusion
test
are
very
useful
for
differentiating A. israelii from other actinomy-
cotic species and ﬁlamentous anaerobes that pro-
duce similar granules in the tissues.
Molecular Detection
DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) have been evaluated and used with high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity to identify Actinomyces
species in clinical specimens accurately.
Treatment
High-dose penicillin or tetracyclines given over a
prolonged period are the mainstay of therapy for
actinomycosis. Methicillin, oxacillin and cloxa-
cillin are not effective against the Actinomyces
species. Surgical therapy is included for more
extensive
and
complicated
cases
of
actinomycosis.
Epidemiology
Actinomycosis is distributed worldwide. The
condition is more common in rural areas and
farm workers. More commonly, the condition is
seen in individuals with poor dental hygiene and
low socioeconomic conditions. Men are affected
more commonly than women (the male-to-female
ratio is 4:3) except for pelvic actinomycosis. The

Tests
majority of the cases are reported in young and
middle-aged patients.
Nocardia
461
Prevention and Control
Good dental hygiene and oral hygiene are impor-
tant for preventing the disease.
Nocardia
Nocardia are aerobic actinomycetes that are ubiq-
uitous in the soil, decaying organic matter and
water. The genus Nocardia has been classiﬁed
into ten species based on phylogenetic analysis
of 16S rRNA. These species can be differentiated
based
on
biochemical
reactions.
Nocardia
asteroides,
Nocardia
brasiliensis,
Nocardia
aotitidiscaviarum and Nocardia farcinica are fre-
quently associated with human infections. The
Nocardia species also cause infection in animals,
including bovine mastitis in cattle and nocardiosis
in horses.
Nocardia infection was ﬁrst described by
French veterinarian Edmund Nocard in a pulmo-
nary and cutaneous disease of cattle. The genus
Nocardia is named so in honour of the scientist.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Nocardia are Gram-positive bacilli showing a
branching, beaded and ﬁlamentous form. They
stain poorly with Gram stain and appear to be
Gram-negative with intracellular Gram-positive
granules. Nocardia, like mycobacteria, contain
mycolic acid in their cell wall. They are usually
weakly acid-fast. Acid-fastness is a property of
Nocardia by which they can be differentiated
from other similar bacteria, such as actinomycetes.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Nocardia are strictly aerobic bacteria. They read-
ily grow on commonly used routine media, such
as nutrient agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar, BHI
agar and yeast malt extract agar. The presence of
5–10% of CO2 facilitates the growth of the bacte-
ria. Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE)
agar is a selective medium used to isolate
Nocardia
from
specimens
potentially
contaminated with other bacteria.

Nocardia are slow-growing bacteria and need
prolonged incubation of 7 days or more for their
culture and isolation in the media. Nocardia on
these media produce colonies varying from dry to
waxy and white to orange.
Nocardia are catalase positive, and they use
sugars oxidatively. They produce acid from glu-
cose, and they use urea. Biochemical reactions of
different Nocardia species are summarised in
Table 32.2.
Pathogenesis
Nocardia species are opportunistic pathogens.
They cause suppurative necrosis with the forma-
tion of abscesses at the site of infection.
Clinical Syndromes
N. asteroides is the most important species caus-
ing approximately 90% of human infections.
Clinical manifestations of disease caused by
Nocardia depend on the site of infection.
Primary Cutaneous Nocardiosis
Primary cutaneous nocardiosis may manifest as
cutaneous
infection
and
lymphocutaneous
infection.

462
32
Actinomycetes
Cutaneous
infection
may
occur
through
wound contamination or trauma. Usually, feet
and hands are involved. This is a painless chronic
skin infection characterised by subcutaneous
swelling, suppuration and multiple sinuses. This
is an invasive and destructive infection in which
underlying bone and connective tissues are
destroyed. Multiple sinuses open to the skin’s
surface with exudation or pus as the infection
progresses. The pus typically contains sulphur
granules which consist of ﬁlamentous Nocardia
bound together by calcium phosphate.
Lymphocutaneous infection is characterised
by the presence of cutaneous nodules and ulcers
associated with lymphadenopathy. The lymph-
adenopathy also may occasionally drain purulent
pus.
Bronchopulmonary Infection
Bronchopulmonary infection is one of the impor-
tant clinical manifestations in most patients with
nocardiosis.
The
presence
of
inﬂammatory
endobronchial masses, localised or generalised
abscesses are the important presentations. The
condition is associated with the formation of
cavities, abscesses in the lungs and pleural effu-
sion. Cough with the production of sputum and
fever are the common symptoms. Clinically, this
condition cannot be distinguished from infections
of other microbial aetiology.
Secondary Central Nervous System (CNS)
Infection
The condition manifests as chronic meningitis or
a manifestation of single or multiple abscesses in
the brain. CNS nocardiosis presents as a slow,
progressing mass lesion and is found in 20–40%
of disseminated nocardial infections.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of nocardiosis depends on
the demonstration of Nocardia by microscopy
and isolation by culture.
Specimens
The nature of the clinical specimens depends on
the clinical presentation of nocardiosis. Sputum
is a frequently used specimen. Other specimens
include respiratory secretions, skin biopsies or
pus from the abscesses.
Microscopy
Diagnosis is made by demonstration of branching
actinomycotic ﬁlaments in pus or multiple spu-
tum specimens by microscopy. Smears from the
specimen are stained by the Gram or Ziehl–
Neelsen method.
The granules of N. brasiliensis, N. asteroides
and Nocardia caviae are soft and white, and mea-
sure 0.5–1 mm in size. These granules are very
useful for diagnosis. The granules are collected
from pus specimens with an inoculating needle
and then washed with saline. The granules then
are crushed between two slides, are stained with
Giemsa or Ziehl–Neelsen method for the pres-
ence of typical ﬁlamentous hyphae (Fig. 32.2).
Culture and Identification
Pus, sputum and granules are cultured on nutrient
agar, BHI agar and Sabouraud agar and are
incubated at 36 C for up to 3 weeks. Colonies
on these media may appear as early as 7 days. The
colonies are identiﬁed based on Gram-positive
and weekly acid-fast positive ﬁlamentous bacilli
and other biochemical properties. All the species
of
the
genus
Nocardia
(N.
brasiliensis,
N.
otitidiscaviarum,
N.
asteroides
complex
including
N.
asteroides,
N.
farcinica
and
Nocardia nova) are identiﬁed by using a battery
of biochemical tests.
Treatment
Sulphonamides are the drug of choice for the
treatment of nocardiosis. Sulphadiazine is useful
for the treatment of CNS infections. Trimetho-
prim and sulphamethoxazole are considered bet-
ter
than
sulphadiazine.
Nocardia
are
also

susceptible to carbapenems, such as imipenem,
cilastatin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and amikacin.

Epidemiology
Nocardial infections are reported worldwide, but
no reliable estimates are available.
Habitat
Nocardia are distributed in soil rich in organic
matter. They are present as transient pathogens in
humans.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Nocardia spp., which colonise healthy humans,
usually do not cause infection in the same host.
They are exogenous pathogens. The infection
occurs when infective aerosols are inhaled or
when they penetrate through the skin. Pulmonary
and disseminated nocardiosis increasingly occur
in
immunocompromised
individuals.
The
infections are much more common in patients
with HIV or immunocompromised patients who
received an organ, bone marrow or stem-cell
transplantation, and in patients with cirrhosis,
SLE and lymphoreticular malignancies. The con-
dition is also more common in patients with
chronic pulmonary disease, such as emphysema,
bronchitis, bronchiectasis.
Prevention and Control
Prophylactic antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim
and sulphamethoxazole is of some value in
preventing the disease.
Rhodococcus
Rhodococcus species are Gram-positive and strict
aerobic
actinomycetes.
The
cell
wall
of
Rhodococcus organisms is similar to that of
mycobacterium; it contains mycolic acid and
tuberculostearic acid, which makes the bacteria
acid-fast. The genus contains 20 species, out of
which at least seven species are known to cause
disease in humans.
Rhodococcus equi, formerly known as Cory-
nebacterium equi, is the most important human
pathogen. R. equi is a pleomorphic Gram-positive
coccobacillus
showing
some
degrees
of
branching. It is weakly acid-fast. Rhodococcus
grows well on routinely used media aerobically.
On blood agar, on prolonged incubation at room
temperature, the bacteria produce colonies resem-
bling those of Klebsiella, with the production of
pink pigments. The bacteria do not ferment
carbohydrates and show a variable biochemical
reaction. R. equi is an intracellular pathogen that
multiplies in macrophages. This causes a granu-
lomatous reaction, resulting in the formation of an

abscess. The bacteria cause invasive pulmonary
diseases, such as pneumonia and lung abscess.
Subsequently, the infection may spread to distant
body sites, causing meningitis, pericarditis and
so on.
464
32
Actinomycetes
In immunocompetent hosts, rhodococci cause
opportunistic
infections,
such
as
traumatic
endophthalmitis,
peritonitis
in
patients
undergoing
dialysis
and
post-traumatic
skin
infection. The diagnosis of the condition is made
by demonstration of weakly acid-fast and Gram-
positive
pleomorphic
bacilli
in
clinical
specimens. Deﬁnitive diagnosis by culture is
often difﬁcult. Rhodococci are difﬁcult bacteria
to treat, particularly in immunocompromised
patients. They are resistant to penicillins and
cephalosporins. Treatment with vancomycin or a
combination of erythromycin and rifampicin is
effective.
Tropheryma whippeli
T. whippeli is an actinomycete known to cause
Whipple disease. The bacterium is yet to be
cultured. It is usually identiﬁed by molecular
techniques. Whipple disease manifests as abdom-
inal pain, diarrhoea, fever, lymphadenopathy,
skin pigmentation and arthralgia. The condition
is diagnosed by demonstrating the periodic acid–
Schiff-positive inclusion bodies found inside
macrophages of the lamina propria of the small
intestine. Detection of the bacterial genome by
PCR in intestinal tissue conﬁrms the diagnosis.
Dermatophilus
Dermatophilus is an actinomycete that causes
exudative dermatitis affecting the skin of the
hands and feet. The condition is commonly seen
in individuals in close contact with infected
animals or contaminated animal products. These
pathogens are susceptible to commonly used
antibiotics,
such
as
penicillins
and
aminoglycosides. Dermatophilus is commonly
found in the soil.
Actinomycotic mycetoma
Actinomyces (A. israelii and A. bovis), Nocardia
(N. asteroids, N. brasiliensis and N. caviae),
Actiomadura
(Actiomadura
madurae
and
Actiomadura
pelletierii)
and
Streptomyces
someliensis are different actinomycetes known
to cause bacterial mycetomas. Botryomycosis or
mycetoma-like lesions may be caused by Staphy-
lococcus aureus and a few other pyogenic
bacteria.
Actinomycetes and Hypersensitivity
Pneumonitis
A
few
thermophilic
actinomycetes
like
the
Faenia and Saccharomonospora species that are
found in mouldy hay produce spores that may
induce allergic alveolitis when inhaled. This
leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (Farmer’s lung).
Case Study
A 55-year-old man attended the dental OPD with
a swelling of the soft tissue of the perimandibular
area with sinus tracts discharging purulent mate-
rial. The material containing yellow granules was
sent to the microbiology laboratory for identiﬁca-
tion. Microscopy of smears made from granules
showed
Gram-positive
hyphal
fragments
surrounded by a peripheral zone of swollen,
radiating, club-shaped structures presenting a

Clostridium
33
The genus Clostridium consists of Gram-positive,
anaerobic bacilli capable of forming endospores.
The endospores typically are wider than the bod-
ies of the bacilli, giving the bacteria a swollen
appearance resembling a spindle, hence the name
Clostridium (kloster means spindle).
Genus Clostridium
Most
Clostridium
species
are
harmless
saprophytes in the soil, water, sewage and
decomposed (animal and plant) products. They
are also present as part of the normal ﬂora in the
gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals.
Only a few species cause infections in humans
(Table 33.1).
Multiple factors are responsible for the anaer-
obic infections, including those caused by the
Clostridium species. Anaerobic infections are
more common in diabetes, malnutrition and
long-term use of ineffective antibiotics such as
aminoglycosides to treat anaerobic infections;
these factors act as predisposing factors. A
pre-existing infection with aerobes and faculta-
tive anaerobes may also create a more favourable
environment for the growth of anaerobic bacteria
by lowering the oxygen level at the site of infec-
tion. Normally, certain underlying conditions
such as trauma, tissue necrosis, inadequate
blood supply and haematoma formation result in
decreased oxidation and reduction potential of the
tissue, which facilitates the development of anaer-
obic infections. Due to the anaerobic environ-
ment, there will be impairment in the body’s
immune mechanisms, favouring the progression
of anaerobic infection.

Tetanus, gas gangrene and botulism are three
major clinical syndromes caused by the Clostrid-
ium species. A classiﬁcation of clostridia based
on morphological and biochemical classiﬁcation
characteristics is provided in Table 33.2.
Classification
Phenotypic classiﬁcation of clostridia is based
on
morphology,
culture
and
biochemical
properties. Molecular classiﬁcation is based on
16S rRNA gene sequences. A total of 19 clusters
of clostridia have been identiﬁed. The type spe-
cies is Clostridium butyricum, and the genus
Clostridium is a mixed bag of all Gram-positive,
spore-forming, anaerobic organisms. As a result,
there are many phylogenetically and phenotypi-
cally diverse organisms in this genus. It consists
of Gram-positive, large bacilli. The important
characteristics include the following:
Endospore formation; fermentative metabo-
lism, inability to grow in aerobic condition
(a few are aero-tolerant); long survival of spores,
mostly saprophytic, and they produce various
extracellular enzymes active against proteins,
lipids and sugars.

General Properties of Clostridia
Most species are anaerobic, but a few species,
such as Clostridium tertium and Clostridium
histolyticum, are aerotolerant and hence can
grow on agar even in the presence of air.
Clostridia are rod-shaped bacilli measuring
3–8  0.4–1.2 μm in size. The bacilli are highly
pleomorphic and show long ﬁlaments and involu-
tion forms. They are Gram-positive but old
cultures may appear Gram-variable and even
Gram-negative. The Clostridium species with a
few exceptions (e.g. Clostridium perfringens,
Clostridium tetani type VI) are motile due to the
presence of peritrichous ﬂagella. Most clostridia
except C. perfringens and C. butyricum are
non-capsulated.
Spores
The ability to produce endospores is the most
important feature of clostridia. Sporulation takes
place outside in the environment and also in ani-
mal bodies, but not in humans. The formation of
spores is variable depending on the species.

Clostridium sporogenes and other clostridia spor-
ulate readily, while C. perfringens and other spe-
cies produce spores inconsistently. The shape and
location of the spores (Fig. 33.1) in the bacteria
vary across different clostridial species.

bacillus

spindle
shape.
Sub-terminal spores are
present in
C. perfringens, giving the bacillus a club shape.
Oval terminal spores are present in C. tertium,
giving the bacillus a tennis racket shape, and
spherical terminal spores in C. tetani, giving
the bacillus a drumstick appearance.
Spores are relatively more resistant forms than
the vegetative forms of the bacilli. They show a
variable degree of resistance to heat, drying and
disinfectants. Spores are killed by a 1% aqueous
solution of iodine and 2% glutaraldehyde at
pH 7.5–8.5. They are particularly resistant to
phenolic disinfectants. The spores survive in 2%
formaldehyde solution for up to 5 days.
Culture and Biochemical Tests
Most species are anaerobic, but a few species,
such as C. tertium and C. histolyticum, are
aerotolerant and hence can grow on agar even in
the presence of air. Most clostridia grow at an
optimum temperature of 37 C and pH of 7–7.4.
Some clostridial species produce haemolysis on
blood agar. Robertson cooked meat (RCM) broth
is a useful medium for the growth of clostridia.
The medium contains unsaturated fatty acids,
digested
meat
and
sulfhydryl
compounds.
Clostridia grow well in the medium, rendering
the broth turbid. Saccharolytic clostridia turn the
meat pink, while proteolytic species turn the meat
black and produce a foul smell. Most clostridia
produce gas.
The bacteria are sensitive to metronidazole,
penicillin and cephalosporins. They are less sen-
sitive to tetracyclines and resistant to quinolones
and aminoglycosides.

Clostridium
Clostridium perfringens
C. perfringens is the most important Clostridium
species causing gas gangrene, a severe life-
threatening disease. The bacteria also cause
necrotic enteritis and food poisoning.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C. perfringens is a large, rectangular, Gram-
positive bacillus measuring 4–6 μm in length. It
is a straight bacillus with parallel sides, and round
and truncated ends. They possess central or
sub-terminal spores. The bacilli occur as single,
in chains or bundles. The bacilli are capsulated.
The bacilli are non-motile; however, the bacteria
multiply rapidly, giving a characteristic spreading
colony appearance on the media, resembling the
growth of motile clostridia. The bacilli are
capsulated.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
C. perfringens is an anaerobic but aerotolerant
bacterium.
The
bacteria
can
grow
under
microaerophilic conditions and do not die on
exposure to air. They grow at a temperature
range of 20–44 C (optimum temperature 37 C)
and a pH range of 5.5–8.0.
C. perfringens produces good growth in RCM
broth. The meat present in the broth is not
digested but is turned pink. It produces an acidic
reaction and a sour odour in the culture. Some
strains of C. perfringens can grow optimally at
45 C with generation time reduced to 10 min.
This property is used to isolate C. perfringens in
the
RCM
medium
when
specimens
are
contaminated with other clostridial species.
Inoculating the specimens in RCM media
followed by incubation at 45 C for 4–6 min
and
subsequently
cultured
on
blood
agar
produces pure and predominant colonies of
C.
perfringens.

blood
agar
containing
human, sheep or rabbit blood, C. perfringens on
prolonged incubation produces a dual zone of
haemolysis. This is due to a narrow zone of
complete haemolysis by theta-toxin and a much
wider zone of incomplete haemolysis by the
alpha-toxin of the bacteria.
C. perfringens is metabolically active. The
bacteria ferment glucose, lactose, sucrose and
maltose with acid and gas production. They pro-
duce H2S and reduce nitrate to nitrite. They are
MR positive, VP negative and indole negative.
They ferment lactose with the production of
acid in litmus milk. The colour of the medium
changes from blue to red. The production of acid
coagulates casein of the milk, and the coagulated
milk is broken down by producing a large volume
of gas. Due to the gas release, the parafﬁn plug is
pushed up with shreds of broken clots adhering to
the sides of the glass tube. This reaction is known
as
stormy
fermentation,
characteristic
of
C. perfringens.
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
C. perfringens spores are killed within 5 min by
boiling, but spores of certain strains (food poison-
ing strain of type A, certain strains of type C) are
killed by boiling for a longer period of 1–3 h. The
spores are also killed by autoclaving at 121 C for
15 min. C. perfringens spores are resistant to
commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants.
The bacilli are sensitive to metronidazole and
penicillins.
Typing
Based on four major toxins (alpha-, beta-, epsi-
lon- and iota-toxin) produced by C. perfringens,
strains of C. perfringens are classiﬁed into ﬁve
types (A, B, C, D and E). Typing of strains is
carried out by in vivo tests in animals. This is
done by neutralising the toxins with speciﬁc
antitoxins
via
intravenous
or
percutaneous
injections in mice.
Pathogenesis
C. perfringens produces more than 12 toxins
(major toxins, minor toxins), enzymes and bio-
logically active soluble substances. All these are

the virulence factors that contribute to the patho-
genesis of the diseases (Table 33.3).

Virulence Factors
Toxins
C. perfringens is classiﬁed into ﬁve types (A, B,
C, D and E) depending on the toxins it produces.
Major Toxins
Alpha-, beta-, epsilon- and iota-toxin are the four
major toxins produced by C. perfringens.
Alpha-toxin: It is the most important toxin pro-
duced by all strains of C. perfringens. The
largest volumes of alpha-toxin are provided
by C. perfringens type A strain. The alpha-
toxin is a lecithinase, a phospholipase C,
which breaks down lecithin into phosphor-
ylcholine and diglyceride in the presence of
calcium and magnesium ions. The toxin is
responsible for toxaemia typically observed
during gas gangrene. It is lethal, dermonecrotic
and haemolytic. The alpha-toxin increases vas-
cular permeability of blood vessels, thereby
causing massive haemolysis and bleeding, tis-
sue destruction and myocardial dysfunction.
The
toxin
lyses
erythrocytes,
leukocytes,
platelets and endothelial cells. The alpha-
toxin causes haemolysis of red cells of most
animal species except for goats and horses.
The toxin is relatively heat stable and is par-
tially inactivated by boiling for 5 min. The
lysis of red cells is observed best on incubation
at 37 C followed by re-incubation at 4 C
(hot-cold lysis).
Beta-, epsilon- and iota-toxin: These are the
other
major
toxins
in
addition
to
the
alpha-toxin; these toxins also play a major
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
(Table 33.3).
Minor Toxins
These include delta-, theta-, kappa-, lambda-,
mu- and nu-toxins that contribute to the disease’s
pathogenesis (Table 33.3).
Other Toxins
Enterotoxin: It is produced primarily by the type
A strain of C. perfringens. This is a heat-labile

protein. The toxin is produced during the sporu-
lation stage of vegetative cells to form spores,
which is stimulated by the alkaline environment
of the small intestine. The toxin binds speciﬁcally
to receptors in the epithelium of the small intes-
tine. This disrupts the transport of ions in the
ileum and jejunum, and alters the membrane’s
permeability. The toxin is antigenic, but the spe-
ciﬁc antibodies against this toxin found in the
serum are not protective.
470
33
Clostridium
Enzymes and Biologically Active Soluble
Substances
C. perfringens produces many enzymes and many
biologically active soluble substances.
Neuraminidase
is
the
most
important
enzyme. This alters cell surface ganglioside
receptors and promotes capillary permeability.
The bursting factor acts speciﬁcally on muscle
tissue. It may be responsible for typical muscle
lesions
observed
in
gas
gangrene.
The
circulating factor increases the adrenaline sensi-
tivity of the capillary membrane. It also inhibits
phagocytosis.
Other
enzymes
include
haemagglutinin, ﬁbrinolysins and haemolysins
(Table 33.3).
Pathogenesis of Gas Gangrene
Gas gangrene is a rapidly spreading oedematous
myonecrotic life-threatening condition caused by
C. perfringens. It occurs following road trafﬁc
accidents or other injuries (like during war)
involving crushing trauma of large muscle mass
contaminated with pathogenic clostridia. Rarely
the condition may occur following surgical
operations.
Gas gangrene is caused by the inoculation of
C. perfringens type A into tissues during trauma
or surgery, followed by replication of the bacteria
and subsequent invasion of the tissues. Low oxy-
gen tension is the most important condition, most
frequently seen in war wounds with implanted
bullets or shell fragments, along with soil
particles and bits of clothing. This contributes to
the multiplication of C. perfringens and other
anaerobic bacteria at the wound site. The condi-
tion occurs in association with extensive muscle
trauma, tearing of arteries and crushing of tissue
causing anoxia of the muscles. The condition is
commonly associated with anaerobic streptococci
and facultative anaerobes, such as staphylococci,
Escherichia coli and Proteus species.
Clinical Syndromes
C. perfringens produces a variety of clinical
syndromes, including gas gangrene, food poison-
ing,
necrotising
enteritis
and
gangrenous
appendicitis.
Gas Gangrene
Gas gangrene is a rapidly spreading oedematous
myonecrotic life-threatening condition. It is also
referred to as anaerobic myositis and clostridial
myonecrosis. The gas gangrene was described as
early as 1954 by Oakley in 1954, like a rapidly
spreading oedematous myonecrosis. Gas gan-
grene is an invasive disease caused by the inva-
sion of muscle masses by C. perfrigens. It occurs
following road trafﬁc accidents or other injuries
(like during war) involving crushing trauma of
large muscle mass contaminated with pathogenic
clostridia. Rarely the condition may occur follow-
ing surgical operations.
The incubation period is variable. It may be as
short as 7 days or as long as 6 weeks after
clostridia are introduced into the tissue by trauma
or surgery. The onset of the disease is rapid and is
associated with increasing pain, tenderness and
oedema of the affected part and systemic signs of
toxaemia. Accumulation of gas in the tissues—
caused by the metabolic activity of the rapidly
dividing clostridia—is characteristic of the dis-
ease, hence the name gas gangrene (Fig. 33.2).
Production and accumulation of gas make the
tissues crepitant. There is a thin watery discharge
from the wound, and subsequently, the discharge
becomes serosanguineous. In untreated cases, the
condition progresses very fast, with extensive
muscle necrosis, shock, renal failure and even
death within 48 h of the onset of the disease.
The clostridial toxins typically cause extensive
haemolysis and bleeding, and ﬁnally, death
occurs due to circulatory failure.

perfringens gas gangrene.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Gas_gangrene)
Food Poisoning
It is a toxin-mediated disease caused by a heat-
labile enterotoxin of C. perfrigens type A. These
strains produce spores, which are heat resistant.
They typically produce an enterotoxin, but alpha-
and theta-toxin production is very minimal.
Food poisoning is caused by the ingestion of
cold and warmed up meat dishes contaminated
with large numbers (108–109) of C. perfringens
type A strains. The incubation period is short,
between 8 and 24 h. Abdominal cramps and
watery diarrhoea—but an absence of nausea,
vomiting
or
fever—are
characteristic
presentations of this condition. The disease is
self-limiting, and recovery occurs within 24–48 h.
Necrotising Enteritis
Necrotising enteritis caused by C. perfringens
type C is an acute necrotising condition of the
jejunum. The condition is characterised by
abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea, shock and
peritonitis.
It
is
severe
and
often
fatal.
Immunisation with type C toxoid has been
reported to protect against this condition. This
condition is known as Pigbel in Papua New
Guinea, where it is very common, and as
Darmbrand
(meaning
“ﬁre
bowels”)
Germany. Sporadic cases have also been reported
from East Africa, Thailand and Nepal.
Other Manifestations
These include gangrenous appendicitis, biliary
tract infection, endogenous gas gangrene of
intraabdominal origin, brain abscess and menin-
gitis, panophthalmitis, thoracic infections, uro-
genital infections and so on. These also include
septicaemia, a life-threatening situation with the
isolation of bacteria in blood culture.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of gas gangrene and other
soft tissue diseases is carried out to (1) conﬁrm
the diagnosis, (2) identify the clostridial species
and (3) differentiate gas gangrene from anaerobic
streptococcal myositis. Treatment has to be
started immediately in suspected and clinically
diagnosed cases without waiting for the labora-
tory results.
Specimens
The specimens for gas gangrene include (1) pus
and other exudates from a deeper part of the
wound and from the sides where infection
appears to be most acute; the specimen is col-
lected by a capillary tube and swab; (2) smears
from the muscles at the edge of the affected site,
from the pus and/or exudate from deeper parts of

the wound and the necrotic tissue; and (3) the
necrotic tissue and pieces of muscle fragments.
472
33
Clostridium
Microscopy
Gram staining of smears is a useful method in
diagnosing C. perfringens infection. It provides
information regarding the species of clostridia
that causes the infection and also indicates a rela-
tive number of the clostridial species found in
clinical specimens. Demonstration of a large
number of Gram-positive bacilli without spores,
and absence of leukocytes in stained smears of
clinical
specimens,
is
suggestive
of
C. perfringens infection. The presence of large
Gram-positive bacilli with oval and sub-terminal
spores suggests Clostridium novyi. Demonstra-
tion of leaf-shaped or boat-shaped pleomorphic
bacilli with irregular staining suggests Clostrid-
ium septicum, and that of slender bacilli with oval
and terminal spores suggests C. tetani or Clos-
tridium tetanomorphum.
Culture and Identification
Specimens are inoculated simultaneously on a set
of two fresh and heated blood agar containing
5–6% agar to prevent swarming. One inoculated
medium is incubated aerobically, and the other
inoculated medium is incubated anaerobically for
24 h or less. C. perfringens grows very rapidly;
hence, colonies can be demonstrated on the media
after a few hours of incubation.
Fig. 33.3 Nagler reaction
(https://phil.cdc.gov/
Details.aspx?pid=3873)
A set of four tubes of RCM media are
inoculated and heated at 100
C for 5, 10,
15 and 20 min and incubated at 37
C for
24–48 h. Subsequently, sub-cultures are made
on blood agar to detect and differentiate various
clostridial species. In cases of septicaemia, blood
culture is often positive for C. perfringens and
C. septicum.
C.
perfringens
grows
rapidly,
produces
spreading colonies on blood agar and produces a
double zone of haemolysis around colonies on
blood agar. Gram-stained smear of the colony
shows large rectangular Gram-positive bacilli. It
is non-motile and capsulated bacteria. It ferments
lactose with acid production in litmus milk
(stormy fermentation positive) and Nagler reac-
tion positive.
Nagler Reaction
It
is
a
useful
test
for
rapid
detection
of
C. perfringens in clinical specimens (Fig. 33.3).
This reaction demonstrates the biological prop-
erty of the enzyme lecithinase—to produce opal-
escence in the serum and the egg yolk media. The
use of speciﬁc antitoxin speciﬁcally neutralises
this reaction.

Clostridium perfringens
473
Fig. 33.4 Reverse CAMP test. (http://phil.cdc.gov/PHIL_Images/14644/14644_lores.jpg)
The
test
is
performed
by
culturing
C. perfringens on a medium containing 6% agar,
5% Fildes peptic digest of sheep blood and 20%
human serum and antibiotic neomycin sulphate.
One-half of the medium is inoculated with spe-
ciﬁc antitoxin raised against C. perfringens, while
the other half of the medium does not contain any
antitoxin. After 48 h of incubation, the colonies of
C. perfringens on the part of the agar without
antitoxin do not show any opacity. This is due
to the neutralisation of the enzymatic activity of
the enzyme lecithinase. The aerobic spore bearers
and coliforms are inhibited by neomycin sulphate
in the medium, making the medium more selec-
tive for C. perfringens.
C. novyi, C. bifermentans, some aerobic spore
bearers and some Vibrio species produce the
enzyme lecithinase; therefore, they also produce
opalescence in the egg yolk medium. However,
the
reaction
is
not
neutralised
by
the
C. perfringens antitoxin but rather by the anti-
toxin of C. bifermentans, which produces a sero-
logically related lecithinase.
Reverse CAMP Test
It is used to identify C. perfringens. In this test, on
the blood agar plate, C. perfringens is streaked in
a straight line at the centre of the plate, and near to
this at the right angle, Streptococcus agalactiae is
streaked. In the case of a positive reverse CAMP
test,
an
arrow-shaped
zone
of
enhanced
haemolysis facing C. perfringens can be seen
(Fig. 33.4).
C. perfringens ferments lactose with the pro-
duction of acid in litmus milk. The colour of the
medium changes from blue to red. The produc-
tion of acid coagulates the casein of the milk, and
the coagulated milk is broken down by producing
a large volume of gas. Due to the gas release, the
parafﬁn plug is pushed up with shreds of broken
clots adhering to the sides of the glass tube. This
reaction is known as stormy fermentation, char-
acteristic of C. perfringens.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Food Poisoning
It is made by demonstrating more than 106 bacte-
ria per gram of faeces collected within 48 h of the

condition’s onset. The specimens for investiga-
tion of food poisoning include faeces and
remnants of food.
474
33
Clostridium
Serology
An enzyme immunoassay to detect enterotoxin in
faeces has recently been developed to diagnose
food poisoning. Commercial kits are available to
detect enterotoxin in stool samples using the
ELISA technique.
Molecular Detection
The C. perfringens enterotoxin is encoded by the
CPE gene, which can be detected in the stool
specimen by PCR. For epidemiological purposes
and to pinpoint the source of infection, pulsed-
ﬁeld gel electrophoresis can be done to identify
the presence of the same strain in the food speci-
men and patient sample.
Treatment
Debriding surgery is the mainstay of prophy-
laxis and treatment of gas gangrene. The cases
are treated aggressively with prompt removal of
damaged tissue and clearing the wounds to
remove foreign materials, necrotic tissue and
blood clots. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment has
been suggested to be beneﬁcial. Antiserum
against alpha-toxin is no longer used.
Prophylactic use of the antibiotic in associa-
tion with surgery is effective for gas gangrene.
Metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice. The
drug is administered intravenously before surgery
and is given three times a day at an interval of 8 h.
Antibiotic
prophylaxis
using
broad-spectrum
antibiotics, such as gentamicin, amoxicillin and
metronidazole, is effective since the occurrence of
mixed infections with aerobic and anaerobic bac-
teria is frequent.
Antibiotic therapy is not recommended for the
treatment of C. perfringens food poisoning.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
C.
perfringens
is
distributed
worldwide.
C. perfringens type A is responsible for most
human diseases, including food poisoning, soft
tissue infections, gas gangrene and primary
septicaemia. C. perfringens type C is responsible
for enteritis necroticans.
Habitat
C. perfringens type A is part of the normal ﬂora of
the intestinal tract of humans and animals. These
bacteria are excreted in the faeces and contami-
nate the perianal region’s skin, buttocks and
thighs. C. perfringens type A spores are ubiqui-
tous. They are found in the soil, dust and air. They
remain viable for a very long period, even in
adverse
environmental
conditions.
C. perfringens types B, C, D and F colonise the
intestinal tracts of animals and occasionally
humans. Their spores usually do not survive
in soil.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Gas gangrene occurs following road trafﬁc
accidents or other injuries (like during war)
involving crushing trauma of large muscle mass
contaminated with pathogenic clostridia. Rarely
the condition may occur following surgical
operations. The condition is caused by contami-
nation of a wound with soil, such as manure soil
or cultivated soil, road dust or bits of clothing
heavily contaminated with C. perfringens and
other pathogenic clostridia (exogenous infection).
Clostridium species on normal skin, especially on
the perineum and thighs, invade through a wound
and cause the infection (endogenous infection).
Clostridial food poisoning occurs following
the ingestion of cold or warmed up meat dishes
contaminated with spores of C. perfringens type
A. Spores are responsible for the infection. Foods
contaminated with a large number of bacteria are
the sources of exogenous infection in case of
necrotising enteritis. The conditions that facilitate
food exposure to a large number of C. perfringens

spores and malnutrition are the risk factors for the
disease.
Clostridium tetani
475
Prevention and Control
The use of antibiotics and wound hygiene are the
key factors that help prevent C. perfringens
infections. Wounds are cleaned and debrided,
and penicillin may be given for prophylaxis. No
vaccine is available against these diseases.
Clostridium histolyticum
This actively proteolytic Clostridium species
occurs worldwide and is found commonly in
soil, faeces or sewage. It is motile and forms
oval,
bulging,
sub-terminal
spores.
C. histolyticum produces nearly ﬁve toxins,
namely alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon.
Infrequently, in association with other bacterial
species, it may cause gas gangrene.
C. histolyticum can be present in normal skin,
on the perineum and on the thighs. It can enter the
wounded site along with foreign particles like
dust, soil, cloth bits or sharpeners. After some
clean surgical procedures such as amputation,
C. histolyticum infection may occur.
Clostridium septicum
C. septicum is ubiquitous. Thus far, six groups
have been recognised based on somatic and ﬂa-
gellar antigens. Along with other clostridia,
C. septicum can also be seen in gas gangrene of
humans regularly in association with malignancy,
pericarditis and mycotic aneurysm. It causes
braxy (sheep) and malignant oedema (cattle
and sheep) in animals.
C. septicum, previously known as Vibrion
septique, is a pleomorphic Gram-positive motile
bacillus. Pasteur and Joubert ﬁrst described it in
1877. It measures about 3–8  0.6 μm in size,
with oval, central or sub-terminal spores. The
growth on ordinary media occurs anaerobically.
On continued incubation, the colonies turn
opaque, which are initially irregular and transpar-
ent. This bacterium is saccharolytic and produces
abundant gas. On blood agar, beta-haemolysis is
seen. It also ferments lactose, maltose and man-
nose. It is an etiological agent of spontaneous gas
gangrene or atraumatic myonecrosis.
C. septicum produces at least four distinct
toxins. The alpha-toxin is the most lethal and
necrotising pore-forming cytolysin, similar to
Aeromonas
hydrophilia’s aerolysin,
and
the
beta-toxin is a leucotoxic deoxyribonuclease, the
gamma-toxin
a hyaluronidase
and a thiol-
activated
delta-toxin
or
septicolysin.
Other
enzymes, such as protease and neuraminidase,
are also produced by this bacterium. C. septicum
is found in the soil or in animal intestines. Along
with other clostridia, C. septicum can also be seen
in gas gangrene of humans regularly in associa-
tion with malignancy, pericarditis and mycotic
aneurysm. It causes braxy (sheep) and malig-
nant oedema (cattle and sheep) in animals.
Clostridium novyi
C. novyi is a Gram-positive bacillus that is long,
thick and pleomorphic. It is an obligate anaerobe.
Spores are large, oval and sub-terminal. C. novyi
naturally occurs in the soil. Based on toxin pro-
duction, it is divided into four types (A, B, C and
D), of which type A is medically important and
causes gas gangrene in humans. The characteris-
tic feature of gas gangrene is excess oedema ﬂuid
with or without observable gas formation in
infected tissue. In 2000, an outbreak of C. novyi
type A infection among heroin addicts was
reported from Britain, in which C. novyi type A
was found to be highly lethal.
Clostridium tetani
C. tetani, an obligate anaerobic Gram-positive
bacillus, causes tetanus. Tetanus is an infectious
disorder characterised by increased muscle tone
and spasms. It is caused by the release of a neu-
rotoxin, tetanospasmin, produced by C. tetani
when it gets inoculated into humans.

Biological functions
476
33
Clostridium
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C. tetani is a slender, Gram-positive bacillus mea-
suring 4–8 μm in length. Young cultures are
usually Gram-positive, but old cultures are
Gram-variable and even Gram-negative.
It is a straight bacillus with parallel sides and
rounded ends. The bacillus occurs in singles and
occasionally in chains. The bacteria consist of
round,
terminal
and
bulging
spores
giving
a drumstick appearance to the bacillus. The
spores are rarely seen in clinical specimens from
lesions or culture media.
All strains of C. tetani except type VI are
motile by the presence of ﬂagella. Type VI strain
bacilli do not contain any ﬂagella; hence they are
non-motile. They are capsulated.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
C. tetani is an obligate anaerobe. The bacteria are
extremely sensitive to oxygen, hence can grow
only in the absence of oxygen. The bacillus grows
at an optimum temperature of 37 C and a pH of
7.4. C. tetani can grow on ordinary media and
media enriched with serum and blood.
C. tetani grows well on the RCM medium.
The bacteria produce turbidity with the produc-
tion of some gas in the medium. Although it is not
digested, the meat turns black on prolonged
incubation.
On blood agar, C. tetani produce alpha-
haemolysis
surrounding
the
colonies.
On
prolonged
incubation,
the
alpha-haemolysis
becomes beta-haemolytic due to the production
of tetanolysin, a haemolysin produced by the
bacteria. Surface colonies tend to swarm over
the entire surface of the agar. C. tetani produces
an extremely ﬁne translucent ﬁlm of growth,
which is difﬁcult to visualise except at the edges
of the colonies.
Table 33.4 Virulence factors of Clostridium tetani
Virulence
factors
Tetanospasmin
Potent heat labile toxin; prevents the release of neurotransmitters (e.g. GABA, glycine), hence blocks
speciﬁc synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. Motor neurons are left under no inhibitory control and
undergo sustained excitatory discharge
Tetanolysin
Heat-stable haemolysin; unknown role in pathogenesis of tetanus. Oxygen-labile haemolysin
Neurotoxin
Non-spasmogenic and peripherally active neurotoxin of unknown signiﬁcance
C. tetani liqueﬁes
gelatine
anaerobically.
Hence, the bacillus produces a ﬁr-tree type of
growth in gelatine stab culture.
Inoculation of the bacteria into the water of
condensation at the bottom of the slope of nutri-
ent agar, followed by anaerobic incubation for
24 h, yields a pure colony of C. tetani at the top of
the slope in the tube. This method is known as the
Fildes technique and is employed as a routine
method for isolating pure colonies of C. tetani.
C. tetani does not ferment any sugars. It nei-
ther produces H2S nor reduces nitrates. It is indole
positive, but MR and VP negative. It produces a
greenish ﬂuorescence on MacConkey medium.
Susceptibility to the Physical and Chemical
Agents
C. tetani spores of different strains show variable
heat resistance. Most spores are killed on boiling at
100 C for 10–15 min and autoclaving at 121 C
for 20 min. They are also killed by a 1% aqueous
iodine solution and 10% hydrogen peroxide. The
spores are resistant to most antiseptics. They are not
killed by 5% phenol or 0.1% mercuric chloride
solution. They can survive in the soil for years.
Typing
C. tetani are classiﬁed into ten serological types
(types I to X) based on agglutination. All strains
produce the same toxin.
Pathogenesis
C. tetani is a non-invasive bacillus. It causes
disease only by producing toxins, which are the
most important virulence factors (Table 33.4).

Clostridium tetani
477
Virulence Factors
Tetanolysin and tetanospasmin are two major
toxins
produced
by
C.
tetani.
These
are
pharmacologically
and
antigenically
distinct.
Non-spasmogenic toxin or neurotoxin is a
recently identiﬁed toxin.
Tetanospasmin
It is the toxin responsible for the clinical
manifestations of tetanus. The toxin is produced
during the stationary phase of growth but is
released only after the lysis of bacteria. It is a
protein synthesised as a single polypeptide chain
of molecular weight (MW) 151,000 Da. On
release from the bacillus, the peptide is split by
an endogenous protease into two chains: a light
chain of 52,000 MW protein and a heavy chain of
93,000 MW protein. The two chains are joined by
the non-covalent forces of a disulphide bond. The
puriﬁed toxin is extremely potent. The minimum
lethal dose (MLD) of toxin for animals is
50–75  106 mg and for humans is 130 Ng.
The toxin acts by preventing the release of
neurotransmitters, such as gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) and glycine, thereby speciﬁcally
blocking synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord.
This leads to the unregulated spread of impulses,
inhibited anywhere in the central nervous system
(CNS). The binding of the toxin is irreversible.
The toxicity of tetanospasmin depends on the
route of administration of the toxin. The route of
administration also modiﬁes the course of clinical
manifestation of the disease. Intraneural injection
and injection directly into the CNS are most
lethal. Intravenous, intramuscular and subcutane-
ous injections are effective, but toxin given orally
is ineffective because the toxin is destroyed by
enzymes present in the gastrointestinal tract. Dif-
ferent species of animals show a wide variety in
susceptibility to tetanospasmin. Birds and reptiles
are highly resistant to the toxin. In descending
order, horses are most susceptible to the toxin,
followed by guinea pigs, goats and rabbits.
Tetanus toxoid is antigenic but non-toxic. Tet-
anus toxin is made into a toxoid by treating it with
formaldehyde.
Tetanus in Experimental Animals
Experimental tetanus in animals such as mice
depends on the administration route of toxins.
Intramuscular injection of toxin in mice causes
ascending tetanus. Intramuscular injection in one
of the hind limbs is associated with the appear-
ance of tonic spasm of the muscles in the injected
limb ﬁrst. This is due to toxins acting on the
segment of the spinal cord. The toxins prevent
the inhibition or remove the nerve impulse after
crossing
the
synaptic
junctions.
The
nerve
continues to send impulses resulting in spasmodic
contractions or tetani of the affected muscles.
Muscle stiffness is the early symptom, with jaw
muscles often developing symptoms ﬁrst. This
condition is called lockjaw; with the progression
of the disease, spasm develops in other muscles.
The spasm, although brief, occurs frequently and
causes immense pain and exhaustion. This condi-
tion is called local tetanus. The subsequent spread
of the toxin up the spinal cord causes ascending
tetanus. The opposite hind limb, trunk and
forelimbs are involved in this condition.
Intravenous injection of the toxin causes
descending tetanus. In this condition, spasticity
develops ﬁrst in the head and neck muscles, and
then spreads downwards, which resembles natu-
rally occurring tetanus in humans.
Tetanolysin
It is oxygen- and heat-labile haemolysin. It is
antigenically
related
to
other
clostridial
haemolysins and streptolysin O. The toxin is of
doubtful pathogenicity and appears not to play
any role in the pathogenesis of tetanus.
Neurotoxin
It is the third toxin recently identiﬁed. It is a
non-spasmogenic and peripherally active neuro-
toxin. The role of this toxin in the pathogenesis of
tetanus is not understood.
Pathogenesis of Tetanus
Tetanus is a toxin-mediated disease. C. tetani
spores are the infective form of the bacteria.
Soil, animal faeces and, occasionally, human

faeces and inanimate objects contaminated with
spores are the primary sources of infection.
478
33
Clostridium
Tetanus is caused by the entry of the C. tetani
spores. Under anaerobic conditions, the spores
germinate to vegetative form and subsequently
produce
toxins,
such
as tetanospasmin and
tetanolysin. The conditions favouring anaerobio-
sis in tissues include wounds with low oxidation-
reduction potential, such as those with (1) dead
devitalised tissue, (2) a foreign body, or (3) active
infection.
On release from the bacillus, tetanospasmin is
absorbed in the peripheral nervous system and at
the myoneural junction. It is then transferred cen-
tripetally into the neurons of the CNS. An endog-
enous protease splits the toxins into two chains: a
light chain of 52,000 MW protein and a heavy
chain of 93,000 MW protein. The toxin’s heavy
chain (100 kDa) is responsible for speciﬁc bind-
ing to neural cells and protein transport. The light
chain blocks the release of two major inhibitory
neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine.
This, in turn, stops the inhibition of motor reﬂex
responses to sensory stimulation. This results in a
sustained muscle contraction characteristic of a
tetanic spasm. The peripheral nerves transmit
toxin quickly to the CNS, which leads to early
symptoms of facial distortion, back and neck
stiffness and characteristic Trismus or lockjaw.
Clinical Syndromes
Tetanus caused by C. tetani is a disease found
worldwide.
Tetanus
The incubation period of tetanus is variable,
ranging from a few days to several weeks, but
commonly 6–12 days. The duration of the incu-
bation period depends on (1) distance of primary
wound
infection
from
the
CNS,
(2)
the
inoculating dosage of bacteria, (3) toxigenicity
of bacteria, and (4) immune status of the host.
Trismus or lockjaw is the most common and
early
sign
of
the
disease.
Difﬁculty
in
swallowing, irritability and restlessness are the
other early signs. As the condition progresses,
patients have generalised muscle rigidity with
intermittent reﬂex spasms in response to stimuli
such as noise or touch. Tonic contractions cause
opisthotonus, a condition in which the head,
neck and spinal cord are arched backwards. Dur-
ing these periods, the patients will have severe
pain. The spasms can cause acute respiratory
failure, fractures and tendon ruptures. Risus
sardonicus or characteristic sardonic smile is a
typical feature due to the continued contraction of
facial muscles. The condition may progress for
2 weeks even with the administration of the anti-
toxin because of the time needed for intraaxonal
antitoxin transport.
Tetanus with a short incubation period is
graver than tetanus with a long incubation period.
Recovery is slow and usually takes as long as
2–4 months.
Neonatal Tetanus
Neonatal tetanus results from the infection of a
neonate. The infection reported earlier occurs due
to use of a contaminated blade, knife or other
materials to cut or dress the umbilical cord in
newborns, particularly of unimmunised mothers.
The condition had a very poor prognosis. The
condition has been reduced drastically due to the
universal immunisation of infants and pregnant
mothers.
Localised Tetanus
Localised tetanus is an unusual form of tetanus.
The disease is conﬁned to the extremity with a
contaminated wound and occurs when only the
nerves
supplying
the
affected
muscle
are
involved. The condition is characterised by rigid-
ity of muscles, caused due to a dysfunction in the
interneurons that inhibit the alpha-motor neurons
of the affected muscles. In localised tetanus, there
is no involvement of the CNS. The mortality rates
are also very low.
Cephalic Tetanus
Cephalic tetanus is a variation of localised teta-
nus. The condition usually occurs following a
head injury or an infection of the middle ear.


The incubation period is very short (1–2 days)
and has a poor prognosis.
Clostridium tetani
479
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is carried out in the patients
only to conﬁrm the clinical diagnosis.
Specimens
The specimens include excised bits of tissue from
the necrotic depths of wounds. Swabs from the
wounds are not good specimens.
Microscopy
Gram staining of smears for C. tetani is fre-
quently unsuccessful and also unreliable. Demon-
stration of typical drumstick bacilli in wound
tissue (Fig. 33.5) is not diagnostic of tetanus.
This is because C. tetani may be present in
some wounds without causing tetanus. Further-
more, it may not be possible to distinguish by
microscopy C. tetani from C. tetanomorphum
and Clostridium sphenoides.
Culture and Identification
The specimens are inoculated on blood agar and
incubated anaerobically for 24–48 h. C. tetani
produces
alpha-haemolysis
surrounding
the
colonies. On prolonged incubation, the alpha-
haemolysis becomes beta-haemolytic due to the
production of tetanolysin, a haemolysin produced
by the bacteria. Surface colonies tend to swarm
over the entire surface of the agar. C. tetani
produces an extremely ﬁne translucent ﬁlm of
growth, which is difﬁcult to visualise except at the
edges of the colonies. C. tetani produces swarming
growth, which spreads throughout the plate.
Fig. 33.5 Gram-stained
smear showing drumstick
appearance of Clostridium
tetani ( 1000)
The specimens are also inoculated to a set of
three tubes of RCM media. One of these is
heated at 80 C for 15 min, the second for 5 min
and the third is left unheated, and all three are
incubated at 37 C for 24–48 h. The bacteria
produce turbidity with the production of some
gas in the medium. Although it is not digested,
the meat turns black on prolonged incubation.
Subsequently, the sub-culture is made daily on
blood agar for up to 4 days. From the swarming
edges of the colonies on blood agar, C. tetani is
isolated in pure culture.
Culture is positive in only 30% of cases of
tetanus. This is because tetanus is caused only
by a few organisms, and many organisms are
killed when exposed to air during the processing
of specimens.

480
33
Clostridium
Fildes technique is employed as a routine
method for isolating pure colonies of C. tetani.
In the method, a mixed bacterial culture is
inoculated into condensation water at the bottom
of the slope of nutrient agar. A pure colony of
C. tetani appears at the top of the slope in the
tube, followed by anaerobic incubation for 24 h.
C. tetani liqueﬁes gelatine
anaerobically.
Hence, the bacillus produces a ﬁr-tree type of
growth in gelatine stab culture under anaerobic
incubation.
C. tetani produces an extremely ﬁne translu-
cent ﬁlm of growth on the blood agar, which
tends to swarm over the entire surface of the
agar.
It
produces
alpha-haemolytic
colonies
initially on blood agar, which on prolonged incu-
bation become beta-haemolytic due to the pro-
duction of tetanolysin. Gram-stained smear of
the colony reveals Gram-positive bacilli with
prominent terminal spores (drumstick appear-
ance). The motile (except type VI) and capsulated
bacteria do not ferment any sugar. Toxigenicity
testing in mice is a reliable method of identifying
the colony as C. tetani.
Toxigenicity Testing
The tests are useful to demonstrate the identiﬁca-
tion of the colony as C. tetani.
In-vitro Neutralisation Test
It is carried out on blood agar. The test is
performed on a blood agar containing 4% agar.
A high percentage of agar is used to inhibit
swarming by C. tetani. Strains of C. tetani are
stab-inoculated on each half of the plate with and
without antitoxins. The colonies of C. tetani show
haemolysis on the part of the blood agar without
any antitoxin but do not show any haemolysis on
the part of the agar with tetanus antitoxins
(1500 units per millilitre). This is due to the
inhibition of the haemolytic activity of the toxin
by the antitoxin present in the agar.
In-vitro Neutralisation Test
The test is carried out in mice. In this test, 0.2 mL
of a 2–4 day old cooked meat culture of C. tetani
is inoculated into the root of the tail of two mice,
one of which is protected with 1000 units of
tetanus antitoxin 1 h before the test (control ani-
mal). The other mouse is not protected with any
antitoxin (test animal). Symptoms of ascending
tetanus
due
to
tetanospasmin
produced
by
C. tetani develop in the test animal 12–24 h
after inoculation of the bacteria. The symptoms
begin in mice with stiffness in the tail, which
proceed rapidly to the leg on the inoculated side,
the opposite leg, trunk and forelimbs, in that
order. The animal usually dies within 48 h. No
symptoms appear in the inoculated control ani-
mal. It is a reliable method of identiﬁcation of the
colony as C. tetani.
Other Tests
The spatula test is a clinical test which is a
simple bedside diagnostic test for tetanus. In this
test, the oropharynx is touched with a spatula.
The positive test result is that the patient develops
a reﬂex spasm and bites the spatula. The negative
result is that the patient would develop a gag
reﬂex and try to expel the spatula; the test is
100% speciﬁc.
Treatment
Treatment of tetanus depends on the nature of the
wound and the immune status of the infected host.
Antibiotics Therapy
Antibiotics are used to prevent the multiplication
of C. tetani in the wound, thus halting the produc-
tion and release of toxins. In a dosage of 5000 mg
every 6 h, metronidazole is the current antimicro-
bial drug of choice. Penicillin given on a dosage
of 100,000–2000,000 IU/Khg, injected intrave-
nously, in 2 to 4 divided dosages is an alternative
treatment. Tetracycline is an alternative drug for
patients allergic to penicillin or metronidazole.
Clindamycin, erythromycin and vancomycin are
the other antimicrobials used to treat tetanus.
Human Immunoglobulin Therapy
Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is given to
neutralise unbound tetanus toxins and prevent the
circulating tetanus toxin from reaching the CNS.
A single total dose of 3000–6000 IU is given

intramuscularly for children and adults immedi-
ately at diagnosis. A lower dose of 500 IU for
infants with tetanus neonatorum has been effec-
tive. In countries where TIG is not available,
equine tetanus antitoxin (ATS) is used for the
purpose.
Usually,
a
single
dose
(50,000–100,000 IU) of tetanus antitoxin is
administered intramuscularly after testing for sen-
sitivity and desensitisation. A part of this dose
(20,000 IU) is given intravenously.
Clostridium tetani
481
Surgical Management
A dirty wound contaminated with soil, debris,
faeces and so on could introduce the organism.
Wounds containing devitalised tissue are fertile
grounds for the multiplication of the tetanus
bacilli. All wounds should be cleaned, and if
needed, devitalised and necrotic tissues should
be surgically debrided.
Supportive Management
Sedation and control of muscle spasms form the
mainstay of supportive management in the case of
tetanus. Benzodiazepines or opioids like mor-
phine are used as sedatives, which are also helpful
in muscle relaxation. Autonomic dysfunction is
an important complication that can be tackled
with ﬂuid loading. Magnesium sulphate is a use-
ful addition in relaxation, sedation and controlling
the autonomic disturbance in tetanus.
Epidemiology
Tetanus is common in areas where the soil is
cultivated, in rural areas, in warm and damp
climates and during summer months.
Geographical Distribution
The condition is predominantly a disease of the
underdeveloped countries. Tetanus affects all age
groups, with the highest prevalence among
newborns and young people. Overall, the annual
incidence of tetanus is 0.5–1 million cases,
mostly in underdeveloped countries. Neonatal
tetanus accounts for 50% of tetanus-related deaths
in developing countries.
Habitat
C. tetani organisms are found in soil, animal
faeces, and, occasionally, human faeces and inan-
imate objects. The spores may survive for years in
some
environments
and
are
resistant
to
disinfectants and even to boiling for 20 min.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
C. tetani spores are the infective form of the
bacteria. Soil, animal faeces and, occasionally,
human
faeces
and
inanimate
objects
contaminated with spores are the primary sources
of infection. Risk factors for neonatal tetanus
include unvaccinated mothers, homebirth and
unhygienic cutting of the umbilical cord. Animal
dung, clariﬁed butter and so on applied to the
umbilical stump are the other risk factors for
neonates. The grossly contaminated wounds;
wounds exposed to saliva or faeces; stellate,
ischemic or infected wounds; deep (>1 cm)
wounds; as well as avulsions, punctures or crush
injuries are more susceptible to tetanus.
Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus
Maternal and neonatal tetanus are among the
most common life-threatening consequences of
unhygienic practices in deliveries and care of the
umbilical cord. It is rare in countries with well-
developed health infrastructure where tetanus
vaccination is routinely given as ante-natal care.
Neonatal tetanus has a very high mortality, which
manifests within a week after birth with fever,
vomiting and seizures. Maternal vaccination
helps prevent neonatal tetanus as well. The
WHO estimates that in 2018, 25,000 newborns
died from tetanus, which is an 88% reduction
from the 2000 ﬁgure of 200,000. This has been
achieved by The Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus
Elimination (MNTE) initiative of the WHO.
Prevention and Control
Active Immunisation
The prevalence of protective immunity to tetanus
is greater in children and persons aged between

6 and 39 years. Protective immunity from tetanus
decreases in older people. Serological immunity
studies have shown a low level among elderly
individuals in many countries. Clinical tetanus
does not produce a state of immunity; hence,
patients who survive the disease require active
immunisation with tetanus toxoid to prevent a
recurrence of the disease.
482
33
Clostridium
Tetanus is completely preventable by active
immunisation. Active immunisation by vaccina-
tion with tetanus toxoid is the key to preventing
tetanus. Vaccination is carried out by toxoids,
available either as plain toxoids or adsorbed on
aluminium hydroxide or phosphate. The toxoid is
given alone or in combination with diphtheria
toxoid and acellular pertussis (whooping cough)
(DTaP or triple) vaccine.
Vaccine
The
tetanus
toxoid
and
the
triple
vaccine
containing tetanus toxoid are very safe and effec-
tive. The toxoid stimulates the production of pro-
tective
antibody
response
in
virtually
all
immunocompetent subjects. Speciﬁc antibodies
produced against the tetanus toxin are protective.
Antibodies speciﬁcally combine with free toxins
and prevent the action of the toxin. Many studies
have shown protective serum antibody levels in
up to 90% of immunised people 15 years after
vaccination.
Primary prevention of tetanus is achieved by
vaccination with the triple vaccine at ages 2, 4,
6 and 12–18 months and 4–6 years. A tetanus-
diphtheria (Td) booster dose is administered at
11–12 years and then every 10 years. For the
primary immunisation of unimmunised children
7 years or older, the tetanus toxoid vaccine is
administered in two doses 4–6 weeks and the
third dose at 6–12 months. Usually, booster
doses are administered at 10 years once or at the
time of major injury if it occurs after 5 years after
a dose.
Vaccination
with
tetanus
toxoid
is
recommended for (1) all adults who have not
had a booster dose in the last 10 years. It has
been demonstrated that approximately 50% of
persons older than 50 years are non-immune
because they were never vaccinated or did not
receive appropriate booster doses; (2) adults
who have recovered from tetanus; and (3) adults
who have never received immunisation against
tetanus.
Immunisation for Prevention of Neonatal
Tetanus
Neonatal tetanus is prevented by increasing
immunisation in women of childbearing age,
especially pregnant women and by improving
maternity care. For previously unimmunised
pregnant women, tetanus toxoid is given twice
during pregnancy, 4–6 weeks apart, preferably
in the last two trimesters and again at least
4 weeks before delivery. Maternal antitetanic
antibodies are passed to the foetus, and this pas-
sive immunity is effective for many months after
the child’s birth.
Passive Immunisation
Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is used for
passive immunisation. In countries where TIG is
not available, ATS is also used for the purpose.
Passive immunisation is carried out by intramus-
cular administration of 250–500 IU of TIG or by
subcutaneous
or
intramuscular
injections
of
1500 units of ATS after giving a skin test dose.
Passive
immunisation
is
recommended
for
(1) non-immunised individuals, and (2) those
whose immunisation status is uncertain whenever
a wound is contaminated or likely to have
devitalised tissue.
Combined Immunisation
Secondary prevention of tetanus is achieved post-
exposure through appropriate wound cleansing
and debridement, and combined immunisation.
Combined immunisation is carried out by simul-
taneously administering (1) human TIG or the
ATS, and (2) tetanus toxoid. It is indicated if the
patient has not been previously immunised with a
series of at least three doses of toxoid.

Clostridium botulinum
C. botulinum causes botulism, a paralytic disease
with the presentation of food poisoning.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C. botulinum is a heterogeneous group of spore-
forming, anaerobic and Gram-positive bacteria. It
is Gram-positive in young cultures less than 18 h
old. The organism may be Gram-negative in
cultures after 18 h of incubation. The bacillus
measures 5  1 μm. It is motile by the presence
of
peritrichous
ﬂagella
and
possesses
sub-terminal and oval bulging spores. It is
non-capsulated.
Culture and Biochemical Reactions
C. botulinum is a strict anaerobe. The bacteria
can grow on a wide range of media, including
blood agar, Mueller–Hinton agar and RCM
media. On blood agar, C. botulinum produces
large, irregular and semi-transparent colonies
with irregular ﬁmbriate borders. They produce
spores when grown in alkaline glucose gelatine
media at 20–25 C. Production of enzyme lipase
is demonstrated by forming an iridescent ﬁlm on
C. botulinum colonies grown on egg yolk agar.
In Robertson’s cooked meat broth medium,
C. botulinum grows luxuriantly with marked tur-
bidity and two distinct features. Serotypes A, B
and F are proteolytic, which turns the meat
particles black with a foul smell, while the
saccharolytic C, D and E serotypes cause pink
discolouration of the meat particles.
C. botulinum is identiﬁed by its ability to fer-
ment glucose, hydrolyse gelatine, digest protein
and produce the enzyme lipase. Production of
enzyme lipase is demonstrated by forming an
iridescent ﬁlm on C. botulinum colonies grown
on egg yolk agar.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Both bacteria and spores are highly resistant.
They are resistant to boiling at 100 C for several
hours; They are killed by pressure cooking at
120 C for 10 min, C. botulinum types B, E and
F spores are relatively less heat resistant. The
toxins are destroyed by boiling for 10 min or
cooking at 80 C for 30 min.

484
33
Clostridium
Typing
C. botulinum is a heterogeneous group of spore-
forming, anaerobic and Gram-positive anaerobes.
They are classiﬁed into eight antigenically dis-
tinct botulinum toxins (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F
and
G)
depending
on
the
immunological
differences in the toxins. These different toxins
appear identical in their biological functions but
differ immunologically. The toxins are speciﬁ-
cally neutralised only by their homologous anti-
serum. A single strain of bacteria produces only
one toxin. In rare instances, a single strain may
produce more than one toxin. All toxins except
C2 are neurotoxins.
Pathogenesis
C. botulinum organisms are non-invasive. They
cause disease primarily by the production of an
exotoxin, the botulinum toxin, which is the
major virulence factor of the bacteria.
Virulence Factors
Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin, is a protein with
an MW of 70,000 Da. The toxin is relatively heat
stable. It is inactivated at 80 C for 30–40 min and
at 100 C for 10 min. The toxin is similar in
structure and function to the tetanus toxin, except
only in the site of action.
The neurotoxin acts speciﬁcally on cholin-
ergic nerves. It acts by preventing the release of a
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, at the synapses
and the neuromuscular junctions. It causes atro-
phy of the muscles at the site of the infection, but
the neurons regenerate in 2–4 months of recovery.
Toxins A and B are the most potent toxins. The
production of toxins by C. perfringens types C
and D appears to be mediated by bacteriophages.
The
botulinum
toxin
differs
from
other
exotoxins in that it is produced only on death
and autolysis of the bacteria, but not when the
bacilli are alive. It is a progenitor protein
synthesised intracellularly in the bacteria. It
consists of two subunits, A and B. Sub-unit A
is the light chain and is a neurotoxin. Sub-unit B
is a heavy chain, which prevents the neurotoxin
part (chain A) from being inactivated by the
stomach’s acidity. More than three B sub-units
may be present in the toxin.
The botulinum toxin is the most potent natu-
rally occurring toxin known to humankind. The
lethal dose for mice is 0.000,000,033 mg and for
human beings is 1–2 g. It is lethal at femtomolar
level doses of 1012 g/kg, making botulinum
toxin 15,000–100,000 times more potent than
sarin gas. The toxin can also be toxoided.
Pathogenesis of Botulism
Food-Borne Botulism
The condition occurs on ingestion of preformed
toxins in food contaminated with C. botulinum.
When food is contaminated with small amounts
of toxins and consumed, it results in full-blown
disease. Toxin A has been the most frequent
cause of food-borne outbreaks in the past
20 years. After toxin A, toxins B and E follow
in frequency. The toxins are absorbed from the
stomach and small intestine, as digestive enzymes
do not denature them. The toxin enters the vascu-
lar system and is transported to peripheral cholin-
ergic nerve terminals, such as neuromuscular
junctions,
cholinergic
parasympathetic
nerve
endings and peripheral ganglia. They bind to
receptor
sites
on
pre-synaptic
motor
nerve
terminals and cause blockade of neuromuscular
conduction. They then enter the nerve terminal
and inhibit acetylcholine’s release and transmis-
sion in cholinergic nerve ﬁbres. The toxin irre-
versibly binds to the neurons.
Infant Botulism
It occurs following the ingestion of C. botulinum
spores present in infant food such as honey. It is
caused by neurotoxins produced in the intestine,
in Vivo, by C. botulinum that has colonised the
gastrointestinal tract of infants. The spores then
germinate to toxin-producing vegetative forms
that colonise the infant’s gut. The toxin produced
in and absorbed from the gut causes the clinical
disease.
Wound Botulism
The condition occurs due to the contamination of
the wound with spore-forming C. botulinum. The

condition occurs (1) in people with a traumatic
injury involving contamination with soil or water
containing C. botulinum spores (2) in people who
chronically abuse intravenous drugs (e.g. black
tar heroin) and (3) in women after caesarean
delivery (very rare). The condition can also
occur even after antibiotics are administered to
prevent wound infection.
Clostridium botulinum
485
Clinical Syndromes
Botulism
is
the
major
disease
caused
by
C. botulinum.
Botulism
The condition may manifest as foodborne botu-
lism, infant botulism or wound botulism.
Food-borne Botulism
The condition manifests from a mild to a very
serious disease resulting in death within 24 h. The
incubation period is short and varies from 12 to
36 h after ingestion of the contaminated food. The
initial signs are vomiting, nausea, dry mouth,
constipation, abdominal pain and blurred vision
with ﬁxed dilated pupils. The disease progresses
to a bilateral descending weakness of the periph-
eral muscles, leading to ﬂaccid paralysis. Fever
typically is absent. Death is due to respiratory
paralysis and occurs in 1–7 days after the onset
of the disease.
Infant Botulism
Symptoms
at
the
early
stages
are
usually
non-speciﬁc. These include constipation, leth-
argy, weakness, weak and altered cry, loss of
head control. The condition may progress to ﬂac-
cid paralysis and respiratory arrest. The infants
excrete toxins in their faeces. Infant mortality due
to infant botulism is relatively low (11–20%).
Wound Botulism
It occurs following heavy contamination of
wounds
with
soil
or
water
containing
C. botulinum spores. The incubation period is
4–14 days with a mean of 10 days. Wound botu-
lism is similar to food-borne botulism except that
the incubation period is longer and no gastroin-
testinal symptoms are present.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Botulism can be diagnosed only by a high degree
of clinical suspicion. The diagnosis is suspected
in an afebrile patient with progressive descending
paralysis, especially in the presence of gastroin-
testinal manifestations. Laboratory diagnosis of
the condition rests on the demonstration of
C. botulinum bacilli or toxins.
Specimens
Faeces, vomitus or gastric aspirate are collected
for all forms of botulism. In addition, tissue from
the wound is collected for wound botulism.
Microscopy
Gram staining of the smears made from food,
faeces and other specimens may show Gram-
positive spore-bearing C. botulinum.
Culture and Identification
Foodborne
botulism
is
diagnosed
by
demonstrating C. botulinum in food by culture
and by demonstrating toxins in food or faeces.
C. botulinum may be isolated from suspected
contaminated food and the faeces by culture.
Food culture is performed ﬁrst by heating the
specimens at 80 C for 10 min. This is done to
destroy all the vegetative forms of the bacteria.
The heated specimens are then cultured on RCM
media and incubated in anaerobic conditions,
followed by a sub-culture on blood agar. Anaero-
bic incubation facilitates germination of the
spores to vegetative forms of the bacteria. Dem-
onstration of C. botulinum in faeces, vomitus or
gastric aspirate by culture is highly suggestive of
food-borne botulism because the intestinal car-
riage is rare. Culture is positive in approximately
60% of cases. The toxin can also be demonstrated
in
food
or
faeces
to
diagnose
food-borne
botulism.
Demonstrations of C. botulinum in pus culture
and detection of botulinum in wound pus and
exudates
are
highly

Clostridium
C. botulinum produces large, irregular and
semi-transparent colonies with an irregular ﬁm-
briate border on blood agar. The colony smear
reveals Gram-positive bacilli with sub-terminal
and oval bulging spores in the Gram-stained
smear of the colony. The bacteria are motile and
capsulated, ferments glucose, hydrolyses gela-
tine, digests protein and produces enzyme lipase.
Demonstration of Toxin
C. botulinum toxin can also be demonstrated in
food or faeces to diagnose food-borne botulism,
the faeces for infant botulisms and the wound pus
for infant botulism. Toxins in these specimens
can be detected using serum toxin bioassay,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and poly-
merase chain reaction.
The toxin is demonstrated in food or faeces by
serum toxin bioassay, a neutralisation test car-
ried out in mice. In this method, food ﬁltrate in
sterile saline is inoculated intraperitoneally into
two mice. One mouse is protected with polyvalent
botulinum antitoxin (control animal), and another
is not protected by any antitoxin (test animal). If
the test animal dies but the control animal remains
healthy, the test is considered positive and
suggests the presence of toxin in the specimen.
This is a useful test to demonstrate toxins during
the early stages of food botulism.
In recent years, toxin detection by the ELISA
method has become popular since mouse bioas-
say is technically demanding and not routinely
available. The organism is ﬁrst grown in a liquid
culture medium for 5 days, and the A, B, E and F
botulinum toxin-producing organisms and their
toxins can be detected by ampliﬁed ELISA,
which has a sensitivity of detecting about
10 MLD/mL (0.12–0.25 ng/mL) of the toxin.
Digoxigenin-labelled antitoxin ELISA, a modiﬁ-
cation of the ampliﬁed ELISA, has a similar
detection limit.
Molecular Detection of Toxin Genes
PCR has been developed to detect the genes
encoding for the toxin types A, B, E and F,
which are neurotoxins. The organism is ﬁrst
grown for 24 h in a culture medium before testing.
Multiple botulinum toxin-producing types can
also be detected within a single PCR assay. The
PCR method can also be used along with the
mouse
bioassay
to
determine
the
speciﬁc
toxin type.
Treatment
Treatment of botulism involves initial supportive
therapy, neutralising unbound toxin by speciﬁc
antitoxins and stopping toxin production using
antibiotics. Patients with botulism should be
monitored closely for neurologic, respiratory
and autonomic manifestations. Intubation and
mechanical ventilation may be necessary in
almost half of the admitted patients. Antibiotics
are not required except in the case of wound
botulism.
Antitoxin Therapy
This consists of a trivalent A-B-E botulinum anti-
toxin serum used for the speciﬁc treatment of
botulism. The sera contain antibodies against
C. botulinum types A, B and E; these act by
binding and neutralising the toxins present in the
serum. Symptomatic patients with high clinical
suspicion of foodborne botulism and wound bot-
ulism are administered with the trivalent botuli-
num antitoxin. The antitoxin can be given even
after several weeks of toxin ingestion. This anti-
toxin can slow down disease progression.
Antibiotics Therapy
This is carried out to prevent the multiplication of
C. botulinum in the gastrointestinal tract and the
wound, thereby preventing the production and
release of toxins. Metronidazole is the current
antimicrobial drug of choice, with penicillin as
an alternative treatment.
Epidemiology
Human botulism is found worldwide.

Clostridium difficile
487
Geographical Distribution
C. botulinum types A, B, E and rarely F and G
toxins cause human disease. Types C and D cause
avian and non-human mammalian disease. Infant
botulism is more common than food-borne botu-
lism.
Food-borne
botulism
is
caused
by
C. botulinum types A, B and F, and very rarely
E types. Wound botulism is very rare and is
caused by C. botulinum type A strains.
Habitat
C. botulinum is ubiquitous. It is found in the soil
and water worldwide. Spores of C. botulinum
type A or B are distributed widely in the soil
and have been found throughout the world.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
C. botulinum spores are responsible for causing
botulism. Preserved food, especially homemade,
canned meat and meat products in Europe,
canned vegetables in America and preserved ﬁsh
in Japan, contaminated with the preformed toxin,
are the main sources of infections for foodborne
botulism. Honey and other food contaminated
with spores of bacteria are the sources of infection
for infant botulism. Soil and water heavily
contaminated with spores are sources of infection
for wound botulism.
Wound botulism occurs (1) in people with a
traumatic injury involving contamination with
soil, (2) in people who chronically abuse intrave-
nous drugs (e.g. black tar heroin) and (3) in
women after caesarean delivery (very rare). The
condition can also occur even after antibiotics are
administered to prevent wound infection.
Food-borne botulism occurs when food is
contaminated with small amounts of toxins and
consumed, resulting in full-blown disease. Toxin
A has been found to be the most frequent cause of
food-borne outbreaks in the past 20 years. After
toxin A, toxins B and E follow in frequency.
High-risk foods include home-canned or home-
processed low-acid fruits and vegetables; ﬁsh
and ﬁsh products; and condiments, such as relish
and chilli peppers. Commercially prepared foods
and improperly handled fresh foods may occa-
sionally cause botulism outbreaks.
Infant botulism occurs following the ingestion
of C. botulinum spores in infant food such as
honey. The spores then germinate to a toxin-
producing vegetative form that colonises the
infant’s gut. The toxin that is produced in and
absorbed from the gut causes the clinical disease.
Prevention and Control
Food-borne botulism is best prevented by high-
temperature pressure cooking, which kills the
spores present in fruits and vegetables. Storing
the food in the refrigerator at 4 C or an acidic
pH prevents germination of spores, if present, to
vegetative bacterial form. Infant botulism is
prevented by avoiding the administration of
honey to infants. Wound botulism is prevented
by immediate and thorough debridement of
contaminated wounds.
Clostridium difficile
C. difﬁcile was ﬁrst described in 1935 from the
faeces of healthy newborns and was initially not
thought to be a pathogen. It was named difﬁcile
because it grows slowly and is difﬁcult to culture.
It is a long slender Gram-positive, anaerobic
bacillus bearing large, oval and terminal spores.
It is non-haemolytic, saccharolytic and mild
proteolytic.
C. difﬁcile is the causative agent of antibiotic-
associated diarrhoea and colitis. It produces two
antigenically distinct toxins: toxin A and toxin
B. Toxin A is an enterotoxin, and toxin B is a
cytotoxin. Both the toxins contribute to the path-
ogenesis of C. difﬁcile colitis and diarrhoea in
humans. Both are proteins that bind to speciﬁc
receptors present in the intestine’s mucosa.
Antibiotic therapy is the key factor that alters
the normal bacterial ﬂora of the intestine. The
use of antibiotics suppresses the normal ﬂora of
the intestine. It also facilitates the colonisation
and multiplication of C. difﬁcile and the produc-
tion of toxins that cause inﬂammation of the
mucosa and damage. C. difﬁcile causes malaise,
anorexia
and
mild-to-moderate
diarrhoea.

Diarrhoea develops in most patients during or
shortly after starting antibiotics. It is associated
with the formation of pseudo-membranes and,
occasionally, adherent yellowish-white plaques
on the intestinal mucosa.
488
33
Clostridium
C. difﬁcile infection is more common in old
people. This may be due to the increasing suscep-
tibility of mucosal ﬂora to colonisation by the
bacteria and disease. The infection is uncommon
in infants and young children, although they fre-
quently harbour the bacteria and its toxins.
Any patient with diarrhoea who took antibiotic
treatment during the past 2 months or diarrhoea
occurring 3 days after hospitalisation would be
suspected of C. difﬁcile colitis. Diagnosis of
C. difﬁcile diarrhoea is made by the demonstra-
tion of C. difﬁcile toxin in the faeces by stool
cytotoxin test and by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay:
The stool cytotoxin test is the test of choice.
The
diarrhoeal
stool
is
ﬁltered
and
then
inoculated to Hep-2 and human diploid cell
cultures in this test. The demonstration of a cyto-
pathic effect that is neutralised by a speciﬁc
antiserum indicates the presence of the toxin
(positive test). The absence of cytopathic effect
is considered a negative test.
Several enzyme immunoassays are now com-
mercially available for rapid detection of the toxin
and diagnosis. The latex agglutination test has
been employed to detect the presence of gluta-
mate dehydrogenase, produced by C. difﬁcile, for
diagnosing C. difﬁcile diarrhoea. PCR and lateral
ﬂow assay have been used to detect C. difﬁcile
toxins A and B in stool samples. Stool cultures
are not useful because of the presence of
non-toxigenic strains of C. difﬁcile in faeces.
No treatment is necessary for asymptomatic
carriers.
Stoppage
of
the
use
of
causative
antibiotics may be the only treatment necessary
for those with mild antibiotic-associated diar-
rhoea
without
fever,
abdominal
pain
or
leucocytosis. Patients with more severe diarrhoea
or colitis require treatment with antibiotics. Met-
ronidazole is the drug of choice. Vancomycin and
bacitracin are also effective.
Case Study
An 18-year-old college student came to a hospital
with a complaint of facial spasms. He was unable
to eat for 2 days due to severe pain in his jaw.
Examination
revealed
trismus
and
rises
sardonicus. The student gave a history of playing
football for his college team, during which he had
sustained a minor knee injury with abrasions
6 days earlier. He did not visit any doctor earlier
or receive any toxoid for the injury. He did not
remember receiving any booster vaccination with
tetanus toxoid in the last many years. A clinical
diagnosis of tetanus was made.

Non-Sporing Anaerobes
34
The anaerobic cocci are a heterologous group of
bacteria that typically colonise the skin and the
mucous membranes. The taxonomical classiﬁca-
tion
of
these
cocci
has undergone
several
modiﬁcations, and importantly, the classiﬁcation
has
been
simpliﬁed
now.
The
non-sporing
anaerobes are divided into anaerobic cocci and
anaerobic bacilli.
Classification
There are numerous anaerobic bacteria present in
nature, but few are medically important. Based on
the DNA base arrangement and investigation of
fatty acid end products of metabolism, medically
signiﬁcant anaerobic bacteria may be categorised
under three broad groups (Table 34.1).
Anaerobic Cocci
Anaerobic Gram-Positive Cocci
Most of the important anaerobic Gram-positive
cocci belong to the genus Peptostreptococcus.
The cocci are small and measure 0.2–2.5 μm.
Many of them are aerotolerant and grow well in
air supplemented with 10% CO. These Gram-
positive cocci are normal inhabitants of the oral
cavity, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract
and skin. These bacteria, on spreading from
these sites to other normally sterile sites, may
cause
several
clinical
infections:
Bacteria
colonising the skin can cause cellulitis and
infections of the soft tissue, and bacteria in the
intestine can cause intraabdominal infection. Bac-
teria in the genital tract can cause pelvis abscess,
salpingitis and endometritis, and those invading
the bloodstream can cause infections in bones and
visceral organs.

489
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius is most com-
monly associated with puerperal sepsis and
Peptostreptococcus magnus with abscess. The
laboratory diagnosis of the infection caused by
these cocci depends on the isolation of the bacte-
ria by culture. The cocci are often found in large
numbers in pus from suppurative lesions; hence
Gram staining of pus smears is frequently helpful
in diagnosis.
The cocci are generally sensitive to imipenem
chloramphenicol and metronidazole. They are
intermediately
sensitive
to
broad-spectrum
cephalosporins, tetracyclines and clindamycin.
They are resistant to streptomycin and gentami-
cin. Most infections are mixed, the cocci being
present along with anaerobic Gram-negative
bacilli and clostridia. Hence, broad-spectrum
antibiotics effective against all these pathogens
are usually given for treatment.
Anaerobic Gram-Negative Cocci
The genus Veillonella spp. includes anaerobic
Gram-negative cocci of varying sizes occurring
in pairs, short chains or clusters. These cocci
normally colonise the mouth, intestines and

the genitourinary tract. Veillonella parvula is fre-
quently reported from clinical specimens, but its
role in the causation of the disease is unknown.
490
34
Non-Sporing Anaerobes
Anaerobic Bacilli
Anaerobic Gram-Positive Bacilli
The group includes many genera, but a few of
these are associated with clinical infections
(Table 34.2). Propionibacterium spp., Lactoba-
cillus spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Actinomyces
spp. are well known to cause human infections.
Eubacterium spp. and Biﬁdobacterium spp. are
isolated in clinical specimens; they rarely cause
human disease.
Propionibacterium
Propionibacterium
species
are
anaerobic
or
aerotolerant bacteria found as part of the normal
ﬂora of the skin, oropharynx, conjunctiva, exter-
nal ear and female genital tract. They ferment
carbohydrates with the production of propionic
acid, hence named Propionibacterium. They are
Gram-positive bacilli that are frequently present
in short chains and clumps. They are non-motile
and are catalase positive. Propionibacterium is
not fastidious. They can grow on nutrient agar
or other simple media. However, they grow
slowly and take 3–5 days to produce colonies.
Propionibacterium
acnes
and
Propioni-
bacterium propionicus are two important species
of clinical importance. In teenagers and young
adults, P. acnes is the most common causative
agent of acne. The lesions in acne develop within
the sebaceous follicles and hence are not related
to the effectiveness of the cleanliness of the skin.
The condition is treated best with topical applica-
tion of benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics. The
bacteria
are
sensitive
to
erythromycin
and
clindamycin.
Lactobacillus
Members of the genus Lactobacillus are faculta-
tively anaerobic bacilli. They are commonly
found in the mouth, stomach, intestine and adult
vagina. They are commonly isolated in blood
and urine cultures. The presence of lactobacilli
even in high numbers in urine culture usually
represents contamination of bacteria from the
urethra, in which lactobacillus are most com-
monly present. Lactobacilli usually do not cause
infection of the urinary tract because they fail to
grow in the urine.
Lactobacilli can invade the bloodstream dur-
ing (1) endocarditis, (2) opportunistic septicaemia
in the immunocompromised host, and (3) transient
bacteraemia following genitourinary procedure.
A
combined
therapy
with
penicillin
and
aminoglycoside has proved effective against
infections caused by lactobacilli. Lactobacilli are
resistant to vancomycin.
Mobiluncus
The Mobiluncus species are obligate anaerobes.
They are found as part of the normal ﬂora of
the genitourinary tract. In women with bacterial
vaginitis, they are found in very high numbers.
The exact role of the bacteria as causative of bacte-
rial vaginosis is not known. Typical Gram-staining
features of the bacteria are diagnostic. They are
sensitive to erythromycin, ampicillin, clindamycin
and vancomycin but resistant to colistin.
Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium
Biﬁdobacterium spp. and Eubacterium spp. are
commonly found in the oropharynx, large intes-
tine and vagina. They are usually isolated as
contaminants. Repeated isolation of these bacteria
in the absence of other pathogens may suggest
their role as possible agents of infection.
Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
Anaerobic
Gram-negative
bacilli
of
clinical
importance belong to the family Bacteroidaceae.
This is classiﬁed into four genera: Bacteroides,
Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Prevotella.
All these are Gram-negative. The Prevotella spe-
cies are very small and elongated, whereas the
Fusobacterium species are long and thin. A sur-
face lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major com-
ponent of the cell wall.
Properties of Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
Bacteroides species have now been reorganised.
Earlier, the genus Bacteroides consisted of almost

50 species. Now, a saccharolytic pigmented spe-
cies have been re-classiﬁed into the genus
Porphyromonas (Greek word, meaning “purple”)
and saccharolytic bile-sensitive species in the
genus Prevotella.

Bacteroides
The genus Bacteroides now includes Bacteroides
fragilis and closely related other species, such as
Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroide svulgatus and
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. B. fragilis is the
prototype of an endogenous anaerobic pathogen
that colonises humans. B. fragilis is pleomorphic
in size and shape, having a typical Gram-negative
cell wall. A surface LPS is a major component of
the cell wall. The LPS of B. fragilis lacks endo-
toxin activity, unlike the LPS of Fusobacterium.
B. fragilis is surrounded by a polysaccharide cap-
sule. Bacteroides are non-fastidious and grow
rapidly in culture, whereas other anaerobic
Gram-negative bacilli are fastidious and grow
slowly (3 days and more) in the culture media.

The ability of the bacteria to inactivate
immunoglobulins, cause tissue destruction and
resist oxygen toxicity plays an important role in
the
pathogenesis
of
anaerobic
infections.
B. fragilis and other anaerobic Gram-negative
bacilli produce a wide variety of virulence factors,
which play a major role in the pathogenesis of the
disease (Table 34.3). The presence of a polysac-
charide capsule in B. fragilis helps the bacteria
adhere to peritoneal surfaces more effectively
than other anaerobes. The capsular polysaccha-
ride is antiphagocytic; it inhibits phagocytosis by

t
polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Succinic acid and
other short-chain fatty acids provided by these
bacteria during anaerobic metabolism also exhibit
phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria.

Cause destruction of
tissues
B. fragilis and other species possess pili by
which
they
adhere
to
the
epithelial
cells.
Bacteroides produce the enzymes catalase and
superoxide
dismutase,
which
inactivate
the
hydrogen peroxide and superoxide-free radicals,
thereby protecting these anaerobic bacteria when
they are exposed to oxygen. The other factors that
facilitate the spread of these anaerobic bacteria
are trauma, tissue necrosis, impaired circulation
and the presence of foreign bodies.
In large numbers, B. fragilis and other anaero-
bic Gram-negative bacteria usually colonise the
skin, mouth, nasopharynx and upper respiratory
tract, intestine and vagina. As resident bacterial
ﬂora, they prevent colonisation by other patho-
genic organisms and help digest food. These
organisms, however, cause infections when they
spread from their usual sites to other parts of the
body that are usually sterile.
B.
fragilis
causes
more
than
80%
intraabdominal
infections,
even
though
B. distasonis and B. thetaiotaomicron are found
predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract. These
two
species
merely
cause
any
abdominal
infections. B. fragilis is the common anaerobic
bacteria that cause an abscess in the genitourinary
tract. It is the most important anaerobic bacteria
causing pelvic inﬂammatory disease, endometri-
tis, abscess and other infections of the female
genital tract.
Other Gram-Negative Anaerobes
Other
Gram-negative
anaerobes,
such
as
Fusobacterium
spp.,
Prevotella
spp.,
Porphyromonas spp. and non-B. fragilis spp.,
cause up to 50% of chronic infections of the
sinuses and ears, and most periodontal infections.
Porphyromonas
This genus is separated from Bacteroides; i
includes
two
major
species,
namely
Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas
endodontalis. P. gingivalis inhabits the oral cav-
ity and is implicated in certain periodontal
diseases, whereas P. endodontalis is responsible
for black-coloured colonies on the gingival epi-
thelium and dental root canal infections. The
genus Porphyromonas is non-motile and forms
black-pigmented colonies on blood agar.
Prevotella
The genus Prevotella, which was earlier classiﬁed
under
Bacteroides,
contains
the
moderately
saccharolytic species inhibited by 20% bile. The
main species include Prevotella melaninogenica,
Prevotella
buccalis,
Prevotella
denticola.
P. melaninogenica produces black- or brown-
coloured colonies because of hemin derivative
but not due to the melanin pigment as suggested
before. It causes multiple infections such as lung
or liver abscess, mastoiditis, intestinal lesions,
and mouth and gum lesions. A typical red ﬂuo-
rescence can be seen when P. melaninogenica
cultures or dressings from infected patients are
exposed to UV light.

Anaerobic Cocci
493
Fusobacterium
Members of the genus Fusobacterium are long,
spindle-shaped
bacteria
with
pointed
ends.
Fusobacterium necrophorum produces a variety
of exotoxins and is responsible for liver abscesses
and other abdominal infections in animals more
frequently
than
in
humans.
Fusobacterium
nucleatum forms normal commensal of the
mouth and is also a causative agent of oral
infections and pleuropulmonary sepsis.
Leptotrichia
They are Gram-negative, non-motile, anaerobic
bacilli. Leptotrichia buccalis (Fusobacterium
fusiforme or Vincent fusiform bacillus) is an
important species in the genus Leptotrichia. This
genus also includes other species, including
Leptotrichia goodfellowii, Leptotrichia hofstadii,
Leptotrichia shahii, and two recently deﬁned spe-
cies, Leptotrichia trevisanii and Leptotrichia
ammionii. L. buccalis is one of the ﬁrst bacteria
described
and
drawn
by
Antony
van
Leeuwenhoek. This genus is the normal ﬂora of
the oral cavity and is also found as commensal in
the human intestine and urogenital tract. This
genus has a signiﬁcant role in the pathogenicity
of a common condition called Vincent’s angina,
also called acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
(ANUG), in which inﬂamed pharyngeal mucosa
shows a greyish membrane that peels easily.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Anaerobic
Gram-Negative Bacilli Infections
Laboratory diagnosis depends on the isolation of
Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in clinical
specimens. Isolation of these bacteria needs care-
ful
interpretation
since
most
anaerobes
are
commensals and constitute part of the normal
ﬂora of the skin and mucous surface. The mere
presence of the bacteria does not suggest their
causative role. As far as possible, the specimens
are not collected from their normal resident sites.
The specimens are also not allowed to dry
because drying reduces the number of bacteria.
Hence, specimens are always kept in a moist
environment. The specimens are collected and
transported to the laboratory in an oxygen-free
system
to
minimise
contact
with
air.
The
specimens are inoculated into speciﬁc media
promptly and incubated in anaerobic conditions
in the laboratory. Pus and other biological ﬂuids
are collected in glass vials or bottles with airtight
caps. Collection of ﬂuid and other aspirations in
airtight syringes is a better collection method.
After collection, the needle is plunged into a
sterile rubber container and sealed. Swabs are
not
the
specimen
of
choice
for
anaerobic
infections but, if collected, are sent in Stuart
transport medium.
Microscopic examination of clinical specimens
by Gram staining is useful for diagnosing Gram-
negative
anaerobic
infections.
Gram-stained
ﬁndings of pus smear showing pleomorphic,
Gram-negative bacilli, polymicrobial ﬂora and
numerous pus cells are a useful preliminary diag-
nosis of anaerobic infections. A direct ﬂuorescent
examination may show the bright red ﬂuorescence
of P. melaninogenica.
Many selective media are used, facilitating
Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria’s isolation.
The gas-pack system, which provides a better
method of anaerobiosis, is now used widely.
Most Bacteroides grow within 24–48 h, but
some other Gram-negative anaerobes, such as
Fusobacterium, grow slowly; hence, culture
plates require a longer incubation period. The
specimens
are
cultured
in
parallel
because
many aerobic bacteria are also involved in
polymicrobial infections.
Gas-liquid chromatography of specimens is
also occasionally useful for identifying metabolic
end products of anaerobic bacteria to supplement
laboratory diagnosis.
Treatment
This depends mainly on surgical intervention
and antibiotic therapy. Metronidazole is the anti-
biotic of choice for treating infection caused by
Bacteroides and other Gram-negative anaerobes.
The anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli are also sen-
sitive to penicillin, clindamycin, cephalosporins
and chloramphenicol.

494
34
Non-Sporing Anaerobes
Most
of
the
B.
fragilis,
Prevotella
and
Porphyromonas
species
are
resistant
to
penicillins and many cephalosporins due to
beta-lactamase production. The resistance is over-
come by treating with a high concentration of
carbenicillin, piperacillin, imipenem and beta-
lactamase inhibitors. Bacteroides show plasmid-
mediated resistance to clindamycin.
Case Study
A 42-year-old man was admitted to a hospital
with abdominal pain, tenderness and fever. On
examination, the patient was clinically suspected
to be having appendicitis. He was operated
on. During surgery, a ruptured appendix and a
copious volume of foul-smelling pus were found.
The pus was sent to the microbiology laboratory
for aerobic and anaerobic culture. The culture was
positive for B. fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis and
Escherichia coli.

Coliforms
35
Enterobacteriaceae organisms are ubiquitous bac-
teria. Members of the family show very wide
biochemical and antigenic heterogeneity amongst
themselves. The oxidase test is an important test
by which the members of the Enterobacteriaceae
can be distinguished from many other fermenta-
tive and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli.
Enterobacteriaceae
organisms
cause
various
diseases in humans (Fig. 35.1).
1. Some members of the family, such as Salmo-
nella species and Shigella species, always
cause diseases in humans.
2. Other species, such as Escherichia coli, Kleb-
siella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis,
found as a normal intestinal ﬂora in humans,
can also cause infections in other sites of the
human body.
3. In
addition
to
these,
another
group
of
Enterobacteriaceae
bacteria
are
found
as
normal commensals in humans but become
pathogenic when they acquire virulence factor
genes through plasmids, bacteriophages or
pathogenicity islands. E. coli, associated with
gastroenteritis
in
humans,
is
one
such
example.
Classification
Earlier, the characteristics of the colonies on
commonly
used
mediums
(such
as
the
MacConkey medium) were used to identify and
classify the members of the family Enterobac-
teriaceae. The colonies were classiﬁed as lac-
tose-fermenting
bacteria

However, the current practice is to classify
bacteria
based
on
several
morphological,
biochemical,
serological
and
DNA-based
characteristics.
Bergey manual,
Kauffmann
and whites classiﬁcation, and Edwards–Ewing
classiﬁcations are the three widely used methods
for classifying
the members
of the family
Enterobacteriaceae.
As per the new classiﬁcation (Ewing 1986),
the family Enterobacteriaceae has been classiﬁed
into eight tribes, as given in Table 35.1. The
genus consisting of Yersinia pestis, the causative
agent of a major disease plague, is included under
the tribe Yersinieae in the family Enterobac-
teriaceae.
Important
properties
distinguishing
different genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae
are summarised in Table 35.2. In 2016, a new
order, Enterobacterales, was proposed with seven
families:
Enterobacteriaceae,
Erwiniaceae,
Pectobacteriaceae,
Yersiniaceae,
Hafniaceae,
Morganellaceae and Budviciaceae.
Human
infections
caused
by
common
members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are
summarised in Table 35.3.

E. coli has been recognised as both a harmless

humans causes a broad spectrum of diseases. It
is an important cause of enteric illness, urinary
tract infections (UTIs), neonatal sepsis and neo-
natal meningitis. Haemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS) is a serious complication of enteric infec-
tion with certain E. coli strains.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
E. coli is a Gram-negative bacillus measuring
around 1–3 3 0.4–0.7 μm in size, arranged singly
or in pairs. It is motile due to the presence of
peritrichous
ﬂagella.
Some
strains
are
non-motile, and some may be ﬁmbriated. The
ﬁmbriae are of type I (haemagglutinating and
mannose-sensitive) and are present in both motile
and non-motile strains. Some strains of E. coli
isolated from extra-intestinal infections possess a
polysaccharide capsule.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
E. coli is an aerobe and a facultative anaerobe. It
grows in the temperature range of 10–40 C (opti-
mum 37 C) and has a pH of 7.2. The bacteria
grow on a wide range of media, including
Mueller–Hinton agar, nutrient agar, blood agar
and MacConkey agar. Primary isolation can be
made on nutrient agar and blood agar.
E. coli on nutrient agar after 18 h of incuba-
tion at 37 C produces large, circular, low convex,
greyish-white, moist, smooth, opaque or partially
translucent colonies (smooth or S forms). These
smooth colonies are easily emulsiﬁable in saline.
The rough or R forms produce rough colonies
with an irregular dull surface. These colonies are
often autoagglutinable in saline. The smooth to
rough variation (S–R variation) is associated with
the loss of surface antigens and also with the loss
of virulence and occurs as a result of repeated
sub-culturing.
E. coli produces bright pink, ﬂat colonies due
to lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar.
Many strains, especially those isolated from path-
ological
conditions,
produce
beta-haemolytic
colonies on blood agar. They do not grow on
selective media, such as deoxycholate citrate agar

n
(DCA) or Salmonella–Shigella (SS) agar, used
for the culture of salmonellae and shigellae.
Escherichia coli
499
The
indole,
methyl
red
(MR)-,
Voges–
Proskauer (VP)- and citrate utilisation tests, gen-
erally referred to as the “IMViC” tests are four
important biochemical tests widely used in the
classiﬁcation of enterobacteria. E. coli is indole-
and MR-positive and VP- and citrate-negative
(IMViC + +  –) (Table 35.2). Some strains of
E. coli are late lactose- or non-lactose fermenters
and even produce H2S. The ability to produce
H2S (positive variants) and use citrate by E. coli
is controlled by transmissible plasmids.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
E. coli is inhibited by the presence of 7% sodium
chloride in salt media used for isolation of
staphylococci. Growth of the bacteria is also
inhibited by sodium selenite in selenite broth,
sodium tetrathionate in tetrathionate broth and
brilliant green in brilliant green tetrathionate
broth.
Antigenic Structure
The heat-stable lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the
major cell-wall antigen of E. coli. LPS consists of
three components: (1) the genus-speciﬁc somatic
O polysaccharide, (2) a core polysaccharide com-
mon to all Enterobacteriaceae (common antigen)
and (3) lipid A.
E. coli organisms possess four major antigens:
H or ﬂagellar antigen, O or somatic antigen, K or
capsular antigen and F or ﬁmbrial antigens.
H or Flagellar Antigen
These are heat- and alcohol-labile proteins pres-
ent on the ﬂagella. The H antigens are genus
speciﬁc and usually are not shared by other
enterobacteria. All H antigens are present as
monophasic but very rarely as diphasic. A total
of 75 H antigens have been recognised so far.
O or Somatic Antigen
These
occur
on
the
surface
of
the
outer
membranes and are determined by speciﬁc sugar
sequences on the cell surface. O antigen is an LPS
complex and is an integral part of the cell wall.
It is heat stable, resistant to boiling up to 2.5 h.
Till now, 173 (1–173) O antigens have been
described. Somatic O polysaccharide antigen
shows cross-reactions with related genera (Shi-
gella, Salmonella, Yersinia and Citrobacter) i
the family Enterobacteriaceae.
K or Capsular Antigen
It is the acidic polysaccharide, a heat-labile anti-
gen present in the “envelope” or microcapsule
(K for Kapsel, German for capsule) of the bacte-
ria. K antigen encloses the O antigen and may
interfere with the detection of the O antigens. This
problem is overcome by boiling the bacterial sus-
pension to remove the K antigens. A total of
103 K antigens have been recognised.
F or Fimbrial Antigens
These antigens are present on the ﬁmbriae and are
heat-labile proteins. Several ﬁlamentous protein
structures
resembling
ﬁmbriae
have
been
described in E. coli. These are K88 and K99
antigens in E. coli strains causing diarrhoea in
animals or colonisation factor antigens (CFA) in
enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) causing diarrhoea
in humans. These ﬁmbrial antigens also contrib-
ute to the virulence of the bacteria.
Antigenic Typing
The serotyping of E. coli is based on three major
groups of antigens: O antigens, K antigens and H
antigens. E. coli strains based on O antigens are
initially divided into many O groups. Each O
group is then further divided into sub-groups
based on K antigens. Finally, each of the
sub-group includes strains with different H
antigens. The antigenic pattern of a strain is
recorded depending on the number of the particu-
lar antigen it carries (e.g. E. coli O111:K58:H2).
Different serotypes of E. coli are found in the
normal intestine of humans, and they do not have
K antigens. The normal colon strains belong to
the early O groups (1, 2, 3, 4 etc.). Enteropatho-
genic strains responsible for intestinal diseases
belong to the “later” O groups (55, 86, 111, 112
etc.).

Pathogenesis
E. coli is an invasive bacterium.
It colonises the human intestine and, under
speciﬁc conditions, directly invades the intestinal
mucosa or produces toxins to cause intestinal
infections. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream
and cause septicaemia, meningitis and other sys-
temic manifestations. The bacteria, under certain
conditions, directly invade the urinary tract caus-
ing UTIs or cause intraabdominal infections.
Virulence Factors
E.
coli
produces
several
virulence
factors
(Table 35.5).
Surface Antigens
The somatic O LPS antigen protects E. coli from
phagocytosis and the bactericidal effects of com-
plement proteins. The capsular K antigens also
protect E. coli from phagocytosis. They interfere
with the binding of antibodies to the bacteria.
Most strains of E. coli responsible for neonatal
meningitis and septicaemia possess the KI enve-
lope antigen, a virulence factor similar to the
group B antigen of meningococci. E. coli and
other enteric bacteria capable of producing sys-
temic infections are frequently resistant to serum
killing. Fimbriae: It plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of UTIs caused by E. coli. Surface
antigens, such as K88 and K99 antigens in E. coli,
strains causing diarrhoea in animals or CFA in
ETEC are examples of such ﬁmbriae.
Exotoxins
E. coli also produces two types of exotoxins:
(1) haemolysins, and (2) enterotoxins.
1. Haemolysins are considered important in the
pathogenesis
of
disease
caused
by
uropathogenic strains of E. coli.
2. Enterotoxins are important virulent factors of
E. coli. Three distinct types of E. coli
enterotoxins have been recognised. These
include (1) Shiga toxins (Stx-1 and Stx-2),
(2) STa and STb and (3) LT-I and LT-II.
(a)
Shiga toxins (Stx): Stx is so named
because
its
physical,
antigenic
and
biological properties are similar to the
Shigelladysenteriae type 1 toxin. The
toxin is also named verocytotoxin or
verotoxin (VT) because the toxin was
ﬁrst detected because of its cytotoxic
effect on Vero cells. Stxs are of two
types:
Stx-1and
Stx-2.
Lysogenic
bacteriophages
encode
both
toxins.
Although they show the same biological

f
Escherichia coli
501
activity, both the toxins are antigenically
different. Shiga toxins demonstrate cyto-
toxicity activities in Vero or HeLa cells.
The toxin also shows enterotoxicity in
rabbit ileal loops and paralytic lethality
in the mouse.
(b)
E. coli heat-stable toxin (STs): STs are
low-molecular-weight proteins and are of
two
types:
STa
and
STb.
STa
is
associated with disease in humans. STa
is a small, methanol-soluble, monomeric
toxin that activates cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) in the intestine.
STa binds to guanylate cyclase leading to
an increase in the level of cGMP and a
subsequent increase in the secretion of
ﬂuids. The toxin acts very rapidly and
causes accumulation of ﬂuid in the
intestines of infant mice within 4 h o
intra-gastric administration; hence infant
mouse is a frequently used animal model
for demonstrating STa. The toxin also
causes ﬂuid accumulation in the intestine
of neonatal but not weaned piglets. STb is
not associated with human diseases. STb,
unlike STa, is not methanol soluble. The
exact mode of action of STb is not
known. The toxin causes the accumula-
tion of ﬂuid in ligated intestinal loops of
young piglets up to 9 weeks of age but
not in infant mice.
(c)
E. coli heat-labile toxin (LT): LT is a
heat-labile protein. The toxin was ﬁrst
demonstrated by De et al. in 1956 in
E. coli isolated from cases of adult diar-
rhoea
in
adults
in
Kolkata.
They
demonstrated the toxin in the bacteria by
the rabbit ileal loop method, the method
used to detect the cholera enterotoxin. LT
is of two types: LT-I and LT-II. LT-I, but
not LT-II, is associated with human
diseases. LT-I is structurally and antigen-
ically similar to the cholera toxin. The
LT-I toxin consists of one A subunit of
molecular weight of 25,000 Da and ﬁve
identical B subunits, each sub-unit mea-
suring 11,500 Da.
The B subunits bind to the GM1 gangliosides,
the same receptor as cholera toxin, and other
surface glycoproteins on the epithelial cells in
the small intestine. This binding facilitates the
entry of sub-unit A into the cell by endocytosis.
The A subunit has adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-
ribosyltransferase activity, by which it interacts
with a membrane protein (Gs) that regulates
adenylate cyclase. This increases cyclic adeno-
sine monophosphate (cAMP) levels leading to
increased secretion of chloride and a decreased
absorption of sodium and chloride. This ends in
watery diarrhoea due to hypersecretion of ﬂuid
into the lumen of the gut. The toxin also
stimulates the secretion of prostaglandin and the
production of inﬂammatory cytokines, resulting
in further ﬂuid loss. Genes for LT-I and STa are
present on the I transferable plasmid, which can
also carry the genes for adhesins (CFA/I, CFA/II
and CFA/III).
Adhesins
E. coli possess numerous highly specialised
adhesins. These adhesins include (1) CFAs
(CFA/I, CFA/II and CFA/III), (2) aggregative
adherence
ﬁmbriae
(AAF/I,
AAF/II
and
AAF/III),
(3)
bundle-forming
pili
(Bfp),
(4) intimin, (5) P pili (binds to P blood group
antigens), (6) invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) pro-
tein and (7) Dr. ﬁmbriae (bind to Dr. blood group
antigens). All these adhesins facilitate ﬁrm adhe-
sion of E. coli to the gastrointestinal or urinary
tract mucosa, thereby preventing the bacteria
from being eliminated by the ﬂushing action of
voided urine or intestinal motility.
Siderophores
These remove iron from mammalian iron trans-
port proteins, such as transferring a lactopherin.
Pathogenesis of E. coli infection: E. coli
colonises the human intestine and, under speciﬁc
conditions, directly invades the intestinal mucosa
or produces toxins to cause intestinal infections.
The bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause
septicaemia,
meningitis
and
other
systemic
manifestations.
The
bacteria,
under
certain

conditions, directly invade the urinary tract caus-
ing UTIs or cause intraabdominal infections.
502

Coliforms
Clinical Syndromes
E. coli causes (1) urinary tract infections (UTIs),
(2) diarrhoea, (3) septicaemia, (4) neonatal men-
ingitis, and (5) other infections.
Urinary Tract Infections
E. coli is the most common bacteria responsible
for causing more than 80% of all community-
acquired UTIs. It causes a wide range of UTIs,
including uncomplicated urethritis or cystitis,
symptomatic cystitis, pyelonephritis, acute pros-
tatitis, prostatic abscess or urosepsis. Uncompli-
cated cystitis occurs primarily in sexually active
females who are colonised by uropathogenic
strains of E. coli. Subsequently, the periurethral
region is colonised by E. coli due to faecal con-
tamination, and the bacteria reach the urinary
bladder during sexual intercourse.
E. coli serotypes that are normally found in the
faeces are commonly responsible for UTIs. UTI is
an ascending infection in which the bacteria that
originate from the intestinal tract of the same host
and contaminate the urethra ascend into the blad-
der and may spread to the kidney or prostate.
Although most strains of E. coli can cause
UTI, the disease is more common with certain
speciﬁc E. coli serogroups. These serogroups
that cause UTI are known as nephritogenic
strains. These include E. coli serotypes O1, O2,
O4, O6, O7 and O18. These serotypes, particu-
larly because of their ability to produce adhesins
(primarily P pili, AAF/I, AAF/III and Dr), which
bind to cells lining the bladder and the upper
urinary tract, cause UTI. This prevents the elimi-
nation of the bacteria in voided urine. They also
produce haemolysins, which lyses erythrocytes
and also other cells, leading to the release of
cytokines and stimulation of an inﬂammatory
response.

The strains of E. coli that cause gastroenteritis are
classiﬁed
into
the
following
six
groups
(Table 35.6).
Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)
It is the major cause of infant diarrhoea in tropi-
cal countries. EPEC strains include O26, O55,
O86, O111, O114, O119, O125, O126, O12,
O128 and O142. EPEC causes infection by adher-
ing to epithelial cells of the small intestine,
followed by the destruction of the microvilli.
Subsequently, the attached bacteria multiply and
cause microvilli destruction, resulting in diar-
rhoea due to malabsorption.
Diarrhoea Caused by Enterotoxigenic E. coli
The condition is endemic in developing countries,
amongst all population age groups. This is also
responsible for causing traveller’s diarrhoea in
which individuals from developed countries visit

s
endemic areas. The disease is caused by the con-
sumption of faecally contaminated food or water.
Diarrhoea is caused by certain speciﬁc ETEC
serogroups (O6, O8, O15, O25, O27 and O167).
These serotypes produce heat-labile enterotoxins
(LT-I, LT-II) and cause diarrhoea. LT-I, which is
structurally similar to cholera toxin, produces
cholera-like diarrhoea in patients. The disease
process is facilitated further by the presence of
adhesins (primarily P pili, AAF/I, AAF/III and
Dr), which bind to the intestinal mucosa.
Escherichia coli
503
Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
These
strains
closely
resemble
shigellae
in
many ways: (1) EIEC strains are non-motile,
(2) they do not ferment lactose or ferment late
with the production of acid only and (3) they do
not decarboxylate lysine. These strains show
cross-reactivity with the O antigen of shigellae.
These “atypical” E.coli strains earlier were
named
Shigellaalkalescens
under
the
“Alkalescens-Dispar
Group”
(resembling
Shigellaﬂexneri except in fermenting dulcitol
and
forming
alkali
in
litmus
milk)
and
Shigelladispar (late lactose fermenter-like Shi-
gella sonnei but indole-positive). These have
been renamed EIEC because they can invade
interstitial epithelial cells and penetrate HeLa
cells in tissue culture. The EIEC strains can
invade and destroy the colonic epithelium, pro-
ducing a disease characterised initially by watery
diarrhoea.
Speciﬁc
serogroups
commonly
associated with outbreaks of EIEC include O28
ac, O112 ac, O124, O136, O143, O114, O152
and O154.
Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
These strains are the most common cause of gas-
trointestinal infections in developed countries.
These strains produce diarrhoeal disease, ranging
from mild, uncomplicated diarrhoea to fatal
haemorrhagic conditions such as haemolytic
uraemic syndrome.
EHEC disease is most common in children
below 5 years and during the summer months.
The condition occurs as a result of ingestion
of water, unpasteurised milk or fruit juices,
uncooked vegetables and fruits contaminated
with human or animal faeces. The disease also
occurs on the consumption of undercooked
ground beef or other meat products. The condi-
tion is characterised by acute renal failure, throm-
bocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic
anaemia.
Serotypes
O157:H7
and
O26:H1
are the EHEC strains that commonly cause
the disease. The infection typically lasts for
4–10 days.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome is a serious life-
threatening complication in 10% of infected chil-
dren below 10 years. The ingestion of as few as
100 bacilli can cause the disease. The condition
manifests
as
watery
diarrhoea
to
severe
HC. Watery diarrhoea is often accompanied by
abdominal cramping and
vomiting. In
most
patients, diarrhoea becomes bloody in 1–2 day
but is usually not associated with faecal leukocytes.
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)
They are so-called because they show a typical
“stacked brick” arrangement on Hep-2 cells or
glass due to their autoagglutination. Bundle-
forming ﬁmbriae of the bacteria (such as AAF/I
and AAF/II), which are carried on a plasmid,
mediate this process. These strains are associated
with persistent, watery diarrhoea with dehydra-
tion in infants, especially in developing countries.
Diffusely Adherent E. coli (DAEC)
The strains cause watery diarrhoea found primar-
ily in children between 1 and 5 years of age.
These strains are identiﬁed by their ability to
adhere to cultured cells. They cause elongation
of the microvilli with the bacteria trapped in the
cell membrane.
Septicaemia
E. coli causes septicaemia, which is usually
associated
with
UTI,
especially
in
urinary
obstruction of any cause. The endotoxin or LPS
of the bacteria causes a systemic reaction that can
lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation
and
even
death.
Mortality
and
morbidity
associated with E. coli septicaemia are the same
for other aerobic Gram-negative bacilli.

Coliforms
Neonatal Meningitis
E. coli, along with group B streptococci, are the
major causes of infection of the CNS in infants
who are 1 month of age. In adults, it occurs
following neurosurgical procedures, CNS trauma
or
complicating
Strongyloides
stercoralis
hyperinfection involving the CNS. Neonatal men-
ingitis has a high mortality rate of 8%. The dis-
ease is caused by E. coli strains that possess the
KI capsular antigen, which is commonly present
in the gastrointestinal tracts of pregnant women
and newborn infants.
Other Infections
These include intraabdominal infections due to
E. coli, often resulting from a perforated appen-
dix,
diverticulum
or
due
to
intraabdominal
abscess, cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis.
Septic arthritis, endophthalmitis, sinusitis, osteo-
myelitis, endocarditis or skin and soft tissue
infections are the other pyogenic infections
caused by E. coli.
Laboratory Diagnosis of UTI
Specimens
Freshly voided urine is the specimen of choice for
diagnosing UTI caused by uropathogenic E. coli.
Clean-voided midstream samples of urine are
usually employed for culture. Catheterised urine
and urine collected by suprapubic aspiration are
used in certain situations. Urine is a good medium
for the growth of coliforms and other urinary
pathogens and hence, should be sent immediately
to the microbiology laboratory for processing the
specimen. If a delay of more than 1–2 h i
unavoidable, the specimen should be refrigerated.
Urine Culture
The most commonly used method is a semi-
quantitative urine culture for E. coli and other
Gram-negative
bacteria.
In
this
method,
a
predetermined quantity of urine is inoculated on
MacConkey and blood agar with a standardised
inoculating loop. The loop is calibrated to deliver
0.05 mL of urine; hence 200 loopful of urine will
deliver 1 mL of urine. The number of colonies
obtained after overnight incubation of inoculated
plates multiplied by 200 will be the approximate
number of bacteria/mL of urine. For example, if
the number of colonies on a MacConkey agar
after overnight incubation is 500, the viable bac-
terial count/mL of urine will be (500 3 200)
100,000 or 105. This forms the basis of signiﬁcant
bacteriuria suggested by Kass. After incubation
overnight at 37 C, pink, ﬂat colonies of E. coli on
the MacConkey agar (Fig. 35.2) and beta-
haemolytic colonies on the blood agar are
identiﬁed by various biochemical tests.
In recent years, two new strategies have been
tried to increase the sensitivity of the culture
method. The standard method is used in the
modiﬁed urine culture, the same set of culture
media (Blood agar and MacConkey’s agar) and
urine volume. These plates are incubated for up to
48 h in 5% CO2 at 35 C. In the Expanded
Quantitative Urine Culture Method, a larger vol-
ume of urine (0.1 ml) is used to inoculate multiple
culture medium plates are incubated in aerobic,
anaerobic and microaerophilic atmospheres at
35 C for up to 48 h. The disadvantage of this
method is the use of a large number of culture
plates instead of only two in standard and
modiﬁed methods.
The signiﬁcant bacteriuria concept suggested
by Kass is based on the fact that a colony count
exceeding 100,000 (105) bacteria/mL of urine
denotes signiﬁcant bacteriuria and is suggestive
of an active UTI. Counts of 10,000 bacteria or
less per millilitre are of no signiﬁcance and are
due to urine contamination during voiding. Bacte-
rial counts between 10,000 (104) and 100,000
(105) are infrequent when the sample is collected
properly and processed promptly. Such results are
considered equivocal, and the culture is repeated.
The concept of signiﬁcant bacteriuria is applicable
only for E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria,
and for midstream urine specimens. It is not appli-
cable for the urine specimens collected directly

from the urinary bladder by cystoscopy and for
Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, in which even low counts may be
signiﬁcant.

However, interpretation of bacteriuria requires
caution and should always be with reference to
the patient’s clinical condition. Since UTI is a
common problem and culture facilities are not
available everywhere, several simple methods
have been introduced for the presumptive diagno-
sis of signiﬁcant bacteriuria.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Diarrhoea
Specimens
The faeces are collected from the patient in a
sterile container and sent immediately to the
laboratory.
Stool Culture
Stool
culture
is
widely
used
to
isolate
diarrhoeagenic E. coli. The faecal samples are
inoculated directly on MacConkey and blood
agar media. The plates are incubated at 37 C
overnight
and
looked
for
the
characteristic
lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey and
beta-haemolytic
colonies
on
blood
agar
as
described earlier.
Since E. coli is present as commensals in the
intestine, hence is detected even in the normal
stool. Therefore, it is essential to perform various
diagnostic tests to consider a diarrhoeagenic path-
ogenic E. coli strain. These strains are identiﬁed
by serotyping, animal inoculation, cytopathic
effects in cell cultures or molecular methods.

In-vivo tests
In-vitro tests

Coliforms
Identification of EPEC
Speciﬁc serogroups of E. coli (O26, O55, O86,
O111, O114, O119, O125, O126, O12, O128 and
O142) are commonly associated with outbreaks
of EPEC. Therefore, E. coli colonies isolated
from faeces on MacConkey agar are identiﬁed
by agglutination tests with speciﬁc polyvalent
and monovalent antisera. In this method, a saline
suspension of E. coli colonies is made on the slide
and mixed with a drop of speciﬁc polyvalent and
monovalent antisera against EPEC serogroups. At
least ten colonies/plates should be tested. If
isolated colonies are negative, the conﬂuent
growth is emulsiﬁed and tested. In a positive
test, if E. coli colonies show agglutination with
a speciﬁc serogroup (e.g. O111), then the isolate
is identiﬁed as E. coli of that serogroup (O111).
Identification of ETEC
Diagnosis of ETEC diarrhoea depends on the
demonstration of enterotoxin in E. coli isolates
from stool because toxin production is not
associated with speciﬁc serogroups of E. coli. A
strain of ETEC may produce either LT or ST or
both. Many tests are available to demonstrate the
LT or ST produced by ETEC (Table 35.7).
LT in isolates of E. coli from faeces can be
identiﬁed by (1) ﬂuid accumulation in rabbit ileal
loop method, (2) vascular permeability factor of
the toxin in adult rabbit skin method, (3) tissue
culture tests [rounding of Y1 mouse adrenal cells
and elongation of Chinese hamster ovary cells
(CHO) cells due to an intracellular increase in
cAMP concentration], (4) enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay) and (5) DNA probes. The Biken
test is an in vitro technique based on the
principles of the Elek test and the Ouchterlony
double gel diffusion test. Wells are cut in an agar
plate, and suspected LT-producing E. coli is
placed in one well while the other well contains
anti-LT antiserum. A line of precipitation forms if
the E. coli strain is as ETEC.

ST–ELISA DNA probes
The presence of ST in isolates of E. coli can be
demonstrated by (1) the frequently employed
infant mouse test, and (2) DNA probes.
Identification of EIEC
Many EIEC strains are atypical E. coli strains.
They are non-motile and do not ferment lactose
or ferment it late with acid production but without
producing any gas. They also do not decarboxyl-
ate lysine. The following tests identify EIEC.
Sereny test is carried out in guinea pigs by
instilling isolated EIEC into the conjunctival sac
of guinea pigs. The animal is examined after 72 h
for mucopurulent conjunctivitis and severe kera-
titis. Cell cultures are used to demonstrate the
toxin also. In this method, the bacterial suspen-
sion is added to a monolayer of the cells, either
HeLa or HEP-2. The cells are then examined for
intracellular E. coli because EIEC, if present,
penetrates these cells and replicates inside the
cells. VMA enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays are used to detect the plasmid, which
codes for outer membrane antigens called the
VMA in stool isolates of EIEC.

Escherichia coli
507
Identification of EHEC
E. coli O157:H7 is the most common serotype
associated with the clinical disease caused by
EHEC strains. The strain typically does not fer-
ment sorbitol; hence the sorbitol–MacConkey
medium is frequently used to isolate the strain
from the stool by culture. Identiﬁcation of
EHEC strains is by (1) demonstrating cytotoxic
effects of EHEC on Vero or HeLa cells, and
(2) using DNA probes for VT1, and VT2
genes in EHEC directly in faeces or in culture
isolates.
Identification of Other Strains
EAEC strains are identiﬁed by agglutination tests
with speciﬁc antisera. Most of them are not typed
by O antisera but by speciﬁc H antisera.
In recent years, multiplex PCR has come into
use which can simultaneously detect all the
important diarrhoeagenic E. coli at the same
time without the necessity of performing individ-
ual PCR for each type. The gene targets selected
for each group comprise the following: eae or
bfpA for EPEC isolates, CVD432 for EAEC
isolates, elt and stla for ETEC isolates, stx1 and
stx2 or hlyA for EHEC isolates, and ipaH or ial
for EIEC isolates.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Septicaemia,
Neonatal Meningitis and Other
Infections
The specimens include blood for septicaemia,
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) for meningitis, sputum
for pneumonia or other body ﬂuids, such as pus
from the wound, and biliary and peritoneal
abscesses caused by E. coli. The culture of
blood, CSF and other specimens is also carried
out depending on the clinical diseases caused by
E. coli.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently
being evaluated for bacterial culture isolates and
directly from specimens and is commercially
available. This approach is necessary because
sepsis
may
be
caused
by
various
micro-
organisms, including both bacteria and fungi.
Although considered the “gold standard”, simple
blood culture has serious drawbacks and may not
support the growth of some fastidious organisms.
In addition, sepsis is a rapidly developing life-
threatening condition that requires prompt deﬁni-
tive diagnosis, and the long turnaround time of
blood culture is a distinct disadvantage in such a
situation.
The nucleic acid ampliﬁcation tests can be
divided into three types: those that target either a
species or a genus (pathogen-speciﬁc); those that
target pan-bacterial (16S, 5S and 23S rRNA
genes) or pan-fungal (18S, 5.8S and 28S ribo-
somal DNAs) genes (broad speciﬁc); and ﬁnally
multiplex PCR aimed at parallel detection and
targeting the most important pathogens. A com-
mercial
multiplex
system
(BioFire™
from
Biomerieux) tests for 43 targets and ten resistance
genes with a turnaround time of 1 h. However, the
pathogen must be grown in culture before the test
can be performed. Another technique in the DNA
microarray system uses microchips coated with
several targets to identify a broad range of
pathogens.
Treatment
E.
coli
isolated
from
community-acquired
infections are usually sensitive to commonly
used antibiotics except for penicillins. Hospital-
acquired E. coli isolates, however, show multi-
drug resistance. Most E. coli infections are best
treated based on antibiotics susceptibility testing
results. UTI and neonatal sepsis are treated with
appropriate antibiotic therapy. Treatment of bac-
terial gastroenteritis is primarily supportive. Anti-
biotic therapy is rarely indicated and is deferred
until culture results are available. Presumptive
therapy is not given due to the potential risks
associated with antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea
caused by E. coli O157:H7. Third-generation
cephalosporins,
such
as
ceftriaxone,
are
recommended for meningitis and pneumonia
caused by E. coli.

Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
There is a wide variation in the prevalence of
diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains worldwide. EPEC,
EAEC and DAEC have been reported to occur
most often in developing countries. The WHO
Global Burden of Foodborne Diseases report
shows that >300 million illnesses and nearly
200,000 deaths are caused by diarrheagenic
E. coli globally every year. ETEC is the primary
cause of traveller’s diarrhoea and is the major
cause
of
infantile
diarrhoea
in
developing
countries; the majority of cases of ETEC occur
in children less than 2 years of age. ETEC is a
cause of traveller’s diarrhoea estimated to be
30–45%. As per the WHO, it is estimated that
ETEC
causes
about
220
million
diarrhoea
episodes globally, with about 75 million episodes
in children under 5 years of age and up to 42,000
deaths. EHEC is an emerging cause of food-borne
disease, particularly in the northern United States
and Canada. Outbreaks of HUS in children that
caused fatalities have also been documented in
these countries.
Habitat
Most strains of E. coli causing diseases in humans
inhabit the human intestine. Few strains, such as
EHEC, inhabit the cattle intestine also.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans and also cattle (for E. coli O157:H7) are
reservoirs of infection.
Most E. coli infections, except for neonatal
meningitis and gastroenteritis, are endogenous.
The infection is caused by E. coli that constitute
the patient’s normal microbial ﬂora. These bacte-
ria cause infections, such as UTIs, due to poor
personal
hygiene
or
compromised
patient
defences.
Diarrhoea caused by E. coli is an exogenous
infection acquired from water, food or vegetables
contaminated with faecal E. coli. The condition is
widespread in areas with poor sanitation, and
infections
are
exogenous.
Food
and
water
contaminated with human or cattle faeces are
important sources of diarrhoeagenic E. coli.
Ground beef, apple juice and alfalfa sprouts
contaminated with cattle faeces are important
sources
of
infection
caused
by
EHEC
(e.g. O157:H7). The usual source of E. coli in
neonatal infections is the intestinal tract of the
mother. The bacteria may also be acquired
nosocomially, particularly in premature infants
or those who require mechanical ventilation.
Prevention and Control
Availability of safe drinking water, proper food
hygiene and sanitary disposal of excreta are the
most cost-effective strategies for reducing the
incidence of enteric infections caused by E. coli.
Cooking ground beef thoroughly is the most
effective way to prevent HC caused by E. coli
O157:H7.
Disease caused by EPEC is rare in older chil-
dren and adults, presumably because they have
developed
protective
immunity.
Immunity
develops to ETEC surface antigens in local adult
populations; hence the disease is conﬁned to
immunologically naïve travellers and weaning
infants.
Tribe Edwardsiellae
The genus Edwardsiella differs from the genus
Escherichia by its ability to produce H2S. The
genus
Edwardsiella
includes
Edwardsiella
tarda, the only pathogenic species for humans.
E. tarda inhabits the intestines of snakes and
other cold-blooded animals. The name tarda
refers to the bacteria’s slow or weak fermentation
of
sugars.
E.
tarda
is
a
Gram-negative,
non-capsulated, motile bacillus with weak fer-
mentative powers. E. tarda is an occasional
human pathogen isolated from wounds, blood
and CSF in fatal meningitis. The bacteria have
also been isolated from the stool of normal
healthy people and that of patients with diarrhoea.
Nevertheless, the pathogenic role of the bacteria

in the causation of diarrhoea is yet to be
established.

Tribe Citrobacteriaceae
Citrobacter is a normal inhabitant of the intestine
of humans. The genus Citrobacter consists of
three species, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter
amalonaticus and Citrobacter koseri (formerly
Citrobacter diversus). They grow well on nutrient
agar and other ordinary media, producing smooth
and convex colonies. The colonies are not
pigmented. On MacConkey and DCA media,
they produce pale colonies. Citrobacter spp. are
motile, H2S positive, MR positive, citrate positive
and indole variable. They do not decarboxylate
lysine, but most strains decarboxylate ornithine.
They ferment lactose late or do not ferment at
all. Differences between the three species in
their biochemical characteristics are summarised
in Table 35.8. They show extensive antigenic
sharing with salmonellae, hence may be mistaken
for salmonellae. Certain strains possess a Vi
antigen,
closely
related
to
the
antigen
of
Salmonella typhi
and
Salmonella
paratyphi.
Citrobacter spp. may cause infections of the uri-
nary tract, gall bladder, middle ear and meninges.
C. koseri may occasionally cause meningitis in
neonates.
Tribe Klebsielleae
The bacteria Klebsiella are named after Edwin
Klebs, who demonstrated the bacteria for the
ﬁrst time. Based on DNA homology, the genus
Klebsiella has been divided into seven species:
K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella
rhinoscleromatis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella
planticola, Klebsiella terrigena and Klebsiella
ornithinolytica.
Klebsiella pneumoniae
K. pneumoniae, also known as Friedlander bacil-
lus, was ﬁrst isolated by Friedlander in 1883 from
fatal cases of pneumonia. K. pneumoniae are
Gram-negative, short and straight rods measuring
about 1–2  0.5–0.8 μm in size. They are
arranged singly or in pairs. Freshly isolated
strains show a well-deﬁned polysaccharide cap-
sule. The capsule is often prominent and can be
made out even in Gram-stained smears as haloes
around the bacilli. It is produced well when
grown in media enriched with carbohydrates.
The capsule can also be demonstrated by India
ink preparation and Quellung reaction. Accumu-
lation of extracellular polysaccharides as a loose
slime gives a mucoid appearance to Klebsiella
colonies.
They are non-motile and non-sporing. They
are
lactose
fermenting,
urease
positive
and
indole
negative.
However,
some
strains
of
K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca are exceptions.
They grow well on ordinary media, such as nutri-
ent agar and MacConkey agar at 37 C, forming
large,
dome-shaped,
mucoid
colonies.
They
produce
lactose-fermenting
red
colonies
on
MacConkey agar. Klebsiella possesses 79 capsu-
lar polysaccharides (K antigens) and more than
12 somatic LPS (O antigens). O1, O2 and O3 and
the K2 are the most prevalent types infecting
humans and the serotypes K1 and K2 have been
associated with bacteremia.
Klebsiella
causes
a
variety
of
clinical
manifestations in humans.

Coliforms
Community-Acquired Pneumonia
It is a serious condition with a rapid onset and
often fatal outcome despite early and appropriate
antimicrobial treatment. Lobar pneumonia charac-
teristically is associated with massive mucoid
inﬂammatory exudate of lobar or lobular distribu-
tion,
involving
one
or
more
lung
lobes.
K. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 2 and 3 are usually
associated with the condition. Patients present with
an acute onset of high fever and chills, ﬂu-like
symptoms and productive cough with abundant,
thick, tenacious and blood-tinged sputum. Blood
culture is positive in about 25% of the cases.
UTI
It is caused by K. pneumoniae is a common
problem in patients with indwelling catheters.
K. pneumoniae are emerging as important agents
of nosocomial infections in hospitals. The pres-
ence of invasive devices, contamination of respi-
ratory support equipment, use of urinary catheters
and antibiotics greatly increases the likelihood of
nosocomial infections in hospitalised patients.
Bacteraemia and Sepsis
The conditions are caused by K. pneumoniae
show clinical manifestations similar to those
caused by E. coli and other Gram-negative enteric
organisms.
In neonatal units, outbreaks of infection
caused
by
extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Klebsiella strains present a
more serious problem and may be associated
with high mortality. ESBL strains of Klebsiella
are usually highly virulent, possess capsular type
K55 antigen and have an extraordinary ability to
spread.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of K. pneumoniae infection
is made by isolating bacteria from clinical
specimens
obtained
from
possible
sites
(e.g. wounds, peripheral or central intravenous
access sites, urinary catheters, and respiratory
support equipment) by culture (Fig. 35.3). Kleb-
siella may also be isolated from urine, blood,
pleural ﬂuid and wounds. Serological tests are
not useful for the detection of infection with
K. pneumoniae.
The choice of a speciﬁc antimicrobial agent
depends on the antibiotic-susceptibility patterns
of the isolated strains. Cephalosporines are
widely used as monotherapy and in combination
with aminoglycosides. Cephalosporines are not
used for ESBL strains of K. pneumoniae. The
carbapenems, especially imipenem, are effective
against such ESBL strains. Aztreonam and
quinolones are recommended for patients allergic
to penicillins.
Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis
Rhinoscleroma caused by K. rhinoscleromatis is
a chronic inﬂammatory disease involving the
nasopharynx. Patients present with a purulent
nasal discharge with the formation of crusts and
nodules that may lead to respiratory obstruction.
The bacilli are seen intracellularly in lesions
which can be isolated and identiﬁed by biochem-
ical reactions. Diagnosis is by positive blood cul-
ture supplemented with histology. Rifampin has
been used for the treatment of rhinoscleroma.
Klebsiella ozaenae
Ozena, caused by K. ozaenae, is chronic atrophic
rhinitis characterised by necrosis of nasal mucosa
and mucopurulent nasal discharge. It often occurs
in elderly persons. Nasal congestion and a con-
stant nasal bad smell are the common symptoms.
Identiﬁcation of K. ozaenae is difﬁcult due
to wide variations in the biochemical reactions
of
the
isolated
strains.
Trimethoprim
and
sulphamethoxazole are used for the treatment of
ozena.

Enterobacter
511
Fig. 35.3 Gram-stained smear showing capsulated Klebsiella pneumoniae (31000)
Klebsiella oxytoca
K. oxytoca may be rarely isolated from clinical
specimens. It is being increasingly isolated from
patients with neonatal septicaemia. The bacteria
are also associated with neonatal bacteraemia,
especially among premature infants and in neona-
tal intensive care units.
The biochemical reactions of different Klebsi-
ella species are summarised in Table 35.9.
Enterobacter
The genus Enterobacter includes 12 species, of
which Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter
aerogenes are the two most important species
responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections
(Table 35.10). Enterobacter are Gram-negative
bacilli.
On sheep
blood agar, Enterobacter
produces large, grey and dry or mucoid colonies;
and on MacConkey agar, lactose-fermenting pink
colonies. The bacteria ferment glucose with the
production of acid. They differ from Klebsiella by
being motile, urease negative and ornithine decar-
boxylase positive.
Endotoxin of the bacteria is known to play a
major role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and its
complications. Enterobacter species are opportu-
nistic pathogens. Patients who stay in the hospi-
tal, especially in the ICU, for prolonged periods
are
at
high
risk
to
acquire
Enterobacter
infections. Patients treated earlier with antimicro-
bial agents and those with serious underlying
conditions (e.g. diabetes, malignancies, burns
and mechanical ventilation), with foreign devices
(e.g. intravenous catheters) and with immunosup-
pression are also at increased risk of infection by
the bacteria. In these patients, they cause frequent
and severe nosocomial infections, such as UTIs,

Hafnia
Hafnia alvei is the only species of the genus
Hafnia. It is found in human and animal faeces,
sewage, soil and water. H. alvei is motile. It does
not ferment lactose, rafﬁnose, sucrose, adonitol-
dulcitol and inositol. It is indole- and MR nega-
tive, and VP- and citrate positive. Biochemical
reactions are better read after incubation at 22 C
than at 37 C. The bacteria have been isolated
from abscesses, wounds, sputum, urine, blood
and other sites, but often with other bacteria.
The pathogenic role of H. alvei is yet to be
established.
Serratia
Serratia is a Gram-negative bacterium classiﬁed
in the tribe Klebsielleae. Serratia marcescens is
the only pathogenic species causing human
infection. Some strains of S. marcescens typically
produce
a
non-diffusible
pigment
called
prodigiosin. This pigment varies in colour from
dark red to pink or magenta, depending on the age
of the colonies. S. marcescens usually grows on
starchy foodstuffs, where the production of
pigmented colonies is easily mistaken for drops
of blood. S. marcescens exists as pleomorphic
with minute coccobacillary and normal bacillary
forms.
Serratia usually colonises the respiratory and
urinary tracts of adult patients during their period
of hospital stay. The bacteria are responsible for
nearly 2% of nosocomial infections of the urinary
tract, lower respiratory tract, surgical wounds,
blood and skin and soft tissues of the hospitalised
patients. S. marcescens is sensitive to amikacin
and quinolones but is resistant to gentamicin and
tobramycin.

Tribe Proteeae
The formation of the enzyme phenylalanine
deaminase, which converts phenylalanine to phe-
nyl pyruvic acid (PPA reaction), is the character-
istic feature by which they are differentiated from
other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
The differentiating features of different genera in
the tribe Proteeae are summarised in Table 35.11.
Proteus
The genus Proteus has four species: P. mirabilis,
Proteus
vulgaris,
Proteus
penneri
and
Proteus myxofaciens of which P. mirabilis is
the most important. They are Gram-negative
and
non-capsulated
coccobacilli
measuring
1–3  0.6 μm in size. Many of them form long,
curved and ﬁlamentous forms in young cultures.
Most of them, with few exceptions, are motile due
to the presence of peritrichous ﬂagella. They are
ﬁmbriated. They are aerobic bacteria, which grow
well on ordinary media, such as nutrient agar.
Proteus colonies on the medium emit a character-
istic putrefactive (“ﬁshy” or “seminal”) odour.
P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris typically spread or
swarm on the surface of the medium. They spread
on the surface of the plate in successive waves to
form a thin ﬁlmy layer in concentric circles. This
is known as swarming (Fig. 35.4). The exact
mechanism responsible for swarming shown by
Proteus species is not known. Swarming, shown
by Proteus, is a problem when mixed growth on a
solid medium is obtained in which Proteus bacilli
are present with other bacteria. Hence, several
methods are available to inhibit swarming; these
include the use of increased concentration of agar
in the medium from 1% to 6% and the use of
chloral hydrate (1:500), sodium azide (1:500),
alcohol
(56%),
sulphonamide,
surface-active
agents
or
boric
acid
(1:1000).
Swarming
does not occur on the MacConkey medium,
on which Proteus produces colourless non-
lactose-fermenting colonies. It is because bile
salts present in the MacConkey medium inhibit
the swarming. The biochemical characteristics
of
the
Proteus
species
are
summarised
in
Table 35.11.
Motile Proteus strains possess somatic O- and
ﬂagellar H antigens. Thirty-two different O
antigens are
found in
P. mirabilis, 22 i
P.
vulgaris
and
5
in
P.
penneri
and
P. myxofaciens. Their O antigens, P. mirabilis
and P. vulgaris, have been classiﬁed into 54 O
groups based on their O antigens. These O groups
are further sub-divided into many O types
depending on their ﬂagellar or H antigens.
Non-motile strains of P. vulgaris (OX19 and
OX2) and P. mirabilis (OXK) cross-react with
rickettsial antigens and form the basis of the
Weil-Felix test for the diagnosis of rickettsial
infections.
Proteus are invasive bacteria. Fimbriae or pili
are the important virulence factors that facilitate
adherence of P. mirabilis bacteria to host tissue
sites, such as the urinary tract epithelium. The
ability of Proteus to produce urease is an

important factor in the pathogenesis of the UTI
caused by the Proteus species. Hydrolysis of urea
to ammonia makes the urine alkaline, which
provides a suitable environment for Proteus to
survive. Subsequently, alkalinisation of urine
leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic
compounds, leading to renal calculi formation.
These stones are composed of a combination of
magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and
calcium carbonate–apatite.

Proteus species cause UTIs, hospital-acquired
infections and other miscellaneous infections.
UTIs are the most common clinical manifestation
of
Proteus
infections.
Hospital-acquired
infections are usually transmitted from attending
doctors or other healthcare workers and are
caused by hospital staff’s interruption of the
closed sterile system. The Proteus species is
also an important agent of wound infections.
The species also cause infection of the umbilical
stump in neonates, which often leads to sepsis
neonatorum, bacteraemia and meningitis. Urine
is the specimen of choice for the diagnosis of
UTIs. Culture of blood, urine, CSF and other
specimens is also carried out depending on the
clinical diseases caused by Proteus.
Proteus species can be typed by serotyping,
phage typing, bacteriocin (protein) typing and
Dienes typing. Proticin typing is frequently car-
ried out using 12 standard proticin-producing
strains, and most of the Proteus strains are type-
able by this method.
Dienes typing: It is used to determine the
identity or non-identity of strains of Proteus.
This is based on the observations that two identi-
cal strains of Proteus show swarming, which
coalesce together without any demarcation, on a
solid agar that does not inhibit swarming. How-
ever, if the strains are not identical, then the
swarming strains do not coalesce together and
instead are separated from each other with a
clearly visible furrow between the swarming of
the
two.
This
is
known
as
the
Dienes
phenomenon.

P. mirabilis is susceptible to nearly all
antimicrobials except tetracycline. P. mirabilis
is
sensitive
to
ampicillin;
broad-spectrum
penicillins, such as ticarcillin and piperacillin;
ﬁrst-,
second-
and
third-generation
cephalosporines;
imipenem;
and
aztreonam.
P. vulgaris and P. penneri are sensitive to tri-
methoprim and sulphamethoxazole, quinolones,
imipenem, aminoglycosides and fourth-genera-
tion cephalosporins.
Morganella
The genus Morganella belongs to the tribe
Proteeae. The genus Morganella has only one
species,
Morganella
morganii,
with
two
sub-species, morganii and sibonii. M. morganii
was classiﬁed earlier under the genus Proteus as
Proteus morganii. M. morganii are small, Gram-
negative, motile bacilli, but unlike the Proteus
species, they do not produce swarming on solid
media. M. morganii is commonly found in human
and animal faeces and rarely causes severe inva-
sive diseases. It is most often found as an oppor-
tunistic
pathogen
in
hospitalised
patients,
particularly those on prolonged antibiotic ther-
apy. M. morganii causes UTIs, which are often
associated with an alkaline urine pH. Nosocomial
M. morganii strains are usually susceptible to
cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin,
aminoglycosides
and
ﬂuoroquinolones.
ESBL-producing strains of M. morganii have
been reported recently.
Providencia
The genus Providencia consists of ﬁve species:
Providencia
stuartii,
Providencia
rettgeri,
Providencia
alcalifaciens,
Providencia
rustigianii
and
Providencia
heimbachae.
Providencia spp. is Gram-negative, motile bacilli
but does not show swarming on solid media.
They produce a fruity smell and are from yellow
to orange colonies on DCA. All the species typi-
cally deaminate phenylalanine; only P. rettgeri
hydrolyses urea consistently. Other biochemical
properties of Providencia are summarised in
Table 35.11. Providencia species have been
isolated from urine, stool and blood, and the
throat,
perineum,
axilla
and
wounds
from
humans. P. stuartii is the most common species
causing infection in humans. P. stuartii is the
most resistant species of all the Providencia spe-
cies, P. alcalifaciens and P. rustigianii are usually
susceptible to antibiotics.
Tribe Erwinieae
Erwinia organisms are usually found in soils, and
they cause infection in plants. Erwinia herbicola
is the only species that has occasionally been
isolated from respiratory and urinary infections
in
chronically
debilitated
and
hospitalised
patients.
Case Study
A 19-year-old female medical student visited
medicine OPD complaining of a burning sensa-
tion when passing urine and increased frequency
of passing urine. The consultant advised a culture
of urine before prescribing any antibiotics.

Salmonella and Shigella
36
Salmonellae are ubiquitous human and animal
pathogens.
Genus Salmonella
Salmonella spp. include Gram-negative, ﬂagel-
lated
and
facultative
anaerobic
bacilli
characterised by the presence of O, H and Vi
antigens. They colonise virtually all animals,
including
poultry,
birds,
livestock,
reptiles,
rodents, domesticated animals and humans. Sal-
monella infections in humans typically produce
one of three clinical syndromes, such as gastroen-
teritis, enteric fever or focal disease. In addition,
Salmonella infection in animals causes substan-
tial losses of livestock.
Classification and Nomenclature
The taxonomic classiﬁcation of the genus Salmo-
nella is complex and has undergone many
changes.
Kauffmann–White Scheme
It is a method of classiﬁcation of Salmonella
strains based on structural formulae of the O and
H antigens of the strains, which are identiﬁed by
agglutination with speciﬁc antisera. Salmonellae
are classiﬁed into different O serogroups based on
distinctive O antigen factors. Each serogroup
contains many serotypes possessing a common
O factor not found in other serogroups. These O
factors are now designated 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.; these
were originally designated by capital letters A–Z
and
afterwards
by
numbers
51–67.
Some
serogroups were subdivided into subserogroups
(e.g. C1–C4; E1–E4). It seems logical to name
each serogroup by its characteristic O antigen
factor numbers rather than letters. Hence, it is
now being proposed to designate group A as
2, B as 4, C1 as 7, C2 as 8, Das 9, etc.

Within
each
O
serogroup,
the
different
serotypes are identiﬁed by the presence of phase
1 and phase 2 of ﬂagellar antigens. The antigenic
structure of a Salmonella serotype is designated
by
an
antigenic
formula,
which
has
three
components
demonstrating
the
O
antigens,
antigens of Phase 1 H and Phase 2 H in
subsequent orders. In this, colons separate the
three parts, and commas separate each part of
the component antigen.
The Kauffmann–White scheme designates
each serotype as a species (Table 36.1). More
than 2400 serotypes have been described by
Kauffmann–White scheme.
•
Based on DNA homology and host range, the
genus Salmonella is classiﬁed into Salmonella
enterica and Salmonella bongori. S. enterica is
further subdivided into six subspecies I, II, IIa,
IIIb, IV and VI.

Additionally, each Salmonella isolates are
serotyped according to the presence of partic-
ular somatic O, ﬂagellar H and surface Vi
antigens. Presently more than 2400 serotypes
are described.

ple,

Enteritidis. However, for the sake of convenience,
it is abbreviated as S. Enteritidis (this chapter

use in clinical situations. In addition, serotypes
are not mentioned in italic but Roman.
Human infections caused by Salmonella spp.
are summarised in Table 36.2.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Salmonella is motile with the presence of peritri-
chous ﬂagella (Salmonella Gallinarum and Sal-
monella
Pullorum
are
exceptions
that
are
non-motile). They do not form spores and
capsules. Some strains of salmonellae may pro-
duce
ﬁmbriae,
but
most
strains
of
Salmonella Paratyphi A and a few strains of Sal-
monella Paratyphi B, Salmonella Typhi and Sal-
monella Typhimurium are non-ﬁmbriated.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
They are aerobic and facultatively anaerobic; they
grow at an optimum temperature of 37 C at a pH
of 6–8 on various selective and non-selective
media.
Non-selective Media
On nutrient agar and blood agar, Salmonella
spp. produce greyish white moist colonies with a
smooth convex surface after 18–24 h of incuba-
tion. Rough strains produce opaque and granular
colonies
with
an
irregular
surface.
On
MacConkey agar, they produce pale colourless
colonies because they do not ferment lactose. The
colonies on deoxycholate citrate agar are simi-
lar to those produced on MacConkey agar. Some-
times after incubation of 48 h or more, they
produce colonies with a black centre.
Selective Media
Wilson and Blair bismuth sulphite agar is the
medium of choice for Salmonella spp., especially
S. Typhi. The growth of Shigella spp., Proteus
spp. and coliforms is inhibited on this medium.
On this medium, salmonellae produce jet black
colonies surrounded by a metallic sheen due to
hydrogen sulphide production. S. Paratyphi A and
other species, which do not produce H2S, form
green
colonies.
XLD
(xylose
lysine
deoxycholate agar) is another selective medium
used to isolate Salmonella spp. On this medium,

Salmonella spp. produce pink colonies with black
centres
as
a
result
of
H2S
production.
H2S-negative Salmonella serotypes produce red
colonies without black centres.

Enrichment Media
Selenite F broth is frequently used to enrich
Salmonella spp. from clinical specimens. How-
ever, sometimes this medium inhibits the growth
of some salmonellae, such as S. Paratyphi B and
Salmonella Choleraesuis. Tetrathionate broth,
although it is used for salmonellae at times the
broth allows the growth of Shigella spp. and also
that of Proteus spp. Tetrathionate broth with bril-
liant green, although it inhibits the growth of
Proteus
spp.,
sometimes
is
inhibitory
to
Salmonella spp.
Salmonellae are catalase positive and oxidase
negative. Salmonellae ferment glucose, mannitol
and maltose, forming acid and gas. S. Typhi is an
exception that does not ferment the sugars. They
do not ferment lactose. They do not grow in
Simmons citrate media as they need tryptophan
as the growth factor. Salmonellae decarboxylate
amino acids, such as lysine, ornithine and argi-
nine, but not glutamic acids. However, S. Typhi
does not decarboxylate ornithine and S. Paratyphi
A does not decarboxylate lysine. The biochemical
characteristics are useful for distinguishing differ-
ent Salmonella spp. (Table 36.3).
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
The bacilli are killed at a temperature of 55 C in
1 h or 60 C in 15 min. They are also killed by
0.2% mercuric chloride or 5% phenol in 5 min.
Boiling, chlorination of water and pasteurisation
of milk kill the bacteria. They survive for weeks
in polluted water and soil and months in ice.
Cultures may be viable for years if prevented
from drying.
Antigenic Structure
The cell wall of salmonellae-like any other Gram-
negative bacilli contains a complex lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) structure. LPS, an endotoxin,
plays a signiﬁcant role in the virulence of the
bacteria. It has three regions (1) inner lipid A
coat, (2) middle R core portion and (3) outer O
polysaccharide coat.
1. The outer O polysaccharide chain has repeated
sugar units responsible for O antigen speciﬁc-
ity. This can determine the virulence of the
bacteria. Rough strains of Salmonella lack a
complete sequence of O sugar.
2. The endotoxin component of the cell wall is
important in the pathogenesis of Salmonella
infections. The circulatory endotoxin is also
partly responsible for the development of sep-
tic shock that can occur in systemic infection.

3. Antibodies produced against the R core (com-
mon enterobacterial antigen) are protective
against infection caused by a wide variety of
Gram-negative bacteria due to sharing the
common core structure. In some situations,
the antibodies against the R core mediate the
lethal effects of Gram-negative bacteria.
Salmonella possesses the following three
major antigens H or ﬂagellar antigen, O or
somatic antigen and surface antigens based on
which they are identiﬁed and classiﬁed.
H or Flagellar Antigen
This antigen is present on the ﬂagella and is heat
and alcohol labile. The H antigens of Salmonella
are genus speciﬁc and are not shared by other
enterobacteria. The antigens are destroyed by
boiling or treatment with alcohols and acid, but
they are preserved in 0.2–0.4% formaldehyde.
The H antigen is strongly immunogenic and is
associated with the formation of antibodies fol-
lowing infection or immunisation. H antigen may
occur in either or both the forms called phase I
and phase II. The organisms tend to change from
one phase to another.
O or Somatic Antigen
O antigens occur on the surface of the outer
membranes and are determined by speciﬁc sugar
sequences on the cell surface. O antigen is an LPS
complex and is an integral part of the cell wall. It is
heat stable resistant to boiling for up to 2 h and
30 min. It is also alcohol stable, resistant to treat-
ment with 96% ethanol at 37 C for 4 h an
resistant to 0.2% formaldehyde. O antigen is less
immunogenic than H antigen. Generally, the O
antibody
titre
produced
after
infection
or
immunisation is lower than H antibodies. Salmo-
nella is classiﬁed based on the presence of a char-
acteristic O antigen on the bacterial surface. Till
now, 67 “O” antigens have been described. Sal-
monella
has
been
classiﬁed
into
46
“O”
serogroups based on the somatic antigens.
Surface Antigens
These include Vi antigen, M and N antigens and F
antigens.
1. Vi antigen is a surface antigen overlying the
“O” antigen. Felix and Pitt, who ﬁrst described
this antigen, believed that it was related to
virulence and gave it the name Vi antigens.
It is analogous to the K antigens of coliforms.
The antigen is present only in a few serotypes,
the most important being S. Typhi. This anti-
gen is also present in some strains of S.
Paratyphi
C,
Salmonella
Dublin
and
Citrobacter freundii. The presence of this anti-
gen on the surface renders these bacteria
inagglutinable by their speciﬁc O antiserum
but agglutinable by Vi antisera. Vi antigen is
poorly immunogenic and is associated with the
production of low titre of antibodies during the
infection. Antibody disappears early in conva-
lescence.
Its
persistence
indicates
the

Genus Salmonella
521
development of the carrier state. Demonstra-
tion of the Vi antibody is not useful for
diagnosing cases of typhoid; hence, Vi antigen
is not tested in the Widal test.
2. M and N antigens are present on the surface
of bacteria and are polysaccharides in nature.
These antigens prevent agglutination by O
antiserum. Boiling for 2.5 h destroys these
antigens. The presence of the M antigen is
responsible for the mucoid nature of Salmo-
nella colonies.
3. F antigen is present on the ﬁmbriae. They
occur in two phases: one with F antigen and
the other without F antigen.
Antigenic Variations
Salmonellae antigens undergo phenotypic and
genotypic variations as follows:
OH–O Variation
Some of the ﬂagellated Salmonella (OH) at times
gives rise to non-ﬂagellated (O) strains. This is
called OH–O variation. Sub-culture in Craigie
tube is used to obtain a population of ﬂagellated
bacteria from such cultures. Craigie tube method
(Fig. 36.1) uses a wide tube containing semi-solid
agar (0.2%). A short, narrow tube, open at both
ends, is placed into the agar of the tube in such a
way that the upper end of the tube projects well
above the agar. The bacterial strain is inoculated
into the inner tube, and after 8–16 h of incubation,
sub-cultures made from the top of the agar outside
the central tube yield a population of motile cells.
A U tube of soft agar instead of Craigie tube may
be used for the purpose in which inoculation is
made into one limb and sub-culture is taken from
the other.
Fig. 36.1 Craigie tube
method of sub-culture
Sub-culture is taken from the
surface of the medium in the
outer tube
Inoculation made inside
the inner tube
Rarely, salmonellae may lose their ﬂagella by
mutation. S. Typhi 901-O strain is an example of
a stable non-motile mutant, which is used to pre-
pare O agglutinable bacterial antigen suspensions
for use in the Widal test and other serological
tests.
V–W Variation
Vi antigen of S. Typhi completely masks the O
antigen. They are called the V form. After
sub-culturing many times, the Vi antigen is
completely lost, and they are known as W form.
Such forms are called VW forms.
S─R Variation
The smooth-to-rough (S–R) variation occurs due
to mutation and is associated with the (1) change

in the colony morphology from smooth to rough,
(2) loss of the O antigen and (3) loss of virulence.
The rough colonies become large, rough and
irregular and are autoagglutinable in saline.
These colonies show a defective capacity to
synthesise O antigen. Conversion into rough
forms rarely occurs in nature but is common in
laboratory
strains
maintained
by
serial
sub-culture on ordinary media. The smooth S–R
variation may be prevented to some extent by
maintaining cultures on Dorset egg media or by
lyophilisation.
522
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Phase Variation
The ﬂagellar or H antigens of most salmonellae
occur in two alternate phases: phase 1 and phase
2. Phase 1 antigens are either speciﬁc for a
serotype or shared by a few species only, hence
known as the “speciﬁc” or species phase. A large
number of ﬂagellar antigens, more than 80, have
been found in this phase. These are designated as
small letters of alphabets a–z except j and subse-
quently z1–z68. The presumptive identiﬁcation of
serotype is based on identifying the antigen in
phase 1. Phase 2 antigens are widely shared,
hence known as the “non-speciﬁc” or “group”
phase. Phase 2 antigens are far fewer and are
designated
by
Arabic
numerals
from
1
to
12 (1, 2, 3 . . .12).
Salmonella strains that occur in both phases
are called biphasic, while the strains that occur in
one phase only are called monophasic (e.g. S.
Typhi, S. Paratyphi A, etc.).
The Craigie tube method uses the conversion
of isolates from one phase to another. In this
method, a culture in phase 1 is converted to
phase 2 by passing it through the Craigie tube
containing speciﬁc phase 1 antiserum and the
reverse conversion is achieved by using phase
2 antiserum.

O antigen Variation
When
the
bacterium
is
lysogenised
with
converting phages, there occurs a change in the
structural formula of the O antigen, which brings
alteration in bacterial serotypes. Thus, Salmonella
Anatum (serotype 3,10:e,h:1,6) is converted by
phage 15 into Salmonella Newington (serotype
3,15:e,h:1,6) by one phage and the latter into
Salmonella
Minneapolis
(serotype
3,15,34:e,
h:1,6) by phage 34. Serotypes Newington and
Minneapolis are designated as Anatum var. 15+
and Anatum var. 15 +, 34 +, respectively.
Pathogenesis
S. Typhi is an invasive bacterium. It colonises the
human intestine and, under speciﬁc conditions,
directly
invades
the
intestinal
mucosa
or
multiplies for several days within the mononu-
clear phagocytic cells in the liver, spleen, lymph
nodes and Peyer patches of the ileum before the
invasion. The bacteria subsequently enter the
bloodstream
and
cause
the
disease
manifestations.
Virulence Factors
Virulence factors of salmonellae are complex.
These are encoded both on the organism’s chro-
mosome and on large (34–120 kDa) plasmids
(Table 36.4) and include the followings:

Endotoxin
Endotoxin is responsible for many of the systemic
manifestations
of
the
disease

by
Salmonella spp.
Fimbriae
The species-speciﬁc ﬁmbriae mediate binding of
Salmonella to M (microfold) cells present in
Peyer patches of the terminal part of the small
intestine. These M cells typically transport for-
eign antigens, such as bacteria, to the underlying
macrophages for clearance.
Acid Tolerance Response (ATR) Gene
The acid tolerance response (ATR) gene protects
Salmonella spp. from stomach acids and the
acidic pH of the phagosome, thereby facilitating
the survival of bacteria in phagosomes.
Enzymes
Catalase
and
superoxide
dismutase
are
the
enzymes that protect the bacteria from intracellu-
lar killing in macrophages.
Pathogenesis of Enteric Fever
The infection is acquired by ingesting food or
water
contaminated
with
salmonellae
(Fig. 36.2). In human volunteer experiments, the
infective dose (ID50) is about 103–106 bacilli.
The dose of inoculum required to produce
infections varies from strain to strain. Usually, a
large amount of inoculum is needed to overcome
stomach acidity and normal ﬂora competition.
When the inoculum is large, the illness rate will
be higher with a shorter incubation period.
The salmonellae attach themselves by ﬁmbriae
or pili to cells lining the ileal mucosa on reaching
the intestine. The bacteria selectively attach to
specialised epithelial cells (M cells) of the Peyer
patches. Type III secretion system (TTSS-1)
encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island
1 (SPI-1) and genes mediate the initial invasion
of S. Typhi into the intestinal mucosa. An ATR
gene also protects Salmonella spp. from stomach
acids and the acidic pH of the phagosome. Cata-
lase and superoxide dismutase are other factors
that protect the bacteria from intracellular killing.

The
bacteria
are
then
transported
within
phagosomes to the lamina propria, where they
are released. In the lamina propria, typhoidal
strains of salmonellae induce the production of
macrophages, while non-typhoidal strains induce
the production of neutrophils. Subsequently, S.
Typhi and other virulent Salmonella strains
invade
deeper
tissues
via
lymphatics
and
capillaries and elicit a major immune response.
The organisms travel from the submucosa to the
mesenteric lymph nodes, multiply and then enter
the bloodstream via the thoracic duct (transient
primary bacteraemia) to spread to other tissues.
524
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Bacteria invade reticuloendothelial tissues of
the liver, bone marrow, gallbladder spleen and
Peyer patches in the terminal ileum. Infection of
the bile results in stool culture positivity. When
there is pre-existing gallbladder disease, it results
in chronic biliary infection, which leads to a lon-
ger period of faecal carriage.
Peyer patches are invaded during primary
intestinal or secondary bacteraemia. Inﬁltration
of chronically inﬂamed cells makes the Peyer
patches hyperplastic. This may lead to the necro-
sis of the outer layer and form an ulcer, with the
possibility of haemorrhage from blood vessel
erosion.
Clinical Syndromes
S.
Typhi
causes
typhoid
fever,
while
S.
Paratyphi A, Salmonella Schottmuelleri (for-
merly
S.
Paratyphi
B)
and
Salmonella
Hirschfeldii (formerly S. Paratyphi C) cause a
mild form of this disease referred to as a paraty-
phoid fever. The term enteric fever includes both
typhoid and paratyphoid fever caused by these
Salmonella spp.
Typhoid Fever
Typhoid fever is generally an acute illness
manifested by fever, headache and abdominal
symptoms. The incubation period is usually
from 7 to 14 days but may range from 3 to
56 days. The onset of the disease is usually grad-
ual, with headache, malaise, anorexia, a coated
tongue and abdominal discomfort with either
constipation or diarrhoea. Step ladder pyrexia
with relative bradycardia and toxaemia is the
typical feature. The condition is associated with
a soft, palpable spleen and an enlarged liver.
These symptoms are present for a week or more
and are followed by gastrointestinal symptoms.
This phase corresponds to an initial bacteraemic
phase, followed by colonisation of the gallbladder
and then reinfection of the intestines.
Relapse is common after initial recovery in
10–20% of patients treated with antibiotics.
Relapse typically occurs approximately 1 week
after the therapy is discontinued. A relapse gener-
ally is milder and shorter than the initial disease.
Rarely, second or even third relapses may occur.
The blood culture and serum H, O and Vi
antibodies are positive in relapse cases.
Intestinal perforation, severe haemorrhage and
circulatory collapse are the most important
complications.
Other
complications
include
toxic encephalopathy, cerebral thrombosis, hepa-
titis, pancreatitis, arthritis and myocarditis. Con-
valescence is slow.
Paratyphoid Fever
Paratyphoid fever caused by S. Paratyphi A and B
resembles typhoid fever but is generally milder. S.
Paratyphi C may also cause paratyphoid fever,
but it often leads to frank septicaemia with sup-
purative complications.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Blood, blood clot, bone marrow and stool are
common specimens used for isolation of Salmo-
nella by culture. Other specimens include the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid, peritoneal ﬂuid, mesenteric
lymph nodes, resected intestine, pharynx, tonsils,
abscess, bone and urine.
Blood Culture
Blood culture is useful for diagnosing enteric
fever. In this method, approximately 5–10 mL
of blood is collected aseptically by venepuncture
and inoculated into a culture bottle containing
50–100 mL of 0.5% bile broth. This ten-fold

dilution of blood in the bile broth is carried out to
neutralise
the
bactericidal
action
of
many
substances present in the blood. The addition of
liquid (sodium polyanethol sulphonate) further
counteracts the bactericidal action of blood. The
blood culture bottle is incubated at 37 C for
7 days. After incubation overnight at 37 C, the
bile broth is sub-cultured on MacConkey agar.
Salmonellae form pale non-lactose-fermenting
colonies on MacConkey agar.
Genus Salmonella

Fig. 36.3 Blood culture
bottles used in automated
blood culture system
Blood culture is positive in approximately
90% of cases in the ﬁrst week of fever, in the
second week of fever with 75% of cases, in the
third week of fever with 60% and with 25% of
cases until pyrexia subsides. Blood cultures, how-
ever, rapidly become negative on treatment with
antibiotics.
Castañeda Biphasic Method of Blood Culture
is a better method of culture to reduce the risk of
contamination during repeated sub-cultures. The
method has the additional advantage of being
more safe and economical. In this method, the
culture bottle has an agar slant on one side,
which is ﬂooded with bile broth. After inoculation
of blood, the bottle is incubated in the upright
position, so that surface of the agar remains free
without any broth covering the slant. Broth
remains only in the lower part of the agar slope.
For sub-culture, the bottle is simply tilted so that
the broth ﬂows over the surface of the agar slant
and is re-incubated in the upright position. If
salmonellae are present, colonies appear on the
agar slant.
Automated Blood Culture System
At present automated blood culture systems, is
available as a more reliable technique for micro-
bial growth detection systems with speciﬁc cul-
ture
bottles
(Fig.
36.3).
Currently,
three
automated blood culture systems are approved
and function differently to detect bacteraemia and
fungaemia. The BacT/Alert automated microbial
detection system of bioMerieux, Durham, NC,
uses an internal colorimetric sensor that changes
from grey to yellow in the presence of CO2

produced
by
growing
microorganisms.
BD
Bactec Plus automated microbial detection sys-
tem of BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, uses a
chemical sensor to detect increases in CO2 pro-
duced due to microbial growth. The VersaTREK
automated microbial detection system of TREK
Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH, measures
pressure changes in the sample bottle headspace.

Salmonella and Shigella
Clot Culture
Clot culture is a more sensitive method than the
blood
culture
because
certain
inhibitory
substances found in the serum are absent in the
clot proper.
In this method, 5 mL of blood is collected
under strict aseptic conditions, from the patient,
into a sterile test tube and allowed to clot. The
serum is pipetted off and used for serological
tests. The clot is broken up with a sterile glass
rod and added to a bottle of bile broth containing
streptokinase
(100
units/mL).
Streptokinase
facilitates the lysis of the clot with the release of
bacteria trapped inside the clot. The bile broth is
incubated and sub-cultured on media in the same
way as described for blood culture earlier.
Clot
culture
shows
higher
isolation
of
Salmonellae than the blood culture. Another
advantage of this method is that serum eluted
from the blood during clotting can be used to
demonstrate Salmonella antigens or antibodies.
Bone Marrow Culture
Bone marrow culture is the most sensitive
method. It is positive in most cases, even when
blood cultures are negative. It is also positive
even if patients have been taking antibiotics for
several days, regardless of how long they have
been suffering from enteric fever. This test is
recommended for patients whose initial blood
culture results are negative, possibly due to prior
antibiotic therapy.
Faeces Culture
Faeces culture is also useful because salmonellae
are excreted in faeces throughout the disease and
even during convalescence with varying fre-
quency.
The
faecal
samples
are
inoculated
directly on MacConkey, DCA and Wilson–Blair
media. Relatively, a heavy inoculation of stool is
made on the Wilson–Blair media because it is
highly selective. For enrichment, one tube each
of selenite and tetrathionate broth is inoculated
and incubated for 12–18 h before sub-culture onto
selective media. The plates are incubated at 37 C
overnight.
S.
Typhi
produces
large
black
colonies, with a metallic sheen on the Wilson–
Blair medium. On this medium, S. Paratyphi A
produces green colonies due to the absence of
H2S production. Salmonellae form pale non-
lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey and
DCA media. If no growth is observed after
7 days, the culture is declared negative. Other
specimens for culture: These include urine, bile,
rose spots, pus from suppurative lesions, CSF and
sputum. Cultures may be obtained from the gall-
bladder, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes
at autopsy.
Isolation of the organism from blood, blood
clots or bone marrow is deﬁnitive for the diagno-
sis of enteric fever. Bile culture is useful for the
detection of carriers. Faecal cultures are useful,
but a positive faecal culture may occur in carriers
and inpatients.
Colonies are identiﬁed by carrying out motility
tests, biochemical tests and slide agglutination
with speciﬁc Salmonella antisera.
Slide Agglutination Test
The test is performed by adding a loopful of
typhoid O antiserum (factor 9/group D) to one
drop of bacterial emulsion on the slide. The slide
is rocked gently. Development of immediate
agglutination suggests that Salmonella strain
tested belongs to Salmonella group D. Identity
of S. Typhi is established by agglutination with
the ﬂagellar antiserum (anti-d serum).
Sometimes, fresh isolates of S. Typhi occur in
the V form and do not agglutinate with the O
antiserum. Such strains may be tested for aggluti-
nation against anti-Vi serum. Alternatively, the
growth scraped off in a small amount of saline
is tested for agglutination with the O antiserum
after boiling for 20 min. If the isolate is a
non-typhoidal Salmonella, producing gas from
sugars, it is tested for agglutination with O and
H antisera for groups A, B, C, etc.

Genus Salmonella
527
Serology
Serodiagnosis of enteric fever is based on
detecting speciﬁc Salmonella antibodies in the
serum or antigen in the serum and urine by vari-
ous serological tests.
Widal Test
Traditionally, the Widal test had been used for
diagnosing typhoid fever by demonstration of
serum antibodies. The agglutinating antibodies
against the somatic antigens and the ﬂagellar
(H) antigens of S. Typhi are measured for typhoid
and paratyphoid bacilli in the patient’s sera. This
is a tube agglutination test in which Dreyer nar-
row agglutination tube with a conical bottom is
used for H agglutination and Felix short round-
bottomed tube for O agglutination. The H and O
antigens of S. Typhi and the H antigens of S.
Paratyphi A and B are used in the test. The
paratyphi O antigens are not used because they
cross-react with the typhoid O antigen due to their
sharing of antigenic factor 12. H antigens of S.
Typhi and S. Paratyphi A and B are used individ-
ually because H antigens of these bacteria do not
show any cross-reactivity with each other. S.
Typhi 901, “O” and “H” strains are used to pre-
pare antigen.
The O antigen is prepared by the culture of S.
Typhi on phenol agar (1:800) and harvesting the
growth in a small volume of saline.
The test is performed by taking equal volumes
(0.4 mL) of serial dilutions of the serum (from
1/20 to 1/640) and H antigen of S. Typhi (TH), S.
Paratyphi A (AH), S. Paratyphi B (BH) and O
antigens of S. Typhi (TO) and mixing in Dreyer
tubes and Felix tubes, respectively. The tubes are
then incubated in a water bath at 37 C overnight.
Some recommend incubation at 37 C for 4 h,
followed by overnight incubation at 4 C. The
formation of loose woolly clumps characterises
H agglutination, while O agglutination by a disc-
like pattern at the bottom of the tube. The super-
natant ﬂuid remains clear in both types of
agglutinations. The highest dilution of the serum
showing agglutination with H or O antigens
suggests the antibody titre of the patient’s
serum. The Widal test is positive in enteric fever
in only 40–60% of patients at admission.
The results of the Widal test should be
interpreted, taking into account the followings:
1. Antibodies against H and O antigens usually
appear by the 7th–10th day of the illness and
increase steadily till the third or the fourth
week,
after
which
it
declines
gradually.
Hence, the blood collected before 7–10 days
will be negative for antibodies.
2. Demonstration of a fourfold or more rise in
titre of antibodies in a paired sample, one
sample collected in the ﬁrst week and second
sample is collected in the third week, is more
useful than a demonstration of antibodies in a
single serum.
3. A titre of 1/100 or more for O antibodies and
1/200 or more for H antibodies usually
suggests enteric fever. However, the results
of a single test should be interpreted with
caution. Moreover, it is necessary to obtain
basal antibody titre levels in “normal sera” in
different areas before arriving at a cut off diag-
nostic titre for H and O antibodies.
4. An elevated level of antibodies may be present
in sera of patients suffering from enteric fever
in the past and sera of individuals with inap-
parent infection or vaccination against the
enteric fever. Therefore, the mere demonstra-
tion of antibodies in the Widal test should not
be considered suggestive of enteric fever.
5. Serum from an individual vaccinated with
TAB
vaccine
may
show
high
titres
of
antibodies to S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A and
B. However, in case of infection, high titres of
antibodies will be seen only against the
infecting species. H antibodies persist for
many
months
after
vaccination,
but
O
antibodies disappear earlier within 6 months.
However, in case of infection, high titres of
antibodies will be seen only against the
infecting species.
6. Individuals who had suffered from enteric
infections in the past or who have been
immunised
may
develop
an
anamnestic
response during an unrelated fever, such as
malaria
and
inﬂuenza.
The
anamnestic
response shows only a transient rise of
antibodies, while the antibody rise is sustained
in enteric fever.

The utility of the Widal test, blood culture and
faeces culture for the laboratory diagnosis of
typhoid fever during different periods of the dis-
ease is shown in Fig. 36.4.
Other Antibody-Based Serological Tests
These include indirect ﬂuorescent Vi antibody
and
indirect
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin M (IgM)
and IgG antibodies to S. Typhi polysaccharide
are available for diagnosis of typhoid fever with
varying sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Monoclonal
antibodies against S. Typhi ﬂagellin have been
evaluated to increase the speciﬁcity of the
ELISA for antibodies.
Antigen-Based Serological Tests
These include co-agglutination test and ELISA.
These
are
frequently
employed
to
detect
circulating antigens in the serum and urine to
diagnose typhoid fever with varying sensitivity
and speciﬁcity. In typhoid fever, circulating S.
Typhi antigen is present in the serum and urine
but absent in serum of a cured case of typhoid.
Hence, demonstration of serum antigen always
indicates an active or recent typhoid fever.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently
being evaluated to diagnose typhoid fever. It has
offered rapid detection and differentiation of Sal-
monella serovars directly from the sample with-
out culturing. Primers sets targeting genes, like
viaB, prt, tyv, ﬂiC-d, ﬂiC-a, inv, pefA, sefA, etc.,
are widely used to detect species. The promising
aspect of such molecular detection is the multi-
plex PCR where multiple primers sets could
simultaneously
differentiate
Salmonella
spp.,
like S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis.
Although the process is simple, inexpensive
and sensitive, it requires laboratory setup and
technical expertise that has limited its ﬁeld appli-
cation, especially in resource-limited settings. In
this,
loop-mediated
isothermal
ampliﬁcation
(LAMP) has emerged as a promising tool that
offers a rapid, reliable, sensitive, speciﬁc and
easy molecular diagnostic tool for on-site patho-
gen detection. For example, novel technology,
like triplex LAMP assay, only uses three sets of
primers that only amplify the target genes without
cross-reactivity with non-target genes. It has a
limit of detection of 2.5 pg of S. Typhimurium
DNA
and
takes
60-min
sampling-to-result
turnover time.
Diagnosis of Carriers
The diagnosis of carriers, especially cooks and
food handlers, plays an important role in epide-
miological and public health purposes; therefore,
it is an important aspect of typhoid fever control.
Detection of faecal carriers can be done by
isolating the bacillus from bile or faeces. It is
essential to test repeated samples because the
frequency and intensity of bacillary shedding
vary from individual to individual. Repeated uri-
nary cultures are required for the detection of
urinary
carriers.
The
cholagogue
purgative
increases the chances of isolation of Salmonella.
Detection of antibodies to Vi antigens plays
an important role in the carrier state. Detection

of Vi antibody is not useful in the diagnosis.
Hence, Vi antigens are not being used in the
Widal test. Therefore, the Widal test does not
play any role in carrier detection in endemic
countries.
Genus Salmonella
529
Millipore membranes ﬁltration technique is
also useful in isolating salmonellae from sewage,
in which the membranes are cultured on selective
media, such as Wilson and Blair media.
Typing
Salmonella is typed by various methods as
follows:
Bacteriophage Typing
Bacteriophage typing is the intraspecies classiﬁ-
cation of S. Typhi, ﬁrst developed by Craigie and
Yen (1937). They observed that bacteriophage
acting on the Vi antigen of S. Typhi (Vi phage
II) is highly adaptable. The parent phage is known
as phage A. It could be made speciﬁcally for a
particular strain of S. Typhi by serial propagation
in the strain. Such adaptation was obtained by
phenotypic or genotypic variation.
The phage typing is carried out by determining
the sensitivity of the cultures to a series of
variants of the Vi phase. However, most other
types are sensitive to only one or a few related
adaptions. As phage typing of S. Typhi depends
on the presence of Vi antigens, a proportion of
strains (Vi negative) will be untypable. At pres-
ent, 97 Vi II phage types of S. Typhi are
recognised. S. Typhi phage types E1, O and A is
most common in India.
The phage typing is useful in (1) tracing the
source of epidemics and (2) providing informa-
tion on the trends and patterns of typhoid epide-
miology at the local, national and international
levels. Phage typing schemes have also been
applied to S. Paratyphi A and B, S. Typhimurium,
S. Enteritidis, S. Dublin and other serotypes.
Biotyping
Biotyping is a useful method to classify different
Salmonella strains of a particular serotype into
several
biotypes
by
their
biochemical
characteristics. S. Typhi has been differentiated
into
different
biotypes
based
on
arabinose,
dulcitol and xylose fermentation.
Biotyping is useful for supplementing phage
typing because it subdivides a large number of
untypable strains or members of common phage
types. Conversely, strains of the same biotype
may be reorganised into different phage types.
Therefore, a combination of phage typing and
biotyping provides better discrimination of Sal-
monella strains than either method used alone.
Genotyping
Genotyping methods, such as plasmid ﬁngerprint-
ing, multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis, IS-200
proﬁling and random ampliﬁed polymorphic
DNA analysis, have been employed as more dis-
criminating
methods
for
epidemiological
characterisation
of
Salmonella
in
advanced
centres.
The central research institute of Kasauli at
Himachal Pradesh has the National Salmonella
Reference Centre. Indian Veterinary Research
Institute of Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh, has the Ani-
mal Origin Salmonella Reference Centre. These
reference centres provide services for identifying
unusual
serotypes
and
reconﬁrming
other
serotypes of salmonellae.
Treatment
Chloramphenicol was the antibiotic of choice for
the treatment of enteric fever since its introduc-
tion in 1948. It acts by binding to 50S bacterial-
ribosomal subunits and inhibits bacterial growth
by inhibiting protein synthesis. Because of low
cost, for sensitive S. Typhi strains, chlorampheni-
col is still used to treat typhoid fever. A 14-day
course of chloramphenicol, ampicillin or trimeth-
oprim and sulphamethoxazole is indicated for S.
Typhi infection.
Multidrug-Resistant Salmonella Typhi
Chloramphenicol-resistant S. Typhi causing an
epidemic with high mortality, appeared in Mexico
in 1972, spreading to North America and Europe.
In India, the epidemics of multidrug-resistant S.
Typhi ﬁrst appeared in Calicut (Kerala) in 1972. It
became endemic and was conﬁned to Kerala till
1978.
Subsequently,
such
resistant
strains
appeared in many other parts of India. These

resistant strains were also resistant to streptomy-
cin, sulphadiazine and tetracycline due to a trans-
missible plasmid carrying resistant determinants
to these antibiotics. S. Typhi-resistant strains were
sensitive to amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, ampicil-
lin and furazolidone. However, in the late 1980s,
India reported resistant strains of S. Typhi to
almost all the drugs mentioned above from sev-
eral parts of the country.
530
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Multidrug resistance conferred by the R factor
has become a widespread phenomenon among
salmonellae. The reason for the rapid develop-
ment of multidrug resistance in Salmonella is
considered to be the integron gene cassette sys-
tem. There is a spread of resistance within clinical
strains through horizontal transfer, which is
proved by the presence of the same gene cassette
in different genotypes. Some multidrug-resistant
Salmonella is considered to be an important agent
of hospital infections. Such nosocomial infections
affect
the
neonates
causing
septicaemia,
meningitis and suppurative lesions. Recently,
multidrug-resistant Salmonella causing hospital
outbreaks of neonatal septicaemia has been seen
in India
Fluoroquinolones
(e.g.
ciproﬂoxacin,
peﬂoxacin, norﬂoxacin) and the third-generation
cephalosporins (e.g. ceftazidime, ceftriaxone,
cefotaxime) are the antibiotics of choice for the
treatment of multidrug-resistant S. Typhi. They
are increasingly used for typhoid fever because of
their efﬁcacy and low relapse, and low carrier
rates associated with their use. In addition, the
emergence of domestically acquired ceftriaxone-
resistant Salmonella infections has also been
described.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Enteric fever is endemic in many countries which
have poor sanitary conditions. It is more common
to children of school age or younger.
Typhoid fevers are endemic in the Indian sub-
continent, Southeast and Far East Asia, the Mid-
dle East, Africa, Central America and South
America. Approximately 11–20 million cases of
typhoid fever occur globally each year, with
around 128,000 and 161,000 deaths. Typhoid
fever has been virtually eliminated in developed
countries due to improvements in water supply
and sanitation during the last many decades.
However, climate and increasing antibiotic resis-
tance pose a greater threat to global health safety
and contribute to the rise of the burden of
diseases. Travellers visiting countries, particu-
larly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are suscep-
tible to developing typhoid fever.
Paratyphoid fever continues to be a health
problem in both developing and developed
countries. S. Paratyphi is prevalent in South
America, Eastern Europe and Asia. S. Paratyphi
B is prevalent in Western Europe, Britain and
America.
In
Eastern
Europe
and
Guyana,
Paratyphi C is commonly seen.
Habitat
S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi (A, B and C) are strictly
human pathogens. They are not found in any
other animal hosts. In infected human hosts,
they colonise the small intestine, especially the
ileac
mucosa.
Asymptomatic
long-term
colonisation occurs commonly in infected hosts.
Other salmonellae are parasitic in various
domestic animals, rodents, reptiles and birds. S.
Typhimurium have a wide host range affecting
animals,
birds
and
humans,
Salmonella
Abortusoris in sheep and S. Gallinarum in
poultry.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
The infected patient and, more frequently, carriers
are important reservoirs of infection for enteric
fever.
There are three different types of Salmonella
carriers. Convalescent carriers are the patients
who continue to excrete typhoid bacilli in faeces
for 3 weeks to 3 months after clinical cure. Tem-
porary carriers are those who shed the bacilli for
>3 months but <1 year. Chronic carriers
excrete the bacilli for >1 year. About 2–4% of
patients become chronic carriers. The bacilli per-
sist in the gallbladder and are excreted in faeces
( faecal carrier) or persist in the kidney and are

secreted in the urine (urinary carrier). Urinary
carriers are less frequent than the faecal carriers
and usually present with urinary lesions, such as
calculus or schistosomiasis.
Genus Salmonella
531
The carrier state is more common in women
than in men and older people (over 40 years) than
in young people. Food handlers or cooks who
become carriers are potentially dangerous to the
community. Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), a
New York cook, was a classical case of such a
carrier who, over 15 years, caused at least seven
outbreaks affecting more than 200 persons. The
carrier stage also occurs with S. Paratyphi
infections. S. Paratyphi A infection occurs only
in humans, while S. Paratyphi B infection occurs
in animals, such as dogs or cows.
Human faeces infested with S. Typhi from the
major source of infection by contaminating food,
water and vegetables. Improper personal hygiene
and consumption of contaminated food result in
infections.
There is no animal reservoir for typhoidal
salmonellae. Animal-to-human zoonotic trans-
mission
is
common
in
only
non-typhoidal
salmonellae. Poultry, livestock, reptiles and pets
are the principal reservoirs for non-typhoidal Sal-
monella organisms. Ingestion of improperly
cooked fruits, vegetables, foods of animal origin,
including poultry, red meats, unpasteurised milk
and eggs that infected animals have contaminated
or an infected human is the mode of transmission.
Contact with infected reptiles, such as iguanas,
pet
turtles
and
tortoises
and
ingestion
of
contaminated
water
are
other
modes
of
transmission.
Prevention and Control
Availability of safe drinking water, proper food
hygiene and sanitary disposal of excreta are the
most cost-effective strategies for reducing the
incidence of typhoid fever in endemic countries.
These measures reduce the incidence of typhoid
fever and reduce other enteric infections, which
are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
those areas.
Vaccines
Salmonella
spp.
are
primarily
intracellular
pathogens; hence cell-mediated immunity (CMI)
rather than humoral antibodies play a more
important role in protection against the disease.
CMI develops during the disease and appears to
be common in populations in areas endemic for
typhoid fever. Individuals with depressed CMI
appear to be more susceptible to S. Typhi
infections.
Immunisation with typhoid vaccines at regular
intervals also considerably reduces the incidence
of typhoidal Salmonella infections. Two types of
typhoid vaccines, such as killed or inactivated
vaccine and oral vaccine, are administered.
Killed or Inactivated Vaccines
1. TAB Vaccine TAB vaccine is a complete cell
inactivated vaccine containing 0.5% phenol
preserved, heat-killed S. Typhi 1000 million
per ml and 750 million per mL of each S.
Paratyphi A and B. Administration of the vac-
cine
is
done
sub-cutaneously
in
two
subsequent doses of 0.5 mL each and is
given within an interval of 4–6 weeks, which
is then continued as a booster dose for every
3 years. The overall efﬁciency of 70–90% has
been shown through ﬁeld trials in typhoid
fever for the span of 3–7 years. There are two
concerns about this vaccine: fever and pain at
the injection site, and a larger volume of anti-
gen needs to be injected. Due to these concerns
in India, the trivalent TAB vaccine has been
replaced by a divalent typhoid-paratyphoid A
vaccine
without
S.
Paratyphi
B
because
infections from paratyphi are uncommon here.
2. Vi
Capsular
Polysaccharide
Antigen
Vaccine (VPS) The ViCPS antigen prepara-
tion involves S. Typhi isolated from blood
cultures, and this vaccine contains puriﬁed Vi
antigen and capsular polysaccharide. A single
parental
dose
of
0.5
mL
of
ViCPS
is
administered
as
primary
vaccination.
If
continued exposure to S. Typhi is expected,
booster doses are required every 2 years to
ensure protection. Two ﬁeld trials showed
50–64%
overall
protection
rates
in

532
36
Salmonella and Shigella
South Africa and 72% in Nepal, the areas
endemic for the disease. Fever, headache, ery-
thema and induration are some of the side
effects. The vaccine is not recommended for
children below 2 years.
Oral Vaccines
1. Ty21a
Oral
Vaccine
This
oral
vaccine
contains live attenuated strains of S. Typhi. It
has an enteric-coated capsule, and this mutant
strain lacks the enzyme UDP-galactose-4-
epimerase.
Upon
ingestion vaccine
starts
infection; however, after a few cell divisions
(4–5), it results in self-destruction. Hence, it
cannot induce illness. The vaccine is believed
to induce intestinal and serum antibodies with
cell-mediated immune responses. Neverthe-
less, the mechanism is not completely known.
Ty21a primary vaccination contains a single
enteric-coated capsule. It is administered on
alternate days with a cycle of four capsules.
If there is continued exposure, then booster
doses are required once every 5 years to pro-
tect from infection. The capsules have to be
stored at four C in a refrigerator, and all four
doses must be taken to obtain complete
efﬁciency.
This oral vaccine may not be advised to be
administered
for
immunocompromised
individuals, such as HIV-infected individuals
and infants.
Salmonella Gastroenteritis
Salmonella Gastroenteritis or food poisoning is
the most common form of salmonellosis. The
condition is generally a zoonotic disease caused
by certain species of non-typhoidal salmonellae,
which
are
primarily
animal
pathogens.
S.
Typhimurium is the most common species caus-
ing the disease in many parts of the world. Other
common species include S. Enteritidis, Salmo-
nella Hadar, Salmonella Heidelberg, S. Agona,
Salmonella Virchow, Salmonella Senftenberg,
Salmonella Indiana, Salmonella Newport and S.
Anatum.
Human infection usually occurs through the
consumption of contaminated foods. The most
common sources of salmonellae are milk and
milk products, meat, poultry and eggs. Of great
concern are eggs and egg products. Salmonellae
can enter the shell if eggs are left on contaminated
chicken
feed
or
faeces
and
grow
inside.
Droppings of rats, lizards or other small animals
may also cause food contamination. Improperly
prepared fruits, vegetables, dairy products and
shellﬁsh may cause infection if contaminated
with manure or unhygienic handling.
The incubation period is 6–72 h. Nausea,
vomiting and loose, watery stools are the com-
mon
symptoms.
Fever,
abdominal
cramps,
myalgias
and headaches
are
also
common.
Fever, which rarely exceeds 39 C, occurs in
approximately
one-half
of
infected
patients.
Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously in
2–7 days.
Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating
the salmonellae from the faeces by culture. In
food
poisoning
outbreaks,
isolation
of
salmonellae from the food conﬁrms the diagnosis.
Uncomplicated, non-invasive salmonellosis is
treated symptomatically. Antimicrobial therapy is
not indicated because it does not shorten the
duration of illness. However, for serious invasive
cases,
antibiotic
treatment
is
recommended.
Treatment with antibiotics is recommended for
Salmonella
Gastroenteritis
in
infants
below
3 months and infants below 12 months with
high fever and unknown blood culture results. It
is also recommended for patients with haemoglo-
binopathies, HIV infection or other causes of
immunosuppression, neoplasms or chronic GI
illnesses.
Ampicillin,
amoxicillin,
trimethoprim–
sulphamethoxazole, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone
effectively treat the condition.
Salmonella Septicaemia
All Salmonella spp. can cause septicaemia. How-
ever, S. Choleraesuis, S. Paratyphi and S. Typhi
more commonly cause a bacteraemic disease.
Paediatric and geriatric patients and patients

with
AIDS
are
increasingly
susceptible
to
suffering from Salmonella Bacteraemia.
Genus Shigella
533
The clinical presentations of S. Septicaemia
are
like
that
of
another
Gram-negative
septicaemia.
However,
localised
suppurative
infections, such as osteomyelitis, deep abscesses,
endocarditis, arthritis and meningitis, can occur in
as many as 10% of patients. The case fatality may
be as high as 25%.
Diagnosis of the condition is made by isolating
salmonellae from the blood or the pus from the
suppurative lesion and rarely from faeces.
Case Study
A 35-year-old adult was admitted to the hospital
with a high fever (>101
F), headache and
abdominal symptoms for the last 10 days. He
gave a history of abdominal discomfort with diar-
rhoea. A local doctor had examined the patient
4 days back and had given a course of chloro-
quine to treat malaria, but the patient did not show
any sign of improvement. A battery of tests was
carried out to rule out typhoid fever.

Genus Shigella
Shigella is the most common cause of bacillary
dysentery, which occurs worldwide. The disease
is spread through faecal-oral transmission, and
humans are the only natural reservoir of the
bacteria. Human infections caused by Shigella
species are summarised in Table 36.5.

Bacteria
Diseases
Shigella species
Shigellosis, bacillary dysentery, asymptomatic carriage and haemolytic uraemic syndrome
Classification
Based on a combination of biochemical and sero-
logical characteristics, Shigellae are classiﬁed
into four species or subgroups, consisting of
more than 45 O antigen-based serogroups and
each species consisting of different serotypes.
Shigella dysenteriae (subgroup A): This is
subdivided into 12 serotypes. Each serotype
is characterised by the presence of a different
type of antigen. S. dysenteriae serotype 1 is the
bacillus originally described by Shiga, hence
known as Shiga’s bacillus. Serotype 1 is indole
negative, and this is the only serotype to be
always
catalase
positive
in
this
family.
S. dysenteriae serotypes 3–7 were described
by Large and Sachs in India and hence were
known as the Large–Sachs group.
Shigella ﬂexneri (subgroup B): This group is
named after Flexner (1900), who described
the ﬁrst mannitol-fermenting shigellae from
the Philippines. S. ﬂexneri, based on type-
speciﬁc
(I–VI)
and
group-speciﬁc
(1–8)
antigens,
have
been
classiﬁed
into
six
serotypes (1–6) and several subtypes (1a, 1b;
2a, 2b; 3a, 3b, 3c; 4a, 4b; 5a, 5b).
Shigella boydii (subgroup C): This group is
named after Boyd, who ﬁrst described these
strains
from
India
(1931).
A
total
of
19 serotypes have been identiﬁed in this
group. Members of the S. boydii group resem-
ble biochemically, but not antigenically, with
those of S. ﬂexneri.
Shigella sonnei (subgroup D): This group is
named after Sonne, who ﬁrst described these
strains from Denmark (1915). S. sonnei have
been divided into 26 colicin types using
33 indicator strains.

Salmonella and Shigella
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Shigella are short Gram-negative rods about
0.5  1–3 μm in size. They are non-motile,
non-sporing
and
non-capsulated.
Except
for
S. ﬂexneri serotype 6 and some strains of other
serotypes, Shigella species possess ﬁmbriae.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Shigella are aerobes and facultative anaerobes.
They grow at an optimum temperature of 37 C
and pH 7.4.
Nutrient Agar
They grow on nutrient agar or Mueller–Hinton
agar.
After
overnight
incubation,
Shigella
colonies on nutrient agar are small, circular, con-
vex, smooth, and translucent. Occasionally on
primary isolation and frequently in sub-cultures,
a proportion of the colonies may be of the
rough type.
MacConkey Agar
Shigella spp. on MacConkey agar produce non-
lactose-fermenting
pale,
colourless
colonies.
However, S. sonnei (which ferments lactose late)
forms
pale
pink
colonies
on
prolonged
incubation.
Deoxycholate Citrate Agar (DCA), Xylose
Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD) Agar, Salmonella–
Shigella (SS) Agar and Hektoen Enteric (HE)
DCA, XLD agar, SS agar and HE agar are fre-
quently used selective media for the isolation of
Shigella species. DCA is a useful selective
medium for isolating Shigella spp. from faeces.
On this medium, Shigella spp. produce small
colonies, which on prolonged incubation produce
lactose-fermenting pink colonies. XLD agar is
another selective medium, which is less inhibitory
to S. dysenteriae and S. ﬂexneri. Shigella spp.
forms red colonies on this medium. Shigella
spp. on SS agar form colourless colonies. Shigella
spp. on HE agar forms green colonies.

Selenite F and Gram-Negative (GN) Broth
Selenite F and GN broth are commonly used
enrichment media. Enrichment of faeces in GN
broth for 4–6 h followed by sub-culture on XLD
or HE medium is useful for isolating Shigella
from clinical specimens.
Shigella ferments mannitol, forming acid but
no gas. The mannitol fermentation test is an
important biochemical test used to classify
shigellae
into
mannitol-fermenting
and
non-fermenting species. S. ﬂexneri, S. boydii and
S.
sonnei
are
mannitol-fermenting
species,
whereas
S.
dysenteriae
is
mannitol-non-
fermenting species. However, exceptions are not
that uncommon. The biochemical characteristics
useful for distinguishing different Shigella spe-
cies are listed in Table 36.6.
They
are
catalase
positive
except
for
S. dysenteriae type 1, which is catalase negative.
They are MR positive, citrate negative and oxi-
dase negative.
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
agents
Shigellae are killed at a temperature of 55 C in
1 h or by 1% phenol in 30 min. In faeces, they die





within a few hours due to acidity produced by the
growth of intestinal bacteria. They remain viable
in moist environments for days but die rapidly on
drying. S. sonnei is, in general, more resistant to
unfavourable environmental conditions than the
other Shigella species.

Antigenic structure
Other Properties
The antigenic structure of shigellae is simple,
unlike
the
complex
antigenic
structure
of
salmonellae.
Shigellae
possess
somatic
O
antigens, and certain strains possess K antigens.
Shigella K antigens, when present, may some-
times interfere with agglutination by O antisera.
Shigellae strains also possess ﬁmbrial antigens.
Common ﬁmbrial antigens are also found, partic-
ularly in S. ﬂexneri.
S. ﬂexneri is biochemically heterogeneous and
antigenically the most complex among shigellae.
Two antigenic variants, called X and Y, which
lack
the
type-speciﬁc
antigens,
are
also
recognised in addition to this. S. ﬂexneri serotype
6 is always indole negative and is classiﬁed into
three
biotypes:
Boyd
88,
Manchester
and
Newcastle (Table 36.7).
S. sonnei is antigenically homogeneous but
may occur in two forms: phase I and phase
II. Phase I strains produce smooth colonies,
whereas phase II colonies form large, ﬂat and
more irregular colonies. Cultures contain a
mixture of both forms. Usually, phase II strains
are isolated more frequently from convalescing
cases and from carriers than from patients.

Pathogenesis
Virulence in Shigella species involves both chro-
mosomal-
and
plasmid-coded
genes,
which
express many virulence factors (Table 36.8).
Virulence Factors
Intestinal Adherence Factor
Intestinal adherence factor is a 97 kDa outer
membrane protein encoded by each gene on
chromosomes. This mediates the colonisation of
Shigella spp. in infected human hosts and animal
models.
Endotoxins
The cell wall of shigellae, like other Gram-
negative bacilli, contains a lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) structure. The LPS is liberated during
lysis of the cell and, to some extent, during cul-
ture. The LPS moiety functions as endotoxin and
is an important component of the virulence of the
bacteria. It plays an important role in the resis-
tance of Shigella to non-speciﬁc host defence
encountered during tissue invasion. The toxin
helps in the invasion, multiplication and resis-
tance of Shigella to phagocytosis by tissue
macrophages. It also increases the cytotoxic

activity of Shiga toxin on human vascular endo-
thelial cells. Chromosomal genes of the bacteria
express the endotoxin.
536
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Shiga Toxin
Shiga
toxin
is
an
exotoxin
produced
by
S. dysenteriae. It is a heat-labile protein and acts
as enterotoxin and neurotoxin. Shiga toxin (Stx)
is a group of cytotoxins that contain two major
immunologically
non-cross-reactive
groups
called Stx1 and Stx2. Both Stx1 and Stx2 groups
are encoded by a bacteriophage inserted into the
bacteria’s chromosome. Stx1 groups of toxins can
be found in S. sonnei and type 4 S. dysenteriae.
Stx1c and Stx1d are the two variants of the Stx1
toxin. Stx1c and Stx1d are rarely found in human
disease and are linked with a mild disease course.
Shiga toxins have one A subunit and ﬁve B
subunits. Subunit A is a 32-kDa polypeptide. The
mature A subunit of Stx1 and Stx2 consists of
293 and 297 amino acids, respectively, wherein
the active site of the toxin is the glutamic acid
(position
167).
Intrinsic
enzymatic
activity
cleaves the A subunit asymmetrically into an A1
subunit, and A2 peptide held together by a
disulphide bridge. It cleaves the 28SrRNA in the
60S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing the
binding
of
aminoacyl-transfer
RNA
and
disrupting protein synthesis.
The B subunits of Stx1 and Stx2 consist of
69 and 71 amino acids, respectively. The main
function of the B subunit is to bind toxins to the
host cell glycolipid (Gb3) surface receptor, pres-
ent on the brush border of the epithelial cell of the
intestines. It also mediates the transfer of the A
subunit into the cell.
The Shiga toxin shows three types of toxic
activities:
1. Neurotoxic activity: Although called neuro-
toxin, the primary site of its action is not the
neural tissue but is the blood vessels, neuro-
logical manifestations being secondary.
2. Enterotoxic
activity:
These
toxins
are
enterotoxic
for
ligated
rabbit
intestinal
segments with induction of ﬂuid accumulation
in ligated rabbit ileal loop. Two new Shigella
enterotoxins, designated as S. ET-l and S. ET-
2—the former conﬁned to S. ﬂexneri 2a and
the
latter
more
widespread—have
been
identiﬁed.
3. Cytotoxic activity: This is demonstrated by
cytotoxicity of toxin for Vero, HeLa and some
selected endothelial cells, such as human renal
vascular endothelial cells. This appears to be
the same as verotoxin 1 (or Shiga-like toxin)
produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli
(VTEe). The ability of the bacillus to penetrate
cultured HeLa or HEp-2 cells or by the Congo
red binding test is used to demonstrate inva-
siveness of the bacillus. The bacillus, which is
invasive,
has
a
large
plasmid
(M.W. 140  106) which codes for an outer
membrane protein. This protein is responsible
for cell penetration. These proteins are termed
as “Virulence marker antigens” (VMA). VMA
can be detected by ELISA, which is a viru-
lence test for Shigellae, the same as for
enteroinvasive E. coli.
The primary manifestation of Shiga toxin is
damage to the intestinal epithelium of the infected
host, causing diarrhoea and dysentery. However,
Shiga toxin can mediate damage to the glomeru-
lar endothelial cells in a few patients, resulting in
haemolytic urinary syndrome.
Pathogenesis of Bacillary Dysentery
Shigella species are not zoonotic pathogens. It
causes
natural
infections
in
humans
and
non-human primates. However, in rare and
unique
cases,
zoonotic
transmission
of
organisms,
like
S.
ﬂexneri,
S.
sonnei
and
S. dysenteriae, from other laboratory research
animals has been recorded.
Shigella spp. produces a serious disease
known as bacillary dysentery. The infection is
acquired by the faecal-oral route by hand-to-
mouth infection through contaminated ﬁngers. It
is also caused by ingestion of food and water
contaminated with human faeces containing Shi-
gella spp. The infectivity dose (ID) is extremely
low. As few as 10 S. dysenteriae bacilli can cause
clinical disease, whereas 100–200 bacilli are
needed for S. sonnei or S. ﬂexneri infection.

Fig. 36.5 Schematic diagram showing pathogenesis of
bacillary dysentery
Shigella spp. cause bacillary dysentery by
invading and replicating in cells lining the intesti-
nal mucosa of the colon. Structural proteins, such
as intestinal adhesion factor, endotoxin and exo-
toxin, mediate the adherence of the bacteria to the
cells as well as their invasion, intracellular repli-
cation and cell-to-cell spread. The bacilli infect
the epithelial cells of the villi in the large intestine
and multiply inside them. Subsequently, bacteria
spread laterally to involve adjacent cells and pen-
etrate the lamina propria (Fig. 36.5). Shigellae
lyse the phagocytic vacuole and multiply in the
host
cell
cytoplasm.
Shigellae
survive
phagocytosis
by
inducing
programmed
cell
death or apoptosis. Shiga toxin produced by the
bacteria also plays an important role in the pro-
gression of mucosal lesions after the invasion of
the colonic cells. The toxin also induces vascular
damage in the colonic mucosa. Mucosal oedema,
erythema, friability, superﬁcial ulceration and
focal
mucosal
haemorrhage
involving
the
rectosigmoid junction are the typical pathological
features primarily observed in the condition.
Clinical Syndromes
Shigella spp. causes shigellosis, a clinical syn-
drome encompassing the whole spectrum of dis-
ease caused by the bacteria. S. sonnei may cause
only mild diarrhoea. S. ﬂexneri and S. boydii
cause more severe illness than that caused by
S. sonnei.
Bacillary dysentery is a severe clinical form of
shigellosis. The incubation period is usually
short. It varies from 12 h to 7 days, usually
48 h, and is inversely related to a load of ingested
bacilli. Bacillary dysentery is an acute gastroin-
testinal illness manifested by fever, vomiting,
abdominal cramps and tenesmus. The condition
manifests with a sudden onset of high-grade fever
along with abdominal cramp, tenesmus, urgency
and passage of loose, scanty faeces containing
frank blood and mucus.
Complications are most often associated with
S. dysenteriae type-1 infection. These include
arthritis, toxic neuritis, conjunctivitis and in chil-
dren intussusception. Haemolytic uraemic syn-
drome may also occur following infection with
S. dysenteriae because of vasculopathy mediated
by Shiga toxin. In a few patients, the asymptom-
atic colonisation of shigellae occurs in the colon,
making the patient a persistent reservoir for
infection.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
The stool is the specimen of choice. Fresh faeces
are inoculated without delay or transported in a

suitable medium, such as Sachs buffered glycerol
saline, pH 7.0–7.4. Also, rectal swabs may be
taken from the ulcer site by sigmoidoscopy. How-
ever, rectal swabs that do not contain a copious
stool volume or mucus are not satisfactory.
538
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Microscopy
Routine microscopy of stool may reveal clumps
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Faecal blood
or leukocytes are detectable in the stool in
approximately 70% of cases of shigellosis.
Culture and Identification
Diagnosis of shigellosis is made by isolating Shi-
gella spp. from faeces by culture. For enrichment,
one tube each of selenite F and GN broth are
inoculated and incubated at 37 C for 12–18 h
before sub-culture onto selective media. Usually,
more than one stool or rectal swab is collected
and inoculated immediately on at least two differ-
ent culture media, such as MacConkey, XLD,
DCA or eosin-methylene blue agars. After over-
night incubation, Shigella produces pale non-
lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey and
DCA media, red colonies on XLD medium and
colourless colonies on SS agar.
Pale
non-lactose-fermenting
colonies
on
MacConkey agar are identiﬁed by carrying out
motility tests, biochemical tests, such as manifold
fermentation tests, and slide agglutination tests
with speciﬁc Shigella antisera (polyvalent and
monovalent sera).
Serology
Serological tests are not useful in the diagnosis of
shigellosis.
Molecular Detection
For the limitations in the classical culture-based
diagnosis of Shigella, molecular technologies,
like PCR and real-time PCR assays, multiplex,
pentaplex PCRs, have emerged as a promising
tools for bacterial identiﬁcation. Such PCRs gen-
erally target the invasion plasmid H (ipaH) gene,
O antigen synthesis genes and the 16S rRNA
gene for detection of Shigella spp. ipaH gene
that code for invasion-associated plasmid antigen
are present in multiple copies in both the
chromosomes and the plasmids of all Shigella
species and are considered hallmark genes for
detecting all Shigella strains. Pentaplex PCR has
been found promising for detecting the genus
Shigella, in addition to separating clinically
important Shigella spp., namely, S. ﬂexneri,
S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae.
However, considering difﬁculties associated
with running PCR in resource-poor regions
because
of
the
requirement
of
specialised
laboratories, trained personnel, complicated appa-
ratus
and
expensive
reagents,
LAMP–based
methodology targeting ipaH gene has shown
greater promises.
Molecular Typing
Many genetic investigations on different isolates
of a species of Shigella have indicated striking
diversity at gene levels. It was reported within the
four epidemics causing S. ﬂexneri isolates when
analysed using pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) or for IS1 and IS2 patterns. Likewise,
completely different DNA proﬁles were also
revealed within S. dysenteriae isolates. Such
clonal differentiation leads to varying degrees of
disease outcome within a species and has poten-
tial usefulness in the molecular epidemiology of
Shigella strains.
To determine such clonal diversity, molecular
techniques, such as
ribotyping, PFGE,
and
PCR-based methods, have been extensively used
for Shigella. PFGE being the “gold standard” in
molecular typing and MLVA (multi-locus vari-
able number of tandem repeat analysis) are the
most widely used tools for Shigella typing.
In conclusion, both PFGE and IS probing
demonstrated their potential usefulness in molec-
ular epidemiology and typing of Shigella strains.
The degree of differentiation given by these two
methods was generally comparable, although IS
probes showed better discrimination of the
isolates.
Treatment
Uncomplicated shigellosis is a self-limited condi-
tion, and patients usually recover spontaneously
in
a
few
days.
Hence,
no
antibiotics
are
recommended
for
these
cases.
Antibiotic

treatment for Shigella infection is recommended
(1) for severe or toxic cases and (2) for the very
young, debilitated and aged individuals. Antibi-
otic treatment is recommended to decrease the
duration of illness, person-to-person spread and
cases in household contacts.
Genus Shigella
539
Trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole,
ampicil-
lin, tetracycline and the quinolones, such as
nalidixic acid and ciproﬂoxacin, are frequently
used
antibiotics.
Trimethoprim–
sulphamethoxazole is very effective for shigello-
sis. The antibiotic sulphamethoxazole is a com-
petitive inhibitor of para-aminobenzoic
acid
(PABA) and trimethoprim, reversibly inhibits
dihydrofolate reductase, preventing nucleic acid
biosynthesis in Shigella by producing a sequen-
tial blockade in the folic acid synthesis pathway.
This is the drug of choice when the antibiotic
susceptibility of the bacteria is not known. How-
ever, ampicillin is still the drug of choice if Shi-
gella isolate is susceptible to this drug.
Antibiotics-resistant Shigella
Multiple-antibiotics-resistant plasmids are widely
prevalent
in
Shigella
sp.
and
were
ﬁrst
documented in Japan during the early 1950s.
About half of the strains reported worldwide has
been found to be resistant to multiple drugs. Most
of these strains were resistant to streptomycin,
chloramphenicol and sulphonamides. Shigella
employs various mechanisms for drug resistance,
including drugs extrusion by active efﬂux pumps,
decrease in cellular permeability, overexpression
of drug-modifying and/ or -inactivating enzymes,
etc. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has wors-
ened the problem. Hence, it is essential to treat
the cases of shigellosis with the results of in vitro
antibiotic susceptibility testing of Shigella.
In an alternative to control drug-resistant Shi-
gella, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) and phage
therapy is emerging as promising approaches.
The use of copper oxide NPs and nanoantibiotic
formulations have been used successfully to con-
trol Shigella. In contrast, phage therapy for Shi-
gella was discovered by a French microbiologist,
d’Herelle. It showed high speciﬁcity in killing
Shigella with fewer side effects.
Epidemiology
Shigellosis occurs worldwide. It is a common
cause of bacterial diarrhoea or dysentery. It has
been found that as few as 10 to 100 organisms can
cause disease to humans. An estimated 180 mil-
lion cases of Shigella diarrhoea or dysentery
occur annually worldwide, including 164,000
associated deaths. The incidence of shigellosis
in developing countries is nearly 20 times more
than in developed countries due to poor sanitary
conditions. In developed nations, incidences of
sporadic food or water-borne outbreaks have
been reported.
Global epidemiological data suggest that 99%
of
all
shigellosis
is
present
in
developing
countries, with northern Africa having the highest
disease burden. The US, Europe and Australia
have the lowest incidences. S. ﬂexneri is the
most prevalent serotype worldwide and is abun-
dant in Africa and South and East Asia. S. sonnei
is predominant in the US and Europe.
Geographical Distribution
Shigellosis is worldwide in distribution but shows
many variations epidemiologically between the
nature and extent of the infection in the industri-
ally advanced and developing and poor countries.
Endemic shigellosis is found in all age groups and
is caused by all species in developing countries
where environmental sanitation is poor.
Habitat
Shigella species are strictly human pathogens.
They are found in the large intestine of infected
human hosts. They are not found in any other
animal hosts.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Infected patients or, less often, carriers are
reservoirs of infections for shigellosis. Chronic
carriage is rare because the bacilli are not excreted
in faeces within a few weeks, except in some
malnourished children or patients with AIDS.
Shigellosis is transmitted by the faecal-oral
route
by
hand-to-mouth
infection
through

contaminated ﬁngers. Because as few as 10–200
bacilli can cause disease, shigellosis spreads rap-
idly in areas where sanitary standards and the
level of personal hygiene are low. It is also trans-
mitted
by
ingestion
of
food
and
water
contaminated with human faeces containing Shi-
gella spp. The condition is transmitted less fre-
quently by fomites, such as door handles, water
taps, lavatory seats and sexually among young
male homosexuals due to oro-anal contact. Flies
may transmit the infection as mechanical vectors.
540
36
Salmonella and Shigella
Shigellosis is primarily a disease of children.
Nearly 70% of all infections occur in children
younger than 15 years. Shigella infection in mal-
nourished children often causes a vicious cycle of
further impaired nutrition, recurrent infection and
further growth retardation. Endemic disease in
adults is common in household contacts of
infected children and male homosexuals.
Prevention and Control
In developed countries, person-to-person trans-
mission is the most common source of infection.
Water contaminated with human excreta is the
most common source of infection. Therefore,
control consists essentially in improving personal
and environmental sanitation. Antibiotics are not
used in prophylaxis. No effective vaccine is
available.
Case Study
A 7-year-old child was admitted to the causality
for treatment of bloody diarrhoea and abdominal
pain for 48 h. Her mother gave a history of her
child vomiting a few times and mentioned that
she developed these symptoms after eating at a
fast-food counter. Sigmoidoscopy showed muco-
sal erythema petechiae with pus but no ulcer.

Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella
37
Earlier, the plague bacillus and many other Gram-
negative, short bacilli that are primary pathogens
of rodents were included in the genus Pasteurella.
This group has been divided into three genera:
Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella.
Genus Yersinia
The genus Yersinia is now included in the tribe
Yersinieae in the family Enterobacteriaceae and
includes 11 species, 3 of which are pathogenic in
humans. Human infections caused by Yersinia
species are summarised in Table 37.1.
Yersinia pestis
The plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, was one of
the most devastating diseases in history. In the
early twentieth century, plague epidemics were
responsible for about ten million deaths in India.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Y. pestis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that
measures 1.5–30.7 μm in size, with rounded
ends and convex sides. The bacilli are arranged
in single, in pairs or short chains and are motile at
22 C. Pleomorphism is very common. Giemsa or
methylene
blue-stained
smears
of
clinical
specimens show characteristic bipolar staining
(safety pin appearance) with both ends densely
stained and a clear central area of the bacteria.
Y. pestis is a capsulated bacterium, catalase posi-
tive and coagulase positive.

Culture and Biochemical Properties
Y. pestis is aerobic and facultatively anaerobic. It
grows at a temperature range of 2–45 C with an
optimum temperature of 27 C (unlike most bac-
teria), but it grows better at 37 C in culture. The
bacteria grow at a wide range of pH (5–9.6), with
an optimum pH of 7.2.
Y. pestis can grow on various media, including
Mueller–Hinton agar, nutrient agar, blood agar
and
MacConkey
agar.
On
nutrient
agar,
Y. pestis produces small, delicate and transparent
colonies becoming opaque on prolonged incuba-
tion. Blood agar containing sodium azide (7 μg/
mL) is a selective medium for Y. pestis. On blood
agar, it produces dark-brown colonies due to the
absorption of the haemin pigment. The bacteria
grow
poorly
on
MacConkey
agar
and
deoxycholate citrate agar, producing pinpoint
reddish colonies after 24 h of incubation.
In broth, Y. pestis produces a ﬂocculent growth
with granular deposit at the bottom and along the
sides of the tube, with little or no turbidity. On
prolonged incubation, a delicate pellicle may
form at the surface. Y. pestis produces a charac-
teristic growth when grown in a ﬂask of broth
with oil or ghee (clariﬁed butter) ﬂoated on top
(ghee broth). The growth in the medium appears

Geographical distribution
to hang down into the broth from the surface,
resembling stalactites (stalactite growth). Bio-
chemical reactions of the bacteria are listed in
Table 37.2.

Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Y. pestis is sensitive to heat, sunlight, drying and
chemical disinfectants. The bacilli are killed at a
temperature of 55 C in 30 min. They are also
killed rapidly by disinfectants, such as 0.5% phe-
nol in 15 min. The bacilli remain viable for long
periods in sealed agar slopes, frozen tissue and
cold and moist environments, such as in the soil
of rodent burrows. A speciﬁc antiplague bacteri-
ophage lyses all strains at 22 C.
Antigenic Structure
Y. pestis is antigenically homologous; hence no
serotypes are present. Y. pestis possess major
antigens such as V and W antigens and F1 enve-
lope antigens, which are of importance in the
pathogenesis of the disease.

Pathogenesis
Y. pestis is a highly virulent bacterium that causes
plague with a high mortality rate. The ability of
Yersinia species to resist phagocytic killing is the
hallmark of the pathogenesis of plague. Serum
resistance and the ability of the bacilli to absorb
organic iron as a result of a siderophore-
independent mechanism further contribute to the
pathogenesis of the disease.
Virulence Factors
Y. pestis produces many toxins and enzymes, all
of which contribute to the pathogenesis of the
diseases. Virulence factors of Y. pestis like that
of Salmonella are complex. These are encoded
both on the organism’s chromosome and on large
plasmids (Table 37.3).
Plague Toxin
It refers to a complex of at least two different
types of toxins, endotoxin and murine toxin,
found in culture ﬁltrates or cell lysates. The endo-
toxin is a lipopolysaccharide found in the cell
wall and is responsible for many of the systemic

manifestations of the disease caused by Y. pestis.
Murine toxins exhibit some properties of both
exotoxins and endotoxins. It is a heat-labile pro-
tein. The toxins may be toxoided but do not
diffuse freely into the medium and are released
only by the lysis of the cell. The toxin is patho-
genic in rats and mice but not in guinea pigs,
rabbits, humans and other primates. In experi-
mental animal infections, the murine toxins pro-
duce local oedema and necrosis with systemic
effects on the peripheral vascular system and
liver. The role of murine toxins in the pathogene-
sis of plague in humans is unknown.

F1 Envelope Antigen (Fraction I or F–I
Antigen)
It is a major virulence factor. It is a heat-labile
envelope protein generally present only in viru-
lent strains. The antigen is formed in the in-vivo
and in-vitro culture of virulent strains at 37 C.
Production of the F–I antigen is mediated by a
plasmid. The antigen inhibits phagocytosis and
plays an important role in conferring protective
immunity in humans and mice. The antibody to
F–I antigen is protective in mice.
V and W Antigens
These two antigens are always present together,
and a plasmid mediates their production. V anti-
gen is a protein of molecular weight 90 kDa,
while W antigen is an acidic 145 kDa lipoprotein.
These proteins are produced by virulent strains of
Y. pestis when grown at 37 C in the presence of a
low concentration of calcium. These two antigens
inhibit phagocytosis and intracellular killing of
the bacillus inside macrophages.
TTSS
TTSS consists of many proteins, which facilitate
the secretion of virulence factors of Y. pestis into
host cells. The TTSS mediates the ability of the
pathogenic Yersinia species to resist phagocytic
killing. The TTSS also inhibits the production of
cytokines, reducing the inﬂammatory immune
response to infection.
Other Virulence Factors
Yersinia produces the enzymes, such as coagu-
lase,
ﬁbrinolysin
and
pIa
protease,
which
contributes to the virulence of the bacterium.
For example, enzyme pIa protease degrades C3b
and C5a components of the complement, thereby
preventing opsonisation and phagocytic migra-
tion, respectively. The enzyme also degrades
ﬁbrin clots, thereby facilitating Y. pestis to spread
rapidly. The virulence of the bacterium is
enhanced further by its ability to absorb organic
iron as a result of a siderophore-independent
mechanism.
Pathogenesis of Plague
Y. pestis causes plague, which occurs in three
forms: bubonic plague, pneumonic plague and
septicaemic plague.
Bubonic Plague
This is a zoonotic disease transmitted by rat ﬂea
Xenopsylla cheopis from animals to humans.
Y. pestis is a natural parasite of rodents; infection
is transmitted and maintained among them by rat
ﬂeas. The ﬂeas acquire the infection by feeding
on infected rodents. When a rat ﬂea bites an
infected and diseased rat, it sucks nearly 0.5 mL

of blood per feed containing nearly 5,000–50,000
plague bacilli. In the ﬂea’s stomach, the bacilli
multiply to such an extent that they block the
proventriculus and prevent food entry into the
stomach. The interval between the ingestion of
infected blood and blocking in the proventriculus
is referred to as the extrinsic incubation period,
which varies from 2 to 3 weeks in X. cheopis.
544
37
Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella
The blocked ﬂea, to overcome starvation,
begins a blood-sucking rampage by biting other
rodents. Between its attempts to swallow, the
distended
bacillus-packed
stomach
recoils,
depositing the bacilli into the victim’s skin,
thereby transmitting the infection (blocked ﬂea
phenomenon). When the diseased rat dies, the
ﬂeas leave the carcass and, in the absence of
another rat, may bite humans, causing bubonic
plague.
The bubonic plague is characterised by the
pathognomonic bubo (bubon meaning groin).
The disease occurs following the bite of rat ﬂea,
depositing thousands of bacilli into the host’s skin
during blood meals. The bacilli migrate to the
regional
lymph
nodes,
where
they
are
phagocytosed by the polymorphonuclear cells
and mononuclear phagocytes and multiply intra-
cellularly. The subsequent spread of bacteria
occurs along the lymphatic channels towards the
thoracic duct, with the eventual distribution of the
bacteria in circulation leading to bacteraemia and
septicaemia. In the absence of speciﬁc therapy,
the bacteria potentially infect every organ, includ-
ing the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and rarely
even the meninges.
Pneumonic Plague
This is transmitted from human to human. It
occurs following direct inhalation of the bacilli
by droplet infection due to close contact with
infected hosts or by inhalation of aerosolised bac-
teria, which may occur if used as a biological
weapon. The bacilli spread through the lungs,
producing a severe and rapidly progressive
multi-lobar
bronchopneumonia,
subsequently
leading to bacteraemia and septicaemia. It is not
a zoonotic disease.
Septicaemic Plague
This is usually the terminal stage of the bubonic
or pneumonic plague. It may sometimes occur
primarily.
Primary
septicaemic
plague
may
occur when the plague bacilli are deposited
directly
in
the
circulation,
bypassing
the
lymphatics.
Early
dissemination
with
sepsis
occurs, but without the formation of a bubo.
This is usually observed in individuals bitten by
the rat ﬂea in the oral, tonsillar and pharyngeal
areas due to the vascularity of the tissue and short
lymphatic distance to the thoracic duct.
Clinical Syndromes
Bubonic plague is the most common clinical
form of the disease. The condition is associated
with a sudden onset of high fever, chills and
headaches, body aches, extreme exhaustion,
abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The presence of
painful, swollen lymph glands (buboes), usually
in the groin, axilla or neck, is the characteristic
manifestation. The buboes are unilateral, oval and
extremely painful. They measure 2–10 cm in size.
Inguinal
lymph
nodes
are
most
commonly
involved. Enlargement of the buboes may cause
rupture and discharge of foul-smelling pus. Hepa-
tomegaly and splenomegaly may occur, causing
tenderness. The mortality rate for untreated
plague is 40–70%. An attack of plague provides
a long-lasting immunity to infected humans.
Pneumonic plague is highly infectious and
transmitted by aerosol droplets. The condition
is characterised by abrupt onset of fever and
chills, lymphadenopathy, chest pain, dyspnoea,
purulent sputum or haemoptysis. Buboes may or
may not be present in pneumonic plague. The
condition, if untreated, is invariably fatal.
Septicaemic plague is associated with a high
mortality rate. The condition is associated with a
rapid onset of symptoms, such as nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Diar-
rhoea may be the predominant symptom. Patients
have a toxic appearance due to overwhelming
infection with the plague bacillus and may

present with tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypo-
tension. Hypothermia is common. Generalised
purpura leading to necrosis and gangrene of the
distal extremities may be observed. Buboes are
not demonstrated in the septicaemic plague.
Patients usually die due to a high level of
bacteraemia.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include bubo aspirates (in bubonic plague),
sputum (in pneumonic plague) and blood and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (in septicaemic plague).
Microscopy
Bubo aspirates are collected by injecting 1 mL of
sterile saline into the bubo with a 20G needle. The
ﬂuid is aspirated after that by withdrawing several
times. The bubo aspirate smears are stained with
Gram, Wright, Wayson or Giemsa stain to dem-
onstrate the typical bipolar (safety pin) morphol-
ogy of Y. pestis. Blood and CSF of septicaemic
patients can also be stained to reveal the bacteria.
Gram stain of the aspirate of the ﬂuid from
the inguinal lymph nodes shows Gram-negative
coccobacilli with a characteristic bipolar appear-
ance that resembles a closed safety pin and also
shows polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Wayson
stain of the aspirate smear shows Y. pestis as
light-blue bacilli with dark-blue polar bodies
(Fig. 37.1). A direct ﬂuorescent antibody test
employing monoclonal antibodies is a rapid diag-
nostic method to demonstrate Y. pestis F1 antigen
in blood or sputum samples. A positive ﬂuores-
cence antibody test on smears or cultures is pre-
sumptive evidence of infection.
Culture and Identifications
Y. pestis culture to be performed only in BSL-III
laboratories. Isolation of Y. pestis by culture
conﬁrms the diagnosis of plague. The organism
can be isolated from blood, CSF, sputum and
bubo aspirates, depending on the clinical presen-
tation, whether it is bubonic, pneumonic or
septicaemic. Y. pestis is slow-growing, but it
does not require special growth media. Selective
medium, such as blood agar with sodium azide, is
used to isolate Y. pestis from sputum and bubo
aspirates containing numerous other bacteria.
Dark-brown colonies on blood agar and pinpoint
colonies on MacConkey agar are the characteris-
tic
features
of
colonies
of
Y.
pestis.
The
identifying features of Y. pestis colonies are
summarised in the Table 37.4.
Animal Inoculation
Y. pestis can be isolated from bubo aspirate or
sputum by inoculating guinea pigs or white rats.

Y. pestis causes the death of the animal within
2–5 days. Postmortem of the dead animal shows
necrosis and oedema at the inoculation site.
Draining lymph nodes are enlarged, congested
and show greyish white patches. Gram- and meth-
ylene blue-stained smears of lymph nodes, spleen
and heart blood reveal typical bipolar-stained
Gram-negative bacilli.

Sputum collected from suspected cases of
pneumonic plague is inoculated by applying
them over the shaven skin or to the nasal mucosa
of a guinea pig. The bacteria present in the speci-
men penetrate the skin through minute abrasions.
Bacilli are demonstrated in the sputum and in the
blood from the guinea pig’s heart, which dies
2–3 days after inoculation.
Serology
Serological tests usually supplement the diagno-
sis of plague. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) is frequently employed to detect
speciﬁc antibodies in acute and convalescent sera.
A fourfold or greater difference in antibody titre
between acute and convalescent sera collected
10 days apart, demonstrated by ELISA, suggests
plague infection. A single positive ELISA in a
patient who has not received plague vaccine nor
has had the previous plague is also presumptive
of infection.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been
widely tested for accurate and timely detection
of pathogenic Yersinia sp. Conventional PCR
techniques
targeting
virulence
genes
in
Yersinia have been widely used. However, due
to the post analytics challenges of classical
PCR, RT PCR has emerged as a promising
alternative. Single species targeted RT PCR
and multiplex RT PCR targeting numerous spe-
cies in a sample have been developed. Commer-
cial
kits
like
TaqMan™
Yersinia
pestis
Detection Kit are available to offer a fully
integrated, single-vendor solution to identify
Y. pestis. In addition, random ampliﬁed poly-
morphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) and inter-repeat
PCR (IR-PCR) have also been used for PCR-
based DNA ﬁngerprinting and have enabled the
identiﬁcation of multiple clinical isolates of
Yersinia sp.
Treatment
Treatment of a suspected case of plague with
antibiotics should be started as early as possible,
without waiting for laboratory conﬁrmation.
Immediate treatment with antibiotics has dramat-
ically reduced mortality due to the disease. Strep-
tomycin, doxycycline and chloramphenicol are
used effectively for the treatment of plague.
Treatment with antibiotics is usually given for
10 days. A two-drug regimen should be used in
severe cases. Streptomycin is the drug of choice
to treat plague. Doxycycline is given to patients
who are allergic to streptomycin or who cannot
tolerate streptomycin. Chloramphenicol is the
drug of choice in septicaemic plague or patients
with hypotension. In patients with hypotension,
intramuscularly administered streptomycin may

be poorly absorbed. Resistance of Y. pestis to
streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline and chlor-
amphenicol is very rare.
Yersinia pestis
547
Epidemiology
Plague is globally distributed, with most human
cases reported from developing countries.
Geographical Distribution
Most plague cases occur in the developing
countries of Africa and Asia, including Vietnam
and India. Based on the fermentation of glycerol
and nitrate reduction, Y. pestis has been typed into
three distinct types: Y. pestis var. orientalis,
Y.
pestis
var.
antiqua
and
Y.
pestis
var.
medievalis. These biotypes show different geo-
graphical distributions. The primary foci of
Y. pestis var. orientalis are India, Myanmar and
China. This biotype is also responsible for wild
plague in the western USA, South America and
South Africa. Y. pestis var. antiqua is distributed
in
Mongolia,
Manchuria
and
Transbaikalia.
Y. pestis var. medievalis is restricted to Southeast
Russia.
Habitat
Y. pestis inhabits infected lymph nodes—most
commonly inguinal lymph nodes in bubonic
plague, the lower respiratory tract in pneumonic
plague
and
the
blood
circulation
in
the
septicaemic plague.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Bubonic plague is a zoonotic infection transmit-
ted to humans by the bite of an infected rat ﬂea.
Infection may also be transferred by contamina-
tion of the bite wound with the faeces of infected
rat ﬂeas. There are two natural cycles of plague:
the urban plague and the wild plague (Fig. 37.2).
Urban or domestic plague is maintained in
rat populations and is transmitted among rats or
between rats and humans by infected rat ﬂeas. In
India during earlier years, plague produced
epizootics ﬁrst in sewer rat, Rattus norvegicus.
When their number decreased, the disease spread
to the domestic rat, Rattus Rattus. Domestic rat is
the important reservoir of the urban plague from
which the infection spreads to human beings. The
rat ﬂea is the usual vector. Thirty different ﬂea
species have been identiﬁed as vectors, the most
important being X. cheopis, Xenopsylla astia and
Ceratophyllus fasciatus. X. cheopis is the pre-
dominant species in north India, while X. astia
is in south India. Cool and humid seasons favour
the multiplication of ﬂeas, leading to a high ﬂea
index (mean number of ﬂeas per rat). Hence,
plague epidemics occur during the cold season
more frequently than in the hot, dry weather, in
which ﬂeas do not thrive, and the transmission of
infection is interrupted.

Fig. 37.2 Epidemiology of plague
Wild or sylvatic plague occurs between
animals and wild rodents independent of human
beings. More than 200 different animal species
have been identiﬁed as hosts. The gerbil (Tatera
indica) and the bandicoot are reservoirs for the

sylvatic plague in India. A sylvatic stage occurs
when these wild animals infect humans. Human
infection may occur during the handling of dead
carcasses of infected wild animals and through
the ingestion of meat of infected animals. Human
infection from inhalation of respiratory droplets
from infected cats has also been documented.
548
37
Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella
In enzootic foci, infected ﬂeas may survive for
over a year. The bacilli remain alive and even
multiply in the soil of unused rodent burrows.
Plague bacilli infect new rodents that live in
such burrows. This contributes to the long period
of quiescence and subsequent re-emergence of
the plague. Sylvatic plague is difﬁcult to elimi-
nate because the mammalian reservoirs and ﬂea
vectors are widespread.
Human-to-human spread occurs only in
pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is spread
by droplet infection and may be seen during
epidemics of bubonic plague.
Prevention and Control
These include immunoprophylaxis by plague
vaccine, chemoprophylaxis by antibiotic therapy
and environmental sanitation.
Immunoprophylaxis by Plague Vaccine
A killed vaccine for plague is available in India. It
is a whole culture antigen prepared at the
Haffkine Institute, Mumbai. The vaccine contains
2000 millions of plague bacilli per millilitre. A
series of three injections of 0.5 mL of vaccine is
given subcutaneously. Two doses are given at an
interval of 1–3 months, followed by a third dose
in the sixth month. The vaccine confers protection
only for 6 months against bubonic plague. The
vaccine is recommended for laboratory and ﬁeld
workers who come in contact with the plague
bacillus or individuals residing in endemic areas
who cannot avoid exposure to rodents or ﬂeas.
The vaccine is not effective against pneumonic
plague.
Chemoprophylaxis by Antibiotic Therapy
Prophylactic antibiotic therapy includes prophy-
laxis
with
tetracycline
or
streptomycin.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has also been
effective for prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotic
therapy is recommended for contacts of pneu-
monic plague victims, people exposed to the
bites of rodent ﬂeas during a plague outbreak
and persons who have handled an animal known
to be infected with the plague bacilli. However,
antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for
contacts with bubonic or septicaemic plague.
Environmental Sanitation
A key component in preventing plague outbreaks
is identifying the source of infection. Rodent con-
trol forms the mainstay of prevention of plague in
an urban area. Trained professionals should apply
chemicals to kill ﬂeas and rodents. Educating the
public in rural plague-endemic areas to avoid
handling sick or dead rats and to avoid places
where wild animals live is important.
WHO Guidelines for the Management
of Plague Outbreak
WHO has programs that enable surveillance and
support to at-risk countries to prepare and manage
the incidences of plague? Speciﬁc guidelines
have been issued for the Indian subcontinent,
South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The
guidelines are region-speciﬁc and account for
the risk and conditions of human transmission
depending on the type of animal reservoir in a
particular region. In general, these guidelines pro-
vide up-to-date guidance on the diagnosis, case
management, prevention and control of the differ-
ent forms of plague, both for sporadic cases and
during outbreaks.
Yersinia enterocolitica
Y. enterocolitica is a well-recognised enteric bac-
terium
that
causes
distinctive
clinical
manifestations,
ranging
from
asymptomatic
infections to life-threatening sepsis, especially in

n
children. Schleifstein and Coleman were the ﬁrst
to
describe
Y.
enterocolitica
in
1939.
Y.
enterocolitica
is
a
Gram-negative
coccobacillus that is motile at 22 C but not at
37 C. This bacillus resembles Yersinia pseudo-
tuberculosis in being motile at 22 C but differs
from it in fermenting sucrose and cellobiose and
decarboxylating ornithine. Y. enterocolitica are
aerobes and grow well on commonly used basic
enteric media.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
549
The antigenic structure of Y. enterocolitica is
distinct. Y. enterocolitica possesses 34 different O
antigen factors and 19 H factors. Based on these
antigens, more than 60 O serotypes have been
reported.
Most
human
isolates
belong
to
serotypes O:3, O:5, 27; O:8 and represent the
most
virulent
worldwide
causes
of
human
yersiniosis. Virulence of Y. enterocolitica is chro-
mosomal or plasmid-mediated.
Humans acquire infection by ingestion of food
or
water
contaminated
with
the
bacteria.
Y. enterocolitica causes enterocolitis primarily in
young children, pseudo-appendicitis syndrome
and extraintestinal infections.
Enterocolitis is the most common clinical
form of the disease, occurring primarily in
young children, with a mean age of 24 months.
The incubation period is short that varies from
4 to 6 days. The condition manifests as watery,
mucoid diarrhoea in most patients; fever, colicky
abdominal pain, bloody stools and leucocytes in
the stool. Diarrhoea usually lasts from 1 day to
3 weeks. Most cases are self-limited. The bacteria
also cause mesenteric lymphadenitis with termi-
nal ileitis. The condition, known as pseudo-
appendicitis syndrome, is more common in
older children and young adults and mimics
appendicitis. It is characterised by fever, abdomi-
nal pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant
and leucocytosis.
Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating
Y. enterocolitica from the stool by culture. On
MacConkey
agar,
they
produce
pinpoint
colourless colonies after 24 h of incubation. On
blood agar, they form non-haemolytic smooth
and translucent colonies measuring 2–3 mm i
diameter after 2 days of incubation at 22 C.
Cefsulodin–irgasan–novobiocin (CIN) agar is a
frequently
used
selective
medium
for
Y. enterocolitica. Stool culture is positive within
2 weeks of the onset of the disease. ELISA and
radioimmunoassay are frequently used tests to
detect sera antibodies to diagnose the condition.
Antibody titres rise 1 week after onset of illness
and reach maximal levels at 2 weeks; raised anti-
body levels can be found for years after infection.
Antibody titres more than 1:128 are suggestive of
a previous infection with Y. enterocolitica.
Good
nutrition
and
hydration
are
the
mainstays of treatment. The role of antibiotic
therapy
in
uncomplicated
acute
colitis
and
mesenteric adenitis is not established. Antibiotic
therapy is indicated only for patients with
septicaemia, focal extraintestinal manifestations
and enterocolitis who are immunocompromised.
Tetracycline, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole are the antibiotics of choice.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
Y. pseudotuberculosis is the least common of the
three main Yersinia species to cause human
infections. It is a small, ovoid and bipolar-stained
Gram-negative
bacillus.
It
is
non-sporing,
non-capsulated and slightly acid-fast. It is motile
at 22 C but not at 37 C. It is non-lactose-
fermenting coccobacillus that is differentiated
from other species, such as Y. enterocolitica, by
its fermentation of sorbitol, ornithine decarboxyl-
ase activity and other tests. The optimum growth
occurs on MacConkey or eosin-methylene blue
(EMB) agar medium at 20–35 C. The growth of
the bacteria is enhanced noticeably at lower
temperatures (e.g. 4 C cold enrichment in buff-
ered saline). The bacteria grow slowly on blood
and chocolate agar plates, forming small, grey
and translucent colonies at 24–72 h of incubation.
Y. pseudotuberculosis has been classiﬁed into
six serotypes (I–VI). Approximately 80% of
human diseases are caused by type I serotypes.
The bacteria show antigenic cross-reactivity with
Y.
pestis
as
well
as
salmonellae.
Y. pseudotuberculosis in experimentally infected
guinea pigs produces multiple nodules in the
lungs, spleen and liver, resembling tuberculous

a
s
lesions,
hence
named
pseudotuberculosis.
Humans acquire infections primarily through the
ingestion of contaminated food products. An
inoculum of 109 organisms is the infective dose.
550
37
Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella
Y. pseudotuberculosis is the causative agent of
gastroenteritis,
Izumi
fever
and
Far
East
scarlatinoid fever. The bacteria primarily cause
gastroenteritis. The incubation period varies
from 5 to 10 days. Gastroenteritis is characterised
by
self-limited
mesenteric
lymphadenitis
simulating acute appendicitis. Fever, abdominal
pain (often right lower quadrant location) and
rash are a major triad of Y. pseudotuberculosis
infection. Diarrhoea is not common. Erythema
nodosum and reactive arthritis are the noted late
complications of the infection. Izumi fever,
syndrome caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis, i
characterised by scarlatiniform rash, systemic
symptoms and coronary artery aneurysms. Far
East scarlatinoid fever is another syndrome
caused
by
bacteria.
The
presence
of
a
scarlatinoid-appearing rash on the head and
neck, erythema on the upper and lower extremity,
mucous membrane enanthem and strawberry
tongue
are
characteristic
features
of
the
syndrome.
Y. pseudotuberculosis is primarily a zoonotic
infection. The animal reservoirs include many
mammalian and avian hosts, such as horses, cat-
tle, dogs, deer, cats, rabbits, rodents and birds
(e.g. geese, turkey, ducks, canaries, cockatoos).
Butchers working in abattoirs slaughtering swine
are at an increased risk of Y. pseudotuberculosis
infection. The infection is distributed worldwide.
Most cases occur in the winter months because a
cold temperature favours the growth and multipli-
cation of the bacteria. Most cases have been
reported in Europe.
Laboratory diagnosis of Y. pseudotuberculosis
infection is made by isolating the bacteria by
culture from stool, blood, CSF, peritoneal ﬂuid,
synovial ﬂuid or other organ-based biopsies
(e.g. intestinal tissue, skin). Isolation of bacteria
from stool is difﬁcult, given the slow growth
pattern and overgrowth of normal faecal ﬂora.
However, stool culture may be facilitated by
cold enrichment, using special culture media,
such as CIN agar or by alkali treatment. ELISA
and agglutination tests are employed to demon-
strate serum antibodies, which may appear soon
after the onset of illness but decrease for 2–-
6 months. A rise in agglutinating antibodies in
paired serum samples, collected after 2 weeks, is
suggestive of the diagnosis. However, the test
shows
false-positive reactions in sera from
patients infected with Yersinia, Vibrio, Salmo-
nella, Brucella and Rickettsia species due to the
presence of cross-reactive antibodies. Histologi-
cal examination of speciﬁc tissue, such as
mesenteric lymph nodes, may show both the
pathologic and microbiologic presence of the
organism.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated only for youn-
ger patients with critical illness and immunocom-
promised patients. Tetracycline, aminopenicillins
and aminoglycosides are frequently used to treat
the condition.
Genus Pasteurella
The genus Pasteurella consists of more than
17 species. Pasteurella multocida is the most
common species causing infection in humans.
Other
species,
which
rarely
cause
human
infections, include Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella
dagmatis,
Pasteurella
pneumotropica,
Pasteurella aerogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica,
Pasteurella
caballi
and
Pasteurella
bettyae
(Table 37.5).
Pasteurella multocida
P. multocida is a non-motile Gram-negative
bacillus.
The
organism
generally
resembles
Yersinia but differs from it in being oxidase posi-
tive and producing indole. The bacterium grows
well on blood and chocolate agar but grows
poorly on MacConkey agar. On blood agar, after
overnight incubation, P. multocida produces
large
buttery
colonies
with
a
characteristic
musty odour of the colonies due to the production
of indole.
P. multocida is present in the upper respiratory
tract of dogs, cats, rats, cattle and sheep. The

bacteria sometimes are also present in the human
upper respiratory tract. Human infection is rare
but may occur following animal bites or trauma.
After a bite or scratch by cats or dogs, localised
cellulitis and adenitis occur at the site of the bite.
Patients with underlying pulmonary lesions may
also
show
exacerbation
of
respiratory
tract
infections (such as pneumonia, bronchitis and
sinusitis). P. multocida in immunocompromised
patients may cause a systemic infection. Penicil-
lin is the antibiotic of choice. Tetracycline,
cephalosporins or ﬂuoroquinolones are other
antibiotics equally effective against the bacteria.

Francisella tularensis
F. tularensis causative agent of tularaemia is one
of the most infectious bacteria known. It is classi-
ﬁed as a category A agent because of its high
infectivity, ease of dissemination and ability to
cause substantial illness and death. Humans
become infected after introducing the bacteria
by
intradermal
injection,
inhalation
or
oral
ingestion.
It is a minute (0.2  0.2–0.7 μm) and poorly
stained
Gram-negative
intracellular
coccobacillus. The bacterium is capsulated and
non-motile. Like Mycoplasma organisms, this
organism is ﬁlterable and multiplies, that is, by
ﬁlament formation and budding, besides binary
ﬁssion. Like Bordetella, the bacteria are strictly
aerobic and fastidious; hence they cannot be
cultured on common laboratory media. The
organism
requires
enriched
media,
such
as
Francis blood dextrose cystine agar and a lon-
ger incubation period of 3–5 days. F. tularensis
produces minute transparent colonies on these
media after incubation of 3–5 days.
F. tularensis is an intracellular parasite. In
infected animals, the bacteria are found in large
numbers in the reticuloendothelial cells of the
spleen, liver, etc. These bacteria remain viable
for a longer period in macrophages of the reticu-
loendothelial
system
because
the
organisms
inhibit phagosome–lysosome fusion. Like other
Gram-negative bacilli, F. tularensis has endo-
toxin but is relatively less biologically active
than that found in Escherichia coli and other
Gram-negative bacilli. Capsulated strains
of
F.
tularensis
are
pathogenic,
while
non-capsulated strains are non-pathogenic. Intra-
dermal injection or inhalations of 10–50 bacilli
are required to cause disease. Nearly 100 million
bacteria are required to cause disease on oral
ingestion.
F. tularensis causes tularaemia, also known
as glandular fever, rabbit fever, tick fever and
deer ﬂy fever—an acute, febrile, granulomatous,
infectious disease in humans and other mammals.
The incubation period varies from 3 to 5 days.
The onset of the disease is abrupt, with symptoms
such
as
fever,
chills,
malaise
and
fatigue.
Tularaemia can manifest in one to six well-
recognised
clinical
forms.
These
include
ulceroglandular tularaemia, glandular tularaemia,
oculoglandular
tularaemia,
oropharyngeal
tularaemia, pneumonic tularaemia and typhoidal
(septicaemic) tularaemia.
Tularaemia is zoonotic inaction. Contact with
infected animals or their carcasses is the primary
mode of transmission. The infection is transmit-
ted by (1) ingestion of poorly cooked meats of the
infected animals, such as rabbits, (2) ingestion of

contaminated water, (3) bite of hard ticks
(Amblyomma
americanum,
Dermacentor
andersoni and Dermacentor variabilis) or deerﬂy
(Chrysops discalis), (4) direct contact with
contaminated soil, water or fomites and (5) inha-
lation of water aerosols or dust from soil, grains
or contaminated pelts. However, person-to-per-
son transmission is rare.
552
37
Yersinia, Pasteurella and Francisella
F. tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium.
Hence, isolation of the bacteria from clinical
specimens is not attempted in routine laboratories
because culture poses a danger to laboratory
workers. The plates must be sealed and handled
using a biosafety level (BSL)-2 facility that is
essential for handling the culture plates and a
BSL-3 facility for isolation and identiﬁcation of
F. tularensis isolates.
Gram staining of the aspirates from ulcer
exudates or infected lymph nodes is not useful
because F. tularensis is extremely small and
stains very faintly. Detection of antigen directly
in clinical specimens by direct ﬂuorescent anti-
body
staining,
using
ﬂuorescein-labelled
antibodies directed against the organism, is a
more sensitive and speciﬁc method for diagnosis
of the condition. The test is yet to be available for
wide use.
Blood cultures in a speciﬁc medium (such as
cysteine–glucose–blood agar) are usually nega-
tive unless the cultures are incubated for a week
or longer. Aspirates of lymph nodes or draining
sinuses are usually positive if the cultures are
incubated for 3 days or longer. The identiﬁcation
of F. tularensis is conﬁrmed by testing with spe-
ciﬁc
antiserum-containing
antibodies
against
Francisella.
The Tularaemia tube agglutination test is the
most commonly used serological test. An agglu-
tination titre greater than 1:160 is considered pre-
sumptively positive. Diagnosis is conﬁrmed by a
fourfold increase in titre of the serum samples
collected 2 weeks apart. The test shows cross-
reactivity with Brucella species, Proteus Ox-19,
Salmonella species and Yersinia species. Capture
ELISA using speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies
raised against LPS of the virulent forms of
F. tularensis is a sensitive method for detecting
serum antigens.
PCR has been used to detect F. tularensis in
clinical specimens even after the start of antibiotic
therapy.
Streptomycin is the antibiotic of choice for the
treatment of tularaemia. Gentamicin is used as an
alternative to streptomycin. Fluoroquinolones are
now increasingly used in the treatment of
tularaemia. A live attenuated vaccine obtained
from avirulent F. tularensis biovar palaearctica
(type B) is available. The vaccine confers only
partial protection but reduces disease severity in
vaccinated people.
Case Study
A 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital
with a sudden onset of high fever, chills, head-
ache, body aches, extreme exhaustion, abdominal
pain
and
diarrhoea.

revealed the presence of painful, swollen lymph
glands in the groin. Aspirate from the bubo on

Pseudomonas, Burkholderia
and Acinetobacter
38
Pseudomonas and related bacteria belong to the
family Pseudomonadaceae, which contains over
200 species. Most of them are pathogenic to
plants, insects and reptiles. A few species cause
disease in humans. These are Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Pseudomonas ﬂuorescence, Pseudo-
monas
putida,
Pseudomonas
stutzeri,
Burkholderia
cepacia,
Burkholderia
mallei,
Burkholderia pseudomallei, Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia,
Acinetobacter
baumannii
and
Moraxella catarrhalis (Table 38.1).
Genus Pseudomonas
Pseudomonas is ubiquitous and is found world-
wide. They are found in soil, vegetation, water,
plants and animals with a predilection to moist
environments. They are also commonly found in
the hospital environment. They are opportunistic
pathogens often causing hospital or nosocomial
infections.
These
organisms
are
notorious
because of their potential to develop innate resis-
tance to many antibiotics.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
P. aeruginosa is the most important species
associated with human infection. Previously it
was called by the name Pseudomonas pyocyanea
or Bacillus pyocyaneus. It is a most common
human saprophyte, but it rarely causes disease in
healthy
individuals.
It
causes
most
human
infections in an immunocompromised human host.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
P. aeruginosa is a straight or slightly curved,
Gram-negative
bacillus
measuring
0.5–1.0  1.5–5.0 μm in size arranged singly, in
pairs or short chains. It is motile by the presence
of a polar ﬂagellum. Occasionally, strains may
possess two or three polar ﬂagella. Pseudomonas
spp. is non-capsulated. Although the bacteria are
non-capsulated, many strains appear mucoid by
producing an abundant extracellular polysaccha-
ride composed of alginate polymers. This slime
layer forms a loose capsule or glycocalyx around
the bacillus. These strains are particularly isolated
from patients with cystic ﬁbrosis. Pseudomonas
spp. is ﬁmbriated.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Pseudomonas
spp.
are
strict
aerobes.
P. aeruginosa grows over a wide range of
temperatures (5–32 C), the optimum temperature
being 37 C. It grows on commonly used routine
media, including nutrient agar, blood agar,
MacConkey agar and cetrimide agar, a selec-
tive medium for the culture of P. aeruginosa.
P. aeruginosa produces different types of
pigments. Pyocyanin is speciﬁcally produced by
P.
aeruginosa,
which
diffuses
into
the

surrounding medium (Fig. 38.1). The pigment is
soluble in chloroform and water. Pyoverdine, or
ﬂuorescein, is produced by P. aeruginosa and
many other Pseudomonas species. These pigments
give a yellow tinge to bacteria colonies and are
best demonstrated in a microscope using an ultra-
violet source of light. Fluorescein is soluble in
water but insoluble in chloroform. Pyorubin, a

Pseudomonas aeruginosa
555
Pseudomonas are oxidase positive. Oxidase
test is an important test for the identiﬁcation of
P. aeruginosa. All the strains are oxidase positive
within 30 s of performing the test. They are cata-
lase positive. They are non-fermentative bacteria
and utilise sugars by an oxidase metabolism, with
oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. They do
not utilise lactose and maltose. They are indole,
MR, VP and HS negative, reduce nitrates to
nitrite and further broken down to gaseous nitro-
gen, and arginine dihydrolase positive. Special
media,
such
as
oxidation–fermentation
(OF) media, are used to demonstrate the low
quantity of acid produced during the oxidative
breakdown of sugars. P. aeruginosa utilises glu-
cose, forming acid only.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
P. aeruginosa is a heat-labile bacterium, readily
killed at 55 C in 1 h. It is also highly susceptible
to acid, silver salts, 2% alkaline, glutaraldehyde
and disinfectants (such as Dettol and cetrimide).
However, P. aeruginosa is very strongly resistant
to common antiseptics and disinfectants, such as
chloroxylenol, hexachlorophene and quaternary
ammonium compounds.
Antigenic Structure
P. aeruginosa consists of O and H antigens.
Somatic or O antigens are the group-speciﬁc
antigens. P. aeruginosa possesses 19 distinct
group-speciﬁc O antigens based on which the
organism has been classiﬁed into 19 serogroups.
O antigens are heat stable and can be extracted
with acid or formamide. The O antigen can be
detected by precipitation reaction-in-gel or tube
or slide agglutination tests using speciﬁc antisera
produced against these antigens. P. aeruginosa
serogroups O6 and O11 are isolated from the
majority of the clinical specimens. Serogroup
O11 has been associated with most hospital-
acquired infections. Flagella or H antigens are
found in the ﬂagella of P. aeruginosa. These
antigens
are
heat-labile.
Slide
agglutination
tests have demonstrated two types of H antigens
by
using
speciﬁc
antibodies
against
these
antigens.
Pathogenesis
P. aeruginosa is an invasive pathogen, and its
mechanism of pathogenesis is not clearly under-
stood, though multiple virulence factors have
been identiﬁed.
Virulence Factors
P. aeruginosa invasion is mediated by many vir-
ulence factors, including toxins, enzymes and cell
wall structure (Table 38.2).
Exotoxin A is one of the most important viru-
lence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. The
toxin is like that of the diphtheria toxin that
prevents the synthesis of proteins in eukaryotic
cells. It is responsible for causing tissue damage
in chronic pulmonary infection, dermatonecrosis
in burns wounds and the cornea’s destruction in
ocular infection. The toxin also causes suppres-
sion of immunity in the infected host. Exotoxins
S and T are believed to facilitate the spread of
bacteria and invasion of tissues by causing dam-
age to the epithelial cells. The enzymes serine
protease
(LasA)
and
zinc
metalloprotease
(LasB) are the two types of the enzyme elastase
that act in combination to destroy elastin present
in elastin-containing tissues. These enzymes
cause damage to parenchymal tissues of the lung
and produce haemorrhagic lesions associated
with spreading P. aeruginosa infections. These
enzymes also facilitate the spread of infection and
damage
of
tissues
in
acute
infections
by
degrading several components of the complement
and
inhibiting
chemotaxis
activities
of
neutrophils. P. aeruginosa cell wall is surrounded
by a loose slime layer. The loose slime layer, also
known as the alginate coat or glycocalyx, protects
the bacteria from phagocytosis and against the
activity
of
many
antibiotics,
such
as
aminoglycosides. Genes mediate the production
of the mucoid slime layer. These genes are
activated in patients suffering from chronic

respiratory disease in those with cystic ﬁbrosis
and when colonised.

Pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Infection
P. aeruginosa are true pathogens and opportunis-
tic pathogens. P. aeruginosa, as a true pathogen,
cause infections of the respiratory tract in patients
with underlying disease of the respiratory tract.
They also cause infection of the urinary tract in
patients with catheterisation. P. aeruginosa, as an
opportunistic
pathogen,
causes
most
human
infections in immunocompromised hosts.
Clinical Syndromes
P. aeruginosa causes a wide variety of clinical
syndromes.
P. aeruginosa causes infection of the lower
respiratory tract, almost exclusively in patients
with malignancies and immunodeﬁciencies. Pri-
mary non-bacteraemic Pseudomonas pneumonia
usually occurs in patients who have been colonised
earlier with P. aeruginosa. This colonisation is
seen in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis, other chronic
disease and neutropenia. P. aeruginosa can cause
various skin infections, such as infections of burn
wounds, chronic paronychia, infected toe web,
pseudomonal folliculitis and pseudomonal celluli-
tis. Infection of burn wounds is the most common.
The bacteria P. aeruginosa causes urinary tract
infections in persons with indwelling urinary
catheters and persons undergoing instrumentation
and surgery of the urinary tract. Other infections
include
ear
infections
(external
otitis),
eye
infections (pseudomonal endophthalmitis), cardio-
vascular infections (pseudomonal infectious endo-
carditis), etc.
Nosocomial
infections
caused
by
P. aeruginosa are opportunistic infections seen
in immunocompromised hosts. Such immuno-
compromised hosts include a. persons with dys-
functional immune mechanisms, such as AIDS,
cystic ﬁbrosis, neonates, complement deﬁciency,
hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia and
b. patients with injury to the skin and mucocuta-
neous membrane that occurs during burn injuries
and use of urinary catheters, dialysis catheters,
endotracheal
tubes
and
intravenous
lines.
P. aeruginosa causes bacteraemia—a condition
clinically similar to Gram-negative bacteraemia
in immunocompromised patients. It also causes
pseudomonal meningitis, which occurs in immu-
nocompromised patients who have undergone
neurosurgery.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa
557
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include pus, urine sputum, cerebrospinal
ﬂuid
(CSF),
blood
and
other
specimens
depending on the nature of the infections.
Microscopy
Gram staining of CSF or pus may show Gram-
negative bacilli but is not useful for speciﬁc diag-
nosis of Pseudomonas.
Culture and Identification
Laboratory diagnosis of pseudomonal infection is
based on isolation of P. aeruginosa from faeces
or other clinical specimens containing mixed
microbial ﬂora by culture on selective medium,
such as cetrimide agar. Since P. aeruginosa is
frequently present as a contaminant in the clinical
specimen, hence not a single isolation but
repeated
isolations
are
essential
to
conﬁrm
P. aeruginosa as the causative agent of the
condition.
P. aeruginosa, after incubation for 24 h at
37 C on nutrient agar, produces large (2–3 mm
in diameter), opaque, translucent and irregularly
round colonies. These colonies emit a character-
istic musty to fruity odour due to the production
of aminoacetophenone from the amino acid tryp-
tophan.
The
bacteria
on
MacConkey
agar
produces
colourless
non-lactose-fermenting
colonies. It produces haemolytic colonies on
blood agar. It produces on cetrimide agar.
Non-lactose-fermenting and beta-haemolytic
green pigmented colonies (Fig. 38.1), which are
rapid oxidase positive, are identiﬁed by biochem-
ical reactions, production of pyocins and suscep-
tibility to phage typing, serotyping and molecular
typing.
Typing
Recent hospital-acquired infection trends suggest
that P. aeruginosa is one of the important
pathogens; hence, it is mandatory to classify
these
strains
for
epidemiological
purposes.
There are various typing methods available for
classifying Pseudomonas, such as serotyping,
bacteriophage typing, bacteriocin typing and
molecular
typing.
Out
of
all
these
typing
methods, molecular methods such as pulse-ﬁeld
gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typ-
ing are more useful since they can distinguish
different clones among a particular species of
Pseudomonas.
Treatment
Treatment of Pseudomonas infection is by spe-
ciﬁc antimicrobial therapy. Pseudomonas is sus-
ceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin,
tobramycin,
carbenicillin,
azlocillin
and
ticarcillin. Ciproﬂoxacin is the most frequently
used antibiotic because it is active against
P. aeruginosa in most tissues. Pseudomonas
infections are treated best with a combination of
at least two antipseudomonal antibiotics. A com-
bination of aminoglycosides or quinolone with
another antipseudomonal antibiotic is effective
for most Pseudomonas infections.
P. aeruginosa shows a considerable degree of
resistance to many commonly used antibiotics.
Most strains are intrinsically resistant to the most
commonly used antimicrobial agents. They can
become more resistant during therapy with
antibiotics. The mutation of the genes encoding
for outer membrane porin proteins is most com-
monly responsible for developing resistance.
They also produce many beta-lactamases, which
cause the inactivation of many beta-lactam
antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins,
carbapenems, etc.
Epidemiology
P. aeruginosa is opportunistic pathogens, causing
infection, distributed worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
P. aeruginosa infection is ubiquitous in most
environmental places in the hospital. The bacteria
are especially found in the hospital environment,
such as toilets, bathtubs, washbasins, respiratory
and dialysis equipment, kitchens and even anti-
septic or disinfectant solutions.

558
38
Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Acinetobacter
Habitat
In hospitalised patients, P. aeruginosa transiently
colonises the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract
of the patients. The colonisation is common in
patients, particularly those hospitalised for a very
long
period,
treated
with
broad-spectrum
antibiotics over a long duration and those exposed
to respiratory therapy by instrumentation.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
The hospital environment is the most common
source and reservoir of infection. Pseudomonal
infections are transmitted through aerosols and by
contact with infectious materials. P. aeruginosa is
responsible for nearly 5–15% of the hospital or
nosocomial infections.
Prevention and Control
Prevention of Pseudomonas infections, particu-
larly in hospitals, is always difﬁcult. It requires
constant monitoring and strict attention to asepsis.
The measures suggested for hospital infection
control practices are primarily based on the pre-
vention of cross-infection of patients by attending
medical and paramedical personnel. It also
depends on preventing contamination of equip-
ment, such as dialysis machines, respiratory
instruments and restricting the use of broad-
spectrum antibiotics. The latter suppresses normal
microbial ﬂora and facilitates the overgrowth of
resistant Pseudomonas organisms. Pseudomonas
vaccines have been evaluated in specialised
situations, such as cases of cystic ﬁbrosis that
are highly susceptible to Pseudomonas infections.

stutzeri,
P.
putida
and
P. ﬂuorescence are also associated with opportu-
nistic infections in humans.
S. maltophilia was previously known as Pseu-
domonas
maltophilia
or
Xanthomonas
maltophilia.
They
are
slightly
curved
(or) straight bacilli, Gram-negative and motile. It
is an important cause of nosocomial infection,
and
it
occurs
primarily
in
debilitated
or
immunosuppressed individuals (as an opportunis-
tic pathogen). And also, it is associated with
extending spectrum of clinical syndromes such
as bacteraemia, endocarditis, respiratory tract
infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft
tissue and bone and joint infections and ophthal-
mologic infections. A majority of strains of
S. maltophilia are resistant to many currently
available broad-spectrum antibiotics, including
carbapenem class.
P. stutzeri is associated with occasional uri-
nary tract infections. It produces light-brown
pigmented colonies in culture, and the pigment
does not diffuse into the medium.
Genus Burkholderia
The genus Burkholderia includes four species
formerly classiﬁed as Pseudomonas species.
These
include
B.
cepacia,
B.
mallei,
B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia gladioli, and
B. mallei, B. cepacia and B. pseudomallei are
human
pathogens,
whereas
B. gladioli
and
B. mallei are not.
Burkholderia cepacia
B. cepacia, previously known as Pseudomonas
cepacia, is a Gram-negative, motile bacillus and
stains irregularly with Gram staining (Fig. 38.2). It
is an aerobe, grows well on nutrient agar at
25–30 C. The bacteria produce non-diffusible red-
dish-purple pigmented colonies on prolonged incu-
bation. The bacteria do not grow on DCA agar. It is
oxidase positive. It utilises glucose, lactose, malt-
ose and mannitol with acid production only.
B. cepacia is motile with a polar tuft of ﬂagella.
B. cepacia is an opportunistic pathogen found
in moist environment surfaces and is associated
with nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections.
It causes respiratory infections in patients with
cystic ﬁbrosis or chronic granulomatous disease
and urinary tract infections in patients with
indwelling catheters. It has also been reported to

cause
pneumonitis,
osteomyelitis,
wound
infections and septicaemias in patients with
contaminated intravenous catheters and endocar-
ditis in drug addicts. Cepacia is susceptible to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
chlorampheni-
col and ceftazidime. But it is inherently resistant
to aminoglycosides, polymyxin, penicillins and
cephalosporins.

Burkholderia mallei
B. mallei, earlier known as Pseudomonas mallei,
is a slender, Gram-negative, small bacillus mea-
suring 2.5 μm in length. It stains irregularly, often
giving a beaded appearance. It is an aerobe and
facultative anaerobe, which can grow on ordinary
culture media. It produces small and translucent
colonies, which become yellowish on prolonged
incubation. It is relatively biochemically inert,
fermenting only glucose.
In animals, such as horses, mules and asses,
B. mallei produce two types of the clinical syn-
drome: glander and farcy. B. mallei can be trans-
mitted occasionally to humans from infected
animals suffering from glanders. The infection is
transmitted by inoculating injured skin or the
mucous membrane with contaminated discharges.
The condition is mostly occupational, found
among veterinarians and persons handling horses
and other equine animals. In humans, B. mallei
may cause acute or chronic infection, localised to
the skin, subcutaneous tissue or respiratory tract.
Human cases of glanders are usually rare. Acute
infection is characterised as an acute fulminant
febrile disease with mucopurulent nasal discharge
and severe prostration. The mortality rate is
very high.
Glanders in animals may be diagnosed by a
skin test known as the Mallein test. The skin test
is similar to the tuberculin test, demonstrating a
delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the protein of
B. mallei. The condition can also be diagnosed by
intraperitoneal inoculation of clinical specimens
into male adult guinea pigs. The positive test is
demonstrated by the appearance of swelling of
the testes, inﬂammation of tunica vaginalis and
ulceration of scrotal skin within 2–3 days of inoc-
ulation. This reaction is known as the Strauss
reaction.
B. mallei infection is being documented fre-
quently in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East,

Central America and South America. B. mallei is
usually sensitive to ciproﬂoxacin, streptomycin,
novobiocin,
gentamicin,
imipenem
and
sulphonamides. Treatment with these antibiotics
is usually given for 1–2 months, along with sur-
gical drainage of pus from the affected site.
B. mallei is usually resistant to chloramphenicol.

Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Acinetobacter
Burkholderia pseudomallei
B. pseudomallei is also known as Whitmore bacil-
lus, Malleomyces pseudomallei and Loefﬂerella
pseudomallei.
It
is
the
causative
agent
of
melioidosis (from Greek word, meaning resem-
blance to distemper of asses). B. pseudomallei
resembles B. mallei but differs in being motile;
also, it liqueﬁes gelatin and forms acid from sev-
eral sugars.
B.
pseudomallei
causes
melioidosis
in
humans. Melioidosis manifests as acute, local
and chronic infections. The incubation period is
variable. It may range from as short as two days to
as high as too many years. Acute infection is
characterised by the development of a nodule at
the inoculation site of the bacteria in the skin. The
bacteria can subsequently spread, causing sec-
ondary
lymphangitis,
regional
lymphangitis,
fever and myalgia. Acute melioidosis may prog-
ress rapidly to acute septicaemia with a high
mortality rate. Acute bloodstream infection is
most commonly seen in patients with HIV, diabe-
tes, renal failure, etc. The condition results in
septic
shock.
The
pulmonary
infection
manifests as mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia.
The condition is associated with high fever, head-
ache, chest pain, anorexia and general myalgia.
Non-productive or productive cough with normal
sputum is a typical manifestation of this condi-
tion.
Chronic
suppurative
infection
is
associated with multiple caseous or suppurative
foci of infection in several organs, including
joints, skin, lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, liver
and brain. Bacteria remain intracellular pathogens
of
the
reticuloendothelial
system,
which
contributes to long latency and reactivation of
the infection.
Melioidosis caused by the bacteria is endemic
in Southeast Asia. In India, most cases of
melioidosis are reported from Kerala, Tamil
Nadu, Maharashtra, Orissa, West Bengal and
Tripura. The condition is not only a primary dis-
ease of rats but also occurs in guinea pigs and
rabbits. Humans acquire infection either by inha-
lation
of
infected
aerosols,
inoculation
of
contaminated material or ingestion of food and
water contaminated with excreta of infected
animals. The infection also may be transmitted
by the bite of haematophagous insects. Agricul-
tural workers are highly susceptible to infection.
Diagnosis
of
the
condition
is
made
by
demonstrating
Gram-negative
bacilli
and
demonstrating the typical bipolar safety pin
appearance of the bacteria in the methylene blue
staining. Isolation of B. pseudomallei by the cul-
ture of urine, sputum, pus or blood conﬁrms the
diagnosis of B. pseudomallei infection. Serology
is
frequently
helpful
for
the
diagnosis
of
melioidosis,
especially
chronic
melioidosis.
ELISA is used to demonstrate speciﬁc IgM and
IgG antibodies in patients with melioidosis. PCR
has
also
been
evaluated
to
detect
the
B. pseudomallei genome in pus, sputum and
other specimens.
B. pseudomallei is susceptible to ceftazidime,
which is the drug of choice. Other antibiotics
include tetracycline, cotrimoxazole and chloram-
phenicol. Prolonged therapy with antibiotics is
essential to treat the patient.
Case Study
A 55-year-old man was admitted to a hospital
with 65% burns following an accident in the
kitchen. The infected pus from the skin showed
P. aeruginosa by culture. The patient was
treated
for
7
days
with
broad-spectrum
antibiotics. On the eighth day of hospitalisation,
the patient experienced fever and chill. The
blood cultures were repeatedly positive for
P. aeruginosa. The patient succumbed to the
infection and died after 15 days.

Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas
39
Members of the family Vibrionaceae are aerobes
and facultative anaerobes, non-sporing, catalase
and oxidase positive. They reduce nitrates to
nitrites and can grow on ordinary media. The
family Vibrionaceae includes the genera Vibrio,
Plesiomonas and Aeromonas.
Genus Vibrio
The genus Vibrio consists of at least 136 species
of curved bacilli, of which 12 species have been
implicated in human infections. Vibrio cholerae,
Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulniﬁcus
are the most prominent species causing human
infections (Table 39.1). The name ‘vibrio’ is
derived from the characteristic vibratory motility
(from vibrare, meaning to vibrate).
Vibrio cholerae
V. cholerae is the most important species that
causes
cholera,
the
most
feared
epidemic
diarrhoeal disease. Dehydration and death can
occur rapidly within a matter of hours of infection.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
V. cholerae are Gram-negative bacilli with
rounded or slightly pointed ends. They measure
1–3 μm in length and 0.5–0.8 μm in diameter.
They are typically comma-shaped. S-shaped or
spiral forms may be seen due to two or more
cells lying end to end. They are frequently pleo-
morphic in old cultures. In a stained ﬁlm of
mucous ﬂakes from a case of cholera, the vibrios
are typically arranged in parallel rows, described
by Koch as the ‘ﬁsh in stream’ appearance. They
are actively motile in the presence of a single
polar ﬂagellum. They show typical darting type
motility and appear as a ‘swarm of gnats’ when
examined under the microscope. The bacteria are
catalase positive and oxidase positive.

Culture and Biochemical Properties
V. cholerae is strongly aerobic and grows best
under aerobic conditions at an optimum 37 C. It
grows better in an alkaline medium, the range of
pH being 7.4–9.6 (optimum 8.2). Sodium chlo-
ride (0.5–1%) is required for optimal growth,
though high concentrations (5% and above) are
inhibitory for the growth of the bacteria. Unlike
other halophilic bacteria, V. cholerae can grow in
the absence of salt.
V. cholerae grows well on a wide variety of
media,
including
non-selective
media
(e.g. nutrient agar, MacConkey agar, blood agar,
gelatin agar and peptone water) and special media
(selective media, enrichment media and transport
media).

Non-selective Media
Vibrio grows well under aerobic conditions on
routine
culture
media

On nutrient agar, V. cholerae, after overnight
incubation,
produces
moist,
translucent
colonies with a bluish or greenish tinge. The
colonies measure about 1–2 mm in diameter.
The colonies emit a distinctive odour. The
colonies on MacConkey agar are initially
colourless after overnight incubation but become
reddish on prolonged incubation due to the late
fermentation of lactose. On blood agar, V.
cholerae
biotype
Eltor
produces
haemolytic
colonies. Biotype Classical strains, however, pro-
duce greenish discolouration around the colonies,
which later becomes clear due to haemodigestion.
In gelatin stab culture, V. cholerae produces
infundibuliform ( funnel-shaped) or napiform
(turnip-shaped) liquefaction after 3 days of incu-
bation at 22 C. In peptone water, the growth of
bacteria forms a ﬁne surface pellicle in about
6–9 h of incubation.
Selective Media
The selective media characteristically have a high
pH, which suppresses the growth of other intesti-
nal bacteria but favours the growth of vibrios.
TCBS
medium
(pH
8.6)
contains
thiosulphate, citrate, bile salts, sucrose and
bromothymol
blue
(indicator).
V.
cholerae
produces large, yellow convex colonies on this
medium (Fig. 39.1). This is due to the fermenta-
tion of sucrose by the bacteria, leading to the
production of acid. Accumulation of acid reduces
the pH of the medium, so the bromothymol blue
indicator
becomes
yellow,
thus
making
V.
cholerae
colonies
yellow.
Non-sucrose-
fermenting V. parahaemolyticus produces blue–
green colonies.
The enrichment media for V. cholerae are liquid
media with a high pH. The high pH of the media
suppresses the growth of many commensal
Monsur GTTA medium (pH 8.5), due to its
high pH and presence of potassium tellurite,
inhibits most Gram-positive bacteria and enteric
bacteria, except for Proteus species. Hence, the
GTTA medium is used to isolate V. cholerae and
other vibrios from faeces. V. cholerae produces
small, translucent colonies with a greyish black
centre and a turbid halo after 24 h of incubation.
The colonies become larger (3–4 mm in size)
after prolonged incubation of 48 h.
Alkaline BSA (pH 8.2) is another selective
medium used for V. cholerae. The colonies on
BSA are similar to those on nutrient agar.
Transport Media
These media are used to transport stool samples in
case of a delay in processing the specimens in the
laboratory. These help maintain the viability of V.
cholerae and prevent the bacteria from being
inhibited by normal intestinal bacterial ﬂora pres-
ent
in
stool
specimens.
Venkatraman–
Ramakrishnan (VR) medium and Cary–Blair
medium are two frequently used transport media.
VR medium is an alkaline medium with a pH
of 8.6–8.8. The medium is dispensed in screw-
capped bottles in 10–15 mL volumes. About
1–3 mL stool is to be added to each bottle.
Cary–Blair medium is a solid medium with an
alkaline pH of 8. It is a suitable transport medium
for Vibrio spp. as well as for Salmonella and
Shigella spp.
Enrichment Media

intestinal bacteria but favours the growth of V.
cholerae. Alkaline peptone water (APW) and
Monsur taurocholate tellurite peptone water are
two examples of transport media used for V.
cholerae.

Pramodhini)
Alkaline peptone water (APW) (pH 8.6) is a
frequently
used
medium
to
enrich
stool
specimens from patients convalescing from chol-
era, excreting a few bacteria in their stool.
Monsur taurocholate tellurite peptone water
(pH 9) is more selective for V. cholera due to
the presence of potassium tellurite.
V. cholerae ferments sugar with the production
of acid only but no gas. They ferment glucose,
sucrose, maltose, mannitol and mannose. It is a
late lactose fermenter and ferments lactose after
several days of incubation. It forms indole and
reduces nitrates to nitrites. V. cholerae shows
positive cholera red reaction by producing a
reddish-pink colour in the peptone water due to
the
formation
of
nitroso
indole.
The
two
properties of indole formation and reduction of
nitrates to nitrites form the basis of the cholera red
reaction. This reaction is tested by adding a few
drops of concentrated sulphuric acid to a 24-h
peptone water culture at 37 C. It is methyl red
positive and urease test negative. It liqueﬁes gel-
atin and decarboxylates lysine and ornithine, but
not arginine. The differences between Classical
and Eltor biotypes of V. cholerae are summarised
in Table 39.2.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
V. cholerae is most susceptible to heat, drying,
acids and common disinfectants. V. cholerae are
killed by heating at 56 C for 30 min and killed in
a few minutes in gastric juice of normal acidity.
They survive for several days in untreated excreta
of humans. They are resistant to high alkalinity.
They remain viable for 1–2 weeks in fresh seawa-
ter. They survive in pure tap water for up to

grossly contaminated water in rivers, most possi-
bly due to the presence of a large number of
bacteriophages in this water.

Antigenic Structure
V. cholerae possesses two antigens; Somatic O
antigen is present in the bacteria’s cell wall. It is a
group-speciﬁc antigen. Flagellar H antigen is a
heat-labile antigen present in the ﬂagella and is
shared by all strains of V. cholerae.
Classification
A consensus was laid down based on different
biochemical tests to differentiate vibrio and other
closely related genera (Table 39.3). In the 1930s,
two classiﬁcation systems were employed to seg-
regate vibrios among themselves.
Heiberg Classification
In 1934, Heiberg classiﬁed Vibrio into six groups
based on their ability to ferment sugar such as
mannose, sucrose and arabinose. Later, two more
groups were added to the Heiberg grouping.

Serological Classification
Based
on
somatic
carbohydrate
O
antigen,
V. cholerae has been classiﬁed into Group A
and B (Fig. 39.2). This serological classiﬁcation
was suggested by Gardner and Venkataraman
(1935). Group A vibrios included Cholera vibrios
sharing a common H antigen and biochemical
similarities, which have been classiﬁed broadly
into two groups: V. cholerae O1 and non-O1 V.
cholerae:
V. cholerae O1 agglutinate with antisera to the
O1 group and are called cholera vibrios or agglu-
tinable vibrios. Based on their biochemical
parameters, V. cholerae O1 is subdivided into
two biotypes—Eltor and Classical. Each biotype
has been divided into three subtypes—Ogawa,
Inaba and Hikojima (Table 39.5). This classiﬁca-
tion is based on the differences in minor O
antigens, such as A, B and C. Serotype Ogawa
contains A and B antigens, Inaba contains A and
C antigens and Hikojima contains all three
antigens A, B and C. Hence, Hikojima strains
are agglutinated by both Ogawa and Inaba

(NCV)
or
non-
agglutinating
vibrios
(NAG)
(Fig.
39.2).
Non-cholera vibrios are
classiﬁed into
138
serotypes designated from O2 to O139. Of
these serotypes, only V. cholerae O139 causes
cholera in humans. The rest of the serotypes
(O2–O138) do not cause any disease in humans.
Phage Typing
V. cholerae O1 biotype Classical has been
divided into ﬁve types based on four phages (I,
II, III and IV) by phage typing. All these phages
lyse biotype Classical but not Eltor strains. Based
on these four phages and an additional ﬁfth
phage, V. cholerae biotype Eltor can also be
divided into six types.

Pathogenesis
Cholera is a toxin-mediated disease.
Virulence Factors
V. cholerae has many virulence factors that
include cholera toxin, toxin co-regulated pilus
(TCP),
adhesin
factor
(ACF),
haemagglu-
tination-protease (hap; mucinase), neuraminidase
and
siderophores
that
contribute
to
the

pathogenesis of cholera (Table 39.6). Most of
these virulence factors are expressed by multiple
chromosomal genes present in the bacteria.
V. cholerae, like Gram-negative bacilli, also
possesses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The
LPS has no role in the pathogenesis of cholera
but is responsible for the immunity produced by
the killed V. cholerae vaccine.

Cholera Toxin or CT (CTx)
It is an exotoxin and the most important virulence
factor produced by V. cholerae. The toxin, known
as choleragen or cholera enterotoxin, is structur-
ally and functionally similar to the heat-labile
enterotoxin of Escherichia coli. It is a heat-labile
protein of molecular weight 85,600 kDa and is
destroyed by heating at 56 C for 30 min. The
toxin consists of a single A subunit of molecular
weight 27,215 kDa and ﬁve B subunits each of
molecular weight 11,677 kDa. Subunit A consists
of two fragments—A1 and A2, which remain
covalently connected by a single disulphide
bond. The A2 fragment links the active A frag-
ment to the B subunit. The A (active) subunit is
responsible for the biological activity of the toxin.
The B (binding) subunit helps bind the toxin to
the receptors in the mucosa. The genes CTx A
and CTx B are responsible for expressing these
two cholera toxin subunits.

Biological functions
Cholera toxin
Inhibits absorption of sodium and chloride in the intestine; causes hypersecretion of
large volumes of water and electrolytes, activation of adenylate cyclase and over-
production of cAMP.
Toxin co-regulated pilus
Helps in adherence of Vibrio cholerae to mucosal cells of the intestine
Accessory colonisation
Helps in the adhesion of bacteria to the intestinal mucosa
Haemagglutination-protease
(mucinase)
Induces intestinal inﬂammation and also helps in releasing free vibrios from the bound
mucosa to the intestinal lumen
Neuraminidase
Increases toxin receptors for Vibrio cholerae
Siderophores
Causes sequestration of iron
Cholera toxin has many biological functions.
This inhibits the absorption capacity and activates
the excretory chloride transport in the intestinal
enterocytes, eventually leading to the loss of
sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen. It also
inhibits the absorption of sodium and chloride in
the intestine. Furthermore, it also increases skin
capillary permeability. Hence, it is also called a
permeability factor. A skin bluing test can detect
the permeability factor. In this test, cholera toxin
is injected intradermally in rabbits or guinea pigs,
followed by an intravenous injection of Evans
blue. In a positive test, the skin at the injection
site becomes blue due to increased capillary
permeability.
Many tests can demonstrate the cholera toxin.
Rabbit ileal loop test was one of the classical
methods developed by De and Chatterjee in 1952.
It is a widely used method in which injection of V.
cholerae culture or culture ﬁltrate into the ligated
ileal loop causes ﬂuid accumulation, leading to a
ballooning of the ileal loop. The toxin can also be
detected by ELISA and rapid immunoﬂuores-
cence tests, chemical estimation of cAMP in
tumour cells that have been treated with the
toxin, and demonstration of histological changes
in adrenal tumour (Y1) cells, elongation of Chi-
nese hamster ovary cells and activation of lipoly-
sis in rat testicular tissue.

Vibrio cholerae
569
The A and B subunits of CT are encoded by
ctxA and ctxB genes, respectively. These genes
are located on the chromosome, forming an
operon where ctxA precedes ctxB. The Vibrio
Pathogenicity Island (VPI) codes for a regulatory
protein, ToxT, which activates the transcription
of both the ctxAB. Upon activation, the CT is
secreted and is transported across the outer mem-
brane by a type II secretion system. It is known as
Eps for extracellular protein secretion, which
comprises 15 gene products, 12 of which are
required for translocation of speciﬁc substrates,
including CT and hemagglutinin, across the outer
membrane. The energy for secretion is obtained
from EpsE, a cytoplasmic ATPase.
Other Virulence Factors
These include TCP which helps in adherence of
V. cholerae to mucosal cells of the intestines.
Accessory colonisation also helps in the adhe-
sion
of
bacteria
to
the
intestinal
mucosa.
Haemagglutination-protease (mucinase), for-
merly known as cholera lectin, is both agglutinin-
and zinc-dependent protease. The enzyme splits
mucus and ﬁbronectin and a subunit of the chol-
era toxin. It induces intestinal inﬂammation and
also helps in releasing free vibrios from the bound
mucosa to the intestinal lumen. Neuraminidase
destroys neuraminic acid, thereby increasing
toxin receptors for the V. cholerae. Siderophores
are responsible for the sequestration of iron.
Pathogenesis of Cholera
Cholera
is
an
acute
diarrhoeal
disease.
V. cholerae enters the body orally through
contaminated water and food (Fig. 39.3). The
infective dose of V. cholerae is usually high,
more than 106 organisms/mL, because most
organisms are killed by high acidity in the stom-
ach. Vibrios are highly susceptible to the acidity
of the stomach. The conditions that reduce the
stomach’s acidity to pH above 5 make the host
more susceptible to infection by cholera vibrios.
The bacteria reach the mucous layer of the
small intestine by motility, chemotaxis and pro-
duction
of
proteolytic
enzymes.
A
haemagglutinin-protease breaks mucin and ﬁbro-
nectin of the intestinal mucosa. Subsequently,
bacteria adhere to the intestinal wall and colonise,
facilitated by TCP, a special ﬁmbria. The syn-
chronous action of CTx, TCP and a few other
virulence factors is regulated by Tox R gene
products, known as the master switch. Although
V. cholerae remains adhered to the intestinal epi-
thelium throughout infection, it does not cause
any histological changes or damage to the intesti-
nal mucosa.

Fig. 39.3 Colonisation of V. cholerae in the intestine
Vibrios, once adhered to the intestinal wall,
produce cholera toxin. The B (binding) unit of
the toxin binds to the GM1 ganglioside receptors
present on the surface of the jejunal epithelium
cells. The A (active) unit is transported into
enterocytes, within which it is split into two
components: A1 and A2. The A1 component is
linked to the B subunit and activates cellular
adenylate cyclase (cAMP). This inhibits the
absorption of sodium transport and activates the
excretory chloride transport in the intestinal epi-
thelial cells. This leads to the secretion of sodium
(Na), chloride (Cl) and potassium (K) and large
volumes of water in the lumen of the intestine
leading to watery diarrhoea. The toxin also
inhibits intestinal absorption of sodium and chlo-
ride by the microvilli. This leads to the large
secretion of water, which overcomes the absorp-
tive capacity of the lumen, eventually causing
diarrhoea (Fig. 39.4).

Clinical Syndromes
V. cholerae causes cholera, an acute diarrhoeal
disease, which may be rapidly fatal if not treated
immediately.
Cholera
The incubation period is short and varies from
2 to 3 days after ingestion of the bacteria. The
condition shows an abrupt onset of watery diar-
rhoea and vomiting. Profuse watery diarrhoea is
the most important manifestation of cholera.
The volume of diarrhoeic stool excreted in chol-
era is much more than that of diarrhoea caused by
any other infectious pathogen. Patients may
excrete as high as 250 mL of stool per kilogram
body weight in a day in a severe condition.
Cholera stool is profusely watery that is
colourless and odourless, free of proteins and
speckled with mucous. The cholera stool is often
described as rice-water stool (in colour and con-
sistency, stool resembles water washed off from
cooked rice). It contains a few leukocytes but no
erythrocytes because V. cholerae does not stimu-
late an inﬂammatory response in the intestinal
mucosa. It is a bicarbonate-rich electrolyte ﬂuid,
which contains little protein.
Severe abdominal cramp, possibly caused by
distension of the small intestine due to excretion
of larger volumes of intestinal ﬂuid, is also seen in
these patients. Vomiting is another important
manifestation of cholera and occurs in the early
stage of the disease. This is caused by decreased
gastric and intestinal motility.
Cholera, if left untreated, can lead to a severe
loss of ﬂuid and electrolytes due to diarrhoea and
vomiting. This could lead to isotonic dehydration,
metabolic
acidosis,
hypokalaemia
and
hypovolemic shock. Dehydration in cholera char-
acteristically develops very fast, within hours
after the onset of symptoms. In patients with
severe disease, diarrhoea leads to vascular pro-
lapse and shock, and patients may die of cardiac
arrhythmia and renal failure. Other complications
include
electrolyte
imbalance
and
hypoglycaemia. In untreated patients, the case
fatality rate has been estimated to vary from
25% to 50%. In patients treated well with replace-
ment of lost ﬂuid and electrolytes, the case fatality
is usually less than 1%.
V. cholerae O139 (Bengal vibrio) causes chol-
era, which can be as severe as that caused by
V. cholerae O1. It may occasionally cause inva-
sive disease-producing bacteraemia. V. cholerae
O139 strain shows a similar pathogenic mecha-
nism to that of V. cholerae O1 except that it
produces a unique O139 LPS and an immunolog-
ically related O antigen capsule. These two viru-
lence factors enhance the virulence of this
organism.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Fresh stool specimen collected before adminis-
tration of antibiotics is the specimen of choice.
The stool may be collected by introducing a ster-
ile soft rubber catheter (No: 24–26), or the liquid
stool may be collected directly in a screw-capped
container. Collection of stools from the bedpan is
not recommended due to the risk of contamina-
tion or the presence of disinfectants. Rectal
swabs may also be used for the collection of
specimens.
The collected stool or rectal swab specimen
should be sent to a laboratory for immediate

culture. If a delay is anticipated, the specimens
may be preserved at 4 C in a refrigerator or
transport media used for V. cholerae. The speci-
men may be transported in enrichment media,
such as APW or Monsur taurocholate transport
media and sent to a laboratory for processing
within a few hours. Stool or rectal swab is
inoculated into 10 mL of APW in a screw-capped
tube and into Monsur taurocholate transport
medium and is transported to the laboratory.
These are incubated at 37 C for 3–6 h, and
afterwards, the subculture is made on the selec-
tive media in case of a longer delay in transport;
the stool samples may be preserved in Cary–Blair
medium or VR ﬂuid for a long duration. In case of
non-availability of transport media, the watery
stool can be soaked in a strip of thick blotting
paper and sent to the laboratory—packed in a
plastic envelope.
Vibrio cholerae
571
Microscopy
Dark-ﬁeld microscopy is a useful method for
demonstrating the characteristic darting motility
of the bacilli and its inhibition by antisera. This is
a rapid method of examining stool collected from
cases or after enrichment for 6 h. Direct immu-
noﬂuorescence is another rapid method used to
demonstrate vibrios in the stool. However, micro-
scopic examination of a Gram-stained stool smear
is not recommended for diagnosing cholera.

preliminary identiﬁcation
of Vibrio spp. from other
closely related genera

referenceworkentry/10.
1007%2f978-03-642-
30144-5_90#page-1)
Culture and Identifications
The specimen collected in holding media is
inoculated ﬁrst in the enrichment media and
incubated for 6–8 h before being inoculated on
selective (TCBS or GTTA) and non-selective
media (BSA, MacConkey agar and blood agar).
The specimen may also be plated directly into
these media before enrichment. The specimens
collected in transport media are incubated for
6–8 h, including the transit time before inocula-
tion into the suitable media. The inoculated plates
are incubated at 37 C overnight. V. cholerae
produces
characteristic
yellow
colonies
on
TCBS and non-lactose-fermenting colonies on
MacConkey agar.
String test is a presumptive test for the identi-
ﬁcation of Vibrio species. In this test, a loopful of
the suspected colony from the culture media is
mixed with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in saline
on a clean glass slide. The loop is lifted upwards
slowly from this suspension to look for the string
formation (Fig. 39.5). A positive string test is
indicative of Vibrio spp., and there will not be
any string formation in the case of Aeromonas
and Plesiomonas shigelloides.
Colonies
on
media
are
identiﬁed
by
performing a series of tests. V. cholerae, which
is catalase positive and oxidase positive, ferments
sugar with a production of acid only but no gas.
They ferment glucose, sucrose, maltose, mannitol


and mannose. The bacteria are positive for chol-
era red reaction, form indole and reduce nitrates
to nitrites. They utilise amino acids, such as lysine
and
ornithine,
but
not
arginine.
Non-O1
V. cholerae does not agglutinate with O1 group
antisera and is designated as non-cholera-vibrios
or non-agglutinating vibrios. V. cholerae O1 is
identiﬁed as biotype Classical or Eltor depending
on their biochemical reactions.
572
39
Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas
Typing
Serotyping
Suspected V. cholerae is tested using speciﬁc
V. cholerae O1 antisera by slide agglutination.
In this test, the colonies are picked with a straight
wire and mixed with a drop of antisera on the
slide. Agglutination of the bacteria shows that the
test is positive for V. cholerae O1. If positive,
agglutination of bacteria is repeated using speciﬁc
Inaba and Ogawa sera for serotyping. Hikojima
strains agglutinate well with both Inaba and
Ogawa sera. If agglutination is negative, the test
is repeated with at least ﬁve more colonies, as
both O1 and non-O1 vibrios may coexist in the
same specimen.
Bio Typing
If the slide agglutination is positive and the col-
ony is identiﬁed as V. cholerae O1, then it is
tested by various tests to determine whether
isolated V. cholerae O1 is Classical or Eltor.
These tests include haemolysis of sheep RBCs,
agglutination of chick RBCs, sensitivity to
polymyxin
B,
VP
test
and
sensitivity
to
bacteriophages (Table 39.2).
Vibrio colonies that are not agglutinated with
V. cholerae O1 antisera are usually tested with
antisera
to
the
H
antigen.
Vibrio
isolates
agglutinated by H antisera but not by O1 antisera
are identiﬁed as non-O1 cholera vibrio. Such non-
cholera-vibrios are tested for O139 using speciﬁc
antisera against the O139 antigen.
Phage Typing
The isolated strains of V. cholerae O1 for phage
typing may be sent to the International Reference
Centre for Vibrio phage typing at the National
Institute
of
Cholera
and
Enteric
Diseases
(NICED) in Kolkata, West Bengal.
Molecular Typing
The pulsed-ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE),
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and MLST
of virulence gene (V-MLST) methods are the
three common methods for molecular typing of
Vibrio. Housekeeping genes like genes (cat, chi,
dnaE, gyrB, lap, pgm, recA, rstA and gmd) are
used for the PFGE and MLST, whereas V-MLST
uses virulence gene sequences like ctxAB, tcpA
and toxR. Among all, PFGE had a higher resolu-
tion ability.
Serology
The complement-dependent vibriocidal antibody
and antitoxin assays using live or killed vibrio
suspensions are useful for demonstrating vibrio
antibodies in the serum. These tests are useful for
seroepidemiological studies but are of little value
in diagnosing cases.
Molecular Detection
Classical, real-time, multiplex PCRs are the
molecular tools of choice for detecting Vibrio
sp. in samples. V. cholerae-speciﬁc ompW
sequence and the ctxA gene of the cholera toxin
are often ampliﬁed. Raid detection kits are now
available that uses RT-PCR-based detection of
the organisms.
Diagnosis of Carriers
Repeated stool culture is essential for isolating
V. cholerae from carriers because vibrios are
known to be excreted intermittently in their
stool. Collecting a stool after using a purgative
(such as mannitol or magnesium sulphate) or
examining bile collected by duodenal intubation
is frequently useful for diagnosing carriers.
Water Sample Testing
The water samples can be tested for the presence
of vibrios, and it usually involves two methods:
enrichment and ﬁltration. In the enrichment
method, 900 mL of the water to be tested for
Vibrio contamination is mixed with 100 mL of
10
peptone water (pH 9.2) and incubated at

37 C for 6–8 h. Further, a second enrichment is
done by repeating the procedure mentioned
above. After the second enrichment, the test sam-
ple is plated on selective media to look for the
growth of Vibrio. Inﬁltration method, the water
to be tested for Vibrio contamination is passed
through a Millipore membrane ﬁlter. Then, the
ﬁlter’s membrane is directly placed on selective
media and incubated at 37 C, overnight to see
any colony growth. However, sewage water
needs to be diluted in saline and passed through
gauze prior to testing water by either of the
methods mentioned above.

Treatment
Treatment of cholera includes replacement of
ﬂuid and electrolytes, and antibiotic therapy.
Replacement of Fluid and Electrolytes
The cholera treatment is primarily based on
the prompt and adequate replacement of ﬂuid
and electrolytes before massive ﬂuid loss leads
to hypovolemic shock. Replacement of ﬂuid by
oral administration of ﬂuid containing glucose
and electrolytes is the most successful and highly
effective method for treating cholera.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) solution
consisting of glucose, sodium chloride, potassium
chloride and sodium citrate is widely used. The
glucose facilitates the absorption of sodium in the
small intestine, and salts present in the ORT
restore the electrolyte balance and reverse acido-
sis. The ORT is highly cost-effective and is sim-
ple to use; hence it is widely used with
tremendous
success in
developing
countries
endemic to cholera. Cereal-based preparations,
such as thoroughly cooked and salted rice soup,
are equally effective for treating dehydration in
cholera cases. Immediate intravenous ﬂuid ther-
apy is usually recommended for more serious
cases of dehydration.
Antibiotic Therapy
Antibiotic therapy is of secondary importance
and is a supplement to ﬂuid therapy. Treatment
with antibiotics diminishes the duration and vol-
ume of ﬂuid loss. It also hastens clearance of the
Vibrio organisms from the intestine. V. cholerae
is uniformly sensitive to tetracycline, ciproﬂoxa-
cin and erythromycin. Tetracycline or doxycy-
cline is the drug of choice for adults and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
for
children.
Pyrazolidine is the usual recommended treatment
for pregnant females suffering from cholera. Of
late, strains resistant to ciproﬂoxacin have been
documented from Kolkata, India.
Epidemiology
V. cholerae is found naturally in the estuary and
marine environment worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Cholera continues to be a major health problem in
many parts of the world, including the Indian
subcontinent and sub-Sahara in Africa. The con-
dition has been rare in developed and industrious
nations for many decades. A majority of cases
have been reported from Africa and Asia. Cholera
occurs as an endemic, epidemic or pandemic
disease.
Cholera Pandemics
A total of six cholera pandemics occurred in the
nineteenth century, affecting Europe and the
United States, causing more than 115,000 deaths
in 1832 and 50,000 deaths in 1856. The seventh
pandemic of cholera appeared ﬁrst in the twenti-
eth century, starting in 1961, and affected ﬁve
continents by 1991. Unlike six earlier pandemics,
which were caused by V. cholerae biotype Clas-
sical, the seventh pandemic was caused by
V. cholerae biotype Eltor. The latter originated
in Asia in the 1960s, reached Africa in the early
1970s and was responsible for epidemic cholera.
In 1991, the pandemic reached Peru and subse-
quently spread rapidly through many countries of
South and Central America and the United States
and Canada. By mid-1995, more than one million
cases and 10,000 deaths due to the disease were
reported in the United States.
The seventh pandemic of cholera was differ-
ent from the previous pandemics of cholera in the
following ways:

574
39
Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas
1. It was the ﬁrst pandemic to be originated from
outside the Indian subcontinent. It originated
from Sulawesi (Celebes), Indonesia. From
here, it spread to Hong Kong and the
Philippines and entered India in 1964. By
1966, it entered and spread throughout the
Indian subcontinent and West Asia. The pan-
demic then spread to Africa and parts of south-
ern Europe in the 1970s.
2. It was the ﬁrst pandemic caused by V. cholerae
biotype Eltor in contrast to the earlier six
pandemics caused by V. cholerae biotype
Classical.
3. V. cholerae biotype Eltor, responsible for the
seventh pandemic, caused a less severe illness
with a large proportion of mild and asymptom-
atic infections. The mortality rate was low, but
characteristically carrier rate was high.
4. V. cholerae biotype Eltor has nearly replaced
the V. cholerae biotype Classical strain follow-
ing this pandemic spread. Hence, in countries
like India, V. cholerae Classical strains are
rarely encountered, but in Bangladesh, there
has been a resurgence of cholera caused by
V. cholerae Classical strains.
V. cholerae O139
In 1992, a new epidemic strain, V. cholerae O139
emerged as a cause of epidemic cholera in India.
This new epidemic strain was ﬁrst reported from a
cholera outbreak in Chennai in 1992, followed by
similar cholera outbreaks from different parts of
India. The new strain entered Bangladesh and
spread
across
the
country,
causing
cholera
epidemics by Jan. 1993. V. cholerae O139 is the
ﬁrst non-cholera Vibrio or non-cholera strain
associated with cholera epidemics. It is also
responsible for producing disease in individuals
previously infected with V. cholerae O1 strains.
Habitat
V. cholerae is a saltwater bacterium. In associa-
tion with plankton, the marine ecosystem is the
primary habitat of the bacteria. The bacteria can
multiply freely in the water. The number of bac-
teria in contaminated water increases during the
warm and hot months of the year. V. cholerae is
never found in normal humans. In infected
humans, V. cholerae inhabits the small intestine.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of the Infection
Humans and water are the two main reservoirs of
infection for cholera. Both chronic and convales-
cent carriers play an important role as reservoirs
in the transmission of infection. These chronic
carriers continuously excrete vibrios in their
stool intermittently for several years.
The infection is transmitted to humans by
ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hence,
the infection rate is highest in the areas where
hygienic community standards are low and pota-
ble water is not available. V. cholerae fails to
survive in an acidic environment. Therefore, any
condition (e.g. achlorhydria) that reduces gastric
acid production makes the person highly suscep-
tible to infection. People of all ages are suscepti-
ble to infection by V. cholerae. Infants, however,
are protected due to maternal antibodies transmit-
ted during breastfeeding. Animals do not play any
role in the transmission of the disease.
Prevention and Control
The preventive measures against cholera include
cholera
vaccination
and
general
preventive
measures.
Cholera Vaccines
Immunity in cholera may be produced against the
cholera toxin or the bacteria. An infection by
V. cholerae biotype Classical usually protects
against the infection caused by V. cholerae bio-
type Classical and Eltor strains. However, infec-
tion by V. cholerae biotype Eltor does not confer
protection against biotype Classical.
Killed Cholera Vaccines
These are the vaccines extensively used against
cholera. This vaccine is a suspension of 8000
million V. cholerae per millilitre, consisting of

equal numbers of Inaba and Ogawa serotypes.
This vaccine is given either subcutaneously or
intramuscularly in two doses at an interval of
4 weeks. This vaccine confers about 60% protec-
tion for a short duration of 3–6 months. The rate
of protection in endemic areas increases with age.
A single dose of vaccine is not effective in chil-
dren younger than 5 years but is effective in
adults. In order to improve the antigenic stimulus,
the number of organisms in the vaccine has been
increased to 12,000 million/mL.
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
575
Non-living oral B Subunit Whole-cell Vaccine
(WC/rBS Vaccine)
This is a non-living oral B subunit whole-cell
vaccine. It consists of heat-killed whole-cell
V. cholerae O1 (2.5  1010) combined with the
puriﬁed recombinant B subunit of cholera toxoid
(WC/rBS). The vaccine is administered in two
doses at an interval of 1 week. This vaccine is
currently available in Sweden and Latin America.
Clinical trials carried out in Bangladesh, Peru and
Sweden have shown that the vaccine is safe and
confers 85–90% protection during 6 months in all
age groups after administration of two doses.
Live Oral Cholera Vaccine (CVD 103-Hg R
Vaccine)
This is an oral cholera vaccine. It consists of an
attenuated
live
oral
genetically
modiﬁed
V. cholerae O1 strain (CVD 103-Hg R). It
induces local immunity by the production of
IgA antibodies in the gut. This cholera vaccine
developed by the Swiss Sera and Vaccine Insti-
tute is available in Europe, Latin America and
Canada. The vaccine is extremely immunogenic
and highly protective against moderate and severe
cholera
cases.
The
vaccine
trials
in
adult
volunteers in the United States have shown that
a single dose confers high protection (95%)
against V. cholerae Classical and 65% protection
against V. cholerae Eltor following a booster dose
given after 3 months.
General Preventive Measures
These include early identiﬁcation and case man-
agement, improved water supply and sanitation,
improved personal hygiene and health education.
Non-Cholera Vibrios
V. cholerae serotypes from O2 to O139 are
non-cholera-vibrios, non-agglutinable vibrios or
V. cholerae non-O1 vibrios. They are similar to
V. cholerae O1 biochemically and genetically. As
mentioned earlier, V. cholerae O139 is the only
example of non-cholera-vibrios that causes chol-
era. Non-cholera-vibrios other than V. cholerae
O139 are widely found in aquatic environments.
In humans, they may cause mild to severe
diarrhoeal disease resembling cholera. Occasion-
ally, they may also cause wound infections,
septicaemia and other extraintestinal infections.
Vibrio mimicus
V. mimicus is so named because it resembles
V.
cholerae
in
its
biochemical
reactions.
V. mimicus, unlike V. cholerae, does not ferment
sucrose, but like V. cholerae, it grows well at a
0.5–1% concentrated sodium chloride. Infection
is acquired by eating seafood, especially oysters.
The organisms cause a gastrointestinal disease,
which is usually self-limited. V. mimicus has
been associated with many sporadic cases of
diarrhoeal disease on the gulf coast of the United
States.
Halophilic Vibrios
Vibrios that require a higher concentration of
sodium chloride are known as halophilic vibrios.
They are natural inhabitants of seawater and
marine
life.
V.
parahaemolyticus,
Vibrio
alginolyticus and V. vulniﬁcus are three important
halophilic Vibrio species that cause human
infection.
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
V. parahaemolyticus is now recognised as an
important cause of sea food-associated gastroen-
teritis worldwide. V. parahaemolyticus is a
curved Gram-negative bacillus that resembles

V. cholerae. However, it differs from V. cholerae
by having a capsule showing bipolar staining and
pleomorphism. Like other vibrios, it has polar
ﬂagella when grown in liquid culture but shows
peritrichous ﬂagella when grown on solid media.
The organism fails to grow in the medium without
sodium chloride. It can grow well in salt
concentrations up to 8% and at an optimum salt
concentration of 2–4%. On MacConkey agar, it
produces
colourless
non-lactose-fermenting
colonies; on blood agar, it forms beta-haemolytic
colonies. The colonies on TCBS agar are non-
sucrose-fermenting
green
colonies
with
an
opaque and raised centre and translucent periph-
ery. V. parahaemolyticus is oxidase, catalase,
indole and citrate positive. It reduces nitrates to
nitrites. It ferments glucose, mannose, maltose,
mannitol and arabinose with acid production
only. It does not ferment sucrose, lactose and
salicin. It decarboxylates lysine and ornithine
but not arginine. It is VP positive.
576
39
Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas
Thermostable haemolysin is the key virulence
factor of V. parahaemolyticus. This virulence fac-
tor is found only in strains that are pathogenic to
humans. Strains isolated from humans possess
this toxin, hence are pathogenic, while strains
isolated from environmental sources, such as
water, crabs, oysters, or ﬁsh, do not possess this
thermostable
toxin,
hence
they
are
non-pathogenic.
The
pathogenic
strains
of
V.
parahaemolyticus, when grown on a special
high-salt mannitol medium (Wagatsuma agar),
show haemolysis on blood agar. This is called
the Kanagawa phenomenon. This haemolysis
is caused by a thermostable haemotoxin released
by pathogenic strains known as Kanagawa-
positive strains. Non-pathogenic strains isolated
from the environment that do not cause any
haemolysis on the blood agar are Kanagawa-neg-
ative strains.
V. parahaemolyticus in humans causes gastro-
enteritis. The severity of the condition can vary
from mild self-limited diarrhoea to an acute ill-
ness. After an incubation period of 5–72 h, the
patients with gastroenteritis manifest as eosino-
philic
watery
diarrhoea.
The
condition
is
associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain and low-grade fever, which may be present
for 3 days. Stool usually does not contain any
blood or mucus but contains cellular exudates.
The patient usually recovers within 3 days.
V. parahaemolyticus also causes extraintestinal
infections, such as wound infections and ear and
eye
infections
in
individuals
exposed
to
contaminated seawater.
V. parahaemolyticus is widely distributed in
the estuary and marine environments. Seafood,
such as ﬁsh, crabs or oysters, is the main source
and reservoir of infection. The infection is
acquired
through
the
consumption
of
contaminated
seafood.
V.
parahaemolyticus,
although widely found in sea ﬁsh in some parts
of India, is relatively less common in human
infections.
Vibrio alginolyticus
V. alginolyticus is another halophilic vibrio. It
shows a high-salt tolerance and can grow even
in the presence of 10% sodium chloride. On
TCBS agar, it forms large yellow sucrose-
fermenting colonies
(Table
39.7). It
shows
swarming on the surface of the non-selective
medium, such as blood agar. V. alginolyticus is
widely distributed in seawater and seafood.
V. alginolyticus is associated with infections of
superﬁcial wounds exposed to contaminated sea-
water. It also has been associated with infections
of the gastrointestinal tract, ear and eye.
Vibrio vulnificus
V. vulniﬁcus is a halophilic vibrio, formerly
known as L+ vibrio or Benekea vulniﬁcus. Like
V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulniﬁcus is a Gram-
negative bacillus and facultative anaerobe that
requires salt for growth. It also produces green
non-sucrose-fermenting
colonies
on
TCBS
medium. It differs from V. parahaemolyticus
and other Vibrio species by its ability to ferment
lactose. Relatively, V. vulniﬁcus is a more virulent
bacterium than V. parahaemolyticus. The pres-
ence of capsule and the production of hydrolytic






enzymes, such as cytolysins, proteases and
collagenases, are responsible for the virulence of
the bacteria. These organisms are also resistant to
complement- and antibody-mediated lysis.

V. vulniﬁcus is a natural inhabitant of sea
water. V. vulniﬁcus infections are usually food-
borne diseases and are largely associated with
ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood and
exposure of the wound to contaminated seawater.
V. vulniﬁcus infection in humans produces two
types of illness; wound infection and gastroenter-
itis rapidly progressing to septicaemia. Diagnosis
of the condition is made by isolating the bacteria
from wounds and blood. Since V. vulniﬁcus
produces life-threatening illness, immediate and
prompt treatment with antibiotics is essential.
Tetracyclines
or
aminoglycosides
are
the
antibiotics of choice to treat the condition.
Other Vibrio Species
Other Vibrio species associated with occasional
human infection include Vibrio ﬂuvialis, Vibrio
furnissii, Vibrio damsela and Vibrio hollisae.
These species are associated with gastroenteritis,
wound infections and bacteremia. Rare bacter-
emia infections by Vibrio metschnikovii have
also been documented.
Genus Aeromonas
The members of the genus Aeromonas are
Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacilli that
morphologically resemble other members of the
family Vibrionaceae. At least 16 species of
Aeromonas have been described, of which 11 spe-
cies
are
associated
with
human
disease.
Aeromonas
hydrophila,
Aeromonas
caviae,
Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas schubertii and
Aeromonas jandai are most important species.
Aeromonas are motile bacilli in the presence of
polar ﬂagella. They are catalase positive, oxidase
positive and nitrate positive. They ferment sugar
with the production of both acid and gas. They
grow at an optimum temperature of 32 C and a
pH of 7. Aeromonas spp. are widely distributed in
brackish water and soil. Aeromonas spp. in
humans
cause
gastroenteritis
and
wound
infections. Aeromonas species are known to col-
onise the intestinal tract of humans in approxi-
mately 3% of individuals. Therefore, isolation of
the bacteria from a stool by culture does not
indicate disease by Aeromonas species. It needs
careful interpretation by considering the clinical
presentation of the illness. Aeromonas species are
susceptible to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and
trimethoprim-sulfphamethoxazole.
They
are
resistant to penicillin, mostly cephalosporins and
erythromycin.
Genus Plesiomonas
Plesiomonas species are oxidase-positive, Gram-
negative and facultative anaerobes differentiated
from genera Aeromonas and Vibrio of the family
Vibrionaceae by some biochemical reactions.
P. shigelloides is the only species described in
the genus Plesiomonas. It is serologically related
to Shigella sonnei and shows agglutination with
S. sonnei antiserum. However, it differs from
Shigella by being oxidase positive and motile in
the presence of polar ﬂagella. P. shigelloides in
humans causes gastroenteritis.

Case Study
There was an outbreak of diarrhoea during a
major festival in which many people participated.
More than 20 people were admitted to the local
hospital with a history of severe watery diarrhoea.
Most of the patients were dehydrated. They were
treated with ﬂuid and electrolytes to maintain
ﬂuid balance. All the patients recovered. The
stool was positive for V. cholerae by culture,
and the strain was found to be V. cholerae O1
by serotyping.

Haemophilus and Bordetella
40
The members of the genus Haemophilus are
small, sometimes pleomorphic, Gram-negative,
non-motile and non-sporing organisms. They
require one or both accessory growth factors,
namely, X and V, present in the blood. Hence,
the genus derived its name from its essential
growth requirement of certain factors, such as X
and V present in the blood (Haemophilus: haem,
blood; philus, loving). In the year 1883, Koch
isolated Haemophilus aegyptius, the ﬁrst member
of the genus from a case of conjunctivitis in
Egypt.
Genus Haemophilus
Haemophilus spp. are obligate bacteria present in
the mucous membranes of humans and certain
species of animals. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and
Haemophilus ducreyi are two major species
associated
with
human
diseases.
Other
Haemophilus
species
are
rarely
pathogenic.
They are responsible primarily for opportunistic
infections (Table 40.1).
Haemophilus influenzae
H. inﬂuenzae is the species most commonly
associated with human disease. It is an important
cause of meningitis in children and also of respi-
ratory tract infection in children as well as in
adults.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
H. inﬂuenzae is a small, pleomorphic, Gram-
negative bacillus and measures 1  0.3 μm. In
fresh
cultures,
the
bacteria
are
usually
coccobacilli, while long ﬁlamentous forms are
seen
in
older
cultures.
Some
strains
of
H. inﬂuenzae possess polysaccharides capsule.
The capsule can be detected by Indian ink prepa-
ration or by capsular swelling reaction using type-
speciﬁc antiserum.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
H. inﬂuenzae is a fastidious bacterium. It is a
facultative anaerobe and grows better in anaero-
bic
conditions.
The
optimal
temperature
is
35–37 C. The presence of 5–10% CO2 enhances
the growth of the bacteria. H. inﬂuenzae requires
two erythrocytic growth factors, X and V factors;
hence they grow on blood agar and chocolate
agar. The X factor is a heat-stable factor present
in the blood. It is a protoporphyrin IX, haemin or
another iron-containing porphyrin. X factor is
required to synthesise iron-containing bacterial
enzymes, such as catalase, cytochrome oxidase
and peroxidase. V factor is a heat-labile factor
present in red blood cells and other animal and
plant cells. This factor is destroyed at 120 C in
30 min. This factor is also synthesised by Staphy-
lococcus aureus and also by some fungi. Earlier,
this factor was thought to be a vitamin; hence it
was named the V factor. This has now been

identiﬁed as NAD or NADP coenzyme I. The V
factor acts as a hydrogen acceptor in the
oxidation-reduction
process
in
a
replicating
bacterial cell.

H. inﬂuenzae produces large colonies on the
blood or chocolate agar by any of the following
methods:
Blood Agar
Growth of H. inﬂuenzae on ordinary blood agar is
scanty, and the colonies are small because the V
factor is not freely available to be found inside the
red blood cells. H. inﬂuenzae does not produce
any haemolysis on blood agar. Staphylococci
produce V factor; hence growth on blood agar
can be promoted by providing S. aureus as the
source of V factor. This method is known as
satellitism. Hence, blood agar with S. aureus
streak is routinely used to culture and identify
H. inﬂuenzae.
Chocolate Agar
V factor is released from erythrocytes by heating
blood agar at 80–90 C in order to prepare choc-
olate agar. The released V factor from the
erythrocytes supplements the growth of colonies.
Chocolate
agar
containing
penicillin
and
bacitracin is used to isolate H. inﬂuenzae from
clinical specimens, which consist of normal bac-
terial ﬂora.
Fildes Agar or Levinthal Agar
These are clear and transparent media used for
primary isolation and culture of H. inﬂuenzae.
These are prepared by boiling and ﬁltering a
mixture of blood and nutrient broth (Levinthal
agar) or adding a peptic digest of blood to nutrient
agar (Fildes agar).
H. inﬂuenzae is catalase and oxidase positive.
It ferments glucose and galactose, but does not
ferment lactose, sucrose and mannitol. It reduces
nitrates to nitrites.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
H. inﬂuenzae is a delicate bacillus. It is readily
killed within 30 min by moist heat at 55 C. It dies
within a few days at 4 C as well as in culture
plates and dies in less than 2 days in dried clinical
secretions. Bacteria are sensitive to commonly
used
disinfectants
and
also
to
desiccation.
Cultures are difﬁcult to maintain due to autolysis.
Cultures
may
be
preserved
by
frequent
subcultures on chocolate agar. Lyophilisation is
a good method for the long-term preservation of
H. inﬂuenzae culture.
H. influenzae Antigens
Three major surface antigens are present in
H. inﬂuenzae. They are capsular polysaccharide
antigen, outer membrane protein (OMP) and
lipooligosaccharide.
Capsular polysaccharide antigen is the
major antigenic determinant of encapsulated
H. inﬂuenzae. This antigen is present in the cap-
sulated strain, which produces a capsule that is a

polysaccharide in nature. This antigen is not
found in unencapsulated strains of H. inﬂuenzae.
The polysaccharide antigen confers type speciﬁc-
ity to the organism and is the basis for the group-
ing of organisms into six antigenic serotypes.
These six antigenic serotypes are designated as
a, b, c, d, e and f. Type b capsular polysaccharide
is a host-protective antigen containing polyribo-
sylribitol phosphate (PRP), hence it is used in
several PRP vaccines and PRP–protein conjugate
vaccines. These proteins induce IgG, IgM and
IgA antibodies which are bactericidal, opsonic
and protective. H. inﬂuenzae serotype b was
responsible for more than 95% of all invasive
Haemophilus
infections
before
introducing
H. inﬂuenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. But after
introducing the Hib vaccine, speciﬁcally directed
against H. inﬂuenzae serotype b, most of the
diseases caused by this serotype have been
reduced. After the vaccination era, serotypes c
and
f
and
non-encapsulated,
non-typeable
H.
inﬂuenzae
are
responsible
for
most
H. inﬂuenzae diseases.

Pathogenesis
Haemophilus are the obligate bacteria present in
the mucous membranes of humans and certain
species of animals.
Virulence Factors
H. inﬂuenzae produces the following virulent
factors:
Capsular polysaccharide is the major viru-
lence factor in Hib. This polysaccharide capsule,
which contains ribose, ribitol and phosphate,
known as PRP, is antiphagocytic. It resists phago-
cytosis of the bacteria by leucocytes. Loss of
capsule leads to loss of virulence of the bacteria.
Other virulent factors include lipid A lipopoly-
saccharide, IgA1 protease and Pili, functions of
which are listed in Table 40.2.
Pathogenesis of Haemophilus influenzae
Infections
The encapsulated strains, such as strain type b, are
usually associated with invasive conditions, such
as pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia, cellulitis,
septic arthritis, etc. (Fig. 40.1).
H. inﬂuenzae enters the human host by the
respiratory route. Pili and non-pilous adhesions
of
the
bacteria
mediate
colonisation
of
H. inﬂuenzae in the oropharynx or nasopharynx.
Lipid A lipopolysaccharide impairs ciliary func-
tion, leading to damage to the respiratory mucosa.
A large bacterial load or the presence of a con-
comitant viral infection can potentiate the bacte-
rial infection that invades the mucosa and enter
the bloodstream. The clearance of bacteremia is
determined by the presence of antibodies, com-
plement
components
and
phagocytes.
The
absence of anti-PRP antibodies contributes to
bacterial multiplication. Subsequent high-grade
bacteraemia leads to the dissemination of bacteria
to various sites, including meninges, subcutane-
ous tissues, joints and even pleura and pericar-
dium.
Bacteraemia
usually
precedes
Hib
meningitis and other invasive Hib diseases. Direct
extension of infection from the sinuses or ears is
rare. Meningitis occurs due to inﬂammation,
oedema and increased cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
pressure. Brain parenchymal invasion is rare.

strains cause infection by direct extension from

direct extension to sinuses causes sinusitis, to
the Eustachian tube causes otitis media and
down the respiratory tract results in bronchitis
and pneumonia.
Clinical Syndromes
Infections Caused by Encapsulated
Haemophilus influenzae
Meningitis is the most serious manifestation of
Hib infection. It occurs primarily in children of
2 months to 2 years of age. Altered mental state
and fever are the most common symptoms. Head-
ache and photophobia are usually present in older
children. The mortality rate is above 90% in
untreated children. Hib meningitis is rare in
adults. Laryngo-epiglottitis is the second most
common infection of H. inﬂuenzae and is a life-
threatening emergency. Since the Hib vaccine
era, this condition is seen in children of 3–-
18 months of age. This condition is characterised
by cellulitis and obstructive laryngeal oedema.
Pneumonia typically occurs in infants and is
clinically indistinguishable from other bacterial
pneumonia.
The
condition
is
frequently
accompanied by empyema and meningitis. Bron-
chitis is an acute exacerbation of chronic bron-
chitis
and
bronchiectasis.
H.
inﬂuenzae
is
considered
a
pathogen
in
association
with
pneumococci.
Hib
can
cause
suppurative
lesions, such as epiglottitis, pericarditis, cellulitis
and septic arthritis. Endophthalmitis, cervical
adenitis, osteomyelitis and endocarditis are less
common invasive infections caused by Hib.

Haemophilus influenzae
583
Infections Caused by Non-encapsulated
Haemophilus influenzae
Non-encapsulated H. inﬂuenzae, which colonises
up to 80% of individuals along with Streptococ-
cus pneumoniae, is the most common cause of
otitis media. It is a major causative agent of
conjunctivitis in older children, next only to
S. pneumoniae. This is the most common cause
of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia
in adults.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
CSF and blood are the specimens of choice for the
diagnosis of meningitis. One to two millilitres of
CSF are usually collected from the patients for
performing various tests. In meningitis, the CSF
shows pleocytosis (mean 4000–5000 WBC/mL)
with a predominance of neutrophils. It shows
decreased CSF glucose level and elevated CSF
protein. Blood is cultured to diagnose cellulitis,
epiglottitis, arthritis or pneumonia caused by Hib.
Throat swab, pus and aspirates from joints, mid-
dle ear and sinuses are the other specimens col-
lected depending on the lesions caused by
H. inﬂuenzae.
All the specimens are collected under strict
aseptic conditions in sterile containers. Since
H.
inﬂuenzae
is
very
sensitive
to
low
temperatures, the clinical specimens are never
refrigerated but are kept in an incubator at 37 C
before
transporting
to
the
laboratory.
The
specimens are transported immediately to the lab-
oratory for processing and better isolation of the
pathogen.

Microscopy
Gram-staining smear of the CSF shows small,
Gram-negative coccobacilli in more than 80% of
the CSF from cases of untreated meningitis
(Fig. 40.2). Gram-stained smear is also useful as
a
rapid
diagnostic
method
to
demonstrate
H. inﬂuenzae in lower respiratory tract disease
and arthritis.
Culture and Identifications
Detection of H. inﬂuenzae in blood, CSF or other
body ﬂuids by culture conﬁrms the diagnosis of
H. inﬂuenzae infection. CSF culture is useful in
cases of meningitis. On chocolate agar or
Levinthal agar, H. inﬂuenzae colonies appear as
1–2 mm, smooth and opaque colonies after 24 h
of incubation.
H. inﬂuenzae on blood agar can also be
detected by satellites. In this procedure, a
suspected isolate of H. inﬂuenzae is streaked on
a blood agar plate. Then S. aureus is streaked
across the same blood agar plate and incubated
at 37
C for 18–24 h. After incubation, the
colonies of H. inﬂuenzae nearer to the S. aureus

are larger than those away from it. This phenom-
enon is known as satellitism. This demonstrates
that the V factor is available in increased concen-
tration near the staphylococcal colony and a
lower concentration away from it (Fig. 40.3).

Haemophilus and Bordetella
Blood culture is useful in cases of epiglottitis
and pneumonia.
Small,
pleomorphic,
Gram-negative
coccobacilli of the bacterial isolates are catalase
and oxidase positive and demonstrate satellitism

Typing
The serotyping of encapsulated H. inﬂuenzae is
carried out by several methods, including agglu-
tination
reaction,
Quellung
reaction,
co-agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) methods.
Quellung reaction is carried out by using
antisera
prepared
against
type-speciﬁc
polysaccharides. Fresh isolates from infected
patients or primary isolates can be typed by this
method. DNA probe is used currently for typing
encapsulated H. inﬂuenzae. The probe hybridises
with a fragment to chromosomal DNA, which
codes for the production of capsular antigen.
However,
non-capsulated
strains
cannot
be
typed; hence they are called non-typable strains.
Fig. 40.3 Haemophilus inﬂuenzae showing satellitism
Antigen Detection
Detection of H. inﬂuenzae PRP capsular antigen
in the CSF and urine is a rapid and sensitive
method
for
diagnosing
Hib
disease.
These
antigens can be detected by CIEP, LAT, Co-A
and ELISA. The disadvantage of the antigen
detection test is that it can detect only Hib infec-
tion, but
not other capsular
serotypes
and
non-encapsulated
strains
of
H.
inﬂuenzae
(because all the strains lack capsules, they do
not have capsular polysaccharide antigen).
Molecular Detection
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) is the preferred choice for detecting the
bacterium. Primers targeting omp P6, rnpB, 16S
rRNA and bexA genes etc. are commonly used. A
commercial kit for RT-PCR-based detection of
H. inﬂuenzae has been developed.

Haemophilus influenzae
585
Treatment
Antibiotics
are
the
mainstay
of
treatment.
H. inﬂuenzae is susceptible to sulphonamides,
chloramphenicol,
ciproﬂoxacin,
ampicillin,
cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Cefotaxime and cef-
triaxone are the initial drugs of choice to treat Hib
meningitis. These antibiotics given parenterally to
patients
with
uncomplicated
meningitis
for
7–14 days are effective.
Penicillins are useful in managing mucosal
infections
caused
by
non-encapsulated
H. inﬂuenzae. As many as 25–50% of isolates
produce beta-lactamase; therefore, they are resis-
tant to this class of drugs. Beta-lactamase-produc-
ing
oral
antibiotics,
with
activity
against
H.
inﬂuenzae,
include
trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime axetil, ceﬁxime,
clarithromycin, azithromycin and ciproﬂoxacin.
These drugs are given for 10 days in otitis
media cases and for at least 14 days for sinusitis.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Hib was a leading cause of infections among
children worldwide before Hib vaccines became
available. After the availability of the Hib vac-
cine, the frequency of invasive Hib disease has
reduced remarkably even in developing countries.
The frequency of Hib infection has come down to
only 2–3 cases/100,000 children below 5 years.
So,
most
Hib
infection
now
occurs
in
non-immune children due to incomplete vaccina-
tion or poor antibody response to the vaccine and
in elderly people.
In developed countries with the successful
implementation of the Hib vaccination program,
the
disease
caused
by
other
serotypes
of
encapsulated bacteria and non-typeable strains
of H. inﬂuenzae is increasingly recognised.
Habitat
H. inﬂuenzae is a strict human pathogen. Humans
are the only natural hosts. Non-encapsulated
strains are regular commensals of the nasopharyn-
geal mucosa and the oropharynx. They colonise
at the site in virtually all children within the ﬁrst
few months of life. In contrast, H. inﬂuenzae
serotype b is rarely found in the upper respiratory
tract or, if found, is present in a few children
(1–5% of cases).
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Human cases are an important reservoir of infec-
tion. The infected nasopharyngeal mucosal secre-
tion is the most common source of infection.
Transmission is by inhalation of respiratory tract
droplets or by direct contact. Transmission to
neonates occurs through the maternal genital
tract. Non-typable H. inﬂuenzae biotype 4 can
colonise the genital tract and is a major cause of
invasive disease in neonates.
Prevention and Control
Antibodies directed against the PRP component
of the capsule play a primary role in conferring
immunity. Newborns have a low risk of infection
because of the passive transfer of maternal
antibodies. By the age of 5 years, most children
have naturally acquired antibodies. Antibodies
against this capsule are protective. It promotes
bacterial phagocytosis and complement-mediated
bactericidal activities. These antibodies are pro-
duced during natural infection or on vaccination
with puriﬁed PRP or passive transfer of maternal
antibodies from mother to children. The risk of
meningitis and epiglottitis is much higher in
patients with no anti-PRP antibodies or patients
with a low level of complement.
Vaccines
Now routinely given to infants and children, Hib
conjugate vaccine is highly effective. The vaccine
has reduced the prevalence of invasive Hib dis-
ease. The vaccine elicits a protective antibody
response and prevents Hib disease by reducing
pharyngeal colonisation with Hib. However, the
Hib conjugate vaccine is not effective against
disease caused by non-typable H. inﬂuenzae.
Currently, three types of Hib vaccines are
available. These vary in a. the protein carrier

used, b. the molecular size of the saccharide and
c. the method of conjugating the protein to the
saccharide. These vaccines are (a) HbOC (mutant
diphtheria toxin as the carrier protein) vaccine,
(b) PRP-T (tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein)
vaccine and iii) PRP-OMP (major OMP of
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B as the carrier
protein) vaccine.
586
40
Haemophilus and Bordetella
The HbOC or PRP-T vaccine is injected in a
three-dose regimen, while the PRP-OMP vaccine
is given in a two-dose regimen at 2-month
intervals, and the ﬁrst dose is given at the age of
2 months. A booster dose is given at the age of
12–15 months. These vaccines are well-tolerated.
Occasionally, they cause redness and swelling at
the vaccination site in 10–15% of infants, espe-
cially after the ﬁrst dose rather than after
subsequent injections.
Chemoprophylaxis
Chemoprophylaxis by rifampicin is used to
reduce the colonisation of Hib disease in children
with high risk. Such high-risk group includes
children below 2 years in a family or day care
centre where a systemic disease is reported.
Haemophilus ducreyi
H. ducreyi was ﬁrst described by Auguste Ducrey
in 1889. It is an obligate bacterium. H. ducreyi
grows poorly on most media, requires X factor,
but not V factor, and is biochemically inert. It
produces very small colonies (0.5-mm diameter)
on chocolate agar after prolonged incubation of
72 h in the presence of CO2.
In Asia and Africa, H. ducreyi is an important
causative agent of the sexually transmitted dis-
ease called soft sore or chancroid. The chan-
croid is seen most commonly in men, and the
condition remains asymptomatic in women. The
incubation period varies from 5 to 7 days, after
which a papule with an erythematous surface
appears on the genitalia or the perianal area. Sub-
sequently, the lesion ulcerates and becomes pain-
ful. The condition is frequently associated with
inguinal lymphadenopathy. Through the process
of autoinoculation, skin lesions may occur.
Infection with H. ducreyi will not confer immu-
nity, but hypersensitivity reactions occur upon
inoculation of dead bacilli. Gram-stain smears
from the ulcerative lesions show pleomorphic,
Gram-negative bacilli but may appear Gram-
positive with frequent bipolar staining. Usually,
these bacilli arrange themselves in small groups
or whorls or parallel lines (railway track or school
of ﬁsh appearance). Sulphonamide and tetracy-
cline are the drugs of choice, but cotrimoxazole,
erythromycin, ciproﬂoxacin or ceftriaxone may
be used as alternative options.
Haemophilus aphrophilus
H. aphrophilus is present as a commensal in the
mouth and the throat. It forms yellowish, high
convex, large colonies (1.5-mm diameter) on
chocolate agar after 24 h of incubation. It requires
only X factor, but not V factor, and as the name
suggests, it also requires a high concentration of
CO2 for growth. H. aphrophilus, which is present
as a commensal in the mouth, can spread to the
bloodstream and infect the previously infected
heart valve, causing sub-acute endocarditis. It
can also cause brain abscess, pneumonia and
sinusitis.
Haemophilus parainfluenzae
H. parainﬂuenzae is an opportunistic pathogen in
the upper respiratory tract. Occasionally, the bac-
teria may cause endocarditis, conjunctivitis and
bronchopulmonary infection. It forms relatively
bigger colonies than those of H. inﬂuenzae on
chocolate agar, which are opaque and yellowish-
white. It differs from H. inﬂuenzae in requiring
the V factor only and not the X factor, fermenting
sucrose but not d-xylose.
Haemophilus aegyptius
H. aegyptius was earlier known as Koch–Weeks’s
bacillus. Koch observed this in 1883 in a case of
acute conjunctivitis and subsequently was ﬁrst

cultured by Weeks in 1887. Recent DNA-based
studies revealed that H. aegyptius is similar to
non-capsulated H. inﬂuenzae; hence, now it is
renamed H. inﬂuenzae biotype aegyptius, and
they are categorised as H. inﬂuenza biotype III.
This organism is cosmopolitan in distribution and
causes a highly contagious form of acute conjunc-
tivitis (pink eye). It is prevalent in tropical and
subtropical regions; at times, its infection results
in epidemics.

with a very high fatality rate. The BPF was ﬁrst
recorded in Brazil in 1984. Since then, it has
become an endemic disease in the whole of
South America.
Haemophilus haemolyticus
H. haemolyticus is present as a commensal in the
upper respiratory tract. It is a non-pathogen and
does not cause any human disease. On blood agar,
it produces a zone of haemolysis around the
colonies and may be mistaken for haemolytic
streptococci. It requires both X and V factors.
Actinobacillus (Aggregatibacter)
Actinobacillus are small, non-motile and faculta-
tive anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli. The bacte-
ria grow slowly on culture media requiring
2–3 days of incubation. Actinobacillus are present
in the oropharynx of humans and animals and
cause
various
infections.
The
genus
Actinobacillus consists of at least six species,
and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is
the most important human pathogen. Other spe-
cies

(H.

H.
aphrophilus
and
H.
paraphrophilus),
A.
actinomycetemcomitans,
Cardiobacterium
hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella spe-
cies. These organisms are normally present in the
oropharynx, which can cause severe infections,
such as endocarditis, under certain conditions.
Since they are fastidious organisms to grow,
they are usually incriminated as a frequent cause
of culture-negative endocarditis. These organisms
also cause various diseases, including otitis
media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis,
osteomyelitis, urinary tract infections, wound
infections, brain abscess, periodontal infections,
etc. Infective endocarditis is a major clinical con-
dition caused by the HACEK group of organisms.
Laboratory diagnosis of infective endocarditis
depends on blood culture, followed by subculture
on blood agar and chocolate agar supplemented
with vitamins and other nutrients. The media are
incubated in a humid atmosphere of 5% carbon
dioxide or anaerobically for 24–72 h. Blood cul-
ture bottles are incubated for a minimum of
14 days, followed by a terminal subculture before
declaring it negative. Antibiotics are the mainstay
of treatment. Due to delays in blood culture,
antibiotics
are
usually
started
empirically.

Case Study
A 2-year-old child was brought to paediatric OPD
with a history of fever, headache, convulsions and
vomiting. Physical examination showed the pres-
ence of neck rigidity and pus in the external
auditory canal. Further enquiry revealed that the
child had a bout of upper respiratory tract infec-
tion in the previous week. A provisional diagno-
sis of bacterial meningitis was made. CSF protein
was raised, but glucose was decreased. CSF was
sent for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity and
biochemical analysis. Gram stain revealed the
presence of pus cells and pleomorphic Gram-
negative coccobacilli. H. inﬂuenzae was isolated
by culture.

Genus Bordetella
Genus Bordetella includes the bacteria that are
extremely
small,
strictly
aerobic,
non-fermentative
and
Gram-negative
coccobacilli. The genus Bordetella consists of
15 recognised species, of which three are respon-
sible for human diseases (Table 40.5).
Bordetella pertussis
B. pertussis (pertussis, Latin for intense cough) is
the causative agent of whooping cough, an infec-
tious bacterial illness that affects the respiratory
tract. Whooping cough is one of many diseases
that a vaccine can prevent.

are
extremely
small
ovoid
coccobacilli measuring 0.2–0.5  1 μm. Charac-
teristically, they demonstrate pleomorphism in
their
morphology.
They
are
Gram-negative
occurring in singles or pairs and are non-motile.
Toluidine
blue
staining
of
the
bacteria
demonstrates characteristic bipolar metachro-
matic granules. The freshly isolated strain of
B. pertussis possesses a poorly deﬁned capsule
and ﬁmbriae. In culture smears, the bacilli are
arranged in loose clumps with clear spaces in
between, giving a thumbprint appearance.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
B. pertussis is a strict aerobe with an optimum
temperature for growth at 35 C. The bacteria are
nutritionally fastidious. They do not grow on
common laboratory media, such as blood agar
and nutrient agar. Even on blood agar, the bacte-
ria grow slowly and require 3–6 days to form
pinpoint
colonies.
The
bacteria
are
usually
grown on a rich medium supplemented with char-
coal, starch, blood, albumin and growth factors,
such as nicotinamide. The latter is essential for
the growth of bacteria. Blood or albumin present
in the medium is used not to provide nutrition for
the growth of bacteria but to neutralise toxic
substances, such as fatty acids present in the agar.
Bordet–Gengou agar with 15–20% of blood
is a common medium used for primary isolation
of B. pertussis. This medium consists of glycerol,
potato, agar and 15–20% blood. After 48–72 h of
incubation, B. pertussis produces small, smooth,
opaque, greyish white refractile colonies resem-
bling bisected pearls or mercury drops (Fig. 40.4).
A hazy zone of haemolysis is present around the
colonies. Conﬂuent growth of B. pertussis on the
medium typically presents an aluminium paint
appearance. Charcoal agar with 10% blood
has also been used for primary isolation of
B. pertussis. The bacterium does not grow on
MacConkey medium, but other Bordetella spe-
cies grow.
B. pertussis is oxidase positive and catalase
positive but biochemically inert. The bacteria do
not ferment carbohydrates. The bacteria also do
not produce indole, do not reduce nitrate, do not
split urea and do not utilise citrate.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
B. pertussis is killed by heating at 55 C for
30 min. It is also killed by drying and also by
standard disinfectants. If left on culture plates, the
bacteria die within a few days, but they can sur-
vive in dry droplets for up to 5 days and 3 days on
cloth.
Bordetella pertussis Antigens
B. pertussis possesses two types of antigens.
These are genus-speciﬁc somatic O antigen and
strain-speciﬁc capsular K antigen. The O antigen
is a protein in nature, heat stable and is of a single
antigenic type. It is present in most of the strains
of Bordetella. The K antigen is heat-labile. These
K antigens are of different types and are used for
differentiating B. pertussis isolates in epidemio-
logical studies.
A
total
of
14
agglutinating
factors
or
agglutinogens have been identiﬁed. B. pertussis
strains are classiﬁed into various types based on
agglutinogens on their capsule. Factor 7 is found
in all strains of B. pertussis (1–7, 13), Bordetella
parapertussis
(7–10,
14)
and
Bordetella
bronchiseptica (7–13).

Pathogenesis
B. pertussis colonises the cilia of the mammalian
respiratory epithelium. The organism usually
does not invade the tissues but cause disease
primarily by toxins.
Virulence Factors
B. pertussis produces several virulence factors
(Table 40.6). These include (1) ﬁlamentous
haemagglutinin
(FHA),
(2)
pertussis
toxin,
(3) invasive adenylate cyclase, (4) lethal toxin
and (5) tracheal cytotoxin.
FHA
This is the most important virulence factor, which
mediates the attachment of B. pertussis to the
ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. It
is a large protein (220 kDa) that forms ﬁlamen-
tous structures on the cell surface when seen
under an electron microscope hence named
FHA. FHA binds to galactose residues on a
sulphated glycolipid called sulfatide, present on
the surface of the ciliated cells. This adhesin also
binds to CR3, a receptor present on the surface of
polymorphonuclear leucocytes. FHA and pertus-
sis toxin haemagglutinins of B. pertussis are also
responsible for secondary infections. In contrast,
H. inﬂuenzae and S. pneumoniae adhere to these
substances, which facilitates the binding of these
bacteria to the respiratory epithelium. This phe-
nomenon, therefore, is called piracy of adhesins.
The intracellular survival of the B. pertussis
inside the leucocyte protects the bacterium from
humoral antibodies against FHA. Mutations in
the FHA structural gene reduce the ability of
B. pertussis to colonise. Recently, the structural
gene for FHA has been cloned, thereby raising the
possibility of the production for use in a vaccine.
Pertussis Toxin
It is a major virulent factor in the initial
colonisation of the bacteria in the tracheal epithe-
lium. Pertussis toxin is a 105 kDa protein; it is

secreted into the extracellular ﬂuid and bound to
the cell wall. Pertussis toxin, typically composed
of two major units, A and B, consists of six
subunits S1, S2, S3, S5 and two S4 subunits.
Unit A is an enzymatically active moiety and
consists of one toxic subunit, S1. Unit B is
responsible for binding the toxin to epithelial
cells and consists of ﬁve binding subunits (S2,
S3, S5 and two S4 subunits). The S2 subunit of
the B unit binds to a glycolipid present on the
ciliated epithelium. The S3 subunit of the B unit
binds to the ganglioside receptor on the surface of
phagocytic cells. Following the binding of the B
subunit to the epithelial cells, A subunit inserts
through the membrane and is released into the
cytoplasm. By its enzymatic activity, the A sub-
unit transfers the ADP ribosyl moiety of the NAD
to the membrane-bound regulated protein G1,
which normally inhibits the eukaryotic adenyl
cyclase. The gene for pertussis toxin has been
cloned and sequenced. The toxin is toxoided for
use in the component vaccines.

Invasive Adenylate Cyclase or Haemolysin
This is a 45 kDa protein bound to a cell or
released into the medium. This toxin is produced
by all three Bordetella species causing human
infections. The adenylate cyclase was originally
identiﬁed as haemolysin because it causes lysis of
blood cells. This enzyme is responsible for
producing
a
zone
of
haemolysis
around
B. pertussis colonies on blood agar.
Tracheal Cytotoxin
Tracheal cytotoxin is not a classical exotoxin
because it is not composed of protein but is com-
posed of a low-molecular-weight peptidoglycan
fragment that kills ciliated respiratory cells. It also
stimulates the release of cytokine IL-1 and is
responsible for fever. A tracheal cytotoxin is
toxic for ciliated respiratory epithelium and is
responsible for inhibiting ciliary movement. The
toxin speciﬁcally interferes with DNA synthesis,
thereby preventing the regeneration of damaged
cells.
In
addition
to
these
virulent
factors,
B. pertussis toxins produce adhesins, enzymes
and toxins, whose role in the pathogenesis of
whooping cough remains unclear. For example,
the bacteria possess lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
their cell wall, which is unusual. It is heteroge-
neous with two distinct types of LPSs, lipid A and
lipid X. Both lipid A and lipid X can activate the
alternative complement pathway and stimulate
the release of cytokines. The role of this unusual
LPS in the pathogenesis of whooping cough is
unknown. The lethal toxin is a heat-labile pro-
tein. It is a 102 kDa protein composed of four
subunits: two with a molecular weight of 24 kDa.
The lethal toxin causes inﬂammation and lethal
necrosis around the adherence site of B. pertussis.

The toxin is lethal in high doses in experimental
infection of mice. The role of the toxin in the
disease is unknown. Similarly, B. pertussis
produces at least two other types of adhesins
and pertactin, but their role in adherence and
pathogenesis remains unclear. Pertactin is present
as an outer membrane protein (OMP) in all viru-
lent strains. Antibodies against pertactin can be
seen in infected or immunised children.

Pathogenesis of Whooping Cough
B. pertussis causes pertussis or whooping cough
in two stages. The ﬁrst stage of colonisation is
characterised by the multiplication of bacteria and
the production of localised tissue damage. Infec-
tion with B. pertussis is initiated by the attach-
ment of the bacteria to ciliated epithelial cells of
the respiratory tract. The attachment is mediated
primarily by two bacterial adhesions, FHA and
pertussis toxin. The second stage of toxaemia is
characterised by the manifestation of systemic
toxicity produced by many toxins. The bacteria
multiply at the site of infection, where they pro-
duce several toxins that paralyse the tiny cilia and
cause
inﬂammation
of
the
respiratory
tract
(Fig. 40.5). Subsequently, many other toxins pro-
duced by B. pertussis also contribute to the path-
ogenesis of the disease. Adenylate cyclase toxin
also inhibits leucocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis
and killing of the bacteria.
Clinical Syndromes
B. pertussis causes whooping cough, the most
common
vaccine-preventable
disease
among
children.
Whooping Cough
Whooping cough is also known as pertussis. The
incubation period varies from 7 to 10 days. The
disease typically has three stages (Fig. 40.6):
catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage and convales-
cent stage.
The catarrhal stage is the ﬁrst stage of
whooping cough. This stage resembles an upper
respiratory tract infection with a running nose,
nasal congestion, sneezing, malaise and occa-
sional cough. A low-grade fever may also be
seen. This phase typically lasts 1–2 weeks. This

10
stage is highly infectious because of the produc-
tion of many bacteria during this stage of the
disease.

Catarrhal

Paroxysmal
phase
The paroxysmal stage is the second stage of
the disease. This stage is characterised by classic
whooping cough or paroxysms. Each paroxysm
consists of a series of repetitive, intense, and
drawn out bouts of cough followed by an inspira-
tory whoop. The attack is more frequent at night,
with an average of 15 attacks in 24 h. The parox-
ysm may frequently end with vomiting and
exhaustion. During this stage, mucus production
in the respiratory tract is more frequent and par-
tially responsible for obstructing the respiratory
tract. Duration of this stage is highly variable,
lasting within 1–6 weeks up to 10 weeks.
The convalescent stage is the third stage of
the disease, which may last for weeks or months.
It is characterised by a chronic cough that
becomes less paroxysmal. Many complications
mark this stage. These include subconjunctival
haemorrhage, respiratory distress, secondary bac-
terial pneumonia and neurological complications,
such
as
convulsions.
These
neurological
complications may result in permanent sequelae,
such
as
epilepsy,
paralysis,
blindness
and
deafness.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Nasopharyngeal aspirates are the specimen of
choice. These samples should be collected during
the ﬁrst stage or early in the second stage of
disease because the organisms are most abundant
in the respiratory secretions during these stages.
Also, the specimen for culture should be collected
before administering antibiotics. The specimens
are usually collected using either calcium alginate
or Dacron swabs but not by cotton swabs because
certain fatty acids inhibit the growth of bacteria in
the cotton, which are toxic to B. pertussis.
The specimens for culture are collected by
swabs or by coughing on a culture medium. The
specimen is collected by the per-nasal or naso-
pharyngeal swab method. In this method, a ster-
ile swab on a ﬂexible wire is passed gently along
the ﬂoor of the nasal cavity, and the mucus and
pus are collected by the swab. West post-nasal
or oral swab is usually employed to collect pos-
terior pharyngeal wall secretions through the oral
cavity. Contamination with saliva should be
avoided for better results. The swab containing
the mucus and pus is inoculated immediately on
freshly
prepared
medium,
such
as
Bordet–
Gengou or charcoal horse blood agar at the
patient’s bedside. In case of delay, they are
transported in 0.2–0.5 mL casamino acid solution
(pH 7.2), modiﬁed Stuart transport medium or
Regan–Lowe transport medium.
In the Cough plate method, specimens are
directly coughed out by the patient on a culture
medium during a bout of spontaneous or induced
coughing by an infected child. The culture plate is
held 10–15 cm before the patient’s mouth. During
the process of coughing by children, infected

nasopharyngeal secretions are directly deposited
on the medium.
594
40
Haemophilus and Bordetella
Microscopy
Microscopic diagnosis is made by Gram staining
or a direct ﬂuorescent antibody of respiratory
secretions. In the direct ﬂuorescent antibody
method, a smear is made from a specimen on a
glass slide, air-dried and heat-ﬁxed. This smear is
then stained with a ﬂuorescent labelled antibody
against B. pertussis. It is a rapid and sensitive
method. This method is positive in more than
75% of cases of whooping cough. This technique,
however, may show occasional false-positive
reactions due to other bacterial infections.
Culture and Identification
The specimens are cultured on freshly prepared
Bordet–Gengou medium or charcoal horse blood
agar medium and incubated in a moist environ-
ment at 35 C. Incubation even up to 7 days is
required because the colonies are observed only
after three or more days of incubation.
Several
characters
identify
B.
pertussis
colonies. They show bisected pearl or mercury
drop colonies on Bordet–Gengou agar. They are
small, round Gram-negative coccobacilli and are
catalase and oxidase positive. They are biochem-
ically inert do not ferment carbohydrates.
Serology
Indirect haemagglutination and ELISA are fre-
quently used to demonstrate IgG and IgA
antibodies against FHA and IgG antibodies
against pertussis toxin in the patient’s sera.
Serodiagnosis is only recommended for patients
with symptoms compatible with pertussis, such as
prolonged
coughing
with
paroxysms
and/or
whooping or choking. ELISA for demonstrating
speciﬁc secretory IgA antibodies in nasopharyn-
geal secretions is also useful, especially in
culture-negative
cases.
Commercial
kits
or
in-house validated protocols are used for the
purposes. A signiﬁcant rise in the titre of
antibodies
between
acute
and
convalescent
serum in paired sera samples by these tests
suggests recent infection.
In clinical practice, diagnosis is mostly based
on a single sample by using a cut-off value be in
the range between 60 IU/ml and 75 IU/ml. How-
ever, it is not meaningful in neonates and young
infants and is reported to have diagnostic value in
older children, adolescents and adults only.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new diag-
nostic method used to diagnose whooping cough.
It shows a high sensitivity of 80–100% and
produces timely results. Aspiration or swabbing
the posterior nasopharynx is used to collect
samples for PCR, wherein throat swabs and ante-
rior nasal swabs are not used due to the lower
quantity
of
DNA
recovery.
PCR
tests
are
recommended for adolescents and adults with
coughing less than 3 weeks. After the fourth
week, bacterial DNA rapidly diminishes, increas-
ing the chances of false-negative results.
Both conventional and real-time PCR are used
for diagnosis. However, the latter took the com-
mercial interests for being more affordable and
less
labour
intensive.
Several
commercial
RT-PCR kits are available that targets virulence
and structural genes like IS481, IS1001, IS1002,
ptxS1, ptx-pr, RecA, Plp1 and Plp2 etc.
Other Laboratory Tests
There is a marked leucocytosis and relative lym-
phocytosis in pertussis. The total leucocyte count
usually ranges from 20,000 to 30,000 mm3
along with increased lymphocytes. There is no
increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate except
during secondary infection.
Treatment
Macrolides like erythromycin, clarithromycin and
azithromycin are the drug of choice for treating
pertussis in persons 1 month of age and older.
Tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ampicillin are
also effective. These antibiotics effectively eradi-
cate the bacteria from the respiratory tract and
reduce the duration of infectivity of the patients.
However, the treatment protocol of pertussis is
primarily supported by good nursing care.

Bordetella parapertussis
595
Epidemiology
Whooping cough is predominantly a disease of
childhood.
Geographical Distribution
Despite the vaccines and widespread global vac-
cination, B. pertussis has remained an endemic
disease and sometimes leads to outbreaks and
death. WHO estimated more than 151,000 cases
of pertussis globally in 2018? Many recent stud-
ies have indicated a resurgence of the disease in
many countries irrespective of economic status.
Habitat
B. pertussis colonises the cilia of the mammalian
respiratory epithelium of infected children.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Whooping cough is highly contagious. Humans
are the only known reservoir of B. pertussis infec-
tion. An infected child, particularly during the
catarrhal stage of disease, is the important source
of infection. The infection is transmitted primarily
by inhaling airborne droplets coughed out by the
infected patients. The infection is also transmitted
by
contact
with
hard
surfaces
recently
contaminated
with
respiratory
secretions
or
droplets from an infected child. Secondary attack
rates
are
the
highest
(75–100%)
among
unimmunised household contacts. In pseudo-
whooping cough, the clinical manifestations mim-
icking whooping cough may also be seen in respi-
ratory infections caused by other pathogens such
as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus.
Initially, whooping cough was considered a
disease of young children (<5 years), but now
this disease is also seen in older children and
adults. They contribute to 25% of cases of
whooping cough. This is due to failing immunity
over time in adults, even in vaccinated.
Prevention and Control
An attack of whooping cough gives lifelong
immunity to a child. The secondary attack is
extremely rare. Speciﬁc serum antibodies confer
immunity against B. pertussis. Vaccination of
infants and children with pertussis vaccine is
very effective. The vaccination is usually given
to children below 7 years of age.
Vaccines
Whole-cell inactivated vaccine has been used
for the past ﬁve or more decades to protect chil-
dren against whooping cough. This vaccine is a
Merthiolate-killed
bacterial
cell
suspension,
administered as part of DTP (diphtheria, tetanus
and pertussis) or triple vaccine. These vaccines
are effective in 80–85% of the population in
eliminating
asymptomatic
pertussis.
These
vaccines are given in three doses intramuscularly
at an interval of 4–6 weeks before 6 months of
age. A booster follows this at the end of the ﬁrst
year. The ﬁrst dose is given at 6 weeks. Unfortu-
nately, more than 20% of children who receive
whole-cell vaccines suffer from mild side effects.
Convulsions occur on 0.1% of infants soon after
receiving the vaccine.
Acellular vaccines have been developed from
puriﬁed components of B. pertussis. The multi-
component vaccine contains FHA, pertussis
toxin, ﬁbrin agglutinin and pertactin. These
components are believed to confer protective
immunity against whooping cough. This new
acellular pertussis vaccine has been found to con-
fer protective immunity similar to that of the
whole-cell vaccine. However, the most important
advantage is that these vaccines have very low
side effects than whole-cell vaccines.
Bordetella parapertussis
B. parapertussis is a less frequent cause of
whooping cough, with only about 5% of cases
of whooping cough. They relatively cause mild
disease. B. parapertussis organisms differ from
B. pertussis by their ability to grow on nutrient
agar and to produce larger colonies, but the for-
mer do not produce pigment (Table 40.7). They
are
antigenically
different
from
those
of
B. pertussis. Pertussis vaccine does not confer
any protection against B. parapertussis.

Bordetella bronchiseptica
B. bronchiseptica is a motile bacterium by virtue
of the presence of peristriate ﬂagella. The bacteria
grow on nutrient agar and are antigenically
related to B. pertussis and Brucella abortus. I
differs from other Bordetella species in its bio-
chemical and other properties (Table 40.7).
B. bronchiseptica is responsible for causing a
very

(0.1%)
of
cases
of
whooping cough.
Case Study
A 3-year-old child was brought to paediatric OPD
with a history of continuous dry cough for the
past 15 days. On examination, episodes of con-
tinuous violent coughing and a typical ‘whoop’
were found. Peripheral blood smear showed
leucocytosis. Chest X-ray was normal. Gram
stain showed the presence of oral commensals.
Ziehl–Neelsen stain from gastric aspirate was
negative for acid-fast bacteria.

Brucella
41
In 1886, British army doctor David Bruce experi-
mentally infected the monkeys by inoculating
small microorganisms isolated frosm the spleen
of Malta fever case. He was able to see similar
disease manifestations in the monkeys also.
Hence,
this
organism
was
named
Brucella
melitensis, Brucella after Bruce and melitensis
after Malta (Roman name Melita). Further, in
1905, Zammit elucidated the transmission of
B.
melitensis
to
humans
by
consuming
contaminated goat milk. Similarly, other major
species of Brucella were identiﬁed by Bang in
1897 (Brucella abortus causes contagious abor-
tion in cattle) and Traum in 1914 (Brucella suis
isolated from pigs in the United States). All these
three
species
are
known
to
cause
human
infections.
Genus Brucella
The genus consists of 25 recognised species, four
of which are human pathogens. These are
B. abortus, B. melitensis, Brucella canis and
B. suis (Table 41.1). Human infections with Bru-
cella neotomae and Brucella ovis have not been
described. Moreover, each Brucella species has a
characteristic predilection for infecting certain
animal species where it causes a chronic disease
that persists for life.
Brucellosis is one of the most important world-
wide zoonoses affecting livestock and humans.
Considering the potential to pose a severe threat
to both human and animal health, three strains of
Brucella, i.e. B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis,
have been categorised as select agents by HHS
and USDA of the USA.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Brucellae are Gram-negative but counterstain
poorly and require relatively more time for
staining. They are small coccobacilli measuring
0.5–0.7  0.6–1.5 μm in size. These are arranged
singly, sometimes in pairs or short chains. They
do not produce spores, ﬂagella or capsule.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Brucellae are strict aerobes. Most biovars of
B. abortus require 5–10% CO2 for their growth.
No growth occurs in aerobic conditions. They
grow at an optimum temperature of 37 C and
pH range of 6.6–7.4. Brucellae can grow on sim-
ple media, but their growth is slow and scanty.
Growth is improved by adding serum, blood, liver
extract and glucose. Brucella organisms grow
best on trypticase soy-based or other enriched
media. Blood agar and trypticase soy agar are
the media of choice. Tryptose agar, trypticase
soy agar, serum potato infusion agar and
serum dextrose agar are the other media used
for Brucellae culture. The addition of bacitracin,
polymyxin and cycloheximide to these media
makes them selective. On these solid media,

n
Brucella spp. produce small, moist, translucent
and glistening colonies after three or more days
of incubation. In liquid media, growth is uniform.

Brucellae are catalase and oxidase positive
(except for B. ovis and B. neotomae, which are
oxidase negative). They reduce nitrate to nitrite
and
have
variable
urease
activity—B.
suis
becomes urease positive within 30 min, whereas
B. abortus becomes positive within 1–2 h. Some
Brucella species produce H2S, whereas some spe-
cies do not produce H2S. They do not ordinarily
ferment any sugar. They do not produce indole
and are MR and VP test negative. Brucella does
not utilise citrate.
Classification
The genus Brucella is considered monospeciﬁc
based on gene sequencing and nucleic acid
homology. However, the traditional classiﬁcation
based on the natural hosts and differences in
pathogenicity is used in practice. Brucella species
show
a
high
degree
of
host
speciﬁcity.
B. melitensis infects goats and sheep; B. abortus,
cattle; B. suis, swines and B. canis, dogs and
foxes.
Brucella species and biovars are differentiated
by the following characteristics (Table 41.2):
(1) growth in the presence of aniline dyes, such
as basic fuchsin dyes or thionine; (2) requirement
for CO2; (3) ability to use glutamic acid, orni-
thine, lysine and ribose; (4) ability to produce
H2S; (5) agglutination by antisera against speciﬁc
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and vi) susceptibility to
lysis by bacteriophage.
Biotypes
B.
abortus
consists
of
seven
biotypes:
B. melitensis three biotypes and B. suis ﬁve
biotypes. H2S-producing B. suis strains are
American strains, and those not producing H2S
are Danish strains.
Phage Types
Tbilisi (Tb) is the reference phage used for phage
typing of Brucella species. This phage lyses
B. abortus both at routine test dilution (RTD)
and at 10,000 RTD. The phage lyses B. suis at
10,000 RTD only but does not lyse any strain of
B. melitensis.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
The brucellae are rapidly killed at 60
C i
10 min; hence they are killed by pasteurisation
in the milk. They are also killed by disinfectants,
such as 1% phenol in 15 min. They are sensitive
to direct sunlight and acid. The bacteria survive
for 10 days in refrigerated milk, for 1 month in ice
cream and 4 months in butter. B. melitensis
remains viable in urine for 6 days, dust for
6 weeks and water or soil for 10 weeks.
Brucella Antigen Structure
Based on these O polysaccharide linkages,
somatic antigens of Brucella are classiﬁed into
two major types: antigen A and antigen M.
B. abortus has the highest concentration of A
antigen (about 20 times as much as M antigen),
whereas B. melitensis has the highest concentra-
tion of M antigen (about 20 times that of A
antigen). B. suis has an intermediate antigenic
pattern. Brucella species show antigenic cross-
reaction

Pathogenesis
Brucella species have a predilection for intracel-
lular growth, hence may be demonstrated inside
phagocytes. The intracellular location of the Bru-
cella explains the relative resistance of the bacte-
rium to chemotherapy.
Virulence Factors
LPS of Brucella is the principal virulence factor
of Brucella spp. The LPS is unique in that the
lipid A part of the LPS contains 16-carbon long
fatty acids but lacks the 14-carbon myristic acid
typical of lipid A of Enterobacteriaceae. The
polysaccharide O portion of LPS contains an
unusual sugar, 4,6-dideoxy-4-formamido-alpha-
D-mannopyranoside, which is expressed either
as
a
homopolymer
alpha-1,2-linked
sugar
(A-type) or as 3-alpha-1,2- and 2-alpha-1,3-
linked sugar (M type). The intracellular location
of the bacteria makes them resistant to killing in
serum and also by phagocytes. B. melitensis is the
most virulent species, as it can survive in phago-
cytic cells and multiply in them, producing a large
number of bacteria. It causes the most severe and
acute cases of brucellosis.
Pathogenesis of Brucellosis
Brucellae enter through abrasion or cut in the
skin, conjunctiva, respiratory tract and gastroin-
testinal tract. Shortly after gaining entry to the
body,
brucellae
are
rapidly
ingested
by

polymorphonuclear
leukocytes,
which
are
attracted to the site of inﬂammation. However,
inside the leukocytes, the brucellae are not killed
due to the presence of enzyme superoxide
dismutase,
O
polysaccharide
of
LPS
and
nucleotide-like substances produced by the bac-
teria. Brucellae that are not killed by leukocytes
spread from the site of infection to the local
lymph nodes, which drain the site of infection.
Inside the lymph glands, the bacteria multiply and
are released into the bloodstream following the
rupture of the cells and are phagocytosed by the
macrophages.

Bacteria present in the macrophages are then
carried to the organs of the reticuloendothelial
system, such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow,
lymph nodes and kidney. In these organs,
brucellae
multiply
in
phagosomes
of
macrophages by producing adenine and guanine
monophosphate.
These
compounds
inhibit
phagolysosome fusion, oxidative burst activity
and tumour necrosis factor production. Apart
from the organs of the reticuloendothelial system,
any other organ system such as the central ner-
vous system (CNS), heart, joints, genitourinary
system, pulmonary system, and skin can also be
affected by brucellosis.
Immunity in brucellosis, like other obligate
intracellular
pathogens,
is
primarily
cell-
mediated. Activated macrophages are primarily
responsible for killing the bacteria by producing
interferon-gamma and other cytokines. It is
suggested
that
antibody,
complement
and
macrophage-activating cytokines also play a sup-
portive role in controlling the multiplication of
extracellular
bacteria
or
in
early
infection.
Humoral immunity is characterised by the pro-
duction of antibodies against the LPS of the bac-
teria. However, even in the presence of opsonic
activity, these serum antibodies against LPS do
not provide any protective immunity against
bacteria.
Clinical Syndromes
Brucellosis is a systemic disease in humans that
can involve almost any organ system. The condi-
tion is known by various names, such as Malta
fever, Mediterranean fever, undulant fever, etc.

Genus Brucella
601
Brucellosis
The incubation period may range from 3 days to
several weeks. Human infections may be of three
types, as follows:
Acute Brucellosis
The condition is seen in approximately 50% of
patients. Fever is an important symptom. The
fever is intermittent and undulant (hence known
as undulant fever) and can be associated with
relative bradycardia. In untreated patients with
the adverse disease, the patients can show respi-
ratory tract symptoms (20%), bone and joint
symptoms (20–60%), neuropsychiatric symptoms
and gastrointestinal tract symptoms.
Chronic Brucellosis
The condition develops in incompletely treated
patients. This condition is associated with a
low-grade non-bacteraemia infection with peri-
odic exacerbations. Symptoms often last for 3–-
6 months and occasionally for a year or more.
Localised and Suppurative Infection
These infections are more likely caused by
B. suis.
Complications include infections of the heart,
CNS and the skin. Brucella endocarditis is the
most dangerous complication and is responsible
for 80% of deaths in brucellosis. Chronic menin-
goencephalitis is the usual manifestation of CNS
infection.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis of brucellosis is very difﬁcult
due to the protean manifestation of the disease.
Hence, laboratory diagnosis plays an important
role in conﬁrming the diagnosis of brucellosis.
Specimens
Blood is the specimen of choice and is collected
for culture and the serological test. Bone marrow
and sometimes synovial ﬂuid and pleural ﬂuid are
also collected for culture. Specimens such as liver
and lymph nodes can also be cultured to isolate
Brucella organisms. Rarely, the bacteria can be
isolated from cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), urine,
sputum, breast milk, vaginal discharge and semi-
nal ﬂuid.
Microscopy
Gram staining is not useful for demonstrating
Brucella organisms in clinical specimens due to
their small size and intracellular location.
Culture and Identification
Isolation of Brucella from blood and other clini-
cal specimens is the deﬁnitive diagnostic proce-
dure in brucellosis. Approximately 5–10 mL of
blood is collected in the 200 mL serum dextrose
broth or trypticase soy broth and incubated at
37 C under 5–10% of CO2. After the fourth
day of incubation, subcultures are made on solid
media every 3–5 days for 8 weeks before declar-
ing the culture negative.
Castaneda’s Method of Blood Culture
This is a useful method to culture blood without
the need for frequent subculture on a solid
medium; hence, the possibility of contamination
can be avoided. This biphasic medium contains
both trypticase soy broth and solid trypticase soy
agar slant in the same bottle (Fig. 41.1). The
blood is inoculated onto the liquid broth, and the
bottle is incubated in the upright position. For
subculture, one does not have to open the bottle;
instead, it is tilted such that liquid broth ﬂows
over the solid medium slant. It is again incubated
in the upright position. In the case of positive
blood culture, colonies appear on the slant. The
Castaneda method of blood culture also reduces
the risk of laboratory-acquired infection to both
medical and paramedical staff. The sensitivity of
blood
cultures
ranges
from
30%
to
50%,
depending on the Brucella species isolated.
B. melitensis and B. suis are more likely to have
detectable bacteraemia and hence are readily
cultured than B. abortus.
Bone Marrow Cultures
These are more sensitive than blood cultures.
They typically are positive in the negative blood
culture and serological results. Synovial ﬂuid
culture is positive in 50% of patients.

Identiﬁcation
of

colonies is made by microscopy of Gram-stained
smears of the colonies (small, Gram-negative
coccobacilli), colony morphology (growth in the
presence of aniline dyes, such as basic fuchsin
dyes or thionine, produce small, moist, translu-
cent and glistening colonies after three or more
days), biochemical tests (ability to use glutamic
acid, ornithine, lysine and ribose and to produce
H2S), agglutinate with speciﬁc anti-brucella sera
and are susceptible to lysis by bacteriophage.
Serology
Serological tests are useful for diagnosing sub-
clinical brucellosis and for acute and chronic
brucellosis
cases
by
demonstrating
speciﬁc
antibodies in the patient’s serum. Speciﬁc bru-
cella antibodies, both IgG and IgM antibodies,
appear in the serum 7–10 days after infection.
IgM antibodies persist for up to 3 months, after
which these antibodies decline. Then IgG and
IgA antibodies appear after 3 weeks of infection
and persist for a longer time. Hence, in the acute
stage or subclinical brucellosis, both IgG and IgM
can be demonstrated; in chronic brucellosis, only
IgG can be demonstrated, as IgM is absent. As
IgG antibodies persist for many months or years,
demonstrating a signiﬁcant rise in the antibody
titre is the deﬁnitive serological evidence of bru-
cellosis. A fourfold increase in the titre or a single
high antibody titre of 1:160 is the presumptive
evidence of Brucella infection.
B. abortus is used as an antigen in brucella
agglutination tests because the antibodies against
B. melitensis or B. suis can cross-react with
B. abortus antigen. B. abortus antigen not only
detects
speciﬁc
antibodies
against
its
own
antigens but also detects antibodies produced
against B. melitensis and B. suis.
Several serological tests have been developed
and tested in the serodiagnosis of brucellosis.
These are as follows:
The Standard Tube Agglutination Test (SAT)
The test remains the standard method and is the
most
commonly
used
serological
test
for
diagnosing brucellosis. It detects the presence of
antibodies against the LPS component of Bru-
cella. The test uses killed strains of B. abortus
as antigens and is useful for diagnosing brucello-
sis caused by B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis.
This test is not useful for the infection caused by
B. canis because this bacterium does not have O
polysaccharide on its surface; hence it does not
produce antibodies against LPS.
The SAT is considered positive when anti-
body titres are greater than or equal to 1 in 160 or
when a fourfold rise titre is demonstrated in con-
valescent sera. A rise in titre is especially impor-
tant in patients from an endemic area in which
titres of 1 in 160 are not unusual in asymptomatic
persons.

Genus Brucella
603
Nevertheless,
the
SAT may show
false-
negative or false-positive results. False-negative
SAT is due to the prozone phenomenon. This
occurs due to the high level of brucella antibodies
in the serum, caused by hyperantigenemia. The
prozone phenomenon gives rise to a false-
negative test. This can be avoided by routine
dilution of serum to at least 1:320 because inhibi-
tion of agglutination may occur at low dilution.
False-positive SAT is due to blocking or
non-agglutinating antibodies in the serum. This
can be avoided by heating the serum at 55 C for
30 min or by using 4% saline or diluent before
testing the serum. These blocking antibodies can
be diluted by adding antihuman globulin to the
antigen serum mixture (Coombs test). False-
positive is also due to cross-reactivity with
V. cholerae, Y. enterocolitica serotype O9,
F. tularensis and Salmonella species can cause
false-positive results due to the presence of cross-
reacting LPS in these organisms.
V.
cholerae-induced
antibodies
may
be
removed by 2-mercaptoethanol absorption. In
the
modiﬁed
tube
agglutination
test,
2-mercaptoethanol is added to the patient’s sera
before testing it. The addition of mercaptoethanol
disrupts the disulphide bond of IgM; hence only
IgG is detected. This modiﬁed tube agglutination
test is useful for speciﬁc detection of IgG
antibodies, and titres higher than 1:80 are sugges-
tive of active infection. A high IgG antibody titre
or a titre that is higher after treatment suggests
relapse or persistent infection. This test is useful
for
the
diagnosis
of
brucellosis
during
convalescence.
Indirect Immunofluorescent Assay
The test is a sensitive method for detecting bru-
cella antibodies in the serum, which may be posi-
tive even in agglutination-test-negative cases.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA)
The test is the most sensitive test for detecting
IgM, IgA and IgG brucella antibodies during
acute and chronic brucellosis. In this test, the
LPS-depleted cytoplasmic protein antigen of Bru-
cella is used as an antigen. The use of this antigen
allows accurate evaluation of relapse of brucello-
sis in a patient because LPS antigenaemia persists
for a longer duration than protein antigen. ELISA
is extremely useful for diagnosing neurobru-
cellosis by demonstrating brucella antibodies in
the CSF.
Brucella Skin Test
It is a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction to
brucella antigen. In this test, brucellin, protein
extracts of the bacteria, is used as an antigen and
is administered intradermally. The presence of
erythema and induration of 6 mm or more within
24 h is suggestive of a positive reaction. This test
is positive only in chronic brucellosis but nega-
tive in acute brucellosis. Repeated negative skin
test excludes brucellosis.
Molecular Detection
PCR has been evaluated for detection and rapid
diagnosis of Brucella species. It exhibits excellent
sensitivity for diagnosing acute disease and
follow-up cases.
Conventional PCR for the detection of Bru-
cella has been in practice since the 90s. Later it
was replaced by real-time PCR for ease of use.
Multiplex PCR is also available to detect multiple
species in a single reaction. Commercial kits are
now available that have increased the use of PCR
in the diagnosis of Brucella. In most cases,
primers encoding 16S rRNA, outer membrane
protein (omp2a, omp2b and omp31), 31 kDa
immunogenic
B.
abortus
protein
(BCSP
31 B4/B5), 16S-23S ribosomal DNA interspace
region (ITS66/ITS279) and insertion sequence
(IS711) are used.
Other Tests
Bone marrow examination shows erythropha-
gocytosis, and CSF cultures for neuro-brucellosis
show pleocytosis, increased protein level and
hypoglycorrhea. Anaemia in 75% of patients,
thrombocytopenia in 40% and pancytopenia in
6% of patients are other features.

604

Brucella
Diagnosis in Animals
The diagnosis of brucellosis in animals is based
on the same method employed to diagnose human
infections. In addition, the culture of milk and
urine from infected animals may give positive
results. Rapid latex agglutination and Rose
Bengal card tests are the rapid diagnostic methods
used
to
diagnose
brucellosis
in
the
cattle
population.
The milk ring test is a frequently used sero-
logical test to demonstrate antibodies in the milk
of infected cattle. This is a screening test used to
detect the presence of Brucella infection in the
infected animal. In this test, a concentrated sus-
pension of killed B. abortus or B. melitensis
stained with haematoxylin is used as an antigen.
This test is performed by adding a drop of
coloured brucella antigen to a whole milk sample
in a test tube. Then it is mixed, and mixed sus-
pension is incubated in a water bath at 70 C for
40–50 min. In a positive test, if antibodies are
present in the milk, the bacilli agglutinate and rise
with the cream to form a blue ring at the top,
leaving the milk unstained. The milk remains
uniformly blue in a negative test without forming
any coloured ring.
Treatment
Brucellae are sensitive to several oral antibiotics
and aminoglycosides. Relapse is common in ther-
apy with a single drug. So, a combination of
antibiotics is recommended whenever possible.
A combination of doxycycline with rifampicin is
effective. Doxycycline given in a dosage of
200 mg/day orally with the addition of streptomy-
cin(rifampicin) in a dosage of 1 g/day given intra-
muscularly for 2–3 weeks is most effective for the
treatment of most forms of brucellosis in adults.
Most of the patients respond to a 6-week course
of therapy with a combination of rifampicin and
doxycycline given orally. Dosage of doxycycline
for 6 weeks with a combination of streptomycin
for the ﬁrst 3 weeks is also effective. Relapse in
brucellosis is due to inadequate therapy and not
due
to
the
development
of
resistance
to
antibiotics.
Epidemiology
Brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic infection
caused by Brucella organisms infecting domestic
animals.
Geographical Distribution
Brucella infection is worldwide in distribution.
The condition is endemic in certain Mediterra-
nean countries. More than 500,000 cases of bru-
cellosis are reported annually, with an estimated
2.4 billion people at risk. The prevalence is
increasing due to growing international tourism,
trade and migration. Different Brucella species
cause human infection in different geographical
areas. B. melitensis is the major species causing
human infection in India.
Habitat
Brucella species are primarily obligate intracellu-
lar pathogens of the reticuloendothelial system,
such as lymph nodes, liver, spleen and bone
marrow.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Brucella species cause infection in a wide range
of hosts. B. melitensis infects goats and sheep;
B. abortus, cattle; B. suis, swines and B. canis,
dogs and foxes. The infected animals, such as
cattle, goats, sheep, buffalos and swine, are the
important reservoirs of infections.
The incidence of human disease is very closely
related to the prevalence of infections in cattle,
goats and sheep. This is also related to activities
that allow exposure of humans to potentially
infected animals or their products.
Human brucellosis is always acquired from
animals directly or indirectly. Brucella is trans-
mitted to humans by ingestion, inhalation, direct
contact or accidental inoculation (Fig. 41.2).
Brucellosis results primarily from ingestion of

drinking contaminated unpasteurised milk or milk
products. The infection can also be transmitted by
drinking
water
or
eating
raw
vegetables
contaminated with faeces or urine of infected
animals and also by eating the meat of infected
animals. The infection is acquired by direct con-
tact with the infected materials of septic abortion
of the animals or at the time of slaughter of
animals. Brucella species present in the infected
materials (placenta, foetuses, vaginal discharge,
urine or infected carcasses) enter the human host
through the mucosa, conjunctiva or skin. The
infection can also be transmitted by inhaling
dust from wool or other dried material of infected
animals. Infection by inhalation is important
among veterinarians and laboratory workers.
Accidental inoculation is a serious risk for labo-
ratory workers who handle the culture of the
organism. The incidence of infection in labora-
tory workers is reported in the Middle East
countries and the United States, China, Peru,
Mexico and India.

Prevention and Control
Pasteurisation or boiling milk is most important to
prevent brucellosis transmission in humans, as
most human infections are acquired by ingesting
contaminated milk and milk products. Also, the
use of protective clothing and gloves by persons
handling or coming into close contact with
animals prevents the transmission of infection.
Vaccination of animals is effective to control
brucellosis in animals. Live attenuated B. abortus
vaccine containing B. abortus 1019 strain has
been used successfully to prevent infection in
cattle. Vaccines are not available against either
B. suis or B. canis. No vaccine is available for
humans.

A 54-year-old male patient attended Medicine
OPD with a history of fever, headache, low back

pain and joint pain for 1 month. History revealed
that he was a shepherd by profession and was in
the habit of consuming unboiled milk. The patient
was admitted and investigated thoroughly. WBC
count was raised. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) was raised; the Widal test was negative.
The serum was negative for HIV antibodies by
ELISA. Peripheral blood smear for malaria para-
site was negative. The blood culture yielded
B. abortus.

Campylobacter and Helicobacter
42
The family Campylobacteraceae consists of two
genera of medical importance: Campylobacter
and Helicobacter.
Genus Campylobacter
Campylobacter infections are one of the most
common bacterial infections in humans. They
ﬁrst obtained importance in the 1970s as a com-
mon cause of both diarrhoeal and other systemic
diseases. The generic name Campylobacter is
derived from the Greek word kampylos, meaning
curved rod. The genus Campylobacter resembles
the genus Vibrio in being motile using polar
ﬂagella and in being curved Gram-negative
bacilli and oxidase positive. They, however, dif-
fer from vibrios in being microaerophilic, not
fermenting carbohydrates and having a lower
guanosine and cytosine content of DNA.
The genus Campylobacter consists of 39 spe-
cies and subspecies, of which at least 15 species
are known to cause infections in humans. These
species
cause
intestinal
and
extraintestinal
diseases (Table 42.1). Campylobacter is the
most important veterinary pathogen. Campylo-
bacter jejuni and Campylobacter fetus are the
two most important species that cause most Cam-
pylobacter infections in humans.

Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Campylobacter is small, comma-shaped Gram-
negative rods. They vary in width from 0.2 to
0.5 μm. They show rapid darting motility in
cork-screw fashion utilising a single polar ﬂagel-
lum
at
one
or
both
poles
(monotrichous/
amphitrichous).
Culture and Biochemical Properties
Campylobacter spp. grow more slowly than other
enteric
bacteria.
Campylobacter
is
microaerophilic, requiring an atmosphere with
decreased
oxygen
concentration
(5%)
and
increased carbon dioxide concentration (5–10%)
for
their
growth.
Most
species,
including
C. jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter
lari and Campylobacter hyointestinalis grow
well at 42 C; hence they are called thermophilic
bacilli.
Selective media for Campylobacter species
are
blood-based
and
antibiotics-containing
media, such as Skirrow, Butzler and Blaser
(Campy-BAP) selective media. Campylobacter
on these media produces well-formed colonies
after 48 h of incubation. C. jejuni produces
moist,
grey
or
colourless,
ﬂat
and
non-haemolytic colonies on this medium. Other
Campylobacter species produce circular and con-
vex colonies.
Campylobacter is relatively biochemically
inert. They are oxidase positive, catalase positive

(C. jejuni subsp. Doyle is an exception) and
nitrate positive. C. jejuni is the only species that
hydrolyses sodium hippurate.

Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Campylobacter spp. survive at 4 C in Cary–Blair
transport medium for many weeks. Campylobac-
ter spp. are sensitive to hydrochloric acid in the
stomach, so conditions that decrease or neutralise
gastric acid secretion reduce the amount of inoc-
ulum needed to cause disease.
Pathogenesis
Campylobacter species are invasive bacteria.
Virulence Factors
C. jejuni possesses many virulence factors, such
as
enterotoxins,
lipopolysaccharide
(LPS),
adhesins and cytotoxic enzymes (Table 42.2).
However, the speciﬁc role of these virulence
factors in the pathogenesis of the disease is not
well known.
Pathogenesis of Enteric Infections
Most
human
infections
occur
by
ingesting
contaminated and improperly cooked poultry
meat products. Human infection follows inges-
tion of 1000–10,000 bacteria, but the illness is
infrequent with a dose of fewer than 10,000
bacteria.
Clinical Syndromes
Campylobacter spp. infections in humans can
present
as
either
enteric
infections
or
extraintestinal infections.
Enteric Infections
C. jejuni is the most important species associated
with human enteric infections. Other Campylo-
bacter species are also associated with enteric
infections
(Table
42.1).
The
clinical
manifestations of enteric infections caused by all
the Campylobacter species, including C. jejuni,
are similar. Watery diarrhoea is the main mani-
festation and occurs in approximately 10% of
children. The condition is also associated with
abdominal pain, malaise, myalgia, headache and
vomiting. The condition is self-limiting.

Extraintestinal Infections
Bacteraemia is the most important extraintestinal
manifestation. Bacteraemia caused by C. jejuni is
uncommon and occurs in patients with immuno-
deﬁciency, chronic disease and old individuals.
C. fetus is the most important Campylobacter
species known to cause perinatal infection
because of its afﬁnity for the genital tract and its
tropism for foetal tissue. Abortion, stillbirth and
premature labour are the common manifestations.
Premature babies show signs and symptoms of
sepsis.
C.
hyointestinalis
causes
occasional
bacteraemia
in
immunocompromised
hosts.
Guillain–Barre syndrome is an autoimmune
disease believed to be due to molecular mimicry
of terminal tetrasaccharide of LPS of C. jejuni and
glycosphingolipid present on the surface of
peripheral nerve. This is a disease of peripheral
nerves and is characterised by ascending paraly-
sis. Periodontal disease is caused by Campylo-
bacter
showae,
Campylobacter
rectus
and
Campylobacter concisus. A rare serotype of
C. jejuni called Penner (LPS type O:19) is
associated with this condition. Reactive arthritis,
haemolytic uremic syndrome and Reiter’s syn-
drome are some of the noted complications
associated with Campylobacter infection.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Diarrhoeic fresh stool is the specimen of choice
for enteric infections. A rectal swab may also be
used. Other specimens include blood, body ﬂuids
and tissues to diagnose extraintestinal infections.
In case of delay, faeces or rectal swabs are
transported in Cary–Blair transport medium.
Campylobacter spp. survive for 1–2 weeks at
4 C in this medium.
Microscopy
Presumptive diagnosis is made by examining the
wet mount of stool by dark-ﬁeld microscopy or
phase-contrast microscopy. The bacteria are
identiﬁed by their characteristic darting motility.
Gram staining of the stool shows typical Gram-
negative, curved rods and ‘gull-wing appear-
ance’. Faecal leucocytes and erythrocytes can
also be detected in Gram-stained smear of the
stool in approximately 75% of patients with Cam-
pylobacter enteritis.
Culture and Identification
Deﬁnitive diagnosis of Campylobacter enteric
infection is best made on the isolation of the
organism by stool culture. Fresh stool specimens
collected within 24 h are inoculated directly on
selective media such as Butzler medium, Skirrow
medium,
Preston–Campylobacter
selective
medium and Blaser medium. However, old stool
specimens are ﬁrst enriched in an enrichment
medium, such as Preston–Campylobacter enrich-
ment broth, for at least 24 h at 4 C (cold enrich-
ment) before inoculating on the selective media.
Inoculated media are incubated in 5% O2 and
10% CO2 at 42 C for 48 h. If C. fetus or other
unusual Campylobacter species are suspected,
stool specimens are inoculated on media without
antibiotics and are incubated at 37 C. Other
extraintestinal specimens, such as blood, body
ﬂuids and tissue, can be inoculated on routine
media to isolate Campylobacter species.
Oxidase-positive
and
catalase-positive
C. jejuni produce moist, grey or colourless, ﬂat
and non-haemolytic colonies on Skirrow, Butzler

and Campy-BAP selective media. It is biochemi-
cally inert and is the only species that hydrolyses
sodium hippurate.
610
42
Campylobacter and Helicobacter
Histology
Examination by sigmoidoscopy shows widening
or proctocolitis in up to 80% of patients with
Campylobacter enteritis. The histopathological
changes include faecal mucosal oedema and
hyperaemia with crypt-abscess formation.
Serology
ELISA is available to demonstrate speciﬁc
antibodies in the serum, and a high titre of
antibodies is usually seen after the symptoms are
resolved. Serology may not be useful for routine
diagnosis but
is
useful
for
epidemiological
studies.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect
enteric Campylobacter infection. Conventional
and qPCR are used to target single species
(i.e. multiplex PCR) in the sample. Common
gene targets include 16S rRNA, ﬂaA, ﬂab, heat
shock protein genes Hsp60, cytochrome oxidase
ccoN, etc.
Treatment
Most C. jejuni infections are mild and self-
limited. Therefore, they do not require antibiotic
therapy. Supportive treatment is adequate. Treat-
ment with antibiotics is recommended only for
persons with fever and bloody diarrhoea and
symptoms persisting for more than 7 days. Eryth-
romycin is the antibiotic of choice. Ciproﬂoxacin
and tetracycline are alternative antibiotics but are
not recommended in young children. Recently,
reports
of
erythromycin-
and
ciproﬂoxacin-
resistant
strains
have
increasingly
been
documented from many parts of the world.
Epidemiology
Campylobacter infections are extremely common
worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Campylobacter infection occurs in all age groups.
Campylobacter enteritis is common in children
younger than 5 years. In contrast, Campylobacter
bacteraemia
occurs
in
patients
older
than
65 years.
Habitat
In infected humans, C. jejuni inhabits the duode-
num, jejunum and colon. C. fetus inhabits the
genital tract of infected mothers.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Campylobacter infections are zoonotic. Infected
animals are the main reservoir of infection. The
animal reservoirs are the dogs, cats and other pets
that carry the organism in their gastrointestinal
tract. Infected animal food products are the source
of infection. Most human infections occur by
ingesting contaminated and improperly cooked
poultry meat products. The infection also occurs
by
drinking
contaminated
raw
milk
or
unpasteurised milk. The infection may also be
transmitted from infected animals and humans
by the faeco–oral route on ingestion of food and
water contaminated with human or animal faeces.
C. fetus infection may be transmitted from person
to person by sexual contact.
Prevention and Control
Thorough cooking of all poultry products and
strict personal hygiene (such as washing hands
with soap before and after handling raw foods of
animal origin) are the measures for preventing
Campylobacter infections.
Genus Helicobacter
Helicobacter are Campylobacter-like bacteria
with a spiral or helical morphology. They are
motile using sheathed ﬂagella. Helicobacter spp.
inhabit the stomach of humans and many other
mammals, such as monkeys, dogs, cats, ferrets,
mice, etc. The genus Helicobacter consists of
many species associated with human diseases

(Table 42.3). Of these, Helicobacter pylori,
Helicobacter cinaedi and Helicobacter fennelliae
are three important species that cause human
infections.

Helicobacter pylori
The association of H. pylori with gastritis, peptic
ulcer,
gastric
adenocarcinoma
and
gastric
mucosa-associated lymphoid type (MALT) and
B-cell lymphoma is recognised worldwide.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
H. pylori is a curved, spiral or S-shaped Gram-
negative bacillus measuring 3 μm in length and
0.5–0.9 μm in breadth. The organism is highly
mobile and shows cork-screw motility due to the
presence of a unipolar tuft of lophotrichous
ﬂagella.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
H. pylori is microaerophilic and grows in the
presence of decreased oxygen concentration
(5%) and increased carbon dioxide concentration
(10%) in a temperature range between 30 and
37 C. The bacteria do not grow anaerobically,
grow poorly at 42 C and do not grow at all at
25 C. H. pylori grows well on freshly prepared
chocolate
agar
and
Skirrow–Campylobacter
media. H. pylori produces circular, convex and
translucent colonies on these media after an incu-
bation of 3–5 days.
H. pylori produces the enzyme urease, which
is almost 100 times more active than that pro-
duced by Proteus vulgaris. Urease production is
the most important feature of H. pylori. H. pylori
is catalase and oxidase positive. It is biochemi-
cally inactive and does not ferment or oxidise
sugars, although it can metabolise amino acids
by fermentative pathways.
Pathogenesis
H. pylori is an invasive bacterium that character-
istically causes alteration of gastric acid produc-
tion, gastric inﬂammation and tissue destruction.
Virulence Factors
H. pylori produces several virulence factors such
as urease, ﬂagella, adhesins, Hsp-B, acid inhib-
itory protein and cytotoxin, contributing to the
disease’s pathogenesis (Table 42.4). Of these, the
enzyme urease is a very important factor in
colonising H. pylori in the gastric mucosa. The
enzyme produces ammonia from urea, which
increases the gastric mucosa’s pH near the bacte-
rial cell. Therefore, it helps to neutralise gastric
acidity and the colonisation of the organism in
gastric mucosa. The enzyme also stimulates
monocytes and neutrophil chemotaxis and the
production of cytokines.
According to DNA-level analysis studies,
H. pylori is more genetically diverse amongst all
the bacterial species. These diversity patterns may
affect the ability of the bacteria to colonise or
cause disease in speciﬁc hosts. The whole-
genome sequence of the bacterium revealed the
presence of certain alleles of genes, such as
cytotoxin-associated gene (cag) and vacuolating

cytotoxin gene (vac), which plays an important
role in pathogenesis.

Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori
Infection
H. pylori infection begins with the colonisation of
gastric mucosa, which is facilitated by many vir-
ulence factors. H. pylori blocks the production of
acid by its acid inhibitory protein and neutralises
gastric acidity via ammonia from urea by the
enzyme urease. Heat shock proteins enhance the
biological activity of urease further. Subse-
quently, Helicobacter passes through gastric
mucosa through their active cork-screw motility
and adheres to epithelial cells. The adhesion is
mediated by many adhesin proteins, such as
haemagglutinin, sialic acid-binding adhesin and
Lewis’s
blood-group
adhesin.
H.
pylori
is
protected from phagocytosis and intracellular
killing by enzymes, such as elastases and super-
oxide dismutase. After adhesion, damage to the
epithelial cells is caused by multiple factors, such
as mucinases, phospholipases, vacuolating aﬂa-
toxin and the by-products of urease. Finally,
Helicobacter infection causes atrophic and even
metaplastic changes in the stomach.
Clinical Syndromes
H. pylori in humans causes peptic ulcer disease
and chronic atrophic gastritis.
Peptic Ulcer Disease
H. pylori is now accepted to be the infective
pathogen that causes most gastric and duodenal
ulcers. Treatment of H. pylori infection by spe-
ciﬁc antibiotics and thereby eliminating the
organism from the stomach results in healing of
these ulcers and a marked reduction in the recur-
rence of ulcers.
Chronic Atrophic Gastritis
H. pylori infection causes chronic atrophic gastri-
tis during the later stage of the illness. Chronic
gastritis is now recognised as a risk factor for
many gastric malignancies. Gastric adenocarci-
noma and squamous cell oropharyngeal cancer
are
the
most
important
complications
of
H. pylori infection. Gastric MALT lymphomas
show a better prognosis than gastric adenocarci-
noma and are found to regress after elimination of
H. pylori by treatment.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include stool samples and gastric biopsy
specimens.
Microscopy
H. pylori is demonstrated by microscopic exami-
nation of gastric biopsy specimen stained with
Gram,
Giemsa,
Warthin–Starry
silver
and

haematoxylin-eosin
stains.
A
stained
smear
shows typical curved, spiral or S-shaped Gram-
negative bacillus. All these stains show organisms
of H. pylori adhered to the gastric mucosa. These
methods are highly speciﬁc.
Helicobacter pylori
613
Fig. 42.1 Positive rapid
urease test shown by
Helicobacter pylori
Culture and Identification
Diagnosis of H. pylori infection is made by cul-
ture of clinical specimens on freshly prepared
chocolate
agar
and
Skirrow–Campylobacter
selective
media
followed
by
incubation
at
35–37 C in a microaerophilic environment (5%
O2, 10% CO2 and 85% N2) for 3–5 days. H. pylori
produces convex, circular and large colonies on
these selective media. H. pylori produces circular,
convex and translucent colonies on freshly
prepared chocolate agar and Skirrow–Campylo-
bacter media.
The colonies are oxidase positive and catalase
positive
and
show
characteristic
cork-screw
motility. H. pylori produces the enzyme urease,
which is almost 100 times more active than that
produced by P. vulgaris. Urease production,
detected by the urease test, is the most important
feature of H. pylori.
Urease Test
It
is
the
most
rapid
test
which
can
be
demonstrated directly in the biopsy specimen. In
this test, the biopsy tissues are put in a urease
indicator medium (0.5 mL urea solution with an
indicator) and incubated at 37 C. If H. pylori is
present, the colour of the medium changes due to
the change of pH of the medium within a few
minutes to 2 h due to the production of ammonia.
The test is highly speciﬁc (100%), but sensitivity
varies from 75% to 95% (Fig. 42.1).
Faecal Antigen Test
It is an immunochromatographic test that uses
monoclonal antibodies for direct detection of
H. pylori antigen in stool samples. This test is
very sensitive (94%) and speciﬁc (98%).
Serology
ELISA is used to demonstrate serum antibodies
against H. pylori in the patient serum. However,
since the antibody titres continue to remain ele-
vated a long time after H. pylori eradication, the
antibody-based test cannot distinguish between
recent and old infections. ELISA shows high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Rapid Urea-Breath Test
This test is based on detecting the products of
urea degraded by H. pylori. In this method,
patients drink a beverage containing urea labelled
with a carbon isotope, such as carbon 13 or 14.

After a short time, the concentration of labelled
carbon is measured in the breath. The concentra-
tion is high only when urease present in H. pylori
found in the stomach breaks down the urea. In a
normal human host, the concentration of the
labelled carbon in-breath is not high because the
human stomach does not contain any urease. A
positive urea-breath test indicates H. pylori infec-
tion. The breath test is very selective. The test’s
disadvantage is that it may show false-positive
results in a) infections with coccoid forms of
H. pylori that do not produce more urease
enzymes and b) patients receiving antibiotics,
such as bismuth and histamine-2 blockers, and it
needs facility for isotope detection (Fig. 42.2).
614
42
Campylobacter and Helicobacter
Treatment
H. pylori is sensitive to several antibiotics and
bismuth salts. Using a single antibiotic or an
antibiotic containing bismuth is not effective. A
higher success has been achieved by using a
combination of bismuth, a proton-pump inhibitor
(e.g. omeprazole) and one or more antibiotics
(ampicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin and
tetracycline) for the treatment of gastric or peptic
ulcer. Combining three types of drugs is known as
triple therapy and is usually given for either 10 or
14 days. Recently, H. pylori strains resistant to
macrolides have been reported. Also, some
strains resistant to clarithromycin have been
documented in children.

Epidemiology
H. pylori is ubiquitous and found worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
H. pylori infection occurs more frequently in
developing countries than in developed countries.
Habitat
H. pylori colonise the gastric mucosa of healthy
persons and persons suffering from peptic ulcer
diseases.

Other Helicobacter Species
615
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are the primary reservoirs of infection.
The prevalence rate of H. pylori infection may
differ based on geographical area and race. Poor
hygiene, overcrowding and poverty facilitate
transmission. The most likely route of H. pylori
infection is either faecal-to-oral infection (from
stool-to-mouth) or oral-to-oral (stomach contents
transmitted from mouth-to-mouth) contact.
Prevention and Control
Improved personal hygiene is important in the
prevention of the disease.
Other Helicobacter Species
H. fennelliae (formerly known as Campylobacter
fennelliae) and H. cinaedi (formerly known as
Campylobacter cinaedi) have been isolated from
homosexual men with concurrent HIV and tuber-
culosis
infection
suffering
from
proctitis,
proctocolitis
or
enteritis.
Helicobacter-like
organisms have been described in the last decade.
Helicobacter mustelae was ﬁrst described in
ferrets, and subsequently, Helicobacter hepaticus
has been detected in Syrian hamsters by using
speciﬁc
PCR
tests.
These
Helicobacter-like
organisms do not cause any infection in humans
but are suggested as useful models for studying
H. pylori infections.
Case Study

fever and has been passing the stool mixed with
blood. The child had consumed a lunch consisting
of boiled rice, green salads, vegetables and
tomato soup. The stool sample was sent to the
microbiology laboratory for culture. C. jejuni was

Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
43
Spirochetes have been classiﬁed in the order
Spirochaetes. They vary in size from 5 to
500 μm in length. Many of them are free-living
saprophytes, while a few are obligate parasites.
They may be aerobic, anaerobic or facultative.
Spirochetes
show
common
morphological
properties. They are thin, helical and Gram
negative. They are also elongated, motile and
ﬂexible, twisted spirally along the long axis, giv-
ing these bacteria the name spirochetes (spiral
meaning “coiled”, chait meaning “hair”). The
presence of endoﬂagella is the characteristic
feature
of
spirochetes.
Endoﬂagella
is
the
polar
ﬂagella
situated
between
the
outer
membrane and cell wall. They are responsible
for
the
spiral
shape
and
motility
of
the
spirochetes. Spirochetes exhibit three types of
motilities: (1) ﬂexion and extension, (2) cork-
screw-like rotatory movement and (3) translatory
motion.
The
order
Spirochaetales
is
subdivided
into
two
families:
Spirochaetaceae
and
Leptospiraceae.
The
family
Spirochaetaceae
consists of four genera: Spirochete, Cristispira,
Treponema and Borrelia. The genera Treponema
and Borrelia include pathogenic species, which
cause diseases in humans. Members of the genus
Cristispira
are
found
in
molluscs,
while
Spirochetes are saprophytes found in sewage
and
water.
Family
Leptospiraceae
contains
only one genus Leptospira, which consists of
species pathogenic to humans. The spirochetes
causing disease in humans are summarised in
Table 43.1.

Genus Treponema
The generic name Treponema is derived from the
Greek word Trepos meaning “to turn” and nema
meaning “thread”. The treponemes are short and
slender spirochetes with ﬁne spirals and pointed
ends. Some are pathogenic for humans, while
others occur as commensals in the mouth, intes-
tine and genitalia. Pathogenic members of the
genus include Treponema pallidum (with three
subspecies) and Treponema carateum. All these
species are morphologically identical, produce
the
same
serological
responses
in
infected
humans and are sensitive to penicillin. These
species, however, differ in their (1) clinical
manifestations, (2) natural history of the disease
they cause and (3) epidemiological features.
As for recent nomenclature and taxonomical
studies,
species
T.
pallidum
consists
of
T. pallidum subsp. pallidum causing venereal
syphilis, T. pallidum subsp. endemicum causing
endemic syphilis or bejel, T. pallidum subsp.
pertenue causing yaws and T. carateum causing
pinta. In this book, T. pallidum subsp. pallidum is
referred to as T. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp.
pertenue
as
Treponema
pertenue
and
T. pallidum subsp. endemicum as T. endemicum
for the sake of familiarity.

T. pallidum is the causative agent of syphilis, the
most common sexually transmitted disease.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
T. pallidum is a thin, coiled spirochete. It
measures 0.1 μm in breadth and 5–15 μm i
length. It has a 6–10 sharp and angular coil.
T. pallidum is too thin to be seen by microscopy
in specimens stained by simple Gram or Giemsa
staining. It is stained by the silver impregnation
method, which makes the bacteria thickened by
the
deposition
of
silver
compounds
during
staining. Levaditi method (Fig. 43.1) and Fontana
method are examples of silver impregnation
staining methods, useful for staining tissue
sections and blood ﬁlms, respectively.

Endoﬂagella is responsible for the motility of
the bacteria. Three, occasionally four ﬂagella,
known as endoﬂagella, originate from each end
of T. pallidum. They extend towards the opposite
end of the bacteria in the space between the cell
wall and outer membrane layer. This endoﬂagella
does not extend beyond the cell wall but remains
always conﬁned within the outer membrane
layer. T. pallidum shows three types of motilities:
ﬂexion of the whole body, backward and forward
movement and rotation around the long axis.
As the Treponema moves, it shows a series of
secondary curves which appear and disappear,
but
its
primary
spiral
structure
remains
unchanged.


Treponema pallidum
619
Dark-ground or phase-contrast microscopy is
useful for demonstrating the morphology and
motility of live T. pallidum. T. pallidum on elec-
tron microscopy shows a trilaminar cytoplasmic
membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The latter
contains peptidoglycan that confers the cell its
shape and rigidity. An outer membrane layer
surrounds the cell wall.
Culture
T. pallidum does not grow in artiﬁcial culture
media. T. pallidum had been maintained for a
long time by sub-culture in animals.
The Nichole strain of T. pallidum is a patho-
genic strain that has been maintained for several
decades by serial passage in rabbit testes.
This strain was isolated in 1913, originally
from the brain of a fatal case of a patient with
general paralysis of insane. This strain is most
commonly used for diagnostic and research
purposes
in
the
laboratory.
Strains
of
T. pallidum have been maintained for a short
period in cell lines, such as Eagle and McCoy
cell lines supplemented with foetal bovine serum
and reducing agent.
Treponema phagedenis (earlier known as
Reiter Treponema) and Treponema refringens
are examples of non-pathogenic treponemes.
These treponemes can be grown in Smith–
Noguchi medium or digest broth enriched with
serum under strictly anaerobic conditions. Reiter
strain is widely used to prepare antigen for use in
group-speciﬁc
treponemal
tests
to
diagnose
syphilis.
Other Properties
Sensitivity to Physical and Chemical Agents
T. pallidum is a very delicate bacterium. It is
readily killed by drying or heating at 41–42 C
for 60 min, at 0–4 C for 1–3 days. It is also
readily killed on contact with distilled water,
soap, arsenic compounds, mercuric compounds,
bismuth compounds and common antiseptics.
T. pallidum strains can be preserved for labora-
tory use by many methods. It can be stored frozen
in a medium containing 5% glycerol at 70 C or in
liquid nitrogen at
130 C for 10–15 years.
Antigenic Structure
T. pallidum is antigenically complex. Infection by
the bacteria induces the production of at least
three types of antibodies against (1) cardiolipin
antigen, (2) group-speciﬁc antigens and (3) spe-
cies-speciﬁc antigens of T. pallidum.
The cardiolipin antigen is a hapten and is
chemically a phosphatidylglycerol. This hapten
elicits the production of an antibody, known as
reagin antibody, in the blood of a patient suffering
from syphilis. Demonstration of the reaginic
antibodies in the serum forms the basis of stan-
dard non-speciﬁc tests for syphilis (e.g. VDRL,
Kahn and Wasserman). This cardiolipin antigen is
demonstrated in T. pallidum. However, it is
unknown whether the reagin antibody is pro-
duced by cardiolipin that is present in the Trepo-
nema or by the cardiolipin that is released from
damaged
tissues
following
infection
by
Treponema.
T. pallidum group-speciﬁc antigen is protein
in nature. It is found in T. pallidum and
non-pathogenic cultivable treponemes, such as
Reiter Treponeme. This antigen induces the pro-
duction of antibodies in the serum, which is found
in patients with syphilis. Reiter protein complex
complement ﬁxation test, a test used in syphilis
serology, employs this antigen to detect serum
antibodies in patients with syphilis.
T.
pallidum
species-speciﬁc
antigen
is
probably polysaccharide in nature. This antigen
induces the development of antibodies, which can
be detected in the serum of the patients suffering
from syphilis. The speciﬁc treponemal test, such
as the T. pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA)
test, detects antibodies by using these antigens.
Immunity
Immunity in syphilis is incomplete. For example,
both humoral antibodies and cell-mediated immu-
nity prevent the formation of the chancre, a pri-
mary lesion on re-infection with T. pallidum, but
they do not clear the organisms from the sites of
infection. Their failure to kill the organism possi-
bly (1) is due to the presence of the outer layer of
the
Treponema,
which
lacks
immunogenic
molecules or (2) may be due to downregulation
of helper T cells of the TH1 class.

Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Pathogenesis
T. pallidum is a strict human pathogen.
Virulence Factors
The virulence of T. pallidum has recently been
studied
by
cloning
T.
pallidum
genes
in
Escherichia
coli
and
demonstrating
various
proteins. Although many proteins have been
isolated from pathogenic treponemes, the exact
role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of the
disease remains unclear.
The outer membrane protein of T. pallidum
appears to play an important role in the virulence
of
the
bacteria.
It
promotes
adherence
of
T. pallidum to the surface of host cells, thereby
facilitating the infection. Enzyme hyaluronidase
produced by only pathogenic treponemes may
facilitate perivascular inﬁltration. Fibronectin
present in the infected host cell forms a coating
on the surface of pathogenic Treponema, thereby
preventing it from phagocytosis by macrophages.
Pathogenesis of Syphilis
T. pallidum causes disease by invasion and mul-
tiplication at the site of infection, then spreading
via circulation and producing disseminated dis-
ease. The host’s immune response is believed to
be responsible primarily for tissue destruction and
causing pathogenic lesions observed in patients
with syphilis.
On sexual contact, T. pallidum from an
infected partner is passed to another partner
through an intact mucous membrane or through
minor skin abrasions. The organisms invade the
skin at these lesions and multiply at the site of
infection. The chancre is the primary lesion,
which develops at the site of infection. Subse-
quently, the treponemes get transmitted in the
bloodstream and produce disseminated lesions
(papular skin rashes, mucous patches in the oro-
pharynx, etc.). During the course of infection, the
condition may progress to the late stage of the
disease, and possibly all tissues are affected by
T. pallidum. Every stage of the disease—whether
primary, secondary or late—represents localised
multiplication of the treponemes and destruction
of the tissues.
Clinical Syndromes
T. pallidum causes syphilis transmitted by sexual
contact. Congenital syphilis and occupational
syphilis are examples of non-sexual transmission.
Syphilis depending on the transmission, can be
venereal syphilis or non-venereal syphilis.
Venereal Syphilis
The condition is transmitted by sexual contact has
an incubation period of 4 weeks, varying from
10 to 90 days. Clinical manifestation progresses
through different stages (primary, secondary or
tertiary) if remains untreated.
Primary Syphilis
The condition occurs within 3 weeks of sexual
contact.
The
chancre
is
a
primary
lesion
(Fig. 43.2). It is a single or solitary lesion with a
surrounding areola. The edge and base of the
ulcer have a button-like consistency on palpation.
Hence it is called hard chancre to differentiate it
from the soft chancre caused by Haemophilus
ducry. The lesion occurs on the penis or the
scrotum of 75% of men and the vulva, cervix or
perineum of more than 50% of women suffering
from syphilis. The chancre is highly infectious.
The exudates of the chancre contain numerous
T. pallidum bacteria.
Secondary Syphilis
The condition occurs 2–10 weeks after the pri-
mary chancre and is most ﬂorid 3–4 months after
infection. This stage is characterised by mucocu-
taneous lesions, which are discrete, macular pink
to red and measure 3–10 mm in diameter. The
cutaneous lesions may vary from macular to pap-
ular, pustular and nodular type. The papules in the
moist area of the skin of the body folds, especially
about
the
anus
and
genitalia,
subsequently
become broad, ﬂat and pink in colour, leading to
the formation of the so-called condylomata lata.
The lesions are found in the entire body, includ-
ing the palms, sole and other sites. This condition
is associated with mild symptoms of headache,
nausea, fever and pain in the bones. Painless
generalised lymphadenopathy is seen in nearly
85% of the patients.

Tertiary Syphilis
It develops within 3–10 years of infection.
Gumma is a typical pathological lesion found on
the skin, in the mouth and the upper respiratory
tract. Gummatous lesions may be multiple or
diffused but are usually single lesions, measuring
from 1 cm to several centimetres in diameter.
This
lesion
contains
few
spirochetes
and
represents manifestations of delayed hypersensi-
tivity. Cardiovascular syphilis, chronic granulo-
matous and meningovascular manifestations and
neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis, general paralysis of
insane) are the other manifestations of syphilis,
which occur several decades after the infection.
Non-venereal Syphilis
Congenital syphilis and occupational syphilis are
an example of non-venereal syphilis.
Congenital Syphilis
The condition occurs by vertical transmission
from mother to foetus during pregnancy. If the
mother is suffering from secondary syphilis and is
not treated for the same, a higher proportion of
infants are affected compared to untreated early
latent syphilis. In more than 40% of untreated
maternal infections, T. pallidum causes late abor-
tion, stillbirth and death. Deaths in neonates may
occur
due
to
secondary
bacterial
infection,
fulminant hepatitis or pulmonary haemorrhage.
Infants suffering from congenital syphilis are
born usually without any overt clinical manifesta-
tion of the disease. Poor feeding and rhinitis may
be the earliest signs of congenital syphilis.
Manifestations of late-onset congenital syphilis
include neurosyphilis and involvement of the
eighth cranial nerve, teeth and bones.
Occupational Syphilis
It is a condition that may occur in medical and
paramedical workers handling a case of second-
ary syphilis. The lesion usually develops on the
palm of infected health workers and may also
occur on other exposed body parts.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Since the clinical manifestations of syphilis are
protean, laboratory tests play an important role in
conﬁrming the disease’s diagnosis.
Specimens
Specimens
for
microscopy
include
serous
transudates from moist lesions, such as primary
chancre, condyloma latum and mucous patch.
The
serum
is
used
for
serodiagnosis,
and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) is used to diagnose

a
neurosyphilis.
Specimens
from
the
oral
cavity
cannot
be
used
because
saprophytic
non-pathogenic treponemes are present as normal
ﬂora of the oropharynx.
622

Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Microscopy
Dark-ﬁeld microscopy is useful for diagnosing
primary, secondary or congenital syphilis by
demonstrating treponemes in the clinical speci-
men. It is particularly helpful for diagnosis early
in the disease before the appearance of serum
antibodies. T. pallidum is identiﬁed by its slender
spiral structure and slow movement. Dark-ﬁeld
microscopy,
although
useful,
has
many
limitations. First, it is reliable only when exam-
ined by an experienced microscopist. Second, the
method is of low sensitivity because as high as
104 bacteria per millilitre of the exudates need to
be present for demonstration by dark-ground
microscopy.
Direct ﬂuorescent antibody T. pallidum
(DFA-TP) is a sensitive and better method for
direct detection of treponemal antigen in the
exudates for diagnosis of syphilis. The test using
ﬂuorescent-tagged T. pallidum antibodies is used
to detect treponemal antigen directly in the
acetone-ﬁxed smears of the exudates. The test is
highly sensitive.
Culture
Since T. pallidum cannot be cultured on an artiﬁ-
cial medium, culture is not used to diagnose
syphilis.
Serology
Serology is the mainstay in the diagnosis of
syphilis. These tests are broadly of two types: a)
Standard tests of syphilis (STS) and b) Tests
using T. pallidum.
Standard Tests of Syphilis
This
group
of
tests
uses
cardiolipin,
non-treponemal
antigen,
and
detects
reagin
antibodies. The Wasserman complement ﬁxation
test was the ﬁrst serological test used in 1906, and
the Kahn tube ﬂocculation test is no longer used
nowadays. VDRL and rapid plasma reagin (RPR)
tests are examples of STS being used currently.
Reagin antibodies are produced against lipid
antigens present on the surface of treponemes or
produced as a result of damage of the infected
host cells during the early stage of the disease.
The antibodies appear 7–10 days after the appear-
ance of the primary chancre or 3–5 weeks after
active
infection
in
primary
syphilis.
These
antibodies also develop in syphilitic patients
with
secondary
and
latent
diseases.
These
antibodies do not appear in early primary syphilis,
latent acquired syphilis of long duration and late
congenital syphilis. Therefore, Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory (VDRL) and other tests may
show
false-negative
reactions
during
these
conditions.
Prozone phenomenon occurs in approximately
2% of patients with secondary syphilis, in patients
with congenital syphilis and pregnant women. A
high
level
of
reaginic
antibodies
in
these
conditions may lead to a false-negative reaction
with undiluted serum. Repeating the test with
several dilutions of the patient serum excludes
this phenomenon.
VDRL Test
It is a slide ﬂocculation test used widely to diag-
nose syphilis. The test is so named because it was
developed ﬁrst in the VDRL, USPHS, New York.
This is a simple and more rapid test, which uses
cardiolipin antigen with added lecithin and cho-
lesterol. In this test, the serum is inactivated at
56 C for 30 min, and a measured volume of
serum is placed on a special cavity slide. The
cardiolipin antigen after preparation is added to
the serum sample on a slide and is rotated on a
VDRL rotator for a speciﬁed period of 4 min. The
reaction is read under a low-power objective of a
microscope. The cardiolipin antigen reacts with
reagin antibodies in the infected serum and forms
visible clumps in a positive test. Cardiolipin
remains as uniform crystals in the serum in a
negative test. The test result is reported as reac-
tive, weak reactive or non-reactive depending on
the extent of the formation of the clumps. The
antibody titre of the serum can also be determined
by testing on serial dilutions. The endpoint’s
reciprocal is considered the titre (e.g. reactive
eight dilutions or titre 8). VDRL test can also be

performed
on
CSF
samples.
Unlike
serum
samples, CSF samples are not heated prior to the
test. The VDRL test becomes positive 4–5 weeks
after exposure to T. pallidum and 1–2 weeks after
the appearance of the chancre.
Treponema pallidum
623
The VDRL test is highly sensitive. The sensi-
tivity of the test depends on the stage of the
disease. The test is 60–75% sensitive in primary
syphilis and 100% sensitive in secondary syphi-
lis. High antibody titres may be found in patients
developing gummous lesions and neurovascular
or cardiovascular complications. VDRL test is
negative in the tertiary or third stage of syphilis.
This test is negative in early primary syphilis,
latent acquired syphilis and late congenital
syphilis.
Quantitation of the sera is useful to monitor the
activity of the disease and is of prognostic value.
The quantitative estimation of reaginic antibodies
is a good prognostic marker used for the treatment
of syphilis. A fourfold decrease in titre following
therapy suggests adequate therapy, whereas a
fourfold increase in titre of reaginic antibodies
following
therapy
suggests
re-infection
or
relapse. The reaginic test becomes negative
1 year after successful therapy in primary syphi-
lis, 2 years after successful therapy in secondary
or congenital syphilis and 5 years after successful
therapy in late syphilis. In some cases of
neurosyphilis, this reaginic test may become neg-
ative with serum but positive with the CSF.
The main disadvantage of the VDRL test is
that it shows biological false positive (BFP)
reactions. BFP reactions are deﬁned as positive
reactions observed with a test using cardiolipin
antigen but are negative with a speciﬁc test using
Treponema antigen. These results are not due to
technical
faults.
They
represent
antibody
responses to non-treponemal cardiolipin antigens
found in other tissues. BFP reactions are classi-
ﬁed as acute or chronic reactions. The reactions
that become negative within 6 months are called
acute reactions, while those found for a longer
period are called chronic reactions.
Table 43.2 Biological false positive (BFP) reactions of standard tests for syphilis
Acute BFP reactions
Acute bacterial or viral infections
Injuries or inﬂammatory conditions
Early HIV infection
Chronic BFP reactions
Patients with parenteral drug use
Autoimmune or connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
Ageing
Patients with hypergammaglobulinemia
Other infectious conditions, such as tropical eosinophilia, malaria, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, leprosy and
relapsing fever
Acute BFP reactions are typically seen in
acute bacterial or viral infections, injuries or
inﬂammatory conditions and early HIV infection.
Chronic BFP reactions last for more than
6 months. This is seen in patients with parenteral
drug use, autoimmune or connective tissue
diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,
ageing and hypergammaglobulinemia, also seen
in other infectious conditions, such as tropical
eosinophilia, malaria, infectious mononucleosis,
hepatitis,
leprosy
and
relapsing
fever
(Table 43.2). The BFP reactions can usually be
ruled out by using a Treponema-speciﬁc test.
The VDRL enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) is a modiﬁcation of the VDRL
test, which is being used to detect both IgM and
IgG antibodies separately in the patient serum.
This test is used mainly for large-scale screening
of patient serum.
Rapid Plasma Reagin Test
It is a popular test used to diagnose syphilis by
demonstrating reaginic antibodies. The test uses
VDRL antigen containing ﬁnely divided carbon
particles suspended in choline chloride. The latter
destroys inhibitory factors in the serum, thus
avoiding the need to heat the serum before test-
ing. The use of this antigen produces a clearer and

well-deﬁned ﬂocculation reaction easily observed
by the naked eye. The RPR test is used for testing
serum or plasma but not for the CSF. Automated
RPR test is a modiﬁcation of the RPR test, which
is used for screening a large number of serum
samples. The unheated serum reagin test is a
ﬂocculation
test
used
to
detect
cardiolipin
antibodies. Toluidine red unheated serum test
is used for testing CSF samples.
624
43
Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Treponema pallidum-specific tests
Treponema-speciﬁc tests measure antibodies spe-
ciﬁc for T. pallidum. These tests use (1) live
T. pallidum strains (T. pallidum immobilisation
test), (2) killed T. pallidum (T. pallidum aggluti-
nation test, T. pallidum immune adherence test
and ﬂuorescent treponemal antibody test) or
(3) T. pallidum extracts as antigens [TPHA test
and EIA (enzyme immunoassay)].
Treponema pallidum Immobilisation Test
The test uses live T. pallidum strains that detects
the treponemal antibodies in the patient’s serum.
The test, when introduced, was the most speciﬁc
serological test for the diagnosis of syphilis.
However, this test is no longer used because of
its complexity and difﬁculty maintaining live
treponemal strains. Similarly, the T. pallidum
agglutination test that uses killed T. pallidum
suspension inactivated by formalin is no longer
used because it is non-speciﬁc and is associated
with
false-positive
reactions.
T.
pallidum
immune
adherence
test
is
also
not
used
nowadays.
Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody (FTA) Test
It is the most speciﬁc and popular test used to
diagnose syphilis. It is indirect immunoﬂuores-
cence (IIF) test, which uses acetone-ﬁxed smears
of T. pallidum on the slides. The test is performed
by adding a drop of test serum to the smear on the
slide, followed by washing and re-incubating the
smear with ﬂuorescent labelled antihuman immu-
noglobulin. The slide is examined under a ﬂuo-
rescence
microscope.
The
demonstration
of
ﬂuorescent treponemes is suggestive of a positive
FTA test.
FTA Absorption (FTA-Abs)
It is a modiﬁcation of FTA-Abs, which shows
high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. In this test, the
patient’s serum is ﬁrst absorbed with a sonicated
extract of non-pathogenic T. phagedenis (Reiter
Treponeme) to remove group-speciﬁc antibodies.
The test is almost as speciﬁc as the TPI test and is
considered a standard reference test in syphilis
serology. The FTA-Abs test is positive in 80%
primary syphilis, 100% secondary syphilis and
95% tertiary syphilis. The test is highly speciﬁc
(92–99%).
IgM FTA-Abs Test
It is another modiﬁcation of FTA-Abs used to
detect serum IgM antibodies in congenital syphi-
lis. This test is used to differentiate seropositivity
due
to
passively
transferred
IgG
maternal
antibodies to the foetus from IgM antibodies
found in utero in congenital syphilis.
Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination
Assay (TPHA)
The assay uses erythrocytes sensitised with a
sonicated extract of T. pallidum as antigen.
TPHA has now been modiﬁed to perform in
microtitre plates and is called the microtitre
haemagglutination T. pallidum (MHA-TP) test.
This test is performed by incubating the serial
dilution of the patient’s serum with erythrocytes
sensitised with T. pallidum antigen in a microtitre
plate. If antibodies are present, haemagglutination
of RBCs occurs. The serum samples before test-
ing for TPHA are re-absorbed with a diluent
containing Reiter Treponeme, rabbit testes and
sheep erythrocytes.
TPHA is as speciﬁc as FTA-Abs but less
sensitive than FTA-Abs in primary syphilis. It is
also equally sensitive to FTA-Abs in secondary
and late syphilis. After successful therapy, the
haemagglutinating
antibodies
persist
in
the
serum
for
longer;
hence, this test has
no

prognostic value. The negative TPHA that virtu-
ally excludes the diagnosis of syphilis except
during the early stage of the disease and
eliminates the diagnosis of neurosyphilis’s is the
most widely used treponemal test available com-
mercially. It is simple, economical and does not
require expensive, sophisticated equipment.
Treponema pallidum
625
Enzyme Immune Assays (EIA)
These assays use ultrasonicated T. pallidum anti-
gen coated on tubes or ferrous metal beads as a
solid-phase
carrier
for
antigen.
The
serum
antibodies are detected by an enzymatic reaction.
The test is available commercially.
Western Blot
Western Blot is the gold standard for anti-TP
antibody detection. Compared to other antibody
assays, like ELISA, it has greater sensitivity and
speciﬁcity to conﬁrm samples showing inconsis-
tent results between ELISA and TPPA.
Molecular Detection
It has emerged as a very promising tool for
detecting T. pallidum in clinical samples mostly
because of its ability to detect without culturing,
wherein it is very difﬁcult to grow the organism in
culture. Five types of molecular strategy, includ-
ing routine PCR, nested PCR (nPCR), real-time
PCR
(qPCR),
reverse
transcription
PCR
(RT-PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal ampliﬁ-
cation (LAMP), are available for diagnostic
purposes. In most cases, the target genes are
polA, tpp47, BMP, 16S rRNA gene, tmpC and
tmpA. For molecular tests, samples are often
obtained from lesion sites, including genital,
anal or oral ulcers, surface rashes, tissue lesions
and mucosal erosion. Recently, nested PCR also
uses blood, urine and saliva samples. The sensi-
tivity and speciﬁcity of detection range from 78.4
to 89.1% and 93.1 to 100% in primary syphilis,
however, much lower for secondary syphilis.

All the treponemal tests are not completely
speciﬁc for syphilis. They also show false-
positive
reactions
in
patients
with
other
spirochaetal
diseases,
such
as
leptospirosis,
relapsing fever, Lyme disease, pinta, yaws and
rat-bite fever. The sensitivity of common tests
performed
for
the
diagnosis
of
syphilis
is
summarised in Table 43.3. The test accuracy of
various
diagnostic
methods
in
syphilis
is
presented in Table 43.4.
Serological Assay Diagnostic Utility
Serological screening of syphilis varies across the
globe. For example, in the United Kingdom,
VDRL and TPHA are being used in combination
to screen syphilis. The results obtained from this
serological test are more reliable since it can
detect antibodies in all three stages of syphilis.
However, early primary cases might show false-
negative reactions, and in these cases, a repeat
serological test is required after 1–3 months to
rule out syphilis. In the USA, syphilis serological
screening is done using VDRL and RPR. This
combination of tests may fail to diagnose 1% of
secondary syphilis due to excessive antibodies
(prozone phenomenon), and it also gives about
30% of false-negative results in latent and late
syphilis.

Response to Treatment
The re-infections and treatment response can be
monitored
using
quantitative
non-speciﬁc
treponemal tests, such as VDRL and RPR. Fol-
lowing treatment, the VDRL and RPR tests
become negative. At times, early treatment
administration may not raise the antibody titre at
all. In primary syphilis, treatment reverses the
seropositivity in 4 months. In secondary and
early latent stages, it requires 12–18 months,
whereas, in later stages, it may require 5 or more
years for screevers. However, in a few cases,
xenoreactivity with very low titre persists for a
long time despite the completion of proper effec-
tive treatment. Speciﬁc treponemal tests, such as
TPHA remains positive even after complete ther-
apy; hence, they are of little use as a prognostic
marker of treatment response. However, TPHA
titre may drop sharply after treatment in second-
ary syphilis, but low syphilis antibody titre
remains throughout the lifetime.
Congenital Syphilis Diagnosis
Since IgM cannot cross the placenta, in neonates’
detection of IgM antibodies is the deﬁnitive diag-
nosis. Modiﬁcations of FTA-Abs, TPHA, EIA
and VDRL tests are currently available for IgM
antibody detection in syphilis. Screening of
maternal and neonatal blood may be useful in
congenital syphilis since neonatal serum always
shows a higher titre of antibodies than maternal
serum.
A histological examination of the placenta and
cord are performed when congenital syphilis is
suspected before or during delivery. Also, des-
quamation or ulcerative skin lesions or nasal dis-
charge (“snufﬂes”) is examined by dark-ﬁeld
microscopy or ﬂuorescent antibody techniques.
Infants exposed to syphilis in utero are taken for
serological testing, regardless of maternal treat-
ment. Asymptomatic infants for positive mothers,
however, are monitored monthly until their
non-treponemal antibody disappears.
In 2017, WHO had released the “WHO Guide-
line on Syphilis Screening and Treatment for
Pregnant
Women”
that
includes
updated
recommendations for syphilis screening and treat-
ment for pregnant women based on the most
recent evidence and available serologic tests for
syphilis.
Treatment
Penicillin is the drug of choice to treat all the
stages of syphilis. A single intramuscular dose
of benzathine penicillin G (50,000 units per kg,
not to exceed 2.4 million units) effectively treats
primary, secondary and early latent syphilis. No
reports of T. pallidum showing resistance to peni-
cillin have been documented. Doxycycline or tet-
racycline may be used for non-pregnant patients
allergic to penicillin. Jarisch–Herxheimer reac-
tion is a noted complication observed following

therapy with antibiotics. It is characterised by
chills, rigors, an increase in temperature, a
decrease in blood pressure and tachycardia. This
reaction occurs due to the production of endo-
toxin and other toxic products released following
rapid killing and lysis of the bacteria.
Non-Venereal Treponematosis
627
Epidemiology
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease found
worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Syphilis occurs worldwide, mostly in large cities.
The disease is extremely common in areas of dry,
hot climates. Also, it is common in areas of poor
economic status, education and personal hygiene.
Habitat
T. pallidum inhabits the genital tract of infected
males and females.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
T. pallidum is a strict human pathogen and does
not naturally occur in any animal species.
Humans are the only natural hosts. Infected
human hosts secreting T. pallidum in serous
transudates from moist lesions, such as primary
chancre, condyloma latum and mucous patch, are
the sources of infection. Transmission of syphilis
occurs i) primarily through sexual contact by
inoculation of the spirochetes through mucosal
membranes and abrasions on epithelial surfaces’)
by vertical transmission of early syphilis during
pregnancy, and by transfusion of T. pallidum-
contaminated blood. Unprotected sex, promiscu-
ous sex and intravenous drug use are the
major risk factors for syphilis. Doctors, nursing
staff
and
other
healthcare
workers
are
at
occupational risk.
Syphilis in persons with human immunodeﬁ-
ciency virus (HIV) infection is a problem increas-
ingly recognised recently. Concomitant HIV and
syphilis are common. The presence of HIV may
result in extremely high antibody titres, which
do
not
decrease
even
following
adequate
treatment.
Prevention and Control
Avoidance
of
sexual
contact
with
infected
partners avoids transmission of infection. Use of
condoms during sexual intercourse or antiseptics
(such as potassium permanganate) or prophylac-
tic use of antibiotics may minimise the risk of
transmission of the disease. However, penicillin
prophylaxis carries the danger that it may sup-
press the primary lesion without eliminating the
infection.
Non-Venereal Treponematosis
The condition includes three distinct entities:
endemic
syphilis,
yaws
and
pinta.
These
conditions are found in several parts of the
world
associated
with
poor
socioeconomic
conditions and poor hygiene.
Endemic Syphilis
Endemic syphilis is a non-venereal treponemal
infection reported from different parts of the
world. The condition, also known as bejel in the
Middle East, njovera in Zimbabwe, dichuchwa in
Bechuanaland, Skerjevo in Eastern Europe and
siti in Zambia, is caused by T. pallidum subsp.
endemicum.
The
condition
has
also
been
documented in India.
The disease is transmitted from person to per-
son by using contaminated utensils. The disease
is commonly seen in young children. The initial
lesions, such as primary chancre, are rarely seen.
Secondary manifestations of syphilis are usually
seen, including lesions, like oral papules and
mucosal patches. Late manifestations of the dis-
ease include gummatous lesions of skin, bones
and nasopharynx. The laboratory diagnosis and
treatment of endemic syphilis are similar to vene-
real syphilis.

628
43
Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Yaws
Yaws is a non-venereal treponemal disease
caused by T. pertenue. The condition, also
known as pian, parangi, etc., is prevalent in the
primitive tropical parts of central Africa, South
America and Southeast Asia.
The causative agent, T. pertenue, is morpho-
logically and antigenically similar to T. pallidum.
The pathogen causes yaws, which is characterised
by an extragenital papule, which subsequently
enlarges and breaks down to form an ulcerating
granuloma. Late manifestations of the disease
include destructive lesions of the skin, bone and
lymph nodes. The disease is transmitted by direct
contact with infected skin lesions. Laboratory
diagnosis and treatment are similar to that of
venereal syphilis.
Pinta
Pinta is a contagious disease of the skin caused by
T. carateum. Pinta, also known as carate, mal del
pinto, is endemic in Central and South America
and the neighbouring islands. An extragenital
papule is the primary skin lesion observed in the
condition. Small pruritic papules develop on the
skin’s surface after an incubation period of
1–3 weeks. These lesions do not ulcerate but
enlarge and persist for months to years before
resolving. If it remains untreated, the condition
progresses to form disseminated recurrent and
hypopigmented lesions leading to scarring and
disﬁgurement. Pinta spreads by direct contact
with infected lesions. Laboratory diagnosis and
treatment are the same as for syphilis.
Non-Pathogenic Treponemes
Non-pathogenic treponemes are a heterogeneous
group of treponemes found as commensals on the
buccal and genital mucosa. They are also found
on the surface of gastric and colonic epithelium in
humans and animals. These include Treponema
denticola, Treponema macrodentium, Treponema
oralis, Treponema socranskii and Treponema
pectinovorum. T. denticola is an oral treponeme
easily
cultivable
on
an
artiﬁcial
medium.
T. phagedenis is also known as Reiter and
Kazan strain, and T. refringens is also known as
Nichol strain.
Genus Borrelia
The genus Borrelia consists of many species
found as commensals on buccal and genital
mucosa. Members of the genus Borrelia cause
two important diseases in humans. Epidemic or
louse-borne relapsing fever is caused by Borrelia
recurrentis, whereas endemic relapsing fever is
caused by as many as 15 species of Borrelia.
These
include
Borrelia
duttoni,
Borrelia
henselae, Borrelia parkeri, Borrelia turicatae,
etc. Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease.
Borrelia recurrentis
B. recurrentis is the causative agent of relapsing
fever, which manifests as one or more relapses of
fever after the subsidence of primary paroxysm of
fever.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
B. recurrentis has an unequal spiral-shaped struc-
ture with one or both the ends pointed. It
measures 8–20 μm in length and 0.2–0.4 μm in
breadth. It possesses 15–20 endoﬂagella per cell
and 5–10 loose, uneven spiral coils. The spiral
coils
are
coarser
and
more
irregular
than
treponemes and leptospires. It is Gram negative.
It can be stained by Wright and Giemsa stain. It is
actively motile in fresh blood preparation, moves
forward
and
backward
waves
and
exhibits
corkscrew-like motility.
Culture
Borrelia is microaerophilic. The bacteria grow at
an optimum temperature of 28–30 C. They have
complex nutritional requirements, hence are

difﬁcult to grow on artiﬁcial media. They can
grow in the chorioallantoic membrane of the
chick embryo. Mice or rats are highly susceptible
to infection. Primary isolation of bacteria from
clinical specimens can be made by intraperitoneal
inoculation of specimens in these laboratory
animals.
After
inoculation,
borreliae
appear
early in the blood and also are found in the brain
for a longer time.
Borrelia recurrentis
629
Pathogenesis
B. recurrentis is an invasive bacterium. It enters
the skin and causes disease.
Virulence Factors
The ability of B. recurrentis to undergo antigenic
shift and escape from immune clearance of the
host is the main virulence factor attributed to the
bacteria. The antigenic shift or antigenic varia-
tion is a unique property exhibited by Borrelia in
humans and is responsible for causing relapse,
characteristically seen in the relapsing fever
caused by the bacteria. DNA rearrangement in
linear plasmid present in Borrelia appears to be
responsible for antigenic variations shown by the
bacteria.
Pathogenesis of Relapsing Fever
B. recurrentis penetrates the skin, reaches the
blood circulation and invades various organs in
the body and causes the disease. After the inva-
sion of blood by bacteria, Borrelia-speciﬁc IgM
antibodies
agglutinate
Borrelia
and
cause
complement-mediated lysis. This leads to the
rapid clearing of Borrelia from the bloodstream.
Borrelia present in the internal tissue alters their
serotype-speciﬁc outer proteins through gene
rearrangement and exhibits a new antigen.
The IgM antibodies produced against old
antigens are not effective against the Borrelia
pathogens exhibiting new antigenic variation.
The host immunity responds again by producing
speciﬁc antibodies against these new antigens and
clears the organism from circulation. Patients
recover after several relapses due to the develop-
ment of humoral immunity.
Clinical Syndromes
B. recurrentis causes relapsing fever, the epi-
demic
louse-borne
and
endemic
tick-borne
relapsing fever.
Relapsing Fever
Clinical manifestations of epidemic louse-borne
and endemic tick-borne relapsing fever are essen-
tially similar. The incubation period is usually
7 days. Two or more episodes of high fever,
headache and myalgia are the hallmarks of the
disease. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are the
associated symptoms. These symptoms corre-
spond to the bacteraemia phase of the disease
when Borrelia is found in large numbers in the
patient’s blood (Fig. 43.3).
The fever subsides after 3–7 days when the
Borrelia is cleared from the circulation. After an
afebrile period of 4–7 days, bacteraemia occurs,
and fever re-appears. The Borrelia re-appears in
the blood during relapse of the fever. The condi-
tion ultimately subsides after 3–10 relapses. A
single relapse is the characteristic of the epidemic
louse-borne disease and is usually associated with
high morbidity of 4–50%. Repeated relapses are
common in endemic tick-borne diseases and are
usually associated with low mortality of less than
5%. Humoral immunity contributes to recovery in
a patient after many relapses.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimen
Blood collected from a patient during fever, but
not from an afebrile patient, is a useful specimen.
Microscopy
A wet mount preparation of the blood examined
by dark-ﬁeld or phase-contrast microscopy is a
useful method for direct observation of Borrelia.
The organisms are identiﬁed by their dashing
movements. Borrelia organisms can also be
demonstrated in a peripheral blood smear stained
with Giemsa or Wright stains. Staining is the
most sensitive method for diagnosing 70% or
more patients with louse-borne relapsing fever.

Culture
Cultures are not carried out routinely for the iso-
lation of Borrelia from clinical specimens. This is
because
Borrelia
organisms
have
complex
nutritional requirements for their growth, and
they grow very slowly on these media.
Animal Inoculation
Animal inoculation is a more sensitive method.
This test is performed by inoculating a mouse
intraperitoneally with 1–2 mL of blood from the
infected patient. The blood is collected from the
tail vein of the mice after 1–10 days. Blood is
examined for the presence of Borrelia daily for
3 weeks.
Serology
B. recurrentis causing relapsing fever undergoes
antigenic phase variation; hence, serological tests
are not useful in diagnosing the condition.
Molecular Detection
PCR-based tests have been developed for the
laboratory-based diagnosis of relapsing fevers.
In most cases, real-time PCR targeting the 16S
rRNA gene or the glpQ gene is used. It improves
the sensitivity and speciﬁcity, resulting in more
accurate and timely detection of the organism.
Commercial kits are now available for detection.
Treatment
Tetracycline or erythromycin is most effective for
the treatment of relapsing fever. Doxycycline is
usually recommended for children and pregnant
women.
Epidemiology
Epidemic louse-borne relapsing fever now has
disappeared with improvement in hygiene and
the use of insecticides.
Geographical Distribution
It is an important disease only in north-eastern
Africa, especially in the islands of Ethiopia and in

South America. Endemic tick-borne relapsing
fever has worldwide distribution and is endemic
in western states of the United States.
Borrelia burgdorferi
631
Habitat
B. recurrentis is found in the bloodstream and the
spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys and bone marrow of
the infected patients suffering from relapsing
fever.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are the only reservoir of epidemic relaps-
ing fever. No extra-human reservoir is known.
The infection is transmitted only from person to
person. Persons suffering from relapsing fever are
the source of infection. The human body louse
(Pediculus humanus corporis) is the vector of the
disease. No extra-human reservoir is known.
Borrelia is found only in the haemolymph of the
lice. They are not excreted in saliva or excreta.
Hence, the infection is transmitted by being
crushed and rubbed on the absorbed skin. The
bite of the lice does not transmit them. Endemic
tick-borne relapsing fever is a zoonotic disease
transmitted from animals to humans, rodents or
small mammals.
Soft ticks (Ornithodoros species) are the main
vectors of the disease. Unlike the louse-borne
infection, B. recurrentis produces a disseminated
infection in ticks. However, the vector survives
from the infection and becomes a reservoir of
the infection by transovarian transmission. The
Borrelia organisms are found in all parts of the
tick’s body; hence, they are secreted in the saliva
and excreta. Therefore, the infection is transmit-
ted to humans by the bite of the ticks. Several
species
of
the
genus
Ornithodoros
act
as
reservoirs
in
different
parts
of
the
world.
Ornithodoros tholozani, Ornithodoros crossi,
Ornithodoros lahorensis and the fowl tick,
Argas persicus, are the vectors in India. Soft
ticks are primarily nocturnal feeders. They feed
while the host sleeps and remain attached for only
a few minutes. Hence, the bite of the tick goes
usually unnoticed.
Prevention and Control
Prevention of louse inﬁltration and insecticide use
are the measures that prevent louse-borne relaps-
ing fever. Prevention of tick-borne relapsing fever
consists of wearing protective clothing, use of
insect repellents and avoidance of ticks and their
natural habitat. No vaccine is available for relaps-
ing fever.
Borrelia vincenti
B. vincenti is a motile spirochete measuring
7–18 μm in length and 0.2–0.6 μm in breadth. It
is Gram negative and is usually stained with
Giemsa and Leishman stain. B. vincenti is an
obligate anaerobe found as a normal commensal
in
the
mouth.
The
bacteria
under
certain
predisposing conditions (such as malnutrition
and viral infections) produce a condition known
as Vincent angina. Vincent angina is ulcerative
gingivostomatitis
or
oropharyngitis
often
associated with fusiform bacilli (Fusobacterium
fusiforme). It is characterised by the formation of
an ulcer on the mouth and tonsillar areas.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made
by demonstrating B. vincenti and fusiform bacilli
in stained smears of exudate from the lesion. This
bacterium is grown with difﬁculty on enriched
media anaerobically. Penicillin and metronida-
zole are effective for the treatment of the
condition.
Borrelia burgdorferi
B. burgdorferi, a newly identiﬁed Borrelia spe-
cies, is the causative agent of Lyme disease.
Lyme disease was ﬁrst demonstrated in children
in 1975, during an outbreak of arthritis in Lyme,
Connecticut, in the United States. The causative
agent of the fever was isolated by Burgdorfer in
1982, after whom the species burgdorferi is
named. B. burgdorferi is a fastidious bacterium,
which measures 4–30 μm in length and 0.2 μm in

breadth. It is helical and Gram negative. It is a
microaerophilic spirochete, which can be grown
on BSK (Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly) medium at
33 C after incubation for 2 weeks or longer.
632
43
Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease transmit-
ted to humans by ixodid ticks. The incubation
period varies from 7 to 14 days. After the tick’s
bite, B. burgdorferi is inoculated through the skin
and then spreads locally. The local spread of the
bacteria causes erythema migrans, a rash seen in
approximately two-thirds of the cases. This skin
rash may be a conﬂuent patch of erythema or may
have central clearing. The lesion begins as a small
macular papule and becomes larger over the next
many weeks, and forms a large area of lesion of
5–50 cm in diameter.
The patient may also complain of fever, chills,
myalgias and headache during the early stage of
the disease, with or without rash. Subsequently,
during a time ranging from days to months, the
bacteria spread through blood circulation and
cause disseminated disease. This disease is
characterised by the presence of multiple ery-
thema migrans, systemic complications (fever,
myalgias, arthralgia, malaise and headache) and
even septic meningitis; this disease usually
develops 3–10 weeks after the tick bite. The path-
ogenesis of these late manifestations is poorly
understood. It is not known whether the live
organisms cause these manifestations or these
manifestations occur due to an antigenic cross-
reactivity to Borrelia antigens.
Lyme disease has been reported in the USA,
Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavian
countries. Lyme disease is a zoonotic disease.
Rodents, bears and other mammals are the natural
reservoir hosts. Hard ticks (ixodid ticks) are the
vectors of the disease. The infection is transmitted
by the hard tick from mice to humans and occur
by regurgitation during a tick bite. Individuals
exposed to hard ticks are at increased risk for
Lyme disease.
Clinical diagnosis of the condition may be
made by the presence of erythema migrans in
the early stage of the disease. Laboratory diagno-
sis of the condition is primarily serological.
Serodiagnosis depends on the demonstration of
speciﬁc antibodies in the serum, which persist for
many years even after eradicating the infection.
ELISA and IIF are the most common serological
tests employed to diagnose the disease. Western
blot is used to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of serum
positive by ELISA or IIF. Serology is positive in
one-third of the patients with the early disease, in
90% of patients with early disseminated disease
and all the patients with late disease. Microscopy
is not recommended because B. burgdorferi is
rarely seen in clinical specimens. Culture is also
not used because the bacteria are difﬁcult to
culture.
Amoxicillin, tetracycline, cefuroxime or ceftri-
axone are effective for treating Lyme disease.
Avoidance of exposure to ticks and use of
insecticides are useful methods for preventing
the disease.
Genus Leptospira
Traditionally, the genus Leptospira has been
grouped by serological properties and by their
pathogenicity into two species: the pathogenic
Leptospira
interrogans
and
non-pathogenic
Leptospira biﬂexa. Based on shared antigens,
these
species
were
further
divided
into
serogroups, serovars and strains (Table 43.5).
Pathogenic
species
L.
interrogans
currently
includes more than 250 serovars. However, the
classiﬁcation is not consistent with recent classi-
ﬁcation based on nucleic acid analysis.
The current classiﬁcation based on nucleic
acid
analysis
divides
L.
interrogans
and
L. biﬂexa complex into 12 species. These species
are further subdivided into serogroups, serovars
and strains based on microscopic agglutination
tests (MATs). L. interrogans complex includes
pathogenic leptospires that cause leptospirosis.
L. biﬂexa consists of non-pathogenic leptospires
and includes more than 63 serovars. L. biﬂexa is
so-called because of its double-curved structure
(Biﬂexa: twice bend). These are mostly free-
living saprophytes found in moist environmental
areas but are not associated with disease in
humans and animals.

Leptospira Interrogans Complex
L. interrogans complex includes pathogenic
leptospires that cause leptospirosis. The disease,
often referred to as swamp fever, mud fever or
swineherd disease, is the most common zoonosis
in the world.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
L. interrogans are thin, delicate, coiled spirochetes
measuring 6–20 μm length and 0.1 μm in breadth.
They are actively motile by means of two peri-
plasmic ﬂagella, each present at the opposite end
of the bacteria by continually spinning on the long
axes. They possess tightly coiled spirals and
hooked ends, resembling an umbrella handle.
They stain poorly with aniline dyes but stain
well with silver impregnation methods, such as
Levaditi and Fontana (Fig. 43.4).
Culture
L. interrogans are obligate aerobes. They use
fatty acids and alcohols as the source of carbon
and energy. They grow at an optimum tempera-
ture of 25–30 C and optimum pH of 7.2–7.5.
Leptospires are unique spirochetes—they can be
grown in an artiﬁcial medium. They grow on
special media enriched with rabbit serum or
bovine serum albumin. Korthof medium, Stuart
medium and Fetcher medium are frequently used
media for the culture of Leptospira. Ellinghausen,
McCullough,
Johnson
and
Harris
(EMJH)
medium is a semi-synthetic medium commonly
used nowadays for the culture of Leptospira.
Leptospira can be grown on the chorioallan-
toic membrane of 10- to 20-day-old chick
embryos. The bacteria are demonstrated in the
blood of the allantoic sac 4–5 days after inocula-
tion. Animal inoculation is a useful method for
obtaining a pure culture of Leptospira. The bacte-
ria are inoculated intraperitoneally in guinea pigs,
followed by blood collection from the heart
10 min after inoculation. Culture of the heart
blood yields pure colonies of L. interrogans.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Leptospira is readily killed by heating at 50 C for
10 min and 60 C for 10 s. The acidity of gastric
juice destroys them in 30 min and by the bile.
They are also readily destroyed by chlorine and


commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants.
They die rapidly in acidic urine, salty or brackish
water and non-aerated sewage.

Antigenic Structure
Leptospira organisms show a considerable degree
of antigenic cross-reactivity. A genus-speciﬁc
somatic antigen is present in all Leptospira,
based on which leptospires are classiﬁed into
serogroups and serotypes. This has been divided
further based on DNA homology into serogroups,
serovars, strains, etc.
Pathogenesis
L. interrogans is an invasive bacterium.
Virulence Factors
Direct invasion and multiplication in the blood
and tissue is the main virulence determinant of
Leptospira. Although the direct invasion of
leptospires may cause tissue damage, it is now
observed that the degree of multi-organ tissue
injury does not correlate with the number of
Leptospira in infected tissues. Therefore, it is
suggested
that
other
factors,
such
as
the
endotoxin, haemolysin and lipase, may also
contribute to the pathogenicity of Leptospira.
However,
the
exact
virulence
factors
of
Leptospira are not known. The factors responsi-
ble for causing injury to host tissues remain
unclear and appear to be a complex interaction
of many factors.
Pathogenesis of Leptospirosis
The severity of the leptospirosis depends on
(1) host immunity, (2) virulence of infecting
strain and (3) the number of infecting leptospires.
After Leptospira enters the body through various
sites, it multiplies in blood and tissues, resulting
in leptospiraemia. Leptospira can spread to any
part of the body but primarily affects the liver and
kidney. In the kidney, the bacterium causes inter-
stitial necrosis and tubular necrosis. Subse-
quently, the bacterium causes tubular damage,
hypovolemia due to dehydration and altered cap-
illary permeability, causing renal failure. In the
liver, it causes centrilobular necrosis and hepato-
cellular
dysfunction
leading
to
jaundice.
Leptospira may also invade skeletal muscle, caus-
ing oedema and focal necrosis.

Humoral immunity plays an important role in
the clearance of leptospires from circulation. The
host’s immune reactions to Leptospira appear to
be responsible for many complications, such as
meningitis and other clinical manifestations seen
during the later stage of the disease (Fig. 43.5).
Clinical Syndromes
L. interrogans causes leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis occurs as two recognisable clinical
syndromes as anicteric leptospirosis and icteric
leptospirosis. The incubation period varies from
2 to 30 days but is usually about 10–14 days.
Anicteric Leptospirosis
The condition occurs in a majority (90%) of
infections with L. interrogans. It manifests as a
mild anicteric (absence of jaundice) form of the
disease. These clinically inapparent infections are
diagnosed
only
by
demonstrating
speciﬁc
Leptospira antibodies in the patient serum.
Icteric Leptospirosis
Approximately 10% of the patients develop
icteric manifestations of the disease, otherwise
known
as
Weil
disease.
The
disease
is
characterised by the development of jaundice.
The
disease
shows
two
distinct
phases:
septicaemic and immune (leptospuric), but these
two
phases
of
illness
are
continuous
and
indistinguishable.

Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Septicaemia or leptospiraemia phage is the
ﬁrst stage. This stage is so-called because, during
this phase, Leptospira organisms are usually
isolated from the blood, CSF and most tissues
by culture. This stage is characterised by a
non-speciﬁc inﬂuenza-like illness with fever and
myalgias. This phase lasts for 4–7 days. The ﬁrst
stage is followed by a 1- to 3-day period of
improvement during which the temperature falls,
and the patient becomes afebrile and relatively
asymptomatic.
Immune or leptospuric phage is the second
stage that starts with the recurrence of fever. This
stage is called the immune or leptospuric stage
because circulating antibodies may be detected in
serum, or Leptospira may be isolated from the
urine but not from blood or CSF. It occurs as a
result of the body’s immune response to infection.
It is characterised by diseases affecting speciﬁc
organs, such as the meninges, liver, kidney
and eye.
Aseptic meningitis is the most important clini-
cal manifestation. Profound jaundice, renal dys-
function,
pulmonary
dysfunction,
hepatic
necrosis and haemorrhagic diastases are other
severe manifestations. Mortality is very high
(5–10%) with Weil syndrome.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Blood, urine and CSF are commonly used
to demonstrate leptospires by microscopy or
culture.
Microscopy
Dark-ﬁeld microscopy is employed to demon-
strate motile leptospires in wet mount blood prep-
aration
directly.
The
method
is
useful
for
detecting leptospires in the blood, early in the
disease, but not in the late stage. However, the
dark-ﬁeld microscopy is relatively insensitive
and also shows false-positive results. Protein
ﬁlaments from erythrocytes and other blood
artefacts can be easily mistaken for Leptospira.
Gram
stain
or
silver
impregnation
staining
methods are not useful to detect leptospires.
Examination of urine is carried out by dark-
ground microscopy to demonstrate Leptospira.
Centrifuged urine can be used especially during
the second week of the disease and till 4–6 weeks,
during which they appear intermittently for
Leptospira. Leptospira is fragile in nature, and it
dies off in stored urine. Hence, the captured urine
should be microscopically examined as quickly as
possible.
A direct ﬂuorescent antibody test is used to
detect Leptospira antigen directly in blood or
CSF. The method, however, is not widely used
due to the difﬁculty in the availability of this test.
Culture and Identification
Isolation of the organism in the culture of blood,
CSF and urine establishes the speciﬁc diagnosis
of leptospirosis. The positivity of the culture
depends upon the time of collection of blood.
Blood culture is positive if the specimen is
collected 4 days after the onset of symptoms. It
may be negative if collected too early or too late.
CSF culture is positive when the specimen is
collected within the ﬁrst 10 days. Direct culture
from urine is rarely possible because of other
contaminant bacteria.
The specimens are cultured on Fetcher, Stuart
or EMJH media supplemented with neomycin
and
5-ﬂuorouracil.
The
culture
bottles
are
incubated at 37 C for 2 days and then in the
dark, at room temperature for 2 weeks. The
cultures
are
examined every
third
day for
leptospires by examining in the dark-ground
microscope. Primary isolation requires a longer
period of incubation for many weeks to months.
The identiﬁcation of Leptospira isolates is
made by agglutination tests using type-speciﬁc
sera. Identifying isolates in particular serogroups,
serovars, etc., is cumbersome; hence, it is not
carried out in routine laboratories but at reference
laboratories.
Animal Inoculation
Leptospires can be isolated by animal inoculation.
Blood is the usual specimen, which is inoculated
intraperitoneally into young guinea pigs. If the
blood contains virulent L. interrogans, the guinea
pig develops fever jaundice and dies within

8–12 days with haemorrhages into the veins and
serous cavities.
Leptospira Interrogans Complex
637
Serology
Serological tests are increasingly used for the
diagnosis of leptospirosis.
Microscopic agglutination test is the tradi-
tional gold standard, available only at reference
laboratories for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis.
This test depends on the ability of the patient’s
serum to agglutinate live leptospires obtained by
culture. The MAT uses a battery of antigens taken
from
common
(frequently
locally
endemic)
Leptospira serovars prepared from the Leptospira
strains cultured on the media. The test is
performed by mixing the Leptospira antigen
with serial dilutions of the patient’s sera and
examining microscopically for agglutination of
Leptospira antigens. A single titre exceeding 1:
200 or serial dilutions exceeding 1:100 is sugges-
tive of leptospirosis. A fourfold rise in convales-
cent serum is also considered positive. The MAT
is highly sensitive (92%) and speciﬁc (95%).
The MAT shows a false-negative reaction with
serum specimens collected in the immune phase
of
the
disease
and
patients
treated
with
antibiotics. The MAT may show false-positive
reactions with serum from the cases of Lyme
disease, Legionella infection and syphilis.
Another group of serological tests detects
serum-speciﬁc
antibodies
by
employing
non-pathogenic L. biﬂexa Petco I strain. These
tests do not employ the exact infective serovars.
Examples of such tests are the microscopic slide
agglutination test, indirect haemagglutination
assay (IHA), the leptospirosis immunoglobulin
M (IgM) dipstick test, latex agglutination test
and the Leptospira immunoglobulin G (IgG)
ELISA. IgM ELISA is of value for diagnosing
new infections within 3–5 days.

such as a thermal cycler. Combining PCR with a

Treponema, Borrelia and Leptospira
Epidemiology
Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic bac-
terial disease throughout the world.
Geographical Distribution
Leptospirosis is distributed worldwide, occurring
with the greatest frequency in the tropics. This is
not found in the polar regions. The condition is
much more common in the Caribbean islands, the
Paciﬁc islands, Central and South America and
Southeast Asia.
Habitat
In an infected host, leptospires are found to mul-
tiply in the blood and any organ of the body but
most
commonly
in
the
liver,
kidney
and
meninges.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Leptospirosis
is
a
zoonotic
disease.
Wild
mammals are the primary reservoirs of infection.
Leptospires infect as many as 160 mammalian
species, including rats, dogs, cats, cattle, pigs,
raccoons and other animals. Rodents are the
most important reservoirs of infection worldwide.
Leptospirosis in animals is usually a sub-clinical
infection. Leptospires are found for a long period
in the kidneys of these animals; as a result,
animals excrete a large number of leptospires in
their urine without showing any evidence of clin-
ical disease. The leptospires survive in the soil for
as many as 24 days and in freshwater for as many
as 30 days.

The urine of the infected animals containing
a large number of leptospires is the most impor-
tant source of infection. Direct contact with
the infected urine or urine-contaminated inani-
mate
objects
results
in
human
infections.
Animal bedding, soil, mud and aborted tissues
are
examples
of
such
inanimate
objects
contaminated with infected urine. The infection
is transmitted to humans (1) through intact
mucous membrane or conjunctiva; (2) through
minor abrasions on the surface of the skin, water-
logged skinnier; (3) through the nasal mucosa and
cribriform
plate;
(4)
through
inhalation
of
aerosolised body ﬂuids and (5) by congenital
infection (from infected mother to foetus through
the placenta).
Differences
between
leptospires
and
treponemes are summarised in Table 43.7.

Leptospira Interrogans Complex
639
Prevention and Control
Preventive measures include detecting cases
and detecting a common source of infection.
Disinfection of water supplies, rodent control
and wearing protective clothing control disease
transmission. Leptospire infection in livestock is
controlled by improved sanitation, immunisation
of animals and proper veterinary care.
Recently, human vaccines have been available
against
leptospirosis.
These
vaccines
are
recommended only for high-risk workers. These
vaccines are serovar speciﬁc and usually given
every year.
Case Study
A 28-year-old hairdresser complained of a pain-
less small ulcer on the penis during the last
2 weeks. He said he had repeated sexual relations
with a female sex worker many months back
when asked. The pus exudate from the smear
did not reveal any Treponema on examination.
The serum sample was positive for syphilis by the
VDRL test. ELISA for HIV was negative.

Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia
44
Rickettsiae are obligate, intracellular, very small
(0.3  1–2 μm), Gram-negative bacilli that mul-
tiply within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.
They have a very small genome composed of
1–1.5 million base pairs. Because of their small
size, these organisms were once thought to be
viruses. Nevertheless, these organisms are bacte-
ria because they (1) have typical Gram-negative
cell walls, (2) contain both DNA and RNA
enzymes for the Kreb cycle and ribosomes for
protein synthesis, (3) multiply by binary ﬁssion
and (4) are susceptible to antibiotics.
Rickettsiae
are
primary
pathogens
of
arthropods, such as lice, ﬂeas, ticks and mites.
In these hosts, they are found in their intestinal
tract. They are usually transmitted to humans by
arthropod vectors, such as lice, mites, ticks, etc.
Coxiella burnetii causing Q fever is an exception,
usually transmitted by airborne droplets. They
also infect humans in whom they are found in
the
reticuloendothelial
cells
and
vascular
endothelium.
Classification
Rickettsiae are a group of bacteria that phylogen-
etically occupy a position between bacteria and
viruses. These pathogens are included in the order
Rickettsiales,
tribe
Rickettsiae
and
family
Rickettsiaceae. Family Rickettsiaceae comprises
three genera: Rickettsia, Orientia and Ehrlichia.
Rickettsiae
are
strict
intracellular
parasites.
Earlier, the genus Coxiella was included in the
family Rickettsiaceae but now has been excluded
from it because, unlike other genera of the family
Rickettsiaceae, Coxiella organisms are not pri-
marily obligate intracellular parasites. They can
grow in cell-free media.

The cell wall of all four genera is typical of
Gram-negative bacteria. They have lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan layers. The
LPS shows weak endotoxic activity. The bacteria
are non-motile, do not have any ﬂagella and are
surrounded by a loose slime layer. Rickettsiae
that cause human diseases are summarised in
Table 44.1.

erably in severity from self-limiting illness to

Culture
Rickettsiae fail to grow on cell-free media. They
grow inside the cell, usually in the cytoplasm
(most Rickettsia) or in the cell’s nucleus (Rickett-
sia causing spotted fever). They grow well at an
optimum temperature of 32–35 C. They grow in
various cell lines, developing chick embryos and
laboratory animals.
They grow on cell lines such as HeLa, Hep2,
Detriot-6, mouse ﬁbroblasts and other continuous
cell lines. Cultures in the cell lines are used pri-
marily to maintain Rickettsia but are not useful for
primary isolation of Rickettsia from clinical
specimens.
In the developing chick embryo 5–6 days old,
Rickettsia spp. grow well in the yolk sac. The
inoculated eggs are incubated at 35 C for most
Rickettsia spp. and at 33 C for the spotted group.
The yolk sac is widely used as a source of Rick-
ettsia for the preparation of rickettsial antigens
and vaccines. Rickettsia shows poor growth on
the chorioallantoic membrane.
Guinea pigs and mice are the commonly used
laboratory
animals
to
isolate
Rickettsia
organisms from animal specimens.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
The extracellular Rickettsia organisms are very
delicate microorganisms. They are rapidly killed
by heating at 56 C and room temperature. They
are destroyed by the usual strength of antiseptics,
such as hypochlorite, 1% ethanol, 2% formalde-
hyde, 5% hydrogen peroxide and 70% ethanol.
They are preserved at 70 C or in a lyophilised
state. They are preserved better in a special
medium known as SPG medium containing
sucrose, potassium phosphate and glutamate and
skimmed milk.
Antigenic Structure
Rickettsia possesses three different types of
antigens. The group-speciﬁc antigen is a soluble
antigen present on the surface of the Rickettsia.
This is extracted from rickettsial pathogens by
repeated washings and centrifugations. Species-
or strain-speciﬁc antigen is present in the
bacteria’s cell wall (e.g. scrub typhus). Alkali-
stable polysaccharide antigen is a surface anti-
gen found in some species of Rickettsia and some
strains of Proteus species (Proteus OX19, OX2
and OK). This sharing of antigen between Rick-
ettsia and Proteus forms the basis of the Weil–
Felix test, which is employed for the diagnosis of
rickettsial
infections
by
demonstration
of
antibodies using Proteus strains.
Pathogenesis
Virulence Factors
Multiplying inside the cell is an important mech-
anism of the disease process caused by rickettsial.
Adhesins are the most important virulent factor

of rickettsial pathogens. These are outer mem-
brane proteins, which facilitate the entry of
rickettsiae into the host cells. Once inside the
cells, they remain, multiply and accumulate in
large numbers before lysing the host cell.
Genus Rickettsia
643
After inoculation from the infected sites, the
rickettsiae reach the circulation, multiply and
cause rickettsemia. Rickettsiae are localised in
the endothelial cells of small arterial capillary
and venous vessels. At these sites, they multiply
and
cause
endothelial
cellular
hyperplasia
resulting in multiorgan vasculitis. The process
may end in thrombosis and the development of
small nodules. Thrombosis of supplying blood
vessels may cause gangrene of the extremities,
ear lobes, nose and genitalia. The vasculitis pro-
cess also may result in increased vascular perme-
ability with consequent oedema, loss of blood
volume,
hypoalbuminemia,
reduced
osmotic
pressure and hypotension.
Typhus Fever Group
Typhus refers to a group of infectious diseases
caused by different rickettsial organisms. These
are of three types: i) epidemic or louse-borne
typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii, ii)
relapsing louse-borne typhus or Brill–Zinsser dis-
ease caused by R. prowazekii and iii) endemic or
ﬂea-borne murine typhus caused by Rickettsia
typhi.
Epidemic or Louse-Borne Typhus
R. prowazekii is the causative agent of epidemic
or louse-borne typhus. This condition is an acute
febrile illness transmitted by the human body
louse
Pediculus
humanus
corporis.
R. prowazekii is named after the scientist Von
Prowazek who died of typhus fever while study-
ing the disease. This typhus fever is an ancient
disease reported from all parts of the world. This
disease was widely prevalent in Russia and East-
ern Europe. This disease was also responsible for
Napoleon’s defeat in Russia in 1812. This was
one of the three diseases responsible for misery
and
suffering
during
the
Irish
famine
of
1845–1850.
R. prowazekii is an invasive bacterium, which
characteristically multiplies in endothelial cells of
the blood vessels, leading to vasculitis. The incu-
bation period varies from as low as 2–3 days to an
average of 8 days.
Epidemic typhus is characterised by high
fever, severe headache and chills. The appearance
of a petechial or macular rash on the fourth or ﬁfth
day—ﬁrst starting on the trunk and then spread-
ing over to the extremities but without affecting
the face, palms and sole—is the characteristic
feature of the condition. The patient, if left
untreated, may become stuporous and delirious.
The name typhus is derived from the word typhus,
meaning cloud of smoke, which denotes a cloudy
state of consciousness in the disease process.
Myocarditis and central nervous system (CNS)
dysfunction are the noted complications of epi-
demic typhus. The disease is associated with a
mortality rate as high as 60% in old or debilitated
persons.
Epidemic typhus is present in Central and
South America, Africa (Ethiopia and Nigeria),
Northern China and India. Humans are the pri-
mary reservoir of the epidemic typhus and are the
sources of infection. The lice become infected
with R. prowazekii after feeding on a person
suffering from typhus fever or Brill–Zinsser dis-
ease. Body louse, P. humanus corporis, is the
arthropod vector of epidemic typhus. Occasion-
ally, the head louse P. humanus capitis may
transmit the infection, but not the pubic louse.
R. prowazekii, the causative agent of typhus,
lives and multiplies in the alimentary tract of the
louse. The bacteria are excreted in faeces within
3–5 days of infection. The lice are the only arthro-
pod vector for rickettsial infection, which die after
the infection (Fig. 44.1). Infection is transmitted
to humans when a rickettsia-harbouring louse
bites a human during a blood meal.
Typically, lice defecate while feeding. When
the host scratches the bite, the louse is crushed
and the contaminated louse faeces are inoculated
into the minute lesions of the bite wound. The
rickettsiae reach the circulation from the infected
sites, multiply and cause rickettsemia. Rarely, the

infection may also be transmitted through the
conjunctiva or inhalation of aerosols of dry
louse faeces.

Relapsing Louse-Borne Typhus
Relapsing louse-borne typhus or Brill–Zinsser
disease is an example of recrudescent typhus
fever. Brill ﬁrst noticed this disease in 1988, and
R. prowazekii were isolated from the areas in
1934. Hence, the disease is also called Brill–
Zinsser disease. The exact mechanism responsi-
ble for the recrudescence is not known. This
condition was seen in some patients treated with
antibiotics and has been apparently cured of the
disease. R. prowazekii in such patients may per-
sist in their body tissues, may re-emerge and
cause a recurrence of typhus fever months, years
or even decades after antibiotic treatment.
Endemic or Flea-Borne Murine Typhus
Endemic or ﬂea-borne murine typhus caused
by R. typhi is a milder disease than the epidemic
typhus and has a shorter duration. The incubation
period varies from 7 to 14 days. The condition has
a sudden onset of symptoms with fever, head-
ache, malaise and myalgia. A rash develops on
the third to the ﬁfth day of infection in approxi-
mately half of the infected patients. The rash is
typically present on the chest and abdomen but
may spread to the palms and soles. The untreated
course of the disease may last up to 3 weeks.
Endemic typhus occurs mainly in sporadic
forms. Rats (Rattus rattus), mice and cats are the
natural reservoirs of infection. Humans are the
accidental hosts. Rat ﬂea (Xenopsylla cheopis)
or cat ﬂea (Ctenocephalides felis) are the main
vectors responsible for disease transmission.
Endemic or ﬂea-borne murine typhus is transmit-
ted from rats to rats by a rat ﬂea and accidentally
to humans by the faeces of infected ﬂeas. Fleas
become infected by feeding on mice, cats or other
natural hosts. These infected ﬂeas may subse-
quently transmit the disease to humans during
the act of biting. During the bite, they transmit
the disease by direct inoculation or indirect inoc-
ulation of the infected faeces into the site of the
bite. The cat ﬂea C. felis may also transmit the
disease. The infection can also be transmitted by
inoculation or inhalation of aerosolised infectious
specimens. The infection may also be transmitted
by ingestion and food contaminated with infected
rat urine or ﬂea faeces.
Spotted Fever Group
Spotted
fever
group
of
rickettsial
diseases
includes (1) rocky mountain spotted fever caused
by Rickettsia rickettsiae, (2) rickettsial pox
caused by Rickettsia akari and (3) boutonneuse
fever (i.e. Kenya tick-bite fever, African tick
typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, Indian tick
typhus and Marseilles fever) caused by Rickettsia
conori
Rickettsiae of this group possess a common
soluble group antigen. They also multiply in the
nucleus and the cytoplasm of the infected cells.
All these species except R. akari are transmitted
by ticks. A total of 12 species of rickettsiae have
been associated with humans causing spotted
fever, and seven species have been isolated from
arthropod vectors. R. rickettsiae is the most com-
mon species belonging to the spotted fever group
and is responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted
fever.
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most serious
type of spotted fever. It was the ﬁrst among the
spotted fever group to be described. This disease
was earlier called Mediterranean disease and later
boutonneuse fever by Connor, who described this
condition for the ﬁrst time in 1910. Megaw, in

1917, ﬁrst described this disease in the foothills of
the Himalayas in India.
Genus Rickettsia
645
The incubation period is 7 days. The condition
is characterised by fever, severe headache, chills
and myalgia. A rash may develop after three or
more days and typically appears initially on the
wrist, ankles and palms and soles and then
spreads to the trunk. The rash is maculopapular
early in the disease but may later become pete-
chial and haemorrhagic. This is a serious disease
associated with many complications, such as
respiratory failure, encephalitis and renal failure.
The patient may die within 5 days of the onset of
symptoms.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is distributed in
southern Canada, Central America, Mexico and
South America. Ticks are the natural hosts,
reservoirs and vectors of R. rickettsiae. Different
tick hosts are associated with infection in differ-
ent parts of the world. These vectors include the
wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) in the west-
ern United States and western Canada, the Amer-
ican dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis) in eastern
Canada and the eastern United States and Lone
star tick (Amblyomma americanum) in the south-
western United States. Rickettsia multiply in
these ticks and are transmitted transovarially to
the next generation (Fig. 44.2).
R. rickettsiae is transmitted to humans through
saliva during the bite of a tick. It usually takes 6 h
of attachment and feeding before rickettsiae are
transmitted to the host. Infection can also be
transmitted
occasionally
by
scratching
and
rubbing
infectious
tick
faeces
into
the
abraded skin.

Rickettsial Pox
Rickettsial pox caused by R. akari is prevalent
worldwide. It has been reported in Russia,
South Africa and Korea. The common house
mouse (Mus musculus) is the natural reservoir.
R. akari is transmitted from mouse to mouse by
the bite of the mouse mite (Liponyssoides
sanguineus). The infection in the mite is transmit-
ted to the progeny transovarially (Fig. 44.3).
The incubation period is 7 days. The condition
manifests by the development of papule at the bite
site by the mite. Subsequently, the papule
progresses to an ulcer, leading to the formation
of eschar. This is followed by fever, headache,
malaise and myalgia in 3–10 days. A generalised
papular vesicular rash usually appears 3–4 days
after the emergence of fever. The illness lasts for a
short duration of 10–14 days, after which recov-
ery occurs. Complete healing of rash occurs
within 2–3 weeks without treatment.
Clinically rickettsial pox is a mild form of
infection. Like other rickettsial infections, diag-
nosis of the condition is clinically supported by
serology. This disease is differentiated from other
rickettsial infections by (1) the presence of an
eschar at the site of bite of mouse mite, (2) the
presence of a vesicular pustular eruption and
(3) a negative Weil–Felix reaction. Rodents are
the natural host of the mite transmitting rickettsial
pox in different parts of the world. Treatment with
doxycycline or chloramphenicol is highly effec-
tive for rickettsial pox infections.
Other Rickettsial Species in the Spotted
Fever Group
Six other rickettsial species in the spotted fever
group have been associated with human disease.
These

Australian tick typhus caused by Rickettsia
australis and Siberian tick typhus caused by Rick-
ettsia sibirica. All these rickettsial pathogens are
maintained in wild animals and ixodid ticks.
Humans are the accidental hosts. The clinical
diseases produced by these rickettsiae are similar
to the Rocky Mountain spotted fever but are

relatively milder. Indian tick typhus transmitted
by R. conori is a milder disease (Table 44.2).

Genus Orientia
Genus Orientia contains Orientia tsutsugamushi,
formerly known as Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, the
causative agent of scrub typhus.
The scrub typhus is transmitted to humans by
the mite Leptotrombidium akamushi and possibly
by Leptotrombidium deliense. Four stages of
development usually occur in the mite’s life
cycle. Of these stages, only the larval stage (chig-
ger) is infectious to humans and other mammals
because these stages require a blood meal for
further development. R. tsutsugamushi shows a
remarkable antigenic heterogeneity. Five major
serotypes are recognised. These are Karp, Gilliam
Kato Boryon and Kawazaki types. The organism
is transmitted to humans by chiggers that live and
reproduce in the soil and in the scrub vegetation
(this is called a zoonotic thread). The clearing of
forests has led to the spread of the disease to
urban areas of the country.
Scrub typhus is restricted in its geographical
distribution. The condition is present in the
Tsutsugamushi
triangle
of
western
Paciﬁc
regions, Australia and Eastern Asia. Once the
mice are infected, they act as a reservoir of
O.
tsutsugamushi.
Rats,
mice
and
larger
mammals are the usual hosts. Humans are the
accidental hosts. The mites feed on the blood of
animals only once during the development cycle;
hence they are not believed to be an important
reservoir for human diseases. The infection is
transmitted
from
rats
to
the
progeny
by
transovarial transmission.

Genus Ehrlichia
647
Scrub typhus is a mild and self-limiting dis-
ease but, if untreated, is fatal. The incubation
period, on average, varies from 10 to 12 days.
Usually, a characteristic eschar will develop at the
site of a mite bite, accompanied by regional
lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash. A
thorough physical examination is required to
identify
the
eschars.
Further,
the
condition
manifests with severe headache, fever, myalgia
and rash. The maculopapular rash develops
initially on the trunk and later on the limbs and
is present in nearly half of the patients. In
untreated
patients,
fever
disappears
after
2–3 weeks. Splenomegaly, CNS complications,
generalised lymphadenopathy and heart failure
are the condition’s complications.
Tetracyclines, doxycycline or chlorampheni-
col are highly effective in treating scrub typhus.
An effective vaccine is not available. Using insect
repellents and wearing protective clothing to
avoid exposure to chiggers prevent the disease.
Genus Ehrlichia
Ehrlichia are small, Gram-negative, obligate,
intracellular bacilli that parasitise mononuclear
and granulocytic phagocytes but not erythrocytes.
The bacteria multiply in the cytoplasm of infected
phagocytic cells as mulberry-like clusters called
the morula. The genus Ehrlichia consists of three
species that cause infections in humans. These are
(1) Ehrlichia sennetsu causing sennetsu fever,
(2) Ehrlichia chaffeensis causing monocytic ehr-
lichiosis and (3) Ehrlichia phagocytophila caus-
ing human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.
The genus Ehrlichia is named after the scien-
tist Paul Ehrlich. The ﬁrst case of Ehrlichia infec-
tion in humans was reported in Japan in 1954.
The cases resembled glandular fever with the
serum positive for antibodies against the agents
of
canine
ehrlichiosis.
The
causative
agent
isolated from the cases was named E. sennetsu.
Sennetsu is a Japanese word meaning glandular
fever. Ehrlichia species cause three clinical
syndromes, namely sennetsu fever, human mono-
cytic
ehrlichiosis
and
human
granulocytic
ehrlichiosis.
Sennetsu fever is caused by E. sennetsu. The
condition presents typically as an acute febrile
illness and resembles glandular fever. Cervical
lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytosis and
an increase in peripheral mononuclear cells are
the typical manifestations of the disease.
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by
E. chaffeensis, which infects mostly monocytes.
Human diseases are associated with headache,
malaise and myalgia after 1–3 weeks of a tick-
bite. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated
liver enzymes are other manifestations. A rash is
found in only 20% of the patients. Mortality due
to condition is less and is seen primarily in
patients with immunocompromised status and in
elderly patients.
Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is caused
by E. phagocytophila and Ehrlichia ewingii,
which infect mostly granulocytes. This condition
is characterised by a febrile illness with similar
manifestations to human monocytic ehrlichiosis.
The condition is associated with leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia, similar to that in human
monocytic ehrlichiosis.
Sennetsu fever is restricted to Japan. Human
monocytic ehrlichiosis is distributed mainly in the
south-eastern,
mid-Atlantic
and
south-central
parts of the United States. There are areas in
which
large
numbers
of
lone
star
ticks
(A. americanum) are found. Human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis is distributed in the Northeast and
Central Atlantic states and midwestern states of
the United States and Europe. Reservoirs are not
known for sennetsu fever. It is an exception,
which is transmitted by ingestion of raw ﬁsh
infected with ﬂukes but not by ticks.
Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease. Ticks are
the vectors for all Ehrlichia species causing
diseases in humans and animals. White tick deer
and
domestic
dogs
are
reservoirs
for
E. chaffeensis, the lone star (A. americanum)
tick that transmits the bacteria. Dogs are the
vectors for E. ewingii. The lone star tick also
transmits the infection. Small mammals, such as
white-footed mice, chipmunks and whorls, are the
reservoirs for E. phagocytophila. Ixodes species,
including Ixodes capillaris, Ixodes ricinus and
Ixodes paciﬁcus are the vectors for the pathogen.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Rickettsia,
Orientia and Ehrlichia Infections
Laboratory diagnosis is made either by isolation
of rickettsia or by serological tests.
Specimens
These include blood and tissue samples for cul-
ture and serum for serological tests.
Microscopy
Cytoplasmic
inclusion
bodies
in
rickettsial
infections can be demonstrated by microscopy.
They are stained well with the following stains:
deep red with Machiavello and Gimenez stain and
bluish-purple with Giemsa and Castaneda stain.
Morula forms are demonstrated in infected
phagocytic cells stained by Giemsa stain in
ehrlichiosis.
Culture
Rickettsiae
are
highly
infectious
pathogens;
therefore, isolation of these pathogens from clini-
cal specimens is carried out only in the BSL III
safety laboratory equipped with high safety
provisions.
Animal Inoculation
Rickettsiae isolation is carried out in male
guinea pigs or mice by inoculating the clinical
specimen intraperitoneally. After inoculation, the
animals
are
observed
for
3–4
weeks.
The
response
of
animals
to
different
rickettsial
infections may vary. R. prowazekii infection
produces fever without any testicular inﬂamma-
tion. Infection with R. typhi, R. conori and
R. akari develops fever and tunica reaction. Rick-
ettsia causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever
causes fever and scrotal necrosis in guinea pigs.
The guinea pigs may even die of the disease.
Smears from the infected animals’ peritoneum,
tunica and spleen may be stained by Giemsa and
Gimenez methods to detect these pathogens.
R. typhi is differentiated from R. prowazekii by
Neil Mooser reaction and partial DNA homol-
ogy. Neil Mooser or tunica reaction is performed
in an adult male guinea pig. The specimens
(e.g. blood from the case of endemic typhus or
R. typhi culture) are inoculated intraperitoneally.
An inoculated animal is observed for the devel-
opment of fever and a characteristic scrotal
inﬂammation. In a positive test, the scrotum
becomes enlarged and the testis cannot be pushed
back into the layer of tunica vaginalis. This reac-
tion is known as Neil Mooser or tunica vaginalis
reaction. R. typhi shows a positive Neil Mooser
reaction. R. prowazekii shows a negative Neil
Mooser reaction.
Rickettsiae may be isolated by growing in the
cell culture. They grow better on Vero cells in
three
and
half
days.
Immunoﬂuorescence
identiﬁes the rickettsiae in these infected cell
lines using group-speciﬁc and strain-speciﬁc
monoclonal antibodies.
Serology

test used for a long to diagnose rickettsial

infections.
The
test
detects
anti-rickettsial
antibodies that cross-react with O antigens of
certain non-motile strains of Proteus. In this test,
non-motile strains of Proteus vulgaris OX19 and
OX2 and Proteus mirabilis OXK are used as
antigens. The Weil–Felix test becomes positive
10–20 days after infection; sera from epidemic
typhus strongly react with OX19 antigen and
weakly agglutinate with OX2 antigen. They do
not agglutinate with OXK antigen. Weil–Felix
test is negative or weakly reactive in Brill–Zinsser
disease. Reactions of the Weil–Felix test in other
rickettsial
infections
are
summarised
in
Table 44.4.

agglutination and enzyme immunoassay are the
other serological tests used to diagnose rickett-
sial infections, including R. prowazekii. These
tests employ rickettsial antigens for the demon-
stration of rickettsial antibodies. IFA test using
R. typhi-speciﬁc antigen is employed as a speciﬁc
test for serodiagnosis of endemic typhus. A single
titre of 1:128 or a fourfold rise in antibody titre in
paired sera is diagnostic of the disease. It is con-
sidered the gold standard.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect
rickettsia in blood or tissue for early diagnosis of
the condition.
Treatment
Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are the drugs
of choice to treat epidemic typhus. Antibiotic
therapy in combination with the treatment of
louse infestation of the human host is effective.
Tetracyclines,
chloramphenicol
and
ﬂuoroquinolones, such as ciproﬂoxacin, are effec-
tive against R. rickettsiae. Doxycycline is the
drug of choice for the treatment of human ehrlich-
iosis. Chloramphenicol and ﬂuoroquinolones are
not that effective.
Prevention and Control
Control of the human lice population and sanita-
tion is the effective measures to control epidemic
typhus. Control of endemic typhus is difﬁcult
because
the
ﬂeas
causing
the
disease
are
distributed widely. The control measures are
essentially based on the control of the rodent
and ﬂea populations in the area endemic to the
disease. The use of protective clothing and insect
repellents and avoidance of tick-infested areas are
the preventive measures against R. rickettsiae
infection. No vaccine is available against the
Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Use of insect
repellents, wearing protective clothing, etc. are
preventive measures against bites by ticks. A
live vaccine containing the attenuated ‘E’ strain
of R. prowazekii is available and is recommended
for use in a high-risk population.
Genus Coxiella
The genus Coxiella was originally classiﬁed with
rickettsia because the bacteria showed features of
a rickettsial pathogen. Like rickettsiae, they
(1) stain poorly with Gram staining, (2) multiply
intracellularly in eukaryotic cells and (3) are
transmitted by arthropods. Coxiella differs from

n
rickettsiae by being not transmitted by arthropod
vectors but are transmitted by inhalation or inges-
tion. They show relatively more resistance to the
actions of dry heat.
650
44
Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia and Coxiella
The genus Coxiella now has been separated
from rickettsiae and is placed in the group
Protobacteria along with other genera, such as
Legionella and Francisella. This is because
Coxiella was more closely related to these two
genera. The genus Coxiella includes the species
C. burnetii, which causes Q fever (Table 44.4).
Coxiella burnetii
C. burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever, a
zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to
humans. Q fever was ﬁrst studied in an experi-
mental infection of guinea pigs by inoculation of
blood from patients suffering from typhus-like
fever to guinea pigs by Derrick in 1935. As the
etiological agent of the disease was not known,
the condition was referred to as query or Q fever.
Subsequently, Burnett identiﬁed the causative
agent as a rickettsial, after which the pathogen
was named Rickettsia burnetii. Cox in the United
States demonstrated the agent in ticks and named
it Rickettsia diaphorica. Later, both the rickettsial
strains were shown to be identical. The organism
is now named C. burnetii and reclassiﬁed in the
group Proteobacteria.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C. burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium.
It is pleomorphic and measures 1  0.3 μm i
size. The bacterium is Gram-negative but stains
poorly with Gram staining. These bacteria, like
other rickettsiae, stain best with Giemsa or
Gimenez stains.
Culture
C. burnetii primarily infects the monocytic mac-
rophage cell. It multiplies in phagolysosomes of
the infected cell. It grows well in various cell lines
and the yolk sac.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Coxiella is the most resistant pathogen to heat and
dryness. They are not completely killed at 60 C
or by 1% phenol in 60 min. Hence, pasteurisation
by holding method is not effective for killing
C. burnetii, but the ﬂash method of pasteurisation
is effective. The bacteria survive for a month in
meat and a year or more in dried faeces at 4 C.
Antigenic Structure
Phase
variation:
Characteristically, Coxiella
exists antigenically in two forms: phase 1 antigen
and phase 2 antigen. Phase 1 antigen is a cell
wall LPS antigen with a complex carbohydrate
structure. This antigen usually prevents the inter-
action of antibodies with surface protein. Coxiella
in phase 1 antigen is highly infectious. Phase 1 is
highly immunogenic and elicits a strong antibody
response to both 1 and 2 antigens. Phase 2 anti-
gen occurs by following repeated passage in the
yolk sac in which the LPS is modiﬁed by expos-
ing the surface proteins to antibodies. In this
phase,
the
surface
proteins
act
with
host
antibodies. Coxiella occurring in phase 2 is a
less infective form of the bacterium.
C. burnetii either in phase 1 or phase 2 does not
show any antigenic sharing with rickettsia or Pro-
teus bacillus antigen. Therefore, the Weil–Felix
test is not useful for detecting C. burnetii infec-
tion. The antibodies in serum of Q fever do not
react with Proteus antigens used in the Weil–Felix
properties stage of Q fever is characterised by the
presence of antibody titres against phase 2 antigen.
In contrast, chronic disease is characterised by the
presence of antibodies against both phase 1 and
phase 2 antigens. These high titres of antibodies
appear to be responsible for pathological changes
in various organs during the disease. Cell-
mediated immunity is associated with recovery
from clinical illness.

Coxiella burnetii
651
Pathogenesis
C.
burnetii
causes
infection
by
penetrating
abraded skin, mucosa, lung or intestinal tract.
They typically grow and multiply in the acidic
environment of fused phagosome and lysosome.
Phase 1 form of C. burnetii is protected from the
action of antibodies.
Coxiella affects lungs and heart valves and has
also been found in macrophages in the lungs and
vegetations of heart valves. The bacteria also
cause granulomatous changes in reticuloendothe-
lial organs, such as the liver, spleen, etc. Host-
mediated pathogenic mechanisms are believed to
play an important role in the pathogenesis of Q
fever.
Clinical Syndromes
C. burnetii causes Q fever, which can occur in
acute or chronic forms.
Q Fever
The incubation period is 20 days. The acute stage
of Q fever manifests as sudden onset of severe
headache, high fever, chills and myalgia. The
bacteria produce a respiratory infection mimick-
ing
atypical
pneumonia.
They
also
cause
hepatosplenomegaly, which is found in approxi-
mately half of the patients.
The chronic form of Q fever has a long incu-
bation period varying from months to years. The
onset
of
the
disease
is
usually
insidious.
Sub-acute endocarditis on a previously damaged
heart valve or a prosthetic heart valve is the most
common manifestation of the condition. Hepatitis
and
meningoencephalitis
are
the
other
manifestations of the disease. Uncomplicated
acute disease is a self-limiting disease that lasts
for 1–2 years. Complications of chronic diseases
may increase the mortality rate.
Laboratory Diagnosis
C. burnetii can be diagnosed by isolating the
bacteria from clinical specimens in guinea pigs,
mice and developing chick embryos. But the iso-
lation of the bacteria by these methods is not
attempted because these procedures are biohaz-
ardous and are also not required.
Serology
Serology is the mainstay of diagnosis of Q fever.
Serological tests include immunoﬂuorescence
test, complement ﬁxation test and ELISA. These
tests detect IgM or IgG antibodies by using phase
1 and 2 antigens.
Serodiagnosis of acute Q fever is made by
demonstration of (1) IgG titre of 1:200 or more,
or IgM titre of 1:50 or more in a single serum
specimen or (2) a fourfold rise of antibody titre
between acute and convalescent sera. The IgG
antibodies are present in serum for more than
1 year in 90% of patients, whereas IgM antibodies
are present only for 2 weeks and become negative
after 2 weeks. Serodiagnosis of chronic Q fever is
made by demonstrating
high antibody titre
against phase 1 and 2 antigens. Antibodies
against phase 1 antigen are always higher. Weil–
Felix test is not used for the diagnosis of Q fever.
Molecular Diagnosis.
Molecular Detection
PCR is currently evaluated to detect C. burnetii in
clinical specimens; however, it still remains to be
a research tool and is not widely used in the
diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment with tetracyclines, such as doxycy-
cline, is effective for acute Q fever. A combina-
tion
of
tetracycline
and
cotrimoxazole
or
rifampicin for a prolonged period is essential for
treating sub-acute endocarditis and other chronic
diseases caused by C. burnetii.
Epidemiology
Like other human rickettsial infections, Q fever is
a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected
animals to humans.

652

Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia and Coxiella
Geographical Distribution
C. burnetii infection is common in domestic live-
stock in many parts of the world. C. burnetii
infection
in
birds
and
animals
has
been
documented by serological studies. Sporadic
cases of human infections have been reported.
Habitat
C. burnetii are intracellular pathogens in infected
livestock and also in humans.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Q fever is a zoonosis distributed worldwide. Farm
animals, such as sheep, cattle and goats, and cats,
dogs and rabbits are the primary reservoirs of
infection. Ixodid ticks are responsible for trans-
mitting the disease to rodents and domestic
animals and for maintaining infection in these
animals.
C. burnetii infection in ticks is transmitted
transovarially to progeny. Coxiella are excreted
in the faeces and survive in dried faeces for a long
time. In infected animals, Coxiella are excreted in
the milk and particularly in their products of
conception during parturition of these animals.
These bacteria contaminate the animals’ sur-
roundings, where they remain as a potential
source of infection to humans for months. Ticks
do not play any role in transmitting Q fever from
infected animals to humans. Humans acquire
diseases by inhalation of infected aerosols. They
also possibly acquire the disease from milk
consumption infected with C. burnetii. Person-
to-person transmission does not occur.
Prevention and Control
Preventive measures for Q fever include (1) wear-
ing protective clothing (mask, gloves) while
handling
carcasses
and
animal
hides,
(2) pasteurisation of milk by the ﬂash method
instead of the holder method and (3) isolation of
facilities for the parturition of animals.
Case Study
A 30-year-old farmer from Himachal Pradesh
attended the Medicine OPD with symptoms of
fever, headache and appearance of rashes over
the body’s surface. He gave the history that the
rash appeared on the ﬁfth day of the fever, which
ﬁrst appeared on the trunk and then spread to the
extremities. On examination, the rashes were
found to be maculopapular. These rashes were
not found on the face, palm and sole. Serum was
sent for febrile agglutination tests. Widal and
standard agglutination tests for brucellosis were
negative. Paul–Bunnell’s test was also negative.
ELISA for HIV was also negative. Weil–Felix
test showed agglutination with OX19 and OX2
but not with OXK.

Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma
45
Mycoplasma belongs to class Mollicutes (Mollis,
soft; cutis, skin) and order Mycoplasmatales. The
family
Mycoplasmataceae
includes
parasite
mycoplasmas, which require cholesterol or other
sterols as growth factors. It consists of two
genera—Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. At least
13
species
of
genera,
Mycoplasma
and
Ureaplasma, are known to colonise or cause
diseases in humans (Table 45.1).
Genus Mycoplasma
Mycoplasmas,
previously
known
as
‘Eaton
agent’,
Pleuro-Pneumonia-like
Organisms
(PPLO), are prokaryotes. However, they differ
from prokaryotes by having a unique cell mem-
brane that contains sterols. Also, mycoplasmas do
not have a cell wall. Mycoplasma pathogens,
when ﬁrst discovered, were thought to be viruses
or L-forms of bacteria. Mycoplasma species were
also considered an L-form of bacteria because
they lack a cell wall. However, they differ from
bacteria, including L-forms, in many properties.
They (1) have sterols in the cell membrane, (2) do
not show any reversion to structure with cell
walls, (3) do not share any DNA homology with
other bacteriomes, (4) have a genome with low
molecular weight and (5) have low guanine and
cytosine contents. The absence of a cell wall
makes
Mycoplasma
resistant
to
penicillin,
cephalosporins, vancomycin and other antibiotics
that interfere with the synthesis of the cell wall.

The genus Mycoplasma contains pathogens
that use glucose or arginine but do not utilise
urea. The genus contains 200 validly published
species. These species occur as commensals,
parasites and pathogens of various plant insects
and mammalian hosts. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
is the most important species known to cause
upper respiratory tract disease. It is also known
for causing walking pneumonia or primary atypi-
cal pneumonia. Mycoplasma hominis, Myco-
plasma
fermentans,
Mycoplasma
pirum,
Mycoplasma salivarium, Mycoplasma orale and
Mycoplasma genitalium are the other pathogens
commonly associated with human infections.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
Mycoplasmas are very small bacteria measuring
150–250 nm in dimension. They do not have a
cell wall, and typically, their cell membranes
contain sterols. Many mycoplasmas can pass
through a 0.45-μm ﬁlter and were once believed
to be viruses. However, they differ from viruses
because they (1) contain both ribonucleic acid
(RNA)
and
deoxyribonucleic
acid
(DNA),
(2) can grow on cell-free media in vitro and
(3) show both intracellular and extracellular para-
sitism in vivo.
Mycoplasma species typically show pleomor-
phism and occur as granular ﬁlaments of various
sizes. The ﬁlaments are slender of varying lengths

and show true branching. They multiply by
binary ﬁssion. However, genomic replication
and
cell
division
are
often
asynchronous,
resulting in the production of multi-nucleate
fragments and other body forms and chains of
beads. They do not possess ﬂagella or pili, but
some
Mycoplasma
species,
including
M. pneumoniae, show gliding motility on liquid-
covered surfaces. Mycoplasma stain poorly by
Gram stain and are Gram negative. They are
better stained by Giemsa and Diene stain.

Culture and Biochemical Properties
Mycoplasmas
are
aerobic
and
facultative
anaerobes. M. pneumoniae is an exception,
which is a strict aerobe. They grow at 37 C and
a pH range of 7.3–7.8.
Pleuropneumonia-like
organism
(PPLO)
broth is a medium widely used to isolate
mycoplasma. This medium is supplemented with
20% horse serum, 10% yeast extract and glucose.
Phenol red is used as a pH indicator. The high
concentration of animal serum (horse serum) is
used as a source of exogenous sterols (cholesterol
and other lipids). The medium is supplemented with
penicillin, ampicillin and polymyxin B to inhibit the
growth of contaminating bacteria. Amphotericin B
is used to inhibit contamination with fungi.
PPLO agar is made by the addition of agar in
the PPLO broth. The mycoplasmas are typically
slow growers with a 1–6 h of generation time.
Mycoplasmas on PPLO agar produce small
colonies, typically described as a fried-egg
appearance. This consists of a central, opaque,
granular growth area surrounded by a ﬂat, trans-
lucent, peripheral area. Initially, the mycoplasmas
multiply within the agar to produce opaque, ball-
shaped colonies that grow up to the surface of the
agar and then spread around it, forming a translu-
cent peripheral zone (Fig. 45.1). M. pneumoniae

does not produce fried-egg appearance colonies
but instead produces colonies, known as mul-
berry-shaped colonies. These colonies do not
show any thin hallow, unlike that of fried-egg
appearance colonies.
Genus Mycoplasma
655
M. pneumoniae are very slow-growing bacte-
ria. They require 1–4 weeks to produce colonies
on agar. Most Mycoplasma colonies produce a
zone of haemolysis on blood agar. Mycoplasmas
do not have the capability to synthesise choles-
terol and related sterols; hence these are supplied
from outside for the growth of mycoplasmas.
They also lack the ability to synthesise purines
and pyrimidines.
M.
pneumoniae
and
other
species
(M. fermentans, M. genitalia and M. agalactiae)
utilise glucose and other carbohydrates as the
major energy source. M. salivarium and other
species
(M.
orale,
M.
hominis
and
M. fermentans) utilise arginine as a major energy
source. Mycoplasma are chemo-organotrophs,
the metabolism being mainly fermentative.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Mycoplasmas are readily killed by heating at
56 C for 30 min. The bacteria are sensitive to
antiseptic solutions, such as cycloheximide and
cetrimide, which inhibit their growth. They are
resistant to UV light and the photodynamic action
of methylene blue. Hence, M. pneumoniae can
grow in the presence of 0.002% of methylene
blue in agar, while many other Mycoplasma spe-
cies are inhibited at this concentration.
Immunity
Membrane glycolipids and proteins are the major
antigenic determinants of mycoplasmas. Mem-
brane glycolipid antigens show cross-reaction
with
human
tissues
and
other
bacteria.
Glycolipids with similar antigenic structures
have been demonstrated in neurons in the
human
brain.
The
antibodies
against
M. pneumoniae glycolipid may cross-react with
brain cells, causing damage to neuronal cells.
This cell damage possibly is responsible for neu-
rological
manifestations
of
M.
pneumoniae
infection.
M. pneumoniae possesses multiple surface
proteins like P1, P30 and P116, which are respon-
sible for the attachment of bacteria to cell
structures. The P1 protein is the major adhesin
and immunogenic protein present on the attach-
ment organelle of M. pneumoniae. The P1 protein
induces the production of antibodies, which not
only react with P1 protein but also react with
antigenic determinants of RBCs, leading to lysis
of
erythrocytes
in
the
autoimmune
disease
process.
Pathogenesis
Mycoplasmas
are
primarily
extracellular
pathogens.
Virulence Factors
The adhesion protein called P1 antigen is the key
virulence
factor
of
mycoplasma.
It
is
a
membrane-associated protein that helps in the
adhesion of mycoplasmas to epithelial cells.
This protein or adhesin combines speciﬁcally
with sialated glycoprotein receptors present at
the base of the cilia on the epithelial surface.
This same receptor is also present on the surface
of the erythrocytes. The antibodies against the P1
antigen can also act as an autoantibody against
RBCs, causing agglutination.
Pathogenesis of Respiratory Infections
Mycoplasmas adhere to the surface of ciliated and
non-ciliated epithelial cells. Following attach-
ment, Mycoplasma causes direct damage to the
epithelial cells in which ﬁrst cilia and then ciliated
epithelial cells are destroyed. Loss of the cells
interferes with the normal functioning of the
upper respiratory tract. This results in the lower
respiratory tract becoming infected with microbes
and mechanically irritated. The mechanical irrita-
tion causes persistent cough, typically seen in

patients with respiratory infection caused by
M. pneumoniae.
656
45
Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma
M. pneumoniae behaves as a superantigen. This
causes migration of inﬂammatory cells to the
site of infection and produces cytokines, such
as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 and
interleukin-6. These cytokines help in clearing the
bacteria and the disease. The bacteria usually do not
cause invasion of the blood to produce a systemic
manifestation of the disease. Mycoplasma rarely
penetrates the submucosa except in rare cases of
immunosuppression or following instrumentation.
Under these conditions, they may invade the blood-
stream and cause infection in different body organs.
Clinical Syndromes
M. pneumoniae primarily causes respiratory
infections in humans.
Respiratory Infections
A majority of respiratory infections are mild and
self-limiting.
M. pneumoniae typically causes mild upper
respiratory tract infections. The condition is
characterised by low-grade fever, malaise and
headache. A non-productive cough is a typical
manifestation, which appears 2–3 weeks after
exposure. The cough is initially non-productive
but may later produce small to moderated
quantities
of
sputum,
which
may
become
mucopurulent and even blood-tinged in more
severe cases.

M. hominis

Male
Female
Lower respiratory tract infections include
tracheobronchitis and bronchopneumonia. The
condition is characterised by primary infection
of bronchi with inﬁltration of bronchial epithelial
cells by lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Primary atypical pneumonia is also known
as walking pneumonia. The incubation period
varies from 2 to 3 weeks. Patients suffering
from atypical pneumonia usually do not appear
ill. Hence, the illness is often referred to as walk-
ing pneumonia. The pharynx affected becomes
oedematous but without any cervical adenopathy.
The condition is associated with the presence of
patchy bronchopneumonia seen on the chest
X-ray. The disparity between physical ﬁndings
and radiological evidence of the chest is the
hallmark of infection. The infection is usually
self-limiting. In 5–20% of patients, pleural effu-
sion may occur.
Extrapulmonary Infections
Extrapulmonary manifestations are not rare. Car-
diac abnormalities, such as myocarditis and peri-
carditis,
are
the
most
frequently
reported
extrapulmonary
manifestations.
Other
manifestations
include
neurological
abnormalities, otitis media and erythema multi-
forme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) (Fig. 45.2).

Genus Mycoplasma
657
Laboratory Diagnosis
Initial treatment of M. pneumoniae infection is
based on the clinical diagnosis of the condition.
The deﬁnite diagnosis of the condition usually
takes 3–4 weeks. Hence, treatment is started with-
out waiting for the result of laboratory tests.
Specimens
Respiratory
specimens
include
bronchial
washings, throat washings and expectorated spu-
tum. Tracheal washings are more useful than
sputum specimens. This is because most patients
with respiratory tract infections do not produce
any
sputum
as
they
have
a
dry
and
non-productive cough.
The specimens are collected and transported to
the
laboratory
immediately.
If
a
delay
is
anticipated, they are usually inoculated in suitable
transport media, such as SP4 transport medium,
to prevent desiccation. The specimens can be
stored at 70 C if these cannot be sent immedi-
ately to the laboratory after collection.
Microscopy
Microscopy is of no value in the diagnosis of
M. pneumoniae infections. Mycoplasmas are
stained poorly because they lack cell walls.
Direct Antigen Detection
Antigen capture immunoassay has been used to
directly
detect
M.
pneumoniae
in
sputum
specimens with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Direct immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblotting
with monoclonal antibodies are also used to
detect antigens in clinical specimens.
Culture and Identification
Bacterial culture is of little practical value
because of its fastidious growth requirements
and the need for 3–4 weeks for culture. Isolation
of M. pneumoniae from clinical specimens by
culture
conﬁrms
the
diagnosis
of
M.
pneumoniae
respiratory
illness.
The
specimens are inoculated into a mycoplasma
medium, such as PPLO agar. M. pneumoniae
grows very slowly on this medium, and colonies
are demonstrated at 37
C. The growth is
facilitated by incubation in the presence of 95%
of N2 and 5% of CO2. The bacteria produce small
colonies with a homogenous appearance, typi-
cally described as mulberry-shaped colonies.
On
agar,
mycoplasmas
other
than
M. pneumoniae produce fried-egg appearance
colonies with an opaque central zone of growth
within the agar and a translucent peripheral zone
on the surface.
Suspected
M.
pneumoniae
colonies
are
identiﬁed by colony characters and a battery of
tests. Microscopy reveals very small bacteria,
poorly stained with Gram stain but stain well
with Diene stain.
The colonies are identiﬁed by noting a colour
change from red to yellow of phenol red due to
fermentation of glucose resulting in the produc-
tion of acid, which makes the pH of the media
acidic.
Mycoplasma colonies are identiﬁed by the
Diene test. In this method, the Diene stain
(diluted 1:10 with distilled water) is added
directly to the plate containing suspected colonies
of Mycoplasma. The plate is then immediately
rinsed with distilled water to remove the stain.
This is followed by decolourising the medium by
adding 1 mL of 95% ethanol and keeping it for
1 min. The plate is re-washed with distilled water
and is allowed to dry. After drying, the colonies
are observed under the low power of the
microscope.
By Diene staining, the fried-egg appearance
colonies of Mycoplasma appear highly granular.
The centre of the colonies is stained dark blue, and
the periphery of the colonies staining light blue.
The agar in the medium appears clear or slightly
violet. Mycoplasma other than M. pneumoniae
becomes colourless after some time because it
reduces
the
methylene
blue.
The
identiﬁed
colonies are conﬁrmed by inhibiting their growth
with speciﬁc M. pneumoniae antisera.
M. pneumoniae colonies are identiﬁed by a
positive
hemadsorption
test.
The
test
is
performed by ﬂooding M. pneumoniae colonies
grown on the surface of agar with 2 mL of
0.2–0.4% suspension of guinea pig erythrocytes


in Mycoplasma growth medium. The plate is
incubated at 35 C for 35 min followed by wash-
ing with 3 mL of Mycoplasma growth medium.
The washing ﬂuid is gently removed by aspiration
with a pipette. M. pneumoniae colonies adsorb
guinea pig erythrocytes, which is facilitated at
37
C.
M.
pneumoniae
colonies
adsorbing
erythrocytes on their surface are demonstrated
under the 40
magniﬁcation of the microscope.
658
45
Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma
Colonies are also positive for the tetrazolium
reduction test. The test is based on the principle
that M. pneumoniae can reduce triphenyl tetrazo-
lium, a colourless compound, to formazan, a
red-coloured compound. This test is performed
by ﬂooding the colonies of M. pneumoniae on
agar
with
a
solution
of
2-p-iodophenyl-3-
nitrophenyl-5-phenyltetrazolium
chloride
and
incubating it at 35 C for an hour. In a positive
test, M. pneumoniae colonies appear reddish after
1 h and may appear purple to black after 3–4 h of
incubation.
Serology
Serodiagnosis is based on demonstrating speciﬁc
antibodies in serum using Mycoplasma antigens.
M. pneumoniae glycolipid antigen extracted by
chloroform and methanol is also widely used for
serodiagnosis of atypical pneumonia. Comple-
ment ﬁxation test and ELISA are the tests fre-
quently used. IgM ELISA is the most frequently
used test to detect speciﬁc IgM antibodies in a
single-serum specimen.
Non-specific Serological Tests
These tests are called non-speciﬁc because they
do not use speciﬁc Mycoplasma antigens; instead,
they use cross-reacting and non-speciﬁc antigens.
These tests include the Streptococcus MG agglu-
tination test and the cold agglutination test.
Streptococcus MG agglutination test uses a
heat-killed suspension of Streptococcus MG as an
antigen. The antigen is mixed with serial dilution
of the patient’s unheated serum. The agglutina-
tion is observed after overnight incubation at
37 C. An antibody titre of 1:20 or more is sug-
gestive of M. pneumoniae infection.
Cold agglutination test is based on the princi-
ple that autoantibodies that agglutinate human O
group cells at low temperatures appear in most
cases of atypical pneumonia. In this test, human
O group erythrocytes are used as antigens. The
patient’s blood, which is collected for testing,
should never be refrigerated before the separation
of serum because homologous RBCs readily
absorb agglutinins at low temperatures. The
patient’s serum is mixed with an equal volume of
0.2% washed suspension of human O erythrocytes.
The suspension is incubated at 4 C overnight and
observed
for
clumping.
The
clumping
is
disassociated at 37 C. The titre of 1:32 or more
is suggestive of M. pneumoniae infection. A four-
fold rise in cold agglutinin titre of the paired serum
and convalescent sera or a single titre of 1:32 is
suggestive of M. pneumoniae infection.
Cold agglutinins usually appear by the second
week of infection and peak at 4–5 weeks. After
that, the antibody titre declines rapidly, and the
test becomes negative in about 5 months. Since
the test is non-speciﬁc, it shows false-positive
reactions in sera of other diseases, such as rubella,
infectious mononucleosis, adenovirus infections,
psittacosis, tropical eosinophilia trypanosomiasis,
cirrhosis of the liver and haemolytic anaemia.
Molecular Detection
A semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay using 60S ribosomal DNA has been devel-
oped to demonstrate P1 adhesin in protein for
diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection. These tests
are of high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. They have
added advantage of detecting M. pneumoniae
infections at an early stage.
With time, convention PCR has been replaced
by numerous real-time PCR assays for research
and diagnostic purposes. The predominant real-
time PCR assay is based on the TaqMan® probe,
and common target genes are 16S rRNA, the P1
gene or the ATPase operon. More recently, the
gene encoding the community-acquired respira-
tory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin has been
identiﬁed as a potential target for detection.

Genital Mycoplasma Infections
659
Treatment
M.
pneumoniae
remains
susceptible
to
tetracyclines and erythromycin because these
antibiotics act on the mycoplasmas by inhibiting
protein synthesis. Tetracycline has the additional
advantage of also being active against most other
mycoplasmas
and
chlamydiae,
the
common
causes of non-gonococcal urethritis. Mycoplasma
is resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins
because these antibiotics act on the cell wall,
which is lacking in mycoplasmas (L-forms).
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
M. pneumoniae infection is distributed world-
wide. The organism is responsible for up to 20%
of
community-acquired
pneumonia,
which
requires hospitalisation. M. pneumoniae infection
occurs both in epidemic and in endemic forms.
Habitat
M. pneumoniae is a strict human pathogen. The
bacteria inhabit the upper respiratory tract in an
infected host. They are usually present in the
mucosa, residing extracellularly on the upper
respiratory tract.
Reservoir, Host and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are the usual host of M. pneumoniae and
thus a signiﬁcant reservoir of infection. Patients
with active infection are more likely to transmit
M. pneumoniae infection. M. pneumoniae is most
commonly transmitted by close contact through
nasal secretions. The infection is transmitted by
inhalation
of
aerosolised
droplets.
M. pneumoniae is usually associated with pneu-
monia, and the highest rate of infection is found in
children between 9 and 10 years and young
adults. Infection is common among school-
going children.
The
infection
is
also
being
increasingly
documented in people older than 65 years in
recent
years.
In
the
old
population,
M. pneumoniae is responsible for causing nearly
15% of community-acquired pneumonia and is
the second pathogen next to Streptococcus
pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia.
Prevention and Control
Isolation
of
the
patients
infected
with
M. pneumoniae is the best way to prevent the
spread of the disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis
with tetracyclines or erythromycin is also useful.
No vaccine is available against Mycoplasma
infections.
Genital Mycoplasma Infections
M. hominis and M. genitalium are the genital
Mycoplasma species that inhabit the mucosa of
the urogenital tract.
M. hominis is associated with infection of the
genitourinary tract and reproductive disease. It
causes genital infection, resulting in diverse
manifestations,
such
as
salpingitis,
pelvic
abscess, puerperal infection and septic abortion.
M. hominis typically produces large fried-egg
appearance colonies on mycoplasma medium.
Inhibition of the growth of the bacteria with spe-
ciﬁc antisera to M. hominis is used to differentiate
it from another genital mycoplasma. M. hominis
organisms, unlike other mycoplasmas, are resis-
tant
to
erythromycin
and
occasionally
to
tetracyclines. Clindamycin is useful to treat
infections caused by such resistant strains of
M. hominis. M. genitalis is another species that
has
also
been
implicated
as
a
cause
of
non-gonococcal urethritis and pelvic inﬂamma-
tory disease (PID).
The colonisation of infants by Mycoplasma
species usually occurs during the baby’s passage
through the birth canal. Colonisation with these
genital mycoplasmas occurs only for up to
2 years. Since genital mycoplasmas have been
transmitted sexually, avoidance of sexual activity
or the use of proper safety procedures prevents
the disease caused by these genital mycoplasmas.

Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma
Mycoplasmas and L-Forms in Bacteria
In 1935, the ﬁrst pleuropneumonia-like forms
were recovered from Streptobacillus moniliformis
cultures by Klieneberger, and it was designated as
L-forms after Lister Institute, London, where the
discovery was made. Later, it was shown that
many of the bacteria lose their cell wall and
develop into L-forms either spontaneously or
induced by certain substances such as penicillin.
Two types of L-forms are unstable- L-forms that
are capable of dividing but can revert to the origi-
nal morphology, and stable L-forms that are
unable to revert to the original bacteria, but they
continue in the cell wall-deﬁcient state perma-
nently. These cell wall-deﬁcient forms (L-forms,
protoplasts, spheroplasts) cannot initiate disease.
They may help in bacterial persistence and
subsequent recurrence of infection during antibi-
otic therapy. Mycoplasmas may represent stable
L-forms of bacteria. However, the antigenic,
genetic and biochemical evidence are against
this possibility.
Mycoplasmas as Cell Culture
Contaminants
Different species of mycoplasma are often found
in research laboratories as contaminants in con-
tinuous cell culture. The mycoplasmal cell culture
contamination occurs from individual workers or
animal sera or contaminated cell culture medium
ingredients such as trypsin. Generally, the con-
tamination does not produce destruction of cell
lines but might affect the growth of the desired
viruses, and it may lead to wrong interpretation of
results. Most of the time, mycoplasmas in cell
cultures have often been mistaken for viruses. It
is very difﬁcult to eradicate the mycoplasma con-
tamination of cell line cultures. Desirably a
change of cell line is the best solution.
Genus Ureaplasma
Genus Ureaplasma consists of ﬁve species, of
which Ureaplasma urealyticum is the most
important species isolated from infections of the
genital and respiratory tract in humans. It is one of
the most important causes of non-gonococcal
urethritis.
Mycoplasma medium is supplemented with
urea
is
useful
for
the
growth
of
U.
urealyticum.
U.
urealyticum
typically
hydrolyses urea as an essential growth factor for
the
bacterium.
The
bacteria
like
those
of
mycoplasmas produce very minute colonies mea-
suring 15–50 μm in size. Hence, they were earlier
called T strain or T strain Mycoplasma. This
human
T
strain
Mycoplasma
is
now
re-designated as U. urealyticum.
U. urealyticum is a sexually transmitted path-
ogen and causes chorioamnionitis, pre-maturity,
vaginitis, cervicitis, acute salpingitis and pelvic
inﬂammatory disease in women. Ureaplasma
organisms are most frequently isolated from
infants, particularly girls. In men, the bacteria
also cause urethritis, proctitis, balanoposthitis
and Reiter’s syndrome.
Atypical Pneumonia
Atypical pneumonia is a term used to distinguish
from
typical
pneumonia
caused
by
S. pneumoniae. Earlier, any patient with sudden
onset of fever, chills, pleuritic pain and expecto-
ration of blood-tinged sputum was believed to
present
with
typical
pneumonia
caused
by
S. pneumoniae. The patients not showing these
characteristic manifestations were referred to as
having atypical pneumonia. M. pneumoniae,
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
and
Legionella
pneumophila are three important agents responsi-
ble for atypical pneumonia. Under this condition,
these pathogens are usually not isolated from
sputum by routine culture methods.
Beta-lactam antibiotics are usually ineffective
against Mycoplasma because of the absence of
cell walls because these antibiotics usually act
by inhibiting the synthesis of the cell wall. Peni-
cillin and cephalosporins are ineffective against
all these pathogens because they do not show
intracellular penetration in these pathogens.

A
Chlamydia and Chlamydophila
46
The taxonomy of Chlamydia has undergone
extensive revision recently based on genomic
studies of this microorganism. They are included
in the family Chlamydiaceae, which includes two
genera: Chlamydia and Chlamydophila. The spe-
cies Chlamydia trachomatis is included in the
genus
Chlamydia,
whereas
Chlamydophila
psittaci and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are
included in the new genus Chlamydophila.
fourth species, Chlamydophila pecorum, is nor-
mally present in the intestine, and vagina of
ruminants is responsible for various pathological
conditions in ruminants, swine and koalas.
The three species of importance to humans
resemble each other by their similar morphology,
a common group antigen, and identical develop-
mental cycle in the host cell. They have been
differentiated based on antigenic composition,
intracellular inclusions, sulphonamide suscepti-
bility
and
disease
production.
Glycogen
containing inclusion bodies that can be stained
by iodine are found only in C. trachomatis, and
this is also the only species among the three
which is susceptible to sulphonamides because
of
the
presence
of
the
folate
biosynthesis
pathway.
Genus Chlamydia
Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular parasites of
humans and animals with a marked afﬁnity for the
squamous epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal
and respiratory tracts. The chlamydiae were once
considered
viruses
due
to
their
ﬁlterability
through 0.45-μm ﬁlter and their failure to grow
in cell-free media. Earlier, they were named Psit-
tacosis
lymphogranuloma
trachoma
(PLT)
viruses or PLT agents. However, the Chlamydia
differs from viruses. They, like bacteria, (1) con-
tain both DNA and RNA, (2) possess cell wall
like that of Gram-negative bacteria, (3) contain
prokaryotic ribosomes, (4) multiply by binary
ﬁssion, (5) produce and synthesise their own
nucleic acid, lipids and proteins and (6) are sus-
ceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, such as
tetracyclines,
erythromycin,
macrolides
and
rifampicin. Species causing human infections
are summarised in Table 46.1.

General Properties
Morphology
Chlamydiae occur in two morphologically dis-
tinct forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate
body (RB).
Elementary body (EB) is a small, extracellu-
lar, infective form. It is a round particle measur-
ing 300–400 nm in size. The cell wall possesses
a rigid trilaminar structure, as seen in the cell
wall of Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria
lack the peptidoglycan layer found in other bac-
teria. However, their outer membrane proteins,
due to the presence of an extensive cross-linked
protein of the outer membrane, confer rigidity to

the cell wall. The chlamydiae do not multiply in
the EB form but are infectious. They cause
infections by binding to receptors on the epithe-
lial cells and stimulate uptake of the bacteria by
inﬁltration.

and replicating form of Chlamydia. The exten-
sively cross-linked proteins that confer rigidity
are absent in the RBs. Hence, this form of Chla-
mydia is osmotically fragile and friable. This
form, however, is protected by its intracellular
location.

Chlamydia. EB: elementary
body; RB: reticulate body
(https://link.springer.com/
chapter/10.1007/978-3-
030-56978-5_27)
A genus-speciﬁc lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is
present in the cell wall of Chlamydia. This LPS
can be detected by a complement ﬁxation test
(CFT) and species-speciﬁc and strain-speciﬁc
outer membrane protein.
Growth and Multiplication
Chlamydia multiplies by a characteristic growth
cycle within susceptible host cells (Fig. 46.1).
Elementary bodies are the infective form that
initiates the cycle. The infection is initiated by
the attachment of the EB to the microvilli of
susceptible epithelial cells, followed by penetra-
tion into the host cell. Inside the host cells, EB

remains within the cytoplasmic phagosomes, in
which EBs begin to multiply. The fusion of EB
containing phagosome with cell wall lysosome is
prevented; thus, the intracellular killing of EB is
inhibited. This phagolysosomal fusion is usually
prevented in the host cells with the intact outer
membrane.
Chlamydia trachomatis
665
Within 6–8 h after entering the cell, the EBs
within the phagosome are transformed to large,
metabolically active RBs. These RBs synthesise
their own proteins and nucleic acids but cannot
produce their own high-energy phosphate com-
pound. Chlamydiae are called energy parasites
because of this deﬁciency. Some strains of Chla-
mydia also depend on the host for the requirement
of their amino acid.
The RBs multiply by binary ﬁssion, which
continues for the next 18–24 h. The developing
phagosome with accumulated reticulated bodies
within the host cell is called the inclusion body.
The mature inclusion body contains nearly
100–500 EBs, which various staining procedures
can readily demonstrate. Ultimately, the host cell
ruptures, releasing the Eosin C. trachomatis
infection, the release of EBs occurs within
70–96 h. The release of the host cell is marked
by the presence of a scar. The release of EBs in
C. psittaci infection occurs within 48 h by lysis of
the host cell leading to severe damage of the
infected host cell.
Chlamydiae during the active growth express
the Chlamydia-speciﬁc LPSs on the cell surface
of the infected host cell. These LPSs expressed on
the cell’s outer surface are highly antigenic and
induce
immunological
and
inﬂammatory
responses. The properties that differentiate the
three Chlamydia species are summarised in
Table 46.2.

C. trachomatis is a strict human pathogen.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
C. trachomatis are Gram-negative bacteria. How-
ever, they can be stained better by Giemsa,
Castaneda, Macchiavello or Gimenez stains.
C. trachomatis, like other chlamydiae, occurs in
two morphologically distinct forms: EB and RB.
EB is an extracellular infectious particle. It is
small and spherical and measures 800–1200 nm
in diameter. These inclusion bodies in the
infected cells, such as conjunctiva, urethra and
corneal
smears,
can
be
demonstrated
after
staining with Giemsa, Castaneda or Macchiavello
methods. These inclusion bodies are large-sized
particles, easily demonstrated under a light micro-
scope. These bodies consist of a glycogen matrix;
hence they are demonstrated on staining with
Lugol’s iodine.
RB is metabolically active and replicating
form of Chlamydia.
Culture
C. trachomatis grows better in various tissue
cultures, using non-replicating stationary-phase
cells. The bacteria can grow in a few cell lines,
such as HeLa-229, McCoy, BHK-21 and buffalo
green monkey kidney cells. McCoy and HeLa
cells are frequently used for the isolation of
bacteria.
C. trachomatis can be grown by inoculation
into embryonated eggs and by experimentally
producing infection in animals, such as mice.


Chlamydia spp. grow in the yolk sac of 6- to
8-day-old chick embryos. The growth of Chla-
mydia is demonstrated by the presence of elemen-
tary and inclusion bodies as well as group-
speciﬁc complement-ﬁxing antigens in the yolk
sac. C. trachomatis strains differ in their infectiv-
ity (L1, L2 and L3) and cause infection in mice
when injected intracellularly.

Chlamydia and Chlamydophila
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Chlamydiae are heat-labile bacteria and are read-
ily killed within minutes by heating at 56 C.
They are susceptible to ethanol, ether, phenol,
formalin,
iodine,
potassium
permanganate,
sodium hypochlorite, silver nitrite and chlorite.
They remain fully viable for several days at
4
C. Moreover, they can be preserved at
70 C or in liquid nitrogen for a long period.
Antigenic Structure
Chlamydiae
possess
three
types
of
major
antigens.
The genus-speciﬁc antigen is a heat-stable,
complement-ﬁxing and genus-speciﬁc antigen. It
is an LPS-protein complex resembling the LPS of
Gram-negative bacilli. It is present in EBs and
RBs. The antigen can be extracted by ether, chlo-
roform or methanol. The antigen is identiﬁed by
CFT. The species-speciﬁc antigen is present at
the envelope surface and is species-speciﬁc. This
antigen is present in all the strains of Chlamydia.
Serotype-speciﬁc antigens is present only in a
few species of Chlamydiae. They are located in
the major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs)
and are useful for intraspecies typing of Chla-
mydia species.
Typing
Chlamydia species are classiﬁed into various
serovars and serologic variants based on these
antigens. C. trachomatis has been subdivided into
three biological variants known as biovars: i)
trachoma biovar causing trachoma and inclusion
conjunctivitis (TRIC), ii) LGV biovar causing
LGV
and
iii)
serovars
causing
mouse
pneumonitis. These biovars based on antigenic
differences in the MOMPs have been further
classiﬁed into 20 serotypes. The trachoma biovar
consists of 13 serotypes (A, B, Ba, C, D, Da, E,
F, G, H, I, Ia, J, Ja and K). The LGV biovar
consists of only ﬁve serotypes (L1, L2, L2a,
L2b and L3).
Pathogenesis
C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacte-
rium that causes diseases of many systems in
humans.
Virulence Factors
The ability to multiply intracellularly in the
infected cell is the key mechanism of virulence
of
C.
trachomatis.
The
bacteria
prevent
phagolysosome fusion with cellular liposomes,
thereby preventing the intracellular killing of the
bacteria by the host cell. Repeated infections
caused by C. trachomatis contribute to the pathol-
ogy seen in the infected eye in trachoma.
Pathogenesis of Chlamydia trachomatis
Infections
C. trachomatis causes disease mainly by (1) direct
destruction of infected host cells during multipli-
cation and (2) inducing inﬂammatory responses
in the host. C. trachomatis enters the host through
minute abrasions or injuries in the skin. The bac-
teria react speciﬁcally with the receptors found on
the non-ciliated columnar, cuboidal or transitional
epithelial cells. These epithelial cells are typically
found on the mucous membranes of the conjunc-
tiva and genitourinary systems, such as the ure-
thra, endocervix, endometrium, fallopian tube
and respiratory tract.
The LGV biovar multiplies in mononuclear
phagocytes found in the lymphatic system. The
pathological lesions are typically found in the
lymph nodes draining the site of primary infec-
tion. Granuloma is a characteristic pathological
lesion. Subsequently, the inﬂammatory process
spreads to other surrounding tissues, and ﬁnally,
rupture of the lymph nodes leads to the formation
of abscesses or sinus tracts. Infections with

trachoma serovars are associated with severe
inﬂammatory reactions consisting of neutrophils,
lymphocytes and plasma cells, as seen in the case
of trachoma.
Chlamydia trachomatis
667
Clinical Syndromes
C. trachomatis causes a variety of diseases. It is
an
important
cause
of
genital
and
ocular
infections worldwide.
Chlamydia trachomatis LGV biovar
Infections
C. trachomatis LGV biovar Causeslympho-
granuloma Venereum (LGV) and Ocular LGV.
Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV)
It is caused by C. trachomatis LGV biovar
(serotypes L1, L2, L2a, L2b and L3). Serotype
L2 is most commonly responsible for the condi-
tion. LGV is a sexually transmitted disease that
affects the cervix, urethra, salpinges and epididy-
mis. The incubation period varies from 1 to
4 weeks. A small painless papule or ulcerative
lesion is the primary lesion, which appears on the
external genitalia in patients with LGV. Penis in
males (Fig. 46.2), fourchette in females and rec-
tum in homosexuals are the common sites of
infection. Occasionally, primary lesions may be
found on the extragenital sites (e.g. ﬁngers and
palms). The absence of pain in ulcers is the typi-
cal manifestation, which differentiates the ulcers
from the painful ulcers found in herpes simplex
virus infection and syphilis. Proctitis is a common
manifestation in women with LGV. This occurs
due to the lymphatic spread of the bacteria from
the infected cervix or the vagina. Proctitis also
occurs in homosexual men.

Ocular LGV
It is caused by C. trachomatis LGV biovar. This
causes Parinaud oculogenital conjunctivitis. It is a
condition characterised by inﬂammation of the
conjunctiva
associated
with
periauricular,
sub-mandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy.
Chlamydia trachomatis trachoma biovar
Infections
C. trachomatis trachoma biovar causes tra-
choma, adult inclusion conjunctivitis, neonatal
conjunctivitis, infant pneumonia and urogenital
infections.
Trachoma
It is a communicable disease of the eye caused by
C. trachomatis serotypes A, B, Ba and C. This is a
condition characterised by follicular hypertrophy,
papillary hyperplasia, pannus formation and in late
stages cicatrisation (Fig. 46.3). The condition

begins in patients with follicular conjunctivitis with
diffuse inﬂammation that affects the entire conjunc-
tiva. Subsequently, the condition progresses with
the formation of pannus, which indicates invasion
of blood vessels of the cornea and ﬁnally loss of
vision. The loss of vision is the most important and
serious complication of trachoma.

7091-1613-5_4)
Adult Inclusion Conjunctivitis
The condition, also known as swimming pool
conjunctivitis, results from the infection with C.
trachomatis strains associated with genital infec-
tion (A, B, Ba and D–K). This infection is more
frequently seen in sexually active adults.
Neonatal Conjunctivitis
It is the neonatal form of inclusion conjunctivitis.
The condition develops in infants acquiring the
infection from an infected birth canal. The infec-
tion is usually seen in infants born to pregnant
mothers who have chlamydial infections of the
cervix.
Infant Pneumonia
It is caused by C. trachomatis is seen in infants
between 4 and 16 weeks of age. It is one of the
most common causes of pneumonia in newborns.
This infection is seen in 60% of neonates born to
infected mothers.
Urogenital Infection
It is the most common infection caused by
C. trachomatis. Approximately 80% of infected
females and 50% of infected males are asymp-
tomatic. Genital chlamydiasis is the most com-
mon sexually transmitted disease worldwide.
Women
with
chlamydial
infection
with
C. trachomatis, especially serotype C, are at a
greater risk of developing cervical cancer, nearly
6.5 times more than women without infection.
Reiter’s syndrome is a triad of recurrent conjunc-
tivitis, polyarthritis and urethritis or cervicitis and
is most commonly associated with genital infec-
tion caused by C. trachomatis. This condition is
seen in both men and women. Most patients with
Reiter’s syndrome have genital infections with
C. trachomatis at the onset of arthritis. EBs have
been demonstrated in synovial ﬂuid of patients
suffering from arthritis.
Laboratory Diagnosis
However, the sensitivity of various laboratory
methods depends on (i) the nature of the disease,
(ii) the site of infection from where the specimen
is collected and (iii) the population of the patient
examined.

Chlamydia trachomatis
669
Specimens
Specimens from the urethra, cervix, rectum oro-
pharynx and conjunctiva are the frequently col-
lected specimens. In addition, other specimens
such as blood, respiratory secretions, sputum,
lung and other tissues are collected and examined.
Pus from bubo is also useful for the diagnosis
of LGV.
Microscopy
Laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection is
made by microscopic examination of various
clinical specimens to demonstrate chlamydial
inclusion
bodies.
These
inclusion
bodies
(Halberstadter–Prowazek or HP bodies) can be
demonstrated in specimens stained by Giemsa,
Castaneda, Macchiavello or Gimenez stains.
C. trachomatis infections of conjunctiva, urethra
and cervix are diagnosed by demonstrating typi-
cal reniform inclusion bodies surrounding the
nucleus in the stained smear of conjunctiva, ure-
thra and cervical smears.
Iodine staining of conjunctival scrapings is
a simple and rapid method for diagnosing Tra-
choma and Inclusion Conjunctivitis (TRIC).
Iodine stains the glycogen matrix of inclusion
bodies of C. trachomatis. However, iodine
staining is a method of poor sensitivity and is
positive only in certain stages of development of
inclusion bodies in infected cells. This is more
useful for demonstrating chlamydial inclusion
bodies in the cell cultures inoculated with clinical
specimens.
Culture
Isolation of C. trachomatis in cell cultures is the
more
speciﬁc
method
for
diagnosing
C. trachomatis infection. Clinical specimens are
inoculated in different cell lines for isolation of
Chlamydia. The sensitivity of the cell cultures for
isolation of C. trachomatis is increased by
(1) pretreatment with cycloheximide (i.e. a meta-
bolic inhibitor, which inhibits the metabolism of
host cells) and (2) use of irradiated cell lines
(treated McCoy cells are most commonly used
cell lines for isolation of C. trachomatis).
C. trachomatis infection in cell culture is
demonstrated by the presence of intracellular
inclusion bodies. These are detected by the use
of
iodine
stains
or
ﬂuorescence-conjugated
antibodies. The culture methods are difﬁcult and
expensive. These are speciﬁcally preferred for the
isolation of C. trachomatis from rectal specimens
because non-cultural methods are usually nega-
tive. The culture shows high sensitivity and
speciﬁcity.
Chlamydial Antigen Detection
The chlamydial antigen can be detected in clinical
specimens by direct ﬂuorescent antibody (DFA)
staining
and
enzyme
immunoassay
(EIA).
Antibodies prepared against either the Chlamydia
MOMP or the cell wall LPS are used to detect
antigens in clinical specimens by these two
methods.
Serology
Antibody-based tests are useful for the diagnosis
of LGV. CFTs, microimmunoﬂuorescence and
ELISA are employed to detect speciﬁc antibodies
in the sera. CFT uses a genus-speciﬁc LPS anti-
gen for the detection of antibodies. A single
serum showing a high antibody titre of 1:256 or
more or a fourfold increase in antibody titre of a
paired sera sample is highly suggestive of LGV.
ELISA is a genus-speciﬁc test that uses LPS
antigens like CFT. The micro-immunoﬂuores-
cence test is a speciﬁc test that utilises the spe-
cies- and serovar-speciﬁc antigens, such as
Chlamydia MOMPs. Conﬁrmation of LGV is
carried out by the MIF test.
The antibodies-based serological tests are of
limited value in diagnosing urogenital infections
caused by C. trachomatis. This is because anti-
body titres cannot differentiate between recent
and past infection since antibodies remain in cir-
culation for a long time. However, detection of
IgM antibodies by ELISA is very useful for the
diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumonia in infants.
Frei’s Skin Test
Frei’s skin test is an intradermal skin test used to
diagnose LGV. A heat-inactivated C. trachomatis
LGV serovar grown in the yolk sac of an embry-
onated egg is used as an antigen. 0.1 mL of
antigen is injected intradermally in the forearm.

A control antigen prepared from an uninfected
yolk sac is injected into the other forearm.

Chlamydia and Chlamydophila
Frei skin test is a delayed hypersensitivity
reaction. A positive reaction is shown by devel-
oping
an
inﬂammatory
macule,
measuring
>7 mm in diameter, on the test arm after 2 days.
The
nodule
reaches
maximum
size
within
4–5
days.
The
skin
test
becomes
positive
2–6 weeks after infection and remains positive
for several years. However, nowadays, the skin
test is rarely used for diagnosis.
Molecular Detection
Molecular diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection
is made by DNA probes and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). DNA probes are currently avail-
able, which detect the presence of a species-
speciﬁc sequence of 16S rRNA. This method is
not highly sensitive. PCR is useful speciﬁcally for
testing urine specimens but is less sensitive for
detecting the bacteria in genital swabs collected
from infected women.
Treatment
Azithromycin is the drug of choice for the
treatment of genital chlamydial infections. The
antibiotic has the advantage of being given in a
single-dose regimen and has high tolerability and
few contraindications. Tetracyclines are usually
recommended for treating patients with LGV for
at least 3 weeks. Children below 9 years, pregnant
women
and
patients
unable
to
tolerate
tetracyclines are treated with a macrolide, such
as erythromycin or azithromycin combined with
sulﬁsoxazole.
Doxycycline for 7 days or a ﬂuoroquinolone
(e.g. oﬂoxacin) for 7 days is also effective for
treating genital and ocular infections. Erythromy-
cin given for 10–14 days is very useful for
treating conjunctivitis in infants and infant pneu-
monia. Erythromycin may be administered orally
and topically for the treatment of ophthalmia
neonatorum.
Local application and oral administration of
erythromycin and tetracycline gave for several
weeks are effective for the treatment of trachoma.
Epidemiology
C. trachomatis is distributed worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
LGV caused by C. trachomatis is highly preva-
lent in Asia, Africa and South America. Tra-
choma is distributed worldwide, and nearly
500 million people are infected worldwide. The
infection is endemic in the Middle East, Africa,
Far East and India. The condition is responsible
for blindness in 7–9 million patients. Trachoma is
particularly prevalent in these countries because
of overcrowding, poor sanitation and poor per-
sonal hygiene. All these factors facilitate the
transmission
of
infection.
Moreover,
C. trachomatis is the common cause of infant
pneumonia worldwide.
Habitat
C. trachomatis is a strict human pathogen. It is
found in the conjunctiva and genitourinary tract
in an infected host. C. trachomatis also inhabits
the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of
humans.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans
are
the
only
natural
host
of
C. trachomatis and thus are the only signiﬁcant
reservoir of infections. Ocular discharges from
infected cases are the common source of eye
infection for trachoma. Occasionally, respiratory
discharges and human faeces can be a source of
infection.
Trachoma is transmitted by eye-to-eye contact
through
droplets,
contaminated
hands
and
contaminated clothing. All these methods facili-
tate the transmission of ocular discharges from
the eyes of infected children to those of normal
children. Genital discharges are the source of
infection for adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Adult
inclusion conjunctivitis is usually transmitted by
orogenital contact and also by autoinoculation.
Although rare, eye-hand transmission has been
reported for adult inclusion conjunctivitis.

Chlamydophila psittaci
671
Inclusion
conjunctivitis
in
newborns
is
acquired by the infants born vaginally from
mothers
infected
with
C.
trachomatis.
C. trachomatis eye infection occurs in approxi-
mately one-fourth of infants whose mothers’ gen-
ital tract is infected with C. trachomatis. Genital
discharge is also the source of infection for pneu-
monia of the newborn. Pneumonia develops in
some infants during their birth through an
infected birth canal. Chlamydial genital infections
are usually caused by vaginal, anal and oral sex-
ual contact.
Prevention and Control
It is difﬁcult to prevent C. trachomatis infection.
However, morbidity (such as blindness associated
with trachoma) can be prevented by immediate
treatment at an early stage of the disease. It can
also be prevented by taking measures to prevent
re-exposure to the bacteria. Chlamydial genital
infections are prevented by using safe sexual
practices and prompt treatment of symptomatic
patients and their partners.
Genus Chlamydophila
C. pneumoniae was ﬁrst isolated from the con-
junctiva of a child in Taiwan in 1965 and subse-
quently from the throat of a patient with
pharyngitis in 1983. These organisms were
initially believed to be C. psittaci strains TWAR
(from Taiwan acute respiratory) because they
produced inclusion bodies in cell cultures similar
to those produced by C. psittaci. Taiwan isolate
was designated as TW-183, and the pharyngeal
isolate was designated as AR-9. These two strains
were initially believed to be related to psittaci
strains, but later on, were found to be different.
These two organisms were then classiﬁed as
Chlamydia pneumoniae but now have been
re-classiﬁed and ﬁnally placed in a new genus
Chlamydophila.
Chlamydophila pneumoniae
C. pneumoniae is the third common cause of
pneumonia following Streptococcus pneumoniae
and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. It is an important
cause of respiratory disease in older children and
adults worldwide. It causes mostly asymptomatic
infections. Pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis and
pneumonia are the common manifestations of
symptomatic cases in severe respiratory tract
infections.
C. pneumoniae is also a strict human pathogen
and does not have animal reservoirs. Infection is
transmitted by respiratory secretions from person
to person without any avian or animal host.
Approximately
200,000–300,000
cases
of
C. pneumoniae occur every year, and most of
these cases occur in adults. The infection mostly
remains asymptomatic, where an individual can
be reinfected.
Diagnosis
is
made
by
demonstrating
C. pneumoniae antigen in specimens by EIA or
DFA test. Diagnosis by culture is not made as
C. pneumoniae grows poorly in cell cultures.
Serodiagnosis is carried out by using CFT,
ELISA
or
MIF.
Antibodies
have
been
demonstrated in sera of more than 50% of people.
PCR is also used to detect bacterial genomes in
the specimen. Tetracycline, doxycycline, erythro-
mycin and azithromycin are given for 10–14 days
to treat C. pneumoniae infection. Control of
C. pneumoniae infection is difﬁcult.
Chlamydophila psittaci
C. psittaci is the causative agent of psittacosis, a
disease of parrots and psittacine birds which can
be transmitted to humans. The disease was ﬁrst
observed in parrots, hence named psittacosis
(Greek word psittakos means ‘parrot’). A similar
disease of non-psittacine birds was called ornitho-
sis (the Greek word ornithos means ‘bird’). Now
both conditions are called psittacosis.

672
46
Chlamydia and Chlamydophila
Infection in birds may occur as asymptomatic
or symptomatic. Symptomatic infection may
manifest as respiratory infection, diarrhoea and
emaciation. In the infected birds, the bacteria are
present in the blood, tissue and feathers and are
also excreted in the faeces, nasal discharges,
aerosols, etc. psittaci can be transmitted from
birds to humans as well as sheep, cows and
goats. Humans acquire the infection mostly from
psittacine birds, such as parrots, parakeets,
cockatiels and macaws. They get infected by
inhaling dried bird droppings, urine or respiratory
secretions of these infected birds.
Human infections are mostly occupational,
and veterinarians, poultry workers, pet-shop
workers, pigeon farmers, etc. are at increased
risk for this infection. Person-to-person transmis-
sion is rare. Ingestion of poultry birds also does
not cause any infection. Laboratory infection is
well documented. C. psittaci in humans causes a
clinical syndrome, which varies from a mild
inﬂuenza-like illness to fatal pneumonia. The
untreated cases may be severe and progress to
encephalitis, endocarditis, pericarditis and even
death.
Laboratory diagnosis is based mainly on sero-
logical tests. Demonstration of a fourfold rise in
antibody titre in the paired acute and convalescent
sera by the CFT is suggestive of C. psittaci infec-
tion. MIF test is a speciﬁc test used to conﬁrm the
diagnosis.

C. psittaci can be grown in cell cultures, such as

used routinely.
Tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin and
azithromycin are useful for treating C. psittaci
infection. Infection is prevented by controlling it
in birds.

Listeria monocytogenes
Morphology and Other Properties
L. monocytogenes is a small (1–3  0.5 μm),
Gram-positive bacillus with a tendency to occur
in chains. Typically, the bacteria show a slow
tumbling type of motility by means of peritri-
chous ﬂagella at 22–25 C but are non-motile at
37
C.
The
bacterium
is
aerobic
or
microaerophilic. It grows between 35 and 37 C
and in the presence of reduced oxygen tension
and
5–10%
CO2.
It
is
non-sporing,
non-capsulated
and
non-acid
fast.
L. monocytogenes grows on ordinary medium
but grows better on blood agar and tryptose phos-
phate agar. The bacteria on blood agar after 24 h
of incubation produce smooth, round, translucent,
easily emulsiﬁable and non-pigmented colonies.
On blood agar, they produce a narrow zone of
weak beta haemolysis. Due to this haemolysis,
the colonies of L. monocytogenes may be con-
fused with those of group B streptococci.

L.
monocytogenes differs
from
group
B
streptococci by various tests. It is motile catalase
positive and shows positive CAMP (Christie,
Atkins and Munch–Peterson) reaction and nega-
tive hippurate hydrolysis Hippurate CAMP reac-
tion. L. monocytogenes produces a block type of
haemolysis unlike that of arrow-head haemolysis
produced
by
group
B
streptococci.
L. monocytogenes ferments sugars such as glu-
cose, saline and aesculin with acid production. It
is MR (methyl red) and VP (Voges–Proskauer)
test positive but oxidase urease indole and H2S
negative.
L.
monocytogenes
produces
marked
monocytosis on experimental inoculation into
the rabbits, hence the name monocytogenes.
This feature can also be observed in human
infections. Anton test is used to identify this
organism,
wherein
a
culture
of
L. monocytogenes is inoculated into a rabbit or
guinea pigs’ eyes to develop keratoconjunctivitis.
Pathogenesis
Haemolysin, a protein, is an important virulence
factor of L. monocytogenes. This is also known as
histolysin.

Miscellaneous Bacteria
Clinical Syndromes
L.
monocytogenes
produces
a
variety
of
infections in pregnant women, neonates, adults
and elderly people. The bacteria in non-pregnant
ladies may cause asymptomatic or mild febrile
illness. However, infection in pregnant ladies
may cause abortion or stillbirth of the child. In
non-pregnant females, asymptomatic infections
of the genital tract may lead to infertility.
L. monocytogenes in adults may cause menin-
gitis, meningoencephalitis, septicaemia, endocar-
ditis
and
brain
abscess.
Patients
receiving
immunosuppressive therapy, and suffering from
immunosuppressive disease, are more susceptible
to the infection. L. monocytogenes may cause
occupation-related infections in poultry workers,
butchers and veterinarians. Due to direct contact
with infected animals, birds or other products,
these people may develop cutaneous infections.
Laboratory Diagnosis
This
depends
on
the
isolation
of
L. monocytogenes from clinical specimens by
culture.
Specimens
Cervical
and
vaginal
secretions,
meconium,
blood, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), amniotic ﬂuid,
placenta
and
biopsy
are
frequently
used
specimens for diagnosis.
Gram staining of the CSF smear is useful for
the detection of bacteria. This is positive in nearly
50% of the cases. Specimens are cultured on
blood agar, chocolate agar and tryptose phosphate
agar and incubated for 24–72 h at 35–37 C.
Isolation of bacteria is much more increased by
cold enrichment. In this method, the specimens
are stored in thioglycolate broth or tryptose phos-
phate at 4 C, and subcultures are carried out at
weekly intervals for 1–6 months.
Treatment
L. monocytogenes is sensitive to ampicillin, gen-
tamicin and cotrimoxazole. Cephalosporins are
not useful for infections caused by Listeria.
Epidemiology
L.
monocytogenes
is
distributed
worldwide.
Many outbreaks of listeriosis caused by food
contaminated
with
Listeria
have
been
documented in Europe and North America. Nos-
ocomial outbreaks of Listeria have also been
documented in hospitals.
L. monocytogenes occurs as a saprophyte in
soil, water and sewage. It is also widely prevalent
in different mammals or birds, ﬁsh, ticks and
crustaceans. The bacteria have been isolated
from milk, cheese and other milk products. The
infection is transmitted by (1) ingestion of milk,
milk
products
and
other
food
preparations
contaminated with the bacteria; (2) direct contact
with an infected animal or animal products and
(3) inhalation of contaminated dust.
Prevention and Control
Infections can be prevented by thoroughly wash-
ing and cooking food material before consump-
tion. In pregnant women, early diagnosis is
necessary to avoid meningitis in newborn.
Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae
E. rhusiopathiae is a slender, straight or slightly
curved, Gram-positive bacillus with a tendency to
form long ﬁlaments. It is non-motile, non-sporing
and non-capsulated. It is catalase negative. It
ferments glucose and lactose, producing acid but
no gas. It is H2S negative. It is negative for MR,
VP, indole, urease and nitrate reduction test.
It is aerobic and facultative anaerobic. The
growth is improved in the presence of 5–10%
CO2. It can grow on nutrient agar and also on


blood agar. After 24–48 h of incubation, it
produces
convex
and
translucent
colonies
surrounded
by
a
variable
zone
of
alpha-
haemolysis. On tellurite agar, it produces black
colonies.
Klebsiella granulomatis
675
E.
rhusiopathiae
in
humans
causes
septicaemia, endocarditis and erysipeloid. The
latter is a localised infection of the skin that
resembles streptococcal erysipelas. These cutane-
ous lesions are painful, oedematous and erythem-
atous. They usually occur on the hands or ﬁngers
of persons handling animals, ﬁsh or animal
products. The cutaneous lesions are usually
associated with arthritis, lymphopharyngitis or
lymphadenitis.
Diagnosis
is
made
by
isolating
E. rhusiopathiae from pus and other clinical
specimens by culture. E. rhusiopathiae occurs as
a saprophyte in soil, food and water. It occurs as a
natural parasite of swine, mice, rabbits, turkeys
and many others. The bacillus is sensitive to
penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, methicillin,
ciproﬂoxacin and clindamycin.
Alcaligenes faecalis
A. faecalis are Gram-negative, small, non-sporing
bacilli. They are motile due to the presence of
peritrichous ﬂagella. They are strict aerobes and
do not ferment sugars. They are usually oxidase
positive, citrate positive and urease negative.
A. faecalis occurs as a saprophyte in water and
soil contaminated with putreﬁed decayed organic
matter.
The
bacteria
are
also
found
as
commensals in the gastrointestinal tracts of
humans and animals. The bacterium causes uri-
nary tract infection, infantile gastroenteritis and
typhoid-like fever in humans.
Chromobacterium violaceum
C. violaceum is a Gram-negative bacillus. It is
catalase and oxidase positive but indole and ure-
ase negative. It is a motile bacterium due to the
presence of polar and lateral ﬂagella. It is aerobic
and facultative anaerobic. It grows on nutrient
agar producing a non-diffusible violet pigment,
which is soluble in ethanol and insoluble in chlo-
roform and water. C. violaceum is found as
saprophytes in water, soil and tropical and sub-
tropical countries. Intestinal and genitourinary
infections and septicaemic illnesses with pneu-
monia are rare human infections associated with
the bacteria. The bacillus is sensitive to erythro-
mycin, tetracycline, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, etc.
Flavobacterium meningosepticum
F.
meningosepticum
is
a
Gram-negative,
non-sporing and non-motile bacterium. It is cata-
lase and oxidase positive and weakly fermenta-
tive. It can grow on ordinary mediums, such as
nutrient agar. It produces smooth, circular and
glistening colonies after 24 h of incubation at
37 C. On incubation at room temperature for
48 h, it produces yellow, non-diffusible pigment
on the nutrient agar. F. meningosepticum is a
ubiquitous saprophyte present in the soil, water,
foodstuff and moist environment. It can cause
opportunistic infections, neonatal meningitis in
premature infants and pneumonia in immuno-
compromised hosts. In immunocompetent adults,
it causes a mild illness. Novobiocin, rifampicin,
clindamycin
and
cefoxitin
effectively
treat
F. meningosepticum infections.
Klebsiella granulomatis
Klebsiella granulomatis, formerly known as
Donovania granulomatis, is the causative agent
of granuloma inguinale, a granulomatous dis-
ease, which involves the genital and inguinal
part of the infected host. K. granulomatis was
ﬁrst
discovered
by
Donovan
in
1905.
Donovanosis, a sexually transmitted disease
caused by K. granulomatis, was ﬁrst described
in India by Mac Leod. He demonstrated the char-
acteristic intracellular bodies in stained smears of
pus from an ulcer of a patient suffering from
donovanosis.
K.
granulomatis
is
a
small
Gram-negative coccobacillus, which measures
1–2
0.5–1.5 μm in size. The bacterium often

shows bipolar staining, giving rise to a safety-pin
appearance. It is a capsulated bacterium but is
non-motile, non-sporing and non-acid fast. It
can be grown with difﬁculty on egg yolk medium
or modiﬁed Levinthal agar. The bacterium grows
readily in the yolk sac of an embryonated egg.
676
47
Miscellaneous Bacteria
K. granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale,
which has an incubation period of a few weeks to
months. The condition manifests as subcutaneous
nodules on genital organs or the inguinal area.
Subsequently, these nodules suppurate and break
down, leading to the formation of painless granu-
lomatous lesions. The specimen is collected by
scraping the border of the ulcerative lesion and
making a smear on a glass slide. The smears are
stained with Giemsa or Wright stains. In the
stained smear, the body of the bacillus is stained
blue, and the capsule is stained pink. Laboratory
diagnosis is made by demonstrating the charac-
teristic organisms in the cytoplasm of histiocytes
polymorphonuclear leukocytes or remain free
outside the cell. These are called Donovan bod-
ies. About 1–25 bacteria can be found within a
mononuclear phagocyte.
Granuloma inguinale is seen in Caribbean
Islands and New Guinea. The condition is trans-
mitted through sexual contact. Tetracyclines,
erythromycin
and
trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole are effective for the treatment
of the condition.
Genus Acinetobacter
The genus Acinetobacter consists of Gram-
negative bacterium that is strictly aerobic and
non-motile. They are oxidase and nitrate negative
and
non-fermentative.
They
appear
as
Coccobacillary rods, often occurring in pairs,
ranging from 1–1.5  1.5–2.5 μm in size. They
mimic the appearance of Neisseria and hence
were named Mimeae. The ﬁrst member of the
family was Micrococcus calcoaceticus, a soil
bacterium identiﬁed by Beijernick in 1911.
As classiﬁcation based on routine identiﬁca-
tion in the clinical laboratory is erroneous,
classifying Acinetobacter has undergone many
changes. Recently, with the help of molecular
studies, such as DNA hybridisation, and different
DNA homology studies, the genus Acinetobacter
has been reclassiﬁed. It consists of 23 named and
11 unnamed species. The following are the three
major
complexes
studied
within
the
genus
Acinetobacter: (1) Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-
baumannii
complex:
glucose-oxidising,
non-
haemolytic strains. (2) Acinetobacter lwofﬁi:
glucose-negative, non-haemolytic strain and iii)
Acinetobacter haemolyticus: haemolytic strain.
A. baumannii grows on MacConkey medium,
producing pinkish colonies. It produces acid in
the presence of glucose, arabinose, xylose and
occasionally rhamnose. The acid formation seen
in 10% lactose but not in 1% lactose is a charac-
teristic feature of this organism. However, molec-
ular methods are employed for ﬁnal identiﬁcation.
A. lwofﬁi forms yellow-coloured colonies on
MacConkey medium. It is not known to acidify
sugars. Few strains may be oxidase positive.
Acinetobacter species are widely spread in
nature and commonly occur in soil. They are
opportunistic pathogens that can survive on
moist and dry surfaces and are frequently present
on normal skin. They are an important cause of
nosocomial
infections
such
as
ventilator-
associated
pneumonia,
skin
and
wound
infections,
meningitis
and
bacteraemia.
The
strains isolated from clinical specimens are often
multi-drug resistant, posing a great challenge for
treatment and patient care. Following standard
precautions or preventive measures can curtail
healthcare-associated infections, thus reducing
the use of antibiotics.
Streptobacillus and Spirillum
S. moniliformis and S. minus are the natural
pathogens of rodents. Both these agents cause
the same condition called rat-bite fever.
Streptobacillus moniliformis
S. moniliformis is a pleomorphic, Gram-negative
bacillus (0.1–0.5  1–5 μm) that stains poorly
with Gram staining. The bacteria may appear as a
string of beads containing granules. The bacte-
rium may lose its cell wall and readily develop

into L forms. S. moniliformis is an aerobe and
facultative anaerobe, and a highly fastidious bac-
terium. It is catalase, oxidase, indole, urease and
nitrate negative. It ferments glucose with the pro-
duction of acid but no gas. The bacterium is a
slow
grower.
It
grows
on
enriched
media
supplemented with 15% blood, 20% horse or
calf serum or 5% ascitic ﬂuid. It produces dis-
crete, granular or smooth, grey colonies after
3 days of incubation at 35–36 C in a humid
aerobic condition. S. moniliformis causes rat-bite
fever, a condition characterised by relapsing
fever, rash and arthralgia. The incubation period
varies from 2 to 10 days. The condition manifests
with sudden onset of fever, headache and
myalgias followed by a petechial rash and arthri-
tis. In untreated cases, relapses are common.
Genus Legionella
677
Rat-bite fever is usually caused by the bite of
a rat or occasionally by the bite of a mouse, cat,
squirrel or dog. The disease also occurs without
rat bite and is believed to occur due to ingestion of
raw meat or water contaminated by the excreta of
the rat. This condition is known as Haverhill fever
or erythema arthriticum epidemicum.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made
by culture of the bacillus from blood or other
body ﬂuids. Serological tests, such as indirect
ﬂuorescent antibody (IFA) test, complement ﬁxa-
tion test and agglutination test, are frequently
useful
for
diagnosis.
All
these
tests
use
S. moniliformis as an antigen. A serum titre of 1:
80 or more or a fourfold rise between acute and
convalescent sera is considered diagnostic of the
disease.
Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for treating
cases of rat-bite fever. Cephalosporins, erythro-
mycin, clindamycin and tetracycline are also used
to treat the condition.
Spirillum minus
S. minus is a short, spiral, Gram-negative bacillus
and measures 0.2–0.5  3–5 μm in size. It is a
motile bacterium with the presence of 1–5
amphitrichous
ﬂagella.
S.
minus
was
ﬁrst
observed in a rat by Carter in 1888 from India.
Later, researchers from Japan identiﬁed it as the
causative organism of a type of rat-bite fever
(Sodoku), acquired by the infected rat bite or
scratches. The bacteria stain poorly with Gram
stain but stain better with Giemsa or Fontana
stains. S. minus also causes rat-bite fever similar
to that caused by S. moniliformis, but with few
differences in the clinical manifestations. Rat-bite
fever caused by S. minus has a long incubation
period of 2–4 weeks. The condition may manifest
as suppuration of the rat-bite wound, and the
onset of fever is associated with regional lymph-
adenopathy. Mortality is relatively less (6%) in
untreated cases.
Other clinical manifestations of rat bite are
similar
to
those
caused
by
S. moniliformis. S. minus, unlike other organisms
such as the S. moniliformis, is found in the naso-
pharynx of rats and other small rodents. They are
transmitted to humans by the bite of these animals
but not by contaminated water or milk, as seen
with S. moniliformis.
Darkﬁeld microscopic examination of blood,
pus or lymph node aspirate is useful to demon-
strate S. minus. Microscopy of Giemsa- or
Wright-stained blood smear is also useful. Ani-
mal inoculation is a frequently used method for
diagnosis. In this method, clinical specimens are
inoculated intraperitoneally into rodents, follow-
ing which these pathogens can be demonstrated in
the blood and the peritoneal ﬂuid of these rodents,
1–3 weeks after inoculation.
Serology is not useful. Rat-bite fever caused
by S. minus can be treated with both penicillin
and tetracycline. Table 47.1 shows a comparison
between rat-bite fever caused by Streptobacillus
and Spirillum species.
Genus Legionella
Legionella is ubiquitous aquatic saprophytes
present worldwide. Many of these species are
found in the environment and are also associated
with human infections. L. pneumophila is an
important species that causes both community-
acquired and nosocomial pneumonia.
Legionella as the causative agent of pneumo-
nia was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1976 during the annual
convention of the American Legion held at a hotel
in Philadelphia. The infection was believed to be

transmitted from the contaminated water in the
hotel’s air conditioning system. A total of
182 cases were detected, of which 29 patients
died because of the disease. The disease was
characterised by fever, cough and chest pain,
leading to pneumonia and often the patient’s
death. This condition was referred to as Legion-
naire disease, and the causative agent isolated
from
the
fatal
cases
was
designated
as
L. pneumophila.

The genus Legionella contains 39 genetically
deﬁned species and more than 60 serogroups.
Many of these species cause infections in
humans. Legionellosis is the term used for
infections caused by different Legionella species.
Legionnaire disease is the term used to describe
pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila.
Legionella pneumophila
L. pneumophila is the causative agent of Legion-
naire disease and Pontiac fever.
Properties of the Bacteria
Morphology
L. pneumophila is a small, slender, pleomorphic,
Gram-negative
bacillus.
L.
pneumophila
organisms in clinical specimens stain poorly
with Gram staining. They can be stained better
by the silver impregnation method using Dieterle
silver stain. It measures 0.3–0.9  2–5 μm with
pointed ends and a tendency to form ﬁlaments in
culture on solid media. It is motile by means of
one or more polar or sub-polar ﬂagella. It is
non-acid fast.
Culture and Biochemical Properties
L. pneumophila is a strict aerobe, that grows at an
optimum temperature of 35 C and an optimum
pH of 6.9. It is nutritionally fastidious and grows
on the medium supplemented with iron salts and
l-cysteine.
Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE)
agar containing buffered charcoal, yeast extract
and cysteine is a useful medium for the growth of
L. pneumophila. It is a slow-growing bacterium
and may take 3–5 days to produce visible
colonies. The colonies on BCYE agar are circu-
lar, grey or grey-blue and low convex with a
slightly irregular margin. Under the microscope,
the
colonies
typically
have
a
ground-glass
appearance.
L. pneumophila is mostly non-fermenter and
derives its energy from the metabolism of amino
acids. It does not ferment any sugars and is urease
and nitrate test negative. It is catalase-positive,
oxidase
variable
and
liqueﬁes
gelatin.
It
hydrolyses starch and hippurate.
Other Properties
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
L. pneumophila is readily killed by 70% ethyl
alcohol, 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% formalde-
hyde. It is also killed by residual chlorine
(5 ppm of chlorine) in chlorinated water in

1 min, by 1.25 ppm of chlorine in 15 min and by
0.65 ppm of chlorine in 1 h.
Legionella pneumophila
679
Pathogenesis
L. pneumophila is an obligate intracellular patho-
gen. Based on direct immunoﬂuorescence and
slide agglutination tests, a total of 15 serogroups
(1–15) of L. pneumophila have been identiﬁed.
Of these, three serogroups (1, 4 and 6) are primar-
ily associated with human disease. Nearly 80% of
the cases of legionellosis disease caused by
L. pneumophila are believed to be due to
serogroup 1.
Virulence Factors
The capability of the bacteria to multiply in
macrophages
and
their
ability
to
prevent
phagolysosome fusion are the main determinants
of the virulence of the bacteria. L. pneumophila
organisms possess many virulence factors, such
as protease, haemolysin and cytotoxin. Protease is
an important virulence factor, which plays an
important role in causing infection.
Pathogenesis of Legionnaire’s Disease
The bacteria infect human monocytes and alveo-
lar macrophages. The bacteria multiply in these
cells by binding complement to an outer mem-
brane porin protein and subsequent deposition of
C3b, a component of the complement on the
surface of the bacteria. This facilitates them to
combine with CR3 complement receptors on
phagocytes and enter the cell through endocyto-
sis. Once inside the cell, the bacteria are not killed
because they prevent phagolysosome fusion.
Subsequently, the bacteria multiply in large num-
bers in the intracellular vacuoles and produce
many enzymes, such as phosphatase, lipase,
nuclease and proteolytic enzymes. Finally, they
lyse and kill the infected host cell.
Clinical Syndromes
L. pneumophila causes two distinct clinical
entities—Legionnaire’s
disease
and
Pontiac
fever.
Legionnaire’s Disease
The incubation period varies from 2 to 10 days.
Pneumonia is the primary manifestation of multi-
lobular
consolidation,
inﬂammation
and
abscesses in the lung. The common symptoms
are fever, chills, dry or non-productive cough
and
pleuritic
or
non-pleuritic
chest
pain.
Haemoptysis is rare. The condition becomes
more severe and is associated with morbidity
and high mortality if not treated immediately.
Progressive respiratory failure is the most com-
mon cause of death in patients with Legionnaire’s
disease. The mortality may be as high as 80% in
untreated patients.
Pontiac Fever
Pontiac fever is a mild, self-limiting condition.
The condition presents as fever and myalgia that
resolve without treatment. Table 47.2 compares
the Legionnaire disease and Pontiac fever caused
by L. pneumophila.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Sputum, lung ﬂuid, pleural ﬂuid, transtracheal
aspirations and bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid are
the respiratory specimens frequently used for the
diagnosis. Blood is also used for culture.
Microscopy
Gram staining of the sputum or other respiratory
specimens may show many leukocytes, but the
organisms are rarely demonstrated. Bacteria, if
found, are very poorly stained. Dieterle silver or
Gimenez stain can be used to demonstrate
bacteria.

Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Test
It is a sensitive method to detect Legionella spp.
in sputum and other specimens. This test uses
ﬂuorescent-labelled monoclonal or polyclonal
antibodies produced against Legionella species.
This is a rapid test; the result can be obtained
within 2–4 h. The sensitivity of DFA depends
on the presence of a large number of bacteria in
the specimen. Therefore, sensitivity increases if
samples from the lower respiratory tract are used.
A
positive
DFA
test
becomes negative in
4–6 days of treatment.
Culture
Isolation of Legionella spp. from sputum or other
respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage,
transtracheal
aspiration
and
bronchoscopic
specimens) by culture is the deﬁnitive method
for diagnosing Legionella infection. Blood cul-
ture shows very low sensitivity.
BCYE agar is the medium most frequently
used for the culture of the bacteria. The bacteria
produce small colonies after 3–5 days of incuba-
tion on BCYE agar at 35 C in the presence of
3–5%
CO2.
Bronchoalveolar
lavage,
transtracheal
aspiration
and
bronchoscopic
specimens increase the sensitivity of the culture.
However,
blood
culture
shows
very
low
sensitivity.
Serology
IFA test and ELISA are the most commonly used
antibody-based serological tests to diagnose
Legionella infection. IFA titre of 1:256 or more
on a single serum is diagnostic. A fourfold or
greater increase in antibody titre between acute
and convalescent serum to 1:128 or greater in titre
is also considered diagnostic of the disease.
ELISA, radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the
latex
agglutination
test
are
used
to
detect
Legionella lipopolysaccharide antigen in the
urine. Urinary antigen detection is relatively
rapid and simple and can even detect antigen
excreted in patients on antibiotic therapy. The
disadvantage of the test is that it can detect only
L. pneumophila (serogroup 1 antigen). The
antigens remain in urine even for months after
the infection has resolved.
Molecular Detection
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a speciﬁc
method for detecting Legionella spp. in urine,
serum and bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid. The
main advantage of this method is that it can detect
infections caused by Legionella species other
than L. pneumophila serogroup 1.
Treatment
Erythromycin or tetracycline is useful for the
treatment
of
community-acquired
infections.
Fluoroquinolones,
such
as
doxycycline,
telithromycin
and
azithromycin,
are
recommended to treat severe cases. Beta-lactam
antibiotics and aminoglycosides are not useful.

Genus Bartonella
681
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Legionnaire’s disease is prevalent worldwide.
This is responsible for 2–15% of all community-
acquired pneumonia that requires hospitalisation.
Habitat
L. pneumophila is an obligate intracellular patho-
gen found in alveolar macrophages in the infected
human host.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
L. pneumophila is a saprophyte widely found in
aquatic environments. The bacteria have been
isolated
from
various
man-made
water
environments, such as hot water systems in hotels
and hospitals, cooling water systems, air condi-
tioning cooling towers, showerheads, industrial
coolants and respiratory ventilators. The factors
that contribute to the presence of these bacteria in
these environments include (1) stagnation of
water, (2) temperature of water varying from
25 to 40
C and (3) presence of free-living
amoebae, such as Acanthamoeba and Bartonella
species, which support the growth of Legionella.
Therefore, contaminated water is the primary
source of infection.
Transmission to humans occurs by inhaling
aerosolised mist from a contaminated water
source, contaminated with either the bacteria or
free-living amoeba infected with the bacteria.
Nosocomial infection is transmitted through aspi-
ration, contaminated water or respiratory equip-
ment. Infection is also transmitted by using
nebulisers, humidiﬁers and other instruments
that have been washed with contaminated tap
water. Person-to-person transmission does not
occur. Animals also do not play any role in the
transmission of the infection. The elderly people,
people with chronic heart or lung diseases and the
immunocompromised patients or are receiving
immunosuppressive therapy are at the greatest
risk for the disease. This is because of their
depressed cell-mediated immunity and altered
pulmonary functions.
Prevention and Control
Hyperchlorination of water and superheating of
water to 70–80 C have proved to be of value in
preventing the disease. Complete elimination of
bacteria from water, however, is difﬁcult.
Eikenella corrodens
Eikenella corrodens is a Gram-negative, faculta-
tive anaerobic, capnophilic bacillus. This bacillus
is positive for nitrate and oxidase test, whereas
negative for catalase and indole test. The pitting
or corroding of blood agar by the colonies is the
characteristic feature of this bacterium and hence
the name ‘corrodens’. It is a commensal of the
human mouth, upper respiratory and gastrointes-
tinal tract. Infection occurs due to salivary or
faecal contamination mainly through the skin's
subcutaneous tissues and is typically indolent. It
rarely causes osteomyelitis, pneumonia, endocar-
ditis and meningitis. It is sensitive to penicillin,
tetracycline and cephalosporins and resistant to
macrolides and clindamycin.
Cardiobacterium hominis
Cardiobacterium hominis is a pleomorphic, oxi-
dase and indole positive, catalase negative, Gram-
negative bacillus. It is present commonly in the
human mouth and upper respiratory tract, mainly
the nose and throat. It rarely causes infection such
as endocarditis, particularly for those with previ-
ous cardiovascular disease. It grows on a blood
agar medium under high humidity and 3–5%
CO2. The recommended drugs for treatment are
penicillin and streptomycin.
Genus Bartonella
Members of the genus Bartonella are very small,
Gram-negative bacilli transmitted by arthropods.
The bacteria are Gram-negative aerobic bacilli
and
are
fastidious
in
growth.
They
cause

infections in a mammalian host by invading endo-
thelial cells and red blood cells. Bartonella spe-
cies are found in various animal hosts and are
typically present without evidence of the disease.
The genus Bartonella consists of 11 species, of
which ﬁve are associated with human diseases
(Table 47.3).

Bartonella bacilliformis
Bartonella bacilliformis is the causative agent of
Oroya fever, an acute febrile illness consisting of
severe anaemia. This condition was ﬁrst identiﬁed
in the mountainous parts of Peru in 1870 during
the laying of railway lines from Lima to Oroya in
Peru. The outbreak of Oroya fever killed 1000
workers associated with this railway project.
B. bacilliformis are short, Gram-negative
coccobacilli measuring 0.3–0.5  1.0–1.7 μm.
The bacteria occur singly, in pairs, in chains or
clumps. They are motile by the presence of as
many as 10 ﬂagella at one pole of the bacteria.
They are aerobic and require an optimum pH of
7.8 and an optimum temperature of 25–28 C for
their growth.
Oroya fever is restricted in its geographical
distribution and is mainly conﬁned to Peru,
Columbia and Ecuador in South America. The
laboratory diagnosis is made by demonstrating
intracellular bacteria in a blood smear stained by
Giemsa. The bacteria are found in the cytoplasm.
Bacteria can be isolated from blood in enriched
blood agar.
Penicillin,
streptomycin,
tetracycline
and
chloramphenicol
effectively
treat
B. bacilliformis infection. The use of insecticides,
such as DDT, to kill the sand ﬂy prevents trans-
mission of the disease.
Bartonella quintana
Bartonella
quintana,
earlier
known
as
Rochalimaea quintana, is a causative agent of
trench fever or 5-day fever. This condition was
ﬁrst recognised in the soldiers ﬁghting in trenches
in Europe during the First World War. The caus-
ative agent was earlier identiﬁed as rickettsia and
named Rickettsia quintana because it caused a
5-day fever (from quintana, means ﬁfth), a syno-
nym for trench fever. The organism subsequently
was found not to be a rickettsia and differed from
the latter by its ability to grow in cell-free media,
such as blood agar; hence it was separated into a
new
genus
Rochalimaea.
Currently,
it
has
undergone further taxonomical classiﬁcation and
has been reclassiﬁed as B. quintana.
B. quintana is a small, Gram-negative bacillus
(0.3–0.5  1.0–1.7 μm) and is non-motile. It
grows slowly on sheep or rabbit blood agar at
37 C in the presence of 5% CO2. It requires
prolonged incubation of 1–2 weeks to produce
demonstrable colonies.
B. quintana is transmitted by the body louse.
The lice become infectious 5–9 days after feeding
on a trench fever patient, after which the lice
remain infectious throughout their life and excrete
organisms in their faeces. When they bite a new
host, the infected lice defecate on the skin’s sur-
face. When these faeces come in contact with
minor scratches or abrasions on the skin’s sur-
face, the bacteria present in the faeces enter the
skin and initiate the infection.

Gardnerella vaginalis
683
Trench fever has an incubation period of
14–30 days. The condition can vary from asymp-
tomatic to symptomatic infection. Severe head-
ache, fever (giving the name of the disease as
5-day fever), chills, weakness and severe pain in
the back and legs are the common manifestations
of symptomatic cases. The condition is also
associated with rashes on the chest, abdomen or
back. The infection does not cause the patient’s
death but can produce a very severe debilitating
illness. Trench fever is an exclusively human
disease. No animal reservoir for this disease has
been identiﬁed. The disease is transmitted from
humans to humans by the human body louse
vector.
Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating the
bacteria from the patient’s blood on blood agar
after 2 weeks of incubation. The organism can
also be demonstrated in lice after allowing the
healthy lice to feed upon the patient (xenodiagno-
sis). Weil–Felix test used for diagnosis of rickett-
sial infection is negative in trench fever. The
condition can be treated with gentamicin alone
or with erythromycin.
Bartonella henselae
Bartonella henselae is the causative agent of
cat-scratch disease. The disease follows scratches
and the bite of the cat or with the bite of cat ﬂeas.
B. henselae is a small, Gram-negative bacillus
measuring 2.0–2.5  0.5–0.6 μm. Like other
Bartonella species, it can grow on chocolate
agar or Columbia agar supplemented with 5%
sheep or rabbit blood. B. henselae produces dry
white cauliﬂower-like colonies after 5–15 days of
incubation at 35–37 C in the presence of 5%
CO2.
B. henselae typically causes cat-scratch dis-
ease. It is a benign condition characterised by
regional lymphadenopathy and fever. The cervi-
cal and axillary lymph nodes are most commonly
affected. Usually, a single lymph node is affected
in 50% of the cases. It also causes bacillary
angiomatosis, a condition resembling Kaposi
sarcoma in patients with AIDS. The skin, lymph
nodes, liver and spleen are primarily involved in
this condition. The bacteria also cause sub-acute
bacterial endocarditis.
Laboratory diagnosis is conﬁrmed by demon-
stration of clusters of B. henselae in lymph node
biopsy
smears
stained
with
Warthin–Starry
impregnation stain. The bacteria can also be
isolated by culture on chocolate agar or Columbia
agar enriched with sheep or rabbit blood on incu-
bation for 3 weeks or more. Gentamicin and
erythromycin are effective for the treatment of
the condition.
Genus Capnocytophaga
Members of the genus Capnocytophaga are ﬁla-
mentous Gram-negative bacilli. They are slow-
growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and
require the presence of CO2 for their growth.
The
genus
is
classiﬁed
into
two
groups:
(1) dysgonic fermenter 1 (DF-1) and (2) dysgonic
fermenter 2 (DF-2). DF-1 group consists of three
species:
Capnocytophaga
ochracea,
Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Capnocytophaga
sputigena, which are found as members of the
normal ﬂora of the oropharynx in humans.
These species have been associated with peri-
odontitis and bacteremia. In an immunocompro-
mised host, they occasionally cause severe
systemic disease, such as endocarditis. DF-2
group bacteria are found only in dogs and not
in humans.
Most Capnocytophaga strains are resistant to
aminoglycosides but are sensitive to broad-
spectrum cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones and
penicillins.
Gardnerella vaginalis
G. vaginalis was earlier known as Corynebacte-
rium vaginalis or Haemophilus vaginalis. Since
the bacterium does not require X and V growth
factors, it has been shifted from the genus
Haemophilus
and
placed
in
the
genus
Gardnerella. The bacterium is present as a com-
mensal
in
the
male
urethra
and
vagina.
G. vaginalis are small, pleomorphic, Gram-

negative rods, which are sometimes Gram vari-
able. They are non-sporing, non-motile and
non-capsulated. G. vaginalis causes non-speciﬁc
vaginitis and cervicitis, frequently associated with
anaerobic
vaginosis.
The
condition
is
characterised by foul-smelling vaginal discharge
with a ﬁshy odour and acidic pH.

Miscellaneous Bacteria
A high vaginal swab or endocervical swab
with exudate material is the specimen for diagno-
sis. The specimens are transported in the Stuart
medium. Gram staining of the smear shows
Gram-variable small bacilli and the presence of
clue cells. These clue cells are the vaginal epithe-
lial cells covered with many small Gram-variable
rods. The bacteria are cultured on blood agar and
incubated anaerobically at 37 C for 48 h for
colonies. The colonies of G. vaginalis are
identiﬁed by Gram staining, negative catalase
test, and positive hippurate hydrolysis test.
G. vaginalis is sensitive to penicillin, ampicil-
lin and trimethoprim. It is resistant to gentamicin,
nalidixic acid and colistin. Metronidazole is the
drug of choice.
Moraxella lacunata
These are thick to plump rods. They are Gram-
negative occurring in pairs and chains. They do
not have ﬂagella but are reported to be sluggishly
motile. They grow on ordinary media and are
strict aerobes. They are positive for catalase and
oxidase tests. They are negative for indole pro-
duction. Morax and Axenfeld were the ﬁrst to
report Moraxella lacunata as the cause of
angular conjunctivitis, which is also known as
Morax–Axenfeld bacillus.
Kingella
They were previously grouped under the genus
Moraxella. They are non-motile, catalase nega-
tive, oxidase positive and urease negative. Glu-
cose and other carbohydrates are fermented with
the production of acid. Cells are Gram-negative
rods that occur as diplococcal and coccobacillary
forms. They are present in the normal ﬂora.
They are associated with infections of the bones,
joints, tendons and endocarditis. C. hominis,
E.
corrodens
and
Kingella
belong
to
the
HACEK group, slow-growing bacteria causing
endocarditis.
Case Study
A 29-year-old software engineer working in Peru
for the past year came back to India with
complaints of myalgia, arthralgia, headache,
severe anaemia and hepatosplenomegaly. Rou-
tine laboratory studies were negative. A blood
smear stained by Giemsa stain showed intracellu-
lar bacteria. Blood culture showed colonies,
which were identiﬁed as B. bacilliformis.

Virology

Introduction to Viruses
48
The viruses are too small to be seen with a light
microscope. Their small size allows them to pass
through
ﬁlters
used
to
retain
bacteria
in
contaminated ﬂuids. Hence, they were ﬁrst
described
as
ﬁlterable
agents.
Like
other
microorganisms
(e.g.
bacteria,
fungi
and
parasites), viruses are the infectious agents
associated with disease in humans. Unlike other
infectious agents (Fig. 48.1), viruses are obligate
intracellular parasites; that is, they require living
host cells to multiply. In addition, viruses repli-
cate by assembling the individual components
rather than binary ﬁssion.
The viruses show the following features:
1. They are ﬁlterable agents.
2. They are obligate intracellular parasites.
3. They contain a single type of nucleic acid,
either DNA or RNA, but not both.
4. The virion of the virus particle consists of a
nucleic acid genome packaged into a protein
coat
(capsid),
which
itself
is
sometimes
enclosed by an envelope of lipid, proteins
and carbohydrates known as an envelope.
5. They multiply inside the living cells by using
the synthesising machinery of the host cell.
6. They replicate by the assembly of the individ-
ual components and do not replicate by divi-
sion, such as binary ﬁssion.
7. They have few or no enzymes for their own
metabolism.
They
always
use
host
cell
machinery to produce their components, such

as viral messenger RNA (mRNA), protein and
identical genome copies.
The differences between bacteria and viruses
are summarised in Table 48.1. The viruses affect
a wide range of hosts. Some viruses infect
invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, protists, fungi
and bacteria. We are concerned mainly with
viruses that infect either humans or bacteria in
medical microbiology. The viruses that infect
bacteria are known as bacteriophages or phages.
Morphology of Viruses
The extracellular, infectious viral particle is called
the virion. It is a complete, fully developed infec-
tious viral particle composed of nucleic acid
surrounded by a protein coat. The latter protects
it from the environment and is a vehicle of trans-
mission from one host to another. The viruses are
classiﬁed based on differences in the structure of
these coats. The virion may have a lipid envelope.
The virion may also contain essential or accessory
enzymes or other proteins.
Size
The clinically important viruses vary widely in
their size (Fig. 48.1). They range from as small as
20-nm viruses (picornaviruses) to as large as
300-nm viruses (poxvirus). Electron microscopy

is the most current method for determining the
size and shape of the virus.

Structure and Symmetry of Virus
Viral Structure
The virion consists of a nucleic acid core, the
genome, surrounded by a protein coat and the
capsid (Fig. 48.2). Together with the enclosed
nucleic
acid,
the
capsid
is
known
as
the
nucleocapsid.
Capsid
The nucleic acid of a virus is surrounded by a
protein coat called the capsid. Each capsid is
composed of a large number of protein subunits
(polypeptides) called capsomeres, which form its
morphological units. The polypeptide molecules
composing the capsomeres are of a single type in
some viruses, while several types may be present
in other viruses. The arrangement of capsomeres
is characteristic of a particular type of virus.

Functions of Capsid
The capsid facilitates entry of the viral genome
into the host cells by adsorbing readily to cell
surfaces. The capsid of the virus protects its
nucleic
acid
from
the
activity
of
nuclease
enzymes
in
biological
ﬂuids
and
thereby
facilitates the attachment of the virus to target
cells in the host. Symmetrically arranged poly-
peptide molecules of capsid form an impenetrable
shell around the nucleic acid core. The viral cap-
sid structure is best demonstrated by X-ray crys-
tallography or electron microscopy.
Envelope
In some viruses, the capsid is covered by an
envelope; such viruses are called enveloped
viruses. All of the negative-stranded RNA viruses
are enveloped. The viruses that lack an envelope
are called non-enveloped or naked viruses.
The
virion
envelope
usually
consists
of
lipoproteins and glycoproteins. It has a membrane
structure similar to the cellular membrane of the
host cell. The viral envelope does not contain any
cellular proteins, even though viruses are released
from the host cell by an extrusion process that
coats the virus with a layer of host cell plasma
membrane that becomes the viral envelope. The
envelope
contains
proteins
determined
and

encoded by viral nucleic acid in most cases. The
lipid component of the envelope is usually of host
cell origin.
Morphology of Viruses
689
Fig. 48.2 Schematic
diagram of the structure of a
virus
Depending on the virus, the envelopes of
the viruses may or may not be covered by spikes.
The spikes are glycoprotein-like projections on
the outer surface of the envelope. Most spikes
act as viral attachment proteins (VAPs). The
VAP that binds to red blood cells is called
haemagglutinin. The ability of certain viruses,
such as the inﬂuenza virus, to agglutinate red
blood cells is due to the presence of these
haemagglutinins.
The
process
is
called
haemagglutination (Fig. 48.3), and it forms the
basis of the haemagglutination inhibition test
used in viral serology (Table 48.2). The VAPs
in some viruses perform different functions, such
as neuraminidase activity of inﬂuenza virus,
fusion glycoprotein of paramyxovirus and C3b
receptor associated with Herpes simplex virus.
The structural components of the envelope
remain biologically
active
only in
aqueous
solutions and are readily destroyed by drying or
on treatment with acids, detergents and solvents,
such as ether, leading to the inactivation of the
virus. They are rapidly killed in the stomach
due to the sensitivity of enveloped components
to gastric acidity. Therefore, most enveloped
viruses are usually transmitted through body
ﬂuids, such as blood, respiratory droplets, tissue
exudates, etc.
Viral Symmetry
Three types of symmetry are observed depending
on the arrangement of the capsid around the
nucleic acid core (genome). These are (1) icosahe-
dral (cubical), (2) helical and (3) complex
symmetry.
Icosahedral Symmetry
Two types of capsomeres constitute the icosahe-
dral capsule. They are the pentagonal capsomeres
or
the
vertices
(pentons)
and
hexagonal
capsomeres
making
up
the
facets
(hexons)
(Fig. 48.4). There are always 12 pentons, but the
number of hexagons varies with the virus group.
Each penton has ﬁvefold symmetry (pentamer
or pentagon) in the shape of an equilateral

triangle. This pentamer symmetry is found in
simple viruses, such as the picornaviruses and
parvoviruses. In picornaviruses, each pentamer
is made of ﬁve protomers, each of which is com-
posed of three subunits of four different proteins.
Morphology of Viruses
691
The hexamer symmetry is usually found in
large capsid virions, such as herpes viruses and
adenoviruses. The presence of hexon extends the
icosahedral and is called an icosadeltahedral. The
adenovirus nucleocapsid has 12 pentons and
240 exons, whereas the herpes virus nucleocapsid
has 12 pentons and 150 hexons surrounded by an
envelope.
Helical Symmetry
The nucleic acid and the capsomeres are wound
together to form a spherical or spiral tube. The
viruses with helical structures usually appear as
rods and their capsomeres self-assemble on the
RNA genome into rods extending to the length of
the genome. These capsomeres cover and protect
the RNA. The tubular nucleocapsid structure may
be rigid as in tobacco mosaic virus, but maybe
pliable and may be coiled on itself in case of some
other animal viruses. Helical nucleocapsids are
usually demonstrated within the envelope of
most negative-stranded RNA viruses.
Complex Symmetry
Some viruses may not exhibit either icosahedral
or helical symmetry but instead may exhibit a
complex
symmetry.
For
example,
poxvirus
shows complex symmetry.
Shape
Most of the enveloped viruses are round or pleo-
morphic, except for poxvirus and rhabdovirus.
Rhabdovirus is a bullet-shaped virus, whereas
poxvirus is brick-shaped.
Viral Components (Nucleic Acid,
Proteins and Lipids)
Viral components include nucleic acid, proteins
and lipids
Viral Nucleic Acid
The virus’s genome consists of either DNA or
RNA but never both. The DNA can be single-
stranded or double-stranded. Depending on the
virus, the DNA can be linear or circular. The
RNA can be either positive sense (+) like mRNA
or negative-sense (), double-stranded (+/) o
ambiguous (containing + and  regions of RNA
attached to it). In some RNA viruses, such as the
inﬂuenza virus, the RNA genome is in several
separate segments, each segment encoding an indi-
vidual gene. The total amount of nucleic acid may
vary from a few thousand nucleotides to as many as
250,000 nucleotides.
Viral Proteins and Lipids
Viruses
contain
proteins,
which
constitute
capsids. The viral protein protects the nucleic
acid and determines the antigenic speciﬁcity of
the virus. In addition, the enveloped viruses con-
tain lipids, which are derived from the host cell
membrane.
Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical
Agents
Disinfectants
The viruses are usually more resistant than bacte-
ria to chemical disinfectants. Most viruses are
relatively resistant to phenol. The most active
antiviral disinfectants are oxidising agents, such
as hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate,
hypochlorite and organic iodine compounds.
Formaldehyde and β-propiolactone are active
virucidal agents commonly used to prepare killed
viral vaccines. The chlorination of drinking water
is useful for killing most common viruses, except
for hepatitis A and polioviruses. These two
viruses are relatively resistant to chlorination.
Temperature
Most of the viruses, with few exceptions, are
highly heat-labile. They are inactivated within
seconds at 56 C, within minutes at 37 C and
within days at 4 C. Viruses such as inﬂuenza,
measles and mumps are very labile and may

survive outside the host only for a few hours.
Other viruses, such as polio and hepatitis A, are
relatively stable and may survive for many days,
weeks or even months in the environment.
Viruses, such as hepatitis B, show resistance to
heating at 60 C for 60 min; slow viruses, such as
scrapie virus, are resistant to autoclaving at
121 C for 15 min.
692
48
Introduction to Viruses
The viruses are stable at low temperatures.
They can be stored by freezing at 35 or
70 C. Lyophilisation or freeze drying is useful
for the long-term storage of viruses. The poliovi-
rus is an exception, as it does not withstand freeze
drying.
pH
The viruses usually remain viable in a pH range
of 5–9 but are sensitive to extremes of acidity and
alkalinity. Rhinoviruses are very susceptible to
acidic pH, whereas enteroviruses are highly
resistant.
Lipid Solvents
Ether, chloroform and detergents are active
against
enveloped
viruses
but
not
against
non-enveloped, naked viruses.
Radiations
The viruses are readily inactivated by sunlight,
ultraviolet
(UV)
radiations
and
ionising
radiations.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are inefﬁcient against viruses. This
property of antibiotics has been exploited in
viral culture, in which, before virus isolation,
clinical specimens are treated with antibiotics to
remove all the bacterial contaminants.
Replication of Viruses
The replication of viruses in the host cell depends
upon the synthesis mechanism of the host cell for
the manufacture of different viral components.
The genetic information for viral multiplication
is present in the viral nucleic acid. Multiplication
of
viruses
follows
the
basic
pattern
of
bacteriophage multiplication but has several
important differences.
The multiplication of viruses, both DNA and
RNA containing viruses, is divided into six
phases as follows: (1) attachment, (2) penetration,
(3) uncoating, (4) biosynthesis, (5) maturation
and (6) release (Fig. 48.5).
Attachment
Attachment or adsorption is the ﬁrst event in the
infection of the cell by a virus. The viruses have
attachment sites that attach to the complementary
receptor sites on the host cell surface. These
receptor proteins in the virus are distributed on
the virus’s surface. These receptor proteins vary
from one virus to another (Table 48.3). For exam-
ple, in the inﬂuenza virus, these receptor proteins
are the spikes present on the surface of the enve-
lope, whereas, in adenovirus, these receptor
proteins are small ﬁbres present at the corner of
the icosahedron.
The attachment sites of the virus bind speciﬁ-
cally to the complementary receptors on the sur-
face of the host (Table 48.4). These receptor sites
on the cell vary depending on the nature of the
virus. Rabies virus binds speciﬁcally to the ace-
tylcholine receptors found on neural cells. HIV-1
binds speciﬁcally to the CD4, a60-kDa glycopro-
tein, on the surface of mature T lymphocytes.
Inﬂuenza virus binds speciﬁcally to the sialic
acid residue of glycoprotein receptor sites on the
surface of the respiratory epithelium. Therefore,
the host’s susceptibility to virus infection depends
on the presence or absence of receptors on the cell
surface.
Penetration
Whether enveloped or non-enveloped, the viruses
penetrate
cells
by
different
mechanisms
depending on their nature. A non-enveloped
virus enters the cell by a process known as endo-
cytosis. Endocytosis is an active process that
brings nutrients and other molecules into a cell.
This process is also known as viropexis. The
enveloped viruses enter the cell by an alternate
method called fusion, in which the viral envelope
fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the
capsid
into
the
cell
cytoplasm.
Human

immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) is a classical
example of an enveloped virus, which enters the
host cell by this method.

Uncoating
Uncoating is the process of the separation of viral
nucleic acid from its protein core. This process
apparently varies depending on the nature of the
virus causing infection. With most viruses, the
uncoating is accomplished by the action of lyso-
somal enzymes present inside the phagocytic
vacuoles and Golgi vesicles of the host cell.
These lysosomal enzymes degrade the protein of
the viral capsid. In some other viruses, uncoating
is caused exclusively by enzymes present in the
host cell cytoplasm. In the case of poxvirus, the
uncoating is affected by the action of a speciﬁc
enzyme encoded by the viral DNA, which is
synthesised soon after infection.
Biosynthesis
The sites of viral synthesis depend on the type of
virus, whether RNA virus or DNA virus. Biosyn-
thesis begins with the transcription of viral
nucleic acid to produce mRNA. Translation of
mRNA into early or non-structural proteins is
the components of a virus. These viral proteins
can even shut down the translation and replication
machinery of the host cell, followed by viral
nucleic acid replication. Subsequently, structural
protein synthesis acts as daughter virion capsids.

Biosynthesis of DNA Viruses
DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the host cell's
nucleus using viral enzymes. However, they
synthesise their capsid and other proteins in the
cytoplasm by using host cell enzymes. Subse-
quently, the proteins enter into the nucleus and
assemble with the newly synthesised DNA to
form
virions,
and
then
these
virions
are
transported along with the endoplasmic reticulum
to the membrane of the host cell for release.
Most DNA viruses (herpes virus, papovavirus,
adenovirus and hepadnavirus) synthesise their
nucleic acid in the host cell nucleus. Poxvirus is
an
exception
because
its
components
are
synthesised in the cytoplasm.
Biosynthesis of RNA Viruses
The RNA viruses multiply in the host cell’s cyto-
plasm. The major differences in the multiplication
process of various RNA viruses lie in how mRNA
and viral RNA are produced, as follows.
1. In reoviruses, the double-stranded RNA is
transcribed to mRNA by viral polymerase.
2. Single-stranded RNA viruses are classiﬁed
into two categories, depending on the method
of mRNA transcription. In a positive-strand (+
strand, positive sense) RNA virus, the viral
RNA itself acts as the mRNA. The viral
RNA is translated directly into viral proteins
in the host cell cytoplasm. In the negative-
strand (—sense) RNA viruses, the RNA is
antisense, with polarity opposite to mRNA.
They possess their own RNA polymerase for
the transcription of mRNA.
3. The
single-stranded
RNA
genome
of
Retroviridae
shows
a
unique
replication.
First, the RNA genome is converted into an
RNA–DNA hybrid by the viral enzyme
reverse
transcriptase
(RNA-directed
DNA
polymerase). The double-stranded DNA is
synthesised from the RNA–DNA hybrid,
after which it is integrated into the host cell

chromosome. Integration of viral DNA into
the host cell may lead to the transformation
of
the
cell
and
the
development
of
malignancies.
Mechanism of Virus Replication
Baltimore classiﬁed viruses into six classes
depending on the method of mRNA transcription.
Class 1: Fully double-stranded DNA viruses like
adeno, herpes and papovaviruses, where the
DNA is transcribed with the help of host cell
machinery after it enters the nucleus. The
DNA thus obtained is found to be infectious.
However, hepadnavirus has partially double-
stranded DNA, which converts into fully
double-stranded DNA with the help of viral
DNA polymerases in the host cell’s cytoplasm.
Further, they are transcribed in the host cell’s
nucleus with the help of host transcription
factors. Hence, hepadnavirus DNA extract is
not infectious. Poxviruses undergo replication
in the cytoplasm by using mRNA with the help
of polymerases produced by virions. Because
of this, Poxvirus DNA is also not infectious.
Class 2: In the case of single-stranded DNA
viruses like parvoviruses, DNA transcription
occurs only after its conversion into duplex
form inside the host cell nucleus.
Class 3: In reoviruses, mRNA is formed only
after transcription of double-stranded RNA
by viral polymerases.
Class 4: Based on the method of mRNA tran-
scription, double-stranded RNA is divided into
two classes, positive strand and negative
strand.
In
the
positive
strand,
the
viral
RNA by itself behaves as an mRNA. The
viral RNA by itself is infectious. Translation
of viral RNA into viral proteins directly takes
place inside the host cell cytoplasm.
Class 5: In the case of negative-sense RNA like
orthomyxoviruses,
paramyxovirus
and
rhabdoviridae, the RNA is antisense, having
polarity just opposite mRNA. They have their
own RNA polymerases for mRNA transcrip-
tion. The DNA extracted from these viruses is
found to be non-infectious.
cative phenomenon occurs in which single-
stranded RNA is transformed into RNA–
DNA hybrid with the help of viral reverse
transcriptase. From this RNA–DNA hybrid,
double-stranded DNA is produced, which is
known
as
provirus.
This
provirus
gets
integrated into the host cell chromosome,
which leads to cell transformation and the
development of neoplasia.
Maturation
The assembly of the protein capsid is the ﬁrst step
in
viral
maturation.
The
capsids
of
many
enveloped viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses
and paramyxoviruses, are enclosed by envelopes
consisting of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.
During
maturation,
the
envelope
protein
is
encoded by the viral genes and is incorporated
into the plasma membrane of the infected host
cell.
In
contrast,
the
envelope
lipids
and
carbohydrates are encoded by host cell genes
but not by viral genes and are present in the
plasma
membrane.
The
envelope
develops
around the capsid by a process called budding.
The assembly of various viral components into
virions may occur in the nucleus (e.g. herpes virus
and
adenoviruses)
or
cytoplasm
(e.g. picornaviruses and poxviruses).
The non-enveloped viruses are present intra-
cellularly as fully developed viruses, but in the
case of enveloped viruses, only the nucleocapsid
is complete. Subsequently, the nucleocapsid is
surrounded by an envelope, which is derived
from the host cell membrane during the process
of budding.
Release
The release of the completed viruses is the last
step in the replication of viruses.
In the case of animal viruses, the release of
progeny virions usually occurs without cell lysis.
The host cell is unaffected and goes on dividing
into the daughter cells, which continue to release
virions. Progeny virions are released into the
surrounding environment and may affect new
host cells. Budding does not immediately kill

the host cell, and in some cases, the host cell
survives.

Introduction to Viruses
Non-enveloped
viruses,
however,
release
through the rupture in the host cell plasma mem-
brane. This type of release usually results in the
death of the host cell.
A single infected cell may release a large num-
ber of daughter virions. The time taken for a single
replication cycle is about 15–30 h. In a replication
cycle, the virus cannot be demonstrated inside the
host cell from the stage of penetration until the
appearance of mature daughter virions. This period
is known as the eclipse stage.
Abnormal Replicative Cycles
During replicative cycles of the virus, many types
of abnormal replicative cycles do occur. These
are as follows:
Incomplete Viruses
Due to defects during the assembly of viral
components, some of the daughter virions that
are produced may not be infective. An example
of such an incomplete virus is the inﬂuenza virus
which shows a high haemagglutination titre but
low infectivity. This is known as the von Magnus
phenomenon.
Pseudovirions
Pseudovirions
are
viruses
that
occasionally
enclose host cell nucleic acid instead of viral
nucleic acid. These, therefore, are non-infective
and cannot replicate.
Abortive Infections
In this type of infection, the virus components
may be synthesised, but the maturation is defec-
tive. The progeny virions are either not released
or are non-infectious. This type of infection
occurs due to infection of the wrong host cells
by the virus.
Defective Viruses
Some genetically defective viruses do not pro-
duce fully formed virions. They produce fully
mature virions only in the presence of helper
viruses which supplement the genetic deﬁciency
in the defective viruses. Hepatitis D virus and
adeno-associated satellite viruses are examples
of defective viruses, which replicate only in the
presence of helper viruses, such as hepatitis B
virus and adenovirus, respectively.
Viruses of Medical Importance
They can be classiﬁed broadly as DNA viruses
and RNA viruses.
DNA Viruses
These belong to the following families (Table 48.5):
Adenoviridae
The members of the family Adenoviridae are
medium-sized viruses measuring 20–90 nm in
size. These viruses are non-enveloped, icosahe-
dral viruses with 252 capsomeres. They are so
named because they were ﬁrst isolated from
adenoids. These viruses are mostly associated
with acute respiratory diseases.
Poxviridae
These are large-sized, brick-shaped viruses mea-
suring 300  240  100 nm in size. They have a
complex structure with a core containing a single
linear
molecule
of
double-stranded
DNA
genome. The pox (pox: pus-ﬁlled lesions) viruses
are associated with skin lesions. The viral
components are synthesised and assembled in
the cytoplasm of infected host cells.
Herpesviridae
These are medium-sized icosahedral nucleocap-
sid viruses (100 nm). They have enveloped
viruses containing linear, double-stranded DNA.
They are named after the spreading (herpetic)
appearance of cold sores. The viruses multiply
in the nucleus of the host cells.

These are small (40–55 nm) viruses containing
double-stranded DNA. They are non-enveloped
viruses. They replicate in the host cell nucleus
and the host cell chromosome. This may cause
host cells to proliferate, resulting in a tumour.
Papovaviruses
are
acronyms
for
papillomas
(warts), polyomas (tumours) and vacuolation
(cytoplasmic vacuolation produced by some of
these viruses).
Hepadnaviridae
Hepadnaviridae (hepa: liver; DNA: DNA core)
are so named because they cause hepatitis and
contain DNA as a genome. These viruses differ
from other DNA viruses by synthesising their
DNA by copying RNA using reverse transcrip-
tase. Human hepatitis B virus, an important virus
associated with human disease, is included in this
family.

Introduction to Viruses
RNA Viruses
These
belong
to
the
following
families
(Table 48.6):
Togaviridae
These
viruses
include
arboviruses
and
alphaviruses. Most of these viruses multiply in
arthropods as well as invertebrates. Togaviridae
(toga: envelope) are enveloped viruses containing
a single-stranded RNA genome. These viruses are
small spherical viruses measuring 40–70 nm
in size.
Rhabdoviridae
Rhabdoviruses (rhabdo: rod) are bullet-shaped
viruses.
They
are
enveloped,
measure
130–300  20 nm in size and contain a single-
stranded RNA.
Reoviridae
They are icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses
measuring 60–80 nm in size. They contain a
double-layered capsid enclosing 10–12 segments
of double-stranded RNA. Their name is derived
from the ﬁrst letters of respiratory, enteric and
orphan. When ﬁrst discovered, the viruses were
not associated with any diseases; hence, they
were called orphan viruses. These viruses are
now known to cause respiratory and intestinal
infections.
Retroviridae
Retroviruses (re: reverse, tr: transcriptase) viruses
are so named because, characteristically, they
possess
the
enzyme
reverse
transcriptase
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. They are ico-
sahedral, enveloped viruses measuring 100 nm in
size. Many of these viruses are associated with
tumours in infected hosts. One genus, lentivirus
includes the subspecies HIV-1 and HIV-2, the
causative agents of acquired immunodeﬁciency
syndrome (AIDS).
Picornaviridae
Picornaviruses (pico: small) are the smallest
viruses, measuring 20–30 nm in size. They are
non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with a single-
stranded RNA genome. These include three
genera
(Enterovirus,
Rhinovirus
and
Hepatovirus) of medical importance.
Orthomyxoviridae
These are medium-sized (80–120 nm) viruses.
They are spherical and elongated, enveloped
viruses consisting of a single-stranded but seg-
mented (eight segments) RNA genome. The
inﬂuenza virus is the only virus of medical impor-
tance belonging to this group.
Paramyxoviridae
These are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses mea-
suring
150
nm
in
size.
They
contain
non-segmented,
single-stranded,
linear
RNA.
Three genera have been described: Paramyxovi-
rus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus.
Bunyaviridae
These are enveloped, spherical viruses measuring
90–100 nm in size. The genera of medical impor-
tance
include
Bunyavirus,
Hantavirus,
Uukuvirus, Phlebovirus and Nairovirus.
Arenaviridae
They are spherical, pleomorphic viruses with var-
iable sizes (50–300 nm). They contain electron-
dense, chromosome-like particles giving a sandy

Introduction to Viruses
Caliciviridae
These are naked non-enveloped viruses. They are
small and spherical and measure 35–39 nm
in size.
Filoviridae
They are long ﬁlamentous, enveloped viruses
with variable sizes. They contain a single-
stranded RNA genome. The Marburg and Ebola
viruses are viruses of medical importance.
Prions
Prions are infectious particles that can transmit
disease. These prions are composed chieﬂy of a
protein without any detectable nucleic acid. This
is a new name widely accepted for the old name
slow viruses. Prusiner coined the term prion for
proteinaceous infectious particles. Unlike con-
ventional viruses, the prions apparently have no
virion structure of genomes and evoke no
immune response in the infected host. These are
extremely
resistant
to
inactivation
by
heat,
disinfectants and radiation.
The prions are causative agents of slow viral
infections, such as sub-acute spongiform enceph-
alopathy. After a long incubation period of years,
they produce a progressive disease that causes
damage to the central nervous system, leading to
sub-acute spongiform encephalopathy. A detailed
description of prions and slow virus diseases is
provided in Chap. 62.
Viroids
Viroids are protein-free fragments of single-
stranded, circular RNA that cause disease in
plants. The term viroids were coined by Triener
(1971) to describe a new subclass of subviral
agents having a genome very much similar to
those of known viruses; they consist of very
short pieces of naked RNA: 300–400-nucleotides
long with no protein coat. The RNA does not
code for any proteins. The low-molecular-weight
RNA is resistant to heat and organic solvents but
sensitive to nucleases. So far, viroids have been
identiﬁed as pathogens of only plants; these were
ﬁrst identiﬁed in the potato spindle tuber disease.
The viroids are yet to be linked to any disease in
humans.
Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
Viruses cause infections in the host ﬁrst by break-
ing the natural protective mechanisms of the
body, then evading the host’s immune system
and ﬁnally by killing off the host cells and trig-
gering immune and inﬂammatory responses. The
outcome of viral infection depends on the host’s
response to the viral infection and the nature of
the host–virus interaction. Viruses replicate only
inside the living cells; hence, the primary patho-
genic manifestations are seen at the cellular level.
Stages of Viral Infections
Viruses initiate infection and may cause disease
through many deﬁned stages. These include
(1) entry into the body, (2) initiation of infection
at a primary site (infection of the target tissue),
(3) replication of the virus (Fig. 48.6) and spread
to the secondary site and (4) manifestations of the
disease.
Entry into the Body
Entry of the viruses into the body is the ﬁrst step
of viral infections. The skin is the best barrier to
infections. In addition to the skin, mucus, ciliated
epithelium, gastric acid, bile, tears, etc., confer
basic natural protection against many viruses.
The viruses enter the body through the respiratory
tract, skin, conjunctiva, alimentary tract and geni-
tal tract and initiate the infection by breaking
these natural barriers to infection.

Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
701
Fig. 48.6 Replication of virus (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40042-020-00030-w)
Respiratory Tract
Many viral infections are caused by the entry of
the virus through the respiratory tract. The viruses
enter the respiratory tract by droplets containing
the viruses expelled from the nose and mouth of
infected individuals during the act of coughing,
sneezing or talking.
After entry into the body, some viruses are
conﬁned to the respiratory tract, where they mul-
tiply and produce local diseases. These are known
as respiratory viruses. Examples of these viruses
are inﬂuenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus,
rhinovirus,
coronavirus,
adenovirus
and
Coxsackie virus A. Other viruses, after entry,
initially multiply at the site of the respiratory
tract followed by haematogenous or lymphatic
spread to other sites of the body. The viruses
replicate in large numbers at these sites and
cause systemic manifestations of the disease.
Examples of such viruses include measles,
mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovi-
rus and Epstein–Barr virus.
Skin
Many viruses enter the skin through abrasions or
breaks in the skin. Molluscum contagiosum, cow-
pox, vaccinia and variola viruses enter the skin
through minor lesions and produce cutaneous
lesions at the entry site. Other viruses, such as
papillomavirus, enter the skin through minor
injuries on the skin’s surface, arboviruses by the
bite of insects, rabies virus by the bite of dogs and
other animals and hepatitis B virus and HIV by
injection.
Conjunctiva
Some viruses may enter through the conjunctiva
and may cause the disease. For example, adeno-
virus causes local manifestations and measles
virus causes the systemic manifestation of the
disease by entering through the conjunctiva.
Alimentary Tract
The viruses also cause infection by entering
through the alimentary tract, which is another
important route of infection by viruses. The
viruses,
such
as
rotaviruses,
enteroviruses,
adenoviruses, reoviruses, hepatitis viruses and

other gastrointestinal viruses, cause infections of
the gastrointestinal tract and produce disease.
702
48
Introduction to Viruses
Natural barriers against viral infections include
(1) the stomach’s acidity, (2) the alkalinity of the
small intestine and (3) secretory enzymes found
in the saliva and pancreatic secretions. Intestinal
mucus and secretory IgA antibodies are important
and offer partial protection to the intestinal tract.
Enveloped viruses usually fail to establish infec-
tion in the gastrointestinal tract because these are
destroyed by bile secreted in the gastrointestinal
tract.
Genital Tract
Viruses are also transmitted through sexual con-
tact and enter the body through the genital tract.
HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are
sexually transmitted and do not produce any local
lesions in the genital tract but produce systemic
manifestations. Papillomaviruses and herpes sim-
plex viruses (HSVs) are transmitted sexually and
produce lesions locally in the genital tract and
perineum.
Congenital Infections
Few viruses may cause congenital infection in the
foetus in utero being transmitted from the infected
mother.
Rubella
and
cytomegaloviruses
are
viruses that are more commonly associated with
congenital infections. Depending on the age of
the foetus, these viruses may cause malformations
or even foetal death and abortion.
Initiation of Infection at Primary Site
(Infection of the Target Tissue)
On entry into the human host, the viruses may
remain at the primary site of infection, replicate
and cause infection of the target tissue. The spec-
iﬁcity of the virus-attachment proteins and tissue-
speciﬁc expression of receptors during replication
are two important properties of viruses to cause
infection of target tissues.
Many viruses cause infection in the oral
mucosa or upper respiratory tract. Replication of
viruses at the primary sites may be accompanied
by clinical symptoms. On the other hand, some
viruses may disseminate to other tissues through
the bloodstream, lymphatic system and neurons
(secondary sites) and cause a systemic infection.
Replication of Virus and Spread
to Secondary Sites
The viruses are spread in the body mainly by the
bloodstream and the lymphatic system. Transport
of virus in the blood is known as viraemia. After
multiplication in the lymph nodes, the virus enters
the bloodstream, resulting in primary viraemia.
In the bloodstream, the virus may exist free in the
plasma, or it may be ingested by the lymphocytes
or macrophages. In macrophages, the viruses may
die or replicate or may be carried by the mononu-
clear phagocytic system to the spleen and liver.
Replication of the viruses in macrophages, in the
endothelial lining of blood vessels or in the spleen
and liver results in the production of viruses in
large numbers. This leads to a massive spillover
of the virus into the bloodstream, causing second-
ary viraemia. This heralds the onset of clinical
symptoms of viral infections, including the pro-
dromal phase in eruptive fever. Subsequently, it is
carried by the bloodstream to reach target organs
(skin, brain, liver, etc.) in which the viruses repli-
cate, producing characteristic distinctive lesions.
Viruses enter the brain or central nervous sys-
tem (1) through the bloodstream, (2) through the
infected cerebrospinal ﬂuid or meninges and/or
(3) through the infection of the peripheral and
sensory (olfactory) neurons.
Manifestations of the Viral Diseases
The clinical manifestations of viral diseases
depend on the complex interaction of virus and
host factors. The outcome of the infection, that is,
the disease manifestation, depends on the (1) age,
general health and immune status of the person;
(2) dose of the infective virus and (3) genetics of
the host and the virus.
After the virus infects the host, the host’s
immune status plays an important role and
determines the outcome of the viral infection,
whether it will be an asymptomatic infection, a
benign disease or a life-threatening disease.

Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
703
Viral Pathogenesis at the Cellular Level
The host cells show various responses to viral
infection depending on the virus causing the
infection and the type of the cell infected. More-
over, the outcome of infection is determined by
the properties of the virus and the cell. The host
cells may be (1) permissive, (2) semi-permissive
or (3) non-permissive.
A permissive cell is a cell that allows replica-
tion of a particular type of strain of virus by
providing biosynthesis compounds, such as tran-
scriptional
factors
and
post-translational
enzymes. A non-permissive cell does not pro-
vide any biosynthesis compound, hence does not
support replication of the viruses. A semi-per-
missive cell may support some but not all the
stages of viral infection.
Replication of viruses in cells may cause a
broad
spectrum
of
effects,
ranging
from
non-apparent
cellular
damage
to
rapid
cell
destruction. Some viruses may cause cell death
or even cell lysis. For example, polioviruses
cause the death of cells (cytocidal effect) and
even lysis of the cells (cytolysis), molluscum
contagiosum causes proliferation of cells and
oncogenic viruses cause malignant transforma-
tion of cells. Some other viruses may cause
alterations
in
cells’
morphology,
functional
properties, malignant transformation or antigenic-
ity (Table 48.7). In some conditions, viruses
infect cells and replicate independently within
the cells without causing any cellular injury to
the infected cells. This is known as steady-state
infection. The virus produces demonstrable cellu-
lar changes in the infected cells in cell cultures,
known as cytopathic effects (CPEs).

The cellular changes produced by the virus
may be due to many factors. These cellular
changes may be caused (1) by the viral takeover
of macromolecular synthesis of proteins and
enzymes by viruses instead of the host cell,
(2) by the accumulation of virus proteins or
particles or (3) by alteration or disruption of cel-
lular structure.
Production of early or non-structured viral
proteins often inhibits the production of host pro-
tein and the synthesis of host DNA. The accumu-
lation of large amounts of viral proteins or
particles in the infected cells may modify or dis-
rupt the cellular architecture.
At the cellular level, depending on the nature
of the virus and the cell infected, the virus infec-
tion in a cell can produce any of the three
infections (Fig. 48.7): failed infection (abortive
infection), cell death (lytic Infection) or infection
without cell death (persistent viral infection).
Abortive Infection
Some viruses cause failed or abortive infections
in which those viruses do not multiply, and there-
fore disappear from the cell.
Lytic Infection
Some viruses cause cell death or lytic infection.
This occurs due to the replication of the virus in
an infected cell which kills the target cell. The
cellular injury caused by viruses may be due to a

combination of several factors. Viruses adopt dif-
ferent mechanisms (Table 48.8) for preventing
cellular growth and causing cell death as follows.

Inhibition of Cellular Protein Synthesis
HSV, poliovirus, togaviruses and poxviruses
cause cell death by inhibiting cellular protein
synthesis. These viruses, during replication, pro-
duce proteins that inhibit the synthesis of cellular
DNA and/or RNA. These viruses also produce
other proteins, which break down host cellular
DNA to components that serve as substrates for
replication of the viral genome. The accumulation
of large amounts of viral macromolecules and
viral progeny in infected cells during virus repli-
cation may disrupt the cellular structure or
functions of the cell or disrupt lysosomes, causing
autolysis.

results in the expression of glycoproteins on the
cell
surface.
This
triggers
the
fusion
of
neighbouring cells, resulting in the formation of
large multi-nucleated giant cells called syncytia.
The formation of syncytia facilitates the spread of
the virus from cell to cell and allows the virus to
escape from the lytic effect of antibodies.
Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
705
The cell-to-cell fusion of infected cells is of two
types:
Fusion from without In this type, cell fusion
occurs in the absence of new protein synthesis
(e.g.
Sendai
viruses
and
other
Paramyxoviruses).
Fusion from within: In this type, cell fusion
requires new protein synthesis (e.g. HSV).
•
Certain viruses cause alterations in the
cytoplasm of infected cells or lead to the
expression of virus-coded antigens on the
surface of infected cells. For example, the
respiratory syncytial virus causes fusion of
adjacent
cell
membranes,
resulting
in
fusion or syncytia formation.
•
The infected cell may confer new properties
on the cells. For example, infection by the
inﬂuenza virus results in the appearance of
viral
haemagglutinin
on
infected
cell
surfaces,
leading
to
hemadsorption
or
adsorption of erythrocytes to the cell sur-
face. Some viruses cause apoptosis in the
infected cells. Apoptosis leads to cellular
suicide that facilitates the release of viruses
from the cell.
•
Certain viral infections produce character-
istic changes in the properties and appear-
ance of target cells. For example, measles
viruses,
mumps
viruses,
adenoviruses,
cytomegaloviruses and varicella viruses
cause
chromosomal
aberrations
and
degradations.
Infection
by
adenovirus
types 12 and 31 and HSV causes margin-
ated
chromatin
rings
in
the
nuclear
membrane.
Transformation
Transformation is an irreversible genetic process
caused by the integration of viral DNA with the
DNA of the host cell. Infection of cells with
certain viruses causes the transformation of nor-
mal cells into malignant cells. The viruses that
stimulate uncontrolled cell growth causing the
transformation of immortalisation of the cell are
known as oncogenic viruses.
Different oncogenic viruses cause transforma-
tion or immortalisation of the cells by different
mechanisms as follows: (1) they promote or pro-
vide growth-stimulating genes, (2) they prevent
apoptosis and (3) they bring in mechanisms that
limit DNA synthesis and cell growth.
The DNA oncogenic viruses infect semi-
permissive cells, which express only selected
viral genes but do not produce complete viruses.
Most oncogenic DNA viruses integrate with the
host cell chromosome during transformation. For
example, Epstein–Barr virus causes the transfor-
mation of the cells by stimulating cell growth and
inducing the expression of an oncogene (Bcl-2
oncogene)
that
prevents
apoptosis
or
programmed cell death. Other viruses, such as
adenovirus, papillomavirus and SV40, induce
expression of the genes. These genes, such as
P53 and neuroblastoma gene products, encode
proteins that bind and inactivate all growth regu-
latory proteins. Loss of the p53 gene increases the
cell’s susceptibility to mutation, thus releasing the
mechanisms that inhibit cell growth.
The
Human
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus
(HTLV-1) is the only oncogenic retrovirus
known to cause oncogenesis in humans. It
encodes a protein (tax) that transactivates gene
expression, including genes for interleukin-2 and
other growth-stimulating lymphokines. The virus
continues to produce viruses in the transformed
cells.
Leukaemia
associated
with
HTLV-1
develops very slowly, 20–30 years after infection.
Cytopathic Effect
CPE is a term that denotes any visible change in
the appearance of target cells infected by viruses.
Some viruses can be tentatively identiﬁed by the

nature of CPE in cell culture and the types of cells
in which these viruses cause CPE.

Introduction to Viruses
Inclusion bodies are the characteristic histo-
logical feature in virus-infected cells reﬂecting
the change in the appearance of the target cells.
They may result from virus-induced changes in
the membrane or chromosomal structure. They
also represent the sites of viral replication or
accumulation of viral capsids. Inclusion bodies
are the structures with distinct size, shape, loca-
tion and staining properties found in virus-
infected cells. The inclusion bodies may be
found in the nucleus (e.g. herpes virus), cyto-
plasm (e.g. poxvirus) or both (e.g. measles virus).
Intranuclear inclusion bodies are of two types:
Cowdry type A and Cowdry type B. Cowdry type
A inclusion bodies are variable in size and are
produced by infection with the herpes virus and
yellow fever virus. Cowdry type B inclusion bod-
ies are often multiple and more circumscribed and
are produced by adenovirus and poliovirus
infections.

intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies in
the neural cells and are pathognomonic of rabies.
These inclusion bodies may be acidophilic,
which appear as pink structures when stained
with Giemsa or eosin–methylene blue stains.
They may be basophilic as produced by some
viruses, such as adenovirus. Demonstration of
inclusion bodies is characteristic of a particular
viral infection; the presence of such bodies
facilitates laboratory diagnosis. Guarneri bodies
are small, multiple inclusions found in vaccinia-
infected
cells.

Persistent Viral Infection
The persistent viral infection is characterised by
viral infection without cell death. The persistent
viral infection is caused by the slow and gradual
release of viruses from the infected cell through
exocytosis or budding from the plasma mem-
brane. The persistent viral infections may be
(1) non-lytic and productive (chronic), (2) latent,
limited production of viral macromolecules in the
absence of synthesis of the virus, (3) recurrent or
(4) transforming.
HSV typically causes a latent infection in
neurons lacking the machinery to transcribe the
early viral genes essential for virus replication.
However, stress and other stimuli activate the
successful replication of the virus, resulting in
the infection.

Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
707
Certain DNA viruses may cause infection of
the cell, resulting in a latent or immortalising
infection. This occurs due to the failure of the
biosynthesis machinery of viruses for transcribing
all the viral genes. The speciﬁc transcription fac-
tor needed of such a virus may be expressed in
growing cells or speciﬁc tissues or after treatment
with hormones or cytokines.
Host Response to Viral Infections
The main goal of the host response in viral infec-
tion is to eliminate the virus and eliminate the
infected cells harbouring or replicating the virus.
The
host
responds
by
immunological
and
non-speciﬁc means. The immune response is the
best and most important means of controlling
virus infections.
Immunity in Viral Infections
Protection against viral infections is induced by
both
humoral
and
cell-mediated
immunities
(CMI). Infection by the virus and subsequent
replication induces immunity in the host against
a wide range of virus antigens, including the viral
internal
and
surface
antigens,
non-structural
antigens and early proteins (Table 48.10).
Humoral Immunity
The humoral immunity mediated by antibodies
plays an important role against infections caused
by extracellular viruses and viraemia’s caused by
those viruses. Humoral immunity also inhibits the
multiplication
of
cytolytic
viruses.
The
circulating IgG and IgM antibodies are effective
against viruses in blood and tissue spaces, while
IgA plays an important role against viruses
replicating on the mucosal surfaces.

T-cells and antibody
The antibodies act against viruses in many
ways. They prevent the adsorption of the virus
to the cell receptor at the primary site of infection.
They also cause rapid degradation of viruses and
prevent the release of viral progeny from infected
cells. The antibodies in combination with com-
plement cause damage to the enveloped viruses
resulting in cytolysis of virus-infected cells.
The antibodies against surface antigens are
usually more effective than against internal
antigens. The antibodies produced against surface
antigens also vary in their ability to reduce the
infectivity of viruses. For example, the ant
haemagglutinin antibodies produced against the
haemagglutinin antigen of the inﬂuenza virus
neutralise infectivity of the inﬂuenza virus,
while ant neuraminidase antibodies against neur-
aminidase antigen are not effective in neutralising
the infectivity of the virus. However, the anti-
neuraminidase antibody helps prevent the release
of the virion progeny from infected cells.
Although protective, humoral antibodies may
cause injuries to host cells and contribute to the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease.
For
example,
antibodies in combination with complements ini-
tiate an immune complex disease in infections
caused by hepatitis B virus and rubella viruses.
Interferons and lymphokines stimulate ﬂu-like
symptoms in respiratory virus infections and
viraemia caused by arboviruses.
Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI)
CMI plays a very important role in viral
infections. CMI is essential for the lysis of target
cells in the infections caused by enveloped

viruses and non-cytolytic infections caused by the
hepatitis A virus. Individuals with deﬁcient cellu-
lar immunity are more susceptible to infection by
viruses, such as herpes virus, measles virus and
poxvirus. CMI also plays a major role in recovery
from viral infections. A deﬁcient CMI results in
failure to resolve the infection, which may lead to
persistent viral infection, chronic disease and
even death of the patient.
708
48
Introduction to Viruses
CMI also contributes to the pathogenesis of
diseases by inducing T-cell-induced inﬂamma-
tory and hypersensitivity reactions. For example,
CMI-induced inﬂammatory response is responsi-
ble for the typical clinical manifestation of mea-
sles and mumps rather than CPEs of viruses. In
dengue
haemorrhagic
fever,
antigen-speciﬁc
T-cells and speciﬁc antibodies induce signiﬁcant
inﬂammatory and hypersensitivity damage to
infected
endothelial
cells,
leading
to
haemorrhage. Antigen-speciﬁc T-cells are also
responsible for inducing post-infection cytolysis
in the infection caused by enveloped viruses, such
as the measles virus. T-cells, macrophages and
polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes induce a
delayed type hypersensitivity and inﬂammation
in many viral infections caused by enveloped
viruses.
Infection by some viruses is usually associated
with suppressed host immunity; for example,
infection by measles virus causes a temporary
depression of delayed hypersensitivity to tubercu-
lin antigen, and infection by HIV causes a
depressed CMI following depletion of CD4+
helper T-cells.
Once infected by a virus, it usually confers
lifelong immunity to re-infection. In some viral
infections, such as inﬂuenza or the common cold,
the immunity is not lifelong because the infection
is caused by antigenically different strains of the
same virus.
Non-immunological Responses
These include many factors as follows:
Phagocytosis
During viral infections, the role of polymorpho-
nuclears (PMN) is insigniﬁcant. In fact, during
most viral infections, decrease in PMN count is
obvious. However, macrophages help clear off
viruses from the bloodstream by phagocytosis.
Age
Age is the most important factor in determining
the host’s susceptibility to viral infections. Most
viral infections are common and more serious in
persons at extremes of age, such as infants, chil-
dren and the elderly. Infants and children are
more susceptible to various respiratory and
exanthematous viral diseases. They are prone to
more serious diseases caused by a paramyxovi-
rus, respiratory infections, etc. Similarly, elderly
people are susceptible to new viral infections (the
new strains of inﬂuenza A and B virus) and
re-activation of the latent viruses (e.g. varicella-
zoster virus).
Poor Nutrition
Poor nutrition or malnutrition affects the infected
person’s
immune
system
because
tissue-
regenerating capacity is usually decreased in a
person with malnutrition. In such persons, some
viral infection (such as measles) causes immuno-
suppression, thereby facilitating the replication of
viruses in large numbers. This results in a serious
disease associated with more serious and fatal
complications.
Genetic Makeup
A person’s genetic makeup also plays an impor-
tant role in determining the outcome of viral
infection.
Genetic
differences
in
immune
response genes and genetic defects in other
genetic loci affect the susceptibility of the host
to viral infection, as well as the severity of
infection.
Body Temperature
Fever is a common manifestation of many viral
infections. Fever acts as a natural defence mecha-
nism against viral infections as a higher tempera-
ture above 39 C inhibits many viruses.

Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
709
Interferons
Interferons were initially observed more than
centuries ago by Isaacs and Lindenmann in
1957. They noticed the production of a diffusible
substance by the chicken chorioallantoic mem-
brane treated with live or inactivated inﬂuenza
virus, which had antiviral activity. Subsequently,
these virus-infected cells were found to be resis-
tant to viral infection. These interferons are a
heterogeneous
and
complex
group
of
glycoproteins produced by cells on induction of
infection by viral or non-viral microbial agents.
These interferons show antiviral activity by
inhibiting protein synthesis. Later studies on
interferon demonstrated that interferon produc-
tion is a natural defence mechanism by vertebrate
hosts against viral infection.
Interferons’ antiviral action occurs by complex
interactions with host cell functions, which may
vary based on the type of virus being inhibited.
Host cells produce a protein called translation
inhibiting protein (TIP) when exposed to inter-
feron, which speciﬁcally inhibits translation of
viral mRNA without disturbing the cellular
mRNA. TIP is a mixture of three enzymes: pro-
tein kinase, an RNase and oligonucleotide syn-
thetase, which block the mRNA translation.
Interferons exert antiviral effects by several
pathways. First, they cause increased expression
of class I and class II major histocompatibility
complex
(MHC)
glycoproteins,
thereby
facilitating the recognition of viral antigens by
the immune system. Second, they activate the
cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and
macrophages, that can destroy virus-infected tar-
get cells. Finally, they directly inhibit the replica-
tion of viruses.
Interferons are also produced by leucocytes
and many other cells in response to infection by
virus, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), endotoxin
and mutagenic and antigenic stimuli. The dsRNA
is a potent stimulator. The viruses that replicate
slowly and those that do not inhibit the synthesis
of host proteins are usually good inducers of the
interferons. IFN-7 differs from other interferons
in being released as lymphokines from activated
T-cells, natural killer cells and occasionally
macrophages. Interferon production is inhibited
by steroids and increased oxygen tension and
temperature (40 C). Synthesis begins in less
than an hour and peaks in 8–12 h.
Types of Interferons
Interferons have been classiﬁed based on the type
of receptor through which they signal antigenic
character, cell of origin and other properties.
There are three types of interferons: alpha, beta
and gamma. The abbreviation of IFN designates
interferon, and species of origin is indicated as a
preﬁx. For example, human interferon-alpha is
usually abbreviated as HuIFN-α.
IFN-α is a non-glycosylated protein produced
by leucocytes following induction with suitable
viruses, and it was previously called leucocyte
interferon. It has at least 16 antigenic subtypes.
IFN-β is a glycoprotein molecule produced by
ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells after the stimula-
tion by viruses or polypeptides; it is commonly
known as ﬁbroblast interferon. T lymphocytes
and NK cells produce IFN-γ after stimulating
sensitised
lymphocytes
with
antigen
or
non-sensitised lymphocytes with mitogens. It
has lymphokine and immunoregulatory functions
rather than antiviral activity. It enhances the
MHC
antigen
and
activates
cytotoxic
T
lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells. It is
commonly known as immune interferon, and it
is a glycoprotein molecule. It has a separate cell
receptor, but IFN-α and IFN-β do not possess
separate cell receptors.
The proteolytic enzymes help in the inactiva-
tion of interferons, but other enzymes, such as
nucleases or lipases, do not have this property.
IFN-α and -β are potent antiviral agents; when a
cell becomes infected with a virus, they are
synthesised. They induce the production of three
enzymes, namely synthetase, RNase L and pro-
tein kinase. This leads to inhibition of viral pro-
tein synthesis but does not affect the host protein
synthesis. The main properties of the interferons
include resistance to heating at high temperatures
(56–60 C for 30–60 min) and stability over a
wide range of pH (2–10), but the exception is
IFN-γ which is labile at pH 2. The molecular

weight of interferons is about 17,000 Da, and they
are
non-dialysable
and
nonsedimentable
(100,000 g). There is no routine serological test
available for their detection and estimation
because
they
have
very
poor
antigenicity.
Interferons are estimated based on biological
activity. For example, in plaque assay, the ability
of a sensitive virus to inhibit plaque formation can
be calculated. International units (IU)/mL are
used to evaluate the potency of IFN.
710

Introduction to Viruses
Clinical Applications of Interferons
Interferons are increasingly being used to treat
chronic hepatitis B and C virus carriers at risk
for progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma. When given with ribavirin, the inter-
feron has proved to be more effective than inter-
feron alone to treat hepatitis C virus infection.
Currently, synthetic IFN-α is actively used
against hepatitis A, B and C viruses, papillomavi-
rus; HSV and rhinovirus. It is also used for the
treatment of condylomata acuminatum. IFN-β has
been used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
IFN-γ has been tried to treat the chronic granulo-
matous
disease
characterised
by
severe
impairment of the ability of phagocytes to kill
the ingested organism.
Clinical Manifestations of Viral Diseases
The clinical manifestations of viral diseases
depend on a complex interaction of virus and
host factors. These include (1) the age, general
health and immune status of the person; (2) the
dose of the infective virus and (3) the genetics of
the host and the virus.
After a virus infects a host, the host’s immune
status plays an important role and determines the
outcome of the viral infection—whether it will be
an asymptomatic infection, a benign disease or a
life-threatening disease.
Incubation Period
It is the time taken by the virus to spread from the
site of entry to the organs of virus replication and
then to the target organs for the production of
lesions. Therefore, the duration of the incubation
period depends on the (1) time taken for the site of
entry, (2) multiplication and (3) lesions. The incu-
bation period is the important initial period before
the manifestation of characteristic symptoms of
the disease. During this period, virus replicates in
the host’s body but has not reached the target
tissue or caused sufﬁcient damage in the host’s
tissues to cause the disease.
Signiﬁcance of pncubation period: The incu-
bation period for many viral diseases is variable.
It is short (1–3 days) in the infections caused by
respiratory viruses or gastroenteritis caused by an
enteric virus, in which both the site of entry and
lesions are the same. On the other hand, the
incubation
period
is
longer
(usually
10–20 days) in systemic diseases in which
viruses enter through the respiratory or alimentary
tract and produce lesions in different target tissues
away from the site of entry. However, it may be
relatively shorter in some systemic viral diseases,
such as yellow fever or dengue fever (5–6 days).
The incubation period may still be longer (2–
6 months) in hepatitis B virus infection or even
years in slow virus infection.
Incubation periods of common DNA and RNA
viruses’
viral
infections
are
summarised
in
Tables 48.11 and 48.12, respectively. In some
viral infections, the incubation period may pro-
ceed without symptoms, causing asymptomatic
infections
or
may
cause
non-speciﬁc
early
symptoms known as the prodrome.
Severity of the Viral Disease
It depends on the site of viral infection and the
immunopathological responses induced follow-
ing the viral infection. It may be (1) an inapparent
infection, (2) an acute infection or (3) a chronic or
persistent infection.
Inapparent Infection is usually caused if
(1) the infection is controlled before the virus
reaches the target tissues, (2) the infected tissue is
not damaged, (3) the tissue is damaged but it is
rapidly repaired or (4) the severity of damage is
below a functional threshold for the particular
disorder. The inapparent infections are detected
usually by serological tests detecting speciﬁc
viral
antibodies
in
the
infected
host.

Epidemiologically, the patients with inapparent or
asymptomatic infection serve as the major source
of infection.

The onset of the acute or chronic viral disease
depends on the ability of the immune system of
the infected host to control and resolve the viral
infection. If the immune system acts rapidly, the
infection may result in acute disease. If the
immune system fails to act effectively or slowly,
it may result in chronic viral disease. Slow virus
infections have typically long incubation periods
of many years before progressing to the manifes-
tation of the disease.
Epidemiology of Viral Infections
Geographical distribution of the viral infections
depends on (1) the presence of vectors for the
transmission of disease, (2) co-factors facilitating
the transmission of disease and (3) the presence of
susceptible populations in the particular area. For
example, the presence of suitable arthropod
vectors for a particular virus in large numbers
increases the risk of a high prevalence of viral
disease in that community. Viral diseases also
show seasonal differences; for example, enteric
viruses are more prevalent in the summer due to
poor hygiene and contaminated water because of
a shortage of water supply. Similarly, respiratory
viruses are more prevalent during winter due to
overcrowding which facilitates the spread of the
viruses.
The viral infection in a community may occur
as (1) outbreak, (2) epidemic or (3) as a pandemic.
The viral disease outbreak usually occurs from a
common source, for example, infected food and is
seen only in clusters of people. Epidemics of
viral infection, in contrast, occur in a large geo-
graphical area. An epidemic usually occurs due to
introducing a new strain of virus into an immuno-
logically susceptible population (e.g. inﬂuenza
epidemic). Pandemics are usually worldwide
epidemics resulting from introducing a new
virus, for example, HIV. Pandemics of inﬂuenza
have occurred due to the introduction of new
strains of inﬂuenza viruses.

Introduction to Viruses
Infected
humans
are
usual
reservoirs
of
viruses. They serve as a source of infection for
other susceptible hosts (HIV, poliomyelitis, etc.).
Asymptomatic patients are an important source of
infection. In HIV and varicella-zoster virus
infections, the viruses are usually released before
the manifestations of the symptoms. Viruses
changing the antigenic structure of their genome,
such as inﬂuenza and HIV, infect many immuno-
logically naive populations. Rhinovirus and other
viruses with many different types similarly cause
infection in a large number of susceptible
persons.
For many other viral diseases, animals also act
as reservoirs. Viral infections transmitted from
these animal reservoirs to humans are called zoo-
notic viral diseases. For example, rabies is a zoo-
notic viral disease, and the infection is transmitted
from the infected dogs, bats, foxes, cats, etc., to
humans. Mosquitoes, ticks and sand ﬂies are the
arthropods that act as vectors for transmission of
togaviruses,
ﬂaviviruses,
bunyaviruses
and
reoviruses. These viruses, hence, are called
arboviruses (from arthropod-borne viruses).
The mode of transmission of the virus depends
on the (1) site of virus replication and secretions
and (2) the presence or absence of an envelope in
the viruses.
1. The site of virus replication and secretions:
The viruses that replicate in the intestinal tract
are excreted in the faeces and are transmitted
by the faecal–oral route (e.g. picornavirus and
reovirus). The viruses that replicate in the
respiratory tract, such as the inﬂuenza virus,
are secreted in aerosol droplets and transmitted
by inhalation.
2. Presence or absence of envelope in the
viruses: The enveloped viruses are relatively
fragile viruses that require the presence of
intact envelopes for their infectivity. These
viruses are usually transmitted by respiratory
droplets, saliva, mucus, blood or semen, organ
transplantation and ingestion. As they are sen-
sitive to the presence of acid and detergent,
many of the enveloped viruses are destroyed
rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract of the
infected humans and hence are not transmitted
by the faecal–oral route. Hepatitis B virus and
coronavirus are exceptions transmitted by the
faecal–oral route.
Non-enveloped viruses are relatively sturdy
viruses. These can resist drying, extremes of pH
and temperature and the effects of detergents.
Therefore, these non-enveloped viruses withstand
the acidity of the stomach and the lytic effect of
bile in the intestine and mild disinfectants and
insufﬁcient sewage techniques. Therefore, these
viruses are generally transmitted by the respira-
tory
and
faecal–oral
routes
and
often
by
contaminated
objects
(fomites).
Hepatitis
A
virus is a common example of an enveloped
virus
transmitted
by
the
faecal–oral
route.
Rhinoviruses and many other non-enveloped
viruses are examples of viruses that are transmit-
ted
by
contact
with
fomites,
such
as
handkerchiefs, towels, bed linens, etc.
Prevention and Control of Viral Diseases
The viral diseases can be prevented, and the
spread of viruses can be controlled by (1) adoption
of good hygiene, (2) control of the vectors and
(3)
immunisation
of
the
population.
Immunisation of the population by vaccines is
the
best
means
to
control
many
diseases.
Vaccines
are
available
against
many
viral
diseases (poliomyelitis, rabies, etc.). These pro-
tect the population against infection by viruses.
Immunoprophylaxis of Viral Diseases
Immunoprophylaxis indicates developing immu-
nologic protection against the viral disease either
by vaccination (active prophylaxis) or antibodies
cocktail (passive prophylaxis).
Active
prophylaxis:
Different
types
of
antiviral vaccines have been developed that spe-
ciﬁcally induce the body’s cell-mediated immune
response and provide steady protection against
invading viruses. Most of the ﬁrst-generation
vaccines were attenuated or killed types. How-
ever, novel advancements in this ﬁeld have led to

the development of recombinant protein DNA
vaccines.
Latest
to
the
vaccine
depository,
mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have
emerged strong and showcased excellent protec-
tion against the viruses. Many antiviral vaccines
are now approved for use globally and have been
recommended as essential for inclusion in the
childhood vaccination schedule.
Passive prophylaxis: Passive anaphylaxis by
antibodies cocktail, on the other hand, provides
Pathogenesis of Viral Infections
713
humoral protection against a viral disease at the
time when an individual has been infected or
expected to be infected soon (for, e.g. due to
travel to virus prone region). Cocktails of
antiviral antibodies are administered that provide
short-term protection till the antibodies circulate
in the body and do not contribute to the genera-
tion of memory response of the immune system.

Antiviral Agents
49
The viruses, unlike most bacteria, are obligate
intracellular pathogens that use biosynthesis
mechanisms and enzymes of the host cells for
replication. Earlier, it was feared that it might
not be possible to inhibit virus replication without
also being toxic to host cells. Current antiviral
drugs are used successfully to treat a few viral
diseases without causing much toxicity or serious
side effects.
The ﬁrst antiviral drugs to be used were like
selective poisons that targeted cells with intensive
DNA and RNA syntheses. However, recently
used antiviral drugs act speciﬁcally against
virus-coded enzymes or structures of the virus
that are important for replication of the viruses.
Methisazone (Marboran) was the ﬁrst antiviral
drug used clinically to treat poxvirus infection in
1960s effectively. The compound was used suc-
cessfully against eczema vaccinatum and small-
pox. Subsequently, in 1962, an antineoplastic
agent, idoxuridine, was found to be effective for
treating herpetic eye infection, and amantadine
(a molecule with an unusual structure) was
found effective for the treatment of inﬂuenza A
virus. In the 1970s, acyclovir (ACV) was used
most successfully to treat herpes virus infection
by administering the drug parenterally. Subse-
quently,
many
antiviral
agents
have
been
distributed for use against many viral infections,
including the human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV).

Mechanism of Action
of Antiviral Drugs
Recently, many antiviral drugs have been devel-
oped against viruses associated with high morbid-
ity and mortality in humans. These viruses
provide potential targets during the replication
cycle for action by antiviral drugs. They may
inhibit the viral infection at the level of (1) attach-
ment, (2) penetration and uncoating, (3) transcrip-
tion of viral nucleic acid, (4) translation of viral
mRNA, (5) protein synthesis, (6) replication of
viral DNA, (7) nucleoside biosynthesis and
nucleoside scavenging and (8) assembly and
release of viral progeny. Mechanisms of action
of antiviral agents against the possible targets are
summarised in Table 49.1.
Classification of Antiviral Drugs
The antiviral compounds vary greatly in com-
plexity and include nucleoside analogues, syn-
thetic
oligonucleotides,
oligosaccharides
and
also natural products of plants and some inor-
ganic and organic compounds. The antiviral
agents available against viruses can be classiﬁed
as (1) nucleoside analogues, (2) non-nucleoside
polymerase inhibitors, (3) protease inhibitors,
(4) neuraminidase inhibitors, (5) M2 channel
blockers and (6) interferons.

Nucleoside Analogues
Numerous
analogues
of
naturally
occurring
nucleosides have been synthesised in the labora-
tory to use against viruses possibly. These nucle-
oside analogues that act by inhibiting the enzyme
viral polymerase are generally activated by phos-
phorylation by cellular or viral kinases.

Nucleoside analogues cause selective inhibi-
tion of virus replication (1) by binding better to
viral DNA polymerase rather than to the cellular
DNA polymerase and (2) by being utilised more
extensively in virus-infected cells due to the
more rapid synthesis of DNA in infected cells.
The commonly used nucleoside analogues are
acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir,
ganciclovir,
azidothymidine
(AZT),
ribavirin
and
dideoxynucleosides
(dideoxyinosine,
dideoxycytidine, stavudine and lamivudine).
Acyclovir (ACV) is a synthetic guanine
nucleoside
analogue.
It
differs
from
the
nucleoside guanosine by having an acyclic
(hydroxyethoxymethyl) chain instead of a ribose
or deoxyribose sugar. The ACV has selective
action against herpes viruses, such as herpes sim-
plex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus. It acts
through the viral enzyme thymidine kinase,
encoded by these herpes viruses.
ACV that is well absorbed. Its bioavailability is
The ACV is used to treat HSV infections, such
as HSV encephalitis, disseminated herpes and
other serious life-threatening manifestations of
herpes infections. The compound inhibits HSV
replication in infected host cells but is ineffective
to resolve the latent HSV infection. The ACV at
higher doses is also effective against varicella-
zoster virus (VZV) infections. The compound is
less effective against this virus because ACV is
phosphorylated less efﬁciently by the VZV thy-
midine kinase.
Valacyclovir is the valyl ester derivative of

2–5 times more than ACV and is usually
recommended to treat and suppress genital herpes
infection.
Mechanism of Action of Antiviral Drugs
717
Penciclovir is a guanosine analogue. It has a
higher afﬁnity for HSV thymidine kinase than
ACV but has a lower afﬁnity for HSV DNA
polymerase than ACV. It acts by inhibiting viral
DNA polymerase and also as a chain terminator.
It is used for the treatment of genital herpes infec-
tion. Penciclovir is effective for the treatment of
both HSV and VZV. After administration, the
drug is available in more quantity and persists
longer
in
infected
cells
than
ACV.
The
penciclovir also has some antiviral activity
against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–
Barr virus.
Ganciclovir is a guanine nucleoside chemi-
cally related to ACV. It differs from ACV in
having a single hydroxymethyl group in the acy-
clic side chain. It acts as a chain terminator in the
subsequent termination of viral DNA replication.
It is highly effective against all herpes viruses,
including cytomegalovirus. It is more active
against CMV than ACV. It is more useful in
treating severe CMV infections in immunocom-
promised hosts, such as acquired immunodeﬁ-
ciency syndrome (AIDS). Ganciclovir resistance
is a noted problem of therapy.
Azidothymidine (AZT) is the synthetic ana-
logue of thymidine and was the ﬁrst useful
antiviral agent to be reported to treat HIV infec-
tion. It acts by blocking the synthesis of pro-viral
DNA by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase.
The latter is 100 times more susceptible to inhibi-
tion by AZT than host cellular DNA polymerase.
AZT is widely used for the treatment of HIV
infection. It is currently used to manage HIV with
reduced CD4 T-cell counts (400–500 or less) to
prevent the progression of the disease. It is also
used for the treatment of pregnant HIV-infected
women. It has been shown to reduce or prevent
the transmission of HIV from the mother to the
baby. The drug, however, is toxic and costly. The
emergence of resistance to AZT is also a worri-
some problem.
Ribavirin is a synthetic analogue of the nucle-
oside guanosine. Ribavirin triphosphate is the
active form of the drug. It differs from guanosine
by having a base ring that is incomplete and open.
Ribavirin is effective against many DNA and
RNA viruses. It acts mainly by preventing repli-
cation of the viruses by inhibiting nucleotide bio-
synthesis, mRNA capping and other processes
essential for virus replication.
When administered as an aerosol, ribavirin has
been shown to effectively treat a severe respira-
tory syncytial viral infection in children and treat
severe inﬂuenza and measles in adults. Intrave-
nous ribavirin is also effective for treating
infections caused by inﬂuenza B virus, Rift Val-
ley virus, Lassa, Crimean–Congo and other
haemorrhagic
fevers.
In
combination
with
interferon-alpha (IFN-α), Ribavirin is shown to
be effective against the infection caused by the
hepatitis C virus.
Dideoxynucleosides,
the
analogues
of
nucleosides, have been synthesised for use
against HIV. These agents (e.g. dideoxyinosine,
dideoxycytidine,
stavudine
and
lamivudine)
inhibit HIV replication by blocking the enzyme
reverse transcriptase. These compounds inhibit
the enzyme reverse transcriptase by preventing
DNA chain elongation. These compounds are
usually recommended for the treatment of AIDS
in patients not responding to therapy with AZT.
These are also used in combination with AZT for
treatment of the AIDS cases.
Other nucleoside analogues consist of sev-
eral compounds, including idoxuridine, triﬂuor-
othymidine, ﬂuorouracil and adenine arabinoside.
These are analogues of thymidine. They inhibit
synthesis and replication of viruses (1) by
inhibiting the synthesis of thymidine, a nucleic
acid essential for the synthesis of viral DNA or
(2) by replacing thymidine with itself in the viral
DNA. These are effective against viruses such as
herpes simplex virus (HSV), replication of which
is associated with the synthesis of a large volume
of viral DNA. Recently, many other nucleoside
analogues have been evaluated as antiviral agents
for the treatment of infections caused by HIV,
hepatitis B virus and herpes viruses.
Non-Nucleoside Polymerase Inhibitors
Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors include
foscarnet and related phosphonoacetic acid.

These inhibitors inhibit the replication of viruses
by binding to the pyrophosphate-binding site of
the DNA polymerase to block the binding of
nucleotides. Foscarnet speciﬁcally inhibits DNA
polymerase of all herpes viruses and reverse tran-
scriptase of HIV. The compound has also shown
antiviral activity against the hepatitis B virus.
718
49
Antiviral Agents
Nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz are
the other non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors
with different mechanisms of action. They bind
to sites on the enzyme different from the sub-
strate. These compounds are usually given in
combination with other nucleoside analogues to
delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistance
in HIV.
Protease Inhibitors
Saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelﬁnavir and
amprenavir are some of the examples of protease
inhibitors. These agents act speciﬁcally on the
unique structure of HIV protease, which is essen-
tial for the production of a functional HIV. Human
immunodeﬁciency virus strains showing resis-
tance to these drugs occur through mutation of
the HIV protease. Hence, a combination of prote-
ase inhibitor with AZT and a nucleoside analogue
is usually recommended to reduce replication of
viruses to minimum undetectable levels.
Other Antiviral Drugs
Amantadine (Adamantanamine hydrochloride,
symmetrel) and rimantadine are anti-inﬂuenza
drugs
useful
for
treating
inﬂuenza
virus
infections. These are not effective for the treat-
ment of inﬂuenza B or C viruses. These act spe-
ciﬁcally against the inﬂuenza A virus by their
ability to bind and block protein channels by the
matrix protein (M2) of the inﬂuenza A virus.
Resistance to these drugs occurs due to mutations,
resulting in changed M2 matrix protein or
haemagglutinin protein.
Amantadine and rimantadine are useful in
reducing the severity of inﬂuenza A infection if
taken within 48 h of exposure. They are also
useful as prophylactic agents in treating inﬂuenza
A infection. Amantadine is also used for the treat-
ment of Parkinson’s disease. The drug, however,
is toxic to the central nervous system.
Zanamivir
(Relenza)
and
oseltamivir
(Tamiﬂu) are antiviral compounds with clinical
efﬁcacy against inﬂuenza A and B viruses. They
are potent inhibitors of inﬂuenza neuraminidase.
Without the production of the enzyme neuramin-
idase, the haemagglutinin of the virus binds to
sialic acid on other viral particles, forming clumps
and thereby preventing the release of virus
particles. Both the agents have demonstrated efﬁ-
cacy in several clinical trials with minimal side
effects. If taken within 48 h of infection, these
drugs reduce the duration of illness.
Interferon
There are three classes of interferon: (1) inter-
feron-alpha (IFN-α), (2) interferon beta (IFN-β)
and (3) interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). IFN-α occurs
as at least 15 subtypes, the genes for which show
85% homology. Interferons are produced by
leukocytes and many other cells in response to
infection
by
virus,
double-stranded
RNA
(dsRNA), endotoxin and mutagenic and antigenic
stimuli. The dsRNA is a potent stimulator.
The viruses that replicate slowly and viruses
that do not inhibit the synthesis of host proteins
are usually good inducers of the interferons.
IFN-γ differs from other interferons in being
released as lymphokines from activated T cells,
natural
killer
cells
and
occasionally
from
macrophages.
Interferons exert antiviral effects by several
pathways. They cause increased expression of
class I and class II MHC (major histocompatibil-
ity complex) glycoproteins, thereby facilitating
the recognition of viral antigens by the immune
system. They also activate the cells, such as
natural killer cells and macrophages, the cells
that can destroy virus-infected targets. In addition
to these, they directly inhibit the replication of
viruses.
Interferons are increasingly being used to treat
chronic hepatitis B and C virus carriers at risk of
progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carci-
noma. When given with ribavirin, the interferon
has proved to be more effective than interferon
alone to treat hepatitis C virus infection. Cur-
rently, synthetic IFN-α is actively used against
hepatitis A, B and C viruses, papilloma virus;

HSV and rhinovirus. It is also used for the treat-
ment of condylomata acuminatum.
Mechanism of Action of Antiviral Drugs
719
Resistance to Antiviral Agents
Reduced susceptibility of a particular antiviral
during laboratory tests indicates the development
of resistance phenotype in the virus. Resistance
can be deﬁned as a reduction in susceptibility to
the drug in a laboratory culture system. It is
expressed as an altered IC50 or IC90. It causes
great public health concerns for infection man-
agement,
reducing
efﬁciencies
of
medical
countermeasures. Soon after the emergence of
antiviral resistance viruses, it replaces susceptible
phenotype from the environment and become
predominant.
The
development
of
the
resistance
is
multifaced and depends on the virus and the
change in antiviral targets. Some of the potential
mechanisms
of
antiviral
resistances
are
mentioned.
1. Resistance to the acyclovir, valacyclovir
and famciclovir drugs (choice for Herpes
simplex virus treatment) targets viral DNA
due to mutations in the viral TK or DNA
polymerase. A frameshift mutation in the
genome due to the addition or deletion of
nucleotides results in TK function loss. It
makes the target modiﬁed where the antiviral
could not work, thereby resisting the virus.
2. Resistance to the ganciclovir (used to treat
CMV infection) is due to the mutations in the
viral
UL97
kinase
gene.
The
mutation
decreases the phosphorylation of ganciclovir
and gives protection to the virus from its
action; and
3. Conformational changes also confer drug
resistance. For example, reverse transcriptase
domains of Hepatitis B virus polymerase gene
when
changes
conformation
effectively
prevents actions of nucleotide and nucleoside
analogue antivirals like lamivudine, entecavir,
adefovir and tenofovir.

Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Diseases 50
The clinical manifestations may be protean and
nonspeciﬁc for many of the viral infections. How-
ever, they provide a clue in diagnosing viral
infections by excluding common bacterial, para-
sitic, fungal diseases, etc. Laboratory diagnosis,
therefore, plays an important role in conﬁrming
the viral aetiology of suspected viral diseases.
Laboratory diagnosis for viral diseases is
performed to (1) conﬁrm the viral aetiology of
diseases for which antiviral chemotherapeutic
agents are available, (2) screen blood donors for
blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B
and C, human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV),
etc., to prevent transmission of infection by trans-
fusion
of
blood
and
blood-borne
products
contaminated by viruses, (3) deﬁne the viral dis-
ease process, (4) perform seroepidemiological
studies of viral infections and (5) monitor and
detect epidemics of serious virus infections,
such as inﬂuenza, encephalitis and poliomyelitis,
etc.,
earlier
to
initiate
appropriate
control
measures to prevent further spread of these
diseases.
Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections can be
carried out by many methods. These methods
include: (1) direct detection of viruses/viral
antigens, (2) demonstration of virus-induced
cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the cells, (3) virus
isolation, (4) viral assays, (5) detection of viral
proteins and other enzymes, (6) detection of the
viral genome and (7) viral serology (Fig. 50.1).

Specimens
The collection of appropriate clinical specimens
depends on the type of the viral disease. The tests
of clinical specimens to be collected for diagnosis
of other types of viral diseases are summarised in
Table 50.1.
The timing of the collection of specimens is
important. The specimens collected early in the
acute stage of infection—before the shedding of
the virus is stopped—are most important. For
example, enteroviruses are present in the CSF
for only 2–3 days after the onset of CNS
manifestations.
Herpes
simplex
virus
and
varicella-zoster virus are found in lesions only
within the ﬁrst 5 days of onset of symptoms,
and respiratory viruses are present in respiratory
secretions during only the ﬁrst 3–7 days of onset
of symptoms.
Immediate transport of the specimen to the
laboratory for processing also facilitates better
isolation of virus from clinical specimens. The
viruses are usually heat-labile, and the clinical
specimens may be infected secondarily by con-
tamination with bacteria and fungi. Hence, clini-
cal specimens for viruses are usually transported
and stored in ice. They are transported in special
transport media containing antibiotics to inhibit
bacterial and fungal contaminants and contain


proteins, such as serum albumin or gelatin. Some
of the viruses, such as inﬂuenza virus, HSV and
VZV, lose their infectious titre when clinical
specimens are stored at room temperature or
kept frozen at
20 C.

Direct Detection of Viruses/Viral
Antigens
Viruses/viral antigens can be detected directly in
clinical specimens by electron microscopy (EM),
ﬂuorescence microscopy and light microscopy.
Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy (EM) is the most commonly
used method for detecting viruses in clinical
specimens and biopsies to diagnose many viral
diseases. Electron microscopy is used for detec-
tion of (1) rotaviruses and herpes virus in stool
samples,
(2)
herpes
virus
in
brain
biopsy
specimens,
(3)
poxvirus
in
vesicle
ﬂuid,
(4) virus in cell cultures and (5) Nipah viruses in
infected tissues by immune electron microscopy.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Using
speciﬁc
monoclonal
or
polyclonal
antibodies, direct ﬂuorescence microscopy is
employed to detect viral antigens on the cell sur-
face or within the cells infected by viruses. The
viral antigens can be detected in the acetone-ﬁxed
cell smears, the frozen tissue sections of the cells
from virus-infected cells and the vesicular ﬂuid.
The test has been employed for (1) antemortem
diagnosis of rabies by detection of rabies virus
antigen in smears from the face or nape of the
neck; (2) demonstration of viral antigens in brain
biopsy specimens for diagnosis of herpes simplex
encephalitis and subacute sclerosing encephalitis


and (3) rapid diagnosis of infections caused by
adenoviruses,
paramyxoviruses
and
orthomyxoviruses.
Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
723
Light Microscopy
Guarnieri bodies of smallpox virus can be seen in
the vesicular ﬂuids by Giemsa stain. Viral
antigens in infected cell cultures are demonstrated
by immunoperoxidase staining. The Negri bodies
can also be demonstrated in neural tissues of the
brain by Sellers’ stain.
Demonstration of Virus-induced CPEs
in the Cells
Many viruses produce characteristic morphologi-
cal changes in the cells they infect. These changes
are known as CPEs, and the viruses causing the
CPEs are known as cytopathogenic viruses. The
characteristic CPEs include (1) change in cell
morphology, such
as rounding
of cells or
rounding and aggregation of cells, (2) syncytia
formation and (3) inclusion bodies formation.
Replication of virus in infected cells may
cause rounding, refractility, degeneration and
nuclear pyknosis. This may ﬁnally lead to com-
plete or partial cell lysis and vacuolation, as seen
in picornaviruses. Viruses, such as adenoviruses,
may cause rounding of cells and aggregate to
form grape-like clusters.
Viruses, such as paramyxovirus, varicella-
zoster, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes sim-
plex virus (HSV), cause syncytia formation,
containing several (up to 100) nuclei in infected
cells. These syncytia are multinucleated giant
cells formed by the fusion of virus-infected cells
with neighbouring or uninfected cells.
Inclusion bodies are intranuclear or cytoplas-
mic bodies produced by viruses in infected cells.
They are produced due to histological changes in
infected cells caused by viral components. These
are also produced as a result of virus-induced
changes in cell structures. These inclusion bodies
can be demonstrated on staining by light micros-
copy. These inclusion bodies may be acidophilic
or basophilic, small or large, round or irregular,
and single or multiple. These bodies may be
present either in the nucleus or cytoplasm, or
both. Many viruses produce different types of
inclusion bodies. For example, the rabies virus
produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies called
Negri bodies in the neural tissue of the brain.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) produces intranuclear
owl eye inclusion bodies (Fig. 50.2) in infected
cells or cell sediments excreted in the urine of the
patient infected with CMV. Human herpes
viruses produce Cowdry type A inclusion bodies.
Measles virus produces inclusion bodies that are
seen both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of
infected cells (Table 50.2).
Virus Isolation
Demonstration of virus in appropriate clinical
specimens by culture establishes the diagnosis
of viral diseases. Most viruses can be cultivated
in (1) laboratory animals, (2) embryonated eggs
or (3) tissue culture.
Laboratory Animals
The mouse is most frequently used to isolate
viruses
by
animal
inoculation.
In
addition,
rabbits, hamsters, newborn or suckling rodents
are also used. Experimental animals are rarely
used to cultivate viruses but play an essential

in
studying
the
pathogenesis
of
viral
infections and that of viral oncogenesis.

ﬂuorescent antibody (IFA) test, ELISA, RIA, latex agglutination test
(LAT) and Western blot
Intracerebral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or
intranasal routes are various routes of inoculation.
After inoculation, the animals are observed for
signs of disease or death. The infected animals
are then sacriﬁced, and infected tissues are exam-
ined for the presence of viruses by various tests
and inclusion bodies in infected tissues. Further-
more, infant (suckling) mice are used to isolate
the coxsackie virus and rabies virus.
Embryonated Eggs
Embryonated eggs were used initially for the
growth of viruses. Embryonated chick egg was
used ﬁrst to cultivate viruses by Goodpasture in
1931. The method further developed by Burnet
was used to cultivate viruses in different sites of
the embryonated egg. Usually, 8–11 day-old
chick eggs are used to culture viruses. The viruses
are isolated in different sites of the egg, such as
the yolk sac, amniotic cavity and allantoic
cavity and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
(Fig. 50.3).
Many of these viruses cause well-deﬁned and
characteristic foci, providing a method for identi-
ﬁcation, quantiﬁcation or assessing virus patho-
genicity. The embryonated egg is also used for
growing higher titre stocks of some viruses in
research laboratories and for vaccine production.
Yolk sac inoculation is used to cultivate Japa-
nese encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis and
West Nile virus. It is also used for the growth of
chlamydia and rickettsia. Inoculation in the
amniotic cavity is used mainly for primary isola-
tion of the inﬂuenza virus. Inoculation in the
allantoic cavity is used for serial passages and
for obtaining large quantities of viruses, such as
inﬂuenza virus, yellow fever (17D strain) and
rabies (Flury strain) viruses to prepare vaccines.
For the production of the rabies virus, duck eggs
were used due to their bigger size than that of
hen’s egg. This helped produce large quantities of
the rabies virus, which are used to prepare the
inactivated non-neural rabies vaccine.

produced

lesions known as pocks. Each infectious virus

particle produces one pock. The poxviruses,
such as variola or vaccinia, are identiﬁed by
demonstrating
typical
pocks
on
the
CAM
inoculated with the pox virus. Nowadays, in a
virology laboratory, chick embryo inoculation
has been replaced by cell cultures for routine
isolation of viruses.
Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
725
Tissue Culture
Tissue culture is most widely used in diagnostic
virology for the cultivation and assays of viruses.
Different types of tissue cultures are used to grow
viruses. Tissue culture can be of three different
types as follows:
Flurry Culture
This was used earlier to isolate some viruses,
which show an afﬁnity for certain tissue organs.
For example, coronavirus, a respiratory pathogen,
was isolated in the tracheal ring organ culture. In
this method, small bits of the organs are
maintained in vitro for days and weeks, preserv-
ing their original morphology and function. Now-
adays, organ culture is not used.
Explant Culture
In this method, components of minced tissue are
grown as explants embedded in plasma clots.
Earlier, adenoid tissue explant cultures were
used for the isolation of adenoviruses. This
method is now seldom used in virology.
Cell Culture
Cell culture is now routinely used for growing
viruses. In this method, tissues are dissociated
into component cells by treatment with proteo-
lytic enzymes (trypsin or collagenase) followed
by mechanical shaking. The cells are then
washed, counted and suspended in a growth
medium containing essential amino acids and
vitamins, salts, glucose and a buffering system.
This medium is supplemented by up to 5% of
foetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cell suspen-
sion is dispensed in glass or plastic bottles, tables
or Petri dishes. On incubation, the cells adhere to
the glass surfaces and divide to form a conﬂuent
monolayer sheet of cells covering the surface
within a week (Fig. 50.4). The cell culture may
be incubated either as a stationery culture or as a
roller drum culture. The latter is useful for the
growth of some fastidious viruses due to better
aeration by rolling the culture bottle in special
roller drums. The cell cultures are classiﬁed into
three different types based on their origin, chro-
mosomal characters and number of generations
for which they can be maintained as follows

Primary cell culture: This is a culture of
normal cells obtained freshly from the original
tissues that have been cultivated in vitro for the
ﬁrst time and that have not been subcultured.
These cell cultures can be established from
whole
animal
embryos
or
selected
tissues
from adults, newborns or embryos. These cells
have the normal diploid chromosomal number
and only limited growth (5–10 divisions) in
culture. They cannot be maintained in serial cul-
ture but can be subcultured to obtain a large
number of cells. Monkey kidney cell culture,
human
embryonic
kidney
cell
culture
and
chick embryo cell culture are the common
examples
of
primary
cell
culture.
Primary
monkey kidney cell cultures are highly useful
for the primary isolation of myxovirus, para-
myxovirus,
many
enteroviruses
and
some
adenoviruses.

Diploid cell strains: Diploid cell strains are
of a single cell type that retains their original
diploid chromosome number and karyotype.
However,
they
have
speciﬁc
characteristics
and compositions and are usually composed
of one basic cell type. They are usually ﬁbroblasts
and
can
be
cultured
for
a
maximum
of
50 serial passages before they undergo senes-
cence (die-off) or a signiﬁcant change in their
characteristics.
Diploid
cells
derived
from
human ﬁbroblasts are useful for isolating some
fastidious viruses. They are also used to produce
vaccines; for example, WI-38 human embryonic
lung stem cell is used to cultivate ﬁxed rabies
virus and human foetal diploid cells for isolation
of
adenovirus
picornaviruses,
HSV,
CMV
and VZV.
Continuous cell lines: Continuous or immor-
tal cell lines are cells of a single type derived
from cancerous tissue and capable of continuous
serial cultivation indeﬁnitely without senescing.
The cells are usually derived from diploid cell
lines or malignant tissues and have an altered
and
irregular
number
of
chromosomes.
Immortalisation may occur spontaneously or
induced by chemical mutagens, tumourigenic
viruses or oncogenes. Hep-2, HeLa and KB
derived from human carcinoma cervix, human
epithelioma of the larynx and human carcinoma
of the nasopharynx and other cell lines are
excellent for the recovery of a large number of
viruses. These cell lines have been used exten-
sively to grow a number of viruses. These cell
lines are usually stored at 70 C for use when
necessary or are maintained by serial subculture.
The type of cell line used for virus culture
depends on the sensitivity of the cells to a partic-
ular virus; for example, the Hep-2 cell line is
excellent for the recovery of respiratory syncytial
viruses, adenoviruses and HSV. Most viruses can
be isolated by using one of these cell lines.
Detection of Virus Growth in Cell Cultures
The following methods can detect the growth of
viruses in cell cultures.
Cytopathic Effect (CPE)
Many viruses can be detected and initially
identiﬁed
by
observing
the
morphological
changes in the cultured cells they replicate. The
CPE produced by different types of viruses is
characteristic and helps in the initial identiﬁcation
of virus isolates. Nuclear shrinking, vacuoles in
the cytoplasm, syncytia formation, rounding up
and detachment are the examples of alteration of
morphology of the cells. Most CPEs can be
demonstrated in an unﬁxed and unstained mono-
layer of cells under the low power of the micro-
scope. For example, adenoviruses produce large
granular changes resembling bunches of grapes,

SV-14
produces
well-deﬁned
cytoplasmic
vacuolation, measles virus produces syncytium
formation,
herpes
virus
produces
discrete
focal degeneration and enteroviruses cause crena-
tion of cells and degeneration of the entire cell
sheet.
Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
727
Haemadsorption
Haemadsorption is the process of adsorption of
erythrocytes to the surfaces of infected cells,
which serves as an indirect measurement of viral
protein synthesis. This property is used to detect
infection with non-cytocidal viruses and the early
stage of cytocidal viruses. Viruses, such as inﬂu-
enza virus, parainﬂuenza virus, mumps virus and
togavirus, when infecting cell lines, code for the
expression of red cell agglutinins, which are
expressed on the infected cell membrane during
infections. These haemagglutinins bind some
erythrocytes to the infected cell surface. Some-
times, viruses can be detected by agglutination of
erythrocytes in the culture medium.
Heterologous Interference
This property is used to detect viruses that do not
produce classic CPEs in the cell lines. In this
method, the growth of non-CPE-producing virus
in cell culture can be tested by a subsequent
challenge with a virus known to produce CPEs.
The growth of the ﬁrst virus will inhibit infection
by the cytopathic challenge virus by interference.
For example, the rubella virus usually does not
produce any CPE but prevents the replication of
picornaviruses, which is inoculated as a cyto-
pathic challenge virus.
Transformation
Oncogenic
viruses
associated
with
tumour
formation induce cell transformation and loss
of contact inhibition in the infected cell lines.
This leads to surface growth that appears in a
piled-up
fashion
producing
micro-tumours.
Examples of oncogenic viruses that produce
transformation in cell lines are herpes viruses,
adenoviruses, hepadnaviruses, papovavirus and
retroviruses.
Detection of Viral Antigen/ Virus in Cell
Lines
Light Microscopy
Viral antigens in infected cell cultures are
demonstrated by staining virus-infected cells of
tissue sections with speciﬁc viral antibodies con-
jugated with horseradish peroxidase. This is
followed by the addition of hydrogen peroxide
along with a benzidine derivative substance. A
red insoluble precipitate is deposited on the cell
line in a positive reaction, which is demonstrated
by
examination
under
an
ordinary
light
microscope.
Immunofluorescence
Direct
immunoﬂuorescence
using
speciﬁc
antibodies is frequently used to detect viral
antigens in inoculated cell lines to identify
viruses.
Electron Microscopy
EM can also demonstrate the viruses in infected
cell lines.
Viral Assays
The virus content of a specimen can be assessed
either by estimating the total virus particle count
or by the assay of infectivity of viruses.
Total Virus Particles Count
Electron microscopy and haemagglutination are
used to estimate total virus particles.
Electron microscopy (EM) is useful to count
virus particles directly in a negatively stained
viral suspension. In this method, the virus suspen-
sion is mixed with a known concentration of latex
particles and the number of virus particles in the
suspension is estimated by a ratio between the
virus and latex particles demonstrated by EM.
Quantitation of haemagglutinating viruses is
carried out by the determination of haemagglu-
tination titres. Although it is not a sensitive
method, it is used as a convenient method of

virus assay. For example, approximately 107
inﬂuenza virions are essential to produce micro-
scopic agglutination in cultured cells.
728

Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Diseases
Assay of Infectivity of Viruses
Quantitative and quantal assays are the two types
of essays that are carried out to determine the
assay of infectivity of viruses.
Quantitative Assay of Infectivity
A quantitative assay is used to estimate the pres-
ence of an actual number of viable infectious viral
particles in the inoculum. Two methods are avail-
able for the purpose, including plaque assay in
monolayer cell culture and pock assay on chick
embryo CAM.
1. Plaque assay: Dulbecco introduced it in 1952
as a modiﬁcation of bacteriophage plaque
assay. This is based on the principle that each
infectious viral particle gives rise to a localised
focus of infected cells that the naked eye can
visualise. Such foci are called plaques, and
each plaque indicates an infectious virus. The
test is performed by adding a viral inoculum to
a monolayer of culture cells in a bottle or Petri
dish. After some time, this allows the adsorp-
tion of viruses. The liquid medium is removed
and replaced with a solid agar gel to ensure
that the spread of progeny virus is conﬁned to
the immediate vicinity of infected cells.
2. Pock assay: Viruses that form pocks on CAM
can be assayed by counting the number of
pocks formed on the inoculated CAM. Each
pock on CAM arises from a single virus parti-
cle. This is known as pock assay. Vaccinia and
variola viruses can be assayed by pock assay.
Quantal Assays of Infectivity
Quantal assays of infectivity can be carried out to
quantitate a virus by quantitating the virus
particles in animals, embryonated eggs or tissue
culture. This assay method of infectivity only
indicates the presence or absence of infectious
viruses, but it does not indicate an actual number
of viruses. The endpoints used for infectivity
titrations are estimated by the (1) development
of CPE in cell cultures, (2) production of
haemagglutination in allantoic ﬂuid of embryo-
nated egg, or (3) death of experimentally infected
animals. The titre of the virus is usually expressed
as the ‘50% infectious dose (ID50)’ per mL, which
indicates the highest dilution of the inoculum that
initiates detectable symptoms, antibodies or other
responses in 50% of inoculated test animals, eggs
or cell cultures.
Detection of Viral Proteins and Other
Enzymes
During the replication of viruses in host cells,
viral proteins, antigens and other enzymes are
produced. These viral products and components
can be detected by many methods, including bio-
chemical, immunological and molecular methods
in clinical specimens.
Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA), direct immunoﬂuorescence assay and
radioimmunoassay
(RIA)
are
widely
used
methods. These methods are used for the detec-
tion and identiﬁcation of viruses and viral
antigens in clinical specimens, as well as in cell
cultures. These tests use speciﬁc monoclonal or
monospeciﬁc antibodies raised against speciﬁc
viral antigens.
Identifying and quantifying speciﬁc viruses
can also be carried out by detecting and assaying
characteristic viral enzymes. For example, detec-
tion of reverse transcriptase in serum or cell cul-
ture suggests the presence of a retrovirus.
Similarly, demonstration of haemagglutinins or
haemadsorption in the cell culture indicates the
presence of the inﬂuenza virus.
Detection of Viral Genome
The
unique
genomic
structure
and
genetic
sequences are the most important characteristics
of the type and family of viruses. Therefore,
molecular methods are increasingly used to diag-
nose viral diseases. The restriction endonuclease
fragment lengths from the genome of DNA
viruses, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2 or the electro-
phoretic
pattern
of
RNA
viruses,
such
as

inﬂuenza and reoviruses, is considered as genetic
ﬁngerprints for these viruses.
Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
729
The methods for detection of viral genome
include: (1) DNA probes, (2) dot blot or Southern
blot analysis, (3) Northern blot or RNA-DNA
probe hybridisation, (4) polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) and (5) reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT PCR).
DNA Probe
The DNA probes are highly sensitive and speciﬁc
tools used to detect viruses in clinical specimens,
even in the absence of replication of the virus. In
this method, two strands of the target DNA in
clinical specimens are ﬁrst separated and then
allowed to hybridise with a labelled single-
stranded
DNA
probe.
Enzyme-labelled
or
ﬂuorescent-labelled DNA probes with sequences
complementary to unique nucleic acid sequences
of a viral genome can be used for detecting a
virus.
The
hybridised
labelled
probe,
after
hybridisation, can be detected by enzymatic
or
ﬂuorescence
method
depending
on
the
label used.
The commercially available DNA probes are
available to detect CMV, papillomavirus and
Epstein–Barr virus in clinical specimens. In situ
hybridisation is also used to detect integrated or
non-integrated copies of viral genomes in ﬁxed
permeability
biopsy
specimens
in
persistent
infections or viral malignant conditions.
DNA probe is especially useful for (1) studying
the expression of speciﬁc viral genomes on the
different cell types; (2) detecting, in clinical
specimens, viral genomes that do not provide
any CPE or for which no serological test is avail-
able and (3) detecting slowly replicating or
non-productive viruses, such as human papillo-
mavirus or CMV.
Southern Blot Analysis
Southern blot analysis or dot blot is used to detect
viral genomes in clinical specimens. In this
method, the viral genome or restriction endonu-
clease cleavage fragments of the genome are blot-
ted onto nitrocellulose papers and then detected
on the paper by their hybridisation to DNA
probes.
Northern Blot Analysis
Northern blot analysis or RNA: DNA probe
hybridisation is a method also followed to detect
viral genomes. In this method, electrophoretically
separated viral RNA is transformed onto a nitro-
cellulose paper and then detected by their
hybridisation to DNA probes.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
It is a DNA ampliﬁcation system that allows a
millionfold ampliﬁcation of a target sequence of
nucleic acids, at least 100,000-folds in a few
hours. This method is useful for diagnosing viral
infections caused by HIV-1, HIV-2, CMV,
human papilloma virus, HSV, hepatitis B, C and
D viruses, morbillivirus, echovirus, rhinovirus,
measles virus, rotavirus, etc. The PCR is useful
speciﬁcally for the detection of latent and
integrated sequences of viruses, such as retrovi-
rus, herpes virus, papilloma viruses and other
viruses and viruses present in low concentration
in clinical specimens.
Viral Serology
Viral serology is based on detecting speciﬁc viral
antibodies in the serum of the infected human
host. Many serological tests are used to demon-
strate speciﬁc viral antibodies in patients’ sera.
These
include
haemagglutination
inhibition
(HI) test, neutralisation test (NT), Western blot,
ELISA, indirect ﬂuorescent antibody (IFA) test,
RIA and latex agglutination test (LAT).
The detection of virus-speciﬁc immunoglobu-
lin (IgM) antibody in serum indicates a recent
primary infection. This is because IgM antibodies
appear in the serum during the ﬁrst 2 or 3 weeks
of primary infection. A fourfold increase in the
antibody titre between the serum collected during
the acute and convalescent phase, 2–3 weeks after
the acute phase, suggests seroconversion. An
anamnestic
or
secondary
antibody
response
occurs during reinfection or recurrence of viral
infection later in life. The serum antibody titre
usually remains high in individuals who suffer a
frequent disease recurrence, such as the herpes
virus.

730
50
Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Diseases
Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Test
The test is used to detect viruses that agglutinate
red blood cells of chickens, guinea pigs, humans
or other mammals. Antibodies in serum prevent
viruses from binding and agglutinating the new
blood cells. The HI test is used for the diagnosis
of infections caused by orthomyxoviruses.
Neutralisation Test (NT)
The test is based on the inhibition of infection by
the antibody and that of CPEs of the viruses in
tissue culture cells. The neutralisation antibody
response is usually virus and strain-speciﬁc. The
highest dilution of serum preventing infectivity is
50% of the virus. The serum mixture tested is
considered the titre of the test.
Western Blot
It is most commonly used to conﬁrm infection
caused by HIV, initially diagnosed by ELISA.
ELISA is most commonly used for screening
blood samples for hepatitis B and C viruses, Den-
gue and HIV. IFA, RIA and LAT are also used to
diagnose many common viral infections.
Viral serology has many uses. It is used (1) to
identify the virus and its strain or serotype, (2) to
determine whether the viral infection is acute or
chronic, or primary infection or reinfection,
(3) for diagnosis of viral infections that cause
diseases of long duration and (4) or diagnosis of
infections caused by viruses that are difﬁcult to
culture.
The limitations of serological tests in viral
diseases are the following:
1. The presence of antiviral antibody in serum
only indicates infection but cannot determine
whether it is recent or old. Demonstration of
IgM antibodies or demonstration of a fourfold
increase in the antibody titre between acute
and convalescent sera indicates only recent
infection.
2. The
serological
tests
may
be
associated
with false-positive or false-negative reactions.
The serological cross-reaction may occur
between different viruses, leading to false-
positive reactions. The formation of immune
complexes in serum may give rise to false-
negative reactions observed in viral infection
caused by the hepatitis B virus.
Molecular Diagnosis
The increase of instances of emerging and
re-emerging viruses and their deleterious effects
on human health, including the potential for out-
break and pandemic, has necessitated an early
warning system for rapid and highly speciﬁc
detection of the viruses. As such, a greater need
has been felt to develop novel, powerful diagnos-
tic assays where molecular tools have found per-
fect application. The advantages of molecular
tools compared to traditional systems are rapid
and accurate detection, higher sensitivity, speci-
ﬁcity to differentiate closely related species,
detection of very low concentration of samples
(suitable for early warning), quantitative and
qualitative detection, etc. In contrast, the current
disadvantages that are mostly procedural include
the requirement of highly trained staff, higher
processing cost, the requirement of sophisticated
laboratories, the absence of a uniform globally
acceptable protocol and reagents for many patho-
genic viruses.
The breakthrough in molecular diagnosis was
initially achieved using conventional gel-based
PCR that qualitatively detects the speciﬁc viral
genes by using designed primers and visualisation
of ampliﬁcation in an agarose gel. However, the
process was complex and time-consuming. It was
later replaced with other types of PCR, including
real-time PCR, nested PCR, multiplex PCR,
hybridisation and in situ PCR. Most of these
such
techniques
could
quantitatively
detect
viruses, even more than once, in a single reaction
and without the need for gel-based visualisation.
Even today, real-time PCR is considered the gold
standard for virus detection in a quantitative
approach. Several commercial kits targeting dif-
ferent viruses have been developed to eliminate
the process complexities and make way for the
technology to be applied widely in clinical
laboratories.

Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis
731
However, one of the major complexities
of these processes was the requirement of
trained staff, equipped laboratories and the
inability to process many samples at a time.
Scientiﬁc
advancements
in
the
recent
time
have introduced PCR robotics, portable PCR
machines,
ampliﬁcation
strategies
without
thermocycling,
etc.
These
have
effectively
facilitated bench to ﬁeld transition of molecular
diagnostics and have opened the avenue for these
tools for wider use.
In addition to the DNA-based molecular detec-
tion
methods,
antibody-detecting
molecular
methods are also under development and ﬁnding
ways to reach clinical laboratories. Some of such
new tools include improved ELISA systems, PCR
for protein detection (DNA tags, proximity liga-
tion), pen-side tests (e.g. dip-stick assays).

Bacteriophages
51
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.
They are obligate intracellular parasites that mul-
tiply inside bacteria by using some or all of the
host biosynthesis machinery. They are also called
phages.
These
extrachromosomal
genetic
elements usually survive outside a host cell due
to the presence of a nucleic acid genome
surrounded by a protein coat. Phages occur
widely in nature in close association with bacteria
and are distributed widely in the soil, faeces and
other substances in the environment. They are
associated with the transmission of genetic mate-
rial from one bacterium to another. Twort ﬁrst
described the activities of bacteriophage in
1915, who described it as an infectious agent
that distorted the appearance of the colonies of
staphylococci. Subsequently, d’Herelle in 1979
demonstrated the lytic activities of the culture
ﬁltrate on bacterial colonies. He suggested that
the lytic agent was a virus and gave it the name
bacteriophage (phage meaning to ‘eat’).
Morphology
Most phages consist of single, linear and double-
stranded DNA genomes (Fig. 51.1). This genome
is surrounded by a protein coat known as phage
capsid. Large phages usually consist of a head
and a tail. The head encloses the genome, and the
tail is used as an organ of attachment and the
conduit through which phage DNA passes into
the host cell. The best-studied phages are the
T-even phages (T2, T4, T6, etc.) that infect the
bacteria Escherichia coli.

733
Phages are tadpole-shaped with a hexagonal
head and a cylindrical tail.
The hexagonal head of all phages varies in
size and shape. It is icosahedral (20 sides) or
ﬁlamentous in shape. The size of the head
measures between 28 and 100 nm in length. The
capsid of the bacteriophage head encloses a com-
partment that contains the nucleic acid, which in
most of the phages is a double-stranded DNA
molecule. This DNA is protected against degra-
dation by environmental nucleases by virtue of its
location inside the bacteriophage head. However,
a group of phages that speciﬁcally infect male
strains of E. coli contains only RNA. The capsid
or protein coat of a virus is composed of individ-
ual proteins known as capsomeres.
Many but not all phages have tails attached to
the phage head. The tail consists of a hollow tube
through which the nucleic acid passes during
infection. The tail of a complex phage like T4 is
surrounded
by
a
contractile
sheath,
which
contracts during infection of the bacterium and a
terminal tail plate. The spikes and tail ﬁbres both
originate from the tail plate and speciﬁcally bind
to receptors on the outer membrane of the bacte-
rial cell wall.
Phages vary considerably in their morphology.
Phages that are spherical or ﬁlamentous and pos-
sess single-stranded DNA or RNA have also been
described. Phages show high host speciﬁcity.
They usually inhabit the intestinal microbial

Adsorption is a speciﬁc biochemical reaction;
hence bacteriophages can infect only certain
host bacterial cells. Infection usually does not
occur in the absence of adsorption. However,
infection of the bacterium directly by naked
ﬂora of humans and animals. They pass through
ﬁlters, which hold back the bacteria. These are
inactivated by boiling.

Life Cycle
Phages exhibit two different types of life cycles:
The lytic cycle, also known as a virulent cycle,
and the lysogenic cycle, also known as the tem-
perate cycle.
Lytic Cycle (Virulent Cycle)
In this cycle, intracellular multiplication of the
phage results in the lysis of host bacteria,
resulting in the release of progeny virions. The
lytic cycle of a virulent bacteriophage shows the
stages of adsorption, penetration, synthesis of the
phage components, maturation and release of
progeny phages.
1. Adsorption is the ﬁrst stage and is a speciﬁc
process. It is a very rapid process and, under
optimal
conditions,
is
completed
within
minutes. The speciﬁcity of the phage is deter-
mined by the presence of chemical receptors
on the surface of the bacteria. The sites of the
receptors for bacteriophage in bacteria are dif-
ferent and may be situated in different cell wall
layers or on the surface structure. For example,
bacteriophage receptors are found on the outer
membrane of the cell wall of E. coli, in the Vi
antigen of Salmonella, in glycosylated teichoic
acid of Bacillus subtilis, and portions of the
outer membrane of the cell wall of Gram-
negative bacteria.

phage nucleic acid can occur, and this process
is known as transfection.
Morphology
735
2. Adsorption is followed by penetration of
phage nucleic acid into the bacterial cell.
Phages with contractile tails behave as hypo-
dermic syringes, injecting the phage DNA into
the bacterial body through the hollow core
(Fig. 51.2). The phage DNA passes through
the central tail core into the host cytoplasm,
while
the
empty
protein
capsid
remains
attached to the cell surface. More than one
phage can adsorb to a host cell and inject its
DNA. If more bacteriophages are adsorbed,
they make so many holes in the cell wall that
it causes lysis of the cell, a phenomenon called
lysis from without.
The empty head and tail of the phage, after
penetration, remain outside the cell surface as
the empty shell or ghost. After entry, the phage
DNA is re-arranged to a circular form, and this
process is known as the circulation of phage
DNA.
3. Synthesis
of
phage
components
begins
immediately after the phage nucleic acid pen-
etration. Early proteins are the ﬁrst products
to be synthesised. These early proteins include
Injection of 
phage DNA
Host cell
Fig. 51.2 Process of injection of phage DNA into the
host cell
the enzymes, such as nucleases, synthetic
enzymes and RNA polymerase. These early
proteins are essential for building complex
molecules peculiar to the phage. Subsequently,
late proteins are synthesised, which include
(1) protein subunits of phage, (2) structural
proteins
necessary
for
the
virion
self-
assembly, (3) enzymes involved in maturation
and (4) proteins used in the release of
bacteriophages from the cell. During this
period, the synthesis of bacterial proteins,
DNA and RNA stop. It is noteworthy that
phage DNA, head proteins and tail proteins
are synthesised separately in the bacterial cell.
4. Maturation begins with the protein subunits
of the phage head and tail aggregating sponta-
neously to form the compact capsid. The DNA
is condensed into a compact polyhedral shape
and packaged into the head. The assembly of
the phage component into the mature infective
phage particles is known as maturation.
5. Release of progeny phages is a process in
which
new
mature
progeny
phages
are
released by lysis of the bacterial cells. During
the replication of phages, the bacterial cell wall
is weakened by lysozyme. Finally, the cell
wall bursts as a result of osmotic pressure.
This is known as lysis from within.
The interval between the infection of a
bacterial cell and the ﬁrst release of mature
daughter phages is known as the latent period.
The interval between the entry of phage nucleic
acid into the bacterial cell and the appearance of
the ﬁrst infectious intracellular phage particle is
known as the eclipse phase. The average yield
of daughter phages from the infected bacterial
cell is known as the burst size. The period
during which the number of infectious phages
released rises is known as the rise period. A
one-step growth curve is obtained when the bac-
teriophage growth titre is plotted against time. A
plaque assay enumerates the lytic cycle. A plaque
is a clear area that results from the lysis of bacte-
ria. Each plaque arises from a single infectious
phage.

736
51
Bacteriophages
Lysogenic Cycle (Temperate Cycle)
In this cycle, phage DNA becomes integrated
with the bacterial genome and replicates with
the bacteria synchronously without causing any
harm to the host cell.
Infection with every phage does not result in
the lysis of the host cells. Unlike virulent phages,
which cause lysis of the host cell, some phages
(such as temperate phages) integrate into the
genome of the bacterial chromosome without
causing any lysis of the bacteria. The integrated
phage nucleic acid is known as the prophage. The
prophage behaves like a segment of the host chro-
mosome
and
multiplies
synchronously
with
it. This phenomenon is known as lysogeny. The
bacterium that carries a prophage within its
genome is called lysogenic bacterium, and such
phages are called lysogenic or temperate phages.
Lysogeny: After infection by a temperate
phage, the DNA from the temperate phage enters
the host cell. This phage inside the cell forms a
circle and, by a single recombinant event, becomes
integrated into the DNA of the bacterium. The host
bacterial cell, now called the lysogenic cell,
replicates the phage DNA or prophage every
time it divides. Sometimes, the phage may become
excised from the bacterial chromosome during the
multiplication of lysogenic bacteria. The excised
prophage can initiate a new lytic cycle resulting in
the release of daughter phage particles. These
daughter phage particles also infect other bacterial
cells and make them lysogenic. This is known as
spontaneous induction of prophage.
All lysogenic bacteria on exposure to ultravio-
let rays, hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen mustard
can also be induced to shift to the lytic cycle. A
lysogenic bacterium is resistant to re-infection by
the same or related phages. This is called superin-
fection immunity. During lysogeny, the prophage
confers certain new properties on the lysogenic
bacteria. This is known as lysogenic or phage
conversion. The examples of phage conversions
are as follows:
1. Phage-mediated
conversion
of
somatic
antigens of Salmonella: This occurs when a
large number of temperate phages of Salmo-
nella modify antigenic properties of somatic
O antigen. For example, Salmonella anatum
(antigenic formula: 3,10: e, h:1,6), when
lysogenised by a temperate phage, shows a
new antigenic formula (3,15: e, h:1,6), which
is
an
antigenic
formula
of
Salmonella
newington.
2. Toxigenicity
of
Corynebacterium
diphtheriae: The presence of prophage beta
(β) is responsible for the production of toxins
in C. diphtheriae. Removal of the prophage
beta
makes
the
bacteria
non-toxigenic.
Similarly, non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae can
be made toxigenic by lysogenisation with (β)
phage.
3. Toxicity of Clostridium botulinum: Toxin
production in C. botulinum types C and D
is determined by the presence of phages
CE(β) and DE(β), respectively. Elimination
of the phages abolishes the toxigenicity of
the bacillus.
4. Transduction: Bacteriophages may act as
carriers of genes from one bacterium to
another. This is known as transduction. This
phenomenon has been described in many bac-
teria and is recognised as one of the main
mechanisms of transferring genetic material
among bacteria in nature. This has been
discussed in detail in Chap. 7. Table 51.1
summarises the comparison of multiplication
of bacteriophages and viruses.
Uses of Bacteriophages
Bacteriophages have many uses. They are a
convenient model for the study of virus–host
interaction. They play an important role in the
transmission of genetic information by transduc-
tion, and they are used as cloning vectors for
genetic manipulations. They also are used for
phage typing.

Bacteriophage Typing
Different strains of a serologically or otherwise
identical species of bacteria are susceptible to
one or more different bacteriophages. When a
suspension of phages is deposited on the lawn
culture of a susceptible bacterium, an area of
clearing occurs after incubation due to the
lysis of the susceptible bacteria by the phages.
These zones of lysis are called plaques. The
shape, size and nature of plaques are characteris-
tic of different phages. Since a single phage
particle can produce one plaque, a plaque assay
can be used for titrating the number of viable
phages in preparation. Many bacterial species
can be divided into various phage types based
on this phenomenon. Phage typing has been
used in the epidemiological study of infections
or outbreaks caused by Staphylococcus aureus,
Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae and many other
bacteria.
Different phages are available, which show
differences in their speciﬁcity for genus, species
or
strains.
Examples
are
(1)
genus-speciﬁc
bacteriophages
for
Salmonella,
(2)
speciﬁc
bacteriophages for all members or strains of
Bacillus anthracis and (3) for all members of
V. cholerae biotype Classical (e.g. Mukherjee
phage IV). Mukherjee phage IV lyses all strains
of
V.
cholerae
biotype
Classical,
but
not
V. cholerae biotype Eltor.
Phage typing of S. aureus is a pattern method
in which a set of standard phages is employed for
intraspecies typing of staphylococci. Several
phages may lyse a strain of Staphylococcus.
Hence, the phage type of a strain is designated
by the number of the different phages that lyse
it. Phage typing of Salmonella typhi is carried out
by using prophage, which is active against only
fresh isolates of S. typhi possessing the Vi
antigen.
Phage Therapy
Phage therapy or the practice of using bacteria-
speciﬁc viruses to treat bacterial infections has
been in vogue for many years. With the emerging
burden of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and
lack of therapeutic options, phage therapy has
recently gained importance as an alternative treat-
ment option. These bacteria eating viruses are
quite speciﬁc for the species and strain of the
bacteria. The phages are dependent on the host
bacteria for nutrition and survival and, in the
process, often cause the death of the host cell.
The phage lysins can destroy bacterial cells.
Depending on their development cycles, phages
are either virulent (lytic life cycle) or temperate
(lysogenic life cycle). In therapeutic use, virulent
phages are more promising agents.
Therapeutic uses of phages have diverse
differences. While few European countries have
continuously used them to treat infections in
humans with multidrug-resistant bacteria and
with
reports
of
therapeutic
failures
with
antibiotics, other countries among the developed
regions have limited the therapeutic use to the
veterinary and agriculture sectors. Due to the
lack of robust data on several issues like

safety, speciﬁcity, bioﬁlm penetration ability,
antibacterial spectrum etc., phage therapy has
been limited to certain centres around the globe
with
focal
reports
of
their
effectiveness.
Nevertheless, with increased use of this mode of
therapy and better-bioengineered phage products,
it might be possible to use phage therapy on a
large scale in the near future.

Poxviruses

Poxviruses
are
the
largest
and
most
complex
viruses
that
occur
in
humans,
birds, animals and insects. These viruses, which
belong to the family Poxviridae, include a
large group of DNA viruses that are morphologi-
cally similar and share a common nucleocapsid
protein.
Poxviruses
Poxviruses (family Poxviridae) are a group of
morphologically complex, ovoid or brick-shaped
viruses containing a large (130–260 kb) linear
double-stranded DNA genome. The genomic
constituency places this family in Group I of
Baltimore Classiﬁcations of Viruses. To date,
this family is represented by 83 species that
have global footprints and can infect a wide
range of hosts, including humans, animals,
birds, reptiles and insects.
This group is best known for the variola virus
that caused smallpox, one of the deadliest
diseases of human history. However, it was
completely eradicated in 1980, marking landmark
success in international public health. Another
member of this family, the Vaccinia virus, is the
source of the smallpox vaccine and is widely used
as a DNA vector in genetic engineering research
and development.

Classification and Host Range
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV), authorised for virus taxonomic classiﬁ-
cation and nomenclature, has placed the viruses
in 22 genera distributed into two subfamilies.
The family Poxviridae, based on whether they
infect insect or vertebrate hosts, has been classi-
ﬁed into two subfamilies: Chordopoxvirinae
and
Entomopoxvirinae.
The
subfamily
Chordopoxvirinae contains viruses that infect
vertebrate
hosts
and
include
eight
genera.
Of these, at least four genera cause diseases
in humans resulting in the development of
characteristics
lesions,
skin
nodules
or
disseminated rash.
The
genus
Orthopoxvirus
includes
the
poxviruses of mammals, such as smallpox (vari-
ola), vaccinia, monkeypox, cowpox, buffalopox,
rabbitpox, mousepox and Camelpox viruses.
Parapoxviruses include viruses of ungulates that
may cause occasional infections in humans.
These viruses are Orf viruses, pseudocowpox
virus, deerpox viruses and bovine papular stoma-
titis
virus.
Yatapoxviruses
include
tanapox
viruses and yabapox viruses that are found mainly
in
Africa.
Molluscipoxviruses
include
the
Molluscum contagiosum virus. The poxviruses
causing infections in humans are listed in
Table 52.1.

Except
for
smallpox
and
Molluscum
contagiosum viruses that have a human reservoir,
animals are the natural reservoir for other
poxviruses.
As
such,
poxvirus
infection
in
humans is mostly zoonotic due to the transmis-
sion of the virus from animals to humans.
Animal-to-human transmission occurs through
bite or scratch, direct contact with body ﬂuids or
lesion material, or indirect contact with lesion
material. However, persons acquiring one zoo-
notic poxvirus may not transmit to others. For
example, person-to-person transmission of cow-
pox
has
not
been
observed,
whereas
the
monkeypox virus can transmit across humans.
Smallpox (Variola) Virus
Smallpox caused by the variola virus was
eradicated from the world in 1980 following an
intensive worldwide campaign by the World
Health Organisation (WHO). However, the pos-
sible use of the smallpox virus as an agent of
bioterrorism is the main concern now.
Morphology
The variola virus is large and brick-shaped. It
measures 300  200  200 nm, hence is visible
by light microscopy. The virus is enveloped. The
extracellular virion possesses two envelopes. The
outer envelope encloses the extracellular virion
consisting of host cell lipids and several virus-
speciﬁc proteins, including haemagglutinins. The
intracellular virion has only one envelope. The
viral genome consists of a large, double-stranded
DNA that measures 130–375 kbp in size.
Physical and Chemical Properties
Variola virus is most stable at low temperatures
and low humidity. It remains viable for months at
room temperature if protected from sunlight. It is
also stable in the cold or when freeze-dried for
years. It is resistant to the action of 50% glycerol
and 1% phenol. Even though enveloped, the virus
is not susceptible to ether; hence it is not
inactivated by ether.
The virus could be inactivated by moist
heating at 60 C for 10 min; however, the viral
antigenic proteins can withstand 100 C. It is
susceptible
to
ultraviolet
light
and
other
irradiations and readily inactivated by formalin
and oxidising disinfectants.
Antigenic Properties
Smallpox virus has a single serotype responsible
for successful vaccination against the disease.

All
poxviruses,
including
vaccinia
viruses,
have a common nuclear protein antigen (NP).
These poxviruses contain at least 20 different
antigens, such as LS antigen, agglutinogen and
haemagglutinin.
Smallpox (Variola) Virus

Laboratory Isolation
The ‘Regulations and Guidelines for Recombi-
nant DNA Research and Biocontainment’ issued
by the Department of Biotechnology in 2018 that
mandates research and handling of infectious
microorganisms in India have classiﬁed the Pox-
virus under Risk Group 2. As such, isolation and
handling of the viruses for research and clinical
purposes requires Biosafety Level 2 laboratory
facility and related practices to protect workers
and the environment.
Chick Embryo
Inoculating vesicular ﬂuid into the chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo is reliable.
Both variola and vaccinia viruses grow in the
chick embryos. They produce pocks on CAM of
11- to 13-day-old chick embryos within 48–72 h.
Variola virus produces small, shiny, white, con-
vex, non-necrotic and non-haemorrhagic pocks.
Vaccinia
viruses
produce
larger,
irregular,
greyish, necrotic, pock lesions, some of which
may be haemorrhagic. The monkeypox and cow-
pox produce well-marked haemorrhagic lesions,
whereas Tanapoxvirus, Molluscum contagiosum,
and the parapoxvirus do not show any growth on
the CAM.
Tissue Culture
Human and non-human primate cells, such as
monkey kidneys and HeLa cells, are used to iso-
late viruses from clinical specimens. Variola virus
can be grown in chick embryo cells, monkey
kidneys and HeLa cells. Unlike the vaccinia
virus, which rapidly produces cytopathic effects
(CPEs) within 24–48 h, the variola virus produces
CPEs very slowly. The CPEs consist of Guarnieri
bodies, which are eosinophilic inclusion bodies
that consist of an aggregation of virus particles in
a matrix. These can be demonstrated in stained
preparations.
Tanapoxvirus
and
parapoxviruses
grow
poorly, whereas Molluscum contagiosum does
not grow in cell cultures.
Laboratory Animals
Variola virus causes experimental infection only
in monkeys. Intranasal infection of monkeys by
variola virus causes smallpox in monkeys with
generalised skin lesions. Scariﬁcation of the cor-
nea of rabbits with variola virus causes keratitis
with the demonstration of characteristic Guarnieri
bodies in the stained smears of the cornea.
Pathogenesis of Smallpox
Transmission
Smallpox was a highly infectious disease. Respi-
ratory secretions and exudates of the skin lesions
were the most common sources of infections. The
disease was most commonly transmitted by inhal-
ing respiratory droplets from smallpox patients.
Compared to smallpox that has spread through
principally respiratory routes, whereas vaccinia,
monkeypox can also be transmitted through
contacts, i.e. direct physical contact with infec-
tious skin lesions, ﬂuids and indirect contact with
lesion material, such as contaminated clothing or
linens.
Virus Replication
Poxvirus replication is complex. The virus repli-
cation starts within 2 h after transmitting and
entering the host through the respiratory route.
Among the DNA viruses, they are unique in that
the complete replication cycle of the virus occurs
in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell. The
virus encodes the enzymes required for mRNA
and DNA synthesis essential for genetic replica-
tion. The virus also encodes proteins for other
functions, such as DNA synthesis and immune
escape mechanisms. Finally, the virions are
assembled and acquire their envelopes by bud-
ding from the cell membrane as they are released
from the cell.

742
52
Poxviruses
The virus replicates at the inoculation site and
spreads to lymph nodes draining the mucosal
entry site. The virus replicates in the lymphoid
tissues causes transient viremia and infection of
the reticuloendothelial cells. This is followed by a
secondary phase of multiplication in these cells,
leading to a secondary viremia. This results in
clinical manifestations of the disease, which man-
ifest as fever and other toxic manifestations. The
viruses then enter the skin, localise in the skin’s
blood vessels, and produce the characteristic rash
(pocks) of smallpox. The pocks are due to the
replication of the virus in the skin followed by
the damage caused by cytotoxic T cells, damag-
ing the virus-infected cells.
Clinical Syndromes
Variola virus causes smallpox, a disease that is
now extinct.
Smallpox
The incubation period varied from 10 to 14 days.
The prodromal phase, which correlated with the
viremia phase, was the ﬁrst to appear. The onset
of
the
disease
was
sudden.
The
condition
manifested as sudden onset of fever, severe head-
ache, nausea, pharyngitis, body malaise and back-
ache. An exanthematous rash would appear on
the palate, tongue and pharynx during the latter
part of the prodromal stage.
The smallpox rash was characterised by skin
lesions that are in the same stage of evolution,
unlike those lesions seen in chickenpox. The
lesions in chickenpox appear in successive
waves and various stages, such as vesicles,
pustules and scabs. The skin lesions ﬁrst appear
on the face and extremities and then spread cen-
trifugally to the trunk. These lesions begin as
macules and then develop into papules, vesicles,
pustules and ﬁnally crusts during a period of
approximately 17 days. The lesions heal with
the formation of characteristic scarring.
Overwhelming toxaemia was the usual cause
of death in patients with smallpox. There were
two variants of smallpox: variola major and vari-
ola minor. The variola major was associated with
a 25–30% fatality rate, whereas the variola minor
was associated with a low fatality rate of less than
1%. In addition, ﬂat smallpox and haemorrhagic
variola were the unusual manifestations of small-
pox in some patients and were usually fatal.
Humoral antibodies are not protective. Cell-
mediated immunity plays an important role in
controlling and resolving the disease. Virus-
speciﬁc T cells control the spread of viruses by
causing lysis of infected cells in the reticuloendo-
thelial cells in the skin. An attack of smallpox
gives complete protection against re-infection.
Vaccination confers immunity, which lasts about
10 years.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Suspected
cases
of
smallpox
were
usually
diagnosed clinically. The main criteria for clinical
diagnosis of smallpox included (1) febrile prodro-
mal phase occurring 1–4 days before the onset of
rashes; (2) characteristic smallpox lesions of the
skin (deep, ﬁrm, round), which could be umbili-
cated or conﬂuent and (3) skin lesions in some
stage of development on any part of the body.
Specimens
Skin lesions, such as vesicular ﬂuid, were the
specimens of choice.
Microscopy
The Guarnieri bodies, the characteristic eosino-
philic inclusion bodies, can be demonstrated in
the stained preparation of the clinical specimens
by light microscopy. The electron microscope, if
available, was used for direct demonstration of
typical virus particles in clinical specimens. It was
useful to differentiate a smallpox virus from that
of
chickenpox.
Negative-contrast
electron
microscopy result of the virus shows a surface
membrane that encloses a biconcave or cylindri-
cal core. One or two lateral bodies appear to be
present between the core wall and a membrane.
Virus Isolation
Isolation of the virus either in CAM of embryo-
nated egg, or tissue culture, as described earlier, is

necessary for research, and rapid and accurate
identiﬁcation of poxvirus infections.
Smallpox (Variola) Virus
743
Serology
Serological tests were used to conﬁrm the diag-
nosis of poxvirus infection. Indirect immunoﬂuo-
rescent antibody tests and HI, CF and NT tests are
available to demonstrate serum antibodies that
appear after the ﬁrst week of infection.
Molecular Detection
PCR-based detection of the poxvirus is the con-
ﬁrmatory way to understand the species involved
in infection. A PCR test can identify the infection
among a range of suspected lesions and even
before the onset of symptoms. Primers targeting
poxvirus housekeeping genes like 18S rRNA,
globin and DNA polymerase have been widely
used. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
is more sensitive and can detect <10 genome
equivalents per PCR.
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral agents are available against
the variola virus. Methisazone is of some value
against some poxviruses. It is recommended
only for chemoprophylaxis but not for treatment.
Vaccinia immune globulin is recommended to
treat all complications except post-vaccinated
encephalitis.
Although
smallpox
has
been
eradicated worldwide, concern still exists about
the possible occurrence of smallpox through
bioterrorism.
Epidemiology
Smallpox was a highly infectious disease caused
by the variola virus. It was one of the deadliest
diseases that claimed more than 300 million lives
before it was completely eradicated. The disease
had about a 30% mortality rate. India, which
accounted for 60% of global smallpox infection,
witnessed a viral epidemic in 1974. For survivors,
permanent skin scarring was common. Other
deformities like loss of lip, nose and ear tissue
and corneal scarring leading to blindness were
also reported. Currently, the world is free of
smallpox.
Geographical Distribution
In the 1960s, the WHO formulated a concept
programme for the global eradication of small-
pox. The disease was then present in 44 countries
with a global incidence of around 10 million cases
annually. Using a highly potent and stable vac-
cine, rapid identiﬁcation of outbreaks and carry-
ing out ring vaccination in all contacts of an
infected person, the disease was ﬁnally eradicated
in 1977 when the last case of endemic smallpox
was detected in Somalia.
The last case of naturally occurring smallpox
was detected in Somalia in 1977. The last
recorded case in humans, which was due to an
accidental laboratory infection, was reported in
England in 1978. The WHO in 1980 declared
that smallpox was eradicated from the world.
The only remaining known virus isolates are
stocked in the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) laboratories in the United
States and the Vector Institute in Russia.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Smallpox was a highly infectious disease. Respi-
ratory secretions and exudates of the skin lesions
were the most common sources of infection. The
disease was most commonly transmitted by inhal-
ing respiratory droplets from smallpox patients.
The patients were highly infectious during the
ﬁrst week of rash, once fever had started.
The features of smallpox that contributed to its
total eradication include the followings:
1. Smallpox was the ﬁrst disease to be eradicated
by a vaccination programme due to the avail-
ability of an effective vaccine.
2. A safe, stable, economical and easy to admin-
ister smallpox vaccine was available.
3. Presence of a scar indicated the successful
vaccination against smallpox.
4. There was only a single serotype of the variola
virus;
hence
immunisation
by
vaccines
protected against all cases of smallpox.

744
52
Poxviruses
5. Human
and
other
animal
pox
viruses
share common antigenic determinants. Safe
vaccines prepared from animal poxviruses
could also be used for vaccination against
humans.
Prevention and Control
Almost after two centuries of Jenner’s discovery
of vaccination, the 33rd World Health Assembly
declared complete eradication of smallpox on
eighth May 1980. In international public health,
it is considered one of the biggest achievements
of human history. However, its origin is still
unknown. The ﬁrst documented evidence dates
back to the fourth and seventh centuries in
China and India, respectively. The last case of
naturally occurring smallpox was detected in
Somalia in 1977. The last recorded case in
humans, which was due to an accidental labora-
tory infection, was reported in England in 1978.
Vaccines
Immunisation against the poxvirus is the only
way to protect individuals from getting poxvirus
infection. Vaccination confers immunity, which
lasts about 10 years. However, before the vacci-
nation
was
introduced,
empirical
preventive
measures against smallpox through variolation
had been used in India and China in the ﬁfteenth
century and later became very popular in Europe
and UK. In variolation, healthy individuals were
deliberately exposed to material from smallpox
sores (pustules) by scratching the material into
their arm or inhaling it through the nose. Com-
pared to naturally getting the virus, the violation
process resulted in fewer deaths and the same
symptoms. The discovery of vaccines started
from the pioneering work of Edward Jenner on
the control of smallpox infections by the use of
the cowpox virus as the vaccine. Later in the
1800s, the virus used to make the smallpox vac-
cine changed from cowpox to vaccinia virus.
The smallpox vaccine is a live preparation of
the vaccinia virus propagated on the skin of cows.
The vaccine is applied by scariﬁcation, which
causes a local pustule that subsequently heals
with the formation of scabs. Subsequently, the
virus is grown on the skin of calves to reduce
the risk of transmitting syphilis and other diseases
during vaccination. Vaccinia virus used as a vac-
cine replicating at the inoculation site produces
local erythematous maculopapular. These lesions
subsequently vesiculate and ﬁnally heal by pro-
ducing a scab over 10–14 days. Finally, resolu-
tion of the lesions occurs by the formation of
pustules followed by scaling and healing. The
resolution of the disease is associated with the
development of immunity to variola infection
that persists for up to 10 years.
Even after smallpox has been completely
eradicated, the vaccinia vaccine still ﬁnds its
use. The vaccine used during the smallpox eradi-
cation program also offers protection against
monkeypox. A new third-generation vaccinia
vaccine is now available to prevent smallpox
and monkeypox.
Future Risks
Even though the world is now free from the
smallpox virus, it is considered a serious threat
to biological terrorism and so is designated as a
Category A agent by the Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA. In the
past, during the eighteenth century, the virus was
used as a tool of bioterrorism in a few instances.
Recent research suggests that recreating the
smallpox virus from its genomic information
available in the database enhances risks for
bioterrorism.
Other Poxviruses
Vaccinia Virus
Vaccinia virus is unique because it is an artiﬁcial
virus and does not occur in nature. Vaccinia virus
was used as the smallpox vaccine. Vaccinia virus
is the source of the modern smallpox vaccine used
to eradicate smallpox. However, the virus’s origin

has remained quite mysterious in the absence of
records. However, certain researchers have made
it clear that the cowpox virus that Jenner initially
used for the smallpox vaccine is related but not
similar to the vaccinia virus. Recent ﬁndings sug-
gest a common ancestral origin of smallpox, cow-
pox and vaccinia, whereas the ancient vaccinia
share high genetic similarities (>99%) with the
horsebox virus.
Other Poxviruses
745
Irrespective of the debate on the origin of
this virus, the virus has found tremendous
applications in the ﬁeld of vaccination and
genetic engineering and so mostly maintained
across laboratories for research and development
purposes. Due to its relatively large genome size
natural gene delivery methods, the vaccina virus
has been widely used as a DNA vector in the
genetic engineering ﬁeld. The environmental
presence of the virus in wild-type form, although
not common, yet was also reported in very limited
cases of infection. For example, the USA reported
cases of vaccinia infection in 2007 and 2010.
Fig. 52.1 Schematic
diagram of structure of a
vaccinia virus
This
vaccinia
virus
could
be
readily
differentiated from fresh isolates of cowpox and
smallpox viruses. Vaccinia virus is now being
extensively studied in greater detail than variola,
as it is safer to work with (Fig. 52.1). The virus is
also being used as a vector for developing recom-
binant vaccines.
Both
vaccinia
and
variola
viruses
show
similarities in their morphology. They, however,
can be differentiated by their growth properties
and host range. Vaccinia virus can be cultured
in vitro on CAM. The virus is identiﬁed by its
characteristic pock lesion on the CAM. The vac-
cinia virus produces relatively larger, irregular,
ﬂat and necrotic lesions, some of which may be
haemorrhagic (Table 52.2). Vaccinia virus has
recently been shown to be closely related to the
New World orthopoxviruses, Cantagalo and
Aracatuba viruses.
Vaccinia virus, which is used for vaccination,
can also cause infection in humans. Vaccinia
causes infection by accidental inoculation of the

C

skin. At the inoculation site, the lesion begins
as a maculopapular rash, progressing to vesicle
pustules and ﬁnally leading to the formation of a
scab. The lesion heals with the formation of
marked scarring. Vaccinia virus in patients
with eczema causes e. vaccinata, and in patients
with
immunodeﬁciency
causes
progressive
vaccinia.

Monkeypox
Monkeypox can cause infection in humans and
produce a disease similar to smallpox. This virus
was ﬁrst isolated in 1958 from captive monkeys
kept for research in Copenhagen, so the name
‘monkeypox’ was given.
Although monkeypox has been deﬁned as zoo-
notic, the animal reservoir host is still unknown.
However, African rodents are suspected of
playing a part in transmission. The ﬁrst reported
human infection occurred in 1970 from the Dem-
ocratic Republic of Congo and later was found in
central and western African countries. Outside the
African continent, the virus was reported to cause
infection in the United States (2003), the United
Kingdom (2018) and Israel (2018).
Clinically,
monkeypox
cannot
be
distin-
guished from smallpox. The condition manifests
with the development of a generalised pustule,
rash, fever and toxaemia. Electron microscopy is
useful to demonstrate the virion particles in clini-
cal specimens to diagnose the condition. In the
United States, the smallpox vaccine, antivirals
and
vaccinia
immune
globulin
(VIG)
are
suggested to control monkeypox infection.
Buffalopox
Buffalopox, believed to be caused by the vaccinia
virus, occurs among buffaloes in India. In the
infected buffaloes, the viruses produce pustular
lesions on the teats and udders of lactating
buffaloes. The individuals, such as milkmen com-
ing in contact with these infected buffaloes, suffer
from the infection. The lesions usually develop on
the hands and faces of the milkmen. Buffalopox
appears to be distinct from variola and vaccinia
viruses. Smallpox vaccine does not confer protec-
tion against infection by buffalopox.
Cowpox
Human infection with cowpox is usually an occu-
pational hazard. Cowpox resembles variola and
vaccinia
viruses
antigenically
but
can
be
differentiated by the haemorrhagic lesions it
produces on CAM and rabbit skin.
Cowpox infection in cows produces ulcers on
the teats and udders. It may spread to other cows
and humans during the process of milking. Natu-
ral cowpox infection has also been noted in wild
animals kept in zoos, including cheetahs and
elephants and domestic cats. Rodents or cats but
not cows have been suggested as the primary host
of cowpox infection.

Milker node or paravaccinia is an occupational
disease acquired by humans during milking
infected cows. The common lesions include
small ulcerating nodules (Fig. 52.2). The condi-
tion presents as painful and haemorrhagic lesions
on the hands and face associated with pyrexia and
other constitutional disturbances. The virus is dis-
tinct from cowpox and grows in bovine kidney
cell culture but not in embryonated eggs.
Orf
Orf is an infection of humans caused by a virus of
contagious pustular dermatitis of sheep and goats.
The disease occurs as a single chronic granulo-
matous lesion with a central ulcer in humans. The
lesions are usually present on the hands, forearm
or occasionally on the face. The lesions heal
without forming any scars. The virus resembles
the paravaccinia virus morphologically.
Molluscum Contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus unique to
humans. After smallpox was eradicated, this is the
only poxvirus having a human reservoir and not
zoonotic. The virus causes a disease of the skin,
often spread through sexual contact among young
adults. It causes small, pink, papular pearl-like
benign tumours of the skin or mucous membranes
(Fig. 52.3). These lesions are present on the epi-
dermis and occur in most body parts except on
soles and palms. Lesions are more commonly
found in the trunk and anogenital areas. This is
a self-limiting condition, and the condition gener-
ally resolves over some time.

Molluscum contagiosum in patients with HIV
may cause chronic and extensive skin lesions.
Sections of the nodular lesions show hyaline
acidophilic inclusion bodies called molluscum
bodies. These inclusion bodies can be seen in
the cells of the stratum corneum and the stratum
granulosum. Their bodies are large and measure
20–30 μm in size and are composed of large
numbers of virion particles embedded in a protein
matrix (Fig. 52.4).

Tanapox
Tanapox virus was ﬁrst isolated from the cases
of febrile illness that occurred along the Tana
River in Kenya during the 1950s. The virus
produces a single, pock-like vesicular lesion on
the skin, which usually does not progress to form
pustules. This lesion is most commonly seen on
the upper part of the body. The virus is acquired

by insect bites from monkeys and other wild
animal reservoirs. It is antigenically not related
to other poxviruses. The virus grows in human
and
monkey
tissue
cultures
but
not
in
embryonated eggs.
Yabapox

Yabapox
Yabapox virus produces large benign tumours
in monkeys. It causes benign histiocytomas
5–20
days
after
muscular
or
subcutaneous
inoculation in monkeys. Such lesions have
been
reported in
persons handling
affected
monkeys.
At present, the treatment of poxvirus infection
in humans is supportive in the absence of any
licensed drugs. Cidofovir has been approved for
use in the emergency treatment of orthopoxvirus
infections
in
humans
and
complications
post-vaccination. Poxvirus infections may result
in
secondary
infections
where
the
use
of
antibiotic ointments is suggested. Curettage and
cryotherapy of large lesions are often considered
for infection due to Molluscum contagiosum.
Case Study
All doctors and nurses want to be vaccinated with
the smallpox vaccine in a hospital because of a
sudden threat of bioterrorism this year. Since
there is a limited supply of smallpox vaccine,
the hospital authorities formulate a guideline to
vaccinate only those medical and paramedical
staff who were not vaccinated earlier.

Which year was the vaccination by smallpox
vaccine stopped in India?
•
Which age population in India will be the most
susceptible group to smallpox in case of a

•
After vaccination, at what point the staff
receiving the smallpox vaccine will be consid-
ered to be fully protected from smallpox?
•
How will you diagnose smallpox that occurs in

Herpesviruses
53
The herpesviruses are large, enveloped DNA
viruses, measuring 120–200 nm in diameter.
They exhibit many common features, such as
similar morphology of virions, the basic mode
of replication in the host cells and the capability
to establish latent and recurrent infections. All
herpesviruses are structurally similar.
Herpesviruses
Herpesviruses are a group of viruses that are
placed in the family in Group I of Baltimore
Classiﬁcations of Viruses. They exhibit many
common features, such as similar morphology of
virions, the basic mode of replication in the host
cells and the capability to establish latent and
recurrent infections.
Some members of the family can infect
humans and are prevalent worldwide. Common
infections include oral and genital herpes and
chickenpox. Historically the infection was traced
back to ancient Greek times where cutaneous
spreading of lesions was deﬁned with the Greek
word “herpes” to mean “to creep or crawl”.
All herpesviruses are structurally similar. The
virus
has
a
characteristic
morphology
and
consists of four distinct structural elements:
DNA core, capsid, tegument and envelope.
DNA core consists of a linear double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) molecule surrounded by a protein
coat. DNA genome size ranges from 125 to
240 kbp with 32–75% G + C content depending
on the virus species. Capsid surrounds the DNA
core.
It
consists
of
an
icosahedral
capsid
containing 162 units known as capsomeres. The
tegument is an amorphous material present
between the capsid and envelope. It contains
viral proteins and enzymes that initiate the repli-
cation of the virus. The envelope surrounds the
nucleocapsid. The glycoprotein-containing enve-
lope is derived from the modiﬁed host cell nuclear
membrane. It carries surface spikes.

Herpesviruses
replicate
in
the
host
cell
nucleus, and both replication and assembly
occur in the nucleus. The virus buds from the
nuclear membrane are released by exocytosis
and cell lysis. This family of viruses are known
for the epitome of host speciﬁcity, co-evolution
with the host and the immune evasion mechanism
that permit them to remain latent for lifelong and
recur under stress.
As such, detailed and extensive research has
been done on these viruses in basic and applied
ﬁelds. However, handling these viruses during
research poses varying degrees of health risks to
the worker, so members were placed in different
risk groups that enable the adoption of laboratory
containment features for safe handling. The
“Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant
DNA Research and Biocontainment” issued by
the Department of Biotechnology, Govt of India
in 2018 have classiﬁed the human herpesviruses
1, 3, 6 and 7 in Risk Group 2, whereas human
herpesvirus 2, Herpesvirus simiae (Herpes B;

Classification and Host Range
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) has recently updated the classiﬁcation of
the family Herpesviridae by introducing new
genera and species in the family. At present, the
family
is
classiﬁed
into
three
subfamilies,
17 genera and 115 species.
Herpesviruses are highly host speciﬁc and
evolve synchronously with their hosts. Species
of the family are known to infect many hosts,
including humans, animals, birds, ﬁsh, reptiles,
amphibians and molluscs. However, out of the
115 species known to date, only eight species
have human hosts, i.e. capable of infecting
humans and are epidemiologically important.
They are ofﬁcially designated as human herpesvi-
rus types 1–8, but the common names are still
used (Table 53.1). The diseases caused are men-
tioned in Table 53.2.
Despite strong host speciﬁcity, species of the
family share many properties that potentially
make them capable of crossing the species
barriers, although not natural. In very rare cases,
species zoonotic transmission (animal to human)
and vice versa of the viruses have been noted.
Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CeHV-1, Herpes B
Virus, B virus) is considered the most signiﬁcant
zoonotic
herpesvirus
that
can
jump
from
macaques to humans. In contrast, Human herpes-
virus 1 is capable of causing severe disease in
primates.
Herpes Simplex Virus
Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are extremely
host-adapted viruses. They can cause a wide vari-
ety of illnesses in infected human hosts. There are
two types of HSVs: herpes simplex virus type
1
(HSV-1) and
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2 (HSV-2). Both types are closely related in
their DNA homology, antigenic determinants, tis-
sue tropism and disease symptoms but differ in
epidemiology. HSV-1 is transmitted primarily by
contact with infected saliva, whereas HSV-2 is
transmitted by sexual contact or genital tract
infection to the newborn from an infected mother.

Morphology
HSVs are large, enveloped, icosadeltahedral
viruses containing a dsDNA genome (Fig. 53.1).
The genomes of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are
similar in organisation and show a higher degree
of sequence homology. They, however, can be
differentiated by restriction enzyme analysis of
viral DNA. The unique feature of the DNA
genome is that it encodes for as few as
80 polypeptides. Half of the proteins are required
for the replication of viruses, whereas other
proteins help in the interaction of the viruses
with different host cells and immune responses.
Physical and Chemical Properties
Like other enveloped viruses, HSVs are sensitive
to treatment with acid, fat solvents, detergents and
drying. They are readily inactivated in the
conditions prevalent in the gastrointestinal tract.
Laboratory Isolation
Chick Embryo
The virus grows on the chorioallantoic membrane
of the embryonated egg and produces small,
white, shining, non-necrotic pocks measuring
less than 0.5 mm in diameter. Both HSV-1 and
HSV-2 show cross-reaction.
Tissue Culture
HSV grows in a variety of primary and continu-
ous cell lines. They grow readily on HeLa cells,
Hep-2 cells, human embryonic ﬁbroblasts and
rabbit kidney cells. HSV typically produces
Cowdry type A acidophilic inclusion bodies.
These are well-deﬁned foci with heaped-up cells
in the infected cell lines. Many strains of HSV
also produce syncytial and giant cells in the
infected cells. The virus kills the cells rapidly in
tissue culture.
A cell line that expresses beta-galactosidase
after infection with HSV is a new approach for
isolating and identifying the virus in the cell lines.
The addition of a chromotropic substrate allows
the detection of enzymes in the infected cell.
Pathogenesis of Herpes Simplex Virus
Infection
HSV shows three unique biological properties:
(1) neurovirulence, (2) latency and (3) reactivation
and replication.
The viruses show neurovirulence, which can
invade and multiply in the nervous system. The
establishment and maintenance of latent infection

in the nerve cell ganglion (latency) is the unique
property of the virus. HSV-1 affects most com-
monly the trigeminal ganglion, whereas HSV-2
affects the sacral nerve root ganglion (S2–S5).
Reactivation and replication of latent HSV can
lead to overt or covert recurrent infections and
excretion of HSV. Reactivation can be caused by
various stimuli, including fever, trauma, emo-
tional stress and sunlight. In immunocompetent
patients, HSV-1 reactivates more frequently in
the oral cavity than on the genital parts, but
HSV-2 reactivates eight to ten times more fre-
quently in the genital parts compared to orolabial
infection. In immunocompromised patients, reac-
tivation by either HSV-1 or HSV-2 is more fre-
quent and more severe. The viruses cause
disseminated
infection
in
individuals
with
HIV-related disease and people with impaired
T-cell
immunity,
such
as
organ
transplant
recipients.

HSV Transmission
HSV-1 infection is mainly transmitted orally
through saliva and leads to oral herpes. It is usu-
ally transmitted by oral contacts, such as kissing
or
sharing
toothbrushes
or
other
saliva-contaminated items. Virus transmission
can occur from asymptomatic individuals. How-
ever, the risk increases when there are active
sores. HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the geni-
tal area through oral–genital contact and leads to
genital herpes. In rare circumstances, a mother
with genital HSV-1 infection can transmit the
virus to the infant during delivery leading to neo-
natal herpes. Patients having oral herpes infection
are unlikely to be subsequently infected with
HSV-1 in the genital area. Autoinoculation may
also cause infection of the eye.
HSV-2 infection is a sexually transmitted dis-
ease. The virus is transmitted during sexual activ-
ity during contact with genital surfaces, skin,
sores or ﬂuids of an infected individual. Virus
transmission
can
occur
from
asymptomatic
individuals. However, the risk increases when
there are active sores. The infection can also be
transmitted from an infected mother to a child
during delivery and by autoinoculation in rare
cases. A positive correlation has been found
between HSV-2 and HIV infection in terms of
virus transmissibility. HSV-2 infection increases

the risk of acquiring a new HIV infection by
approximately threefold. As such, HSV-2 is the
most common infection in HIV-positive patients.
Herpes Simplex Virus
755
Replication of Virus
HSV infection is initiated by direct contact and
depends on the infected tissues, whether oral,
genital
or
brain.
The
infection
occurs
by
inoculating the virus into susceptible mucosal
surfaces, such as the oropharynx, conjunctiva or
cervix or through small abrasions on the skin.
The viruses infect cells of ectodermal origin,
the cells coming in contact with infected material,
such as saliva or genital secretion. Viruses repli-
cate at the site of entry in the skin or mucous
membrane. The neuroinvasiveness, neurotoxicity
and latency properties of HSV inﬂuence the
course of infection in an infected host.
The virus multiplies locally with cell-to-cell
spread. The virus replicates in the infected cells
at the base of the lesion and infects the
innervating neuron. HSV grows very rapidly in
infected cells, requiring only 8–16 h for comple-
tion and usually causes lytic infection of the
ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells. After entry into
the cell, the virion is uncoated, the genome is
released and the genome DNA enters into the
nucleus. The mRNA is transcribed by host cell
RNA polymerase and then translated into early
non-structural proteins. Subsequently, the viral
DNA polymerase replicates the genome DNA,
during which the synthesis of early proteins is
stopped, but the synthesis of late structural
proteins
begins.
These
late
proteins
are
transported to the nucleus, where virion assembly
occurs. The virion acquires its envelope by bud-
ding through the nuclear membrane.
Subsequently, the viruses travel by retrograde
transport to the ganglion, such as the trigeminal
ganglion for HSV-1 and the sacral ganglion for
HSV-2. The virus then returns to the initial site of
infection and may cause inapparent infection or
produce vesicular lesions. Thin-walled umbili-
cated vesicles—the roof of which breaks down,
leaving tiny superﬁcial ulcers—are the typical
lesions caused by HSV. These vesicles heal with-
out forming any scars. The vesicle ﬂuid contains
infectious virions.
After
this
retrograde
axonal
ﬂow
from
neurons, the viral genomes become latent in the
ganglia, particularly those of the trigeminal
(HSV-1) and sacral (HSV-2) nerves. No viral
particles are produced during this phase of
latency. Also, latent infection in neurons does
not cause any demonstrable damage in neurons.
This latency phase may be reactivated periodi-
cally in some individuals, causing recurrent oral
and genital lesions (Fig. 53.2).
Various stimuli, such as physical or emotional
stress, trauma, fever and sunlight, can induce a
recurrence in which the virus travels back down
the nerve, leaving lesions to develop on the skin
at the same spot each time. These stimuli trigger
reactivation by (1) facilitating virus replication in
the nerve; (2) inhibiting cell-mediated immunity
(CMI) transiently or (3) inducing both the
mechanisms.
Host Immunity
Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role
in conferring immunity to HSV infection and
facilitates recovery from the infection. Hence,
the virus tends to cause more frequent and severe
infections in patients with altered CMI, such as
HIV and other CMI-deﬁcient diseases. Tissue
damage occurring in HSV infection is due to a
combination of viral pathology and immunopa-
thology. These immunopathologic effects of CMI
and inﬂammatory responses are the major causes
of symptoms seen during the disease.
Thus, recurrences or reactivation of infection
can occur even in the presence of speciﬁc
antibodies. However, the recurrent infections are
more localised, less severe and of short duration
than the primary infection due to the presence of
past memory immune responses.
Clinical Syndromes
HSV
causes
a
wide
variety
of
clinical
manifestations.
The
clinical
manifestations
depend on (1) age and immune status of the
host,
(2)
antigenic
type
of
the
virus
and
(3) anatomical site of the infection. Generally,
HSV-1 produces lesions above the waist, and

HSV-2 produces lesions below the waist, whereas
HSV-2 is associated with genital infections. Pri-
mary infection with either virus is typically
associated with systemic signs, prolonged dura-
tion, increased severity of illness and more
complications.

HSV-1 Infection
HSV-1 can cause a wide variety of clinical
entities.
Acute Herpetic Gingivostomatitis
This is the manifestation of primary HSV-1 infec-
tion occurring in children between 6 months and
5 years. Saliva from an infected child or an adult
is the source of infection. Gingivitis is the most
important manifestation with marked lip swelling
and erythematous and friable gums. Vesicular
lesions appear on the oral mucosa, tongue and
lips. These lesions subsequently rupture and coa-
lesce together, leaving behind ulcerated plaques.
Viral shedding from the saliva may continue for
3 weeks or more.
Acute Herpetic Pharyngotonsillitis
The condition manifests as pharyngitis and ton-
sillitis in adults more frequently than gingivos-
tomatitis. The vesicular lesions on the tonsils and
the posterior pharynx usually rupture to form
ulcers.
Herpes labialis
It is the recurrence of oral HSV-1 infection
(Fig. 53.3). Pain, burning and tingling sensation
at the site of infection are presenting features. An
intraepidermal vesicle that later becomes pustular
and ulcerate is the typical lesion.
Other HSV-1 Infections
These include Herpetic whitlow, an infection of
the ﬁnger of health workers, including doctors
and nurses. The entry of the virus causes the
infection through cuts or abrasions on the skin.
Other infections include Eczema herpeticum
seen in children with active eczema. Herpes
febrilis or fever blisters are infections of the
skin that appear on the forehead and around the

mouth in the face. These lesions subsequently
rupture and coalesce together, leaving behind
ulcerated plaques. Herpes encephalitis is an
acute febrile disease that is usually caused by
HSV-1. This may be a manifestation of primary
or recurrent infection with the virus. Ocular her-
pes can be a primary or recurrent HSV-1 infec-
tion.
Primary
ocular
herpes
may
manifest
keratoconjunctivitis, dendritic ulcers in the cornea
and follicular conjunctivitis with the formation of
vesicles on the eyelids. The recurrent ocular her-
pes
manifests
as
conjunctivitis,
keratitis,
iridocyclitis, cataract, etc.

HSV-2 Infection
HSV-2 causes following clinical conditions.
Genital Herpes
Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 but
can also be caused by HSV-1. Most primary
genital infections are asymptomatic. The clinical
manifestations of primary genital herpes caused
by HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar. In symptomatic
men, the herpetic vesicles appear in the glans
penis, the prepuce, shaft of the penis and some-
times on the scrotum, thighs and buttocks. In
women, the vesicles appear on the external geni-
talia, labia majora, labia minora, vaginal vestibule
and introitus. Recurrent genital herpes is more
common with HSV-2 as compared to HSV-1.
The condition is shorter in duration and less
severe than primary genital herpes.
Neonatal Infection
Neonatal infection is a most serious and usually
fatal disease caused mostly by HSV-2. It usually
occurs due to the shedding of HSV-2 from the
cervix during vaginal delivery. It can also occur
from an ascending in-utero infection during the
primary infection of the mother. The infection can
also be acquired postnatally from family members
or hospital staff. Neonatal herpes is conﬁned to
the mouth, eyes or skin. Since CMI is poorly
developed
in
neonates,
the
virus
causes
a
disseminated disease with involvement of the
liver, lung and organs of the CNS. The condition
has a high mortality of 80%. Progression of the
infection to the CNS results in mental retardation
or neurological disabilities even with treatment,
or may ﬁnally lead to death.
Mother acquiring HSV infection for the ﬁrst
time in late pregnancy poses a higher risk of
neonatal herpes, whereas women with genital
herpes before pregnancy pose a very low risk of
transmitting HSV to their infants.
Aseptic Meningitis
Aseptic meningitis may occur as a complication
of genital HSV-2 infection. It is a self-limiting

disease,
with
CSF
showing
lymphocytic
pleocytosis and viruses by culture.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include saliva, vesicle ﬂuid, conjunctival
ﬂuid, corneal scraping, skin swab, skin scrapings
and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).
Microscopy
Light microscopy of the stained infected cell
may show ballooning of cells, ground glass nuclei
and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions and mul-
tinucleated giant cells. Giemsa-stained smears
show type A inclusion bodies in the nuclei of
the infected cell. Electron microscopy is used
for direct demonstration of virions in the nega-
tively stained smears of the vesicle ﬂuid.
Tzanck Smear
It is a rapid and sensitive method. In this proce-
dure, the vesicular lesion is aseptically ruptured,
and the base of the lesion is scraped with a scal-
pel. The scraping from the base of the lesion is
smeared on a glass slide, air dried, ﬁxed and
usually stained for 15 seconds with1% aqueous
solution of toluidine blue. Demonstration of
ground glass chromatin (Tzanck cells) with eosin-
ophilic intranuclear inclusions and multinucleated
giant cells is characteristic of blue. HSV 1, HSV
2 or varicella-zoster infection (Fig. 53.4).
Direct Antigen Detection
Direct enzyme immunoassay and direct ﬂuores-
cent antibody tests are useful to demonstrate HSV
antigens directly in vesicular ﬂuid, tissue smear or
biopsy.
Tissue Culture
A deﬁnitive diagnosis of HSV infection is made
by isolating the viruses in tissue cultures. For
culture, scrapings of skin vesicles and mucosal
lesions are inoculated in HeLa cells, Hep-2 cells
or human embryonic ﬁbroblasts. After inocula-
tion, HSV produces cytopathic effects (CPEs)
within 1–3 days on HeLa cells, Hep-2 cells and
human embryonic ﬁbroblasts. Cowdry type A
acidophilic inclusions are produced by HSV.
These
cells
become
enlarged
and
appear
ballooned. HSV-2 causes the fusion of infected
cells, leading to syncytium formation. Immuno-
ﬂuorescent staining of infected tissue culture is

useful to conﬁrm the diagnosis within 24 h. Poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) is a useful tool to
distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2.

Virus Typing
Isolated HSV strains can be typed by biochemi-
cal, immunological and molecular methods.
Serology
Serodiagnosis is of little value for the diagnosis of
primary HSV infection. It is mainly used for
epidemiological studies and to determine post-
exposure to HSV. It is not useful for diagnosing
recurrent infections because the rise in antibody
titre does not usually correlate with recurrent dis-
ease. Also, the serological tests cannot distinguish
between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies due to
cross-reactivity.
Molecular Detection
Real-time PCR is useful for the demonstration of
viral genome directly in vesicular ﬂuid, skin
scraping, CSF, etc., for diagnosis of the disease.
PCR is also used to detect asymptomatic shedding
of HSV in skin lesions and genotyping the virus.
Ampliﬁcation of herpes genomes by PCR is also
being increasingly used for diagnosing HSV
infection of the brain by examining the brain
biopsy specimen. HSV-1 and HSV-2 types can
be distinguished by nucleic acid hybridisation,

Treatment
HSV infections are among the few non-HIV viral
infections that can be treated with antiviral ther-
apy. Treatment with speciﬁc antiviral chemother-
apy is used to (1) prevent disease and recurrence,
(2) treat the infection and (3) reduce the clinical
course of infection.
Antiviral drugs, like acyclovir, famciclovir
and valacyclovir, are the choice for treating
HSV infection. Oral antivirals are used to treat
orolabial and genital infections and topical for
herpetic keratoconjunctivitis. Intravenous treat-
ment is used for life-threatening and serious
HSV infections, such as encephalitis, and occa-
sional severe orolabial or genital cases.
Treatment is most effective when started
within a few hours after symptoms appear.
Penciclovir cream effectively reduces the healing
time and duration of symptoms of a cold sore by
about a day. However, such treatment can only

reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms
but cannot cure the infection. As such, both
HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are considered
lifelong.

Epidemiology
HSV infections are exclusively human diseases.
They are distributed worldwide. HSV-1 infection
is more common than HSV-2 infection. An
infected person is a lifelong source and reservoir
of the virus due to the latency of the infection.
Vesicle ﬂuid, saliva and vaginal secretions are the
important sources of infection for both types
of HSV.
Geographical Distribution
In a study published in 2016 on estimating the
global prevalence of HSV, it was noted that
infections are common across the globe and
mostly endemic. An estimated half a billion peo-
ple had genital infections with HSV type 2 or type
1, and several billion had oral HSV type 1 infec-
tion. The infections varied across age, sex and
geographical
regions.
Most
genital
HSV-1
infections were common in the Americas, Europe
and Western Paciﬁc, whereas HSV-2 was highest
among women in African Region. HSV-1 infec-
tion is more common than HSV-2 infection.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
HSV infections are exclusively human diseases.
Humans are the only natural reservoirs. No
vectors are involved in the transmission of the
disease. An infected person is a lifelong source
and reservoir of the virus. Vesicle ﬂuid, saliva and
vaginal secretions are the important sources of
infection for both types of HSV.
On coming in contact with oral and genital
secretions, medical and paramedical staff are at
increased risk for acquiring herpetic whitlow.
Immunocompromised individuals and neonates
are at high risk for developing the life-threatening
disseminated disease.
Prevention and Control
Prevention of HSV infection is difﬁcult because
most transmission occurs during sub-clinical viral
shedding. At present, no vaccine is available for
use against HSV. Current preventive strategies
are dependent on good practices. Recurrences of
infection can be prevented by avoiding the trigger

activities.
Contracting
the
infection
can
be
prevented by avoiding skin to skin oral contacts
and non-sharing of glass, saliva-contaminated
utensils and unprotected sexual activities.
Varicella-Zoster Virus
761
Despite the HSV infection affected almost
two-thirds
of
the
global
population
below
50, there are no clinical preventive strategies,
including vaccines. This is mostly because
(1) the transmission may occur even from asymp-
tomatic individuals, makes the early preventive
measure difﬁcult, and (2) owing to the complex
genetic functions, HSVs can remain hibernated
within our body and then periodically reoccurs,
all without alarming the host immune system by
taking refuge in the nervous system. This particu-
larly makes vaccine development challenging.
However, in recognition that better prevention
interventions are needed, WHO and other global
partners are working to accelerate research to
develop
new
strategies
for
preventing
and
controlling HSV infections.
Herpesvirus Simea: B Virus
Unlike other humans infecting herpesviruses,
Herpesvirus
simiae,
recently
designated
as
Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, has a zoonotic ori-
gin and is by far the most important zoonotic
threat to human health caused by a member of
the herpesvirus family. It was ﬁrst isolated in
1934 by Sabin and Wright. The virus was
demonstrated in the brain of laboratory staff,
who died from ascending myelitis following a
bite by an apparently healthy monkey. This
virus was named as B virus from the initial
name of this patient. Since then, many cases
have been reported in the literature.
The virus naturally causes a virtually asymp-
tomatic to a very mild infection in natural hosts,
i.e. Asian macaques (Macaca mulatta and Macaca
fascicularis). It is transmitted to humans when
bitten or scratched by an infected macaque mon-
key or individuals coming in contact with the
monkey’s eyes, nose or mouth, but needle-stick
injuries and even airborne infections were also
reported.
Person-to-person
transmission
is
extremely rare, and only one case has been
reported to date.
In humans, the disease is usually fatal. Neuro-
logical sequelae are seen in patients who rarely
survive the condition. For that reason, B virus-
infected animals are culled.
Varicella-Zoster Virus
Human herpesvirus 3 (commonly known as vari-
cella-zoster virus (VZV)) belong to the genus
Varicellovirus of subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.
It causes two distinct clinical entities in
humans: (1) chickenpox (varicella) and (2) herpes
zoster or shingles. Chickenpox is acquired by
VZV transmission from an infected host to a
susceptible host, whereas herpes zoster occurs
due to reactivation of the latent virus and
subsequent replication and viral spreads along
the nerve ﬁbres to the skin. Contact with a case
of zoster or chickenpox may transmit chickenpox
but not herpes zoster.
Immunity following varicella is lifelong; the
individual does not suffer from varicella again but
can suffer from herpes zoster despite having
immunity to varicella. Immunity is also lifelong
in herpes zoster.
Morphology
Varicella-zoster virus is an enveloped, dsDNA
virus showing many similarities with the HSV.
It has the smallest genome of all the human
herpesviruses and shows fascicular is a replicative
cycle similar to HSV.
Laboratory Isolation
The virus grows readily in cultures of human
ﬁbroblasts, human amnion or HeLa cells. These
cell cultures show an apoptotic effect similar to
that seen in HSV-infected cells, but the lesions are
less marked than those produced by HSV. Also,
the CPE appears after a longer incubation period.

The viruses remain associated with the cells in
culture and are not found free in the media. The
virus does not grow in chick embryos or experi-
mental animals.
762
53
Herpesviruses
Pathogenesis of VZV Infection
Chickenpox
is
the
primary
VZV
infection,
whereas herpes zoster represents reactivation of
a previous infection.
Transmission
Only chickenpox is transmitted. It is transmitted
through direct contact with an infected person’s
blisters, saliva or mucus or indirectly by touching
contaminated items freshly soiled, such as cloth-
ing, from an infected person. Blisters that are dry
and crusted could not spread chickenpox. The
virus can also be transmitted through the air by
coughing and sneezing.
Primary VZV infection occurs in humans
when the virus comes into contact with the
mucosa of the respiratory tract or conjunctiva.
From these sites, the virus enters the bloodstream
and lymphatic system to the cells of the reticulo-
endothelial system. After 11–13 days, a second-
ary viraemia occurs, and the virus spreads
throughout the body and to the skin. VZV spreads
from cell to cell via direct contact to produce its
effects in tissues. After primary infection, the
virus migrates along the sensory nerve ﬁbres to
the satellite cells of the dorsal root ganglia or
cranial nerve ganglia, where it becomes latent.
This latency may be permanent, or the virus
may become reactivated in old adults or patients
with impaired cellular immunity.
Herpes zoster occurs due to reactivation of the
VZV, which has remained latent in one or more
sensory ganglia following primary varicella many
years earlier. The viruses travel down along the
sensory nerve to produce painful vesicles in the
skin (dermatome) areas innervated by the nerves
from the affected ganglia. The virus replicates and
spreads along the nerve ﬁbres to the skin on
reactivation, known as herpes zoster or shingles.
Immunity
Cell-mediated
immunity
is
important
in
controlling the infection. It limits the progression
of the disease and results in early resolution of the
disease. The virus causes a disseminated life-
threatening and more serious disease in immuno-
compromised patients with a deﬁcient CMI.
Depression of the CMI during life in old age
may cause VZV and herpes zoster recurrence.
Humoral antibodies also play an important role
by limiting the spread of the virus in circulation.
CMI also contributes to the immunopathology
and symptomatology in the infected host. In
some infected adults, it is responsible for more
severe manifestations and more extensive cell
damage than seen in children.
Clinical Syndromes
Varicella-zoster virus causes two distinct clinical
syndromes: varicella (chickenpox) and (herpes
zoster (shingles).
Varicella (Chickenpox)
Varicella (Chickenpox) is one of the ﬁve child-
hood exanthemata along with measles, rubella,
rubeola and ﬁfth disease. It is mainly a disease
of children, characterised by an exanthematous
varicella rash that occurs following infection
with VZV.
After an incubation period of around 2 weeks,
a secondary viraemia occurs, and the virus
spreads throughout the body and to the skin.
The
condition
manifests
as
fever
and
maculopapular rash that progresses to thin-walled
vesicle on an erythematous base within a few
hours. This vesicle, the hallmark of chickenpox,
is characteristically surrounded by a red ring. The
vesicle, which measures approximately 2–4 mm
in diameter, becomes a pustule within 12 h and
begins to ulcerate, after which scabs appear. All
the stages, including macule, papule, vesicle, pus-
tule and scab, evolve very rapidly, especially in
children. As a result, at any given time, all stages
of the lesions are seen on the skin.

Varicella-Zoster Virus
763
The skin lesions are characteristically centrip-
etal in distribution. They are more commonly
present on the trunk than on the extremities. Typ-
ically, they are also present on the scalp. Lesions
typically occur in the mucous membrane in the
mouth, conjunctiva and vagina. All these features
help distinguish chickenpox from many other
exanthematous
diseases.
Secondary
bacterial
infection followed by scarring is the noted com-
plication in the children.
Chicken Pox in Pregnancy
Varicella-zoster virus tends to cause more serious
disease in pregnancy if the mother has not been
infected during childhood. The virus crosses the
placenta and causes congenital infection in the
foetus. Congenital malformation with hypoplasia
of limbs, chorioretinitis and skin scarring is seen
in the foetus infected during pregnancy.
The complications in the baby may vary
according to the period of gestation when the
woman contracts chickenpox. If the mother
develops chickenpox during the ﬁrst half of the
pregnancy, the foetus will usually be asymptom-
atic. However, in some infants, it progresses into
foetal varicella syndrome. The condition is
characterised by cicatrising skin lesions, limb
hypoplasia, chorioretinitis and CNS defects.
If the mother contracts varicella close to the
delivery period, the babies might develop neona-
tal varicella within 2 weeks after birth. If the
mother develops chickenpox a week or more
before the delivery, she passes VZV and IgG
antibodies to her baby through the placenta. In
such cases, the baby will be infected with the
virus, but clinical symptoms may not appear.
This is because VZV-speciﬁc antibodies will
inhibit
VZV
multiplication.
If
the
mother
develops chickenpox less than a week before
delivery, she passes only VZV to her baby but
not the antibodies. Hence, the babies develop
neonatal varicella. This is a serious disseminating
disease, mostly causing pneumonia and encepha-
litis. Such babies are treated with VZV antiserum
and chemotherapy soon after birth.
Herpes Zoster (Shingles)
Herpes zoster (Shingles) is typically a disease of
older adults aged 50 years and more, although it
can be seen at any age. The condition occurs
following a recurrence of chickenpox acquired
many years earlier. This occurs due to the reacti-
vation of the virus, which has remained latent in
one or more sensory ganglia due to the residual
immunity. This occurs due to the waning of
immunity,
followed
by
some
precipitating
factors.
Severe pain in the area of mucosa or skin
preceding the appearance of the rash is the hall-
mark of the disease. The rash, unlike in varicella
infections, has limited distributions. They are
restricted to a dermatome covering either head,
neck or trunk. For example, if thoracic nerve
supplies are affected, rashes commonly appear
on the chest walls. The rashes are distributed on
the scalp and forehead when the ophthalmic nerve
of
trigeminal
ganglion
is
affected.
The
accompanying pain and herpetic neuralgia are
very much severe at times.
Herpes
zoster
is
associated
with
many
complications. Zoster of the seventh nerve gan-
glion may cause Bell palsy and Ramsay Hunt
syndrome. This is caused by the reactivation of
the virus involving the facial and auditory nerves.
Post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syn-
drome caused by the virion. Herpes zoster
ophthalmicus is the most serious and devastating
form of acute herpes zoster (Fig. 53.5). The con-
dition occurs due to reactivation of the ﬁfth cra-
nial (trigeminal) nerve.
Laboratory Diagnosis
In almost all cases, the diagnosis of chickenpox
and herpes zoster is always clinical.
Specimens
These include skin lesion, respiratory secretions,
organ biopsy and serum.

Direct Antigen Detection
Direct
ﬂuorescent
antibody
test
employing
antibodies against viral membrane antigen (ﬂuo-
rescent antibody to membrane antigen, FAMA) is
used to detect membrane antigen of the virus
directly
in
the
skin
scrapings
and
biopsy
specimens. The counter current immunoelectro-
phoresis (CIEP) using zoster immune serum I was
also used earlier to detect antigen directly in the
vesicular ﬂuid.
Virus Isolation
Specimens from buccal or skin lesions collected
during the early stage of the disease are cultured
on human amnion, human ﬁbroblast and HeLa or
Vero cells. VZV produces a CPE similar to HSV
but is less conspicuous and takes a long time to
develop. VZV does not grow in the chicken
embryo or laboratory animals.
Serology
Both indirect ﬂuorescent antibody and ELISA are
employed
to
detect
serum
antibodies.
The
antibody-based tests are useful mainly for epide-
miological studies rather than for the diagnosis of
individual cases.
Molecular Detection
PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting
viral genomes in skin scrapings or biopsy
specimens.
Treatment
Acyclovir,
famciclovir
and
valacyclovir
are
antiviral agents available for treatment. Treatment
is recommended for adults and immunocompro-
mised patients with varicella infection and herpes

zoster infections. It is usually not indicated for the
treatment of varicella infection in children.
Epstein–Barr Virus
765
Epidemiology
Chickenpox is mainly a disease of children. In
herpes zoster infection, people of all ages are
affected. However, the incidence of the disease
increases with age due to the decrease in immune
functions that occurs during ageing.
Geographical Distribution
Varicella-zoster virus is a highly infective patho-
gen distributed worldwide.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Chickenpox is exclusively a human disease. No
animal reservoirs are present. Chickenpox or her-
pes zoster patient is the source of infection. VZV
is shed mainly in the respiratory secretions and
the vesicular lesions of the skin. The infectivity is
maximum during the early stage of the disease
when the virus is shed in large numbers in respi-
ratory secretions. The buccal lesions and vesicu-
lar ﬂuid, which are rich in virus content, are
highly infectious and are sources of infection.
Scabs do not contain any viruses, hence are
non-infectious. Chickenpox is transmitted pri-
marily by inhalation of respiratory secretions.
The infection may also occur by direct contact
with vesicular lesions on the skin. Herpes zoster
is a reactivation of latent VZV infection; hence it
is not acquired from an infected patient.
Prevention and Control
Prevention of transmission of varicella infection
in children is difﬁcult.
Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin
Varicella-zoster
immunoglobulin
(VZIg)
is
prepared
by
pooling
sera
from
patients
convalescing
from
herpes
zoster.
High-risk
patients, such as immunosuppressed children,
are protected by administering VZIg. The VZIg
is also used to treat medical and paramedical
personnel exposed to the virus and for the treat-
ment of newborns of infected mothers showing
symptoms within 5 days of delivery. It is, how-
ever, not useful as a therapy for the treatment of
patients suffering from active varicella or herpes
zoster disease.
Vaccines
A live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) is
being used for protection against VZV. This vac-
cine was ﬁrst developed by Takahashi in Japan in
1974 by attenuating strains of the varicella virus
by serial passage in human and guinea pig ﬁbro-
blast cell lines. The vaccine is given in a single
dose for children aged 1–12 years and in two
doses at 6–10 weeks’ intervals for older children.
Currently, single-antigen varicella vaccine and
combination measles, mumps, rubella and vari-
cella (MMRV) vaccine are available commer-
cially. At present, two doses of vaccination
schedules are approved. For children of age
group of 1–12 years, the ﬁrst dose at age
12 through 15 months is followed by the second
dose at age 4 through 6 years. However, for kids
above 13 years, two doses of the single-antigen
varicella vaccine are recommended at 4–8 weeks
apart. The MMRV vaccine is not approved for
people in this age group.
The vaccine is safe, protective and provides
long-lasting immunity. It stimulates the produc-
tion of protective antibodies and CMIs. The vac-
cine even confers protection in immunodeﬁcient
children. It is also used as a prophylactic agent for
the treatment of people even after exposure
to VZV.
Epstein–Barr Virus
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) or human herpesvirus
4 (HSV-4) is a gamma herpesvirus belonging to
the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. It shows
very limited host speciﬁcity. It is the causative
agent of infectious mononucleosis. It is also the
ﬁrst virus associated with human malignancies,

such as Burkitt lymphoma, another B-cell lym-
phoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
766
53
Herpesviruses
Morphology
Epstein–Barr virus is an enveloped DNA virus. It
consists of a genome, a capsid and an envelope.
The genome consists of a 172 kbp linear dsDNA.
It is surrounded by an icosahedral capsid com-
posed of capsomeres. Both the capsid and the
genome,
which
form
the
nucleocapsid,
are
enclosed
by
an
envelope
containing
glycoproteins. The envelope is derived from the
outer nuclear membrane of the host cell and
contains many proteins, which are expressed for
different types of infections.
Laboratory Isolation
The virus can grow in human embryonic lung
ﬁbroblast cultures. The CPE produced by the
virus is focal and is associated with refractile
ballooning of the cells. The CPE, unlike other
viruses, takes 2 or more weeks to develop.
Antigenic Properties
Epstein–Barr
viruses
contains
many
viral
antigens of diagnostic importance. These can be
classiﬁed as follows:
1. Late antigens, such as viral capsid antigen
(VCA) and viral envelope glycoprotein. The
VCA is the most important. The demonstra-
tion of the antigen indicates the presence of the
virus and active replication of the virus.
2. Early antigens (EAs) are always expressed
early in the lytic cycle. The presence of EAs
indicates virus replication.
3. Latent phase antigens include Epstein–Barr
nuclear antigen (EBNA) and LMPs. The pres-
ence of these antigens indicates the latency of
the virus in the infected cells.
EBV consists of two types of EBV-1 and
EBV-2, known as type A and type B strains,
respectively, based on differences in the latency
nuclear antigen genes. Both types cause the same
degree of clinical illness. They are prevalent
throughout the world and can simultaneously
infect the same person.
Other Properties
Epstein–Barr viruses are sensitive to the action of
ether and bile salts. They are relatively fragile and
do not survive for long outside the human body
ﬂuids.
Pathogenesis of Epstein–Barr Virus
Infection
Transmission
The infection is transmitted by (1) saliva through
close contact during the act of kissing; (2) sharing
of items, such as drinking glasses, cups and
toothbrushes; and (3) blood transfusion and by
organ and bone marrow transplantation. The EBV
enters B lymphocytes at the receptor site for the
C3 component of the complement. The virus
replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected epithe-
lial cells, and the replicative cycle is similar to
that of HSV.
Epstein–Barr virus in humans can cause either
(1) primary infections by multiplication in B cells
and epithelial celosia; (2) latent infection of B
cells or (3) transformation of B cells to immortal
plasmacytoid cells leading to malignancies.
Primary EBV infection ﬁrst occurs in the oro-
pharynx and then spreads to the blood, causing
infection of B lymphocytes. The virus is, there-
fore, present in large numbers in oropharyngeal
secretions. Hence, the infection is most com-
monly transmitted through infected saliva, often
due to kissing. Therefore, infectious mononucle-
osis is also commonly called the kissing disease.
The virus infection induces a strong immune
response,
comprising
circulating
antibodies
against
many
virus-speciﬁc
proteins,
cell-
mediated immune responses and production of
lymphokines. Humoral immunity is characterised
by the appearance of IgM antibodies ﬁrst against
the viral membrane antigen, followed by IgG
antibodies,
which
persist
for
life.
These

antibodies against viral membrane antigen confer
lifelong immunity against the second attack of
infectious mononucleosis. The CMI plays an
important role in controlling chronic infection
and limiting primary infection.
Epstein–Barr Virus
767
Clinical Presentations
EBV is associated with infectious mononucleosis,
EBV-induced tumours and EBV infection in an
immunocompromised host.
Infectious Mononucleosis
This
is
a
classical
clinical
syndrome
that
represents the immunopathogenic response of
the host to infection with EBV. Cytomegalovirus
(CMV)
is
most
commonly
associated
with
EBV-negative cases of infectious mononucleosis.
The condition is most often asymptomatic in chil-
dren younger than 4 years. In symptomatic cases
in adolescents and adults, the condition is
characterised by high fever, sore throat, headache,
myalgia, nausea and abdominal pain. The condi-
tion is associated with pharyngitis, generalised
lymphadenopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly
and
fatigue. The symptoms are usually present for
2–3 weeks. But fatigue, which is the major com-
plaint, continues to persist.
Epstein–Barr virus infection rarely causes
death in immunocompromised patients but may
cause neurological complications (meningoen-
cephalitis, Guillain–Barre syndrome, etc.), upper
airways obstruction or splenic rupture.
Epstein–Barr Virus-Induced Tumours
Endemic Burkitt lymphoma is associated with
EBV. It is a poorly differentiated monoclonal
B-cell lymphoma of the jaw. It is the most com-
mon tumour of childhood in Africa associated
with both EBV and falciparum malaria. Plasmo-
dium falciparum malaria causes stimulation and
proliferation of polyclonal B cells in the presence
of EBV infection. The malaria parasite also alters
the response of T lymphocytes to EBV, appar-
ently contributing to the pathogenesis of the
tumour.
Epstein–Barr virus infection is associated with
nasopharyngeal carcinoma endemic in Asia and
is common in males of Chinese origin. EBV DNA
EBNA
1
and
LMP
1
antigens
can
be
demonstrated in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cells. In addition, this virus has been linked to a
wide range of malignancies, such as post-
transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (TLDs),
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and gastric carcinoma.
Epstein–Barr Virus Infection
in an Immunocompromised Host
Lymphoproliferative diseases are observed in
patients with immunodeﬁciency diseases. The
EBV causes several syndromes and proliferation
disorders in these patients, including Duncan syn-
drome, ataxia-telangiectasia and Wiskott–Aldrich
syndrome.
Diagnosis
The laboratory diagnosis of EBV-induced infec-
tious mononucleosis is based on the three classic
criteria: (1) presence of lymphocytosis; (2) pres-
ence of at least 10% atypical lymphocytes in
peripheral blood smear and (3) presence of
heterophilic antibodies and antibodies to viral
antigens. These criteria are supplemented by
direct detection of viral antigens or EBV genomes
in clinical specimens.
Specimens
These include lymphoid tissues, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma tissue and saliva (for direct detection
of viral antigens or EBV genomes) and blood (for
serological tests) and peripheral blood (for blood
smear).
Direct Antigen Detection
A direct immunoﬂuorescent antibody test is used
to detect viral antigens in lymphoid nasopharyn-
geal carcinoma tissues.
Virus Isolation
EBV can be isolated from saliva, peripheral blood
or lymphoid tissue by transforming normal

human lymphocytes obtained from umbilical
blood. However, the procedure is tedious and
time consuming, hence seldom used. An attempt
has also been made to culture spontaneously
transformed B lymphocytes from EBV DNA or
virus-infected patients.
768
53
Herpesviruses
Serology
Epstein–Barr virus infection stimulates the pro-
duction of a wide range of antibodies, including
heterophilic
antibodies.
These
heterophilic
antibodies are IgM antibodies that recognise
Paul–Bunnell antigen on sheep, horses and
bovine RBCs. Therefore, serum from patients
with acute mononucleosis agglutinates sheep,
horse or bovine erythrocytes.
Heterophilic Antibody-Based Tests
Paul–Bunnell test was ﬁrst described by Paul
and
Bunnell
to
demonstrate
heterophile
antibodies in patients with infectious mononucle-
osis in 1932. This heterophile antibody, which is
an IgM antibody, is not directed against EBV or
EBV-infected cells but is produced due to poly-
clonal activation of B cells by EBV. Such
heterophilic antibodies are also found in serum
sickness during drug reaction and naturally occur-
ring antibodies to the Forssman antigen. These
antibodies are absent or present in a very low titre
in the serum of healthy individuals.
The human blood to be tested is ﬁrst absorbed
by the guinea pig kidney, and then it is tested for
agglutination activities directed against horse,
sheep or cow erythrocytes. A serum titre of
100 or greater is considered a positive test and is
suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. Differen-
tial absorption of agglutinin with guinea pig and
cow red cells is necessary to conﬁrm the diagno-
sis. Cow RBCs absorb infectious mononucleosis
heterophile
antibodies
from
serum
but
not
Forssman antibodies. Guinea pig kidney cells
absorb Forssman antibodies, but not the infec-
tious
mononucleosis
heterophile
antibodies.
Both guinea pig kidney cells and bovine RBCs
absorb the antibodies produced in serum sickness.
A serum titre of 1:100 after adsorption with
guinea pig cells is considered positive and is
suggestive of acute infectious mononucleosis.
These heterophile antibodies are usually present
for 3 months but may persist for even as long as
a year.
Monospot test is a rapid slide agglutination
test, which uses either horse RBCs or bovine
RBCs. Bovine RBCs are more speciﬁc for acute
infectious mononucleosis heterophile antibodies;
they
do
not
require
differential
absorption.
Monospot test shows a speciﬁcity of 63–80%. It
may show a rare false-positive reaction in patients
with lymphoma or hepatitis.
EBV-Specific Antibody Tests
Epstein–Barr virus infection is characterised by
the development of speciﬁc antibodies against
different EBV antigens (VCAs); EA and EBNA.
ELISA and Western blot are frequently used
methods
to
detect
antibodies
against
these
antigens.
1. Antibodies
against
VCAs:
IgM
VCA
antibodies appear early and circulate in the
serum for 30–45 days. Hence, demonstration
of IgM VCA antibodies in the serum indicates
current EBV infection. IgG VCA antibodies
appear
during
the
acute
phase.
These
antibodies reach a peak within 2–4 weeks but
decline and persist in the circulation through-
out
life.
Demonstration
of
IgG
VCA
antibodies, therefore, indicates past infection.
2. Antibodies against early antigens: Demon-
stration of anti-EA Ig in the serum indicates
current infection with B.Ths. is because anti-
EA antibodies appear early and disappear from
the serum after 3–6 months. Nevertheless, a

The presence of atypical lymphocytes is the char-
acteristic feature of infection with EBV. These
atypical lymphocytes of Downy type III are larger
and have a less dense mucus than normal

Reactivation
lymphocytes. Lymphocytosis (more than 50%
lymphocytes) is seen in approximately 80–90%
of patients. Lymphocytosis is well marked during
the second or third week of illness and persists for
2–6 weeks.

Molecular Detection
DNA probes for Epstein–Barr EAs have been
used to detect and identify the EBV mRNA in
the nuclei of EBV-infected lymphoid cells. PCR
has been developed to detect EBV DNA in
plasma during acute infectious mononucleosis.
These EBV DNA levels decline during convales-
cence. They are not demonstrated in latently
infected individuals.
Treatment
No speciﬁc treatment is available against acute
infectious mononucleosis. Acyclovir has little
activity against EBV. Treatment of the condition
is mainly symptomatic.
Epidemiology
Epstein–Barr virus infection occurs worldwide.
EBV was ﬁrst discovered in cells isolated from
African Burkitt’s lymphoma. Reinfection is of
relatively low transmissibility and does not
occur as epidemics. Epidemiological studies sug-
gest its prevalence in more than 90% of the
world’s population. EBV infection is exclusively
human disease. Humans are the only known
reservoirs of the virus. It is present in oropharyn-
geal secretion, saliva, peripheral blood or lym-
phoid tissue of the infected human host. Saliva
is the main source of infection.
Malaria has been suggested as an important
co-factor in the progression of chronic or latent
EBV infection to acute Burkitt lymphoma in
Africa. The genetic predisposition of the people
in China or the presence of co-factors in the food
or environment is believed to be important in
facilitating the incidence of nasopharyngeal car-
cinoma in people living in certain parts of China.
Immunocompromised people, such as patients
with AIDS, transplant recipients and genetically
immunodeﬁcient people, are at high risk for
lymphoproliferation disorders caused by EBV.
Prevention and Control
Prevention and control of infection are difﬁcult
due to the widespread prevalence of the virus and
intermittent shedding by the infected individuals
throughout their lives. No vaccine is available
against EBV infection.
Cytomegalovirus
CMV or human herpesvirus 5 (HSV-5) is the
causative agent of mononucleosis syndrome in
symptomatic
infection
in
immunocompetent
hosts. The name is originated from the word
cytomegalo (large cell virus) and is derived from
the swollen cells containing large multinuclear

inclusions
that
characterise
these
infections.
CMV is a member of the Betaherpesvirinae in
the subfamily Herpesviridae. The virus shares
similar common features in the structure, genome
and potency to cause latent and persistent
infections, like those of other herpesviruses.
770
53
Herpesviruses
Morphology
CMV
is
the
largest
herpesvirus
measuring
150–200 nm in size. It has the largest genome of
all herpesviruses, ranging from 230 to 240 kbp. It
is a double-stranded linear DNA virus. It contains
hexagonal protein capsomeres surrounded by a
lipid membrane. It is the only betaherpesvirus
with the only class E genome, similar to that
present in HSV.
Antigenic Properties
Human CMV has a single serotype. It does not
show any antigenic cross-reaction with CMV or
other mammalian species. It shows only minor
antigenic cross-reaction with simian CMV.
Laboratory Isolation
The virus grows only in diploid human ﬁbroblast
cell culture but not in epithelial cell culture. The
virus grows very slowly in these cell lines, taking
4–6 weeks to produce characteristic CPEs. The
CPE includes foci of swollen refractile cells with
cytoplasmic granules. These cells show multinu-
cleated
giant
cells
containing
acidophilic
inclusions in the nuclei and cytoplasm in a stained
smear.
Pathogenesis of CMV Infection
CMV infection is acquired by contacting blood,
tissue and most body secretions containing
viruses. On entering the human, the virus primar-
ily affects epithelial cells and causes infection of
those
cells.
Subsequently,
the
infection
progresses to establish persistent and latent infec-
tion in T cells, macrophages and in different
organs. Activation and multiplication of the
virus in salivary glands, other secretory glands,
kidneys and heart lead to their secretion in saliva,
urine, milk, etc.
The replicative cycle of CMV in the infected
cells is similar to that of other herpesviruses,
except that some of the immediate early proteins
of
the
CMV
are
translated
from
mRNAs
incorporated into the infected cells by the parental
virion but are not translated from the mRNAs
synthesised in the newly infected cells. In the
infected cells, CMV infection produces character-
istically enlarged cells with viral inclusion bodies.
This change, commonly referred to as owl’s eye,
is diagnostic of the infections. However, these
histological ﬁndings may be minimal or absent
in infected organs.
Cell-mediated immunity is more important
and essential for the resolution of infection and
controlling the progression of CMV infection.
The production of cytotoxic T cells against
CMV is crucial to control the infection-speciﬁc
CD4, and CD8 lymphocytes play an important
role in protecting after primary infection or reac-
tivation of latent disease. Studies have shown that
patients who do not develop CMV-speciﬁc CD4
or CD8 cells are at higher risk for developing
CMV pneumonitis. Suppression of CMI, which
is caused by therapy with corticosteroid or infec-
tion with HIV, induces reactivation of the latent
viral infection. Recent studies have also shown
that many viral gene products appear to modulate
host inﬂammatory response and are responsible
for symptoms of the disease. The antibodies have
some role in controlling the severe disease but do
not prevent transplacental infection, which can
occur even in pregnant mothers who are CMV
seropositive.
Clinical Syndromes
CMV causes infections of different types as
follows:

Cytomegalovirus
771
Congenital Infection
CMV is the most common viral cause of congen-
ital infection.
Asymptomatic Congenital Infection
It occurs in infants born to women who have pre-
existing immunity to CMV. These infants appear
normal at birth but are at risk of developing
growth retardation and other neurodevelopmental
abnormalities during the later stage of life.
Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease of Newborns
The cytomegalic inclusion disease occurs in
infants born to women who acquire primary
CMV infection during pregnancy. The disease is
characterised by microcephaly, intracerebral cal-
ciﬁcation, hepatosplenomegaly and rash and may
be fatal. Mental retardation and unilateral or bilat-
eral hearing loss are seen in adults surviving from
the disease.
Acquired CMV Infection
Acquired CMV infection occurs postnatally:
Perinatal Infection
Infection of newborns occurs following exposure
to infected genital secretions in the birth canal or
milk
during
breastfeeding.
Most
perinatal
infections are asymptomatic. Some infants may
manifest lymphadenopathy, hepatitis and pneu-
monitis. However, these patients do not show
any
neurological
or
neurodevelopmental
complications.
CMV Mononucleosis
It is a disease of young adults acquired by
person-to-person transmission. This condition is
transmitted by blood transfusion or organ trans-
plantation. Fever and severe malaise are typical
symptoms. Clinically, it is difﬁcult to distinguish
CMV
mononucleosis
from
EBV-induced
mononucleosis.
Transfusion-Acquired CMV Infection
This condition occurs following transfusion of
infected blood after an incubation period of
20–60
days.
This
condition
is
mostly
asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, clinical
manifestations of transfusion-acquired CMV are
similar to CMV mononucleosis.
CMV Infection in Immunocompromised
Hosts
CMV is the most important opportunistic agent in
immunocompromised hosts, in whom it causes a
variety of clinical syndromes. The virus causes
latent infection; hence, reactivation may result in
disease in immunocompromised patients. These
patients include those with HIV and those receiv-
ing organ and bone marrow transplantation. It
causes pneumonia and life-threatening intestinal
pneumonitis. It causes graft atherosclerosis fol-
lowing heart transplantation, bronchitis in lung
transplants,
virus-related
rejections
of
kidneys, etc.
Infection of Adults
CMV mononucleosis is a disease in immunocom-
petent hosts. The infection is transmitted by blood
transfusion or organ transplantation. Fever and
severe malaise are typical symptoms. Clinically,
it is difﬁcult to distinguish CMV mononucleosis
from
EBV-induced
mononucleosis.
Transfusion-acquired CMV infection occurs fol-
lowing transfusion of infected blood after an incu-
bation period of 20–60 days.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Saliva, urine, throat washing, blood, CSF, cervi-
cal secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid and
tissue bits are the specimens that can be used for
the culture.
Microscopy
Demonstration of typical owl’s eye-like baso-
philic intranuclear inclusion body is characteristic
of
CMV.
These
are
demonstrated
in
the
centrifuged deposit of saliva or urine and in
infected tissues on staining with haematoxylin–
eosin or Papanicolaou staining.

772
53
Herpesviruses
Direct Antigen Detection
A direct immunoﬂuorescence test using speciﬁc
ﬂuorescein-labelled monoclonal antibodies has
been used. This test is used to detect CMV pp65
and pp67 proteins of the virus directly in the
clinical specimens, such as blood leukocytes.
These proteins are expressed only during the rep-
lication of the virus in the tissues.
Direct immunoﬂuorescence test is very useful
for detecting sub-clinical disease in immunocom-
promised patients at high risk. These are also
useful to start speciﬁc antibiotic therapy in
transplantation.
Cell Culture
It is the deﬁnitive method for establishing the
diagnosis of CMV infection. However, cell cul-
ture is highly sensitive but takes a longer time of
4–6 weeks to identify the virus.
To avoid that, a shell vial assay is carried out
to detect viruses rapidly. This is an adaptation of
tissue culture, which provides results more rap-
idly. In this method, the clinical specimen is
added to a vial containing a monolayer of the
cell line. The shell vial is centrifuged at a low
speed and incubated for 24–48 h. The tissue cul-
ture medium is removed, and the cells are stained
using ﬂuorescent-labelled anti-CMV antibodies
and examined by a ﬂuorescent microscope. The
positive shell vial assay is the presumptive evi-
dence of active CMV infection and has been
found to be as sensitive as traditional tissue
culture.
Serology
ELISA is a frequently used test to detect anti-
CMV IgM antibodies. Detection of serum anti-
CMV IgM antibodies indicates current infection
and congenital infection. Detection of anti-CMV
IgG antibodies indicates past infection. The serol-
ogy is useful for primary CMV infection but not
reliable
for
diagnosing
congenital
CMV
infection.
Molecular Detection
PCR is currently used as a routine diagnostic test
to detect CMV DNA in tissue, spinal ﬂuid and
amniotic ﬂuid. The test is highly sensitive and
becomes positive even before the viraemia in
those receiving organ transplants.
Treatment
Ganciclovir is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits
DNA synthesis. It is the drug of choice for the
treatment of CMV. It is a ganciclovir treatment
useful for gastrointestinal disease in patients who
have received organ transplants and those who
are HIV positive. Ganciclovir has also been used
as a prophylactic treatment of CMV disease in
patients who have received transplants. In addi-
tion, scarlet is another drug that has been used to
treat the infection that is resistant to ganciclovir.
Epidemiology
CMV infection is worldwide.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are the natural hosts. An infected human
is the only reservoir of CMV infection. CMVs are
found in the urine, blood, saliva, tears, throat
swab, stool, semen, milk, amniotic ﬂuid, cervical
and vaginal secretions and tissue obtained for
transplantation.
Saliva, tears, urine and breast milk are the
common sources of infection for a baby or child.
Cervical secretions are the source of transmission
of infection to neonates. Blood, organ graft and
semen are the other sources of infection in the
adult population.
CMV causes latent infection; hence, reactiva-
tion may result in disease in immunocompro-
mised patients. These patients include those with
HIV and those receiving organ and bone marrow
transplantation. Immunodeﬁciency caused by
antineoplastic compounds and ionising radiation
may also cause reactivation of CMV infection.

Human Herpesvirus 8
773
Prevention and Control
No vaccine is available for scarlet transmission of
CMV can be prevented by following safe sexual
practices. Transmission of the virus is also
reduced by regular screening of blood and organ
donors for CMV seronegative. Prophylaxis with
ganciclovir prevents reactivation of latent CMV
infection in immunocompromised patients.
Human Herpesvirus 6
Human herpesvirus 6 (HSV-6) was ﬁrst isolated
from the peripheral blood of patients with
lymphoproliferative disease in 1986. HSV-6 is a
lymphotropic virus and is ubiquitous. The virus
replicates well in B cells, CD$ T lymphocytes,
megakaryocytes and ﬁbroblasts. The virus is
spread by saliva, the main source of infection.
HSV-6 has two variants: A and B. Variant 6B
causes roseola infantum, also known as the sixth
disease. This is a febrile infection associated with
a rash that affects young children.
Like other herpesviruses, HSV-6 causes a
latent infection in T cells and monocytes. The
replication of the virus in CD4+ T lymphocytes
is controlled by CMI. The reactivation of the
virus occurs in immunocompromised patients
(patients with AIDS or other immunosuppression
disorders). HSV-6 causes roseola infantum, a
febrile infection that affects young children. The
virus may also cause mononucleosis syndrome
and lymphadenopathy.
Human Herpesvirus 7
Human herpesvirus 7 (HSV-7) was ﬁrst isolated
from peripheral CD4 cells of healthy persons in
1990. It is a lymphotropic virus. HSV-7, like
HSV-6, has also been isolated from the saliva of
healthy adults. It has been implicated as one of the
causative agents of rubeola infantum and febrile
seizures in children. The virus has also been
associated with acute hemiplegia of childhood,
hepatitis and respiratory tract infections.
Human Herpesvirus 8
DNA sequences of human herpesvirus 8 (HSV-8)
were ﬁrst identiﬁed in tissues from Kaposi sar-
coma in patients with AIDS in 1994. This virus,
also known as KS-associated herpesvirus, is a
lymphotropic virus. It is believed to be important
in causing and/or maintaining lesions in Kaposi
sarcoma. The lesion in Kaposi sarcoma begins as
a red-purple or dusky area that enlarges into a
plaque and progresses subsequently into a tumor-
ous growth. HSV-8 also causes lymphoma,
Castleman disease and vascular tumours.
HSV-8 is secreted in saliva. It is sexually
transmitted,
most
commonly
among
homosexuals. The virus is also transmitted
through organ transplants. PCR is used to detect
viral DNA in saliva and other specimens. Ganci-
clovir
and
foscarnet
show
some
activity
against EBV.
Case Study
A 21-year-old college student attended medicine
OPD with a history of sore throat, low-grade fever
for several days, followed by swollen cervical
lymph nodes and increasing fatigue. Blood ﬁlm
examination revealed lymphocytosis with atypi-
cal cells. The serum for heterophile antibodies
was positive by Paul–Bunnell test.

Adenoviruses
54
Adenoviruses belong to the family Adenoviridae,
consisting
of
a
group
of
medium-sized,
non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
viruses that share a common complement-ﬁxing
antigen and multiply in the nucleus of the infected
cell.
The
family
consists
of
two
distinct
genera:
Mastadenovirus
and
Aviadenovirus,
consisting of mammalian and avian adenoviruses,
respectively.
Adenoviruses
The genus Mastadenovirus comprises at least
49 serotypes that infect humans. These human
serotypes have been divided into six groups
(A–F) based on their DNA homology and other
physical, chemical and biological properties
(Table 54.1).
Morphology
Adenoviruses
are
double
stranded
DNA
(dsDNA),
non-enveloped
viruses
measuring
80–110 nm in diameter (Fig. 54.1). Adenoviruses
have a characteristic morphology. They are the
only viruses having a ﬁbre protruding from each
of the 12 vertices of the capsid. The capsid is
composed of 252 capsomeres which consist of
hexons and pentons. An apical ﬁbre, 9–31 nm in
length and 62 kDa in molecular mass projects
from each penton. This apical ﬁbre helps to bind
speciﬁcally adenoviruses to receptor sites on the
host cells. The ﬁbre contains the viral attachment
proteins and can act as a haemagglutinin. The
penton base and ﬁbre are toxic to cells. The
type-speciﬁc antigens are present in the pentons
and also in the ﬁbres.

775
Antigenic Properties
The viral group-speciﬁc antigen is present on the
inner surface of the hexon capsomere. These
group antigens can be detected by immunoﬂuo-
rescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). The type-speciﬁc antigen is located in
the other region of the hexon and the ﬁbre. The
ﬁbre protein is the main type-speciﬁc antigen.
Fibre determinant (gamma) is a type-speciﬁc
haemagglutinin. Serotypes are identiﬁed by a
neutralisation test.
Human
adenoviruses
are
classiﬁed
into
six groups (A–F), also called subgroups or
subgenera, based on the properties, such as
DNA fragment analysis, ﬁbre length haemagglu-
tination
and
oncogenic
potential.
These
subgroups are further classiﬁed into 49 different
serotypes based on the differences in their penton
bases and ﬁbre proteins which determine the
nature of tissue tropism and disease.

Other Properties
Adenoviruses are relatively stable and remain
viable for about a week at 37 C but are readily
inactivated at 50 C. They are resistant to ether
and bile salts. They resist drying, detergents, gas-
trointestinal tract secretions including acid, prote-
ase and bile and even mild chlorine treatment.
Fig. 54.1 Morphology of adenovirus. (http://link.
springer.com/article/10.1007/s004280100534)
Laboratory Isolation
Human adenoviruses are highly host-speciﬁc;
hence laboratory animals are not susceptible to
infection by the virus.
Human adenoviruses can be grown only in
tissue cultures of human origin. They grow well
on a monolayer of HeLa, Hep-2, KB and human
embryonic kidney cells. Cytopathic changes are
observed after 1–4 weeks of inoculation and con-
sist of cell rounding and aggregation into grape-
like
clusters.
Infected
cells
swell,
become
ballooned and show intranuclear inclusions in
stained preparations.
Primary human embryonic kidney cells sup-
port the growth of many fastidious adenoviruses.
The viral antigens in the cell culture can be
detected by a direct immunoﬂuorescent test
using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies.
Pathogenesis of Adenovirus Infection
Adenoviruses are transmitted mainly by respira-
tory or faeco–oral contact between humans. The
infection is acquired by (i) aerosol droplets,
(ii) faeco–oral route, (iii) direct inoculation of
conjunctiva
by
contaminated
ﬁngers,
(iv) contaminated fomites including towels and
medical instruments and (v) swimming in an
improperly disinfected swimming pool.

Adenoviruses
777
They infect the conjunctiva or the nasal
mucosa. They may multiply in the conjunctiva,
pharynx or small intestine and then spread to
pre-auricular, cervical and mesenteric lymph
nodes, where epithelial cells are infected.
Adenoviruses attach to the surface of the cells
by their ﬁbres, then penetrate the cell and, once
inside the cell, uncoat the viral DNA. The viral
DNA is then transported into the cell’s nucleus
and initiates the replication cycle. Host cell
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes
the early genes leading to the formation of func-
tional mRNA. Then in the cytoplasm, the early
mRNA is translated into non-structural proteins.
After viral DNA replication, late mRNA is tran-
scribed and then translated into structural virion
proteins in the nucleus. This is followed by
assembly of virions in the nucleus and release of
virions by lysis of the cells, but not by budding.
Adenoviruses may cause three different types
of interaction with the infected cells. These are
lytic infection, latent infection and transforming
infection.
Lytic Infection
Adenoviruses infect mucoepithelial cells in the
respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and con-
junctiva or cornea, causing damage to these cells
directly. After local replication of the virus,
viraemia follows with subsequent spread to vis-
ceral organs. Dissemination occurs more com-
monly in immunocompromised patients than in
immunocompetent individuals.
Latent Infection
The adenovirus has a unique ability to become
latent in lymphoid and other tissues, such as
adenoids, tonsils and Peyer patches. The exact
mechanism of latency of adenoviruses in these
tissues is not known. These latent infections can
be re-activated in patients infected with other
agents or in immunocompromised patients.
Oncogenic Transformation
Some adenoviruses belonging to groups A and B
have the property for oncogenic transformation in
rodent cells. However, the oncogenesis of human
cells has not been demonstrated.
Adenovirus
infection
is
characterised
by
developing effective and long-lasting immunity
against re-infection. Both cell-mediated immu-
nity (CMI) and humoral immunity are important.
CMI plays an important role in limiting the
proliferation and outgrowth of adenoviruses.
Therefore, a different disease is seen in persons
whose CMI is immunocompromised. Serum
antibodies play an important role in resolving
adenovirus
infection.
Resistance
to
clinical
disease is believed to be directly related to the
presence of circulating neutralising antibodies.
The
antibodies
protect
the
person
from
re-infection with the same serotype but no other
serotypes.
Moreover,
adenovirus
infection
confers lasting immunity to re-infection with the
same serotype.
Clinical Syndromes
Tissue tropism of the speciﬁc groups or serotypes
of adenovirus strain determines the type of dis-
ease caused by adenoviruses in humans. Certain
serotypes of adenovirus are associated with spe-
ciﬁc
syndromes.
Respiratory
infections
are
caused by low-numbered serotypes (1, 2, 3, 5
and 7) and gastrointestinal infections by high-
numbered serotypes (40, 41, 42). Adenoviruses
primarily infect children. Adults are also infected.
The incubation period varies from 5 to 8 days.
Respiratory Infections
Acute Respiratory Disease
It is caused by adenovirus serotypes 4 and
7. Fever, rhinorrhoea, cough and sore throat are
the typical symptoms that last for 3–5 days. This
syndrome most often affects military recruits liv-
ing in crowded conditions.
Pharyngoconjunctival Fever
The condition occurs primarily in school-going
children. Fever, sore throat, coryza and red eye
are the classic presentations of the condition.
These symptoms may precede ocular ﬁndings,
or they may not be present. Acute conjunctivitis
may occur as a separate entity with or without

pharyngitis.
The
condition
is
usually
self-
limiting. This condition is caused predominantly
by serotypes 3, 4 and 7.
778
54
Adenoviruses
Other Respiratory Tract Diseases
These include bronchiolitis, croup, laryngitis
and
cold-like
symptoms
are
caused
by
adenoviruses.
Eye Infections
Acute Follicular Conjunctivitis
The condition manifests as a non-suppurative
eruption of the conjunctiva with enlargement of
the sub-mucous lymphoid follicles, and swollen
pre-auricular lymph nodes are features. Com-
monly associated serotypes are 3, 4 and 11. Chla-
mydial conjunctivitis is clinically similar to
adenoviral conjunctivitis.
Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis
It is a highly contagious condition and has
an
insidious
onset
of
unilateral
red
eye.
Subsequently, both eyes are involved. Patients
complain of photophobia, tearing and pain.
Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present in
some children. Inﬂammation of the conjunctiva
may persist for a week, accompanied by residual
scarring and visual impairment. The condition
may occur as an epidemic, usually caused
by serotype 8 and less often by serotypes
19 and 37.

Gastrointestinal Infections
Gastroenteritis and diarrhoea are most commonly
associated with serotypes 40 and 41, but other
serotypes may also be involved. The enteric ade-
novirus infection is a common cause of infantile
diarrhoea in daycare centres. The condition
manifests as fever and watery diarrhoea, which
resolves within 1–2 weeks.
Other Manifestations
Adenoviruses have also been associated with
acute haemorrhagic cystitis caused by serotypes
11 and 21, intussusception in young children,
pertussis-like illness, musculoskeletal disorders
and genital and skin infections.
Adenovirus Infections
in an Immunocompromised Host
Multiple serotypes of adenoviruses cause these
infections. These serotypes cause disease during
the post-transplant period in the patients who
have received a haematopoietic stem-cell trans-
plant. Patients receiving stem-cell transplantation
and T-cell deletion, and lymphopenia are at risk
of serious adenovirus infections. Infections in
these patients may cause variable manifestations
but include haemorrhagic cystitis, pneumonia,
nephritis and gastroenteritis. Infection occurs
either by re-activating old infection or by exoge-
nous transmission from other infected hosts.
Adenovirus serotypes associated with various
human illnesses are summarised in Table 54.2.

Adenoviruses
779
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Specimens used to depend on the nature of the
clinical illness caused by adenoviruses. These
include throat swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate,
bronchial lavage, conjunctival swab, corneal
scraping, urine and faeces.
Microscopy
Certain serotypes of enteric adenoviruses may be
seen directly in stool specimens by electron
microscope. These serotypes (40, 41 and 42) are
difﬁcult to grow in cell cultures, and hence are
referred to as non-cultivable adenoviruses.
Direct Antigen Detection
ELISA or direct ﬂuorescent antibody test using
speciﬁc antibodies raised against adenoviruses is
used to detect viral antigens in faeces and naso-
pharyngeal secretions.
Virus Isolation
Isolation of the virus by cell culture establishes
the speciﬁc diagnosis of the condition. Viruses
from clinical specimens may be isolated on pri-
mary human embryonic kidney cells, HeLa,
Hep-2 and KB cells. Within 2–20 days, the
viruses produce a lytic infection with characteris-
tic inclusion bodies. Infected cells show rounding
and
grape-like
clusters
with
intranuclear
inclusions.
The viral isolates are usually classiﬁed into
subgroups by haemagglutination with rat and
monkey erythrocytes. Further serotyping is car-
ried out by a neutralisation test.
Serology
Serology is rarely used for the diagnosis of cases.
It is usually used for epidemiological studies.
They are also used to conﬁrm the causative role
of
a
faecal
or respiratory
tract
isolate
by
identifying its serotype.
Molecular Detection
DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
are used to identify enteric adenovirus serotypes
40, 41 and 42 directly in stool specimens that do
not grow in cell cultures. These methods also
detect, type and group adenovirus isolates in tis-
sue culture and stool specimens.
Treatment
At present, no speciﬁc antiviral agents are avail-
able to treat adenovirus infections. Ribavirin has
been used with variable success in treating ade-
novirus infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
Adenovirus has shown the capacity to carry
DNA inserts of up to 8 kb but is yet to be proven
as a potential vector in gene therapy.
Epidemiology
Adenovirus infections are found worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
More than one serotype of the virus may produce
the same clinical syndrome, and one serotype of
the virus may cause clinically different diseases.
Adenoviruses 1–7 are the common serotypes
worldwide and are responsible for most cases of
adenovirus-associated infections.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Adenovirus infections are exclusively human
infections. No animal reservoirs are present.
Infected symptomatic, as well as asymptomatic
humans who excrete adenoviruses intermittently
in their respiratory secretions and also in their
stool, are the sources of infection. Overcrowding,
poor hygiene and close contact facilitate the trans-
mission of infection. Adenovirus typically affects
children, from infants to school-going ones,
though children of any age may be affected.
Prevention and Control
Three
live,
non-attenuated
vaccines
against
serotypes 4, 7 and 21 are available as oral
vaccines. All three vaccines are monovalent, and
each vaccine contains only one serotype. These

vaccines are given orally in a gelatin-coated cap-
sule, protecting the live virus from inactivation by
stomach acidity. The virus is released in the intes-
tine, where it replicates and induces neutralising
antibodies. The vaccine strain does not spread
from person-to-person contacts. The vaccine is
yet to be available widely.

Adenoviruses
Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVS)
AAVs are small, icosahedral viral particles mea-
suring 20–25 nm in diameter. They are so called
because they can multiply only in cells simulta-
neously infected with adenovirus but cannot mul-
tiply independently because they lack enough
DNA. These viruses have been classiﬁed in the
genus Dependovirus. Four serotypes (1–4) have
been recognised, of which types 1, 2 and 3 are of
human origin, and type 4 is of simian origin. The
pathogenic role of the human serotypes of AAVs
is not clear.

Picornaviruses
55
The family Picornaviridae is one of the largest
families of viruses and includes a large number of
very small (pico: measuring small; rna: RNA
virus) RNA viruses. They are non-enveloped
viruses measuring 27–30 nm in size. The capsid
is a naked icosahedral made up of 60 protein
subunits. The genome consists of a single linear
molecule of single-stranded RNA. The genome
RNA is unusual because it has a protein at the 50
end that serves as a primer for transcription by
RNA polymerase.
Classification
The family Picornaviridae consists of more than
230 members and is divided into ﬁve genera:
Enterovirus,
Rhinovirus,
Hepatovirus,
Arthrovirus and Cardiovirus. The ﬁrst three
genera
(Enterovirus,
Rhinovirus
and
Hepatovirus) are the important viruses that
cause disease in humans. Two other genera
(Arthrovirus and Cardiovirus) are of veterinary
importance and cause foot-and-mouth disease in
cattle and meningoencephalomyelitis in mice.
The picornaviruses causing human infections are
summarised in Table 55.1. The important features
of picornaviruses are summarised in Table 55.2.

Enteroviruses
Human enteroviruses consist of at least 72
serotypes, which include poliovirus types 1–3,
coxsackie viruses A types 1–24, coxsackie
viruses B types 1–6 echoviruses types 1–34 and
enteroviruses 68–71. Originally hepatitis A virus
(enterovirus 72) was included in this group but
has been reclassiﬁed as a hepatovirus in the genus
Hepatovirus (Chap. 66). Most enteroviruses are
host-speciﬁc; they infect only one or a few related
species.
Poliovirus
Poliomyelitis is an enteric infection caused by
polioviruses transmitted by the faecal–oral route.
Morphology
Poliovirus was the ﬁrst animal virus to be puriﬁed
and obtained a crystalline form. The viruses are
spherical particles about 27 nm in diameter
(Fig. 55.1). The virion comprises 60 subunits,
each consisting of four viral proteins (VP1–
VP4). The viral protein VP1 contains the major
antigenic site for combination with type-speciﬁc
neutralising antibodies. The viral genome is a
single-stranded positive-sense RNA, which can
be directly translated by host ribosomes to form

Virus Replication
Polioviruses are cytolytic; they replicate in the
cytoplasm of the host cell. The virion causes infec-
tion ﬁrst by binding to the speciﬁc receptor on the
cell membrane and entering the cell. Once inside
the cell, the virion uncoats by removing the capsid
and releasing the RNA genome. The RNA serves
as the mRNA and is translated into a very large
polypeptide known as a non-capsid viral protein.
Subsequently, the viral protein is utilised by the
viral enzyme protease to form capsid proteins of
the
progeny
virions
and
several
non-capsid
proteins, including the RNA polymerase.
RNA polymerase initiates the synthesis of
progeny RNA genomes. This is followed by the
assembly of the progeny virions by coating the
genome RNA with capsid proteins in the cell
cytoplasm. The release of progeny virions occurs
by the lysis and death of the cells but not by
budding from the cell membrane.
Antigenic Properties
Based on the neutralisation test, the polioviruses
have been classiﬁed into three serotypes (types
1, 2 and 3). The prototype strains for type 1
poliovirus are Brunhilde and Mahoney strains,
for type 2 poliovirus are Lansing and MEFI
strains and for type 3 poliovirus are Leon and
Saukett strains.
Type 1 is the most common poliovirus and
causes most poliomyelitis epidemics; type 2 strain
is usually associated with endemic infections,
whereas
type
3
strains
occasionally
cause
epidemics. Two antigens, C (coreless or capsid)
and D (dense), are recognised by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay or precipitation test. The C
antigen, also known as heated or H antigen, is
associated with the empty, non-infectious virus. It
is less speciﬁc and reacts with heterotypic sera.
The D antigen, also known as the nature or N
antigen, is associated with the whole virion. It is
more speciﬁc and is type-speciﬁc. Antibodies
against D antigen are protective; hence the
potency of injectable polio vaccine is measured
in terms of the D antigen unit.
Other Properties
Poliovirus is sensitive to heat and is readily
inactivated at 55 C for 30 min. It is also sensitive
to formaldehyde and oxidising disinfectants. The
viruses are readily destroyed by chlorination in
water, but the presence of organic matter delays
inactivation.
Polioviruses are resistant to lipid-soluble agents
(ether, chloroform and bile), the intestine’s proteo-
lytic enzymes and detergents. They survive in
faeces for months at 4 C and years at 20 C.
They survive for days to several weeks in faeces at
room temperature depending on the environmental
conditions, such as temperature, moisture, acidity,
etc. Polioviruses are killed by lyophilisation.
Laboratory Isolation
Chick Embryos
Laboratory-maintained strains may grow in chick
embryos, but fresh poliovirus isolates cannot grow.

784
55
Picornaviruses
Tissue Culture
Polioviruses grow readily in cell lines of primate
origin. They can be cultured on monkey kidney
cell lines, human amnion, HeLa, Hep-2, MRC-5
and other cell lines. The cytopathic effects that
consist of cell retraction, increased refractivity,
cytoplasmic granularity and nuclear pyknosis
and are observed within 48 h of inoculation.
Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies may
be demonstrated in stained preparation of the
infected cell lines. Well-formed plaques develop
in infected monolayers with agar overlay.
Laboratory Animals
Polioviruses show high host speciﬁcity restricted
to primates, including humans and non-human
primates, such as monkeys and apes. This is due
to the presence of a speciﬁc receptor that is pres-
ent
only
on
the
primate
cell
membrane.
Cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys are commonly
used
animals.
They
can
be
experimentally
infected by intracerebral or intraspinal inocula-
tion. Cynomolgus monkeys and chimpanzees
can also be infected orally.
Pathogenesis of Poliomyelitis
Poliovirus is transmitted primarily by the faecal–
oral route by ingestion of food and water
contaminated with human faeces. It is also trans-
mitted
by
inhalation
or
through
fomites
contaminated with respiratory secretions. The
viral particles initially multiply in the nasophar-
ynx and the gastrointestinal mucosa. The virions
are resistant to the stomach’s acidity and lytic
activities of the protease and other enzymes of
the intestinal tract and bile.
On entering the body, the virus infects and
multiplies in the tonsils and Peyer patch of the
ileum. It then spreads to regional lymph nodes
and enters the blood, causing a primary viremia.
On continued infection and multiplication of
virus in the reticuloendothelial cells, it invades
the bloodstream again and causes secondary vire-
mia. During this period of viremia, the poliovirus
crosses the blood–brain barrier or gains access to
the brain by infecting skeletal muscle and
travelling upon the nerves to the brain as in the
rabies virus.
Poliovirus shows tissue tropism by speciﬁcally
combining with neural cells. It recognises a
receptor present on the anterior horn cells of
(1) the spinal cord, (2) dorsal root ganglia and
(3) motor neurons. The poliovirus destroys the
motor neurons, anterior horn and brain stem by
combining at these sites. The destruction of motor
neurons
leads
to
paralysis
of
the
muscles
innervated by those neurons. Paralysis is not
caused by the virus infecting the muscles. The
poliovirus also infects the brain stem, causing
bulbar poliomyelitis associated with respiratory
paralysis.
Poliovirus causing the pathological changes in
the central nervous system (CNS) is usually
responsible for causing symptoms of poliomyeli-
tis. Immune mechanisms do not play any role in
the pathogenesis of the disease.
Host immunity in poliomyelitis is mostly
dependent on humoral antibodies. Both the
serum and secretory antibodies play an important
role
in
conferring
protection
against
poliomyelitis.
Serum IgM antibodies appear within a week
of infection and persist for nearly 6 months. IgG
antibodies, which develop subsequently, persist
lifelong. The neutralising antibodies in the blood
protect against disease by the same serotype of
poliovirus. These antibodies, however, do not
prevent infection of the intestinal neuron and
excretion of virus in the faeces.
Secretory IgA antibodies provide mucosal
immunity against the virus (1) by preventing
intestinal infections and (2) by preventing the
shedding of the virus. The IgA antibody in breast
milk protects infants from infection. Therefore,
poliomyelitis tends to be more severe, and the
shedding of the virus is more prolonged in the
infected human host with an altered humoral
immune response.
Host immunity is type-speciﬁc. However,
there is a signiﬁcant amount of cross-protection
between types 1 and 2 and types 2 and
3 polioviruses. There is little or no cross-
protection between types 1 and 3 strains.

Cell-mediated immunity plays a little or very
insigniﬁcant
role
in

Clinical Syndromes
Poliovirus causes a wide spectrum of illnesses in
unvaccinated people. The incubation period is
usually 10 days but may vary from 4 days to
4 weeks.
Asymptomatic Illness
Most patients (90–95%) infected with poliovirus
develop inapparent infection and are asymptom-
atic. This asymptomatic illness is caused by a
viral infection conﬁned to the oropharynx and
the intestine.
Abortive Poliomyelitis
Abortive poliomyelitis is a minor illness occur-
ring in a smaller number of people. This is a
febrile illness characterised by fever, headache,
sore throat, loss of appetite, vomiting and abdom-
inal pain. Neurological symptoms are typically
absent. The duration of this illness is usually
less than 5 days.
Non-paralytic Poliomyelitis
Non-paralytic poliomyelitis, also known as asep-
tic meningitis, is caused by the invasion of the
virus
into
the
CNS.
The
symptoms
of
non-paralytic poliomyelitis are similar to those
of abortive poliomyelitis but are more intense.
Stiffness of the posterior muscles of the neck,
trunk and limbs is present in addition to the
symptoms of the minor illness. This condition
occurs in 1–2% of infected patients.
Paralytic Polio
This is the major illness, which occurs in 0.1–2%
of individuals infected with poliovirus. This is the
most severe manifestation of poliomyelitis and
appears 3–4 days after abortive poliomyelitis has
subsided. This condition is caused due to invasion
of the virus from blood to the anterior horn cells
of the spinal cord and the motor cortex of the
brain. Depending on the various tissues or organs
affected and the intensity of neuronal infection,
Paralytic polio may be of two types, as follows:
Paralytic poliomyelitis or spinal paralysis is
characterised by spinal paralysis involving one or
more limbs. Asymmetrical ﬂaccid paralysis with
no sensory loss is the typical manifestation. This
condition is caused mostly by poliovirus type
1. This condition is seen in some of the
vaccinated individuals following vaccination.
This occurs due to the reversion of the attenuated
vaccine virus types 2 and 3 to virulence types. In
this condition, there may be paralysis of only one
limb, such as one leg, or there may be complete
ﬂaccid paralysis of both the legs and hands. The
condition may progress to death or may recover
completely with residual paralysis.
Bulbar
poliomyelitis
is
caused
due
to
involvement of the cranial nerves, most com-
monly 9th, 10th and 12th. This condition tends
to be more severe with involvement of the phar-
ynx muscles, vocal cords and respiration. The
condition may cause death in the majority of the
patients.
Post-poliomyelitis Syndrome
This condition is sequelae of poliomyelitis, which
may develop 20–40 years after infection with the
poliovirus. This condition is seen in 20–80% of
patients who have recovered from poliomyelitis.
Recurrence of weakness or fatigue is observed in
this condition, and it usually involves the muscles
that were initially affected by the poliovirus.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Stool, throat swab and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
are the specimens used to isolate the viruses.
Viruses can be isolated from faeces for more
than 30 days during the illness and from the throat
swab during the ﬁrst few days of the illness. The
virus is isolated rarely from the CSF specimens.
Microscopy
Microscopy of the CSF shows a predominantly
lymphocytic pleocytosis with the presence of
25–500
cells/mm3.
The
virus
is
rarely
demonstrated in the CSF.

786
55
Picornaviruses
Virus Isolation
Isolation of viruses from the clinical specimen by
tissue culture is the most speciﬁc method in
diagnosing poliomyelitis.
Virus isolation from faeces and throat swabs is
carried out by cultivating on monkey kidneys,
human amnion, HeLa, Hep-2, Buffalo green
monkey (BGM), MRC-5 and other cell cultures.
The cytopathic effects produced by the virus are
observed within 48 h. These consist of cell retrac-
tion, increased refractivity, cytoplasmic granular-
ity
and
nuclear
pyknosis.
Eosinophilic
intranuclear inclusion is seen.
Isolation of poliovirus from faeces does not
indicate a diagnosis of poliomyelitis, as large
numbers of asymptomatic illnesses are seen.
Hence, the isolation of poliomyelitis virus from
faeces needs to be interpreted carefully along with
the clinical presentation of the disease.
Identiﬁcation of serotype is carried out by
performing a neutralisation test. Differentiating
wild virulent virus strains from an attenuated
vaccine strain can be done by virulence test in
the monkeys and by performing polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).
Serology
Serology is based on demonstrating a fourfold
increase in the antibody titre of the serum col-
lected at the time of acute illness and the period of
convalescence. Neutralisation or complement ﬁx-
ation test is carried out to demonstrate antibodies.
Neutralising antibodies appear early and are pres-
ent throughout life. However, serodiagnosis is
less
frequently
used
for
the
diagnosis
of
poliomyelitis.
Molecular Detection
PCR is a highly sensitive and speciﬁc test for the
diagnosis of poliomyelitis. Sequencing could be
used to identify the three different strains of polio-
virus that usually circulates in the population that
is the wild virus, OPV strain and vaccine-derived
polioviruses. Identiﬁcation of strains present in a
population would help understand the molecular
epidemiology of poliovirus in a given population,
which is useful from a public health perspective.
Treatment
No antivirals are available for the treatment of
poliomyelitis.
Epidemiology
Poliovirus mainly affects children. However,
individuals of any age may also develop the dis-
ease. Most epidemics of paralytic poliomyelitis are
caused by poliovirus type 1, less commonly by
type 3. Poliovirus type 2 is a common cause of
paralytic poliomyelitis in India and is the causative
agent of inapparent illness in Western countries.
Geographical Distribution
The worldwide prevalence of poliomyelitis has
decreased by more than 99% due to improved
socio-economic conditions and the availability
of vaccines. Signiﬁcant progress has been made
in reducing the prevalence of poliomyelitis in
India. India was declared to be free in the
year 2014.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Natural infection occurs only in humans. Infected
humans excreting poliovirus in their stool are the
major
reservoir
of
infection.
Infected
stool
containing poliovirus is the major source. The
viruses secreted in throat secretions during the
early stage of the illness may also be another
source of infection.
Poor sanitation, low socio-economic status
and crowded living conditions facilitate the trans-
mission
of
infection.
Immunocompromised
patients, such as those with HIV infection, B
cell dysfunction and IgA deﬁciency, are particu-
larly at high risk of developing poliomyelitis
when exposed to poliovirus.
Prevention and Control
Poliovirus vaccines are the key component in
preventing polio and have played an important
role in the effort to eradicate polio worldwide.

Poliovirus
787
Vaccines
Two types of vaccines are used currently against
poliomyelitis.
Inactivated Polio Vaccine
Jonas Salk developed inactivated polio vaccine or
Salk vaccine in 1956 for immunisation against
poliomyelitis. The vaccine contains formalin-
inactivated strains of the three serotypes of the
poliovirus grown in monkey kidney cell culture.
The vaccine is given to children by deep subcuta-
neous or intramuscular injections in three doses.
The vaccine is given at 2 months, 4 months and at
school entry, usually 4 years. It does not cause the
development of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis
(VAP).
The injection of the vaccine elicits the produc-
tion of higher IgG antibody titres in the serum, but
it does not stimulate the production of detectable
levels of secretory IgA in the gut, hence does not
prevent alimentary tract infection. The main
advantage of this vaccine is that since it uses
killed
viruses,
it
can
be
safely
used
for
immunisation
in immunocompromised hosts.
The disadvantages of this vaccine are that (1) it
is not as immunogenic as the oral polio vaccine,
(2) it does not induce local mucosal immunity in
the gut and (3) it needs to be administered paren-
terally, which shows poor compliance.
In 1955, there was a major setback as more
than 100 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred
with this vaccination. Cutter was the manufac-
turer of this vaccine; hence the incident came to
be known as the Cutter incident. The company’s
vaccines had inactivated virus, which led to this
incident. After this incident, many modiﬁcations
were made to the vaccines to make them safer.
Live Attenuated Oral Polio Vaccine
Live attenuated oral polio vaccine or Sabin vac-
cine was developed by Albert Sabin in the year
1962. It contains live attenuated strains of the
three serotypes of poliovirus cultured in monkey
kidney cells or human diploid cells. The vaccine
is given orally, which causes natural infection. It
elicits the production of both local secretory IgA
antibodies in the pharynx and alimentary tract and
humoral IgG antibodies in the serum. The virus
cannot
multiply
in
the
CNS;
hence
it
is
non-neurovirulent. The vaccine virus is excreted
for several weeks in the faeces, during which the
vaccine virus spread may occur to close contacts,
inducing or boosting immunity in them. The ﬁrst
dose of the vaccine is given to infants at the age of
1½ months along with DPT. Second, third and
fourth vaccine doses are given when children are
raised to 2½, 3½ and 16–24 months, respectively
(Fig. 55.2).
The oral polio vaccine has been used since the
1960s. This vaccine has been mainly responsible
for a signiﬁcant decrease in disease prevalence
throughout the world. The advantages of this
vaccine are many: ﬁrst, it induces local mucosal
immunity; second, it provides appropriate herd
immunity and ﬁnally, it is cost-effective, espe-
cially in developing countries.
OPV, used in India, contains 10 lakh type
1 virus, 2 lakh type 2 virus and 3 lakh type
3 virus TC ID50 per dose (0.5 mL). MgCl2,
which
maintains
pH
below
seven,
is
thermostabilised along with the liquid vaccine.
The vaccine is kept in airtight containers, so the
pH is maintained. The shelf life of vaccines is
4 months when stored in 4–8 C and 2 years when
kept in 20 C. Not storing the vaccines in proper
conditions will lead to the failure of OPV in
controlling poliomyelitis in developing countries.
The major disadvantage of this vaccine is the
loss of efﬁcacy of vaccine due to improper cold
chain. Association of the vaccine with VAP is
another major disadvantage. Although the virus
content in this vaccine is attenuated, it may
become neurotropic and may produce disease sim-
ilar to wild type virus. The risk of VAP has been
estimated at between 0.5 and 3.4 cases per million.
The advantages and disadvantages of Sabin
and Salk vaccines are summarised in Table 55.3.
These include the following:
1. Ease of administration: OPV is preferred to
killed vaccines that are administrated through
injections. However, an advantage of the
killed vaccine is that it can be administered
with the DPT vaccine as a quadruple vaccine.
2. Cost-effectiveness:

by the antibodies which are being circulated.
When it comes to live vaccines, it stimulates
local immunity within the gut, which results in
the wild viruses being unable to multiply in the
intestine. This helps in protecting the individ-
ual and the community.
4. Persistence
of
immunity:
Administering
booster doses periodically may be required in
maintaining the immunity caused by a killed
vaccine. However, immunity from a live vac-
cine remains as a natural active immunity and
lasts longer.
5. Use in epidemics: Administering OPV at the
community level, OPV, which is a monovalent
vaccine of the same type which causes the
epidemic at the onset of paralytic poliomyelitis,
can effectively stop the epidemic. In many parts
of the world, this is being followed successfully.
Recently, a new monovalent oral poliovirus
type I vaccine (MOPVI) has been introduced.
This is used to eliminate some of the last poliovi-
rus reservoirs in the endemic countries. The vac-
cine is contraindicated in children who are
immunocompromised and also in those whose
caretakers are immunocompromised.
Criteria for attenuation of poliovirus strains
include: (1) the strain used should not be
neurovirulent
when
tested
by
inoculating
intraspinally in monkeys, (2) this should cause
intestinal infection after feeding and induce an
immune
response,
(3)
must
not
obtain
neurovirulence after serial enteric passage and
(4) should be genetically stable so that it can be
differentiated from the wild strains.
Differentiating
markers
for
wild
and
attenuated polio strain include (1) d marker:
Avirulent strains will not grow in a low level of
bicarbonate while wild strains will grow, (2) rct
40: At 40 C avirulent strains grow poorly while
wild strains grow well, (3) MS: When stable cell
line of monkey kidney is used, wild strains grow
well,
but
avirulent
cells
grow
poorly
and
(4) McBride intratypic antigenic marker uses
the rate at which speciﬁc antiserum is inactivated.
Safety of Polio Vaccine
Killed and live vaccines are both safe. Few sug-
gest that following vaccination, the attenuated
strains may acquire neurovirulence on serial
enteric passage. Since there are only a few reports
on vaccine-induced poliomyelitis threat is negli-
gible. The United States reports 5–10 paralysed
poliomyelitis cases each year due to vaccine
strain. Oral Polio Vaccination has been widely
administered in various parts of the world. Nev-
ertheless, OPV is not considered harmless in
immunosuppressed patients, but there is no sig-
niﬁcant harm from the killed vaccine.
The Efficiency of Polio Vaccine
A complete course of killed vaccine stimulates an
acceptable
immune
response.
In
developed
countries, one or two doses of OPV have produced
90–100% seroconversion in children. However, in
developing
countries,
especially
in
tropical
regions, there are dissatisfactory responses, partic-
ularly in connection with Polio type I. More than
half of the people administered with vaccines
failed to respond serologically even after multiple
doses, and the reasons are uncertain.
Issues Related to Vaccine Failure in Tropical
Regions
In tropical countries, the vaccines are sometimes
interfered with other enteroviruses. Experiments
have shown that coxsackie B has interfered with
the
poliovirus.
Frequently,
vaccine
virus
colonisation is prevented by frequent diarrhoeal
diseases. Another reason is breastfeeding soon
after or before the administration of vaccines.
The antibodies present in the breast milk may
neutralise the vaccine virus. It has been proposed
in India and other tropical regions that primary
immunisation with killed vaccines along with
triple antigen followed by live oral vaccines can
be given because the rate of seroconversion after
oral immunisation is poor.
Spread of Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses
In many developed countries, the propensity of the
vaccine virus to spread naturally among children is
a major disadvantage, but it can help expand the
vaccine coverage in countries with wild virus
endemicity. Nevertheless, it is advisable to vacci-
nate the entire community at one go which helps in
preventing its natural dissemination.

Poliomyelitis Eradication
Eradication of poliomyelitis was considered pos-
sible through global immunisation with OPV.
World Health Organisation assembly proposed
to target this objective in the year 1988. WHO
planned to eradicate poliomyelitis by the year
2000 globally; however, due to reduced progress
of immunisation in many countries, this objective
could not be accomplished.
Pulse Polio Immunisation Program (PPI)
PPI is being used in India to eradicate poliomyeli-
tis. This program includes mass administration of
OPV on a particular day to all the children aged
between 0 and 5 years within the community. The
program follows the strategy of administering two
rounds of doses at an interval of 4–6 weeks from
November to February, which is considered a low
polio transmission period in winter. Whatever the
child’s immunisation status, the dosage can be
administered. This does not replace the national
universal immunisation program. By doing so,
increasing the immunity of the majority of the
children of a particular area can be achieved.
Coxsackie Viruses
Coxsackie viruses are so named because the
viruses were ﬁrst isolated in Coxsackie village in
New York, United States, by Dandruff and Sickel
in the year 1985. Based on the pathological
changes produced in suckling mice, these viruses
are classiﬁed into two groups: Coxsackie viruses A
and Coxsackie viruses B. Coxsackie A virus
produces generalised myositis, ﬂaccid paralysis
followed by death within a week in suckling
mice. Coxsackie B virus produces patchy focal
myositis, spastic paralysis, localised lesions in the
liver, myocardium, pancreas and brain and brown
fat pads.
Properties of the Virus
The structure and morphology of the coxsackie
viruses and the RNA genome are similar to
poliovirus. However, unlike poliovirus, they can
infect mammals other than primates. The replica-
tion cycle is similar to that of poliovirus.
Coxsackie A viruses consist of 24 serotypes and
are associated with diseases involving vesicular
lesions, such as herpangina. Coxsackie B viruses
consist of six serotypes and are most frequently
associated with myocarditis and pleurodynia.
Coxsackie A viruses show tropism for skin
and mucous membranes, whereas coxsackie B
viruses show a predilection for visceral organs,
such as the liver, heart, pancreas and pleura. Both
the viruses infect anterior horn cells of the motor
neurons and meninges and cause paralysis. They
replicate ﬁrst in the oropharynx and gastrointesti-
nal tract, from where they spread by the blood
circulation.
Host
immunity
is
IgG-antibody
mediated and is type-speciﬁc.
Coxsackie virus infection occurs worldwide.
Humans are the only natural hosts. The viruses
are transmitted primarily by the faecal–oral route.
Clinical Syndromes
Coxsackie A Virus
Coxsackie A viruses produce the following
conditions.
Herpangina
This condition is caused by coxsackie A virus
serotypes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10. The infection is
most commonly seen in children between 1 and
7 years. The symptoms include sudden onset of
fever, sore throat and difﬁculty in swallowing.
The classical ﬁnding is a painful vesicular erup-
tion of the oral mucosa around the soft palate and
uvula. Less commonly, these lesions may be
found on the hard palate. The condition is self-
limiting. The viruses are isolated from the lesions
or the faeces.
Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease
This is a vesicular exanthema usually caused by
coxsackie virus serotypes 5 and 16. This is mainly
a disease of children, seen most commonly in
patients younger than 10 years. After an incuba-
tion period of 3–6 days, the infection begins with

pro-dromal symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore
throat, malaise and anorexia. After 12–36 h,
vesicular eruptions appear on the hands, feet and
oral cavity. This is a self-limiting condition, and
the illness subsides in a few days.
Echoviruses
791
Coxsackie B Virus
Coxsackie B viruses produce the following
conditions.
Pleurodynia
This condition, also known as epidemic myalgia
or Bornholm disease, is caused by coxsackie B
virus serotypes 3 and 5. This condition is an acute
illness, which manifests with a sudden onset of
fever accompanied by muscular pain and pain in
the chest and abdomen. The pain is spasmodic.
The condition usually lasts for 4 days but may
relapse again after the condition has been asymp-
tomatic for several days.
Myocarditis
This is a serious condition caused by the
coxsackie B virus, mostly in newborn infants.
Shortness of breath, dull or sharp chest pain and
fever are the common manifestations of the con-
dition. This is a life-threatening condition, mostly
in newborns. In adults, the condition presents
with myocardial infection with fever. The condi-
tion is associated with high morbidity.
Juvenile Diabetes
Juvenile diabetes has been alleged to associate
with coxsackie B4 infection. However, this role
in causing the disease has not been proved.
Orchitis
This disease has also been reported to be
associated with the coxsackie virus.

This transmission has been exhibited along with
coxsackie
B
viruses.
It
results
in
serious
disseminated diseases, including hepatitis, menin-
goencephalitis and adrenocortical involvement.
Type B viruses have been found to be linked
with a condition called post-viral fatigue syn-
drome. However, the condition and the associa-
tion have not been clearly deﬁned.
Coxsackie A and B Viruses
Aseptic meningitis is the condition produced by
both coxsackie A and B viruses. The condition is
caused by coxsackie A serotypes 2, 4, 7 and 9 and
coxsackie B viruses. The laboratory diagnosis of
coxsackie virus infection is made by isolating the
virus from the faeces or lesions by intracerebral or
intraperitoneal
inoculation
into
a
1-day-old
mouse. Identiﬁcation of the virus is carried out
by histopathology study of the infected mouse
after sacriﬁce. Some of the coxsackie viruses
can also be isolated by culture in human diploid
embryonic lung ﬁbroblasts, BGM and HeLa cell
lines.
Cytopathic
effects
resemble
those
of
polioviruses but develop more slowly, beginning
as foci of rounded refractile cells, which die and
fall off the glass. Serology by neutralising
antibodies is strain speciﬁc. Other autoantibodies
are also detected by immunoﬂuorescences. TR
PCR is also used to detect nucleocapsid of the
virus.
Differences between Coxsackie viruses A and
B are summarised in Table 55.4.
Echoviruses
Echoviruses was originally isolated from the
faeces of an individual who had no clinical illness
and caused a cytopathic effect in the cell culture.

The preﬁx ECHO is an acronym for enteric cyto-
pathogenic
human
orphan
viruses
(ECHO
viruses). They were earlier called ‘orphans’
because these viruses were not associated earlier
with any disease, but now, they are known to
cause various human illnesses.
792
55
Picornaviruses
The echoviruses resemble other enteroviruses
in their properties. They are classiﬁed into
32 serotypes (1–34 except 10 and 28) based on
their type-speciﬁc neutralisation capsid antigen.
Some serotypes of echoviruses (types 3, 6, 7, 11,
12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 24, 29, 30 and 33) cause
haemagglutination of human red cells. Agglutina-
tion of red cells is followed by elution, making the
red
cells
inagglutinable
by
echoviruses
or
Coxsackie viruses but not by myxoviruses. All
echoviruses grow in human and monkey kidney
cell lines, producing cytopathic effects.
Most of the echoviruses cause asymptomatic
infections in humans, but some of them have been
associated
with
many
clinical
syndromes.
Non-speciﬁc febrile illness associated with rash,
headache and common-cold-like symptoms is
caused
by
many
serotypes
of
echoviruses.
Echoviruses also cause aseptic meningitis. Some
strains of echovirus have been associated with
gastroenteritis
(serotype
8)
and
respiratory
diseases in children (serotypes 1, 11, 19, 20
and 22).
Laboratory diagnosis of echovirus infection is
made by isolating viruses from faeces, throat
swabs or CSF. They are cultured using human
diploid embryonic lung ﬁbroblast and human
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. The growth of the
virus is detected by cytopathic changes, which is
similar to that of other coxsackie viruses.
Humans are the natural hosts for these viruses.
Echoviruses are found in the intestinal tract of
infected humans. The infection, like another
enterovirus, is transmitted by the faecal–oral
route. The summer season is common for its
epidemics. So far, vaccination for this virus has
not been tried.
Other Enteroviruses
Four new enteroviruses have been described that
include enteroviruses 68, 69, 70 and 71. Of these,
enterovirus 69 does not cause many human
diseases, but the rest of the three enteroviruses
cause diseases in humans. Type 68 causes pneu-
monia and bronchitis, type 70 causes acute
haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) and type
71 causes meningoencephalitis and paralysis.
Enterovirus 70
Enterovirus 70 is the causative agent of acute
haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC).
Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly
contagious ocular infection, which can cause
large-scale epidemics. The incubation period is
about 24 h, and the onset is abrupt. The most
common symptoms include pain in the eyes,
burning sensation, swelling of the eyelids and
foreign body sensation in the eye. Photophobia
and watery discharge may also be found in some
cases. The other eye becomes infected a few
hours after infection of the ﬁrst eye. Fever, mal-
aise and headache are the non-speciﬁc symptoms.
AHC is a self-limiting condition. The symptoms
typically improve by the second or third day of
infection, and the recovery is complete within
7–10 days.
Isolation of the virus is made by culturing in
human diploid embryonic kidney and HeLa cell
lines. Transmission is facilitated by overcrowding
and non-sanitary conditions. The infection is
transmitted directly from the ﬁnger or fomite to
the eye.
Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis was ﬁrst
recognised in 1969 in Ghana and Indonesia. Sub-
sequently, the condition spread widely, involving
several parts of Japan, England, Europe, Africa,
the Middle East and Southeast Asia, including
India. Coxsackie virus A 24 has also been
known to cause similar diseases. The condition
is most prevalent in adults between 20 and
50 years.

C
Rhinoviruses
793
Rhinoviruses
Rhinoviruses are the most important causative
agents of common cold and upper respiratory
tract infections. Earlier, many viruses isolated
from the cases of common cold were known as
common cold viruses, Salisbury viruses or Muri
viruses. All these viruses have been given the
name rhinoviruses (rhino referring to the organ
speciﬁcally affected).
Properties of Virus
Rhinoviruses are small RNA viruses morpholog-
ically
resembling
other
picornaviruses.
Rhinoviruses differ from other picornaviruses in
being more acid-labile and more heat stable. They
are inactivated at a low pH below 5 and become
completely inactive at pH 3. For several days,
they are relatively stable at 20–37 C and can
survive on environmental surfaces, such as
doorknobs. Some serotypes may survive heating
at 50 C for 1 h. They are resistant to 20% ether
and 5% chloroform but are sensitive to hypochlo-
rite
and
aldehyde.
Differences
between
enteroviruses and rhinoviruses are summarised
in Table 55.5.
The rhinoviruses have been classiﬁed into
more than 102 serotypes based on a type-speciﬁc
antigen in their capsids.
Laboratory Isolation
Rhinoviruses grow at 37 C in cell lines of human
or simian origin in the presence of good
oxygenation, low pH (7 or less) and low temper-
ature. They can grow in human embryonic tra-
cheal epithelial, human diploid cell lines and
HeLa cells, but without producing conspicuous
cytopathic effects. Some strains grow well in both
monkey and human cell lines and are designated
as M strains, and those that grow only on human
cells are known as H strains.

Pathogenesis of Rhinovirus Infections
Infection is transmitted to other susceptible
human hosts by nasal secretions expelled from a
patient’s nose during sneezing and coughing.
Infection can be initiated by as little as one infec-
tious viral particle. Rhinoviruses grow better
in vivo at a temperature of 30 C than at 37 C,
a property that contributes partially to the predi-
lection of these viruses for the cooler environment
of the nose and conjunctiva. The infection occurs
mostly by multiplication of the virus in the nose.
The onset and severity of the symptoms usually
correlate with the quantity of viruses excreted in
the nasal secretion and the time of viral shedding.
During the acute phase of illness, nasal
secretions
contain
approximately
500–1000
infectious virions/mL of secretions. Also, these
secretions
may
contaminate
hands,
ﬁngers,
handkerchiefs or paper tissues and the normal
susceptible hosts who come in contact with
these contaminated surfaces acquire the virus.
The virus enters through the nose, mouth or
eyes and causes upper respiratory tract infections,
including the throat.
Host immunity in rhinoviruses is characterised
by both humoral and cell-mediated immunities.

Humoral immunity is characterised by the pro-
duction of both nasal secretory IgA and serum
IgG antibodies within a week of infection. The
cell-mediated immunity does not play an impor-
tant role in controlling rhinovirus infection.
Immunity is transient and is usually serotype-
speciﬁc. Therefore, one attack of the common
cold by rhinovirus does not confer immunity
against subsequent attacks due to the presence
of numerous serotypes of the virus.
794
55
Picornaviruses
Clinical Syndromes
The incubation period of common cold caused by
Rhinovirus is 2–4 days. The condition begins as
an upper respiratory infection with sneezing,
followed by a running nose
(rhinorrhoea).
Rhinorrhoea then increases and is associated
with symptoms of nasal obstruction. Mild sore
throat, headache, malaise, fever and rigor some-
times accompany rhinovirus infection. Usually,
symptoms subside in about a week, but in some
cases, the cough and nasal symptoms may persist
for 7–10 days or longer.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The clinical manifestations of the common cold
are characteristic; hence laboratory diagnosis is
only supportive.
Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating the
virus from nasal washing by culture on human
diploid ﬁbroblast cells (e.g. WI-38 at 33 C). The
rhinoviruses are identiﬁed by the typical cyto-
pathic effects and demonstration of acid lability.
Serotyping of the strains is performed using pools
of speciﬁc neutralising antisera.
Epidemiology
Rhinoviruses are the major cause of the common
cold and are responsible for more than 50% of all
colds worldwide. Other viruses which may also
cause the common cold include coronaviruses,
coxsackie viruses A21 and A24, echoviruses
11 and 20 and parainﬂuenza viruses.
The common cold occurs most commonly in
infants and children and occurs most frequently in
the early autumn and the late spring in people
living in temperate climates. The non-enveloped
rhinoviruses are extremely stable and survive on
external objects, such as fomites, for many hours,
thereby facilitating the transmission of infection.
Infected humans suffering from acute illness
are the only reservoirs and sources of rhinovirus
that cause the common cold. Asymptomatic peo-
ple also play an important role in transmitting the
infection even though they shed a few viruses in
their respiratory secretions. Rhinovirus is trans-
mitted mainly by two routes: ﬁrst, by direct inha-
lation of infectious droplets and second, by direct
contact with hands or fomites contaminated with
respiratory droplets. Contaminated hands appear
to be the major transmission route, and direct
person-to-person contact is the major mode of
spread of infection.
Treatment
Treatment of the condition is symptomatic.
Prevention and Control
No
vaccine
is
available
against
rhinovirus.
Handwashing and disinfection of contaminated
objects are the best methods of preventing trans-
mission of the virus.
Hepatitis A Virus
Hepatitis A virus, formerly known as enterovirus,
has now been accorded the status of a separate
genus Hepatovirus of the family Picornaviridae.
The virus is discussed in detail in Chap. 63.

Hepatitis A Virus
795
Case Study
A 7-year-old girl came to a hospital with ﬂaccid
paralysis of the right leg. Her parents provided a
history of paralysis for the past 2 weeks. On
examination, no sensory loss was elicited in the
affected right leg. The girl was suspected to be
suffering
from
paralytic
poliomyelitis.
On
enquiry, the parents gave the history of the girl
receiving oral polio vaccine during her childhood.

Orthomyxoviruses
56
Myxovirus was coined for a group of enveloped
RNA viruses that can adsorb onto mucoprotein
receptors
on
erythrocytes,
causing
haemagglutination.
Inﬂuenza,
mumps,
parainﬂuenza
and
Newcastle disease viruses were initially grouped
in the class myxovirus (myxa meaning mucus)
due to their afﬁnity to mucins. However, two
separate families were created subsequent to
recognising
clear
differences
between
these
viruses. These two families are Orthomyx-
oviridae, consisting of inﬂuenza viruses, and
Paramyxoviridae, consisting of parainﬂuenza,
mumps,
measles,
respiratory
syncytial
and
Newcastle disease viruses. Differences between
Orthomyxoviruses
and
Paramyxoviruses
are
summarised in Table 56.1.
Influenza Viruses
The genus Orthomyxovirus includes inﬂuenza
viruses, the classic respiratory viruses, and the
causative
agents
of
worldwide
inﬂuenza
epidemics.
Morphology
Inﬂuenza viruses are spherical or ﬁlamentous,
enveloped particles 80–120 nm in diameter. It
comprises
a
characteristic
segmented
single-stranded RNA genome, a nucleocapsid
and an envelope (Fig. 56.1).

797
The viral genome is a single-stranded anti-
sense
RNA.
The
genome
consists
of
an
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase,
which
transcribes the negative-polarity genome into
mRNA. The genome, therefore, is not infectious.
Characteristically, it is segmented and consists of
seven or eight segments. These segments code for
different proteins, which are NS1, NS2, NP, M1,
M2, M3, HA and NA.
The genome is present in a helically symmetric
nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope. The
envelope has an inner membrane protein layer
and an outer lipid layer. The membrane proteins
are known as matrix or M proteins and are com-
posed of two components, M1 and M2. Two
types of spikes XE or peplomers project from
the envelope: i) the triangular haemagglutinin
(HA) peplomers and ii) the mushroom-shaped
neuraminidase (NA) peplomers.
Virus Replication
Inﬂuenza
virus,
hepatitis
delta
virus
and
retroviruses are the only RNA viruses with an
important stage of their replication cycle in the
nucleus. Infection of the host cell begins by
adsorption of the cell by the inﬂuenza virus,
which is mediated through the HA. HA is ﬁrst
cleaved by an extracellular protease to a modiﬁed
HA that mediates the attachment of the virus to

Neuraminidase (N)
the cell surface. Once inside the cell, the virus
uncoats within the endosome.

Eight segments of
single-stranded RNA
In the host cell nucleus, the virion RNA poly-
merase transcribes the eight genome segments
into eight viral mRNAs. However, most of the
viral mRNAs move out of the nucleus into the
cytoplasm, where they are translated into viral
proteins. Some of the viral mRNAs remain in
the nucleus and serve as the templates for
synthesising the negative-strand RNA genomes
for the progeny virions. In the nucleus, two
proteins, namely, nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix
protein, are synthesised, which then bind with the
RNA genome of the viral progeny and form a
complex, which is subsequently transported to
the cytoplasm.
Matrix protein mediates the interaction of the
nucleocapsid with the envelope, and ﬁnally, the
virion is released from the cell by budding from
the cell membrane at the site where the HA and
NAs are present.
Antigenic Properties
Inﬂuenza viruses have two types of antigens:
Group-speciﬁc antigen and type-speciﬁc antigen.

Group-Specific Antigen
The RNP antigen, the soluble antigen, or the

composed
of
two
virus-encoded
proteins,
Haemagglutinin
(HA)
HA
and
NeuraminidaseNA, which are the type-speciﬁc
antigens (Fig. 56.2).
Haemagglutinin (HA)
It is a trimer composed of two polypeptides, HA1
and HA2, responsible for haemadsorption and
haemagglutination.
The
HA
consists
of
500 spikes, each measuring 12 nm in length.
The triangular-shaped HA is inserted into the
virus membrane by its tail end. The distal end,
which contains ﬁve antigenic sites (designated as
HA1–HA5), is responsible for binding the virion
to host cells.
Inﬂuenza viruses adsorb many avian and
mammalian erythrocytes. HA binds with the
neuraminic acid (sialic acid) cell receptor, the
cell surface glycoprotein receptor and initiates
the infection in the host cell. Adsorption of
erythrocytes occurs at 4 C, but at 37 C there is
detachment of the red cells due to the destruction
of the glycoprotein receptors by the viral enzyme
NA. The HA agglutinates certain red blood cells,
which is inhibited by the neutralising antibodies.
This forms the basis of the haemagglutination
inhibition test used in the serodiagnosis of
inﬂuenza.
HA has the potency to undergo antigenic
variations.
The
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
sequences of the polypeptides, HA1 and HA2,
undergo radical changes in an antigenic shift. In
antigenic drift, only minor changes occur in HA
antigenic sites’ compositions.
Neuraminidase (NA)
It is a glycoprotein and tetramer. It consists of
100 mushroom-shaped spikes. The mushroom-
shaped NA is inserted by its hydrophobic tail
end into the virus membrane. The distal end
contains antigenic as well as enzymatically active
sites. The NA causes hydrolysis of N-acetyl
neuraminic acid or sialic acid residues present
on the glycoprotein receptors on red cells, hence
causing elution or detachment of the cells
adsorbed to virion particles. The function of the
NA is to cleave the neuraminic acid and release
progeny virions from the infected host cells. The
NA also degrades the mucus layer, thereby

exposing the epithelial membrane of the respira-
tory tract for infection by the virus.

Classification
Inﬂuenza viruses are divided into types A, B and
C based on variation in this RNP antigen.
All these strains of inﬂuenza A, B and C share
the common internal proteins, such as NPs and
membrane proteins. They, however, differ in their
surface proteins, such as HAs and NAs. Inﬂuenza
virus type A is subdivided into 15 HA subtypes
(H1-H15) based on HA and to 9 NA subtypes
based on the NA. The strains that cause infection
in humans belong to subtypes H1-H3, H5 and N1
and, N2.
Antigenic Variations
Antigenic variation is a unique feature of the
inﬂuenza virus. The surface antigens HA and
NA show variations and are primarily responsible
for antigenic variations exhibited by inﬂuenza
viruses. Antigenic variations are of two types:
antigenic shift and antigenic drift.
The abrupt, drastic, discontinuous change in
antigenic structure is called the antigenic shift.
This occurs due to major antigenic changes in HA
or NA antigens and is caused by replacing the
gene for HA by one coding for a completely
different amino acid sequence. The antigenic
shift is characterised by altering virtually all the
antigenic sites of the HA. This occurs indepen-
dently in the HA and NA.
The gradual, sequential, regular antigenic
change in the inﬂuenza virus is known as anti-
genic drift. This occurs due to minor antigenic
changes in the HA or NA occurring at frequent
intervals. This is caused even by a single mutation
affecting HA glycoprotein. The antigenic drift is
characterised by changes in certain epitopes in the
HA, while others are conserved. Differences
between antigenic shift and antigenic drift are
summarised in Table 56.2.
Inﬂuenza A virus shows maximum antigenic
3. B virus does not undergo antigenic shift
because inﬂuenza B virus is the only human
virus for which there is no animal source of new
RNA segments. However, the inﬂuenza B virus
undergoes antigenic drift. Antigenic variation
never occurs in type C inﬂuenza virus.
Gene Re-assortment
As the inﬂuenza virus genome is segregated,
genetic re-assortment shall occur when a host
cell is affected concurrently with viruses belong-
ing to two-parent strains, which are different. This
process of genetic re-assortment accounts for the
periodic appearance of the novel types of inﬂu-
enza A strains that cause inﬂuenza pandemics.
Inﬂuenza viruses of animals, such as aquatic
birds, chickens, swine and horses, show high host
speciﬁcity. These animal viruses are the source of
the RNA segments that encode the antigenic shift
variants that cause epidemics amongst humans.
For example, if a person is infected simulta-
neously by an avian and human inﬂuenza strain,
then it is possible that a genetic re-assortment

influenza virus
could occur in infected cells in humans. The
re-assortment could lead to the emergence of a
new human inﬂuenza A virus, the progeny of
which will contain a mixture of genome segments
from the two strains (e.g. a new variant of human
inﬂuenza A virus bearing the avian virus HA)
(Fig. 56.3).

Many studies have conclusively demonstrated
that aquatic birds (such as waterfowl) are a com-
mon source of these new genes. The pigs act as
mixing vessels, where these virulent genes of
waterfowl mix with the genome of the inﬂuenza
virus, giving rise to a new variant of the inﬂuenza
virus.

Nomenclature of Influenza Viruses
Inﬂuenza virus type A can be classiﬁed into
subtypes based on the variations in their surface
antigens (Table 56.3). The WHO proposed a new
classiﬁcation system in 1971 and was later
modiﬁed, which considers the nature of both the
surface antigens. According to this, the complete
designation of a strain will include the (1) type,
(2) place of origin, (3) serial number and (4) year
of isolation, followed by (5) antigenic subtypes of
the HA and NA in parentheses. For example,
inﬂuenza A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) indicates
that inﬂuenza was ﬁrst originated from Singapore

Other Properties
Inﬂuenza viruses are inactivated by ether, formal-
dehyde, phenol, salts of heavy metals and com-
mon chemical disinfectants. Heating at 50 C for
30 min inactivates most strains of the virus. Inﬂu-
enza viruses are resistant to slow drying. They
remain viable in dust for up to 2 weeks, at 70 C
for
a
longer
period,
and
by
freeze-drying
indeﬁnitely.
Laboratory Isolation
Inﬂuenza viruses are isolated from respiratory
secretions by growing in chick embryos or tissue
cultures.
Chick Embryos
The inﬂuenza viruses grow in the allantoic and
amniotic cavity of the chick embryos. After an
incubation period of 3 days, the ﬂuid is tested for
haemagglutination activities of the viruses.
Tissue Culture
Cell lines are widely used for the culture of inﬂu-
enza viruses. They can grow in several primary
and continuous cell lines. Rhesus monkey kidney
cell lines (LLC-MK2) and Madin–Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) are the continuous cell lines
frequently used to isolate inﬂuenza viruses.
Laboratory Animals
The human inﬂuenza virus causes experimental
infections in a variety of animals. Intracerebral
inoculation of mice by neurotrophic strains
produces fatal encephalitis. It causes an acute
respiratory disease on intranasal inoculation in
ferrets.
Pathogenesis of Influenza
Inﬂuenza virus is transmitted from person to per-
son primarily in droplets released by sneezing and
coughing. Inhaled inﬂuenza viruses reach the
lower respiratory tract, tracheobronchial tree, the
primary site of the disease. They attach to sialic
acid receptors on epithelial cells by HA present
on the viral envelope. Relatively few viruses are
needed to infect the lower respiratory tract than
the upper respiratory tract.

Influenza Viruses
803
The viral envelope contains NA, which may
act on the N-acetyl neuraminic acid residues
present in mucus to cause liquefaction. With the
help of mucociliary transport, the mucus which
was liqueﬁed spreads the virus throughout the
respiratory tract. Mucosal cells which are infected
result in destruction at a cellular level and desqua-
mation of the mucosa superﬁcially. Oedema
caused leads to mononuclear cell inﬁltration of
the associated areas. They are combined with the
signs, which include a cough, sore throat and
nasal discharge.
The antibody is the primary defence in immu-
nity
to
re-infection.
IgA
antibody,
which
predominates in upper respiratory secretions, is
less persistent than secretory IgG but contributes
to confer immunity. Secretory IgG antibody,
which
predominates
in
lower
respiratory
secretions, appears most important.
Antibodies
provide
long-lasting
immunity
against
the
infecting
inﬂuenza
strain.
Only
antibodies directed against HA can prevent infec-
tion neutralising the virus’s infectivity, thereby
preventing the disease. Antibodies against NA
do not neutralise infectivity but reduce the sever-
ity of the disease. The antibodies against the
internal RNP group-speciﬁc antigen do not confer
any immunity.
Immunity to the inﬂuenza virus is strain-
speciﬁc and lasts for many years. Recurrent
cases of inﬂuenza are caused primarily by anti-
genically different strains. The role of cell-
mediated
immunity
in
conferring
protection
against inﬂuenza is not clear.
Clinical Syndromes
The virus causes classic inﬂuenza (Table 56.5).
Table 56.5 Infections associated with influenza virus
Infections
Clinical manifestations
Inﬂuenza in
adults
Fever, malaise, myalgia, sore throat and non-productive cough
Inﬂuenza in
children
Acute disease similar to that in adults but with high fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, otitis media,
myositis and croup
Complications
Primary viral pneumonia; secondary bacterial pneumonia; neurological complications, such as
Guillain–Barre syndrome, encephalopathies, encephalitis and Reye syndrome
Influenza
The incubation period is short (1–3 days). Even
though non-productive cough seems to be the
strong predictor, the most important symptoms
of inﬂuenza can be classiﬁed into (1) systemic—
fever, muscle aches and (2) general—prostration.
The virus remains localised to the respiratory
tract; hence, viremia does not occur. Inﬂuenza
presents
as
febrile
illness
of
rapid
onset,
associated with headache, chills, fever, malaise,
myalgias, anorexia and sore throat. The body
temperature increases rapidly to 101–104
F
(38.3–40.0 C), and respiratory symptoms arise.
The
common
symptoms
are
sneezing,
rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction. Patients may
also complain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
hoarseness, photophobia and abdominal pain.
They appear severely ill and are continuously
coughing. Mild to moderate obstruction of nasal
passages, nasal discharge and pharyngeal inﬂam-
mation may also be encountered. The examina-
tion of the lung is essentially performed. The
viruses mostly cause subclinical infections. They
do not display the classic syndrome described
previously.
Complications
Interstitial Pneumonia
Occasionally, in the patients suffering from heart
or lung disease, the infection abundantly affects
the alveoli, causing interstitial pneumonia, which
may be seen with considerable aggregation of
oedema and haemorrhage of the lung. Viral pneu-
monia of mentioned type is a serious illness with
increased
mortality.
The
titres
of
virus
in
secretions are more, and viral shedding is
extended. In many cases, pneumonia associated
with
inﬂuenza
is
produced
by
bacteria,

predominantly staphylococci, pneumococci and
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. These bacteria cause
disease by invading as the advancing viral infec-
tion attacks the normal defence mechanisms of
the lung.
804
56
Orthomyxoviruses
Pneumonia may be fatal, particularly (1) in
elderly persons above 60 years with underlying
chronic disease, (2) in people with impaired resis-
tance (chronic cardiorespiratory disease, renal
disease, etc.), and (3) in pregnant women.
Guillain–Barre Syndrome
It is a rare complication of inﬂuenza and is
characterised by encephalomyelitis and polyneu-
ritis. This condition was documented in the
United States in 1976, following extensive vacci-
nation with inactivated H3N2 inﬂuenza virus.
Reye Syndrome
It is a noted complication of inﬂuenza B infection.
The condition is seen most commonly in young
children and is associated with degenerative
changes in the brain, liver and kidney.
Laboratory Diagnosis
During an inﬂuenza epidemic, a clinical diagnosis
can be made, but a deﬁnitive diagnosis depends
on the laboratory methods.
Specimens
Specimens include nasal or throat washings or
sputum for viral antigen and viral RNA, throat
gargles for isolation of viruses and serum for viral
antibodies. Throat gargles is collected in saline
broth or a buffered salt solution and is sent imme-
diately to the laboratory, or if delayed is, stored at
4 C. The virus is isolated from the specimen by
inoculation into embryonated eggs or certain cell
cultures.
Direct Antigen Detection
Immunoﬂuorescence
(IF)
or
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using speciﬁc
monoclonal antibodies are used commercially to
detect viral antigens directly on cells obtained
from the nasopharynx. The results of the rapid
tests are useful to start treatment with the NA
inhibitors within 48 h of the onset of symptoms.
Chick Embryo Inoculation
The specimen is inoculated into the amniotic cav-
ity of the chick embryo. Except for type C, the
virus also grows in the allantoic cavity after a few
passages. After incubation at 35 C for 3 days, the
amniotic ﬂuid and allantoic ﬂuid are harvested
and tested for the presence of viral HA. The
highest dilution of the virus suspension that
causes
red
cells’
agglutination
is
called
Haemagglutination (HA) titre. This is carried out
using fowl and guinea pig red cells parallel and
incubating at room temperature and 4 C. Usu-
ally, inﬂuenza A viruses agglutinate only guinea
pig cells, inﬂuenza B both fowl and guinea pig
red cells, and inﬂuenza C agglutinate only fowl
cells at 4 C. If the test is positive, the isolate is
then
typed
by
a
serological
test
(e.g. haemagglutination inhibition test) using spe-
ciﬁc antisera to types A, B and C.
Cell Culture
Inﬂuenza virus is usually isolated from respira-
tory secretions by growing in shell vial cultures of
monkey kidney or baboon kidney cell lines. The
cell cultures are incubated at 33 C in the roller
drums in the presence of trypsin but without
serum. Virus growth is detected by direct demon-
stration of viral antigen in infected cell cultures by
IF, RT-PCRor by testing for haemadsorption with
human O, fowl and guinea pig red cells. In a
positive haemadsorption test, red cells adhere to
the virus budding from infected cells. If the cul-
ture tests positive, serologic tests with speciﬁc
antisera may be used to identify the virus.
Serology
Demonstration of a rise in serum antibody titre
between acute-phase and convalescent-phase sera
by a serological test is diagnostic of infection. The
acute-phase sera are collected within a few days
of illness and the convalescent sera 7–10 days
after the illness.

Influenza Viruses
805
Haemagglutination Inhibition Test
It is a sensitive serological diagnostic test of
inﬂuenza. This is a suitable method used to
deduce and quantify the antibody to the virus.
At times, certain substances in the sera cause
non-speciﬁc
inhibition
of
haemagglutination.
This is a drawback of this technique. Alpha
(Francis), Beta (Chu) and Gamma (Shimojo) are
the names given to different kinds of non-speciﬁc
inhibitors found in the sera. Many techniques are
used for inactivating them without affecting the
antibody content of sera. Treatments with potas-
sium periodate kaolin, trypsin, RDE and CO2 are
used to inactivate the inhibitors. There is no sin-
gle method that has been found effective in
completely inactivating the inhibitors to all types
of viruses from all kinds of sera.
Enzyme Neutralisation Test and ELISA
These are the other tests also used to demonstrate
antibodies. However, none of these techniques is
useful
to
identify
all
infections.
Various
approaches followed for laboratory diagnosis of
inﬂuenza are summarised in Table 56.6.
Molecular Detection
The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reac-
tion is used to detect viral nucleic acid in the
nasopharyngeal cells for the diagnosis of inﬂu-
enza. The use of different target genes in the
RT-PCR assays is most appropriate for the correct
identiﬁcation of this virus. The following gene
targets are often used, namely type A inﬂuenza
matrix gene, haemagglutinin gene-speciﬁc for
inﬂuenza A subtypes like A (H1N1) pdm09
virus, A(H3N2), A(H1N1), A(H5N1) viruses,
avian inﬂuenza A (H7N9) virus and other zoo-
notic subtypes. Amongst other targets, type B
inﬂuenza targeting matrix or NP or NS genes
and haemagglutinin gene-speciﬁc for inﬂuenza
B virus are used. The WHO gives several
RT-PCR protocols to detect inﬂuenza viruses.
Human specimens with laboratory results indica-
tive of inﬂuenza A that are unsubtypeable or
detected/diagnosed
as
non-seasonal
subtypes
should be sent to a WHO referral centre immedi-
ately for conﬁrmation.

Treatment
Amantadine and rimantadine are the speciﬁc
antiviral agents available for the treatment of
inﬂuenza. These drugs are effective against the
inﬂuenza A virus but not against the inﬂuenza B
virus. When given within 1–2 days of the onset of
illness, these drugs reduce the severity of the
disease and hasten the disappearance of fever
and other symptoms. The drugs are recommended
to prevent inﬂuenza in the elderly unimmunised
population in whom inﬂuenza can cause a life-
threatening infection. The emergence of viral
resistance can occur during treatment.
Zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiﬂu)
are newer drugs for the treatment of inﬂuenza and
are effective against both inﬂuenza A and B

viruses. These are the NA inhibitors, which
inhibit the release of viruses from infected cells.
These drugs also prevent the spread of the virus
from one cell to another. Relenza is used in the
form of nasal spray, whereas Tamiﬂu is given
orally.

Orthomyxoviruses
Epidemiology
Inﬂuenza occurs worldwide. The worst, severe
pandemic
(Spanish
ﬂu)
occurred
in
1918–1919, which caused about 20 million
deaths worldwide. Inﬂuenza epidemics have
been recorded throughout history. Inﬂuenza A is
generally
more
pathogenic
than
inﬂuenza
B. Inﬂuenza A is a zoonotic infection, and more
than 100 types of inﬂuenza A viruses have been
described which affects birds, horses, pigs, dogs
and seals. The pandemic of inﬂuenza that
occurred in 1918 and resulted in millions of
human
deaths
has
been
believed
to
have
commenced from a virulent strain, that is, H1N1
from pigs or birds (Table 56.7).
Geographical Distribution
Inﬂuenza viruses cause epidemic, endemic and
pandemic inﬂuenza. Inﬂuenza A virus causes
epidemics and occasionally pandemics; inﬂuenza
B virus only causes epidemics, and inﬂuenza C
viruses only cause minor respiratory illnesses and
do not cause epidemics.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Infected humans are the main reservoir of
infections for the inﬂuenza A virus. The respira-
tory secretions of infected persons are the impor-
tant source of infection. The virus is excreted in
respiratory secretions immediately before the
onset of illness and for 3–4 days after that. Wild
aquatic birds are known reservoirs of inﬂuenza
A. They secrete the viruses in their faeces, which
contaminates ponds and lakes. The virus is spread
from person to person primarily by airborne respi-
ratory droplets released during sneezing and
coughing.

Influenza Epidemics and Pandemics
Inﬂuenza epidemics encountered are two types:
inﬂuenza epidemics every year caused by inﬂu-
enza A and B viruses. The rare, severe inﬂuenza
pandemics are always caused by the type A virus.
Antigenic Shift
Antigenic shift is the process by which a major
change occurs either in one or both of the surface
antigens. This change forms an antigen that
shows no relationship serologically with the anti-
gen of the strains present at that time. An anti-
genic shift has been demonstrated in type A
inﬂuenza virus only.
Inﬂuenza A pandemics are caused by the virus
strains undergoing an antigenic shift. Antigenic
shift variants appear less frequently, about every
10 or 11 years. It is demonstrated that pandemic
strains are the recombinant strains that originated
from some animal or bird reservoir, either spread-
ing to humans directly by host range mutation or
as a result of a recombination between human and
non-human strains. The pandemic strains also
show the capability to spread rapidly amongst
the population.
The entirely new antigens that emerge during
the antigenic shift are accomplished by genetic
re-assortment. An animal inﬂuenza virus appar-
ently becomes the donor of the novel antigens
formed. Type A viruses are explored in animals

such as pigs, horses and birds, and inﬂuenza
viruses affecting animals possess antigens closely
similar to human viruses. Fourteen different HA
and nine NA antigens are recognised. Due to
advancing
surveillance
of
animal
inﬂuenza
viruses in late years, the discoveries of new
antigens have not been successful. This represents
the entire variety of major inﬂuenza virus surface
antigens, which can be grouped into many
subtypes.
Influenza Viruses
807
Antigenic Drift
On the other hand, repeated minor antigenic
changes generate strains that retain a degree of
serologic
relationship
with
the
currently
prevailing strain. This is called antigenic drift.
The epidemics are caused by the inﬂuenza A
virus undergoing antigenic variations due to anti-
genic
drift
resulting
from
mutations
and
selections. Antigenic drift variants occur very
frequently, virtually every year. When individuals
are
again
infected
with
drift
viruses,
the
antibodies present in serum respond to the surface
antigens common to earlier strains, of which the
person who had been exposed before are gener-
ally stronger and are of greater avidity than those
reactions to the new antigens. This process, called
‘original antigenic sin’, is now consistently used
in serological diagnosis.
Avian Influenza (H5N1 Bird Flu)
The H5N1 ﬂu, caused by an avian subtype inﬂu-
enza virus, which has been associated with bird
ﬂu in domesticated birds, can be transmitted from
birds to humans. The H5N1 was ﬁrst described in
Hong Kong in 1997. Human infections caused by
this virus were established in only 18 individuals,
of which six died.
An
epidemic
of
bird
ﬂu
occurred
in
domesticated birds in Southeast Asia, primarily
Vietnam, in January 2004. More than 240 human
cases have been documented, and more than
140 persons have died due to the poultry
outbreaks and bird-to-human transmission. Most
deaths have been reported in Vietnam and
Indonesia. Sporadic outbreaks have continued to
occur since the 2004 outbreak, even outside
Southeast Asia, including Turkey. Thousands of
birds died due to H5N1 in 14 states and Union
territories of India during 2020–2021. Till now,
no conclusive evidence is available to show the
human-to-human transmission of H5N1.
H1N1 (Swine Flu)
A novel H1N1 swine-origin inﬂuenza virus
(SOIV) H1N1 emerged in 2009 to produce the
ﬁrst human inﬂuenza pandemic of the twenty-ﬁrst
century. This virus spread to 214 countries within
1 year and caused more than 18,000 conﬁrmed
deaths worldwide. First described in April 2009,
the novel SOIV emerged due to a ‘triple
re-assortment’ of inﬂuenza viruses of avian,
swine and human origin. This led to the popular
term ‘swine ﬂu’ being used for this virus.
The pandemic H1N1 in 2009 virus contained
i) PA and PB2 segments originated from avian
viruses of North American origin; ii) the PB1
segment
from
human
H3N2
viruses;
iii)
haemagglutinin (HA; of the H1 subtype), the
neuraminidase (NA; of the N1 subtype), NS
segments and NP evolved from classical swine
H1N1 viruses and iv) M segments from Eurasian
‘avian-like’
swine
viruses.
Unlike
previous
strains of the inﬂuenza virus, the novel SOIV
did not have a predilection for populations more
than 60 years of age. Rather, a greater number of
younger people less than 40 years of age were
found to be affected. A small percentage of those
affected were found to have developed pneumo-
nia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The
number of cases decreased greatly by May 2010,
and the pandemic was ofﬁcially declared to be at
an end in August 2010. For diagnosis of H1N1
inﬂuenza, testing of samples like nasopharyngeal
swabs or oropharyngeal swabs is essential. Real-
time RT-PCR for viral nucleic acid is the
recommended method for its diagnosis, and
other rapid tests like antigen detection were not
found to be useful.
The treatment for severe cases of H1N1 inﬂu-
enza is the NA inhibitor, oseltamivir. Two types
of inﬂuenza vaccines have been developed
against H1N1 inﬂuenza—a trivalent inactivated
vaccine and a live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine,
which can be administered intranasally.

808

Orthomyxoviruses
Prevention and Control
This is based on immunoprophylaxis by vaccines
and chemoprophylaxis.
Immunoprophylaxis by Influenza Vaccines
Inﬂuenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are the
most
common
prevailing
human
inﬂuenza
viruses. The trivalent vaccine used worldwide
contains inﬂuenza A strains from H1N1 and
H3N2, along with an inﬂuenza B strain. Inﬂuenza
virus vaccines have been used for about 40 years
to prevent inﬂuenza, primarily inﬂuenza A and B.
Inactivated Influenza Vaccines
These vaccines were used Initially. The viruses
grown for these vaccines are cultivated in chick
embryos which are inactivated by formalin
puriﬁed to some extent and altered to a dosage
noted to evoke a response by an antibody in the
majority of individuals. The vaccines contain the
strains of types A and B viruses that are believed
most likely to produce epidemics during the fol-
lowing winter. Local and systemic reactions to
the vaccine are minor and occur in the ﬁrst day
or two after vaccination.
Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccines
Live vaccines are now being developed as
alternatives
to
inactivated
vaccines.
These
vaccines induce the production of speciﬁc secre-
tory antibodies in the respiratory mucosa.
These vaccines are developed by considering
the naturally occurring mutations in the inﬂuenza
virus genome that result in less-virulent strains.
Live vaccines can also be developed by manual
passage of a parental inﬂuenza virus multiple
times in virus-susceptible cells so that inﬂuenza
vaccine strains with low virulence and pathoge-
nicity are generated. Live inﬂuenza vaccines
mainly consist of those for inﬂuenza A(H1N1),
A(H3N2) subtype, and Victoria strains of inﬂu-
enza B virus. Intranasal inoculation of live
vaccines
could
induce
mucosal
immunity,
humoral immunity, and cellular immunity. Few
live vaccines like Quadrivalent one have proven
effective for children 2–17 years old. Recently,
temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant strains have
been
used
in
the
live
attenuated
vaccine
preparations. These avirulent mutants can grow
at 32–34 C in the nasopharyngeal secretions but
not at 37 C in the lungs. These vaccines are
useful to protect children from clinical disease.
However, concerns regarding host replication
and possible mutations remain with these live
vaccines.
Indications for the live inﬂuenza vaccine
Internationally, as per recommendations, two
types, namely injectable and intranasal inﬂuenza
vaccines, are available. Injectable vaccines pro-
tect by producing antibodies only, while the
intranasal vaccine offers protection at the local
level of mucosal immunity (the nasal tract) and by
producing antibodies. It has been proven that the
clinical efﬁcacy of an intranasal vaccine is supe-
rior to that of an injectable vaccine. Based on
epidemiological evidence from the WHO and
Indian Council of Medical Research, the Govern-
ment of India recommends vaccination of ‘High-
Risk Groups’ with Seasonal Inﬂuenza Vaccine.
The high-risk groups comprise the healthcare per-
sonnel, persons with comorbidities, the elderly,
etc. ICMR recommends egg-based quadrivalent
vaccines for use in the 2020–2021 northern hemi-
sphere inﬂuenza season. The composition of this
vaccine is as follows:
(a)
an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019
(H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
(b)
an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like
virus;
(c)
a
B/Washington/02/2019
(B/Victoria
lineage)-like a virus; and
(d)
a
B/Phuket/3073/2013
(B/Yamagata
lineage)-like a virus.
Recombinant Vaccines
These are now being evaluated in inﬂuenza.
Recombinant strains used in the vaccine are pro-
duced by hybridisation between the ts mutants
and new antigenic variants of the strains. These
strains carry the surface antigens of the new
variants
and

Subunit Vaccines
Subunit vaccines against inﬂuenza viruses are
mostly under development. Some, including
H5N1 and H7N9, are under development. M2e,
HA and NP are attractive vaccine targets,
amongst other viral structural proteins. Proteins
such as M1 and NA also have the potential for
development as inﬂuenza subunit vaccines.
Table 56.8 summarises vaccines available
against the inﬂuenza virus.
Chemoprophylaxis
Chemoprophylaxis
by
amantadine
and
rimantadine hydrochloride is more successful.
These two drugs effectively prevent infection
and illness caused by type A, but not by type B
viruses (because they lack M2 components). The
persons with high-risk can be protected by
administering a dosage of 100 mg/day. When
administered for 10 days to household contacts
of a person with inﬂuenza, these drugs protect up
to 80% of the person from illness.

birds
in
Maharashtra
(India)
during
2006.

Paramyxoviruses
57
Paramyxoviruses are roughly spherical-shaped
viruses and usually vary in size from 100 to
300 nm. Sometimes, long ﬁlaments and giant
forms of the virus measuring up to 800 nm are
also found. These viruses consist of a negative-
sense single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a
helical nucleocapsid surrounded by a pleomor-
phic envelope. They resemble orthomyxoviruses
in morphology but are larger, surface spikes are
different, and their genomes are not segmented.
Hence unlike the Orthomyxoviruses, there is no
re-assortment, no antigenic shift or antigenic drift
is seen in Paramyxoviruses.
Classification
The family Paramyxoviridae consists of four
genera
(Rubulavirus,
Morbillivirus,
Parainﬂuenza virus and Pneumovirus). All these
genera
contain
important
human
pathogens
responsible for causing most acute respiratory
infections and contagious diseases of children
and infants. The genus Rubulavirus includes
mumps
virus,
and
the
genus
Morbillivirus
includes
the
measles
virus,
the
genus
Parainﬂuenza virus includes parainﬂuenza types
1–4 genus Pneumovirus includes respiratory syn-
cytial virus (RSV), which is responsible for the
majority of acute respiratory infections in infants
and children.

Antigenic Structure
The nucleocapsid is associated with the nucleo-
protein (NP), polymerase phosphoprotein (P) and
larger (L) protein. The NP maintains the genomic
structure, the P facilitates RNA synthesis, and the
L protein is an RNA polymerase. The envelope
surrounds the nucleocapsid. The virion envelope
contains
two
glycoproteins,
(1)
a
fusion
(F) protein and (2) a viral attachment protein
called
haemagglutinin
neuraminidase
(HN),
haemagglutinin (H) or G protein.
F protein facilitates fusion of the viral and host
cell membranes, and HN promotes adsorption of
the virus to the host cell surface. The binding of
the HN, H or G protein on the virion envelope to
these cell surface glycoproteins containing sialic
acid is the ﬁrst step in the replication of
paramyxoviruses. This is followed by the fusion
of the viral envelope with the cell’s plasma mem-
brane, promoted by the F protein of the virion
envelope.
In
addition,
paramyxovirus
also
induces cell-to-cell fusion, resulting in the pro-
duction
of
multinucleated
giant
cells.
Paramyxoviruses associated with human diseases
are summarised in Table 57.1.
Measles Virus (Rubeola)
Measles or Rubeola is a highly communicable
acute viral disease characterised by fever, con-
junctivitis and pathognomonic Koplik spots. It is

one of the ﬁve classic exanthematous diseases of
childhood, others being chickenpox, rubella,
roseola and ﬁfth disease.

Morphology
Measles virus is spherical but is often pleomor-
phic, measuring 120–250 nm in diameter. It
contains a negative-sense RNA genome. The
helical nucleocapsid is surrounded by an enve-
lope carrying H and F proteins on its surface. The
virus
causes
haemagglutination
of
monkey
erythrocytes, but it is not followed by elution as
the virus does not has any neuraminidase activity.
Virus Replication
Measles virus replicates in the cell cytoplasm.
The virus ﬁrst adsorbs the cell surface by its
haemagglutinin, then enters the cell and uncoats
inside the cell’s cytoplasm. The viral RNA poly-
merase transcribes the negative-strand genome
into mRNA. Multiple copies of mRNAs are pro-
duced, each of which is translated into speciﬁc
viral proteins. This is followed by nucleocapsid
assembly, and the virus is released by budding
from the cell membrane.
Antigenic and Other Properties
The measles virus has only one serotype and
infects only humans, not other mammals. The
virus is antigenically uniform; it shares antigens
with the canine distemper virus. The measles
virus is heat-labile. It is readily inactivated by
ether, formaldehyde, high temperature and ultra-
violet light. The virus is stabilised by molar
MgSO4, following which the virus resists heating
at 50 C for 1 h.
Laboratory Isolation
The measles virus is very difﬁcult to grow,
although it can be grown in primary human or
monkey kidney cell cultures. The isolates can be
adapted for growth on HeLa or Vero cell lines.
Pathogenesis of Measles
Measles is highly contagious and is spread from
person-to-person by aerosols. The infection is
transmitted from person-to-person by inhalation
of
large
droplet
aerosols
produced
during
coughing and sneezing.
Measles virus enters the susceptible host by
the respiratory route. The virus initiates infection

and replicates locally in the respiratory tract’s
trachea and bronchial epithelial cells. After
2–4 days, the virus spreads systemically in
lymphocytes, perhaps carried by pulmonary
macrophages, and causes viremia. Wide dissemi-
nation of the virus causes infection of the con-
junctiva, respiratory tract, urinary tract, lymphatic
system, blood vessels and the central nervous
system (CNS). The characteristic rash in measles
is caused primarily by cytotoxic T cells attacking
the measles virus-infected epithelial cells in
the skin.
Measles Virus (Rubeola)
813
Encephalitis is one of the most important
sequelae of the infection caused by measles. The
virus causes (1) encephalitis by direct infection of
the neurons; (2) immune-mediated conditions,
such as post-infectious measles encephalopathy,
believed to be immune-mediated, and (3) subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) caused by an
infective mutant of measles, produced during the
acute stage of the disease.
Measles
causes
immunosuppression,
characterised by a decrease in eosinophils and
lymphocytes (both B and T cells) and depression
of their response to activation by mitogens.
Immunosuppression caused by measles in the
infected individuals may predispose individuals
to bronchopneumonia, severe bacterial infection
and a major cause of measles-related mortality
among young children.
Immunity
Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays an impor-
tant role in controlling measles infection. There-
fore, the measles virus in individuals with a
deﬁciency in cellular immunity causes progres-
sive and often fatal giant cell pneumonia without
a rash. The antibodies do not have any role in
conferring protection against the measles virus
because the viruses spread from cell-to-cell.
However, maternal antibodies in infants protect
against measles during the ﬁrst 6 months of life.
Nevertheless, one attack of measles confers life-
long immunity.
Clinical Syndromes
Measles virus is associated with measles, atypical
measles and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
Measles
The incubation period varies from 8 to 12 days.
Measles is a highly contagious febrile illness. The
prodromal phase is characterised by high fever,
malaise,
anorexia,
conjunctivitis, cough
and
coryza. Koplik spot is the typical pathogenic
lesion found in the mucous membrane.
Koplik spots are bluish-grey specks or grain
substances on a red base, usually appearing on the
buccal mucosa opposite the second molar. They
appear at the end of pro-drome, just before the
appearance of the rash. These Koplik spots may
also appear on the mucous membrane of the con-
junctiva and vagina. Koplik spots usually appear
after 2 days of illness. These spots, which last for
24–48 h, are pathognomonic of measles.
An erythematous maculopapular rash appears
within 12–24 h of the appearance of the Koplik
spots. The rash usually begins on the face, then
spreads extensively and appears on the trunk,
extremities, palms and soles and lasts for about
5 days. Desquamation of the rashes except those
of palms and soles may occur after 1 week.
Patients appear highly sick during the ﬁrst or
second day of the appearance of the rash. The
rash
is
typically
absent
in
patients
with
defective CMI.
Complications
of
measles
include
otitis
media,
bronchopneumonia,
laryngotracheo-
bronchitis (croup) and diarrhoea. Bronchopneu-
monia is a most serious condition and is
responsible for 60% of deaths caused by the mea-
sles virus. Encephalitis is one of the most danger-
ous complications.
Atypical Measles
The condition is characterised by prolonged high
fever, pneumonitis and rash. The rash character-
istically begins peripherally and may be urticarial,
maculopapular, haemorrhagic or vesicular. The
condition appears to be immune-mediated and to


occur due to hypersensitivity to the measles virus
in a partially immune host.
814
57
Paramyxoviruses
Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis
(SSPE)
The SSPE is a degenerating disease of the CNS
caused by persistent measles infection. It is the
most serious and late neurological sequelae of
measles that affects the CNS. The disease is
characterised by behavioural and intellectual
deterioration and seizures after many years
(mean incubation period is 10.8 years) of infec-
tion by measles. The condition occurs in about
seven in every one million patients. The condition
occurs most commonly in children initially
affected when they were younger than 2 years.
The condition is associated with the presence of
an extremely high measles antibody titre in the
blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).
Laboratory Diagnosis
The clinical manifestations of typical measles
cases are so characteristic that the diagnosis is
self-evident. The laboratory diagnosis is fre-
quently helpful in diagnosing atypical measles
and differentiating from rubella.
Fig. 57.1 Multi-nucleated
giant cells of measles in
Giemsa-stained smears
( 1000)
Specimens
Respiratory specimens, conjunctival specimens,
urine, blood and brain tissues are the frequently
used specimens. The respiratory specimens and
blood collected during the prodromal stage and
the period following until 2 days after the appear-
ance of the rash are the specimens of choice for
isolation of viruses by culture.
Microscopy
Demonstration of multinucleated giant cells, mea-
suring up to 100 nm in diameter, in Giemsa-
stained
smears
is
diagnostic
of
measles
(Fig. 57.1) in biopsies of Koplik spots, nasal
secretion smears and dermal rashes.
Direct Antigen Detection
A direct immunoﬂuorescence antibody test can
detect measles antigen in nasal secretions, pha-
ryngeal secretions or urinary sediments.
Cell Culture
The measles virus is difﬁcult to isolate, but it can
be grown in primary human or monkey kidney
cell cultures. The virus produces cytopathic
effects (CPEs), the characteristic multinucleated
giant cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusion
bodies
very
slowly,
usually
1
week
after

inoculation. Warthin–Finkeldey cells are pro-
duced by the measles virus in the lymphoid tissue
of the patients.
Measles Virus (Rubeola)
815
However, the viral antigen appearing in the
infected cell cultures can be detected much earlier
using a direct immunoﬂuorescence antibody test.
Serology
Sandwich capture IgM enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (IgM ELISA) is the quickest
method to diagnose acute measles by detecting
IgM antibodies in the serum. The IgM antibodies
begin to appear in the serum on the third day after
the appearance of the rash and remain positive
30–60 days after an illness in most individuals
suffering from measles. The test is therefore posi-
tive during these days. IgM ELISA is highly
sensitive (nearly 100%) during this period of
illness.
Demonstration of more than a fourfold rise in
IgG antibody titre between acute and convales-
cent sera conﬁrms the diagnosis of measles. IgG
antibodies usually appear 4 days after the onset of
rash and persist for a longer period even after the
patient has been cured of the illness. Demonstra-
tion of unusually high titre of measles antibody in
the serum and CSF is diagnostic of SSPE.
Molecular Detection
Reverse transcriptase PCR is used as a diagnostic
method because of its speciﬁcity and sensitivity.
Treatment
Ribavirin given either intravenous or in aerosol
form is being now evaluated to treat severely
affected
adults
and
immunocompromised
individuals with acute measles or SSPE. The
measles virus has been shown to be susceptible
to ribavirin in vitro. However, the drug is yet to be
used for regular treatment of measles cases since
no controlled trials have been conducted to test
the efﬁcacy of the drug in patients with measles.
Epidemiology
Measles is a disease reported throughout the
world. A considerable number of people succumb
to the infection globally each year. However,
widespread vaccination has resulted in a decrease
in mortality due to measles. The decrease has
been as high as 73% in a span of nearly
18 years. The WHO has remarkably endeavoured
to increase the vaccination coverage of the mea-
sles vaccine to a targeted 90% population in every
nation. In 2018, about 86% of the world’s chil-
dren had received one dose of measles vaccine by
the age of 1 year through routine health services,
which has been a great achievement towards con-
tainment of the disease. Despite, breakthrough
infections and outbreaks occur due to unregulated
movement of the unvaccinated people, thus caus-
ing failure in efforts towards control.
Geographical Distribution
Epidemics of measles occur every 2–3 years.
Approximately 30 million measles cases are
reported annually, most cases being from Africa.
The condition has also been well documented in
America, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean
region,
the
Western
Paciﬁc
region
and
Southeast Asia.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Measles is exclusively human disease. Infected
respiratory droplets are the primary source of
infection. Patients are infectious from 3 days
before
the
onset
of
illness
until
the
rash
desquamates. Infectivity is maximum at the
pro-drome and diminishes rapidly with the onset
of the rash. Children with immunodeﬁciency due
to leukaemia, corticosteroid therapy, or HIV are
at increased risk for infection regardless of their
immunisation status. Unvaccinated people are
also at-risk.

816
57
Paramyxoviruses
Prevention and Control
Measles vaccine, along with mumps and rubella
(MMR) vaccine, is currently used for universal
immunisation of children.
Measles Vaccine
It is a live attenuated vaccine, which now uses
Schwartz and Moraten attenuated strain of the
original Edmonston B strain. The ﬁrst dose of
vaccine is given to children older than 12 months
in the United States but are used for children aged
9 months in developing countries like India with
high endemicity. The second vaccine dose is usu-
ally
given
to
school-going
children
aged
4–6 years. Immunisation with two vaccine doses
has shown a seroconversion of 99% after 1 year.
In India, under the Universal Immunisation
Programmes, the ﬁrst dose of measles vaccina-
tion is given as Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine
at 9–12 months of age and second dose at 16–-
24 months of age. If given alone, the measles
vaccine is the ﬁrst dose at 9 months of age
followed by a second dose as MMR (measles
mumps rubella) vaccine at 12–15 months.
The CDC recommends two doses of MMR
vaccine to protect against measles, mumps, and
rubella. The ﬁrst dose is at 12 to 15 months of age,
and the second dose is at 4 to 6 years of age.
Adults should also be up to date on their MMR
vaccination. The two doses of the MMR vaccine
should be separated by at least 28 days. It is
usually said that one dose of MMR vaccine is
93% effective against measles, 78% effective
against
mumps,
and
97%
effective
against
rubella, while both the doses of MMR vaccine
are 97% effective against measles and 88% effec-
tive against mumps. MMR is a live attenuated
vaccine
causing
harmless
infection
in
the
vaccinated person.
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
It is carried out by serum human gamma globulin
if administered within 6 days of exposure to mea-
sles, which may prevent or attenuate the disease.
This is of immense value in children with immu-
nodeﬁciency, pregnant women and others at
increased risk of measles.
To eliminate measles, the WHO has laid down
several regional elimination goals based on the
occurrence of the disease. Amongst the major
goals, achievement and sustenance of very high
vaccination coverage (95%) with two doses of
measles, supplementing additional coverage for
the at-risk population and strengthening the sur-
veillance system are the prominent ones.
India
has
performed
extremely
well
in
controlling measles cases and reducing the bur-
den through effective vaccination. In collabora-
tion with ten other WHO South-East Asia Region
member countries, India has resolved to eliminate
measles. Recently, the Rubella vaccine has been
introduced
in
the
universal
immunisation
programme (UIP) as the Measles-Rubella vac-
cine. To meet the aim of eradication, several
strategies
such
as
strengthening
of
routine
immunisation services for all vaccines under
UIP, including the ﬁrst dose of measles vaccine
at appropriate ages, providing a second opportu-
nity of receiving a measles vaccine to children
who may have missed the ﬁrst dose have added to
the population immunisation coverage.
Parainfluenza Virus
Parainﬂuenza are the pathogens that primarily
affect young children, in whom the viruses
cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
The nomenclature and taxonomic relationship of
HPIVs have changed considerably over the last
decade. There are four types of parainﬂuenza
viruses, Type 1,2,3 and 4.
Morphology
Parainﬂuenza viruses are pleomorphic viruses
measuring 150–200 nm in diameter. The virus
contains
a
single-stranded,
non-segmented,
negative-sense RNA genome with nucleoproteins
P and L. It is surrounded by a helical nucleocapsid,

which contains glycoprotein spikes. The surface
spikes consist of H, N (neuraminidase) and F
proteins. Both H and N proteins are present on
the same spike, whereas the F protein is present on
a separate spike. The F protein mediates the for-
mation of the multinucleated giant cell.
Parainfluenza Virus
817
Laboratory Isolation
HPI’s grow in primary monkey kidney (PMK)
cells (Rhesus and African green monkeys). The
virus also grows in continuous monkey kidney
cell lines (LLC-MK2), which is excellent for
continuous passage and almost as good as PMK
cells for primary isolation.
Pathogenesis of Human Parainfluenza
Virus Infection
Human parainﬂuenza virus infection is acquired
by inhaling respiratory droplets or by direct
person-to-person contact with infected secretions.
The virus is site-speciﬁc, and infection is conﬁned
to the respiratory tract. Respiratory epithelium
appears to be the important site of virus binding
and subsequent infections.
The virus adsorbs to the respiratory epithelial
cells by speciﬁcally combining with neuraminic
acid
receptors
in
the
cell
through
its
haemagglutinin. Subsequently, the virus enters
the cells following fusion with the cell membrane,
mediated by F1 and F2 receptors. The virus
replicates more rapidly than mumps and measles
viruses in the cell cytoplasm and causes the for-
mation of multinucleated giant cells. These giant
cells, each containing two to seven nuclei, usually
develop late in the infection. The virus also
causes the formation of single and multi-locular
cytoplasmic vacuoles and basophilic or eosino-
philic inclusions. The virus causes inﬂammation
of the respiratory tract, leading to secretions of
high levels of inﬂammatory cytokines, usually
7–10 days after initial exposure.
Immunity
Humoral immunity plays a major role in defence
against HPIVs. The antibodies are produced
against both surface glycoproteins (HN and F)
of the virus. Neutralising antibodies to all types
of viruses are seen in most children at the time of
birth, but the titre falls rapidly after 6 months.
Most children and adults develop a detectable
level of neutralising antibodies in the serum fol-
lowing natural infection with the virus. Secretory
IgA antibodies also appear to play an important
role. The CMI appears to play some role in
containing the disease, as HPIV infection tends
to be more severe in persons with defective CMI.
Immunity
to
HPIV
is
long-lasting,
but
re-infection may occur many times throughout
life, most probably due to the presence of multi-
ple serotypes of HPIV.
Clinical Syndromes
The human parainﬂuenza virus causes croup,
pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and other infections.
Croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is a het-
erogeneous group of illnesses that affects the
larynx, trachea and bronchi. It is a type of com-
mon cold disease that manifests as fever, cough,
laryngeal obstruction and expiratory stridor.
Human
parainﬂuenza
pneumonia
is
characterised by fever, rales and evidence of pul-
monary consolidation. All types of HPIVs cause
bronchiolitis. Most cases of bronchiolitis occur in
infants. The condition manifests as fever, expira-
tory wheezing, tachypnoea and rales. Other
infections include otitis media, pharyngitis, con-
junctivitis, and coryza are the other infections
caused by the virus.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal
aspirations, nasal washings and nasal aspirations.

818
57
Paramyxoviruses
Direct Antigen Detection
ELISA, immunoﬂuorescence assay and ﬂuor
immunoassays are used to detect HPIV antigen
directly in urine specimens. These methods are
sensitive and speciﬁc. Shell viral assay is a sensi-
tive method for rapid demonstration of the virus.
Cell Culture
The virus can be isolated from clinical specimens
by culture in PMK and LLC-MK2 cell lines. The
CPEs are rarely demonstrated during primary iso-
lation of the virus in tissue culture. The virus
causes the formation of syncytium in the infected
cells. Hemadsorptions inhibition using guinea pig
erythrocytes is also used to detect virus antigen in
cell lines within 3–10 days of incubation.
Serology
Haemagglutination
inhibition,
neutralisation,
ELISA and Western blot are frequently used
antibody-based serological tests for diagnosis. A
fourfold rise in antibody titre of acute and conva-
lescent sera is diagnostic of acute infection.
Molecular Detection
A multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed for
simultaneous detection of the viral genome in
clinical specimens.
Treatment
Ribavirin has been shown to be effective against
HPIV infection in vitro. Uses of ribavirin aerosols
or systemic therapy to treat HPIV infection in
children and adults who are severely immuno-
compromised have shown mixed results with
uncertain clinical beneﬁts.
Epidemiology
The human parainﬂuenza virus is ubiquitous and
has worldwide distribution. Parainﬂuenza viruses
cause disease exclusively in humans. No animal
reservoirs are present. Respiratory secretions
from infected humans are the source of infection.
Prevention and Control
Live attenuated vaccine is available. Field trials of
formalin-killed whole HPIV have proved to be
ineffective in children. These vaccines failed to
protect
against
natural
infection
by
the
parainﬂuenza virus.
Newcastle Disease Virus
Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is a poultry path-
ogen that causes severe outbreaks of pneumoen-
cephaltis or inﬂuenza, resulting in high death
rates. It is known Ranikhet virus in India. Suitable
vaccination and slaughtering of the infected birds
are the control measures. Poultry workers and
others in contact with infected birds become
subjugated to self-limited conjunctivitis.
Mumps Virus
Mumps is an acute infectious disease of children,
characterised by acute, non-suppurative, painful
swelling of the salivary glands.
Morphology
Mumps
virus
is
a
typical
paramyxovirus
containing
a
single-stranded,
negative-sense
RNA surrounded by an envelope. It has two
major surface glycoproteins: (1) one with both
haemagglutinin and neuraminidase and (2) the
other
with
cell
fusion
protein
(F).
The
haemagglutinin agglutinates the RBCs of fowl,
guinea pigs, humans and many other species.
The haemagglutination is followed by haemolysis
and elution at 37 C. The F protein is responsible
for the fusion of the lipid membrane of the virus
to the host cell.


Mumps Virus
819
Antigenic and Other Properties
Only one antigenic type of mumps virus is
known. Neutralising antibodies are produced
against haemagglutinin. It has an internal nucleo-
capsid soluble (S) antigen, which is detected by
the complement ﬁxation test.
The mumps virus is heat-labile. It is sensitive
to heat and rapidly inactivated at room tempera-
ture. Treatment with formaldehyde, ether or ultra-
violet light also inactivates the virus. The virus
can be stored for a longer period by lyophilisation
at
70 C.
Laboratory Isolation
Chick Embryo
The virus grows well in the amniotic cavity of 6-
to the 8-day-old embryonated egg.
Tissue Culture
Mumps virus grows well in PMK cells, Hep-2
cells and H292 cells. The CPE consists of multi-
nucleated giant cells and acidophilic cytoplasmic
inclusions. The growth of the virus in the cells can
be detected by direct immunoﬂuorescence and
hemadsorptions.

Pathogenesis of Mumps
The infection is acquired from an infected person
by direct person-to-person contact and inhalation
of respiratory droplets. Infection by mumps virus
begins after the entry of the virus into the respira-
tory tract. The virus then replicates locally and
disseminates by the blood circulation to target
tissues, such as the CNS and salivary glands,
particularly the parotid glands. The virus causes
infection of the parotid gland either through the
Stensen duct or by viremia. Salivary glands, such
as parotid glands, show desquamation of necrotic
epithelial cells lining the ducts.
The virus replicates in these target tissues and
then causes a secondary viremia phase. The virus
is spread by viremia throughout the body to
kidneys, testes, ovary, pancreas and other organs.
Infection of the CNS, especially meninges, causes
meningitis, or meningoencephalitis (Fig. 57.2).

Paramyxoviruses
Immunity
Humoral immunity is characterised by the appear-
ance of antibodies against the soluble S antigen
and haemagglutinating antibodies. The antibody
against S antigen is the ﬁrst to appear within
3–7 days after the onset of symptoms. The
haemagglutinating antibodies directed against
haemagglutinin confer lifelong immunity against
the mumps virus. CMI is essential for the control
of infection. This also contributes to the patho-
genesis of the disease and is responsible partially
for the symptoms observed during the course of
clinical illness. Immunity in mumps is lifelong.
Clinical Syndromes
Mumps virus causes mumps.
Mumps
The incubation period is long and varies from
12 to 25 days. Most of the infections are asymp-
tomatic. The onset of mumps is sudden. Fever,
headache and earache are the initial symptoms.
These
symptoms
are
followed
by
painful
swelling of the parotid gland. Initially, it may
be unilateral but may become bilateral later. The
condition is accompanied by fever, local pain and
tenderness. Epididymo-orchitis is the second
most common manifestation in adults, usually
preceded by parotitis. Orchitis may occasionally
cause testicular atrophy and sterility.
Complications of mumps include meningo-
encephalitis, the most frequent complication of
mumps in childhood. Other rare complications
include oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, thyroid-
itis, arteritis, thrombocytopenia and pneumonia.
Death due to mumps is rare.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis of mumps is usually clinical. The labo-
ratory diagnosis is useful for diagnosing atypical
infection or manifestation of mumps without typ-
ical symptoms.
Specimens
The
specimens
include
the
saliva,
urine,
secretions from the Stensen duct and the CSF.
The virus is present in the saliva for 4–5 days,
in the CSF for 8–9 days and the urine for 15 days
after the onset of the symptoms.
Chick Embryo
Chick embryo inoculation is a less sensitive
method than the cell culture. The viruses can be
detected in the amniotic ﬂuid after inoculating 6-
to 8-day-old embryonated eggs. The virus is
identiﬁed in amniotic ﬂuid 5–6 days of incubation
at 35 C for haemagglutinins by haemagglutinin
inhibition assay using speciﬁc antisera.
Cell Culture
Mumps virus can be isolated from clinical
specimens by inoculation into monkey kidney
cells, human amnion cells or HeLa cells. The
growth of the virus in monkey kidney cells is
detected by the presence of multinucleated giant
cells. The CPE may take as long as 1–2 weeks to
appear. Virus growth in the cells can be detected
much earlier by haemadsorption of guinea pig
erythrocytes adsorbing the surface of virus-
infected cells. The immunoﬂuorescence test is
also a very rapid test used to detect viral antigen
in the infected cells as early as 2–3 days after
inoculation.
Serology
The haemagglutinin inhibition, immunoﬂuores-
cence assay and ELISA are used to demonstrate
viral antibodies in the serum. Detection of
mumps-speciﬁc IgM antibodies by IgM ELISA
indicates recent and active infection. A fourfold
increase between acute and convalescent phases
in serum IgM antibody levels conﬁrms the diag-
nosis of mumps.
Molecular Detection
RT-PCR is a very sensitive and speciﬁc test for
identifying mumps virus in clinical specimens.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
821
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral agents are available against
mumps.
Epidemiology
Mumps is a highly communicable disease occur-
ring worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Mumps continues to remain endemic in many
countries throughout the world, as the mumps
vaccine is used in only 57% of the countries. In
the absence of a vaccination program, it often
occurs as epidemics in children 5–15 years of age.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are the only natural hosts of the mumps
virus. The infected patients are the source of
infection. A patient remains infectious usually
from 9 days prior to the onset of parotid swelling
as long as 7 days after onset of the swelling.
Unvaccinated and immunocompromised people
are at more risk of infection by the mumps virus.
Prevention and Control
Achieving and maintaining high immunisation
levels, primarily in infants and young children,
is the principal strategy to prevent mumps.
Vaccines
An effective live attenuated vaccine is available
against mumps. The vaccine consists of the
Jeryl–Lynn strain of mumps virus attenuated
by serial passage in eggs and chick ﬁbroblasts.
The vaccine confers 95% protection, which lasts
for 12 years. The vaccine is recommended for
children of both sexes at 12 months of age. The
vaccine can be given to
all asymptomatic
HIV-infected children at the same age. It is
given as a part of the MMR vaccine. The vaccine
is contraindicated in pregnancy and patients with
severe febrile illness. A quadrivalent MMRV vac-
cine effective at preventing measles, mumps,
rubella,
and
varicella
has
also
been
recommended. The ﬁrst dose of this vaccine is
advocated at 12–15 months, followed by the sec-
ond dose at 4–6 years. The second dose can be
given 3 months after the ﬁrst dose.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading
cause of respiratory tract infection in infants and
young children.
Morphology
RSV is pleomorphic and measures from 150 to
300 nm in size. It has a small nucleocapsid, mea-
suring 13 nm in diameter, unlike large nucleocap-
sid (18 nm) of other paramyxoviruses. The viral
envelope contains a surface glycoprotein G, by
which it is attached to the cell surface of the host
cells. It contains F protein but lacks both H and N
proteins. The F protein induces the fusion of the
infected cells with adjoining cells, resulting in the
formation of large multinucleated syncytia, from
which the virus derives its name.
Antigenic and Other Properties
The virus is antigenically stable. It has only one
antigenic serotype with the subtypes A and
B. Subtype A appears to be more virulent than
subtype B. The virus is highly labile; it is easily
inactivated by dryness at room temperature and
by acid. It is preserved by lyophilisation.
Laboratory Isolation
RSV is difﬁcult to grow in tissue culture in PMK
or human cell (HeLa cells, Hep-2) lines. The
formation of large multinucleated syncytia is the
characteristic CPE produced by the virus, but
slowly in 2–10 days.

822
57
Paramyxoviruses
Pathogenesis of Respiratory Syncytial
Virus Infection
RSV infection is acquired usually by inhalation of
large droplet aerosols, coughed out by the patient
during the act of coughing or sneezing. It is also
acquired by direct contact with contaminated
hands and fomites. The infection is restricted to
the respiratory tract.
The virus initiates infection in the epithelial
cells of the upper respiratory tract. Spread of the
virus down the respiratory tract occurs by the cell-
to-cell transfer of the virus along the syncytia
from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respi-
ratory tract, resulting in pneumonia. The virus
usually does not cause any viremia or systemic
spread. The virus causes necrosis of the small
airway epithelium, plugging of the lumens with
exudates and oedema, leading to obstruction of
the normal airways of the young infants. The
host’s immune response plays a major role in
the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis observed during
illness.
Humoral antibody plays a minimal role in the
host immunity against RSV. Maternal antibodies
do not protect the infant from infection. CMI
appears to play an important role in recovery
from infection. Natural infection by RSV does
not prevent re-infection by the virus.
Clinical Syndromes
RSV primarily causes infection of the respiratory
tract,
ranging
from
the
common
cold
to
pneumonia.
Common Cold
The illness begins with the upper respiratory tract
infection, which manifests as a common cold with
marked rhinorrhoea (running nose). This condi-
tion is most common in older children and adults.
The incubation period varies from 4 to 5 days.
Bronchiolitis
RSV causes a more severe lower respiratory tract
illness in infants, resulting in bronchiolitis or
pneumonia. Clinically, the condition presents as
cough, coryza, wheezing, rales and low-grade
fever (<101 F). Bronchiolitis is usually self-
limiting but may cause serious disease in prema-
ture infants, immunocompromised hosts, and
individuals
with
underlying
lung
diseases.
Re-infection with the virus occurs throughout
life. However, with advancing age and recurrent
infection, the RSV infection is conﬁned more to
the upper respiratory tract than the lower respira-
tory tract.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include respiratory secretions obtained by
washing,
suctioning,
or
swabbing
the
nasopharynx.
Direct Antigen Detection
The viral antigens in the nasal washings or naso-
pharyngeal
aspirates
can
be
detected
using
ELISA or direct immunoﬂuorescence antibody
test using speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies.
Cell Culture
The virus can be isolated from clinical specimens
by inoculating HeLa cells, Hep-2 cells or monkey
kidney cells. After 2–10 days of incubation, RSV
is identiﬁed by the characteristic syncytium for-
mation in the cells. Direct immunoﬂuorescence
can also be used to detect viral antigens in
infected cells.
Serology
The ELISA is used for the demonstration of
antibodies in the serum. Demonstration of a four-
fold or more increase in the antibody titre of acute
and convalescent sera conﬁrms the diagnosis of
RSV infection. A commercial Dot-ELISA is
available for RSV detection in the aspirates.
Treatment
Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, has
been recommended for the aerosolised treatment

of children with severe RSV disease. This has
shown beneﬁcial effects by decreasing the dura-
tion of illness and decreasing the shedding of
viruses in respiratory secretions.
Hendra Virus
823
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
RSV infection is prevalent worldwide.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
RSV is highly contagious. Humans are the only
hosts. Infected patients are the source of infection.
They continue to excrete viruses for several days
or weeks in their respiratory secretions. The virus
is highly prevalent in young infants and children,
with a peak incidence in 2- to 8-month-old
infants. RSV infects virtually all children by the
age of 4 years. The viral infection is usually
seasonal and mostly occurs during winter. Noso-
comial infections caused by the virus are frequent
in nurseries and paediatric wards.
Prevention and Control
Passive immunisation with anti-RSV immuno-
globulin has proved beneﬁcial for prophylaxis in
high-risk infants such as premature babies or
babies with chronic lung disease. The anti-RSV
immunoglobulin is a pooled polyclonal human
immunoglobulin product with high titres of RSV
antibodies.
Attempts to use a vaccine against RSV have
been proved unsuccessful to date. Previously, a
formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was used in
children, but the children who received this vac-
cine developed more severe diseases than those
exposed to natural RSV infection; hence, this
vaccine is no longer used. Recently, a live
attenuated RSV vaccine that can be used as a
nasal spray is under evaluation.
Nipah Virus
Nipah virus was reported to be the causative agent
of encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998
and 1999. People rearing pig populations were
increasingly susceptible to encephalitis to this
previously
unrecognised
virus.
No
speciﬁc
antiviral agent or vaccine is available against the
Nipah virus. Outbreaks of Nipah virus infection
occur
mostly
in
parts
of
Asia,
primarily
Bangladesh and India. Infection occurs by expo-
sure to sick pigs and bats in areas where the virus
is present and drinking raw date palm sap which
can
be
contaminated
by
an
infected
bat.
Outbreaks occur almost annually in these regions.
Standard infection control practices should be
adopted during an outbreak to prevent person-
to-person spread in hospital settings.
Five outbreaks have been reported in India.
The ﬁrst Nipah virus disease outbreak was
reported in Siliguri town in 2001, followed by a
second outbreak in Nadia district in 2007 in West
Bengal state. In 2018, an outbreak was reported in
Kozhikode district, and in 2019, another outbreak
in Kochi district, both in Kerala state. The recent
outbreak was also reported from Kerala in 2021.
Nipah has a relatively high case fatality rate, and
immediate
epidemiological
investigations,
including contacts identiﬁcation, including health
care workers and close family members, is
required and should be placed under quarantine.
Hendra Virus
Hendra virus is a recently described, new zoo-
notic paramyxovirus. Hendra virus was ﬁrst
isolated from the cases of severe respiratory dis-
ease in Hendra, Australia, in 1994; hence the
name Hendra virus. Infection is transmitted from
infected horses to humans. Fruit bats are the nat-
ural reservoir. No speciﬁc antiviral agent or vac-
cine is available against the Hendra virus. Hendra
virus infection remains a rare entity, and only
7 cases have been reported in humans though
the infection has been reported in as many as
70 horses. Early recognition of the disease in the

horses is probably the most important step in
limiting human cases. The infection can be
prevented by avoiding sick horses and using
appropriate personal protective equipment in vet-
erinary procedures. A commercial vaccine has
been
recently
licensed
in
Australia
for
horses only.

Human Metapneumovirus
Human metapneumovirus is a newly described
virus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus
was ﬁrst reported as a cause of respiratory illness
in children in 2001. The clinical manifestations of
HMPV are closely similar to that of RSV infec-
tion in children. Like other members of the family
Paramyxoviridae, human metapneumovirus is a
single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is a respira-
tory pathogen and is associated as the cause of
respiratory tract disease in children and adults
worldwide.
The virus appears to be prevalent worldwide.
The ﬁrst report of the virus in 2001 demonstrated
that all Dutch children by the age of 10 years were
seropositive
for
the
virus.
Similar
studies
conducted in Australia, Canada, Japan and Israel
have shown the high seroprevalence of HMPV
antibodies in the population. Infants, elderly
persons and immunocompromised individuals
appear to be more susceptible to infection by the
virus.
The virus is an important cause of respiratory
tract infection in children, particularly infants. It
causes disease, clinical manifestations of which
are similar to those caused by human RSV. It
causes clinical disease, ranging from mild respi-
ratory symptoms to severe cough, bronchiolitis
and pneumonia. The condition is also associated
with high-grade fever, vomiting and myalgia. The
virus also causes RSV-like diseases in adults,
especially in those with chronic obstructive lung
disease.
The virus is very difﬁcult to grow in cell cul-
ture, and currently, serodiagnosis tests are not
widely available to diagnose the condition. PCR
appears to be the most speciﬁc test for diagnosing
the
condition
by
examining
respiratory
secretions. These include nasopharyngeal swabs,
nasopharyngeal
aspirates
or
bronchoalveolar
lavage specimens.
No speciﬁc antiviral treatment is available.
Hence, the treatment is majorly supportive. No
vaccine is currently available. Characteristics of
various genera in the family Paramyxoviridae are
summarised in Table 57.2.
Case Study
A 3-year-old girl attended the Paediatrics OPD
with complaints of high fever, malaise, anorexia,
conjunctivitis, cough and coryza. Parents of the
child gave the history of the appearance of
red-coloured rash initially on the face and then
spreading to the trunk, extremities, palms and
soles. On examination, bluish-grey specks on a
red base were found on the buccal mucosa oppo-
site the second molar.

Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses)
and Rodent-borne Viruses
58
Arthropod-Borne Viruses
Arthropod-borne viruses or arboviruses are RNA
viruses that are transmitted by arthropods. The
word arbovirus is an acronym for arthropod-
borne viruses transmitted by arthropods from
one vertebrate host to another. Arbovirus is a
collective name for a large group of viruses, of
which about 100 are known human pathogens.
Most of the arboviruses causing infections in
humans are zoonotic, with humans acting as acci-
dental hosts. Yellow fever and dengue viruses are
two exceptions that are not zoonotic.
The arboviruses have a special afﬁnity to
arthropod vectors, which can multiply and
spread
to
humans.
Some
arboviruses
are
maintained in nature by transovarial transmission
in arthropods. The mosquitoes are the best
known and important vector of arboviral infec-
tion, following which many ticks, such as
Phlebotomus, Culicoides and Cimicidae, also act
as a vector for some of the arboviral diseases.
Important Properties
Arboviruses were named initially, according to
the disease they cause, such as yellow fever
virus, or depending upon the place from where
they were ﬁrst isolated, for example, West Nile
fever and St. Louis encephalitis. Taxonomically,
most arboviruses and arboviruses are recently
classiﬁed into ﬁve families, namely, Togaviridae,
Flaviviridae,
Bunyaviridae,
Reoviridae
and
Rhabdoviridae. Most viruses of medical impor-
tance are included in the family Togaviridae, and
some belong to the family Flaviviridae and some
to families Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae.

Togaviruses,
ﬂaviviruses,
bunyaviruses,
reoviruses and rhabdoviruses associated with
human infections are summarised in Table 58.1.
The antigenic structure of arboviruses basi-
cally
comprises
major
proteins,
like
haemagglutinins,
complement-ﬁxing
and
neutralising antigens. Structural proteins, like E
protein in the viral envelope, capsid proteins (C),
membrane proteins and several non-structural
(NS) proteins, contribute to the pathogenesis of
infections by these viruses. The C proteins help
information
of
infectious
viral
particles,
E
proteins help in viral assembly, attachment and
internalisation of the virus inside the host cell, and
M proteins help in membrane formation and mat-
uration of the virus particles. The NS proteins
play different roles in virus replication, immune
suppression and evasion.
As RNA viruses, arboviruses are labile and
easily
inactivated
at
room
temperature.
Disinfectants and solvents, like alcohol and
ether, inactivate these viruses by dissolving the
lipid coat of the viruses.
The
life
cycle
of
the
arboviruses
is
characterised by their ability to multiply in both
the
vertebrate
hosts
and
blood-sucking

arthropods. Nevertheless, for effective transmis-
sion to vectors, the virus must be present in sufﬁ-
ciently higher numbers in the bloodstream of the
vertebrate hosts, which can be taken up in a small
volume of blood ingested during the bite of the
arthropod. After ingestion, the virus replicates in
the gut of arthropods and then spreads to other
organs, including the salivary gland. Only the
females of the species serve as the vector of the
virus because female species require a blood meal
to produce the progeny. Most of these viruses in
their life cycle show an extrinsic incubation
period in the vectors, during which viruses are
replicated sufﬁciently in the vector and are pres-
ent in sufﬁcient numbers in the saliva to transmit
the infection to the vertebrate host. The extrinsic
period for most of the viruses ranges from 7 to
14 days. Some arboviruses are transmitted by
vertical transmission through the transovarial pas-
sage from a mother tick to baby ticks.
Arthropod-Borne Viruses
827
Humans
in
the
transmission
cycle
of
arboviruses are usually the dead-end hosts. Usu-
ally, human-to-human transmission of infection
by the arthropods does not occur due to the very
low titre of viruses in human blood. In some
diseases, such as dengue and yellow fever, there
is a very high titre of viruses in the blood; hence,
they act as a reservoir of infection to other
humans.
Disease caused by occurs primarily in the
dead-end host, but neither in the arthropod vector
nor in the vertebrate animal that acts as the natural
host. For example, after infection yellow fever
virus causes disease in humans, who are a dead-
end host, but causes a harmless infection among
the jungle monkeys in South Africa, which serve
as the natural host for the yellow fever virus.

Clinical presentations caused by arboviruses
in humans may manifest as (1) fever with or
without maculopapular rash, (2) encephalitis,
often with high mortality or (3) haemorrhagic
fever, also frequently severe and fatal. However,
some arboviruses can cause more than one syn-
drome in the infected human host, for example,
the dengue virus. Recovery from the disease usu-
ally confers lifelong immunity (Table 58.2).
Epidemiology of arbovirus infection shows
distinct geographical distribution and vector
patterns. The viruses occur in the tropics as well
as in temperate countries. They show a tendency
to cause a sudden outbreak of disease that usually
occurs in the adjoining areas between human
dwellings in jungle or forest areas.
Diagnosis of the condition
is made by
isolating the virus and viral serology. Specimens
include blood collected during the acute phase of
the disease. CSF can also be collected for viral
isolation.
The
serum
is
collected
for
serodiagnosis. Some viruses may be isolated by
growth in tissue culture or less commonly in
embryonated eggs. Isolation from insect vectors
and animal or avian species also supplements the
identiﬁcation of arboviruses prevalent in the
study area.

An indirect ﬂuorescent antibody, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
other
tests
are
employed to detect serum antibodies in arbovirus
infections. These tests are useful mainly for epi-
demiological studies rather than for diagnosing
individual
cases.
Antigenic
cross-reaction
between the related viruses is a noted problem.
828
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Control methods essentially include vector
controls and vaccination. The vaccination has
been effective only in yellow fever and a few
other diseases but not most arboviral diseases.
Hence, vector control continues to be a mainstay
in the prevention of arboviral diseases.
Roboviruses
A new group of viruses called roboviruses has
been described recently. This is an acronym for a
rodent-borne
viral
disease
transmitted
from
rodents to rodents and directly from rodents to
humans without the participation of arthropod
vectors. Important properties of roboviruses are
summarised in the Table 58.3.
Roboviruses are spherical, 90 nm in diameter
and
contain
single-stranded
RNA,
linear,
non-segmented, negative sense, 8.9 kb, MW
3 million Da. The viruses consisting of six struc-
tural proteins replicate in the nucleus. They are
enveloped viruses, neurotropic and are associated
with neurobehavioural abnormalities. They have
a broad host range. Transmission occurs by direct
contact with body ﬂuids or excreta of rodents.
Hantavirus infection, Lassa fever and South
American haemorrhagic fever are the major
rodent-borne viral diseases worldwide.

Togaviruses are the largest family of arboviruses
and
contain
two
genera:
Alphavirus
and
Rubivirus. The genus Alphavirus includes 32 dif-
ferent viruses, of which at least 13 viruses are
associated with human diseases. They are trans-
mitted
mainly
by
mosquitoes.
The
genus
Rubivirus contains rubella virus that causes
rubella, which is not arthropod borne. Rubella is
not transmitted by an arthropod vector. Rubella
virus is described in detail in Chap. 70.
Alphaviruses
Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne arboviruses,
which can be classiﬁed as febrile illness group
and
encephalitis
group.
The
febrile
group
includes
Chikungunya
consistently
virus,
O’nyong-nyong
virus,
Semliki
Forest
virus,
Sindbis virus and Ross River virus. The encepha-
litis group includes the Western equine encepha-
litis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.
Encephalitis Group
Encephalitis is an acute inﬂammation of the brain
parenchyma, often with secondary meningeal
involvement.
Western Equine Encephalitis Virus
This virus causes disease more frequently than the
eastern equine encephalitis virus, but the infection
is less severe. It is a neuropathic Alphavirus,

which causes encephalitis and viral symptoms
with an associated rash. The virus is spread pri-
marily by the vector mosquito Culex tarsalis. The
condition is most commonly seen in the United
States and is sub-clinical. The isolation of the
virus from the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) or dem-
onstration of a rise in speciﬁc antibody titre in the
serum conﬁrms the diagnosis. No antiviral ther-
apy is available. A killed vaccine is available to
protect horses but not humans.
Alphaviruses
829
Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus
The virus causes the most severe disease and is
associated with the highest fatality. The virus is
transmitted primarily by Culiseta mosquito. Wild
boars are the reservoir host and horses, and
humans are the dead-end hosts. The diagnosis is
made by isolating the virus or demonstrating a
rise in antibody titre in the serum. There is no
antiviral therapy. There is a killed virus vaccine
for horses, but not for humans.
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis
This virus is transmitted primarily by Culex and
Culiseta
mosquitoes.
The
condition
that
manifests as a mild systemic infection and may
lead to encephalitis is prevalent in North and
South America. Birds are the reservoir hosts.
Febrile Illness with arthritis Group
Chikungunya Virus
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was ﬁrst described
in humans and Aedes aegypti mosquito from
Tanzania in 1954. The name Chikungunya
means “doubled up”, which describes the clinical
manifestation in which a patient lies doubled up
due to severe joint pains. The disease is transmit-
ted primarily by A. aegypti mosquitoes. Humans
are dead-end hosts, and no animal reservoirs
are seen.
Chikungunya
virus
has
three
main
genotypes. These are West African, Asian and
East/Central/South African (ECSA), which has at
least two sublineages, Indian Ocean and Indian.
Epidemiological differences exist between the
genotypes based on their origin. The ECSA
genotype has travelled from East Africa to the
Indian Ocean and India, followed by Europe,
Asia and North America. Presently, in a global
scenario, multiple genotypes can be simulta-
neously present during CHIKV outbreaks.
The virus causes a severe disease with a sud-
den onset of fever, frequent joint pains, lymph-
adenopathy and conjunctivitis. Fever is typically
biphasic with a revision period after 1–6 days.
The
condition
is
often
associated
with
maculopapular rash. Haemorrhagic lesions were
also observed in the patients in Kolkata during
1963. The debilitating joint pain can last for a few
days, weeks, months or even years. CHIKV can
cause
acute,
sub-acute
or
chronic
disease.
Polyarthralgia is a characteristic feature. The
case deﬁnition of Chikungunya fever as proposed
by the WHO is (1) a suspected case as a patient
presenting with acute onset of fever for 3–5 days,
usually with chills and rigors, with pain in multi-
ple joints/swelling of extremities that may con-
tinue for weeks to months; (2) a probable case as
one with features of a suspected case along with
either
history
of
travel/residence
in
areas
reporting outbreaks or with the exclusion of
malaria, dengue and any other known cause of
fever with joint pains. A conﬁrmed case is
supported
by
laboratory
investigations
for
CHIKV irrespective of symptoms.
Chikungunya virus was ﬁrst demonstrated in
India in 1963 during an extensive epidemic
caused by the virus in Kolkata, Chennai and
other areas. Outbreaks of Chikungunya have
also been documented at regular intervals along
the east coast of India and in Maharashtra till the
1960s. In 2006, an outbreak occurred in India,
with 2500 cases reported. About 70% of cases
were from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. This
re-emergence of the virus occurred almost after a
gap of 32 years, causing an extensive outbreak in
13 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
Gujarat and Kerala. Since then, there has been
an increase in cases reported, particularly during
2016–2017.
Among other factors, increased case detection
due to the availability of CHIKV-speciﬁc IgM
detection kits developed by the National Institute

of
Virology
and
made
available
through
NVBDCP contributed signiﬁcantly. Few other
factors could have been differences in climatic
conditions, mosquito and human population den-
sity. Change in genotype and mutations in the
virus’s genome and increase in efﬁciency of
mosquitoes to transmit the virus are other major
reasons for the resurgence of CHIK in India.
830
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
However, often, there are
no outbreaks.
Serodiagnosis is the most common diagnostic
approach. Usually, paired serum samples will be
tested with IgM or IgG ELISA. RT-PCR can also
be used for the detection of viral RNA. No
antiviral therapy or vaccine is available.
O’nyong-nyong Virus
This virus is restricted to Africa and was ﬁrst
reported from Uganda. The virus, closely related
to the Chikungunya virus antigenically, is trans-
mitted by the Anopheles mosquito.
Semliki forest Virus
This virus is yet to be associated with any human
disease, although serum antibodies against this
virus have been demonstrated in an African
population.
Sindbis Virus
Sindbis virus was ﬁrst reported from the Culex
mosquito in Egypt in 1952. Since then, the virus
has been reported from other parts of Africa, the
Philippines and Australia. Serological evidence
of
the
Sindbis
virus
by
demonstration
of
antibodies in the serum has been demonstrated
in India.
Ross River Virus
The virus has been associated with epidemic
polyarthritis in Australia.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses were originally named group B
arboviruses. They are similar to togaviruses in
that they are also single-stranded RNA viruses
and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded
by an envelope. They are slightly smaller
(40–50 nm in diameter) than those of an
Alphavirus, and the RNA does not have a
polyadenylate sequence. The virus also lacks a
conspicuous capsid structure in the virion. All
ﬂaviviruses
are
serologically
related,
and
antibodies to one virus cross-react with another
virus.
The genus Flavivirus contains more than
70 viruses, of which nearly 13 viruses can cause
infection in humans. Most of these infections are
transmitted either by mosquitoes or by ticks.
However, the hepatitis C virus is transmitted nei-
ther by mosquitoes nor by ticks. The ﬂaviviruses
causing infections in humans are classiﬁed
broadly as (1) mosquito-borne ﬂaviviruses and
(2) tick-borne ﬂaviviruses.
Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses
Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses include Encephali-
tis Viruses and yellow fever.
Encephalitis Viruses
St. Louis Encephalitis Virus
St. Louis encephalitis virus is the most important
mosquito-borne viral disease in the United States.
It is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. Wild birds,
such as English sparrows, are the reservoir hosts.
Humans are the dead-end host. These viruses are
mostly
seen
in
urban
areas
because
these
mosquitoes breed in stagnant wastewater. The
virus causes encephalitis, which is associated
with a mortality rate of 10%. Isolation of the
virus is difﬁcult; hence, diagnosis is mostly
based on serology. No antiviral therapy or vac-
cine is available.
Ilheus Virus
The virus occurs mostly in South and Central
America. The infection is maintained in forests
by bats and mosquitoes. The virus usually causes
asymptomatic
infection
and
rarely
causes
encephalitis.

Flaviviruses
831
West Nile Virus
West Nile virus causes encephalitis. The virus is
endemic in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Wild birds are the main reservoirs of the virus.
The infection is transmitted from wild birds to
humans
by
Culex,
Aedes
and
Anopheles
mosquitoes. Humans are the dead-end hosts.
The virus ﬁrst causes asymptomatic or symptom-
atic illness in the wild migratory birds. These
infected birds contain a high titre of the viruses
and remain viraemic for 1–2 weeks. These serve
as important reservoirs of infection for transmis-
sion to humans, horses, dogs and other small
animals after being bitten by mosquitoes.
The virus-like other arthropod-borne viruses
cause viraemia, cross the blood–brain barrier
and infect the brain parenchyma causing viral
encephalitis. Patients with this virus may present
with features of encephalitis, aseptic meningitis
or both. This condition has also been reported
from India, and the virus has been isolated from
Culex mosquitoes. The virus has been isolated
from the brain of these fatal cases of encephalitis
in Karnataka in 1980–1981. Mental confusion
and disorientation with decreased consciousness
are some of the manifestations of patients with
encephalitis. The infection usually occurs in the
summer months when humans, mosquitoes and
wild migratory birds remain in close proximity
outdoors.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made
by isolating the virus from the blood within the
ﬁrst 2 weeks of infection; the virus cannot be
isolated from CSF. Enzyme immunoassay and
plaque reduction utilisation tests are available
for the speciﬁc diagnosis of the condition by
demonstration of speciﬁc antibodies in serum. A
fourfold or greater rise of antibody titres between
acute and convalescent titre is diagnostic of the
infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
also available. No antiviral therapy or vaccine
for the virus is available.
This is an infection that can be transmitted by
transfusion of contaminated blood. Hence, PCR
and nucleic acid probes speciﬁc for the virus are
used to screen the blood for the virus.
Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus
This virus is endemic in New Guinea and
Australia. The virus occurs in the enzootic cycle
involving mosquitoes and wild birds. Culex
annulirostris is the main vector. The virus was
ﬁrst reported during an encephalitis epidemic in
Murray River Valley in 1951 and hence was
called Murray Valley encephalitis virus.
Japanese Encephalitis Virus
JE virus is a ﬂavivirus that causes JE, the most
common cause of epidemic encephalitis. JE virus
is
a
single-stranded
RNA
virus
related
to
St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus. The
virus was ﬁrst isolated in Japan during an enceph-
alitis epidemic in 1935. The virus initially was
called Japanese B encephalitis to distinguish it
from the Japanese A encephalitis virus (Wang
Ecunoms type A encephalitis), which had differ-
ent epidemiological properties. In India, the virus
was ﬁrst reported in 1955 during an outbreak of
encephalitis in Tamil Nadu.
Pathogenesis: The bite of infected mosquitoes
transmits the JE virus to humans. The virus
initially replicates at the site of the bite and in
the regional lymph nodes. Subsequently, the virus
spreads through circulation, causing viraemia and
may produce inﬂammatory changes in the heart,
lungs, reticuloendothelial system and liver. Usu-
ally, these infections are removed before the virus
affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing
underlying disease. Even though neurological
protrusion can probably be caused by the virus’s
growth
within
endothelial
cells
vascularly,
thereby affecting the large parts of the brain,
including the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain
stem, cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cor-
tex. Circulating antibodies play an important role
in conferring heterologous immunity against JE.
Clinical presentations: Most of the infections
are asymptomatic. Only 1 in 250 infections
results in symptomatic disease. Most symptom-
atic infections occur in young children between
2 and 10 years and elderly people in endemic
areas. In non-endemic areas, the infection occurs
in all age groups.

Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
The incubation period of JE varies from 4 to
15 days. The condition has an abrupt onset with
the appearance of symptoms, which include
fever, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and
myalgia, which may last for several days. This is
followed by an altered state of consciousness,
tremors,
incoordination
and
convulsions.
Seizures develop in two-thirds of people—most
often
in
children,
while
headaches
and
meningismus are more common in adults.
The mortality rate is high; in less-developed areas
with poor medical care, the mortality rate may
exceed 35%. More than 10,000 reported deaths
occur per year due to JE worldwide. The neuro-
logical sequelae are severe and can occur in many
patients who suffer from the disease. The neuro-
logical sequelae include seizure disorder, move-
ment disorder or motor or cranial nerve paralysis.
Epidemiology: This is a seasonal disease with
more cases seen in temperate areas from the dura-
tion of June to September. Transmission starts as
early as March and ends until October in subtrop-
ical areas. In a few subtropical areas, such as
Indonesia, transmission can start at the earliest.
Around 35,000–50,000 symptomatic cases are
being reported worldwide per year, even though
there is lightly a miscalculation of the actual
prevalence of the disease. Approximately, 3 bil-
lion people currently live in areas endemic for JE,
which extend from India to Maritime, Siberia and
Japan. The disease occurs throughout Asia but is
most prevalent in Southeast Asia.

Birds and pigs are the two main reservoir
hosts. JE is transmitted to humans by certain
species of Culex mosquitoes widely prevalent in
rice ﬁelds in Asia. The disease is spread through-
out mostly rural areas of Asia by culicine
mosquitoes, most often Culex tritaeniorhynchus.
Natural infection occurs in ardeid birds, such as
herons and egrets, and the virus is transmitted
from bird to bird by C. tritaeniorhynchus.
Transmission of the JE virus occurs primar-
ily in rural agricultural areas, often related to rice
production and ﬂooded ﬁelds with heavy irriga-
tion. In some areas of Asia, even the surroundings
of
urban
areas
have
similar
geographical
conditions. Transmission of JE is seasonal in
temperate areas of Asia, with peaks in JE cases
in the summer and fall. However, infections occur
in tropical regions round the year, with a cluster-
ing of cases in the rainy season. Humans are
incidental or dead-end hosts. Otherwise, the
transmission
cycle
is
maintained
between
mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, like pigs.
Humans, cattle, buffaloes and pigs are the
vertebrate hosts. Birds act as reservoir hosts.
Pigs are usually the ampliﬁer host. Pigs have
persistent, high-grade viraemia and help transmit
the virus in humans living close to the pig-rearing
areas (Fig. 58.1). C. tritaeniorhynchus is a major

vector that has a predilection for cattle and bites
them in preference to humans or pigs, but since
the cattle do not develop viraemia, this does not
contribute to the spread of the disease. The high
cattle to pig ratio in India is a major factor
suggested to control infection in India.
Flaviviruses
833
Indian Scenario: JE in India was ﬁrst reported
from Vellore, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in the
1950s. Since then, the condition has been
reported in all the states and union territories of
India. An estimated 378 million people live at the
risk of JE in 12 states, union territories that are
frequently affected. Several outbreaks of JE have
occurred in Bankura and Burdwan in West
Bengal, Dibrugarh in Assam, South Arcot in
Tamil Nadu, Kolar in Karnataka, various areas
in
Andhra
Pradesh
and
Pondicherry
and
Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. Rapid agricultural
development
and
intensive
rice
cultivation
supported by irrigation systems facilitating breed-
ing of culicine mosquitoes are primarily responsi-
ble for spreading the condition to newer areas in
India. An epidemic of the JE virus occurred in
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India in 2005 and
throughout Nepal. More than 5000 cases were
reported during this epidemic, and approximately
1000 deaths were documented.
C. tritaeniorhynchus is the most important
mosquito species that transmits JE. This mosquito
has a peculiar habit of biting outdoors and is
extremely active in the evening and night. These
mosquitoes breed in the collection of water, typi-
cally rice ﬁelds, thereby increasing the risk of
infections in rural areas. Low-grade, short-term
viraemia occurs in humans and other mammals;
hence, these are dead-end hosts for the virus.
Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating
the virus from the blood during the ﬁrst week of
illness. The CSF rarely yields viruses except in
severe or fatal cases. Serodiagnosis is made by
using ELISA to demonstrate IgM antibodies in
serum or CSF. This test has a high sensitivity,
nearing 100%. The test may show a false-positive
reaction with serum from other febrile illnesses,
such as dengue and West Nile fever or with the
serum collected after vaccination with yellow
fever and JE. The IgM antibodies are present in
serum or CSF in approximately three-fourths of
patients within the ﬁrst 4 days after onset of
illness and in nearly all the patients after 7 days
of illness. The direct ﬂuorescent antibody test is a
rapid method for detecting viral antigens directly
in the brain tissue. Reverse transcriptase–poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to dem-
onstrate the viral genome in the CSF and blood
for diagnosis of JE.
There is no speciﬁc antiviral therapy available
for the treatment of JE.
Prevention consists of the use of the vaccine.
The vaccine using the Nakayama strain is approx-
imately 100% immunogenic after three doses.
Two doses of the vaccine are administered at
2 weeks intervals followed by a booster dose
after 6–12 months. The vaccine is recommended
for persons living in epidemic and endemic areas
and for travellers visiting these areas. The vaccine
is also useful in the pig population to prevent
epidemics.
A live attenuated vaccine is now widely used
in India, Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It is a JE
strain SA 14-14-2-based vaccine. This virus strain
is usually grown in the Vero cell line and further
inactivated and alum adjuvanted. The primary
two doses of this vaccine are administered
4 weeks apart. Following this, a booster dose is
recommended approximately within 1–2 years of
primary doses. The efﬁcacy of this vaccine was
found to be high and helps in preventing clinical
diseases.
There are four main types of JE vaccines
currently in use worldwide. These are inactivated
mouse brain-derived vaccines, inactivated Vero
cell-derived vaccines, live attenuated vaccines
and live recombinant vaccines. Of these, the live
attenuated cell culture-derived SA14-14-2 vaccine
is the most widely used vaccine in endemic
countries. In India, besides the above vaccine,
two other vaccines are Inactivated SA-14-14-
2 vaccine (IC51) (IXIARO® by Intercel &
JEEV® by Biological Evans India Ltd.) and
Inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Kolar strain,
821564XY. JE vaccine (JENVAC® by Bharat
Biotech) has been in use.
Mosquito eradication and measures to prevent
mosquito bites, such as the use of mosquito nets,

mosquito repellents and insecticides, are useful to
prevent transmission of infection.
834
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Yellow Fever Virus
It is a virus that is type-speciﬁc belonging to the
family Flaviviridae. The virus is a single-stranded
RNA virus that is enveloped. The envelope
contains a lipid bilayer surrounding a glycopro-
tein layer and a matrix protein. The single-
stranded RNA is compounded with a capsid
protein.
Pathogenesis of Yellow Fever
Yellow fever, caused by the virus, is transmitted
by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. The virus
replicates locally and in regional lymph nodes
draining the wound. Subsequently, the virus
spreads by blood to the bone marrow, liver, myo-
cardium and spleen, where further virus replica-
tion occurs. The condition is associated with
haemorrhagic manifestations occurring due to
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation.
This
occurs due to bleeding from the gastrointestinal
mucosa and abdominal and pleural serous layers.
This is associated with a reduction in coagulation
factor synthesis and altered platelet function. The
condition progresses to shock and death due to
multiple organ failures involving the liver, kid-
ney, brain and heart.
Host immunity is characterised by the pres-
ence of viral neutralising antibodies by the end
of the ﬁrst week, during which the virus is rapidly
cleared from circulation. An attack of yellow
fever confers lifelong immunity.
Clinical Syndromes
The incubation period is short and varies from
3 to 6 days. No prodromal symptoms occur. As
the name suggests, yellow fever is characterised
by
jaundice
and
fever.
This
is
an
illness
characterised by an acute onset of fever followed
by jaundice within 2 weeks of the onset of
symptoms. Typically, symptoms begin suddenly
with fever, chill, malaise, prostration, headache,
giddiness,
myalgia,
anorexia,
nausea
and
vomiting. This may be associated with bleeding
from the nose, gums, gastrointestinal tract or skin
within a few weeks of illness.
Haemorrhagic
diathesis
progressing
to
disseminated intravascular coagulation is the
most important complication of the disease. Mul-
tiple organ failure involving the liver, kidney and
heart is responsible for the patient’s death. Yel-
low fever is a severe and life-threatening disease.
Epidemiology
Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne acute febrile
illness that occurs in Africa and South America.
The disease is not reported in India. Yellow fever
is endemic in South America and the Caribbean
enzootic countries of Africa. Although yellow
fever can be transmitted in Asian countries, no
documented transmission of yellow fever has
been reported from Asian countries, including
India. It has been suggested that previous infec-
tion with another ﬂavivirus, such as the dengue
virus, may confer protection from the yellow
fever virus in Asian countries.
Yellow fever is transmitted from infected
humans to mosquitoes, which are diurnal feeders.
Humans suffering from the disease during the
initial 3–4 weeks of illness are the source of
infection. The extrinsic incubation period is
12–21 days. Vertical transmission of yellow
fever takes place from female mosquitoes to the
female progeny in 1% of cases. This is the impor-
tant reason for the survival of the virus in the dry
season. Approximately 3–10 variants are neces-
sary to infect a mosquito. Seasonal transmission
of yellow fever occurs during the mid-rainy sea-
son and early dry season in Africa. In South
America, this occurs from January to March. An
estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever occur in
Africa
and
South
America,
causing
20,000–30,000 deaths annually.
Yellow fever shows different transmission
cycles.

Dengue Virus
835
The Jungle (sylvatic) Cycle
It is present in rain forests. In this cycle, the
mosquito transmits the virus to wild, non-human
primates;
subsequently,
it
is
transmitted
to
another mosquito from these hosts. Humans are
the incidental hosts in the cycle, for example,
humans clearing the trees in the forest when
they are bitten by the mosquito. Aedes species
are the main vectors in Africa. Wild Aedes species
are the vectors in South America.
The Urban Cycle
It is conﬁned to urban areas in which the
mosquitoes transmit the virus to a human host,
and then it is transmitted to another mosquito.
A. aegypti, a domestic mosquito, is the primary
vector.
The Intermediate Cycle
It is conﬁned to the Savanna forest area of Africa
and is the most common cycle responsible for
outbreaks of yellow fever in Africa. In this
cycle, the mosquito transmits the virus to wild
non-human primates and human hosts and then
it is transmitted to another mosquito.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever can be made
by (1) isolation of yellow fever virus from the
clinical
specimens,
(2)
demonstration
of
IgM-speciﬁc antibodies in the serum or demon-
stration of fourfold or more rise in serum IgG,
(3) detection of yellow fever antigen in tissues by
immunohistochemistry)
detection
of
viral
genomes by PCR and (4) elevated transaminase
and bilirubin levels, demonstrated during the
toxic stage of illness.
Prevention and Control
Prevention is by vaccines. Vaccination is the most
widely used preventive measure against yellow
fever.
The 17 D strain of yellow fever virus is a
widely used attenuated live virus vaccine. This
avirulent 17 D strain vaccine was recovered
during the serial passage of a pantropic strain of
yellow fever virus through tissue culture. The
strain
that has
lost its capacity to induce
viscerotropic or neurotropic disease has been
used as a vaccine for more than 40 years. The
vaccine, which is prepared in eggs and is avail-
able as a dried powder, is maintained in a cold
chain for effective immunisation. The vaccine is
highly effective. The vaccine provides immunity
mainly for 30–35 years and probably for the
whole life after a single dose. The vaccine is
highly safe associated with very few side effects.
The vaccine is indicated for (1) all the
individuals residing in countries endemic for yel-
low fever and (2) travellers visiting the countries
South America and Africa. The vaccine is
contraindicated for (1) infants below 9 months,
(2) pregnant mothers and (3) individuals with
immune deﬁciency diseases, such as HIV or
persons receiving organ transplantation, etc.
Other preventive measures include mosquito
eradication programs and personal protective
measures.
Dengue Virus
Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne
arboviral illness caused by the dengue virus. The
name dengue is derived from the Swahili word
ki-dinga-pepo, meaning a sudden seizure by a
Demon. The earliest known documentation of
symptoms of dengue-like illness was described
in the Chinese Encyclopaedia during 265 AD. In
1780, Rauss coined the term “break-bone fever”
based on the description of symptoms reported by
patients during Philadelphia epidemics of proba-
bly dengue fever. The possible outbreak of den-
gue
fever
epidemics
was
documented
sporadically every 10–30 years until World War
II. Subsequently, after World War II, the dengue
fever spread and became worldwide. The ﬁrst
epidemic of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)
was described in 1963 in Manila. In 1979–80,
the ﬁrst reported outbreak of dengue fever
occurred simultaneously in Asia, Africa and
North America.

836
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Morphology
Dengue virus is a small, spherical and enveloped
virus. It is a ﬂavivirus having a cubic symmetry
and measures 40–50 nm in diameter. It is a single-
stranded RNA virus of 11 kb size. It has an
icosahedral nucleocapsid and is covered by a
lipid envelope. The virus is inactivated by diethyl
ether and bile salts, such as sodium deoxycholate.
Antigenic Properties
Dengue virus has four distinct closely related
serotypes:
dengue
1
(DEN-1),
dengue
2 (DEN-2), dengue 3 (DEN-3) and dengue
4 (DEN-4). The speciation was done by Albert
Sabin in 1944. Each serotype is known to have
several different genotypes.
Pathogenesis of Dengue
Humans acquire infection and become infected
with the virus by the bite of the Aedes mosquito
vector.
The
leakage
of
plasma
caused
by
increased capillary permeability is the major
pathophysiological abnormality that occurs in
DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Bleed-
ing, which is a most important manifestation in
patients with DHF, is caused due to capillary
fragility and thrombocytopenia, and it manifests
in various ways ranging from petechial skin
haemorrhages to life-threatening gastrointestinal
bleeding.
It is postulated that prior infection with one or
more dengue serotypes causes the development of
low levels of neutralising antibodies and a high
level of non-neutralising antibodies. In the same
patient on reinfection with another serotype of
dengue virus, the virus antibody complexes are
formed within a few days of second dengue infec-
tion. This increases viral entry and replication of
more mononuclear cells, followed by the release
of cytokines, vasoactive mediators and a few
coagulants. This phenomenon is called anti-
body-dependent enhancement. It is responsible
primarily for the disseminated intravascular coag-
ulation seen in patients with DHF. Signiﬁcantly,
certain dengue strains, especially dengue two
strains, are considered to be most virulent.
Immunity
Infection with the dengue virus confers lifelong
immunity. The immunity is serotype speciﬁc.
Infection by one serotype does not confer protec-
tion against other serotypes. The infection with
the dengue virus of different serotypes may cause
more severe diseases, such as DHF. Although
dengue and yellow fever viruses are antigenically
related, infection with the dengue virus does not
result in signiﬁcant cross-immunity against the
yellow fever virus.
Clinical Syndromes
The dengue virus causes classic dengue, DHF
and DSS.
Classic Dengue Fever
The incubation period varies from 2 to 7 days.
The onset of the disease is sudden, which begins
as an inﬂuenza-like illness manifesting as fever,
malaise, cough and headache. The fever, which
may be as high as 41 C, typically begins on the
third day and lasts for 5–7 days. The fever is
typically biphasic, coinciding with the absence
of a virus in the blood. A maculopapular rash
usually appears on the third or fourth day of the
illness. The rash lasts for 1–5 days, fading with
desquamation. Severe muscle pain, deep bone
pain and joint pain (break-bone fever) are charac-
teristic. Enlarged lymph nodes and leucopenia are
also seen. Classic dengue fever is a self-limiting
disease. It is rarely fatal and has few sequelae and
complications. The convalescent phase may last
for 2 weeks.
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever
Dengue haemorrhagic fever is the most severe
disease manifestation. The initial classic phase

of DHF is similar to dengue fever and other
febrile viral illnesses. However, subsequently,
the patient’s condition suddenly worsens with
shock and haemorrhage, especially into the gas-
trointestinal tract and skin. The haemorrhagic
manifestations include bleeding from the nose or
gums, melena and haematemesis. This condition
shows a high fatality rate as high as 10%. It
occurs in children with passively acquired mater-
nal antibodies. DHF or DSS is seen in most
patients who have had prior infections with one
or more dengue serotypes.
Dengue Virus
837
Dengue Shock Syndrome
It is the most severe form of the disease caused by
the dengue virus. This is most commonly seen in
untreated cases of DHF. The common symptoms
include abdominal pain, vomiting and restless-
ness, and ﬁnally, the patient may die of circula-
tory failure and shock.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Blood collected during the ﬁrst 3–5 days of ill-
ness is useful for isolating viruses, and serum is
useful for serological tests.
Cell Culture
Diagnosis of dengue is conﬁrmed by isolation of
virus from blood during the ﬁrst 3–5 days of
illness. The virus can be isolated in various cell
cultures. Several mosquito cell lines have been in
use. The C6/36 clone of Aedes albopictus cells for
dengue viruses has been well in use. These cells
provide a simple and rapid method for dengue
virus isolation. They also provide serotype-
speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies for identiﬁcation
and help in dengue virus surveillance. Other mos-
quito cell lines, like TRA-284-SF cells AP-61, are
also used for viral culture. These are suitable for
routine virological surveillance because of the
ease of processing large numbers of specimens
for virus isolation in a short period.
Serology
The serodiagnosis of dengue fever is based on the
demonstration that IgM immunoglobulin is con-
ﬁrmatory for dengue. There is a rise in NS-1
antigen, which will be the ﬁrst to appear from
day 1 to day 9 and also a rise in IgG antibodies.
IgM antibodies against the dengue virus are
detectable after 4–5 days after onset of symptoms.
The IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) is the
most widely used test for demonstrating IgM
antibodies in the serum. Neutralisation test,
haemagglutination inhibition and IgG ELISA
are the other serological tests used to diagnose
the condition. The Plaque Reduction Neutraliza-
tion Test (PRNT), which measures the titre of the
neutralising antibodies in the infected person’s
serum, can detect the dengue virus and other
ﬂaviviruses. However, this test is only performed
in the CDC referral laboratories presently.
The dengue MAC-ELISA, which is based on
capturing human IgM antibodies on a microtitre
plate using an anti-human-IgM antibody followed
by the addition of dengue virus antigens, has been
used for the qualitative detection of dengue virus
IgM antibodies. The antigens used are E proteins
of four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1-4).
They are detectable for approximately 12 weeks.
Combined testing approaches using nucleic acid
ampliﬁcation test (NAAT) and MAC-ELISA usu-
ally gives a diagnosis in the ﬁrst 1–7 days of
illness.
Molecular Detection
RT-PCR is being used for genomic detection of
dengue virus in the clinical specimen, but the test
is now restricted only for use in research
laboratories. However, CDC has devised a multi-
plex assay named CDC DENV-1-4 rRT-PCR
multiplex assay to detect and type dengue virus.
This assay detects DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 or
4 from human serum or plasma collected from
human patients with signs and symptoms consis-
tent with dengue infection. This assay is devised
to be used as a diagnostic test in patients. It is not
approved for blood bank screening. Besides, it
also provides epidemiologic surveillance data on
circulating dengue viruses.

838
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral therapy is available to treat
dengue infection. For cases with haemorrhagic
manifestations and shock, supportive care is
advised. Hydration in patients should be specially
emphasised. Patients should be asked to avoid
aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), aspirin-containing
drugs and other non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (such as ibuprofen) owing to their antico-
agulant properties. Close observation and fre-
quent monitoring in an intensive care unit may
be required in those with severe dengue. There is
no role in prophylactic platelet transfusions in
dengue patients, which might lead to ﬂuid over-
load. Platelet transfusions are only indicated
when the count reduces to 10,000 or below, or
there is active bleeding in the patient. Other than
autoimmune-related
complications,
corticosteroids should not be used.
Epidemiology
Dengue virus is distributed worldwide. DHF is
primarily a disease of children and a leading
cause of death in Southeast Asia.
Geographical Distribution
The estimated 3 billion people living in approxi-
mately 110 countries worldwide are at risk of
dengue infection. Every year, approximately
100 million people are infected with dengue
worldwide. The estimated 500,000 people with
severe dengue require hospitalisation each year,
and about 2.5% of those affected die. The actual
number of dengue cases is underreported. The
incidence of dengue has increased globally in
recent decades. The disease is now endemic in
more than 100 countries in the WHO regions of
Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean,
South-East Asia and the Western Paciﬁc, with the
America, South-East Asia and Western Paciﬁc
regions being the most seriously affected. Not
only is the number of cases increasing, but also
explosive
outbreaks
are
occurring.
Among
travellers returning from low- and middle-income
countries, dengue is the second most diagnosed
cause of fever after malaria. The years 2015–2016
have been marked by large dengue outbreaks
worldwide,
including
India,
Brazil,
the
Philippines and Malaysia. However, for the
increase in cases, a potential reason is the initia-
tion of activities to record all dengue cases also.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Humans are reservoirs of infection. The human
host serves as a source of viral ampliﬁcation.
Humans are infectious to mosquitoes during
viraemia for 3–5 days. The infection is transmit-
ted by the bite of A. aegypti mosquitoes. After
feeding, the virus shows an extrinsic incubation
period of 10–14 days in the mosquito before the
mosquito becomes infectious. The mosquitoes are
vectors as well as sources of viral ampliﬁcation.
A. aegypti are small and highly domesticated
mosquitoes, which breed on artiﬁcial water
sources, and they prefer to bite humans, typically
at the back of the neck and the ankles.
The
initial
dengue
epidemics
were
documented in urban areas, but with the recent
increase in dengue epidemics, the condition has
also spread to suburban and rural areas. Dengue
has been spreading from Southeast Asia to the
subtropical and tropical Asian countries, the
Indian subcontinent, including India, Sri Lanka,
Malaysia, Philippines, New Guinea, Australia
and several paciﬁc islands. Unplanned urban
development with population explosion and inad-
equate public health facilities, poor vector control
and increased travel to the endemic areas have
contributed to the spread of dengue worldwide.
The ﬁrst epidemic of DHF was described in
Manila, the Philippines, in 1953. Subsequently,
DHF has spread rapidly, with epidemics occur-
ring yearly and major outbreaks occurring every
3 years. Currently, DHF is one of the leading
causes of death and hospitalisation in children in
many Southeast Asian countries.
As per WHO, dengue is among the top ten
diseases prioritised by the World Health Organi-
zation from 2019 to 2024. This is because the
incidence of this viral disease has increased over

30-fold in the last ﬁve decades, through activities
to record all dengue cases have also contributed to
this number. However, in this global burden,
one-third is contributed by India. Of the 96 million
cases reported each year, 33 million of them are in
India.
A
community-based
survey
in
India
showed that almost half of the population
(48.7%) had been exposed to dengue infection
in India at some point in their lives. The highest
numbers are in the southern states (769%),
followed by the western (623%) and northern
(603%) states. Therefore, it could be said that
urbanisation is one of the main drivers for rising
dengue incidence in India, as no urban part of
India is now not affected by the disease.
Zika Virus
839
Prevention and Control
No vaccine is available for the prevention of
dengue infection. The preventive measures are
based mostly on mosquito control activities.
These include the use of insecticides and clearing
the stagnant water and artiﬁcial collections of
water that serves as the breeding ground for the
mosquitoes. Personal control measures include
wearing good protective clothing and use of mos-
quito nets, mosquito repellents, etc.
Zika Virus
The Zika virus is transmitted through the bite of
an infected Aedes mosquito (Ae. aegypti and
Ae. albopictus), which can be found worldwide.
These mosquitoes bite during the day and night.
Infection is seen mostly in tropical and subtropi-
cal areas, including the Paciﬁc Islands, several
countries in Central, South and North America,
and islands near West Africa. Zika can be passed
from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection
during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects,
like microcephaly. Brain damage, joint problems
and body movement disorders can also occur as
complications. The virus can also spread through
sexual contact. People contract the virus through
blood transfusion or organ donation in rare cases.
Nearly 4 out of 5 people infected with the Zika
virus have no signs or symptoms. If symptoms
occur, they usually show between 2 and 14 days
after an infected mosquito bites a person. Signs
and symptoms of the Zika virus most commonly
include mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjuncti-
vitis.
Other
less
common
symptoms
might
include muscle pain, headache, abdominal pain
and fatigue. There is no vaccine or treatment for
Zika. Restricting travel to endemic areas and
using protection during sex are some methods of
preventing Zika virus infection.
Tick-Borne Flaviviruses
These viruses are broadly of two types: tick-borne
encephalitis viruses and tick-borne haemorrhagic
fever.
Tick-Borne Encephalitis Viruses
Russian Spring-summer Encephalitis (RSSE)
The condition caused by the Russian spring-
summer encephalitis virus is transmitted by the
bite of ixodid ticks. This condition, prevalent in
Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, is
transmitted
mainly
by
the
bite
of
ticks.
Transovarial transmission of the virus occurs in
ticks and makes it an important reservoir host.
Wild rodents and birds are the other reservoirs.
Ingestion of infected meat obtained from infected
goats may also transmit the infection to humans.
Avoidance of tick bites is an important control
measure. A formalin-treated Russian spring-
summer encephalitis vaccine has also been
found to be useful.
Powassan Virus
Powassan virus is another tick-borne virus caus-
ing
Powassan
encephalitis.
This
has
been
reported from Canada and the northern United
States.

58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Tick-Borne Haemorrhagic Fever
Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD)
It is an example of tick-borne haemorrhagic fever.
This disease is called so because this was ﬁrst
reported in the Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka in
1957. The virus was associated with a fatal epizo-
otic, affecting monkeys along with severe illness
in some of the villages in the area. The causative
virus was isolated from the patients and dead
monkeys.
After an incubation period of 3–7 days, the
KFD manifests with a sudden onset of fever
associated with headache, vomiting, conjunctivi-
tis, myalgia and severe prostration. In some cases,
bleeding through the gastrointestinal tract and
chest
cavity
may
occur.
The
condition
is
associated with a case fatality of 5%.

reported from Wayanad, India. Indian J Med Res 2012;
135: 435–436; http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/
outbreaks/distribution-map.html)
The KFD is mostly localised in distribution
and
conﬁned
to
the
Shimoga
district
of
Karnataka,
India
(Fig.
58.2).
The
disease
remained restricted to north Karnataka between
1972
and
1975.
Subsequently,
the
disease
outbreaks were reported in Veltha belthangady
in South Karnataka between December 1982
and May 1983. During this outbreak, 1142
human cases were reported, with 104 deaths.
The infection is mostly transmitted by the bite of
the tick Haemaphysalis spinigera. The tick also
acts as the reservoir host because the virus is

transmitted transovarially. The monkeys appear
to act as ampliﬁer hosts but not reservoir hosts
because monkeys die of the infection.
Filoviridae
841
No speciﬁc antiviral treatment is available.
Prevention of the disease is based primarily on
the control of ticks and personal protection by
using adequate clothing and insect repellents. A
killed KFD vaccine is also available for use
against the KFD.
Omsk Haemorrhagic Fever
This fever is caused by a virus related to KFD.
Bites of Dermacentor ticks transmit the condition,
and it occurs in Russia and Romania. Clinical
manifestations of the disease are similar to that
of KFD.
Filoviridae
Ebola Virus
This virus is a Flavivirus that consists of a group
of viruses. These are Ebola virus (species Zaire
ebolavirus),
Sudan
virus
(species
Sudan
ebolavirus), Taï Forest virus (species Taï Forest
ebolavirus, formerly Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus),
Bundibugyo
virus
(species
Bundibugyo
ebolavirus),
Reston
virus
(species
Reston
ebolavirus) and Bombali virus (species Bombali
ebolavirus). Of these, only four (Ebola, Sudan,
Taï Forest and Bundibugyo viruses) have been
associated with diseases in humans. Reston virus
can cause disease in non-human primates and
pigs, but there has been no case reports in
humans. Bombali virus was reported in bats in
2018, and not much information is available
regarding its disease-causing potential in animals
and humans.
Infection with Ebola virus, known as Ebola
virus disease (EVD), is a fatal disease in humans
and non-human primates that presents with occa-
sional outbreaks, mostly in the African continent.
EVD
most
commonly
affects
people
and
non-human primates (such as monkeys, gorillas
and chimpanzees). Infections due to the Ebola
virus is rare. The viruses are located mainly in
sub-Saharan Africa. The transmission mode is
through direct contact with an infected animal
(bat or non-human primate) or a sick or dead
person infected with the Ebola virus.
The infection cycle begins with an infected
animal, like a fruit bat or non-human primate.
This is called a “spillover event”. After that, the
virus spreads from person to person and quickly
affects many people. The route of transmission is
through direct contacts, such as through broken
skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or
mouth or with blood or body ﬂuids, like urine,
saliva, sweat, faeces, vomitus, breast milk, amni-
otic ﬂuid and semen of a person who is sick with
or has died from Ebola virus infection. Personal
items, like clothes, bedding, needles and medical
equipment contaminated with body ﬂuids from an
infected person, can also serve as the vehicle for
transmission. Ebola virus is not transmitted
through food, though in certain parts of the
world, the virus may spread through the handling
and consumption of infected wild animal meat.
Patients with the disease can easily infect
healthcare workers without proper infection con-
trol practices.
Clinical manifestations usually appear from
8 to 10 days though they may vary from 2 to
21 days after contact with the virus. There can
be two distinct groups of symptoms designated as
wet and dry symptoms. Diarrhoea and vomiting
are common among the wet symptoms, while dry
symptoms initially present as fever, aches and
pains, and fatigue and then progresses to wet
symptoms. Primary signs and symptoms of
Ebola often present as fever, body ache, fatigue,
bleeding
manifestations,
gastrointestinal
symptoms, etc.
Laboratory diagnosis of EVD sooner after
infection can be difﬁcult. To justify whether
EVD is a possible diagnosis, there must be a
combination of symptoms and possible exposure
to EVD within 21 days before the onset of
symptoms. If a person shows signs of EVD and
has had a possible exposure, he or she should be
isolated, and public health authorities should be
notiﬁed. Blood samples from the patient should
be collected. PCR is one of the most commonly
used diagnostic methods to detect a few virus
particles in small amounts of blood. Other

methods, based on the detection of antibodies an
EVD case produces to an infection, can then be
used to conﬁrm a patient’s exposure and infection
by the Ebola virus.
842
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
There are currently two drugs approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
treat EVD caused by the Ebola virus, species
Zaire ebolavirus, in adults and children. The ﬁrst
drug Inmazeb™is a combination of three mono-
clonal antibodies. The second drug Ebanga™is a
single
monoclonal
antibody.
Monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) are proteins that act like natu-
ral antibodies to stop them from replicating in an
infected person. These particular mAbs binds to a
portion of the Ebola virus’s surface called the
glycoprotein and prevent it from entering a
person’s cells. However, neither of the drugs
have been evaluated for efﬁcacy against species
other than Zaire ebolavirus. Even if treatments are
not available, supportive care can signiﬁcantly
improve chances of survival when provided
early. These provide ﬂuids and electrolytes, con-
stant monitoring of blood pressure, and fever and
pain management.
The general preventive measures against
EVD are to avoid contact with blood and body
ﬂuids of infected person contact with their per-
sonal items or hospital items in common use. It is
advisable to avoid funeral or burial practices that
involve touching the body of the infected. Con-
tact with suspected animals should also be
avoided. Those dealing with Ebola management
in outbreaks should monitor their health for
21 days after returning from outbreak areas and
seek medical care immediately if they develop
symptoms of EVD.
Ebola Vaccine: In 2019, The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the
Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, which is the ﬁrst
FDA-approved vaccine for Ebola. This vaccine is
given as a single dose and is safe and protective
against Zaire ebolavirus, which has caused the
largest and most deadly Ebola outbreaks to date.
On February 26, 2020, the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended
pre-exposure
prophylaxis
vaccination
with
rVSV-ZEBOV for adults 18 years of age in
the U.S. population at potential occupational
risk of exposure to Zaire ebolavirus. This recom-
mendation includes adults who are at risk of
infection, like laboratory personnel, healthcare
personnel or those involved or likely to be
involved in Ebola outbreak management.
Bunyaviridae Viruses
Bunyaviridae
viruses
are
large,
spherical
(80–120 nm in diameter) and have a triple-
segmented and a single-stranded RNA. They
have a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an
envelope. They replicate in the cytoplasm, and
the assembly of the virion occurs by budding on
the smooth membrane of the Golgi system.
Bunyaviridae
viruses
consist
of
more
than
200 viruses. Based on structural and biochemical
properties, they are classiﬁed into four genera:
Bunyavirus,
Hantavirus,
Nairovirus
and
Phlebovirus.
All
these
viruses,
except
for
hantaviruses, are arboviruses that are transmitted
by mosquitoes, ticks and ﬂies. The hantaviruses,
however, are transmitted by rodents.
1. Genus
Bunyavirus
includes
more
than
150 members, including the La Crosse virus,
California encephalitis virus and Chittoor
virus. These three viruses are related antigeni-
cally and produce similar clinical diseases.
Mosquitoes transmit these viral infections.
2. Genus
Nairovirus
includes
six
members
consisting of Nairobi sheep disease virus,
Ganjam
virus
and
Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Haemaphysalis
ticks transmit all these viruses. Nairoviruses
are primarily pathogenic for sheep. They
cause infection in sheep and are responsible
for mortality and morbidity, causing a severe
economic loss for the farmers. CCHF virus is
the most important Nairovirus, which causes
CCHF in humans. Ganjam virus is a related
virus that causes infection of sheep and goats
in Odisha, India. The virus has also been
isolated from humans closely related to the
Nairobi sheep disease virus.
3. Genus
Phlebovirus
includes
more
than
36 members, including sandﬂy (Phlebotomus)

Nairovirus
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and Nairobi sheep disease
Hantavirus
Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (Sin Nombre virus), shock, pulmonary oedema
fever virus and Rift Valley fever virus. Differ-
ent arthropods transmit these viruses, such as
ticks, sandﬂies and mosquitoes.
As the name suggests, the sandﬂy fever virus
or pappataci fever virus is transmitted by female
species of sandﬂy Phlebotomus papatasi. The
sandﬂy fever virus has 20 serotypes, of which
only ﬁve cause human disease. These are Sicilian,
Naples, PantaToro, Chagrss and Candine.
Rift Valley fever virus is a primary pathogen
of sheep and other domestic animals. This fever
was originally described in Rift Valley, Kenya,
and hence was designated as Rift Valley fever.
Humans are secondarily infected on contact with
infected sheep and other domestic animals.
Humans acquire the infection from these reservoir
animals through mosquito bites. Diseases caused
by Bunyaviridae viruses
are listed in the
Table 58.4.
Morphology
Bunyaviridae virus is surrounded by an envelope
that contains two glycoproteins, G1 and G2. The
capsule encloses three unique negative RNAs
(large, L; medium, M; and small, S) that are
associated with proteins to form nucleocapsid.
Unlike other negative-stranded RNA viruses, the
Bunyaviridae viruses do not have any matrix
protein. They replicate in the cytoplasm of the
infected cell similar to that of other enveloped
and negative-stranded viruses.
Pathogenesis of Bunyaviridae Virus
Infections
Bunyaviridae viruses can infect humans and
arthropods. Bite by an arthropod vector, such as
mosquito, transmits the infection to humans. The
virus from the site of infection spreads to the
blood causing initial viraemia, which may mani-
fest in ﬂu-like symptoms. Further dissemination
of the viruses during the phase of secondary
viraemia may allow the viruses to reach target
sites, such as the liver, kidney, vascular endothe-
lium and CNS. In the CNS, many viruses cause
neural and glial damage and cerebral oedema,
leading
to
encephalitis.
Other
Bunyaviridae
viruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus, may
cause
hepatic
infection,
whereas
hantana
haemorrhagic disease and CCHF viruses cause
haemorrhagic tissue destruction accompanied by
haemorrhagic necrosis of the kidney.
Immunity
Infection by Bunyaviridae viruses leads to the
development of both antibodies and cell-mediated
immunities. The antibody-mediated immunity
may control viraemia, whereas the cell-mediated
immunity and interferon may prevent the further
spread of the infection.
Clinical Syndromes
Bunyaviruses usually cause a non-speciﬁc febrile
ﬂu-like illness indistinguishable from illness
caused by other viruses. The incubation period
is usually short (48 h), and the fever lasts approx-
imately 3 days.
California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus
and Rift Valley fever cause encephalitis. The
condition begins with a sudden onset after an
incubation period of nearly 1 week. Fever, leth-
argy, headache and vomiting are the common
symptoms. Seizers usually occur in nearly half
of the patients with encephalitis. The condition

may be associated with meningitis. The illness
lasts for approximately 7 days. The condition is
fatal in less than 1% of patients.
844
58
Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
The sandﬂy fever has an incubation period of
3–5 days, after which the patients develop head-
ache, malaise, fever and nausea, which last for
3–4 days. CCHF and Rift Valley fever viruses
cause haemorrhagic fever. The condition is
characterised by petechial haemorrhage, ecchy-
mosis, haematemesis and melena. Death occurs
in
75%
of
patients
with
haemorrhagic
manifestations.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Serology
It is most important in the laboratory diagnosis of
Bunyaviridae virus infection. ELISA for demon-
stration of serum IgG or IgM antibodies is useful
for diagnosing bunyavirus infections. Demonstra-
tion of speciﬁc IgM antibodies in a single serum
or demonstration of a fourfold increase in the IgG
antibody titre indicates recent infection. IgM
ELISA is used for the serodiagnosis of infection
caused by hantaviruses. Demonstration of rising
titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in paired
sera is diagnostic of the disease. The ELISA for
demonstration of antigen in the blood is also
useful
for
diagnosing
patients
with
intense
viraemia,
observed
in
CCHF,
hantana
haemorrhagic disease with renal syndrome and
Rift Valley fever.
Molecular Detection
The molecular diagnosis is the recent method.
RT-PCR has been used to detect viral genomes
in the tissues during the infection caused by the
Sin Nombre and Convict Creek hantaviruses.
RT-PCR can be used to detect hantaviral RNA
in fresh frozen lung tissue, blood clots or nucle-
ated blood cells. However, RT-PCR is very prone
to cross-contamination, limiting its use for diag-
nosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing of
formalin-ﬁxed tissues with speciﬁc monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies can be used to detect
hantavirus antigens and has proven to be a
sensitive method for laboratory conﬁrmation of
hantaviral infections.
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral therapy is available for
bunyavirus infection.
Epidemiology
Most bunyaviruses are distributed in Africa,
South America, South-eastern Europe and south-
ern Asia. The sandﬂy fever is distributed in Med-
iterranean countries and Central Asia, including
India. These viruses are transmitted by arthropod
vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks or Phlebotomus
ﬂies to rodents, birds and larger animals, which
are the usual reservoirs of infection.
Humans acquire infection from the reservoir
animals by arthropod vectors. The arthropods
transmit the infection by biting on the skin.
Aedes mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting
the California encephalitis virus and La Crosse
virus. Flies, such as sandﬂy, transmit the Rift
Valley fever virus and the sandﬂy fever virus.
Ticks are the vectors for CCHF.
The incidence of the disease caused by
bunyaviruses correlates well with the distribution
of vectors. The disease is more common during
the summer months.
Prevention and Control
Avoidance of close contact of humans with
arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks or
Phlebotomus ﬂies, prevents transmission of infec-
tion caused by bunyaviruses. Arthropod vector
control measures include the use of insecticides,
wearing protective gloves and clothing, use of net
and screens and control of tick infestation of
animals.
Control
of
the
rodent
population
minimises the transmission of infection caused
by hantaviruses.

Ungrouped Arboviruses
845
Rodent-borne Bunyaviridae Viruses
The genus Hantavirus consists of 4 species,
namely (1) Hantaan virus, which causes severe
haemorrhagic fever with renal failure and is prev-
alent in North Asia and Soviet Russia; (2) a
milder form, Seoul virus prevalent worldwide;
(3) Puumala virus prevalent in Europe and
(4)
Prospect Hill virus
that
has
not
been
associated with human infections. This virus is
mainly associated with haemorrhagic fever with
renal symptoms.
The natural reservoirs of the virus are rodents,
mainly being the ﬁeld mice and rats. The virus is
shed in animals’ urine, faeces and oral secretions.
Among the risk factors, it is seen that
disturbing or inhabiting closed, actively rodent-
infested areas may be an important risk factor for
infections. Travel to areas where hantavirus infec-
tion has been reported is not a risk factor for
infection.
ELISA targeting IgM antibodies is used to
diagnose Hantavirus infections. An IgG test is
used in conjunction with the IgM capture test.
Hantaviruses are spherical viruses measuring
90–120 nm in diameter. They include the
Hantaan virus (Korean haemorrhagic fever),
Seoul virus and Sin Nombre virus. All these
viruses cause haemorrhagic fever with nephropa-
thy. These viruses are transmitted by close con-
tact with rodents, such as mice and rats and not by
arthropod vectors. Transmission of infection
occurs by inhalation of aerosolised excreta of
the rodents.
The hantavirus typically causes hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, a more serious disease
consisting of prodromal fever and muscle aches.
The condition progresses rapidly to interstitial
pulmonary oedema, respiratory failure and death
within a few days. The hantaviruses cause
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The
cases resemble those of leptospirosis and scrub
typhus.
Any
arthropod
vectors
do
not
transmit
hantaviruses. Humans are infected by close con-
tact with rodents or inhaling aerosolised rodent
urine.
A
newly
identiﬁed
hantavirus,
the
Sin
Nombre virus, is the causative agent of the han-
tavirus pulmonary syndrome, which was ﬁrst
identiﬁed in the United States in 1993. The infec-
tion is acquired by inhalation of aerosols of rodent
excreta. No arthropods are responsible for the
transmission of the disease.
Reoviridae
The family Reoviridae consists of four genera
(Orthovirus, Coltivirus, Orbivirus and Rotavi-
rus),
of
which
arthropods
transmit
only
orbiviruses. These viruses have a double-stranded
RNA genome by which they differ from other
arboviruses. Colorado tick-borne virus is the
only orbivirus that causes infection in humans.
The virus causes Colorado tick fever, transmitted
by the tick Dermacentor andersoni. The virus
causes natural infection in rodents. The disease
is restricted in its distribution to the western
United States. The virus causes a self-limiting
disease in humans. Kasba, Vellore and Palyam
are the arboviruses that have been isolated from
mosquitoes in India. Their association with the
disease in humans is yet to be ascertained.
Rhabdoviridae
The
genus
Vesiculovirus
of
the
family
Rhabdoviridae consists of the Chandipura virus,
which has been associated with human infection
in India. This is an arthropod-borne virus trans-
mitted by both sandﬂy and Aedes mosquito. The
virus was ﬁrst reported from Nagpur in 1967 from
patients’ blood during the epidemic of dengue
and Chikungunya fever. Their pathogenic role in
human disease is not known.
Ungrouped Arboviruses
Wanowrie Virus
This virus has been isolated from the brain of a
girl who died of a fever after 2 days in Sri Lanka.

The same virus has also been isolated from
Hyalomma ticks in India. Wanowrie virus causes
infections in both animals and humans with fever,
photophobia and meningitis, like symptoms in
humans. Other than symptomatic treatment, no
other virus-speciﬁc treatment is indicated.

Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne Viruses) and Rodent-borne Viruses
Bhanja Virus
Bhanja virus has been isolated from goats in
Ganjam (Odisha) from India. The same virus
has been shown to be associated with human
infection reported from Yugoslavia. It is a tick-
borne
virus
ﬁrst
discovered
in
a
tick
(Haemaphysalis intermedia). Usually, the Bhanja
virus is not known to be transmitted between
humans. Human infections cause febrile illness
with
symptoms,
including
photophobia,
vomiting, meningoencephalitis and slight or
partial
paralysis.
Symptomatic
treatment
is
advocated for the infection.
Case Study
There was an outbreak of JE in and around Tamil
Nadu a few years back. As a preventive measure
to stop further dissemination of the disease, rural
people engaged in pig farming were advised to be
away from pig herds and measures were initiated
for control of mosquito population.

Rhabdoviruses
59
Rabies virus is the most important member of the
Rhabdoviridae family, which causes disease in
humans. The family Rhabdoviridae is classiﬁed
into two genera: Lyssavirus and Vesiculovirus.
The genus Lyssavirus consists of more than
80 viruses and includes a rabies serogroup
consisting of 10 viruses, including the classic
rabies virus. The rabies virus is the prototypical
human
Lyssavirus
pathogen.
Other
viruses
included
in
this
group
are
Mokola
virus,
Duvenhage virus, Obodhiang virus, Kotonkan
virus,
Rochambeau
virus,
European
bat
Lyssavirus types 1 and 2 and Australian bat
Lyssavirus. These viruses rarely cause human
disease. The genus Vesiculovirus includes vesic-
ular stomatitis virus and other viruses infecting
vertebrates and invertebrates.
Rabies Virus
Rabies virus causes rabies, a viral infection of the
central and peripheral nervous systems that
causes encephalitis with or without paralysis. It
is the most fatal infection in humans.
Morphology
Rabies virus is a bullet-shaped virus with one end
rounded or conical and the other end planar
or concave (Fig. 59.1). It is a negative-sense,
non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus mea-
suring approximately 60  180 nm. It is com-
posed of an internal protein core or nucleocapsid
containing the nucleic acid. It also consists of an
outer envelope, a lipid-containing bilayer covered
with trans membrane glycoprotein spikes. The
nucleocapsid shows helical symmetry containing
a
linear
negative-sense
RNA
with
an
RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase.

The rabies virus genome is unsegmented. The
genome encodes for the production of ﬁve
proteins the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex
or
the
viral
envelope.
The
RNA
complex
constitutes viral RNA along with N (nucleopro-
tein), L (transcriptase) and NS (transcriptase-
associated)
proteins.
These
proteins
are
aggregated together in the cytoplasm of virus-
infected neurons and constitute Negri bodies,
the typical histopathological ﬁnding of rabies
virus infection. The lipid envelope contains M
(matrix) and G (glycoprotein). The G proteins
are the projections present on the outer surface
of the virion envelope. It is the only rabies viral
protein that can induce neutralising antibodies
against this virus.
Antigenic Properties
Rabies viruses of humans and animals are of a
single antigenic type. Rabies virus contains the
following antigens:

848
59
Rhabdoviruses
Fig. 59.1 A schematic
diagram of rabies virus
The glycoprotein or G protein is present on
the surface spikes present on the outer lipoprotein
envelope of the virion. It mediates the attachment
of the virus to the acetylcholine receptors of neu-
ral tissues. The G protein is important in the
pathogenesis and virulence of the virus. It is
strongly antigenic and elicits the production of
neutralising antibodies, which are protective.
It
also
induces
haemagglutination-inhibiting
antibodies and stimulates cell-mediated immu-
nity. G protein is a serotype-speciﬁc antigen.
Nucleoprotein or N protein is a group-speciﬁc
antigen. It shows cross-reaction with some rabies-
related viruses. It is antigenic and produces
antibodies that are not protective but of diagnostic
value. These antibodies can be demonstrated by
serological tests, such as the immunoﬂuorescence
(IF) test for the purpose of diagnosis.
Other antigens include membrane proteins
glycolipid
and
RNA-dependent
RNA
polymerase.
Other Properties
Rabies virus possesses haemagglutinating prop-
erty. The virus agglutinates goose erythrocytes at
0–4 C and pH 6.2.
Virus Susceptibility
Rabies virus is sensitive to ethanol, iodine, soap,
quaternary ammonium compounds, detergents,
ether, chloroform, acetone, etc. It is inactivated
by formalin, phenol, beta-propiolactone, ultravio-
let radiation and sunlight. It can be inactivated at
50 C for 1 h or at 60 C for 5 min. It can also be


inactivated on exposure to CO2. The virus is
resistant to drying and cold. It survives at 4 C
for weeks; hence viruses can be preserved by
storing at
70 C or by lyophilisation.
Rabies Virus
849
Typing of Rabies Viruses
Rabies viruses may be typed as ﬁxed or street
viruses. Fixed viruses are so-called because they
show a ﬁxed incubation period of 6–7 days. This
occurs due to several passages in these isolated
viruses in laboratory animals or cell cultures. The
street viruses are those viruses that are isolated
from
natural
human
and
animal
infections
and
show
a
variable
incubation
period
of
1–12 weeks. Differences between ﬁxed and street
viruses are summarised in Table 59.1.
Typing of street viruses helps identify viral
variants originating in major host reservoirs
worldwide. This is also useful to suggest the
likely sources of human exposure when a history
of the deﬁnitive animal bite was otherwise miss-
ing from a patient’s case history. The monoclonal
antibodies and genetic sequencing are now used
to differentiate and type street rabies viruses.
Laboratory Isolation
Chick Embryo
The rabies virus grows in the yolk sac of the chick
embryo. The rabies vaccine strains, such as Flury
and Kelev strains, are grown in the yolk sac.
Tissue Culture
The rabies virus can grow in several primary and
continuous cell cultures. These are WI-38, BHK
(baby hamster kidney)-21 and chick embryo-
related (CER) chick embryo ﬁbroblast and por-
cine, mouse, or hamster kidney cell lines. The
ﬁxed virus strains are adapted to grow in vero
and human diploid cell lines. The cytopathic
effect produced by the virus in the cell lines is
minimal.

Laboratory Animals
The mouse is the animal of choice. The intracere-
bral route is the frequently used route of infection.
Intracerebral inoculation causes encephalitis, and
the inoculated mouse die within 5–30 days.
Pathogenesis of Rabies
Rabies virus has a broad host range. The virus can
infect all mammals, although certain mammals
(such as dogs, foxes, wolves and bats) are impor-
tant for transmitting infection.
The virus is excreted in the saliva of infected
dogs,
foxes,
wolves,
jackals,
vampire
bats,
raccoons and skunks. Bite of a rabid dog or other
infected animals is the main route of transmission
of infection. Contacting saliva with broken skin or
mucous membranes, exposure to aerosolised
secretions from an infected animal and corneal
transplant is a rare and uncommon transmission.
The virus may enter the peripheral nervous system
directly at the site of the bite. In some cases, after
virus entry, replication occurs in muscle tissue at
the same site or adjacent to the site of entry during
the incubation period. The virus infects the sen-
sory neurons and moves rapidly by axonal trans-
port centripetally to the central nervous system
(CNS) for replication. Rabies virus replicates in
the cytoplasm of the infected cell.

850
59
Rhabdoviruses
It is protected from the host immune system
during its transport within the neurons. To gain its
entry into the spinal ganglion, the virus spreads
along the axons at a rate of 12–24 mm/day and
multiplies there, which is marked by the onset of
pain or paraesthesia at the site of the entry earliest
and characteristic symptoms. From here, the virus
travels faster and reaches the CNS at a speed of
200–400 mm/day, and the spread is indicated by
rapidly progressive encephalitis. Finally, the virus
reaches
the
periphery
and
salivary
glands
(Fig. 59.2).
Clinical Syndromes
Rabies virus causes rabies, the most fatal infec-
tion in humans. No speciﬁc ant rabies agents are
useful once clinical signs or symptoms develop.
Rabies
In general, four stages of rabies are recognised in
humans. These are incubation, pro-dromal period,
acute neurologic period and coma, leading to
death.
The incubation period ranges from 20 to
90 days. It rarely can be as long as 19 years. In
more than 90% of cases, incubation is less than
1 year. During incubation, the virus travels from
peripheral areas to the CNS. The patients remain
asymptomatic during the period. When the
patient presents with bites on the head or neck
or if there are deposition of heavy inoculum
through multiple bites, large or deep wounds,
the incubation period is less than 50 days. The
symptoms of rabies develop later in a person with
a scratch in hand than in a person who is bitten on
the head. During this period, there is no antibody
response as the virus is masked from the immune
system.

The
virus
enters
the
CNS
during
the
pro-dromal period. The duration of this period is
2–10 days. Non-speciﬁc symptoms and signs
characterise the period. Pain or paraesthesia
develops at the inoculation site and is characteris-
tic of rabies. During this phase, paraesthesia
may be seen in 50% of cases, which may be
the
patient’s
only
presenting
sign.
Other
symptoms may include fever, chills, headache,
anorexia, malaise, pharyngitis, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea, anxiety, agitation, lack of sleep and
depression.
An acute neurologic period is associated with
objective signs of developing CNS disease. The
period lasts for 2–7 days and may manifest as
furious rabies or paralytic rabies.


Rabies Virus
851
Patients
develop
hyperactivity,
agitation,
restlessness,
biting,
thrashing,
confusion,
or
hallucinations in the stage of furious rabies.
After several hours to days, these symptoms are
episodic and are alternative with calm, coopera-
tive, lucid periods. Furious episodes remain not
more than 5 min. The triggers of these episodes
are visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. They may
be sometimes spontaneous. Seizures may also be
present. The pathognomonic signs are hydropho-
bia and aerophobia. If there is an attempt to drink
or the air is blown in the face, severe spasms of
the larynx or diaphragm and choking sensations
are produced. This may be due to a violent
response of the airway irritant mechanisms.
Hydrophobic spasm is induced even when the
patient is suggested to drink.
Autonomic instability is observed, including
fever, tachycardia, hyperventilation, hyperten-
sion, drooling of saliva, anisocoria, lacrimation,
salivation, perspiration, mydriasis and postural
hypotension. Other neurologic signs include cra-
nial nerve involvement with diplopia, facial palsy
and optic neuritis. This phase may lead to a car-
diorespiratory arrest or may advance to paralysis.
Paralytic rabies is otherwise known as dumb
rabies or apathetic rabies because the patient is
relatively quiet compared to a person with the
furious form. Paralysis develops from the outset.
Paralysis is symmetric and may be either general-
ised or ascending and mistaken for Guillain–
Barré syndrome. Calmness and clarity gradually
deteriorate to stupor, delirium and then coma.

neural tissue ( 1000)

Nucleus of the
neuron
The patient may go into a coma within 10 days
of onset, but the duration is variable. Coma leads
to respiratory failure within a week of neurologic
symptoms. Hypoventilation and metabolic acido-
sis predominate. Acute respiratory distress syn-
drome is common. Without intensive supportive
care, respiratory depression, arrest and death
occur shortly after coma. Despite intensive sup-
portive care, most cases result in death within
14 days because of complications. Recovery is
very unlikely. A few reports indicate that those
patients who survived had pre-exposure or post-
exposure prophylaxis supported by the most
advanced life-support system.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Saliva, serum, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), blood,
urine and skin and brain biopsy are the frequently
used specimens for diagnosis of rabies.
Microscopy
Demonstration of Negri bodies by microscopy is
the characteristic histopathological feature of
rabies (Fig. 59.3). Impression smears of the
human brain tissue collected at post-mortem are
stained by Seller technique for demonstration of

Negri bodies. The stain contains methylene blue
alcohol as a ﬁxative and basic fuchsin as a
staining reagent. This is still a useful method in
the laboratories lacking facilities for cell culture
and antigen detection methods.
852
59
Rhabdoviruses
Negri bodies are made up of a ﬁnely ﬁbrillar
matrix and rabies virus particles. They appear as
intracytoplasmic, round or oval, purplish-pink
structures with characteristic basophilic inner
granules on staining by Seller technique. They
measure 3–27 μm in size. They are found in the
neural tissues and are found more in the
cerebellum and hippocampus (Purkinje cells of
the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the
Ammons horn, of the cerebellum). They are not
found in non-neural tissues, such as corneal
specimens, saliva, or skin. Post-mortem diagnosis
is made by demonstrating Negri bodies in most
human cases of rabies. Nevertheless, failure to
demonstrate Negri bodies in neural tissue does
not rule out the diagnosis of rabies.
Viral Antigen Detection
Viral antigens can be demonstrated in the corneal
smear, skin biopsy collected from the face or neck
and saliva (antemortem) or in the brain tissue
(post-mortem) for diagnosis of rabies. Direct ﬂuo-
rescent antibody (DFA) test using speciﬁc mono-
clonal
antibodies
is
a
speciﬁc
method
to
demonstrate rabies antigen in clinical specimens.
Cell Culture
Isolation of virus in cell lines (WI-38, BHK-21
and CER) is a sensitive method. The cytopathic
effect produced by the virus is minimal; hence,
the presence of the virus in the inoculated cell
cultures is made by demonstration of viral antigen
within 2–4 days. The DFA test using monoclonal
rabies antibodies tagged with ﬂuorescein isothio-
cyanate is a frequently used speciﬁc method to
demonstrate the antigen.
Serology
Rabies antibodies are found in the serum and the
CSF of human cases. A high titre of antibodies is
found in the CSF. Antibodies in the serum are
demonstrated by a rapid ﬂuorescent focus inhibi-
tion test titre which gives positivity in 50% of
cases. In the cerebrospinal ﬂuid, positive antibody
titres (2–25% of serum titre) are found at the end
of the ﬁrst week of infection.
Molecular Detection
A polymerase chain reaction is being increasingly
evaluated for the diagnosis of rabies. The nucleic
acid sequence-based ampliﬁcation (NASBA) on
saliva and CSF can be used for rapid diagnosis as
early as 2 days after symptom onset. The NASBA
technique on urine samples may be used in the
future.
Ante-mortem Diagnosis of Human Rabies
Rabies infections are always fatal. But with inten-
sive support care and better management of
patients,
few
cases
have
survived.
Corneal
smears, skin biopsy from the nape of the neck or
face and saliva are the usual specimens. Diagno-
sis is made by demonstrating rabies virus antigen
by IF or the viral DNA by molecular methods.
The NASBA method on saliva and CSF can be
used for rapid diagnosis as early as 2 days after
symptom onset.
Treatment
No
speciﬁc
antirabies
agent
is
available.
Although rabies was considered to be invariably
fatal until recently, it has been demonstrated that
complete recovery can occur from established
rabies with intensive supportive care and manage-
ment of complications.
Epidemiology
Rabies
is
a
recognised
zoonotic
disease
worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Rabies is a zoonotic disease. Dogs are the impor-
tant reservoir of infection. Other animal reservoirs
include silver-haired bats, eastern pipistrella,
raccoons, skunks, foxes, cats, ferrets, cattle,
opossums, fowl, etc. Foxes are more infectious
than dogs and other animals because larger

amounts of virus (up to 106 infectious doses/mL)
are present in their saliva.
Rabies Virus
853
Rabies
has
been
recognised
for
over
4000 years. Today, it is found in most countries,
except many Australian islands, Great Britain,
Japan, Hawaii and most Caribbean islands. The
risk of rabies is highest in countries with hyper-
endemic canine rabies, including most of Asia,
Africa and Latin America.
Rabies is endemic in India. It has been
estimated that more than 30,000 people die of
rabies in India every year. More than 70,000
people in India receive ant rabies vaccination
per year. With a dog population of over 16 mil-
lion, the problem of rabies is huge. The virus is
usually transmitted from a rabid animal to
humans, mostly by bites or other forms of trau-
matic contact.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Dogs are the important reservoir of infection.
Other animal reservoirs include silver-haired
bats, eastern pipistrella, raccoons, skunks, foxes,
cats, ferrets, cattle, opossums, fowl, etc. Foxes are
more infectious than dogs and other animals
because larger amounts of virus (up to 106 infec-
tious doses/mL) are present in their saliva.
The virus is excreted in the saliva of infected
dogs, foxes, wolves, jackals, vampire bats,
raccoons and skunks. The virus is found in the
salivary gland of these infected animals. Infected
saliva or infected CNS tissue, including corneal
transplants in humans, are the sources of infec-
tion. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans
by the bite of a rabid dog or other infected
animals. Contact of saliva with broken skin or
mucous membranes, exposure to aerosolised
secretions from an infected animal and contact
with unpasteurised milk from dairies are very
uncommon modes of transmission.
Corneal Transplants
Eight recipients of transplanted corneas are the
only documented cases of rabies in case of
human-to-human transmission. Presently, donor
corneas are rejected if they die of encephalitis that
may be consistent with rabies. In India, few such
cases have also been documented. Except for
corneal transplants, man-to-man infection is rare.
Rabies in Dogs
Rabies in dogs can present as a sudden change in
behaviour with irritability and restlessness gradu-
ally progressing to aggressiveness. Other signs
like excessive drooling, difﬁculty in swallowing,
seizures might be seen with the progression of the
disease. The usual incubation period is 21 days to
42 days but can extend up to a year. Rabid dogs
can shed the virus in their saliva in 60% of the
cases. However, once symptoms set in, rabid
dogs hardly survive long and die within a week.
The manifestations of the disease can take either
of the two courses, namely furious rabies and
dumb rabies. In furious rabies, the dog runs
uncontrollably in any direction, biting anyone
without provocation, excessive drooling with
jaw drooping is seen followed by convulsions
and death. This is the more common form. In
dumb rabies, paralysis sets in quickly, and the
animal limits itself to some secluded place.
Though unprovoked biting is not seen, feeding
the animal forcibly can lead to biting.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Rabies in Dogs
and other Animals
It is useful to assess the risk of infection and
monitor post-exposure prophylaxis in humans
bitten by the animals.
Demonstration of Negri Bodies
The dead animal’s brain is the specimen of
choice. The brain is collected carefully from the
dead animal. Part of the specimen is collected in
50% glycerol saline (preservative) to isolate the
virus. The other part of the brain, including the
hippocampus and cerebellum (abundant in Negri
bodies), is collected in Zenkers ﬁxative to dem-
onstrate Negri bodies. Demonstration of Negri
bodies
by
microscopy
is
the
characteristic
histopathological feature of rabies (Fig. 59.3).
But, failure to demonstrate Negri bodies in neural
tissue does not rule out the diagnosis of rabies.
Impression smears of the human brain tissue
collected at post-mortem are stained by Seller
technique for demonstration of Negri bodies.

Type of contact
The stain contains methylene blue alcohol as a
ﬁxative and basic fuchsin as a staining reagent.
854
59
Rhabdoviruses
Direct Antigen Detection
Demonstration of viral antigens in the infected
brain tissue and the saliva of the animal by DFA
is a useful method for diagnosing rabies in
animals. Detection of antigen in the saliva
shows whether the animal was excreting the
virus in the saliva or not.
Isolation of the Virus
In a reference laboratory, viruses can be isolated
from animal brain tissue and saliva by culture in
cell lines or animals, as described earlier for diag-
nosis of human rabies.
Prevention and Control
Depending upon whether given before or after
exposure, speciﬁc prophylaxis in rabies can be
discussed as pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-
exposure prophylaxis.
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis
Pre-exposure prophylaxis is given to persons at
high risk, such as dog handlers, other animal
handlers and veterinarians. This is achieved
using cell culture vaccines, which are safer.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis requires three doses of
cell culture vaccines, given on days 0, 7 and 21 or
28, both by intradermal or intramuscular route. A
booster dose is recommended after 1 year and
then one dose every year.

immediate preventive actions are taken up,
which
consist
of
local
treatment,
passive
immunisation
with
rabies
immunoglobulin
and active immunisation with the antirabies
vaccine.
Local Treatment
Animal bites deposit the virus in the wounds. The
wound should be immediately scrubbed with
soap and water followed by treatment with qua-
ternary ammonium compounds, such as cetavlon,
tincture, or an aqueous solution of iodine or
alcohol.
Passive Immunisation with Rabies
Immunoglobulin
It is done by administering puriﬁed equine rabies
immune globulin (ERIG) and human rabies
immune globulin (HRIG). Administration of
HRIG is promptly made to ensure passive
immunisation against rabies. The recommended
dose of HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight. Fifty
percent of the dose is given into the wound and
50% intramuscularly. It is usually given before or
simultaneously with the ﬁrst dose of the rabies
vaccine. It is not given after injection of rabies
vaccine. The recommendations for using RIG are
for all type III exposures and for bites due to any
wild animal. The classiﬁcations for the category
of exposures required for post-exposure prophy-
laxis are presented in Table 59.2.

Antirabies Vaccine
Rabies is the only disease where post-exposure
vaccination is employed extensively and success-
fully. This is due to the long incubation period
of the disease. The chances of preventing
rabies are more when vaccination is given to
humans as early as possible after exposure. In
the past neural vaccines were used. Currently,
the neural vaccine has been abandoned because
of many complications and the availability of
cheaper vaccines.
In 1971, Sikes, Koprowsky, Kaplan et al.
developed the ﬁrst cell culture vaccine (human
diploid cell) for rabies. They demonstrated effec-
tive protection of monkeys against death from the
street virus by post-exposure administration of
tissue culture vaccine. Tissue culture vaccine is
prepared by growing Pitman-Moore ﬁxed rabies
strain on human diploid cells (WI 38 or MRC).
Further,
it
is
puriﬁed,
concentrated
and
inactivated with beta-propiolactonen or n-butyl
phosphate. This vaccine is highly immunogenic
and devoid of serious adverse effects, but this
vaccine is costlier than other available vaccines.
To overcome the cost burden of tissue culture
vaccines,
equally
efﬁcient
and
economical
vaccines are now available in India. These
include commercially available puriﬁed chick
embryo cell vaccines (PCECV), puriﬁed duck
embryo vaccine (PDEV), Human diploid cell vac-
cine (HDC), puriﬁed vero cell rabies vaccine
(PCECV),
and
chromatographically
puriﬁed
rabies vaccine (PVRV). All these vaccines are
equally effective and safe. The dosage schedule
is the same for children and adults. These are
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the
deltoid region in adults and on the anterolateral
side of the thigh in children. Post-exposure pro-
phylaxis requires a course of ﬁve to six doses,
starting as soon as possible.

Experimental stages
Rabies virus surface possesses glycoprotein
subunit vaccine is available which is protective
in nature. This gene was cloned, and proteins
were used for vaccine preparation. This vaccine
is still under trial. The list of such vaccines
with their advantages and disadvantages are
summarised in Table 59.3.
WHO Guidelines on Post-Exposure
Prophylaxis
The
WHO
recommends
three
intramuscular
regimens and one intradermal regimen as postex-
posure prophylaxis for rabies for category II and
II types of exposures. The ﬁrst one, ‘The 5-dose
intramuscular regime: (1-1-1-1-1)’ recommends
one dose of the vaccine to be administered on
days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 in the deltoid region in
adults and anterolateral thigh in children. This is
currently
the
only
intramuscular
regimen
recommended in India. The second one, ‘The
2-1-1 regimen: (2-0-1-0-1)’, recommends two
doses to be given on day 0 in the deltoid muscle,
right and left arm and an additional one dose to be
administered in the deltoid muscle on day seven
and day 21. The third regimen, ‘The 4-dose
regimen with RIG in both categories II and II’.
The intradermal regimen with the added advan-
tage of requiring less volume of vaccine, thus
affecting cost, is suitable for rural areas where
vaccine or money is in short supply. In this,
‘The 2-site intradermal method: (2–2–2-0-2)’ is
recommended where one dose of the vaccine of

0.1 ml is given intradermally at two different
lymphatic drainage sites like the deltoid muscle
on the left and right upper arm and suprascapular
area. This is given on days 0, 3, 7 and 28.

Red Cross Schedule
The modiﬁed red cross schedule incorporating the
elimination of the requirement of 90 days booster
dose has been revised in the updated Thai Red
Cross schedule. In this regimen, two injections of
0.1 mL of any WHO recommended tissue culture
rabies vaccine is to be given intradermally at two
sites on days 0, 3, 7 and 28. This regimen is also
strongly advocated by the NRCP.
Re-Exposure Prophylaxis
Vaccination with complete dosages gives virtu-
ally complete protection for at least 5 years. Dur-
ing this period of 5 years, if any further exposure
occurs, only one or two booster doses (on days
0, 3) may be given. After 5 years, a full course of
ﬁve injections is given if the patient is again
exposed to infection.
Animal Vaccines
Pre-exposure prophylaxis is recommended in
animals, and post-exposure prophylaxis is not of
use. As the neural vaccines are less immunogenic,
the animal requires multiple vaccination doses
(6 months once). Hence, puriﬁed, concentrated
cell culture vaccines with the inactivated virus
are recommended for animal vaccination. Cell
culture vaccine provides better protection follow-
ing a single dose of intramuscular injection. The
ﬁrst dose of this injection is usually administered
at 12 weeks of age, and a booster should be given
at every 1–3 years intervals.
Vaccine Failures
In vaccine failure cases, persons develop rabies
despite administering the full course of vaccina-
tion. Neural vaccine failures are quite high com-
pared to non-neural vaccine failures. In extremely
rare cases, even after administering an immediate
local treatment with rabies immunoglobulins
and a full dose of cell culture vaccine, dog
bite patients may develop rabies. It is always
recommended to have a complete course of
antirabies vaccination, even for individuals with
minimal risk of contracting rabies.
Of late, neural tissue vaccines are gradually
being replaced by cell culture vaccines that are
grown in human diploid cells and then inactivated
with propiolactone.
National Rabies Control Programme (NRCP)
It was initiated in India in 2013 to tackle the
endemicity of rabies in India. The programme
has both animal and human components, and it
lays down training and capacity building of
healthcare workers on appropriate management
of animal site including post-exposure prophy-
laxis and its implementation, strengthening sur-
veillance systems and regional laboratories for
accurate diagnosis and creating awareness in the
society through effective information, education
and communication as its objectives. Based on
recommendations
from
expert
groups
from
WHO, the prophylaxis regimen has been revised
and updated on a timely basis.
WHO
has
included
rabies
in
its
new
2021–2030 road map, owing to the huge burden
of deaths annually due to rabies worldwide. In
collaboration with FAO (Food and Agriculture
Organization) and OIE (World Organisation for
Animal Health), it has prioritised rabies under a
One Health approach and together has launched
‘United Against Rabies Forum’ (UAR), a multi-
stakeholder platform for global containment. The
drive has been undertaken towards “Zero human
deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030”
through
various
long-term
measures
at
the
national, regional and global levels.
Rabies-Related Viruses
The genus Lyssavirus consists of more than
80 viruses, including the rabies virus, which is
the prototypical human Lyssavirus pathogen.
Other viruses included in this group rarely cause
human disease. Lyssavirus of human importance
has
been
classiﬁed
into
seven
serotypes
(Table 59.4).

Mokola Virus
The virus is classiﬁed as Lyssavirus serotype 3.
The virus has been isolated from many domestic
and wild animals (shrew, cat and dog) in Africa. It
was ﬁrst reported from shrews in Africa in the
year 1968. Later, the virus was isolated from
animals in many European countries. The ﬁrst
report of human infection was from two children
with CNS infection.
The virus is classiﬁed as Lyssavirus serotype
2. The viruses have been reported from bats and
cats in Nigeria and Central Africa. The virus was
initially isolated in 1956 from the pooled brains of
frugivorous bats from Lagos Island, Nigeria. The
virus causes a rabies-like illness following intra-
cerebral inoculation in infected monkeys.
Other Rabies-Related Viruses
Other viruses, such as Rochambeau virus and
Australian bat Lyssavirus, have been reported to
cause occasional rabies-like fatal diseases in
humans. Obodhiang and Kotonkan viruses have
only been reported from mosquitoes in Sudan and
Ibadan. No human infection by these viruses has
been documented.
Case Study
A 35-year-old hunter from rural India came with a
sore throat and had trouble swallowing. The man
was treated as usual with antibiotics by a local
physician. That night, the man began to pace and
spit frequently, his facial muscles twitched
uncontrollably, and he became anxious and fear-
ful. He was hospitalised. Physicians thought he
might be suffering from a drug overdose or viral
encephalitis. Although he remained alert for sev-
eral days, he became increasingly agitated, he
vomited, his body temperature rose to 106 F,
and he died. His friend on enquiry revealed that

the victim had a tussle with a dog while he was
hunting 2 months ago.

Hepatitis Viruses
60
Hepatitis is a clinical syndrome caused by many
pathogens, including viruses. Viral hepatitis
denotes a primary infection caused by a heterolo-
gous group of hepatitis viruses. There are six
medically
important
viruses
called
hepatitis
viruses because their main site of infection is the
liver and cause clinically similar acute illnesses.
These viruses are hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepa-
titis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV),
hepatitis D virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus
(HEV) and the newly described G virus (HGV).
Although these viruses infect the liver as a
common target organ, they differ greatly in their
morphology, replication pattern and severity of
infection. Nomenclature and deﬁnitions of differ-
ent hepatitis viruses, antigens and antibodies are
listed in Table 60.1. Human infections associated
with
hepatitis
viruses
are
summarised
in
Table 60.2.
Types of Hepatitis Viruses
Hepatitis A virus (HAV): HAV causes infec-
tious hepatitis. The condition occurs mostly in
children and young adults. The infection is trans-
mitted primarily by the faecal-oral route through
faecally contaminated water.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Serum hepatitis is
caused by HBV. The parenteral route mainly
transmits the infection. This condition has been
found in people receiving blood or serum
transfusions.

859
The term non-A non-B (NANB) hepatitis
was used for the infectious and post-transfusion
hepatitis that was not caused either by type A
or type B. The term is not used nowadays
as it is possible to identify speciﬁc hepatitis
infections.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV): The virus was
identiﬁed as the major causative agent of non-A
non-B transfusion-associated hepatitis.
Hepatitis D virus (HDV): This is a defective
virus that relies on the helper functions of the
Type B virus. This virus is also called as delta
virus. It causes acute hepatitis.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV): The virus causes
hepatitis transmitted through the faecal-oral route.
Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)
Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) causes infectious hepa-
titis. This is a subclinical infection affecting
mostly children and young adults. The infection
is unique because it does not cause chronic dis-
ease or fatal disease. Chronic carrier state does
not occur with HAV infection.
Morphology
It is a small, non-enveloped RNA virus measuring
27–32 nm in size (Fig. 60.1). It is spherical with
icosahedral symmetry. It has a single-stranded,
positive-sense RNA genome. It was originally

designated as enterovirus, but it is recognised as a
prototype of Hepatovirus. The naked capsid is
more stable than other picornaviruses to acid
and other treatments.

Virus Antigens
HAV has only one serotype. The virus does not
show any antigenic relationship with hepatitis B
or other hepatitis viruses.
Virus Susceptibility
The virus is highly resistant. It is resistant to heat
at 60 C for 1 h, acidic pH (at pH 1.0) for 2 h, lipid
solvents, such as ether and chloroform, and dry-
ing. The virus is inactivated by formalin at 37 C
for 72 h, peracetic acid (2%) for 4 h and beta-
propiolactone
(0.25%)
for
1
h.
It
is
also
inactivated by exposure to ultraviolet radiation
(2 μW/cm2/min). The virus is inactivated by rou-
tine chlorine treatment (1 ppm for 30 min) of
drinking water.

Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)
861
Other Properties
The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the
infected cell. It has a replicative cycle similar to
that of other picornaviruses. However, unlike
other picorna viruses, it is not cytolytic and is
released by exocytosis.
Laboratory Isolation
Hepatitis A is the only hepatitis virus that can be
grown in human and simian cell cultures.
Pathogenesis of HAV Infection
HAV infection is acquired primarily by the
faecal-oral route and is associated with hepatic
injury. Most commonly, the virus spreads from
person to person through contaminated water and
food, including shellﬁsh collected from sewage-
contaminated water.
Fig. 60.2 Pathogenesis of HAV infection
The virus appears to replicate ﬁrst in the gas-
trointestinal tract and then spreads to the liver
(Fig. 60.2). The viruses in the liver infect
hepatocytes and cause damage to hepatocytes
resulting in hepatitis. However, the mechanism
by which HAV causes the cytopathic effect is
unknown. Cytotoxic T cells appear to cause dam-
age to hepatocytes; hence once the infection is
cleared, the cell damage is repaired, and no
chronic infection occurs. The classic ﬁndings in
the hepatocytes include mononuclear inﬁltrate,
ballooning,
degeneration
and
acidophilic
(Councilman-like) bodies. The liver pathology
caused by HAV cannot be distinguished histolog-
ically from that caused by other hepatitis viruses.

862
60
Hepatitis Viruses
Immunity
Host
immunity
is
mediated
primarily
by
circulating
antibodies.
Acute
infection
is
characterised by the appearance of IgM anti-
HAV, which is detectable at the time of appear-
ance of jaundice in the initial stage of infection.
However, the IgM antibody disappears several
months after jaundice. The IgG antibody appears
1–3
weeks
after
the
appearance
of
IgM
antibodies. IgG antibody appears to provide
lifelong
immunity
against
recurrent
HAV
infection.
Clinical Syndromes
HAV causes infectious hepatitis.
Infectious Hepatitis
A majority (90%) of the HAV infections in chil-
dren are subclinical. The incubation period is
15–45 days, with an average of 4 weeks. It is
relatively short compared to the long incubation
period
of
HBV
infection.
Fatigue,
nausea,
vomiting,
fever,
hepatomegaly,
jaundice,
anorexia and rash are the disease’s most common
signs and symptoms. The condition is also
associated with the passing of dark-coloured
urine, pale faeces and elevated serum transami-
nase levels. HAV infection is usually a self-
limiting mild disease and, in most cases, resolves
spontaneously in 2–4 weeks. HAV infection
confers lifelong immunity to HAV.
Chronic hepatitis or chronic carrier state does
not occur with HAV infection. The virus also
never causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute
hepatitis A is relatively more serious and has
higher mortality in adults than children. The
exact cause for this is unknown. Acute liver fail-
ure and cholestatic hepatitis are some of the rare
complications. The mortality caused by HAV is
very low, approximately 0.01%.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include (1) serum for serology anti-HAV
IgM antibody detection and liver function tests,
and (2) stool and blood for HAV antigen and
genome.
Microscopy
The virus is present in stools for 2 weeks prior to
the onset of jaundice and up to 2 weeks after the
onset of jaundice. The virus can be demonstrated
in
the
stool
during
this
period
using
immunoelectron microscopy. However, it is not
routinely used.
Cell Culture
Although the virus has been grown in human and
simian cell culture, its isolation by the culture of
faeces in the cell line is not routinely done.
Serology
ELISA is the method of choice for detecting IgM
anti-HAV and IgG anti-HAV antibodies in the
serum. IgM anti-HAV antibody is the ﬁrst anti-
body to appear at the onset of symptoms and
persist at a high level for 1–2 months. It usually
disappears by 4–6 months but occasionally
persists longer. Hence, demonstration of IgM
antibody is diagnostic of a recent infection. IgG
anti-HAV antibodies appear in the serum after
3–4 weeks of infection and persist for years. A
fourfold rise in IgG antibody titres is also diag-
nostic of infection. The demonstration of IgG
antibodies indicates the development of immu-
nity; hence it is used to assess the efﬁciency of
the vaccine.
Molecular Detection
DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) are used to demonstrate the HAV genome
in stool and the serum of infected patients.
Other Tests
Liver function tests are highly useful for
supplementing the diagnosis of HAV infection.

HAV infection is associated with a consistent
increase
in
serum
alanine
aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).
An increase in ALT and AST levels is nearly
4–100 times more than the normal levels. An
increase in ALT and AST serum levels are usu-
ally seen 1 week before. The ALT and AST
remain at peak level within 3–10 days after
the onset of clinical illness. Serum bilirubin
level is also increased, and it increases with
the appearance of jaundice. A decrease in
serum albumin level and prolongation of pro-
thrombin time indicates a severe hepatocellular
infection.
Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)
863
Treatment
No antiviral therapy is available against HAV
infection. Treatment of the condition is always
supportive.
Epidemiology
Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of
hepatitis in the world. HAV causes nearly
two-thirds of acute cases of hepatitis.
Geographical Distribution
Infection with HAV occurs throughout the world.
It is common in the developing countries of
Asia, Africa and Central and South America. A
high prevalence of HAV infection has been
documented in the Middle East. The infection is
more common in areas of low socioeconomic
status and poor sanitation. Several outbreaks of
HAV have been reported in India. Though a
majority
of
the
outbreaks
are
sporadically
associated with a contaminated common source
of water, there has been a recent change in the
epidemiology of HAV in the Indian scenario. An
increased number of infections is now being
noted in the adult and adolescent population, not
children.
The
epidemiological
link
between
improved standard of living and decrease in
HAV cases has also been noted in India.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Infected humans are the reservoirs and are the
important source of infection. The virus is
excreted in the stool during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of
infection, prior to the onset of symptoms; hence
the quarantine of patients is not useful. The
infected
children
and
adults
appear
to
be
non-infectious after the appearance of jaundice.
Humans infected with HAV are the important
reservoir of infection. Infection is transmitted pri-
marily by the faecal-oral route. Most commonly,
the virus spreads from person to person through
contaminated water and food, including shellﬁsh
collected
from
sewage-contaminated
water
(Fig. 60.3). This results in sporadic outbreaks of
infection in the community. The virus is not
transmitted by blood or blood products because
the level of viremia in HAV is low and chronic
infection does not occur.
International travellers to areas endemic for
HAV, drug addicts using injectable drugs and
homosexual men are at high-risk for HAV infec-
tion. Close contacts of infected individuals are
also at high-risk. Infection is not transmitted
from infected mothers to neonates. Secondary
infection occurs at a high rate in household
contacts of acute HAV (20%). It is the most
common cause of acute hepatitis in children in
India in developing countries. HAV is responsi-
ble for 10–30% of acute hepatitis and 5–15% of
acute liver failure cases in India. In developed
countries,
infection
occurs
most
commonly
amongst adults.
Prevention and Control
Prevention
of
HAV
infection
depends
on
(1) vaccines, (2) speciﬁc passive prophylaxis,
and (3) general prevention measures.
Vaccines
Active immunisation with vaccines containing
formalin-inactivated and alum conjugated HAV
is available. The vaccine is prepared from HAV
cultured in human diploid cell culture. The vac-
cine is highly efﬁcacious and safe. It is given in

two intramuscular doses; an initial dose followed
by a second dose after 6–12 months. No booster
dose is given. The vaccine is recommended for
children above 2 years, travellers to an endemic
area, and food handlers. Twinrix is another
vaccine
containing
inactivated
HAV
and
non-infectious surface antigen of HBV. The
recombinant vaccine administered through the
intramuscular route is used to immunise against
both HAV and HBV.

Specific Passive Prophylaxis
It consists of administration of IgG-containing
anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin to contacts
within 2 weeks of exposure or before exposure.
The immunoglobulin is given in a dose of
0.02 mL administered intramuscularly in a
single dose. Speciﬁc passive prophylaxis is
recommended for household contacts of infected
patients and contacts in the child-care centre dur-
ing outbreaks.
General Prevention Measures
These consist of handwashing, drinking of safe
drinking water and good personal hygiene and
sanitation. All these contribute to the prevention
of the faecal-oral spread of infection of HAV.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus, is a major
cause of infectious hepatitis worldwide. The virus
usually causes chronic disease and is associated
with hepatocellular carcinoma.
The term serum hepatitis was used after an
outbreak of hepatitis amongst American soldiers
in 1942. The cause of the outbreak was linked to
the yellow fever vaccine that was given to the
soldiers, which was contaminated by human
serum.
Blumberg
and
co-workers
in
1965
described the Australia antigen, recovered from
aborigins, for which he was awarded the Nobel

prize. The name Australia antigen was later called
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
865
Morphology
Hepatitis B virus virion is a spherical and
enveloped DNA virus showing icosahedral sym-
metry. It is a double-walled, spherical structure
and measures 42 nm in diameter. By electron
microscopy, three types of particles can be seen
in the serum from patients with hepatitis B. The
ﬁrst type is the spherical particles measuring
22 nm in diameter. The second type is the ﬁla-
mentous or tubular particles with a diameter of
22 nm and varying length. These two particles are
antigenically identical and are known as hepatitis
B surface antigen, or Beathard type is the double-
walled, spherical structures measuring 42 nm in
diameter. This article is a complete hepatitis viral
particle. It was ﬁrst demonstrated in human serum
by D.S. Dane in 1970 and so is known as Dane
particle (Fig. 60.4).
The HBV consists of nucleocapsid, which
surrounds the virion DNA and DNA polymerase
with reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease activ-
ity. The nucleocapsid also encloses a protein
attached to the genome, surrounded by hepatitis
B core antigen (HBcAg). The envelope which
encloses the virus consists of HBsAg and also
HBeAg.

HBsAg
This antigen consists of three glycoproteins,
namely S, L and M. These glycoproteins are
encoded by the same gene. The S glycoprotein
is the major component of HBsAg, which self-
associates into 22-nm spherical particles released
from the cells. The ﬁlamentous particles of
HBsAg found in the serum contain a large
amount of S and only a small amount of L
and M glycoprotein and other proteins and
lipids. The glycoprotein L is essential for virion
assembly and the formation of ﬁlamentous
particles, and retention of the structures in
the cell.
Virus Genome
HBV is a small (3.2 kb) enveloped DNA virus.
The genome is a small, circular, partially double-
stranded DNA. It is partially double-stranded
because its positive-strand is incomplete. The
complete negative-strand possesses four genes:
genes S, C, P and X (Fig. 60.5). The gene S
codes for HBsAg and also for HBeAg (hepatitis
B e antigen).
The S gene has three regions: Pre S (Pre S1
and Pre S2) and S region. Surface antigen (S) or
major protein is coded by the S region. S proteins
are present in the circulating HBsAg. C gene
consists of two regions in the C gene, namely
Pre-C and C regions. Core antigen (HBcAg) is
formed when only the C region is translated. If
translation starts from the Pre-C region, a soluble
antigen HBeAg is formed. This circulates in the

blood and is the detectable marker of HBV. P
gene codes for DNA polymerase that has reverse
transcriptase activity, although HBV is a DNA
virus,
the
gene.
X
gene
codes
a
tiny
non-particulate protein (HBxAg). This has a
transactivating effect on viruses and a few cellular
genes. The antibody of HBxAg seems to be pres-
ent in patients affected by chronic hepatitis and
hepatocellular carcinoma.

HBV DNA is demonstrated in the extrahepatic
sites
such
as
bone
marrow,
circulating
lymphocytes, lymph nodes and spleen.
Mutations
Unlike other DNA viruses, the mutation rates and
replication capacity in HBV are higher, giving
rise to considerable genetic variability. Mutant
viruses causing infections have been identiﬁed.
Mutations are mainly of two types. Pre-core
mutants were the ﬁrst type that was identiﬁed in
Mediterranean countries. This mutation occurs
due to the inability of the pre-core mutants to
synthesise HBeAg. Pre-core mutants are present
in patients with chronic hepatitis. These patients
may be anti-HBe and HBc positive. Escape
mutants are the second type of mutant. They
are found in liver transplant recipients immunised
with anti-HBV immunoglobulin and infants born
to HBeAg-positive mothers. Viral DNA is found
in the hepatocyte nucleus either in a free extra-
chromosomal state or together with a cell
chromosome.
Genotypes
A total of eight genotypic variants (genotypes A,
B, C, D, E, F, G and H) of HBV have also been
described. The prevalence of different genotypes
varies in different countries. The infection caused
by genotype C is associated with the rapid pro-
gression of the disease and poor response to
antiviral
treatment
than
that
caused
by
genotype D.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
867
Virus Replication
HBV replication shows many unique features.
First, the virus shows a well-deﬁned tropism for
replication in the liver. Second, a DNA virus
encodes
reverse
transcriptase
and
replicates
through RNA intermediates.
The virus replicates in the nucleus of the cell.
The virus infects hepatocytes, the attachment of
which is mediated by HBsAg glycoprotein. The
infection is initiated by the binding of HBsAg to
serum albumin and other serum proteins, which
subsequently causes the virus to infect the liver.
Inside hepatocytes, the partial DNA strand of the
genome is converted to covalently closed circular
double-stranded DNA. Later on, this genome is
transported to the nucleus of the cell. The DNA
acts as a template for all viral transcription,
including 3.5 kb pre-genomic RNA. Subse-
quently, the genome is enclosed by a virus capsu-
lar antigen. Within the core, both negative- and
positive-strand DNA viruses are synthesised.
Finally, the core buds from the membrane acquire
an HBsAg-containing envelope and are released
from the infected cell.
The HBV cannot be conventionally cultured.
However, its proteins have been cloned in yeast
and bacteria.
Virus Antigens
HBsAg is antigenically complex. The HBsAg
glycoprotein contains a group-speciﬁc antigen
termed a, and type-speciﬁc antigens termed d or
y and w or r. The combination of these antigens
results in four major subtypes of HBV (adw, adr,
ayw and ayr). These subtypes show different
geographic distributions. Subtype ayw is com-
mon in Asia, the Middle East and western and
northern India. Subtype adr is common in South
and East India and far East countries. Subtype
adw is prevalent in Europe, Australia and Amer-
ica, and Subtype ayr is very rare. HBcAg is found
on the surface of the nucleocapsid core of the
virus. Unlike HBsAg, it is not secreted and not
seen in general circulation. It is found in
hepatocytes. HBeAg is a translation product of
the pre-core and core regions and is found in the
serum of the infected individual in the free form
in the initial phase of infection.
Susceptibility of Virus
HBV is an extremely resistant virus capable of
withstanding extreme temperature and humidity.
HBV is stable even for 15 years when stored at
20 C, 24 months at 80 C, 7 days at 44 C,
60 min at 37 C and for 6 months at room tem-
perature. HBV, however, is sensitive to higher
temperatures and is killed rapidly after heating
at 100 C for 1 min and 60 C for 10 h.
HBsAg is a stable antigen. It is stable at pH 2.4
for up to 6 h but is associated with loss of infec-
tivity of the virus. HBsAg is also destroyed by
treatment with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite within
3 min. However, the HBsAg is not destroyed by
ultraviolet irradiation of plasma or other blood
products, thereby retaining the infectivity of the
virus.
Pathogenesis of HBV Infection
Perinatal, sexual or parenteral methods transmit
the HBV. After entering the blood, the virus
infects the hepatocytes in the liver with viral
antigen expression on the surface of infected
cells.
Cytotoxic T cells, such
as
activated
CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, recognise various
HBV-derived
proteins
present
on
the
hepatocytes’ surface, resulting in an immunolog-
ical reaction.
The virus by itself does not cause any cyto-
pathic effect in the infected liver cells. The injury
or cytopathic effects most probably occur due to
cell-mediated injury. The formation of antigen-
antibody complexes is responsible for some
symptoms, such as arthralgia arthritis seen during
an early stage of the disease. The immune com-
plex
is
also
responsible
for
some
of
the
complications associated with chronic hepatitis,
such as immune complex glomerulonephritis,

cryoglobulinemia and vasculitis. A restricted
T-cell-mediated
lymphocyte
response
occurs
against HBV-infected hepatitis.
868

Hepatitis Viruses
In an infected host, whether the person will
become a chronic carrier state or free of infection
depends on the cytotoxic T-cell response. If the
cytotoxic T-cell response is strong, the infection
is cleared in the person, but if the response
is inadequate, the person becomes a chronic car-
rier. The majority (10–70%) of infections in
neonates, children and adults recover from acute
infection.
A chronic infection is an important event in the
pathogenesis of HBV infection. This is caused by
a persistent infection of the hepatocytes that leads
to the presence of HBV and HBsAg in the blood.
HBsAg persists in the blood for at least 6 months.
Chronic infection occurs more frequently in a
newborn than in adults. It has been observed
that
approximately
2–10%
of
the
infected
neonates become chronic carriers. During the
chronic stage, the HBV DNA is present in the
cytoplasm of persistently infected cells, and in
some cells, the viral DNA is integrated with
cellular DNA.
Approximately 20% of HBsAg carriers, nearly
1% of all adult patients infected with HBV, and a
high percentage of neonates infected with the
virus progress to develop hepatocellular carci-
noma or cirrhosis. The hepatocellular carcinoma
appears to result from persistent cellular regener-
ation that tends to replace the dead hepatocytes.
However, the HBV genome has no oncogene,
which can cause hepatocellular carcinoma.
Immunity
HBV natural infection induces a lifelong immu-
nity. Humoral antibodies primarily mediate the
immunity against HBsAg. Antibodies to HBsAg
are protective. These antibodies bind to surface
antigens or with the virus and prevent it from
interacting with receptors on the hepatocytes.
These antibodies appear to neutralise the infectiv-
ity of HBV. However, the antibodies against core
antigen HBcAg are not protective because the
antibodies cannot act with HBcAg present inside
the cells.
Clinical Syndromes
HBV is one of the most important causes of acute
and chronic hepatitis. The clinical manifestations
vary from subclinical hepatitis to symptomatic
and icteric hepatitis. The incubation period varies
from
6
weeks
to
6
months.
The
clinical
manifestations depend on the age of infection,
immune status of the host and the level of HBV.
Acute Hepatitis
The
prodromal
or
pre-icteric
phase
is
characterised by the gradual onset of anorexia,
malaise and fatigue. During the icteric phase, the
liver becomes tender with the development of
jaundice. Nausea, vomiting and pruritus with the
passing of dark-coloured urine are the common
symptoms. Clinical manifestations of acute hepa-
titis B are similar to that of hepatitis A. However,
the symptoms tend to be more severe and life-
threatening with HBV infection.
Chronic Hepatitis
Chronic
infection
is
one
of
the
major
complications of HBV infection. The risk of
chronic infection is also higher in those infected
at birth (90%) and in immunocompromised
patients. Only 5–10% of older children or adults
progress to develop chronic infection.
Complications of HBV Infection
Patients with chronic HBV infection have a very
high-risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocel-
lular carcinoma. The cancer is caused due to
repeated episodes of chronic inﬂammation and
cellular regeneration. Cancer appears to be due
to repeated episodes of chronic inﬂammation and
cellular regeneration and develops an average of
25–30 years after initial infection. Fulminant
hepatic failure is another major complication of
HBV infection.
Fulminant hepatic failure is another major
complication of HBV infection. The case fatality
rate of these patients is very high, nearing
80%. Glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa,
varieties of skin manifestations, cardiopulmonary
manifestations
and
joint
and
neurologic

manifestations are other important complications
of HBV infection.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
869
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis plays an important role to
conﬁrm the HBV aetiology of hepatitis.
Specimens
The serum is an important specimen.
Serology
The deﬁnitive diagnosis of HBV depends on
detecting serum markers of HBV. These include
viral antigens and antibodies.
Viral Antigens
Diagnosis
of
acute
infection
is
made
by
demonstrating HBsAg and HBeAg in the serum
indicate virus replication (Fig. 60.6). Diagnosis of
chronic infection is characterised by the presence of
circulating HBsAg, HBeAg usually with HBcAg.
HBsAg appears in the blood even during the
incubation period. It is detectable in most patients
during pro-drome and acute phases of the disease.
The antigen typically disappears within 2 months
of the appearance of clinical disease. However,
the persistent presence of HBsAg in blood for at
least 6 months indicates the carrier state. It also
indicates the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatic
carcinoma. It is not detectable in the serum during
the convalescent stage.
The currently used vaccine,
containing recombinant hepatitis
surface antigen, elicits only
anti-HBsAg antibody, which is
the neutralizing antibody

Fig. 60.6 Serum markers in hepatitis B infection
HBeAg is present in the blood during the
incubation period, the pro-drome and early
acute disease. This is also present in certain
chronic
carriers.
The
presence
of
HBeAg
indicates a high likelihood of infectivity and
transmissibility.
HBcAg is not demonstrated in the serum. This
is because it is present inside the HBsAg coat. A
direct immunoﬂuorescence test can demonstrate
the antigen in the liver cells.
Viral Antibodies
Anti-HBs, the antibody against HBsAg, appear
after HBS ag clearance in the serum. It is usually
not detectable during the acute disease and in the
chronic carrier stage. Anti-HBs is protective and
remains in the serum remains for a very long
period.
HBcAb, The antibody against HBcAg, can be
demonstrated in the serum to diagnose HBV
infection. This antibody appears earlier than the
anti-HBs or anti-HBe antibodies. The HBcAb are
present in individuals with acute infection,
chronic infections and also in those who have
recovered from acute infection. Total HBcAb,
including IgM and IgG antibodies, indicates
exposure to the virus and virus replication. Detec-
tion of IgM HBcAb is diagnostic of acute HBV
infection during the window phase. The presence
of HBcAb IgG does not differentiate between
acute and chronic infection.
Interpretation of common serological markers
in HBV infection is summarised in Table 60.3.

Molecular Detection
HBV PCR, DNA-DNA hybridisation, etc., are
used to detect the viral DNA and DNA polymer-
ase activity during the incubation period and in
the early disease. Detection of viral DNA in the
serum indicates acute infection. DNA levels are
higher in patients with chronic hepatitis and are
associated with increased infectivity. HBV DNA
levels are typically low or absent in inactive
carriers. HBV PCR is highly valuable to monitor
the treatment of chronic HBV infection with
antiviral therapy. This is also useful to identify
HBV as the cause of liver infection in HBsAg-
negative patients.
Other Tests
These tests include elevation of ALT and AST.
High
levels
are
found
in
acute
hepatitis
(1000–2000 IU/mL). Estimation of serum biliru-
bin indicates the intensity of jaundice.
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral treatment is available for
patients with acute HBV infection. Supportive
and symptomatic care continues to be the main-
stay of therapy for most patients with acute infec-
tion. Therapy by interferons and nucleoside
analogues is recommended for patients with
chronic hepatitis B infection. No effective treat-
ment is available for the carrier stage.
Interferons
Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) has been the mainstay
in treating chronic hepatitis B since its introduc-
tion
in
the
mid-1980s.
Interferon
acts
by
immunomodulation and prevents the progression
of acute hepatitis to the chronic stage. It also
promotes more rapid resolution of viremia and
normalisation of serum aminotransferase levels.
Nucleoside Analogues
These block the replication of viruses by directly
blocking the replication of HBV. These nucleo-
side analogues are highly effective against HBV
and are bioavailable and extremely well-targeted.
Tenofovir and entecavir are highly effective for
the treatment of HBV chronic hepatitis. In HBV/
HIV-coinfected
adults,
for
adolescents
and
children aged 3 years or older, tenofovir in com-
bination with lamivudine (or emtricitabine) along
with efavirenz as a ﬁxed-dose combination is
recommended by the WHO. However, in persons
with conﬁrmed or suspected antiviral resistance to
lamivudine, entecavir, adefovir or telbivudine,
tenofovir is recommended as the second line of
treatment.
However, neither interferon nor nucleoside
analogues cure HBV infection. The goal of
antiviral therapy is only to reduce morbidity due
to
HBV
and
prevent
complications.
These
antiviral drugs achieve viral suppression as
demonstrated by loss of HBeAg in serum and
suppression of HBV DNA.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
871
Epidemiology
Hepatitis B is a major cause of infectious hepatitis
worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
HBV is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis,
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma world-
wide. Nearly one-third of the world population
is believed to be infected with HBV. More than
10% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa and
East Asia are infected with HBV. Approximately
500,000 to 1 million persons die annually from
HBV-related liver disease. Estimates suggest that
400–500 million people worldwide are HBV
carriers. The HBV carrier rate varies from 1% to
20% worldwide.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Individuals with chronic HBV infection are the
major reservoir of HBV infections. These people
with HBeAg in their serum tend to have high viral
titres and thus greater infectivity. HBV is present
at a high level in serum. The virions are also
present at very low levels in semen, vaginal
mucosa, saliva and tears, and all are infectious.
The virus is not detected in urine, stool or sweat;
hence these specimens are not infectious.
Transmission of Infection
The
HBV
can
be
transmitted
in
the
following ways:
1. Perinatal transmission is the major route of
transmission of the virus. This occurs from
infected mother to child due to contact with
mother’s
infected
blood
during
delivery
instead of transplacental passage of the virus.
Although HBV is found in breast milk, the role
of breastfeeding in transmission is unclear.
2. Parenteral transmission occurs due to trans-
fusion of HBV-infected blood and blood
products. This was one of the important
modes of transmission before the 1970s, but
with the starting of screening of blood donors
for HBsAg, the rate of blood-transfusion-
associated HBV infection has reduced consid-
erably in India and other parts of the world.
Patients with haemophilia, renal dialysis and
those receiving organ transplantation and
intravenous drug users remain at increased
risk of infection. Ear piercing, tattooing, and
use of improperly sterilised scalpels or needles
are associated with the risk of transition of
HBV infection. The risk of acquiring HBV
amongst health workers after needle stick
injury from infected individuals is estimated
to be as high as 5%.
3. Sexual transmission of HBV occurs more
easily than HCV or HDV. The infection is
associated with vaginal intercourse, genital–
rectal intercourse and non-genital intercourse.
However, the virus is not transmitted by hug-
ging and kissing or by sharing towels, eating
utensils or food. Health workers with exposure
to infected blood or body ﬂuids, heterosexual
persons with multiple partners, household
contacts or sexual partners of HBV carriers
are other at-risk groups.
High-Risk Groups
These include Medical and paramedical people,
individuals employed in blood bank and dialysis
units, and barbers. These also include newborn
infants to mothers with HBV, and patients receiv-
ing organ transplantations, multiple transfusions
and haemodialysis. Parenteral drug abusers and
sex workers have a high-risk of infection. In
countries like Britain, which are non-endemic,
HBV carriers are not allowed in medical practices
and not allowed to be medical students.
Hepatitis B Virus Carriers
When a person is detected with HBsAg in blood
for more than 6 months, he becomes a carrier.
Ninety percent of the neonates, 30% of children
and 5–10% of adults become carriers. Males
become more susceptible as carriers. There are
two categories of carriers.
Super Carriers
These are highly infectious. They have high
HBsAg
titre
along
with
DNA
polymerase,

HBeAg and HBV in circulation. Few carriers
have high levels of antigenemia and viremia.
India has a quarter of the carriers who are
HBeAg-positive.
872
60
Hepatitis Viruses
Simple Carriers
These carriers have relatively low infectivity
and less titre of HBsAg in blood. They are nega-
tive for DNA polymerase, HBeAg and HBV.
Sometimes many supercarriers become simple
carriers.
Prevention and Control
Hepatitis B infection can be prevented using
either vaccine or hyperimmunoglobulin, or both.
Vaccines
This is considered very effective. In 1982 the ﬁrst
vaccine was prepared from the plasma of healthy
human carriers having increased antigenemia
levels. Even though it was immunogenic, it was
not accepted due to its limited availability, and its
source was human plasma which was not free
from unknown pathogenic risks. S gene HBV in
baker’s yeast was cloned through genetic engi-
neering, and the vaccine was extracted. It is made
of non-glycosylated HBsAg particles alone.
Plasma-derived
vaccines
and
recombinant
DNA HBV vaccines are the two types of vaccines
that use HBsAg to stimulate the production of
anti-HBs in non-infected individuals. Earlier
Plasma-derived vaccines were used. They were
prepared
by
purifying
HAIg
from
healthy
HBsAg –positive carriers and treating with for-
malin, urea, heat, etc., to inactivate the virus.
Nowadays, these have been replaced by recombi-
nant DNA-derived vaccines.
The vaccines are highly effective with more
than 95% of seroconversion. The vaccine for
adults is recommended at 0, 1 and 6 months and
for infants at the time of birth, at 1–2 months and
6–18 months. The vaccine is indicated for all
infants and people at high-risk of infection. The
high-risk group includes the people frequently
exposed to blood and blood products, patients
receiving
multiple
transfusions
or
dialysis,
patients
suffering
from
sexually
transmitted
diseases and intravenous drug users.
In
India,
vaccination
against
HBV
has
been included in the Universal Immunisation
Programme. The vaccination schedule followed
is the ﬁrst dose given at birth or as early as
possible within 24 h of birth. Subsequently,
three doses are given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks in
combination with diphtheria, pertussis and teta-
nus (DPT), and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b
(Hib) in the form of pentavalent vaccine. The
route of vaccination is intramuscular injection is
given at the anterolateral side of mid-thigh. No
boosters are recommended.
For pre-exposure prophylaxis, in normal-risk
recipients of complete vaccination, no follow-up
testing is recommended. However, in persons at
high-risk of exposure to HBV, anti-HBs titre
should be assessed after 1 month of the third
dose. Anti-HBs titre of 10 IU/L (or 10 mIU/mL)
is protective. If the adequate titre is present, no
further booster doses are needed. For post-
exposure prophylaxis, for the unvaccinated, a
combination of passive (single dose of HBIG at
0.06 mL/kg) and active immunoprophylaxis
(complete three-dose vaccination) should be
given. For vaccinated people, the exposed person
is to be tested for anti-HBs titre. If the titer is
adequate, nothing is needed. If the titre is less
than 10, one dose of HBIG and a booster dose
of hepatitis B vaccine is given.
Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIg)
HBIg is used for passive immunisation of patients
after or just before exposure. This immunoglobu-
lin is derived from human plasma and contains a
high titre of HBsAb. It is prepared from plasma
from patients who have recovered from a hepatitis
B infection. Passive immunisation with HBIg is
recommended for (1) people who have a history
of recent exposure to the patient(s) infected with
HBV, (2) a household contact with an acutely
infected patient, (3) sexual contact with an
acutely infected patient, and (4) an infant born
to HBsAg-positive mother.
Screening blood and blood products for
HBsAg is important to prevent transfusion-
related HBsAg.

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
873
Combined Immunisation
Combined immunisation by HBIG, followed by
the vaccine, is suggested for those non-immune
persons exposed to HBV. A single injection of
0.5 mL of HBIG should be administered intra-
muscularly soon after the babies are born to car-
rier mothers. This can be followed by a full course
of vaccines at the different anatomical sites.
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the most important
cause of parenteral NANBH worldwide. It is a
ﬂavivirus
with
an
RNA
genome.
Prior
to
identifying the virus, it was known as NANBH
to
differentiate
it
from
viral
causes
of
non-alcoholic hepatitis. Most patients infected
with HCV have chronic liver disease, which
progresses
to
cirrhosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma.
HCV is the only member of the genus
Hepacivirus
in
the
family
Flaviviridae
of
RNA-containing virus. HCV appears to be
closely related to hepatitis D, dengue, and yellow
fever virus. It resembles ﬂavivirus in structure and
organisation and hence has been classiﬁed as a
new genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae.
Morphology
HCV is an RNA virus. It is a spherical,
enveloped, and single-stranded 55 nm RNA
virus.
Virus Genome
The virus shows wide genomic variations. There
are six major genotypes (genotypes 1–6). Molec-
ular differences between these genotypes are rel-
atively large, and more than 80 subtypes are
described. The genetic variability is the main
stumbling block against the effort to develop an
anti-HCV vaccine. Genotype 1 is the vaccine.
Genotype associated with more severe liver
diseases and high-risk of hepatocellular carci-
noma. It is also the main HCV genotype prevalent
worldwide. Genotypes 2 and 3 are also found
globally but to a lesser extent.
Other Properties
The viruses are ether sensitive and acid-sensitive.
Pathogenesis of HCV Infection
HCV is transmitted by parenteral, perinatal or
sexual routes. In the infected hots, Hepatocytes
are the natural targets of HCV. These viruses, like
other ﬂaviviruses, replicate in the endoplasmic
reticulum of hepatocytes. In most infected people,
viremia persists and is associated with a variable
degree of hepatic inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis. The
ability of HCV to remain cell-associated and pre-
vent host cell death is the main determinant of
viral pathogenicity. These cause persistent infec-
tion in the liver.
Chronic hepatitis is characterised by lympho-
cyte inﬁltration either within the portal tract or in
the liver lobule and portal and periportal ﬁbrosis.
Portal inﬂammation, interphase hepatitis and lob-
ular necrosis are the main histopathological
features of chronic hepatitis caused by HCV.
Cell-mediated immunity, mainly cytotoxic T
lymphocytes,
contributes
primarily
to
liver
inﬂammation and ultimately to tissue necrosis.
Immunity to HCV may not be lifelong, and
serum antibodies to HCV are usually protective.
Clinical Syndromes
HCV can cause acute HCV infection, chronic
HCV infection, cirrhosis, and other complications
induced by hepatitis. The incubation period varies
from 15 to 60 days, with an average period of
approximately 8 weeks.
Most patients with acute HCV infections are
symptomatic (80%) and do not develop any jaun-
dice. In symptomatic cases, jaundice occurs in
less than 25% of acutely infected patients,
whereas hepatomegaly is seen in one-third of
cases. Chronic HCV infection is a major cause
of chronic hepatitis worldwide. Most patients

with chronic hepatitis are asymptomatic and may
have non-speciﬁc symptoms, such as fatigue or
malaise. HCV is now a leading cause of hepatitis
and cirrhosis worldwide. This process may
take an average of 20 years after the initial infec-
tion.
Hepatocellular
carcinoma
is
one
of
the most important complications. This occurs
in around 1–5% of patients with underlying
cirrhosis.
874
60
Hepatitis Viruses
Laboratory Diagnosis
Serology
HCV antibodies are usually demonstrated in
acute infections 6–8 weeks after initial infection.
Then
antibodies
that
are
produced
persist
throughout life in chronic infection. Antibodies
are directed against core envelope and NS3 and
NS4 proteins and tend to be relatively low in titre.
ELISAs, including second-and third-genera-
tion ELISAs, are useful for screening serum
for anti-HCV antibodies. The ELISA employs
antibodies
against
core
proteins
and
non-structural proteins (NS3, NS4 and NS 5)
and is the most recent third-generation enzyme
immunoassay
(EIA).
The
test
can
detect
antibodies in the serum 8 weeks after the onset
of infection. Recombinant immunoblot assay
using recombinant HCV antigen is a highly spe-
ciﬁc test to detect HCV infection. This test, which
is more speciﬁc than the ELISA, has been used to
conﬁrm positive ELISA results. These assays are
highly speciﬁc but cannot differentiate acute
infection from chronic infection.
Molecular Detection
RT-PCR and branched DNA assays are used to
detect HCV RNA in the serum. HCV RNA test-
ing is the most speciﬁc. It is useful in diagnosing
acute HCV infections even before antibodies are
developed. This is also helpful to (1) assess the
HCV genotype, (2) to conﬁrm false-positive
cases, such as autoimmune hepatitis and (3) to
predict the response to interferon therapy.
HCV genotyping is a recent method, which
is frequently helpful for predicting the likelihood
of response and duration of treatment. The
genotyping is performed by direct sequence anal-
ysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Treatment
Combination therapy of pegylated interferon and
antiviral agent ribavirin is the current treatment
option for patients with chronic HCV infections.
Currently, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir/
ledipasvir are frequently used antiviral agents for
most patients with chronic HCV infections. Other
therapeutic options include the use of protease
inhibitors, ribozymes and viral vaccines.
Epidemiology
HCV is prevalent worldwide and is exclusively a
human disease. More than 3% of the world’s
population is infected with HCV. Worldwide
170 million people are estimated to be infected
with HCV.
Geographical Distribution
It is the most important cause of parenteral
NANBH worldwide. The prevalence rates in
healthy blood donors are also equally high.
HCV is highly prevalent in central Europe, the
Middle East, Spain, Italy and Japan.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Hepatitis C is exclusively human disease. Patients
who are infected with the virus are the important
reservoir of infection. Blood or blood products
and also organs of infected patients are the major
sources of infection.
Transmission
The following methods can transmit hepatitis C
virus:
Blood transfusion is the most important route
of transmission of HCV. The current risk of
transfusion-derived HCV is estimated to be one
case in every 100,000 units transfused. Paren-
teral transmission is equally important. HCV is
transmitted parenterally, (1) through transfusion

of infected blood or blood products, (2). trans-
plantation of organs from infected donors and
(3)
also,
by
sharing
contaminated
needles
amongst intravenous drug users. The use of intra-
venous drugs is the most important risk factor
responsible for around 50% of both acute and
chronic
infections.
Sexual
transmission
is
believed to be responsible for approximately
20% of cases of hepatitis C. The presence of
co-existing sexually transmitted diseases, such
as HIV, appears to increase the risk of transmis-
sion. Perinatal transmission is possible and is
observed in fewer than 5% of children born to
HCV-infected mothers. The risk of perinatal
transmission of HCV is higher in children born
to mothers co-infected with HCV and HIV.
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
875
Haemodialysis, tattooing, body piercing and
acupuncture with unsterile equipment are other
modes of transmission of HCV, though less
frequent. Needle stick injury amongst healthcare
workers exposed to infected blood accounts for
nearly 4% of new infections.

Hepatitis Viruses
Hepatitis D(Delta) Virus (HDV)
Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) is the smallest of known
human
pathogens
that
cause
infections
in
humans. It is an RNA virus, which is structurally
unrelated to hepatitis A, B or C virus. HDV is
unique in being an incomplete virus and requires
the presence of HBV to replicate and infect other
hepatocytes. Hence, HDV infection occurs only
in those patients who suffer from HBV infection.
Rizzetho and co-workers ﬁrst reported HDV in
Italy in 1977. They demonstrated the viral antigen
in nuclei of hepatocytes of patients infected with
HBV and suggested it to be a new hepatotropic
virus delta or HDV.
Morphology
It is a spherical, enveloped virus measuring 85 nm
in diameter. It contains a single-stranded, nega-
tive-sense 1.7 kb RNA. In blood, HDV or delta
agent contains delta Ag (HDAg) surrounded by
HBsAg envelope. HBsAg is required for HDV
replication, but it may be suppressed to undetect-
able levels with active HDV replication. The
single-stranded RNA is circular and surrounded
by a delta-antigen core, which is surrounded by
an envelope containing HBsAg. Delta antigen
may occur in two sizes—small (24 kDa) or large
(26 kDa). Delta antigen is the only protein coded
for HDV RNA, and it is distinct from antigenic
determinants of HBV.
Pathogenesis of HDV Infection
The patient may acquire HDV infection in two
ways—by co-infection or superinfection. Since
the same route transmits both HDV and HBV, a
person can be co-infected with HBV and delta
agents simultaneously. A patient with chronic
HBV infection may also be superinfected with a
delta agent.
HDV causes a more rapid and severe disease
with
rapid
progression
in
HBV
carriers
superinfected with delta and HBV. Delta agent
replicates in the liver, causing liver damage and
cytotoxicity. Chronic HBV carriers superinfected
with HDV usually also develop chronic HDV
infection. Chronic co-infection often leads to a
rapidly progressive sub-acute or chronic hepatitis,
resulting in more rapid progression to cirrhosis.
The virus causes an acute and chronic inﬂam-
matory disease of the liver. Although HDV can
replicate independently within the hepatocytes, it
requires HBsAg for its propagation. Death of
hepatocytes in the liver may occur due to the
direct cytotoxic effect of HDV or through a
host-mediated immune response.
Clinical Syndromes
Clinically, HDV infection is indistinguishable
from other forms of viral hepatitis.
The incubation period varies from 21 to
45 days but may be shorter in cases of superin-
fection. The clinical course of disease caused by
HDV varies and ranges from acute self-limited
infection to acute fulminant liver failure. Clini-
cally, HDV infection is indistinguishable from
other
forms
of
viral
hepatitis.
Patients
co-infected with HBV and HDV (Co-infection)
show a more severe course of the disease than
those infected with HBV alone. Complete clinical
recovery and clearance of HBV and HDV
co-infection is the most common outcome. Nearly
1% of the patients with co-infections progress to
develop fulminant hepatitis resulting in more
rapid progression to cirrhosis.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis of HDV infection is usually carried out
by serological and molecular tests.
Antigen Detection
Direct immunoﬂuorescence has been evaluated to
demonstrate the delta-antigen expressed in the
nuclei of the liver cell.

Hepatitis E Virus (HEV)
877
Serology
ELISA for antigen is usually positive in 20% of
patients. IgM ELISA for demonstration of anti-
HDV IgM is positive in the early stage of infec-
tion, whereas IgG ELISA for anti-HDV IgG is
positive during the later course of infection.
Serum antibodies against HDAg are almost
exclusively associated with chronic HDV infec-
tion. In superinfections, a high level of both IgM
and IgG antibodies, as well as a high level of Haig
and HDV RNA, is demonstrated.
Molecular Detection
Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is the most
sensitive method (90%) for detecting HDV RNA
in blood in the stage of co-infection.
Treatment
No speciﬁc therapy is available to treat HDV
infection of the liver. Lamivudine and ribavirin
appear to be ineffective against HBV and HDV
co-infection. Antiviral therapy with interferon is
also
ineffective
in
patients
with
chronic
infections.
Epidemiology
HDV is distributed worldwide. The highest prev-
alence has been reported in the endemic areas of
Italy, North Africa, the Middle East, West Africa
and Central Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan
and Myanmar. It is believed to infect approxi-
mately 15 million of the world’s population.
HDV, like HBV, is a blood pathogen and is
transmitted
mostly
by
blood
and
vaginal
secretions. It is most commonly transmitted by
non-percutaneous routes, especially by close inti-
mate contact in Mediterranean countries, endemic
for the disease. Infection appears to be more
commonly
transmitted
through
contaminated
blood and blood products in non-endemic areas
of northern Europe and North America. The sex-
ual and perinatal transmission of HDV is also
described. Sharing of contaminated needles in
intravenous drug users is believed to be the most
common
method
of
transmitting
a
million
infections is most common amongst adults and
children.
Prevention and Control
No vaccine is available against HVD. However,
vaccination with the HBV vaccine protects
against subsequent HDV infection. Avoiding the
use
of
HDV-contaminated
blood
or
blood
products prevents the disease.
Hepatitis E Virus (HEV)
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) HEV is the primary
cause of enterically transmitted viral infection.
Hence the virus is named enterically transmitted
non-A and non-B virus (NANB or E-AANB).
The virus has many similarities with HAV. The
virus was ﬁrst observed during the electron
microscopy of faeces contaminated with enteric
non-A and non-B virus hepatitis (NANBH). HEV
is currently classiﬁed in the family Caliciviridae.
It resembles caliciviruses, such as the Norwalk
virus. However, the HEV genome is different
from the genome of other caliciviruses, and anal-
ysis of the genome sequence suggests that it is
more similar to the rubella virus. Therefore, HEV
remains to be classiﬁed.
Morphology and Other Properties
HEV is a non-enveloped, spherical, icosahedral
virus measuring 32–34 nm in diameter. The sur-
face of the virion shows indentations and spikes.
It is icosahedral. The virus contains a positive-
sense,
single-stranded
RNA,
approximately
7.6 kb in size. The viral genome contains three
open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is the largest,
which codes for a non-structural protein responsi-
ble for virus replication. ORF2 encodes for the
capsule. The function of ORF3 is not known. The
viral genome is of 4 genotypes, namely 1, 2, 3 and

4. Of these, genotypes 1 and 2 are found in
humans. The virus is heat stable and yet to be
cultured.
878
60
Hepatitis Viruses
Pathogenesis of HEV Infection
The virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-
oral route, Inﬁltration of the portal tract by
lymphocytes,
polymorphonuclear
leucocytes,
balloon hepatocytes, formation of acidophilic
bodies, and intralobular necrosis of hepatocytes
is the classic pathological ﬁnding of HEV infec-
tion. The IgM antibody titre appears ﬁrst, which
falls rapidly after infection, becoming virtually
undetectable within 6 months. Anti-HEV IgG,
however, persists longer for more than 6 months.
The IgG antibody appears to offer protection
against re-infection by HEV.
Clinical Syndromes
HEV usually causes an acute, self-limiting dis-
ease similar to HAV. Earlier it was mistaken for
HAV due to clinical and epidemiological similar-
ity. HEV infection now, called type E hepatitis,
has been recognised as a distinct clinical entity,
different from the infection caused by HAV.
Type E hepatitis is self-limiting and resolves
within 15–45 days. The incubation period of
HEV infection varies from 2 to 9 weeks, with an
average of 35 days. The virus causes a serious
infection such as fulminant hepatitis in pregnant
women, especially in the last trimester of preg-
nancy. It has a high fatality rate of 15–20%.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Immune–electron microscopy is also used to
demonstrate the virus in the stool and bile of
infected persons. Western blot and ELISAs
using recombinant and synthetic antigens are
used for the serodiagnosis of HEV infection.
These tests detect anti-HEV IgM and IgG
antibodies
that
differentiate
acute
infections
from recent infections. PCR is also used to detect
HEV RNA in serum and stool of infected
patients.
Treatment
Treatment of HEV infection is mainly supportive.
No speciﬁc treatment is available.
Epidemiology
HEV is distributed worldwide. It is most com-
monly
found
in
developing
countries.
The
epidemics of HEV have been recorded in India,
Pakistan, Nepal, China, Burma, North Africa and
Mexico. Tropical climate, poor sanitation and
poor personal hygiene all contribute to the epi-
demic of the disease. During 1986–88, one such
large outbreak was reported in northeast China
affecting nearly 10,000 people. In India, the larg-
est epidemic of HEV occurred in Delhi during the
winter of 1955–56, affecting more than 30,000
persons within 6 weeks. The virus is transmitted
primarily by the faecal-oral route due to faecal
contamination of water in endemic areas. The
reservoir of HEV is unknown, but it may be
transmitted by animals.
Prevention and Control
No vaccine is available now for the prevention of
HEV. The administration of immunoglobulin
does not prevent the development of clinical dis-
ease. HEV infections respond poorly to treatment
with serum IgG.
Hepatitis G Virus
Hepatitis G Virus (HGV) is similar to viruses of
the Flaviviridae family, which includes HCV.
The
ﬂavivirus-like
isolates
were
ﬁrst
demonstrated in Tamarin monkeys inoculated
with blood from a surgeon with acute hepatitis
in 1995. A similar virus was isolated from another
patient during the same year. These viral isolates

were designated GB viruses A, B and C, respec-
tively.
A
similar
virus
resembling
GBVC
(GB virus C) was isolated from a patient with
chronic hepatitis in 1996. The virus has been
designated as the virus as it is not cultured in
cell lines, but its RNA genome has been cloned.

HGV is an RNA virus, and its genome codes
for 2900 amino acids. It is a blood-borne virus,
has 20% homology with HCV, is transmitted by
transfusion of contaminated blood or blood
products. HGV co-infection is observed in 6%
of chronic HBV infections and 10% of chronic
HCV
infections.
HGV
RNA
has
been
demonstrated in serum of patients with acute,
chronic and fulminant hepatitis, patients with
multiple transfusions and haemodialysis, blood
donors and intravenous drug addicts. However,
its role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis is yet to be
elucidated.
Laboratory diagnosis of HGV is very difﬁcult
as no serological test is available. Consequently,
detecting HGV RNA by RT-PCR seems to be the
only method of demonstrating circulating virus
inappropriate samples like blood. However, rely-
ing heavily on a single marker for diagnosis is not
sufﬁcient. An ELISA has been developed using
anti-E2 envelope protein, though its use is not
widely present. The only test widely performed
is HGV RNA PCR.
Epidemiological features of hepatitis viruses
are summarised in Table 60.5.
Case Study
A 25-year-old resident in surgery was admitted to
the hospital with jaundice, nausea and vomiting.
His liver was enlarged. The serum test showed
elevated aminotransferase. He gave a history of
vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine 6 years back.
His serum tested for HAV IgM was negative,
HAV IgG positive, HBsAg-negative, HBsAb
positive, HBcAb negative and HCV-antibody
positive.

Retrovirus
61
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) is a retro-
virus that causes acquired immunodeﬁciency syn-
drome (AIDS). AIDS is one of the most
devastating epidemics
ever recorded in the
world. AIDS was ﬁrst recognised in Los Angeles
in 1981 when ﬁve cases of Pneumocystis carinii
(now called Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia
in homosexual men and drug addicts were
reported. At that time, AIDS was considered to
be
associated
with
the
“4
H
group-
Haemophiliacs, Heroin addicts, Homosexuals
and Hispanics”.
Luc Montagnier and co-workers ﬁrst reported
the causative agent of AIDS from the Pasteur
Institute, Paris, in 1983. They isolated a retrovirus
from a West Asian patient with persistent gener-
alised lymphadenopathy and named it Lymphade-
nopathy-associated virus (LAV). In 1984 Robert
Gallo and co-workers from the National Institute
of Health, USA, reported the isolation of a retro-
virus from a patient with AIDS and called it
human T-cell lymphotropic virus-III (HTLV-III).
The International Committee on Virus Nomencla-
ture in 1986 gave the name human immunodeﬁ-
ciency virus, or HIV, for the same virus. HIV-1 is
the ﬁrst isolated virus from the cases of AIDS,
and HIV-2 has been isolated from some cases of
AIDS from West Africa.

Classification of Lentiviruses
HIV is a Lentivirus, a subfamily of Lentiviridae in
the family retrovirus. This family includes the
viruses
known
for
(1)
poor
host
immune
responses, (2) latency, (3) persistent viraemia
and (4) infection of the central nervous system.
HIV, like other retroviruses, are enveloped RNA
viruses,
characteristically
possessing
an
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase called reverse
transcriptase. Animal lentiviruses are bovine
immunodeﬁciency virus (BIV), caprine arthritis
encephalitis virus (CAEV), equine infectious
anaemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeﬁciency
virus (FIV), puma lentivirus (PLV), simian
immunodeﬁciency virus (SIV) and visna/maedi
virus (VMV). Among the human species, HIV
1 and HIV 2 are common. The SIV has been
associated with AIDS in primates.
Members of the lentivirus group that cause
immunodeﬁciency in primates and non-primates.
Morphology
HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus, which
measures up to 120 nm in diameter (Fig. 61.1).
It has a unique three-layered structure, the inner-
most
genome
layer,
middle
cone-shaped

nucleocapsid and an outer glycoprotein mem-
brane surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope.
882
61
Retrovirus
Fig. 61.1 Schematic
diagram of HIV
HIV genome is the most complex of human
retroviruses. The genome is diploid and consists
of two identical copies of the single-stranded
positive-sense RNA genome.
The genome is surrounded by a nucleocapsid
consisting of proteins. Reverse transcriptase,
integrase and protease are the three enzymes
located in the nucleocapsid. Reverse transcriptase
performs
two
important
functions.
First,
it
transcribes the RNA genome into the proviral
genome. Second, it also has a ribonuclease H
activity, which degrades the RNA when it is in
the form of an RNA–DNA hybrid molecule. Deg-
radation of the viral RNA genome is an essential
step in synthesising double-stranded proviral
DNA. Integrase is another important enzyme
that facilitates the integration of proviral DNA
into the host cell DNA. Protease is another
enzyme that splits precursor polyproteins into
functional viral polypeptides.
A lipoprotein envelope surrounds the virus.
The lipid component is derived from the host
cell membrane and glycoproteins, which are
virus coded. The major virus-coded envelope
glycoproteins are the projecting spikes on the
surface
and
the
anchoring
transmembrane
pedicles. The projecting spikes combine with the
CD4 receptors on susceptible host cells, and
transmembrane pedicles cause cell fusion.
Virus Genome
HIV genome is diploid and consists of two iden-
tical copies of the single-stranded positive-sense
RNA genome.
It contains three major genes, gag, pol and env,
characteristic of all retroviruses. All these genes
encode for the structural proteins.
The gag gene encodes for internal capsid and
matrix “core” proteins (p15, p18 and p24). Of
these three proteins, p24 is the major antigen,
demonstrated in serum of HIV patients during
the early stage of infection, and persists until the
appearance of serum antibodies. Detection of p24
antigen in serum, therefore, is of diagnostic value.
The pol gene encodes for several proteins,
including the enzymes reverse transcriptase,
integrase and protease. The enzyme reverse tran-
scriptase synthesises DNA by using the genome
RNA as a template. The enzyme integrase
integrates the viral DNA into the cellular DNA,
and the enzyme protease cleaves various viral
precursor proteins. The pol gene expresses pre-
cursor protein p160, which is cleaved into three
proteins: p31, p51 and p64.
The env gene codes gp160, a precursor glyco-
protein that is split to form two envelope
glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which form the
surface spikes and transmembrane tissue proteins,
respectively.
Apart from these genes, it also consists of six
other non-structural and regulatory genes (tat,

rev, nef, vif and vpr), including an additional gene
vpu in HIV-1 and vpx in HIV-2.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
883
These genes encode several proteins, which
are essential for transcription and invasion of the
virion into host cells. The Tat gene is the most
important one, which encodes a protein called Tat
protein that facilitates viral gene transcription. Tat
protein, along with other HIV-encoded regulatory
proteins called Nef, suppresses the synthesis of
class I MHC (major histocompatibility complex)
proteins, thereby reducing the ability of cytotoxic
T cells to kill the HIV-infected cells. The rev gene
encodes
another
regulatory
protein,
which
controls the transport of mRNA from the nucleus
into the cytoplasm. The functions of the genes are
summarised in Table 61.1.
Virus Replication
HIV replication is similar to that of other
retroviruses. The virus binds to the CD4 proteins
on the cell surface with the help of its gp120
envelope protein (Fig. 61.2). This protein also
interacts with chemokine receptors on the cell
surface. Then gp41 of the virus mediates fusion
of the viral envelope with the cell membrane
followed by entry of the virus into the cell.
CXCR4
and
CCR5
are
the
chemokine
receptors, which are very much essential for the
entry of HIV into CD4+ cells. The T-cell-tropic
strains
of
HIV
bind
to
CXCR4,
and
the
macrophage-tropic
strains
bind
to
CCR5
receptors. Once inside the cell, after uncoating,
the virion RNA-dependent DNA polymerase
transcribes
the
genome
RNA
into
double-
stranded DNA, which subsequently integrates
with the host cell DNA. Integration is mediated
by the viral enzyme integrase. The host cell RNA
polymerase transcribes the viral mRNA from the
proviral DNA.

The viral mRNA encodes several proteins,
which are cleaved by many enzymes. For exam-
ple, the Gag protein is cleaved by the virus-
encoded protease to form the main core protein
(p24), the matrix protein (p17) and several
smaller proteins. The Pol protein is also cleaved
by a protease to produce reverse transcriptase,
integrase and protease. The Env protein is cleaved
by a cellular protease.
The immature virions containing the precursor
polyproteins are assembled in the cytoplasm, and
cleavage by the viral protease occurs as the imma-
ture
virion
buds
from
the
cell
membrane,
resulting
in
the
production
of
mature
infectious HIV.
Virus Antigens
HIV shows two distinct antigens: group-speciﬁc
antigen and type-speciﬁc envelope glycoproteins.
Group-specific Antigen
The protein p24 is the group-speciﬁc antigen
present in the virus’s core. p24 is stable and
does not show variations. Serum antibodies
against the p24 antigen are not protective and do
not neutralise the infectivity of HIV. However,

p24 is an important serological marker for diag-
nosis of HIV, even during the “Window period”.
884
61
Retrovirus
Fig. 61.2 Invasion by HIV
Type-specific Envelope Glycoproteins
gp120 and gp41 are the type-speciﬁc envelope
glycoproteins present on the virus’s surface.
gp120, which protrudes from the surface, is the
most important that combines with CD4 receptors
and the chemokine receptors on the surface of
CD4 cells. Antibodies against gp120 neutralise
the infectivity, but the rapid emergence of gp120
variants does not confer protection against new
strains; hence, it is difﬁcult to produce an effec-
tive vaccine. gp41, which is embedded in the
envelope, mediates the fusion of the viral enve-
lope with the cell membrane at the time of infec-
tion (Fig. 61.3).
HIV-1 and HIV-2, two distinct antigenic
types,
based
on
molecular
and
antigenic
differences have been recognised. The envelope
antigens of both types are different. Their core
polypeptide
shows
some
degree
of
cross-
reactivity.
HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains based on sequence
analysis of either gag or env genes have been
classiﬁed into three groups: M (major/main), N
(non-M, non-O/new) and O (other). The M
group is the most prevalent group, which causes
most HIV-1 infections. Group M consists of nine
subtypes: A–D, F–H, J and K; all of which have
originated from Central Africa and are prevalent
worldwide. Groups N and O include only some
HIV-1 isolates from Central Africa, which do not
belong to group M.
HIV-1 represents the original isolates from the
Americas, Europe and other Western countries,
whereas HIV-2 isolates have originated from
Western Africa. The strains of HIV-1 can be
classiﬁed into four groups. These are groups M,
N, O and P. Of these, M is the “major” group and
is responsible for the majority of the global HIV
epidemic. Within group M, there are nine geneti-
cally distinct subtypes of HIV-1. These are
subtypes
A,
B,
C,
D,
F,
G,
H,
J
and
K. Additionally, different subtypes can combine
genetic material to form a hybrid virus, known as

n
a “circulating recombinant form” (CRF). Around
89 of these are known to exist. The dominant HIV
subtype in the Americas, Western Europe and
Australasia is subtype B. Subtype C is very com-
mon in the high-prevalence countries of Southern
Africa and the horn of Africa and India. The other
three groups––N, O and P––are uncommon.
Group O constitutes up to 5% of infections in
many west and central African countries, and
Group N and P have been rarely identiﬁed in
Cameroon. Recently, it has been seen that a
greater risk of transmission or faster disease pro-
gression is not associated with various subtypes.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
885
Fig. 61.3 Diagrammatic representation of HIV genome. (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HIV-genome.png)
HIV-2 is more closely related to the simian
immunodeﬁciency virus than to HIV-1. There are
eight known HIV-2 groups (A to H). Of these,
groups A and B are pandemics. Group A is found
mainly in West Africa but has also spread glob-
ally to Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, India,
Europe and the US. Group B is mainly conﬁned
to West Africa. Groups C and D have been found
rarely in people from Liberia, groups E and F in
Sierra Leone and groups G and H in two people
from the Ivory Coast.
Virus Susceptibility
HIV is a thermolabile virus. It is readily
inactivated at 60 C in 10 min and 100 C i
seconds. The virus in dried blood, at room tem-
perature (20–25
C), may survive for up to
7 days. The virus has been isolated from various
tissues even up to 16 days at the autopsy of the
patient infected with HIV.
HIV is inactivated by treatment with 50% eth-
anol, 35% isopropanol, 0.5% Lysol, 0.5% form-
aldehyde, 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and 10%
bleaching powder in 10 min. Bleaching powder
is an effective disinfectant for use as a surface
decontaminant at a concentration of 0.5%, with
free chlorine 5 g/L (5000 ppm). A 2% glutaralde-
hyde solution is effective for the disinfection of
medical instruments.
In liquid plasma or lyophilised blood products,
HIV can be inactivated by heating at 56 C for
30 min. It is also inactivated at a very low pH
(1) and high pH (13).
Laboratory Isolation
Tissue Culture
The
virus
can
be
isolated
mostly
from
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and occa-
sionally from bone marrow, plasma and other
body ﬂuids. In patients with AIDS, a high titre
of
the
virus
is
found
in
the
plasma
and
lymphocytes than in the peripheral blood. Viruses
are
found
mostly
within
CD4
cells.
Co-cultivation is the most sensitive method for
the isolation of the virus.
Pathogenesis of HIV Infection
HIV is primarily a sexually transmitted pathogen
transmitted by high-risk behaviours, such as
unprotected intercourse, male homosexual inter-
course and also by intravenous (IV) drug abuse.
Binding of Virus to Cell Receptors
HIV shows tropism for all the cells expressing
CD4 antigens on their cell surfaces. The CD4
antigens act as receptors for HIV. The virus
infects helper T cells and kills them, resulting in
HIV-induced
immunosuppression,
leading
to
full-blown
AIDS—a
key
feature
of
the

pathogenesis of HIV infection. This makes the
patient
most
susceptible
to
opportunistic
infections and certain cancerous conditions, such
as Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma. However, the
virus does not directly cause any tumour because
HIV genes are not found in these tumour cells.
886
61
Retrovirus
In the genital tract, infection with HIV begins
in Langerhans cells, the dendritic cells that line
the mucosa. This is followed by infection of the
local CD4+ helper T cells in the genital tract and
by the appearance of the virus in the blood
4–11 days after infection. The CD4 receptors are
present on CD4 T lymphocytes and also on the
cells
of
the
macrophage
lineage,
such
as
monocytes,
macrophages
and
alveolar
macrophages of lungs, dendritic cells of the skin
and microglial cells of the brain (Fig. 61.4). The
gp120 protein is the principal determinant of the
pathogenicity of HIV. The Vy region of the
gp120 determines the cellular tropism of the
virus. After HIV enters the host, gp120 binds
selectively to the CD4 cell surface receptors and
CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors expressed
on macrophage lineage cells.

Virus Replication
After gp120 binds to the receptor, the associated
gp41 protein initiates the cell membrane fusion.
After fusion with the host cell membrane, the
virus loses its envelope and reverse transcription
of RNA to DNA occurs. The reverse transcriptase
ribonuclease mediates transcription of the RNA
into double-stranded DNA provirus. The provirus
is integrated into the infected cell’s genome, caus-
ing latent infection. The long and variable incu-
bation period of HIV is because of this latency.
During the latency period, there is a high level of
virus replication. It is estimated that 10 billion
HIV particles are produced and destroyed each
day. The virus replicates continuously in the
lymph nodes, releasing the virions and infected
T cells into the blood.
Lysis of Infected Cells
Fusion of the cells, followed by lysis of fused
cells, results in the replenishment of many unin-
fected cells from the circulation. The virus causes
a drastic reduction in the number of CD4 T cells,
which may occur due to HIV-induced cytolysis,

cytotoxic T-cell immune cytolysis or natural ter-
minal differentiation of T cells. The CD4 cells are
decreased in number, and the CD4:CD8 cell ratio
is reversed. Viral infection also suppresses the
function of the infected cell without causing
structural damage.

887
The virus also infects brain monocytes produc-
ing multinucleated giant cells and signiﬁcant cen-
tral nervous system manifestations. The fusion of
the HIV-infected cells in the brain and other sites
is the key pathological ﬁnding.
Immunity
HIV is characterised by developing both cell-
mediated
and
humoral
immunities
against
HIV-related proteins.
Cell-mediated Immunity
It is characterised by the development of cellular
responses produced against HIV proteins. Sup-
pression of cell-mediated T-cell immunity is the
most profound consequence of HIV infection.
CD4 helper T cells, monocytes and macrophages
are important components of CMI against HIV
infection. The CD4 helper T cell plays a very
important role in the outcome of immune
responses. The CD4 helper cells are essential
(1) for activation of macrophages and (2) induc-
tion of functions of cytotoxic T cells, natural
killer cells and B cells and a variety of soluble
factors that stimulate growth and differentiation
of lymphoid cells. HIV binds directly to the CD4
receptors of the T helper cells, resulting in gradual
depletion of the T-cell population. The reduction
of CD4 T cells causes CMI to fail gradually (1) to
mount a cytotoxic T-cell response to virally
infected cells, (2) to form delayed-type hypersen-
sitivity reaction and (3) to process new foreign
substances presented to the immune system.
Monocytes and macrophages also play an
important role in dissemination and pathogenesis
of HIV infection. CCR5 chemokine receptors are
the major HIV co-receptors present on monocytes
and macrophages, which appear to be the major
cell types infected with HIV in the brain. These
cells, therefore, contribute immensely to the
development
of
neurological
manifestations
associated with HIV infection. The macrophage-
tropic strains of HIV are seen in large numbers
early in the infection, and these strains are respon-
sible even for transmission of the infection. The
virus may enter the brain through infected
monocytes and release toxins to neurons and che-
motactic factors that lead to inﬁltration of the
brain with inﬂammatory cells.
Humoral Immunity
It
is
characterised
by
the
development
of
neutralising antibodies produced against p24,
gp120, gp41 and various proteins in most
individuals infected with HIV. However, the
level of neutralising activities is low. In adults,
antibody to gp120 develops several months after
the
initial
viraemia.
The
development
of
neutralising antibodies is associated with the
slow progression of disease in adults, children
and infants. HIV escapes from the host’s immune
system in many ways (Table 61.2).
HIV escapes from the immune system through
its ability (1) to integrate viral DNA with the host
cell DNA, resulting in persistent infection, (2) to
undergo a high rate of mutation of the env gene,
(3)
to
produce
Tat
and
Nef
proteins
that
downregulate class I MHC proteins required for
cytotoxic
T
cells
to
recognise
and
kill
HIV-infected cells and iv) to infect and kill
CD4+ helper T cells. Continuous virus reproduc-
tion in macrophages and CD4 T cells also main-
tain the virus in an immune-privileged state.
Clinical Syndromes
The course of untreated HIV infection is usually
10 years or longer. The disease progresses
through the stages of (1) primary infection,
(2) dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs,
(3) clinical latency and (4) a late stage of pro-
found immunosuppression known as full-blown
AIDS (Table 61.3). HIV is associated with the
following clinical syndromes:

Acute HIV Infection
Acute HIV infection is characterised by the rapid
rise in plasma viraemia with a concomitant drop
in CD4 count after an incubation period of
3–6
weeks.
The
symptoms
of
HIV
are
non-speciﬁc and include low-grade fever, fatigue,
malaise, rash, headache and lymphadenopathy;
spontaneous resolution may occur within weeks.
HIV antibodies are usually absent in the serum at
the onset of illness but begin to appear after
3–4 weeks of the infection. This condition is
referred to as seroconversion illness. Serum
antibodies are not demonstrated, but the p24 anti-
gen can be demonstrated during the beginning of
the infection.
Asymptomatic or Latent Infection
This period is followed by an asymptomatic or
clinically latent stage during which the patient
continues to remain asymptomatic for several
months to years. This stage is characterised by a
low level of virus replication and a gradual fall in
CD4 count. The serum is positive for HIV
antibodies in these patients.
In this context, long-term progressors term
was used for those who have been infected for
over 10 years and remained asymptomatic with
normal and stable immunologic proﬁles and who
had not received any anti-HIV treatments. In
long-term non-progressors, the viral load is low,
but virus replication persists. Lymph node archi-
tecture and immune function appear to remain
intact. The CD8 cell anti-HIV factor (CAF)
appears
to
be
a
strong
response
in
non-progressors.
Another characteristic of the latency stage is
persistent generalised lymphadenopathy, which
may last for several years or a period of asymp-
tomatic infection. During this stage, the virus
continues to replicate in the lymph node. This is
a benign condition but may progress to AIDS-
related complex (ARC) or AIDS.

Lymphopenia
CD4 count reduction, inversion of T4:T8 ratio
Decrease in delayed hypersensitivity (low skin test response)
Polyclonal activation of B cells results in increased spontaneous secretion of antibodies
Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia (increased IgG and IgA levels, IgM level will be high in children)
Other common features
In vitro proliferation of lymphocyte will be decreased in response to mitogens and antigens
Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells show decreased activity
Immune system show decreased antibody response to antigens
Monocyte and macrophages show decreased function
Serum will contain elevated levels of immune complexes
AIDS-Related Complex (ARC)
ARC is characterised by lymphadenopathy and
fever. This has an insidious onset and may be
associated with malaise and weight loss. Diar-
rhoea, night sweats, fatigue and opportunistic
infections are the presenting symptoms. The
patients with ARC may progress to AIDS in a
few months.
AIDS
AIDS is the end-stage disease of HIV infection. It
denotes the irreversible breakdown of the host’s
immune system, making the infected host highly
susceptible to a wide range of progressive oppor-
tunistic infections or unusual malignancies, such
as
Kaposi
sarcoma
(Table
61.4).
AIDS
is
characterised
by
deterioration
of
immune
response as evidenced by CD4 T cell decrease
response. The onset of clinical manifestations
correlates with (1) a reduction in the number of
CD4 T cells to less than 450 cells/μL, (2) an
increased level of virus in the blood and (3) pres-
ence of p24 antigen in the blood.
When CD4 count falls less than 200 cells/μL,
the patient develops full-blown AIDS. This stage
is characterised by the development of HIV
wasting syndrome with weight loss and diarrhoea
for 1 month. This is also associated with many
opportunistic infections. Patients with AIDS
show clinical manifestations in different ways as
follows:
Opportunistic Infections
These are usually associated with HIV-infected
patients when their CD4 cell count falls to less
than 200 cells/μL. The indicator diseases caused
by various pathogens, such as protozoa, bacteria,
viruses and fungi, are summarised in Table 61.5.
These infections manifest as diseases of various
systems.
1. Respiratory system infections: Lower respi-
ratory tract infections (LRTIs), mostly in the
form of pneumonia, are the most common
respiratory diseases and are frequently the
ﬁrst clinical manifestations of HIV infections.
The spectrum of HIV-associated opportunistic
pneumonias includes bacterial, mycobacterial,
fungal, viral and parasitic pneumonias. Bacte-
rial pneumonia is the most frequent opportu-
nistic pneumonia in the Western countries of
the USA and Europe, while tuberculosis
(TB)
is
the
dominant
pathogen
in
sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The incidence
of Pneumocystis pneumonia has declined
with the use of antiretroviral therapy though
it continues to occur in persons who do not
have access to medical care and diagnostics.
Other infectious causes, like Cryptococcus
neoformans,
Histoplasma
capsulatum,
Coccidioides
immitis,
cytomegalovirus
(CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, are less fre-
quent
though
they
are
often
seen
in
disseminated infections and are associated
with signiﬁcant mortality.
2. Gastrointestinal system infection: The spec-
trum of gastrointestinal infections ranges from
oral lesions of Candidiasis, various lesions of
viral infections, hepatobiliary lesions, pancre-
atitis
and
anorectal
lesions.
The
disease
manifestations
depend

immunosuppression, as determined by the
CD4 counts. Oral Candidiasis (thrush) is seen
in most patients with advanced HIV. Esopha-
gitis is common in advanced diseases and fre-
quently occurs in at least one-third of the
patients. Candidal esophagitis is the most fre-
quent, occurring either alone or in association
with other opportunistic pathogens, like CMV,
HSV
and
Mycobacterium
avium-
intracellulare (MAI) complex.
3. Central Nervous system infections: Cerebral
toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, tuber-
culous
meningitis,
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML)
and
CMV
encephalitis are the most common opportunis-
tic infections of the central nervous system
(CNS) in HIV-infected patients. Concurrent
neurological HIV-CNS disease (such as the
AIDS
dementia
complex)
is
also
frequently seen.
Malignancies
Patients with AIDS show a marked susceptibility
to the development of malignancies. Human her-
pesvirus-8-associated Kaposi sarcoma is the most
noted malignancy associated with AIDS. Kaposi
sarcoma is much more common in untreated
AIDS patients than in the general population. It
is a vascular tumour suggested to be of endothe-
lial origin, which is found in the skin, mucous
membrane, lymph node and visceral organs.
Other AIDS-associated malignant conditions
include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lym-
phoma, cervical cancer and anogenital cancer.
Burkitt lymphoma has been shown to be even
much more common in AIDS patients than in
the general population.
1. Neurological diseases: AIDS patients are
associated with several distinct neurological
syndromes. These include AIDS dementia
complex,
sub-acute
encephalitis,
vacuole

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

myelopathy, aseptic meningitis and peripheral
neuropathy. AIDS dementia complex is the
most common neurological manifestation of
HIV and occurs due to HIV infection of the
microglial cells and neurons of the brain. This
condition is characterised by poor memory,
inability to concentrate, apathy, automotor
retardation and behavioural changes.
2. Cutaneous
diseases:
Cutaneous
manifestations of HIV infection may result
from HIV infection itself or from opportunistic
infections. Kaposi sarcoma can occur prior to
the onset of immunosuppression. With the
onset
of immunosuppression, non-speciﬁc
skin
changes
occur,
such
as
recurrent
varicella-zoster,
numerous
hyperkeratotic
warts, treatment-resistant seborrheic dermatitis
and oral hairy leukoplakia. Verrucous herpes
infection, leprosy, condyloma-like molluscum
contagiosum and AIDS-associated pigmented
or non-pigmented erythroderma may be seen
in
early
HIV
disease.
Chronic
HSV,
molluscum contagiosum (MC), and CMV
infections appear later. Cutaneous forms of
Mycobacterial infections and mucocutaneous
candidiasis also occur frequently. The most
common cutaneous infections in children
with HIV are impetigo and cellulitis caused
by Staphylococcus aureus. Other cutaneous
manifestations of HIV infection in the pediat-
ric age group are recurrent herpetic gingivos-
tomatitis, scabies, severe atopic dermatitis,
drug eruptions and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
Toxoplasma encephalitis, cryptococcal menin-
gitis and John–Cunningham (JC) virus-induced
PML are some of the common infectious diseases
of the brain associated with patients of AIDS.
Paediatric AIDS
Paediatric
AIDS
is
an
important
condition
acquired
from
infected
mothers.
AIDS
in
paediatric populations usually occurs by vertical
transmission of HIV from infected mothers or by
the
perinatal
transmission
of
HIV
through
breastfeeding.
Children develop clinical manifestations by
2 years of age and subsequently die of AIDS in
the following 2 years. The condition is more
severe in neonates because the immune system
is very poor during the time of birth. Clinical
manifestations of AIDS in children include pneu-
monia, severe oral candidiasis, interstitial pneu-
monitis, encephalopathy, wasting, generalised
lymphadenopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly,
diar-
rhoea, growth retardation and bacterial sepsis.
Children with perinatally acquired HIV infec-
tion, if they remain untreated, show a very bad
prognosis. The progression of the infection is
very fast in the ﬁrst year of life and is believed
to be associated with a higher viral load of HIV-1
in the blood. The replication of the virus in chil-
dren shows a different pattern than that seen in
adults. Viral RNA load is usually low at birth, but
the level of the virus then increases rapidly within
the ﬁrst 2 months of life, followed by a slow
decline at the age of 2 years.
Progression of infection from acute HIV infec-
tion to AIDS usually occurs at a median of
11 years after the infection. Earlier, many of the
patients used to die within 1–2 years following
diagnosis of AIDS. However, now with the intro-
duction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) and better management of opportunis-
tic infections, the death rates from AIDS have
begun to decline signiﬁcantly. In India, the
mean duration of survival of a patient after diag-
nosis of HIV is 7 years 8 months.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is useful (1) to conﬁrm the
diagnosis of AIDS, (2) to detect the individuals
with HIV infection, (3) to identify carriers who
may transmit infections to others, (4) to screen
blood donors and high-risk groups, (5) in mental
screening
of
mothers
and
(6)
to
perform
seroepidemiological studies in the community.
It is based on cell culture for virus isolation,
serology for detection of virus antigen and
antibodies, and detection of virus DNA.

892
61
Retrovirus
Specimens
These include serum and plasma for HIV serol-
ogy and lymphocytes for isolation of HIV.
Cell Culture
Virus isolation is carried out only in containment
laboratories by Co-cultivation. Co-cultivation is
the most sensitive method for the isolation of the
virus. It is performed by co-cultivating potentially
infected and uninfected mononuclear cells to
facilitate the replication of HIV. The viral growth
in culture ﬂuid is demonstrated by the presence of
HIV p24 antigen and HIV reverse transcriptase.
The test becomes positive after 7–14 days of
culture or may require a longer period of
28 days. The virus titre in asymptomatic infection
is low, hence may not be positive for virus by
culture. Viral culture is useful for detecting high
virus titre, which is found early in infection before
the presence of HIV antibodies.
Serology
Serodiagnosis includes the demonstration of viral
antigens and viral antibodies.
Detection of Viral Antigen
The antibody sandwich ELISA using speciﬁc
monoclonal antibodies to HIV p24 is used to
detect the viral capsid core antigen (p24 antigen)
in blood. The p24 antigen appears much earlier
than HIV antibodies during acute HIV infection,
hence can be detected during the window period,
during which antibodies are not demonstrated in
the serum. The p24 antigen usually appears
16 days after infection. The p24 antigen often
becomes
undetectable
after
HIV
antibodies
develop in the blood. This is due to the formation
of immune complexes by p24 with the antibodies.
Seroconversion is the period during which the
body starts producing detectable levels of HIV
antibodies. This usually occurs several weeks
after initially contracting the virus. The window
period is different from seroconversion and refers
to the time after infection and before seroconver-
sion, during which markers of infection (p24 anti-
gen and antibodies) are still absent or too scarce to
be detectable. Therefore, IgM antibodies are
detectable during seroconversion.
Detection of Specific Antibodies to HIV
Detection of speciﬁc antibodies to HIV in serum
is
the
most
commonly
used
method
for
serodiagnosis of patients with HIV and AIDS. A
detectable level of antibodies is demonstrated in
most individuals within 6–12 weeks after infec-
tion and in all the individuals within 6 months of
infection. The time interval before an antibody
appears in the serum is known as the window
period, and it may vary from 3 to 4 weeks. The
patient’s serum tested during this period is nega-
tive for serum antibodies but positive for viral
antigens.
The antibody-based serological testing in HIV
is of two types: (1) screening tests and (2) supple-
mentary or conﬁrmatory tests.
1. Screening tests: These are otherwise known
as ERS, an acronym for enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA), rapid test and sim-
ple
test.
These
tests
are
usually
highly
sensitive and are used for initial screening of
the serum samples for the presence of HIV
antibodies. They are simple to perform, highly
sensitive and can be automated. Nevertheless,
all the tests positive by ERS need to be con-
ﬁrmed before being declared positive.
ELISA is the most frequently used test for
detecting
both
HIV-1-
and
HIV-2-speciﬁc
antibodies in the serum. This test is highly sensi-
tive and speciﬁc, and commercial ELISA kits are
available, which detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2
antibodies in the serum. ELISA can also be used
for the demonstration of antibodies in the saliva.
This is very useful for testing injectable drug
users from whom it may be difﬁcult to collect
blood due to collapsed blood vessels. ELISA in
HIV serology is of four types: ﬁrst generation,
second generation, third generation and fourth
generation, depending on the nature of the anti-
gen used and detecting both antibodies and anti-
gen in the serum (Table 61.6).
Rapid Tests
Rapid tests include dot blot assay, latex aggluti-
nation, gelatin agglutination, casette ELISA,
immunochromatographic tests (ICTs), dipstick
tests and HIV spot tests. These tests are simple

tests that can be performed in any laboratory
without requiring any expensive instrument or
skilled workforce. Moreover, test results can be
read rapidly within 30 min of receiving the
specimens, such as saliva, urine, blood from a
ﬁnger prick and dried blood on ﬁlter paper.

Supplementary or Confirmatory Tests
These tests are used as conﬁrmatory tests to detect
HIV antibodies. These tests are designed for a
higher speciﬁcity than the screening tests, hence
are used as the test of choice to verify the results
of screening tests.
Western blot is the most common conﬁrma-
tory test used in HIV serology. In this test, HIV
viral antigens are separated as gp160, gp120, p66,
p55, p51, gp41, p31, p24, p17 and p15 depending
on their electrophoretic mobility by polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis. These antigens are
then blotted onto strips of nitrocellulose paper.
These
strips
are
treated
with
test
serum.
Antibodies to these HIV proteins, if present in
test serum, combine with different fragments of
HIV and then react with enzyme-conjugated anti-
human
globulin.
These
strips
are
washed,
followed by the addition of a suitable substrate,
which produces coloured bands. The position of
the coloured band on the strip indicates the anti-
gen with which the antibody has reacted. The
demonstration of multiple bands indicates a posi-
tive test.
Western blot is considered positive if it shows
bands against at least two of the three viral
proteins, namely, p24, gp41 and gp120 or
gp160. The test is also considered positive if
multiple bands are seen with multiple proteins,
which are encoded by three genes (gag, pol and
env). This represents p24 of gag gene core pro-
tein, p31 of pol gene reverse transcriptase, gp41,
gp120 or gp160 of env gene surface antigens. The
development of bands at one site, as with p24 or
gp120, is considered equivocal and may happen
in early infection and also may be non-speciﬁc.
The absence of any band indicates a negative test.
It was an earlier practice to conﬁrm the posi-
tive result of anyone screening test by Western
blot, but since the test is cumbersome, expensive
and not readily available, other strategies are
available to conﬁrm the cases. So the practice
followed now is to perform either two different
types of ELISA or an ELISA with any of the rapid
tests. If serum is positive for HIV antibodies by
both these tests, the serum is then considered
positive for HIV. In case of doubt, serum samples
are re-tested after a period of 1 or 2 months.
In principle, other conﬁrmatory tests, such
as line immunoassay, are similar to Western blot;
however, it differs from Western blot by having
artiﬁcial HIV antigens used on the strips than
using viral lysis protein separated by polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoresis. Indirect ﬂuorescent
antibody
(IFA)
is
another
test
used
as
a
conﬁrmatory test.
Applications of Serological Tests
Serological tests are helpful in the following
circumstances:
Screening
Screening is the systematic checking (voluntary
or mandatory) for the presence or absence of HIV
infection among the entire population or deﬁned
target population. Screening of a target popula-
tion is particularly useful as iatrogenic transfer of

HIV is an important mode of spread of the infec-
tion to unsuspecting recipients; thus, it should be
mandatory that blood, blood products, semen,
cells, tissues and organs be screened. Antenatal
screening is useful as infection could be transmit-
ted from mother to baby before, during or after
birth. Some countries have procedures requiring
the screening of incoming foreign visitors.
894
61
Retrovirus
Seuroepidemiology
Serological tests involving antibody surveys are
most useful in identifying the source and geo-
graphical spread of HIV infection among the
population in a deﬁned area.
Diagnosis
Serology is the most reliable and useful method of
diagnosis as it is most of the time positive in
persons with clinical features of AIDS. It may,
however, show negative during acute illness and
sometimes in the later stage of the disease where
the immune system is non-reactive. Serological
tests are also helpful in checking the occurrence
of infection followed by exposures, such as sex-
ual contact, blood transfusion or needle prick
injury.
Two-time
serology
tests,
one
after
2 months and the other after 6 months, would be
sufﬁcient for checking the infection. After expo-
sure, if serology is negative, then the occurrence
of infection could be ruled out.
Molecular Detection
The
molecular
methods
include
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(RT-PCR),
nucleic
acid-based
ampliﬁcation
(NASBA), transcription-mediated ampliﬁcation
(TMA)
and
branched-chain
DNA
(bDNA).
These methods are useful for quantitatively
estimating viral load in the plasma. In a positive
test, a ﬁve- or threefold change in the viral load
indicates reliably a signiﬁcant change in children
younger than 2 years or those older than 2 years,
respectively. These tests should not be used until
the diagnosis of HIV has been conﬁrmed with a
non-quantitative serodiagnostic method because
these tests may falsely show low viral loads in
individuals who are HIV negative.

HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive method for
detecting HIV provirus present inside mononu-
clear cells by employing oligonucleotide directed
at highly conserved regions of the virus genome.
The advantage of this test is that it can be used to
diagnose HIV within 24 h of infection, and it has
a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 95 and 97%,
respectively. The RT-PCR and NASBA for
plasma
are
sensitive
methods
for
detecting
HIV-1 subtype B viruses, whereas the bDNA
method is sensitive for the detection of other
HIV subtypes.
Few other test formats, like the FDA-approved
rapid self-test (OraQuick) used for home testing
of HIV, are available. For this test, one must swab
the gums to collect an oral ﬂuid sample and use
the materials in the kit to test the oral ﬂuid sample.
The results are obtained within 20 min. Similarly,
mail-in self-testing services are available through
online merchants, where kits provide the tools
needed to safely prick one’s ﬁnger and collect a
very small blood sample on a card. The sample is
then mailed to a laboratory for testing. When the
testing is completed, a health care provider is
contacted
with
the
results.
However,
these
facilities are CDC approved and in use mostly in
the USA.
Speciﬁc tests useful for laboratory diagnosis of
HIV infection and AIDS are summarised in
Table 61.7.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

The reasons for HIV screening are not limited
to epidemiological purposes only to ﬁnd the prev-
alence of the disease in particular geographical
locations. It extends to safety concerns involving
transfusion and transplantation procedures to
diagnose infection in asymptomatic high-risk
individuals and to prevent disease transmission,
especially from mother to child. HIV screening is
also done to initiate PEP prophylaxis at the
earliest to limit transmission.
Laboratory Monitoring Status of HIV
Infection
The laboratory monitoring of the status of HIV
infection can be carried out by analysis of
(1) CD4+ T-cell count, (2) measurement of HIV
RNA and (3) measurement of B2 microglobulin
and neopterin.
CD4+ T-cell Count
This is an important indicator for monitoring HIV
infection. This count reﬂects the immunological
competence of the patients with HIV or AIDS. A
rapid decrease in the CD4 count in adults and
infants is a poor prognostic sign and requires the
initiation or alteration of antiviral therapy. The
absolute number of CD4 lymphocytes and the
ratio of helper T-inducer lymphocytes (CD4:CD8
ratio) are very low in HIV-infected people. The
CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio is reversed to 0.5:1 from a
normal level of 2:1. If the CD4 count is below
500 cells/μL, it indicates progression of the disease
and hence requires speciﬁc therapy against HIV.
When the count falls below 200 cells/μL, it
indicates a very poor prognosis and shows the
increased risk for serious infection of the patient,
particularly opportunistic infections.
Measurement of HIV RNA
HIV RNA level in serum is an important predic-
tive marker of disease progression and is used as a
prognostic marker to monitor the effectiveness of
anti-HIV therapies. The test is also useful for the
early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to
infected mothers.
Measurement of B2 Microglobulin and
Neopterin
B2
microglobulin
and
neopterin
can
be
demonstrated
in
the
serum
or
urine
of
HIV-infected people. The titre is low in asymp-
tomatic HIV infection but is elevated with the
progression of HIV disease.
Other Tests
Tuberculin test or other tests for cell-mediated
immunity is negative, indicating a depressed
cell-mediated immunity. Both IgE and IgA
serum
levels
are
elevated
in
the
blood.
Haematological parameters are altered in patients
with HIV. There is a leukopenia with a lympho-
cyte count of fewer than 400 cells/μL and throm-
bocytopenia
in
patients
with
AIDS.
Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia is associated with
the progression of the disease. Hypoimmunoglo-
bulinaemia is observed in end-stage disease and is
associated with poor prognosis. Thrombocytope-
nia is a common ﬁnding in patients with HIV.
Anaemia occurs in as many as 25% of cases at
diagnosis and occurs in 80% of cases after some
time. Neutropenia is observed in 10% of early
asymptomatic HIV infections and 50% of patients
with AIDS.
Strategies for HIV Testing in India
The following are the three different strategies
followed for HIV testing in India as per the
National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO),
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of
India guidelines:
Strategy 1
In this strategy, test serum is subjected once to
ERS test, and if reactive, the sample is considered
as HIV infected, and if non-reactive, the serum is
considered to be free of HIV. For this purpose,
highly sensitive and reliable diagnostic kits are
usually used. This strategy is used to screen
blood, organ and tissue before transfusion and
transplantation. The unit of blood that tests reac-
tive (positive) is discarded.

Antiretroviral treatment is the mainstay in HIV
treatment. The goals of antiretroviral therapy are
to inhibit replication of HIV and to reduce mor-
bidity and death.

Retrovirus
Strategy 2
In this strategy, a serum sample is considered
negative if the ﬁrst ERS test report reports it
so. However, if reactive, it is re-tested with a
second ERS test based on different antigen
preparations and different test principles. If also
found reactive with the second ERS test, the
serum specimen is reported as positive, and oth-
erwise, it is considered negative. This strategy is
used for HIV surveillance.
In this strategy, when the purpose of testing is
for diagnosis in symptomatic patients, the algo-
rithm slightly differs. If the result is also reactive
with the second test kit, the specimen is consid-
ered to be positive for HIV in asymptomatic
AIDS cases. If a specimen is reactive with the
ﬁrst test kit and non-reactive with the second test
kit, the specimen is subjected to a third tiebreaker
test. If the third test is reactive, the specimen is
reported as indeterminate and follow-up testing is
undertaken after 2–4 weeks. If the third tiebreaker
test is non-reactive, the specimen is reported
negative.
Strategy 3
It is similar to strategy two but with an added
conﬁrmation by a third ERS test. The third test
should be based on different antigen preparations
or test principles. A serum showing a positive
result on all three ERS tests is reported positive.
The test is considered equivocal if the serum is
negative in the third ERS. In such cases, serum
specimens
are
re-tested
on
collection
after
3 weeks. If this specimen also shows an equivocal
result, the person is considered to be negative for
HIV antibodies. This strategy is used for the
diagnosis of HIV infection in asymptomatic
persons. The tests used in the second and third
strategies are of higher speciﬁcity to rule out any
false positivity.

Treatment
Anti-HIV Drugs
Antiretroviral agents against HIV (Table 61.9)
can be broadly classiﬁed as follows:
Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase
Inhibitors (NRTIs)
Azidothymidine (AZT), didanosine (DDI) and
other nucleoside analogues inhibit the enzyme
reverse transcriptase and alter their incorporation
into DNA to cause chain termination. These
agents prevent the spread of the virus to unin-
fected cells. AZT is recommended to treat

asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people with
a CD4 count of fewer than 500 cells/mm3. This is
also recommended for the treatment of pregnant
women to reduce the possibility of transmission
of the virus to the foetus. The toxicity associated
with high doses of AZT and the emergence of
resistance to AZT is the main disadvantage of
monotherapy with AZT. Zidovudine is also used
effectively to reduce the signiﬁcant transmission
of HIV from mother to infant. The treatment
decreases vertical transmission at all levels of
maternal viral load.

Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase
Inhibitors (NNRTIs)
NNRTIs, such as nevirapine, delavirdine and
efavirenz, inhibit the enzyme by blocking the
morphogenesis of the virion by inhibiting the
cleavage of the Gag and Gag core polyproteins.
This, in turn, prevents activation of the virion.
Protease Inhibitors
Protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir, indinavir,
saquinavir, nelﬁnavir and amprenavir, prevent the
maturation of virus particles during the late stage
of
virus
replication.
Monotherapy
with
antiretroviral therapy failed to produce signiﬁcant
clinical beneﬁts, including patient survival. The
failure is partly due to the development of drug-
resistant variants of HIV because resistance
develops
rapidly
during
monotherapy,
and
cross-resistance between related drugs is also
being increasingly reported.
Therapy with a combination of antiretroviral
drugs referred to as HAART effectively inhibits
HIV replication. HAART, a strategy similar to the
treatment of TB, has improved the efﬁcacy of the
therapy, minimised toxicity following therapy and
delayed emergence of drug resistance. It is usually
recommended to initiate double and triple-drug
therapy with two NRTIs or two NRTIs + an
NNRTI or a protease delavirdine drug therapy
reduces morbidity due to the disease, and death
in many patients due to AIDS is delayed.
In HAART, each class targets a different step
in the viral life cycle as the virus infects a CD4 T
lymphocyte or other target cells. Besides the clas-
ses
mentioned
above
of
drugs,
Integrase
inhibitors (INSTIs), Fusion inhibitors (FIs), Che-
mokine receptor antagonists (CCR5 antagonists)
and Entry inhibitors (CD4-directed post-attach-
ment inhibitors) have also been included in

HAART. Adherence to the HAART regimen is
very vital in this treatment because any irregular-
ity in following the prescribed regimen can lead
to resistance to HIV drugs. NACO in India has
made the drugs available at the treatment (ART)
centres to ensure this. The major goals for
HAART are to reduce HIV infection-related mor-
bidity, improve quality of life, restore and pre-
serve immunologic function, suppress viral load
(plasma HIV RNA) and prevent HIV transmis-
sion. Suppression of viraemia, which is ensured
through HAART, reduces cardiovascular, renal
and hepatic events, which are in turn due to ongo-
ing inﬂammation and immune activation from
uncontrolled viraemia. Improved immunity may
also reduce the risk for both AIDS-related and
non-AIDS-associated
malignancy.
The
guidelines recommend that therapy be initiated
in all persons living with HIV irrespective of
CD4 count and viral load. The course of untreated
infection is depicted in the Fig. 61.5.

Geographical Distribution
HIV-1 is the most common cause of HIV infec-
tion in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.
HIV-1 subtypes show differences in their geo-
graphical distribution. Subtype A predominates
in West Africa; subtype B in the United States,
Europe and Australia and subtype C in India,
China and Southern Africa. HIV-2 is the most
common cause of HIV epidemics in West Africa.
This virus is also found in European countries.
Since the ﬁrst recognition of AIDS in the United
States in 1981, AIDS has become a worldwide
disease, affecting a large number of populations.
India
The
ﬁrst
incidence
of
HIV
infection
was
documented among sex workers in Chennai,
Madurai and Vellore of Tamil Nadu in 1986–87.
The ﬁrst case of AIDS was detected in the year
1986 in Mumbai. Since then, HIV infection has
been documented in each part of India. The
National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO),
India, has estimated that by the year 2008, nearly
2.4 million people were living with HIV, next
only to South Africa. The national HIV preva-
lence is varied from 0.4% to 1.3%.

HIV infection occurs either by transferring
HIV-infected cells or free HIV not associated
with cells. HIV transmission occurs in the follow-
ing ways (Fig.
):
61.6
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
899
The distribution of the HIV epidemic in India is
varied and is based on the prevalence of HIV
infection in the high- and low-risk groups. Differ-
ent states in India have been classiﬁed as high-,
medium- and low-prevalence areas. Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa
are classiﬁed as high-prevalence states with HIV
prevalence over 1% even in a low-risk population.
Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been shown to
occur in India. Various studies have shown a high
prevalence of subtype C in India. Nearly 78.4%
of strains in North India and 95% of strains in
Kolkata and South India are HIV 1C subtype.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
HIV is primarily a human infection. Humans
infected with HIV and AIDS are the reservoir of
infection. The high titre of HIV is found in the
infected people’s blood, semen and vaginal
secretions; hence, these are important sources of
infection. The virus is also present in the breast
milk of an infected mother.

HIV infection

Transmission
1. Sexual transmission: HIV is transmitted pri-
marily through sexual contact and constitutes
more than 70% of the HIV transmission. Sex-
ual transmission is more common in hetero-
sexual women and men than in homosexual
men worldwide. Varied sexual behaviours,
such as (1) more sexual partners, (2) sex with
commercial sex workers, homosexuals and
(3) receptive anal sex, have been reported to

900
61
Retrovirus
be increasingly associated with HIV infection.
The presence of other sexually transmitted dis-
ease, such as gonorrhoea, syphilis or herpes
simplex virus type 2 infection increases the
risk of sexual HIV transmission by more than
100 times. This is due to pre-existing inﬂam-
mation and ulcers caused by these diseases,
which facilitate the transfer of HIV through
the mucosa.
2. Transmission by blood transfusion: HIV is
also transmitted by transfusion of infectious
blood or blood products, such as serum,
plasma
and
cells
from
HIV-positive
individuals. It can also be transferred by the
organs donated from HIV-positive individuals.
HIV among health workers has also been
documented following a needle stick injury
with contaminated blood.
3. Parenteral transmission: Parenteral trans-
mission occurs largely among IV drug users.
Injection users of illicit drugs are commonly
infected through the use of contaminated
needles. IV drug users constitute a substantial
proportion of new cases of HIV in the north-
eastern states of India Manipur. This is due to
the transmission of HIV through sharing
needles when injecting equipment is shared.
4. Mother-to-child
transmission:
Mother-to-
infant transmission can occur by vertical trans-
mission or by perinatal transmission. Vertical
HIV infection occurs in the following ways:
1. The foetus in utero can be infected by ver-
tical transmission of the virus through the
placenta or through the amniotic membrane
if the membranes are infected or inﬂamed.
Vertical transmission is most common dur-
ing the delivery of the baby of the infected
mother. The risk of vertical transmission is
greatly increased with an increase in the
duration of contact with the maternal
blood and cervical, vaginal secretions.
2. Perinatal infection in HIV occurs during the
birth process or through breastfeeding.
Transmission of HIV during breastfeeding
usually occurs by 6 months. Several studies
have shown that nearly one-third to half of
perinatal HIV infection in Africa is caused
by breastfeeding.
HIV is not transmitted by touching, hugging,
kissing, casual contact, coughing and sneezing. It
is also not transmitted by the bite of insects or
through water, food and utensils or by swimming
in swimming pools.
Prevention and Control
These include health education, screening of
blood and blood products, infection control and
post-exposure prophylaxis.
Health Education
Health education plays a key and important role
in preventing AIDS in the absence of a suitable
vaccine. Health education is aimed at behavioural
changes and maintenance of a lifestyle that
minimises or eliminates the risk of transmission.
Health education includes (1) safe sexual practice
by using a condom, which prevents transmission
of the virusoid, (2) not sharing unsterile needles
or syringes and (3) information to HIV-positive
women regarding the risk of vertical transmission
of HIV to infants.
Screening of Blood and Blood Products
It is essential to screen potential blood donors
before donating blood or blood products before
use. The infected persons who are tested positive
for HIV should refrain from donating blood,
plasma, body organs, other tissues or sperm.
The donors’ blood should be screened for HIV-1
and HIV-2 antibodies by screening tests, such as
ELISA. Regular screening of blood for HIV
antibodies before transfusion has reduced the
transmission of HIV by contaminated blood
considerably.
Infection Control
Infection control methods include the use of uni-
versal blood and body ﬂuids precautions. These
universal precautions include wearing protective
clothing, such as gloves, masks and gowns, and
using other barriers to prevent exposure to blood
products. These also include disinfection of
contaminated
surfaces
with
10%
household
bleach,
70%
ethanol
or
isopropanol,
2%

glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde or 6% hydro-
gen peroxide. Washing clothes in hot water with
adequate detergents are effective to kill HIV.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
901
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
“Exposure” that places healthcare personnel
(HCP) at risk of acquiring blood-borne infections
could be deﬁned and categorised as (1) percutane-
ous injury (e.g. needle stick injury), (2) contact
with non-intact skin, (3) contact with intact skin
(the duration of the contact is prolonged with
blood or other potentially infectious body ﬂuids)
and (4) contact with the mucous membrane of eye
or mouth. Despite the risk of acquiring HIV infec-
tion by these routes being less than 1%, PEP is
recommended within 72 h of exposure, based on
the exposure category of HCP and the HIV status
code of the patient as per NACO guidelines
(Fig. 61.7).
Vaccine Development
A safe and effective vaccine is yet to be available
against HIV. An ideal HIV vaccine would:
(1) prevent the acquisition of the virus by an
adult during sexual intercourse, (2) prevent trans-
mission of the virus to infants of HIV-positive
mothers and (3) also block the progression of the
disease.
There are many scientiﬁc obstacles to the
development of the AIDS vaccine. This is mainly
due to various problems unique to HIV, such as
(1) antigenic diversity and hypervariability of the
virus, as the antigenicity of the virus changes
readily through mutation, (2) transmission of the
disease by mucosal route—initial protection
should
require
the
production
of
secretory
antibodies to prevent sexual transmission and
acquisition of the virus, (3) transmission of the
virus by infected cells, (4) latency of the virus—
the virus can spread through syncytium and
remain latent, thereby remaining protected from
antibodies, (5) integration of the virus genome
into the host cell chromosome and (6) rapid emer-
gence of viral escape mutants in the host—the
high error rate of the viral reverse transcriptase
leads
to
continuous
mutations
in
the
HIV
genome.
Most
of
the
HIV
vaccines
have
been
evaluated by using gp120 or its precursor gp160
as an immunogen. The gene for this protein has
been cloned, expressed in different eukaryotic
systems and developed as a subunit vaccine. In
India, the National AIDS Research Institute
(NARI), Pune, is evaluating DNA+ pox virus
(canary pox, fowl pox) and modiﬁed vaccinia
Ankara (MVA), a highly attenuated host-range-
restricted strain of vaccinia virus. The vaccine
underwent a phase I clinical trial with adeno-
associated virus (AAV) AIDS vaccine in 2005.
The second AIDS vaccine clinical evaluation is
being set up at Tuberculosis Research Centre
(TRC), Chennai. Topical antiviral vaginal gels,
such as Tenofovir, are being also evaluated.
Case Study
A 25-year-old college student, resident of an area
endemic for HIV in Manipur, was admitted with
several complaints. He had serious bouts of diar-
rhoea with a history of marked weight loss during
the past year. He was found to be a drug addict.
His stool samples were positive for oocysts of
Cryptosporidium parvum. The serum was tested
positive for HIV antibodies by ELISA. The per-
son was diagnosed to be suffering from AIDS.

Slow Virus and Prion Diseases
62
Slow virus diseases are a large group of related
neurodegenerative conditions which affect both
humans and animals. The diseases are caused by
a heterogeneous group of agents consisting of
conventional viruses and unconventional agents
called prions. The term ‘slow’ refers to the dis-
ease process and not to the replication of the
viruses that cause the slow disease.
The slow virus diseases are characterised by
(1) chronic infection, (2) a very long incubation
period in years, (3) a slow and progressing course
of infection and (4) being usually fatal. The con-
cept of slow infection was originally suggested
for the scrapie, visna and maedi, the slowly
progressing infection of the sheep, by a veterinary
pathologist, Sigurdsson, in the year 1854.
The slow viruses’ diseases, depending on
agents, can be classiﬁed broadly into two groups:
(1) prion diseases and (2) Slow virus diseases
caused by conventional viruses. A list of slow
infectious diseases caused by prions and conven-
tional viruses is presented in Table 62.1.
Slow Virus Diseases Caused by Prions
The agents causing slow diseases were earlier
called slow viruses, infectious protein, infectious
amyloids or crystal protein. These agents are now
being named prions, and this term has gained
wide acceptance, replacing all the previously
used
terms. The
prions are
unconventional
agents that are not viruses. They are small
protein-containing infectious particles with no
detectable nucleic acid. The protein is yet to be
characterised fully and appears to be a modiﬁed
host protein.

903
The diseases caused by prions are a large
group of related neurodegenerative conditions
which affect both humans and animals. These
diseases belong to a family of diseases known as
transmissible
spongiform
encephalopathies
(TSEs).
Human TSEs caused by prions include Kuru,
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD
(cud),
Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker
(GSS)
syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and spo-
radic fatal insomnia. Animal TSEs caused by
prions include (1) scrapie and visna (diseases of
sheep), (2) bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE; mad cow disease), (3) transmissible mink
encephalopathy and (4) chronic wasting disease
of deer, mule and elk.
Kuru was the ﬁrst human disease known to be
caused by a slow virus or prion (1959). This
condition was found among ‘Fore’ people, a
tribe living in the remote highlands of New
Guinea. This virus was linked to ritualistic canni-
balism prevalent among these tribal people. Hal-
low (1959) suggested that kuru could be a
possible human form of scrapie, a slow viral
disease
seen
in
sheep.
Gajdusek
and
his
colleagues (1966) ﬁrst demonstrated that kuru
was transferable to chimpanzees after a long incu-
bation period, for which they were awarded the
Nobel Prize. Since then, many TSEs linked to

slow viruses have been described both in humans
and animals.

Prions
Prions are small protein-containing infectious
particles with no detectable nucleic acid. They
were suspected to be viruses but otherwise do
not conform to the standard deﬁnition of viruses.
They differ from the viruses in their many
properties (Table 62.2). The prions like viruses
are ﬁlterable. They apparently lack any virion
structure or genome. Unlike viruses, they are
unusually
resistant
to
inactivation
by
heat,
disinfectants and radiation. They do not elicit
any speciﬁc immune response in the infected
host.

Morphology
The prion does not contain any nucleic acid. It
contains an aggregate of hydrophobic glycopro-
tein resistant to protease. The protein present in
humans and other animals is called cellular prion
protein. It is similar to glycoprotein in scrapie,
known as scrapie prion protein, which has a
molecular
weight
ranging
from
27,000
to
30,000 Da. However, it differs from scrapie
prion protein by being sensitive to protease (scra-
pie protein is protease resistant) and being present

in the plasma membrane (scrapie prion protein is
present in cytoplasmic vesicles).
Prions
905
Prion Replication
In experimental animal studies carried out in
chimpanzees,
Prusiner
demonstrated
conclu-
sively that the prion, an aberrant protein, could
cause disease, for which he was awarded Nobel
Prize in 1997. Prusiner hypothesis suggests that
prions do not contain any nucleic acid. The nor-
mal prion protein known as prion protein cellular
or PrPC has a signiﬁcant amount of helical con-
ﬁguration. In its alpha-helical conﬁguration, PrPC
is usually sensitive to degradation by the activity
of enzyme protease. The disease occurs when the
PrPC is reconﬁgured into the beta-sheet conﬁgu-
ration known as prion protein scrapie or PrPSC,
which is resistant to degradation by protease.
These
abnormal
proteins
aggregate
into
ﬁlaments that disrupt neuron functions and
cause the death of cells. The normal alpha-helical
and abnormal beta-pleated sheet forms have the
same amino acid sequences but differ in their
conﬁguration.
Other Properties
Prions are highly resistant to heat at 80
C,
ultraviolet radiation and disinfectants, such as
formaldehyde. They are, however, inactivated
by
phenol,
ether,
sodium
hydroxide
and
hypochlorite.
Prion Isolation
Prions cannot be cultivated in any tissue culture
or isolated in experimental animal models.
Pathogenesis of Prion Diseases
Prion diseases are transmitted either orally or
transcutaneously. A functional immune system
is believed to be essential for replicating prions
and their transport to the reticuloendothelial cells.
Large amounts of prions are present in the follic-
ular dendritic cells and the sympathetic nerve
endings in these cells. The prions reach the CNS
from these sites, but how they reach the CNS is
still an important issue. It is suggested that the
prions may reach the CNS via splanchnic nerves
at the level of the thoracic spinal cord and via
parasympathetic ﬁbres connecting with the brain.
The other possible route is blood circulation.
In experimental animal studies carried out in
chimpanzees, Prusiner demonstrated that scrapie
protein (PrPSC) binds to the normal cellular prion
protein (PrPC) of the host. PrPC is found in most
tissues of the body but is expressed in higher
quantities in the CNS, particularly the neurons,
the main site of action of prions. PrPSC is ingested
by neurons and phagocytic cells but remains
intact without being degraded. This may contrib-
ute to vacuolation of the neuron, a key pathologi-
cal change observed in encephalitis caused by
prions. In addition, the accumulation of prions
in high concentrations causes damage to the
brain tissue. These include the formation of
amyloid-containing plaques and ﬁbrils, prolifera-
tion and hypertrophy of astrocytes and fusion of
neurons and adjacent glial cells.
Pathogenesis
and
transmission
of
prion
diseases in humans are described in Table 62.3.
Clinical Syndromes
Diseases Caused by Prions in Humans
Prion-mediated diseases in humans are called
transmissible
spongiform
encephalopathies
(TSEs). Currently, the most widely accepted
hypothesis is the ‘protein-only hypothesis’, ﬁrst
suggested by Grifﬁth (1965) and re-established
subsequently by Prusiner to indicate that scrapie
is related to a proteinaceous infectious particle
(PrP).
The conditions are characterised by: (1) long
incubation period of several years, (2) course of
illness lasting for months to years, (3) a progres-
sive, debilitating neurological syndrome that is
invariably fatal, (4) associated with pathological
changes typically restricted to the central nervous
system (CNS), (5) absence of speciﬁc immuno-
logical response in the host and (6) the agents are
resistant
to conventionally used inactivation
methods.

Kuru
It was the ﬁrst human disease known to be caused
by a slow virus or prion (1959). This condition
was found among ‘Fore’ people, a tribe living in
the remote highlands of New Guinea. This virus
was linked to ritualistic cannibalism prevalent
among
these
tribal
people.
Hallow
(1959)
suggested that kuru could be a possible human
form of scrapie, a slow viral disease seen in sheep.
Gajdusek
and
his
colleagues
(1966)
ﬁrst
demonstrated
that
kuru
was
transferable
to
chimpanzees after a long incubation period, for
which they were awarded the Nobel Prize. Since
then, many TSEs linked to slow viruses have been
described both in humans and animals.
Kuru is a fatal disease characterised by pro-
gressive cerebellar ataxia and tremors. The condi-
tion manifests initially as difﬁculty in walking,
followed by cerebellar tremor, hence the name
kuru, which means ‘trembling in fear’. Eventu-
ally, the tremor worsens, followed by progressive
cerebellar ataxia and eventual death within a year
of onset of symptoms. The clinical course lasts
from 3 months to 2 years. Kuru has largely
disappeared today because cannibalism has been
abolished now among the Fore tribal people.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is the most com-
mon prion disease responsible for nearly 85% of
all human prion diseases. The condition was
described by Creutzfeldt
(1920) and Jakob
(1921), after whom the disease is named. It is
transmitted by i) cuts in the skin, ii) transplanta-
tion of contaminated tissue (e.g. cornea), iii) use
of contaminated medical devices (e.g. brain
electrodes), and iv) possibly through ingestion
of infected tissue.
CJD is a sub-acute progressive encephalopa-
thy characterised by rapidly progressive dementia
associated with myoclonic jerks. Memory loss,
behavioural changes and confusion are the com-
mon
clinical
manifestations.
The
condition
progresses, and the patient becomes mute and
comatose in the terminal stage of the disease.
The condition is invariably fatal, and death occurs
in about 8 months. An autosomal dominant pat-
tern of inheritance linked to a mutation in the PrP
gene is found in nearly 10% of cases of
familial CJD.
CJD is rare but is found worldwide, with an
incidence
of
about
one
case
per
million
populations. Till 2003, a total of 167 deﬁnite

and probable cases of vCJD have been reported
worldwide. Most of the cases of vCJD have been
reported in the United Kingdom. The condition is
yet to be documented in Asia.
Prions
907
Variant CJD: The vCJD is a new disease
affecting mostly adults aged 45 years. The condi-
tion was ﬁrst documented in Britain in 1985. It is
BSE zoonoses, probably originating from a dou-
ble species switch from sheep scrapie to BSE and
then from BSE to human variant. The vCJD is
believed
to
be
caused
by
ingestion
of
BSE-infected beef products contaminated by neu-
ral tissues. This is because neural tissues have a
much higher concentration of PrPSC compared
with any other non-neural tissue.
Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker Syndrome
and Fatal Familial Insomnia
These are other rare conditions caused by prions
in humans.
Diseases Caused by Prions in Animals
Scrapie
Scrapie is a prototype prion disease of animals. It
is a slow virus disease of the sheep, known for
centuries. The infection is transmitted vertically
from ewe to lamb and less frequently by direct
contact. The incubation period is nearly 2 years.
The condition manifests as intense irritation and
to relieve that the infected animals scratch them-
selves, against trees and rocks, hence the name
scrapie. The condition progresses to emaciation
and paralysis, leading to the animal’s death.
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
Also known as mad cow disease. It is a disease of
cattle. The condition has an incubation period of
2–8 years. The disease is relentlessly progressive
until the animal dies. The cattle feed containing
prion-contaminated meat and bone meal, which
was used as a protein source, was the source of
infection for transmission of BSE to cattle. The
causative agent is believed to be originated from
either
scrapie-affected
sheep
or
cattle
with
unidentiﬁed prion-associated slow virus disease.
The mad cow disease, documented in 1986, has
been described in cattle in the European countries
and the United States. Until 2004, nearly 190,000
conﬁrmed clinical cases of BSE in cattle have
been reported worldwide, most of which were
from the United Kingdom alone.

which is transmitted to mink by feeding the

Chronic Wasting Disease of Deer, Mule and
Elk
Chronic wasting disease is a prion disease of deer,
mule and elk. It is a progressive wasting disease
of these animals in the United States.

have

in
Table 62.4.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of prion diseases is always clinical.
It is usually conﬁrmed by the histopathology of
the brain tissue showing characteristic histologi-
cal changes. No serological tests are available, as
prions are inert agents and do not elicit any
immune response in infected hosts. The prions
cannot be detected in the infected tissue by any

method, including electron microscopy, antigen
detection and genomic methods, such as DNA
probe or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
908
62
Slow Virus and Prion Diseases
Detection of protein 14–3–3 in the CSF by
Western blot is a sensitive and speciﬁc method
in sporadic CJD and vCJD cases. A speciﬁc
reduction in uric acid level in the CSF has been
shown in vCJD but not in sporadic CJD, thus
facilitating the differential diagnosis of vCJD.
Treatment
No speciﬁc treatment is available for any prion
disease.
Epidemiology
Prion-related diseases, although rare, are present
worldwide.
Geographical Distribution
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is rare but is found
worldwide, with an incidence of about one case
per million populations. An autosomal dominant
pattern of inheritance linked to a mutation in the
PrP gene is found in nearly 10% of cases of
familial CJD. Till 2003, a total of 167 deﬁnite
and probable cases of vCJD have been reported
worldwide. Most of the cases of vCJD have been
reported in the United Kingdom. The condition is
yet to be documented in Asia. Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease syndrome and fatal familial insomnia
(FFI) in humans are rare but occur in different
parts of the world.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
The spongiform encephalopathies caused by
prions may be infectious, hereditary and sporadic.
The CJD, GSS and FFI are inheritable. The CNS
tissue in CJD has the highest concentration of
prion agents, hence the most important infection
source. Unlike the prion disease, in vCJD, lym-
phoid tissues show the highest concentration of
prions. Contaminated blood is another source of
infection.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease
is
transmitted
by (1) cuts in the skin and transplantation of
contaminated tissue (e.g. cornea), (2) use of
contaminated
medical
devices
(e.g.
brain
electrodes), (3) possibly through ingestion of
infected tissue and (4) blood transfusion. Brain
surgery patients, transplant patients and surgeons
also are at risk for CJD and GSS disease. Sporadic
CJD is a type of infection that refers to the occur-
rence of disease in the absence of an infectious or
hereditary form of the disease.
Prevention and Control
Prions are resistant not only to protease degrada-
tion but also to radiation, heat and other agents
that
destroy
proteins.
They
are,
however,
inactivated by phenol, ether, sodium hydroxide
and hypochlorite. Hence, the materials from
patients with CJD or vCJD must be handled
with special care. To prevent these diseases, spe-
cial disinfection protocols have been developed
by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These
include autoclaving at 15 lbs for 1 h (instead of
20 min) or treatment with 0.1 M sodium hydrox-
ide and 5% hypochlorite solution.
Slow Virus Diseases Caused by
Conventional Viruses
Humans
Sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and
progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML) are the slow virus diseases caused by
conventional viruses in humans.
Sub-acute Sclerosing Panencephalitis
(SSPE)
The sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
is a degenerating disease of the CNS caused by
persistent measles infection. It is persistent infec-
tion by a variant measles virus that fails to com-
plete its replication. The disease is characterised
by the development of behavioural and intellec-
tual deterioration and seizures after many years
(mean incubation period is 10.8 years)
of

infection by measles. This is a serious and late
neurological
sequel
of
measles
that
affects
the CNS.
Slow Virus Diseases Caused by Conventional Viruses
909
The condition occurs in about seven in every
one million patients. The condition is associated
with the presence of an extremely high measles
antibody titre in the blood and CSF. Inclusion
bodies, which react with antibodies to the measles
virus, are present in the affected neurons.
Progressive Multifocal
Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML) is a fatal demyelinating disease of the
white matter of the brain. The condition is usually
fatal.
It
occurs
primarily
in
persons
with
compromised cell-mediated immunity, such as
patients with AIDS and those receiving immuno-
suppressive drugs and anticancer therapy.
The virus following the infection kills oligo-
dendroglia and causes syncytia in astrocytes. The
condition progresses rapidly to blindness, demen-
tia and coma. Laboratory diagnosis of the condi-
tion is made by PCR for viral genome in the brain
tissue or CSF.
Animals
Visna
Visna is a disease of sheep caused by the visna
virus, a lentivirus. It is a single-stranded RNA
virus with an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase
in the virion. Integration of the DNA provirus into
the host cell DNA appears to be responsible for
the persistence of the virus within the host. Clini-
cally, the condition manifests after a long incuba-
tion period with a prolonged progressive course.
It has an insidious onset with paresis, progressing
to total paralysis and death. The viruses are
present in the infected animal’s saliva, blood,
and CSF. High levels of serum antibodies are
present in the serum, but these are not protective.
Maedi
This is also a disease of sheep caused by the same
lentivirus. The difference in the site of infection
results in two different clinical entities, Unlike
visna, which affects the animal’s brain, maedi is
manifested as interstitial pneumonia as the virus
affects the lungs. The major mode of transmission
of the disease in animals is via infected body
ﬂuids and colostrum. It affects animals older
than 2 years, and once the symptoms set in, life
expectancy is reduced to a year. Besides pulmo-
nary disease, it can also affect the mammary
glands and joints. Presently, there are no appro-
priate treatment modalities or vaccines against the
disease, thus causing a huge economic loss in the
animal population.
Case Study
A 45-year-old adult, resident of the United King-
dom, was admitted with presentations of memory
loss, behavioural changes and confusion. Ataxia,
aphasia, visual loss and hemiparesis were the
other manifestations. Subsequently, the patient
became comatose and died within a week of
admission. The patient was strongly suspected to
be suffering from CJD.

Oncogenic Viruses
63
Oncogenic viruses can produce tumours in their
natural host or experimental animals or malignant
transformation of the cell culture. In 1911, Rous
ﬁrst time showed the ability of a virus to cause
malignancy in fowl; this virus is called as fowl
sarcoma virus. For this discovery, he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1966. In 1932 and
1933, Shope isolated rabbit ﬁbroma virus and
papilloma virus, respectively. He was the ﬁrst
person to demonstrate the implication of viruses
in animal malignancies. In 1957, Stewart and
Eddy demonstrated the oncogenic capability of
the polyoma virus. They injected polyoma virus
into newborn mice to produce various neoplasms,
and the results of these experiments arose the
interest of many scientists to further conduct stud-
ies on oncogenic viruses. The Epstein Barr virus
causes the Burkitt lymphoma in African children.
At present, it is regarded that oncogenic
viruses are responsible for 10–20% of human
malignancies. Thus far, approximately 150 animal
viruses are known to possess oncogenic potential,
which contains both DNA and RNA viruses.
Important
oncogenic
viruses
are
listed
in
Table 63.1.
Oncogenic DNA Viruses
Some oncogenic DNA viruses are associated with
malignancies in humans and animals. DNA of
oncogenic viruses or a part of this DNA is found
to be integrated with the host cell genome. Since
the viral DNA is either incomplete or defective,
there is no possibility of producing an infectious
virus; nevertheless, the host cell will undergo
malignant changes under the inﬂuence of the
virus. The cancer cell formed as the result of the
virus is analogous to the lysogenised bacterium
by a defective phage. Yet the cell is not destroyed
in both cases.

Papovaviruses
Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 types
have a signiﬁcant association with cervical and
uterine cancer. HeLa, a continuous cell line used
by cell culture laboratories, was derived decades
back from a cervical cancer patient. This cell line
was found to have HPV-18 DNA in it.
Polyoma virus that includes BK and JC
viruses, usually causes asymptomatic human
infections. However, these viruses can induce
tumour
formation
in
immunosuppressive
individuals.
Simian virus 40 transforms cultured cells,
including cell lines derived from human cells.
Poxvirus
Among poxviruses, rabbit ﬁbroma, molluscum
contagiosum and Yaba virus are known to induce
benign tumours. Experimentally tumours can be
produced in animals as well as humans. However,

the tumour will regress in a week without any
treatment.

inoculation, but they do not have any role in
human malignancy.
Herpes Virus
It

been
proven
that
many
herpesvirus
associations in various types of human and ani-
mal cancers.
Marek disease is an infectious disease of
chickens caused by a herpes virus. It is contagious
neurolymphomatosis and causes paralysis or
initiates widespread tumour formation. The dis-
ease can be prevented by vaccination (a live avir-
ulent vaccine). Interestingly, it is the only
available
viral
vaccine
that
can
prevent
malignancy.
Lucke tumour of frogs is a renal adenocarci-
noma
of
frog
regarded
to
be
caused
by
herpesvirus.
Herpesvirus saimiri virus was ﬁrst isolated
from the squirrel monkey kidney cell line. When
experimentally injected into monkeys or rabbits,
it causes fatal lymphoma or reticulum cell
sarcoma.
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) or human herpes-
virus 4 (HSV-4) is the causative agent of infec-
tious mononucleosis. Epstein–Barr virus is also
the ﬁrst virus known to be associated with human
malignancies, such as Burkitt lymphoma, other
B-cell lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HSV-8) is associated
with Kaposi sarcoma and also with body cavity
lymphoma
and
Castleman
disease.
DNA
sequences of HSV-8 have been identiﬁed in
patients with Kaposi sarcoma. This virus, also
known as KS-associated herpesvirus, is believed
to be important in causing and/or maintaining
lesions in Kaposi sarcoma. The lesion in Kaposi
sarcoma begins as a red-purple or dusky area
that enlarges into a plaque and progresses
subsequently into a tumorous growth. This

condition is observed most commonly not only in
immunosuppressed patients but also occurs in
children, although rarely.
Oncogenic RNA Viruses
913
Cytomegalovirus infection was found to have
an association with Kaposi sarcoma and prostate
cancer.
Hepatitis B Virus
The virus usually causes chronic disease and is
associated
with
hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Approximately 20% of HBsAg carriers, nearly
1% of all adult patients infected with HBV and
a high percentage of neonates infected with the
virus develop hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrho-
sis. The hepatocellular carcinoma appears to
result from persistent cellular regeneration that
tends to replace the dead hepatocytes. Also, it is
suggested that the integration of HBV DNA with
hepatocytes DNA could activate a cellular onco-
gene, resulting in loss of control of the growth of
hepatocytes. However, the HBV genome has no
oncogene, which can be responsible directly for
causing hepatocellular carcinoma.
Oncogenic RNA Viruses
Retroviruses
Retroviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded,
spherical RNA viruses showing a characteristic
morphology
and
unusual
replication
mode.
The
presence
of
an
unusual
enzyme—the
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase or reverse
transcriptase, giving the virus its name (retro
meaning reverse)—is the unique feature of the
viruses belonging to the family Retroviridae.
Table 63.2 Characteristics of retroviruses
Retroviruses

Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1, HTLV-2,
HTLV-5), Rous sarcoma virus (chickens)

Human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV-1, HIV-2), Visna
virus (sheep), caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (goats)

immunosuppression; have D-type, cylindrical
nucleocapsid core
Human foamy virus
Shows vacuolated foamy cytopathology; no clinical

Human placental virus
Have retrovirus sequences that are integrated into human
genome
The enzyme reverse transcriptase prepares a
DNA copy of the retroviral RNA genome—
initially RNA–DNA hybrid and subsequently
forms double-stranded DNA. The DNA copy
of the viral genome is known as provirus. The
provirus is then integrated into the host cell
DNA to become a cellular gene for the rest of
the cell’s life. This is in contrast to the classical
transcription of the genetic information from
DNA to RNA and then to proteins. Baltimore
and Tenin were the ﬁrst to demonstrate that
the
retroviruses
encode
an
RNA-dependent
DNA polymerase and replicate through a DNA
intermediate.
Properties
of
various
retroviruses
are
summarised in Table 63.2.
Classification
All oncogenic RNA viruses are classiﬁed in the
family Retroviridae, but all retroviruses are not
oncogenic. The family Retroviridae are classiﬁed
into three subfamilies, as follows:
Oncovirinae
The oncovirinae or oncoviruses include only the
retroviruses that can transform target cells. The
viruses depending on their core and capsid, as
demonstrated in electron microscopy, are classi-
ﬁed further into types A, B, C or D. These include
human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-1, HTLV-
2, HTLV-3 and HTLV-4) (Table 63.3).

Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma
Human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV-1, HIV-2)
Acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome
Lentivirinae
The lentivirinae or lentiviruses are slow (lent:
slow) viruses associated with neurological and
immunosuppressive diseases in humans and
animals. These include human immunodeﬁciency
viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2), sheep’s Visna virus and
caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus of goat.
Spumavirinae
These consist of spumaviruses that contain
non-oncogenic ‘foamy viruses’ (spuma: foam).
These viruses are associated with asymptomatic
infection in animals but are not associated with
human diseases. The idea that a virus could cause
cancer was ﬁrst hypothesised by Peyton Rous
(1911)
when
he
transmitted
solid
tumours
(sarcomas) of chicken by transplanting tissue.
The belief that retroviruses could be associated
with human leukaemia was not in favour till the
discovery of the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV)
and gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV) in the
1970s.
In the 1960s, Tenin was the ﬁrst to predict that
retroviruses could replicate their RNA genome by
transcribing it into DNA by the enzyme reverse
transcriptase. The results of a study supported this
observation
reported
separately
by
David
Baltimore. The discovery of reverse transcriptase
was revolutionary because it contradicted the cen-
tral dogma of molecular biology that genetic
information is passed in one direction from
DNA to RNA and then to protein. Baltimore
and Tenin were awarded the Nobel Prize for
their revolutionary work, which subsequently
contributed
immensely to
the progress
and
developments in molecular biology.
Minna and Gazdar were the ﬁrst to detect the
ﬁrst human leukemic retrovirus in 1979. How-
ever, it was Poiesz and Gallo in 1980 who con-
clusively demonstrated the infectivity, antibody
response and evidence of provirus from the ﬁrst
human T-cell lymphotropic virus, or HTLV-1,
isolated from a patient with a cutaneous T-cell
malignancy. Subsequently, many human cancers
caused by HTLV-1 were reported from different
parts of the world.
Morphology
The retroviruses are enveloped, mostly spherical
viruses that measure 80–120 nm in size. The
virus’s envelope is acquired by budding from
the
plasma
membrane
and
contains
viral
glycoprotein.
Virus Genome
The virus consists of two identical copies of the
linear, single, positive-stranded RNA genome.
The virus also contains the cellular transfer
RNAs (tRNAs), and the enzymes reverse tran-
scriptase and integrase. The tRNAs are used as
primers for the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
The presence of the enzyme reverse transcrip-
tase—an unusual RNA-dependent DNA poly-
merase enzyme—is the characteristic feature of
retroviruses. The enzyme prepares a copy from
RNA to DNA, unlike the classical transcription of
genetic information from DNA to RNA. Reverse
transcriptase prepares a DNA copy of the retrovi-
ral RNA genome which is initially an RNA–DNA
hybrid but later forms a double-stranded DNA
provirus. Infection with oncogenic retroviruses
leads to the integration of the provirus randomly
with the host chromosome, and it becomes a
cellular gene for the rest of the life of the cell.
The genome of the simple retroviruses consists
of three major genes that encode glycoproteins of
the virus. These are gag, pol and env genes. The
gag gene encodes for group-speciﬁc antigens,

capsid proteins; pol gene for enzymes polymer-
ase, protease and integrase and env gene for enve-
lope glycoproteins. Proteolytic cleavage of the
polyprotein encoded by the env gene leads to the
production of the viral glycoproteins (Fig. 63.1).

The complex retroviruses, HTLV and the
lentiviruses, including HIV, consist of several
accessory genes, such as tat, rev, nef, vif and
vpu for HIV. These genes also encode several
regulatory proteins that require more complex
transcriptional
processing
than
the
simple
retroviruses. Various retrovirus genes and their

Host Specificity
Retroviruses are mostly found to infect only one
host species. Retroviruses can be classiﬁed based
on their ability to grow in different species’ cells.
Amphotropic retrovirus multiplies in the cells of
native and foreign species. Ecotropic retroviruses
multiply in cells of native host species only,
whereas xenotropic retroviruses can multiply
only in foreign species but not native species.
Virus Antigens
Two types of antigens are present in retroviruses.
These are group-speciﬁc nucleoprotein antigen in
the virion core and type-speciﬁc glycoprotein
antigen in the envelope.
Other Properties
Retroviruses are heat labile, readily destroyed on
exposure to heat at 56 C for 30 min. The viruses
are also readily inactivated on treatment with mild
acids, ether and formalin. They are stable on
storage at 30 C.
Pathogenesis of Retrovirus Infections
Provirus and oncogenes are two key components
that play a very important role in the pathogenesis
of tumours induced by viruses. In the provirus
model, the gene enters the cell at the time of

infection by the tumour virus. In the oncogene
model, the genes for malignancy are already pres-
ent in all body cells by virtue of being present in
the sperm and egg.
916
63
Oncogenic Viruses
The oncogenic viruses can transform the cells
in cultures and induce tumours in animals. The
retroviruses may induce tumours by either i)
by inducing or altering the expression of a
pre-existing cellular gene or ii) by introducing a
new transforming gene (oncogene) into the cellu-
lar genome.
Oncogenes
Oncogenes may be of two types: viral oncogenes
and cellular oncogenes.
Viral Oncogenes
These are the genes that encode proteins that
induce the transformation of normal cells into
malignant cells. The viral oncogenes are usually
of host cell origin. These oncogenes encode
proteins that promote cell growth and several
functions. Viral oncogenes initiate inappropriate
cell growth and malignant transformation but are
not required to replicate viruses. Viral oncogenes
of DNA and RNA viruses are summarised in
Table 63.5.
Cellular Oncogenes
These genes resembling viral oncogenes may be
of two types: cellular oncogenes and proto-
oncogenes. The oncogenes isolated from cancer
cells are known as cellular oncogenes (c-onc),
while similar genes found in normal cells are
called proto-oncogenes. More than 20 cellular
oncogenes have been identiﬁed to date. Some
cellular oncogenes are expressed during normal
embryonic development. The proto-oncogenes
are found widely in invertebrates. These genes
encode proteins essential for cell growth regula-
tion and differentiation.

It is postulated that the cellular oncogenes may
serve as a precursor of viral oncogenes. Both
cellular oncogenes and viral oncogenes are simi-
lar but not identical. They differ from each other
by their base sequences. Moreover, cellular
oncogenes consist of introns characteristic of
eukaryotic genes, but viral oncogenes do not con-
tain any of these eukaryotic genes.
Transfection
It is the method of study of oncogenes that can be
demonstrated in mouse ﬁbroblast cell lines, such
as NIH 3T3. Foreign DNA is taken up by these
cells,
incorporated
into
their
genome
and
transfected into the host cells, resulting in the
formation of transforming genes. These genes
are identical to that of cellular oncogenes.
Retroviruses (such as HTLV or HIV) carry a
fourth gene, namely, tax or tat, next to the env
gene. The tax or tat is a transactivating gene that
regulates the function of the viral genes. The
oncogenic retroviruses may be slow transforming
viruses or acute transforming viruses.
Slow transforming viruses, such as chronic
leukaemia viruses, have low oncogenic potency
and induce malignant changes, usually only in
blood cells and after a long latent period. They
replicate normally and do not transform cultured
cells.

Oncogenic RNA Viruses
917
Acute transforming viruses, in contrast, are
highly oncogenic. They induce malignancy in
infected cells after a short latent period of weeks
or months. They transform cells in culture and
can cause different types of malignancies, such as
sarcoma, carcinoma and leukaemia. Unlike slow
transforming viruses, the acute transforming viruses
are unable to replicate normally because they carry
an additional gene, the viral oncogene (v-onc gene),
on their genome, which replaces some of the genes
necessary for the replication of viruses. The v-onc
gene can replicate only if co-infected with a stan-
dard helper retrovirus. Therefore, most of these
acute transforming viruses are replication-defective
viruses (Table 63.6). Various viruses associated
with human cancers are listed in Table 63.7.

Animals
Sarcoma and Acute Leukaemia Viruses
The sarcoma and acute leukaemia viruses cause
infection primarily in animals. They are not
associated with any human infections. The avian
leukosis complex virus includes a group of anti-
genically related viruses which induce avian leu-
kosis or sarcoma in fowls.
Leukaemia Viruses
These are slow oncogenic viruses that induce
malignancies after a long latency period of even
30 years. These viruses promote cancerous
growth indirectly compared to the oncogene-
encoded acute leukaemia or sarcoma viruses.
These viruses speciﬁcally have a tax gene,
which is a transcriptional regulator and is capable
of activating LTR sequences that enhance the
expression of cellular growth genes. This leads
to uncontrolled cell growth, transforming the cells
neoplastically or promoting other genetic changes
over a long period.

918

Oncogenic Viruses
Other Viruses
Murine leukosis viruses, which consist of several
strains of murine leukaemia and sarcoma viruses,
are associated with infections in mice. Mammary
tumour virus of mice is associated with mammary
cancer only in certain susceptible strains of mice
having a high natural incidence of breast cancer.
Leukosis sarcoma viruses of other animals consist
of a large number of viruses that have been
associated with leukosis and sarcoma in cats,
hamsters, rats, guinea pigs and monkeys.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Most endogenous retroviral infections can be
detected by molecular techniques, such as nucleic
acid hybridisation or by activation after exposure
to radiation or chemicals.
Treatment
No speciﬁc treatment is available for the manage-
ment of retroviral infections.
Epidemiology
Retroviruses are documented from different host
species worldwide. Retroviruses show host spec-
iﬁcity, the speciﬁcity being determined mainly by
the presence of viral receptors on the host cell
surfaces.
Retroviruses can be transmitted in two ways:
exogenous and endogenous. Most oncogenic
retroviruses are exogenous. They are transmitted
horizontally. Endogenous retroviruses are trans-
mitted vertically from parents to offspring, and
the process is mediated by the provirus integrated
with the germline cell genome. This provirus
behaves like a cellular gene and is under the
regulatory control of the host cell.
Human T-Lymphotropic Viruses
(HTLV)
Human T-lymphocytic virus (HTLV) and HIV
are two important members of the retrovirus
family. Both the viruses are enveloped viruses.
Both have enzyme reverse transcriptase in the
virion and two copies of a single-stranded, posi-
tive-polarity
RNA
genome.
HIV
has
been
described in Chap. 65.
HTLV has six distinct retroviruses (HTLV-1
HTLV-2, HTLV-3, HTLV-4, HIV-1 and HIV-2),
but only HTLV-1 has been associated with
human disease.
Morphology
HTLV is an enveloped, spherical virus measuring
100 nm in diameter. The virus consists of a
single-stranded RNA with a diploid genome,
which has the property to replicate through
DNA intermediary and can integrate into the
host T cell genome as a provirus. It is morpho-
logically similar to HIV, but it has a centrally
located nucleocapsid core in a mature virion.
Virus Genome
HTLV has a unique genome. The genome
contains LTRs, which encode many polyproteins
processed by virally encoded protease and cellu-
lar protease into functional peptides. The gene px
encodes for Tax and Rex proteins, which regulate
gene expression in the virus. The genome has the
same gag-pol-env motif with LTR sequences as
HIV, but it differs from HIV by having a fourth
sequence (xp), which participates in transcription.
The oncoviruses include HTLV-1, HTLV-
2 and HTLV-3, but only HTLV-1 has been
associated with human disease.
Virus Replication
The HTLV has two important genes, tax and rex,
regulating viral replication.
The main function of the tax gene is the
transactivation of viral and cellular genes. It is a
transcriptional activator, which enhances the tran-
scription of the viral genome from the promoter
gene sequences in the LTR. It also activates
other genes, including those for interleukin
(IL)-2, IL-3, GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor) and the receptor for

IL-2. Activation of this gene promotes the growth
of infected T cells. The main function of the tax
gene is the transactivation of viral and cellular
genes.
Human T-Lymphotropic Viruses (HTLV)
919
Rex gene regulates RNA splicing and promo-
tion of export to the cytoplasm. It encodes two
proteins that bind to the structure of the viral
mRNA,
preventing
splicing
and
promoting
mRNA transport to the cytoplasm. Later during
the course of infection, the rex gene selectively
enhances the expression of the singly sliced struc-
tural genes, which are required in large quantities.
HTLV primarily infects CD4+ cells. The virus
enters the cell, and within the cytoplasm, reverse
transcriptase of the virion synthesises a DNA
copy of the genome. The genome is then
transported into the nucleus and is integrated
with the cell DNA by the virally encoded
integrase, resulting in an infection. The host cell
RNA polymerase makes viral RNA, and tran-
scription is upregulated by Tax protein. The latter
facilitates transcription of the viral genome, and
Rex protein modulates the processing of viral
pre-mRNA.
Pathogenesis of HTLV Infection
HTLV-1 is a lymphotropic virus. The HTLVs are
distinguished from HIV as they cause lymphopro-
liferative disorder, whereas HIV causes lympho-
cytosis. It enters the host by sexual intercourse,
breastfeeding or blood transfusion.
After entry in humans, the virus spreads
through circulation and infects the CD4 helper
and
DTH
(delayed-type
hypersensitivity)
T
cells. These T cells are most commonly present
in the skin and the neurons. Recent evidences
show that glucose transporter (GLUT-1) is a sup-
portive receptor for HTLV-1 cell entry. The ubiq-
uitous distribution of GLUT-1 may help explain
the viral tropism of HTLV-1. HTLV predomi-
nantly infects and integrates lymphocytes.
The virus predominantly infects and integrates
lymphocytes. Once the infection is transmitted,
the tax gene (which encodes Tax protein)
transactivates the cellular genes for T-cell growth
factor and IL-2 and their receptors, all of which
activate growth in the infected cells.
There is a long latency period of approxi-
mately 30 years before the onset of leukaemia.
Although the exact mechanism of viral pathogen-
esis of T-cell leukaemia that occurs in 3–5% of
individuals is unknown, in vitro studies have
shown that the tax gene plays an important role.
It has been demonstrated that HTLV can spread
by cell-to-cell contact without replication, but it is
not clear how HTLV crosses the blood–brain
barrier to cause neurological sequelae of HTLV
infection.
Clinical Presentations
HTLV-1 is associated with the following clinical
conditions.
Adult T-cell leukaemia is seen in approxi-
mately 1 in 20 persons infected by HTLV-1
over 30–50 years. Lymphadenopathy (both in
the periphery and within the body cavities)
represents the classic form of ATL. Hepatosple-
nomegaly, hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions
are the other manifestations.
Myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis is a
slowly progressing degenerative disease that pri-
marily affects the corticospinal tract of the tho-
racic spinal cord. Patients with HAM/TSP may
present with weakness and stiffness in lower
limbs, urinary incontinence and lower back pain.
Uveitis is a less frequent manifestation. The
condition is associated with the presence of
HTLV-infected lymphocytes in the eye’s vitreous
ﬂuid. Infectious dermatitis is a chronic and
severe form of dermatitis seen during childhood.
Laboratory Diagnosis
A biopsy is useful for the deﬁnitive diagnosis and
classiﬁcation of HTLV. The presence of convo-
luted nuclei, also known as cloverleaf or ﬂower
lymphocytes, in the peripheral blood is typical of
ATL. Provirus can also be demonstrated in these
malignant cells. Western blot, immunoﬂuores-
cence
antibody
test
and
HTLV-ELISA
are

serological tests used to diagnose HTLV-1 infec-
tion. HTLV-ELISA is a frequently used test to
demonstrate antibodies in the serum to diagnose
HTLV-1 infection. High false positivity is a noted
problem with ELISA, particularly in low preva-
lence areas. Hence, all HTLV-ELISA-positive
cases must be conﬁrmed with Western blot,
immunoﬂuorescence antibody test or polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).
920
63
Oncogenic Viruses
PCR is useful to distinguish between HTLV-1
and HTLV-2 infections. It is also useful in infants
who are suspected of having false-positive results
due to the presence of circulating maternal anti-
HTLV antibodies.
Treatment
No speciﬁc treatment is available for the manage-
ment of HTLV-1 infection. But a, limited success
has been obtained in chemotherapy of some
patients
with
a
combination
of
AZT
and
interferon-alpha. However, no known regimen
increases the survival time of the patients beyond
2 years. Relapse is common.
Epidemiology
HTLV-1 infection is endemic in Japan, South
America, Northern Oceania and Tropical Africa
and the Caribbean ocean. Few foci of infection
have also been documented in Asia in the
Philippines. HTLV-1 is transmitted from mother
to child through breast milk during breastfeeding
or childbirth. In adults, transmission is primarily
through sexual contact. Apparently, a prolonged
period of sexual contact is necessary to transmit
the
disease.
Homosexual
contact,
however,
appears to play a less important role in the trans-
mission of the disease. Blood transfusion and
intravenous drug abuse are also other important
modes of transmission of HTLV-1.
Prevention and Control
Preventive measures include health education,
which
should
focus
on
i)
avoidance
of
breastfeeding by known infective mothers, ii)
use of safe sexual practices by couples and iii)
screening of blood donors for HTLV antibodies.
Endogenous Retroviruses
Endogenous retroviruses are those retroviruses
that are integrated into and become part of
chromosomes in humans and animals. These
proviruses are similar to those of HTLV, mouse
mammary tumour virus and other retroviruses
that have been detected in humans. These viruses
cannot usually replicate because they are poorly
transcribed or because of the deletion of the inser-
tion of termination codons.
Case Study
A 35-year-old man, a resident of an area endemic
for HTLV infection in Japan, was admitted with
the presentation of weakness and stiffness in
lower limbs, urinary incontinence and lower
back pain for 3 months. The person gave a history
of receiving blood transfusion nearly 2 years
back. Serum was positive by HTLV-ELISA.
The person was suspected to be suffering from
HTLV-1-associated myelopathy.

Miscellaneous Viruses
64
Miscellaneous viruses described in this chapter
include a diverse group of viruses that have
been increasingly associated with infections in
humans. These viruses include papovaviruses,
parvoviruses,
rubella
virus,
Norwalk
virus,
viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) viruses, arena
viruses, members of Reoviridae, coronaviruses,
including the most recently described severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated
coronavirus
(SARS-CoV),
and
Zika
virus
(ZIKV).
Papovaviruses
The
family
Papovaviridae
consists
of
papovaviruses, which are a group of viruses
containing small, enveloped, icosahedral capsid
with a double-stranded, circular DNA. The term
papova is derived from the ﬁrst two letters of the
names of the viruses (pa, papillomaviruses; po,
polyomaviruses; and va, vacuolating agents). The
family is divided into two genera Papillomavirus
and Polyomavirus. Currently, the genus Papillo-
mavirus
is
separated
into
a
new
family,
Papovaviridae, and the genus Polyomavirus into
a new family Polyomaviridae.
The papovaviruses encode proteins that pro-
mote
cell
growth.
They
induce
both
lytic
infections and tumours (benign or malignant).
These viruses are capable of causing lytic,
chronic,
latent
or
transforming
infections
depending on the host cells infected (Table 64.1).

Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs)
Human papovaviruses (HPVs) are the causative
agents of warts and are also associated with other
cancerous conditions.
Morphology and Other Properties
It is a double-stranded DNA virus without any
envelope (50–55 nm).
The viral genome is a supercoiled, double-
stranded
DNA
composed
of
approximately
3000 bp. The DNA encodes seven to eight early
genes (E1–E8) and two late (L1 and L2)
genomes. The viruses replicate and assemble in
the nucleus. The early genes of the virus are
responsible for the growth of the cells and facili-
tate replication of the viral genome during cell
division. They show widespread diversity; more
than 100 distinct HPV have been recognised.
The viruses do not grow on any cell cultures.
Pathogenesis of HPV Infection
HPV show a high degree of host speciﬁcity. They
show a high predilection for the skin and also for
the mucous membrane. HPV infection is acquired
by close contact, and it infects the skin or mucous
membranes. Tissue tropism and the manifestation
of the disease depend on the HPV type that causes
the disease. The virus replicates in the squamous

epithelium of the skin to cause warts and in the
mucous membrane to induce cancerous epithelial
proliferation. HPV-16 and HPV-18, HPV-33 and
HPV-35 have been linked with verruciform pro-
liferation in the oral cavity, oral pre-malignant
lesions and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The
presence of the koilocytes is the hallmark of HPV
infections of the skin. The cell-mediated immu-
nity (CMI) plays an important role in the resolu-
tion of the disease.

Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of the wart is made by histology.
Demonstration of hyperplasia of the prickle cells
and excessive production of keratin (hyperkerato-
sis) is the diagnosis of the condition. DNA probe
and PCR are useful for detecting HPV in cervical
swabs of tissue specimens. Cell cultures are not
useful because HPVs do not grow in cell lines.
Serology is rarely used.
Treatment
Warts can be removed by surgical cryotherapy,
electrocautery or chemical reagents.

Parvoviruses
923
Epidemiology
HPV infections are found worldwide. HPVs are
found in genital secretions, skin shedding, etc.
Infected humans are the main source of infection.
HPV infection is transmitted by direct contact
through abrasions in the skin and mucosa, pas-
sage through the infected birth canal and sexual
contact.
Prevention and Control
There are no speciﬁc preventive measures avail-
able against HPV infection. Avoidance of direct
contact with infected warts may prevent transmis-
sion. Safe sexual practice is useful to prevent
sexual transmission of HPV.
Vaccines are available against HPV. Three
HPV
vaccines,
namely
9-valent
HPV
vaccine (Gardasil 9, 9vHPV), quadrivalent HPV
vaccine (Gardasil, 4vHPV) and bivalent HPV
vaccine (Cervarix, 2vHPV), have been licensed
and are available. All three HPV vaccines protect
against HPV types 16 and 18 that cause most
HPV cancers. CDC recommends that 11 to
12 years olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine
6 to 12 months apart. Young adults within the age
of 26 need three doses of the HPV vaccine. Vac-
cination is not recommended for those older than
age 26 years.
Human Polyomaviruses
SV40 is the prototype polyomaviruses. BK and
JC viruses are the other human polyomaviruses.
Various polyomaviruses show different host
speciﬁcities. Pathogenesis of the human poly-
omavirus infection in humans depends on the
host’s immune status. In the immunocompetent
host, the replication of viruses is inhibited.
Suppression of immunity in patients receiving
an organ transplant or suffering from AIDS
results in reactivation of latent JC and BK viruses.
Reactivation of BK viruses causes severe urinary
tract infection, and that of JC viruses causes infec-
tion of the CNS. The BK, JC and SV40 viruses
are known to cause tumours in animals but not in
humans.
The
BK
virus
is
associated
with
haemorrhagic
cystitis
in
the
bone
marrow
recipients and with urethral stenosis in kidney
transplant recipients. JC virus is the causative
agent of PML.
Electron
microscopy
(EM)
is
useful
to
detect the JC virus in brain tissue from the
cases of PML and in the urine of a kidney trans-
plant recipient. Immunoperoxidase and in situ
immunoﬂuorescence are also used to detect viral
antigens in brain tissue. The BK polyomavirus is
isolated from urine by culture in human diploid
ﬁbroblasts. JC virus is isolated from urine and
brain tissue by culture in human foetal glial cell
culture. Both DNA probe and PCR are newer,
sensitive methods for detecting BK virus and JC
virus in the urine, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) or
biopsy tissue.
No speciﬁc antiviral treatment is available for
polyomavirus infections in humans. Prevention is
difﬁcult due to the ubiquitous presence of these
viruses. The differences between the human
papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses are listed
in Table 64.3.
Parvoviruses
Parvoviruses are the smallest of the DNA viruses
belonging to the family Parvoviridae. They are
icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses containing
single-stranded DNA. Human parvovirus B19
(B19) is the only known parvovirus that is patho-
genic for humans, and it shows tropism for ery-
throid progenitor cells.
Parvovirus B19
The B19 viruses are extremely small viruses
(18–26
nm)
and
possess
a
non-enveloped,
icosahedral capsid. The viral genome contains
single-stranded DNA. Replication of the virus
occurs in the nucleus. Thus far, only one serotype
of the B19 virus is known to occur.
B19 virus shows tropism for bone marrow
cells, erythroid
cells from foetal liver and



erythroid leukaemia
cells.
The
virus enters
cells through the P blood antigen receptors on
the erythrocyte precursors. Host immunity to
B19
virus
infection
is
primarily
antibody
mediated. The role of CMI in the B19 virus is
unknown.

The virus causes ﬂu-like illness, erythema

women and chronic B19 infection. The human
infections caused by the B19 virus are listed in
Table 64.4.
B19 virus is distributed worldwide, and it
is strictly a human disease. The infection is
transmitted by the vertical transmission during
birth, the respiratory route through respiratory
secretions and percutaneous exposure to blood
and transfusion of blood and blood products.
Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immuno-
ﬂuorescence assay (IFA) are used to demonstrate
IgG and IgM antibodies in diagnosing erythema

Bocavirus
Bocavirus belongs to the family Parvoviridae,
which is a newly identiﬁed member of this fam-
ily.
They
are
small
and
non-enveloped,
containing single-stranded DNA. This virus is
commonly isolated from infants and children
presenting
with
pneumonia
or
diarrhoeal
symptoms. It has also been isolated in patients
suffering from other viral infections.
Although it has been associated with many
clinical symptoms, its deﬁnitive role in human
infections or disease is not well established. So
far, no diagnostic tests are available for bocavirus
detection, and also there are no established
guidelines to treat bocavirus-associated diseases.
In the research setup, this virus can be identiﬁed
by PCR.

Rubella Virus
925
Rubella Virus
Rubella is an RNA virus classiﬁed as a rubivirus
in the family Togaviridae. The name rubella,
given by Henry Veale in 1866, is derived from
the red-coloured rash accompanying the illness.
Owing to similarity in presentation, rubella was
distinguished from a more serious infectious dis-
ease, measles, in the early nineteenth century. In
the nineteenth century, it came to be called Ger-
man measles, when German physicians closely
studied the disease. In 1942, Norman Gregg
noticed
that
ﬁrst-trimester
maternal
rubella
caused serious birth defects. The full spectrum
of rubella embryopathy remained unclear until
rubella virus was isolated in tissue culture in
1962 by two independent groups comprising
Parkman, Buescher and Artenstein in one of the
groups and Neva and Weller in the other.
Morphology
Rubella is a pleomorphic, roughly spherical virus
measuring 50–70 nm in diameter (Fig. 64.1). It
consists of a single-stranded RNA genome, an
icosahedral nucleocapsid and a lipoprotein enve-
lope. Unlike measles and mumps viruses, this
virus has a positive-strand RNA; therefore, it
does not contain any virion polymerase. The
envelope contains haemagglutinin peplomers. It
agglutinates human, pigeon, goose and 1-day-old
chick RBCs; both replication and assembly of the
virion occur in the cytoplasm of the infected cell.

chloroform
and ether.
Laboratory Isolation
The virus is grown with difﬁculty in the cell lines.
The virus is not cytolytic but produces limited

cytopathologic effects in certain cell lines, such as
Vero and RK-13 cell lines. In the cell line, the
replication of rubella prevents the replication of
super infectious picornavirus. This phenomenon
is known as heterologous interference, which is
applied in detecting the rubella virus.

Miscellaneous Viruses
Pathogenesis of Rubella
The virus infection is acquired by inhalation of
respiratory
droplets
from
infected
persons.
Initially, the rubella virus infects the nasopharynx
of the upper respiratory tract and then spreads to
local lymph nodes. From there, the virus spreads
by the blood throughout the body to the internal
organs and skin. The occurrence of mild rash is
characteristic. During the prodromal period and
for nearly 2 weeks after the onset of rash, the
infected persons continue to secrete virus in the
respiratory droplets.
Immunity
Rubella infection is characterised by the develop-
ment of circulating antibodies produced after
the phase of viraemia, and their development
correlates with the appearance of the rash. The
circulating antibodies limit the spread of the virus
in the blood. These antibodies also cross the pla-
centa and protect the newborn from an attack of
rubella.
Natural rubella infection usually confers life-
long immunity. Reinfection may occasionally
occur after the natural disease or vaccination or
exposure to the virus. The formation of immune
complexes is suggested to contribute to the devel-
opment of rash and arthralgia associated with
rubella infection.
Clinical Syndromes
Rubella virus causes rubella and congenital
rubella syndrome.
Rubella
The incubation period varies from 14 to 21 days.
In children, Rubella is a milder and more subtle
disease than measles. A 3-day maculopapular or
macular rash, which starts on the face and
progresses downwards to involve the extremities,
is the characteristic presentation in symptomatic
cases. The rash typically lasts 3 days. Tender
lymphadenopathy that affects all the nodes but
most commonly affects sub-occipital, post-auric-
ular, anterior and posterior cervical nodes are the
hallmark of rubella.
In adults, rubella produces a more severe
disease with manifestations of arthralgia and
polyarthritis and rarely thrombocytopenia or
post-infectious encephalopathy.
Congenital Rubella
The severity of the disease depends on how early
the infection occurs. Maternal immunity to the
virus due to prior exposure or vaccination
prevents the spread of the virus to the foetus.
The foetus is at major risk until the ﬁfth month
of pregnancy. Rubella infection in very early
pregnancy causes abortion, In the ﬁrst trimester,
80% of the infants would be affected, and
cataracts, mental retardation and deafness are the
most
common
manifestations
of
congenital
rubella infection. The infection in the last trimes-
ter of the animalities is relatively mild.
Congenital Rubella Syndrome
Congenital rubella syndrome is the most severe
and important complication of rubella, which
occurs in the foetus of pregnant women without
immunity to the virus. In addition, the infants
infected in utero continue to excrete the rubella
virus for up to 1 year. These children constitute a
public health hazard because they are considered
an exposure threat to non-immune pregnant
women. The virus can be transmitted to pregnant
women from children. Common manifestations
are congenital defects, including cataracts, con-
genital heart diseases, hearing impairment and
developmental delay.
Expanded rubella syndrome is also called
“extended congenital rubella syndrome”. This
complex of symptoms may affect infants with
congenital
rubella
syndrome.
Besides
the
above-mentioned congenital defects, congenital
heart disease, corneal clouding, microcephaly,

mental
retardation,
deafness,
hepatosple-
nomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura, intrauter-
ine growth retardation, interstitial pneumonia,
myocarditis and metaphyseal bone lesions also
occur.
Rubella Virus
927
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These also include throat swabs, urine, bone mar-
row or CSF to isolate the virus by cell culture.
These include serum for serology.
Cell Culture
Viruses can be isolated in rabbit kidneys (RK-13),
rabbit cornea (SIRC) and Vero cells. The virus
produces little cytopathic effects. In Vero and
rabbit cornea cell lines, the virus is usually
identiﬁed by its ability to interfere with the echo-
virus cytopathic effect. In this method, if the
rubella virus is present in the patient’s specimen
and has grown in cell culture, no cytopathic effect
will appear when the culture is superinfected with
an echovirus, such as echo 11. Rubella virus
grown in cell lines can also be detected by
detecting antigen in cell lines using a direct ﬂuo-
rescent antibody method. Virus isolation is rarely
used because isolation of the virus is difﬁcult.
The virus can be isolated from a throat swab,
urine, bone marrow, leucocytes or CSF by cell
culture to diagnose congenital infection. Demon-
stration of rubella virus in amniotic ﬂuid collected
by amniocentesis indicates a deﬁnite congenital
rubella infection in the foetus.
Serology
The diagnosis of rubella in pregnant women by
serology is usually conﬁrmed by demonstrating
rubella antibodies in the serum. Demonstration of
speciﬁc IgM rubella antibodies in a single acute-
phase serum sample by IgM ELISA is diagnostic
of rubella and indicates recent infection. Demon-
stration of 1:8 or greater titre of IgG antibody in
serum without IgM rubella antibodies indicates
past infection, immunity and consequent protec-
tion of the foetus and vaccination. Diagnosis can
also be made by demonstrating a fourfold or
greater rise in IgG antibody titre between acute-
phase and convalescent-phase sera by using a
haemagglutination inhibition test or an ELISA.
The diagnosis of congenital rubella in an
infant by serology is made by the presence of
IgM antibodies in the serum by IgM ELISA. This
indicates a recent infection because IgM does not
cross the placenta from the mother, as does IgG.
Conﬁrmation after 1 year with serology alone is
very difﬁcult.
Treatment
There is no antiviral therapy. Pregnant women
who acquired virus are treated with acetamino-
phen to relieve their symptoms. In serious cases,
blood transfusion or steroids are administered.
Epidemiology
Humans are the natural host. The disease is prev-
alent worldwide. In countries where vaccination
is not routinely used, rubella epidemics occur
every 6–9 years. Respiratory droplets are the
source of infection. The infection is usually
acquired during childhood. Patients are most con-
tagious during the time of appearance of the rash.
The viruses are excreted in the pharynx and the
respiratory droplets from 7 days before until
7 days after the rash. The infection is usually
acquired during childhood. The infection can
also be transmitted transplacentally from mother
to foetus, resulting in congenital infection.
Prevention and Control
Preventive measures include vaccination and
administration of immunoglobulins.
Rubella Vaccines
Prevention of rubella is best carried out by
immunisation with a live attenuated vaccine.
The main objective of the rubella vaccination

programme is to prevent congenital infection by
decreasing the number of susceptible people,
especially children. Vaccination causes a signiﬁ-
cant reduction in the likelihood of exposure of
pregnant women to the virus.
928
64
Miscellaneous Viruses
Live rubella vaccine contains live, cold-
adapted RA-27/3 vaccine strain grown in human
diploid cells. The virus is usually administered as
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR vac-
cine). The vaccine is very effective and induces
long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity.
It causes few side effects, such as transient
arthralgia in some women. The vaccine also
induces the production of respiratory IgA, thereby
interrupting the spread of the virus by nasal
droplets. The use of the vaccine has resulted
in a signiﬁcantly reduced incidence of rubella
and congenital rubella syndrome worldwide.
The vaccine is usually given subcutaneously
to
children
15 months of age. It
is also
recommended for unimmunised young adult
women
if
they
are
not
pregnant
and
for
those women who will not conceive for the
next 3 months. It is contraindicated for use in
pregnant
women
and
immunocompromised
patients.
Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins can be given to pregnant
women in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy who
have been exposed to a known case of rubella,
and for whom termination of pregnancy is not an
option. Nevertheless, cases of congenital rubella
syndrome have occurred in infants born to
mothers who received immunoglobulins shortly
after exposure. No adequate treatment is available
for pregnant women exposed to rubella.
Norwalk Virus
Norwalk virus is one of the most common
causes of viral gastroenteritis in adults.
Norwalk virus is a calicivirus in the family
Caliciviridae.
The
caliciviruses
are
small,
non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses.
Although the caliciviruses show many features
similar to those of picornaviruses, they differ
from those with a large genome and distinct
spikes on the surface. Two important caliciviruses
cause infection in humans: the Norwalk virus and
the hepatitis E virus. The latter virus is described
in Chap. 60.
Morphology
Norwalk viruses are round viruses with a ragged
outline. The genome is a non-segmented, single-
stranded, positive-polarity RNA genome. The
RNA genome is present in a 27-nm naked capsid
consisting of one 60,000-Da capsid protein. The
genome does not contain any virion polymerase.
Ten
prominent
spikes
and
32
cup-shaped
depressions can be seen on the virion by
microscopy.
Other Properties
The virus replicates in the cytoplasm with the
release of viral particles on cell destruction. The
virus is presumed to replicate like that of
picornaviruses. They are stable and can survive
with freezing or at temperatures of up to 140 F.
They are also resistant to inactivation by chlori-
nation of water and drying in the environment.
The number of serotypes is not known.
Pathogenesis of Norwalk Virus Infection
Norwalk viruses are highly contagious. Infection
is acquired by ingestion of food or water
contaminated with the virus. As low as 100 viral
particles can establish infection; this is typically
limited to the mucosal cells of the intestinal tract.
Infection is characterised by damage to microvilli
in the small intestine, causing malabsorption.
The virus-mediated changes in gastric mucosa
and delayed gastric emptying cause vomiting.
It is a non-invasive virus and does not cause
invasion of the colon; therefore, leukocytes or
erythrocytes in the faeces are typically absent.
No histopathological lesions are seen in the gas-
tric mucosa.

Arenavirus
929
Norwalk virus infection confers a brief and
short
immunity.
Recurrent
infection
occurs
throughout
life
because
of the
absence
of
long-term immunity, lack of cross-strain immu-
nity and because of the diversity of Norwalk virus
strains.
Clinical Syndromes
It causes gastroenteritis in adults. The illness in
symptomatic cases typically begins after an incu-
bation period of 24–48 h. It is characterised by
sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and watery
diarrhoea.
It
is
accompanied
by
low-grade
fever, abdominal cramps and myalgia. Faecal
leukocytes are absent. Norwalk virus gastroenter-
itis is short lived and typically lasts for 24–48 h.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) is used to
detect the virus in the stool. RIA or ELISA are
also used to detect the virus and viral antigen
in the stool. Both ELISA and RIA are the
serodiagnostic tests frequently used to detect spe-
ciﬁc antibodies to the Norwalk virus in the serum.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also being
evaluated to demonstrate the viral genome in the
infected stool specimens.
Treatment
No speciﬁc treatment is available.
Epidemiology
Norwalk virus gastroenteritis is found worldwide
in adults. It is a strict human infection, and
humans are the major source of infection.
The virus is excreted in the vomitus and
faeces for several weeks after recovery; hence,
vomitus
and
faeces
are
important
sources
of infection. The infection typically occurs in
group settings, such as schools, hospitals and
nursing homes.
Prevention and Control
No vaccine is available against the virus. Strict
personal hygiene, such as handwashing, is useful
to prevent the transmission of the disease.
Viral Haemorrhagic Fever
Most viral haemorrhagic fever is caused by
enveloped RNA viruses that belong to two
families: Arenaviridae and Filoviridae. With the
recognition of the outbreak of infection caused by
the Ebola virus near the city of Kikwit, Zaire
(Africa), the condition has now received world-
wide attention.
The viruses causing viral haemorrhagic fever
exhibit many characteristics. They are usually
arthropod
borne.
Mosquitoes
are
primarily
responsible for transmitting the disease. Person-
to-person transmission may occur in many VHFs
by direct contact with infected patients, their
blood or their secretions and excretions. Rats
and mice are the usual animal reservoirs for
many of the VHFs. However, domestic livestock,
monkeys and other primates may also serve as
intermediate hosts. The manifestations of the dis-
ease vary depending upon the agent causing the
disease.
However,
circulatory
dysfunction,
increased vascular permeability and diffused
haemorrhage
are
the
serious
and
terminal
manifestations of the disease. Haemorrhage is
typically present in many organs, and effusions
are common in serous cavities. Widespread
necrosis may be present in any organ system
and varies from modest and focal to massive in
extent. Liver and lymphoid systems are usually
involved.
Arenavirus
Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a helical
nucleocapsid. They are spherical to pleomorphic
in shape, varying in size from 50 to 300 nm. The
lipid envelope contains two major glycoprotein
components, gp1 and gp2, which appear as spike-

like or club-like projections. The name arena
means sand, which refers to granules at the sur-
face
of
the
virion
that
is
non-functional
ribosomes. The arenaviruses include lymphocytic
choriomeningitis (LCM) and haemorrhagic fever
viruses, such as the Lassa, Junin and Machupo
viruses.
930
64
Miscellaneous Viruses
Morphology
Arena viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses
(50–300 nm) with a sandy appearance. The
genome is a negative-sense RNA that contains
two subgenomic segments, namely, S (small seg-
ment, measuring 1.3 million bases) and L (large
segment, measuring 2.4 million bases). The
virion consists of beaded nucleocapsid with two
single-stranded RNA circles. The strand is a
negative-sense RNA that encodes for a Z protein
and for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymer-
ase. The segment encodes for the glycoprotein
precursors and the N protein that binds to the
positive-sense RNA segments. The presence of
internal granular structures 20–25 nm in size is
the distinctive property of arenavirus. These gran-
ular structures on EM appear sand like.
Laboratory Isolation
The arenavirus, such as the Lassa virus, can be
isolated in cell culture using the E6 clone of Vero
cells or in suckling mice.
Pathogenesis of Arenaviruses Infections
Arenaviruses
primarily
infect
macrophages
and cause vascular damage. Pathogenesis of
arenaviruses infection is largely attributed to
T-cell
immunopathogenesis.
T-cell-induced
immunopathogenic
effect
contributes
to
the
exacerbation of tissue destruction.
Clinical Syndromes
Arenaviruses cause LCM, Lassa fever and South
American haemorrhagic fever.
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis
This benign infection usually begins with fever,
myalgia and headache. The illness can be
biphasic. Fever and more severe headaches may
recur 2–4 days after recovery from the ﬁrst phase.
Lassa Fever
Most infections caused by the Lassa fever virus
are mild or sub-clinical. The incubation period
varies from 7 to 18 days. The infection begins
insidiously with fever, malaise, joint pain, cough
and severe headache. Prostration, dehydration,
abdominal pain, facial or neck oedema may be
seen in severe cases.
South American Haemorrhagic Fever
Lassa, Junin and Machupo viruses cause South
American haemorrhagic fever, which is similar
in severity. This has an insidious onset with
fever, malaise, myalgia and lumbar pain. A pete-
chial and/or vesicular palatal enanthem and skin
petechiae are found in many patients. The
condition may progress within 3–4 days with
prostration and remitting fever and mucosal
bleeding. Gingival haemorrhage is the character-
istic
feature.
Most
patients
improve
after
1–2
weeks,
but
one-third
of
patients
may
show many complications. These complications
include profound mucocutaneous and mucosal
haemorrhages, delirium and convulsions.
Laboratory Diagnosis
There is a great risk for laboratory workers
handling body ﬂuids for diagnosis. Hence, it is
mandatory to process the specimen only in
facilities with biosafety level 4 for Lassa fever
and other arenaviruses and biosafety level 3 for
LCM virus.
Specimens
The specimens include blood and CSF.
Cell Culture
The virus can be isolated easily from the blood
and CSF of the individuals suffering from LCM
virus infection and the CSF in case of meningitis.

The virus is also isolated from blood or tissue in
the cases of South American haemorrhagic fever.
Viruses can be isolated using tissue culture using
the E6 clone of Vero cells or suckling mice.
Arenavirus
931
Serology
Serodiagnosis is the most important method for
diagnosing
arenavirus
infection
in
humans.
Serodiagnosis of South American haemorrhagic
fever is carried out by both ELISA and indirect
ﬂuorescent antibody tests to demonstrate IgM
antibodies in serum and also by antigen capture
ELISA is used to detect antigens in blood and
tissues. IgM ELISA is frequently used to detect
antibodies in the serum and CSF for the diagnosis
of LCM.
Treatment
Ribavirin is the antiviral drug used for the treat-
ment of Lassa fever and also for South American
haemorrhagic fever. The treatment is mostly sup-
portive of maintaining ﬂuid and electrolyte bal-
ance, which can be lifesaving.
Epidemiology
Geographical Distribution
Most arenaviruses are found in Africa and South
America, except for LCM viruses.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
Most of the arenaviruses are zoonotic, and disease
is transmitted primarily from rodents to humans.
These viruses cause infection in speciﬁc rodent
species and are endemic in the areas inhabited by
rodent species. The viruses that cause chronic
infection in these animals are excreted in saliva,
urine and faeces over a very long time. Humans
usually acquire infection from these animals
through (1) inhalation of infectious aerosols of
dried excreta, especially urine of the rodents that
have been passed in the soil; (2) ingestion of food
contaminated with rodent faeces or urine or
(3) contact of the abraded skin with rodent
blood or serum. The bite of rodents does not
usually transmit infections.
The LCM viruses are distributed in Europe,
Australia, Japan and the Americas. This infection
in this area is closely related to the presence of
infection in common mice, such as Mus musculus
and Mus domesticus. The mice are the most
important reservoir of infection for humans.
Hamsters are important reservoirs for pet owners
and laboratory workers.
Lassa fever is the disease of West Africa. The
outbreaks of Lassa fever have been reported from
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The
rodents of the genus Mastomys are the reservoirs
of infection. The infection is transmitted from
these infected mice to humans. The infection
can also be transmitted from humans to humans.
South
American
haemorrhagic
fever
is
endemic in Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela,
respectively. The rodent Calomys musculinus is
the main reservoir for Argentine haemorrhagic
fever. These rodents, commonly found in the
cornﬁeld, transmit the virus to farmers harvesting
the corn. The infection is transmitted by inhala-
tion of infectious aerosols. The infection can also
be transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food
and also by direct contact of blood or tissue from
rodents on the abraded ﬁnger.
The rodent Calomys callosus is the major res-
ervoir for Bolivian haemorrhagic fever, which
transmits the infection to humans. Transmission
of infection occurs through these rodents by
inhaling aerosols from infected organisms and
ingesting food contaminated by rodent urine.
The cane mouse is the main reservoir for
Venezuelan haemorrhagic fever.
Prevention and Control
The prevention of rodent-borne arenavirus infec-
tion depends on the rodent control measures and
avoidance of high-density rodent-infested areas.
No vaccines are available against arenaviruses.
Clinical trials of the attenuated Junin virus are in
progress.

Miscellaneous Viruses
Filoviruses
Ebola and Marburg are the two most important
causative agents of VHFs, with a mortality of
25–100%. Both viruses are found in Africa and
possibly in the Philippines. Zaire subtype of
Ebola virus has been associated with a high infec-
tion rate, especially in Zaire, Africa.
Clinical
presentation
of
Ebola
virus
is
non-speciﬁc. The incubation period varies from
2 to 14 days. Some of the common symptoms are
insidious or sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise,
generalised myalgias and arthralgias, headache,
anorexia and cough. The condition may also be
associated with a sore throat, epigastric pain,
vomiting and diarrhoea. Ebola infection during
pregnancy has been consistently fatal.
Laboratory diagnosis is essential to establish
the
viral
aetiology
of
the
infection.
EEM
(Fig. 64.2) and enzyme immunoassay are the
sensitive and speciﬁc assays for directly detecting
speciﬁc viral antigens in blood and tissues.
ELISA for virus-speciﬁc immunoglobulin M
(IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the test
of choice for diagnosis. The test, however, is
negative during the acute stages of Marburg and
Ebola virus infections. PCR on serum is very
useful for detecting infection during the acute
stages of infection during which antibodies are
not demonstrated in the serum.
The vector responsible for the Ebola virus
transmission is unknown, but infected primates
appear to be responsible. Later close contact
among humans or primates appears to spread the
infection. Aerosol transmission is suggested to
occur in monkeys.

(http://phil.cdc.gov/phil/
details.asp?pid 10815)
No speciﬁc antiviral agents are available for
the treatment of Ebola Avoidance of insect bites
from the vectors and from exposure to rodent
sources of infection is the most important mea-
sure for preventing the condition. Barrier nursing
and needle sterilisation in African hospitals are
important to eliminate epidemics of Ebola and
Marburg diseases.
Reoviridae
The family Reoviridae is divided into nine
genera, of which only four genera cause human
diseases. These genera are Rotavirus, Orbivirus,
Coltivirus and Orthoreovirus. Other genera infect
only plants, insects and ﬁsh. The Reoviridae
viruses are non-enveloped viruses with double-
layered protein capsids. The inner capsid layer
shows well-deﬁned subunits, whereas the outer
layer of some viruses (e.g. rotaviruses and
orbiviruses) lacks these well-deﬁned structures.
The genome consists of a 10- to 12-segmented
double-stranded RNA with a total genome size of
16–27 kbp. The virus core contains many
enzymes essential for the transcription and cap-
ping of viral RNA. These viruses are unusually
resistant to heat, have a wide pH (3.0–9.0), and
to lipid solvents but are sensitive to 95%
ethanol, phenol and chlorine. Reoviridae viruses

associated with human diseases are listed in
Table 64.5.

Rotavirus
Rotavirus is the most common agent of gastroen-
teritis in children aged 6 months to 2 years. The
virus was identiﬁed by Bishop and his associates
in the diarrhoeic stool of the infants.
Morphology
Rotavirus has a distinctive morphological appear-
ance by the negative stain in EM. The virus
measures 70 nm in diameter and possesses a
three-layer icosahedral capsid without an enve-
lope (Fig. 64.3). The sharply deﬁned circular
outline of the outer capsid gives the appearance
of the rim of a wheel placed on short pokes
radiating from a wide arm. This appearance
gives the virus the name “rota” (Latin word
which means “wheel”).
Virus Genome
The genome consists of a segmented double-
stranded RNA genome. The outer shell comprises
a major glycoprotein with a molecular weight of
34,000 Da. This protein is known as a viral pro-
tein (VP7). It also consists of a minor trypsin-
sensitive protein with a molecular weight of
84,000 Da. This protein is now designated
as VP4, which was earlier called VP3. The
minor shell or core protein of the virus core
consists of four proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and
VP6.
The
virus
also
consists
of
six
non-structural proteins (NS53, NS34, NS35,
NS28, NS26 and NS12).
Virus Replication
Rotaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the host
cell. Infection of the cell begins by attachment to
the cell surface at the site of the beta-adrenergic
receptor. After entry into the cell, the virion
uncoats
and
in
the
cytoplasm,
the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesises
mRNA from each of the 10–11 segments.
Virus Antigens
Human rotaviruses have been classiﬁed into a
total of 11 G serotypes primarily based on the
VP7
(glycoprotein
G)
and
VP4
(protease-
sensitive protein P) proteins. Serotypes G1, G2,
G3 or G4 have been identiﬁed with most
infections and are designated as serotypes 1, 2,
3 or 4, respectively. There are six different HRP-P
types. P type 1 is usually associated with G type
1, 3 or 4, whereas P type 1b is usually associated
with a type 2.
Rotaviruses are classiﬁed into seven groups
(from A to G) based on the antigenicity of VP6
and the electrophoretic mobility of the genomic
segments. Human disease is caused mostly by
group A and occasionally by group B and C
rotaviruses.

934
64
Miscellaneous Viruses
Fig. 64.3 Structure of
rotavirus
Other Properties
Rotaviruses
are
relatively
stable
at
low
temperatures. They are also stable at pH extremes
(3.5–10) and repeated freezing and thawing.
Treatment with proteolytic enzymes, such as tryp-
sin enhances the virus’s infectivity.
Laboratory Isolation
Tissue Culture
Human rotaviruses are difﬁcult to grow. They do
not grow readily in cell cultures. Rotavirus
growth is facilitated if the viruses are pre-treated
with proteolytic enzyme trypsin and if low levels
of trypsins are included in the tissue culture
medium. This causes cleavage of the outer capsid
protein of the virus and thereby facilitates
uncoating.
Pathogenesis of Rotavirus Diarrhoea
Rotavirus is acquired by faeco–oral transmission
in the infected host. It survives the acidic envi-
ronment in the stomach and initiates infection in
the mucosal cells of the small intestine. It does not
cause infection in the mucosa of the stomach and
large intestine. After absorption, the viruses rep-
licate in the cytoplasm of the enterocytes and
damage their transport mechanism.

Rotavirus
935
Non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of the rotavi-
rus may act as a viral enterotoxin, which causes
the secretion of ﬂuids by stimulating a signal
transduction pathway. The toxin induces an inﬂux
of calcium ions into enterocytes and release neu-
ronal activators, and alters sodium and glucose
absorption.
The
resulting
diarrhoea
is
due
to impaired sodium and glucose absorption, as
damaged cells on the villi are replaced by
non-absorbing immature crypt cells.
After replicating in the cell, the rotavirus
causes damage to the cell. The damaged cells
are released into the lumen of the intestine, releas-
ing large quantities of viruses in the diarrhoeic
stool. It takes around 3–8 weeks for restoring the
normal function of the cell. Hence, the rotavirus
produces watery diarrhoea similar to that seen in
cholera.
Immunity
Rotavirus infection is characterised by the pres-
ence of a high quantity of immunoglobulin A
(IgA) in the intestinal secretions. The IgA plays
an important role in conferring gut immunity
against rotavirus. It protects newborns up to the
age of 6 months. The serum antibodies usually
reduce the severity of the disease but do not
necessarily prevent reinfection. Even a small
quantity of a virus may cause infection and diar-
rhoea in the absence of speciﬁc antibodies in the
serum.
Clinical Syndromes
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhoea in infants
and young children.
Diarrhoea
The incubation period is short, being less than
48 h. The condition manifests commonly as
fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and occasionally dehy-
dration. Vomiting is usually of short duration and
can occur before or after the onset of diarrhoea.
The diarrhoeic stool may be watery, green or
yellow but does not contain mucus. Rotavirus
diarrhoea is a self-limiting disease, and patients
recover completely within 5–10 days without any
complications on sequelae. Also, rotavirus has
been reported as an agent of traveller’s diarrhoea
in adults.
The virus has also been reported to cause gas-
troenteritis in adults. There have been increasing
reports of outbreaks of rotaviral diarrhoea in
adults and older children from many parts of
China, and this rotavirus is named adult diar-
rhoea rotavirus (ADRV).
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Diarrhoeic stool is the specimen of choice to
demonstrate rotavirus and viral antigens.
Microscopy
Rotavirus can be demonstrated in stool by direct
EM and IEM. Direct EM is a rapid method for
detecting rotavirus in the faecal specimen. EM
detects typical 70-nm cart-wheel-shaped viruses
in the stool. The sensitivity of this method, how-
ever, is low. On-grid IEM is a three times more
sensitive and reliable method than the conven-
tional EM for demonstrating rotaviruses in the
stool.
Antigen Detection
Enzyme immunoassays, such as Rotazyme and
latex agglutination test, are useful tools to detect
rotavirus antigen directly in the stool to diagnose
diarrhoeal illness. This is a method used for rou-
tine diagnosis of rotavirus diarrhoea.
Cell Culture
Rotaviruses are difﬁcult to grow in cell culture,
hence are not routinely used to diagnose rotavirus
diarrhoea.
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral therapy is available for rota-
virus infection. The treatment of the condition is
mostly supportive. It consists of restoring the
ﬂuid loss in dehydrated patients. Oral rehydration
ﬂuid using glucose and electrolyte solution is

currently preferred over intravenous ﬂuids to
restore hydration. Intravenous ﬂuids are used
only in severely dehydrated children.

Miscellaneous Viruses
Epidemiology
Rotavirus is found worldwide. The viruses are
excreted in the diarrhoeic stool of the children
2–5 days after the start of diarrhoea. Infected
children are the common source and reservoir of
infection. The virus is transmitted from person to
person by the faecal–oral route. The virus is resis-
tant to environmental conditions hence survives
well on fomites, as well as on hands. The rotavi-
rus diarrhoeal disease shows a seasonal variation,
the disease being more common in autumn,
spring and winter. A rotavirus called ADRV has
been isolated from the outbreaks of diarrhoea in
children and adults in China.
Prevention and Control
Few vaccines have been evaluated to protect chil-
dren from rotavirus diarrhoea. Improved personal
hygiene, including handwashing and isolation of
known cases of rotavirus, are the best modes of
control of the rotavirus diarrhoea.
Vaccines
A rhesus–human reassortant rotavirus tetravalent
vaccine (RRV-TV; Rota shield) is a recent vac-
cine being used since 1998.
The vaccine consists of a polyvalent prepara-
tion consisting of the VP7 protein of each of the
four clinically important serotypes with the atten-
uation phenotype of the rhesus rotavirus. This has
successfully prevented severe rotavirus diarrhoea
in two different studies conducted in Finland with
protection
rates
of
80–91%.
In
developing
countries, such as Peru and Brazil, the efﬁcacy
of this vaccine has been less impressive, varying
between 20% and 30% protection rates in chil-
dren. Several rotavirus vaccine trials have been
conducted across the country. The ROTAVAC
rotavirus vaccine study, a multi-centre Phase
3 efﬁcacy and safety clinical trial, was India’s
ﬁrst and largest efﬁcacy clinical trial on vaccines.
It was successfully completed in 2013. Presently
Rotavac is licenced for use in India. Another trial
initiated in 2014 in India as a Phase 3 trial was the
bovine-human reassortant pentavalent rotavirus
vaccine (BRV-PV) targeting the globally most
common strains, namely Rotasiil. Both the
vaccines were safe, well tolerated and provided
signiﬁcant
efﬁcacy
against
severe
rotavirus
gastroenteritis.
Orbiviruses
Orbiviruses are primarily animal pathogens that
cause disease mainly in animals. They are named
for their ring-shaped (Latin word orbit means
“ring”) structure. These viruses are differentiated
from the orthoreovirus by their protein structure
and their transmission by arthropod vectors. The
genus Orbivirus consists of 19 species and at least
130 subspecies.
The orbiviruses are non-enveloped viruses
with two-layered capsids. The genome consists
of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA. The
virion measures 70–80 nm in diameter. The
virus multiplies inside arthropod vectors and
vertebrates; hence, they come under arboviruses.
Only a few orbiviruses are linked to disease in
humans. Kemerovo virus has been implicated in
neurological infections in Russia and Central
Europe. Lebombo virus, isolated in Africa,
has been implicated with clinical disease in
humans. Orbiviruses cause severe ﬂu-like dis-
ease, encephalitis and polyradiculitis in humans.
Fever, headache and myalgia are the common
manifestations.
Coltiviruses
Coltiviruses resemble the orbiviruses in their
morphology and in having two capsids. The
genome consists of a 12-segmented double-
stranded RNA. The coltiviruses associated with
the human disease include Colorado tick fever,
Salmon River virus, Banna virus, Beijing virus,
Gansu virus and Eyach virus.

Coronaviruses
937
Orthoreoviruses
Orthoreoviruses are non-enveloped viruses, mea-
suring 80 nm in diameter. It is composed of an
inner protein shell, that is, core and an outer
protein shell known as an outer capsid. The
inner core comprises three major lipids, 71, 72
and cr2 and many minor proteins. The core
consists
of
a
10-segmented
double-stranded
RNA. The reoviruses have three serotypes,
namely, type 1, 2 and 3, based on neutralisation
and haemagglutination inhibition test. All these
serotypes share a common complement ﬁxation
antigen.
Coronaviruses
Coronaviruses were so named for the crown-like
appearance of their virions on EM. These viruses
are the second most important cause of the com-
mon cold, rhinoviruses being the ﬁrst cause. The
coronaviruses have also been reported to cause
gastroenteritis in children and adults. SARS-CoV
was a newly described coronavirus in 2002. The
virus causes atypical pneumonia called SARS, a
serious
and
potentially
life-threatening
viral
infection of humans.
SARS-CoV
causing
atypical
pneumonia
called severe acute respiratory syndrome or
SARS was ﬁrst reported in 2002 and 2003 out-
break. This outbreak caused by the virus is
believed to have originated in Guangdong prov-
ince, South China. It predominantly affected
mainly
China,
Hong
Kong,
Singapore
and
Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to
neighbouring countries in Asia, Canada and the
United States.

Morphology
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses measuring
80–160 nm in size on EM. The glycoproteins
appear as club-shaped projections (20 nm long
and 5–11 nm wide) on the surface of the enve-
lope. The genome in association with N protein
forms a helical nucleocapsid. The virus contains
the glycoproteins E1 and E2 and a core nucleo-
protein N. Some strains also contain a glycopro-
tein E3, which is haemagglutinin neuraminidase.
E1 glycoprotein is a transmembrane matrix pro-
tein; E2 glycoprotein mediates viral attachment
and membrane fusion (Fig. 64.4).
Virus Genome
SARS-CoV is a single-stranded, non-segmented,
plus-sense RNA virus. It measures approximately
30 kb in length. The genomic sequence of SARS-
CoV is different from other coronavirus strains.
These strains of SARS-CoV are quite stable,
unlike other coronaviruses in which mutations
in the RNA sequence during virus replication
are
common. Such mutations
contribute to
the appearance of a new virus to be either
more or less virulent. In contrast, the genome
sequence of different isolates of SARS-CoV is
very similar.

938
64
Miscellaneous Viruses
Virus Replication
The attachment of the virus to the cell is mediated
by haemagglutinin. The virus enters the cell and
uncoats. The replication of the virus occurs in the
cytoplasm. Synthesis of protein occurs in two
stages similar to that of togaviruses. The assem-
bly of viruses occurs and derives its envelope
from the endoplasmic reticulum but not from the
plasma membrane (Fig. 64.5).
Other Properties
Coronaviruses have two serotypes, namely, 229E
and OC43. SARS virus is relatively stable. They
are sensitive to acid, ether and bile. They are
difﬁcult to grow in routine cell cultures.

Pathogenesis of Coronavirus Infections
The coronavirus infection is acquired by inhaling
infectious droplets during coughing or sneezing
from a SARS patient. These viruses typically
cause infections in the upper respiratory tract
because the optimal temperature for replication
of viruses is 37–38 C. SARS-CoV causes infec-
tion in the respiratory tract by binding to
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on
the surface of the respiratory epithelium. This
causes alteration in ﬂuid balance and leads to
the development of oedema in the alveolar
space. Diffused oedema resulting in hypoxia is
characteristic of pneumonia caused by SARS-
CoV. Infections caused by coronaviruses produce
a short and brief immunity, but reinfection can
occur.

Coronaviruses
939
Clinical Syndromes
Coronaviruses cause SARS, common cold and
gastroenteritis.
SARS
SARS is a potentially life-threatening infection
associated with the onset of ﬂu-like syndrome,
which may progress to pneumonia, respiratory
failure and in some cases death. The incubation
period varies from 2 to 7 days, although it may be
as long as 2 weeks.
Flu-like prodrome is the ﬁrst stage of the dis-
ease, which is characterised by fever (>30 C),
fatigue, chills, malaise, anorexia and myalgia.
The second stage represents the lower respiratory
tract illness that begins three or more days
after
incubation.
Hypoxia,
cough,
dyspnoea
and breathing difﬁculties are common ﬁndings.
The
cough
typically
tends
to
be
dry
and
non-productive and may range from mild to
severe. Fever is typically higher than 30 C.
Chest
X-ray
shows
interstitial
ground-glass
inﬁltrates that do not show cavitation. The condi-
tion is associated with lymphadenopathy and
thrombocytopenia.
Morbidity and mortality due to SARS is more
in the elderly population and also seen in more
individuals with co-existing chronic illness and
immunosuppression. The mortality rate of SARS
is higher than inﬂuenza and other respiratory tract
illnesses. The overall mortality is more than 10%
and is more than 50% in elderly individuals above
65 years.
Common Cold
The coronaviruses (229E and OC43) cause more
commonly upper respiratory tract and less com-
monly lower respiratory tract illnesses in humans.
The common cold caused by coronaviruses has an
incubation period of 3 days. The condition is
characterised by rhinorrhea, sore throat and
low-grade fever. The condition typically lasts
for several days.
Gastroenteritis
The coronaviruses have also been reported to
cause gastroenteritis in children and adults. The
symptoms are mild, and the condition is self-
limiting.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnostic tests are most essential to
conﬁrm the diagnosis of SARS.
Specimens
Specimens include respiratory secretions for iso-
lation of the virus and serum for testing of
antibodies.
Cell Culture
SARS-CoV can be isolated in viral cultures. Iso-
lation of virus is attempted only in class III
laboratories.
Serology
Serodiagnosis of SARS depends on detecting
speciﬁc antibodies to SARS-CoV in serum
obtained during acute illness or 28 days or more
after the onset of disease. IFA and ELISAs are the
most frequently used tests for detecting speciﬁc
antibodies in patients with SARS. Demonstration
of a fourfold rise of antibody titre between acute
and convalescent (>28 days after symptom onset)
serum samples is suggestive of SARS.
Molecular Detection
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) is employed to detect SARS-CoV
RNA in serum, stool and nasal secretions. The
test is positive in some patients within the ﬁrst
10 days of fever.
Treatment
No speciﬁc antiviral treatment is available against
SARS. Treatment is mostly symptomatic as
given for serious community-acquired pneumo-
nia. Persons suspected of SARS should be
hospitalised immediately and kept in isolation
under close observation. Supportive treatment
may include assisted breathing using a ventilator,
antibiotics to treat secondary infections due to

bacteria and steroids to reduce lung inﬂammation.
None of these is full proved modalities. The
antiviral medicine ribavirin is known to be inef-
fective at treating SARS.

Miscellaneous Viruses
Epidemiology
SARS
is
restricted
in
its
geographical
distribution.
Geographical Distribution
The SARS outbreak in 2002–03 predominantly
affected mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taiwan and Canada. The SARS strain is believed
to have originated in Guangdong province in
southern China. It was ﬁrst reported in February
2003. Over the next few months, the illness
spread to more than two dozen countries in
North America, South America, Europe and
Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003
was contained. The disease was epidemiologi-
cally linked to the National Institute of Virology
in Beijing, where the outbreak is thought to
have originated. A total of 8098 cases, 774 deaths
and
7324
recoveries
from
SARS
were
documented
between
November
2002
and
21 April 2004.
Reservoir, Source and Transmission
of Infection
SARS is believed to be primarily transmitted by
close person-to-person contact. Most cases of
SARS were seen in individuals who lived with
or cared for a patient with SARS or who had
exposure to contaminated secretions from a
SARS patient. The infection would possibly
have
been
acquired
by
inhaling
infectious
droplets during coughing or sneezing from a
SARS patient. Moreover, another possible mode
of transmission is direct contact of the eyes, nose
or mouth of susceptible individuals with infec-
tious secretions of SARS patients.
It is suggested that SARS-CoV may have
originated in chickens, ducks or small mammals.
In
these
animals,
the
virus
would
have
mutated, subsequently being transmitted, causing
human infection. The transmission to humans is
facilitated possibly by the proximity in which
humans and livestock live in rural southern
China. The avian ﬂu epidemic in Hong Kong in
1977, which originated in poultry and spread to
humans (resulting in the slaughter of millions of
chickens), is a classic example of this type of
zoonotic transmission.
It is also postulated that the SARS-CoV
initially originated in civet cats, which were sold
in a Guangdong marketplace in rural southern
China as a food delicacy. Close contact with
their saliva or faeces or with the animals them-
selves possibly has transmitted a mutated SARS-
CoV to humans.
Prevention and Control
Isolation of patients and strict barrier nursing is
crucial to prevent transmission of SARS to others.
Moreover, airport screening for potentially sick
and/or febrile passengers is being carried out in
SARS-affected regions in Asia by using infrared
scanners.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS-CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a
viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coro-
navirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coro-
navirus, or MERSCoV). It was ﬁrst identiﬁed in
Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic
virus and is transmitted between animals and
people. The origins of the virus are not fully
understood but are believed to have originated
in bats and transmitted to camels sometime in
the distant past. Humans are infected through
direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary
camels. MERS-CoV has been identiﬁed in sev-
eral countries in the Middle East, Africa and
South Asia. Since 2012, 27 countries have
reported cases of MERS. Dromedary camels are
the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. The
virus does not pass easily from person to person
unless there is close contact, such as providing
unprotected care to an infected patient.

COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2
941
The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection
varies from asymptomatic or mild respiratory
symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease
and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV
disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath
with or without pneumonia or gastrointestinal
symptoms.
Approximately
35%
of
patients
with MERS have died. No vaccine or speciﬁc
treatment is currently available. Treatment is
mainly supportive. The consumption of raw
or
undercooked
animal
products,
including
milk and meat of camel, carries a high risk of
infection. Preventive measures include general
hygiene after visiting animal product selling
markets, regular hand washing before and after
touching animals and avoiding contact with sick
animals.
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2
Since December 2019, the world has faced a
major pandemic with another coronavirus. Severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the outbreak
of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was
ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan, China, following reports
of serious pneumonia. The new SARS-CoV-2 is
most closely related to a group of SARS-CoVs
found in humans, bats, pangolins and civets. It is
very contagious and has quickly spread around
the world. An estimated total number of deaths
worldwide due to COVID-19 have exceeded
5 million.
Most people infected with the virus experience
mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
without requiring special treatment. However,
serious illnesses requiring medical interventions,
like assisted breathing oxygen support, have also
been noted. Aged people and those with underly-
ing comorbidities, like cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease or cancer
are more likely to develop serious illnesses.
Some people, including those with minor or no
symptoms,
may
suffer
from
post-COVID
conditions or “long COVID”.
Transmission
The virus is thought to be of natural animal origin.
Evidence suggests that the virus is a descendant
of a coronavirus that infects wild bats and spreads
to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.
The virus can spread from an infected person’s
mouth or nostrils via small liquid particles when
they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These
particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
smaller aerosols. Besides, surfaces and fomites
have a minimal role in the transmission.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Several testing methods have been developed to
diagnose COVID-19. The standard diagnostic
method is by detection of the virus nucleic acid
by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated
ampliﬁcation (TMA) or by reverse transcription
loop-mediated
isothermal
ampliﬁcation
(RT-LAMP)
from
a
nasopharyngeal
swab.
Besides, serological testing identifying one of
the outer proteins of the viral shell or envelope,
called antigen testing, has also been used.
Antibody detection has also been used to test
for the immune response against COVID-19
vaccines and rarely for diagnosis. Chest CT
scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in
individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infec-
tion but are not recommended for routine
screening.
Prevention and Control
Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved
and used in various countries in the form of mass
vaccination campaigns. Among various vaccines,
the two major vaccines used in India are
COVISHIELD and COVAXIN. COVISHIELD
is
a
recombinant,
replication-deﬁcient
chimpanzee
adenovirus
vector
encoding the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein. Following

administration, the genetic material of the part of
coronavirus is expressed, which stimulates an
immune response. It comprises 2 doses. The
Indian government recommended an interval of
12–16 weeks between the ﬁrst and second dose.
COVAXIN is India’s indigenous COVID-19
vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collabo-
ration with the Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology
(NIV). The vaccine is developed using Whole-
Virion Inactivated Vero Cell-derived platform
technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate
and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause
pathological effects. They contain dead viruses,
incapable of infecting people but still able to
instruct the immune system to mount a defensive
reaction against an infection. It is a 2-dose vacci-
nation regimen given 28 days apart.
942
64
Miscellaneous Viruses
General preventive measures include physical
or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of
indoor spaces, respiratory and cough etiquettes,
hand washing, etc. The use of face masks or
coverings has been recommended in public
settings to minimise the risk of transmission.
Management
involves
the
treatment
of
symptoms, supportive care, isolation, etc.
Variants
It is normal for viruses to change and evolve as
they spread between people over time. When
these changes become signiﬁcantly different
from the original virus, they are known as
“variants”, which are identiﬁed by mapping the
genetic material of viruses and comparing them
for differences. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the
virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading
globally, variants have emerged. A variant is
considered a variant of interest if it has mutations
that are suspected or known to cause signiﬁcant
changes, and the mutant is circulating widely. On
the contrary, a variant of interest becomes a vari-
ant of concern if it is known to spread more
easily, cause more severe disease, escape the
body’s immune response, change the clinical pre-
sentation or decrease the effectiveness of known
surveillance, testing and management tools. One
such variant is the Omicron.
Omicron Variant
The Omicron variant, variant B.1.1.529, was ﬁrst
reported to WHO on 24 November 2021 and was
classiﬁed as a variant of concern by WHO
on 26 November 2021. The classiﬁcation was
based on information from South Africa that the
variant has a large number of mutations and has
caused a signiﬁcant change in COVID-19 epide-
miology. This variant has many mutations, with
preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk
of reinfection with this variant. This variant has
been detected faster than previous surges in infec-
tion, suggesting that this variant may have a
growth advantage. The pandemic continues pres-
ently, with this variant being reported in more
than 77 countries worldwide.
ZIKA Virus
ZIKA virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family,
and it is transmitted through Aedes mosquitoes,
rarely from mother to baby and through infected
blood or by sexual means. Out of ﬁve ZIKV-
infected people, one may suffer from fever, rash,
joint pain or conjunctivitis. Additionally, the
patient may suffer from muscle pain and head-
ache. The incubation time of this virus is
unknown. Symptoms may persist for several
days to a week, and deaths are rarely reported.
Recent ﬁndings suggest that the ZIKA virus is
associated with the development of microcephaly
in newborns due to transmission of the virus from
mother to baby during pregnancy. However, the
actual causal role of this virus is yet to be proven,
but CDC recommends special precautions for
pregnant women who are planning a visit to
endemic areas.
ZIKA virus outbreaks have been documented
in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁc islands.
In 2015 the Pan American Health Organization
conﬁrmed the ﬁrst ZIKV infection in Brazil, and
at present many other countries also have reported
ZIKV
outbreaks
(Fig.
64.6).
Currently,
no
vaccines are available to prevent ZIKV disease.
Prevention can be done by avoiding day-biting
mosquitoes.

Mycology

Introduction to Mycology
65
The term mycology is used for the study of fungi.
The term fungi originated from the Greek word
‘mykos’ which pertains to mushroom. Fungi
belong to Eukaryotes and based on nutrition
requirement, is classiﬁed as chemoheterotorphs.
They exist both in unicellular and/or multicellular
forms. The salient differentiating features of fungi
and bacteria are provided in Table 65.1. The
characteristics features of fungi are the presence
of chitin and ergosterol in their cell wall.
Cell
wall:
Chitin
is
one
of
the
major
constituents of the fungal cell wall. It is a poly-
saccharide with long chains of N-acetylglu-
cosamine. It provides rigidity to the fungal cell
wall. The amount of chitin and another major
constitute glucan varies amongst different fungal
species. The fungal cell wall also contains
mannoproteins,
chitin
synthase
and
glucan
synthase enzymes. Of these, beta-glucan is the
most important, because it is the target of antifun-
gal drugs, echinocandins and is used as a bio-
marker for the diagnosis of invasive fungal
diseases.
Cell membrane: The cell membrane of fungi
is rich in lipids such as glycerophospholipids,
sphingolipids and sterols. Fungal sterols are typi-
cally present in the form of ergosterol, which is in
contrast with the human cell membrane which is
made up of cholesterol. The antifungals such as
polyenes
(amphotericin
B),
triazoles
(itraconazole, voriconazole and ﬂuconazole) and
allylamines (terbinaﬁne) all target the cell mem-
brane either killing or inhibiting the fungi. These
antifungals selectively target the ergosterol pres-
ent in the fungi and not the cholesterol that is
present in humans.

Classification of Fungi
The fungi can be classiﬁed as follows:
Taxonomical Classification
Fungi belong to monophyletic clade classiﬁed as
the kingdom ‘Fungi’. Fungi causing human and
animal infections belong to four phyla such as
Ascomycota,
Basidiomycota,
Glomeromycota
and
Microsporidia
and
subphylum
Mucormycotina
and
Entomophthoromycotina.
Earlier some fungal species were arbitrarily clas-
siﬁed as Deuteromycetes or Fungi Imperfecti.
Mucormycotina
Lower fungi have non-septate hyphae and form
endogenous
asexual
spores
known
as
sporangiospores which are inside a swollen-sac-
like structure called sporangia. Sexual spores
termed as zygospores are also produced. In con-
trast, the higher fungi have well-developed sep-
tum
in
the
hyphae
and
produce
conidia
exogenously. Human infection (mucormycosis)
is caused by fungi in the order Mucorales such
as Rhizopus, Mucor, Apophysomyces, Absida,
Cunninghamella, etc.

Ascospores or sexual spores are formed within
the ascus or sac. Both ﬁlamentous fungi and
yeasts are known to produce ascospores.
Basidiomycetes
Basidiospores or sexual spores are formed on a
base or basidium.
Fungi Imperfecti
It
is
also
known
as
deuteromycetes
or
hyphomycetes, and sexual phases of this group
of fungi have not been identiﬁed. Hyphomycetes
are further classiﬁed as phaeohyphomycetes in
which the hyphae appear black due to pigment
called melanin and hyalohyphomycetes in which
the hyphae are colourless or hyaline. Many medi-
cally important fungus group belongs to this
family.
Morphological Classification
Based on the microscopic and macroscopic mor-
phology, fungi are classiﬁed under three groups
as described below.
Yeast
Yeasts are unicellular cells that reproduce by
budding. The shape and size vary among the
different species. For example, Cryptococcus
neoformans appears round, whereas Candida
albicans are oval. Some yeasts produce elongated
cells called pseudohyphae (earlier referred as
yeast-like fungi (e.g. C. albicans, Candida
tropicalis, etc.) and other do not produce pseudo
hypha
(earlier
referred
as
true
yeasts)
e.g. Cryptococcus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
On culture medium, such as Sabouraud dextrose
agar
(SDA),
they
produce
creamy
mucoid
colonies. Example: C. neoformans.
Moulds
Moulds grow as long ﬁlaments called hyphae.
They usually measure 2–10 μm in width. Some
hyphae form transverse walls and hence they are
called septate hyphae, whereas others do not pro-
duce walls, hence are called non-septate hyphae.
Non-septate hyphae are multinucleated. The
hyphae on their continuous growth form a mat
known as mycelium. The part of the mycelium
that projects above the surface in the culture
medium is called aerial mycelium. Examples
include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, etc.
Dimorphic Fungi
Many of medically important fungi are dimor-
phic. They exist as hyphal/mycelial forms at
lower temperatures, for example 22–25 C i
the environmental niche such as air and soil.
They occur as yeasts or other structures in
human tissue and in the culture at 37
C

(Fig.
65.1).
Examples
include
Coccidioides
immitis,
Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis,
Histoplasma
capsulatum,
Blastomyces
dermatitidis,
Talaromyces
marneffei
and
Sporothrix schenckii species complex.

Pathogenic Classification
Fungi can be classiﬁed into the following types
based on their pathogenicity.
Primarily Pathogenic
Fungi like thermally dimorphic fungi can cause
infections in apparently healthy individuals.
Opportunistic Pathogens
This fungus group can cause infections in patients
who already have defective immune mechanism.
Individuals
infected
with
AIDS,
taking
immunosuppressive and suffering from diabetes
mellitus are some of the examples.
Reproduction of Fungi
Fungi have the ability to reproduce both sexually
and asexually. The end product of sexual forms is
called spores and asexually products are called
conidia.
Zygospores,
ascospores
and
basidiospores are produced by Mucoromycotina,
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively.
Ascospores
are
formed
within
the
sac-like
structures called ascus which may be present
naked or many times in closed structures such as
cleistothecia, apothecia, etc. The basidiospores
are produced on the surface of basidium through
the four
sterigmata present
on its surface.
Zygospores are generally single large spores and
are ornamented with thick walls. Sexual repro-
duction occurs mainly by the process of meiosis
and can later be followed by mitosis. Fungi that
do not produce sexual spores are earlier classiﬁed
as Fungi imperfecti. The end product of the Asex-
ual reproduction is called conidia which are
produced
by
the
process
of
mitosis.
Conidiogenesis, the process of conidia produc-
tion, conidial shape, colour and arrangement are
used for morphological identiﬁcation of the fungi.
Some of the asexual spores or conidia are
described below.
1. Arthrospores/arthroconidia are formed by
formation of the septa within the existing
hyphae resulting in fragmentation into multi-
ple cells. They are rectangular in shape and
have a thick cell wall. The arthrocondia is the
infective form of C. immitis.
2. Chlamydospores/chlamydocondia
are
the
thick-walled conidia, round to oval that are
produced asexually in between (intercalary)
or at the tip of the hyphae or pseudohyphae
(terminal). The terminal chlamydospores help
in
the
differentiating
C.
albicans
and
C. dubliniensis from other Candida species.
3. Blastospores/blastocondida are formed by
the process called budding or blasting out
from the yeast cells. After budding, the cells
may get elongated and remain attached to the

950
65
Introduction to Mycology
parent cell giving the appearance of hyphae or
ﬁlaments called pseudohyphae.
4. Sporangiospores are the only asexually prod-
uct that is called spores. They are formed
endogenously with in sporangia, the sac-like
structure at the tip of the fertile hyphae called
sporangiophores (e.g. Mucor and Rhizopus).
5. Conidia are asexual product produced exter-
nally on the sides or tips of specialised hyphae
called
conidiophores
or
from
the
conidiogenous cell of conidiophores. They
are further classiﬁed as microconidia (single
cell and small) and macroconidia (large and
multicellular due to internal septation).
Pathogenesis of Fungal Infection
Most fungi are strict aerobes or facultative
anaerobes, and they do not grow in strict an
aerobic state. Majority of the fungi are associated
with environmental substrates which are rich in
organic matter. Being heterotrophic it is essential
for them to acquire nutrition from external source.
They have ubiquitous distribution and are found
more in the air, soil and decaying matter, etc.
Fungi can be seen as colonisers as well as can
cause serious diseases. Fungi also can cause aller-
gic disease and toxins released from them may
lead to mycotoxicosis.
Colonisation and Disease
Fungi are seen as a coloniser in the gastrointesti-
nal tract, upper respiratory tract, skin and other
mucosal surfaces such as the vagina. Infection by
colonised fungi is restricted due to the presence of
innate immunity of the epithelial and other cells.
Any break in the mucosal or epithelial barrier
along with reduced innate immune response will
allow the fungi to invade and cause disease. In
addition to the innate immune response high fatty
acid content, pH, frequent epithelial shredding
and bacterial ﬂora help in providing resistance to
fungal infections. For example, mucosal surfaces
trap the fungal spores that are inhaled restricting
them to reach the lower respiratory tract.
Cell-mediated immunity plays a key role in
protection against fungal infections. When the
cell-mediated immunity is absent or reduced
opportunistic fungi that are either colonised or
silent invades the tissue and disseminate to
cause serious opportunistic fungal infections.
Although humoral immune responses in the
form of IgG and IgM antibody are noted during
fungal infections, its role in protection against
fungal infections is limited.
Infections by fungi that can invade and cause
systemic
infection
in
immunocompetent
individuals are generally referred to as systemic
fungal infections. Common systemic infections
include those caused by endemic fungi such as
Histoplasma,
Blastomyecs,
Coccidioides
and
Paracoccidioides. Whereas, opportunistic fungal
infections are referred as infections caused by
Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Mucorales,
Fusarium etc. especially, in an immunocompro-
mised individuals.
Allergic Fungal Diseases
As the fungi are ubiquitously abundant in the
environment including air, everyday humans
inhale plenty of fungal conidia, spores or fungal
fragments present in the air. Aspergillus is the
most common fungi causing allergic fungal dis-
ease. Penicillium, Curvularia, Alternaria and
Bipolaris are other species involved. Allergic
fungal disease affects either the upper airway in
the form of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)
or the lower airways in the form of allergic
bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPA) and bron-
chial asthma. Patients with AFRS and ABPA are
atopic with type I IgE hypersensitivity to the
fungal antigen along with increased levels of
total IgE and Aspergillus-speciﬁc IgE.
AFRS patients usually present with nasal
blockage. Histologically, the surgical specimen
obtained from the paranasal sinus of those
patients shows a characteristic feature called
‘allergic mucin’ which is composed of amor-
phous mucous and necrotic eosinophils. Aspergil-
lus spp. especially Aspergillus ﬂavus is the most
commonest cause of AFRS.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is
also a hypersensitive disease and patients presents
with wheeze and productive cough associated
with thick brown sputum. Generally, Aspergillus

conidia that are inhaled will be cleared by the
mucociliary action, but in patients with bronchial
asthma and cystic ﬁbrosis due to lack of ciliary
clearance, the conidia will germinate and cause
epithelial damage and initiate T-helper cell type-
2 inﬂammatory responses. Aspergillus fumigatus
is the most common causative agent of ABPA
and recent reports suggest that A. ﬂavus is also
an important agent. Diagnosis can be made a
clinical feature such as worsening of symptoms
in cystic ﬁbrosis and bronchial asthma patients,
serum eosinophilia increase in total and Aspergil-
lus speciﬁc and inﬁltrates on the chest radiogra-
phy. High-attenuation mucus on CT scan is the
pathognomic feature of ABPA. Allergic mucin
noted in AFRS is also noted with ABPA.

Mycotoxicosis
Mycotoxicosis is the disease caused by ingestion
or inhalation of the excessive toxins produced
especially by the plant pathogen. Generally, the
agricultural harvest gets contaminated with the
fungi and releases different mycotoxins which
when
ingested
causes
acute
or
chronic
mycotoxicosis. The symptoms of mycotoxicosis
depend on the type of the mycotoxin, duration of
exposure to mycotoxin and the organ involved. It
affects the kidney, liver, lungs, skin, etc., again
depending on the toxin. Aﬂatoxin is one of the
most common mycotoxins affecting humans and
animals. Aﬂatoxin, produced by A. ﬂavus, causes
hepatic carcinoma by imparting mutation in
the tumour suppressor gene-P53 followed by the
unchecked multiplication of hepatocytes. The
association of this mutation has been noted in
liver cancer patients from China and Africa. It
has been hypothesised that kwashiorkor and
Rey’s
syndrome
are
caused
by
aﬂatoxins.
Ochratoxin is another major toxin produced by
A.
ﬂavus
and
is
known
as
nephrotoxin,
hepatotoxin, mutagenic and carcinomatous. Citri-
nin, another mycotoxin produced by various spe-
cies, is a nephrotoxin species. The yellow rice
toxicosis reported is the classical example of
mycotoxicosis.
The transmission and habitat of some impor-
tant fungi in India are described in Table 65.2.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of fungal infections can be
made either by conventional phenotypic methods
like direct microscopic examination of specimens
and isolation of fungi by culture or by using
non-culture methods such as serology, detection
of
biomarker/s
or
DNA-based
molecular
methods.
Direct Microscopy
Direct microscopic examination is an important
method that can be used for rapid diagnosis.
Demonstration of the fungal elements such as
hyphae and yeast forms in the clinical samples
suggests either colonisation or infection. While
dealing
with
opportunistic
fungal
infections
caused by saprophytic fungi, it becomes more
important especially to correlate with culture.
Direct microscopy sometimes give a deﬁnitive
diagnosis by demonstrating the size, shape and
other morphological features in the specimens
such as in coccidioidomycosis, histplasmosis,
paracoccidioidomycosis,
blastomycosis,
mucormycosis, eumycetoma, sporotrichosis, etc.

952

Introduction to Mycology
Potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount exam-
ination is commonly used in the concentration of
10–40% depending on the specimens subjected to
examination. For bone and nail samples, 40%
KOH is desirable compared to 10% used for
scrapings and biopsies. KOH dissolves all the
protein material in the specimen but chitin present
in the cell wall is resistant allowing identiﬁcation
of the fungal elements.
For more rapid detection of fungi in the tissue
ﬂuorescent
dyes
such
as
Calcoﬂuor
or
blankophore which speciﬁcally binds to chitin
present in the fungal are used and examined
under the ﬂuorescent microscope. Some special
stains such as Gomori’s methenamine silver stain,
Periodic acid Schiff’s stain can be used to dem-
onstrate fungi from the histopathological tissues.
Negative stains such as India ink or Nigrosin
preparation are used to demonstrate the capsule
of Cryptococcus spp. in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) or other body ﬂuids. Gram stain can also be
a useful technique especially to demonstrate Can-
dida species in the exudates, scrapings or swabs.
The major disadvantage of direct microscopy
is its low sensitivity and requires experience to
interpret the results accurately.
Culture
Fungal culture, direct microscopic examination
and
histopathological
examination
of
sterile
specimens are the gold standards for the diagnosis
of fungal infections. For primary isolation of the
fungi from the tissues, the most commonly used
media is Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) which
supports the growth of all medically important
fungi. Instead of using the standard SDA,
Emmons modiﬁcation of SDA with less glucose
and neutral pH should be preferred. Other pri-
mary isolation media that should be routinely
inoculated include brain heart infusion agar (for
blood culture and isolation of dimorphic fungi),
bird seed agar (for selective isolation of Crypto-
coccus), CHROM agar (as differential media to
differentiate Candida species), blood agar, etc.
The
media
should
be
supplemented
with
antibiotics
such
as
chloramphenicol
or
gentamycin
to
prevent
bacterial
growth,
especially for non-sterile specimen. The addition
of cycloheximide to the media will inhibit the
saprophytic fungi and bacteria allowing the path-
ogen to grow. Two sets of SDA should be
inoculated, one set with cycloheximide and chlor-
amphenicol/gentamicin should be incubated at
25 and other set without these antibiotics at 37.
Growth Characteristics
The growth characteristics generally helpful in
the identiﬁcation of fungi include: (1) morphology
of
the
colonies/presence
of
hyphae
or
pseudohyphae (diameter, septa), conidia (spores)
on the obverse of the culture plate, (2) colour of
colonies on the obverse, (3) pigmentation on the
reverse and (4) time taken for colony growth
(slow/rapid).
These
characteristics
can
be
observed in tease mount, slide culture or adhesive
tape preparations using lactophenol cotton blue
(LPCB).
Teased Mount Preparation
Several methods are available for microscopic
preparation of fungi, of which tease mount is
traditionally followed. It is an easy and rapid
method to perform and often sufﬁcient enough
to identify fungi encountered commonly in clini-
cal setups. Tease mounts are prepared for the
purpose of demonstrating conidia, other repro-
ductive structures or morphological forms may
aid in the identiﬁcation of the fungi. The charac-
teristic shape, arrangement of conidia and size of
hyphae are add-on information for identiﬁcation
of moulds. The major setback of this method is
that the arrangement of conidia may be dislocated
by the pressure applied on the cover slip during
mount preparation.
Slide Culture
It has been an important diagnostic aid for many
years and is being used worldwide. The major
disadvantage of tease mount preparation can be
resolved by this method. The strength of slide
culture is that the fungi are grown and maintained
in their characteristic shapes. The principle
behind
this
technique
is
that
growing,
maintaining
and
periodically
observing
the

colonies may help in accurate identiﬁcation.
Technical expertise and the time taken for colony
growth and incubation duration are the demerits
of this preparation.
Classification of Fungi
953
An SDA plug is transferred to the centre of a
sterile slide using a sterile scalpel. The slide is
then set atop a piece of ﬁlter paper placed in the
bottom of a sterile Petri dish. The fungal strain to
be identiﬁed is inoculated to the edges of the agar
plug in 3 or 4 areas. A sterile coverslip is placed
on top of the agar plug. Moistened ﬁlter paper in
the Petri dish prevent drying. Culture is incubated
at 25 C. After growth (approximately 48 h), the
coverslip is then placed on a fresh slide with a
drop of LPCB and microscopically observed.
Sporulation-inducing media like potato dextrose
agar, oatmeal agar and corn meal agar are
alternatives to SDA.
Cellophane Tape Preparation
It is said to be a technically easier and more
economical method for microscopic identiﬁcation
of fungi. A small length of thetape is touched to
the surface of the colony. It is then adhered to a
microscopic slide with a drop of LPCB, followed
by microscopic observation. The advantage of
this technique is that the conidia are generally
intact, thus identiﬁcation can be made with ease.
Though culture based method is gold standard
for diagnosis of fungal infections, it has some
limitation in terms of turnover time because of
slow growing nature of some fungi and low yield
sensitivity. The sensitivity of the technique can be
improved by concentrating the specimens before
inoculation of the specimens such as blood (lysis
centrifugation) and body ﬂuids by taking as much
large volume as possible and subjecting it to
centrifugation. However, culture can help in man-
agement of the case as antifungal susceptibility
testing can guide accurate institution of the
antifungals.
Serology
Serological
techniques,
especially
antibody
detection, have limitation in the diagnosis of fun-
gal infections as raised antibodies can be noted in
colonisation or prior exposure to opportunistic
fungi. Antibody-based tests are, in general, useful
for the diagnosis of endemic fungal infections
such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis and
blastomycosis. However, rise in antibody titre
should be demonstrated in the paired sera to con-
ﬁrm the diagnosis. The complement ﬁxation test
is still used for the diagnosis of endemic fungal
infections. Highly sensitive tests such as ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), Western
blot and radioimmunoassay are developed for the
diagnosis
of
these
infections,
interpretation
becomes difﬁcult as it may indicate prior expo-
sure or previous infection. Antibody-based tests
are mainly applicable for the diagnosis of allergic
fungal diseases such as ABPA and allergic fungal
sinusitis.
Antigen Detection
It is an useful approach for the diagnosis of fungal
infections. Antigen detection can be done from
serum, CSF or urine specimen. Detection of poly-
saccharide capsular antigen of C. neoformans in
CSF is one of the best antigen detection tests and
has the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of more than
95%. Latex agglutination test has been commonly
used to detect cryptococcal antigen. However,
recently, lateral ﬂow assay is increasingly being
used as it can be used as point-of-care test at the
bedside as it does not demand technical expertise.
Urine histoplasma antigen is one of the highly
sensitive and speciﬁc techniques for the diagnosis
of disseminated histoplasmosis. Detection of
mannan, the component of Candida cell wall is
another approach for diagnosing invasive candi-
diasis. However, this test has low sensitivity
(~50%) and may not detect the infection by all
the species of Candida. Hence, a combination of
mannan antigen and mannan antibody detection
tests are used which have high sensitivity and
speciﬁcity (70–80%).
Galactomannan
(GM)
is
a
heat-stable
heteropolysaccharide antigen found in the cell
walls of all Aspergillus species and released into
the blood only when the hyphae are invading the
tissues. Hence only a low amount of GM is pres-
ent in the circulation. The development of highly
sensitive technique such as sandwich ELISA that

uses rat monoclonal antibody raised against
galactomannan antigen has allowed the lower
detection of GM. The sensitivity of this test is
one nanogram. This test is currently used for the
diagnosis
of
invasive
aspergillosis.
Galactomannan (GM) detection can also allow
monitoring the aspergillosis as the cut-off level
will decrease if the patient responds to the anti-
fungal therapy.
954
65
Introduction to Mycology
Non-culture Methods
Detection of Fungal Cell Wall Markers
Detection of the cell wall component, 3-beta-D-
glucan (BDG) of the pathogenic fungi is another
approach for the diagnosis of fungal infections,
especially invasive candidiasis. BDG is released
into the circulation during the invasive fungal
infections in low quantity hence its detection
can also be used as an indicator of invasive fungal
infections. BDG has the ability to coagulate the
amoebocytes of the horseshoe crab and this coag-
ulation can be detected using a kinetic ELISA
reader. As the amount of BDG present in the
serum sample suggests invasive disease, the
cut-off has been described to interpret the results.
The cut-off of >80 picogram is considered signif-
icant. The sensitivity of diagnosing invasive can-
didiasis
is
>90%.
As
C.
neoformans
and
Mucorales have very less BDG in their cell
wall, this test may not be useful to diagnose
infection by these agents.
Detection of Fungal Metabolites
However, detection of fungal metabolites such as
D arabinitol can be used for the diagnosis of
invasive candidiasis. However, this approach is
not been employed in the routine diagnostic labo-
ratory
as
detecting
this
metabolite
requires
sophisticated instruments such as gas liquid chro-
matography which is cumbersome and difﬁcult to
run the instrument.
Molecular Diagnosis
Detection of fungal DNA in the clinical sample is
another interesting approach for the diagnosis of
fungal infections.
The next generation of molecular diagnosis
which is gaining importance is polymerase chain
reaction where ampliﬁcation of target gene and its
detection are done by conventional gel electro-
phoresis or by real-time automated format. One
approach has been to detect pan-fungal markers
in diverse specimen types to establish the fungal
aetiology. The internal transcribed spacers (ITS)
region ITS1 and ITS 2 and D1/D2 regions of the
28S rRNA gene are commonly targeted. This
method is also useful to identify novel fungi.
The pan fungal PCR can be followed by a second
PCR directed against a genus or species-speciﬁc
target gene.
Presently, most molecular techniques avail-
able are mainly used for the identiﬁcation of
fungi rather than direct detection from clinical
specimens. Sequencing of ribosomal DNA using
pan fungal primers is the gold standard for the
identiﬁcation
of
fungi.
Presently,
Matrix-
associated laser desorption ioniation–Time of
Flight (MALDI_TOF) is increasingly being
used for the identiﬁcation of the yeast and also
to some extent for moulds.
DNA sequencing can also be used for precise
species identiﬁcation.
Antifungal Drugs
Unlike the large plethora of antibiotics available
for treating bacterial infection, the number of
antifungal class available are few. The class of
antifungals available for treating human fungal
infections are poleyenes (amphotericin B), azoles
(ﬂuconazole,
voriconazole,
itraconazole,
posaconazole and isavuconazole), echinocandins
(caspofungin, anidulafungin and micafungin) and
allylamines (terbinaﬁne) and pyrimidine analogue
of ﬂucytosine (5-ﬂurocytosine). Ketoconazole,
miconazole and griesofulvin which were earlier
used to treat systemic infection are not being used
presently due to their toxicity. However, ketoco-
nazole, miconazole and many other antifungals
are available for topical treatment of fungal
infections. Amphotericin B is a broad spectrum
antifungal
and
it
is

Superficial, Cutaneous
and Subcutaneous Mycoses
66
Fungal infections, depending on the tissue part
involved, can be classiﬁed into three major
groups as follows:
Superﬁcial
mycoses:
These
are
surface
infections of the skin, affecting the outermost
layers of skin, hair and mucosa.
Cutaneous mycoses: These are skin infections
involving the epidermis and its integuments, the
hair and nails.
Subcutaneous mycoses: These are dermis
infections,
subcutaneous
tissue,
muscle
and
fascia.
Superficial Mycoses
Superﬁcial mycosis caused by fungi is restricted
to the outermost layers of the skin and hair. The
condition usually causes cosmetic problems,
quickly diagnosed and treated. It includes four
important conditions: (1) pityriasis versicolor,
(2) tinea nigra, (3) black piedra and (4) white
piedra.
Pityriasis Versicolor
Pityriasis versicolor or tinea versicolor is a super-
ﬁcial skin infection caused by Malassezia species.
Malassezia
furfur,
Malassezia
globosa
and
Malassezia restricta are the common species
implicated with the condition.

All
Malassezia
species,
except
Malassezia pachydermatis, require fatty acids
for growth; hence it is cultured on the Sabouraud
dextrose agar (SDA) overlaid with a layer of olive
oil or special media containing fatty acids. On
incubation at 37 C, the fungus produces creamy
colonies within 5–7 days. The lactophenol cotton
blue (LPCB) wet mount shows budding yeast
cells and some bottle-shaped cells. The fungus is
found on parts of the body rich in sebaceous
glands.
Lesions of pityriasis versicolor are found most
commonly on the upper tissue, arms and abdo-
men. They appear as hypopigmented (often) or
hyperpigmented macular lesions often associated
with slight scaling or itching. The condition is
mostly asymptomatic. It occurs most frequently
in hot and humid weather.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is usu-
ally made by demonstrating both budding yeast
cells and hyphae in the KOH preparation of skin
scrapings.
Characteristic
‘spaghetti
and
meatballs’ appearance of fungus is demonstrated
in the microscopy of KOH preparation of the
skin. Culture is not carried out routinely for diag-
nosis. Topical miconazole is the treatment of
choice.
Tinea Nigra
Tinea nigra is an infection of the keratinised layer
of skin caused by Exophiala werneckii or

Cladosporium werneckii. C. werneckii is a dimor-
phic fungus that produces melanin. The fungus on
the SDA grows as yeast with many cells in vari-
ous stages of cell division, producing a typical
two-celled oval structure on primary isolation
from a clinical specimen. On prolonged incuba-
tion, elongated hyphae develop, and mycelia and
conidia are predominantly found in older cultures.
958
66
Superficial, Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Mycoses
A well-demarcated brown–black macular
lesion, which appears as a brownish spot on the
skin, is a typical manifestation of the condition.
These brownish to black lesions are most com-
monly seen on palms and soles.
Laboratory diagnosis of tinea nigra is made
by microscopy of the KOH preparation of skin
scrapings collected from the affected part. Typical
darkly pigmented yeast-like cells and hyper
fragmented hyphae are demonstrated. The culture
of the skin scraping on the SDA conﬁrms the
diagnosis.
Black Piedra
Black piedra is a superﬁcial infection of the hair
caused by Piedraia hortae, a dematiaceous fun-
gus. The fungus occurs in the perfect state when it
colonises the shaft of hairs. The culture of
specimens on SDA shows slow-growing brown
to reddish black mycelium, which is considered
an asexual or anamorphic stage of the fungus.
The teleomorphic state, which is the perfect state
of the fungus, is occasionally found in old
cultures. At this state, asci, which contain
spindle-shaped
ascospores,
develop
within
specialised structures.
Infection of shaft of hairs of beard and scalp
is the major clinical feature of black piedra. Lab-
oratory diagnosis of the condition is made by
demonstrating
nodules
containing
asci
with
spindle-shaped ascospores in 10% KOH mount
of the hair.
White Piedra
White piedra is an infection of the hair caused by
the yeast-like organism Trichosporon species.
Trichosporon
asahii,
Trichosporon
inkin,
Trichosporon cutaneum, Trichosporon mucoides
and
Trichosporon
ovoides
are
the
species
implicated with white piedra. The fungus can be
grown on SDA and other media containing cyclo-
heximide. On SDA, it forms green-coloured
colonies, which subsequently become yellowish-
grey and wrinkled. Microscopic examination of
the colony shows septate hyphae that break rap-
idly to form arthroconidia. The latter subse-
quently
become
round
and
develop
to
blastoconidia.
White piedra is commonly found in South
America, Central and Eastern Europe and Japan.
The hair of the scalp, moustache and beard
are commonly affected in white piedra. The
development of a soft, pasty, cream-coloured
growth along the infected hair shaft characterises
the condition. The initial growth of Trichosporon
occurs beneath the epidermis of hair. The infected
hair shaft consists of mycelium that rapidly
fragments to arthroconidia.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is
made by demonstrating fragmented hyphae that
develop
into
arthroconidia
or
produce
blastoconidia in 10% KOH mount of hair. The
culture of the fungus from the clinical specimen
conﬁrms the diagnosis. Features of the organisms
causing superﬁcial mycoses are summarised in
Table 66.1.
Cutaneous Mycoses
Dermatophytosis
or
cutaneous
mycoses
are
diseases of the skin, hair and nail. These
infections are caused by a homogeneous group
of closely related fungi known as dermatophytes.
These
dermatophytes
infect
only
superﬁcial
keratinised structures, such as skin, hair and
nail, but not deeper tissues.
Dermatophytes
The most important dermatophytes that cause
infection in humans are classiﬁed into the follow-
ing three genera: Trichophyton (causes infection

of hair, skin and nail), Microsporum (infection of
hair and skin) and Epidermophyton (causes infec-
tion of skin and nails, but not hair) (Fig. 66.1).

The dermatophytes, based on their natural hab-
itat and host preferences, can be classiﬁed into the
following groups:
1. Anthropophilic
species:
These
dermatophytes are typically adapted to live
on a human host. They are transmitted from
human
to
human
through
fallen
hairs,
desquamated epithelium, combs, hairbrushes,
towels,
etc.
Examples
are
Trichophyton
rubrum,
Microsporum
audouinii
and
Epidermophyton ﬂoccosum.
2. Zoophilic species: These dermatophytes live
on animals and often cause infection in their
animal host. These zoophilic species are trans-
mitted from infected animals to humans by
direct and indirect contact with domestic
animals (e.g. cat and dog) and occasionally
wild animals. Examples are Trichophyton
violaceum and Microsporum canis.
3. Geophilic species: These are saprophytic
fungi found in soil or dead organic substances.
They occasionally cause infection in humans
and animals. Examples are the Microsporum
gypseum
and
Trichophyton
ajelloi.
Dermatophytes
usually
grow
only
on
keratinised skin and appendages and do not
penetrate the living tissues. In some infected
persons, hypersensitivity to fungus antigen
may cause secondary eruptions, such as

vesicles on the ﬁnger. This reaction is known
as the dermatophytid (id) reaction. This
reaction occurs due to a hypersensitivity
response to circulating fungal antigen, and
these lesions do not contain any fungal
hyphae.
The asexual state of selected dermatophytes is
mentioned in Table 66.2.
Clinical Syndromes
The skin infections caused by dermatophytes are
chronic infections of the skin often found in the
warm, humid areas of the body, such as athlete
foot and jock itch. Typical ringworm lesions are
circular,
which
have
an
inﬂamed
border
containing papules and vesicles surrounding a
clear area of relatively normal skin. These lesions
are associated with variable degrees of scaling
and inﬂammation. Broken hair and thickened bro-
ken nails are often seen in this lesson.
Clinically,
ringworm
can
be
classiﬁed
depending
on
the
site
affected.
These
are
(1) Tinea capitis involving the scalp, (2) Tinea
corporis involving non-hairy skin of the body,
(3) Tinea cruris affecting groin, (4) Tinea pedis
affecting the foot and (5) Tinea barbae affecting
beard areas of the face and neck.
Favus is a chronic ringworm infection affect-
ing hair follicles. It leads to alopecia and scarring.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is based on demonstrating a
fungal element in a clinical specimen by micros-
copy and conﬁrmation by culture.
The specimens include skin scrapings and nail
clippings or hair taken from the areas suspected to
be infected by dermatophytes. These entire
specimens are treated with an alkali solution to
clear epithelial cells and other debris.
Direct Microscopy
Direct microscopy is useful only for diagnosis.
Examination of 10% direct KOH mount may
show
fungal
hyphae.
Three
types
of
hair
infections can be demonstrated in microscopy of
10% KOH wet mount as follows (Fig. 66.2).
Ectothrix
Ectothrix infection is characterised by the pres-
ence of a layer of arthrospores on the surface of
the hair shaft (Fig. 66.3). It is caused by
M.
audouinii,
M.
canis
and
Trichophyton
mentagrophytes.
Endothrix
The clusters of arthrospores are found entirely
within the hair shaft in endothrix infection. It is
caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, T. violaceum
and Trichophyton schoenleinii.
Favus: In favus, there is sparse hyphal growth
and formation of air spaces within the hair shaft.
It is caused by T. violaceum, T. schoenleinii and
M. gypseum.
Culture
Culture is always carried out to identify the spe-
ciﬁc
causative
fungal
agent.
The
clinical
specimens
are
cultured
by
inoculation
on
SDA-containing antibiotics like cycloheximide.
The media after inoculation are incubated at
25–30 C for 3 weeks. In the media containing
cycloheximide and incubated at 25 C, most path-
ogenic fungi, including dermatophytes, grow

well, while saprophytic fungi and bacteria are
inhibited.

The cultures are examined at regular intervals,
and dermatophytes are identiﬁed based on (1) col-
ony morphology, (2) pigment production and
(3)
the
presence
of
microconidia
and
macroconidia. The LPCB preparation of the
colonies shows microconidia, macroconidia or
both. Only macroconidia are present in the
Epidermophyton infection. Few macroconidia
and
more
microconidia
are
present
in
Trichophyton infection. Macroconidia are pre-
dominantly present in Microsporum infection.
The differentiation of the three genera is based

mainly on the nature of macroconidia (Table 66.3
and Fig. 66.4).

may have a special type of hyphae, such as spiral
hyphae or racket hyphae. Trichophyton species
infect hairs, skin and nails.

Other Tests
Hair Perforation Test
This test is performed to differentiate T. rubrum
from T. mentagrophytes. The test is also used to
differentiate
M.
canis
from
Microsporum
equinus. This test is performed by collecting a

5–10 mm short shaft of human hair and placing it
in a Petri dish with 20 mL of distilled water. Then,
two to three drops of 10% sterile yeast extract are
added to the Petri dish with hair shafts. These hair
shafts are inoculated with test fungus cultured on
SDA. The culture is incubated at 25 C for up to
1 month, during which the hairs are removed, and
the LPCB mount of the hair is examined micro-
scopically at weekly intervals to demonstrate the
perforation of hair.

T. mentagrophytes show a positive hair perfo-
ration test characterised by a wedge-shaped hair
perforation. This test is negative for T. rubrum, in
which only surface eruption of the hair shaft is
demonstrated.
Urease Test
The urease test is carried out to differentiate
T. mentagrophytes from T. rubrum. This test is
performed by inoculating a tube of Christensen
medium with the fungus and incubating at 25 C
for
5
days
at
room
temperature.
Most
T. mentagrophytes are urease positive within
5 days.
Growth on Rice Grains
This test is useful to differentiate M. canis from
M. audouinii. In this test, sterile, non-fortiﬁed rice
is inoculated with the hyphae of the fungi to be
tested. The medium is observed for growth after
10 days of incubation at room temperature.
M. canis usually grows well and forms many
conidia on rice grain, whereas M. audouinii fails
to grow.
Treatment
Terbinaﬁne is the ﬁrst drug of choice, followed by
itraconazole
or
ﬂuconazole
for
treating
dermatophytosis. These drugs can be given as
topical application or orally, depending on the

extent of the lesion. Griseofulvin is another sys-
temic
antifungal
used
for
treating
dermatophytosis. Nail infection should be treated
for a longer time. Local application of antifungal
lacquer is effective. Other topical agents such as
miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, amorolﬁne,
luliconazole and sertaconazole are effective.
Subcutaneous Mycosis
965
Subcutaneous Mycosis
Subcutaneous mycosis is deﬁned as a fungal
infection associated with the development of a
characteristic lesion in the subcutaneous tissue
and overlying skin with or without extension to
bone and muscle. This is caused by a heteroge-
neous group of fungi of low pathogenic potential
introduced in the body percutaneously from a
trivial trauma. Table 66.4 shows the classiﬁcation
of subcutaneous mycoses.
Mycetoma
The condition was described as early as in
Atharva Veda: padmavalmikam means ‘anthill
foot’. John Gill ﬁrst described the condition in
Madurai
(India)
in
1842.
Chalmer
and
Christopherson coined the term madura mycosis
in 1916.

Mycetoma is a slowly progressive, chronic
granulomatous infection of the skin and subcuta-
neous tissues with occasional underlying fascia
and
bone
involvement,
usually
affecting
extremities. The condition is characterised by a
triad of tumefaction, draining sinuses and grains
or granules. It is caused by several actinomycetes
(actinomycotic
mycetoma)
and
ﬁlamentous
fungi (eumycotic mycetoma) that enter through
penetrating injuries resulting from thorn pricks,
splinters, etc. Lower extremities are most com-
monly involved. Microabscesses are formed in
subcutaneous tissues surrounded by a polymor-
phonuclear inﬂammatory reaction. The centre of
the lesion consists of tangled ﬁlaments of these
organisms (Fig. 66.7).
During
the
course
of
infection,
microabscesses burst open with the formation
of chronic multiple sinuses discharging copious,
seropurulent ﬂuid-containing granules. The col-
our and consistency of these granules vary
depending on the fungi or actinomycetes that
cause the disease (Table 66.5). The condition is
characterised
by
the
formation
of
painless,
localised, swollen lesions on the affected limbs.
Multiple discharging sinuses are present. Dis-
charge
is
purulent,
mucopurulent
or
serosanguinous and usually contains granules of
varying size, colour and consistency. Fascia and
bone may be affected, but underlying tendons and
nerves are never affected.
The condition during the period spreads
slowly but over the years by contiguity. Some-
times the infection becomes extensive by involv-
ing the buttock and trunk. Actinomycetes spread
faster than eumycetes. Haematogenous spread
is rare.
Mycetoma is documented worldwide but is
common in tropical and subtropical countries.
Actinomycetoma accounts nearly for 65% of all
mycetomas in India. Actinomadura madurae is
the
major
causative
agent.
Streptomyces
somaliensis infection is seen more frequently in
eastern India. The condition is more common in

rural areas and males (3.5:1) than females. It
affects
mostly
highly
active
persons
aged
20–40 years. It is an occupational hazard affect-
ing farmers, herdsmen, carpenters, builders, land
workers, ﬁeld workers, etc. Euycotic mycetomas
require surgical treatment by amputation, while
actinomycotic mycetomas are treated well by
sulphonamides and antibiotics.

A high index of clinical suspicion and proper
history is essential for the clinical diagnosis of
mycetoma. Laboratory diagnosis depends on the
demonstration of the fungi and fungal ﬁlaments in
granules, pus and biopsy tissue by microscopy.
The granules on naked eye examination may be
hard or soft, round or lobulated and vary in size
from 0.5 to 3 mm. These may be black, white,
cream or red. Microscopy of the granules may
reveal very thin ﬁlaments, measuring less than
1 μm in diameters in cases of actinomycotic
mycetomas. However, the fungal ﬁlaments may
be broader and often show septate hyphae and
chlamydospores
in
eumycotic
mycetoma
(Fig. 66.8).
Chromoblastomycosis
Chromoblastomycosis is a slowly progressing
granulomatous infection caused by several soil
fungi such as Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fonsecaea
compactum,
Cladophialophora
carrionii
and
Phialophora verrucosa. These fungi are called
dematiaceous fungi because they have brown to
black melanin pigment in their cell wall, and their
conidia or hyphae are dark coloured, either grey
or black. All the fungi causing chromoblas-
tomycosis appear morphologically similar in
tissues
stained
by
haematoxylin
and
eosin
(H and E) or other stains.
The infection occurs following the introduc-
tion of any of the dematiaceous fungi into the skin
through trauma. The development of warty
nodules that appear at the inoculation site
characterises chromoblastomycosis. During the
course of infection, these lesions vegetate and
develop into a cauliﬂower-like lesions. The

disease is more common in tropical and subtropi-
cal countries (Fig. 66.9).

granules from a case of

hyphae may be noted inside

Shivaprakash)
Laboratory diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis
is made by demonstrating small clusters of round
and dark brown, thick-walled cells (8–12 μm) in
tissues. The fungi are found in the dermis but are
occasionally seen in the subcutaneous tissues.
Direct KOH wet mount of skin is a rapid method
for diagnosing the condition by demonstrating
these fungi in scales removed from the surface
of these lesions. In addition to these, copper-
coloured spherical cells in various stages of cell
division are seen. These are the tissue forms of the
fungus and called sclerotic or medlar bodies
(Fig. 66.10) of the fungus.
Phaeohyphomycosis
A phaeohyphomycosis is a heterogeneous group
of
cutaneous
diseases
caused
by
various
dematiaceous fungi. The phaeohyphomycotic
cyst is the most common form of presentation.
A wide number of dematiaceous fungi has been
associated
with
various
types
of
phaeohyphomycosis.
Some
of
the
common
causes of phaeohyphomycosis are Exophiala
jeanselmei,
Bipolaris
spicifera,
Wangiella
dermatitidis,
Curvularia
lunata,
Alternaria
alternata, etc.
Diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis is made by
demonstrating darkly pigmented, septate hyphae
measuring 5–10 μm in diameter in tissues. The
drug
of
choice
for
the
treatment
of
phaeohyphomycosis is itraconazole along with
5-ﬂuorocytosine. Cautery and surgical removal
of the early lesion are also useful.
Sporotrichosis
Sporotrichosis is a chronic pyogenic granuloma-
tous lesion of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
caused by the Sporothrix schenckii complex.
S. schenckii, Sporothrix globosa, Sporothrix
braziliensis and S. mexicana are common species
causing human infections. Sporothrix is a dimor-
phic fungus found worldwide, but some species
(S. braziliensis and S. mexicana) have geographi-
cally restricted distribution. The fungus is found
in soil, decaying woods, thorns and infected
animals, including rats, cats, dogs and horses.
Spore is the infective stage of the fungus. It
causes infection primarily on the extremities
through direct contact of the skin by spores. Typ-
ically, infection is introduced in the skin through

the penetration of thorns. At the site of thorn
injury, it causes a local pustule or ulcer with the
nodules along the draining lymphatics. Fre-
quently, the regional lymph nodes draining the
ulcer enlarge, suppurate and ulcerate (Fig. 66.11).
The primary lesion may remain localised or in the
immunocompromised individuals and may dis-
seminate to involve the bones, joints, lungs and
the central nervous system.

Sporothrix spp. occurs in two phases. The
yeast phase occurs in tissue and the culture at
37 C, while the mycelium phase occurs in the
culture at 22–25 C. The yeast appears as round,
oval or cigar-shaped cells with irregular borders
in infected tissue. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) or
Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain is useful
to demonstrate these structures in the stained
smears. The fungus on SDA at 25 C produces
black and shiny colonies, which become wrinkled
and foggy over time. The mould contains hyphae-
bearing ﬂower-like structures of small conidia on
delicate sterigmata.

10.1007/978-3-642-76200-
0_7)
Laboratory diagnosis of sporotrichosis is
made by demonstrating asteroid bodies in the
pus of the abscesses. Asteroid bodies consist of
a central basophilic budding yeast cell with eosin-
ophilic material radiating from the centre.
Isolation of the fungi by the culture of ulcer
exudates or pus aspirated from a subcutaneous
nodule or biopsy material conﬁrms the diagnosis
of sporotrichosis. LPCB wet mount of the colony
shows thin, delicate hyphae bearing conidia
occurring in a rosette pattern at the end of delicate
conidiophores. Conidia are also demonstrated
along the sides of the hyphae. Repeated subcul-
ture of mycelium of fungi on blood agar tubes at
37 C induces the formation of yeast colonies.
The LPCB wet mount of these colonies shows
cigar-shaped yeast-like cells.
Itraconazole is the drug of choice for the treat-
ment of the condition. Potassium iodide drops

help and add as an adjunctive for antifungal
treatment.

Rhinosporidiosis
Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous dis-
ease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi which
was earlier considered as fungi and now classiﬁed
as Protozoa, Mesomycetozoa. More than 90% of
cases are reported from India, Sri Lanka, and
South America. The cases have been reported
from throughout India. The endemic foci of infec-
tion have been reported from Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh.
R. seeberi cannot be cultured in cell-free artiﬁ-
cial media. Animal inoculation is also not suc-
cessful. The mode of infection is not known.
However, it is suggested that it is transmitted in
dust and water. Fish is believed to be the natural
host. Infection is seen most commonly in persons
taking bath in stagnant pools and in individuals
who dive in streams to collect sand from
river beds.

Rhinosporidium seeberi

Shivaprakash)
The disease is characterized by the develop-
ment of large friable polyps or wart-like lesion in
the nose, conjunctiva, or eye. The lesion is also
occasionally seen in ears, larynx, bronchus, ure-
thra, vagina, rectum, and skin.
Laboratory
diagnosis
of
rhinosporidiosis
depends
on
demonstration
of
sporangia
of
R. seeberi in tissue sections. R. seeberi can be
demonstrated in tissue sections stained with H&E
or other special stains, such as GMS stain and
PAS stain. The stained smear on microscopic
examination shows a hyperplastic surface epithe-
lium with the presence of chronic inﬂammatory
exudates. The epidermis and stroma are embed-
ded with sporangia (Fig. 66.12). The sporangia
measure 10–200 μm in diameter and contain
hundreds of endospores, each measuring 6–7 μm
in diameter. The spores when released develop
into new sporangia.
Treatment of the condition is carried out by
surgery or cauterization. Chemotherapy with dap-
sone is also useful.

Subcutaneous Mycosis
971
Entomophthoromycosis
The entomophthorales, Conidiobolus coronatus
and
Basidiobolus
ranarum/Basidiobolus
haptosporus are the pathogenic fungi that cause
entomophthromycosis. It is generally found in
decaying fruit and vegetable matter and commen-
sal in the intestines of reptiles and amphibians. It
has a global distribution. It was ﬁrstly reported
from Indonesia, followed by reports from tropical
Africa, India, Southeast Asia and northern parts
of Australia.
Entomophthoromycosis is a chronic, inﬂam-
matory or granulomatous, slowly progressive dis-
ease often restricted to subcutaneous tissues. It
ﬁrst develops as a localised subcutaneous nod-
ule/lesion and spreads slowly to form a hard,
painless mass involving the cutaneous and subcu-
taneous tissues.
Diagnosis includes deep skin biopsy from the
subcutaneous mass that is required for micros-
copy, culture and histopathological examination.
Colonies grow rapidly and are ﬂat, cream-
coloured, glabrous becoming radially folded and
covered by a ﬁne-powdery, white mycelium and
conidiophores. It shows the presence of primitive
aseptate or pauciseptate hyphae. When incubated
at 30 C, culture shows white to grey waxy
colonies for Conidiobolus spp. and cream or yel-
low waxy colonies for Basidiobolus spp.
Diminutions of the lesions sometimes occur
spontaneously. The use of potassium iodide has
been shown to be satisfactory in many cases. Oral
itraconazole and terbinaﬁne hydrochloride may
also be effective. Surgery may be required in a
few cases.

Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic
Infections
67
Systemic mycoses are generally geographically
restricted diseases caused by fungi collectively
referred to as endemic fungi. These fungi can
cause infection in apparently immunocompetent
individuals.
Systemic Mycosis
The systemic mycoses include coccidioidomyco-
sis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis and paracocci-
dioidomycosis. In most cases, the infection
develops initially in the lungs; later, the skin and
other organs may be involved. All these fungi
exhibit thermal dimorphism, growing as mould
or mycelial form in their natural habitat and seen
as yeast form in tissues.
Coccidioidomycosis
Coccidioidomycosis
caused
by
Coccidioides
immitis was ﬁrst recognised as a distinct disease
entity in 1892. The disease is distributed mainly
in southwestern ca. Its two species are C. immitis
and Coccidioides posadasii. Most of the cases
caused by C. immitis have been reported from
San
Joaquin
Valley,
California,
whereas
C. posadasii has been implicated from patients
in other states of the United States and Mexico.
Coccidioides spp. is a dimorphic fungus, which
occurs as a mould in soil and the culture at 25 C
and as a spherule in tissue and the culture at
37 C. The spherule is oval with a thick, double-
refractile wall ﬁlled with endospores. Each endo-
spore, measuring 2–5 μm in diameter, gives rise
to a new spherule.

The Fungus
C. immitis grows in the mycelial form in the soil
of endemic areas. Subsequently, the hyphal cells
either develop into barrel-shaped structures pro-
ducing the characteristic arthroconidia. In pulmo-
nary acinus (where alveoli are located), the
arthrospore uncovers its external layer, expands
its size and develops into a round structure called
‘spherule’.
Pathogenesis of Coccidiomycosis
The arthroconidia are the infective stage of the
fungus. Arthroconidia turn airborne when the soil
is disrupted. Inhalation of such arthroconidia by
the susceptible host or immunocompromised host
initiates
the
infection.
The
transport
of
arthroconidia, either in soil on fomites or due to
unusually severe dust storms, has produced
infections in persons without endemic exposure.
The spherule replicates by a process called
endosporulation.
Disruption
of
the
spherule
induces the release of endospores, which further
develops into spherules again, and this cycle
repeats.

974
67
Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
The spherule is the characteristic tissue form
of the organism. Resistance of the spherule to
eradication by host defences is the main factor
in the pathogenesis of the disease. Spherules
cause
progressive
suppuration
and
tissue
necrosis.
Clinical Syndromes
More than half of the cases are asymptomatic. In
symptomatic cases, C. immitis causes a primary
pulmonary disease and disseminated disease. Pul-
monary infection is the most frequent presenta-
tion in symptomatic patients, and the ﬁrst
symptoms of the primary infection usually appear
7–21 days after exposure. Common symptoms
include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath,
fever, fatigue, weight loss and even headache.
Skin manifestations may develop as part of the
primary illness as a nonpruritic ﬁne papular rash,
which is usually transient and easily missed.
Other complaints include erythema nodosum,
erythema multiforme and migratory arthralgia
(especially in knees and ankles), which is called
desert rheumatism.
Extrapulmonary dissemination is less common
but can occur in immunodeﬁciency conditions.
The most common site of dissemination is the
skin presenting as superﬁcial maculopapular
lesions,
verrucose
ulcers
and
subcutaneous
abscesses. Joints and bones also are common
sites of dissemination and are associated with
prominent synovitis and effusion. Coccidioidal
meningitis
is
the
most
serious
form
of
disseminated infection, which is nearly always
fatal within 2 years of diagnosis.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Microscopy
Laboratory diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is
made by microscopy. This is based on the dem-
onstration of spherules containing endospores in
(i) sputum or smears from the lesion stained by
calcoﬂuor white and (ii) biopsy material stained
by haematoxylin and eosin, silver or periodic
acid-Schiff stains.
Culture
It is the most deﬁnitive method for diagnosis.
The fungus grows well on Sabouraud dextrose
agar (SDA) and other media producing white
and cottony colonies within 5 days. Identiﬁcation
of colonial morphology is not adequate because
other fungi show similar mycelial forms. There-
fore,
demonstrating
typical
arthroconidia
is
useful for identifying the organism. However,
arthroconidia are infectious, hence posing a sig-
niﬁcant risk to laboratory personnel.
Serology
Serodiagnosis
of
coccidioidomycosis
is
the
most frequent means of diagnosing primary
coccidioidal infections because the patients may
not be able to produce sputum, and fungal
cultures often are not practical. Serodiagnosis is
based on the demonstration of antibodies to
coccidioidal antigens in patient’s serum. A nega-
tive serologic test result never excludes the pres-
ence
of
a
coccidioidal
infection.
However,
performing one or more repeated serologic tests
over 2 months increases the sensitivity of sero-
logic diagnosis, especially for recently acquired
infections. The two major antigens used to detect
antibodies are the tube-precipitating antigen and
the complement-ﬁxation antigen. Enzyme immu-
noassay (EIA) is the most frequently used test to
detect serum tube-precipitating antibodies that are
IgM antibodies to mycelial phase antigens. These
IgM antibodies appear in more than 85% of
patients with primary infection and are found
within the ﬁrst week after the onset of symptoms.
In most patients, these antibodies disappear
within 6 months. IgG antibodies detected by com-
plement ﬁxation appear later, resulting to be pos-
itive in 85–90% of patients.
Skin Test
A skin test using coccidioidal antigens is used
for the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis. It is
a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that
appears 2–21 days after the onset of symptoms

and
precedes
the
appearance
of
serologic
markers. The skin test has epidemiologic and
prognostic
implications.
The
absence
of
delayed-type hypersensitivity indicates a poor
prognosis. However, the skin test shows very
less sensitivity and speciﬁcity in endemic areas.
Because of this, it has a very minimal role to play
in diagnostics. A negative skin test can be seen in
infected individuals due to the absence of
immune response, and a positive skin test can be
seen in healthy individuals due to the earlier
infection.
Paracoccidioidomycosis
975
Molecular Detection
DNA probe is a recent method used for accurate
identiﬁcation of the fungus.
Treatment
Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for the
treatment of the condition. Fluconazole can be
used to treat mild-to-moderate disease and, occa-
sionally, for the treatment of life-threatening dis-
ease in patients in whom amphotericin B is
contraindicated. It is used as the drug of choice
for long-term therapy of meningeal infection.
Epidemiology and Prevention
C. immitis has a distribution restricted primarily
to
areas
of
the
Western
Hemisphere.
The
southern-central part of California (San Joaquin
Valley), Arizona, southern New Mexico, western
Texas and northern Mexico are the areas of
highest endemicity.
As the conidia of the C. immitis are mainly
present in the soil and dispersed in high concen-
tration
during
a
dust
storm,
susceptible
individuals
in
endemic
regions
and
even
non-susceptible
individuals
from
the
non-endemic area should strictly avoid exposing
and inhaling the conidia during storms. All
measures to decrease the inhalation of the spores,
such as using an effective mask ﬁltering the air
inside the residence during the storm, help reduce
the acquisition of the infection by this agent.
Avoiding activities such as gardening and agri-
culture also reduces the chance of infection.
Paracoccidioidomycosis
Paracoccidioidomycosis, also known as South
American blastomycosis and Lutz-Splendore-
Almeida disease, is a chronic progressive sys-
temic
mycosis
caused
by
Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a thermally dimor-
phic fungus found in the soil. It occurs as a mould
in the soil and as yeast in tissue.
The Fungus
These yeasts are unique in that one large mother
cell produces multiple blastoconidia (daughter
cells) that arise from multiple sites, resembling a
‘Mickey Mouse head’ or a ‘pilot wheel’. This
characteristic appearance helps differentiate this
yeast in the tissues of secretion from Blastomyces
dermatitidis and all other yeasts.
Pathogenesis of Paracoccidiomycosis
Infection occurs by inhalation of conidia or myce-
lial fragments. The lungs are the primary site of
infection. The fungus then disseminates to other
organs through the venous and lymphatic systems
from this site. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is
the most important defence mechanism in an
immunocompetent host.
Clinical Syndromes
Most initial infections are subclinical. The overt
disease has two main clinical presentations, a
chronic adult form where the course of the disease
is long term, and the outcome is better with
appropriate therapy, and the juvenile form,

which is an acute or subacute more severe disease
and carries a worse prognosis.
976
67
Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Hallmarks of the chronic adult type of
the disease are signiﬁcant lung involvement
and extrapulmonary lesions, while the juvenile
type is characterised by marked involvement
of the reticuloendothelial system with hypertro-
phy of various lymph node chains and liver
and spleen enlargement; respiratory complaints
are minimal. Cutaneous and mucosal involve-
ment with inﬁltrated, ulcerated, and painful skin
lesions usually occurs in the head and neck
region.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis depends on the demonstra-
tion
of
large,
multiple
budding
yeasts
(blastoconidia) in 10–30% KOH wet mount prep-
aration of sputum. Gomori methenamine silver
(GMS) staining of biopsy specimens shows
yeast cells measuring 2–30 μm in diameter.
Tissue reactions are diffuse in the juvenile form,
while granuloma formation is typical in the adult
form. The organism is isolated by culture on SDA
at 37 C after 20–30 days. Direct fungal DNA
detection in exudates and tissue samples by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) assay has been
reported to be helpful.
Serodiagnosis depends on the demonstration
of P. brasiliensis antibodies or antigens in the
serum.
Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA) is used to detect antibodies to gp43, the
main antigenic determinant of P. brasiliensis,
with a reported sensitivity of 95% and a speciﬁc-
ity of 93%. The test shows cross-reactivity
with sera from patients of histoplasmosis or
lobomycosis. Western blot detects circulating
antibodies to gp43 in the serum in 100% of
patients and to gp70, another antigen of the fun-
gus, in 96% of patients. Newly developed test can
detects aAg7, antigen after 1 week of growth.
This diagnostic method has sensitivity and speci-
ﬁcity of 84% and 99%, respectively. It is mainly
useful in monitoring the patient’s response to
drugs and to ﬁnd out recurrence. However, skin
tests are rarely helpful.
Treatment
Paracoccidioidomycosis is the only endemic
mycosis amenable to treatment with sulpha
drugs. Itraconazole is the drug of choice for
treating paracoccidioidomycosis and is effective
in 95% of patients. Imidazole is also an effective
agent with an 85–90% cure rate. Amphotericin B
is used as a reserve for treating severe cases that
are refractory to treatment with these drugs.
Epidemiology and Prevention
Paracoccidioidomycosis has a restricted geo-
graphical distribution. It is found in South and
Central America. The highest incidence is in the
southeast
province
of
Brazil,
followed
by
Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina.
P. brasiliensis causes natural infection only in
armadillos.
Bats
and
saguis
may
serve
as
reservoirs.
The infection is transmitted by inhalation of
conidia or mycelial fragments that are found in
the soil. Direct inoculation of conidia or mycelial
fragments onto the skin tissue or oral mucous
membrane is uncommon. Nevertheless, it has
been observed in rural Brazil because of the use
of twigs to clean teeth, which is a very common
practice in those regions.
Prevention and Control
P. brasiliensis is known to be present in the soil,
especially near armadillo’s burrows. Preventing
inhalation of these fungal forms is difﬁcult. How-
ever, visitors from non-endemic areas should take
precautions, such as using an appropriate mask to
avoid inhalation during a visit to the endemic
areas.
Histoplasmosis
Histoplasmosis is primarily a disease of the retic-
uloendothelial system caused by an intracellular
fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. H. capsulatum

is a dimorphic fungus, which occurs in two
stages: as a mould in soil and as a yeast at body
temperature in mammals. On SDA medium at
37 C, this fungus produces cottony mycelial
growth.
Histoplasmosis
977
The Fungus
The colony is characterised by thin, branching
septate
hyphae
that
produce
tuberculate
macroconidia
and
microconidia.
The
macroconidia are thick-walled, spherical spores
measuring 8–20 μm in diameter and have ﬁnger-
like projections. These are the diagnostic forms of
fungus.
The
microconidia
are
smaller
and
thin-walled spores and are the infectious form of
the fungus.
The parasitic or tissue phase of the fungus is a
yeast that measures 2–4 μm in diameter. It is
exclusively found within macrophages in the
infected host.
Pathogenesis of Histoplasmosis
H. capsulatum infection is acquired by inhalation
of
conidia
and
mycelial
fragments
from
contaminated soil. Once inhaled, it is deposited
in the lung’s alveoli, and transformation from the
mycelial to the pathogenic yeast form occurs
intracellularly inside the macrophages. The yeast
inside the macrophages multiplies in approxi-
mately 15–18 h. Multiplication continues within
the phagosomes despite fusion with lysosomes.
This is possibly due to the production of certain
proteins by yeasts that inhibit the activity of lyso-
somal proteases.
Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a key host
defence
component
against
the
fungus.
T
lymphocytes are crucial in limiting the extent of
infection.
In
persons
with
impaired
CMI,
Histoplasma species that remained latent in
healed granulomas may be reactivated, resulting
in histoplasmosis.
Clinical Syndromes
Most infected individuals are asymptomatic.
Nevertheless, H. capsulatum causes acute pulmo-
nary histoplasmosis, chronic pulmonary histo-
plasmosis
and
progressive
disseminated
histoplasmosis.
The majority of patients with acute pulmo-
nary histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. The
incubation period varies from 3 to 14 days.
Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal
pain and chills are common symptoms. Cough,
haemoptysis, dyspnoea and/or chest pain may be
present. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis is
seen in patients with underlying pulmonary dis-
ease. Cough, weight loss, fevers and malaise are
symptoms. Progressive disseminated histoplas-
mosis is seen in immunocompromised patients,
such as patients with AIDS. Cases of isolated
adrenal histoplasmosis and mucocutaneous form
(especially oral) are reported mainly from India.
Adrenal histoplasmosis many of the times mimics
carcinomas. Hence, it is essential to speciﬁcally
investigate Histoplasma when isolated adrenal
mass is detected (unilateral or bilateral) in a
patient.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis depends on the demonstra-
tion of oval yeast cells within macrophages in
bone
marrow
aspirates
and
tissue
biopsy
specimens (Fig. 67.1). Biopsy of oropharyngeal
ulcers is usually diagnostic. The sputum and
blood culture on SDA at 25 C show hyphae
with tuberculoid macroconidia and at 37
C
show yeasts (Fig. 67.2). It generally grows as a
mould at 25 C, and for conﬁrmation of the iden-
tiﬁcation, this mould needs to be converted to
yeast forms using special media incubated at
37
C. A tissue biopsy smear stained by
haematoxylin and eosin may show the presence
of yeast forms in tissue. Yeast may be detected in
areas of caseation necrosis and calciﬁed lymph

nodes by using Grocott–Gomori methenamine
silver stain. Yeast forms are rarely seen in stained
peripheral blood smears.

Sputum culture is positive in approximately
10–15% of patients with acute pulmonary histo-
plasmosis and 60% of patients with chronic pul-
monary histoplasmosis.
Complement ﬁxation test (CFT) and immuno-
diffusion (ID) are useful serological tests for
demonstrating speciﬁc antibodies in serum. The
CFT titre greater than 1:8 is considered positive.
A titre of 1:32 or more suggests active histoplas-
mosis.
Cross-reactivity
with
antigens
from
B. dermatitidis and C. immitis is a noted problem
that may lead to a false-positive reaction. The ID
test detects antibodies to two glycoproteins, H
and M, of H. capsulatum. Anti-H antibody is
more
speciﬁc
for
active
histoplasmosis,
is

n
positive in 50–80% of patients and remains
elevated
for
years.
Detection
of
speciﬁc
H. capsulatum antigen in serum and urine is use-
ful in immunocompromised hosts when antibody
production may be impaired. They are usually
positive in case of acute progressive disseminated
histoplasmosis.
Blastomycosis
979
Histoplasmin skin test detects a delayed-type
hypersensitivity to histoplasmal antigens that
occur 3–6 weeks after exposure. A positive
skin test indicates a past or present infection
but does not differentiate between active and
past infections. It is positive in approximately
85–90% of immunocompetent individuals. DNA
probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are
also used to diagnose the condition.
Treatment
Liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice
to treat disseminated disease. Fluconazole is
often recommended for meningitis due to its bet-
ter penetration of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).
Itraconazole is used to treat mild-to-moderate
disease
and
cutaneous
and
mucocutaneous
forms. Asymptomatic or mild conditions need
no treatment.
Epidemiology and Prevention
H. capsulatum is predominantly found in river
valleys in North and Central America. It is
endemic in the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi
River valleys of the United States.
In
endemic
areas,
the
soil
provides
an
acidic, damp environment with high organic
content, favouring fungal mycelia growth. Bats
play an important role in the transmission of
the disease. They can become infected, and
they transmit the fungus through their droppings.
The soil contaminated with birds’ excretions
and droppings of bats remains highly infectious
for years. Moreover, human infection occurs
following
inhalation
of
spores
from
contaminated soil.
Prevention and Control
Preventing the inhalation of the microconidia
of the H. capsulatum is difﬁcult. Susceptible
individuals residing or visiting endemic areas of
this disease should avoid the activities such as
disturbing the soil or the wood where the bat
droppings are present to prevent this infection.
Explorative activities such as visiting the caves
pose a major risk and hence should be avoided. In
addition, simple measures such as cleaning
chicken coops and cleaning or demolishing the
old buildings in which bats thrive may also help
reduce acquiring this infection.
Blastomycosis
Blastomycosis is a granulomatous fungal infec-
tion caused by B. dermatitidis.
The Fungus
B. dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that occurs
in two stages: mould in soil and yeast in tissue.
On culture at 37 C and tissue, the yeast is a round
structure with a double-refractile wall and a single
broad-based bud (Fig. 67.3). This appearance
helps differentiate it from the Cryptococcus
neoformans or H. capsulatum, which has a
narrow-based bud. On culture at 25 C, the fun-
gus produces a mycelial growth showing typical
pyriform microconidia, measuring 2–4 μm i
diameter.
Pathogenesis of Blastomycosis
B. dermatitidis infection occurs by inhaling
microconidia found in soil, its natural habitat.
The conidia are transformed to the yeast phase
at body temperature inside the lungs. It is resistant
to phagocytosis due to its thick cell wall, and it
also stimulates Blastomyces adhesin 1 (BAD1)
expression, which is an immune-modulatory vir-
ulence factor lying on the cell wall. Furthermore,

the yeast replicates and may spread through the
blood and lymphatics to other organs.

Clinical Syndromes
Pulmonary Infection
It is the major clinical manifestation. A ﬂulike
illness with fever, chills, myalgia, headache and
a
non-productive
cough
may
occur,
which
resolves within days. In some cases, it may
develop into a progressive pulmonary disease or
result in extrapulmonary dissemination. Patients
with chronic pulmonary illness and immunocom-
promised
individuals
are
more
prone
to
extrapulmonary dissemination involving other
organs.
Extrapulmonary Infection
It is most common during the chronic form of
illness.
Skin
involvement
with
prominent
pseudoepitheliomatous
hyperplasia is present
with micro-abscess formation that may mimic
squamous cell carcinoma. Skeletal blastomycosis
manifesting as osteomyelitis and septic arthritis
can also occur. In men, genitourinary tract
involvement, primarily in the prostate and epidid-
ymis, is also reported. Rarely, CNS disease may
occur.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Sputum or Broncho-Alveolar Lavage (BAL)
Microscopy
It is a very useful test for demonstrating charac-
teristic
broad-based
budding
yeasts
of
B. dermatitidis. KOH wet mount of pus aspirated
from skin micro-abscesses, ﬁstulae or subcutane-
ous abscesses is useful to demonstrate the yeast.
Sputum or BAL culture on SDA medium
conﬁrms the diagnosis of the condition. However,
it may take as early as 5 days or as late as 30 days
for colony formation.
In the histological examination, the presence of
pyogranulomas should alert one to the possibility
of blastomycosis. Yeast forms can be difﬁcult to
visualise with routine haematoxylin and eosin
stains, and special stains like Gomori methenamine
silver stain should be used for screening tissue.
Serology
It is useful. ELISA is a useful test to detect
antibodies against an antigen of B. dermatitidis
in the patient’s serum. A titre of greater than 1:32
is suggestive of the condition. Radioimmunoas-
say (RIA) and Western blot techniques are the
newer tests that use more speciﬁc cell wall
antigens of B. dermatitidis to detect antibodies
in the serum.

Candidiasis
981
Molecular Detection
Molecular detection of B. dermatitidis in culture
has been accomplished but is used primarily to
supplement traditional methods. Skin tests are not
reliable for diagnosis.
Treatment
Amphotericin B and itraconazole are the drugs
of choice to treat blastomycosis. However,
itraconazole and ﬂuconazole are now considered
effective
alternatives
for
immunocompetent
patients with mild-to-moderate disease.
Epidemiology and Prevention
Blastomycosis is documented in the United States
and from Canada and the African continent. In
endemic areas, blastomycosis is a common infec-
tion among dogs. It is also reported in horses,
cows, cats, bats and lions. Microconidia are the
infective stages that are present in the soil. Infec-
tion is transmitted to humans through inhalation
of aerosolised conidia. Middle-aged men with
outdoor occupations that exposed them to soil
are at the greatest risk for blastomycosis. Recrea-
tional activities in wooded areas along waterways
have been identiﬁed as the major risk factor in
outbreak settings.
Preventing
inhalation
of
B.
dermatitidis
conidia is difﬁcult. However, individuals who
are
immunosuppressed
and
residing
in
the
endemic areas should avoid soil-disturbing and
recreational activities in wooded areas.
Case Study
A 32-year-old lady with AIDS was admitted to
a hospital with fever and other non-speciﬁc
symptoms. Examination of her tongue revealed
a white, thick patch. HIV serology was positive.
Microscopy of the scrapings collected from the
patch showed Gram-positive yeast. Her CD4
count was 200 cells/μL of blood.

Opportunistic Fungal Infections
The opportunistic fungi usually cause infections
in persons with impaired host defence but do not
cause disease in most immunocompetent hosts.
Since
these
fungi
become
pathogens
in
individuals with impaired immunity by taking
advantage of the host’s debilitated conditions,
they are called opportunistic fungi.
In recent times, there has been an increasing
list of exotic and rare fungi, which have been
associated with causing opportunistic infections.
However,
most
opportunistic
infections
are
caused
by
Candida
spp.,
Aspergillus
spp.,
Mucorales,
Cryptococcus
and
Talaromyces
marneffei
(previously
known
as
Penicillium
marneffei) (Table 67.1).
Candidiasis
Candida species are the most common fungal
pathogens that affect humans. The genus Candida
includes more than 100 species, of which few
cause disease in humans. Candida albicans was
the most frequent cause of infection, which has
been
taken
over
by
non-albicans
Candida
worldwide.
C. albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida
glabrata, Candida parapsilosis and Candida
krusei are the ﬁve most common species, which
cause opportunistic infections among immuno-
compromised hosts. Multidrug-resistant species
Candida auris, which was ﬁrst isolated in 2009
from Japan, has now been reported from more
than 35 countries, causing serious concern.

The Fungus
Candida species is a general ovoid or spherical
budding yeast with or without pseudohyphae.
These form part of the normal ﬂora of the mucous
membrane of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary
and respiratory tract. Candida generally produces
pseudohyphae
in
the
cultures
and
tissues.
Pseudohyphae are elongated yeast that may resem-
ble hyphae morphologically but are not true
hyphae. It grows readily on Sabouraud dextrose
agar (SDA) and bacteriological culture media.
C. albicans produces smooth, creamy white
colonies
with
a
yeasty
odour.
It
can
be
differentiated from other Candida species by car-
bohydrate fermentation reaction and characteris-
tic growth on cornmeal agar (CMA). Only
C. albicans and Candida dubliniensis produce
chlamydospores on cornmeal agar culture at
25 C. Germ tube test is another screening test
used
to
differentiate
C.
albicans
from
non-albicans yeast.
Pathogenesis of Candida Infection
In a susceptible host, Candida gains access to
systemic circulation from the oropharynx of
the gastrointestinal tract. The colonisation of the
mucocutaneous surface is the ﬁrst stage in the
pathogenesis of Candida infection. The fungus
causes invasion in human tissue through different
routes. Disruption of the skin or mucosa allows
the organism access to the bloodstream. Massive
colonisation with large numbers of Candida also
permits the organism to pass directly into the
bloodstream, causing the infection.
Candida may disseminate to many organs in
immunocompromised hosts, such as the lung,
spleen, liver, heart, kidney and brain. Candida
may induce inﬂammation of the eye, causing
endophthalmitis,
and
may
involve
skin
in
10–30% of patients with disseminated infection.
Deﬁciency in host defence mechanisms plays a
signiﬁcant role in developing Candida infection.
Clinical Syndromes
Candida causes a wide spectrum of clinical
illnesses in humans.
Cutaneous Candidiasis
Candida species in an immunocompetent host
can cause infection of any warm and moist part
of the body exposed to the environment. It causes
infection of the nail (paronychia—infection of the
nail fold and white superﬁcial onychomycosis)
and other skin folds (Candida intertrigo—affects
groin or axilla often due to excessive sweating
and diaper rash).
Mucocutaneous Candidiasis
Oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, perianal disease,
etc. are the commonest manifestations of muco-
cutaneous candidiasis but do not cause any mor-
tality.
In
immunocompromised
individuals,
mostly in HIV infection, Candida species can
cause extreme oropharyngeal and oesophageal
candidiasis (AIDS-deﬁning illness).

Candidiasis
983
Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis
These are the different clusters of clinical
syndromes mainly indicated by superﬁcial Can-
dida infection of the skin, nails and oropharynx
with the chronic presentation, and generally, they
are refractory to the routine antifungal therapy.
Nevertheless, it does not show any evidence of
disseminated candidiasis.
Systemic Candidiasis
This involves candidiasis of the respiratory tract,
gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, liver,
spleen and heart (endocarditis). It also includes
candidemia
and
disseminated
candidiasis.
Among HIV patients, oral thrush and candidial
oesophagitis are the commonest presentations
compared to candidemia or disseminated candidi-
asis. Central nervous system candidiasis may
present with scattered brain microabscesses or
larger lesions, vasculitis or thrombosis.
Increased incidence of disseminated candidia-
sis is commonly seen in patients on long-term
immunosuppressive
drugs
for
serious
haematological malignancies. Marked neutrope-
nia in these patients is the main reason Candida
spreads through the blood to most of the organs
leading to disseminated candidiasis. Patients usu-
ally present with the clinical features of sepsis.
Hepatosplenic candidiasis is another form of
disseminated candidiasis that occurs in severe
neutropenia patients. Most candidemia cases are
being reported in critically ill patients admitted to
the intensive care units. Long stay in the hospital,
central line, long course of multiple antibiotics,
burns and abdominal surgery are the important
risks of acquiring candidemia in critically ill
patients.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
These include exudates or tissues for microscopy
obtained from skin or nails examined by micro-
scope for demonstration of pseudohyphae or bud-
ding yeast cells of Candida. Blood collected in
the blood culture bottle is one of the key samples
for detecting candidemia.
Microscopy
Gram-stained smear of the exudates or tissue
shows Gram-positive, oval, budding yeast and
pseudohyphae (Fig. 67.4). It is preferred to per-
form the KOH-calcoﬂuor wet mount preparation
and examine under a ﬂuorescent microscope to
increase the chance of detecting yeasts and

moulds. Since Candida is found as a part of
normal ﬂora on normal skin or mucosa, interpre-
tation should be made in conjunction with clinical
presentation. Tissue invasion is of more diagnos-
tic value.

Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Culture
Aspirates, exudates and tissues are inoculated on
the SDA slants and incubated at 37 and 25 C for
up to 4 weeks with regular inspection for
colonies. For diagnosis of candidemia, at least
8–10 ml (in adults) of peripheral blood should
be collected, taking strict aseptic precaution. The
bottles will be incubated for up to 4 weeks with
frequent subculture onto SDA plates to recover
Candida
species.
Any
number
of
colonies
isolated from blood culture is considered signiﬁ-
cant and warrants antifungal therapy. Culture on
SDA produces typical creamy white, smooth
colonies (Fig. 67.5). Different Candida species
are identiﬁed by their growth characteristics,
sugar fermentation and assimilation tests. Germ
tube test is a rapid method for identifying
C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. This test depends
on the ability of C. albicans to produce germ tube
within 2 h when incubated in human serum at
37 C. This phenomenon is called Reynolds–
Braude phenomenon (Fig. 67.6). Terminal
chlamydospores
are
typically
produced
by
C. albicans (mostly single) and C. dubliniensis
(in bunches) on cornmeal agar at 25 C, but not
by other Candida species.

albicans (Courtesy of Prof.
S. Pramodhini)
Moreover, CHROM agar allows for the pre-
sumptive identiﬁcation of several Candida spe-
cies by using colour reaction in specialised media,
thereby showing different colours of the colonies
depending on the Candida species. Different
Candida species can also be identiﬁed with
more accuracy by automated biochemical assays,
such as AP120C, Vitek and AP131C. These
assays evaluate the assimilation of various sugars
to identify different fungal species.
Non-culture Candida Detection
These
include
(a)
1,3-beta-D-glucan
assay,
(b) Candida mannan antigen and/or antibody
assay, (c) C. albicans germ tube antibody
(CAGTA) assay and (d) d-arabinitol assay.

Beta-D-glucan assay is a broad-spectrum test that
detects Candida and Aspergillus, Fusarium,
Acremonium, Pneumocystis and Saccharomyces
species. This test depends on the principle that
beta-d-glucan is a component of the cell wall of
these fungi, which can be detected by its ability to
activate factor G during the coagulation cascade
of amoebocyte lysate of the horseshoe crab. This
test is highly speciﬁc and sensitive in diagnosing
invasive candidiasis.
Candidiasis

With the advent of MADLI-TOF, yeast identi-
ﬁcation can be made within 2–3 h. Worldwide,
this has become the main tool in identiﬁcation. In
addition, many advanced laboratories use DNA
sequencing, which is now considered the gold
standard in identifying yeasts and bacteria.
Serology
Antibody-based
tests
are
not
useful
for
diagnosing invasive candidiasis as Candida is a
commensal yeast, and antibodies are noted in the
sera of the assay of healthy individuals. As men-
tioned above, only antibodies against the mannan
antigen can help diagnose at least 50% of invasive
candidiasis.
Skin Test
A skin test with Candida antigen is a delayed
hypersensitivity skin test, which is used as an
indicator of functions of the CMI. The skin test
is uniformly positive in immunocompetent adults
and indicates that the person has intact CMI. The
skin test is negative in individuals who have
deﬁcient CMI. Such a person is anergic and is
negative to other skin tests, such as puriﬁed pro-
tein derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis.
Molecular Detection
DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
are still under evaluation but appear promising.
T2 Candida is the automated diagnostic platform
used to diagnose candidemia using whole-blood

specimens. In this platform, Candida cells are
lysed by mechanical bead beating, then its DNA
is ampliﬁed by PCR and the ampliﬁed Candida
DNA
is
detected
using
amplicon-induced
agglomeration of supermagnetic particles and T2
magnetic resonance (T2MR). This helps in the
rapid diagnosis of candidemia within 2–3 h after
collecting the blood samples.

Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Treatment
Antifungal therapy forms the mainstay of treat-
ment of the infections caused by Candida.
Echinocandins are the ﬁrst drug of choice for
treating
invasive
candidiasis.
Caspofungin,
anidulafungin and micafungin are echinocandins
that
have
fungicidal
action
against
yeast.
Liposomal amphotericin B is the next drug of
choice.
Azoles such as ﬂuconazole, voriconazole and
posaconazole are other alternatives. Fluconazole
ketoconazole and nystatin can be used for super-
ﬁcial candidiasis. Azole resistance is increasingly
reported with C. glabrata, and C. krusei is intrin-
sically
resistant
to
ﬂuconazole.
Candida
lusitaniae is intrinsically resistant to amphotericin
B but susceptible to azoles and echinocandins.
C. auris is multidrug resistant as it exhibits vari-
able resistance to all the major classes of
antifungals such as azoles (ﬂuconazole >90%,
amphotericin
~40%,
voriconazole
~20%,
echinocandin
~15%).
Hence,
treatment
of
C. auris infection should be done based on the
antifungal susceptibility proﬁle.
Epidemiology and Prevention
Candida
species
are
distributed
worldwide.
C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei
and C. parapsilosis are responsible for causing
the majority (~80%) of invasive candidiasis.
C. tropicalis is an important cause of candidemia
in patients with leukaemias and those who
have undergone bone marrow transplantation.
C. parapsilosis is commonly associated with
invasive devices such as vascular catheters.
Multidrug-resistant C. auris is an emerging
Candida species that can spread from patients or
hospital environments. Once C. auris is isolated
from the hospital setting, it is difﬁcult to eradicate
it.
Candida
utilis
and
Wickerhamomyces
anomalus are opportunistic yeasts especially
reported among paediatric patients.
Antifungal
prophylaxis
is
indicated
for
patients at high risk of developing invasive can-
didiasis. There is no vaccine available against
candidiasis.
Cryptococcosis
Cryptococcosis, also called European blastomy-
cosis, is an acute-to-chronic disease caused by an
encapsulated yeast, C. neoformans. Cryptococco-
sis is the most common life-threatening fungal
disease in patients with AIDS.
Of more than 30 species that comprise the
genus Cryptococcus, human disease is associated
with C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A),
C. neoformans (serotype D) and Cryptococcus
gattii (serotype B/C strains). C. neoformans was
ﬁrst described by Busse, a pathologist, in 1984.
Kwon-Chung (1976) has reported the exact
(i.e.
sexual,
teleomorphic)
structure
of
C.
neoformans,
which
the
author
named
Filobasidiella neoformans. Prior to the documen-
tation
of
F.
neoformans
(mycelial
form),
C. neoformans was regarded as a monomorphic
fungus.
The Fungus
C. neoformans is considered a true yeast as
it does not produce pseudohyphae. It is an oval
and budding yeast and measures 3–6 μm in diam-
eter. The yeast may be single or may have a
single budding daughter cell. Within the host
and in certain culture media, the yeast is
surrounded by a wide polysaccharide capsule.

The polysaccharide capsule is composed of man-
nose, xylose and glucuronic acid. This fungus
forms
a
narrow-based
bud
in
contrast
to
B. dermatitidis, which forms a broad-based bud.
Rarely, long ﬁlamentation may be noted.
Cryptococcosis
987
On culture, C. neoformans on SDA medium
forms smooth, convex, cream-coloured mucoid
colonies at 20–37 C. Lactophenol cotton blue
(LPCB) wet mount of the colony shows budding
yeast cells.
Based on the antigenic speciﬁcity of the
capsular polysaccharide, the species was classi-
ﬁed into four serotypes. At present, based on
molecular phylogeny, these serotypes are classi-
ﬁed into three species Cryptococcus grubii (sero-
type A), C. neoformans (serotype D) and C. gattii
(serotype B/C strains).
Fig. 67.7 Transmission of
Cryptococcus neoformans
Pathogenesis of Cryptococcosis
The
host’s
immune
status
is
the
crucial
factor in the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis.
C. neoformans and C. grubii usually cause the
most serious infections in patients with impaired
CMI. However in addition, C. gattii can cause
infection even in immunocompetent individuals.
Cryptococcus is primarily transmitted by inha-
lation (Fig. 67.7). Following inhalation, the yeasts
are deposited into the pulmonary alveoli, in which
they survive before alveolar macrophages phago-
cytose them. Glucosylceramide synthase has been
identiﬁed as an essential factor in the survival of
Cryptococcus in pulmonary alveoli. Cryptococcal
polysaccharide
capsule
has
antiphagocytic
properties. Hence, unencapsulated yeast is readily

phagocytosed
and
destroyed,
and
then
the
encapsulated organisms are more resistant to
phagocytosis. The capsule is antiphagocytic.
Hence, the phagocyte cannot recognise the
encapsulated
yeast,
thereby
obstructing
the
migration of the leukocyte into the fungal replica-
tion zone.
988
67
Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Both the cellular and humoral responses medi-
ate the host immunity in cryptococcal infection.
CMI is mediated by natural killer cells, and T
lymphocytes can inhibit or kill cryptococci. An
increase in helper T-cell activity, skin test conver-
sion and a reduction in the number of viable
organisms in the tissues indicate a successful
host response against the fungus. Anticryp-
tococcal antibodies and soluble anticryptococcal
factors
mediate
humoral
immunity.
Both
anticryptococcal antibodies and the complement
play a crucial role in facilitating the organism’s
macrophage- and lymphocyte-mediated immune
response.
Clinical Syndromes
Cryptococcus causes a variety of infections in
humans.
Pulmonary Cryptococcosis
The clinical manifestations of pulmonary crypto-
coccosis are widely variable. The pulmonary
disease varies from asymptomatic respiratory
tract colonisation to acute respiratory distress
syndrome affecting immunocompromised hosts.
It depends on the immune status of the host.
CNS Cryptococcosis
Both the brain and meninges are involved in
cryptococcal CNS infections. Meningitis and
meningoencephalitis
are
the
most
common
manifestations. These are usually subacute or
chronic. Without speciﬁc therapy, the infection is
invariably fatal. The patient dies from the disease
2 weeks to several years after the symptom onset.
Disseminated Non-pulmonary and
Non-CNS Cryptococcosis
Disseminated cryptococcosis includes the skin,
prostate and medullary cavity of the bones, next
only to the lungs and CNS, and it occurs most
commonly in patients with AIDS and other
immunosuppressed conditions.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Laboratory diagnosis of cryptococcal infection
is made by demonstrating the yeast in CSF, spu-
tum, pus and brain biopsy tissue by smear and
culture. Gomori methenamine silver or periodic
acid-Schiff stains are used to stain the tissue
specimens
to
demonstrate
the
capsule
of
C. neoformans. Fixed tissue may also be stained
with mucicarmine, which preferentially stains
C. neoformans.
Microscopy
Microscopy by India ink preparation is com-
monly used to detect budding yeast cells in the
CSF. The capsule appears as a clear halo around
the yeast cells (Fig. 67.8). By this method,
cryptococci can be demonstrated in 25–50% of
patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Gram-
stained smear of the CSF shows Gram-positive
yeast cells (Fig. 67.9).
Culture
The
culture
of
centrifuged
CSF
specimens
conﬁrms the diagnosis of the condition. This
fungus is identiﬁed based on its microscopic
appearance, biochemical test results and ability
to
grow
at
37
C
(98.6
F).
Pathogenic
C. neoformans usually grows at 37 C (98.6 F),
assimilates inositol, hydrolyses urea and does not
form mycelia on cornmeal agar. Melanin produc-
tion
is
obvious
when
incubated
on
agar
containing seeds of the common weed Guizotia
abyssinica.

Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Serology
Latex agglutination test (LAT) is a frequently
used serological test to detect cryptococcal poly-
saccharide antigen in the serum or CSF to diag-
nose meningitis. LAT is a highly sensitive test in
the pathogenic diagnosis of Cryptococcus infec-
tion. Recently, antigen detection using lateral
ﬂow has become popular due to ease of testing.
Treatment
The standard treatment constitutes liposomal
amphotericin B at 3–4 mg/kg/day IV plus
ﬂucytosine (100 mg/kg/day orally in four divided
doses) for 2 weeks followed by maintenance
therapy with ﬂuconazole (400 mg daily) for
6–12 months. C. gattii causes severe infections.
Hence, the duration of treatment is for an
extended time period.
The therapeutic goal for patients with crypto-
coccal disease not complicated by HIV infection
is to cure the fungal infection permanently. The
therapeutic goal for patients with concomitant
HIV
infection
without
a
CD4
count
of
greater than 100 cells/μL is to control the acute
infection, followed by lifelong suppression of
C. neoformans.
Epidemiology and Prevention
C. neoformans and C. grubii are distributed
worldwide. The incidence of cryptococcosis
is increasing, and now it represents a major
life-threatening
fungal
infection
in
patients
with AIDS. C. gattii causes disease in immuno-
competent individuals and is known to cause
outbreaks. While C. neoformans and C. grubii
are closely associated with pigeon droppings,
C. gattii is associated with the eucalyptus trees.
Cryptococcus is primarily transmitted by inhala-
tion. Human-to-human transmission does not
occur.
Preventing the inhalation of cryptococci is dif-
ﬁcult. Limited studies have shown that Crypto-
coccus is present in chicken, pigeon and other
birds’ dried bird droppings. Hence, susceptible
individuals, especially those with HIV/AIDS,
should avoid such exposure.
Aspergillosis
More than 100 species of Aspergillus have been
identiﬁed to date. Among these, Aspergillus
fumigatus and Aspergillus ﬂavus are the causative
agents of most human diseases, followed by
Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus terreus.
The Fungus
Aspergillus species are moulds, and they have
septate hyphae that form V-shaped dichotomous
branches (Fig. 67.10). The Aspergillus species are
identiﬁed by (i) their morphological features,
(ii) the pattern of conidiophore development and
(iii) the colour of the conidia.
The presence of septate hyphae that branch at
45-degree angles is the typical feature of Asper-
gillus species hyphae on histopathology. The
hyphae in tissues are best demonstrated with sil-
ver stains. The walls of the hyphae are more or
less parallel, unlike those of Mucorales, which
tends to fold.
Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) preparation
of the colonies shows septate hyphae and
branching
conidiophores.
Asexual
conidia
arranged in chains are present on elongated cells
known as sterigmata. The latter is present on the
vesicle of the conidiophores. The conidia of
Aspergillus typically form radiating chains in
contrast to Rhizopus and Mucor, which are
found within sporangia. The fungus grows rap-
idly on SDA and other culture media at 25 C.
Aspergillus produces colonies within 1–2 days
with different colours based on the species.
Pathogenesis of Aspergillosis
Aspergillus species, unlike Candida species,
do not form part of the normal ﬂora of humans.
They
are
ubiquitous
in
the
environment;

hence,
transmission
of
infection
is
mostly
exogenous.

Aspergillus species rarely cause infections in
immunocompetent individuals. They cause inva-
sive infections, mostly in the patients who are
immunocompromised. In these hosts, Aspergillus
species cause invasion of the blood, thereby caus-
ing infarction, haemorrhage and necrosis of lung
tissues. Aspergillus spp. also produces toxic
metabolites like elastolytic proteases, gliotoxin
and hyaluronic acid that inhibit macrophage and
neutrophil phagocytosis, facilitating the dissemi-
nation of the infection.
The size of the conidia is an important factor
that affects virulence in some aetiologic agents.
The small conidia of A. fumigatus allow accessi-
bility to the lower respiratory tract, making it the
main agent in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
However, A. ﬂavus, with a large conidial size, is
an important etiologic agent in sinusitis, cutane-
ous and wound aspergillosis.
Clinical Syndromes
In immunocompetent hosts, Aspergillus species
may primarily affect the lungs, causing four main
syndromes discussed as follows.
Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis
It is a hypersensitivity reaction to A. fumigatus
organisms, colonised in the tracheobronchial tree.
This condition often occurs in association with
asthma and cystic ﬁbrosis.
Chronic Necrotising Pulmonary
Aspergillosis
It is a subacute infection seen in patients with
some degree of immunosuppression. The condi-
tion occurs in conjunction with alcoholism,
underlying lung disease or chronic corticosteroid
therapy.
Aspergilloma
It is a condition that occurs in a pre-existing
cavity in the lung parenchyma. This cavity may
have been caused earlier by tuberculosis, sarcoid-
osis, cystic ﬁbrosis and emphysematous bullae.
The condition is characterised by the presence of
a ball of fungus within the cavity. The fungus,
however, does not invade the cavity. It may cause
haemoptysis.
Invasive Aspergillosis
It is a rapidly progressive infection in patients
who are severely immunocompromised. The con-
dition is mostly fatal. In an immunocompromised
host, Aspergillus organisms cause a disseminated

disease, leading to endophthalmitis, endocarditis
and abscesses in the viscera, such as liver, spleen,
kidney, soft tissues and bone.
992
67
Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis or
chronic,
necrotising
aspergillus
pneumonia
depends on the demonstration of septate hyphae
in tissue by direct microscopy and isolation of
Aspergillus in culture.
Specimens
Respiratory specimens such as BAL, sputum and
lung biopsy are the main samples for diagnosing
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and other pul-
monary manifestations of aspergillosis. Tissue
exudates or aspirates, or scrapings from other
affected organs, will help diagnose different
forms of aspergillosis.

Direct KOH Preparation
Direct KOH preparation of the specimen shows
non-pigmented, septate hyphae with characteris-
tic dichotomous branching at an angle of 45.
Biopsy
specimens
show
septate,
branching
hyphae invading the tissues.
Culture
It is carried out by inoculation of specimens
on SDA without cycloheximide and is incubated
at 25
C for 1–2 days. Different Aspergillus
species produce colonies of various colours.
A. fumigatus (Fig. 67.10) produces grey colonies,
whereas A. niger (Fig. 67.11) and A. ﬂavus
(Fig. 67.12) produce black and yellowish-green
colonies, respectively. The isolation of Aspergil-
lus by culture needs to be interpreted with care
because
they
are
also
common
laboratory
contaminants. Repeated isolation of the fungi
may help suggest the pathogenic role of the
Aspergillus.

Serology
Serology
is
by
estimation
of
serum
galactomannan is useful for diagnosing invasive
aspergillosis.
Demonstration
of
elevated
galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage and
blood is also useful for diagnosing invasive pul-
monary aspergillosis. Highly increased levels of
serum IgE (>1000 IU/cm3) and positive serology
for Aspergillus precipitation or Aspergillus-spe-
ciﬁc IgG or IgE antibodies are suggestive of the
allergic form of aspergillosis. Serum IgG levels
are usually positive in aspergilloma.
The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis can also be established by a positive
skin test for A. fumigatus.
Treatment
Voriconazole is the recommended drug for the
treatment
of
invasive
aspergillosis,
whereas
itraconazole is given for ABPA/CPA patients.
Liposomal amphotericin B is an alternative drug
given to patients. Aspergilloma is treated best by
removing the fungus ball from the cavity by
surgery.
Epidemiology and Prevention
Various clinical manifestations of Aspergillus
infection have been documented worldwide. As
this agent has ubiquitous distribution, there are no
speciﬁc preventive measures available against
aspergillosis.
Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis)
Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, is an
infection caused by saprophytic moulds belong-
ing to Mucorales such as Mucor spp. (Fig. 67.13),
Rhizopus spp. (Fig. 67.14) and Absidia spp.
These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment
and generally saprophytic. They are the third
most common fungal infection in immunocom-
promised individuals.
The Fungus
Rhizopus species are the most common causative
agents of mucormycosis in humans. Of many
Rhizopus species, Rhizopus arrhizus is the most

common agent of mucormycosis. The hyphae of
the Mucorales are generally characteristically
aseptate (absence of septa), but occasionally few
septa may be noted (pauciseptate). The growth of
the Mucorales appears typically cottony. For
example, R. arrhizus typically have a salt-and-
pepper appearance. The genus and species can
be differentiated based on the size, shape of
sporangia and sporangiospores, branching or
non-branching of sporangiophores, presence or
absence of rhizoids and their origin (nodal or
internodal), etc.

Pathogenesis of Mucormycosis
Mucorales have a high degree of predilection to
invade major blood vessels, leading to ischaemia,
necrosis
and
infarction
of
adjacent
tissues.
Uncontrolled diabetes is one of the commonest
risk factors for acquiring mucormycosis. They
also affect patients with metabolic acidosis sec-
ondary to renal insufﬁciency, diarrhoea and aspi-
rin intake. Most of the infections caused by
Mucorales are acute and are usually fatal despite

early diagnosis and treatment. The agents of
mucormycosis are transmitted by air through
their asexual spores. Recently, a large outbreak
of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis led to
declaring this disease as a notiﬁable disease in
India.
Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis)
995
Clinical Syndromes
Mucorales cause a spectrum of diseases in
humans depending on the host’s immune status
and the portal of entry. These cause rhino-
orbitocerebral
mucormycosis,
pulmonary
mucormycosis
and
gastrointestinal
mucormycosis.
Rhino-orbitocerebral
mucormycosis is the most common manifestation
of disease seen in patients with diabetic acidosis.
Cutaneous or subcutaneous mucormycosis occurs
after trauma and spreads very rapidly if not
treated.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis of mucormycosis is frequently
difﬁcult. It requires a high degree of suspicion
and a host with appropriate risk factors. Labora-
tory diagnosis is by microscopy, culture and
histopathology.
Microscopy
It depends on demonstrating the characteristic
appearance of broad, non-septate hyphae with
right-angled branches in the specimen. KOH
mount
of
tissue
material
exhibits
broad,
irregularly set hyphae with right-angled branches.
Culture
Culture on SDA medium without antibiotics is
dense and cottony. The LPCB preparation of the
colony shows the coenocytic nature of the hyphae
and the characteristic sporangia that contain
sporangiophores. Fungal cultures are negative in
about 30% of cases. The fungi are difﬁcult to
culture because they are fragile due to thin cell
walls, and individual cells are long (due to the
absence of septa or having rare septa) and can get
damaged easily, losing their viability. Blood
cultures are of no value.
Histopathology
Histopathology of affected tissue is very useful to
conﬁrm the diagnosis. A fungal stain of biopsy
material
obtained
from
the
affected
tissue
showing non-septate hyphae with broad, irregular
branches that form more or less at right angles
suggests the diagnosis.
Serology
No serological tests are available.
Treatment
Liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice
for mucormycosis. Posaconazole is also given to
patients with acute renal failure and who cannot
tolerate amphotericin B. Surgical removal of
necrotic, infected tissues should be done if
possible.
Epidemiology and Prevention
The agents of mucormycosis are transmitted by
air through their asexual spores.
Mucormycosis is reported globally, although
more reports are seen from tropical and subtropi-
cal regions. The main burden of mucormycosis is
seen among individuals with uncontrolled diabe-
tes and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, patients
with haematological malignancies, those who
have undergone haematopoietic or solid-organ
transplants, those on voriconazole therapy and
iron chelation therapy, those with malnutrition
and trauma (like a road trafﬁc accident or
burns), or those on immunosuppressants are
at risk of developing mucormycosis. Recently,
a
large
outbreak
of
COVID-19-associated
mucormycosis led to declaring this as a notiﬁable
disease in India, particularly among those receiv-
ing unsupervised or inappropriate corticosteroid
therapy.
The
clinical
presentations
of
mucormycosis are classiﬁed based on the ana-
tomic localisation, such as rhino-orbital-cerebral

(ROCM), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous,
renal and disseminated mucormycosis. Globally,
R.
arrhizus
is
the
commonest
cause
of
mucormycosis,
followed
by
Lichtheimia
(Fig. 67.15) and Cunninghamella (Fig. 67.16)
species. In India, Apophysomyces spp. is the sec-
ond most common agent, infection due to Rhizo-
pus microsporus, and Rhizopus homothallicus are
also rising.

Prevention and Control
Though no speciﬁc preventive measures are
described for mucormycosis, some small steps
may
reduce
the
chance
of
acquiring
mucormycosis:
•
Those suffering from diabetes mellitus should
regularly monitor the sugar level and maintain
the sugar level.

Pneumocystosis
997
•
Avoid areas such as construction or excavation
sites to reduce inhalation of Mucorales spores.
If not possible, at least wear a mask while
working in those areas.
•
Wash the wound with soap and clean water
after injury, especially when the wound is
contaminated with soil or dirt.
Pneumocystosis
Pneumocystis jiroveci, previously known as
Pneumocystis carinii, is the causative agent of
pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). PCP is the
most
common
opportunistic
infection
in
HIV-infected patients.
Pneumocystis is a unicellular fungus found in
the respiratory tracts of many mammals and
humans. The genus Pneumocystis was initially
mistaken for trypanosome, and later as a protozoan.
Biochemical analysis of the nucleic acid composi-
tion of Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial
DNA in the 1980s established it as a fungus. The
cyst wall closely resembles that of fungi. However,
it does not have ergosterol in its membrane as do
the fungi but instead has cholesterol.
The Fungus
The organism presents in three morphological
forms. Trophozoite or trophic stage presents com-
monly as clusters. The sporozoite comprises
precystic
forms.
The
cyst
comprises
many
intracystic bodies called spores.
Pathogenesis of Pneumocystosis
Transmission of infection occurs by inhalation.
Once inhaled, the tropic form of the organism
attaches to the alveoli. Defects in both cellular
immunity and humoral immunity allow for
uncontrolled replication of the organism and
development of the disease. Activated alveolar
macrophages without CD4+ cells fail to eradicate
the organism.
Clinical Syndromes
P. jiroveci causes PCP in HIV patients with
their CD4+ cell count below 200 cells/μL.
It also causes PCP in other patients with
primary
immune
deﬁciencies,
including
hypogammaglobulinemia and severe combined
immunodeﬁciency, an organ (e.g. heart, lung,
liver, kidney)-transplant recipient’s on long-term
immunosuppressive regimens and in patients
with
haematologic
and
non-haematologic
malignancies. P. jirovecii is also seen as a
coloniser in the respiratory tract.
In symptomatic cases, sudden onset of fever,
non-productive cough, dyspnoea and tachypnoea
are typical manifestations. Bilateral rales and
rhonchi are present. On different radiological
investigations, it presents classically as interstitial
pneumonia. Extra-pulmonary manifestations are
rare. It occurs in AIDS patients during their
advanced stage.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Chest radiographs in most patients show diffuse
bilateral inﬁltrates extending from the perihilar
region.
Patchy
asymmetric
inﬁltrates
and
pneumatoceles are less common ﬁndings.
Unlike other fungi, P. jiroveci cannot be
cultured in any media used for fungal culture.
Sputum induced by inhalation of a hypertonic
saline solution is a useful specimen for demon-
stration
of
the
organism
by
microscopy.
Pneumocystis is less frequently demonstrated in
expectorated sputum. Bronchoalveolar lavage is
the most common invasive procedure used to
diagnose PCP. This is recommended when PCP
is strongly suspected, but the induced sputum
sample is repeatedly negative. Bronchoalveolar
lavage has a high sensitivity of more than 90%.
Wright, Cresyl violet and Giemsa stains are
taken up by both trophozoite and cyst forms but
do not stain the cyst wall. Toluidine blue and
Gomori methenamine silver stain only the wall
of Pneumocystis cysts. Papanicolaou stain is valu-
able in detecting the foamy eosinophilic material

present around the P. jirovecii. Direct immuno-
ﬂuorescence using monoclonal antibodies is a
more sensitive method than histologic techniques
for detecting Pneumocystis in histopathologic
specimens.

Systemic Mycoses and Opportunistic Infections
Open lung biopsy has 100% sensitivity and
speciﬁcity
because
it
provides
the
greatest
amount of tissue for diagnosis. This is an invasive
procedure and hence reserved for rare cases when
bronchoscopy is non-diagnostic. Presently, diag-
nosis of PCP is made by real-time PCR as it can
differentiate colonisation from infection.
Treatment
P. jiroveci, although considered a fungus, does
not respond to treatment with antifungal agents. A
combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxa-
zole is the drug of choice for the treatment of
PCP. Pentamidine and atovaquone are alternative
drugs.
Epidemiology and Prevention
Pneumocystosis was ﬁrst noticed when it pro-
duced interstitial pneumonia among severely mal-
nourished and premature infants in parts of
Central and Eastern Europe during the World
War II. Prior to 1981, there were only a few
reports
(less
than
100)
from
the
United
States. However, in 1981, the CDC in the United
States reported the occurrence of PCP in ﬁve
healthy
homosexual
males
residing
in
Los
Angeles. Now, P. jiroveci is recognised as one
of the common causes of life-threatening oppor-
tunistic infections in patients with HIV infection
worldwide.
In developing countries, many of the cases are
not being reported due to the non-availability of
modern healthcare. Pneumocystis is responsible
for up to 80% of HIV-infected infants with pneu-
monia in Africa.
Chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim and sul-
famethoxazole or aerosolised pentamidine is use-
ful for preventing infection in patients with CD4
counts below 200 cells/μL.
Talaromycosis
Talaromycosis (formerly penicilliosis) is a life-
threatening disease caused by a thermally dimor-
phic fungus Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei,
which was ﬁrst isolated from a bamboo rat in
Vietnam in 1956.
Capponi
and
co-workers
(1956)
ﬁrst
demonstrated P. marneffei in the liver of a bam-
boo
rat.
Gabriel
Segretian
documented
a
laboratory-acquired case due to accidental inocu-
lation of the skin. Gabriel Segretian named the
organism in honour of Hubert Marneffei. The ﬁrst
case of natural human infection was reported by
DiSalvo and co-workers (1973) in an American
minister with Hodgkin’s disease.
The Fungus
T. marneffei is the only dimorphic fungus in the
genus Talaromyces. The fungus grows rapidly on
SDA. At 25 C, it grows as a mould and produces
greenish-yellow colonies with a dark green edge
and pink or red centre. It exhibits brick red pig-
ment on the reverse. At 37 C, it grows as a small
yeast, producing cream-coloured mucoid colonies
resembling H. capsulatum.
Pathogenesis of Talaromycosis
Inhalation of its conidia is the main route of
infection, followed by invasion through the skin.
It is recognised by the host immune cells as a
pathogen
leading
to
phagocytosis
by
macrophages. However, instead of being killed
by macrophage, T. marneffei uses it as a host for
cell
multiplication
and
transformation
into
yeast form.
The most frequent organs involved in this
disease are the liver and lungs. However, infec-
tion in these two organs also affects lymph nodes,
bone marrow, skin and intestines. Talaromycosis
typically develops as an opportunistic infection
in the immunocompromised hosts, especially
in patients with HIV when CD4+ T cells are
<100 cells/mm3.

Pseudallescheria boydii and Scedosporium apiospermum Infection
999
Clinical Syndromes
In
talaromycosis-associated
HIV
infection
patients, the severity of disease likely depends
on CD4 number with low CD4 count associated
with more invasive and necrotising lesions.
Talaromycosis
can
present
as
a
local
or
disseminated infection. Mucocutaneous lesions
are frequently present in the disseminated form.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Microscopy
Direct examination of the tissue or secretions by
microscopy after staining with Wright stain and
another histological staining like periodic acid-
Schiff (PAS), haematoxylin and eosin (H&E),
Giemsa or Gomori methenamine silver (GMS)
can show yeast form with pleomorphic, sausage-
like shape and cross-walls.
Culture
Culture from bone marrow or blood samples can
be used to cultivate the fungus after 2–7-day
incubation at 37 C.
Serology
Serology, both antibody and antigen tests, has
been developed. Mp1p mannoprotein antigen
detection by 4D1 monoclonal antibody with
ELISA or strip tests in plasma and urine can be
used. Galactomannan assay for Aspergillus is
another positive diagnostic tool in talaromycosis
patients.
Molecular Detection
Molecular based assay or polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) for T. marneffei identiﬁcation is now
available but limited in research use only.
Treatment
The
therapeutic
strategy
for
talaromycosis
comprises three phases: induction phase with
amphotericin
B,
consolidation
phase
with
itraconazole and maintenance phase with contin-
uation with itraconazole until the CD4 count rises
above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months.
Epidemiology and Prevention
T. marneffei causes endemic infection in several
countries, mostly in South and Southeast Asia,
including Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, South-
ern China, Taiwan, Northeast India and Laos. It is
an AIDS-deﬁning illness. Regarding the natural
reservoir of T. marneffei, only human and bam-
boo rats have been reported so far.
Prevention and Control
As talaromycosis is mainly seen in immunocom-
promised individuals such as with HIV/AIDS,
itraconazole prophylaxis is advised to prevent
this infection in the endemic zones.
Pseudallescheria boydii
and Scedosporium apiospermum
Infection
Pseudallescheria boydii (teleomorph or sexual
stage)
and
Scedosporium
apiospermum
(Fig. 67.17) (asexual stage) are moulds that
cause opportunistic infection in immunocompro-
mised persons such as patients with HIV. These
cause
a
disease
that
clinically
resembles
aspergillosis.
The diagnosis is made by demonstration of
septate hyphae in tissue that resemble those of
Aspergillus. It can be differentiated from Asper-
gillus by culture on SDA medium. In culture,
S. apiospermum produces pear-shaped conidia,
whereas P. boydii produces fruiting bodies and
ascospores. The fungus causes cutaneous and
disseminated infections. Blood culture is fre-
quently useful for the diagnosis of disseminated
infection.
Voriconazole and itraconazole are the drugs of
choice to treat P. boydii infection. Resistance to

amphotericin B has been reported. Surgical
removal of infected necrotic tissue is also useful.

Fusariosis
Fusarium solani (Fig. 67.18) is the most common
agent that causes fusariosis, primarily in neutro-
penic patients. It resembles Aspergillus in that it is
a mould with septate hyphae, which tends to
invade blood vessels. Fever associated with
lesions in the skin is the common clinical presen-
tation. The fungus differs from Aspergillus by
culture in which it produces banana-shaped
conidia. F. solani causes a disseminated disease
primarily in neutropenic patients. Blood culture is
frequently useful for the diagnosis of the condi-
tion. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice.

Mycotic Poisoning
1001
Other Fungal Infections
Otomycosis
Otomycosis is an infection caused by a fungus
belonging to species of Aspergillus and Penicil-
lium on the external ear. It is a very common
disease characterised by itching, inability to hear
and pain. It can be diagnosed by demonstrating
the fungi in scrapings and cultures.
Oculomycosis (Keratomycosis, Fungal
Keratitis, Mycotic Keratitis)
Several saprophytic fungi cause ocular infections.
Some
of
them
are
Fusarium,
Aspergillus
spp., Curvularia, Alternaria, Acremonium and
C. albicans. Mycotic keratitis is a corneal infec-
tion caused by fungi, mostly leading to trauma
in the cornea. The condition is characterised
mainly by corneal injury. Extended usage of
corticosteroids in ophthalmology has become a
major cause of keratomycosis. The injured tissues
are colonised with the fungal spores resulting in
inﬂammatory reactions leading to endophthalmitis
and hypopyon ulcer. Deep corneal scraping
specimens collected under a slit-lamp microscope
can be cultured for microscopy. Application of
nystatin, natamycin and amphotericin B can be
used locally to treat the condition.
Mycotic Poisoning
Mycetism and mycotoxicosis are examples of
mycotic poisoning caused by toxic substances
produced by the fungi.
Mycetism
Many varieties of poisonous mushrooms have
been found inedible for many years. Mycetism
may cause dermatitis and gastrointestinal disease
and sometimes may lead to death. In recent years,
hallucinogenic substances produced by Psilocybe
species have become attention-seeking. Some of
them are Coprine species causing coprine poison-
ing, Claviceps species causing ergot poisoning
and
Inocybe
species
causing
muscarine
poisoning.
Mycotoxicosis
It
is
caused
by
ingesting
food
substances
contaminated
with
fungal
toxins
called
mycotoxins. These are naturally produced by
fungi and are seen in certain food particles.
Aﬂatoxin is the best-known type of myco-
toxin. These are commonly seen in mouldy
foods,
speciﬁcally
ground
peas
and
corn.
A. ﬂavus secretes aﬂatoxin B1. Aspergillus
parasiticus secretes aﬂatoxins B1, B2, G1 and
G2. These toxins are very toxic to human beings,
animals and birds. They are also of great concern
because they cause carcinogenic effects in human
beings and hepatoma in ducklings and rats. Sev-
eral cases of aﬂatoxicosis in both humans and
animals have been reported from India. Some
examples include fumonisin, a toxin produced
by
Fusarium
species
present
in
maize,
ochratoxin, released by Aspergillus species in
cereals; and toxin produced by Penicillium spe-
cies in bread.
Ergo toxicosis: It is caused by ergot alkaloids
produced by the fungus Claviceps purpurea,
which grows on the fruiting heads of rye. Some
species
of
Fusarium
produce
toxins
called
trichothecenes.
Fusarium
graminearum
produces a toxin called zearalenone, which,
when
consumed
by
animals,
may
develop
symptoms of mimicking an osteogenic disorder.
Case Study
A 32-year-old lady with AIDS was admitted to a
hospital
with
fever
and
other
non-speciﬁc
symptoms. Examination of her tongue revealed
a white, thick patch. HIV serology was positive.
Microscopy of the scrapings collected from the
patch showed Gram-positive yeast. Her CD4
count was 200 cells/μL of blood.

Applied and Clinical Microbiology

Bacteriology of Water, Milk, Air
and Food
68
Ideally, drinking water or potable water should be
not only safe but also pleasant to drink. It should
be clear, colourless and devoid of disagreeable
taste or smell. It should be free from pathogenic
microorganisms and chemical substances.
On the other hand, milk remains sterile at
secretion from the udder but immediately gets
contaminated even before it is secreted out of
the udder. Apart from mastitis cases, these milk-
contaminant bacteria are found to be harmless and
occur in very few numbers. In addition, infection
of the milk by microorganisms may occur during
milking, handling, storage and all the downstream
pre-processing events.
Innumerable microorganisms are present all
over the air and in the environment. Apart from
bacteria, moulds and viruses are also present and
can be transmitted from person to person in the
form of aerosols. The proportion of the dust
particles or aerosols reaching the lung depends
on their size. All particles over 5 μm are retained
in the nose, and those of 1 μm reach the lung and
are retained in the alveoli.
Bacterial analysis of water, milk and air is
therefore carried out to indicate the quality of
these items used in day-to-day life.
Bacteriology of Water
Water is said to be contaminated or polluted when
contaminated with sewage or other excreted mat-
ter from humans and animals that contain
infective and parasitic agents, poisonous chemi-
cal substances and industrial or other wastes.

Bacterial Flora in Water
Bacterial ﬂora in water (Table 68.1) can be clas-
siﬁed into three groups as follows:
Natural water bacteria: These are the bacte-
ria that are commonly found in water free from
gross pollution.
Soil bacteria: These are the bacteria that are
not normal inhabitants of water but are found
after being washed into the water during heavy
rains.
Sewage bacteria: These are the bacteria that
are not normal inhabitants of water but are found
in the water after being contaminated with sew-
age. These bacteria include those which are the
normal inhabitants of the intestine of humans and
animals. These also include the bacteria that live
mainly on the decomposed organic matter of
either plant or animal origin.
Factors Determining the Number
of Bacteria in Water
The following factors determine the number of
bacteria in water:
Salinity: The number of bacteria present in
water depends on the salinity of water; more is
the salinity, lesser is the number of bacteria.

However, some halophilic bacteria survive better
in saline water.

Acidity: Acidity of water has a deleterious
effect on most bacteria.
Temperature:
Low
temperature
usually
favours the survival of the bacteria. However, in
the presence of organic materials, bacteria tend to
multiply even at high temperatures.
Light:
Sunlight
with
the
wavelength
of
300–400 nm is highly bactericidal, provided
water is clear and static. The bactericidal effect
is reduced due to the presence of organic matter
and due to movement in the water.
Storage: Water storage decreases bacterial
count in stored water due to sedimentation and
revitalisation.

Organic matter: When organic matter is
plenty, the microorganisms tend to multiply and
are present in large numbers, whereas when it is
less, the organisms are few.
Type of water: Surface water is more likely to
be contaminated than deep water. The latter is
usually pure.
Water-Borne Microorganisms
The supply of drinking water is contaminated
with sewage or other excreted matter from
humans and animals; it can transmit many
pathogens,
including
bacteria,
viruses
and
parasites (Table 68.2).

Bacteriology of Water
1007
Bacteriological Examination of Water
A wide number of pathogens can be transmitted
by contaminated water. Hence, the main purpose
of water testing is to know whether a water-borne
pathogen contaminates the water or not. There-
fore, in the interests of public health, water
supplies should be tested regularly to conﬁrm
their freedom from such contamination.
It is impracticable to attempt to detect all types
of water-borne pathogens, any of which may be
present only intermittently. Instead, an attempt is
made on testing the water for microorganisms that
indicate faecal contamination of water. These are
known as indicator organisms. These are usually
common intestinal commensal bacteria, which are
universally present in and excreted in large num-
bers in human and animal faeces. They are rarely
found in other sources.
Indicator Organisms
The presence of indicator organisms speciﬁes that
(1) faecal matter has contaminated the water sup-
ply, (2) the faecal bacteria have not been removed
by puriﬁcation processes and (3) hence, the water
supply may be a source of contamination with
dangerous intestinal pathogens. The indicator
organism should have the properties of (1) being
present in human faeces in large numbers, (2) not
multiplying in water to any extent and (3) being
more resistant than pathogens to the stresses of
the aquatic environment and disinfection pro-
cesses, such as the process of chlorination.
Some of the organisms that are used as indica-
tor organisms are as follows:
Coliforms
These are the bacteria that occur in large numbers
in sewage and faeces. They are also found in the
environment in the absence of faecal contamina-
tion. Traditionally, these are members of the
Enterobacteriaceae, which grow in the presence
of bile salts and produce acid and gas from lactose
within 48 h at 37 C. The total coliform count is
widely regarded as the most reliable indicator of
potable water quality.
Thermotolerant Coliform Bacteria
These are the coliform organisms that can ferment
lactose at 44–45 C; the group includes the genus
Escherichia and some species of Klebsiella,
Enterobacter and Citrobacter.
Faecal Streptococci
These bacteria are found in the intestinal tract of
humans and animals. They belong to the genus
Enterococcus
and
are
catalase-negative
and
Gram-positive cocci. They can survive at 60 C
for 30 minutes and grow at a pH of 9.6 and in the
presence of 6.5% sodium chloride.
Sulphite-reducing Clostridia
These are members of the genus Clostridium,
which can reduce sulphite to sulphide. The most
important
of
the
group
is
Clostridium
perfringens. Although it is less numerous in
human faeces than other indicator organisms, its
spores can survive in the environment and treat-
ment
processes
better
than
most
indicator
bacteria.
Collection of Water Samples for Analysis
Water samples should be collected in heat-
sterilised bottles of 250 mL capacity with ground
glass stoppers. A 0.23 mL of fresh 1.8% solution
of sodium thiosulphate crystal is added into the
bottle before sterilisation to neutralise the bacteri-
cidal effect of any chlorine or chloramine in the
water.
Sampling from a Tap or Pump Outlet
When collecting from taps, allow the water to run
to waste for 2–3 min before running it into the
bottle. Then the stopper is opened, the bottle is
ﬁlled with water and the stopper is replaced.
Sampling from a Reservoir, such as a Stream,
River, Lakes and Tanks
When sampling from streams or lakes, the bottle
is opened at a depth of about 30 cm with its mouth
facing the current, and it is ensured that the water
entering the bottle has not been in contact with
hands.

1008
68
Bacteriology of Water, Milk, Air and Food
Sampling from a Well
The sampling bottle is tied with a stone and a
clean cord of suitable length and is lowered to
the required depth in the well. The bottle is
completely immersed in the water. When the
bottle is ﬁlled, it is pulled out and stoppered. It
is ensured that the bottle does not touch the side
of the well at any time. After the collection of
water, the bottle is wrapped in Kraft paper and is
labelled with the following details: the source,
time and date of collection of water samples.
The bottle is transported immediately or prefera-
bly within 6 h of collection in a cool container,
being protected from the sunlight.
Sample Storage
Collected samples should be analysed within
6–24 h. Collected samples should be transported
immediately with ice packs. If ice packs are not
available, transportation time must not exceed
2 h.
Methods of Water Analysis
Following tests are generally done for the routine
bacteriological analysis of water.
Presumptive Coliform Count
The test is called presumptive coliform count
because the reaction demonstrated may occasion-
ally be due to the presence of some other
microorganisms. This is a multiple tube method
in which measured volumes of water and water
dilutions are added to a series of tubes or bottles
containing a liquid indicator medium. The most
common medium used is double-strength and
single-strength
MacConkey
broth
containing
bromocresol purple and an inverted Durham
tube to detect gas production (Fig. 68.1).
The measured volume of water to be tested is
added by sterile graduated pipettes to tubes or
McCartney bottles as follows: (1) 50 mL of
water is added to one bottle of 50 mL double-
strength medium, (2) 10 mL of water each to ﬁve
bottles
of
10
mL
double-strength
medium,
(3) 1 mL of water each to ﬁve tubes of 5 mL
single-strength medium and (4) 0.1 mL of water
each to ﬁve tubes of 5 mL single-strength
medium.
The inoculated bottles are incubated at 37 C
for 48 h. The presumptive coliform count per
100 mL of water is determined by demonstrating
acid and gas in MacConkey broth using the
McCrady probability. The water sample showing
a presumptive coliform count of 0 is considered
excellent, whereas water samples showing coli-
form counts of 1–3, 4–10 and more than 10/ml are
considered satisfactory, suspicious and unsatis-
factory, respectively.
Differential Coliform Count
Differential coliform count is carried out by the
Eijkman test. Some spore-bearing bacteria give
false-positive reactions in the presumptive coli-
form test. The Eijkman test determines whether
the coliform bacilli detected in the presumptive
test are Escherichia coli or not. After the usual
presumptive test, the test is carried out and is
performed by inoculating sub-cultures from the
positive presumptive tests at 44 and 37 C into
fresh tubes of single-strength MacConkey broth
with the Durham tube. Those tubes showing gas
in the Durham tube after incubation at 44 C after
24 h indicate the presence of E. coli. Conﬁrmation
of E. coli is made by sub-culturing on the solid
media and testing the colour for indole production
and citrate utilisation.
Detection of Faecal Streptococci
Detection of faecal streptococci in water samples
also indicates faecal contamination of water.
After the usual presumptive test, the test is carried
out after the usual presumptive test is performed
by incubating sub-cultures from the positive pre-
sumptive tests at 45 C for 18 h. The presence of
acid in the medium indicates the presence of
Enterobacter faecalis. Further conﬁrmation of
E. faecalis is made by sub-culturing on the
MacConkey medium.
Detection of C. Perfringens
It is detected in water samples by inoculating it in
a
litmus
milk
medium
and
incubating
it

anaerobically at 37 C for 5 days. A typical
stormy clot reaction along with the formation of
the acid indicates the presence of C. perfringens.
Further conﬁrmation of the bacteria is made by
motility and nitrate reduction test.
Bacteriology of Water
1009
Fig. 68.1 Multiple tube
method
Membrane Filtration Method
In this method, a measured volume of the water
sample is ﬁltered through a membrane with a pore
size small enough to retain the indicator bacteria
to be counted. The membrane is then placed and
incubated on a selective indicator medium so that
the indicator bacteria grow to produce colonies.
These colonies are then identiﬁed and counted to
measure the contamination of the water.
Detection of Specific Pathogens
V. cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, etc., are the spe-
ciﬁc pathogens which can be detected in a water
sample to know the contamination. Speciﬁc
selective media for these bacteria are employed
to detect these in contaminated water. For exam-
ple, double-strength selenite F broth is used for
S. Typhi, whereas alkaline peptone water is used
for V. cholerae. Subsequently, these bacteria are
identiﬁed by their cultural and biochemical
characteristics.
Viruses in Water
Over 100 enteric viruses and other cytopatho-
genic viruses (e.g. Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis E
virus, poliomyelitis virus, rotavirus and Norwalk
virus) are said to be present in both sewage and
drinking water. Viruses can be removed from
water
by
either
coagulation
or
disinfection
procedures. By chlorination, with a concentration
of 0.5 mg/L free residual chlorine, pH <8, turbid-
ity of 1 or less nephelometric turbidity units and
minimum contact period of 30 min, viruses are
assumed to be destroyed. Although chlorination

is used as the best possible treatment for remov-
ing viruses, the exact mechanism is unknown.

Protozoa in Water
Protozoans are also said to be the most common
contaminants in drinking water. There are no
sensitive indicators for protozoan contamination
of water. And coliform counts are also not reliable
indicators as these protozoans are found to be
resistant to normal levels of chlorine used for
disinfection.
Bacteriology of Milk
Milk is an opaque white liquid, which provides
the primary source of nutrition for newborns
before they can digest other types of food. It is a
water-based ﬂuid that is primarily an emulsion of
butterfat globules. Every single fat globule
encompasses
a
membrane
made
up
of
phospholipids and proteins. These emulsiﬁers
prevent the individual globules from attaching
with each other into observable grains of butterfat
and
also
protect
the
globules
from
the
fat-digesting activity of enzymes found in the
ﬂuid portion of the milk.
Bacterial Flora of Milk
Lactic Acid Bacteria
This group of bacteria can produce lactic acid
from lactose. They are generally present in the
milk, and they have been used as starter cultures
in the manufacturing of cultured dairy products
like yoghurt. Some of the lactobacilli present in
milk are mentioned as follows:
1. Lactococci, such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subsp.
lactis
(Streptococcus
lactis)
and
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (Strepto-
coccus cremoris),
2. Lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus casei, L.
delbrueckii
subsp.
lactis
(L.
lactis),
L.
delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lactobacillus
bulgaricus) and Leuconostoc.
Coliforms
These are facultative anaerobes that grow at an
optimum temperature of 37 C. They are indicator
organisms that are closely correlated with the
existence of pathogens but are not compulsorily
pathogenic themselves. They are capable of
spoiling milk rapidly as they can ferment lactose
by producing acid and gas and can disintegrate
proteins
in
milk.
They
can
be
killed
by
pasteurisation;
hence,
their
presence
after
pasteurisation is usually a clear indication of con-
tamination. E. coli is an example that can act as a
milk-contaminating microbe.
Importance of Presence
of Microorganisms in Milk
The data about milk’s microbial content can help
assess
its
sanitary
quality
and
the
sterile
conditions maintained during its production. Bac-
teria present in the milk can cause spoilage of the
product if allowed to multiply. Milk is easily
susceptible to being contaminated with patho-
genic microorganisms. Therefore, precautions
must be taken to prevent this possibility and erad-
icate pathogens that may gain access. Certain
microorganisms
produce
changes
chemically
that is beneﬁcial in producing dairy products,
such as yoghurt and cheese.
Microorganisms Causing Spoilage
of Milk
The quality of microbes in raw milk is vital for
producing dairy foods of the utmost quality.
Spoilage describes the degradation of a food’s
texture, odour, ﬂavour or colour to the extent
where it is unappetising or unacceptable for
human consumption. The spoilage of food by

microbes often involves the disintegration of pro-
tein,
carbohydrates
and
fats
by
either
microorganisms themselves or by their enzymes.

Psychrotrophic organisms are microbes that
are involved in the spoilage of milk. Most of the
psychrotrophic
organisms
are
killed
by
pasteurisation
temperatures;
some
microorganisms like Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens
and Pseudomonas fragican produce lipolytic
and proteolytic extracellular enzymes, which are
stable in heat and capable of producing spoilage.
Some species such as Arthrobacter, Bacillus,
Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Microbacterium,
Micrococcus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus
species can withstand pasteurisation and can
grow at refrigeration temperatures and thus can
cause spoilage problems.
Pathogenic Microorganisms in Milk
Hygienic milk production involves the proper
handling and storage of milk, and compulsory
pasteurisation shall decrease the hazard of milk-
borne diseases, such as brucellosis, tuberculosis
and typhoid fever. There have been reports of
several food-borne illnesses that resulted from
various issues such as ingestion of raw milk or
poorly handled dairy products or not properly
pasteurised, which cause post-processing contam-
ination of milk.
Milk-borne
diseases
are
of
three
types:
(1) infections primarily of humans but transmitted
through milk, (2) infections primarily of animals
that
can
be
transmitted
to
humans
and
(3) infections transmitted by milk contaminated
with excreta of ticks and rats (Table 68.3).
Moulds of the species such as Aspergillus,
Fusarium and Penicillium can also grow in milk
and dairy products. If the conditions are permis-
sible, these moulds produce mycotoxins which
cause a serious health hazard.
Pasteurisation
Pasteurisation is the process of heating the milk
by either of the below-mentioned methods: (1) a
high temperature for a short time (at least 72 C
for 15 s. This method is known as the ‘Flash’
method. (2) a low temperature for a long time
(at least 63 C for 30 min). This method is known
as the ‘Holder’ method. Certain bacteria such as
Bacillus
spp.
and
Coxiella
burnetii
resist
pasteurisation by the ‘Holder’ method.
Ultra-High-Temperature Treatment
Ultra-high-temperature processing (UHT) of milk
involves a continuous ﬂow of heat at a high
temperature (135 C) for a short time (1–8 s).
Boiling
Boiling milk boiling at 100
C for 15 min
destroys all vegetative cells leaving behind spores
of spore formers. Hence this method is not as
efﬁcacious as the methods mentioned above.

1012

Bacteriology of Water, Milk, Air and Food
Bacteriological Examination of Milk
Following groups of tests can carry out a bacteri-
ological examination of milk.
Colony Counts
This test is carried out by plate dilution methods.
Raw milk may contain 500 to several million
bacteria per millilitre of milk.
Coliform Counts
Coliforms
in
milk
indicate
improper
pasteurisation of milk or post-pasteurisation con-
tamination of milk. This is because all coliforms
are destroyed during the pasteurisation of milk.
This test is carried out by inoculating varying
milk dilutions into MacConkey medium and not-
ing the production of acid and gas after 48 h of
incubation at 37 C. The presence of acid and gas
indicates the presence of coliforms in milk.
Methylene Blue Test
This has been a test used for a long to demonstrate
bacterial contamination of milk. It indicates the
number of viable bacteria present in the milk. It is
a rapid and inexpensive way of indicating poor-
quality milk that had been unrefrigerated. The
basis of the test is that the presence of viable
bacteria in milk reduces methylene blue and
decolourises the milk when kept in a dark place.
The test is performed by using a 1:300,000 solu-
tion of methylene blue. One millilitre of the meth-
ylene blue solution is added to 10 mL of the milk
sample in a test tube. Both the milk and methy-
lene blue solution are mixed by shaking and then
placing the mixture in a water bath at 37 C for
30 min in the dark. Untreated milk can be consid-
ered satisfactory if it fails to decolourise the dye
within 30 min.
Phosphatase Test
Alkaline phosphatase is normally present in milk
and is inactivated if pasteurisation has been car-
ried out effectively. Successful pasteurisation,
which
kills
non-sporing
pathogens,
also
inactivates
alkaline
phosphatase.
The
test
depends on the ability of the enzyme to liberate
p-nitrophenyl phosphate after breaking down
disodium
p-nitrophenyl
phosphate.
The
test
determines the amount of alkaline phosphatase
present after pasteurisation by measuring the
amount of p-nitrophenyl phosphate it liberates,
which is known by the development of a yellow
colour quantitated by a colourimeter.
Turbidity Test
This is the deﬁnitive test for checking the
sterilisation of milk, thereby distinguishing it
from the untreated milk and milk that has been
merely
pasteurised.
The
degree
of
heating
necessary for sterilisation causes all the heat-
coagulable proteins in milk to become precipita-
ble by ammonium sulphate. If the amount of heat
applied to milk is insufﬁcient for sterilisation,
some of its protein will not be precipitated by
ammonium sulphate and will be detected by its
coagulation, resulting in turbidity when a ﬁltrate
of ammonium sulphate-treated milk is boiled. The
absence of turbidity indicates that the milk has
been boiled or heated to at least 100 C for at least
5 min.
Detection of Specific Pathogens
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Brucella species
are the speciﬁc pathogens that can be detected in
milk to know the transmission of these bacteria
through milk. Speciﬁc selective media for these
bacteria are employed to detect these in infected
milk. For example, M. tuberculosis can be
isolated from the centrifuged milk deposit by
inoculation in Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) medium
or by inoculation in guinea pigs. Similarly, Bru-
cella spp. maybe isolated from milk samples by
inoculating in serum dextrose agar or intramuscu-
lar inoculation in guinea pigs. Subsequently,
these bacteria are identiﬁed by their cultural and
biochemical properties. Brucella spp. in infected
animals can also be demonstrated by milk ring
test, whey agglutination test and demonstration of
Brucella antibodies in serum.

Bacteriology of Air
1013
Bacteriology of Air
The load of microorganisms present in the air
depends on whether the air is indoors or outdoors.
The number of bacteria at any time is dependent
on many factors, the most important of which are
the number of persons present, the amount of
their body movements and the amount of distur-
bance of their clothing.
Bacteriological Examination of Air
Air-borne infection denotes the infection caused
by the transmission of respiratory droplets or
aerosols less than 5 μm in size. Droplet infection
denotes the infection caused by the transmission
of respiratory droplets or aerosols larger than
5 μm size.
Observations of the number of bacteria carry-
ing particles in the air may be required in
premises where safe working depends on the
air’s content of bacteria being kept at a very low
level, for example, operation theatres. Bacterio-
logical examination of air is also necessary for
monitoring
air
quality
in
hospital
wards,
storehouses of food and pharmacy, etc. Ideally,
the bacterial count should not exceed 1 per cubic
foot of air in operation theatre for neurosurgery,
10 per cubic foot in operation theatre for other
surgery and 50 per cubic foot in homes, ofﬁces
and factories.
Microbial Quality of Outdoor Air
The microbial quality of outdoor air depends on
various factors such as (1) the density/mass of
both human and animal populations, (2) the
nature of vegetation/plantations, (3) the content
of the soil and (4) atmospheric conditions includ-
ing humidity, temperature, wind, rainfall and
sunlight.
The four main areas are known to contribute to
the presence of pathogens in the outdoor air. The
occurrence of these microbes that have been
associated
with
human
health
is
natural
environments, engineering environments, agri-
cultural and waste treatment plants. Fragments
of moulds and spores naturally occur high in
number than bacteria in the atmosphere. Most of
the bacteria that may be present in the atmosphere
are non-pathogenic, and even if some pathogens
are present, they may just contaminate the air and
are incapable of causing any disease due to the
adverse conditions of the outdoor air. It is also
known that pathogenic microbe does not multiply
in air. Aerobic spore-bearing bacilli and some
Achromobacter, Sarcina and Micrococcus found
in the upper atmosphere are mostly isolated from
soil and surface dust, and they can be carried over
for miles. Some infective microbes are carried
only for short distances, and during the course,
their infectious ability is diminished, except in
rare cases such as the foot and mouth disease
virus.
Microbial Content of Indoor Air
This may contain particles of biological origin
suspended in the air in an indoor environment.
This depends on the following sources:
Dust Particles
The dust particles of varying sizes originating
from animals (pets), plants or vegetables, ventila-
tion or air conditioning system.
Humans
They are an important source of common
pathogens. Nasal secretions dispersed by ﬁngers/
hand to any other part of the body or the skin,
bedding or clothing form dust particles when
detached.
Pathogenic
microbes
form
dust
particles when detached directly from different
parts of the body or the skin, such as septic
wounds, perineum, etc. Intestinal pathogens can
be disseminated through dried faecal particles
from napkins used for infants. Heavy particles
fall to the ground and form settled house dust,
while smaller particles of 1 mm or less in diame-
ter remain suspended in the air. The suspended
biological particles are commonly associated with
respiratory illness in humans. The layer of air

surrounding the human body serves as a source of
pathogenic microbes. Physical activity liberates
the desquamated epithelial cells into the environ-
ment, contributing to the microbes in the dust.
Hospital wards, where patients are treated, are
also sources of potential infectious agents like
haemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, tubercle
bacilli, diphtheria bacilli, etc. Bed clothes are
also a rich source of pathogen-loaded dust. Tuber-
culosis, different forms of bacterial pneumonia,
coccidioidomycosis, inﬂuenza, measles and gas-
trointestinal illness are caused by indoor aerosols.

Bacteriology of Water, Milk, Air and Food
Droplets and Droplet Nuclei
Human generates a varying number of droplets
during talking, sneezing and coughing. These
droplets are expelled from the body that ranges
in size from less than 1–15 um (Table 68.4).
These particles may fall to the ground or stay
suspended in the air based on the different sizes.
In the process, it might get evaporated; the
smaller the particle, the faster the evaporation
rate and vice versa. Droplet nuclei are formed
when droplets are converted to minute particles
during evaporation. The viability of the microbes
in the droplet nuclei depends on numerous
factors. Particles of 5 um are retained in the
nose, while those of 1 mm reach the lung and
are retained in the alveoli. Droplets containing
infectious agents may also be released from vari-
ous laboratory practices, dental manipulations,
washing or ﬂushing water closets.

Measuring Bacterial Content of the Air
Various methods have been devised to measure
the bacterial content of the air. A primary distinc-
tion must be drawn between the methods that
measure the rate at which bacteria-carrying
particles are settling by gravity on exposed
surfaces and those that count the number of
bacteria-carrying particles in a given air volume.
The settle plate method (Passive sampling) and
the slit sampler method (Active sampling) are
used for bacteriological examination of air.
Settle Plate Method (Passive Sampling)
The settle plate method is used for testing the
bacteriological quality of air in surgical operation
theatres and hospital wards. In this method, Petri
dishes containing nutrient agar and blood agar
(for
detecting
pathogenic
staphylococci
and
streptococci) must be left open to the air for 1 h,
1 m above the ﬂoor, 1 m from the wall. During
this exposure period, large bacteria-carrying dust

particles settle onto the media. The plates are then
incubated at 37 C for 24 h, following which the
colonies formed on the media are counted.
Bacteriology of Food
1015
Slit Sampler Method (Active Sampling)
The slit sampler method is the most efﬁcient and
convenient method used to estimate the number
of bacteria present in a measured volume of air. In
this method, 1 ft.3 volume of air is directed onto a
plate containing a culture medium through a slit
0.25-mm wide. The plate is then rotated to allow
the microorganisms present in the air to spread
out evenly on the medium. The culture medium is
incubated, and the number of colonies formed on
the medium indicates the number of bacteria pres-
ent in the air.
Bacteriology of Food
One of the major causes of morbidity, particularly
due to the public health problems, results from
food-borne infections. Morbidity is not the only
problem, but sometimes it might result in mortal-
ity. Several species of microorganisms can con-
taminate food, and it becomes a good medium for
the growth of these microorganisms.
There are different, and variety of aetiological
patterns concerning food-borne infections and
these patterns may vary around the world. Factors
that inﬂuence these aetiological patterns include
food preferences, ability of the laboratories, pub-
lic and medical practitioner’s awareness. For
example, in the United States, more than 50% of
the food-borne diseases are caused by Staphylo-
coccus aureus and Salmonella, but in the United
Kingdom, more than 90% of food-borne diseases
are caused by C. perfringens. In Japan, more than
50% of the diseases are caused by Vibrio
parahaemolyticus.
Food-borne outbreak infections refer to a con-
dition when two or more people get the same
illness from the same contaminated food or
drink. Usually, the illness is restricted to gastroin-
testinal manifestations, and food is incriminated
as the source of illness. Food-borne illness, most
commonly referred to as food poisoning, occurs
due to the consumption of contaminated, spoiled
or toxic food. The commonest symptoms of food
poisoning are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
The causative agents are usually gastrointestinal
microorganisms which may also produce harmful
toxins.
Source of Food Contamination
Food ingested must be free of microorganisms.
When microbes contaminate the food, it indicates
a lack of sanitation and precautions while
handling and preparing cooked food. The food
can be contaminated in various ways.
Faeces
The contaminations of faeces in food are mainly
due to the poor hygiene of food handlers.
Insects
The houseﬂy has been identiﬁed as an important
vector in propagating various infectious diseases
such as shigellosis, cholera and salmonellosis.
They act as a cross-contamination vector for
other foodborne pathogens as well.
Air
The
food
uncovered
may
attract
a
lot
of
microorganisms in the air and invite dust to settle
on it.
Domestic animals
They contaminate through their excreta when
handled by people who do not practise proper
sanitary precautions.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis of suspected food-borne
infection or food poisoning depends on the
following:
Clinical history
A careful and detailed history is usually obtained
to rule out the possible causes altogether.

1016
68
Bacteriology of Water, Milk, Air and Food
Specimens
Samples include the consumed food and vomitus
and faeces from affected persons.
Detection of Specific Pathogen
These can be detected by (1) direct microscopic
examination of samples and (2) culture of
samples. This is also supplemented by detecting
bacterial toxins and microbial and chemical anal-
ysis of food samples for the possible presence of
gastrointestinal pathogens.
Prevention of Food-Borne Infections
The four steps to food safety and prevention of
food-borne infections are Clean, Separate, Cook
and Chill. The ﬁrst step is cleaning and washing
hands, utensils, cutting surfaces and the raw food
itself. The use of clean and safe water is essential,
or else the water ends up contaminating the food
material.
Cross-contamination
from
food
materials that are potential sources of organisms
like meat, poultry, ﬁsh and unwashed fruits and
vegetables should be separated and not allowed to
contact other foodstuffs. Cooking should be ade-
quate at the correct temperature to destroy
disease-causing organisms while preserving the
nutrition and palatability of the food. Finally, to
prevent bacterial multiplication and growth of
other organisms, cooked or raw food should be
properly refrigerated, and if necessary, it should
be frozen.
In recent years, consuming exotic dishes made
of raw or semi-cooked ﬁsh or meat products poses
a special risk for the development of food-borne
diseases. Experimenting with such food should be
avoided. It is also to be kept in mind that there are
vulnerable populations like the immunocompro-
mised, infants and elderly population, and preg-
nant women for whom the microbiological safety
of food is essential to minimise food-borne
infections.

Biomedical Waste Management
69
Biomedical Waste
A vast amount of waste is generated in the pro-
cess of healthcare, research, testing or related
procedures
on
human
beings
or
animals
conducted in hospitals, clinics, labs or similar
establishments. This waste is called biomedical
waste.
Potential Hazards of Biomedical Waste
The biomedical wastes contain infected materials
and other items like blood, urine, tissue etc.,
which are excellent substrates for the growth of
many
microorganisms.
These
are
potential
sources of infection to others who come into con-
tact with it. In addition, the chemicals and toxic
drugs and substances can cause pollution of water,
air or the soil or toxicity to the individuals and the
biological forms which may come in contact with
it. Radiation wastes and sharp instruments or glass
wastes can cause injury.
Due to a higher concentration of infectious
and other such hazardous substances, this form
of
waste
requires
special
attention
for
its
safe disposal. If the waste ﬁnds its way back
to the community, it would be disastrous. It
can act as a source of infection to residents or
visitors of hospitals, and the chemicals contained
in the waste may seep into the surrounding
soil and contaminate wells and tanks, thereby
polluting them.

Most governments in the world have laws and
guidelines ensuring that institutions, where bio-
medical waste is generated take appropriate
measures for the safe disposal of such waste. An
ordinance to this effect was promulgated in India
in 1998, under which the institutes where such
waste is generated have been held legally respon-
sible for the safe disposal of biomedical waste.
The new Biomedical Waste Management Rules
2016 (amended in 2018) replaced the earlier
Rules (1998) and amendments. It has simpliﬁed
the process of categorisation of waste and
authorisation. In 2018, the rules were further
amended with the speciﬁc purpose of environ-
mental protection. It stipulates that all healthcare
facilities should phase out and ﬁnally discontinue
the use of chlorinated plastic bags and gloves
(except blood bags).
Types of Biomedical Waste
Handling of biomedical waste is increasingly
associated with the risk of laboratory-acquired
infections. Most of these infections are caused
by hepatitis B virus, Bacillus anthracis, Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis, Francisella tularensis,
Shigella species and Brucella species. Biomedi-
cal wastes are of the following types:

Waste Treatment and Disposal
Waste treatment and disposal form a very impor-
tant component of the proper waste management
program of the hospital. Segregation of infectious
waste from non-infectious waste is the most
important stage required before treating and dis-
posing of biomedical wastes. This is required to

protect the health of medical personnel coming in
contact
with
infectious
biomedical
wastes
(Table 69.2).

General Principles of Waste
Management
The main objectives of bio-waste management
area are as follows: (1) to minimise the biomedi-
cal waste generated, (2) to ensure that bio-waste is
handled and disposed efﬁciently, (3) to reduce the
incidence of disease or injury among healthcare
workers and (4) to retrieve usable materials.
Steps Involved in Waste Management
The following are the steps in waste management:
Reduction
It focuses on the use of replacement of medical
and surgical equipment with reusable ones.
Utilisation of reusable or recyclable products or
products containing recycled materials should be
preferred wherever possible and with patients’
safety in mind.
Segregation
It refers to the separation of waste at the point of
generation and placed in appropriate containers
based on waste category (Table 69.2). Segrega-
tion is required because if biomedical waste is
mixed with general waste, then the total waste
requires special treatment and handling.
Storage
It refers to waste being safely contained during
handling and to the point of its disposal. After
the biomedical waste has been collected and
moved from its point of generation, it may be
held in storage areas to await disposal. Impor-
tant factors to be considered are the type of
waste
being
contained,
appropriate
colour
coding and labelling, special transportation
requirements; the method of disposal and the
disposal facility. These storage areas must be
covered and separated from food preparation
areas.
Transportation
This refers to transporting waste from the point of
generation to the treatment or disposal area. The
handling, sending for transport and transport of
biomedical waste must be organised accurately.
Packaging containers should be checked to meet
requirements for all modes of transport.
Treatment
There are different procedures to reduce the bulk
of waste to less or non-infectious materials.
Appropriate treatment options should be followed
for various types of waste. For example, steam
autoclaving can be carried out for microbial
waste, whereas it may not be useful for human
or anatomical waste. The other treatment option
available is chemical decontamination.
Disposal methods available for different types
of waste have to be followed accurately. The ﬁnal
disposal can be made either on the premises or
away from crowded areas.

Biomedical Waste Management
Methods of Waste Treatment
There are various methods of management of
biomedical wastes.
Autoclaving
Steam autoclave is one of the best methods to
treat microbiological laboratory waste. This is
used to treat non-anatomical waste like waste
sharps, etc.
The person handling the equipment should be
well trained. The period and temperature are very
important as they decide how effectively the
substances are decontaminated. Steam should
penetrate the waste for effective autoclaving
results. Containers that have good steam perme-
ability are used to achieve good results. Special
attention should be given to packing.
Special care should be given for selecting plas-
tic bags used in the autoclave. Some bags do not
allow steam penetration, and some get melted
during the process. So, bags are selected using
actual working conditions to ensure they are best
suited for autoclaving. Organic wastes which can
explode are not autoclaved.
Chemical Decontamination
Chemical decontamination is used for treating
microbiology laboratory waste, body ﬂuid and
human blood. Anatomical waste cannot be treated
by using this. Waste sharps can be partially
sterilised using chemicals.
Some of the main factors to be considered
while using chemical decontamination are the
type of disinfectant used, type of microorganism,
level of contamination, quantity and concentra-
tion of the disinfectant. Some other factors which
also have to be considered are temperature, pH,
degree of mixing and the time the contaminated
waste is in contact with the disinfectant.
Usually, undiluted commercially available
sodium hypochlorite (5.25% solution), which
has 50,000 mg/L of free available chlorine, is
used as an intermediate-level disinfectant. If the
sodium hypochlorite solution is to be used by
diluting, it should be prepared daily, so there is
no loss of germicidal action.
Incineration
In this process, the waste is combusted to ash.
This process achieves a reduction of 75% by
weight and 90% by volume. This method is
widely used in medical hospitals and other
healthcare institutes. This can be used to treat
anatomical
and
non-anatomical
biomedical
wastes. Incineration is the most successful tech-
nology used to treat all kinds of biomedical waste
till now.
Microwave Treatment
Radiations produced by microwaves are increas-
ingly used nowadays to treat infectious hospital
wastes. The microwaves heat the biological
wastes to a temperature of 97–100
C in
40–45 min cycle. The advantage of the method
is that it is not associated with any hazardous
emissions,
but
it
cannot
be
used
to
treat
anatomical body parts and tissues.
Plasma Torch
Waste treatment by plasma torch produces a very
high temperature that is very useful for treating
biological wastes. It is a very safe method,
although it is highly expensive.
Disposal of Biomedical Wastes
Landﬁll, deep burial and sewage are different
methods used to dispose of biomedical wastes
safely. Landﬁll or deep burial—although it is a
safe method for disposal of sharps and products of
chemical disinfection—requires the presence of
large areas of uninhabited land. Trenches are dug
where the waste is buried and are covered with
lime, followed by soil.
Spill Management
In a hospital, spillage of hazardous substances
such as body ﬂuids, drugs, chemicals etc., can
occur due to breakage of containers, defective
equipment or human error. Any such spill poses
a risk to the staff, visitors and patients susceptible

to infection. Thus, every healthcare facility
should have a clear-cut policies, proper standard
operative procedures (SOP) and trained staff to
manage such an event immediately and effec-
tively. There should be separate SOPs for blood
and body ﬂuids spill, chemical spill, ﬂammable
and non-ﬂammable liquid spill, solid spill and
mercury spill.
Spill Management
1023
Management of Blood and Body Fluids,
Including Infectious Materials Spill
For small spills, the following procedure is
adopted:
1. The persons managing the spill should apply
workman’s gloves and other personal protec-
tive equipment, including masks and face
shields.
2. Any sharp object like glass pieces should ﬁrst
be picked up with forceps and discarded in an
appropriate container.
3. The spill is covered with blotting paper or
newspaper or paper towel.
4. The spill should be wiped with paper soaked in
1% hypochlorite solution containing 500 ppm
chlorine. The paper is then discarded in a
biohazard bag.
5. The area is again wiped with 1% hypochlorite
solution and allowed to dry.
For larger spills of more than 10 ml, the
procedure is more or less the same as above
except for the following points:
1. The area should be conﬁned, and all entry of
unnecessary persons is restricted.
2. Instead of 1% hypochlorite, a 10% solution
should be used.

Healthcare-Associated Infections
70
The term hospital infection, hospital-acquired
infection or nosocomial infection has now been
known as healthcare-associated infection (HAI)
to include infections acquired from clinics, ambu-
latory healthcare services, health camps, etc.
Around 5% of the patients who are hospitalised
experience nosocomial infection. Nosocomial
infection is a public health threat in developing
and developed countries. These infections are the
important cause of morbidity, mortality and eco-
nomic problems in hospitalised patients.
Healthcare-Associated Infections
The impact of hospital-acquired infections is con-
siderable—the patient may need longer hospital
treatment, readmission or even further surgery,
increasing the time of absence from work and
use
of
hospital
and
community
resources.
Minimised stay in hospital these days shows that
infections
acquired
from
the
hospital
have
increased, and such cases present themselves to
the community practitioners or private health
sectors. As the administration of intravenous
medication
at
households
has
increased,
infections
that
are
cannula-associated,
once
which were conﬁned to patients in the hospitals,
are seen at the community level.

Definition of Healthcare-Associated
Infection
Healthcare-associated
infections
(HAIs)
are
infections that ﬁrst appear 48 h or more after
hospitalisation. HAI applies to infections occur-
ring in hospitalised patients who were neither
infected nor were in incubation at the time of
their admission to the hospital.
Iatrogenic Infections
Iatrogenic infection is deﬁned as an infection after
medical or surgical management, whether or not
the patient was hospitalised. Blood-borne virus
infections such as HIV and hepatitis virus due to
unsafe injection drug use and unsterile medical
procedures are examples of iatrogenic infections.
Laboratory-Acquired Infections
Laboratory-acquired
infections
(LAIs)
are
deﬁned as all infections acquired through labora-
tory or laboratory-related activities resulting in
occupational exposure to infectious agents. Bru-
cellosis, hepatitis and typhoid fever are some
examples
of
laboratory-acquired
infections.

Equipment
They can be acquired through (1) inhalation such
as aerosols, (2) percutaneous inoculation (needle
and syringe, cuts or abrasions from contaminated
items and animal bites), (3) contact between
mucous membranes and contaminated material
(hands or surfaces) and (4) ingestion (aspiration
through a pipette, smoking or eating).

Biosafety Level
Biosafety is the application of safety precautions
that reduce a laboratorian’s risk of exposure to a
potentially infectious microbe and limit contami-
nation of the work environment. There are four
biosafety levels. Biosafety level designations are
based on a composite of the design features, con-
struction,
containment
facilities,
equipment,
practices and operational procedures required for
working with agents from the various risk groups.
Biosafety Level I
Laboratory facilities are designated as BSL-I
handles
the
microorganisms
which
are
not
known to consistently cause disease in healthy
adults and present minimal potential hazard to
laboratorians and the environment. An example
of such microorganisms is the non-pathogenic
strain of Escherichia coli.
Biosafety Level II
Laboratory facilities are designated as BSL-II
deals with microorganisms such as Staphylococ-
cus aureus, which pose moderate hazards to
laboratorians
and
the
environment.
These
microorganisms are typically indigenous and
associated with diseases of varying severity.
Biosafety Level III
Laboratory facilities are designated as BSL-III
deals with microorganisms such as Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis, which can be either indigenous
or exotic, and they can cause serious or poten-
tially
lethal
disease
through
respiratory
transmission.
Biosafety Level IV
Laboratory facilities are designated as BSL-IV
deals with microorganisms posing a high risk of
aerosol-transmitted infections. Infections caused
by these microbes are frequently fatal and without
treatment
or
vaccines,
for
example,
Ebola,
Marburg viruses.
Biosafety level laboratories and risk groups of
organisms are listed in Table 70.1.
Factors Affecting Healthcare-Associated
Infection
HAIs as a group differ from other community-
acquired infections, both in their patient proﬁle
and the severity and treatment of the disease
caused by them. Various factors inﬂuence HAIs.
Hospitalised Patients
Susceptible hospitalised patients are one of the
many
factors
responsible
for
healthcare-
associated infections. This is because most
patients
admitted
in
wards
have
impaired

immunity either as a part of their pre-existing
disease processes or, in some instances, due to
the treatment they have received in the hospital.
They
are,
therefore,
highly
susceptible
to
infection.
Healthcare-Associated Infections
1027
Hospital Environment
The hospital environment harbours a higher load
of microorganisms due to the multitudes of
infected patients visiting the hospital. These
organisms manage to infect the susceptible hosts
through the medium of fomites in certain cases
and human carriers in others. Contamination of
food, water and in a few cases, the air has also
been
implicated
in
outbreaks
of
hospital
infections.
Invasive Devices
Modern healthcare employs many types of inva-
sive devices and procedures to treat patients and
help them recover. Infections can be associated
with the devices used in medical procedures,
implants and prostheses. These include central
line-associated
bloodstream
infections
(CLABSIs), catheter-associated UTIs and venti-
lator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Antibiotics Resistance
The infectious agents present in the hospital envi-
ronment also possess the dubious distinction of
being more difﬁcult to treat as they are usually
resistant to a range of commonly used drugs. The
initial resistant strains of bacteria are present in
large numbers due to the constant selection pres-
sure exerted because of the necessary antibiotic
usage inside the hospitals, and these then spread,
replacing the other strains in the hospital.
Diagnostic or Therapeutic Procedures
Diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, such as
the insertion of intravenous or urethral catheters,
may
introduce
the
infection
to
susceptible
patients and cause iatrogenic infections. There is
a good chance that the patient’s ﬂora causes
infections as many invasive procedures are car-
ried out within the hospitals, which exposes them
to this risk.
Transfusion
Transfusion of blood, blood products and intrave-
nous ﬂuids, if not properly screened, may trans-
mit blood-borne pathogens to the recipients who
are hospitalised.
Epidemiology of Healthcare-Associated
Infection
Sources of Infections
The sources of healthcare-acquired infection may
be exogenous or endogenous.
Exogenous Infection
It is most important and occurs mostly from
(1) another patient, (2) a member of the medical
and paramedical staff harbouring the pathogens
or (3) from the environment. The latter includes
inanimate objects, such as medical equipment
(e.g. catheters, endoscopes, cystoscopes, etc.),
bedpans
and
surfaces
contaminated
by
the
patient’s secretions, excretions, blood and other
body ﬂuids. It includes hospital food, water and
environmental air.
Endogenous Infection
It is due to microbes present in the patient’s ﬂora
present in the body. Microorganisms from these
ﬂora may cause infections in different patient
tissues during certain surgical operations, manip-
ulation by instruments or nursing procedures.
Microorganisms Causing Infections
Initially, much of the hospital outbreaks were
caused by Gram-positive organisms like Strepto-
coccus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant S.
aureus
(MRSA).
Currently,
Gram-negative
enteric pathogens, including E. coli, Klebsiella,
Enterobacter species, etc., have emerged as
important causes of these infections.
Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species are
also common nosocomial pathogens because
they can survive as saprophytes in the environ-
ment and are extremely hardy, developing resis-
tance to most of the commonly used antibiotics
and in some cases managing to grow even inside

bottles of disinfectant solutions. Candida auris has
been causing severe illness in hospitalised patients.
Clostridioides difﬁcile causes diarrhoea and fever
due to the overuse of antibiotics. Viruses like
hepatitis, HIV and noroviruses are also implicated
in healthcare-associated infections.
1028
70
Healthcare-Associated Infections
The new and emerging pathogens have several
features in common. a) They survive for a long
period in the hospital environment; b) they are
resistant to commonly used antibiotics and
disinfectants and c) they cause both endemic
and epidemic hospital outbreaks, resulting in sig-
niﬁcant patient morbidity and mortality.

Common Types of Healthcare-Associated Infections
1029
Transmission of Microorganisms
Several organisms enter the body surface either
by evasion or breaching the body’s self-defence.
These include epithelial integrity breaching such
as wounds from surgeries, drain tubes and intra-
vascular cannulas, failure to wash the body ﬂuids
(e.g. infections from the urinary catheter) and
intervention with respiratory defences like anaes-
thesia effects. Infections can be transmitted in
various ways.
Airborne Transmission
Infections
may
be
transmitted
by
airborne
droplets, dust particles and aerosols. Inhalation
of airborne droplets or droplets’ nuclei transmits
M. tuberculosis and many other respiratory
pathogens.
Hospital
dust
generated
from
beddings, hospital ﬂoors, from the skin by natural
shedding of skin scales are rich sources of many
pathogens, such as S. aureus, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, etc. Therefore, inhalation of these
infective
dust
particles
transmits
infections.
Aerosols produced by nebulisers, humidiﬁers
and air conditioning apparatus transmit certain
pathogens, such as Legionella pneumophila.
Transmission by Direct Contact
Direct contact is the principal transmission route
of healthcare-associated infections. Direct contact
with the hands and clothing of medical personnel
harbouring microorganisms may transmit infec-
tion from one person to another. S. aureus and
S. pyogenes are two important pathogens trans-
mitted by hand contact. The certain pathogen,
such as P. aeruginosa, can also be transmitted
by contact with certain hospital instruments
(e.g. endoscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopies,
etc.) if not properly disinfected.
Transmission by Oral Route
Hospital foods served to hospitalised patients
may transmit certain gastrointestinal pathogens.
The food may be the source of antibiotic-resistant
P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and other
pathogens. These pathogens may colonise the
intestine and later cause infection in susceptible
patients.
Transmission by Parenteral Route
Blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C
and HIV (human immunodeﬁciency virus), may
be transmitted by transfusion of blood or blood
products through contaminated needles or sharp
instruments
that
have
not
been
properly
disinfected.
People
with
long-term
care
in
hospital
facilities are prone to several infections. Some
factors which play an important role in the initia-
tion of infection are age, prolonged medical
conditions, staying with catheters, living in a
closed community and moving between hospitals
and care facilities. Respiratory tract infections,
urinary tract infections (UTIs), gastroenteritis
and scabies outbreaks have been reported. Evi-
dence from the MRSA suggests increased con-
cern regarding the organisms that spread from
hospitals to the community at large, speciﬁcally
involving prolonged care facilities, such as
nursing homes, thereby causing a more serious
health problem in the community.
Common Types
of Healthcare-Associated Infections
Common types of hospital infections can be
grouped as follows:
Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract
Infections (CAUTI)
Catheter-associated
urinary
tract
infections
(CAUTI) account for 40–45% of nosocomial
infections. These infections are the major source
of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial
strains in hospitals, though it contributes only to
10–15% of an extended stay in hospital. Most of
the nosocomial UTIs are due to instrumentation,
bladder catheters. There is a 3–10% of infection
risk each day. The most common pathogens caus-
ing UTI are E. coli, nosocomial Gram-negative
bacilli, enterococci and Candida.

1030
70
Healthcare-Associated Infections
CAUTI is usually caused by pathogens that
spread the periurethral space from the patient’s
perineum or gastrointestinal tract, which is seen
most commonly in women. Contamination of
urinary catheters intraluminally causes this infec-
tion. This is mainly due to cross-infection by
healthcare workers who irrigate catheters or
empty the bags. Sometimes the pathogens are
transmitted from improper disinfected urological
equipment. There is also a chance this comes
from a contaminated supply (e.g. dilute aqueous
benzalkonium chloride).
Patients with a catheter in place may develop
infection and complain of fever, urinary tract
discomfort and peri catheter discharge. Urinary
tract infection is the common symptom after the
removal of the catheter. Antimicrobial therapy is
not
necessarily
required
to
treat
catheter-
associated asymptomatic bacteriuria. However,
immunocompromised individuals and patients
under urological surgery should be exempted.
The gastrointestinal and vaginal carriage may be
responsible for asymptomatic catheter-associated
candiduria.
If catheter-related symptoms are reported, the
catheter must be removed immediately, urine cul-
ture should be done if possible, and if the infec-
tion is diagnosed, then an antibiotic course must
be administered. There are chances for the organ-
ism to persist even after the antibiotic course with
just relief in symptoms if the catheter is still kept
in. When the catheter is still kept in, and the
antibiotic is administered, there are chances for
the organism to emerge as an antibiotic-resistant
organism.
Health-Care Associated Bacteremia
(Bloodstream Infection)
Central Line-Associated Bloodstream
Infections (CLABSIs)
Central line-associated bloodstream infections
(CLABSIs) are commonly caused by infected
intravenous cannula, which may be a conse-
quence of infections at any site. The longer the
cannula are in contact, the greater is the risk of
infection. Central line-associated bloodstream
infection (CLABSI) is deﬁned as a laboratory-
conﬁrmed bloodstream infection not related to
an infection at another site that develops within
48 h of central line placement. After central
venous catheter placement, bacteria on the skin
surface migrate along the external surface of the
catheter from the skin exit site towards the intra-
vascular
space.
Contamination
of
the
hub
(intraluminal) hematogenous seeding of bacteria
from a contaminated infusate or another source is
some of the mechanisms of CLABSI. The femo-
ral central venous catheters are associated with
the highest risk of CLABSI, followed by the
internal jugular and subclavian catheters.
Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections
(CRBSI)
Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)
is
deﬁned
as
the
presence
of
bacteraemia
originating from an intravenous catheter. CRBSI
is a clinical deﬁnition used when diagnosing and
treating patients that require speciﬁc laboratory
testing that more thoroughly identiﬁes the cathe-
ter as the source of the BSI. It is not typically used
for
surveillance
purposes.
Following
microbiological methods are used to detect
(1) quantitative paired blood culture, (2) differen-
tial time to positivity and (3) semiquantitative
culture of the catheter tip.
Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) accounts
for 15–20% of healthcare-associated infections.
Hospital-acquired oropharyngeal ﬂora or endoge-
nous aspiration is the major cause of most bacte-
rial nosocomial pneumonia infections. A majority
of the deaths are reported due to nosocomial
pneumonia more than any other body site
infections. Deaths resulting from nosocomial
pneumonia are inﬂuenced by antibiotic treatment
inadequacy, comorbidities and speciﬁc pathogen
involvement,
speciﬁcally
Acinetobacter
and
P. aeruginosa. Examination and laboratory diag-
nosis of pneumonia become a major concern in
hospitals because of a large number of patients.
Diagnosis is even more difﬁcult for those in

intensive care units due to deteriorating body
conditions
such
as
fever,
abnormal
chest
roentgenographs and leucocytosis.
Common Types of Healthcare-Associated Infections
1031
Risk factors are many for ventilator-associated
pneumonia. Occasions that increase the danger of
colonisation by potential pathogens decrease gas-
tric acidity, ventilator circuits or equipment
contaminations and previous antimicrobial ther-
apy. Aspiration of oropharyngeal substances into
the lower respiratory tract may be increased by
following processes such as usage of a nasogas-
tric tube, intubation and decreased levels of con-
sciousness. The host defence mechanism of the
lung is reduced, which allows the overgrowth of
the aspirated pathogens caused by diseases such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the
result of upper abdominal surgery and factors of
old age.
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)
Community-acquired pathogens such as Strepto-
coccus pneumoniae and Haemophilus species
cause
Hospital-acquired
pneumonia

manifesting within the ﬁrst 4 days of hospital
care.
Pathogens
like
Enterobacter
species,
S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa
and Acinetobacter species cause late-onset of
pneumonia. This results in increasing concern
for many ICUs. Infection is polymicrobial in as
many as 20–40% of cases. The role of anaerobic
bacteria in ventilator-associated pneumonia is not
well deﬁned. The appropriate duration of therapy
for ventilator-associated pneumonia, although it
usually ranges from 10 to 21 days, is not well
studied.
Surgical Site Infections (SSI)
Thirty per
cent
of all healthcare-associated
infections are due to infections from surgical
wounds. These infections are common in 10%
of patients who have had clean surgery. The fre-
quency of the infections varies with surgery
complexity, surgical skills and inherent patient
risk. Contamination of the surgical wound is the
primary cause of most surgical site infections.
The contamination may be due to the patient’s
ﬂora or from the environment during the surgical
procedures or the personnel in the operating
room. Haematogenous seeding of the wound site
is not common in post-operative cases.
Infections
of
the
surgical
wound
are
characterised by a few common clinical features
such as redness, pain in the site and discharge. If
there is a fever within 4 weeks after surgery with
no other localising features, it may be caused by
surgical site infection. Infection of the external
wound
may
be
healed
with
or
without
administering
antibiotics.
Surgical
drainage,
imaging and antimicrobial therapy with the help
of culture are required for diagnosing organ space
and deep infection.
Organisms that are responsible for causing
surgical wound infections depend on the location
and type of surgery. MRSA is the most common
cause in some hospitals. Gram-negative bacilli
(e.g. E. coli) are more common infection causes
following gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract
surgery.
Healthcare-Associated Infections Due
to Hepatitis Viruses B and C
Hepatitis viruses B and C infections are of serious
risk for surgeons and healthcare workers from
cardiac surgery and dialysis units and unvacci-
nated healthcare personnel. It is also a major risk
for patients receiving blood transfusions or
undergoing renal dialysis. At the time of any
surgical or dental procedures, healthcare workers
who are carriers of HBV pose a risk of transmis-
sion to the patients. The transmission of HCV
from patients to healthcare personnel has been
widely documented. With widespread awareness
of screening for hepatitis surface antigen (HbsAg)
and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, there is a
reduced
risk
of
acquiring
such
infections,
although there are other predisposing factors.

Adherence to strict aseptic conditions may further
reduce the risk for healthcare workers.

Healthcare-Associated Infections
Healthcare-Associated Episodes
of Tetanus
The use of contaminated/infected or improperly
sterilised sutures and dressing materials may
cause this infection. It can also be caused by
improper disinfection of the site of intramuscular
injections (in the gluteal region) and if adequate
measures
are
not
taken
while
cutting
the
newborn’s umbilical cord.
Healthcare-Associated Episodes
of Acute Gastroenteritis
Outbreaks of Salmonella spp., causing food poi-
soning,
contamination
of
cooked
food
by
enterotoxins produced by Staphylococci spp.
and few enteroviruses, Shigella ﬂexneri, Shigella
dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, E. coli (in children
and neonates) and Clostridium difﬁcile are com-
mon healthcare-associated episodes of acute
gastroenteritis.
Antibiotics Associated Diarrhoea
Antibiotic-associated
diarrhoea
(AAD)
arises
when the antibiotic disrupts the ecology of the
intestinal microbiota by altering the diversity and
numbers of bacteria in the gut. These changes can
affect the capacity of the resident microbiota to
resist the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms
or the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens spe-
cies
that
are
endogenously
present
in
the
microbiota. C. difﬁcile is held to be the causative
agent of approximately 20% of AAD. AAD is
most frequently associated with cephalosporins,
clindamycin and broad-spectrum penicillin, like
amoxycillin
and
piperacillin.
Treatment
of
antibiotic-associated diarrhoea involves discon-
tinuation of the offending antibiotics and oral
metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is used for
severe cases of AAD.
Needlestick and Sharps Injury
Healthcare professionals at the highest risk for
needlestick injuries are surgeons, emergency
room workers, laboratory room professionals
and nurses. In most cases, needlestick injuries
occur chieﬂy because of unsafe practices and
gross negligence on the part of the healthcare
workers. The most important organisms that can
be acquired after a needlestick injury include
HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Tetanus should
always be considered when a needlestick injury
has occurred, and the patient’s vaccination history
must be obtained.
Prevention of Needlestick and Sharps
Injury
These
include
various
approaches
such
as
(1)
eliminating
unnecessary
needle
use,
(2) using devices with safety features, (3) devel-
oping safe work practices for handling needles
and other sharp devices and (4) safely disposing
of sharps and blood-contaminated materials.
Needlestick Injury Management
This comprises immediate management, postex-
posure treatment and laboratory follow-up of
cases.
Immediate Management
It includes washing with soap and running water
and avoiding the use of antiseptics or skin
washes. All needlestick/sharp injuries must be
reported to the hospital infection control ofﬁcer.
Postexposure Treatment (PEP)
The decision to start PEP is made based on the
degree of exposure to HIV and the HIV status of
the source from where the exposure/infection has
occurred. More so, it should begin as soon as
possible, preferably within 2 h, and is not
recommended after 72 h. Postexposure prophy-
laxis for HIV involves the use of three antivirals
for 4 weeks.
If the patient is HBsAg positive, the recipient’s
serology must be assessed. If the post-vaccination
anti-HBs level is high (greater than 10 mIU/mL),

this is known to be protective. However, if the
post-vaccination
anti-HBs
titre
is
low,
the
healthcare worker should be administered hepati-
tis B immunoglobulin, and if the healthcare
worker is not vaccinated against hepatitis B,
then a course of active immunisation starting
14 days later should be given. If the patient is
HBsAg negative, the healthcare workers need to
be observed, and his or her anti-HBs levels should
be monitored.
Common Types of Healthcare-Associated Infections
1033
Laboratory Follow-up of Cases
Exposed persons should have post-PEP HIV
tests. HIV test at 3 months and again at 6 months
is recommended. If the test at 6 months is nega-
tive, no further testing is recommended.
Diagnosis of Healthcare-Associated
Infections
Diagnosis of healthcare-associated infections is
made by routine bacteriological methods, such
as direct demonstration of microorganisms in
specimens by microscopy, isolation by culture
and testing bacterial isolates for their antibiotics’
sensitivity pattern. The specimens are usually
sampled from possible sources of infections,
such as environment, inanimate objects, water,
air, food, hospital personnel, etc. The source of
infection may be traced by performing phage
typing, bacteriocin typing, biotyping or molecular
typing.
Prevention and Control of Health
Care-Associated Infections
One-third of healthcare-associated infections can
be prevented. Effective prevention means achiev-
ing the two of the objectives. First is, the devel-
opment of antibiotic-resistant organisms should
be arrested, and second is that resistant organisms
spread between patients should be prevented.
There are well-known principles that help in
preventing hospital-acquired organisms spread.
Every hospital has a customised approach to pre-
vent acquired infections; it might be based on the
available resources or the organism’s epidemiol-
ogy. For example, the most important measures
for preventing catheter-associated UTIs are: i) the
placement of catheters only when necessary and
not solely for the convenience of caregivers, ii)
the use of the aseptic technique for catheter inser-
tion and urinary tract instrumentation, iii) the
manipulation and opening of drainage systems
as infrequently as possible and iv) the removal
of catheters as soon as feasible.
Various approaches have been made to mini-
mise the risk of surgical wound infections. These
include a smaller number of preoperative stays in
hospitals,
antibiotic
prophylaxis,
optimising
patient’s risk factors and monitoring surgical site
infections with timely feedback given to the
physician’s teams. Components of a program to
prevent
health-care-associated
infection
are
many. These are listed in Table 70.3.
Intubation and mechanical ventilation increase
the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia and
therefore need to be avoided, or their duration of
use needs to be reduced whenever possible. Lim-
iting the use of sedative and paralytic agents that
depress
cough
and
other
host-protective
mechanisms and maintaining endotracheal cuff
pressure at greater than 20-cm H2O helps to
reduce aspiration pneumonia. Continuous aspira-
tion of subglottic secretions, through the use of a
specially designed endotracheal tube, has signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the incidence of early-onset VAP.
For reducing the incidence of CLABSI,
precautions include: (1) following hand hygiene
and following aseptic techniques, (2) handling
and maintaining central lines appropriately and
(3) promptly removing unnecessary central lines.
Standard Precautions
It is a known fact that almost all living beings are
likely to harbour infectious agents. Standard
precautions are the basic infection processes that

apply to every patient despite perceived or con-
ﬁrmed infectious status in any setting where
healthcare is delivered. These precautions achieve
a basic level of infection prevention and control in
any healthcare
setting. Adaptation of these
precautions may help prevent or reduce the possi-
bility of transmission of infectious agents from
one person or place to another.

Infection Control Committee
In the twenty-ﬁrst century, the speciality of infec-
tion control requires an extent of expertise that no
sole practitioner can possess. Therefore, every
hospital should have an infection control commit-
tee. The major responsibilities of the committee
are the control of hospital-acquired infection and
the monitoring of hygienic practices in the hospi-
tal. The committee is a multi-disciplinary team
consisting
of
clinicians,
infection
control
practitioners, a hospital epidemiologist, a biostat-
istician, a medical records ofﬁcer, an infectious
diseases physician, a blood bank ofﬁcer and a
microbiologist. The medical superintendent usu-
ally chairs the committee, with the medical micro-
biologist being the member secretary.
The committee (1) regularly reviews the infec-
tion control activities of the hospital, (2) monitors
the emergence of drug resistance, (3) formulates
the
antibiotics
policy
of
the
hospital,
(4) recommends suitable sterilisation and disin-
fection procedures in a hospital and (5) maintains
data on the incidence and types of infections and
antibiotics susceptibility patterns of the common
prevalent pathogens.
Active Surveillance
for Healthcare-Associated Infections
Strict surveillance of the hospital is the key to
successful hospital infection control. To achieve
this, measures such as high-quality data collec-
tion, data analysis and timely feedback to
healthcare practitioners are essential. The surveil-
lance system of the hospital should be potential,
targeted, adjusted to risk, should validate methods
and deﬁnitions and also should validate hospital
to hospital comparison.
Usage
of
molecular
methods
has
been
contributing immensely to hospital infection sur-
veillance. These molecular methods are used to
identify the type of organisms and to clear the
polyclonal
or
clonal
character
of
evident
outbreaks. Few strains of MRSA have been
found to cause endemic infections and are con-
ﬁrmed through molecular testing.
Hand Hygiene
Hands become an important source of infectious
agents
by
contact
with
a
patient
or
their
surrounding
environment
or
from
other
healthcare workers. To reduce the risk of cross-
contamination, practising a few hand hygiene
precautions are advised before every episode of
patient contact (including caring between patients
and between various procedures for the same

patient) and after any activity or contact that may
result in hands becoming contaminated (such as
removal of gloves).
Common Types of Healthcare-Associated Infections
1035
Good hand hygiene practice includes alcohol-
based hand rubs, handwashing with soap and
clean water and single-use clean towels. The 5
Moments for Hand Hygiene approach was
designed by the World Health Organization to
minimise
the
risk
of
transmission
of
microorganisms among a healthcare worker, the
patient and the environment. It states that hand
hygiene is very much essential in situations
such as: (1) before touching a patient, (2) before
a procedure (e.g. placing an intravenous line or
preparing an injection), (3) after a procedure or
body substance, body ﬂuid or excretions or
wound dressings exposure risk, (4) after touching
a patient and (5) after touching a patient’s imme-
diate surroundings (Fig. 70.1).
Hand hygiene is also followed when caring
between various procedures on different body
sites of the same patient and after removing
gloves.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to the
use of wearable equipment to protect the mucous
membranes, skin and clothing of health workers
from exposure to or contact with infectious
agents. These include a variety of wearable
PPEs, such as aprons, gowns, gloves, surgical
masks, protective eyewear/goggles
and face
shields.
The
selection
of
a
proper
PPE
depends on: (1) nature of the patient to be exam-
ined, (2) possibility of exposure to body ﬂuids,
(3) known or possible infectious agents and
(4) and/or the likely modes of transmission of
infection.
While using the PPE, (1) apron/gown has to be
worn to protect skin and clothing when close
contact is expected with the patient, materials or
equipment, and where there is a risk of contami-
nation with blood, body substances, secretions or
excretions, (2) the same gown should not be worn
while caring between different patients, (3) during
procedures that can cause splashes of blood or
other body ﬂuids, the mouth, nose and eye pro-
tection must be worn and (4) mask should be in
place when placing a catheter or injecting
materials into the spinal canal or subdural space;
masks should be changed when they become
soiled or wet.
The sequence for putting on (Donning) per-
sonal protective equipment (PPE) includes gown,
mask or respirator, goggles or face shield and
gloves. The sequence for removing on (Dofﬁng)
PPE include gloves, goggles or face shield, gown,
mask or respirator and washing hands or using an
alcohol-based hand sanitiser immediately after
removing all PPE.
Hand hygiene is followed between steps if
hands become contaminated and immediately
after removing all PPE.
Injection Safety
These are simple measures intended to prevent
the transmission of infectious diseases between
patients or between a patient and a healthcare
worker during the preparation and administration
of medication. Injection safety is a must to be
followed in a hospital setup. It is recommended
that before injecting a device into a medication
vial, the diaphragms should be cleaned with 70%
alcohol, and the same syringe should not be used
between multiple patients, even if the needle is
changed. The syringe should never be reused in a
medication vial. Single-use or single-dose vials,
bags or bottles of intravenous solution should not
be administered for more than a patient; where
possible, multi-dose vials should be used for a
single patient and ﬂuid infusions or intravenous
tubing should not be used for more than a single
patient.
Environmental Cleaning
This refers to the removal of soil or other organic
contaminants from a device or environmental
surfaces (beds, bedrails and other frequently
touched surfaces, etc.) using the physical actions
of scrubbing with a surfactant or detergent and
water with appropriate chemicals. These cleaning
procedures remove a large number of microbes
from the surface and are always essential to be
performed before disinfection. Compared to
sterilisation, disinfection is considered a less
toxic process capable of eliminating almost all

known pathogens, but it may not be helpful in the
inactivation of spores.
Common Types of Healthcare-Associated Infections
1037
Medical Equipment
Adequate care is ensured while using any medical
equipment, reusable, recyclable or single-use.
Those instruments marked as single-use by the
manufacturer
need
to
be
used
only
once;
re-processing of these instruments should be
strictly restricted. Reusable or recyclable equip-
ment
(e.g.
blood
glucose
meter,
surgical
instruments,
etc.)
need
to
be
cleaned
and
re-processed appropriately while using between
multiple patients.
Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette
Control measures must be implemented to pre-
vent infection at the ﬁrst point of encounter with
the
facility
and
or
ambulatory
settings.
Individuals visiting healthcare facilities with any
signs of cough, sneeze, congestion, rhinorrhoea
and increased respiratory secretions should be
identiﬁed and monitored. When coughing/sneez-
ing, the mouth/nose should be covered with tissue
or
a
mask
when
coughing/sneezing.
Hand
hygiene has to be performed if contacted with
respiratory secretions (Fig. 70.2).
Fig. 70.2 Etiquettes of
sneezing and coughing
Isolation Precautions
Isolation precautions are needed to prevent the
transmission
of
pathogenic
microorganisms
within the healthcare setting. Patients infected
with
COVID-19,
severe
inﬂuenza
cases,
Sub-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), open
case of tuberculosis, anthrax, diphtheria, pertus-
sis, pneumonic plague, chickenpox and patients
infected
with
multidrug-resistant
bacterial
pathogens require isolation. Appropriate patient
placement is decided based on route(s) of trans-
mission of the infectious agent. Use of appropri-
ate
personal
protective
equipment
should
be made.
Precautions in Operating Theatre
The conventional or plenum type ventilation
maintains approximately 20 air changes per hour
in operating theatres. However, there may be as
many as 300 air changes per hour in laminar ﬂow-
based operating theatres. The bacteria-carrying
particles per cubic metre or bioload should not
exceed 35–180 while empty or during operation,
respectively. Airborne organisms or colony-
forming units (cfu) typically occur between

150 and 300 cfu/m3 in conventional operating
theatres and 10 cfu/m3 for the laminar ﬂow
ventilations.
1038
70
Healthcare-Associated Infections
Investigation and Follow-up Outbreaks
of Disease
Even if strict preventive measures are followed,
outbreaks associated with healthcare infections
may occur. When such outbreaks occur in any
area of the hospital, immediate investigations are
required to resolve (1) if there has been a single
common source of the pathogen, for example,
food served at a speciﬁc meal; (2) if carriers
providing a continuous reservoir of an infectious
agent are responsible for outbreak and (3) if, in
affected areas, there is any deviation from the
daily protocol or general preventive measures.

Infective Syndromes: A System
and Organ-Based Approach
71
‘Infective syndrome’ is synonymous with the
term
‘Syndromic
infection’.
An
infection
manifesting as a single syndrome could be caused
by a single pathogen or many different pathogens.
Conversely, many clinical syndromes could be
caused by a single pathogen.
Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO)
An increase in body temperature which is above
the normal daily variation accompanied by an
increase in hypothalamic set point is deﬁned as
fever. On the other hand, when there is an uncon-
trolled elevation of temperature over and above
the normal ability of the human body to lose heat
but with unchanged hypothalamic set point, it is
termed hyperthermia (Fig. 71.1).
Definition
Peters Dorf and Beeson deﬁned pyrexia of
unknown origin (PUO) in 196l as ‘(1) body tem-
perature of more than 38.3 C (>101 F) on
several occasions, (2) duration of fever of more
than 3 weeks and (3) failure to reach a diagnosis
despite one week of inpatient investigation’.
Durack and Street classiﬁed PUO into four
types: (1) classic PUO, (2) nosocomial PUO,
(3) neutropenic PUO and (4) PUO associated
with HIV infection (Table 71.1).

1039
Aetiologies of PUO
PUOs are most often due to infections (30–40%).
Other conditions responsible for the condition are
neoplasms (20–30%), collagen vascular diseases
(10–20%) and miscellaneous diseases (15–20%).
Infections
Infections are the most common causes of PUO,
especially in more than 50% of children suffering
from PUO. In adults, infection accounts for
30–45% of cases of PUO. The infectious causes
of PUO are summarised in Table 71.2.
Neoplasms
These include malignant conditions such as colon
cancers, gall bladder carcinoma, hepatoma, vari-
ous
types
of
lymphomas
and
leukaemias,
lymphomatoid
granulomatosis,
malignant
histiocytosis, pancreatic cancer, renal cell carci-
noma, sarcoma and benign condition such as
atrial myxoma.
Collagen Vascular Diseases
These include adult Still’s disease, Bechet dis-
ease, giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatic,


hypersensitivity
pneumonitis,
hypersensitivity
vasculitis,
mixed
connective
tissue
disease,
polyarteritis nodosa, relapsing polychondritis,
rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
lupus
erythematosus,

Granulomatous
diseases include Crohn’s disease, granulomatous
hepatitis, midline granuloma and sarcoidosis.

Laboratory Diagnosis
The correct diagnosis of PUO is essential in deal-
ing successfully with PUO. Because of many
possible
causes
of
PUO,
the
diagnostic
approaches are divided into various stages.
Stage I
This includes a comprehensive history, analysis
of fever and use of routine investigations such as
a complete haemogram, chest radiograph, etc.
Stage II
This includes the use of speciﬁc diagnostic tests
and other non-invasive investigations. The spe-
ciﬁc tests include (a) direct examination of blood
for
malaria,
ﬁlariasis
and
relapsing
fever;
(b) blood, urine, sputum, body ﬂuid, pus, etc.,
for culture and (c) serological tests for diagnosis
of brucellosis, tularensis, Salmonella, rickettsial
infections, CMV (cytomegalovirus) and EBV
(Epstein–Barr
virus)
infections.
These
also
include serological tests for detection of antinu-
clear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic anti-
body,
rheumatoid
factor
and
serum
cryoglobulins for ruling out other collagen vascu-
lar diseases and vasculitis.

Stage III
This includes invasive tests such as a liver biopsy
to demonstrate miliary tuberculosis and meta-
static carcinomas, bone marrow biopsy for dem-
onstration of miliary tuberculosis, or typhoid
fever, etc.
Treatment
Treatment includes speciﬁc treatment by drugs if
the aetiology is known. It also includes therapeu-
tic
trials
with
corticosteroids
prostaglandin
inhibitors for non-infectious causes of PUO.
Empiric treatment with antibiotics or cytotoxic
drugs is less warranted; however, antitubercular
drugs are given in suspected tuberculosis cases
without microbial evidence.
Respiratory Tract Infections
Of several aetiology syndromic infections, respi-
ratory tract infections are among the most com-
mon ones prevalent worldwide, with substantial
morbidity and mortality, especially in the two
extremes of age. Both upper and lower respiratory
tracts
are
prone
to
infections
by
different
microbes, viz., bacteria, rickettsia, viruses, fungi
and protozoa. Some microbes cause both upper
and lower respiratory infections.

Adenoviruses
Echoviruses
Based on the site involved, respiratory tract
infections may be classiﬁed as upper respiratory
tract infection (URI) and lower respiratory tract
infection (LRI). The treatment modalities are dif-
ferent for both.
Definitions
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI)
The upper respiratory tract infection can be
deﬁned as an infection occurring above the glottis
or vocal cords, although some authorities think
that any infection above the cricoid cartilage
qualiﬁes as URI. Normally the infection involves
the nose, sinuses, pharynx and larynx.
Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRI)
Lower respiratory tract infection is deﬁned as an
infection of the trachea, and the structures beyond
it which include the bronchi, bronchioles and
lungs
proper.
The
severity
of
lower
tract
infections
is
much
more
than
upper
tract
infections. It is the leading cause of death
among all infectious diseases. The two most com-
mon LRIs are bronchitis and pneumonia.
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI)
The upper respiratory tract includes the epiglottis,
larynx, pharynx, oropharynx, etc. It is lined with
squamous epithelium and continues with mucosal
linings
of
sinuses,
Eustachian
tubes
and
middle ear.
The upper respiratory tract diseases are named
according to the anatomical site involved. These
include common cold, laryngitis, laryngotracheo-
bronchitis, epiglottitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and
peritonsillar abscesses.
Aetiology
The common cold is the most common clinical
condition affecting the upper respiratory tract.
The condition is usually self-limiting and is
caused mostly by viruses (Table 71.3). Acute
sore throat, which is pharyngitis or tonsillitis, is
also mostly caused by viruses. Nearly, 30% of the
condition
is
caused
by
bacteria
and
other
pathogens (Table 71.4). In sore throat, viruses
and bacteria produce similar manifestations.
These are pain during deglutination, inﬂamed
pharynx and tonsils, cervical lymphadenopathy
and fever. The causative agents of laryngitis,
laryngotracheobronchitis
and
epiglottitis
are
summarised in Table 71.5.
Diphtheria is an important cause of childhood
disease, with very high mortality and morbidity.
Vaccination has greatly minimised both morbid-
ity and mortality. Despite this, diphtheria is
re-emerging, and cases have been reported now
in India and other countries.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Throat swab from fauces, nasopharynx, etc., is
the specimen of choice. Cotton dacron or calcium
alginate-tipped swabs are suitable for collecting
these
specimens.
Moist
swabs
need
to
be
transported and processed within 4 h. However,
transport media like Amies and Regan–Lowe
transport medium can be used if a delay is
anticipated.
Gram Staining
It is useful to identify budding yeast like Candida,
Gram-negative
spirochetes
such
as
Borrelia
vincenti and Fusobacterium spp. Gram staining,

however, is unreliable for the detection of other
causative agents of pharyngitis. Albert staining
is useful for presumptive identiﬁcation of Cory-
nebacterium diphtheriae by demonstrating green-
coloured bacilli with bluish-black metachromatic
granules arranged in a Chinese letter pattern.

used to demonstrate pinpoint beta-haemolytic
colonies
of
Streptococcus
pyogenes
after
24–48 h of incubation at 37 C in 5–10% CO2.
Lofﬂer serum slope and potassium tellurite
media are used to isolate C. diphtheriae. Freshly
prepared
Bordet–Gengou
medium
inoculated
directly at the bedside is useful for demonstrating
small, shiny, mercury-drops like colonies of
Bordetella
pertussis.
chocolate
agar
and
Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) are used for
isolation of Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and Candida
spp., respectively. Neisseria gonorrhoeae on
modiﬁed
Thayer–Martin
medium
produces
small, greyish white, convex and translucent
colonies on incubation in the presence of 5–10%
CO2. Identiﬁcation of the bacteria is based on
colony
morphology,
typical
morphology
on
Gram-stained smears of the bacteria, biochemical
tests, toxigenicity tests, etc.
Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Test
It is a rapid method for detecting C. diphtheriae
and B. pertussis directly in clinical specimens.
Treatment
Treatment of the condition depends on the bacte-
ria causing the disease. For example, penicillin,
erythromycin, etc., are used to treat sore throat

caused by S. pyogenes, and penicillin is also
useful for the treatment of diphtheria caused by
C. diphtheriae.
Respiratory Tract Infections
1045
Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRI)
The
lower
respiratory
tract
(LRI)
infection
involves the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and
lungs. It can be acute or chronic. Acute LRI
includes acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of
chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis (in the paediatric
age group) and pneumonia. Chronic infections
include tuberculosis, aspergillosis, etc.
Types of LRI
The two most common LRIs are bronchitis and
pneumonia.
Aetiology
Bronchitis
Bronchitis may be acute or chronic.
Acute Bronchitis
It normally develops from an innocuous infection
such as common cold and resolves within 1 or
2 weeks. Chronic bronchitis is a more dangerous
condition which develops gradually. Symptoms
may wax or wane but never resolves completely.
Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis
(AECB)
It is a condition which is superimposed on
chronic bronchitis. This manifests as deranged
lung function with features of airﬂow obstruction
and other signs and symptoms.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli, distal
airways and interstitial tissue of the lung, leading
to consolidation. Pneumonia can be broadly
categorised as community-acquired pneumonia
and hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia.
Lobar Pneumonia
It is an acute inﬂammation involving an entire
lung lobe relatively homogeneously. Streptococ-
cus pneumoniae is the causative agent.
Bronchopneumonia
It is a secondary infection usually followed by a
viral infection. This is a patchy consolidation
involving one or several lobes of the lungs.
S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae are the common
causative agents.
Interstitial Pneumonia
It is due to the inﬂammation affecting the lung
interstitial tissue, along with the alveolar walls
and
the
connective
tissue
around
the
bronchovascular tree. The causative agents are
viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia
pneumoniae,
Legionella
pneumophila
and
Coxiella burnetii.
Miliary Pneumonia
It is a condition associated with numerous well-
deﬁned lesions due to the spread of the pathogen
to the lungs via the bloodstream. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis is a pathogen that causes this
condition.
Fever, cough (which may be dry or productive
with purulent or rust-coloured expectoration),
pleuritic chest pain, chills or rigors and dyspnoea
are typical manifestations of pneumonia. One
very useful clinical sign of the severity of pneu-
monia is a respiratory rate more than 30/min in a
person having no other underlying lung disease.
Nosocomial Pneumonia
Nosocomial
pneumonia
or
hospital-acquired
pneumonia (HAP) is one that develops 48 h or
more following hospital admission and which
was not in the incubation period at the time of
admission.
Ventilator-associated
pneumonia
(VAP) is a subtype of HAP which is seen in
intensive care units (ICUs) and is deﬁned as
pneumonia which presents itself 48–72 h after
tracheal intubation in a mechanically ventilated
patient. It has a prevalence of 10–20% in patients
receiving mechanical ventilation. Among patients

in hospital wards who have no associated risk
factors, the pathogens most frequently causing
nosocomial pneumonia include S. pneumoniae,
H. inﬂuenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, enteric
Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella
spp.,
Proteus
spp.
and
Serratia
marcescens) the pathogens causing pneumonia
in immunocompromised patients are summarised
in Table 71.6.

Histoplasma capsulatum
Coccidioides immitis

Chronic Infections
Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic infection
diagnosed by chest radiography and typical clini-
cal presentation like chronic cough, fever, night
sweats, loss of weight and haematological picture
such as elevated ESR, decreased haemoglobin,
etc. Systemic aspergillosis may manifest as pul-
monary, bronchopulmonary and allergic aspergil-
losis. Repeated culture positivity is an important
conﬁrmatory step.
The pathogens causing LRI are listed in
Table 71.7.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Chest radiography is the usual and most common
method for diagnosing pneumonia.
Specimens
Sputum, blood, serum, pleural ﬂuid, etc., are the
frequently used specimens for laboratory diagno-
sis of pneumonia. Sputum collection is best done
in the morning before breakfast. Transtracheal
aspiration, protected specimen brush (PSB) and
bronchoalveolar lavage are the other useful
specimens.
Microscopy
Gram stain is useful in identifying bacteria and
fungi. The specimens may also contain normal
bacterial ﬂora and fungi like Candida albicans. A
careful interpretation is needed. Giemsa stain is
used to diagnose Pneumocystis carinii pneumo-
nia (PCP). Ziehl–Neelsen staining for acid-fast
bacilli is the frequently used method to diagnose
pulmonary tuberculosis.
Culture
Sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, Lowenstein–
Jensen (LJ) media, etc., are used for the culture of
sputum specimens. A sputum sample showing
less than 25 white blood cells and less than
10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power ﬁeld
by microscopy are suitable for culture. An upper
airway colonising organism can be suspected if
the organism is isolated from sputum culture but
similar organism is not found on Gram staining.
The presence of a predominant organism may
suggest a presumptive etiologic diagnosis of
pneumonia.
All patients who are admitted to the hospital
for community-acquired pneumonia should have
at least two sets of blood cultures done before
initiation of antibiotic therapy. S. pneumoniae,
S. aureus and E. coli are the most common
isolates.
Serology
Serodiagnosis depends on the demonstration of
IgM antibody or the demonstration of a fourfold
rise in the titre of IgG antibody between acute-
and convalescent-phase serum samples against a
particular pathogen. Serodiagnosis is used in the
diagnosis
of
pneumonia
caused
by various

–
–
infectious agents. For example, complement ﬁxa-
tion test (CFT) is used for the diagnosis of LRI
caused by adenovirus, parainﬂuenza viruses,
inﬂuenza
virus
A,
M.
pneumoniae
and
C. burnetii; ELISA is a frequently used test diag-
nosis for infections caused by C. pneumoniae and
M. pneumoniae. Rapid microagglutination test is
used for diagnosis of infections caused by
Legionella spp.

antigen in the urine of patients with Legionnaires’
disease and with bacteraemic pneumococcal
pneumonia, respectively
Biomarkers
Serum procalcitonin (PCT), serum prolactin and
CRP
are
a
few
biomarkers
detected
for
supplementing the diagnosis of community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP). Estimation of serum
PCT may help differentiate between bacterial and
non-bacterial causes of infection, using a cut-off
value of 0.5 ng/mL. Furthermore, serum PCT is
useful in predicting bacteraemia and assessing
disease severity in CAP patients.
Molecular Detection
Since bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan cause
respiratory tract infections, the most sensitive and

speciﬁc way of conﬁrming the diagnosis is by
PCR/multiplex PCR. Commercial kits available
using different panels/combinations of panels are
available currently.
1048
71
Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Radiology
Chest X-ray (CXR) is considered the gold stan-
dard for diagnosing pneumonia. The diagnosis of
CAP can be made by the presence of an inﬁltrate
in the lungs on chest imaging in a patient with a
clinically compatible syndrome (e.g. fever, dys-
pnea,
cough
and
sputum
production).
Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs are
helpful for most patients with suspected CAP.
Treatment
Macrolides such as clarithromycin, azithromycin
or doxycycline are antibiotics recommended for
treatment of LRI in an outpatient with no cardio-
pulmonary disease or risk factors. Cefuroxime/
ceftriaxone or cefotaxime or ampicillin/sulbactam
in combination with azithromycin or quinolone
are recommended for treatment of hospitalised
patients with LRI.
Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)
The urinary tract consists of the lower urinary
tract encompassing the urethra and bladder and
the upper urinary tract encompassing the ureters
and kidneys. Infections at various sites of the
urinary tract can manifest simultaneously or in
individual organ and may be asymptomatic or
symptomatic. The female urethral anatomy is of
particular importance; hence, UTI is one of the
most common bacterial infections in females.
Definitions
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
It is deﬁned an infection of the genitourinary tract,
extending from the kidney to the urethra.
Bacteriuria
It is the term that denotes the presence of detect-
able bacteria in urine, whereas pyuria is the term
that indicates the presence of pus in the urine.
Pyuria usually accompanies UTI.
Resident Microbial Flora
The epithelium in the distal portion of the urethra
is colonised with resident ﬂora. The urine of a
healthy individual is generally sterile. The resi-
dent
microbial
ﬂora
of
urine
consists
of
coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans and
non-haemolytic streptococci, diphtheroids, Lac-
tobacillus and saprobic Neisseria spp.
Aetiology
1. Depending on the anatomical sites of infec-
tion, the UTIs can be classiﬁed broadly into
two groups: (1) lower UTIs such as urethritis,
cystitis and prostatitis and (2) upper UTIs such
as acute pyelonephritis and acute pyelitis. The
former is an infection of the parenchyma of the
kidney, whereas the latter is an infection of the
pelvic of the kidney. A single organism mostly
causes UTIs. The causative agents of UTIs are
listed in Table 71.8.
2. Depending on the aetiological agents, UTIs
can also be classiﬁed as community-acquired
UTIs and nosocomial-associated UTIs. The
pathogens causing community-acquired and
hospital-acquired
UTIs
are
listed
in
Table 71.9.
UTIs can also be acute, uncomplicated, usually
seen
in
females,
or
complicated
following
catheterisation, diagnostic instrumentation like
cystoscopy,
anatomical
or
functional
abnormalities of the urinary tract, calculi, obstruc-
tion, immunosuppression, diseases of the kidneys
or diabetes.

Pathogenesis of UTI
UTI is an endogenous infection. It is usually
caused by bacteria which constitute the patient’s
own intestinal ﬂora. These bacteria form the intes-
tinal ﬂora cause an ascending infection by
entering the urinary tract in a retrograde fashion
via the urethra (Fig. 71.2). E. coli, Klebsiella spp.
are intrinsic gut organisms that have ﬁmbriae
(pili) for attachment to the mucosa of the urinary
tract and most of them are motile because of the
presence of ﬂagella.

infections
or
receiving
immunosuppressive
therapy.
Predisposing Factors
These include both host and microbial factors
(Fig. 71.3).
Host Factors
These include the followings:

Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)
1051
Gender and Sexual Activity
Females are more prone to UTI due to the short
urethra (4 cm) which ends below the labia and
also proximity to the anal and perianal areas.
Bacterial infection occurs in the bladder during
sexual intercourse and is linked to the onset of
cystitis, and hence is an important factor in the
pathogenesis of UTIs in sexually active women.
Factors predisposing bacteriuria in men include
urethral obstruction, insertive rectal intercourse,
lack of circumcision and an HIV infection with
CD4+ T cell counts of less than 200 cells/μL.
Pregnancy
In 2–8% of pregnant women, UTI presents in
various ways ranging from asymptomatic bacteri-
uria to pyelonephritis. During pregnancy, tempo-
rary incompetence of the vesicoureteral valves
and decreased ureteral tone and ureteral peristal-
sis are associated with increased susceptibility to
upper UTIs. Additionally, bladder catheterisation
is another important factor for susceptibility dur-
ing or after delivery.
Obstruction
Obstruction to free urine ﬂow due to tumour,
stricture, stone or prostatic hypertrophy may
result in hydronephrosis and a greatly increased
risk of UTI.
Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction
Various conditions like spinal cord injury, tabes
dorsalis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and other
diseases interfering with bladder enervation can
lead to UTI, initiated by catheterisation for blad-
der drainage. The UTI is facilitated due to the
prolonged stasis of urine in the bladder.
Vesicoureteral Reflux
Reﬂux of urine from the urinary bladder cavity
back to the ureters and occasionally to the renal
pelvis happens due to the increased pressure in
the bladder or voiding. Vesicoureteral reﬂux is
common in children with anatomically normal
urinary tracts but is infected.
Genetic Factors
Host genetic factors are associated with an
increased risk of UTI. A history of UTI in the
mother has been frequently found in women who
have recurrent episodes of UTIs compared to the
controls. Bacteria attaching to the uroepithelial
cells are based on the number and type of
receptors that are partly genetically determined.
For example, nearly all strains of E. coli can
attach to the P-positive RBCs due to the presence
of P ﬁmbriae and are found on almost all strains
causing acute pyelonephritis.
Microbial Factors
Various virulence factors of bacteria such as ﬁm-
bria,
haemolysins,
aerobactin
and
ureases
increase the uropathogenicity of bacteria like
E. coli, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. These are
intrinsic gut organisms that have ﬁmbriae (pili)
for attachment to the mucosa of the urinary tract.
Proteus, Morganella and Providencia have
urease enzymes which can split urea and produce
ammonia, thus increasing the urinary pH. This
results in the formation of crystals leading to the
formation of stones. Bioﬁlm produced by certain
bacteria
such
as
staphylococci
facilitates
colonisation of catheters and protects them from
host defences and from the action of antibiotics.
Clinical Syndromes
Frequent urination, pain or burning when passing
urine, fever, dysuria are the most common
symptoms of UTI. Five major types of clinical
manifestations of UTI are recognised as follows:
Urethritis
The condition manifests as symptoms of dysuria,
increased frequency and urgency, which may be
associated with sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs).
Asymptomatic Bacteriuria
It denotes the isolation of a speciﬁc number of
bacteria (colony forming units/ml) from an appro-
priately collected urine specimen from a person

without symptoms or signs of UTI. The presence
of more than 105 organisms per millilitre from a
properly collected midstream ‘clean-catch’ urine
sample indicates signiﬁcant bacteriuria and infec-
tion (Kass concept).
1052
71
Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Cystitis
It is an infection of the urinary bladder. Patients
with cystitis present with dysuria increased fre-
quency, urgency and suprapubic pain. The urine
often becomes grossly cloudy and malodorous
and sometimes bloody.
Acute Urethral Syndrome
Symptoms of dysuria, urgency and frequency
unaccompanied by signiﬁcant bacteriuria are
termed acute urethral syndrome. The condition
primarily occurs in young, and sexually active
women.
Acute Pyelonephritis
The condition refers to inﬂammation of the kid-
ney parenchyma, calyces and pelvis usually
caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms have a
rapid onset and include fever, shaking chills, nau-
sea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Catheter-Associated UTIs
Bacteriuria
develops
in
about
10–15%
of
hospitalised patient with indwelling urethral
catheters. The increased prevalence of UTI in
catheterised patients is associated with the follow-
ing factors: female sex, severe underlying illness,
catheterisation for prolonged period, detachment
of the catheter and drainage tube, other types of
faulty catheter care and lack of systematic antimi-
crobial therapy.
Infection appears as the bacterium goes into
the bladder either (1) by intraluminal route, that
is, by migrating through the static urine in the
catheter lumen or (2) by a periurethral route that
is, by moving up the mucous sheath outside the
catheter.
The incidence of catheter-associated UTIs can
be minimised by many precautionary methods
such as (1) inserting catheters only for right
indications and for the right duration, (2) follow-
ing proper aseptic techniques for urinary catheter
insertion, (3) following aseptic insertion of the
urinary catheter, and maintaining a closed drain-
age system and (4) implementing proper standard
operating procedures and strategies to enhance
appropriate use of indwelling catheters.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimen
Determining the number and type of bacteria in
the urine specimen is an extremely important
diagnostic procedure.
Urine is the specimen used for the diagnosis
of UTI. Prevention of urine contamination by
resident ﬂora is the most important consideration
for urine collection of urine specimens; urine can
be collected in three ways: (1) midstream urine,
(2) catheterised urine and (3) urine collected by
suprapubic aspiration.
Midstream urine is the specimen of choice. It
is collected in sterile containers, preferably before
the administration of antibiotics. Catheterised
urine is usually indicated in post-operative
cases. Urine from a urobag is always avoided.
However, catheterised urine is avoided as far as
possible due to the inherent risk of introducing
infection in hospitalised patients through the
catheters. Suprapubic aspiration is usually car-
ried out to collect urine from infants and also from
adults when uncontaminated urine specimens
cannot
be
obtained
by
other
methods
(Table 71.10).
Urine Microscopy
Microscopy of urine from a symptomatic patient
can reveal useful information. The centrifuged
deposit of urine may show the presence of pus
cells, epithelial cells, RBCs and bacteria. A
Gram-stained smear of uncentrifuged urine is
very useful for assessing microscopic bacteriuria.
This is positive in more than 90% of patients
whose urine samples show a colony count of at
least 105/mL. However, Gram stain is not useful
to detect bacteria with fewer colony counts (102
to 104/mL) in urine specimens. Urine microscopy
constitutes strong evidence of infection caused by
bacteria; however, the non-existence of bacteria

in microscopy need not essentially exclude the
diagnosis.

Microscopical enumeration of pus cells in a
Neubauer chamber is very sensitive indicator of
UTI in symptomatic patients. Pyuria without bac-
teriuria (sterile pyuria) may be due to UTI
caused
by
unusual
bacterial
agents
like
Ureaplasma
urealyticum,
Chlamydia
trachomatis and M. tuberculosis or fungi. Also,
sterile pyuria may be explained in non-infectious
urological conditions such as anatomic abnormal-
ity, calculi, interstitial nephritis, nephrocalcinosis,
vesicoureteral reﬂux or polycystic disease.
Screening Tests
These tests demonstrate the causative bacterial
enzymes or breakdown products of these bacterial
enzymes in urine specimens. These tests also
detect the polymorphonuclear enzyme in the
urine to detect bacteriuria or pyuria.
Griess nitrate test is used to detect urinary
nitrite, an indicator of UTI. Nitrite is a breakdown
product of nitrate due to an enzyme nitrate reduc-
tase produced by bacteria present in urine. Simi-
larly, the leucocyte esterase test demonstrates
leucocyte esterase, an enzyme produced by
inﬂammatory cells that can be detected by the
‘dipstick’ method. In this test, the presence of
catalase in urine is demonstrated by the formation
of bubbles on the addition of hydrogen peroxide,
indicating the presence of catalase-producing
bacteria in the urine. Triphenyl tetrazolium chlo-
ride test (TTC) and glucose test paper are other
tests used for indirect evidence of UTI.
Culture
More than 95% of UTIs are caused by a single
bacterial species. Hence, a culture that shows
mixed bacterial species is contaminated and,
therefore, needs to be repeated. The presence of
squamous epithelial cells in the urine specimen
is
a
good
indicator
of
contamination.
Polymicrobial infections, however, may occur
in
certain
clinical
conditions
that
include
(i) long-term catheterisation, (ii) incomplete blad-
der emptying because of neurologic dysfunction
and (iii) the presence of a ﬁstula between the
urinary tract and the gastrointestinal or genital
tract. A urine culture can be carried out by semi-
quantitative or quantitative methods.
Semiquantitative Methods
The calibrated loop method is a simple, more
rapid, less expensive and fairly satisfactory semi-
quantitative method of urine culture. In this
method,
a
standardised,
calibrated,
4-mm

platinum or chrome wire loop is used to deliver
0.005 mL of uncentrifuged urine. The ﬁxed vol-
ume of uncentrifuged urine is inoculated onto the
blood agar and McConkey agar or CLED agar
(cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deﬁcient agar) by this
calibrated loop. The media after inoculation are
incubated at 37 C for 24 h, after which the total
number of colonies formed on the medium is
counted. The total bacterial count per millilitre
of urine is obtained by multiplying the number
of colonies by 200.

Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Kass in 1956 deﬁned the criterion for determi-
nation of active bacterial infection of the urinary
tract by suggesting the concept of signiﬁcant
bacteriuria as follows:
1. The urine specimen showing more than 105
bacteria/mL is considered signiﬁcant bacteri-
uria and suggests an active bacterial infection
of the urinary tract. The term signiﬁcant bacte-
riuria, however, is applicable only for (1) mid-
stream urine specimen, (2) Gram-negative
bacteria and (3) for the urine specimen col-
lected prior to antibiotics treatment. Isolation
of even a few Gram-positive bacteria such as
staphylococci in urine is signiﬁcant.
2. The urine specimen showing colony count
between 104 and 105 bacteria/mL is considered
as of doubtful signiﬁcance. Hence, the culture
of the same urine specimen is repeated.
3. The urine specimen showing colony count less
than 104 is considered insigniﬁcant. A urine
specimen showing three or more types of
colonies with no predominating organism is
considered a contaminant.
Quantitative Method
The quantitative method is performed by the
pour plate method to count an exact number of
bacteria present in 1 mL of urine. This method,
however, is not used for routine diagnosis of UTI.
Identiﬁcation of bacteria is carried out by colony
character, Gram
stain, motility, biochemical
reactions and serological tests.
Treatment
Treatment of UTI is based on antimicrobial ther-
apy. Cystitis usually responds within 3 days of
treatment, uncomplicated pyelonephritis within
2 weeks of treatment and complicated infections
within 6 weeks of therapy. Intravenous antibiotics
may be required in seriously ill patients, but oral
drugs
are
mostly
effective.
Nitrofurantoin,
norﬂoxacin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides
are the commonly used drugs for community-
acquired UTIs. Higher antibiotics are used for
hospital-acquired and complicated UTIs.
Meningitis
Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is
one
of
the
most
life-threatening
medical
emergencies and hence needs accurate, rapid
diagnosis and prompt treatment.
The brain and spinal cord are protected from
mechanical pressure and infection externally by
the rigid skull and vertebra column and internally
by meninges. The meninges consist of three
layers: (1) dura mater (outermost covering),
(2) arachnoid and (3) pia mater (innermost cover-
ing). They enclose the epidural, subdural and
subarachnoid spaces. The cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) ﬂows in the brain and spinal cord and ﬁlls
the subarachnoid space and ventricles.
Definition
Meningitis
Menigitis is the infection and inﬂammation of the
brain and spinal cord within the subarachnoid
space or throughout the leptomeninges.
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)
This is a group of clinically similar neurologic
manifestations caused by several pathogens such
as viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes,
chemicals/toxins, etc.

Meningitis
1055
Types of Meningitis
Meningitis can be acute, sub-acute or chronic,
depending on the clinical presentation.
Acute Meningitis
This is rapid in onset, and according to the host
response to the causative organism, meningitis
can be pyogenic or aseptic.
Acute pyogenic or purulent meningitis is
characterised by the presence of acute inﬂamma-
tory exudates with an increased count of poly-
morphonuclear cells in the CSF. The causative
agents of acute pyogenic meningitis depend on
the host’s age and other predisposing factors. This
condition
is
caused
mostly
by
bacteria
(Table
71.11).
Neisseria
meningitidis,
S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
are the usual pathogens responsible for causing
meningitis in immunocompromised hosts and
S. pneumoniae, H. inﬂuenzae and group A beta-
haemolytic streptococci in individuals with a bas-
ilar skull fracture. S. aureus and coagulase-
negative
staphylococci,
P.
aeruginosa,
S.
marcescens,
Salmonella
spp.,
etc.,
are
associated with meningitis in patients with head
injury or following post-neurosurgery.

Aseptic meningitis is characterised by the
presence of high lymphocyte count and of other
mononuclear cells in the CSF without the pres-
ence of either bacteria or fungi on culture. It is
mostly caused by viruses and occasionally by
other pathogens (Table 71.12).
Sub-acute Meningitis
Patients with sub-acute meningitis typically suf-
fer from continuous headache, nuchal rigidity,
low-grade fever and restlessness for prolonged
periods before being diagnosed in hospital. The
causative agents are listed in Table 71.13.
Chronic Meningitis
It is characterised by the presence of symptoms
and signs of meningitis for at least 4 weeks.
Table 71.14 lists the causative agents of chronic
meningitis.

Pathogenesis of Meningitis
The blood–brain barrier and blood–CSF barrier
are natural barriers to invasion by the organism.
Microorganisms causing infection of the CNS
overcome these barriers by their virulence factors,
such as capsule, pili, lipopolysaccharide, teichoic
acid, peptidoglycans, IgA proteases, etc. The
organism can invade the CNS by various routes.
Haematogenous spread is most common. The
main invasion routes are the blood vessels that
traverse the skull and vertebral column.
The respiratory tract is the primary portal of
entry of most CNS pathogens. Microorganisms
initially colonise the nasopharynx and attach to
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Bacteria traverse
across the epithelial cells into the bloodstream.
They
evade
the
neutrophils
and
classic
complement-mediated bactericidal activity by
their
polysaccharide
capsule
and
the
IgA
proteases.
Blood-borne infection takes place through the
blood–brain
and
blood–CSF
barrier.
Microorganisms spread directly from infected
sites, such as otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis,
etc., causing meningitis. Anatomical defects such
as surgery, trauma and congenital defects lead to
easy access of microorganisms to the CNS. Ret-
rograde spread along the peripheral sensory
nerves can rarely occur, such as in rabies virus
infection.
Microorganisms
reach
the
intraventricular
choroid plexus either by infecting the choroid
plexus epithelial cells and thus reaching the CSF
or else by adherence to the cerebral capillary
endothelial cells. Subsequently, they traverse
between these cells to reach the CSF. The normal
CSF having only a few white blood cells and trace
amounts
of
complement
proteins
and
immunoglobulins provide an ideal niche for the
bacteria to multiply rapidly. This is because the

(no fenestration)
CSF does not support phagocytosis to a great
extent (Fig. 71.4).

Clinical Syndromes
CNS manifestations are the main manifestations.
Fever, stiff neck, headache, nausea, vomiting and
neurological
abnormalities
are
frequently
associated with changes in mental states. Seizures
are more common in children. Cerebral oedema,
hydrocephalus and cerebral herniation are some
known complications. Permanent deafness is
another complication that occurs in some cases
of meningitis following H. inﬂuenzae infection.
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES)
AES is a group of clinically similar neurologic
manifestations caused by various pathogens such
as viruses, bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes
and also by chemicals/toxins. Japanese encepha-
litis (JE) is an important member of this group.
Young children eating unripe litchi fruit on empty
stomachs develop serious manifestations. Unripe
fruit contains the toxins hypoglycin A and meth-
ylene cyclopropyl glycine (MCPG), which are
poisonous. This condition was reported recently
from India in Odisha.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimen
CSF is the specimen of choice. The CSF is
obtained by subdural tap, ventricular aspiration
or lumbar puncture. In the lumbar puncture pro-
cedure, the patient lies in a lateral position with
knees ﬂexed and back arched to make the lumbar
vertebrae separated and prominent. Surgically
draping is done, and the space between L3 and
L4 vertebrae is located by palpation with a gloved
ﬁnger after disinfecting the area. The lumbar
puncture needle is carefully aimed between the
spinous
processes,
through
the
interspinous
ligaments into the spinal canal. CSF is allowed
to free ﬂow and is collected in a sterile container.
A maximum of 5 mL of CSF is collected in sterile
and dry containers. The sample is then divided
into three aliquots, and one each is sent for pathol-
ogy,
microbiology
and
biochemistry
investigations.

1058
71
Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
CSF is immediately transported to the labora-
tory for investigations. It is never refrigerated; if a
delay is anticipated, then it can be incubated at
37 C or left at room temperature for at most 1 h.
CSF is hypotonic, and any delay may compro-
mise the demonstration of cells and bacteria; neu-
trophil counts decrease by 32% in 1 h and 50% in
2 h. However, bacteria also do not survive long
incubation periods; CSF can be refrigerated for
viral studies.
Macroscopy
This provides many clues in presumptive diagno-
sis. Xanthochromia may suggest a tubercular
aetiology. Blood-stained CSF may be due to
trauma, subarachnoid haemorrhage or meningitis
caused by Bacillus anthracis. The ‘cobweb’
coagulum, a ﬁbrin web in the CSF, is seen on
standing in case of tubercular meningitis.
Microscopy
The microscopic examination of a direct wet
mount of the CSF is useful to demonstrate free-
living amoebae. The supernatant obtained after
centrifugation of the CSF sample is kept sepa-
rately in a sterile tube. The smear is made from
centrifuged sediment and is stained by Gram
stain. Gram staining is one of the simple, rapid,
accurate and inexpensive methods for diagnosing
meningitis. Gram staining is reliable when the
bacterial count is more than 105 colony-forming
units (CFU)/mL of CSF. Gram staining shows
varying sensitivity for different pathogens. The
sensitivity
of
the
staining
is
improved
by
centrifuging the specimen at 1500–2000 g or by
cytospin
(Table
71.15).
Acridine
orange
staining is found to be slightly more sensitive
than Gram staining. Modiﬁed India ink prepa-
ration of CSF is useful for demonstrating
capsulated budding yeast cells of Cryptococcus
neoformans. In cases of tuberculous meningitis,
CSF kept in a test tube for 10–12 h leads to
cobweb-like formation. Acid-fast staining of
CSF in tuberculous meningitis reveals long slen-
der beaded acid-fast bacilli.

Cytological and biochemical parameters in
normal individuals and in infected cases with
meningitis are listed in Table 71.16.
Culture
Isolation of bacteria by the culture of CSF
conﬁrms the diagnosis of meningitis. The
media used for culture depends on the suspected
bacterial pathogen to be isolated. 0.5% sheep
blood agar and chocolate agar are commonly
used media for aerobic bacteria culture. Cultures
should be incubated at 37 C at least for 72 h in
the presence of 5–10% CO2 before being reported
negative. Identiﬁcation is made by colony mor-
phology, Gram staining, biochemical reaction,
etc. Mycobacterial culture is done on an LJ
medium. The specimen is cultured on SDA agar
for the isolation of fungi. Blood culture is useful
for
diagnosing
meningitis
caused
by
H. inﬂuenzae, N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae.
Direct Detection of Antigen
Direct detection of antigen in the CSF, serum or
urine is useful for diagnosis of meningitis. Latex
agglutination test is used to detect antigens of
S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. inﬂuenzae
type b, group B streptococcus, E. coli K1 strains
and C. neoformans in the CSF. The test is useful
for rapid diagnosis of meningitis, particularly in
situations where antibiotic treatment has already
been given or where bacteriological culture and
staining are negative. Major drawbacks of the test
are cross-reactions and false-positive reactions

Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate
The test is very sensitive for detecting circulating
endotoxin in the CSF. Serological tests for
detecting serum antibodies are not useful for
diagnosing meningitis caused by bacteria or
fungi but are useful for viruses.
Molecular Diagnosis
Molecular assays such as PCR offer an alternative
in diagnosing central nervous system infections.
They are useful for detecting viral agents of
meningitis.
Multiplex polymerase chain reaction such as
Film Array Meningitis/Encephalitis (FA-M/E)
panel is a molecular tool which allows the simul-
taneous detection of 14 pathogens (bacteria,
viruses and one fungus). The entire process is
fully automated and has a turn-around time of
only 1 h. GeneXpert assay is a cartridge-based
real-time PCR that can be used to detect
M.
tuberculosis
and
enteroviral
meningitis
(Xpert EV). The turnaround time of this test is
2.5 h.
Treatment
Treatment of meningitis is based on antimicrobial
therapy, which depends on the microorganism
responsible for the condition. For example,
cefuroxime/ceftriaxone or cefotaxime or ampicil-
lin/sulbactam in combination with azithromycin
or quinolone are recommended to treat meningitis
caused by S. pneumoniae.

Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Bloodstream Infections
Invasion of the bloodstream by microorganisms is
one of the most serious situations in infectious
diseases and if not treated fast, can lead to shock,
multi-organ failure, disseminated intravascular
coagulation and even death. Invasion of the
bloodstream by microorganisms may result in
various clinical conditions.
Definitions
Bacteraemia
It is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream
without evidence of multiplication, as evidenced
by positive blood cultures.
Septicaemia
It is a clinical syndrome in which bacteria circu-
late and actively multiply in the bloodstream.
Septic Shock
It denotes sepsis with hypotension (arterial blood
pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic or 40 mmHg
less than the patient’s normal blood pressure) for
at least 1 h despite adequate ﬂuid resuscitation.
Multiple-organ Dysfunction Syndrome
It is a condition of dysfunction of more than one
organ,
requiring
intervention
to
maintain
homeostasis.
Endotoxaemia
It is a condition of circulating bacterial endotoxin
in the blood.
Types of Blood-Stream Infections
The causative agents of septicaemia are listed in
Table 71.17.
There are two major classes of bloodstream
infections: intravascular and extravascular. Intra-
vascular infections originate within the cardio-
vascular
system.
Examples
are
infective
endocarditis,
intravenous
catheter-associated
bacteraemia, etc. Extravascular infections are
caused by the bacteria reaching the bloodstream
via
the
lymphatics
from
another
focus
of
infection.

Listeria monocytogenes
The vascular compartment is normally sterile
and usually intact, and the entry of bacteria is
facilitated by some damage to the blood vessels
adjacent to the skin or mucosal surfaces. Subse-
quently, the bacteria are transported by phago-
cytic cells into capillaries or lymphatic systems.
The most probable portals of entry are the genito-
urinary system, respiratory tract, surgical wound
infection, etc. The introduction of contaminated
material directly into the vascular system also
induces blood-borne infections.
Clinical Syndromes
Clinical manifestations of bloodstream infections
are highly variable. These include fever, chills
and sweats, hyperventilation and resultant respi-
ratory alkalosis. Septic shock presents as fever,
acute respiratory distress and renal failure. It is
mediated by cytokines, such as interleukins and
tumour necrosis factors. Gram-negative bacteria
produce endotoxin, the lipopolysaccharide, which

causes septic shock responses. Lipid A, the core
component of the lipopolysaccharide, is responsi-
ble for many systemic disturbances like fever,
activation of complement and certain clotting
factors. Gram-positive bacteria produce a similar
response mediated by the exotoxins.
Bloodstream Infections
1061
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis depends on the demonstra-
tion of the causative pathogen in the blood by
culture. This is also supplemented by non-blood
culture tests, including serological tests in certain
microbial infections.
Blood Culture
Isolation of the causative microorganism from
blood cultures is critical in diagnosing and
treating bloodstream infections. Blood culture
can be carried out by either manual or automated
methods.
Manual Blood Culture
These systems rely on the use of appropriate
blood
culture
bottles
containing
enrichment
broth BHI (monophasic) or containing both BHI
broth and an agar slope (biphasic). These bottles
are placed in a conventional static incubator and
inspected daily to detect visible signs of bacterial
or fungal growth.
In the case of infective endocarditis, in the
absence of prior antibiotic therapy, a total of 2–3
blood culture sets, 10 mL each, obtained from
different venipuncture sites over 24 hours. They
are inoculated in blood culture bottles containing
glucose broth. Each blood culture set consists of
one aerobic and one anaerobic blood culture each.
Blood is diluted in the ratio of one: 5 in the
enrichment
broth
for
optimum
recovery
of
microorganisms. Cultures are incubated for at
least 3 weeks, with subcultures done on blood
agar and MacConkey agar after 24 h, 48 h and
once a week thereafter. The inoculated media are
incubated at 37 C for 24 h. Isolated organisms
are identiﬁed by colony morphology, Gram
staining, biochemical properties and serological
tests.
Automated Blood Culture
In these systems, the carbon dioxide production
by microorganisms in the culture bottles is con-
tinuously monitored, either by colourimetric,
ﬂuorescent methods or else by detection of O2
consumption and/or CO2, H2, and/or N2 produc-
tion (e.g. equipment such as BACTEC, BacT/
ALERT, Versa TREK System). During incuba-
tion, the bottles are continuously shaken in the
automated equipment. The current automated
systems have a much greater sensitivity compared
to the manual systems. These systems have
largely replaced manual blood culture systems in
healthcare facilities.
Non-blood Culture Tests
These include serological tests to detect blood-
stream infections are used to identify certain bac-
teria, such as Brucella, Bartonella, C. burnetii
and Legionella, that are hard to be detected by
using the traditional blood culture methods.
Tropheryma whipplei can be detected in vegeta-
tion with the help of a microscopic examination
using periodic acid–Schiff stain.
Other Tests
Other tests include chest radiography, electrocar-
diography, complete blood counts and creatinine
measurement. These tests also include tests for
estimation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
C-reactive protein level, circulating immune com-
plex titre and rheumatoid factor.
Laboratory Diagnosis of Catheter-Related
Blood Stream Infection (CRBSI)
Differential Quantitative Cultures
Two blood cultures—one from a peripheral site
and the other from the suspected infected line is
performed to diagnose an IV catheter-related bac-
teremia. A colony count ratio greater than 4 to 10:
1 between the central venous blood and a periph-
eral blood specimen indicates a probable CRBSI.

Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Treatment
Treatment by appropriate antibiotic forms the
mainstay in treatment of bloodstream infections.
In infective endocarditis, it is rather difﬁcult to
clear most of the bacteria present in the avascular
vegetation, as this site is comparatively unreach-
able for the host’s immune response. Additionally,
the bacteria are metabolically inactive at this site
and show no growth. Thus, prolonged bactericidal
therapy most of the bacteria causing infectiod
infected individuals.
Diarrhoeal Diseases and Food
Poisoning
Foodborne diseases are caused by food contami-
nation and occur at any stage of the food produc-
tion, delivery and consumption chain. There are
more than 250 known foodborne diseases. A
majority of them are due to microorganisms
including parasites. Other foodborne diseases
are essentially poisonings caused by toxins and
chemicals contaminating the food.
Definitions
Diarrhoea
It is the passage of abnormal liquid or unformed
stools at an increased frequency. The condition is
identiﬁed as acute if it persists for less than
2 weeks, persistent if it persists for 2–4 weeks
and chronic if present for more than 4 weeks.
Dysentery
Dysentery means the passage of blood and
mucous
with
faeces,
often
associated
with
tenesmus.
Gastroenteritis
It denotes a syndrome where inﬂammation of the
gastric mucosa and intestinal mucosa results in
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.
Enterocolitis
The condition denotes an inﬂammatory condition
involving the intestinal mucosa, both small and
large intestine.
Types
According to CDC, US; there are six important
foodborne diseases, known as ‘Big 6’—Salmo-
nella,
Salmonella
Typhi,
Shigella,
Escherichia
coli,
Norovirus,
and
Hepatitis
A. Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of
childhood diarrhoeal disease every year. Each
year diarrhoea kills around 525 000 children
under ﬁve. About 250 pathogens can cause diar-
rhoea. The most common ones are bacteria
(e.g. ETEC, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp., Cam-
pylobacter spp.), viruses (Rotavirus, Norwalk
virus,
Calicivirus),
parasites
(Entamoeba
histolytica,
Giardia
intestinalis,
Balantidium
coli,
Cryptosporidium,
spp.
Strongyloides
stercoralis) and fungi (Candida spp.).
Clinical Syndromes
Acute Infective Diarrhoea
Acute infective diarrhoea is most commonly
infectious.
Risk
groups
include
travellers,
consumers of certain foods such as chickens,
fried rice, etc., immunodeﬁcient persons, daycare
participants
and
their
family
members
and
institutionalised persons. Toxins and invasive
pathogens
cause
infectious
acute
diarrhoea,
whereas non-infectious diarrhoea is caused by
antibiotics
and
many
other
substances
(Table 71.18).
Chronic Infective Diarrhoea
This is caused by Giardia intestinalis, Cryptospo-
ridium
parvum,
Cyclospora
cayetanensis,
Cystoisospora
belli,
Mycobacterium
avium-
intracellulare complex, enteroadherent E. coli,

Traveller’s Diarrhoea
Individuals who travel into developing geo-
graphic areas with poor sanitation are at particu-
larly high risk for developing diarrhoea. In areas
with poor sanitation, enteric pathogens heavily
contaminate the water and food. Enterotoxigenic
E. coli is the most common cause of traveller’s
diarrhoea.
Gastroenteritis
It is the inﬂammation of the stomach and
intestines, mainly caused by bacterial toxins or
viral infection and causing emesis and diarrhoeal
disease (Fig. 71.5).

Food Poisoning
Bacterial food poisoning is an acute condition
caused
by
ingestion
of
food
or
drinking
contaminated with either living bacteria or toxins.
It can be (i) infective, (ii) toxic and (iii) interme-
diate or infective-toxic type (Table 71.19, Fig.
71.5).
Infective Food Poisoning
The condition is caused by invasive bacteria such
as Salmonella spp (Salmonella Typhimurium,
Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Heidelberg,
Salmonella Indiana, Salmonella Newport and
Salmonella Dublin), Vibrio parahaemolyticus

Infective type (Incubation period >16 h)
and Campylobacter jejuni. The multiplication of
these invasive bacteria occurs in vivo, followed
by an invasion of the intestinal mucosa.

Bacillus cereus (diarrhoeal type)
Salmonella spp.: Salmonella Enteritidis,
Salmonella Typhimurium
Clostridium botulinum
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
Shigella spp.
Campylobacter jejuni
Toxic Food Poisoning
It is caused by preformed toxins of S. aureus,
Bacillus cereus and Clostridium botulinum. This
type of food poisoning occurs following ingestion
of the food contaminated with preformed toxins
of these bacteria.
Intermediate or Infective-toxic Food
Poisoning
It is caused by Clostridium perfringens. In this
type of food poisoning, the bacteria secrete toxin
in the intestine.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
A wide-mouthed, sterile screw-capped container
is used to collect faecal sample for diagnosis.
Rectal swabs can be used as an alternative
where faecal samples cannot be collected. During
outbreaks due to food poisoning, the vomitus and
food consumed by the patient need to be collected
in addition to the faecal sample.
Ideally, a fresh specimen is required for an
accurate diagnosis. In case of the expected delay
or wherever transport of sample is necessary, a
transport medium (Cary–Blair or Venkatraman
Ramakrishnan) can be used. Alternatively, alka-
line peptone water (used as enrichment media) for
detection of V. cholerae can also be used for
transport. The specimen must be stored in a ther-
mal box maintained at 4 C or transported in
dry ice.
Microscopy
Wet mount preparation, both saline and iodine
wet mounts of fresh faecal samples are examined
microscopically for demonstrating ova or cysts
and trophozoites of parasites, presence of any
motile organisms, and pus cells if any. Hanging
drop preparation is a well-established technique
to examine live, motile microbes. For example,
darting motility can be observed for V. cholerae.
It can be further conﬁrmed by adding speciﬁc
antiserum so that the motility is inhibited.
Gram staining is of little use for faecal
samples, but used to detect curved bacilli indica-
tive of V.cholerae. The coccidian parasites (Cryp-
tosporidium
spp.,
Cyclospora
spp.
and
Cystoisospora spp.) can be demonstrated by
modiﬁed acid-fast staining. Apart from conven-
tional microscopic techniques, electron micros-
copy is used for the detection of certain viruses.
Culture
Both selective and non-selective media can be
used for direct culture of faecal samples. Selective
media
include
xylose-lysine-deoxycholate
(XLD), deoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) or
thiosulphate
citrate
bile
salt
agar
(TCBS).
MacConkey agar is used as non-selective or dif-
ferential media.
Enrichment media are useful when the number
of pathogens in the sample is less, making it
difﬁcult to isolate. The enrichment media allow

selective growth of the speciﬁc pathogen. The
fresh faecal specimen is directly inoculated in a
liquid media (alkaline peptone water for 6–8 h;
selenite
F
broth
for
12–18
h)
and
then
sub-cultured in a solid medium. The pathogen is
then identiﬁed by serotyping or classical bio-
chemical tests, followed by antibiotic sensitivity
testing.
Sexually Transmitted Infections and Reproductive Tract Infections
1065
Cell Culture
It is relatively more helpful in detecting viruses,
as tissue culture is extensively used for culturing
of viruses. Some bacteria can also be detected by
tissue culture. The cytotoxic effect of EHEC
verotoxin (VT) on vero cells and penetration of
HeLa
and
Hep-2
cells
by
ETEC
can
be
demonstrated by tissue culture.
Serology
ELISA is the most widely used serological test for
detecting E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC), Shiga toxin
and Clostridium difﬁcile toxins. Faecal antigen
detection ELISA has recently gained importance
for detecting protozoal parasites. For example,
Entamoeba histolytica can be detected from the
direct faecal specimen by Techlab II stool antigen
detection ELISA kit. Certain viruses (Rotavirus)
also can be detected.
Immunodiffusion, ELISA, latex agglutination
tests and neutralisation are different methods used
for detecting enterotoxin.
Molecular Detection
Conventional PCR and real-time PCR-based
pathogen detection is gradually gaining impor-
tance globally. Molecular methods can detect a
wide range of bacteria, parasites and viruses.
Treatment
Management of infective diarrhoea is based
mostly on symptomatic management and treat-
ment by antibiotics whenever indicated. The
replacement of electrolytes is essential and life-
saving
in
preventing
dehydration
and
hypovolemic shock. Protozoal dysentery may be
treated with inidazole/metronidazole. Bacillary
dysentery/diarrhoeas require antibiotic therapy.
Third-generation cephalosporins, ciproﬂoxacin
and tetracyclines are frequently used. Viral
diarrhoeas do not need any antibiotic therapy.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
and Reproductive Tract Infections
Sexually transmitted diseases are many of the
various communicable diseases that can be trans-
mitted primarily by sexual contact. These include
the
diseases
such
as
syphilis,
gonorrhoea,
chlamydiasis and genital herpes, as well as hepa-
titis B and AIDS that are often contracted by
non-sexual means.
Reproductive tract infections as per the CDC
(2003)
guidelines
include
three
types
of
infections: (1) sexually transmitted diseases like
chlamydial infections, gonorrhoea, chancroid and
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infections;
(2) endogenous infections, due to overgrowth of
commensal organisms of the genital tract of
healthy women, such as bacterial vaginosis or
vulvovaginal
candidiasis
and
(3)
iatrogenic
infections, arising out of improperly performed
medical procedures such as illegal abortion or
poor delivery practices.
Definitions
Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
The condition denotes an infection with any
organism capable of causing STD irrespective of
the presence of disease, for example, asymptom-
atic gonorrhoea in females and early stages of
HIV infection.
Sexually Transmissible Disease (STD)
The condition denotes a condition when the path-
ogen may not qualify as a full-ﬂedged sexually
transmitted pathogen because non-sexual routes
of infection predominate. The condition includes
bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, trichomoniasis,
genital ulcers with pain and lymphadenopathy,
chancre, genital herpes, chancroid, inﬂammation,
etc.

Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI)
The condition denotes infections of the genital
and the reproductive tract caused primarily by
sexually transmitted organisms. However, they
may also result from endogenous infection due
to the overgrowth of organisms normally present
in the genital tract of healthy individuals. The
condition may also be iatrogenic following the
instrumentation or improperly performed medical
procedures such as unhygienic delivery practice
or unsafe abortion procedures.
Types
The causative agents of STI and RTI are
summarised in Table 71.20. STDs can be
differentiated into two types: (i) those causing
ulcerative
lesions
and
(ii)
those
causing
non-ulcerative lesions.
Infections with Ulcerative Genital Ulcers
These lesions are caused by Treponema pallidum,
Haemophilus
ducreyi,
Calymmatobacterium
granulomatis, C. trachomatis (LGV, or lympho-
granuloma venereum strain), and herpes simplex
virus (HSV). The comparative features of these
conditions are summarised in Table 71.21.
Infection with Non-Ulcerative Lesions
These can be classiﬁed according to anatomical
sites involved in men and women.

HSV; vulvitis by C. albicans, HSV; vaginitis by
C.

cervicitis
by
C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium;
and bacterial vaginosis by Gardnerella vaginalis,
Mobiluncus spp., and Mycoplasma hominis. The
pathogens causing STDs are listed in Table 71.22.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Vaginal, cervical and urethral discharge can be
directly collected in a sterile container.
Swabs are used if the infected area is thick or
scanty. Discharge from the base and edge of the
infected area is collected with a sterile swab or
endocervical curette. Fluid from genital vesicles
can be collected using sterile capillary tubes.
Blood or serum may be collected in suspected
cases of gonococcal bacteraemia.
Immediate transport and analysis need to be
carried out as the bacteria may not be viable for
longer. Modiﬁed Stuart medium is a widely used
transport medium for N. gonorrhoeae.
Microscopy
Motile trophozoites of T. vaginalis in case of
trichomoniasis and pseudohyphae of C. albicans
and yeast cells in case of candidiasis are
demonstrated by microscopy of wet mount prep-
aration of vaginal discharge.
Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed by examining
the Gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge.
This is frequently helpful for the demonstration
of (1) intracellular Gram-negative diplococci

N. gonorrhoeae, along with the presence of other
polymorphs in cervical and urethral discharge and
rarely in vaginal discharge of women suffering
from gonorrhoea; (2) clue cells, the vaginal epi-
thelial cells with bacteria attached to it causing a
stippled appearance in the diagnosis of infection
caused by G. vaginalis; (3) H. ducreyi, a Gram-
negative coccobacilli in pairs in chancroid, and
(4) Gram-positive budding yeast cells in vaginal
secretions in the infections caused by C. albicans.
Giemsa-stained smears are useful to demonstrate
the presence of intracytoplasmic cysts organisms
(Donovan
bodies).
These
bodies
are
demonstrated in mononuclear cells ﬁlled with
deeply staining bodies, in granuloma inguinale
caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Tzanc smears
may detect the presence of multi-nucleated epi-
thelial cells in the scrapings from Herpes ulcers.
Sexually Transmitted Infections and Reproductive Tract Infections
1069
Dark ground microscopy is used to demon-
strate spirochetes in specimen suspected cases of
primary or secondary syphilis. A direct immuno-
ﬂuorescence test using monoclonal antibody is
employed to demonstrate elementary bodies of
C. trachomatis in endocervical swabs. Direct
immunoﬂuorescence is also employed to identify
Treponemal antigens and Herpes simplex virus in
scrapings from ulcers in vagina, penis or urethra.
Culture
C. trachomatis is cultured in tissue cultures, and
the yolk sac of 7 days old chick embryos.
Herpesviruses are also isolated in tissue culture
and on the chorioallantoic membrane of chick
embryos. N. gonorrhoeae can be isolated by
enriched media such as Thayer-Martin. Chocolate
agar is used for isolating other bacteria. Myco-
plasma organisms can be isolated in PPLO agar.
T. vaginalis is cultured in Trichosel broth.
Serology
N. gonorrhoeae antibodies in the serum are
demonstrated by the CFT and IFA. Chlamydial
and Herpes viral antibodies can be detected by
CFT, ELISA and IFA. Mycoplasma antibodies
are detected by agglutination test, CFT and IFA.
Standard tests for Syphilis (STS) such as
VDRL/RPR
and
Treponemal
such
as
TPI,
TPHA, FTA and FTA-ABS are used
for
serodiagnosis
of
syphilis.
TPI/FTA-ABS
is
highly speciﬁc and considered gold standard for
Syphilis. FTA-ABS is employed for demonstra-
tion of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to conﬁrm
neonatal syphilis in neonates.
Molecular Detection
Commercial multiplex PCR kits are available for
the diagnosis of major sexually transmitted
infections (STI-7). The clinical specimen include
endocervical swabs from women and urethral
swabs from men.
Other Tests
Frei’s Test
This is a skin test using heat-killed bacterial
antigen from the aspirated bubo pus from cases
of LGV. This test is frequently used to diagnose
lymphogranuloma venereum.
Whiff Test
The vaginal ﬂuid of women with BV often has a
foul odour. This is caused by decarboxylation of
certain amino acids such as lysine or arginine
resulting in the production of the foul-smelling
amine compounds. A simple Point of Care test is
available for diagnosing this condition in the out-
patient clinics, known as the Whiff test. The test is
performed by adding a few drops of potassium
hydroxide to the vaginal secretions on a glass
slide or small test tube. These amines immedi-
ately become volatile and produce the typical
ﬁshy odour.
Treatment
Treatment of the condition depends upon the
causative agent. Acyclovir is recommended for
genital Herpes, imidazole or metronidazole for
trichomoniasis, tetracycline or macrolides and
3rd generation cephalosporins for Chlamydia
infections, tetracycline or macrolides and 3rd
generation cephalosporins for Mycoplasma infec-
tion, long-acting penicillin for syphilis; and spec-
tinomycin, ceftriaxone, etc. for gonorrhoea.

Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
The skin is the largest organ covering the human
body, composed of three layers: epidermis, der-
mis and hypodermis. The layers have varying but
signiﬁcant
anatomical
and
physiological
functions. The skin provides a large barrier
against
invading
pathogens,
chemicals
and
mechanical injuries. It also regulates temperature
of the body.
Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are
associated with varying presentations, and sever-
ity. It ranges from mild pyoderma to life-
threatening necrotising fasciitis. The presence of
inﬂammation in the skin characterised by redness,
swelling, heat and pain indicates SSTIs. The
affected area can also become functionless.
Co-existing or pre-existing diabetes and HIV
also increases the severity of illness. These easily
transforms a milder variant of skin infection into
an advancing illness leading to mortality status.
The SSTIs, therefore, present clinically diverse
challenges requiring different management and
intervention either medical or surgical.
There is an estimated incidence rate of 24.6/
1000 person-years. Most SSTIs tend to resolve
within 7–10 days, but the prevalence rate may
vary from place to place and remains to be the
third common cause next to chest pain and
asthma. It is more prevalent among males
(60–70% of all cases) and individuals 45 to
64 years of age. Almost three-fourth of these
patients can be treated in the outpatient setting.
Types
SSTIs
can
occur
as
primary
or
secondary
infections. Most of the primary skin infections
like impetigo, folliculitis, boils, etc., are caused
by a single pathogen, including S. aureus, Beta
hemolytic streptococci, coryneform bacteria and
others. These bacteria enter through a break in the
skin, such as injury, minor abrasions, or insect
bites. Many systemic infections such as measles,
varicella, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
and
gonococcal
infection
manifest
as
skin
infections. Secondary infection of the skin also
occurs in already diseased skin the skin infected
earlier.
Various classiﬁcation systems have been used
for SSTIs. One such classiﬁcation is based on
anatomical location and presence and absence of
tissue necrosis.
1. Superﬁcial infection: Impetigo, erysipelas and
cellulitis.
2. Deep non-necrotising infection: Pyomyositis.
3. Deep necrotising infection: Necrotising fascii-
tis, and gas gangrene.
4. Miscellaneous infections: These include
(a)
infections associated with bites and ani-
mal contact.
(b)
surgical site infections, and
(c)
infections due to the immunocompro-
mised status of the patient.
Varicella and measles involve the epithelial
layer, while dermatophyte infections involve the
keratin layer. The epidermis is affected in impe-
tigo
caused
mostly
by
streptococcii
and
staphylococci. Dermis is affected in erysipelas,
caused by S. pyogenes. Hair follicle infection
leads to folliculitis, boils, and carbuncles.
The sebaceous gland may be infected by
Propionibacterium acnes, and subcutaneous fat
lesions leading to cellulitis is precipitated by beta-
hemolytic
streptococci.
Necrotising
fasciitis
caused by S. pyogenes and anaerobes is a life-
threatening
condition
with
systemic
manifestations.
In 2003, an expert panel headed by Eron clas-
siﬁed SSTIs based on the severity and patient’s
presentation. Eron’s classiﬁcation is as follows:
Class I: SSTIs but no signs/symptoms of sys-
temic toxicity or comorbidities. The patient is
healthy and afebrile.
Class II: Either systemically unwell /well with
comorbidity that may complicate or delay resolu-
tion. The patient is febrile and appears sick.
Class III: Toxic and unwell (fever, tachycar-
dia, hypotension). The patient has at least one
unstable
comorbidity
or
a
limb-threatening
infection.
Class IV: Sepsis syndrome with a life-
threatening infection.

Hepatobiliary Infections
1071
Laboratory Diagnosis
Specimens
Pus swab or pus aspirate (in syringe/anaerobic
transport medium) collected from abscess, cellu-
litis ulcer, lymphadenitis, myositis or other
related conditions are useful. The surface exudate
is cleaned with sterile saline or 70% alcohol for
ulcers. It is desirable to spirate by needle from
deep tissue. In case, needle aspiration is not feasi-
ble, swabs (two) are used to collect the specimen
from base of the ulcer. For closed abscess, the
surface is disinfected with 70% alcohol and
contents are aspirated with a sterile syringe and
needle and aseptically transferred to an anaerobic
transport medium and transported to the labora-
tory within a few hours.
Microscopy
Staphylococci, streptococci, diphtheroids, etc.,
are readily demonstrated by Gram stain. Anaero-
bic
bacteria
are
identiﬁed
by
their
typical
morphology.
Culture
S. aureus, β hemolytic Streptococcus and Coryn-
eform bacteria grow well on sheep blood agar.
RCM broth is used to transport the clinical
specimens and isolation of anaerobes. Varicella
and measles are isolated in tissue cultures.
Molecular Detection
PCR is used for the molecular diagnosis of
viruses such as varicella and measles.
Other Tests
Other tests, such as Nagler’s reaction, is carried
out for the demonstration of alpha-toxin (lecithin-
ase) production by C. welchii.
Treatment
Penicillin is the drug of choice for the infection
caused
by
beta-hemolytic
Streptococci.
Antibacterial susceptibility testing of the bacterial
isolate is carried out to treat the infection with the
appropriate drugs. Topical acyclovir is prescribed
for secondary infection with varicella. There is no
speciﬁc antiviral therapy for measles.
Hepatobiliary Infections
Hepatobiliary infection includes hepatitis, liver
abscess and cholangitis. It is one of the important
causes of morbidity among diseases of public
health importance. Early identiﬁcation of such
infections helps in reducing short- and long-term
complications. The systemic infections involving
viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens
may show primary and secondary hepatobiliary
involvement.
Definitions
Hepatitis is inﬂammation of the liver.
Cholangitis is inﬂammation of the bile duct.
Cholecystitis is inﬂammation of the gall bladder.
Clinical Syndromes
Hepatitis
It is a self-limiting condition. Nevertheless, it can
progress to ﬁbrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular
carcinoma. The pathogens causing hepatitis are
listed in the Table 71.23. Liver abscess denotes
the localisation of the abscess in the liver. The
three major forms of liver abscess are caused by
E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus
milleri
group,
etc.
These
infections
are
polymicrobial and are known to cause a pyogenic
abscess. The amoebic liver abscess is the most
common one caused by E. histolytica. The can-
dida species is the common cause of the fungal
abscess.
Cholangitis
Cholangitis, which is inﬂammation of bile duct is
caused by E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter,
Enterococcus and anaerobes like C. perfringens
and Bacteroides. It results in biliary tract obstruc-
tion and bile stone formation. The parasites such

as Opisthorchis, Clonorchis, Fasciola hepatica,
Fasciola gigantica, Ascaris lumbricoides and
Echinococcus granulosus can causes ﬁbrosis
and cholangiectasis of bile duct. The hepatitis
virus and HIV can also cause cholangitis.

Toxins
Autoimmune disease
Non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease
Granulomatous hepatitis
Liver abscesses
Cholecystitis
Cholecystitis, gall bladder inﬂammation, can
manifest as fever, abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting. The presence of stone in the gallbladder
may result in blockage of bile ﬂow aggravated by
the infection caused by E. coli, Klebsiella, Strep-
tococcus, Clostridium spp., Epstein–Barr virus
and HIV.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The
evaluation
of
Hepatobiliary
infection
involves multiple imaging modalities such as
USG, CT, MRI and nuclear imaging. Serum
liver enzymes are altered with elevated serum
aspartate
aminotransferases
and
alanine
aminotransferases.
Elevated
serum
bilirubin
level is most commonly seen in acute infection.
Diagnosis of pyogenic abscess is made by
microscopy and culture of ultrasound-guided
pus aspirate. If an amoebic liver abscess is
suspected, microscopy of the wet mount of
aspirated pus is carried out for the presence of
amoebic trophozoites. Molecular methods such as
nested multiplex PCR can be done targeting the
18S rRNA gene of E. histolytica. Imaging
modalities like USG, CT, MRI, Nuclear scan
can be used. For fungal abscesses, Sabouraud’s
dextrose agar followed by KOH wet mount are
used to isolate fungal pathogenes in cases of bile
duct infection. Bile is examined by microscopy
and culture for detection of a speciﬁc bacterial
pathogen(s).
ELISA,
chemiluminescence
assays,
immunochromatography tests, etc. are of value
in the diagnosis of hepatitis. RT-PCR is fre-
quently used to estimate viral load.
Wound Infections
Wound infections occur primarily because of a
break in the skin layer as a result of the
complications such as surgery, trauma, bite
wounds and other infections that interrupt the
mucosal or skin integrity. Old people and patients
with diabetes, malignancy and other immune
deﬁciency disorders are more at risk. The condi-
tion manifests as redness, warmth and tenderness
at the wound infection site. Fever and Pus
discharges are frequent. Frequent complications
include the spread of infection through the blood-
stream to other organs; and septic shock, which
may require intensive care and support. Death of
the surrounding tissue such as muscle, connective
tissue, bone, etc. which may require debridement.
Post-operative wound infection or Surgical
site infections are one of the most common
health-care-associated infection and occurs in
3% of all surgical procedures. The source may
be patients’ own microbiota or from the environ-
ment. S. aureus is present in patients’ own skin,
E. coli or anaerobes present in the gastrointestinal
mucosa, and Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseu-
domonas and Acinetobacter present in the envi-
ronment are also other sources of infection.

Wound infection is associated with signiﬁcant
morbidity and mortality.

A bite wound infection results in inoculation
of the organism from the saliva of animals and
humans into the deeper tissues. The infection due
to bite ranges from cellulitis to systemic infection
such as bacteraemia or even encephalitis.
Burn injury is another example that results in
massive destruction of the skin and its appendages.
This can cause the entry of microorganisms from
patients’ own ﬂora or from the hospital environ-
ment. The common organisms causing wound
infections is listed in Table 71.24.
Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made
by the culture of debrided tissue collected from an
infected wound in a sterile universal container. The
tissue or pus sample is inoculated on the bedside
into Robertson cooked meat medium and sent for
culture for anaerobic bacteria.
Treatment of the condition depends on the
nature of the wound, degree of wound infection
and the organism causing infection.
Congenital Infections
Congenital infection occurs when vertical trans-
mission occurs from mother to child during preg-
nancy, delivery or after delivery. The infection
becomes severe if the mother gets infected during
the ﬁrst or second trimester of pregnancy. It gets
transmitted through the placenta and causes
developmental defects, stillbirths and neonatal
deaths.
Vaccination,
prompt
detection
and
treatment can reduce the number of adverse preg-
nancy outcomes. If there is any suspicion of
maternal infection during pregnancy, laboratory
testing has to be done for congenital TORCH
infections, which include congenital Toxoplas-
mosis, Other infections like syphilis, Varicella-
zoster virus, Human Parvovirus, Zika virus,
malaria, Trypanosomiasis, Rubella, Cytomegalo-
virus, and Herpes Simplex Virus.
Congenital Rubella Syndrome
Congenital Rubella syndrome (CRS) is caused by
the Rubella virus, a togavirus of the genus
Rubivirus. It is transmitted through droplets shed
from
the
respiratory
secretions
of
infected
persons.
In the infected mothers, it runs a mild course
with a low-grade fever (< 39 C), headache,
conjunctivitis and rhinitis. An important feature
is post-auricular, occipital and posterior cervical
adenopathy, which precedes a red, maculopapular
rash by 5–10 days. The rash occurs, begins on the
face and neck, and progresses to the lower parts of
the body, lasting about 3 days. Arthralgia is also
another common symptom of rubella infection.
In the infected infants, the placenta and the
foetus are affected if primary rubella infection
occurs during pregnancy. It causes a variety of
malformations labelled CRS. The classic triad of
CRS include hearing impairment, congenital
heart defects—in particular, branch pulmonary
artery stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus—and
eye anomalies such as cataract(s), pigmentary
retinopathy (salt and pepper type), chorioretinitis
or congenital glaucoma. Additional clinical signs
include blueberry mufﬁn skin lesions, spleno-
megaly,
microcephaly,
developmental
delay,
meningoencephalitis, low birth weight, radiolu-
cent bone disease and jaundice within 24 h after
birth. The highest risk (90%) of CRS is during the
periconception
period
and
early
pregnancy
(8–10 weeks). If maternal rubella infection is
diagnosed beyond 18 weeks of gestation, the
foetus might be infected (Congenital rubella
infection) but does not typically develop signs
and symptoms of CRS.

1074
71
Infective Syndromes: A System and Organ-Based Approach
Serological tests and nucleic acid ampliﬁca-
tion
tests
such
as
reverse
transcriptase-
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the
mainstays in diagnosing CRS. The ideal sample
is a throat swab; however, nasal swabs, blood,
urine or cerebrospinal ﬂuid are acceptable.
In the infants, the CRS is conﬁrmed if
(1) Rubella IgM is present in the blood in infants
<6 months old, (2) There is sustained elevation of
IgG in blood; or is present on at least two
occasions between 6 and 12 months of age
(in the absence of having received rubella vaccine
or being exposed to rubella); or (3) Rubella viral
RNA is detected from a clinical sample by
Nucleic acid ampliﬁcation test (NAAT). The opti-
mal sample is a throat swab; however, nasal
swabs, blood, urine or cerebrospinal ﬂuid are
acceptable.
In pregnant women, CRS is conﬁrmed if IgM
for rubella is detected with no history of illness or
contact with a rubella case or if NAAT is positive.
Congenital Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the
coccidian parasite T. gondii. The major routes of
transmission of Toxoplasma to humans are oral
and congenital. Tachyzoites are the infective
form. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis
depends on the trimester during which mother is
infected. The transmission rate is approximately
25% in the ﬁrst trimester, 54% in the second
trimester, and 65% in the third trimester, if
untreated.
Clinical
manifestation
is
subclinical
in
approximately 75% of infected newborns. The
severity of the disease in infants is inversely pro-
portional to the gestational age at the time of
primary maternal infection—with ﬁrst-trimester
maternal infection leading to the most serious
manifestations. It can cause spontaneous abor-
tion, prematurity, or stillbirth. Involvement of
the CNS is a hallmark of congenital Toxoplasma
infection. The presence of chorioretinitis, intra-
cranial calciﬁcations, and hydrocephalus is con-
sidered
the
classic
triad
of
congenital
toxoplasmosis. Other occasional ﬁndings include
hepatosplenomegaly, rash (maculopapular, pete-
chial or both), myocarditis, pneumonitis, hearing
defects, an erythroblastosis-like picture, thrombo-
cytopenia,
lymphocytosis,
monocytosis,
and
nephrotic syndrome.
Laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis usu-
ally is diagnosed based on antibody detection. In
acute infection, serum IgG and IgM antibody
levels generally rise within one to 2 weeks of
infection. The most common laboratory method
used worldwide for diagnosing CT in newborns
and infants is serological detection of various
isotypes of Toxoplasma antibodies in peripheral
blood. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
of amniotic ﬂuid is performed in the foetus to
diagnose congenital toxoplasmosis. The Sabin
Fieldman dye test is the reference method for
Toxoplasma IgG detection and remains the gold
standard. Other more commonly used methods
rely on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and ELISA-like assays, agglutination,
and indirect immunoﬂuorescence.
Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Infection
Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is transmit-
ted when the virus crosses the placenta during
pregnancy and causes infection in the foetus.
The highest risk of transmitting the infection is
seen among a woman who has primary infection
during the ﬁrst and second trimesters of preg-
nancy. The infection is most common in pregnant
women who are immunocompromised. It causes
enlargement of infected host cells and causes the
cell-cell spread of the virus. They primarily infect
kidney and salivary glands and undergo latency.
The most common symptoms include petechiae,
hepatosplenomegaly,
jaundice,
microcephaly.
The long-term sequelae involve sensorineural
hearing
loss,
cerebral
palsy
and
visual
impairment.
Laboratory diagnosis depends on screening
antenatal mothers by CMV IgG serology to rule
out the high risk of acquiring the infection during
pregnancy. IgM CMV in pregnancy indicates
congenital infection. IgG may be present in either

past or recent infection and can be differentiated
by IgG avidity test. Antigen detection can be done
targeting
pp65
antigen
in
peripheral
blood
leukocytes.
Perinuclear
cytoplasmic
and
intranuclear inclusions (Owl’s eye appearance)
is demonstrated in infected cases’ urine.
Eye Infections
1075
Other Congenital Infections
These include neonatal Herpes, Varicella-Zoster
virus infection, Parvovirus B-19 infection, Zika
virus infection, congenital syphilis and malaria in
pregnancy.
Bone and Joint Infections
Bone and joint infections are, also known as
infections of the musculoskeletal system, can
occur both in children and adults. They can be
grouped as follows:
1. Osteomyelitis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
2. Joint infections that includes acute septic
arthritis,
prosthetic
joint
infections,
and
spondylodiscitis.
Whatever may be the site, the organisms com-
monly gain entry through the haematogenous
route, although exogenous infection due to
trauma or extension from an infection at an adja-
cent site can also introduce the pathogen. S.
aureus is the most common pathogen involved
in causing both bone and joint infections. Group
A Streptococcus, aerobic Gram-negative rods
bacteria such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and N.
gonorrhoeae are other commonly encountered
pathogens. P. aeruginosa, apart from S. aureus,
may be involved in intravenous drug users.
S. aureus also remains the most frequent patho-
gen in the paediatric population, in addition to
other bacteria such as Kingella kingae, H.
inﬂuenzae, Salmonella, and Group B Streptococ-
cus. Patients commonly present with pain in the
affected region, limitation of joint movement,
limping, and fever.
Microbiological investigation centres around
blood culture and analysis of joint aspiration
material. Blood culture must be performed in all
suspected cases despite the low yield (up to 50%
positivity). Synovial ﬂuid or bone samples should
be examined microscopically and by culture.
Cultures are often negative, but the sample should
be subjected to molecular diagnostics (polymer-
ase chain reaction to detect 16S rDNA). In addi-
tion to microbiological investigations, ESR, CRP,
complete blood count, and imaging techniques
are valuable in diagnosing bone and joint
infections.
Eye Infections
Eye infections include conjunctivitis, keratitis or
corneal ulcer, and endophthalmitis. Viral con-
junctivitis is the most common eye infection
caused most commonly by adenovirus and some-
times by Herpes simplex virus or Varicella Zoster
virus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently caused
by H. inﬂuenza, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus,
while gonococcal conjunctivitis can be part of
sexually transmitted infections. Bacterial infec-
tion is the most common cause of keratitis involv-
ing
S.
aureus
and
coagulase-negative
staphylococci, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa.
Less commonly, acanthamoeba or some fungi,
including microsporidia, can also cause keratitis.
The herpes simplex virus remains the main caus-
ative organism for keratitis among viruses.
Endophthalmitis is caused by coagulase-negative
staphylococci, S. aureus, streptococci and Gram-
negative bacilli. Cataract surgery is the most com-
mon reason for developing this condition world-
wide. Table 71.25 lists the comprehensive list of
organisms
causing
different
types
of
eye
infections.
Conjunctival
swab,
corneal
scrapings
or
samples from vitreous or aqueous humour are
obtained, depending on the type of infection.
Routine Gram stain and culture, supplemented
with nucleic acid ampliﬁcation test, if available,
are commonly used to detect the causative
organism.

Ear Infections
Otitis externa is an infection of the external audi-
tory canal commonly caused by S. aureus,
P. aeruginosa and occasionally by Aspergillus
or Candida. Severe otalgia and fever are the
hallmarks of the disease.
Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear
and is commonly seen in children between 6 and
12 months of age and declines by the age of 5. It
commonly follows an acute upper respiratory
tract infection, and it includes in its spectrum
acute otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis
media, and otitis media with effusion. The most
common bacteria implicated in otitis media are S.
pneumoniae,
followed
by
non-typeable
H.
inﬂuenzae
and
Moraxella
catarrhalis.
Viral
pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus,
coronaviruses, inﬂuenza viruses, adenoviruses,
human metapneumovirus, and picornaviruses.
Diagnosis is made by physical examination and
otoscopy. Laboratory diagnosis is seldom needed
and may be done by tympanocentesis to collect
the middle ear accumulated ﬂuid for culture and
staining purposes.

Quality Management System
in Diagnostic Microbiology
72
One of the important aspects of a diagnostic
laboratory
is
to
ascertain
whether
the
testing methods and the test results which are
generated
are
trustworthy
and
reproducible.
Towards this end, quality assurance is of utmost
importance.
Quality Management System
The accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the
test reports are the three cornerstones of a medical
diagnostic facility. The fundamental aim is to
prevent or minimise laboratory errors. These
errors can adversely affect effective patient man-
agement. It includes, among others, inappropriate
or
improper
treatment,
unnecessary
adverse
effects, complications arising out of treatment
failure, diagnostic failure, escalation of expendi-
ture and the need to do additional or repeat
tastings. From a broader perspective, from the
point of view of public health aspect, this can
result in a delay in instituting proper public health
initiatives, and in the times of outbreaks or
epidemics,
a
breakdown
of
proper
control
measures and proper treatment guidelines due to
the wrong choice of vaccines or antimicrobial
agents.

Definitions
Quality
Quality
means
meeting
the
predetermined
requirements of the users for a particular sub-
stance or service. It can be deﬁned as the accu-
racy, reliability and timeliness of the test reports.
Quality Assurance
It can be deﬁned as ‘all the planned and system-
atic activities implemented within the quality
system that can be demonstrated to provide con-
ﬁdence that a product or service will fulﬁl
requirements for quality’. It is the sum total of
all the measures undertaken to ascertain that the
test results are not only accurate but also correct.
Quality Control
It is deﬁned as the ‘part of quality management
focused on fulﬁlling quality requirements’ or the
‘operational techniques and activities used to
fulﬁl requirements for quality’. In diagnostic
microbiology, it includes those steps which are
incorporated in every test run to conﬁrm that the
run has been proper and satisfactory.
Thus, quality assurance describes the perfor-
mance of a procedure while quality control
involves
the
inspection
section
of
quality
management.

Quality Management System in Diagnostic Microbiology
Components of Quality Management
System
All laboratory procedures can be subdivided into
pre-analytical,
analytical
and
post-analytical
components. The laboratory workﬂow begins
with the patient and ends with the generation of
test report; and quality management procedure
has to be implemented during the entire process.
As per CDC, one such model which is widely
used incorporates 12 essential activities which
make up the backbone of quality management
and includes:
1. Organisation and supervision.
2. Manpower.
3. Instruments.
4. Purchase and inventory.
5. Documentation and record keeping.
6. Process control.
7. Information management.
8. Occurrence management.
9. Analysis.
10. Customer service.
11. Process improvement.
12. Infrastructure and safety requirements.
Quality Assurance
Quality assurance (QA) encompasses carrying
out all laboratory activities in a faultless and
errorless manner so that the generated results are
highly accurate. It ensures that a maximum num-
ber of errors is avoided and also pinpoints any
error which may creep in. The term Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP) is also used for
QA. It takes into account all aspects of a diagnos-
tic cycle: Pre-analytical, analytical and Post-
analytical phases. Computers and information
technology have tremendously helped in improv-
ing
the
quality
of
laboratories
and
most
laboratories nowadays use some form of the
information
management
system.
The
components of QA are listed in Table 72.1.
Table 72.1 Quality assurance or good laboratory practices
•
Appropriate sample collection
•
Proper specimen identiﬁcation
•
Immediate dispatch to the laboratory to maintain the correct temperature
•
To collect and maintain the sample such that its quality remains unchanged
•
Correct test procedure
•
Review of the report before issue
•
Prompt communication of the report to the correct destination
•
Good customer or user relationship
Quality assurance programs have multiple
beneﬁts which include the generation of quality
products and reliable services, motivation for the
staff to work better, building up of the reputation
of the laboratory and prevention of legal suits and
other problems.
Quality Control
Quality Control (QC) is principally concerned
with the analytical phase of diagnostic cycle.
This
deals
with
the
laboratory
activities
undertaken to make certain that the test carried
out is accurate. Test errors are taken care of
and test results are also veriﬁed. The sources of
error are controlled. As per WHO, analytical
quality control depends upon the following
factors:
•
Equipment reliability.
•
Reagent stability, integrity and efﬁciency.
•
Instrument calibration.
•
Procedure reliability using standard operating
manuals.
•
Speciﬁcity, precision and accuracy of the test.
•
Proﬁciency
of
personnel
and
continuous
updating of their knowledge.
•
Selection of the right technique of proven efﬁ-
cacy for which reliable reagents are available.
•
Good internal quality control.
•
Participation in external quality assessment
programmes.

Quality Management System
1081
The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
manual is an integral part of any laboratory. It
helps to improve and to maintain GLP and also
deals with biosafety in the laboratory. The written
manual helps the laboratory personnel to perform
the tests to an acceptable standard and also deal
with errors which may be encountered in day-to-
day practice.
Assessment of Quality Systems
As per WHO, assessment is the ‘inspection of
some part or the whole of the quality management
system to show that the laboratory is meeting
all
regulatory,
accreditation
and
customer
requirements’. Assessment of the laboratory per-
formance is commonly done by quality assess-
ment and audit. The International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) uses the term ‘audit’
instead of ‘assessment’, and these two terms are
synonymous. In quality assessment, the perfor-
mance of a laboratory is assessed in either of the
two ways: Comparison with some predetermined
standards or by comparison with some other stan-
dard laboratory. It may be done internally by the
staff members of the laboratory or it may be
performed by some external agency able to
accredit the laboratory performance.
Internal Quality Assessment/Control or
Internal Audit
Here the laboratory inspects its own processes. It
is easy to institute at the departmental level and
can be performed frequently and corrective
actions can be taken immediately. It is important
that it prepares the laboratory for the external
audit. Each laboratory should have a clear-cut
policy
about
internal
quality
control
and
international- or national-level directives should
be followed stringently.
External Quality Assessment/Control or
External Audit
Here all or some aspects of the laboratory are
assessed in an objective manner by an external
agency. Three methods are available for external
audit:
Proficiency Testing
Here the external agency sends a set of specimens
to the laboratory and asks it to perform some
speciﬁc tests with the specimens. The results are
sent back to the agency and correct results are
given a pass while wrong results are designated as
fail. In India, such proﬁciency testing is being
done by the Indian Association of Medical Micro-
biology and the Indian Academy of Tropical
Parasitology.
Rechecking or Retesting
Here sets of isolates or slides are sent to a higher
or specialised laboratory for conﬁrmation or cor-
rect identiﬁcation.
Site Visit
This is done for inspection, certiﬁcation and for
accreditation of the laboratory. It helps to obtain
the ground level actual picture of the laboratory,
measures the gaps or deﬁciencies in the labora-
tory and thus helps the laboratory to take the
necessary
corrective
actions
to
remove
the
deﬁciencies. Normally, on-site visits are done by
central or government agencies, and in India, it is
performed by National Accreditation Board for
Laboratories (NABL) and National Accreditation
Board for Hospitals (NABH). The ISO remains
the benchmark for all accreditation agencies.
