“The convergence between physical and cyber security affects not just our daily
lives but also our nation’s security. In their new book, Bill Crowell, Dan Dunkel,
Brian Contos, and Colby DeRodeff tap into their wealth of public and private
sector experience to explain how we should manage risk in an ever converging
world.—Roger Cressey, former Chief of Staff, White House Critical Infrastructure
Protection Board, and NBC News terrorism analyst
“Take advantage of the years in the government and commercial arenas that the
authors have, their knowledge of current and emerging technologies, and their
insight on other’s successes and failures. There is no other text available which
packs such comprehensive and useful knowledge into a single volume – this book
will be on your desk, not your bookshelf.”—Dr. Jim Jones, CISSP, Senior Scientist,
SAIC, and Assistant Professor, Ferris State University
“In my opinion the authors do an exceptional job explaining the need for more
comprehensive approaches to achieving operational risk management within
business and governmental organizations. The authors clearly demonstrate why
convergence of physical and logical security is a natural evolution with signiﬁcant
advantages to all participants… I believe that the book is a must read for anyone
responsible for enabling security solutions in complex organizations.”–Dr. Larry
Ponemon, Chairman and Founder of the Ponemon Institute
“The consistent and persistent message in this book is needed and well presented
- Corporate executives must understand and implement converged security or
get left behind.This message is presented using a nice balance of historical exam-
ples and contemporary business issues and case studies.The authors make their
points by presenting information from the public, private, and government per-
spectives. Thus, this book is appropriate for any leader in the ﬁeld of security
(physical or IT). It is also an appropriate read for those in the legal, HR, and PR
worlds.”—Dr.Terry Gudaitis, Cyber Intelligence Director, Cyveillance

“Physical & Logical Security Convergence takes an in-depth look at how the
issue of convergence is impacting enterprise security, particularly from the insider
threat perspective. Solutions are commonly a reaction that lag behind evolving
threats, be they technology or management focused. In the new world, we need
bottom up approaches that converge solutions that keep up with evolution. This
book is a primer for convergence in an evolving risk environment.”—Dr. Bruce
Gabrielson, NCE,Associate, Booz Allen Hamilton
“The convergence of physical and information security is a vital development in
the corporate world and a critical success factor for all organizations.The authors
do an outstanding job exploring the roots of convergence, as well as the techno-
logical, political and logistical issues involved in successfully merging the silos of
security. More important, they explore the very real opportunities and advantages
that arise from security convergence, and illustrate their concepts and prescrip-
tions with practical advice from the real world.This book will be an invaluable
guide to anyone involved in guiding security convergence or simply wanting to
understand the power and beneﬁts of convergence.”—John Gallant, Editorial
Director, Network World
“Filled with historical anecdotes and interesting facts, “Physical & Logical
Convergence” is a comprehensive deﬁnition of converged security threats and
considerations. In this day and age, convergence has become a business reality
requiring organizations to realign their security and compliance remediation
efforts. The authors capture the key aspects of planning for, design and addressing
security aspects of this new technology landscape. As expected from an ESM per-
spective, also provided is a conceptual overview of addressing compliance audit
and monitoring requirements of converged components.”—Mark Fernandes,
Senior Manager, Deloitte

Dedications
To the beautiful women in my life who gave me the inspiration to author yet
another book: my amazing wife Monica-Tiffany, our incredible daughters Zoey
and Athena, my patient mother Marie and supportive sisters Karrie and Tracy.
And to my father Tom who instilled in me commitment and tenacity.

Acknowledgements
It’s always hard to single people out for thanks when you write a book. Most of
my knowledge over the last decade comes from combined experiences with var-
ious individuals and organizations. Even the concept of physical and logical con-
vergence itself was a culmination of conversations with dozens of brilliant minds
in the private and public sector, academia, and the media. Only after conver-
gence displayed such obvious and extensive support from these individuals did I
ﬁnally convince myself that a book had to be written.While I can’t possibly
mention everyone, some individuals went well beyond an exchange of ideas in
their contribution. Some actually reviewed sundry versions of the manuscript
and provided expert insight. For their outstanding commitment I would like to
thank all the book reviewers.Their input was invaluable and helped shape this
book. I would also like to give special thanks to Dr. Eric Cole for providing
world-class feedback, technical analysis, sanity checks and comic relief.
To all the individuals at ArcSight that in one way or another helped make
this book a reality: Robert Shaw,Tom Reilly, Kevin Mosher, Larry Lunetta, Jill
Kyte, Cynthia Hulton, and Dave Anderson.To be fair, the entire ArcSight team
throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia Paciﬁc should be thanked.

I would like to give special thanks to ArcSight’s CTO and Executive Vice
President of Research and Development Hugh Njemanze. Hugh has not only
provided valuable feedback for both of my books to date but has become a
mentor and conﬁdant over the years.
Finally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge my co-authors Bill, Dan and
Colby for all their hard work and dedication.

Many people have contributed to the developing knowledge base on the con-
vergence of physical and logical security and to my own understanding of where
convergence is going and why. In 1998, shortly after being named CEO of
Cylink Corp., Regis McKenna, one of Cylink’s Directors began talking to me
about the move to IP based video services and the role that TCP/IP would play
as the basic infrastructure for moving security information from video cameras
to users. He envisioned a whole new way in which retail stores and enterprise
facilities would monitor video security services and a way for the cost of secu-
rity to be reduced. He had just done a restart of a small streaming video soft-
ware company that he had named Broadware Technologies. Regis asked me to
join the board of Broadware and my trek into the world of video surveillance
and physical security began. Interestingly, the Chairman of Cylink Corporation,
Leo Guthart, was the Vice Chairman of Pittway Corporation and President of
Ademco as well as having been a Director at Cylink for 18 years. One of his
dreams was that physical access cards would merge with smart cards and con-
verge management of identities within large corporations. Cylink had a sub-
sidiary that designed smart cards so Leo encouraged me to embark on a project
to build the dual purpose identity cards for Cylink’s facilities in Silicon Valley.
Broadware also installed its infrastructure in the Cylink facilities to manage cam-
eras on each of the doors and to trigger viewing of the cameras by a mobile
guard service, thereby saving us nearly a $100,000 a year for a full time guard.

Surely we were moving in the right direction, but as we would later learn, we
were well ahead of the adoption curve. We didn’t see the “bubble” that was
going to burst and slow all of our dreams of converging technologies based on
internet protocol. Regis and Leo gave me their vision, but we would all have to
wait for the rest of the world to understand and adopt it.
The events of 9/11 began a fresh look at security and intelligence. A lot of
commissions and panels were established to review what had happened and to
provide insight into new ways of protecting our critical infrastructure, most of
which is privately held. I served on a number of those groups, but none so inﬂu-
ential as the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the
Information Age, chaired by Zoe Baird and Jim Barksdale. Both of these individ-
uals knew that security would have to be improved and made more affordable,
but that the key ingredient in achieving greater security would be the institution-
alization of “information sharing.” I had the good fortune to work with them for
four years along with an incredible team of individuals who forged a new archi-
tecture for information sharing over networks using social networking concepts.
I cannot name all of the members, but two who were most inﬂuential in my
thinking about how information sharing would shape security in the future were
Gilman Louie, then CEO of In-Q-Tel and now a Partner in Alsop-Louie
Partners, and Tara Lemmey, a founder and CEO of LENS Ventures. We spent
countless hours together working on the report, but talking about virtually every-
thing in the world of information technology and security.
The insights that these individuals brought to my thinking about security
launched me into the connecting of all of the technologies that can be part of a
converged security solution. From the basics of video surveillance, network
security, authentication, virus protection, and encryption we are now evolving a
truly integrated set of technologies that include new tools like RFID, video
analytics, sophisticated sensors, that can be connected together, and the events
they record can analyzed and evaluated with great speed and agility.

I dedicate this, my ﬁrst book, to my grandparents who have always guided and
encouraged me when faced with great challenges. I would further like to dedi-
cate this book to my mom, dad, brother, and girlfriend for putting up with me
and providing inspiration while working on this monumental project.

I will start by acknowledging the people who contributed directly to my work.
First I would like to thank Dr. Eric Cole for spending the time to provide valu-
able feedback on my chapters. His insights were not only inspirational, but
actually made me dig deeper into the subjects on which I was researching. I
would like to thank the individuals who provided information regarding their
companies’ speciﬁc technologies, including Craig Chambers from Cernium,
John Donovan from Vidient, Chris Gaskins from NetBotz/APC, Frank Cusack
and Mats Nahlinder both from Tri-D Systems.They were extremely helpful in
providing product information, market information as well as product screen
shots and literature.A special acknowledgement goes to Ben Cook from Sandia
National Laboratories for allowing me to consume several hours interviewing
him.. His perspective and knowledge regarding the protection of critical infras-
tructure was a tremendous help in understanding both the problems in process
control networks as well as what’s being done to correct them. I thank Gabriel
Martinez, a close personal friend, as well as a colleague, for his time and inter-
views regarding penetration testing of process control environments, his prac-
tical, real world experiences were a tremendous help. (I’ll see you in Austin
buddy!) Not to be forgotten is Paul Granier for his help with understanding
more about project LOGIIC and SCADA networks.
I hate to do it, but I must also acknowledge Brian Contos one of my co-
authors for presenting me the opportunity to help write a book.At ﬁrst I was
hesitant and thought he was a little crazy, but the more I thought about it and

ix
talked to him it became clear this was something I had to do. Here I am nine
months later writing an acknowledgement for a book. I also would like to
acknowledge my other two co-authors William Crowell and Dan Dunkel for
their unique perspectives and experiences that have helped shape the ﬁnal
product and for the efforts on their parts in seeing this through to completion.
I look forward to a long and successful partnership.
I would like to thank the individuals who took the time to review the
manuscript and for providing valuable feedback and praise.Your help in getting
the message out there and validating this work is greatly appreciated.
Finally I have to acknowledge the people who have been inﬂuential in my
success as a whole.These are the great people I work with everyday at
ArcSight. I don’t want to leave anyone out because I love working with the
whole team. In engineering there is a core group of people who have always
taken the time to help me even when I had the silliest of questions: Christian
Beedgen, Hector Aguilar, Kumar Saurabh, Stefan Zier, Raju Gottumukkala,
Ankur Lahoti, Senthil Vaiyapuri and I guess even Raffael Marty. In the sales
organization I would like to recognize Laura Tom for always supporting my
efforts, Kevin Mosher, Lars Nilsson and Rick Wescott for always letting me be a
part of. I would like to thank Cynthia Hulton and Jill Kyte for helping me
become the rock star they always said I was. Glen Sharlun I didn’t forget about
you, you are a rock star, too!  I would like to end with a personal thank you to
Hugh Njemanze and Robert Shaw who have always kept an eye on me and
guided my career.

“A sense of security may be difﬁcult to deﬁne, yet we know it
when we feel it.”—Bill Crowell
It is “already the day after tomorrow” and we have now reached a point where
risks and threats to the information infrastructure are a constant risk and threat
to our national and global economy.The need is for a coordinated and secure
global information infrastructure strategy.The burden on the infrastructure will
only get more demanding and complex in the next decade.Three billion of the
world’s 6.5 billion people are about to move into the marketplace along with
an expected exponential growth in generated data.The reality of today’s inter-
connected world is that real-time technologies give us access to an ever-
increasing number of smart machines and devices, which in turn give us access
to an unprecedented abundance of information and services.The marketplace is
crowded not only with a seemingly inﬁnite variety of data, but also with cross-
trafﬁc of many diverse systems, institutions, and people with very different
views of the world. It is time to prepare a comprehensive Internet Protocol
(IP)-based security architecture that is state-of-the-art.
A comprehensive approach to logical and physical security requires both a
political and a social will, as well as enterprising leadership.
This is not only a difﬁcult and complex task, but also one that requires a
coordinated buy-in from all levels of management. In addition, it requires a
commitment to integrate and deploy leading-edge solutions. In today’s volatile
and often hostile marketplace, nothing less than the physical, ﬁnancial, and
human assets of the enterprise are at risk. Bill Crowell, an information and
security expert with some 30 years of government and private experience,
writes:

Foreword
By Regis McKenna

September 11, 2001 was the wake-up call that changed the def-
inition of the security business. Today commercial industry is
too slow to embrace security convergence in a signiﬁcant way
and we are less prepared than we should be. A lack of tech-
nology is not the issue in solving the problem. A collaboration
of effort around the concept of establishing a “mutual
defense” is required.
Achieving a “mutual defense” goal must be driven not only by those who
understand the broader implications and objectives of a free and secure society,
but also by those information and communication professionals who have the
technical knowledge to design and guide its implementation.The authors of
this book are individuals with “hands-on” experience credentials.
All information-intensive organizations operate from an “installed base”
with established standards and processes. Installed systems represent a signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial investment. It is understandable why many organizations choose to
adopt change gradually and with careful consideration of how new approaches
will integrate into existing architectures and processes.Adding cost is always a
consideration.As much as we read about the need for speed and the ability to
always remain ﬂexible and responsive to market and competitive changes and to
consider the cost of long-term ownership, information professionals ﬁnd that
they are barely keeping pace with the growing threats from the increasingly
diverse and proliﬁc forms of cyber crime.
However, change in the world of “installed base” moves slowly.Too often,
we rely on convention and established patterns that lead to our greatest threat:
complacency.The American historian, Daniel Boorstin, when asked what he
learned from studying the history of great discoveries replied,“Progress has not
been impeded by ignorance, but rather by the assumption of knowledge.”
Convergence of physical and logical security using existing IT and IP
infrastructures makes economic sense. Unauthorized and illegal attempts to gain
access to secure data have risen dramatically in the past decade, and each year
brings new variants of threats. CIO/Insight reported “companies now get
hacked, on average, 30 times a week, with 15 percent of attacks resulting in
system entry.”
Similarly, there are a large number of cyber attacks from “inside” the enter-
prise, and property theft, which the retail trade refers to as “inventory
shrinkage,” is costing that industry each year in excess of $30 billion.

Employment records linked in real time to access veriﬁcation systems, radio fre-
quency identiﬁcation (RFID), and other digital tagging devices, as well as digi-
tally deployed surveillance systems, would enhance the efﬁciency, speed of
response, and economic value to the corporation.“Physical security” today
often means “plant or facilities” security using the same methods that were used
50 years ago; in other words, guards and analog cameras.
The Internet is the ﬁrst technology to link global producers and consumers
as well as all the intermediate interconnecting players in a real-time exchange
of information for commercial transactions. It is commonly referred to as the
“supply chain.” But it is far more than the automation of logistical services. It is
interwoven with trade, international funds transfer, direct foreign investment,
regulation, compliance, and security. The information component of the
“supply chain” is getting more efﬁcient, but the physical security of “the supply
chain” has been left far behind.
It is somewhat ironic that although every step in the supply chain has
become more efﬁcient, we have such little knowledge of what actually is in the
containers that arrive at our ports.The convergence of physical and logical
security can well be applied within the global supply chain to rapidly identify
and ensure the protection of inventories and other valuable assets.The value of
world merchandise exports exceeded $10 trillion for the ﬁrst time in 2004,
according to the WTO.1 And the World Bank reported that some 38 percent of
the increase in global output in 2006 originated in developing countries, far
exceeding its 22 percent share in world GDP.2 The global supply chain is going
to scale to manage unprecedented volumes as manufacturing, assembly, and
component sourcing stimulate global trade expansion.
The infrastructure that makes our real-time marketplace tick is in the con-
stant process of expanding, sizing, upgrading, and reinventing itself.
Technological progress does not pause for people or institutions to catch up.
Neither the collapse of “the bubble” nor subsequent decline in high-tech ven-
ture investing nor the devastating impact of 9/11 in 2001 altered or slowed the
progress of Moore’s Law. Nor did these events have a signiﬁcant impact on the
growth of the Internet population, which grew 160 percent from 2000 to
2005.3
A CIO KnowPulse Poll of 170 chief information ofﬁcers (CIOs) in
November 2001 found that 67 percent were “not very conﬁdent” or “not at all
conﬁdent” that law enforcement will provide their companies with sufﬁcient

advance warning of a threat to computer systems.”4 Immediately following
9/11, CIOs and information professionals began assessing their enterprise sys-
tems. Conferences and journals began covering subjects such as “corporate con-
tinuance,”“distributed backup of data storage,” and real-time reporting of
transaction data. Cyber security has become a top priority for the CIO as
unwarranted attempts to access ﬁles from inside and outside the enterprise
increased.
A secure society in the modern world may seem impossible. Even a more
challenging task is ensuring physical security while protecting individual rights
and privacy along with our most basic right: freedom. Physical security, privacy,
and freedom are often in conﬂict in our threatened society where technology is
both the antagonist and the protagonist.Therefore, it is critical that public and
private organizations anticipate potential security problems rather than react to
them.
This book is not about convention. Our real-time, interconnected, and
complex world demands a rethinking of how to architect and deploy the infras-
tructure for the secure enterprise of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Senior executives
will ﬁnd fascinating the detailed case studies of how some businesses succeeded
and how some failed to make security a top priority. It is a strategy handbook
for the CIO and other information professionals. It provides the depth of secu-
rity and logical systems knowledge demanded in today’s increasingly complex
and too often threatening world.

Introduction
Chapter 1
1

Convergence is a word that has become common over the past few years to describe the pro-
cess of reusing and blending various technologies to create new or improved capabilities and
products.As a concept, convergence is derived from the emergence of common technology
building blocks such as microcomputers, software, storage systems, networks that use the
Internet Protocol (IP), wireless IP networks, and actuators (motors, switches, and other con-
trol systems).There are countless examples of how these technologies are brought together
to create new systems, but clearly it is the emergence of the Internet in the early 1990s and
the global acceptance of IP that are driving the current wave of “converged” technologies.
Before the dawn of the Internet, most converged systems simply comprised various
technologies that were merged into a new tool.The Walkman began as a radio, and evolved
into a tape-based audio player, then a CD player, and then the iPod and other portable
devices for audio and video capture and playback.Along the way, all sorts of new technolo-
gies found their way into these converging platforms, including ﬂash memory, LCD ﬂat
screens (and, now, Organic Light Emitting Diode [OLED] screens), low-power microproces-
sors, touch screens, actuator control wheels, MP3 audio compression (or in the case of the
iPod, the AAC ﬁle format), and IP connections to computers and to wired and wireless net-
works. It was the convergence of audio (and now video) distribution via the Internet that
provided the breakout from merely making a device that was smaller, faster, cheaper, and
more capable into one that is “connected.”
In many cases, convergence drove the industries involved toward standardization, where
it promoted the use of new products, but in other cases, there was stiff competition among
proprietary protocols or techniques in order to capture and keep market share.The iPod
entered the market at the end of a bloody ﬁght between the record industry and the pur-
veyors of peer-to-peer networks that were being used to distribute copyrighted music ille-
gally (which the courts determined was a violation of copyright laws and not within the
deﬁnition of “fair use” rules).Apple entered this market with an iPod that used AAC rather
than MP3, and launched iTunes to give users easy access to music for purchase over the
Internet, thus capturing 85 percent of the market for this kind of service and for portable
music/entertainment devices. Ironically, this lack of standardization in ﬁle formats and
recording methods is still having an impact on the acceptance of new systems in Internet
distribution of music and video (see the sidebar,“Betamax Revisited,” at the end of this
Introduction).
Throughout history, technology has had a very large impact on security.As humans
developed and their safety from predators and other humans became a major focus, they
looked for new ways to decrease risk and to increase leverage over their opponents. From
the earliest weapons, alarms, physical barriers, and surveillance tools they crafted ever-ﬁner
mechanisms to protect themselves or to attack their enemies. In a sense, we are seeing the
ultimate reﬁnement of these tools with the convergence of modern physical security, infor-
mation security, and surveillance tools via the Internet and IP-based enterprise networks.
Surveillance has evolved from “lookouts” and scouts, to CATV and surveillance aircraft,
and now to IP-based video that can support thousands of cameras, both ﬁxed and mobile
(such as the Predator UAV, see photos), which you can locate virtually anywhere in the

world and view in real time or as archived images wherever you may be.You can archive the
images for as long as you need them and you can automate the selection of images to view
using video analytics that can spot a lingering person, a box that someone has left behind, or
a person “tailgating” through a controlled access doorway. Some video analytics companies
promise (but as yet have not delivered as reliable systems) the capability to recognize a face
and match it to recorded facial images.The video events can be tagged and logged, and can
be used in conjunction with other security systems and devices such as the radio frequency
identiﬁcation (RFID) tag that automates the entry and exit of all employees and logs these
events to document who is present or not present in a facility.
Information systems can be protected with the same identity management system that is
used for physical access, and the events in one can be compared or correlated to the events
in the other, alerting you, for example, to a person’s attempt to access the network or an
application using an identity that is not present in the facility, or vice versa.Actions by
human resources (HR) departments to remove an employee or partner from the company
payroll can have an immediate and synchronized impact on physical or logical access privi-
leges, instead of being operated in separate silos with uneven results. Financial- and privacy-
controlled records can be given higher degrees of protection, with every access or change
being logged and compared with regulatory restrictions and policies. Events in one part of
the company can be correlated with events in other departments or locations anywhere in a
global enterprise.
Using these converged technologies, you can subject the global supply chain to nearly
the same levels of scrutiny as the enterprise it supports, and spot anomalies early to avoid dis-
ruption (assuming the supply chain partners will agree to abide by your policies and give
you access to the necessary systems under some sort of agreement on liability and security
for their own systems).You can use RFID tagging to track shipments, as well as their loca-
tions, temperatures, and history of access by port or destination personnel.You can use video
to monitor the interiors of shipping containers, radiation detection, and hundreds of other
parameters, all of which you can correlate with agreements, regulations, and policies.
Dangerous industries such as chemical, biological, and radiological can be subjected to
increased assessment by government regulators as well as the operators of the businesses.
The power of combining video surveillance, RFID tagging, identity management, infor-
mation security, and physical security systems into event collection systems where the secu-
rity events can be correlated to further reﬁne policy and regulatory adherence is in its
infancy, but because of the convergence of technologies supporting all of these security ele-
ments, it will someday soon be possible.
This book explores the entire range of possible outcomes in the continuing convergence
of security technologies with IP networks.

Security Concepts 
and the Impact of Convergence
Security is a word that stirs negative images in most people’s minds today. It describes to them
a circumstance of uncertainty about the safety of their property or themselves. It also
describes a set of tools for providing safety that are restrictive and that interfere with their
lives or their work. In a number of interviews with senior executives at the CEO and CFO
levels, the Unisys Corporation in a study it conducted about what constitutes the basis for a
“Trusted Enterprise” found that many CXOs (the half dozen most-senior ofﬁcers of an
enterprise, such as the CEO, CFO, and CIO) were not interested in discussing security as a
major concern of their jobs.To them, security was what guards do. Some, who were more
connected to their CIOs, thought of security as the role played by chief security ofﬁcers
(CSOs) or chief information security ofﬁcers (CISOs), jobs that are several levels below the
CXO. In short, they considered “security” a matter that was not part of their daily thinking
or that of their boards of directors. But in these interviews, when the conversation turned to
“risk” and “risk management,” their interest and their involvement in the interview changed
dramatically.
Risk and risk management are very much a part of what keeps CEOs and boards awake
at night.The risks they are concerned with involve a long list of business operations and pro-
cesses, but they are generally those that impact revenue generation (sales, marketing, quality,
delivery, and competition), ﬁnancial performance (margins, costs, the supply chain, and pro-
ductivity), future performance (product development, technology, and intellectual property),
and increasingly, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).There was a time
when risk in each of these areas was easily identiﬁed and segmented as a responsibility of a
single line manager and a simple set of security concerns, but today that has changed with
the shift to businesses that are networkcentric, are globalized, and have from hundreds to
thousands of critical supply chain partners.
Now the threats can come from many different sources—internally (the insider threat),
externally (organized crime and hackers), and from supply chain partners.Technology has
made all of the assets of the enterprise more accessible. Critical information assets such as
intellectual property, product plans, ﬁnancial performance, merger and acquisition activities,
and key personnel resources are accessible by insiders with approved network access to critical
software applications that support the daily activities of the enterprise.Without the proper
security and access control mechanisms, they can also be accessed physically by insiders.
These same assets are also accessible using network attacks by outsiders who explore and
penetrate the weak perimeters of many corporate networks and Web interfaces to critical
applications, particularly customer-facing or supply-chain-facing applications. In addition,
outsider access can be enhanced by the recruitment of insiders to furnish important informa-
tion about the protective measures in place in the network’s perimeter or key applications.
An example of this occurred in 1994, when Russian hacker Vladimir Levin attacked
Citibank.According to bank sources, Levin transferred $10 million from customer accounts

to his own accounts in foreign banks. Citigroup had elaborate internal mechanisms in place
to prevent such acts, but they failed in this case.Their have been stories of insider assistance,
but no evidence of such assistance has ever been acknowledged.
The globalization of business has been dramatic and profound in the past decade. In the
manufacturing world, the process started many years ago, with Japan,Taiwan, and Korea, but
in recent years it has shifted to other South Asian countries and to China.The result is that
most of the network devices in use today are either made with chips produced in these
countries or completely assembled in these countries. Network security depends on the sta-
bility, reliability and trustworthiness of these devices.
In the software development world, a similar trend is evident. Starting with call centers
and software coding, India, China, Russia, and Israel have become centers for the develop-
ment of all sorts of software, including telecommunications, security, network management,
and ﬁnancial applications.The challenge for U.S. enterprises, particularly for the ﬁnancial
institutions as well as government, military, and critical infrastructure segments, is to manage
this offshore process in such a way that they can ensure that the applications are free of
errors, bugs,Trojan horses, and other security threats.
Evolving Threats
Throughout time, the balance of power between evolving threats and responses has been
driven by technology. It has been a seesaw battle wherein a new technology threatens to
change the course of power, but where the quick introduction of countermeasures can elim-
inate or weaken the advantage.
This is perhaps best illustrated in the stories from World War II by R. V. Jones in his
book, The Wizard War: British Scientiﬁc Intelligence, 1939-1945, in which he chronicled the use
of scientiﬁc intelligence to discover German technical advances, assess their impact on British
defenses, and then develop countermeasures to render the German advances less effective.
Among his disclosures in the book are Germany’s development of radar (a German invented
radar in 1904, but the ﬁrst practical devices were developed by the United States and the
United Kingdom in 1935) and Britain’s development of countermeasures using thin strips of
metal foil dropped in clusters to fool the German defensive radars into thinking that there
were large numbers of allied bombers entering German airspace. R. V. Jones also developed
countermeasures against the German Knickebein system to assist bombers in blind-bombing
U.K. targets by ﬂying into intersecting radio beams.Throughout the war, Jones also concen-
trated on ﬁnding countermeasures to every British military technology development and
then ﬁnding counter-countermeasures that could be used to keep British technology
advances viable.
Such is the nature of the current use of technology in security systems. For every threat
there are technologies that we can bring online to counter that threat.The window of time
between when a threat is introduced to when a countermeasure is developed is of critical
importance.As our most important enterprise assets migrate to networkcentric systems and
are increasingly accessible via the Internet and enterprise networks, it is increasingly important

to close the window of opportunity for introduction of a new risk and the availability of a
response. Convergence gives us a chance to build responses based on the basic building blocks
of converged systems discussed earlier, and the ease of deployment of IP-based systems. It also
enhances the development and deployment of new threats.
One of the reasons we need to deploy defense in depth is to increase the number of
barriers in place in order to shorten the window of vulnerability, whether in physical secu-
rity or logical security systems. IP convergence gives us another way to achieve this defense
in depth besides deploying increased layers of defense, and that is the use of correlation of
security events to gain additional insight into attacks that might otherwise not be detectable.
The use of Enterprise Security Management (ESM) or Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) to correlate security events across the entire spectrum of network,
application, and logical security events is a promising area of advancement in security sys-
tems.You also can use ESM to correlate physical security events identiﬁed by video analytics,
sensors, and guards and to cross-correlate all of these events against very complex business
rules and processes to spot vulnerabilities and attacks.This increased depth of view into
enterprise risk is spawned by the emergence of converged security technologies.
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment has many components, but clearly it involves examining the valuable assets
of the enterprise to see whether they are protected from harm or theft. We tend to think in
very narrow dimensions about the assets of various sectors of our economy and government.
The ﬁnancial sector conjures up images of money as the principal asset.The transportation
industry is primarily viewed in terms of equipment and the operators of the equipment who
provide for our safety. But in reality, the assets of any enterprise sweep across a wide spec-
trum that must be protected with only slightly varying degrees of importance, depending on
the sector.
The physical assets such as buildings, computers, networks, and documents are funda-
mental to the continuing viability of the business.Theft, damage, disruption, and alteration of
these assets must be avoided.Traditionally this has been the job of the physical security
department. Using access control mechanisms and processes such as badges, door locks, safes,
ﬁre detection devices, CATV, and alarms, the physical security department has historically
sought to provide this protection.The cost of these efforts has been not only the capital costs
of equipment and facilities, but increasingly the costs associated with growing guard forces
and their management.The risk assessment involved in this function has always been favored
by the clear value that can be ascribed to the physical assets versus the costs associated with
providing reasonable protection. For many enterprises, the events of 9/11 were a watershed
in that the vulnerabilities of these assets became larger and the range of defenses and coun-
termeasures was not entirely in the hands of the physical security department, but now
extended beyond the enterprise even more.
The network is now fundamental to the success of almost every enterprise in the
United States, if not the world.Almost every business is now networkcentric, including vir-

tually every segment of business, government, and the military. Without the network (and,
therefore, protection of the network), we could not conduct modern business or government
services or conduct military operations. Beginning in the early 1990s, the technology under-
lying this connectivity began swinging quickly from circuit-switched circuitry to IP-based
networks. Within business enterprises, this change came most quickly, such that in most
modern business networks, the majority of the network is now IP or IP over switched cir-
cuits.The cheap availability of IP routers and switches, along with wireless access technology,
is driving this transformation along with standardization of network devices, operating sys-
tems, applications, and Web services.
The shift to IP networks came more slowly in the Tier 1 telecommunications providers.
Saddled with large inventories of expensive computerized circuit switches and circuit-based
services (T1,T3, etc.) and the use of circuit protocols such as Frame Relay and
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), the telcos pushed the IP trafﬁc as payloads within
these circuit-based systems rather than adopting all IP-based routing of trafﬁc.The events
following the telco meltdown in 2000 further exacerbated the delay in the transformation to
an IP-based network infrastructure. Ironically, it is IP that is fueling the telco comeback.
According to Internetnew.com in a February 2005 article,“Demand for IP telephony and
convergence communications equipment are key drivers behind renewed growth in the
telecommunications industry, according to an industry outlook report”
With the widespread adoption of all IP networks by the carriers comes increased pro-
ductivity, reduced costs, and more—not less—security vulnerabilities.
Another trend that accompanies this move to IP-based networks is the increasing use of
network services for basic business processes. Salesforce.com has had a remarkably successful
run in the market. Its service model includes network-based access to its entire database of
contacts, ongoing sales progress, and critical milestones for sales performance. It is successful
because of the unifying business process that it fosters and the universal access that it brings
to the process, but it also introduces new security vulnerabilities that must be mitigated.
Most companies understand this and have a series of security measures in place to deter
unauthorized access, but it nevertheless is a vulnerability that must be addressed. It is widely
believed that by 2010, many, if not all, of the large enterprise business processes will be
online as Web-based services using Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs).According to
Wikipedia,“Another challenge is providing appropriate levels of security.The security
model built into an application may no longer be appropriate when the capabilities of the
application are exposed as services that can be used by other applications.That is, applica-
tion-managed security is not the right model for securing services.A number of new tech-
nologies and standards are emerging to provide more appropriate models for security in
SOA.” Once again, the introduction of new technologies provides huge productivity and
competitive advantages to business enterprises, but they are being adopted well ahead of the
security mechanisms needed to protect against vulnerabilities.
People are an increasingly valuable asset in the emerging competitive environment of
the global economy.They also are a vulnerable element in the growing complexity of our
systems and business processes. Providing them a safe and productive environment in which

to work is key to maintaining them as a viable resource. Security protects them, their work
products, and their privacy.Transparency in security systems gives them greater comfort that
they are not in a prison, and instead are working in a place where they are protected, but
their productivity is not impaired by that security.
Striking this balance is an increasing challenge for the various security components of an
enterprise, but this can be made easier through security convergence. Even if there is only one
identity management system for the enterprise, it not only decreases the cost and improves
the performance of the system, but also reduces the burden and visibility to the employee.
Likewise, common access systems, automated door openers, integrated HR systems, and inte-
grated network and application access based on a common identity management system are
more productive and less visible to the employee.The workforce has embraced IP conver-
gence in their iPods, MP3 systems, whole-house networks, wireless connectivity, and other
consumer products and they are eager to see their employers do the same.
Many leading ﬁnancial institutions and insurance providers learned from the 1993 attack
on the World Trade Center that backup and restoral was a key ingredient in being a resilient
enterprise. Ironically, in an article in CIO News dated August 13, 2001, just prior to the 9/11
attacks, the aftermath of the 1993 attacks was reported with the following words: “Most of
the larger businesses in the World Trade Center relied on replication, and their data is safe.”
With the increasing reliance on IT services for virtually all business processes, the poten-
tial loss of business transaction data is not acceptable. Many, but unfortunately not all, of the
businesses in the World Trade Center had moved to back up their data on a daily basis and
transfer it to a remote site, usually at least 10 miles away, in New Jersey. Some also had estab-
lished remote data centers that were capable of restoring operations with the backup data, if
required. Most did not have redundancy in their data centers, and although they had the
backed-up data in warehouses, such as Iron Mountain, they had no ability to reconstitute
operations until they acquired new equipment and reconnected into the remaining net-
works.That was a horrible way to learn a lesson about the need for business continuity in
today’s Internet-centric business world.A disaster, natural or terrorist-created, is the most
stressful situation that a business can ﬁnd itself facing, but it is not the only one.
With business operations moving to the network and to the Internet and the Web, it is
even more essential today to plan for disasters, both small and large. Reconstitution of busi-
ness processes becomes a way in which customers and business partners judge an enterprise’s
resilience and, therefore, its trustworthiness. In January 2003, the SQ: Slammer Worm was
released into the Internet and resulted in signiﬁcant impacts on both Verizon and Bank of
America. In Verizon’s case, the SQL worm crippled the servers that provided the registration
and account services for its Wireless Service Centers across the country.About 4,000 service
centers had to be shut down because they could not access customer accounts or set up new
accounts. Verizon later went to court in an effort to recover some of its lost revenue and
some of the costs of network services, and in an article in the Maine Bar Journal, Jane
Strachan reported that in an “administrative proceeding decided by the Maine Public
Utilities Commission (PUC), Verizon sought a waiver of wholesale performance metrics
because the Microsoft SQL Slammer Worm … had attacked Verizon’s servers.As a result,

Verizon could not meet its performance standards.Therefore, Verizon requested a reduction
in the wholesale credits owed to AT&T Communications of New England (AT&T) and
WorldCom. However, the PUC would have no part of Verizon’s arguments and ordered it to
pay the full amount of the credits.” Consistently, the courts have ruled that worm and virus
attacks are to be anticipated as threats and that businesses should take adequate measures to
protect themselves against them.
In the case of Bank of America, about 13,000 ATMs were shut down by the attack.
According to a Washington Post article,“The bank’s ATMs sent encrypted information
through the Internet, and when the data slowed to a crawl, it stymied transactions, according
to a source, who said customer ﬁnancial information was never in danger of being stolen.”
In both of these cases, not only was the business disrupted, but an additional cost was
associated with the image that the events portrayed about their capability to recognize threats
and mitigate them that had a negative but immeasurable impact on their brand.
Probably one of the most important ingredients in the globalization of business is the
ease with which new supply partners can be brought online anywhere in the world at
reduced costs and enhanced delivery. Much of this success can be attributed to the use of the
network to bind these partners directly into the product planning and manufacturing pro-
cess, wherever it is located. Parts can be manufactured anywhere whenever they are needed,
cutting down on inventories, reducing obsolescence, and ultimately allowing for greater
market success and margins.
Although this is beneﬁcial, it is not without risk. In many cases, these partners are
brought directly into the corporate network through IP network connections that allow
them to access order levels, pricing, and, in some cases, customer data. Without proper safe-
guards, these partners can be either witting or unwitting pathways to corporate data, the loss
of which can be very damaging to ongoing business operations or to competitive advantage.
Very often access controls in vendor organizations are not up to the standards of the
buying enterprise that has made its network available. Securing the supply chain is one of
the most difﬁcult and politically charged aspects of securing enterprise business lines. Most
vendors don’t want to meet the security standards of each of the hundreds of customers they
serve, particularly because all of them are likely to be different.
The challenge is to provide the level of access needed to ensure increased productivity
while still wrapping the rest of the company’s Internet-based processes and assets in layers of
protective systems to thwart attack.The most important ingredient in securing the supply
chain is assurance that the supplier has a credible identity management system for network
access.Another is the use of staged information mirrored off the databases and subjected to
rigorous business process scrutiny.A third is to maintain a very tight view of network activi-
ties using ESM to identify anomalies in access to data, applications, and network assets.
Information on customers, plans, and intellectual property in databases, networks, and
applications is a core asset of networkcentric businesses.The loss of customer data has
become an epidemic and is increasingly being punished by legal and regulatory requirements
of the states and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Federal agencies have also been
involved in such losses and the result has been congressional censure, public ridicule, and, in

some cases, the resignation or ﬁring of key individuals. In corporate cases, FTC rulings have
levied large ﬁnes on the corporations that were involved.The losses that we have seen of
customer identity data have, for the most part, been avoidable, and therefore, it is clear that
the availability of personally identiﬁable information in corporate America and in govern-
ment has not been accompanied by a growth in the concern for its protection.The new laws
and regulations promise to change the perspective of these data holders, but largely it was
and is an avoidable problem if the data is parsed, encrypted, or given other extra protections
and layers of defense.
Intellectual property and trade secrets are often stored on servers in the engineering
department with password protection and little else. Engineers want ready access to their
daily work and security beyond passwords is often unwanted or undermined.The use of
design tools, testing laboratories, and modeling tools requires access to source code, and
therefore it is made readily available to those directly involved in product engineering,
testing, manufacturing, quality control, and outsourcing of manufacturing.All of these
accesses require more controls to ensure that the information is not lost inadvertently or to
competitors.
Risk Mitigation
Risk mitigation has historically been a process that has been centered in one of a set of busi-
ness silos or one of a set of functional silos, such as the physical security ofﬁce, the informa-
tion security ofﬁcer, HR, or ﬁnancial services. Sometimes risk assessment was shared
between a business unit and a functional organization, but with mixed results.
Physical security ofﬁces provided a deﬁned set of services such as a guard force, fences
and physical barriers of all sorts, alarms and the associated response services, investigative ser-
vices, and CATV (which, as you will see later in this book, is on the brink of being declared
dead as IP-based video surveillance with associated video analytics take its place).
The information security function involved a number of well-deﬁned methods for pro-
tecting data in transit, particularly when the data left the conﬁnes of the corporation and
entered public networks. Functions such as encryption, access controls (primarily passwords),
ﬁrewalls, antivirus systems, and intrusion detection systems were the standard tools for pro-
tecting the network. Passwords were the primary means of protecting applications, and
storage systems generally had very little or no protection.
HR often had the task of vetting the backgrounds and trustworthiness of employees and
others with insider access.The tools they used were often crude and ineffective, such as calls
to references (all of which were furnished by the employee). Meanwhile, the ﬁnance depart-
ment was often charged with the evaluation of risks associated with partners in the supply
chain.The idea that they had any responsibility to control the access of those partners to the
enterprise network was something they might choose to throw to the CIO, but usually
without any muscle behind the effort.
The digital revolution and IP convergence are changing much of this silo approach to
one of enterprise security. Security has become a shared function, enabled by the network
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • Introduction

and new security applications that run on it.As you will see throughout this book, the forces
of convergence are very strong in the security ﬁeld.The transformation is bringing all secu-
rity technologies onto a common platform, the enterprise network, with the ability to con-
nect distributed pieces of the security system together over the Internet.A systems approach
is now possible so that all of the modern security technologies can be used cooperatively and
events in one part of the system can be correlated with events anywhere else in the system
using policies and rules to bring events into ﬁner focus and understanding.
The previous approaches to risk discovery and risk mitigation were anything but net-
workcentric.They were self-contained and did not allow for correlation except by human
communication, which in the modern global enterprise is neither adequate nor suitable for
modern global threats. What is needed and is now emerging is a uniﬁed set of security tools
with increasingly uniﬁed management tools that make security more affordable and more
adaptable to changing threats.
CATV, once a closed cable system with static recording devices located within the
facility being monitored, is morphing into an open system based on IP and running in the
enterprise network and on the Internet to provide worldwide access to cameras by viewers
anywhere in the corporation. BroadWare Technologies has championed the concept of a
universal video infrastructure, embedded in the enterprise network and running on servers
and network attached storage (NAS) devices.The advantage of its approach is that the analog
cameras of the prior generation of video surveillance can be encoded in IP-based video-
standard formats such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 and are still usable in a video surveillance
system. Storage, which is becoming very cheap, can be attached to the network at distributed
locations, central locations, or both, regardless of brand, and viewers can be anywhere in the
world where they have an Internet or network connection using standard browsers or spe-
cialized client software. In essence, BroadWare, through its APIs, can adapt to almost any
need or network environment, including providing the interface for video analytics to be
added to the system. Its system, with standardized interface, video servers, integrated storage,
universal viewing platforms, and instant reconﬁguration capabilities, provides the undercar-
riage for the convergence of video surveillance into the IP services regime.
Another area of enormous change in the security world that was founded and is now
being expanded by the use of the Internet is the vetting of human resources as being trust-
worthy employees or partners. In the past, this process was very costly and imprecise. Most
employee background checks consisted of very thin reference checks, and in some cases (such
as for critical or bonded jobs), criminal records and ﬁnancial records were checked as well.
Today this function is increasingly more thorough and more affordable through the use
of Internet-based services that provide data aggregation of public records (ChoicePoint,
LexisNexis,Axion, etc.), Web searches, automated access to ﬁnancial records of credit
bureaus, and so on.Although there are many privacy concerns about these approaches, many
of these companies have instituted very solid programs for the protection of privacy and have
responded to the concerns of the FTC and privacy advocates in a responsible way. Hiring
trustworthy employees is a very important part of preserving an enterprise brand and
avoiding criminal or unethical acts.

Most large companies today have moved away from open corporate facilities and now
operate relatively sophisticated systems of gates and portals for the entry of employees and
the control of outside visitors. Employees have badges, many with RFID tags, for gaining
access to the facility and, in some cases, speciﬁc rooms or areas of the company.Although
some of these systems have event logging and rudimentary analysis tools for examining the
logs, most of these are very difﬁcult to use effectively for physical security analysis and
cannot be used in conjunction with other security systems such as logical access to networks
and applications.
All of that will change with the increasing use of IP-based physical security access con-
trol systems and ESM. By logging security events, such as the entry of an employee at a par-
ticular portal or facility and then correlating that event with other data, such as logical access
to a ﬁnancial management application on the network, anomalies in identities or access to
critical business systems can be monitored with increasingly ﬁner precision. Ultimately, poli-
cies regarding who, what, when, how, and where access is allowed, can be formulated and
monitored to provide both better security and compliance reporting.
As the convergence of physical and logical systems progresses in the future, we will see
the emergence of very complex systems that allow us to compare events across entire global
enterprises with increasing precision and more productivity.The power of correlation, anal-
ysis, and policy enforcement will become the new measure of effectiveness for security sys-
tems and will support many new models for discovering risk, establishing routine monitoring
of these risks and triggering responses that can mitigate these risks in real time.
Security over IP: A Double-Edged Sword
We do not cover the security of large networks and the Internet in any great detail in this
book. For one, many good books on that subject are available today, but also, the dynamics of
network security are such that many of the core principles are being revised almost every day.
In the early days of the Internet and enterprise networks, the security of those systems
was focused on the perimeter and the wide area network (WAN). Most security professionals
were focused on encryption, authentication (albeit mostly with passwords), ﬁrewalls, and virus
protection and intrusion detection at the ﬁrewall.As the threats have become more sophisti-
cated and the permeable nature of IP has become better understood, the focus is now shifting
to meet insider threats, deception attacks (phishing and other techniques for eliciting personal
information and network access names and passwords),Trojans and spyware, and man-in-the-
middle attacks against access control systems, encryption, and common IP applications such as
Internet Explorer. In addition, hackers and criminals alike have used the denial of service
(DOS) attack as an instrument to bring down networks and Web-based services.
All of these threats become obstacles to the adoption of Security over IP, just as they are
obstacles to the widening use of the Internet for e-commerce and global supply chain man-
agement.Although the approach to dealing with them is similar (or in some cases identical),
security professionals in the physical security world are very reticent to risk it.The problem is
that soon they will have no choice, just as those who are building market share in banking, e-

commerce, supply chain management, sales management, and ﬁnancial services have had no
choice. Competition in the commercial world and budget restraints in government dictate
that we use the most effective, reliable, and affordable solutions available.The equipment, tools,
and applications for physical security are moving to IP because by using IP, they take advan-
tage of common building blocks such as computer processors, memory, operating systems,
software modules, sensors, and network elements that are cheaper, easier to deploy, and built
on common standards of connectivity. Remember, convergence combines not only the basic
technology building blocks of smaller, faster, cheaper, but also now the additional element of
“connected” that is so essential to building new approaches and processes for effective risk
identiﬁcation and mitigation.The physical security world will have to set performance stan-
dards for CIOs to meet, they will have to be actively involved in the evaluation of network
risks, and they will have to build redundancy, resiliency, and restorability into their systems, but
they will not be able to avoid the rush to IP. For them, convergence is like the iPod has been
to the CD-ROM industry: a dreaded, but inevitable, shift in the market.
Notes from the Underground…
Betamax Revisited
Wikipedia has documented a famous case in which a vendor attempted to
corner a market for a modern consumer electronics device, in its entry on the
Sony 
Betamax 
standard. 
The 
article, 
“The 
legacy 
of 
Betamax”
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax), chronicles the history of Sony’s devel-
opment of a superior technique for recording video images on analog tape
and how its efforts to retain its market position by keeping its technology pro-
prietary was totally defeated in the market by a less-capable technology that
was licensed freely to competing manufacturers. Sony has recently repeated
this approach with technologies such as the Memory Stick, the Universal
Memory Disk, and now Blu-ray, with mixed success. The entire Wikipedia
article is well worth a read by anyone who believes that the best technology
will always win in the marketplace.
The Betamax story has been repeated often in the security industry, with
sometimes-similar outcomes, but there were also a lot of winners who were
successful with proprietary approaches. It is very conceivable that convergence
will change all of that. The emergence of the IP network as the common foun-
dation of security devices means that many of the proprietary solutions
become outmoded, more costly, and less effective. IP connections to the net-
work provide the same universal interface that the RCA phono plug has pro-
vided to the audio industry for the past 60+ years. The value of universal

connectivity is so great that many proprietary approaches will disappear as the
market advantages of staying proprietary become less attractive. 
The Blu-ray high-deﬁnition DVD may give us a chance to observe this
phenomenon again. Although Blu-ray technology, particularly its security
technology, may be superior to that of the HD DVD, there is an interesting
new feature to this contest. Market forces, such as which studios support
which format(s), will be at work in this ﬁght just as they were in the
Betamax/VHS format wars, but the new force will be the convergence of the
underlying technologies. LG has already shipped its ﬁrst HDTV recording
device and it supports both Blu-ray and HD DVD. This is possible because the
mechanical, electrical, and optical features of both standards are so similar
and because both formats are delivered to the projector or TV over a standard
interface, HDMI. The move to dual-format drives could make the war between
the formats moot for the consumer and, therefore, be just another expense in
the licensing and manufacturing of the systems, just as what happened in the
DVD+R and DVD–R battles.
Convergence in the security business offers a real opportunity to stan-
dardize the sensors, the network connections, and the reporting of events that
could drive real productivity, cost, and performance gains in the industry.

Introduction
Physical security involves applying resources to the task of protecting our physical, human,
and intellectual property assets from plunder, theft, or exploitation. Looking back to its his-
torical roots, there is a clear line of development from the science and art of warfare. In par-
ticular, technologies that can improve the efﬁciency and affordability of physical security
have largely come from military and defense research and development.
In today’s world, and particularly in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, physical security is the center of attention in
almost every element of protecting government facilities, business enterprises, and even
public gatherings such as the Olympics and the Super Bowl.As this focus on physical secu-
rity gains momentum globally, it is evolving to become embedded within the core practice
of risk management.The convergence of IT with physical and logical security solutions
accelerates this trend and redeﬁnes security beyond traditional implementations into an
expanded global policy.
Although the historical base requirement of securing people and property remains
sound, its actual application is integrating with other sciences. We can identify similarities
between the military management models of command and control systems and those in
industrial corporations.Although in both instances these processes have historic roots in the
evolution of organized militaries and organized labor, the basic models are also evolving with
the deployment of information technologies and are changing the basic function of manage-
ment.The process of directing and controlling the operations of a business or military orga-
nization is embracing more collaboration across multiple information sources, and is
integrating cross–functional,“real-time” communications into a process that has historically
been top-down and authoritative.
As the security industry advances to incorporate new technologies and business pro-
cesses, it is important to understand the context within which this change is occurring.
Malware is malicious software designed to inﬁltrate computers.A blended threat is a com-
bination of different malware components, including worms and computer virus programs,
which use multiple techniques to attack and propagate.A collaboration strategy to ﬁght mal-
ware across an Internet Protocol (IP) network can be effective if utilized with automated
software functionality providing enhanced defenses against malware. For example, software
restriction policies and malicious software removal tools can be implemented, along with
user account controls which provide access without administrator privileges.This reduces the
installation of unauthorized software and unapproved system changes.
A historical review is in order based on world events being profoundly altered as a direct
result of the current impact of technical change upon society. Many may point to the Industrial
Revolution as an example of greater societal upheaval. However, acclaimed futurist Alan Tofﬂer,
author of Future Shock, feels that the pace of change today is much faster and more compli-
cated. He explains in comparing the industrial age to the knowledge economy:“Society was
www.syngress.com
16
Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

much smaller than it is now.And the whole experience was slower. It took 300 years. It was
not global; it happened in England, then Europe and the U.S. and a few other places.”
He elaborates:“By contrast, if you look at change today, the scale is enormous, it’s
increasingly global, and it’s happening at what our ancestors would have regarded as an
unbelievable speed. So it seems to me that it is therefore bigger, more complex, and more
difﬁcult to understand than the Industrial Revolution.”
Tofﬂer is an expert at observing change across multiple boundaries such as academics,
economics, sociology, and history.To view security in the global context of historical
advancements over thousands of years and the impact of political events spanning recent
decades, the Olympic Games provide a unique vantage point.
The Olympic Games provide a historical timeline for security advancements generally,
and they serve as a benchmark in securing society against modern-day terrorist attacks and
improving general risk assessment policy.The Games began at Olympia, in Greece, in 776
BC.The modern Olympic Games are named for athletic contests held in ancient Greece for
almost 12 centuries.They were banned in 394 AD but were revived and made international
in 1896.The Winter Games were added in 1924. World War I and World War II forced can-
cellation of the Olympics in 1916, 1940, and 1944, but the Games resumed in 1948 and are
held every four years.
We cannot examine the modern Olympics at length without the subject of terrorism or
security entering the discussion.The Summer Games of 1972 became the stage for
Palestinian terrorists to murder 11 innocent Israeli athletes in Munich. Many experts con-
sider this the beginning of modern-day terrorist activity, as well as its introduction to the
worldwide media as a channel for communications. Perhaps with the inclusion of this hor-
riﬁc and historic incident, the Olympic Games truly do represent the absolute best and
worst of mankind. It is an unfortunate question to ponder.
In spite of that tragedy and in honoring the true nature of Olympic competition, the
nations of the world compete aggressively for the right to host the games in an effort to high-
light everything beautiful about the event and their respective countries. Only later do they
realize that the unbelievable costs associated with securing these international proceedings can
extend to well more than $1 billion. In an unprecedented series of events, the city of London
was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, edging out Paris by only four votes after an
18-month campaign.The entire country was in celebration on the evening of July 6, 2005,
only to have the afterglow shattered during the following morning’s rush hour by a series of
coordinated terrorist attacks on the London transportation system. Responsibility for the
deaths of 52 innocent people and countless injured was claimed by an Al Qaeda afﬁliate oper-
ating a cell in the city of Luton, and established by London-born Muslim citizens.The four
suicide bombers were also killed, but video surveillance cameras tracked their movements and
led to excellent and timely police work in breaking up the cell.The events of July 7 forced a
rebudgeting priority in regard to securing the Olympics in 2012.
Perhaps Figure 2.1, which was published by the Wall Street Journal and compares the cost
of security per athlete per Olympic Games over the past 20 years, provides insight into the
current and future states of security preparedness and managing global risk.The twenty-ﬁrst

century surely has ushered in a new era of security concerns for society. Games today are
anything but games; the bigger the event, the larger the potential target. In order to live and
work with peace of mind, we must be secure. Calculating and prioritizing risk and applying
new technologies toward preventing accidents, fraud, violence, cyber threats, and terrorism
will be an increasing part of normal life. It is important to understand how our state of secu-
rity evolved and where it is heading. It is also important to stay focused and to believe in the
positive nature of mankind. Let the games begin.
Figure 2.1 Comparing the Cost of Security per Athlete per Olympic Games
over the Past 20 Years
The Olympic Games are a mirror into the competitive nature of societies and their
populations. Just as the history of warfare can trace advances in ﬁghting strategies and
weapons systems, the Olympics can trace the positive aspect of cooperation among nation
states over the ages.The Olympics have been a model of political goodwill, festival, and tra-
dition that provides a positive example of countries working together for the greater good of
sportsmanship.The attention of the world was greatly increased with the live broadcast of the
events during the 1960 Games in Rome. It was not until the 1972 terrorist attacks that this
global visibility was hijacked for political purposes and mass murder.A world stage that had
up to that point been focused on friendly competition was now being used for a purpose
diametrically opposed to its original core values.
Unfortunately, that event in 1972 changed the world view of terrorism and the Olympic
Games. Since that time, Olympic security has been a front-burner issue for countries partici-

pating in the event and organizers dedicated to never having the Games hijacked on a world
stage again.As a result, as global terrorist activities have increased, so has the investment in
security required in order to keep the international event safe.As more technology has been
deployed to provide capabilities to terrorist organizations, additional counterterrorism mea-
sures have been deployed to mitigate those new risks.The result has been a spiraling upward
projection in the cost of Olympic security since the most recent attacks of September 11
brought the world to a new era of extreme risk and the need for extreme security counter-
measures.
This chapter will explore some of the more obvious roots of physical security in the
development of formal defensive methods and how some of those may have evolved into the
modern systems that are in use today to protect our government buildings, our businesses,
our communities, and our homes from those who seek to violate them.To examine these
historical elements we will look at them in four categories:
■
Physical obstructions that are used to impede access to facilities or assets
■
Sensors that can warn us of attempts to penetrate our defenses at the perimeter or
can protect high-value assets
■
Guards and other human assets that detect threats, impede access, and respond
■
Command and control facilities that tie together these defensive methods and assist
in the orderly response to speciﬁc threats and attacks
The History of Physical Security
In reviewing the history of physical security, it is apparent that many of the basic principals
regarding safety and risk evaluation have remained consistent throughout the centuries.
History proves that the actual practice of security has evolved constantly to embrace new
technologies while simultaneously improving its communication techniques and manage-
ment strategies to address new threats.The ability to protect against and preempt danger has
been well documented from the days of Chinese Warlord Sun Tzu, up to the present-day
presidential directive HSPD-7, which establishes a national policy for federal departments
and agencies to identify and prioritize America’s critical infrastructure and key resources and
to protect them from terrorist attacks.
Total security is, of course, impossible to guarantee in a free society, or in any society, for
that matter. By integrating age-old security principals with new technologies, we improve
the management functions of command and control, streamline communications and
response to threats (proactive/reactive), and move toward a tighter integration of security
convergence with the discipline of risk management. In so doing, we will improve the ability
to secure global societies through a worldwide collaboration of assessing mutual risk and
establishing countermeasures without disrupting global commerce or abandoning personal
liberties in the process. In order to succeed, we must understand our history, study our

enemies, and envision a future where managing global risk can preempt new and increas-
ingly dangerous threats.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the
result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy,
for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know
neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.—
Sun Tzu, The Art of War, Section III, Number 18
The Four Categories of Physical Security
The earliest days of organized physical security were based on the need to protect villages
from the ravages of hostile bands and states. Sun Tzu, in his famed treatise The Art of War,
captured one of the most basic strategies with the preceding quote. In essence, he outlined
the strategic principle that the defender of a village, or a kingdom, needed to anticipate
enemy forces and how they would be applied, and develop speciﬁc defenses again them.
Clearly, by placing physical obstacles in the way of the attacking force, the defender could
gain some advantage over the enemy.
Although natural obstacles were often used (bodies of water, mountains, dense forests,
etc.), there were very few perfect locations for defense, so many of the man-made obstacles
mimicked the natural ones. Moats, walls, fences, and locks commonly were added to defen-
sive capabilities. But physical obstructions cannot prevent attacks. In some cases, they can be
overwhelmed, and in other cases they only channel the attacker to speciﬁc lines of defense
where adequate measures must be in place that can withstand the force and skill applied by
the attackers. For that reason, security—whether physical or networkcentric—is never static.
It is a game in which the players have an ever-changing set of tools and the only constraints
are time, money, and brainpower.
So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is
weak.—Sun Tzu, The Art of War, Section VI, Number 30
Physical Obstructions
It is an innate characteristic in human beings to want to protect themselves, loved ones, and
property.As far as valuables go, the old adage that you get more conservative when you have
more to lose might apply here as well. Many early castles were constructed in areas that pro-
vided natural barriers to protection, such as cliffs, canyons, water, or other physical impedi-
ments to anyone wanting to access or approach the facility. Structural devices were also
constructed, the most famous being moats build around a castle for the purpose of defense.
Not surprisingly, early castle construction involved wood and progressed to stone sometime
around the twelfth century.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

The earliest known castle in England was built by William Rufus in the 1090s.
According to Wikepedia, the word castle comes from the Latin word castellum, meaning
fortress. Castles were built not only as a defensive measure and offensive weapon, but also as a
home.They were used to store food and detain prisoners.A castle would also be a social
place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.The main distinguishing features of
castles, as opposed to other defensive structures, can be deﬁned as follows:
■
First, castles were places of protection from an invading enemy, a place of retreat.
This is the purpose behind such stereotypical castle features as portcullises, battle-
ments, and drawbridges.
■
Second, castles were offensive weapons, built in otherwise hostile territories from
which to control surrounding lands, as forward camps. In particular, during the
High Middle Ages, castles were often built for territorial expansion and regional
control.A castle was a stronghold from which a lord could control surrounding
territory.
■
Last, castles were either built as, or evolved into, residences for the monarch or lord
who built them.
Synonymous with the medieval castle was the construction of a moat, excavated around
the castle and ﬁlled with water to act as a defensive measure. One reason moats and draw-
bridges were effective was that they could counter the enemy use of large battering rams,
which needed to be placed close to the castle gates. In fact, when considering a castle, we see
multiple levels of the earliest layered defense, or defense in depth strategies, if you will.
Natural protections such as woods and cliffs acted as barriers, while moats provided man-
made defenses, and the actual castle towers and high-platform walkways surrounded the
perimeter. High elevated walkways and small windows provided protected areas from which
to launch offensive attacks against an approaching enemy force.
The earliest castle defenses worked so well that they prompted the invention of tension-
powered catapults by the Romans. However, the deﬁning moment in the era of castle
defense was the arrival of the cannon in the fourteenth century, which followed the inven-
tion of gunpowder in China around 900 AD. Cannons were also used to defend castles;
however, their value was as an offensive weapon was a huge improvement over battering
rams and catapults.
By the end of the Middle Ages, the development of larger, mobile, and more destructive
cannons led to a key role in military campaigns throughout history that continues to this
day.As opposed to a castle, a fortress can be purely defensive (like citadels and city walls),
purely offensive (like a military camp), or entirely residential in nature (like palaces).
Fortiﬁcations have a history of being constructed in times of peace in anticipation of prob-
lems in the future, such as defensive positions in times of war which were constructed on a
much greater scale compared to castles.The Great Wall of China is an example of a man-
made fortiﬁcation constructed between 220 and 200 BC, stretching for more than 4,000
miles between Eastern and Western China.

An interesting point to consider is that as the technology of gunpowder and ﬁrepower
advanced, and the concept of permanent fortiﬁcations around cities and towns remained, the
actual construction of structures was now on ground level rather than on higher elevations,
such as cliffs.As heavy artillery made high walls obsolete, lower and thicker conﬁgurations
and, eventually, underground shelters, replaced them. In addition, to counter the effects of
gunﬁre, multiple defenses were constructed well outside of town, causing an advancing
enemy to start its siege further away, thus increasing the amount of time that a defender had
to prepare and channel his defensive measures.
The trend toward underground fortiﬁcations was advanced during the U.S. Civil War in
the 1860s in the defense of vital areas and resources.This concept was known as trench warfare
and was the result of advances in ﬁrepower technology without similar advances in the
mobility and communications capabilities of armies.Trenches were deployed en masse in
World War I in the form of ﬁeld fortiﬁcations.These trenches were elaborate shelters and
included support capabilities for frontline troops, including medical treatment for the
wounded.The physical defense of the trenches was protected by layered deployments of
barbed wire, otherwise known as Devil’s Rope and patented by Joseph F. Glidden of DeKalb,
Illinois, in 1874.The horror of trench warfare was symbolized by the western front in World
War I.Trenches were dug into interlocking defensive grids and the area between the
opposing forces’ trenches was known as no man’s land.Another vital requirement the trenches
served was in the area of communications, where “runners” relayed orders from command
positions in the rear to frontline troops.
The basic need for shelter and protection is the basis for defensive physical barriers
against threats.These protections are constantly advancing, along with offensive weapons sys-
tems to obsolete those state-of-the-art protections.At some point in history, offensive capa-
bilities outpaced defensive strategies and created a mindset whereby research and
development of new offensive weapons capabilities gained precedence.
Today, it can be argued that the hacker community is one step ahead of the defensive
capabilities of corporations to stop those activities by better leveraging new technologies to
their gain. One example is the issues that IT departments are experiencing today as they
attempt to secure wireless handheld devices from cyber attacks.The history of securing a
defensive position, whether a castle, a trench, a beach, or a country, has an equalizing coun-
terstrategy in the form of newly devised offensive weapons and strategies to balance any
timely advantage of one side over the other.As military technology advanced quickly at the
beginning of the twentieth century and spanned two world wars, these physical security
practices, such as barbed wire and fencing, found their way into industrial security applica-
tions. However, there was a delayed deployment time between the offensive capabilities that
technology produced and the defensive ability to react to it. One example is the advance-
ment in the mechanization of armies in the form of tanks and troops carriers.The mobility
of the ﬁghting force was ahead of the capabilities of the defensive fortiﬁcations being
erected. In the years leading up to World War II, the European powers were inexplicably
constructing permanent defensive fortiﬁcations in preparation for a decidedly mobile state of

warfare.This inﬂexibility in thinking led to the failure of the Maginot Line in the defense of
France (see Figure 2.2).
Figure 2.2 The Maginot Line
The Challenges of Convergence…
The Maginot Line: Ineffective Protection
The Maginot Line was a hugely expensive 200-mile system of concrete fortiﬁ-
cations, tank obstacles, machine gun posts, and other defenses which France
constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy, and named after
Minister of Defense André Maginot. It was built after World War I and in
preparation for World War II. The French stubbornly ignored the technical
advancements made regarding troop mobility and tank warfare. Instead, they
opted to build the line, relying on the earlier defensive tactics that proved suc-
cessful in World War I. 
The line was an underground and air-conditioned fortress complete with
rotating machine gun turrets. Although comfortable, the fortiﬁcation system
utterly failed to contain the German invasion of 1940 when the Nazis
deployed a decoy force across from the Line while a second group cut through

Belgium and the Netherlands, north of the main French defenses. The
Germans simply did an end run around the Maginot Line, avoiding a direct
assault. German forces were well into France within ﬁve days and they con-
tinued to advance until June 14, 1940, the day Paris fell. 
The Maginot Line is associated with one of history’s great security mis-
calculations. It is a case study in limited thinking and lack of innovation when
the stakes of failure could not have been higher. France failed to recognize the
technological advancement of mechanized warfare in large part because the
construction of the Maginot Line was well underway and changing focus
would have been regarded as a lack of leadership. Instead, the fall of Paris
only proved the point and the Maginot Line has gone into history books as a
magniﬁcent failure. 
Like many measures in use today in both the IT and physical security
worlds, one line of defense cannot provide all of the protection needed. The
ﬁrewall is necessary, but insufﬁcient. Coordinated and ﬂexible layers of
defense resulting from detailed and continuous risk assessment are required.
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not
expected.—Sun Tzu, The Art of War, Section I, Number 24
The basic principal behind the Maginot Line was sound: to protect the perimeter and
provide advanced warning and coordinated response to an impending attack.The obvious
problem was one of limited mobility and ﬂexibility in responding.
What has been consistent through the centuries is the use of physical barriers as a ﬁrst
line of security defense.The Berlin Wall was a well-known icon of the Cold War erected in
1961 and famously destroyed in November 1989 by sledgehammer-wielding Germans in
West Berlin. It stood for 28 years as a visible reminder to the world of the divisions that
existed between Democratic and Communist ideologies.Another prominent example of a
physical barrier providing an early warning system is the 38th Parallel, which runs inside the
demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea.The 151-mile-long DMZ has
separated the two Koreas since 1953 and is the most heavily fortiﬁed border in the world. It
resulted from an uneasy conclusion to the Korean conﬂict, which never ofﬁcially ended with
a peace treaty. Former President Bill Clinton has referred to the 38th Parallel as “the scariest
place on Earth.”
Another ongoing political and social conﬂict has resulted in the recent construction of a
border fence in the West Bank.The 451-mile security barrier separating Israelis and
Palestinians has been a highly effective deterrent for potential suicide bombers. From 2000 to
2003, approximately 300 Israelis were killed and 2,000 wounded as a result of terrorist
bombings.According to Israeli intelligence estimates, 75 percent of the suicide bombers who
attacked targets inside Israel came from across the border where the ﬁrst phase of the fence
was built. Since construction of the fence began, the number of attacks has declined by more
than 90 percent and the number of Israelis murdered and wounded has decreased by more

than 70 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Even the Palestinian terrorists have admitted the
fence is a deterrent.This proves to be an excellent example of the stellar reputation of Israeli
technical advances applied to the area of physical security convergence.
The Challenges of Convergence…
SBINet: The Department of 
Homeland Security Embraces Convergence
As we have seen, fences and fortiﬁed defenses have a long history in the area
of physical security, which continues today. The success of the Israeli efforts to
control violence in the West Bank may have inﬂuenced U.S. lawmakers in the
recent passage of a bill to erect a security barrier along the northern and
southern borders of the United States. 
The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) is the most comprehensive plan in our
nation’s history to control our borders. As part of the program, SBINet is a $2.5
billion integration effort to secure U.S. border crossings and signiﬁcantly
reduce illegal immigration. The program is one of the largest and most impor-
tant Homeland Security projects to date and involves a strategy of integrating
physical security guarding with increased investments in new detection tech-
nology and infrastructure. It will also provide enhanced communications to
coordinate activities on federal, state, local, and international levels. The tech-
nology plan will integrate cameras, sensors, and other devices and will be
deployed along 6,000 miles of northern and southern land borders, including
the Great Lakes, to assist Customs and Border Patrol ofﬁcials in preventing
unauthorized entry. The successful deployment of SBINet will highlight inno-
vative technologies and prove to be a twenty-ﬁrst century security conver-
gence benchmark.
At the end of 2006, the Boeing Corporation was selected to manage the
SBINet contract with a team of high-technology partners. The company’s pro-
posal included plans to erect a network of 1,800 towers equipped with sen-
sors, cameras, and heat and motion detectors along both the northern and
southern borders within three years. To complement the technology deploy-
ment the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to have more than
18,300 Border Patrol agents hired by the end of 2008. The Boeing-led SBINet
team is a compilation of various companies reﬂecting the convergence of
innovative information technologies with integration skills to augment the
enforcement capabilities of physical security border guards. This combination
will leverage traditional resources and maximize performance capabilities. The
program team includes the following major contractors:

The combined expertise of the companies comprising the Boeing team
underscores the new age of security integrators and the underlying evolution
of the security industry. These technologies involve companies of various sizes
and skill sets, which are deploying security solutions across the latest IT plat-
forms to enhance physical security capabilities. The latest examples of these
leading-edge systems run the gamut from mobile surveillance towers that
assist border agents with communications along 2,000 miles of the southern
border, to global positioning systems (GPSes) on handheld devices with ﬁn-
gerprint technology linked to criminal databases. 
The traditional role of security is at the core of the SBI program. There is
nothing more fundamental than the process of protecting and securing a
national border against a physical breech by adversaries. As global threats
advance and offensive capabilities continue to outpace defensive protections,
technology is converging to provide mobile and ﬂexible capabilities to close
the security gap. The Boeing SBINet team will develop technical interoper-
ability in product sets to provide information, surveillance, and networking to
the DHS. The goal of the project is to deploy state-of-the-art systems to detect,
identify, classify, and respond to threats along the borders of the United
States.
Security Sensors: The 
Evolution of Surveillance Techniques
Today, as the SBINet project clearly shows, the intersection of advanced technology with tra-
ditional physical security is providing a leap forward in productivity and operational scale.
Although one can argue that today’s technical innovations are arriving at a faster pace and
www.syngress.com

are providing more cross-functionality than they have at any time in history, it is also impor-
tant to realize that we are experiencing the natural evolution of security convergence.
The Burglar Alarm
Certainly, the arrival of the Electronic Age universally impacted the future of business in the
United States, and the physical security business saw a tremendous leap forward, thanks in
large part to one man. It is hard to believe that the burglar alarm has been around for more
than 150 years in the United States. It has seen many signiﬁcant advances in that time, and it
all started with Edwin T. Holmes, of Boston. He is credited with inventing the burglar alarm.
Although further research indicates that he may have purchased the patent from Augustas
Pope, it is fair to say that Holmes was the entrepreneur behind the idea that got it off the
ground and the gentleman responsible for its commercial success.
In 1852, Holmes was promoting the concept of electrical security at the same time that
Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were making history. He took his business to
New York City and started going door to door in search of wealthy clients interested in how
security could complement this new “electricity” technology. One innovation Holmes pro-
vided was a direct hookup between a home jewelry safe and the local police.This was the
pioneering application of the security central station concept. He promoted the product in
the local newspapers and eventually landed large clients such as Tiffany & Company and
Lord & Taylor. By 1872, his business, Holmes Electric Protective, was booming and moving
into the ﬁrst central station on Broadway.An interesting sidebar is that Edwin Holmes later
became the ﬁrst president of New York’s Bell Telephone Company.
More than 150 years have passed since the ﬁrst electronic burglar alarm was introduced,
and today commercial and home security systems are commodity security products.Today’s
security systems also integrate with infrared motion, ﬁre, and chemical detection sensors.
Increasingly, as bandwidth speeds accelerate and IP video extends from the commercial to
the consumer markets, these IP video security systems will become standard product offer-
ings.The integration of a variety of sensor technologies with audio, video, and data transmis-
sion over IP land or wireless networks will provide new capabilities and extend the
performance of future surveillance instruments to unimaginable levels. New competition
from IT vendors is encroaching upon traditional physical security markets.Technology is
quickly replacing the guard/soldier standing at the point with sensor systems to alert him or
her to danger while taking them directly out of harm’s way.
A sensor is deﬁned as any device that receives a signal or stimulus (as heat or pressure
or light or motion, etc.) and responds to it in a distinctive manner. Because the element of
surprise is a huge advantage in military and clandestine maneuvers, the need for sensor
devices to assist in everything from night vision capabilities to the detection of sound and
smell is critical.Again, we see where technology advances had a profound impact on the
state of surveillance. Seventeenth century telescopes dated back to before Galileo and it
appears that ﬁeld binoculars were in selected use during the Civil War.This certainly
improved the ability to search out adversaries during optimal conditions. However, it was not

until World War I that the use of electronic listening devices provided a quantum leap in
range and capability to hear verbal conversations and troop movements, and provide early
warnings for approaching aircraft along with sonar capabilities for underwater detection.
These advancements in sensor and surveillance capabilities continued through the
decades of the 1920s and1930s and provided advanced warfare capabilities during World War
II. One huge advantage was evident in the capability of new technology to both provide
communications for military operations and intercept enemy communications.These com-
puting devices are now driving whole new families of sensing, processing, and reporting sys-
tems for application in surveillance and security.
Codes and Ciphers
The breaking of the German Enigma by the Polish, British, and American cryptanalysts
during World War II gave tremendous advantages to Allied forces in the battles for North
Africa, the Northern Atlantic (breaking the back of the German U-Boat Wolf Packs), and
Europe.The German Enigma machine was originally developed by Arthur Scherbius in 1918
as a commercial device for the protection of ﬁnancial information being sent over telegraph
systems. In fact, it is this offensive/defensive balance between how well technologies are used
that often determines the outcome.At the same time that Allied cryptanalysts were being
successful in breaking into German and Japanese codes and ciphers, the Allied cryptologists
were continually improving their own codes and ciphers in order to protect their forces and
their intelligence advantage as well. Leading up to the World War II, there was no shortage
of innovation across a wide range of ﬁelds, as detailed earlier. Many advances found their way
into military practice but also provided dual-use capabilities for the betterment of society, as
was the case with ﬁeld binoculars leading to eventual breakthroughs in modern-day optics
technology.Additionally, many of the advances of code-breaking cryptologists continue as
the products deployed to counter cyber crimes today.
Electronics Devices
Digital electronics in particular had been given a large boost by war-related research and
development in preparation for the World War II.The research not only provided early com-
munications breakthroughs, but also established the foundation for the early work of com-
puter systems paving the way for the post-war development of stored program computing
devices of all types.These computing devices are now driving whole new families of sensing,
processing, and reporting systems for application in surveillance and security.The United
Kingdom and the United States proved to be excellent partners teaming as early leaders in
electronics. One example is the U.S. center for basic radar development at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (Lincoln Labs), which continues to enjoy a worldwide reputation
today as a leading research institution.
Since World War II, encryption has advanced considerably as development of informa-
tion systems and IP networks overwhelmed the traditional means of communication.Today
nearly every communication device has some form of security embedded into its architec-

ture. Unfortunately, these security systems are often more complicated than effective, much
like the original Enigma, and as a result, we are still living with enormous vulnerabilities in
our information systems. By extension, as we move more and more of our physical security
assets and sensors to the network, we will be introducing new vulnerabilities that must be
addressed.
One of the lessons of history is that neither complexity nor obscurity
provides very much real security.
Sensor Technologies
With advances in electronics, the range of surveillance technologies advanced to include
land-, sea-, and air- (including space-) based systems to observe events and provide accurate
and timely intelligence in support of decision making. Sensor technologies continue to
improve and broaden considerably as a result of decreasing form factors and increased pro-
cessing capabilities and our ability to network their capabilities.Today sensor technologies are
critical solutions in multiple industries including medical diagnostics, industrial manufac-
turing, defense, and homeland security.The whole ﬁeld of remote sensing has developed out
of an interest in making measurements of Earth’s surface from airborne, or space-based,
observing platforms.
There is little doubt about the role of technology in extending the military capabilities
of the United States and our allies, but these technologies are increasingly available on a
global basis at quite affordable prices to our adversaries as well. What is important, then, is
our ability to anticipate the potential use of technologies by our enemies and to develop,
sometimes using the same or similar technologies, the ability to defend ourselves against their
use. We have come to know that the Internet is a tremendously important tool for building
and sharing information and knowledge, but it is also a tool that can be (and has been) used
by terrorists to recruit their forces, plan their operations, train operatives, and coordinate the
execution of their attacks. In the future, they may even use the Internet as a ﬁeld of battle by
attacking ﬁnancial systems or other critical parts of our infrastructure. Developing defenses
against these vulnerabilities is an important activity for government and industry to pursue
together.

ceilings, as well as in handheld wireless conﬁgurations. Its patented technology allows the
product to actually “see” through walls, roadbeds, and obstacles to detect both motion and
breathing.The sensors can also discriminate between vehicle types, people, and animals to
reduce false alarms.They are weatherproof, tamperproof, and impervious to any weather or
lighting conditions as well as undetectable by intruders.
Based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, the products emit signals which provide
deﬁning information about a target and are designed for both custom environments and
integration into existing CCTV, access control, intrusion, or building management systems.
UltraVision products have been recognized by the physical security industry with awards for
their ingenuity.These products represent the convergence of IT and physical security to
improve upon the historic need for observation and surveillance, and to elevate that capa-
bility to new levels. Industry will continue to address new security requirements and expand
those solutions in tandem with the deployment of new communication technologies. By
expanding and integrating technologies to detect intruders, both physical and electronic, the
next generation of security solutions is quickly moving to close the gaps in traditional secu-
rity defenses and address new global risks simultaneously.
You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack
places which are undefended.—Sun Tzu, The Art of War, Section VI,
Number 7
Sensor Webs
The next steps in sensor technology will continue to leverage the global communications
network as a platform for “Sensor Webs”.As evidence, Wikipedia deﬁnes the Sensor Web as
a type of sensor network or geographic information system (GIS) that is especially well
suited for environmental monitoring and control. In 1997, Kevin Delin of NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory used the term to describe a speciﬁc type of sensor network: an amor-
phous network of spatially distributed sensor platforms (pods) that wirelessly communicate
with each other.
This amorphous architecture is unique because it is both synchronous and router-free,
making it distinct from the more typical Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP)-like network schemes.The architecture allows every pod to know what is going
on with every other pod throughout the Sensor Web at each measurement cycle. Note that a
Sensor Web pod is merely a physical platform for a sensor and thus can be orbital or terres-
trial, ﬁxed or mobile, and might even have real-time accessibility via the Internet. Pod-to-
pod communication is both omni-directional and bi-directional, where each pod sends out
collected data to every other pod in the network.As a result, on-the-ﬂy data fusion, such as
false positive identiﬁcation and plume tracking, can occur within the Sensor Web itself and
the system subsequently reacts as a coordinated, collective whole to the incoming data
stream.

Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

Today, there have been a variety of Sensor Web ﬁeld deployments with systems spanning
as many as 6 miles and running continuously for more than three years. By design, the
Sensor Web spreads collected data and processed information throughout the entire network.
As a result, there is no design criterion for routing, as is the case in more typical wireless sys-
tems, because routing, by deﬁnition, is a focused moving of information from one point to
another.The Sensor Web is a distributed network, meaning that all the intelligence and data
gathered by one pod is shared and used by the other pods. Different applications require dif-
ferent details, such as what data is collected and how frequently that data is recorded and
shared with other pods.The software is loaded onto each pod before deployment, along with
each pod’s unique ID number, but the wireless capabilities of each pod mean that the net-
work can be updated and changed after the pods have been deployed.The goal is to provide
a pervasive, continuous, embedded monitoring presence in a range of environments and over
large spatial areas.
Smart Dust
Another similar concept, called Smart Dust, was launched by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1997 and led by Kris Pister, electrical engineering
professor at UC Berkeley.The goal of Smart Dust is to produce microelectromechanical sys-
tems, or MEMS, that can be part sensor and part network device and can connect to hun-
dreds or thousands of similar devices in a distributed network.The “motes” or individual
sensors could be made to detect just about anything, from radiation to people.They are
based on a standard CPU, an operating system called TinyOS, RAM, and a radio for net-
working.The networking concept is fully meshed and self-healing, which allows for sensors
to come into the network and leave in an almost unnoticed fashion.The sensor would be
interfaced with various ﬁltering mechanisms to extract knowledge from the sensed phe-
nomena so as to reduce the amount of information that has to be shared across the network.
In March 2001, the basic concepts for useful deployment of motes were demonstrated at
the Marine Corps Air/Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), in Twenty Nine Palms,
California, using a 5-foot wingspan GPS-controlled model aircraft.Although rudimentary, the
test showed that the concept was viable, but that a lot of work needed to be done in terms of
shrinking the size and battery consumption of the devices. In 2005, Dust, Inc. conducted a
test for the military that deployed eight sensors with motion detectors and locational capabili-
ties from an airplane that successfully detected and reported on the movements of armored
vehicles, including their direction, speed, and size.The developers of Smart Dust seem to have
solved some of the hardest problems facing such sensor networks, including self-organizing
networks, nano-sensors, and ﬁltering and sharing of information sensed by the devices.We
can be sure that within the decade, affordable systems will appear for securing the battleﬁeld
and the homeland in collecting information for actionable intelligence.

The Challenges of Convergence…
Abu Ghraib Prison: A Lesson in 
Security Convergence Management 
Abu Ghraib is an Iraqi city near the capital of Baghdad with a long history and
international reputation as a site where Saddam Hussein’s government tor-
tured and executed dissidents. In 2004, during the U.S. military campaign in
Iraq, the prison also became famous for a scandal involving the abuse and tor-
ture of prisoners at the hands of U.S. Army personnel (372nd Military Police
Company), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and outside military con-
tractors from CACI International.
The origins of the scandal began with a series of photographs, taken
from digital cameras and cell phones and distributed worldwide over IP net-
works. These photos—initially sent to family and friends—eventually reached
news media outlets and were published worldwide, totally catching the U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD), the White House, the CIA, and associated con-
tractors off guard. Photos showing a prisoner standing on a box and con-
nected to wires he believes are attached to explosives that will kill him, and
showing a pyramid of naked Iraqi captives along with a smiling U.S. Army
female guard, provided visual evidence that shocked the international com-
munity and produced universal condemnation of the United States. 
The fact is that the actions of a few guards and contractors were magni-
ﬁed by IP-enabled digital technology and these embarrassing photos were
worldwide in real time before the military had a chance to investigate. The
lesson here for military leaders and civilian management alike is that new
wireless digital technologies can be a problem in the hands of a few bad sol-
diers or employees. In order to preempt these types of situations, risk assess-
ments must be conducted, at least on an informal basis, to realize what
ramiﬁcations a given technology can have in a given situation. Instantaneous
access and visual evidence is a double-edged sword, as this example indicates. 
The military is not alone here, as several controversial videos have
involved law enforcement, such as the now famous Rodney King affair. That
same video technology has captured the actions of countless criminals as well,
and exonerated many an innocent police ofﬁcer from bogus charges as a
result of an arrest. The key is management and being in front of a potentially
embarrassing situation. It is no surprise that an occasional soldier, police
ofﬁcer, or employee will conduct himself or herself dishonorably. This is part
of the human condition. Good leadership and management learn from exam-
ples, good and bad, and prepare for potential risk scenarios that new tech-

nologies can present. The introduction of digital technology and the global IP
network in the forms of voice, video, and data intelligence has fundamentally
altered the nature of surveillance and data gathering as it applies to warfare,
as well as the traditional security industry. Additionally, the convergence of
these new communication technologies (wired speed and wireless mobility),
along with distributed software solution capabilities, can supersede an estab-
lished command and control structure without the appropriate deployment of
preventive countermeasures and basic education. 
The merging of innovative and universally accepted standard technolo-
gies with the traditional activities of intelligence gathering and physical secu-
rity practices, many which date back to the origins of recorded history, are
producing a state of “convergence confusion.” It is a situation as demon-
strated in the Abu Ghraib example, where technology is mobile and in the
hands of soldiers and citizens without the knowledge or understanding of the
command authority regarding the impact of its use and potential risk to
overall operations. Or again, the technology (perhaps in this case uninten-
tionally) is deployed ﬁrst and acts in an offensive manner to create havoc prior
to the installation of defensive measures to mitigate future risk. 
Abu Ghraib is one example of what to expect in the era of accelerated
security convergence. This dynamic must be clearly understood, communi-
cated, and integrated into security policy across global operations whether
military, industrial, or government. If not, technology will proceed unabated
by management control and will not be leveraged productively, but rather will
prove detrimental, embarrassing, and potentially very dangerous. Good lead-
ership learns from examples to leverage the positive aspects of technology and
mitigate the negative consequences of its deployment.

The use of spies
The United States has deployed spies since the Revolutionary War, when General George

letter written July 26, 1777, Washington wrote “The necessity of procuring good intelligence
is apparent and need not be further urged, all that remains for me to add is, that you keep
the whole matter as secret as possible.”
In reviewing the Civil War, it is evident from the beginning that President Abraham
Lincoln had limited information about the South’s war-making capabilities and battle plans.

To gather intelligence, Lincoln created two separate intelligence operations. One was headed
by the famous detective,Allan Pinkerton, of Chicago, who reported to General George
McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac. Lafayette Baker, who reported to
General Winﬁeld Scott, ran the other.These organizations often worked at cross-purposes
and most likely created the basis of what would become the tradition of “intelligence agency
rivalries,” which continues to the present day.
In 1885, President Grover Cleveland initiated the assignment of military attachés to for-
eign countries to gather information. During the Spanish-American War of 1898, the
United States acquired—and most important, acted upon—human intelligence about Spain’s
war-making capabilities. In the lead up to World War I, government agents successfully
arrested German agents and saboteurs within the United States. During the conﬂict, the
United States established operational ties for intelligence gathering and sharing with the
British government.
There are many different types of intelligence involving political, economic, military, and
strategic activities of all sorts.The variety of these activities has only gotten more complex
with the introduction of the technology timeline. Since the advent of electricity and the
Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century, the ability of surveillance capabilities and
intelligence gathering has never stopped, and today seems to be moving faster than ever.The
use of covert sources, such as spies and intercepted communications, has always been valuable
in order to understand what an adversary was thinking. New technologies in photographic
reconnaissance, starting with early cameras and extending to satellites orbiting Earth, have all
proved valuable in part or in whole to provide value to intelligence gathering.
Countersurveillance is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difﬁ-
cult. Before computer networks, countersurveillance involved avoiding agents and communi-
cating secretly. With recent developments—the Internet, the increasing prevalence of
electronic security systems, and computer databases—countersurveillance has grown in scope
and complexity.A major shift came after 1945, when wire and tape recorders became avail-
able and were used in surveillance recordings.As with all technologies, the early products
were large, bulky, and expensive, and it was not until the basic technology had a chance to
mature and incorporate other technical advances that subsequent models were produced and
its use as a surveillance device for voice recording became most effective.
It was not until the introduction of the transistor recorder in the early 1950s that secret
recording became more common. Shortly after this development, small, concealable tape
recorders appeared.The Minifon, a West German product, was the best known of these small
recording devices.As Cold War paranoia grew, so too did the making of these secret record-
ings.Today the video surveillance market is following the audio recording industry’s history
of miniaturized electronics and clandestine operations. Digital video cameras are now small
enough to ﬁt into a fountain pen or a tie tack.

The Challenges of Convergence…
Covert Surveillance and 
Intelligence Gathering: Spies “R” Us
In Sun Tzu’s famous book, The Art of War (c. 500 BC), he emphasizes the need
for spies from the local populace, the enemy’s ofﬁcials, double agents, and
agents who managed to escape from an enemy encampment. According to
Kenneth Macksey’s excellent work, The Penguin Encyclopedia of Weapons and
Military Technology, “Since the ﬁrst authenticated Sumerian handwriting,
dating from c. 3100 BC, a quantity of verbal, written, and encoded intelligence
has been gathered. The sources and form of reports available to political and
military leaders changed very little for many centuries: but the quantity and
speed of dissemination increased with the gradual speed of literacy, with
better charts and maps and signal communications systems, which were linked
to the conquest of the oceans, exploration, and the opening up of land
routes.” 
Webster’s dictionary traces the origins of the word surveillance; Etymology:
French, from surveiller, to watch over, from sur- + veiller to watch, from Old
French veillier, from Latin vigilare, from vigil watchful — more at VIGIL: close
watch kept over someone or something (as by a detective); also: SUPERVISION.
In French, surveillance literally means “watching over,” and is often used for all
forms of observation or monitoring, not just visual observation.
Today the video security camera is an icon of surveillance, because in
many modern cities and buildings, closed-circuit television cameras are clearly
visible. The word surveillance is commonly used to describe observation from
a distance by means of electronic equipment or other technological means.
Again, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, written 2,500 years ago, discusses how spies
should be used against a person’s enemies. But modern electronics and com-
puter technology have given surveillance a whole new ﬁeld of operation. The
introduction of wireless digital video capabilities and the World Wide Web as
a communications vehicle has greatly increased the range and use of surveil-
lance technologies. The history of spying and intelligence gathering is rich and
probably the world’s second oldest profession. In fact, the International Spy
Museum opened in 2002 in Washington D.C. and provides more than 20,000
square feet of exhibits and 600 artifacts detailing the history of espionage.

The History of U.S. Intelligence
World War I began the modern era of code breaking and intelligence gathering. Major
Ralph Van Deman, the “father of American intelligence,” created the Military Intelligence
Section in the Army General Staff, and a Cipher Bureau (MI-8) within this section.
However, it was World War II that provided a signiﬁcant and visible victory for military
intelligence agencies and laid the groundwork for what eventually became the CIA and the
National Security Agency (NSA).
On December 7, 1941, Japanese military forces attacked the U.S. naval ﬂeet anchored at
Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.The surprise attack nearly devastated the U.S.
Paciﬁc ﬂeet, destroying nearly 350 U.S. warplanes. More than 2,400 U.S. servicemen were
killed and nearly 1,200 were wounded that morning.After the attack, U.S. intelligence
efforts focused on cracking Japan’s code for transmitting military messages. In fact, this effort
included the use of IBM punch-card tabulating machines, the ﬁrst example of successful
cooperation between military and private enterprises to gather intelligence.The unit was
able to crack the code and subsequently intercepted and decoded thousands of Japanese
communications to turn the tide in the war in the Paciﬁc in favor of the United States.
One larger-than-life personality deﬁning the early history of U.S. intelligence agencies
was William “Wild Bill” Donovan.Although Donovan was a successful lawyer, and would
later become assistant attorney general during the Hoover administration, he enlisted in the
army just before the United States entered World War I. He would distinguish himself
through two world wars as the only American to have received our nation’s four highest
awards:The Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service
Medal, and the National Security Medal.
During World War II, President Roosevelt appointed Donovan to create an intelligence
service, and the Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (OSS) began in June 1942. Under Donovan’s
leadership, the OSS collected and analyzed information needed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
to conduct clandestine operations that were not carried out by other federal agencies or the
military.After the war, the agency became a civilian organization that would coordinate
global intelligence gathering and execute operations under the banner of the CIA.A
Hollywood movie, The Good Shepherd, depicts the early days of the OSS (the precursor to
the CIA) and its recruiting tactics on our nation’s most prestigious universities. It tracks the
life of Edward Wilson as he develops over the decades into one of the agency’s veteran oper-
atives, and reviews the long Cold War battle with the Soviet Union. It is a history lesson in
the development of the culture and operations of the CIA.
The NSA is the U.S. intelligence agency within the DoD that is responsible for crypto-
graphic security and signals intelligence.The NSA grew out of the communications intelli-
gence activities of U.S. military units during World War II.The origins of the NSA can be
traced to an organization originally established within the DoD, under the command of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff as the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), on May 20, 1949.The
creation of the NSA was authorized in a letter written by President Harry S.Truman in June
1952 (although the letter was classiﬁed and remained unknown to the public for more than

a generation).The NSA, although not a creation of Congress, is still subject to congressional
review; even though it is one of the most secret of all U.S. intelligence agencies. Its director
is a military ofﬁcer of ﬂag rank—in other words, a general or admiral.
Wikipedia deﬁnes the NSA mission as including the protection and formulation of
codes, ciphers, and other cryptology as well as the interception, analysis, and solution of
coded transmissions.The NSA conducts research into all forms of electronic transmission and
operates listening posts around the world for the interception of signals.Though its budget
and the number of its employees are secret, the NSA is acknowledged to be far larger than
the CIA, possessing ﬁnancial resources that rival those of the world’s largest companies.
Despite having been described as the world’s largest single employer of mathematicians and
the owner of the world’s largest single group of supercomputers, its secure work has involved
the NSA in numerous technology areas including the design of specialized communications
hardware and software, the production of dedicated semiconductors (there is a chip fabrica-
tion plant at Fort Meade), and advanced cryptography research.
The NSA contracts with the private sector in the ﬁelds of research and development of
both security and analytic technologies. In the past decade, the NSA has spent a great deal of
its budget on the improvement of security technologies in use by the DoD. Programs to
develop better authentication and identity management, cryptographic modernization to
increase the strength of encryption devices, network security devices such as ﬁrewalls and
guards, biometrics, key management systems, and software assurance are but some of the
areas that the NSA has emphasized. In the intelligence arena, the NSA has emphasized the
development of analytical tools, automated language translation, knowledge management,
database technologies, and reporting tools.The basic difference between the NSA and the
CIA is that the NSA listens for information electronically and by code breaking, whereas the
CIA gathers information and conducts covert operations.
Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm activity, or to
assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by ﬁnding
out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-
keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be
commissioned to ascertain these.”—Sun Tzu, The Art of War
One of the most celebrated stories of code breaking that was released after WWII was
that the U.S. had successfully broken the Japanese Diplomatic Code, nicknamed Purple (the
information derived from decrypts was nicknamed Magic). Just prior to the Japanese surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese Foreign Ofﬁce sent a 14-part message to the Japanese
ambassador in Washington, DC that was broken and read by U.S. cryptographers. It was
widely believed that this message announced the attack and that because it was delivered late
to the U.S. military in Hawaii, the attack could have been better deterred. In fact, the mes-
sage announced that Japan was ending diplomatic relations with the United States and did
not contain any speciﬁc threats or deadlines. Ironically, it was the success in breaking the
Japanese Diplomatic Code that may have led to the successful planning and execution of the
Allied invasion of Europe on June 6, 1944.

The Japanese ambassador to Germany during World War II was General Hiroshi
Oshima, who, being a military man, developed close ties to the German military and to its
intelligence authorities, particularly Heinrich Himmler, head of the German SS. In
November 1943, when Tokyo’s military leaders expressed some concern over Allied prepara-
tions for an invasion of Europe, Oshima approached Himmler with a request to visit the
coastal area opposite the United Kingdom and to inspect the war preparations there by
German soldiers. His visit was arranged and the site turned out to be one of the several
beach areas in Northern France that could be used for an amphibious assault: the beaches of
Normandy. Upon completing his rather extensive tour (some of which was ﬁlmed by the
Germans and shown in a 1999 documentary on the Discovery Channel), Oshima dutifully
reported his tour of military facilities, shore batteries, barricades, and ammunition dumps,
and even reported on the strength of various divisions and reserve units in the area.The
message was very detailed and extensive and when U.S. cryptographers read the message, it
was an obvious treasure-trove of information on Nazi war preparations.
Thus, by breaking the Japanese Diplomatic Code, the Allies not only had access to the
details of German preparations for the invasion, but also had the opportunity to shape the
coming battle. General Eisenhower now had seven months to prepare his surprise. Because
he possessed such details of the Normandy area, he could avoid concentrating his reconnais-
sance in that area, create the feigned attack on Pas-de-Calais, and set up the phantom army
under General George Patton that would keep the Germans occupied with planning for the
assault and concentrating their forces opposite the Straits of Dover.
Although this was a magniﬁcent intelligence and deception coup, it was also an extraor-
dinary example of how keeping their knowledge of German defenses and their planned
target of the assault at Normandy was equally key to Allied success.Adding to this complex
set of successes was the fact that days before the invasion, Oshima sent a conﬁrmatory mes-
sage to Tokyo using the Purple code machine, stating that the Germans were well prepared
to repel the coming invasion at Pas-de-Calais.
Guards: The Pioneers of Security Surveillance
Our best guess is that the earliest example of a security guard was the caveman hovering
over an animal carcass until he had time to ﬁnish his meal. Of course, history is replete with
examples of security guarding and its evolution to the current day, as it touches all the fun-
damental issues and applications involved with the practice of security. From the innate need
to secure oneself from danger and the development of fortiﬁcations to ensure safety and pro-
tection for people from enemies and the elements, to the evolution of technologies and
weapons to advance security and surveillance techniques, to the latest innovations in identity
management and IT systems, the basic need for security has endured the ages.The fact that
physical security requirements have never gone away, and will never go away, is as certain as
the historical connection to warfare and weapons systems.
When we research the topic of security guarding, we inevitably land on the description
of security guard offered by Wikipedia:
www.syngress.com

Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

A Security Guard or Security Ofﬁcer is usually a privately and for-
mally employed person who is paid to protect property, and/or
assets, and/or people. Often, security ofﬁcers are uniformed and act
to protect property by maintaining a high visibility presence to deter
illegal and/or inappropriate actions, observing (either directly,
through patrols, or by watching alarm systems or video cameras) for
signs of crime, ﬁre or disorder; then taking action and/or reporting
any incidents to their client, employer and emergency services as
appropriate.
Great, we can all visualize the image of a guard sleeping in front of a bank of video
cameras or in a guard shack.The industry has a rather poor reputation for quality.This is not
fair to the hard-working professionals who perform admirably everyday, but it is a fact
nonetheless, and one that has some merit. However, for a moment, let’s review the history of
security guarding and how it impacts the physical security industry.
By all accounts, the revenue generated by security guard contracts amounts to between
35 percent and 50 percent of total industry revenues.These are huge numbers, and security
convergence is having a direct impact on the physical security guard profession.The intro-
duction of high technology will ﬁx a number of problems, and the actual performance of
guarding services will drastically improve.At the same time, the number of security guards
will be substantially reduced.The end result will be a more professional industry image and
higher-paid security ofﬁcers who are better skilled in technology and emergency services.
Security guard companies will have fewer employees and more technology to offer industry.
Tenure will improve and certain security guard companies will be recruiting centers for pro-
fessional law enforcement and contract military security outsource companies. Smart security
ﬁrms will offer continued education and responsibilities to grow with the business, as the
security guarding industry will see double-digit growth throughout the next decade.
All of these changes, brought about by the global adoption of standard communication
networks and technology platforms, will produce a security guard business unrecognizable in
the near future. Robocop is not far off, and the skill sets required to execute that emergency
responder model are being honed on the battleﬁelds of Iraq and Afghanistan today.The
commercial security organization of the future will offer an option outside of career military
service or law enforcement.The ﬁelds of Enterprise Security Management (ESM) and
Global Risk Management will offer career advancement and speciﬁc degree paths toward
executive-level responsibilities.The function of a physical security presence will never go
away, but it will be signiﬁcantly upgraded, and that’s a positive outcome for government,
industrial, and personal security, as well as society as a whole. More tactical and strategic uti-
lization of technology will result in collaboration and improved security management pro-
cesses to proactively prevent both physical and electronic security breaches.

The Roman Vigiles
According to Answers.com, the Vigiles or, more properly, the Vigiles Urbani (“watchmen of
the city”) or Cohortes Vigilum (“cohorts of the watchmen”), were the ﬁreﬁghters and
police of ancient Rome. Fire had always been a problem in Rome, and during the years of
the Republic, a small force of ﬁreﬁghters had been established in the city. During the early
part of his reign, Caesar Augustus (the ﬁrst Emperor) expanded the force greatly.The Vigiles
were soldiers assigned to guard the city of Rome, often credited as the origin of both secu-
rity personnel and police, although their principal duty was as a ﬁre brigade.
There have been “night watchmen” since at least the Middle Ages in Europe; walled
cities of ancient times also had watchmen.This early role of watching or guarding an area to
secure a city from the dangers of ﬁre forms the foundation of many insurance policy prac-
tices today. One major economic justiﬁcation for security guards is that insurance companies
(particularly ﬁre insurance carriers) will give substantial rate discounts to sites which have a
24-hour presence; for a high-risk or high-value venue, the discount can often exceed the
money being spent on its security program.This is because having a security guard on-site
increases the odds that any ﬁre will be noticed and reported to the local ﬁre department
before a total loss occurs.
Also, the presence of security guards (particularly in combination with effective security
procedures) tends to diminish theft, employee misconduct, and safety rule violations, prop-
erty damage, or even acts of sabotage. In recent years, due to elevated threats of terrorism,
security ofﬁcers are required to have bomb threat training as well as emergency crisis
training. Implementing security systems integrated with risk management policies can be a
valuable negotiating point to reduce insurance premiums.The profession of risk management
has been tightly aligned with insurance providers for the past 30 years. One area of debate
centers on terrorism insurance and whether private industry needs to partner with govern-
ment to provide insurance against catastrophic losses. Much of the recent debate on ter-
rorism risk management has focused on insurance and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002 (TRIA).The RAND Corporation (www.rand.org) notes:
This displacement of risk toward softer targets also shifts the targets
from predominantly government facilities to those that are typically
privately owned. This implies that there has been a displacement of
risk toward targets that are more likely to result in private sector
losses—and, if insured, insurance losses. Ultimately, the displacement
of risk to the private sector is one part of a broader set of policy
questions that are only now being explored by researchers and poli-
cymakers alike: what is the appropriate allocation of security
resources across targets, and what are the vehicles for encouraging
this allocation? Among the unexplored questions is whether govern-
ment support of terrorism insurance encourages a more appropriate
allocation of security resources in circumstances where government
security measures tend to shift risk onto the private sector.

Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

From Individuals to Militia Security
The position of a Roman Vigile continued to evolve through time and later became the
familiar community night watchman and/or constable.A night watchman or small militia
was responsible for the security of towns and cities prior to organized police and security
forces.A constable, depending on the country of origin, could have been a medieval ofﬁcer
of high rank in charge of the defense of a castle, or someone serving as a military com-
mander in the absence of a monarch. In fact, the term constable is most associated with
England, and a constable is a police ofﬁcer in the United Kingdom and most other countries
with a British colonial history. Even today, there is a constable of the Tower of London.
One common characteristic of early security practitioners, the Vigile in Rome or, later,
the night watchman throughout Europe, was “foot patrol.”This is one function that evolved
into formal police procedure and is an important aspect of community interaction today.A
similar comparison can be made with the evolution of the concept of the “infantryman” in
the armed forces. Most armies in history have been built around a core of infantry.Although
the speciﬁc weapons have varied, the common factor is that these soldiers have relied on
their feet for operational movements. Patrol, as in the security profession, is the most
common infantry mission. Full-scale attacks and defensive efforts are occasional, but patrols
are constant. In the earliest days, infantry were essentially armed mobs, ﬁghting in loosely
organized opposing lines under the voice direction of individual commanders. Private citi-
zens made up the original security guard details to protect people and property.As towns
grew to become cities, like-minded individuals joined groups, or militias, to organize men as
a prerequisite to the early police forces of the 1820s to mid-1800s. Just as the beneﬁts of
standard uniforms, equipment, and training would accelerate the development of an orga-
nized military force, the same characteristics would develop within the discipline of orga-
nized security forces, albeit at a slower pace.
From Citizen Guarding to Private Security
The development of the security industry played an important role in history and essentially
bridged a gap between the times of established military structures and the establishment of
organized police forces.The security guarding industry was the commercial business’s answer
to a societal problem, and another early indicator of a defensive security policy playing
catch-up to an offensive security threat.
The original “private eye” or formal security professional in the United States dates back
to 1850 in Chicago, when Allan Pinkerton founded Pinkerton’s National Detective Agency.
Pinkerton achieved national renown in 1861 when he uncovered and foiled an assassination
plot on the life of President Lincoln. During the Civil War, Pinkerton organized America’s
ﬁrst secret service. His pursuits of Jesse James, the Dalton gangs, and his longstanding pursuit
of the Wild Bunch brought extraordinary visibility to his agency.
Among the agency’s main customers were the railroads, which had to contend with out-
laws who robbed trains of cargo and passengers of personal possessions. In the mid-1800s,
www.syngress.com
The Evolution of Physical Security • Chapter 2
41

there were no federal authorities to chase outlaws across state and territorial lines, and local
law enforcement was too poorly equipped to pursue ﬂeeing gangs very far.Therefore, the
job fell to crime victims and their hired agents.The Pinkerton Agency’s work for the rail-
roads helped build an international reputation for the company. In addition to tracking down
and apprehending criminals, the early private security industry performed many other duties
in the absence of organized security forces at the city, state, and federal levels.The industry
also pioneered many of the early uses of technology and procedures that would later become
standard practice in police departments and organizations worldwide.
One of the earliest references to the use of new technology in the security industry
dates back to the use of photographs for mug shots of criminals.The man credited with the
invention of the mug shot and associate recordkeeping process was none other than the
aforementioned Allan Pinkerton.According to Wikipedia, the term mug shot derives from
mug, an English slang term for face, dating from the eighteenth century.Another source sug-
gests the term comes from mug, as in grimace, because early subjects would try to reduce their
mug shot’s value for later identiﬁcation by grimacing or otherwise twisting their facial mus-
cles.This led to the term mugging in the acting profession, indicating “emoting” or “over-
acting” (i.e., an amateurish acting performance). Most mug shots comprise two parts, with
one side-view photo and one front-view photo.The Pinkerton National Detective Agency
ﬁrst began using mug shots on “Wanted” posters from the Wild West days.
Prior to the advent of computer technology, the accused was asked to hold a card with
his name, the date, and other information on it. In recent years, digital photography is used
for the booking process, and the accused is no longer asked to hold the card while the photo
is taken. Rather, the digital photograph is linked to a database record concerning the arrest.
Mug shots are standard practice in law enforcement today. In fact, in the United States alone,
12 million Americans are arrested and photographed by the police each year.
The modern history of surveillance photography may have begun in England in 1913
with the use of mug shots from a clandestine perspective.At that time, the British Home
Ofﬁce approved funds for Holloway Prison to use covert means (secret surveillance) to pho-
tograph inmates. London has since pioneered the use of video surveillance as well, beginning
in 1960 with two cameras in Trafalgar Square, moving into the train station the following
year, and proliferating through the decades as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombings
occurred.Today, according to an article in the Washington Post Foreign Service dated January 7,
2006,“People in Britain are already monitored by more than 4 million closed-circuit, or
CCTV, cameras, making it the most-watched nation in the world, according to Liberty.The
group said that a typical London resident is monitored 300 times a day.”
Later chapters will detail the technology behind security surveillance in more detail.
Alan Pinkerton’s innovations in contracting security services to major corporations (rail-
roads) were an early example of security outsourcing. His additional work in the area of pro-
ﬁling criminal activities and photographs assisted in the investigation of crime and the ability
to predict individual criminal behavioral patterns. It is the work of early practitioners in any
chosen ﬁeld that lays the foundation for advancement of a discipline.Thankfully, Pinkerton

was not alone, as one English lawmaker and, eventually, Scotland Yard, were both advancing
the new ﬁeld of policing.
From Private Security to Professional Policing
Like many cultural innovations, the actual development of the formal police organization
originated in Europe—England, to be precise.There was an obvious time lag in imple-
menting the ﬁrst formal police force in New York City, the Metropolitan Police, in 1845.
The creation of the private detective and physical security guard industries in the United
States, around 1850, helped to complement the duties of formal law enforcement organiza-
tions, as private industry extended westward to new territories, offering opportunities where
formal law enforcement was nonexistent or in short supply.This basic strategy of “profes-
sional security supply and demand” continues today, and is seen in the operations of global
security organizations contracting with major companies in areas of the world where
enforcement is needed to sustain business operations, such as securing supply chains. In addi-
tion, the rise of the privatized military industry and its alignment with the DoD is an
example of a partnership role between commercial security and organized defense agencies.
In researching Wikipedia for the history of policing, you cannot get far without under-
standing the contribution of Sir Robert Peel. He was the conservative prime minister from
December 10, 1834 to April 8, 1835, and again from August 30, 1841 to June 29, 1846. It
was in 1829, while serving as home secretary, that Peel introduced legislation in the British
Parliament setting out the terms of a police force, which was to operate within the city of
London. Peel’s efforts would later earn him the title of the “Founder of Modern Policing”.
In his legislation, Peel suggested nine principles that would govern his police force:
1.
To prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military
force and by severity of legal punishment.
2.
To recognize always that the power of the police to fulﬁll their functions and
duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions, and behavior.
3.
To recognize always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the
public means also to secure the willing cooperation of the public in the task of
their observance of laws.
4.
To recognize always that the extent to which the cooperation of the public can be
secured diminishes proportionately with the necessity of the use of physical force
and compulsion for achieving police objectives.
5.
To seek and preserve public favor, not by pandering to public opinion, but by con-
stantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete indepen-
dence of policy and without regard to the justice or injustices of the substance of
individual laws. By ready offering of individual service and friendship to all mem-
bers of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing. By ready exer-

cise of courtesy and friendly good humor, and by ready offering of sacriﬁce in
protecting and preserving life.
6.
To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice, and warning is
found to be insufﬁcient to obtain public cooperation to an extent necessary to
secure observance of law or to restore order.To use only the minimum degree of
physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police
objective.
7.
To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the his-
toric tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police.The
police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention
to duties which are incumbent on every citizen, in the interests of community
welfare and existence.
8.
To recognize always the need for strict adherence to police executive functions and
to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary or avenging
individuals of the state, or authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.
9.
To recognize always that the test of police efﬁciency is the absence of crime and
disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.
The London police force became known as peelers or Bobby’s boys, a term which was
later shortened to what the English refer to today as Bobbies.The history that originated with
the London police force was the ﬁrst of many leading-edge deployments of law enforcement
tactics and strategies pioneered in the United Kingdom.
Physical Security:An Industry with History
According to Wikipedia, security ofﬁcers are not normally required to make arrests (but have
the authority to make a citizen’s arrest) or to otherwise act as police ofﬁcers, except in some
(notably U.S.) jurisdictions in which the security ofﬁcer is invested with arrest powers such
as those of a county sheriff.
In contrast to this, a private security ofﬁcer’s actual primary duty is prevention of crime.
Security personnel do enforce company rules and can act to protect lives and property. In
fact, they frequently have a contractual obligation to provide these actions. Security ofﬁcers
are often trained to perform arrest and control procedures (including handcufﬁng and
restraints), operate emergency equipment, perform ﬁrst aid and CPR, take accurate notes and
write effective reports, and perform other tasks as required by the property they are pro-
tecting. Many security ofﬁcers are required to go through additional training mandated by the
state for the carrying of weapons such as batons, ﬁrearms, and pepper spray. Some ofﬁcers are
required to complete police certiﬁcation for special duties such as private police ofﬁcers.
The presence of security personnel (particularly in combination with effective security
procedures) tends to diminish “shrinkage,” theft, employee misconduct and safety rule viola-
tions, property damage, and even sabotage. Many casinos hire security guards to protect

money when transferring it from the casino to the casino’s bank. Security personnel may
also perform access control at building entrances and vehicle gates by ensuring that
employees and visitors display proper passes or identiﬁcation before entering the facility.
Security ofﬁcers are often called upon to respond to minor emergencies (lost persons, lock-
outs, dead vehicle batteries, etc.) and to assist in serious emergencies by guiding emergency
responders to the scene of the incident and documenting what happened on an incident
report. Security ofﬁcers (usually armed for this function) are frequently contracted to
respond in a similar fashion as police ofﬁcers until a given situation at a client location is
under control and/or public authorities arrive on the scene.
Regulation
Regulation of the private security industry began in 1915, when California enacted a
licensing requirement for private investigators. Most U.S. states and counties require a license
to work as a security guard.This license may include a criminal background check and/or
training requirements. Most security guards do not carry weapons and have the same powers
of arrest as a private citizen, called a “private person” arrest,“any person” arrest, or “citizen’s
arrest.” If weapons are carried, additional permits and training are usually required.
Normally armed security guards are used (in the United States) to protect sensitive sites
such as government and military installations, banks or other ﬁnancial institutions, and
nuclear power plants. However, armed security is quickly becoming a standard for vehicle
patrol ofﬁcers and on many other nongovernment sites.Armed private security is
uncommon in Europe and other developed countries (and is unknown in some, such as the
United Kingdom). In developing countries (with host country permission), armed security
composed mostly of ex-military personnel is often used to protect corporate assets, particu-
larly in war-torn regions. Most of the nation’s security guards are unlicensed, untrained, and
not subject to background checks.The contract security guard services industry is marked by
high turnover, low pay, few beneﬁts, and scant oversight.And according to government ofﬁ-
cials and industry experts, little has changed since September 11, 2001.
“The security guard industry is a very competitive industry, and their contracts are won
and lost based on pennies per hour,” says Jeff Schlanger of the risk consulting company
Kroll, based in New York.“It’s all about the money.” Experts say that if the government
doesn’t demand higher standards, the industry will continue to provide a dangerous opportu-
nity for terrorists. Some could slip by untrained guards. In other cases, would-be terrorists
could inﬁltrate the system by getting work as guards themselves.
Strategic Objectives
The Labor Department predicts that employment of security guards is likely to grow faster
than average for all occupations through 2010.The main reason: concerns about terrorism.
Security guards earned an average salary of $22,690 in 2005, according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics.Armed guards earn higher salaries than unarmed guards, and those who

work for the federal government have the best earnings potential. Still, this is less than half of
the average salary for police and well below the average U.S. salary for all occupations.
New York Police Department (NYPD) veteran Nick Casale is now a counterterrorism
expert with a national private corporate practice. Casale says that despite the increase in
responsibility since September 11, private contract guards are poorly paid and trained.“The
average security guard receives nationally about $22,000 a year,” he says.“About 22 states
require some form of training and licensing, but there are no education requirements for
security guards, and there is no counterterrorism participation in case an event were to occur
or [training for] what to look out for in that suspicious person.There are no national stan-
dards and only about 16 states require background investigations.”
The House of Representatives is concerned about the lack of standards in the security
guarding industry and is pursuing legislation to improve requirements. One bill (H.R. 4022)
would require private security guard companies to perform criminal background checks, and
would prohibit the hiring of guards who failed them.Another bill would direct the DHS to
conduct security guard emergency training, including training for “acts of terrorism.”The
DHS currently does not have counterterrorism training programs speciﬁcally for private
security guards. In fact, there appears to be no federal or state policy that explicitly addresses
critical infrastructure guards as a distinctive group. If homeland security policy evolves
toward special treatment of critical infrastructure guards, responsible agencies may face a
challenge identifying those guards because of uncertainties in identifying critical assets.
Federal counterterrorism funding for critical infrastructure guards may also present a policy
challenge, since 87 percent of these guards are in the private sector.
The Bush Administration’s 2003 National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical
Infrastructures and Key Assets indicates that security guards are “an important source of pro-
tection for critical facilities.” In 2003, approximately 1 million security guards (including air-
port screeners) were employed in the United States. Of these guards, analysis indicates that
up to 5 percent protected what have been deﬁned as “critical” infrastructure and assets.The
National Strategy for Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets serves as a
critical bridge between the National Strategy for Homeland Security and a national protec-
tion plan to be developed by the DHS.The strategic objectives that underpin the national
infrastructure and key asset protection effort include the following:
■
Identifying and ensuring the protection of those infrastructures and assets which
we deem most critical
■
Providing timely warning and ensuring the protection of those infrastructures and
assets that face a speciﬁc, imminent threat
■
Ensuring the protection of other infrastructures and assets that may become targets
over time by pursuing speciﬁc initiatives and enabling a collaborative environment
between the public and private sectors
It is apparent from industry data that the need to upgrade the skill sets and pay of the
security guarding profession is an issue where resolution is overdue.Threat levels have

increased globally and new risk assessments require an upgrade of the physical security profes-
sion. One of the potential beneﬁts of security convergence is the ability of new technology to
augment the skills of human resources—namely, physical security personnel. In any profession,
human or “operator” error plays a signiﬁcant role in the serious problems that arise. Many of
today’s physical security guards lack training and motivation.As a result, the ability to simply
hire more bodies and proceed with a “business as usual” mentality is a recipe for potential dis-
aster.As the physical security industry grows, additional technology will be implemented into
basic ﬁeld operations, as well as the command and control process.The result is the ability to
increase performance and productivity levels with fewer human resources.
This is not to say that the need for highly trained physical security guarding is reduced.
What technology will offer is the ability to leverage these highly skilled and limited physical
security resources more effectively and eliminate the need to deploy a policy of marginal
security in numbers. Many of the “numbers,” lacking the education or skill requirements to
improve performance ratios, will be replaced by technology to support more highly trained
security professionals whose responsibilities will increase as the security function becomes
central to the operation of global businesses.The job responsibilities, along with pay and skill
levels, will increase, as physical guarding becomes more proactive as opposed to reactive.As
technical advancements are integrated tightly with the traditional roles of physical security, a
signiﬁcant improvement in the industry’s professional image will occur.
Physical security organizations today are evolving through merger and acquisition strate-
gies to expand their product and services offerings to counter new threats to global business
operations. Many ﬁrms are complementing their traditional roles of physically securing com-
mercial businesses with consulting contracts focused on integrating enterprise-wide security
processes and technologies with business operations. Security policy is evolving from a
purely physical, silo mentality to a more holistic approach applied consistently and more
cost-effectively across an enterprise.A new security professional is evolving from traditional
physical roots to embrace technical convergence and move the entire profession forward.

ﬁrms, Securicor and Group 4 A/S, formerly Group 4 Falck. Today, G4S forms the
largest global network of security operations worldwide, with 430,000 full-
and part-time employees operating in more than 100 countries on six conti-
nents. G4S provides security services to governments, agencies, and companies
responsible for some of the world’s most important critical infrastructure sites. 
Group 4 Securicor
Group 4 Securicor (G4S) has a rich tradition of physical security guarding services and in
recent years has augmented that service offering with acquisitions of high-technology ﬁrms
to better prepare the organization for the introduction of the security convergence model to
the security industry. One such company is AMAG Technologies, a leading manufacturer of
security management systems, headquartered in Torrance, California.AMAG has a 30-year
history of innovation in intelligent access control products. It recently announced a video
software solution that integrates seamlessly into a state-of-the-art security management
system.The open-platform design will host future digital applications and provide interoper-
ability with legacy systems.
The strategy of aligning the physical security expertise of the traditional G4S organiza-
tion with leading-edge digital access control and video surveillance technologies from a
company with a worldwide reseller channel is tailor-made for security convergence.All of
the key focus markets in the following list are being heavily impacted by new global risk fac-
tors and will leverage vendor relationships that understand how technology can effectively
improve the protection of all asset classes across business operations:

G4S represents an evolving global security organization that is embracing new opportu-
nities through partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, and technology alliances.The commer-
cial security industry has a long history of protecting people and property through
partnerships with businesses, law enforcement, or military organizations.This trend is evident
today across the globe as security companies position their operations for new opportunities.
From providing commercial companies with protection for their global supply chains, to
outsourcing private military security services to governments (which experts say has been
the fastest-growing sector of the global economy during the past decade), successful security
ﬁrms have proven to be adroit at countering risk.They provide a combination of traditional
manned security services with new technologies to assist in the deployment of security ser-
vices within the framework of their customers’ operations.
The Future of Physical Security
As the global risk to business has increased, the challenge to multinational security organiza-
tions has been to remain ﬂexible in adapting new security models and strategies to keep pace
with new threats. Increasingly, this security solution orientation will involve embracing new
technologies, through partnerships and/or acquisitions, as well as hiring new skill sets beyond
traditional physical security. Physical security has historically provided a silo or stand-alone
deployment strategy that is quickly being replaced by the integration of digital security solu-
tions over global IP networks, to complement new security practices. Just as the security
industry itself has continued to evolve from citizens to organized policing to global business
operations, the basic ability to provide security services remains constant.

The practice of physical security will always remain, and in the future it will be more
integrated with electronic technologies to include the protection of physical as well as digital
assets. It is within this context that the physical security industry is facing rapid and disrup-
tive change in an era of security convergence. New competition will enter the market from
unexpected directions and provide the potential to reposition market-leading companies that
fail to respond quickly. Perhaps nowhere is a changing market more evident than the stellar
growth experienced by the rise of the private military industry since 2001.The bottom line
is still security, and the global market is continuing to evolve post-September 11.
The security industry is well aware of the increasing convergence of
technical innovation, risk management, and physical security in the
security solutions marketplace. At G4S, it is essential that we are
able to respond to an increasing desire from customers to manage
risks through whatever means we deem to be appropriate. By
understanding their issues and combining the best of our knowl-
edge, experience, physical security, and the most up-to-date tech-
nology, we can deploy innovative and reliable security solutions to
our global customer base.”—Nick Buckles, CEO, Group 4 Securicor
The New Security Industry:
From Policing to Military Outsourcing 
The private military industry’s global revenue is about $100 billion, according to P.W. Singer,
an analyst at the Brookings Institution, Washington, and author of Corporate Warriors:The Rise
of the Privatized Military Industry. Singer and other analysts say the industry could double in
the next 10 years to about $210 billion, as governments push more work toward private
industry.Though deﬁnitions of what constitute the industry are evolving, analysts and
industry watchers agree with Singer’s classiﬁcation of three kinds of ﬁrms:
■
Providers who offer combat training and strategic consulting, mostly to govern-
ments with weak militaries, and who take up arms on behalf of their clients
■
Consultants who offer advice and training to clients, but usually do not engage in
combat
■
Support ﬁrms that offer nonlethal aid, such as mine clearing, logistics and supply,
equipment maintenance, and software
According to Wikipedia, a private military company (PMC) is a for-proﬁt enterprise,
sometimes a corporation or a limited liability partnership, which provides specialized services
and expertise related to activities formerly associated with the state.The services and exper-
tise include defense functions, military training, force protection, and security tasks.Although
PMCs often provide services to supplement operations involving ofﬁcial armed forces, they
also are used to undertake security tasks where no state actor is involved, such as personal

Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

security details. PMCs tend to be concentrated in areas of low-intensity conﬂict, where
deploying traditional armed forces might be too politically, diplomatically, or economically
risky. However, they also collaborate with strong states providing military training and in
endeavors associated with the enhancement of homeland security. PMCs are also known as
“private security companies” or “security contractors,” although the latter term usually refers
to individuals employed or contracted by PMCs. Services are mainly rendered for other
business corporations, international and nongovernmental organizations, and state forces.
In the ﬁrst Gulf War, there was one private contractor for every 50 soldiers, according to
The New York Times; in the current iteration, the ratio is closer to 1:8. Behind the dramatic
growth of these private military ﬁrms lies a vast shift in world power that began with the
end of the Cold War.The demobilization that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall meant that
states at the beginning of this century employed far fewer soldiers than in 1989. Over the
same period, marked by the triumph of capitalism worldwide, the incidence of civil wars has
doubled, while the total number of combat zones around the world has vastly increased.1
Private military companies are sometimes grouped into the general category of defense con-
tractors. However, most defense contractors supply specialized hardware and perhaps also
personnel to support and service that hardware, whereas PMCs supply personnel with spe-
cialized operational and tactical skills, which often include combat experience.
PMCs are the second largest force in Iraq, with more than 20,000 active personnel in
the country.The industry is growing, with some estimating annual contracts in the $10 bil-
lion to $20 billion range, and others citing numbers as high as $100 billion.Though a world-
wide phenomenon, the United States and Great Britain account for more than 70 percent of
the world’s market for their services.
Once again the English prove to be a source of continuing innovation in the security
industry. Source Watch (www.sourcewatch.org) traces the roots of today’s private military
companies back to Captain David Stirling, who founded the Special Air Service (SAS) in
1941 to ﬁght the Germans in small hard-hitting groups.The unconventional methods of the
SAS where successful and they remained a British institution after the war.Another early
company was formed in 1975 when three former SAS ofﬁcers came together and formed
the Control Risks Group. By the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher and then-President Ronald
Reagan began efforts to privatize government services. Defense Systems Limited was started
in this atmosphere as former members of the SAS got into the military consulting and
training business. George Bush as vice president began to privatize aspects of the intelligence
services.As Secretary of Defense for President Bush, Dick Cheney contracted Brown and
Root Services (now KBR) a total of $8.9 million to put together a proposal on how to inte-
grate private companies more effectively into warfare.

Command and Control: 
Automating Security Responses
The function of command and control has long been established in the military and com-
mercial business worlds. It has been reﬂected in the corporate pyramid structure of decision
making occurring at the highest levels in the organization, and ﬂowing down to staff and
line management in the way of corporate directives. Seldom did the majority of production
workers and/or middle management have input into the information or process of the deci-
sion-making cycle.This structure was also embodied by all of the branch services in the mil-
itary establishment.The actual IT infrastructures in operation during this time (1960–1980s)
provided alignment within this command and control authority structure and single-source
“mainframe” or central processing mentality.As the technology infrastructure has evolved to
embrace open systems and global IP communications, a move toward collaboration in deci-
sion making and support has progressed in tandem.This has inﬂuenced these command and
control systems and processes by introducing a higher degree of ﬂexibility and innovation to
the traditional process, allowing for more informed and responsive decisions.
Wikipedia deﬁnes command and control (in the military) as follows:
The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplish-
ment of the mission. Command and control functions are performed
through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning,
directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the
accomplishment of the mission. Also called C2. 
It is interesting to note that the military model has advanced to include data interoper-
ability between the services and allies regarding command and control and weapons systems.
The Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS) is a U.S.
military standard for the development and maintenance of tactical information exchange of
conﬁguration items (CIs) and operational procedures. It was originated to ensure that the
command and control (C2 and C3) and weapons systems of all U.S. military services and
NATO forces would be interoperable.The C2 System of Command and Control function-
ality provides innovative thinking and explores ways for the DoD to leverage information-
age opportunities. In some ways, it is the precursor to the C3 System of Command, Control,
and Communications. C3 involves the element of “real time” and has more of a focus on
technical requirements involving computer operating systems, databases, and communication
systems to attain that goal.
I.T.T. Corporation
The concept of command and control management in regard to running a global business
was standard practice that originated in large part with I.T.T. Corporation, one of the ﬁrst
www.syngress.com
52
Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

global conglomerates, under the leadership of its legendary CEO, Harold Geneen. I.T.T.
pieced together a corporate giant during the 1960s and 1970s, buying up businesses such as
Hartford Life Insurance and Sheraton Hotels. During this period, the decision-making power
came to be centralized in the Ofﬁce of the President–Operations.The company became
famous for its monthly management meetings, on both domestic and international levels,
where large groups of executives representing various businesses sat at huge conference tables
(United Nations style) and spoke into microphones detailing operational practices.The
agenda included monthly “red ﬂag” problem items that were detailed, openly discussed for
group input, and expected to be resolved by the next meeting.This shared information was
verbal and hard copy in nature, but it provided an early example of collaboration in support
of a centralized command and control decision-making process. I.T.T. enjoyed an unprece-
dented string of consecutive quarterly earnings growth during an 18-year period and grew
revenues from $765 million to more than $16 billion and acquired more than 350 businesses.
In the process, the I.T.T. Corporation became the benchmark for corporate management
around the world.
The Comstat System
The NYPD in the 1980s, under Chief William Bratton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, estab-
lished an almost identical command and control decision model to that of I.T.T.The
Comstat system used computers and software to automate the process of updating criminal
statistics in real time.The senior and middle management of the police department would
meet in large sessions every week to discuss crime patterns and countermeasures to reduce
incidents.This collaboration streamlined communication between various internal depart-
ments across the organization, which up to that time had operated independently from each
other. We will cover Comstat again in Chapter 3, but we mention it here in relation to com-
mand and control decision making.
“The whole process is often misconstrued,” explains John F.Timoney, former
Philadelphia police department commissioner and former ﬁrst deputy commissioner of the
NYPD.“The system relies on a new way of thinking about police work: Cops aren’t just
personnel managers, no matter how high in rank they are. Until Comstat came along, both
in New York and here in Philadelphia, cops didn’t get together to talk about crime or how
to ﬁght it. Now they do, and that is the biggest change the process can make.”
It is important to understand that it was not only automation, but also the actual com-
mand and control decision process that was upgraded and improved through collaboration. “If
I had one bit of advice to give, it is that departments that want to make a difference should
invest in computers and software and a good crime analyst,” says Captain Paul Chavez of the
Albuquerque Police Department.“Then you get timely, accurate intelligence, and everything
else will fall into place after that. If you don’t have quick access to intelligence, everything else
is hard to do.That’s why intelligence comes ﬁrst on the Comstat list of principles.”
The system proved so successful in New York that it has spread to most of the major
police departments across the country, reducing relevant crime statistics such as murder and

felonies signiﬁcantly, many times by high double-digit margins. It is an example of a tradi-
tional physical security function (crime reporting) embracing convergence with IT to inte-
grate within a traditional (silo) command and control decision-making model and improve it
through real-time intelligence and management (collaboration).
As the security profession moves quickly toward integration with information technolo-
gies, the ability to leave aside traditional stand-alone deployments and centralized decision
making will be a critical requirement for success. New competition is emerging rapidly from
IT companies that are accustomed to fast business decisions and reduced product develop-
ment cycles.They are aggressively partnering and buying their way into the traditional secu-
rity business, with both physical and electronic product offerings.As the proliferation of
open software continues globally, more business management applications are centered on
ﬂexible command and control processes that involve real-time collaboration in the form of
voice, video, and data over IP networks.
Additional Innovations
One example of a new company focused on streamlining the traditional command and con-
trol management function is Israeli-based Orsus, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of situation manage-
ment. Its product provides an entirely new, holistic approach to optimizing situation
planning, response, and analysis.The company is focused on developing software to bridge
the gaps between human and physical resources to improve the effectiveness and efﬁciency
of site safety and security.The situation management system for integrated security and safety
control rooms creates an environment where technologies, people, and actionable procedures
are fused into a customizable uniﬁed control and management platform, while delivering
faster response times and reducing costs.
Applied Global Technologies (AGT) is another innovator, providing IP communication
technologies that improve conferencing and collaboration processes.AGT offers managed
video services, mobile and ﬁxed communication systems, and on-demand applications. Its
technology won the Frost & Sullivan Technology Innovation Award, and incorporates multi-
directional technology that eliminates the token-passing constraint associated with traditional
unidirectional Web conferencing systems.This allows participants to share one or more
screen resources while concurrently viewing resources from other participants, making col-
laboration more interactive and intuitive, and enabling real-time information sharing.
Software with this functionality allows the I.T.T. and NYPD decision-making models to
become virtual, allowing instantaneous collaboration on a global basis.
Even large defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin promote command and control
systems to enable military ofﬁcials to plan and execute coordinated air, ground, and naval
campaigns around the globe. When Lockheed Martin, a Fortune 500 (#47) global organiza-
tion with $39.6 billion (2006) in revenues, highlights collaboration in command and control
decision making, you know the security industry is moving in that direction. Its product
announcements describe a new environment in decision support capabilities:“As concepts of
net-centric warfare evolve, we deliver [Web]-enabled, open architectures, creating systems
www.syngress.com
54
Chapter 2 • The Evolution of Physical Security

that can often be accessed on a laptop through a common [Web] browser. We specialize in
horizontal integration, tying together numerous stovepipe systems and accelerating the deci-
sion cycle, enabling forces to act faster and with more decisiveness.”
SAIC, another Fortune 500 defense contractor, provides command and control software
that provides the image and mapping backdrop for intelligence gatherers to help U.S. war
ﬁghters maintain awareness of the battle space. Modern C4I systems (Command, Control,
Communications, (Computers), Intelligence) are feeding huge amounts of information into
the tactical operating center (TOC) where information is processed, interpreted, and dis-
played on maps and status reports.The latest trend in C2 technology is Command Post of
the Future (COPF), a system currently deployed at the division level, enabling division and
brigade commanders to discuss and collaborate when processing information, sharing ideas,
and attending virtual meetings without assembling at one place.As of October 2006, more
than 500 units are operational with U.S. forces in Iraq. Commanders can be better informed
and thus make better decisions, by sharing situational awareness and collaborating with head-
quarters.The company’s C4I for the Warrior (C4IFTW) concept is committed to the chal-
lenge of providing the information needed to achieve victory for any mission, at any time,
and at any place. In addition, its Future Combat System (FCS) aligns with this concept of
collaborative real-time decision making and is discussed in detail in later in this book.
Meanwhile, the U.S. military is aggressively evolving a ﬂexible, real-time, command and con-
trol decision-making model integrated with the latest information technologies and based on
global collaboration.

Conclusion
The cost of providing completely risk-free security to all of these activities and facilities is
clearly not affordable, and without the use of technology it is probably not even conceivable
to provide acceptable levels of risk management. In this chapter, we examined some of the
most famous historical attempts to provide completely secure borders before World War II,
when the French built the Maginot Line, believing that with the use of new types of protec-
tive systems such as concrete bunkers, tank traps, and other obstacles, they could prevent any
penetration of France by German or Italian forces.The Great Wall of China is clearly
another historical reminder of attempts to prevent invasions using obstacles to advancing
armies as a principle means of defense. In every case in which that has been done, the
opposing force seeks to ﬁnd a way to make the physical barriers irrelevant, often succeeding
because the defender has put so much faith into the seemingly impervious physical defense.
Clearly, the idea that one can perfectly prevent all forms of attack is not achievable on
an absolute level, but the notion that you can make the cost of attack versus the probability
of success less attractive is the formula for risk management. Protecting against every type of
threat is probably not possible, and certainly is not affordable. But it is absolutely essential to
characterize all of the observable or knowable threats in terms of their likely use and prob-
able success. High-consequence, low-probability events demand very careful analysis
regarding the cost to defend. Low-consequence, high-probability events demand very careful
analysis of their repeatability and the potential that repeated exercise of them might increase
the consequences over time. High-consequence, high-probability events must be dealt with
either by eliminating the threat or containing it early, outside the perimeter.
Risk management has evolved over the past 400 years, as we learned how to collect
information in a scientiﬁc fashion and measure probabilities, but where is it going? Michael
Power of the London School of Economics asks,“Will it become a profession in its own
right, like accountancy and the law? Or will it blend into and be absorbed by the main-
stream of management thinking, into such areas as strategic or contingency planning? Three
ideas from the early materials on this commission give me the hope that its work will be
creative: (a) “we cannot eliminate risk; we have to live with it”; (b) risk is rarely given a bal-
anced view”; and (c) “enlightened risk taking should be the goal.”
Risk management as currently practiced offers relatively narrow and tactical objectives:
saving money, reducing credit, market, or operational losses, and improving shareholder value.
Our approach to risk analysis is hopelessly complex and fragmented. Our risk responses are
seldom linked to broader organizational problems. Power suggests that our discipline in the
future, to survive and to play a truly meaningful role in organizational life, must adopt new,
broader, and more strategic goals.
Wikipedia deﬁnes risk assessment as a step in the risk management process. Risk assess-
ment is measuring two quantities of the risk (R), the magnitude of the potential loss (L), and
the probability (p) that the loss will occur. Risk assessment may be the most important step
in the risk management process, and may also be the most difﬁcult and prone to error. Once

risks have been identiﬁed and assessed, the steps to properly deal with them are much more
programmatical.The CISA Review Manual 2006 provides the following deﬁnition of risk
management:“Risk management is the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to
the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and
deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based
on the value of the information resource to the organization.”
Figure 2.4 General Security Risk Assessment
Risk is a function of multiple components: threat, vulnerability, and consequences.As the
convergence of technology and physical security functions intersect, the role of security
expands to incorporate responsibilities that were traditionally viewed as outside the realm of
physical security.The security deﬁnition tends to blur as the value of a corporation’s assets
increasingly moves from a physical model represented by products to one based on products
and/or information assets, as in copyrighted materials, customer records, or services.
The traditional value of physical security has evolved throughout history and has
remained consistent.The ability to protect and defend people and property against threats is
part of human nature. History also reveals that offensive criminal activities create a gap in
security responses as the ability to protect and secure an environment, physical or electronic,
have been primarily defensive in nature.As the risks and threat levels in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury have accelerated, the ability for security as a discipline to respond requires the integra-
tion of traditional approaches with new information technologies. Security convergence is a

model that provides the ability for security policy to be integrated within an IT framework
and operate as a core functional element within a business, government, or educational insti-
tution. Security convergence provides the ability to expand the scope of protections, reduce
current and future risks, and accelerate the response of command and control decision
making.

Introduction
Security convergence has numerous deﬁnitions and involves the ability to leverage tech-
nology to improve the performance of the security function, both physical and electronic. It
is a major trend in the security industry today, but as we try to deﬁne it, we must realize that
it is a subset of a much larger global move toward collaboration as the result of a changing
workforce.The new generation of corporate employee, police ofﬁcer, or military foot soldier
has been raised on interactive technology and gaming programs that promote the abilities to
collaborate and share information in real time across limitless geographic boundaries.As this
mindset penetrates the global workforce, the way in which work is performed will change.
This phenomenon is occurring simultaneously and globally across both government and
industry sectors.A traditional discipline such as physical security, which has resisted major
technical innovations to expand services on a global and collaborative level, is changing
quickly. Services as fundamental as physical security guarding will be signiﬁcantly impacted
by new technologies that provide more efﬁciency with less manpower, not unlike the busi-
ness beneﬁts derived from global outsourcing.
Electronic security software programs are also undergoing fundamental changes as global
communications and mobile access create an environment whereby traditional policies to
protect information assets are inadequate. It is with this global trend in mind that we attempt
to deﬁne security convergence to determine what impact these changing technical, work-
place, and social variables will have on the security industry in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Deﬁning Security Convergence
Security and convergence in and of themselves are interesting concepts, and we need to
examine them separately to gain a clear understanding of their combined business value.As
we noted earlier, security is an age-old concept dating back thousands of years to the dawn
of man. In many ways, it is innate to the human condition.A sense of security may be difﬁ-
cult to deﬁne, yet we know it when we feel it. In this regard, it is similar to the famous
quote from Potter Stewart, associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, when attempting to
deﬁne hard-core pornography and obscenity:“I shall not today attempt to deﬁne the kinds
of material … but I know it when I see it.” With our sense of security or feelings of vulner-
ability, it might be easier to deﬁne it when we don’t feel it.
Whereas a sense of security may be individual, in many respects the common view typi-
cally involves a sense of well-being. Dictionary.com deﬁnes safety primarily as “the state of
being safe; freedom from the occurrence or risk of injury, danger, or loss.” Fair enough. Let’s
leave it at that for the moment.
Deﬁning convergence is not so simple. It does not roll off the tongue as a ready answer
that you hardly need to comprehend, much less give serious thought to.The Cambridge
Dictionary Online deﬁnes converge as “the process of ideas and opinions gradually becoming
similar; a convergence of interests/opinions/ideas.” What is interesting, however, is this note,

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

“compares to ‘diverge,’ ” which was deﬁned as “to follow a different direction, or to be or
become different.”
The term divergence may actually be more synonymous with success in the security con-
vergence model today.This ability to change, or diverge, follows a different path and is fun-
damental to business success. It provides a competitive differentiation and is one of the key
beneﬁts upon which selling a convergence model is based. It matters little what size business
you have. When major manufacturers stumble and fail, upended by fundamental industry
change and an inability to respond to that change in a timely fashion, their sales channels,
supply partners, and customers feel the impact. In addition, the deﬁnition of security is
“freedom from risk or danger, safety; to take precautions to guard against crime, attack, sabo-
tage, and espionage.”This ability to “secure” against threats would apply not only to human
beings, but also to innate objects such as corporate data and personal possessions. In this
regard, the full spectrum of a deﬁnition of security would involve both physical security and
information security aspects. For example:
■
Freedom from danger, risk, and so on; safety
■
Freedom from care, anxiety, or doubt; well-founded conﬁdence
A Three-Pronged Approach
In attempting to write our deﬁnition, we must realize that any discussion of security conver-
gence must go beyond standard deﬁnitions to include an understanding of the impact of
security convergence on individuals, because fundamentally, security convergence impacts
people and their ability to perform their jobs.As emerging technologies (hardware, software,
and networks) provide the platforms for security policy to be accelerated across a global
enterprise, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that people are critical to successful
deployments.The classic “guards and geeks” confrontation comes to mind; however, this is
only one component of the people factor. New executive leadership roles will evolve inter-
nally, as will requirements to collaborate outside the organization. We will discuss these
people dynamics in more detail elsewhere, where we talk about stakeholders; however, it is
imperative that up front we recognize that security convergence involves not only tech-
nology and the application of a security process (physical and/or logical), but also the key
roles and new responsibilities of the people required to effect successful organizational
change and, ultimately, security convergence. Security convergence is a three-pronged
approach composed of technologies, security processes, and people.
According to a report by Frost & Sullivan, the worldwide Internet Protocol (IP) surveil-
lance market will grow to $6.48 billion in 2012 from last year’s $435.8 million. Digital video
surveillance—that is, using computers and networks to store, play back, and analyze surveil-
lance video—is the security technology of the future. It is also a great example of how the
convergence of information technology (IT) with a physical security operation (monitoring
activity) is changing both the guarding service business and upgrading analog infrastructure
to new digital communications.

Traditional video surveillance installations included analog cameras and VCRs, both
which require heavy emphasis on manual observation and operation in the form of
changing, erasing, and storing tapes.Although 80 percent of the surveillance market com-
prises analog cameras today, and newer network video recorder (NVR) technologies are
being deployed,“green ﬁeld” or new installations are almost 100 percent digital.Additionally,
video images are migrating over IP networks to storage area networks (SANs) and network-
attached storage (NAS) arrays already existing in the corporate IT infrastructure.
Sufﬁce it to say that IP digital video surveillance equipment and analytics software are
changing traditional video surveillance operations in the physical security industry.The video
bank of monitors being watched by one or more security guards is being replaced by soft-
ware that determines anomalies in the perimeter and alerts guards in real time. No longer do
security operations have to rely on constant “human” attention to video monitors, the
quality of which deteriorates signiﬁcantly after 40 minutes have passed.These new surveil-
lance technologies improve image clarity; accelerate search times; improve storage density,
footprint, and recovery issues; reduce equipment and manpower costs; and can interface to
other security solutions over an IP network.Time and distance obstacles are removed from
the security operation as well.The ﬂexibility and functionality of IP-based systems allow for
the deployment of leading-edge digital security solutions into wide-area deployments that
would have been technically prohibitive and/or cost-prohibitive with older technologies.
Established integrators are ﬁnding these new technologies critical to addressing new, large-
scale security opportunities.

Convergence Case Study: Lockheed Martin 
Selects New Technology to Protect NYC Commuters
In August 2005, New York’s transit authority awarded Lockheed Martin a $212
million contract, which includes installation of 1,000 cameras and related
equipment in city subway stations, on bridges, and in tunnels. As part of that
contract, Lockheed selected leading-edge technology from a start-up company
based in Silicon Valley. BroadWare Technologies is the network video systems
company that provides standards-based platforms and end-to-end browser-
based solutions for collecting, recording, routing, and managing live and
archived surveillance video while optimizing the use of bandwidth.
BroadWare’s products integrate an organization’s new and existing security
equipment into one interoperable system that evolves as new IP-based tech-
nologies emerge. Lockheed Martin recently selected BroadWare as the core
supplier of video surveillance and media integration components being

deployed within the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
Integrated Electronic Security System and Command, Communications and
Control (IESS/C3). 
The MTA oversees the New York City transit system, Long Island Railroad,
Metro North Railroad, and MTA bridges and tunnels. As the prime contractor,
Lockheed Martin is leading a team to design, develop, and deploy a critical
infrastructure protection system that integrates command, communications,
control, and security capabilities across MTA facilities. The BroadWare Media
Integration Platform has been selected as a component of a video surveillance
subsystem that will initially control more than 1,000 cameras coupled with
motion and intruder sensors to protect subway stations, commuter railroads,
bridges, and tunnels. 
“Lockheed Martin chose BroadWare to ensure that the MTA would have
a highly scalable video and media platform that fulﬁlls all current require-
ments and is easily expandable to meet future requirements over the life of
the system,” said Bill Stuntz, CEO of BroadWare Technologies. “The New York
MTA is one of our nation’s highest-risk public environments, and this
upgraded MTA security system will be one of the largest and most capable of
its kind.” 
The New York MTA subways, buses, and railroads move 2.4 billion New
Yorkers per year—about one in every three users of mass transit in the United
States and two-thirds of the nation’s rail riders. MTA bridges and tunnels carry
nearly 300 million vehicles annually—more than any bridge and tunnel
authority in the nation. This vast transportation network—North America’s
largest—serves a population of 14.6 million people in the 5,000-square-mile
area fanning out from New York City through Long Island, southeastern New
York state, and Connecticut. The MTA installation is one example of how new
security technologies are being deployed to secure huge public infrastructures
that play a critical role in the nation’s economy. 
Very well then. Let’s agree in principal that convergence follows security from a histor-
ical perspective. In fact, compared to security, convergence is state-of-the-art conceptually.
This combination of old (security) and new (convergence) is what may lead to the initial
confusion expressed today around the concept of security convergence.
In computing history, security convergence may be similar to hardware predating the
evolution of software.Yet in terms of the future of security solutions, the value of conver-
gence may play a similar role to software when it comes to mass deployment and new 
innovations.
The strategic aspect of new-solution development is its capability to differentiate and
provide innovation as a competitive advantage in a fast-changing market.After all, security
cameras used for surveillance have been around for decades, yet only relatively recently has
networking provided a cost-effective and global capability to utilize that traditional camera
in innovative ways through hardware advancements and new software features. Future

applications are currently being developed around the concept of “video data vaults”
whereby networking and storage expertise will become key technical and sales require-
ments in the future. Convergence and product innovations go hand in hand within the
context of changing technologies. From a technology viewpoint, Voice over IP (VoIP) rep-
resents a tipping point in the evolution of two technologies converging and, in the pro-
cess, combining to produce a measurable business benefit by reducing telecommunications
costs.
A natural second phase of the evolution of convergence within the IP model involves
VoIP. In many ways, a similar value proposition exists in deploying a video ﬁle over the net-
work to advance the ability to communicate, in this instance visually rather than verbally.
Once combined, this powerful ability to utilize voice, video, and data across the same IP net-
work lays the foundation for any number of innovative solutions to come to market and
increase productivity through improved communication and collaboration.This innovation
wave increases or accelerates the technical change and, in so doing, also increases confusion,
as people try to keep pace with the advances which only a few years ago seemed like simple
and mature technologies.A cell phone or CD player comes to mind; not only have these
devices signiﬁcantly increased their respective capabilities and performance levels, but in the
process of technical advancement, the devices themselves have converged, and together have
become a uniﬁed platform for still more innovation and services.The convergence cycle
repeats itself over numerous technical platforms, from automobiles to wrist watches, as open
source software development tools provide new solutions at record speed. No wonder people
are confused.
This concept of change is second nature in high-tech circles, and the ability to embrace
it quickly is the difference between success and failure. Conservative industries, such as phys-
ical security, need to understand computing history and leverage change to their advantage.
They must accept business reality and focus their efforts toward a new converged security
model and dedicate new resources to execute relentlessly. Likewise, the information technol-
ogist must realize that physical security is not some mindless activity that he can quickly
accept responsibility for and learn on the ﬂy. Losing data is one thing; causing loss of life
through inexperience is quite a different situation.
The bottom line is that security convergence promotes confusion. In a real sense, when
things converge they change form and/or function. For example, two separate streams con-
verge into a larger river. In addition to physical iterations, the process of change, in and of
itself, is difﬁcult and creates confusion on the part of individuals.A technical example would
involve a historically physical process—for example, the function of opening and locking a
door—now being integrated over the IP network to be performed remotely and electroni-
cally. One key to reducing confusion during convergence is to realize how our roles and
responsibilities with respect to physical and logical security can be aligned for the greater
good. Better communication of a common goal is a good starting point, and that common
goal is based on defending the organization. Individual responsibility and technology can
advance in tandem to promote a holistic security policy.

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

One quick example to stress the point is the situation that results from a stolen laptop.
The device has critical digital content, sales forecasts, or customer identity information, yet it
also represents a physical asset and the act of having it stolen requires a criminal investiga-
tion. Whom do you call ﬁrst? Who has the ultimate responsibility to solve the problem?
How can these situations be mitigated in the future to best protect and defend the company
and its secrets, customer information, and ultimately, corporate reputation? The answers
require a close working relationship between both groups.The security issues only grow
more complex from here as we witness the merger of physical security and information
technologies across global operations.
Convergence, in a word, is collaboration. Collaboration means sharing. In its most basic
form, this concept, as it pertains to security convergence, evolves around shared responsibility
to assure a sound defense.The ﬁrst line entry in Dictionary.com for the word defense is “resis-
tance against attack; protection.”
This interdependence between the physical (guards) and logical (geeks) around a
common goal of defending people, property, assets (physical and digital), and corporate repu-
tation forms a common bond that needs to be communicated frequently.At the end of the
day, we all need to pull the rope in the same direction for the common goal of a uniﬁed
defense.The fact that each group may have different values that they place upon security
from an operations standpoint is secondary. Forrester Research sees a growing convergence
market where roles and responsibilities cut across both the IT and physical security domains:
Convergence is the integration of security functions and information
onto a common IP network. As regulatory compliance, protection of
personnel information, asset protection, and business processes
become important factors in security decisions, physical security
cannot sell just to physical security managers, nor IT security solely
to the IT department. The market for converged security projects is
growing rapidly, and within the United States is expected to con-
tinue at an annual 118 percent rate from 2004 to 2008.

Axis Communications: The IP Camera Solution
Axis Communications, headquartered in Sweden with ofﬁces worldwide, has
20 years of networking and IP experience and 10 years of video and imaging
experience. The company understands how networked video surveillance can
drive security convergence.

Continued

In 1996, Axis introduced the world’s ﬁrst network camera. The main
application was to serve live images and video to Web sites, a quickly growing
market back then. A technology timeline is explained by Fredrik Nilsson, gen-
eral manager: “Network cameras ﬁrst started to take off in the educational
markets in 2003, and then government became a big market in 2004, partly
because of actions and funding subsequent to 9/11, but more importantly
because network video was the only solution that could scale to the kind of
system sizes required by the government agencies. That was especially true in
city [center] surveillance where wireless can easily be used with network cam-
eras. In 2005, retail, which is the biggest vertical [market] measured in number
of cameras, started to be penetrated by IP network cameras. In 2006, Axis saw
the mobile transportation market segment take off, winning very large pro-
jects in Europe, in the aftermaths of the London and Madrid public trans-
portation bombings. In 2007, further vertical markets such as banking and
casinos are expected to be next.” Axis has capitalized on high-growth seg-
ments by providing surveillance technology that is leading-edge and easy to
deploy in both wired and wireless environments.
IP networks are ﬂexible, powerful, and advantageous, and they are the
key to providing wide-ranging possibilities in system design, applications, and
solutions. Simply connect an Axis network camera (or video server that is
attached to an analog camera) directly to a computer network by wired or
wireless means, and you’ll have access to live video streams directly from your
desktop with the use of a standard Web browser on a local area network
(LAN), or from any location in the world via the Internet. 
The Dallas Police Department needed a covert surveillance system that
ofﬁcers could easily deploy for gathering intelligence before and during drug
raids. The system also needed to be completely mobile and manageable from
a remote monitoring station without distance limitations. The department
worked with a local Axis integrator and created a system that enables Axis
pan/tilt/zoom network cameras to send video wirelessly over the existing cel-
lular broadband network. The system uses 3G wireless technology to transport
surveillance video from Axis network cameras that are hidden in the area of
the possible drug raid. The Dallas PD can set up covert surveillance near any
location in which a drug search warrant will be executed. Live images from the
site can be monitored 24 hours a day by ofﬁcers in the ﬁeld, at headquarters,
or at home by those who are off duty. This is an example of security conver-
gence providing new solutions to police departments by improving ofﬁcer
productivity and safety, and at the same time documenting evidence for pros-
ecution.
“Since becoming the ﬁrst company to launch a network camera in 1996,
Axis has remained at the forefront of the fast-growing network video
market,” said Soumilya Banerjee, research analyst for Frost & Sullivan.
“Through consistent performance and continuous innovation, the company
has been able to build and retain its leadership position.”

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

Obviously, the challenge of market convergence, divergence, or “change,” to simplify it, is
not new. But it is open to multiple deﬁnitions and is therefore confusing. Immediately pre-
ceding a recent American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) International convention, an
informal e-mail poll of 25 key luminaries representing both the physical security and the IT
industries was conducted.The group included manufacturers, industry consultants, publishers
and editors, sales and technical channel representatives, and end users.The question posed
was simple:“What is security convergence?”The answers, as you may have already guessed,
were as varied as the group members’ professional backgrounds.The responses ranged from
buzzwords such as collaborative partnering and holistic security process to comments such as “I
wish we could just forget about using the word convergence because it only confuses the issue.”As dif-
ﬁcult as the process of deﬁning security convergence may be, we can’t just leave convergence
out of the mix.After all, it is the convergence within the IT infrastructure that will ﬁnally
elevate both physical and logical security solutions to the forefront of enterprise defense in
the new millennium.
Although the future role of security across the organization is evolving to become a
much more critical component of worldwide operations, an understanding of convergence
in general depends on when you want to start.The Alliance for Enterprise Security Risk
Management (AESRM) describes the origins of convergence in its 2005 market survey,
“Convergent Security Risk in Physical Security Systems and IT Infrastructures,” as follows:
The term “convergence” has a long and varied history. The term
originates from the ﬁelds of science and mathematics. According to
the Oxford English Dictionary, its earliest use can be traced to
William Derham, an English scientist from the 17th and 18th cen-
turies (best known for his effort to measure the speed of sound by
timing the interval between the ﬂash and roar of a cannon). Usage
in the 19th century broadened, such as the coming together of
ﬁelds of endeavor. In later years, people applied the term to wind
currents, mathematical series, nonparallel lines, and evolutionary
biology (Charles Darwin used the term in the 1866 edition of The
Origin of Species).
A little history is always good; however, rather than going back to the monkey trail, we
will stay within the conﬁnes of more recent history. One of the pioneering industries
deploying the convergence model on a global scale has been telecommunications.The
advancements in the core technologies have been unbelievable to date, and really lead to the
innovative development of business models such as global supply chains and outsourcing.
Fiber optics is a good case in point.The mass deployments of the technology worldwide
during the stock market boom of the mid-1990s to early 2001 were unprecedented.
Competitive selling and installation strategies were in double-time mode globally.Although
the cost of the technology came down, the installation footprints went up. If you listened to
the marketing and sales propaganda at the time, along with industry CEOs and Wall Street
analysts, you might have believed there truly was no end in sight.
www.syngress.com
Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway? • Chapter 3
67

Of course, you may have also invested in those companies and technologies for good or
bad, depending on your timing.At any rate, the bust ﬁnally did come to pass, and a glut of
worldwide ﬁber optics was available for pennies on the dollar. Many smart emerging
economies, without the anchor of legacy systems, took advantage of the situation to deploy
leading-edge communications infrastructure as a foundation for global commerce.As we
already know, innovative software solutions follow leading-edge hardware advances and the
stage for convergence was set. New applications answered the need for innovative and cost-
effective business solutions.
One misunderstanding in the subsequent deﬂation of the high-tech bubble was that
business applications such as e-commerce came to a halt. Quite the opposite.The automa-
tion of previously labor-dependent processes has never stopped. If anything, during the tech
wreck and subsequent economic downturn, global businesses looked to take more advantage
of less-expensive labor markets and use technology to drive down costs. E-commerce, as an
example, has not even taken much of a rest.The oversupply of cheap telecommunications
technologies such as ﬁber optics has promoted convergence in multiple industries, from
banks to boutiques, and has impacted applications from personalized data mining to online
commerce. Part of the problem with convergence in general is the fact that there are too
many examples. It is so prevalent that if we don’t look hard, sometimes we don’t appreciate
how pervasive it is. In the case of a traditional industry, such as physical security, the capa-
bility of convergence to change the business model is occurring so quickly that many do not
realize it is happening. It is like a strong undertow at the beach. Everything appears ﬁne on
the surface, until you swim out a little too far and realize that the circumstances call for new
thinking and an immediate response; otherwise, you’ll sink.
Functional Convergence 
Drives Security Solutions
Just as computing hardware inventions preceded application development, the process of
technology convergence is a step ahead of security solutions.As hardware becomes a com-
modity and operating systems standardize, it is important to put the issue of convergence
into perspective. It is a process that will never stop. In order to answer the question “What is
convergence anyway?” we need a simple, everyday, mass-deployed example.
“Convergence is your razor.” No, not your new ﬁve-blade shaving system, your
Motorola cell phone, or whatever your preferred model of mobile technology may be.This
example, applied to the latest phone technology, actually works well as a deﬁnition. In a cel-
lular phone, multiple new technologies have combined into one device and, in the process,
have completely changed the concept of a 100-plus-year-old invention called the telephone. If
you think about it, how long will it really be before some innovative marketing executive
decides to rename the device altogether so that phone goes the way of cassette tape? 
“Convergence is action.” Considering recent technical advances, this is just the begin-
ning. New services that we can’t even imagine today will be available on our cell phones
www.syngress.com

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

tomorrow and most will have nothing to do with making a phone call. Convergence has
allowed customers to use cell phones for e-mail, Web searches, ofﬁce applications, picture
taking, and video streaming. We can now spend an equal amount of airport time today using
our cell phones for activities other than voice calls—all-digital, all-wireless, anywhere, and
anytime. Japan is one example of a society that is embracing and advancing the use of mobile
technology solutions in everything from gaming to “quick scan” payment systems.As science
ﬁction author William Gibson likes to say,“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly dis-
tributed.”
The cell phone example works because anyone reading a Syngress book today most
likely does not rely on a rotary phone.This example also underscores a few important trends,
which apply to convergence generally.The device consolidates multiple complex technolo-
gies into a simple and compact end-user device.The device is then the vehicle by which
numerous companies can create new services and solutions to sell to us.This changes
another fundamental in the selling cycle because now the technology is cheap enough to
deploy en masse at the consumer level. In other words, we get to suggest or develop the new
products and services.
This is quite a change from the way technology was typically evaluated and deployed
through the IT department in corporations and then rolled out to end-user departments.
How long was it before a police ofﬁcer looked at a ﬂip phone display and realized that he
could view remote video from a handheld device? Or that he could download mug shots of
suspects or crime scenes? How long before he realized video clips and photos could assist in
the reporting of crimes and accidents while reducing paperwork and increasing patrol time?
When did the emergency room doctor suggest monitoring vital signs remotely via a cell
phone to accelerate medical responses? General Motors uses the wireless OnStar communi-
cations system of automated vehicle logistics and emergency response as a value-added
selling tool for personal safety and security in the event of an emergency. Consumers are also
in a position of deﬁning innovative solutions to make their professional and personal lives
more productive and enjoyable. In some cases, it even results in improving public safety and
actually saving lives.
The cell phone is a simple example used to emphasize how “security convergence”
will fundamentally change the direction of the traditional physical security industry.
Conceptually, we will always need to be safe, but how we ensure the safety of our people,
property, and digital assets across the company and around the world will require close col-
laboration among all types of physical and logical security solutions and the information
infrastructure.The cell phone highlights the technical timeline of basic functionality coming
to market prior to a security process being established.This has been true since computing
broke the boundary of the glass house mainframe mentality. Once the technology became
mobile, in the form of desktop personal computers, laptops, and now handhelds, security has
been in catch-up mode.The mass deployments of mobile computing devices require new
and innovative security solutions to protect and ensure that this new technology can reach its
full potential.

As cell phones morph into mobile computing devices, security at the end point will be
increasingly critical to preventing cyber attacks. Mobile threats can take on many forms,
including malware, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and fraud.Although these
attacks aren’t new, their capability to leverage mobile devices is.The use of mobile devices
continues to grow because of their increasing utility that makes them an indispensable part
of our personal and professional lives. Because of this, criminals are discovering a greater
number of targets than they previously had when their sole focus was on traditional com-
puter systems.
With the proliferation of mobile devices, today’s criminals have yet another attack vector
to exploit their targets. But many mobile communication providers are unprepared to
address these threats.Although there is much discussion as to where security should be
implemented—at the mobile device, within individual organizations, or within the mobile
solution provider’s cloud—most experts agree that to be effective, much of the security must
be in the cloud, although a layered approach is certainly the best in a perfect world.Thus, the
notion of security services provided by mobile communication providers is rapidly becoming
top-of-mind as customers demand better security solutions for their mobile devices.
Mobile Malware
Sixty percent of enterprise data will be mobile by 2006.—IDC
…device-side anti-virus (tools) for cell phones will be completely
ineffective. The most effective approach to blocking mobile malware
will be to block it in the network.—John Pescatore, vice president
and Research Fellow, Gartner Research
Mobile malware is rapidly evolving. It is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can propa-
gate much faster every day. In fact, experts predict that the evolution of mobile malware will
outpace the growth of traditional Internet malware. Malicious intent ranges from sabotage to
fraud, and because organizations and individuals depend more and more on mobile commu-
nications, the stakes are high.A pandemic-level attack could easily and quickly impact mil-
lions of users.
Smartphones are increasingly powerful and programmable.They run on operating sys-
tems including Symbian, PalmOS, and Windows Mobile. Many have open application pro-
gram interfaces (APIs) and offer a number of connectivity mechanisms through which
malware can spread or carry out malicious acts, including:
■
Connectivity to mobile networks, the Internet, and organizational LANs
■
Symbian installation ﬁles (SIS ﬁles)
■
Short Message Service (SMS)
■
Multimedia Message Service (MMS)

We have to acknowledge that today’s mobile viruses are very similar
to computer viruses in terms of their payload. However, it took com-
puter viruses over twenty years to evolve, and mobile viruses have
covered the same ground in a mere two years. Without doubt,
mobile malware is the most quickly evolving type of malicious code,
and clearly still has great potential for further evolution.—Kaspersky
Lab
These devices are typically always on and boast higher mobile network speeds.That
means complex malware can propagate more quickly. In just the past year, we have seen an
increase in the number of mobile malware attacks aimed at both sabotage and ﬁnancial gain.
Threats have mushroomed from multivector worms using Bluetooth and MMS, to cross-
infection attacks between mobile devices and PCs, to the ﬁrst instance of mobile spyware in
March 2006. Ultimately, these attacks can lead to denial of mobile resources, information
theft or destruction, and fraud.
The number of malicious software programs created for mobile
devices is expected to reach 726 by the end of 2006, up from an esti-
mated 226 at the end of 2005, according to McAfee.
Mobile solution providers are now concentrating their efforts on telecommunications-
grade solutions that can efﬁciently and effectively identify and respond to abuse with
advanced event correlation, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and incident response
solutions. Without these solutions, mobile customers are left to fend for themselves.
Notes from the Underground…
Swisscom Mobile Fights Malware
Swisscom Mobile is the leading mobile communications provider in
Switzerland. It has deployed ArcSight ESM to correlate and identify patterns
within its wireless access infrastructure for the purposes of malware and virus
detection.
Swisscom Mobile chose ArcSight as part of its program to provide moni-
toring and ﬁlters for mobile malware countermeasures. Its solution is based on

ArcSight ESM capabilities in identifying varying usage and data patterns. Risks
related to mobile devices prompted Swisscom to add new dimensions to its
network security by leveraging ArcSight ESM.
“Mobile malware is becoming one of the largest single risks to mobile
handsets, but our deployment of ArcSight ESM allows us to protect our cus-
tomers and network,” said Marcel Zumbühl, head of security for Swisscom
Mobile. 
Prior to pioneering this implementation, the main challenge Swisscom
Mobile faced was to ﬁnd robust software for malware detection that per-
formed as a telecommunications-grade solution. The company chose the
ArcSight solution because of its scalable and extensible architecture and its
automatic pattern detection capabilities. It also has the capability to support
the largest number of disparate devices and the power to accommodate
telecommunications-grade trafﬁc volumes from Swisscom Mobile’s current
customer base, as well as allowing for future growth.
“The fact that we are among the ﬁrst mobile operators with this type of
solution to speciﬁcally target mobile malware reduces customer risk. The
advanced event correlation provided by ArcSight ESM allows us to react in a
timely fashion [to] new threats,” stated Zumbühl.
Security Convergence Is 
Changing the Security Culture
A Wall Street Journal article dated October 23, 2006 cited a recent survey by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, CIO magazine, and CSO magazine that found that 75 percent of
organizations have some form of integration between physical security and computer secu-
rity, up from 53 percent last year and just 29 percent in 2003. In addition, 40 percent have
the same executive overseeing computer and physical security, up from 31 percent last year
and 11 percent in 2003.This trend is clearly obvious to John Moss, CEO and founder of S2
Security Corp., an innovator in the development of network-based integrated physical secu-
rity solutions.These systems combine access control, alarm monitoring, temperature moni-
toring, video, and intercom capabilities. Moss sees security convergence aligning within the
larger realm of a security policy and describes convergence as follows:
Convergence (of IT and physical security) means the adoption by the
physical security market of IT technologies and methods and the
simultaneous support by the IT community of physical security appli-
cation requirements. I think the concept is about management inte-
grating their physical and IT security-related policies, expertise,
systems, and responses to improve corporate security and to effec-
tively use corporate resources.

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

As security policy gets more attention from senior management, who have a detailed
understanding of the annual costs involved within the corporate IT infrastructure, it makes
sense for alignment between the physical security and IT organizations.The same cost bene-
ﬁts can be derived from security consolidation as any other business unit, and the additional
government reporting requirements can be automated and streamlined for compliance
reporting.
With more than 32,000 members,ASIS International is the preeminent international
organization for professionals responsible for security.ASIS International deﬁnes convergence
as “the identiﬁcation of security risks and interdependencies between business functions and
processes within the enterprise, and the development of managed business process solutions
to address those risks and interdependencies.”
ASIS feels that this deﬁnition captures a signiﬁcant shift in emphasis from security as a
purely functional activity within an enterprise, to security as a “value add” to the overall mis-
sion of business.This is an important observation because it essentially changes the way the
concept of security is positioned within the enterprise.This impacts everything from security
policy, to organizational responsibilities, to funding priorities.
One company that has displayed a knack for understanding the mission of its worldwide
customer base over the years is IBM. When it comes to the security convergence market, it
is no surprise that IBM’s presence is the direct result of customer expectations.As Eli
Primrose-Smith, vice president IBM Global Security Solutions, explains:
We don’t get into businesses lightly. Customers are asking for this.
We are increasingly seeing a convergence in the market of IT secu-
rity, with physical security and the need for tying it all together in
an end-to-end, comprehensive system.
As IBM enters a new market opportunity that it clearly believes has tremendous upside
for the long-term value add of its professional services organization, it has also simultane-
ously deployed a core of key technical visionaries.This advance team evaluates products and
creates partnerships to align IBM with the best solutions available in the marketplace. One
such self-described “evangelist” is Len Johnson, an 18-year IBM technologist who travels
worldwide to craft the digital video storage solution strategy for the IBM Systems &
Technology Group. Johnson sees the convergence of digital video content creating new mar-
kets in the future:
Convergence to me equals opportunity. As the security industry
transforms from being based on proprietary custom hardware with
limited data access to one that is based on an open-standards-based
IT infrastructure, there is huge opportunity for growth. As the actual
video data moves from videotape formats to ﬁle-based formats, the
opportunity to exploit this data in new and very interesting ways
creates business value. The industry is beginning to recognize that
the new IT-based security and surveillance solutions of today can be
a mix of components from several vendors to provide the robust

solutions needed to support new and growing uses of the video
asset. Servers and storage from very traditional IT companies, [and]
the video management software from companies [that] specialize in
that area, are becoming the norm in the acquisition process. Video
analytics and integration with various sensors are becoming almost
commonplace as this software matures. By keeping video longer and
using sophisticated video analysis tools, new and different trends
can be uncovered. Video data mining is on the brink of being real.
You can imagine the formidable one-two punch that IBM and Cisco Systems provide
when partnering in the market of video surveillance.As Johnson, the visionary, describes
new application areas emerging today involving video mining, John Chambers, CEO of
Cisco Systems, believes his company will impact traditional physical security vertical markets
“one billion-dollar industry at a time.” Cisco routers will incorporate digital video technolo-
gies.The technology will enable Cisco to bring the home alarm industry into the digital
age. Indeed, the company thinks it could create a billion-dollar market for gear that transmits
video from your baby’s crib to your cell phone, or from a break-in to the local police sta-
tion.To put it simply, the traditional security alarm business will never be the same again. In
fact, in a few short years, you may not even recognize it.
When it comes to convergence between high technology and traditional security busi-
nesses, consider the recent announcement from Cisco Systems and ASSA ABLOY, the
world’s leading manufacturer and supplier of locking solutions.Their collaboration will result
in a “networked door” that combines new Cisco patent-pending IP-based converged access-
control technology with ASSA ABLOY’S door lock components featuring the Highly
Intelligent Operation (Hi-O) lock-technology standard.This combined solution simpliﬁes
both the installation and the operation of badge readers, electromechanical locks, and other
door security components and enforces integrated network and physical security policies.
Historically, physical and network security systems have been independent and isolated from
each other. Cisco and ASSA ABLOY see the value of enabling security applications to
operate on a converged physical security and IP-based infrastructure.
Sandy Jones, president of the security industry research and consulting ﬁrm that bears
her name, has seen numerous convergence cycles over the past two decades:
It’s a very fundamental issue, and in my opinion, convergence is no
different [from] any other phase in the advancement of technology.
We went through this when we integrated (or converged) access
with video, and burglar alarms with ﬁre alarms. As in the past, we
are taking advantage [of] and leveraging new technologies and the
world around us. And again, when we do so, [we] are disrupting
current organizations, methods, means to market, and relationships.
Perhaps this last point is the key to understanding the slower pace at which security
convergence is proceeding in the physical security market when compared to its high-tech-
nology peers.A legacy customer base upon which physical security solutions rest and where
www.syngress.com

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

product upgrade cycles are measured in six- to 10-year periods are essentially not an issue
for high-tech companies entering the market. Because the physical security market has expe-
rienced convergence before, it assumes a similar pace of change. However, this will prove to
be a critical ﬂaw in business judgment because this convergence cycle involves high-speed
networking technologies.The IT manufacturers and their channels entering the security
business today are more experienced in managing rapid technology cycles.They are experts
in moving customer bases from legacy systems to new platforms through integration projects
based on productivity improvements and return on investment (ROI) calculations. In doing
so, these IT vendors are positioning the convergence to new technologies as a competitive
advantage for their customers.These customers are accustomed to three-year depreciation
cycles on their technology investments.This may in part explain the speed at which security
convergence is accelerating across the enterprise and why at the same time the traditional
physical security ﬁrms tend to be slow in recognizing the pace of change, falsely assuming
convergence to be ﬁve years away when in fact the cycle will be mostly completed within
that time frame. In point of fact, the physical security market understands and has experi-
enced convergence cycles in the past. However, the major problem is a misunderstanding of
the accelerated pace security convergence is experiencing today due to its limited under-
standing of current networking technologies.
Putting the past into perspective is important when we want to get a grasp on the
future. One cannot assume new convergence cycles will proceed at the same speed as former
ones given the extreme advances in core technologies such as networking and storage.
Twenty years from now, we will look back and realize that this new era of convergence
between IT and physical security actually improved upon the common deﬁnition of safety
for individuals and organizations.The increased focus on accelerating the deployment of
both physical and logical security solutions across the extended enterprise will emphasize the
use of industry standards and strategic “best practices.” Securing everything from mobile
handheld devices to data resting within huge SANs will become standard operating proce-
dure.The installation of security software across the organization will take on a more
strategic nature, rather than having multiple vendors providing similar solutions to numerous
departments without the ability to share data effectively.This is simply an extension of how
many corporations have already deployed software solutions across the enterprise in depart-
ments from engineering to accounting. New versions of Enterprise Security Management
(ESM) software will serve as the control centers to optimize and automate network security,
integrating physical security access control with video surveillance and emergency response
alarms, for real-time threat management.
These changes occurring across the enterprise will improve overall security and provide
a more manageable environment from which to administer a strategic enterprise policy.
Once established, these “best practices” can become a benchmark by which to judge and
manage third-party supply chain partnerships and promote trusted and secure relationships.
The improvement of security policy, both internally and externally, will extend a competitive
advantage to the corporation and support a strategy of continuous innovation through the

convergence of new technologies and solutions.The future is very bright for the role that
security will play in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
As security solution innovations take on a “what if” mentality, maybe that marketing
executive will turn the cell phone we know today into the virtual security pod of
tomorrow—the sPod, if you will. Perhaps there is a future deﬁnition for security conver-
gence in there somewhere. It would not be out of the realm of possibility to imagine that
Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Inc., might ﬁgure out a way to capitalize on securing the world-
wide supply chain.After all, the iPod already has a video, audio, and storage capability with a
sub-$100 price point. How difﬁcult would it be to apply global positioning system (GPS)
and sensor technologies to the device and mount it on every shipping container on every
plane, train, truck, and boat in the supply chain? As chemical compounds emit characteristics
in transit, the sensors alert global positioning devices and intercept cargo prior to its
intended destination. Maybe this is far-fetched and physics will allow you to miniaturize
only so much; however,Apple seems to be a good example of utilizing technical conver-
gence to enter new markets.The iPod is a great example of how a digital IP device and
marketing strategy took 40 percent of Sony’s handheld music market in just 18 month’s
time.The engineers and executives at Sony are not stupid people, yet they were looking at
traditional competitors when the real threat came out of left ﬁeld. It was a pure IP play, and
it hit the market in months, not years.That is the power of IP digital networking leveraged
with a convergence business model, and Apple lives for it. If Steve Jobs has his eye on
Hollywood, why not the security market? 
The point is that the coming security convergence market will introduce new competi-
tors from places where you least expect.The ASIS trade show in Dallas in 2004 was an inter-
esting event. Stanley Corp., a 100-plus-year-old manufacturer of hammers and saws (among
other products), announced the formation of the Stanley Security Solutions Group. Fast-for-
ward two years: It has purchased numerous companies, primarily in the physical security
market, and the division is approaching $800 million in annual revenues (at last count).The
company uses the following statement on its Web site to describe the Security Solutions
Group:“An integrated team of twelve specialized businesses with more than 3,000
employees, 50 divisional ofﬁces, and 600 service vans, we can respond to your needs in ways
no other security provider can.” We can argue the future of this strategy, but this is certainly
an example of a brick and mortar manufacturing company addressing a new market.
However, a new market requires much more than additional bodies to provide services.That
model is also changing as a result of technical convergence.The advent of wireless video
solutions is only one of many new security opportunities that physical security integrators
such as Stanley Security Solutions hope to capitalize on in the face of new competition from
IT vendors and integrators. But will they execute?
The real question is how fast will they integrate true IP-based and wireless convergence
solutions and partnerships into their business model? Time and revenue will tell. Large phys-
ical security integrators such as Stanley Security Solutions have many challenges ahead of
them. Not only must they execute a merger and acquisition strategy quickly and efﬁ-
ciently—never an easy task—but they also must have the right combination of physical and
www.syngress.com
76
Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

IT skill sets.The IT functionality side of this model is not something that Stanley Security
has a business background in, hence the acquisition strategy.
This fact extends beyond Stanley Security Solutions to the entire physical security inte-
gration community.These physical security integrators must be certain that the acquired
companies have new skills, and not simply more of the same from a physical security stand-
point.This may be outside of their traditional comfort zone, but it is critical to long-term
competitive success.
Equally important to a successful security convergence strategy is having executive-level
IT sales experience, a fact often overlooked in the rush to acquire IP networking and
storage-related expertise. Both of these areas, IT sales and technical experience, are not issues
of concern for traditional IT integrators.The fact that the decision cycle for security prod-
ucts (physical- and IT-related) is migrating more toward the IT executive is a welcome ben-
eﬁt to the IT industry, which has been cultivating these relationships for decades.The IT
vendor and integrator channel needs to acquire physical security expertise in a reverse M&A
strategy to that of Stanley Security Solutions, but it has the advantage of actually requiring
fewer new skill sets. Future support models will be Web-based and softwarecentric, as many
problems are diagnosed and ﬁxed in real time.There will always be a need for installation
support, but many in this ﬁeld will migrate their skill sets toward a true integration capability
based on interoperability and ease of administration. Software will be king. IP networking
and storage expertise will run a close second.The integrators that understand how an enter-
prise security policy aligns within the process of IT governance will be worth their weight
in gold. Security is the future, but the future will look very little like the past.
The Convergence Role in Accelerating
Security Solutions Worldwide
In November 2007, Cisco Systems reported record quarterly revenues of $8.2 billion, a 25
percent increase year over year, and $19.5 billion in cash and equivalents.
It has taken an industry-leading role in the security convergence marketplace. When an
organization of its size and stature enters a market so aggressively and visibly, it is important
to understand the ramiﬁcations on related industries. Very simply, Cisco Systems has a
strategy to run all uniﬁed communications over a single IP network: one IP connection for
e-mail, instant messaging, project collaboration, physical security, and private branch
exchange (PBX) phones. It believes that the annual market for uniﬁed communications will
reach $10 billion within three to ﬁve years.The interesting thing to note is that this is the
same time frame that many executives in the physical security market think it will take
before security convergence actually gets off the ground.
Steve Hunt is a leading security industry consultant and founder of 4A International. He
formerly led the security research teams of Forrester Research and Giga Information Group.
For 24 years, Hunt’s career has spanned the breadth of the security industry: physical, home-

land, corporate, and data security. He comments on the emergence of the IT majors and
their designs on the physical security market:
Highly competitive IT manufacturers are ready to spend hundreds of
millions [of dollars] to expand to new verticals, and the $120 billion
physical security industry is their prime target. The optimal solution
is to converge the two industries.
It is interesting to note the industry agreement that up of 50 percent of this total market
is composed of traditional physical guarding services.As innovation technology is deployed
in its initial stages within military applications to provide force protection technology, it ﬁnds
its way to the commercial environment in phase two.This migration from military soldier to
guard services will change the face of traditional physical guarding in the near future.
Guarding services is one of the oldest of the physical security professions, and it will
leverage these new technologies to improve productivity.As innovations move forward to
protect foot soldiers and improve their lethality, a full range of capabilities also improves.
Wireless video surveillance and night vision capabilities, lightweight body armor, wireless
communications, GPS and radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tracking, and handheld
WMD sensors all become available to public service and commercial organizations to reduce
crime and control fraud.These latest military technologies not only enhance their ability as
ﬁrst responders, but also can improve communications and accelerate training time.
Additionally, these applications increase collaboration across wide areas and can be applied to
securing corporate supply chains from the aspects of electronically tracking inventory and
physically securing lost or stolen property.
The convergence of physical security with technology will fundamentally change the
guarding services business, reducing the number of physical guards while simultaneously
upgrading the effectiveness and professional skill sets of future security guard services.
Professional guard services will take on a much more technical role and become embedded
into the business processes of the corporation.The guarding profession will move to a model
where few actual guards are employed; however, the guards will be of superior quality and
effectiveness and will be relied upon for additional key services to their global clients.The
ultimate image of the guarding industry and profession will be upgraded and enhanced.
The convergence of real-time, state-of-the-art technologies with security solutions
changes the focus of the traditional physical and logical security businesses.This impact is
huge for one simple reason: Convergence requires businesses to change, and change impacts
corporate culture.This type of cultural change requires executive leadership and middle
management execution. One without the other will get the organization only so far down
the convergence path.The corporations and government agencies that can leverage both of
these skill sets will be the winners, and they will be in the minority, but they will win very
big.The major success factor in the security convergence model is accepting change as an
opportunity to be embraced and not as a situation to be ignored or avoided.
Leadership and change are topics that world-famous management consultant, Peter
Drucker, wrote about extensively. He authored more than 30 books published in the ﬁelds of
www.syngress.com
78
Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

business management, entrepreneurship, and economics. BusinessWeek magazine referred to
him as “the most enduring management thinker of our time.” His wisdom is certainly appli-
cable to the topic of security convergence:
Problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It pre-
vents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results. Above all,
effective executives treat change as an opportunity rather than a
threat. They systematically look at changes, inside and outside the
corporation, and ask, “How can we exploit this change as an oppor-
tunity for our enterprise?”
This issue of change and executive leadership was discussed in detail in 2005 at the ASIS
International annual conference, where the excellent industry study,“Convergence of
Enterprise Security Organizations,” compiled by the AESRM and Booz Allen Hamilton, was
discussed in detail. Christopher Kelly, a vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, noted a cul-
tural change in leadership mentality when he stated:
Convergence is requiring our security leaders to learn much more
about the business and change their perspective of their position,
from a functional subject matter expert to a business person with
functional knowledge.
Recognizing change as an opportunity and establishing the new structure required to
embrace it is the responsibility of executive leadership. Security convergence requires collab-
oration between traditional IT companies and their physical security peers. In both instances,
these respective organizations need each other’s industry expertise.A logical step toward this
mutual business dependency is partnering. However, for a partnership strategy to pay off
with increased business revenues, it requires a major commitment from both parties. In fact,
one of Drucker’s earliest works,“The Concept of the Corporation,” was a study of GM and
its legendary CEO, Henry Sloan, who ran the organization for 23 consecutive years. Sloan’s
wisdom holds true today for companies entering security convergence alliances and partner-
ships:
Strategy follows structure; you cannot effectively plan and then exe-
cute if the organization is not properly set up to begin with; perfor-
mance ﬂows from planning and execution.
We can make an argument that perhaps nothing is more important to an organization of
any size than security.This would explain its roots dating back to the days of Sun Tzu.
However, if we look at physical security within the context of technology and deployment
of those solutions across an enterprise, they are a day late and a dollar short compared with
every other department in a corporation. In fact, physical security is the last one to the party.
Many physical security devices in 2006 continue to have proprietary designs and 10-year
depreciation cycles, and are sold as standalone (silo) conﬁgurations.As a rule, the worldwide
channel of physical security integrators continues to be more focused on traditional installa-

79

tion and service procedures than in learning the IP networking and technical skills required
for a convergence environment.
One example is the fact that the preferred mode of video surveillance continues to be
analog cameras hung off coaxial cable and requiring hours and/or days of manual labor to
install.The basis of this mentality is that 80 percent or more of the video surveillance
deployments today are analog cameras and that labor-intensive coaxial cable installations pro-
vide good margins. However, this reluctance to look beyond current technology and clearly
see the IP future is dangerous.The situation is really no different from that experienced by
the minicomputer market in the 1980s. While these worldwide billion-dollar corporations
refused to accept interoperability and open systems as a business reality, they planted the
seeds of their eventual demise.Today that entire industry segment is gone. Open systems, stan-
dards, and interoperability are new words in the vocabulary of many physical security manufac-
turers and their channel partners.The good news, in some respects, is that the traditional
security market is not in the leadership position regarding innovation in the security conver-
gence market today.That responsibility rests where it has historically, with the leading-edge
practitioners in our nation’s military community, large defense integrators, and innovative
start-up companies focused on the homeland security market.
One example of a key integrator is Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC), a
Fortune 500® company with more than 43,000 employees in more than 150 cities world-
wide. SAIC provides scientiﬁc, engineering, systems integration, and technical services and
products to all branches of the U.S. military, agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and
other U.S. government civil agencies, as well as to customers in selected commercial markets.
Phil Lacombe. senior vice president and general manager, Integrated Security & Systems
Solutions, explains his preference for dealing with multiple executives on the convergence
issue:
We have concentrated our business on the government side because
this segment has a higher level of appreciation for security concerns.
In both government and private sectors, there has been an overlap
between physical and information security. It’s clear from an opera-
tion or business perspective that you have to protect information
and provide physical security, which means interfacing with both
CSOs and CIOs.
The U.S. government has embraced physical and logical security convergence. It recently
declared that all individuals accessing DoD systems must possess common access cards (CACs).
These cards are used for physical access to DoD facilities as well as to information systems.This
leading-edge work is providing the foundation for “smart card” technology.This initiative
results from Homeland Security Directive 12 (HSPD-12), issued by President Bush August 27,
2004, which requires all federal agencies to use secure, reliable, and common ID standards for
their federal workers and contractors. Eventually, more than 50 million government cards could
be issued.The Lehman Brothers Annual Security Industry Report 2006 states:
www.syngress.com
80
Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

We believe that the HSPD-12 program, which will likely create a
standardized biometric/RFID contact-less ID card for all federal
agency government workers, appears to be the ﬁrst signiﬁcant ref-
erence site that commercial enterprises need to determine whether
biometrics (and RFID contact-less smart cards) can work on a massive
scale in the private sector. We estimate that the biometric- and RFID-
based smart card market will experience rapidly accelerating growth
in the next three to ﬁve years, with the key driver being govern-
ment-driven initiatives mainly via the HSPD-12 directive.
In fact, security and its issues are important enough that the government is extending its
reach into the entrepreneurial community.The CIA actually has its own internal venture
capital fund, In-Q-Tel (www.in-q-tel.org), headquartered in Virginia and well positioned on
Sand Hill Road, in the nexus of Silicon Valley’s venture capital neighborhood. In-Q-Tel is
looking for new products and solutions that will provide value to the agency ﬁrst, and then
extend proﬁtability into commercial markets. In-Q-Tel was established in 1999 as an inde-
pendent, private, not-for-proﬁt company to help the CIA and the greater U.S. Intelligence
Community (IC) to identify, acquire, and deploy cutting-edge technologies.To date, the ﬁrm
has generated more than $1 billion in private sector funds to support technology for the
CIA and the IC.
Another leading ﬁrm is Paladin Capital Group (www.paladincapgroup.com), a pri-
vate equity investment company based in Washington, DC. Paladin’s Homeland Security
Fund is focused on investments in existing companies with immediate solutions designed to
prevent harmful attacks, defend against attacks, cope with the aftermath of attack or disaster,
and recover from terrorist attacks and other threats to homeland security.Two principal
players in the ﬁrm are retired Lt. General (USAF) Kenneth Minihan, former director of the
National Security Agency (NSA); and James Woolsey, current partner of Booz Allen
Hamilton and former director of the CIA.These are two examples of leading-edge strategies
to deploy advanced technologies into government agencies, which will then migrate to
commercial businesses for mass deployments.
As we examine the impact of technical convergence on the physical and logical security
disciplines, it is important to understand how corporations have addressed it to date.The
consolidation of standard business applications and processes across worldwide IT infrastruc-
ture is nothing new to major corporations. Consider the ﬁnance department for a moment.
How confusing would it be if every department had a different accounting software solution
deployed over proprietary networks and databases unable to share information? A separate
vendor for each remote location would also support each department. What a mess; no one
would be paid on time or consistently.
The truth is that this scenario is not far off the mark when examining physical security
installations of video surveillance and access control, or the numerous copies of multivendor
security software for antivirus and intrusion detection deployed around corporations today.
Security convergence needs to collapse and consolidate this multivendor silo approach to
security solutions and replace it with the standards-based open and interoperable advantages

81

that other departments in the organization already enjoy. In doing so, not only will the
deployment of security gain exposure and recognition across the enterprise, elevating the
stature of all security practitioners, but also in the process, it will return the ROI the execu-
tive staff is looking for in justifying enterprise security policy.
One example of where the security department can turn to benchmark a process is the
engineering department. More than 20 years ago, vendors designed and sold the ﬁrst itera-
tions of 3D computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software.
The idea behind it was to consolidate engineering brainpower and collaborate to stop rein-
venting the wheel, literally, in different design departments across the organization.This pow-
erful software would improve upon 2D design functions and replace existing drafting tables.
The productivity improvements would be off the charts as the cumulative brainpower of
engineers from across the corporation and around the world focused on improving produc-
tivity by automating the process of product design. Certainly, this technical leap was not an
easy change, but it was well worth the effort.
The two constants that always involve most new innovative solutions is the impact on
network bandwidth, always at a premium, and organizational change. However, think for a
moment where organizations would be today if they let technical and business change
remain stagnant.The fact is that network bandwidth is one of several technologies (CPUs,
semiconductors, storage) that continues to advance to meet the demands of new solutions.
And change is another constant. Change is always a major impediment to deploying new
tools and solutions to established concepts of work because human beings are involved, and
our ﬁrst inclination is to resist it. Some folks on the ﬁnal lap of a career oppose change
simply because it is change, and therefore, they are averse to learning anything new.This is a
management issue. Most of us come around, or there would still be a market for rotary
phones.Today, could you imagine the design process in a major corporation still being
accomplished on drafting tables, or software development being done without collaboration? 
The same way engineering management collaborated with the IT department to deploy
a worldwide design process to improve productivity is how both the physical and the logical
security departments need to approach their relationship with IT regarding convergence.The
goal is to embrace the IT department as a trusted partner in the deployment of security
solutions across the infrastructure and in alignment with the stated security policy of the
corporation. Security needs to become a customer of the IT department, not an adversary. In
this way, a partnership can develop based on the mutual need to protect the assets of the cor-
poration. By attaining “customer” status within the organization, the security department
becomes similar in function to other corporate entities such as engineering, ﬁnance, and
sales, in that the performance of the security group’s function depends on professional and
timely support from the IT organization. In this way, the potential for the IT group to block
the deployment of security solutions (such as video surveillance) because of concerns over
network utilization can effectively be neutralized in favor of deploying an enterprise security
policy within the IT infrastructure.

physical security department’s success to the IT group’s ability to support the operation, a
win-win scenario is established and a true partnership can ﬂourish.This does not mean secu-
rity gives up decision-making responsibility; it means the IT department becomes a support
partner in security solution deployment. Only then can security truly enjoy the value and
productivity advantages that technology brings to the process. Can you imagine the ROI
calculation a company realizes when its engineering or development resources worldwide
can follow the sun and continue to work on product design or software development pro-
jects 24 hours a day in an integrated process that eliminates redundant effort? Now apply the
same model and thinking to physical security applications such as a common identiﬁcation
and access control card, or video surveillance. Open systems and interoperability need to
standardize on applications, training, vendors, and digital formats enabling data delivery,
development, search, and alarm notiﬁcations. In the security realm, time and money calcula-
tions aren’t all that matter; this convergence can result in protecting a corporation’s reputa-
tion or brand as well as saving lives. Sometimes the most critical variables are the most
difﬁcult to calculate with a standard ROI model, or measure with a performance metric.
How do you put a dollar calculation on someone’s life? 
The impact of this convergence of information technologies in the development of
numerous industries and general process improvements has been clear over the decades.
However, in today’s global threat environment, there may not be an industry more critical to
the future than that of security:
The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are
likely to see.—Sir Winston Churchill, statesman
Look back over the timeline of technology and you will see many examples of high-
tech companies succeeding and failing at recognizing and adapting new technical trends to
their existing business models.The successful companies identify customer need and respond.
The failures are slow to let go of the old cash cows.
The minicomputer industry once dominated Route 128 in Massachusetts.Today those
billion-dollar ﬁrms are out of business. Why? No interoperability outside of their own pro-
prietary operating systems. I guess they ﬁgured it just was not important. When it came to a
new “open” operating system called Unix, one minicomputer icon, Ken Olsen, founder and
CEO of once-mighty Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), referred to it as “snake oil.”The sight
of 90 percent margins on DEC’s proprietary operating systems blinded perhaps Olsen, and
the entire minicomputer industry. Change is rarely comfortable, but neither is extinction.
However, when you examine the rapid changes that new technologies cause to industries,
companies, their partners, and customers, you see the key role that leadership plays in the
success factor. DEC did not have it when it needed it most. IBM did.
Consider the history of IBM over the past two decades. IBM was once a huge domi-
nating mainframe company, and the old phrase “You never get ﬁred for buying IBM” was
alive and in practice among the largest corporations worldwide in the mid-1980s.Things
were very good for a very long time at Big Blue.The problem was that the company that
www.syngress.com

manufactured leading-edge technology did not do a very good job of considering how its
products worked outside of its own internal universe or within its own product family.A
stubborn attitude and lack of innovative vision crept into the once-proud organization.As a
result of this cumulative effect on its products and culture in the decade of the 1980s, IBM
lost its way. In fact, by early 1993, some industry pundits actually started counting the
months until IBM would go out of business completely.
What was once thought to be an impossibility was fast becoming a potential reality. IBM
had to do something different, so for the ﬁrst time in its history, it went “outside” for a
CEO.An industry outsider, Lou Gerstner, with a background at companies including RJR
Nabisco,American Express, and McKenzie Consulting, took over as CEO and brought IBM
a much-needed customer perspective.As Gerstner explained in his 2002 book, Who Says
Elephants Can’t Dance?, he demanded to know why (as a customer spending tens of millions
of dollars with IBM annually) the product line had interoperability issues both internally and
externally. He saw IBM’s core problem as a customer satisfaction issue and he wanted the sit-
uation ﬁxed.As a result, the IBM Global Services Group was born. More than any other
division, it saved IBM and today generates more than $50 billion in annual revenues. New
thinking created a new division, which in turn saved the company and created a lucrative IT
services market industrywide.This vision leverages new technologies to promote collabora-
tion for continuous innovation across all industries. In fact, the IBM services model may be
the best example yet of using convergence to execute an integration services strategy.
To quote Lou Gerstner, then ex-CEO of IBM, during an address to the Harvard
Business School in 2002,“Transformation of an enterprise begins with a sense of crisis or
urgency. No institution will go through fundamental change unless it believes it is in deep
trouble and needs to do something different to survive.”
This might also serve as the best possible advice to the physical security industry and its
IT counterparts regarding convergence. September 11, 2001 was the wake-up call that
changed the deﬁnition of the security business.Today commercial industry is too slow to
embrace security convergence in a signiﬁcant way and we are less prepared than we should
be.A lack of technology is not the issue in solving the problem.A collaboration of effort
around the concept of establishing a “mutual defense” is required. Both physical and logical
security expertise needs to be leveraged across standard IT infrastructure and platforms
within an enterprise security policy that highlights “defense” as a common bond and pro-
motes “best practices” among trusted partners.Thankfully, the military complex with its large
research projects and defense integration community is leading the way in technical innova-
tion, which at its core is a convergence strategy.
We have heard many times that security professionals are conservative by nature, that
security is too important to constantly risk upgrades to new and unproven technologies.
After all, lives are at stake! However, technology also changes the nature of traditional secu-
rity practices. It is unfair to suggest that the traditional physical security market does not
have its share of visionary thinkers and innovative practices.An early example of a traditional
physical security industry utilizing technical convergence is the New York Police
Department (NYPD) of the early 1980s.

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

Although physical security has been around forever and expertise is fundamental to
everything we do, successful security convergence is not all about IT driving change and
taking the leadership role in transforming business operations. Mutual respect for both
groups’ talents is a basis for successful convergence.The 1998 book Turnaround: How America’s
Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic highlights how then-New York City Police
Commissioner (and now Los Angeles Police Chief) William Bratton pioneered an early
vision of security convergence strategy. In doing so, he signiﬁcantly reduced both overall
felonies (50 percent) and the city’s murder rate (68 percent) in only 27 months.This success
landed him on the cover of TIME magazine and is a great example for both physical secu-
rity and IT departments regarding how collaborating on security convergence can return
unbelievable results.
The now famous system, known as COMPSTAT, represents an innovative process of
integrating IT systems with real-time police procedures. It was the ﬁrst IT-based (DEC)
system to utilize geographic information system (GIS) software to map near-real-time crime
patterns with arrest statistics to determine patrol activity. It aligned police resources with
automated crime pattern data, right down to a square-block area and time of day. Equally
important is that the system drove collaboration among the multiple precincts and various
departments required to guarantee success.This cooperation actually led to a change in the
culture of the NYPD. People in this large organization had to think differently about how to
do their jobs and embrace new technology:
We did things a certain way because we had always done them that
way. We had to banish the phrase “we have always” from our
vocabularies. We had to start asking “how should we do it?” and
“how can we do it better?”—John Timoney, formerly New York City
ﬁrst deputy commissioner and currently Miami police chief
One thing we all realize about the future is that there are no guarantees.The security
convergence wave will carry some companies to the crest of new heights and will wash away
others in a tsunami of missed opportunity.The difference will be time to market. Speed is
the critical component to a successful convergence strategy, and yet this is the vital element
that the conservative-thinking security industry tends to overlook.This cultural deﬁciency in
physical security companies opens the door of opportunity to the IT industry where innova-
tion and business change are embedded in their corporate cultures.The ﬁrst phase of secu-
rity convergence is collaboration through partnering—taking the valuable skill sets each
respective industry has to offer to combine them in a better system and process for securing
the defense of people, physical and information assets, and corporate reputation.The key
ingredient is to recognize where the industry is heading and to position partnership oppor-
tunities accordingly.

Security Convergence 
Is Changing the Sales Channel
When hockey great Wayne Gretsky was asked about his game strategy, he replied,“I skate to
where the puck is going to be.” He could see the ice and anticipate, based on experience,
how things were going to unfold. By positioning himself in the right place to succeed, he
broke every scoring record in hockey.
There are similarities between sports and business history. It seems that the greatest
players, teams, CEOs, and corporations rise to the challenge of changing environments and
leverage new opportunities to their advantage.Andy Grove, founder and former CEO of
Intel Corp., is a case in point. He is one of the true pioneers of Silicon Valley and is a high-
tech industry icon. He has decades of experience in addressing technical convergence issues
and is keenly alert to major trends:
I’m a great believer in, particularly, being alert to changes that
change something, anything, by an order of magnitude, and
nothing operates with the factors of ten as profoundly as the
Internet.
In today’s environment, several technology areas are promoting major changes which are
impacting the future of security convergence. IDC research tells us that today, worldwide
Web-hosting revenues exceed $20 billion annually, wireless communications represents an
annual market greater than $46 billion, and the revenues from Linux open source software
development will grow from $15 billion in 2006 to more than $37 billion in 2008. In
summer 2006, laptop sales surpassed those of PCs for the ﬁrst time.These trends point to the
development of next-generation applications hosted on wireless devices accessing real-time
search engines and databases. GPSes, sensors, and open source software will provide instant
video, voice, and data services over IP.They represent just a few of the “Big” changes that
will change something “Big” in the security convergence model moving forward.These new
technical breakthroughs will be critical to new-product development to answer the threats of
“extreme” corporate risk scenarios.
The future belongs to companies that correctly anticipate trends and quickly respond to
new business opportunities by creating partnerships.As technology advances, it becomes
impossible to have all the expertise required in-house.The ability to develop solutions to cus-
tomer problems through collaboration with partners is what drives a successful convergence
business model.The fact is that large IT vendors require a limited scope of partnerships.The
rationale is that as the largest IT manufacturers enter the security convergence market, they
need to partner with perhaps only 20 percent of their physical security industry peers to be
successful.This partnership strategy is based on accelerating their own time to market to
aggressively compete against other IT manufacturers. IBM worries more about beating HP to
the security convergence market than it does that Honeywell will be too formidable a com-
petitor over time.As mentioned earlier, the traditional physical security market is late to

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

address the convergence opportunity through partnerships.Additionally, these IT vendors are
focused on emerging software ﬁrms developing open system solutions and leveraging tech-
nical trends to deploy wide area security solutions.These huge IT organizations (Cisco
Systems, IBM, HP, Microsoft, Oracle, and EMC) already have worldwide sales and support
organizations, leading-edge research and development staffs with plenty of cash on hand, and
established end-user relationships at executive levels. Security convergence to the IT industry
represents a new, high-growth market opportunity that aligns nicely with the technology
sweet spots of enterprise infrastructure, new innovative solutions, and integration services.
The Pareto Principal originated in 1906 from Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto’s obser-
vation which essentially said that 20 percent of the wealthy owned 80 percent of the land. It
has been modiﬁed through the decades, and today we understand it as basically that 20 per-
cent of the people/tasks are vital and the remaining 80 percent are trivial.
This principal also accurately reﬂects the current and future states of the security con-
vergence market.The largest vendors on both sides of the convergence model are deploying
strategies around security convergence. Five years from now, 80 percent of the traditional
physical security vendors, large and small, and their channel partners will be marginalized or
out of business.They will be displaced by the accelerated focus on open systems, standards,
and ROI models being promoted by IT vendors and increasingly being purchased by their
decades-long contacts within IT and senior management. Major IT vendors control the
enterprise purchase cycle.Agree or disagree, the funny thing about the 80/20 rule is that
basically everybody thinks they are in the top 20 percent.This, of course, is impossible.
Large high-technology vendors have executed a business model of introducing new
solutions to improve their customers’ business practices while simultaneously upgrading the
infrastructure to allow those new solutions to operate effectively. It is no surprise that the
voice, video, and data over IP strategy that Cisco deploys will require more bandwidth and
networking gear. Or that the security surveillance and video mining applications that IBM
promotes will require large IBM blade server conﬁgurations and multiple terabytes of
storage. Network bandwidth, storage, CPU, cache memory, whatever the problem, IT ven-
dors and their huge sales channels have an upgrade strategy for it. One key point is that this
is predicated upon a three-year product depreciation cycle, by which the IT industry sets its
internal clock.
Along the way, the IT vendors have even assisted in the creation of new technology
positions and career paths within their client organizations. Network, storage, database, and
system administrator positions have provided a promotional ladder to vice president titles and
CIO positions.This personnel situation evolved over decades and provides IT vendors a
unique selling advantage in regard to product evaluations, requests for proposals, and ulti-
mately, purchase decisions.This position is enhanced as more responsibility for security solu-
tions migrates toward the CIO organization in search of a senior-level executive to drive
policy across the executive ranks. Whereas the IT industry vendors aggressively compete
with one another in this environment, this sales cycle is new to the traditional physical secu-
rity vendor. With the decision point moving toward the IT department, these security ven-
dors need partnerships not just to collaborate on solutions, but to leverage these IT partner

buying relationships. Enterprise security policy is focusing on alignment with and deploy-
ment over the worldwide IP network and IT storage infrastructure.
One important aspect to successful partnerships is having some resident support exper-
tise in the basic technologies behind networking and storage.This is a major credibility
factor in securing a revenue-generating partnership in phase one. However, far too many
organizations ignore the initial phase of hiring resident expertise in the physical or IT disci-
pline to provide the needed experience required for successful third-party collaboration.This
is a fundamental lack of understanding of the mutual beneﬁt behind successful partnering.
Collaboration is more than sharing industry expertise. It is the equal distribution of resources
dedicated to bringing in the business. If your initial attempts to recruit meaningful partner-
ships expose a lack of resource commitment, it is a direct reﬂection upon a lack of genuine
interest on the part of your executive management. Convergence success requires leadership
and commitment to new markets and new resources.At the end of the day, strategic partner-
ships will provide the opportunity for large enterprise deployments of security solutions.This
increases the visibility of security and brings the value of security convergence into clear
focus for the senior management of the company.
We care about security convergence because it represents a huge market opportunity in
a critical area that is virtually untapped in regard to leveraging information technology across
wide area networks (WANs).The physical security industry is currently transitioning from a
historically analog infrastructure to the new IT infrastructure based on IP.As the earlier cell
phone example illustrates, we are just in the beginning stages of understanding how pow-
erful, miniature computing devices, mass-deployed and hosting new and yet-to-be-invented
solutions, will be deployed. It is a truly exciting time to be at this apex of security conver-
gence—perhaps just in time to secure people, property, and assets from the increasing threats
of fraud, violence, and terrorism being confronted on a global scale.
In general, security convergence plays to the strengths of the IT industry: buying rela-
tionships, infrastructure understanding, faster product development cycles, better sales organi-
zations, and innovation embedded into a corporate culture.Technical convergence has an
established track record across most of the internal departments in the corporation.Although
these statements point to deﬁnitive advantages of IT as an industry and department within a
corporation, one fact is clear: Security can turn to these inherent advantages to leverage and
accelerate security policy across the organization.
Just as the buying requirements for security solutions are changing from independent
departmental installation(s) and/or standalone (silo) island mentalities, the actual number of
vendors combining to answer enterprise requirements is increasing. Cross-industry partner-
ships and merger and acquisition activity are becoming normal operating procedure for
companies that want to quickly capitalize on security convergence. Examples of these funda-
mental “channel changes” are occurring every month and have been accelerating throughout
the 2006 calendar year. Signiﬁcant industry changes will continue as major IT vendors
pursue opportunities in the security market. Large physical security manufacturers and inte-
grators will need to quickly adjust go-to market strategies and product plans in order to
compete against new IT-centric competitors.The convergence of video-based solutions over

IP networks running data and voice applications is expanding the requirements for band-
width, storage, and integration services.
These primary business drivers are the focus of continued entry into the traditional
physical security market by IT vendors and their sales channels.The IT market’s historic ten-
dency toward centralizing enterprise solution and support models will fundamentally alter
both security installations (physical and logical) and buying requirements. Examples of com-
petitive positioning to address these new market opportunities have been accelerating
throughout the 2006 calendar year. For example, these headlines occurred between April 17
and April 21, 2006 and appear here exactly as they appeared in the press.They are in no par-
ticular order of importance, but they all have an impact on the security industry:
“Cisco to invest US $16 million in Video-Encryption Company WideVine
Technologies”
“GE Security selects Sun Identity Management Suite to deliver combined
IT/Physical access solution; OEM relationship to deliver seamless security solution
for Fortune 100 companies and Department of Defense”
“Tech Data U.S. Helps IT Resellers Break into Physical Security; Physical Security
SBU Established and Leading Manufacturers Signed”
“Big Brother Goes Digital” (industry cover story)
Let’s review:
■
A major IT gorilla, Cisco, continues to buy leading-edge technology ﬁrms in the
sweet spot of the physical security market.This trend continues.
■
A former, yet still formidable, IT gorilla, Sun Microsystems, is partnering with a
major physical security provider, GE Security, to establish OEM ties and sell solu-
tions through mutual channels to Fortune 100 and large government agency
accounts.
■
One of the largest IT distributors worldwide, with a $20-plus billion business and
more than 90,000 customers, has established a security convergence business unit
(SBU) to assist IT integrators in selling physical security products.
■
The cover story in VARBusiness (a leading publication for IT value added resellers)
warns its large IT integrator subscriber base not to miss the new and growing
opportunities that security convergence offers their businesses.
Although one week in April 2006 was a good indicator of vendor activity around secu-
rity convergence, it was hardly vacation time during the summer months:
■
In August, L1 Identity Solutions was established as a business entity resulting from
the combined acquisitions of biometric software players Viisage Technology,
Identix Inc., Integrated Biometric Technologies, SecuriMetrics, and Iridian. L1
Solutions has a market cap of approximately $1 billion.

■
Also in August, IBM announced a $1.3 billion acquisition of Internet Security
Systems Inc. (ISS), a publicly held ﬁrm based in Atlanta. ISS products protect
against Internet threats aimed at networks, desktops, and servers and are installed in
more than 11,000 worldwide companies and governments.This purchase effec-
tively launches the Global Services Security Division into the managed security
services business.
■
In September, EMC Corp. completed the purchase of RSA Security for $2.1 bil-
lion and announced a $150 million acquisition of Network Intelligence. EMC’s
chairman, president, and CEO, Joe Tucci, announced,“The additions of RSA and
Network Intelligence to the EMC family enable us to execute on our informa-
tioncentric security strategy to help organizations around the world secure their
information throughout [their] product life cycle and reduce the associated cost of
regulatory compliance.”
■
Finally, as we enter fall 2006, Siemens Building Technologies decided to get into
the act as well. It purchased VistaScape Security Systems, a leading developer of
automated video analytic technology software designed to protect critical infras-
tructure from a broad spectrum of threats.Terms of the deal were not disclosed,
but the strategic intent is obvious.
What the headlines reﬂect on a continuous basis is an industry convergence between
physical security and IT that is simultaneously changing the competitive landscape. New
roles and responsibilities within major corporations are changing the traditional purchasing
cycles for security products and impacting vendor-selling relationships.A new era of collabo-
ration is accelerating the trend in cross-industry partnering.
In addition to this, an active merger and acquisition cycle is evident in the physical/log-
ical security industry.As Dennis Moriarty, senior vice president for Diebold’s Security
Division, states,“The new formula is to purchase for expertise, not simply scale.”
All of this change points to a need for substantially upgrading to new skill sets across
organizations within both industries to accelerate deployment of a consistent security policy
across the enterprise.Although cultural differences between physical security and IT con-
tinue to exist, executive management demands cooperation in providing a cost-effective
security solution.This fact is not lost on either department. Whether the solution is video
surveillance, access control, or the broader area of enterprise security management, security
solutions now cross multiple corporate departments and require collaboration.The career-
limiting decision for department heads now is not collaborating. With the merging of busi-
ness interests (and budgets) among the traditional security organization, IT, ﬁnance, and just
about every department in the company with a security concern, the ability to promote
cooperation and mutual interest is a key management talent. By demonstrating an under-
standing of the larger security issues facing the overall business and detailing a compelling
ROI, a security policy can become a value add to the corporation.

Chapter 3 • Security Convergence: What Is It Anyway?

The age-old problem with this model is that the centerpiece of the strategy is change.
History tells us that organizations steadily and sometimes staunchly oppose anything new. In
this business environment, your executive leadership and middle management win the busi-
ness battle. In the era of security convergence, the winners recognize industry change early
and execute new strategies quickly.This new era in the security market is occurring during
an unprecedented combination of advancements in technology and a continuous global
focus on world events which are altering the traditional deﬁnitions of corporate risk.The
early stages of the twenty-ﬁrst century are positioning security as a priority issue for govern-
ment agencies, commercial enterprises, and individuals alike.
Summary
Today the world faces what James Canton, Ph.D., CEO and chairman of the Institute for
Global Futures, refers to as “an era of extreme threat.” He states,“An entirely new deﬁnition
of risk is emerging, made up of a totality of threat factors, from collaborative global networks
of terrorists and organized criminals, to cyber attacks and identity thefts.” His conclusion is
that the “smart technologies” such as video analytics, biometrics, nanotechnology, and mobile
robotics will play a vital role in securing the future. It appears that the convergence of phys-
ical and logical security is only in phase one.The only constant will be change in the secu-
rity industry.
This is essentially a new state of security where organizations must prepare against the
real possibility of a major terrorist attack against our country and economy (read supply
chains) while simultaneously our traditional risks to people and assets (physical and digital)
are rapidly increasing. Our security risk is compounding annually. It is against this backdrop
that security convergence is critical.The problem is that the physical security and IT indus-
tries are not collaborating to bring the best security solutions to market as quickly as pos-
sible.As large security initiatives move from big government projects (smart cards) to large
commercial enterprises, leading-edge vendors see convergence offering huge opportunities.
This means partnering to combine skill sets. It also means IP takes center stage because the
fastest way toward mass security solution deployments is over a common worldwide net-
working infrastructure.
As ASIS concluded in the Convergence of Enterprise Security Organization’s report
(November 2005):The increasing focus on security from an enterprise perspective has led to
a new way of examining risks that institutions face as a whole.This, in turn, is leading to
innovative approaches that emphasize integration—speciﬁcally, the integration of the risk
side of business into the strategic planning side in a consistent and holistic manner.The sur-
veys and interviews presented clear evidence that as leaders in the business, security profes-
sionals need to move from a “command and control” people model to an empowering and
enabling model, and develop an enterprisewide view of risk rather than an asset-based view.
In attempting to deﬁne security convergence, we have essentially opened the proverbial
“can of worms.”The deﬁnition does not ﬁt into one easy sentence or clean paragraph. On

the one hand, security and convergence both have long-established histories, and yet this
new era of “extreme risk” changes the timing of how we prepare and respond to these new
global challenges. In order to keep pace with these threats, whether they result from
internal/external hackers, traditional retail theft, acts of nature, or deliberate terrorist attacks
against our citizens and economy, the new order of the day is an accelerated security risk
policy across the organization and outward to trusted partners and suppliers. Security con-
vergence requires a baseline of communication and agreement within all of the organization
for a shared responsibility to the concept of defense.
New corporate organizational charts are being created as security policy becomes the
issue of the day for executive staff and shareholders alike. Leading-edge security technologies
migrate from government-funded defense agencies and their integration channels partners, as
well as presidential directives, into the commercial marketplace where signiﬁcant installations
are pending.This creates a competitive advantage for commercial organizations worldwide as
security policy across the enterprise is positioned as a measurable business value.
The answer to the question “what is security convergence?” may ultimately be as per-
sonal as your sense of security. But one thing is certain: It is not business as usual in the secu-
rity industry moving forward.The physical security community needs to accelerate its
embrace of enterprise technologies from IP networking to mass storage strategies and all the
solutions in between.The security software vendors need to streamline application deploy-
ments and provide better interoperability and management tools to improve administration
support across enterprise networks.The new threat landscape envelopes the entire corpora-
tion and its third-party partner networks. Finally, the people factor is the most critical ingre-
dient to success.The new era of securing an enterprise and establishing trusted external
relationships requires collaboration, innovative thinking, and above all, leadership. New cor-
porate structures to support new business models will mean new skill sets and new thinking.
All of this revolves around cultural change within the organizations that will ultimately win
in the age of security convergence.
Just as network technology spans the global workforce today, security convergence will
expand to involve numerous stakeholders worldwide with various levels of security involve-
ment from executive decision makers, to partners and customers, and eventually impacting
shareholder decisions.Technical convergence will propel enterprise security into a leadership
role in the years ahead.This is an exciting time for security practitioners and IT professionals
alike, as they create new solutions to answer new challenges.

Introduction
We have discussed security convergence in terms of tracing the need for physical security
through successive generations of history as it was inﬂuenced by the introduction of new
technologies, primarily in the form of weapons systems and countermeasures to those sys-
tems. We also discussed the recent history of the physical security markets’ integration with
information technologies and how that trend is changing the nature of security deployments,
within global organizations, educational institutions, and government agencies. In later chap-
ters we will explore the evolution of enterprise security policy aligned within the IT infras-
tructure and strategic to the overall business goals of the organization.
In order to effectively position physical security for the next step in its evolution, we
must currently review the initial challenges confronting an effective security convergence
policy and how new innovations and change impact traditional organizations. Key among
these issues is the technical and procedural implementations of the security policy. Equally
important, a review of the societal considerations reﬂected in new security and intelligence
agency policies must be clearly understood to position the impact of security convergence
within the broader context of how societies will live in the twenty-ﬁrst century when tech-
nology can increasingly document our daily activities. Speciﬁc challenges to be discussed
include:
■
Understanding the challenges inherent in the original Internet design specs
■
The ramiﬁcations of uncontrolled Internet growth and its effect on administration
policy
■
The security issues involved with the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP)
■
Why the evolution of the Internet as a global platform for security solutions is
expanding aggressively to accommodate convergence
The challenges surrounding convergence are occurring at a both a technical and a per-
sonal level.The function of “security” is only one discipline that is being profoundly impacted
by the rapid evolution of converging technologies.The capacity of network bandwidth and
increasing transfer speeds to accommodate voice, video, and data capabilities and provide the
interface to modern-day sensors and global positioning systems (GPSes) within an open sys-
tems framework is a perfect storm of systems-based interoperability and innovation.
Maturing and advancing technical capabilities impact literally every function within a
global operation. Security, certainly from a physical perspective, is one of the ﬁnal core func-
tions of an organization to automate. Once the actual technical change occurs, the process of
business or “operational” transformation is well underway.At this point, the change has
gained momentum, and like the capitalist genie being released from the communist bottle, it
has passed the point of no return regardless of the problems to be encountered along the
way.This inﬂection point within the security industry has been reached, and the traditional

Chapter 4 • The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence

command-and-control infrastructures have embraced collaborative processes, open standards,
and globalization.
A new corporate security executive is evolving to meet these new dynamics. Security as
a profession is gaining inﬂuence across the corporation, and is extending externally to busi-
ness partners and impacting global supply chains, the lifeblood of many organizations. In this
example, convergence is ﬁrst and foremost a systems and technical platform issue between
physical security processes and IT.There is not a “convergence,” or merging, per se, of phys-
ical security and IT job functions.The role of security is taking on added importance at the
highest levels of the enterprise, and as such it is being evaluated for its contribution to
bottom-line business operations.
At the same time a politic dynamic enters the mix as IT professionals position their
organizations to take physical security responsibilities if they avail themselves.After all, inﬂu-
ence at the senior executive levels translates into increased budgets, responsibilities, and
power.The IT department in general has already mutated from the glass-house “geek-
speaking outcasts” of earlier decades into current-day “business enablers” at the executive
level. Once upon a time, corporate executives had no idea what to make of the IT depart-
ment or how to talk to them.Today IT is a critical element in the overall operation and val-
uation model of a company. In the future, security could well be in a similar position as the
ability to secure the electronic and physical assets of a corporation and its supply chain take
on added business value.The evolution is moving from security as a cost of doing business,
to an added value to the global business process.As evidenced by the direction of software
development and business processes, internal and external security collaboration and global
communications are the benchmarks for success.
Technology History: 
Uncontrolled Internet Growth
Everything and everybody has a history. One peculiar thing is that history, aside from
repeating itself, has numerous examples of technical innovations that changed the world, but
had little in common with the original design speciﬁcations.
The evolution of the Internet appears to be a perfect example of this historical trend.A
technology that eventually united billions of people in a global collaboration to search for
unstructured data regarding everything imaginable was originally intended as an exercise in
network survivability for defense purposes and later functioned as a dedicated (and basically
private) network to provide shared research among university scholars. Vincent Cerf, an
American computer scientist known as one of the founding fathers of the Internet, describes
the early efforts:
The simple story is that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
started to explore the use of computers in what they called “com-
mand and control,” which was really about multiple computers and
how to connect them. The obvious intention was to develop an inte-

grated military communications system, which would represent a
distinct battleﬁeld or even strategic missile delivery advantage for
America. We had no idea that this would turn into a global and
public infrastructure. 
So much for the original plan. It is interesting to note that today’s Internet2 consortium is
getting back to its original roots.The Web site (www.internet2.edu) describes itself as follows:
Internet2 is the foremost U.S. advanced networking consortium. Led
by the research and education community since 1996, Internet2 pro-
motes the missions of its members by providing both leading-edge
network capabilities and unique partnership opportunities that
together facilitate the development, deployment, and use of revolu-
tionary Internet technologies. 
By bringing research and academia together with technology leaders from industry, gov-
ernment, and the international community, Internet2 promotes collaboration and innovation
that has a fundamental impact on the future of the Internet. It is also an exclusive and mostly
limited club, a not-for-proﬁt advanced networking consortium comprising more than 200
U.S. universities in cooperation with 70 leading corporations, 45 government agencies, labo-
ratories, and other institutions of higher learning, as well as more than 50 international
partner organizations.
Gregory Gromov tracks the history of the Internet and the World Wide Web in The
Roads and Crossroads of Internet History, and states,“The Atlantic cable of 1858 and Sputnik of
1957 were two basic milestones of the Internet prehistory.”The Atlantic cable of 1858 was
established to carry instantaneous communications across the ocean for the ﬁrst time.
Although the laying of this ﬁrst cable was seen as a landmark event in society, it was a tech-
nical failure. It remained in service for only a few days. Subsequent cables laid in 1866 were
completely successful and compare to events such as the moon landing of a century later...
the cable ... remained in use for almost 100 years.
Another visionary breakthrough involved President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he saw
the need for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) after the Soviet Union’s 1957
launch of Sputnik, a series of unmanned space missions.The organization united some of
America’s most brilliant people, who developed the United States’ ﬁrst successful satellite in
18 months. Several years later,ARPA began to focus on computer networking and commu-
nications technology.ARPANET was the predecessor to the Internet, later established by the
DoD.As history has shown,“if you build it, they will come.”And in the case of the Internet,
it will continue to develop and deploy more bandwidth-intensive applications over it. With
Internet usage exploding across a medium that was not originally designed to handle this
massive global workload, Internet2 is a good idea and, some would argue, overdue.The con-
vergence of voice, data, and especially video is driving the capacity issue from both a net-
work bandwidth and a storage perspective.

Notes from the Underground…
A Brief History of the Internet: 
Understanding a Global Security Network
The Internet Society provides a detailed account, “A Brief History of the
Internet,” on its Web site, www.isoc.org. The ﬁrst recorded description of the
social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of
memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT, in August 1962, discussing his Galactic
Network concept. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers
through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. 
In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider
was the ﬁrst head of the computer research program at the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), starting in October 1962. The original
ARPANET grew into the Internet and was based on the idea that there would
be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning with
ARPANET as the pioneering packet switching network, but soon to include
packet satellite networks, ground-based packet radio, and other networks.
The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. The Internet (originally
known as ARPANET) began its life in 1969. By 1973, the ﬁrst international con-
nections to ARPANET were made. In 1982, the earliest deﬁnitions of an
Internet as an interconnected network of networks began to appear, along
with the establishment of a standard network protocol suite to support inter-
networking communications. This protocol suite, composed of an Internet
Protocol (IP) and a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), became widely known
as TCP/IP, which still forms the foundation of network communications on
today’s Internet. 
In December 1988, as a direct result of the ﬁrst major computer security
incident on the Internet (the Morris Worm in November 1988), DARPA founded
the CERT Coordination Center (then known as the Computer Emergency
Response Team) to provide a central place for coordinated responses to
Internet cyber attacks. Today, the Internet is an interconnected network of net-
works composed of approximately 150 million hosts worldwide. The number of
computer security incidents handled by the CERT Coordination Center
(CERT/CC) has grown from six in 1988, to 52,658 in 2001. By the end of
September 2002, the CERT/CC had already seen more than 73,000 incidents.
And yet, despite serious security shortcomings, TCP/IP is still the standard pro-
tocol suite for network communications on the Internet, greatly limiting our
ability to track and trace Internet cyber attacks to their source.

According to Brian Pfaffenberger in his book Building a Strategic Extranet (IDG Books):
Much of the security woes of e-business channels can be attributed
to the inherent shortcomings of TCP/IP, the underlying Internet pro-
tocol. The TCP/IP designers worked in low-security academic research
environments. TCP/IP was developed for use with the ARPANET, the
predecessor of the Internet. When TCP/IP was developed, security
was not a major concern. The designers were interested mostly in
developing an operating system that would be compatible across
heterogeneous platforms but they were also charged with creating
computing environments in which information could be freely shared
without unnecessary restrictions. The Internet protocol suite, known
as TCP/IP, was designed in low-security academic research environ-
ments in California and Massachusetts. In the early days (the sixties),
university computer departments provided a congenial environment
where creativity ﬂourished; openness and consideration for others
were considered the norm. In this environment, some users consid-
ered security restrictions undesirable, because they reduced accessi-
bility to freely shared data—the hallmark of the community in those
days. Security restrictions make it more difﬁcult to access data.
IP is a data-oriented protocol used for communicating data across a packet-switched
internetwork. IP is a network-layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite and is encapsu-
lated in a data link layer protocol (e.g., Ethernet).As a lower-layer protocol, IP provides the
service of communicable, unique, global addressing among computers.The Internet protocol
suite is the set of communication protocols that implements the protocol stack on which the
Internet and many commercial networks run. It is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, con-
sisting of TCP and IP, which were also the ﬁrst two networking protocols deﬁned (according
to Wikipedia).
The Internet protocol suite—like many protocol suites—can be viewed as a set of layers.
Each layer solves a set of problems involving the transmission of data, and provides a well-
deﬁned service to the upper-layer protocols based on using services from some lower layers.
Upper layers are logically closer to the user and deal with more abstract data, relying on
lower-layer protocols to translate data into forms that can eventually be physically trans-
mitted.The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes a ﬁxed, seven-layer stack
for networking protocols. Comparisons between the OSI model and TCP/IP can give fur-
ther insight into the signiﬁcance of the components of the IP suite.The OSI model with its
increased number of layers provides for more ﬂexibility. Both the OSI and the TCP/IP
models are “standards,” and application developers will often implement solutions without
strict adherence to proposed “division” of labor within the standard while providing for
functionality within the application suite.This separation of “practice” from theory often
leads to confusion.

The Evolution of the Internet: The 
Initial Transfer of Military Technology
The evolution of the Internet protocol suite came from work done by DARPA in the early
1970s. In 1972, Robert E. Kahn was hired at the DARPA Information Processing
Technology Ofﬁce, where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based
radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across them.
In spring 1973, Vinton Cerf, the developer of the existing ARPANET Network Control
Program (NCP) protocol, joined Kahn to work on open-architecture interconnection
models with the goal of designing the next protocol for ARPANET.
With the role of the network reduced to the bare minimum, it became possible to join
almost any networks together, no matter what their characteristics were.A computer called a
gateway (later changed to router to avoid confusion with other types of gateways) is pro-
vided with an interface to each network, and forwards packets back and forth between them.
DARPA then contracted with BBN Technologies, Stanford University, and University
College London to develop operational versions of the protocol on different hardware plat-
forms. Four versions were developed:TCP v1,TCP v2, a split into TCP v3 and IP v3 in the
spring of 1978, and then stability with TCP/IP v4—the standard protocol still in use on the
Internet today.
In 1975, a two-network TCP/IP communications test was performed between Stanford
and University College London. In November 1977, a three-network TCP/IP test was con-
ducted between the U.S., UK, and Norway. Between 1978 and 1983, several other TCP/IP
prototypes were developed at multiple research centers.A full switchover to TCP/IP on
ARPANET took place January 1, 1983. In March 1982, the DoD made TCP/IP the stan-
dard for all military computer networking. In 1985, the Internet Architecture Board held a
three-day workshop on TCP/IP for the computer industry, attended by 250 vendor repre-
sentatives, helping popularize the protocol and leading to its increasing commercial use. On
November 9, 2005, Kahn and Cerf were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom
for their contribution to American culture.
Notes from the Underground…
Internet History: Vincent Cerf
Vincent Cerf, an American computer scientist known as one of the founding
fathers of the Internet, describes the early efforts:
“The simple story is that the DoD started to explore the use of computers
in what they called ‘command and control,’ which was really about multiple

computers and how to connect them. The obvious intention was to develop an
integrated military communications system, which would represent a distinct
battleﬁeld or even strategic missile delivery advantage for America. We had
no idea that this would turn into a global and public infrastructure.
“In the earliest days, this was a project I worked on with great passion
because I wanted to solve the Defense Department’s problem: It did not want
proprietary networking and it didn’t want to be conﬁned to a single network
technology. As the system expanded into academic space, it was increasingly
useful and I hoped it could be made available much more widely.
“Then, by 1992, legislation was passed that permitted commercial trafﬁc
to ﬂow on the NSFNET backbone.” The Ethernet had already come out of
Xerox PARC, which was an important development. “Next came Tim Berners-
Lee’s creation of the World Wide Web; Marc Andreessen and the Mosaic ver-
sion of the World Wide Web at the University of Illinois; and ﬁnally, the
Netscape Communications IPO … the Internet became a public phenomenon.
“The Internet was conceived in 1973, born in 1983, and emerged to the
public in 1993. VoIP [Voice over Internet Protocol] got ‘real’ in 2003. I can
hardly wait for 2013 ...”
One trend that could be added to the preceding timeline statement is the emergence of
security convergence in 2007–2010.The security convergence model accelerates the combi-
nation of voice, video, and data over IP to create entirely new application classes. However,
these advancements will create heretofore unprecedented performance demands on the
Internet, a communications medium that is struggling under present workloads, and was
never originally designed for its historical growth rates.Additionally, the current and future
application development cycles promote global collaboration, introducing new clients and
data sources to corporate networks, and increasing the risk of external cyber attack and
internal corruption.The need for trusted and veriﬁed relationships will increase in tandem
with Internet utilization rates to secure global business transactions. Enterprise security poli-
cies will be aggressively deployed and additional infrastructure added.The ability to secure
and effectively manage the worldwide popularity and growth rate of the Internet will be a
major challenge.
Internet Productivity
How do you put a dollar amount on Internet productivity? Honestly, what does the ability
to connect to work and communicate anytime and anywhere buy you from a productivity
standpoint? Sure, there will always be detractors that tell you “all work and no play make
Jack a dull boy,” but is there a ﬁnancial ﬁgure that someone can work up on you that calcu-
lates how much more productive you are every year through interfacing with technology?
Or is it like a sense of security in that you know it when you feel it?

There is little doubt that our technology society has its downside—even dangers—but
think for a moment where we would be without it.Typewriters and carbon paper? Drafting
tables and two-dimensional design work? Manual accounting ledgers? It is obvious that there
is no turning back on technical advancements, regardless of the risks involved.There are
many examples of corporations touting the ﬁnancial beneﬁts associated with automating
manual tasks. General Electric is on record as stating that automating travel and expense
reporting saves the company 30 percent annually. Cisco Systems is rolling out its own tech-
nology of video conferencing over IP networks internally as a case study of cost savings and
innovation.“Telepresence is my favorite new technology. It will save me $140 million off our
run rate on travel next year,” said CEO John Chambers, in his talk at the Cisco C-Scape
Conference. Cisco is rolling out the technology to 120 sites in 2007.“It will change the way
we collaborate and allow us to communicate as effectively as being in the same room.”
Of course, Cisco is a huge global organization to realize this ﬁnancial beneﬁt from
implementing video conferencing technology to avoid the expenses associated with business
travel, but it points to the return on investment (ROI) capabilities of real-time video, voice,
and data technologies developed to leverage real-time global collaboration. It is the way the
new world of business works, and more “telepresence” type solutions are being developed
everyday by people that grew up collaborating through gaming software experiences.
Aside from working productivity models, this same software and conferencing capability
can be used to save lives in the medical industry. Imagine the accelerated use of online col-
laboration for doctors’ ofﬁce examinations. Perhaps this would result in additional cost-effec-
tive virtual visits providing an improved ability to prevent illness and/or disease in patients.
The ability for medical experts to view patient images and records from remote sites and
collaborate with colleagues in real time across the globe will certainly have a positive impact
on the practice of advanced medicine.
The next generation of military technologies will be reviewed in a later chapter.
However, sufﬁce it to say that the full features of the Internet and Web-based interfaces will
be employed to protect soldiers and improve their operational effectiveness. In virtually every
imaginable scenario, the use of the Internet for “anytime and anywhere” information access
and real-time collaboration is having a positive impact on the productivity levels of individ-
uals and organizations.
However, as we have witnessed and will experience again, the technology is not ﬂawless
and produces reminders of how dependent people and societies have become on its everyday
usage. Power interruptions, extended blackouts, hacking incidents, and natural disasters have
all demonstrated our functional dependency upon the “electronic age.” Many people warn of
serious ramiﬁcations to society if the appropriate preparations are not in place to mitigate
possible risk scenarios. Unfortunately, in many cases it is not until the full impact of a disaster
is felt that people and organizations respond with actions that would have proven timely if
initiated in advance.
“Sooner or later, we sit down to a banquet of consequences.”
—Robert Louis Stevenson (1885).

Greg Garcia, assistant secretary of homeland security, looks at Internet security issues for
a living.“Having our information and communications traveling through the same pipe
introduces efﬁciencies for enterprise management, cost savings, productivity, a panoply of
features.This is the next-generation network, but with that comes more vulnerability. We
need to be clearly aware of what those vulnerabilities are and take steps now as we build out
this little architecture, (and) build in more security as we go”.
As mentioned earlier, one issue with the Internet as it regards security is the fact that it
was never originally intended to host so many global connections.The ability to scale and
secure cyberspace has been one step behind the demand almost from its inception to the
present day.A DARPA (DoD) sponsored report titled “New Arch: Future Generation
Internet Architecture,” states that the original design of the Internet has been described as
transparent: What goes in comes out.The Net does not observe, ﬁlter, or transform the data
it carries; it is oblivious to the content of packets.
This transparency may have been the single most important factor in the success of the
Internet, because transparency makes it possible to deploy a new application without having
to change the core of the network. On the other hand, transparency also facilitates the
delivery of security attacks, viruses, and other unwelcome data. When the network was small
and there was a high degree of trust and shared context among users, the power of trans-
parency outweighed its risk.Today, with a world of users that mistrust each other, devices
such as ﬁrewalls are deployed with the explicit goal of disrupting transparency by blocking
unknown trafﬁc.
Garcia continues,“Globalization is great and, just (like) convergence of networks, global-
ization introduces new efﬁciencies and economies of scale. However, there are risks involved
with that, because the more you distribute your design, your manufacturing, your packaging,
your shipping, the more there are opportunities for vulnerabilities to be introduced.A lot of
the malicious hackers are outside of the United States.” Couple this fact with the increase of
internal hacking activities within global corporations and the risk levels rise exponentially
across global business practices and supply chains. When you migrate increasingly critical
applications supporting multifunctional capabilities such as voice and video onto the
Internet, despite shortcomings in computer and network security, the need for proactive
administration is required.
It is increasingly important to understand the role that the Internet plays in the global
deployment of new security applications and the requirement for video over IP in those
solutions. Internet2 may provide a model for the eventual segmentation of Internet deploy-
ments.The management of growth and administration of global security policy is at the core
of realizing the potential of the Internet.The Internet is one of the most important technical
advances know to man, and yet few people take the time to understand its origins and
potential negative implications to society if it is not managed effectively and secured prop-
erly. We run the global risk of being victims of our own Internet success.

Administration, Process, and Procedures:
Management in the Internet Age 
Securing the Internet is an unbelievably difﬁcult and somewhat impossible task. However,
the basic fundamentals of physical security can apply to the problem at hand.There is the
concept of walls (ﬁrewalls in this case) to physically (or electronically) keep unwanted visitors
out. Next, if people are going to enter these walls, we want to know who they are.And if
they are allowed to enter, we want to manage and monitor whatever privileges they have
once inside our domain. We have to be able to ascertain exactly what is happening, by
whom, and when so that we can clearly assess the environment based upon the potential
risks involved and make appropriate adjustments.
The four phases of security administration involve authentication, authorization, admin-
istration, and auditing.Technology has certainly improved on the totality of the process and
in doing so has created many of the societal concerns around privacy which we will discuss
later in this chapter. Historically, the guard, or night watchman, provided the human element
of surveillance.This activity was later augmented by the “basic” video surveillance camera,
which in turn integrated more intelligent analytical features in software to recognize anoma-
lies and provide automated alerts to a physical guard.Today, we see the emergence of enter-
prise security command and control software platforms to categorize procedural thinking for
the guards and step them through any number of possible scenarios from the mundane to
emergency situations.
Although this is an example of a physical security process being converged over IT
infrastructure and automating one of the oldest procedures in the security ﬁeld, many others
exist as well. Electronic security of information is a ﬁeld that is exploding in its attempt to
keep pace with an international and, in some cases, organized hacker threat to global com-
merce. Securing business operations in the Internet age becomes increasingly more difﬁcult
everyday. Historically, the majority of security expenditures were deployed on the perimeter
to protect from outside penetrations into the corporate network.Although a large global
user base is less trustworthy and prompts additional cyber attacks, in fact today the majority
of problems are the result of internally authorized users who can represent even greater
potential ﬁnancial losses to an organization.
Companies such as ArcSight are coming to market with innovative products designed to
combat the growing threat to corporations from organized insider activities.Additional soft-
ware designed to protect data at rest and signal abnormalities in internal usage is also proving
effective in deterring organized criminal activity and individual theft.“The rapid prolifera-
tion of corporate information inside the business only serves to exacerbate the situation and
is forcing businesses to take a long, hard look at how they handle information security,” says
Sophie Louvel, an analyst with market research company IDC.
The new environment of information risk involves blended threats that utilize multiple
methods and techniques to transmit and spread an attack on multiple computer systems and
networks. Conventional antivirus solutions aren’t stopping blended threats in time, leading to
www.syngress.com
The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence • Chapter 4
103

massive viral infections across entire networks.Today, blended security threats represent the
greatest risk to information security since the ﬁrst computer virus 20 years ago. Most
blended threats can be spread automatically and by a number of methods to exploit
numerous network and system vulnerabilities. What makes matters worse is that many times,
these attacks are invisible to existing security defenses. Various sources cite many existing
trends, indicating the threat regarding commercial cybersecurity:
■
According to Government Accounting Ofﬁce (GAO) ﬁgures, spam makes up
more than 60 percent of all e-mail transactions and carries malicious code, viruses,
and fraudulent solicitations.
■
Eighty-nine percent of users found to have spyware on their systems were unaware
that it was there, according to the National Cyber Security Alliance and America
Online.
■
Direct phishing-related costs to U.S. banks and credit card issuers in 2003 were
estimated at $1.2 billion, according to Gartner Group.
■
Spyware is the fourth greatest threat to network security, accounting for up to 30
percent of all help desk calls today, according to IDC.
The GAO reports that there is a lack of awareness and coordination about cyber secu-
rity threats among government agencies: Only one of the 24 agencies interviewed by the
GAO identiﬁed the risk that spam presents for delivering phishing, spyware, and other threats
to systems and employees. Fourteen of the 24 agencies reported that phishing had limited or
no effect on their systems or operations. Five agencies said that spyware had a minimal effect
on their systems and operations.And 17 agencies admitted that they had not assessed the risk
that the agency name could be exploited in a phishing scam. In fact, INPUT research pre-
dicts that the federal government will spend $7.1 billion on cyber security in ﬁscal 2009, up
27 percent from the $5.6 billion for ﬁscal year 2005.
The GAO also reports that there is a general lack of awareness about the existing threat
of cyber attacks upon corporate information systems. It was interesting to note a speciﬁc
item in the GAO study stating that 18 percent of the respondents have not done a threat
assessment at all. For the purposes of implementing effective information security to protect
information behind the ﬁrewall, it is useful to distinguish between two different categories of
information: structured information, which includes ﬁnancial and customer data that is
stored in databases and business applications; and unstructured information, which includes
documents (both paper and electronic), e-mails, images, video, and instant messages.
Instant messaging and Web conferencing are also highlighted as threats as users latch on
to the potential of the Internet. More than 40 percent of UK users surveyed by Web security
specialist SmoothWall make private use of instant messaging while at work, and 61 percent
use private Hotmail accounts. For example, more than 33 percent of people questioned
knew of porn being downloaded in their organization and more than 30 percent said they
www.syngress.com
104
Chapter 4 • The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence

downloaded music at work, to company equipment. Well more than 20 percent spent more
than an hour a day of work time on nonwork Web surﬁng—via the company network.
Although this is not a direct or deliberate attack scenario, the potential to introduce
added risk from indirect sources over the Web is a reality. Emerging technology is shifting
the threat proﬁle. Wireless networking is extending network boundaries and VoIP telephony
is blurring the distinction between voice and data trafﬁc. Removable media devices, such as
Universal Serial Bus (USB) tokens and MP3 players, are making it easier for an insider to
take large volumes of data out of an organization.
Another study of Internet usage, by Gartner Inc., found that 65 percent of employees
use instant messaging in the workplace and suggests that public IM usage in the enterprise
will be ubiquitous by 2008.“This number will clearly rise as the IM-savvy next generation
enters the workforce,” Gartner analyst Peter Firstbrook wrote in a report.“IM is recognized
as a fast way to get co-workers’ attention, rapidly resolve issues/questions, and save telecom-
munications costs. However, uncontrolled IM usage, as with uncontrolled e-mail, is a recipe
for disaster for organizations. IM today is where e-mail was around 1995,” he said.“A lot of
IT departments haven’t ﬂagged it as a concern. If you don’t control IM use … there’s a
potential for loss of intellectual property.”
By 2009, nearly 100 percent of North American companies will have employees who
use IM. One of the problems associated with instant messaging is the fact that the communi-
cations are not encrypted and also bypass e-mail systems that have security software
deployed.According to Nemertes Research principal analyst and program director, Irwin
Lazar, IM also lacks a permanent record of communications, representing a compliance risk.
He added that using public IM could be a security threat. It can introduce worms, viruses,
and other malware into the network. On the other side of the coin, IT has very little control
over public IM usage, meaning it is highly probable that an end user could send out sensitive
data or corporate information via an IM session and never be caught.
Beneﬁts of Using Risk Management 
in Planning IT Security Administration
Although those who regard IT security as a beneﬁt to be measured are in the minority, IDC
believes that they are the vanguard of a swing in attitude.There are clear beneﬁts for those
companies that adopt a proactive and positive attitude to IT security, as the research
uncovers:
■
Better demonstration of IT security investment needs to the board
Many IT heads are using risk management as a means of securing critical invest-
ment in IT security. Without the risk assessment, it is hard to prove a case.
■
More meaningful demonstration of business risk management to
investors, especially the institutional investors that largely dictate stock
prices Risk relationship models can show the effect of IT security on brand
www.syngress.com
The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence • Chapter 4
105

value, customer loyalty, and, ultimately, revenue. Companies incorporating their IT
security policies in risk management reports show that they have made an effort
beyond the minimum required for IT security.This shows a mature, pragmatic, and
methodological approach to risk management and mitigation.
■
Better demonstration of business risk management to customers
Concerns over online fraud are a key barrier to the common acceptance of e-
commerce. Companies that were able to successfully communicate their online
security measures, though, have been able to exploit the Internet. One example of
this comes from the Swedish and Finnish ﬁnancial sectors. Over the past ﬁve years,
positive and proactive communication of the security of Internet banking services
saw a massive increase in use of this channel.This compares to other countries
where the IT security policy was not communicated, to the detriment of online
banking services.
■
Better employee awareness Employees are a critical area of IT security.
Opening e-mails containing viruses and losing remote access interfaces are the
major causes of potential security breaches. By deﬁning and communicating an
effective IT security policy, companies can ensure that their employees know the
IT risks they are exposed to, and can take measures to contribute to enforcement
of the IT security policy.
Many of the IDC recommendations can be applied to the concept and procedures of
the trusted enterprise, which will be detailed in depth in later chapters.This focus on ele-
vating security policy within the organization and outbound to partners and global supply
chains will actually result in an upgraded image for the entire security profession. It is the
merging of the security process with new innovations in IT that resides at the core of this
industry change.
Beyond the global corporate industrial complex and its concerns about protecting phys-
ical, electronic, and human assets lies the similar and extended concern of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), the DoD, and our nation’s intelligence agencies.
“Nation states potentially pose the greatest threat with regard to cyber security to the
United States,”Andrew Macpherson, director of UNH Justiceworks’Technical Analysis Group,
said in a prepared statement.“Clearly Russia and China are two of the top countries because
they have more developed capabilities, but it may not be in their interest to use cyber attacks
for strategic attacks ends. Both countries have worked on doctrine and there is some evidence
that they are incorporating it into their military training as well. However, individuals, political
groups, religious groups, and organized crime groups also pose ongoing risks and should be
considered cyber threats, as well.With approximately 85 percent of the cyber infrastructure
owned by the private sector, it’s not just a government problem,” he said.“There are increased
risks as computer networks become more integrated with all aspects of our lives and infras-
tructure.”This situation is not unique to the United States; many countries must deal with
similar situations and national rivalries, as well as global business organizations.

The Devos Summit on Cyber 
Terrorism: The Botnets Have Arrived
The World Economic Forum (www.weforum.org) is an independent international organiza-
tion committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to
shape global, regional, and industry agendas. Incorporated as a foundation in 1971 and based
in Geneva, the World Economic Forum is impartial and not-for-proﬁt; it is tied to no polit-
ical, partisan, or national interests.
The World Economic Forum is under the supervision of the Swiss federal government.
Not far from the minds of technology industry leaders at a recent event was the importance
of the global information infrastructure in the performance of their business operations.At a
recent event, the topic turned to the protection and security of information assets in the
global network infrastructure.A review of the comments and forecasts from some of the
world’s leading business and technology leaders can be quite sobering when the topic turns
to cyber terrorism. One reviewer at the conference mentioned that already, pirated copies of
the as-yet-unreleased Microsoft Vista operating system were already turning up in China.
Another point was made that experience showed that about 50 percent of all pirated
Windows programs came with Trojans preinstalled on them. Based on the increasing threat
of cyber attacks, Dell computer founder, Michael Dell, proposed the idea that the future
might bring “disposable virtual PCs,” accessed through the Internet, which would minimize
the threat of a persistent virus infection.
Hamadoun Toure, secretary general of the International Telecommunication Union,
pointed out that a solution to hacking had to be found to ensure the survival of the Web.
Toure said that whatever the solution, the ﬁght against botnets was a “war” that could be
won only if all parties—regulators, governments, telecom ﬁrms, computer users, and hard-
ware and software makers—worked together.
Wikipedia describes the term botnet as a jargon term for a collection of software robots,
or bots, which run autonomously.This can also refer to the network of computers using dis-
tributed computing software.Although the term botnet can be used to refer to any group of
bots, such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bots, the word is generally used to refer to a collec-
tion of compromised machines running programs, usually referred to as worms,Trojan
horses, or backdoors, under a common command-and-control infrastructure.A botnet’s orig-
inator (a.k.a. bot herder) can control the group remotely.
Botnets are made up of large numbers of computers that malicious hackers have brought
under their control after infecting them with so-called Trojan virus programs.Although most
owners are oblivious to the infection, the networks of tens of thousands of computers are
used to launch spam e-mail campaigns, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or online fraud
schemes. Criminals controlling millions of personal computers are threatening the Internet’s
future, experts have warned. Up to one-quarter of the computers on the Net may be used
by cyber criminals in so-called botnets, said Vincent Cerf, one of the fathers of the Internet,
www.syngress.com
The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence • Chapter 4

highlighted earlier in the chapter. Of the 600 million computers currently on the Internet,
between 100 million and 150 million were already part of these botnets, Cerf said.
Despite all that, the Net is still working, which is pretty amazing. It’s pretty resilient.
Technology writer John Markoff said, “It’s as bad as you can imagine; it puts the whole
Internet at risk.”The panel described the situation with growing alarm and likened it to an
“Internet pandemic.”The expert panel members were unsure about feasible solutions, even
though they identiﬁed operating systems and authentication as key issues.
DHS: The National 
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
DHS describes our nation’s critical infrastructures as being composed of public and private
institutions in the sectors of agriculture, food, water, public health, emergency services, gov-
ernment, defense industrial base, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation,
banking and ﬁnance, chemicals and hazardous materials, and postal and shipping. Cyberspace
is their nervous system—the control system of our country. Cyberspace is composed of hun-
dreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and ﬁber optic
cables that allow our critical infrastructures to work.Thus, the healthy functioning of
cyberspace is essential to our economy and our national security.
That functionality depends on trusted and veriﬁable global identities. Bill Gates,
chairman of Microsoft Corporation, at a recent security industry forum speciﬁed the need to
eliminate the weakest link in the computer security chain by getting rid of passwords. Gates
mentioned that Microsoft has the product strategy to supplant the password as a means of
verifying who’s who on computers and over the Internet.“Passwords are not only weak;
passwords have the huge problem that if you get more and more of them, the worse it is. We
think this is the milestone where enterprises should start the migration from passwords to
smart card.”
Securing the actual data is another important piece in the puzzle, and a disk drive
encryption feature in the higher-end version of Vista, as a way to lock down the data on a
PC, was also cited as an example of improving security. Gates also mentioned newly devel-
oped rights management systems to help control the ﬂow of conﬁdential data. For example,
companies can use such rights settings to limit who can forward or open certain e-mail mes-
sages, reducing the risk of data loss.Additionally, the industry is positioning IP version 6, the
next generation of the Internet protocol, and IPSec, a suite of protocols for securing IP
communications, as part of a global Internet security solution.These product categories are
not speciﬁc to Microsoft; the example is one of an industry icon recognized for his history
of technical breadth thinking about new answers to one of the most important global issues
facing society today.
Art Coviello, CEO of RSA Security (EMC Corporation), estimates that approximately
200,000 viruses are expected to be released worldwide this year, and that intrusion preven-
tion systems are catching only around 70 percent of attacks. He believes the industry should
www.syngress.com
108
Chapter 4 • The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence

focus more on ensuring that the most important data is kept properly secure through strong
encryption.This requires data to be properly tagged and stored. He stated,“Pattern-recogni-
tion systems could also be built into a company’s infrastructure, to detect and respond to sus-
picious behavior.This approach would require solid integration with storage and networking
products.”
John Thompson, CEO of Symantec, recognizes the need for new thinking in the ﬁght
to secure cyber space.“Accepting responsibility for the security of a device accessing your
network, when it’s not owned or managed by you, is a radically new concept in our world,”
Thompson said. But he urged vendors to take that step in enabling companies to deliver a
secure experience to end users, which include customers, partners, and suppliers.“Those that
embrace this approach will not only reduce their risks, but, I believe, they will also create a
competitive advantage for their companies.” Conﬁdence in the connected world will come
about only if information, the infrastructure, and interactions are secure and protected,
Thompson predicted.As a result, the role of a business’s security ofﬁcer needs to evolve into
one that focuses on IT risk management, he advised.This new role would call for identi-
fying, measuring, and developing strategies to weigh IT risks and returns.
The IT risk manager, for example, would examine stumbling blocks to the availability of
data, regulatory compliance, and overall business performance.“There is no doubt in my
mind that managing user identities is the most pressing challenge facing the industry today,”
Thompson said.An approach that focuses on the user, rather than on the technology, is what
is called for.“After all, the goal is to protect the user—regardless of the device they use,
online transaction they undertake, or threat they may face.”
The conference members also discussed the importance of IP-enabled physical security
systems to provide opportunities for new layers of identity conﬁrmation, as a means to
enhance an organization’s security. Increasingly, these devices are being connected to an IP
network for more efﬁcient command and control, while also taking advantage of reliable
power distribution from new Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) switches.
The security industry is going through a consolidation period that is expected to con-
tinue. Larger multinational security and IT manufacturers are continuously purchasing soft-
ware and security appliance manufacturers. Recently IBM, EMC, and Symantec all made
billion-dollar acquisitions in the space to add security functionality to their core product
offerings.The venture capital community is actively investing in startup ﬁrms providing the
latest and most innovative solutions to the issue of security commerce and identities across
the global Internet.ArcSight is an example of one new company offering enterprise security
and network information management software to consolidate large, complex security archi-
tectures that have been deployed independently and haphazardly across organizations over
time.These types of solutions answer a critical need to tie network and security data
together to make administration more manageable and, as a result, cost-effective.As the
Internet continues to grow and hackers proliferate, organizations must possess the ability to
quickly and accurately pinpoint and respond to threats with automated, policy-based actions.
Innovative thinking regarding proactive security technologies may be the only answer to
actually securing global commerce and, in many ways, our way of life.The only things that
www.syngress.com
The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence • Chapter 4
109

seem certain today regarding the World Wide Web are accelerated growth rates and
increasing Internet threats.
This is one fact you can take to the bank. Unlike another prediction little more than a
decade ago, when Bob Metcalf, founder of 3Com and inventor of the Ethernet, wrote in a
column that the Internet would collapse in 1996 due to a variety of things that would all
pile up and destroy it.A year later, he ate his column in a very public demonstration, admit-
ting he was wrong. Even visionary thinkers believe that the Internet will eventually exceed
its design limitations and suffer global outages. Predictions of Internet consequences, good
and bad, have been across the board as the Internet gained momentum and popularity
worldwide.Today, the basic concept is that the corporate network is the Internet, for better
or for worse.The threat to it is understood and industry is rapidly attempting to address it.
One additional prediction by Bob Metcalf, not quite so controversial and in no real
danger of having his words publicly eaten again, was that “The public Internet will more and
more be able to carry real-time video.”Although the ability to predict that video will play a
central role in Internet trafﬁc patterns of the future is not an issue, the surveillance capabili-
ties of the technology and its continued deployment in public certainly is a subject of con-
troversial opinions.The miniaturization of camera technology allows cost-effective (and
clandestine) placement of surveillance anywhere through wired and/or wireless networks.
Video, like voice and data that preceded it over IP, is another element of the Internet to be
managed and administered on a daily basis. In fact, the arrival of video data mining solutions
is coming aggressively to the forefront as a next-generation business opportunity.
Society and Surveillance
Like many of the innovations in policing, the credit for utilizing video camera systems
belongs to the English.As we will review in later chapters, Sir Robert Peel originated the
concept of organized police departments and Scotland Yard was one of the ﬁrst organizations
to use mug shot photos as identiﬁcation and later pioneered ﬁngerprinting. In 1960, the
metropolitan police ﬁrst deployed cameras in Trafalgar Square to monitor crowds, and fol-
lowed that, a year later, with initial installations in a London train station. In the early 1980s,
VHS technology was introduced and became the medium on which to record and monitor
daily activities, and closed circuit television (CCTV) became a powerful tool for watching
high-crime areas in retail stores and public areas.
Additional deployments and more usage across multiple market segments increased the
visibility of surveillance cameras as they were integrated into daily activities.The tracking of
automobiles and faces breeds controversy where civil liberties are concerned. For instance,
why should innocent people’s license plates and their driving patterns be subject to scrutiny?
Because we live in a world with the threat of terrorism, governments believe that improved
security will save lives.
Jay Stanley, an ACLU privacy coordinator, says,“We’re against turning our public spaces
into constantly monitored, constantly videotaped arenas where nobody has any privacy any-
more and is watched by the government every time they clean their ears.” In the future,
www.syngress.com

these groups will continue to serve as a counter-balancing force against any form of surveil-
lance which steps out of line, such as the use of video surveillance that targets only homeless
residents of a city.
Today various estimates place the number of video surveillance cameras in the range of
4.5 million within the United Kingdom. In fact, the consulting ﬁrm Frost & Sullivan notes
that by 2010, video surveillance cameras will be a $4.09 billion market. Moreover, in the city
of London, there are more than 500,000 security cameras, and video cameras have been in
use since the 1960s.The Wall Street Journal stated that a person could expect to be recorded
300 times a day in the city, according to one study. Former New York City Police
Commissioner, Howard Saﬁr, explained that most video is in private hands.“There are tens
of thousands of them (video surveillance cameras) in the city and the wide majority is pri-
vately owned.”
Who knows what the future will hold from a worldwide installation perspective as the
global IP network converges to host video applications. Digital video surveillance solutions
over IP with certainly spell the end for analog and stand-alone technologies, as the ability to
share multiple applications across a global network increases the number of surveillance
installations.
London has also been the subject of several high-proﬁle incidents where video surveil-
lance technology has proved invaluable to criminal investigations. One incident involved a
videotape of two teenagers leading a 2-year-old child away from a mall. He was later beaten
to death and the video convicted the boys.The worldwide repulsion was measurable. More
recently, the terrorist attacks on London’s subway system and a city bus in 2005 drew world
outrage.After the bombings, investigators reviewed well more than 6,000 CCTV tapes and
cracked a terrorist ring operation in the London suburb of Leeds.The quick police work
and use of the video surveillance network to track the terrorist cell prompted Australian
Prime Minister John Howard to say,“I think of all the things that I have taken out of
London, [and] none has been more powerful than the huge value of surveillance cameras.”
Other high-tech devices include the United Kingdom’s video surveillance tracking sys-
tems for cars with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, biometric tech-
nology, and improved digital CCTV systems that use GSM wireless technology.The Home
Ofﬁce wants the CCTV surveillance cameras to be in plain sight so that citizens know they
are being watched, as well as protected. Software is already in development to identify sui-
cidal behavior in train subways.Another innovation, called a millimeter wave scanner,
“listens” to the radio wave energy coming from a person and detects variations in density.
This allows it to reveal hidden objects, such as guns or bombs.This technology could even-
tually be integrated over an IP network with other security applications and databases being
monitored from one command and control center.
The beneﬁts of converging IT physical security are beginning to be realized and
migrating from military and commercial applications to law enforcement and security prac-
tices.The heavy investment made in IP-enabled enterprise networking, with its promise that
virtually anything can be distributed across it, is advancing the security convergence model,
increasing video surveillance installations, and generating debate over public privacy issues.

Chief information ofﬁcers (CIOs) will need to interact closely with security managers and
IT teams will implement additional security applications, such as live security video and
access control.
With IP voice, video, and data in place, the beneﬁts of a converged network are consid-
erable. Cost savings will be made through simpler maintenance, and the ease of centralizing
control from a number of locations to a single site.A CCTV camera connected directly to a
network enhances the ease of distribution of recorded video images across multiple locations.
As a result, digital video’s open-network architecture is actually its most valuable asset.The
infrastructure required to adopt this technology is indeed expensive; but unlike its analog
predecessors, this investment holds value for the entire enterprise and provides an ability to
scale and integrate new software functionality.This provides addition fuel to those positioned
against surveillance technologies that impede upon personal privacy.
There was, of course, no way of knowing whether you were being
watched at any given moment ... You had to live—did live, from
habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you
made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scru-
tinized.—George Orwell’s 1984.
Dr Stephen Graham of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne has suggested the “ﬁfth
utility,” after telephones, water, gas, and electricity.“These networks,” he writes,“have long
since merged and extended to become technologically standardized, multipurpose, nationally
regulated utilities, with virtually universal coverage. I would argue that CCTV looks set to
follow a similar pattern of development over the next 20 years, to become a kind of ﬁfth
utility.” In their book The Maximum Surveillance Society:The Rise of CCTV, academics Clive
Norris and Gary Armstrong write “The architecture of the maximum surveillance society is
now in place.”Their point is that the hardware of CCTV is so ﬁrmly in position that
enabling it to watch everybody all the time is now merely a software problem.
After the London terrorist bombings, authorities sought to reassure the public that no
effort would be spared to prevent further atrocities. For that to happen, however,“London
needs to move from after-the-event analysis to before-the-event anticipation,” says Neil Fisher,
director of security solutions at British defense contractor, QinetiQ.The technology exists.
Real-time video analysis in use at New Jersey Transit’s Secaucus Junction station is a
story about surveillance in its broadest sense. CSO magazine detailed that the real business
case for video surveillance is the beneﬁt from video surveillance of transit systems and busi-
ness operations producing better customer service.“It’s not [a question of],‘OK, we’re going
to put this camera there because of this return on investment,’ ” says Michael Slack, CTO of
New Jersey Transit, which is the nation’s largest statewide public transportation system.“It’s a
question of,‘How do I take [the video from the cameras] and make it sharable?’That’s where
the beneﬁt is.”
Sophisticated new computer programs will immediately alert the police whenever
anyone viewed by any of the cameras placed at buildings and other structures considered ter-
rorist targets wanders aimlessly in circles, lingers outside a public building, pulls a car onto

the shoulder of a highway, or leaves a package and walks away from it. Images of those
people will be highlighted in color at the city’s central monitoring station, allowing dis-
patchers to send police ofﬁcers to the scene immediately.
“Cameras are the equivalent of hundreds of sets of eyes,” Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
said when he unveiled the city’s surveillance initiative.“They’re the next best thing to having
police ofﬁcers stationed at every potential trouble spot.”
In fact, the port of Jacksonville, Florida, has dispensed with human monitoring of cam-
eras altogether by sending alerts and live video to the personal digital assistant of the nearest
ofﬁcer on patrol.A spokesman for the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, Edwin C.Yohnka, said the new system was “really a huge expansion of the city’s
surveillance program. With the aggressive way these types of surveillance equipment are
being marketed and implemented,”Yohnka said,“it really does raise questions about what
kind of society do we ultimately want, and how intrusive we want law enforcement ofﬁcials
to be in all of our lives.”
The surveillance network will embrace cameras placed not only by the police depart-
ment, but also by a variety of city agencies including the transit, housing, and aviation
authorities. Private companies that maintain their own surveillance of areas around their
buildings will also be able to send their video feeds to the central control room that is being
built at a fortiﬁed city building. One Chicago community organizer is Ernest R. Jenkins,
chairman of the West Side Association for Community Action.“The 2,000 cameras now in
place had reduced crime and were having an impact, no ifs, ands or buts about it.”
Nonetheless, Jenkins said, some people in Chicago believed the city was trying to “inﬁltrate
people’s privacy in the name of terrorist attacks.”
Other citizens feel that the infringement on privacy is well worth the added sense of
security they feel when the video surveillance cameras are installed. Some research shows
that crimes simply move to another area, but for folks in the affected area, any movement
away from them is welcome in and of itself.“The value we gain in public safety far out-
weighs any perception by the community that this is Big Brother who’s watching,The feed-
back we’re getting is that people welcome this. It makes them feel safer.”
Privacy and The U.S.
Constitution:A Growing Concern
In the United States, privacy issues related to the use of CCTV surveillance primarily con-
cern the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects a citizen
from unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and other government agencies.
The emphasis is on the protection of people, not places. But in early 2007, the New York
Times reported that U.S. District Court Judge Charles S. Haight reined in the surveillance of
public assemblies by the New York City Police Department and routine videotaping of
public gatherings will be halted. Video surveillance of buildings, bridges, and so on may con-
tinue, said the judge, but should not infringe on constitutionally protected activities.

The New York Civil Liberties Union, in a Web site news item, applauded the ruling,
quoting Executive Director Donna Lieberman:“The NYPD had transformed the atmo-
sphere for political dissent in New York City with its omnipresent videotaping of every
demonstration, regardless of the likelihood or suspicion of criminal activity.” However, if one
of those New York landmarks were once again to become a target of a terrorist attack, public
reaction might move in the opposite direction.
Reacting to several scenarios constructed by the Pew Internet & American Life Project,
in collaboration with Elon University, the respondents struck on several themes and emer-
gent problems with technology proliferation and privacy issues in their answers:
■
The deployment of a global network A majority of respondents agreed with
a scenario which posited that a global, low-cost network will be thriving in 2020
and will be available to most people around the world at low cost.
■
Human control over technology Most respondents said they think humans
will remain in charge of technology between now and 2020. However, some fear
that technological progress will eventually create machines and processes that move
beyond human control. Others said they fear that the leaders who exercise control
of the technology might use this power inappropriately.
■
Transparency versus privacy There is a widespread expectation that people
will wittingly or unwittingly disclose more about themselves, gaining some bene-
ﬁts in the process even as they lose some privacy.
In comments regarding the future of privacy, respondent Hal Varian of the University of
California-Berkeley and Google, offered,“Privacy is a thing of the past.Technologically it is
obsolete. However, there will be social norms and legal barriers that will dampen out the
worst excesses.” But there are lessons to remember from that previous era. Certainly one
lesson that holds true is that the faster a new technology is deployed, the less intelligent that
deployment seems to be. So watch out for places where decision makers are camera-happy
but not necessarily camera-smart.The challenge is not what you can do; you can do almost
anything.
Reasonable expectations of privacy tend to be subjective, but for the purposes of simple
video (not audio) surveillance of public space, the use of CCTV would appear to be on solid
ground constitutionally. For example, releasing video footage for any reason other than to
enhance the criminal justice system is not recommended.
One of the core components of the argument against video surveillance is the fact that
it is pervasive in its deployment.The irony in one instance is the fact that IP networks and
their convergence with voice, video, and data applications will accelerate surveillance solu-
tion developments worldwide and make the traditional CCTV installation as antiquated as
cassette tape itself. Within this cycle will be the continued unrest between the portion of
society that embraces the additional security function in everyday life and those who rebel
against an assault on their civil liberties and right to live unencumbered by authority and its
use of technology to monitor what they perceive to be common, everyday human activity.

Chapter 4 • The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence

The scholarly point made regarding a ﬁfth utility involving video surveillance may be
closer to the ultimate reality of a surveillance society than anything else we might encounter
in the privacy debate.The issue is one of how society uses the utility model and what impact
it has on the global citizenry. On the one hand, philosopher Amitai Etzioni argues that the
obsession with privacy is an aspect of the antisocial individualism of the 1960s. He points to
the fact that privacy advocates actually promoted the advancement of AIDS by preaching
privacy rights rather than communicating its deadly global effects on the gay community. In
this example, the privacy of a few impacts the health of many.
On the other side is the cyber generation that believes the future is threatened by pow-
erful governments and their surveillance and information technologies at work to control
the hearts and minds of the global community.This position in many ways is based on
anarchy as a counter to absolute power and authority. In the middle is the ground of com-
promise based on the realistic assessment of risk to the privacy and individual liberties we
hold close within our sense of self and well-being.At some point, we must trust but verify
that those liberties are guarded and protected by the societies in which we live.
Security and Intelligence: The Impact 
of a New Surveillance Community
The horriﬁc events of September 11 left Americans angry, shocked, and eager to understand
the breach in their security. Gradually, these emotions gave way to an obsession to ﬁnd the
root causes of our newfound weaknesses and to deal with them through changes in how we
approach both security and intelligence. Looking at all of the potential targets and vulnera-
bilities, not just in the United States, but globally, it was clear to all of the public policy
makers that it is impossible to “secure” all of the critical components of our society and
economy. What is needed is a more effective way of understanding the threats, and dealing
with terrorism across the broad front of potential risks.Although early on, the focus was on
cockpit doors, airport security, and carry-on luggage, that focus shifted quickly to include
the intelligence and law enforcement communities, to determining what could be done to
improve their performance and to identify threats earlier in their development.
The establishment of the DHS grew out of an understanding that some of the failures to
ﬁnd the terrorists who perpetrated the plot of September 11 came from the fragmented nature
of the basic law enforcement activities of federal, state, and local authorities. Essentially, the ter-
rorists exploited the “seams” of the system, counting on lack of coordination and information
sharing to hide their conspiracy.The 22 agencies that were joined to form the DHS all had
missions and responsibilities that related to protecting the borders and our critical infrastruc-
ture.They included the activities of Customs; Border Protection; the Coast Guard; transporta-
tion security; nuclear response; science surrounding chemical, nuclear, and biological threats;
cyber security; the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and many other domestically
focused organizations that were spread across more than 11 departments.

The purpose of this largest of federal reorganizations in history was to consolidate and
coordinate all of the activities that could supply information necessary to recognize and
effectively deal with the new risks of terrorism, both international and domestic. One of the
more interesting things about the creation of the DHS was that most members of Congress
of both parties supported it, but it was only half-heartedly supported by the Bush
Administration.The appointment of the White House advisor on Homeland Security,
former governor of Pennsylvania,Tom Ridge, was not a surprise to Washington insiders, but
it also did not give the department the kind of leadership that would be required to pull off
this massive reorganization.The department had plenty of clout in a White House that really
didn’t care a lot about its organization prowess or success.
The early years were highlighted by the creation of the National Threat Advisory
System, which used color codes to quantify the signiﬁcant risk of terrorist attacks (a system
that has been severely criticized since its inception as inconsequential), and the famed speech
by Secretary Ridge urging Americans to stock up on “duck tape” and plastic sheeting to
protect themselves against chemical and bacteriological attacks.
DHS tells the story on its Web site, portions of which appear in the following sidebar.
Notes from the Underground…
History: Who Became Part of the Department?
The agencies slated to become part of the Department of Homeland Security
will be housed in one of four major directorates: Border and Transportation
Security, Emergency Preparedness and Response, Science and Technology, and
Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection.
The Border and Transportation Security directorate will bring the major
border security and transportation operations under one roof, including:
The U.S. Customs Service (Treasury) 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (part) (Justice) 
The Federal Protective Service 
The Transportation Security Administration (Transportation) 
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (Treasury) 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (part) (Agriculture) 
Ofﬁce for Domestic Preparedness (Justice) 
The Emergency Preparedness and Response directorate will oversee
domestic disaster preparedness training and coordinate government disaster
response. It will bring together:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
Strategic National Stockpile and the National Disaster Medical System
(HHS) 
Nuclear Incident Response Team (Energy) 
Domestic Emergency Support Teams (Justice) 
National Domestic Preparedness Ofﬁce (FBI) 
The Science and Technology directorate will seek to utilize all scientiﬁc
and technological advantages when securing the homeland. The following
assets will be part of this effort:
CBRN Countermeasures Programs (Energy) 
Environmental Measurements Laboratory (Energy) 
National BW Defense Analysis Center (Defense) 
Plum Island Animal Disease Center (Agriculture) 
The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection directorate will
analyze intelligence and information from other agencies (including the CIA,
FBI, DIA and NSA) involving threats to homeland security and evaluate vul-
nerabilities in the nation’s infrastructure. It will bring together:
Federal Computer Incident Response Center (GSA) 
National Communications System (Defense) 
National Infrastructure Protection Center (FBI) 
Energy Security and Assurance Program (Energy) 
The Secret Service and the Coast Guard will also be located in the
Department of Homeland Security, remaining intact and reporting directly to
the Secretary. In addition, the INS adjudications and beneﬁts programs will
report directly to the Deputy Secretary as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services.
In March 2005, President Bush appointed Michael Chertoff to be the new secretary of
Homeland Security. He immediately began to study the structural deﬁciencies of the depart-
ment and to organize a set of functional groups and agencies.Although there are signs that
some of these new structures will eventually take root and grow more effective, it will take
time, something that the American public has not demonstrated that it is willing to give
readily.Add to that the unfortunate failures of FEMA and other elements of DHS during the
Hurricane Katrina aftermath, and it is clear that the new department has a “long row to
hoe.”The Katrina response did not give people comfort that the response to any major
future terrorist attack will be swift, effective, and coordinated with all of the state and local
organizations who are critical to successful control of the situation.

The department has a number of other functions that are important to dealing with
potential terrorist attacks.The Intelligence and Analysis organization is charged with working
with the new director of the national intelligence ofﬁce to improve the effectiveness of inter-
facing the foreign intelligence activities of the intelligence community with the domestic
intelligence functions performed by the FBI, state and local law enforcement organizations,
and elements of the DHS such as customs, immigration, and border security to provide effec-
tive information sharing while protecting sources and methods. Progress in this area has also
been slow, but over the course of the past two years, the establishment of Regional Fusion
Centers under DHS grant programs has begun to make a difference. Focused on the preven-
tion of terrorist acts, the grants are aimed at the establishment of centers to “collect, analyze,
disseminate, and use homeland security-related Intelligence.” Establishment of these centers
provides the locus for sharing information that under most circumstances would not be rec-
ognized as intelligence. Information on vulnerabilities, criminal behaviors, suspicious activities,
likely methods of attack, and many other pieces of information that can lead to the identiﬁca-
tion and mitigation of terrorist attacks can be analyzed and shared across jurisdictions to help
alleviate the problems of attacks at the seams of the system.
The centers will be given greater access to intelligence information from DHS sources,
and presumably from the intelligence community as well.The challenge will be to get the
intelligence community to change some of its cultural impediments to sharing information
outside its own boundaries (or in some cases, inside its boundaries).The second challenge is
to promote a common IT framework so that sharing of information is facilitated across dis-
parate information networks.Another challenge is to reorganize the FBI and create a special-
ized workforce with the skills necessary to collect and analyze domestic intelligence on
terrorist threats.These three challenges continue to haunt the leadership within the
Executive and Congressional branches of the government in their efforts to build the ability
to prevent rather than just react to terrorist activities at home and abroad.
The DNI and the 
Intelligence Reform Act of 2004
The intelligence community struggled throughout the 1990s and up
to 9/11 to collect intelligence on and analyze the phenomenon of
transnational terrorism. The combination of an overwhelming
number of priorities, ﬂat budgets, an outmoded structure, and
bureaucratic rivalries resulted in an insufﬁcient response to this new
challenge.
The 9/11 Commission Report
Throughout the days following the September 11 attacks, the debate regarding who was at
fault, what we knew and didn’t know, and whether the attacks could have been prevented
www.syngress.com

Chapter 4 • The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence

raged loudly.The 9/11 Commission was created as an independent, bipartisan group by
Congress and was endorsed by President Bush in late 2002. It was chartered “to prepare a
full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 ter-
rorist attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks.”The
Commission was also mandated to provide recommendations for preventing future attacks.
The Commission’s report contained stinging criticisms of the intelligence community:
On August 2, 2004, largely in response to the July 22, 2004 release of the ﬁnal report by the
9/11 Commission, President Bush announced from the Rose Garden of the White House:
Today I’m asking Congress to create the position of a national intel-
ligence director. The person in that ofﬁce will be appointed by the
President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and will serve
at the pleasure of the President. The national intelligence director
will serve as the President’s principal intelligence advisor and will
oversee and coordinate the foreign and domestic activities of the
intelligence committee. Under this reorganization, the CIA will be
managed by a separate director. The national intelligence director
will assume the broader responsibility of leading the intelligence
community across our government.
The legislation creating the DNI and reforming our intelligence structure was passed by
Congress in December 2004 after months of debate over the details of the structure, the
authorities that would be given to the DNI, and the relationships that would exist for
domestic intelligence involving the FBI and state and local governments. Now after more
than two years of effort, the struggle to make it work is far from over.
This effort to create a revitalized intelligence structure is so important because without
the ability to collect, analyze, and distribute information on foreign and domestic threats
more effectively, we are doomed to be unable to anticipate attacks and prevent them.
Without a strong intelligence system that can draw on information gathered both abroad and
domestically, we are doomed to relive some new form of attack that we cannot imagine
now.The 9/11 Commission said that the September 11 attacks were a failure of “imagina-
tion.” Effective intelligence information feeds the imagination of the leadership and assists us
in realizing the “gravity of the threats” that confronts us.
Some of the people who grew up in the intelligence community often question the
need for the reorganization of the intelligence community.They point to the successes of the
Cold War and to the ability of the intelligence agencies to deeply penetrate foreign govern-
ments and military organizations to gain powerful information on weapons systems, commu-
nications and information systems, military training, effectiveness and moral, and sometimes,
intentions. But after September 11, how could we be complacent about the structure and
effectiveness of intelligence? We had virtually no domestic intelligence structure at all.The
FBI, though charged with the function, had none of the analytical skills to pull it off. We had
very little information sharing and fusion between law enforcement and intelligence (in fact,
we forbade it until the Patriot Act made it possible). Classiﬁcation (or perhaps even overclassi-
www.syngress.com
The Challenges Surrounding Security Convergence • Chapter 4
119

ﬁcation) kept a lot of threat information out of the hands of state and local authorities who
possessed or had the ability to collect relevant information at the local scene and would have
to respond to any attack.The exception to this lack of cooperation and information sharing
was occasionally seen when the understanding of the magnitude of a threat and the value of
cooperation was very obvious, as in the case of Olympic events in Atlanta and Park City,
Utah. With these huge gaps in the structure scope of our intelligence for the modern threats,
including terrorism, a new approach was needed, even demanded.
Regarding the short history of the DNI, Greg Miller of the Los Angeles Times wrote:“
‘John Negroponte, a longtime government ofﬁcial who became the ﬁrst occupant of the
position, spent much of his tenure trying to consolidate his control over the intelligence
community,’ said Greg Treverton, an analyst at RAND Corp. and former vice chairman of
the National Intelligence Council, which represents all U.S. intelligence agencies.
‘Negroponte had the reputation for being a savvy operator with no shortage of razor
blades on his elbows,’Treverton said.The fact that Negroponte is vacating the position just
18 months into his tenure,Treverton said,‘may be a commentary on just how hard it is.’ ”
John Negroponte was a customer of intelligence for more than 30 years as a former
ambassador in posts that ranged from Honduras in the 1980s to the UN days after the
September 11 attacks and as ambassador to Iraq in 2004 following their assumption of
sovereignty in 2004.
He was well educated, forceful, and well connected to the Bush Administration, having
served in the position of Deputy National Security Advisor to then-President Reagan. He
knew what the intelligence community needed to produce, but there is uncertainty con-
cerning whether he knew how to put together the kind of organizational structure that could
deliver it. He resigned from the position in January 2007, announcing that he would return to
his roots in the State Department as deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
There was a mixed chorus following the announcement of his departure. Many com-
plained of the growing layer of bureaucracy in the ofﬁce of the DNI.According to Time
magazine,“Stocking his own bureaucracy, by contrast, was no problem for Negroponte. He
accumulated a staff of 1,500 plus a substantial but classiﬁed number of consultants.That’s
about double the staff envisioned in the law that established the DNI, and it only stoked the
criticism that the new cabinet-level agency is an elephantine bureaucracy with a leadership
vacuum; a permanent replacement for Hayden as deputy has still not been named, though an
Army lieutenant general has been acting deputy DNI since mid-2006. Others supported his
ability to bring the seventeen warring intelligence agencies under control.”
Meanwhile, according to Wikipedia,“Former DDCI John McLaughlin wrote after the
resignation was announced,‘Negroponte must be credited with bringing a reassuring and
conﬁdent demeanor to a community that had been rocked by controversy.’ ”
The new DNI, John McConnell, who served as director of the National Security
Agency from 1992 to 1996, is a retired Navy Vice Admiral who served in various intelli-
gence positions beginning with his service aﬂoat during Vietnam.The range of his assign-
ments in intelligence says a lot about the approach he will take to the position. He is known
to be an integrator, and though he is not a technologist, he believes in the value and leverage

of technology to improve the security of the nation. While in private industry for the past
decade at Booz Allen Hamilton, he concentrated on security of large enterprises and govern-
ment agencies. He understood that physical and logical security are converging and led an
organization that delivered some of the ﬁrst converged systems to their customers.Their
work with the American Society of Industrial Security (ASIS) led the way in security con-
vergence thinking with the publication of the 2005 ASIS report on convergence in the secu-
rity ﬁeld.
Says McConnell:
Unlike just a decade ago, the threats of today and the future take
advantage of globalization to move at increasing speeds. The tools
that make globalization possible, such as rapid transportation,
instant global communications, global ﬁnance, computerization, and
data mining, make our productivity increase and our standard of
living improve. At the same time, those who wish us harm use the
same tools to attack the nation to further extremist views and
causes.
Today’s threats, as we witnessed during 9/11, cross geographic
boundaries, and that now includes inside the United States. We
know that terrorist organizations today are making plans for attacks
on our citizens inside our borders. It will require coordinated
responses by the entire community of intelligence professionals,
working with other security professionals, to identify and prevent
terrorist groups from carrying out those attacks. The current DNI
Web site lists terrorist events that were carried out and terror events
that were prevented over the past few years. I would recommend
that our citizens review that information since it is so easy to get
involved in our day-to-day lives and forget the seriousness of these
threats. The ﬁrst responsibility of intelligence is to achieve under-
standing and to provide warning. As you know, there is a large com-
munity of intelligence professionals who dedicate their lives to
carrying out this mission and the other missions of the community.
The changes in the intelligence community are very relevant to the discussion of con-
vergence in this book. Essentially, after September 11, we became aware that the threats we
face in our businesses, government, and society are changing with increasing speed as net-
working technology pushes globalization. Many of these new threats fundamentally chal-
lenge the way we do security today. We will need a strengthened, modern, and relevant
intelligence community to give us warning of potential attacks, focus our resources, and
foster the sharing of information that will enable effective response.

Conclusion
We appear to be maximizing the opportunity presented by the global Internet from a busi-
ness and social standpoint while becoming increasingly at risk from a variety of cyber-based
threats and the fact that actual Internet usage has far exceeded its original design intent. In
the current situation, the ability to protect and defend Internet users and information poses
unique challenges to the individuals responsible for the administration and management of
the network and systems infrastructure. It is truly a moving target.As the convergence of
voice, video, and data over IP creates additional application solutions, a speciﬁc focus on
surveillance technologies has resulted in a highly visible public debate regarding individual
rights and privacy issues. In an age of increasing crime rates and global threats from ter-
rorism, this issue promises to be debated for years to come.
Into this environment of global databases and societal surveillance steps innovative intel-
ligence capabilities and newly formed government agencies attempting to balance individual
rights and proactive security against threats on an unimaginable scale.As global risk levels
increase, commercial businesses must also respond to a new era of global supply and partner
initiatives to protect all forms of assets—physical, logical, and human, as well as shareholder
value. Into this mix, the profession of security is evolving from its traditional roots through
convergence with information technologies. IT security is not just an integral part of IT
infrastructure planning, it is also a key component of risk management.And as risk manage-
ment becomes a more important measure of success by all stakeholders, so should IT secu-
rity assume a more central role in demonstrating sound risk management practice.
For many companies, there is an opportunity to leverage this. IT security is viewed
largely as a business cost. But by looking at it as a business enabler, companies receive many
more beneﬁts than they currently have. It is true that the ROI of IT security investment may
never be known. By working with risk management, though, some form of value can be
understood and communicated. By measuring the effectiveness and value of IT security
investment, a platform for providing a meaningful IT security program can be achieved. For
those companies that can leverage this, considerable beneﬁts can be gained.The communica-
tion of a solid IT security strategy gives assurance to investors and customers alike. Board
members are more able to recognize the value of IT security, and are therefore more likely
to endorse additional investment.

The Twenty-First-
Century Business Model
Business in the twenty-ﬁrst century is different from business in any other time in modern
history. Never before has technology played such a central theme in shrinking the worldwide
market for goods and services, while at the same time introducing formidable international
competitors that were not a concern a decade ago.The accelerated pace of technology and
its impact on competitive positioning, product development cycles, new sales channels, and
global partnerships demand a real-time business strategy.
As global businesses innovate to deliver products and services cost-effectively, their ability
to leverage communications technology to collaborate internally and externally with part-
ners becomes paramount to success.The addition of the ﬁrst generation of technology
workers spawned from the digital age will surely impact the way business is conducted in the
future.As global communications are a standard benchmark for business operations, trusted
and secure collaboration with worldwide partners becomes the foundation for achieving
business goals.These global business strategies represent the double-edged sword of increased
employee productivity and business risk in the form of threats to physical, digital, and per-
sonnel assets. Never before in the history of modern business have the global opportunities
and the potential risk levels been so high simultaneously.
Increasingly, the foundation of technology convergence, a process that has been
advancing for decades, is becoming security-based as physical and logical solutions merge to
protect global businesses from both an increase in traditional threats and the new dynamics
which organized cyber crime and global terrorism represent.The Wall Street Journal
(10/23/06) cited a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, CIO magazine, and CSO magazine
that found that 75 percent of organizations have some form of integration between physical
security and computer security, up from 53 percent last year and just 29 percent in 2003.
And 40 percent have the same executive overseeing computer and physical security, up from
31 percent last year and 11 percent in 2003. Expect this trend to continue as businesses
increase their focus on the issues of global partnerships, outsourcing, and securing supply
chains. It is imperative that organizations take a proactive role in integrating an enterprise
security policy within the framework of their IT governance efforts.

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

When the subject turns to convergence, or the merging of technologies, industries, or
devices into a uniﬁed whole, it is easy to segment or compartmentalized the issue.The trend
toward converging network communications, storage systems, and application solutions is
almost too big to get our collective arms around, and yet it provides the business advantages
needed to aggressively compete in today’s markets. Historically, the trend in technology
deployments has extended from centralized operations to distributed models as core compo-
nents have gotten both smaller in footprint and less costly to implement. We have seen this
occur across hardware, software, and networking technologies. In fact, this technology process
tends to repeat itself in a cycle over time. Essentially, the IT governance model is based on a
ﬂexible approach to deploy the best technology for a particular business unit, while lever-
aging standards to create efﬁciencies and reduce operating costs. One key change in the
computing model is the fact that as technology has commoditized and miniaturized, it has
provided individuals more power to inﬂuence the direction of product and services develop-
ment, adding fuel to the new model of global collaboration.
This has both positive and negative impacts on business operations, as productivity can
take huge leaps forward and cut development times signiﬁcantly, while at the same time
opening the network to potential threats from nefarious individuals or groups. From an IT
governance and security policy perspective, it is important for companies to understand that
the “Collaboration Genie” has been unleashed and its impact on business operations will be
profound.This will be how business is done in the future, and it creates a security challenge
that must be addressed.
As these technologies become commoditized, open sourced, and interoperable, the
ability to leverage the correct technical mix across global business operations and extend a
collaborative environment to partners based on secure and trusted relationships will become
a signiﬁcant competitive advantage.The collaboration model of work will need to integrate
as seamlessly as possible within current legacy architectures today and provide a gradual path
toward an open systems environment. In this example, a suite of solutions deployed on
existing platforms is an alternative to a new installation.This will require that an enterprise
security policy becomes a ﬂexible and constantly evolving component of the global IT
infrastructure. In this scenario, security never rests; it becomes proactive, automatic, and part
of a corporate culture that extends globally to suppliers and partners.
Successful organizations in the twenty-ﬁrst century will view opportunities from a
holistic vantage point and run their organizations in a similar fashion.This strategic view
anticipates how the undercurrents of world events occurring outside of the corporation will
impact its internal operations and deﬁne new global market opportunities.This conﬂuence
of trends effects business strategy as it changes the nature of the global workforce; the way
workers use information technology, and how work will be done in the decades ahead.
Thomas L. Friedman, foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times and author of the
2005 best seller, The World Is Flat:A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century, is a visionary. He
sees the world in global terms, which include various aspects of the political, social, business,
religious, and technological landscapes.The book is an excellent road map detailing real-world
convergence and what it means to the future of global business. One theme of the book is that

the commodity status of ﬁber optic communications has essentially made distance irrelevant. In
other words, globalization just got much easier as a result of technical advancements. In many
ways, the new business challenges resulting from the “ﬂattening” process point to the critical
role that IT governance plays in managing IT infrastructure for global competitiveness.
Friedman points out that “several technological and political forces have converged, and that
has produced a global,Web-enabled playing ﬁeld that allows for multiple forms of collabora-
tion without regard to geography or distance—or soon, even language.”
When Friedman describes “The 10 Great Levelers,” the critical events that lead to a new
competitive global environment, the vast majority are technologies or business practices
resulting from new technologies:
■
Fall of the Berlin Wall This tilted the worldwide balance of power toward
democracies and free markets.
■
Netscape IPO The August 9, 1995 offering sparked massive investment in ﬁber-
optic cables.
■
Workﬂow software Applications enabled faster, closer coordination among far-
ﬂung employees.
■
Open sourcing Self-organizing communities launched a collaborative revolu-
tion.
■
Outsourcing Migrating business functions to India saved money and a third
world economy.
■
Off-shoring Contract manufacturing elevated China to economic prominence.
■
Supply-chaining Networks of suppliers, retailers, and customers increased busi-
ness efﬁciency.
■
In-sourcing Logistics giants took control of customer supply chains (UPS and
FedEx).
■
In-forming Power searching allowed everyone to use the Internet (Google).
■
Wireless Wireless technologies increased collaboration, making it mobile and
personal.
Although the world is still round, it certainly is smaller, thanks to a convergence of tech-
nologies from microprocessors to ﬁber optics that have essentially eliminated time and dis-
tance as business barriers. It is within this environment that companies must execute an IT
governance policy to provide their organization an efﬁcient and competitive value proposi-
tion while reducing operating costs.The challenge is to create a secure IT infrastructure that
incorporates both legacy platforms/applications and new technologies while allowing for
growth and providing business value.These goals require the collaboration of technical pro-
fessionals and business leaders within internal organizations, outside supply chains, and mul-
tiple third-party partners—in short, the efﬁcient management of technology, processes, and
people worldwide in a secure operating environment.

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

As convergence casts an ever wider net across the world economy, it stands to reason
that many more people, places, and processes are caught up in its implementation as a result
of business interactivity. Far from being the inter-departmental solutions of an earlier genera-
tion, today’s business and security solutions are open, interoperable, and built to scale globally.
Solutions that were traditionally stand-alone, such as video surveillance and access control
deployments, are now part of larger data sets and new software solutions created to advance
these base technologies. Independent solutions are then pieced together for wider global
application incorporating database technologies, storage and server infrastructures, failover
and disaster recovery capabilities, and worldwide communications. Without this technical
foundation, global business applications from manufacturing to supply chains are all but
impossible. Security professionals must understand, implement, and operate effectively across
this global IT infrastructure, or their job to “defend the corporation” will also be all but
impossible.The critical step in the deployment of an enterprise security policy—as with IT
governance—concerns garnering education and support from members of the executive staff
and board of directors.The next strategic consideration from a technical perspective is to
create a business environment that is based on a ﬂexible, scaleable, secure, and cost-effective
IT infrastructure.
What Is IT Governance?
The concept of managing IT resources has existed as long as computers have been in busi-
nesses; however, the governance aspect of IT is relatively new. Certainly the corporate scan-
dals involving Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco, and the eventual imprisonment of these
companies’ CEOs, gained a lot of media attention and internal board scrutiny regarding the
subject of governance.The new regulatory environment places additional reporting require-
ments on publicly traded companies.This will ensure that the execution of good corporate
governance policy remains an important barometer to Wall Street and, ultimately, investors. It
is a trend in business operations that is increasingly visible to regulators and board members
alike.The concept of governance is extending beyond government-imposed reporting regu-
lations. IT governance is gaining in acceptance and could be the most important factor in
generating business value from a ﬁrm’s IT investments when aligned properly with enter-
prise business strategy.
The move toward IT governance is occurring at the same time as the convergence of
physical security solutions and IT within the context of an enterprise security policy.This
intersection offers an opportunity for leading-edge companies to compete in the new global
economy with highly optimized IT infrastructures providing ﬂexible business services, while
at the same time offering a secure environment for protecting digital, physical, and personnel
assets.The convergence of security operations, both physical and logical, is embedded into
the IT governance process as a critical business element. Leading-edge organizations will
merge IT governance initiatives, a ﬂexible computing infrastructure, and global security
policy into a “trusted enterprise” model.This approach provides the ability to proactively
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5
127

respond to business opportunities and protect against new security threats equally well.This
strategy will ultimately provide a unique competitive advantage in the global marketplace
where value is calculated on continuous innovation, time to market, and secure global opera-
tions.The “trusted enterprise” model will create a higher stock valuation for those enter-
prises which successfully deploy it.A well-managed IT governance policy that includes
security as part of its vision for the future of business operations creates that foundation.
Although an IT governance policy may initially be one of the last issues an overworked
IT department needs or wants to consider, it provides the best way to establish long-term IT
credibility with the peer business units in the organization. Collaborating with the business
units on how IT infrastructure assists in reaching their individual goals is one key toward
establishing mutual trust.The actual processes involved are wide-ranging and can include
everything from project assistance, compliance reporting, providing new services to customers,
protecting critical information assets, and managing secure supply chain practices.As business
enterprises today are adopting a number of new information systems to streamline each busi-
ness process through automation, the practice of IT governance takes on a more prominent
role within the company.Although the importance of the technology cannot be discounted, it
is equally important to understand the personal dynamics involved in business collaboration.
At the end of the day, it is the people that make the difference. Many times the people in the
IT department have professional backgrounds and personal interests which are different from
those in the ﬁnance department, who are different in many respects to the people in sales or
physical security.The ability to inﬂuence operational behavior across a wide range of diverse
groups of people in an organization and outward to suppliers and partners is a leadership
quality. Increasingly, leadership is the critical requirement toward establishing the baseline of
credibility and trust needed to succeed with an IT governance policy.
Successfully executing a policy based on IT governance, which touches all the various
departments in the organization, is also a management issue. In fact, governance and manage-
ment have many similarities, which become evident when examining the classic deﬁnitions
of these two words:
■
Governance  Government; exercise of authority; control. 2. A method or
system of government or management.
■
Management 1.The act or manner of managing; handling, direction, or control.
2. Skill in managing; executive ability: great management and tact.
Basically, governance determines who makes the decisions and management is the process
of making and implementing the decisions.Yet, although the deﬁnitions may be similar, they
also point to the skill sets, new to some within the organization, which must be acquired and
mastered if convergence is to be realized. It is the senior executive team that delegates the
management of the IT infrastructure in accomplishing business unit goals.The actual execu-
tive roles vary according to the size of the organization. In most cases where global Fortune
500 organizations are involved, it is most likely the board of directors delegating authority for
IT governance to the CEO or, more likely, the CIO, who in turn organizes the various oper-
ating committees and review boards for enterprise implementation.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

An alternative view contends that the protection of information critical to running all of
the business units extends beyond the scope and responsibilities of the IT department.This
role requires the leadership of a different executive.This could be the direct responsibility of
the CEO, or an alternative would be a chief risk ofﬁcer (CRO) or a chief information secu-
rity ofﬁcer (CISO). In either case, the good news is that the responsibility for the protection
of critical corporate information and the systems that produce the data falls squarely on the
shoulders of the CEO and the board of directors.Although it is sometimes difﬁcult to apply
a hard and fast return on investment (ROI) calculation to IT expenditures, executives
innately understand the problems with not having information available to report quarterly
numbers to Wall Street.Additionally, in the typical enterprise, infrastructure costs account for
approximately 55 percent of the total IT investment.This fact is seldom lost on senior exec-
utives.The effective utilization of the IT asset base across business units is critical for a desir-
able return on investment, and for that investment to pay dividends, the infrastructure must
be secure. For this reason, senior management and the board of directors will place priority
status upon deploying information security functions as an intrinsic component of the IT
governance policy.
The evolution of security policy within the enterprise is based in large measure upon
the overall risk the organization faces on a variety of fronts.These can be reﬂected by
increased internal threats to privacy data and/or patents and copyrights, as well the protec-
tion of global supply chains and trusted partnerships.The importance of this issue to senior
management and the board of directors has resulted in the creation of the CRO position. In
many situations, the importance of managing increasing global risk for the company will
exceed the responsibility and scope of the individual positions of the CIO, CSO, and CISO.
The actual reporting structure will vary and will depend on the individual company and, in
many cases, the vertical market. What is clear at this juncture is that security policy must be
created and integrated into the organization’s IT infrastructure. In this way, security solutions
are more ﬂexible and responsive to new and growing risks while leveraging the performance
and cost advantages of the latest technical innovations.Additionally, similar productivity ben-
eﬁts to this enterprisewide security collaboration will be realized, as they have proven to be
in every other department across the organization, from ﬁnancial reporting to coordinated
travel policies.
Aside from the reporting chains, one trend that shows no sign of weakening is that secu-
rity as a business practice is being integrated into the various corporate departments in a
coordinated fashion and is evolving beyond a historical silo, or stand-alone approach, per
department. In short, the physical security department is the last to follow the lead of inte-
grating solutions and collaborating across the company. Engineering and software develop-
ment departments have been doing this for the past 20 years.
As for security software deployments, new products are attempting to manage and coor-
dinate the multiple products deployed by individual departments over the years, which cause
administration problems and many times involve functional overlap.Additionally, newer secu-
rity software and appliance products are moving toward more aggressive proactive status
based on Internet trafﬁc and individual client/device usage rather than traditionally

responding to problems after the fact with piecemeal solutions.These strategic deployments,
involving both physical and logical functionality, are part of a broader enterprise security
policy that impacts internal operations as well as external supply chains and partnerships.As
such, the importance and scope of the security policy must be deﬁned within the company’s
overall IT governance policy. In this way, risk assessment (and security) is embedded into the
corporate culture of the organization and is part of a proactive planning and budgeting cycle.
Just as an IT governance policy determines how an organization will utilize systems and
software to design, develop, or distribute products to generate revenues, a security policy is
increasingly being integrated into the process to protect the corporation’s assets (physical,
electronic, and human) and to ensure trusted relationships and supply chains.
IT Governance Research: 
MIT Sloan School of Management
The Center of Information Systems Research (CISR) is a research center at the MIT Sloan
School of Management. Peter Weill, director and senior research scientist, and Dr. Jeanne
Ross, principal research scientist, are two of the industry’s leading experts on the subject of IT
governance.As co-authors of IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for
Superior Results (Harvard Business School Press, 2004), they produced the most informative
text to date on the subject. CISR research deﬁnes IT governance as “specifying the decision
rights and accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT.”
Citing a CISR survey (2001–2003) of 256 enterprises spanning America, Europe, and
Asia Paciﬁc that examined 24 Fortune 100 ﬁrms in depth and produced 40 case studies, a
baseline for successful IT governance goals was produced.The top six drivers identiﬁed by
survey participants included the following:
■
Better service delivery (24 percent)
■
Improved IT-to-business alignment (19 percent)
■
Cost management (13 percent)
■
Compliance with legal initiatives (12 percent) 
■
Security (9 percent)
■
Project prioritization (9 percent)
One of the key ﬁndings in the research was the requirement for the IT organization to
behave as a true business unit. IT governance provides the management framework for IT to
position itself to excel in collaboration with the other business units in the enterprise.
According to the study,“Without a cohesive IT governance design, enterprises must rely on
their CIOs to ameliorate problems through tactical solutions rather than position IT as a
strategic asset.”The study identiﬁed several areas of best practice among successful IT gover-
nance projects:

■
They clarify business strategies and the role of IT in achieving them.
■
They measure and manage the amount spent on and the value received from IT.
■
They assign accountability for the organizational changes required to beneﬁt from
new IT capabilities.
■
They learn from each implementation, becoming more adept at sharing and
reusing IT assets.
Another key ﬁnding was in the area of effective communications.According to the
study,“the best predictor of IT governance performance is the percentage of managers in
leadership positions who can accurately describe IT governance.”This quote cuts to the
heart of determining the success of an IT governance mandate. Without the support of
senior-level executives and/or the board of directors, along with the managers responsible for
execution, the chances of deploying a successful IT governance policy are slim.The value
that IT governance provides the overall operation of the business through the alignment of
IT infrastructure and business unit objectives must be communicated effectively across the
organization.The ability to lead, inﬂuence, and motivate people to change is a rare trait
indeed. It is all but impossible without powerful communication skills.
This is a critical point and an area that many executives across multiple disciplines must
clearly understand and, in many cases, improve upon.As individuals from functional areas as
diverse as IT and physical security ﬁnd that convergence has created an environment
whereby solutions and processes are reaching across the enterprise, so too must their indi-
vidual skill sets expand beyond the traditional IT or physical security department they repre-
sent.The ability to effectively communicate and execute upon tactical and strategic goals,
position business value across the organization, present cost-effective ROI analysis, and
understand business issues from a holistic perspective rather than a silo mentality, become
critical business skills. In many ways, technical convergence and IT governance issues provide
a wider perspective into enterprise operations and, as such, demand new thinking from exec-
utives and managers pursuing cultural change in their organizations. Communicating mutual
enterprise value is the key.
Weill and Ross conclude that effective IT governance is the single most important pre-
dictor of the value an organization generates from IT, and that effective IT governance must
address three questions:
■
What decisions must be made to ensure effective management and use of IT?
■
Who should make these decisions?
■
How will these decisions be made and monitored?
Good IT governance provides an enterprisewide capability for managing IT for the
beneﬁt of the organization in attaining its strategic goals. It establishes a hierarchy of decision
making and delegates roles and responsibilities, along with authority, so that people are held
accountable for results. One challenge is to streamline large, complex organizations while

deﬁning a governance policy that is easy to communicate.The actual governance model will
vary according to company, and many will implement multiple forms of management prac-
tices.These include executive committees, advisory boards, division and department groups,
and customer councils.The key is that “No matter what IT governance mechanism is used,
it must facilitate decision-making, ensure alignment between technology and business goals,
and communicate governance principals and decisions.” (Weill and Ross)
The subject of IT governance is both critical to business operations and extensive in
scope. Peter Weill and Dr. Jeanne Ross have provided an excellent overview of the 10 prin-
cipals of IT governance (see the following sidebar). IT governance provides the process for
deploying a secure and ﬂexible enterprise infrastructure as the foundation for business com-
petitiveness in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Notes from the Underground…
Ten Principles of IT Governance
1. Actively design governance
Many enterprises have created disparate IT governance mecha-
nisms. Patching up problems as they arise is a defensive tactic that
limits opportunities for strategic impact from IT. Instead, manage-
ment should actively design IT governance around the enterprise’s
objectives and performance goals.
2. Know when to redesign
Rethinking the whole governance structure requires that indi-
viduals learn new roles and relationships. Learning takes time.
Thus, governance redesign should be infrequent. Our recommen-
dation is that a change in governance is required with a change in
desirable behavior. 
3. Involve senior managers
In our study, ﬁrms with more effective IT governance had more
senior management involvement. CIOs must be effectively involved
in IT governance for success. Other senior managers must partici-
pate in the committees, the approval processes, and performance
reviews. 
4. Make choices
Good governance, like good strategy, requires choices. As the
number of trade-offs increases, governance becomes more com-
plex. Top-performing enterprises handle goal conﬂicts with a few

132

Continued

clear business principles. The resulting IT principles reﬂect these
business principles. 
5. Clarify the exception-handling process
In IT terms, exceptions challenge the status quo, particularly the
IT architecture and infrastructure. If the exception proposed by a
business unit has value, a change to the IT architecture could ben-
eﬁt the entire enterprise. All exemplars have three common ele-
ments to their exceptions procedures:
■
The process is clearly deﬁned and understood by all. 
■
The process has a few stages that quickly move the issue up to
senior management. 
■
Successful exceptions are adopted into the enterprise architec-
ture, completing the organizational learning process.
6. Provide the right incentives
IT governance is less effective when incentive and reward sys-
tems are not aligned with organizational goals.
7. Assign ownership and accountability for IT governance
IT governance must have an owner and accountabilities.
Ultimately, the board is responsible for all governance, but the
board will expect or delegate an individual or group to be
accountable for IT governance design, implementation, and per-
formance. Our recommendation is that the board or CEO holds the
CIO accountable for IT governance performance with some clear
measures of success. 
8. Design governance at multiple organizational levels
In large, multibusiness unit enterprises, it is necessary to con-
sider IT governance at several levels. The starting point is enter-
prisewide IT governance driven by a small number of
enterprisewide strategies and goals. Enterprises with separate IT
functions in divisions, business units, or geographies require a sep-
arate but connected layer of IT governance. 
9. Provide transparency and education
It’s virtually impossible to have too much transparency or edu-
cation about IT governance. Communicating and supporting IT
governance is the single most important IT role of senior leaders.
The person or group who owns IT governance has a major respon-
sibility for communication. Firms in our study with more effective
governance also had more effective governance communication.

10.Implement common mechanisms across the six key assets
The six classes include relationship assets, IP assets, human
assets, information and IT assets, physical assets, and ﬁnancial
assets. 
IT Governance Case Study…
UPS: Governance in Action
At United Parcel Service Inc., strategic initiatives come from the bottom up,
not the top down. IT portfolio managers are coupled with a business manager
in each strategy group, such as CRM or ERP. Working side by side, the teams
propose projects to a corporate oversight committee, which is chaired by the
CIO.
The CIO and other business executives ultimately set the strategy, but
because the lieutenants are the ones presenting their ideas, “they champion
the project and ensure [that] the vision is disseminated through the company,”
says David Barnes, UPS’s CIO. This process, he says, ensures that “everyone in
IT is on the same page.” When you look at our organizational structure, all the
major initiatives come through the Program Project Oversight Committee
(PPOC), eight senior-level managers from across the enterprise sit on that
board, and the CIO is the chairman. The PPOC oversees all enterprise-level
strategic projects, such as our package ﬂow initiative, which uses technology
to optimize deliveries. 
Within IT is the IT governance committee, which includes more IT profes-
sionals as well as some business leaders. The IT governance committee, which
is also chaired by the CIO, prioritizes IT resources based on projects set by the
PPOC.
Go one level down in IT, and we have portfolio managers who manage the
speciﬁc initiatives. They each have a corresponding partner from the business
unit involved in the project, and they work side by side on strategy. Those teams
propose projects to the PPOC and governance committees, which decide the
ultimate strategy. Because the teams are the ones making the presentation, they
champion the project and ensure that the vision is disseminated.
Process models are being adopted by IT to support this changing culture.
They provide a means to an end for service management, IT governance, and
compliance. Process models help IT to deﬁne “how it will manage itself as a
business,” and they can serve as guidance to IT shops that are apprehensive
about unfamiliar pressures.

The CIO, a member of the IT steering committee, heads the governance
committee. The governance committee is responsible for enforcing architec-
tural standards, but members of the committee also work to ensure that UPS’s
commitment to standards does not unintentionally restrict the ﬁrm’s ﬂexi-
bility. The ﬂexibility has become increasingly important, as the ﬁrm has diver-
siﬁed into businesses such as supply chain ﬁnancing. 
In reviewing the UPS IT governance model, it clearly reﬂects a true value
add to its business operations. It is important to note both the oversight of the
committees to ensure compliance internally to the UPS governance model,
and its focus on ﬂexibility. Good IT governance does not restrict innovation or
the ability for a business to enter new markets quickly. There is also a focus on
making the teams, which propose projects, accountable for the execution and
ultimate results. UPS is an example of a new way to enact IT governance, as
described in Table 5.1. 
The New Management 
Strategy Behind IT Governance
When it comes to execution, it’s key to have your staff ﬁrmly behind you. Involving them in
strategy ensures that your vision is well communicated.Table 5.1 details how a new “collabo-
rative decision-making process” is replacing the top-down methodology of the past. By
involving numerous participants across the organization for input, the chances of success
increase as the responsibility for execution is shared and managed effectively.

In support of IT governance and its importance to the user community worldwide, the
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) plays an industry-leading role.
With a membership exceeding 50,000 worldwide, ISACA has more than 170 chapters estab-
lished in more than 70 countries. Its Certiﬁed Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and
Certiﬁed Information Security Manager (CISM) designations are recognized globally.
ISACA is afﬁliated with the IT Governance Institute (ITGI) and together they actively pro-
mote research useful to IT governance, control, assurance, and security professionals.
The process of delivering security policy through executive-level steering committees is
one that has been proposed by physical security industry groups in response to the conver-
gence of physical and logical security solutions.Taking a more holistic view and positioning
the converged security function within the context of an IT governance policy will assist in
more universal and rapid deployment of the security function. Simultaneously, it will elevate
security as a key component in the overall operation of the enterprise business units in
achieving their goals and objectives.
Security Policy: A 
Growing Priority for IT Governance 
A look at the current headlines is all you have to do to realize the potential downside to a
corporation’s reputation as a result of data theft or ignoring compliance issues. Customer
demands for protection against identity theft and concerns about privacy issues rival those of
investors who see stock returns suffer as a result of the negative publicity leveled against
these organizations for lacking comprehensive security programs or compliance policies.A
security policy that is comprehensive, extends to all areas of the company, and promotes the
development of security standards is a leadership issue requiring the consistent attention of
the CEO. In this regard, security policy is similar to product quality or customer service
www.syngress.com
136
Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

issues in that it is continuous in its application and proactively upgraded and improved.
Product quality and customer relations are not areas where poor performance is tolerated
and ﬁxed after the fact. Similarly, security policy must be proactive and responsive in risk
analysis.
The well-publicized breach of ChoicePoint that allowed identity thieves posing as legiti-
mate businesses to steal Social Security numbers, credit reports, and other data from nearly
145,000 people was a wake-up call for organizations, and the issue of individual exposure to
identity theft in general. Computerworld reported the ﬁnancial impact on the company:
“Credit and personal information vendor ChoicePoint Inc. took a $6 million charge in its
second quarter, which ended June 30, citing costs associated with the theft of personal infor-
mation on consumers.”
Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ﬁned ChoicePoint $10 million
for the data breach.This is the largest ﬁne the FTC has ever levied.As part of its agreement
with the FTC, ChoicePoint will also have to submit to comprehensive security audits every
two years for the next 20 years.The interesting fact was that the data was not stolen by a
computer hack, but by a well-orchestrated scam. It also resulted in shining an embarrassing
spotlight on the chief information security ofﬁcer (CISO) position when ChoicePoint
attempted to explain that a fraud (social engineering) was not the responsibility of the CISO
position. Understandably, this touched off industry debate and disagreement over what
exactly a CISO is responsible for.As security is elevated across the enterprise, the consensus
seems to be that the CISO scope extends beyond the technology to include securing busi-
ness practices and operations.The ChoicePoint debacle seemed to be the tipping point for
publicity concerning information theft and increasing expenditures by business, education,
and government institutions to secure information.
IT Security Spending by U.S. Companies to Hit $61 billion in 2006
2006 IT Security Spending in select sectors in US:
Business services ($10.8B)
Financial services ($10.4B)
Government sectors ($9.9B)
Education ($3.6B)
Health Care ($3.2)
Primary Industries ($2.5B)
An Info-Tech Research Group study found that enterprise spending on security and the
importance placed on security preparedness increase incrementally with the size of the com-
pany.The larger the company, the greater the percentage of the overall IT budget allocated
to security.“IT security has become a higher priority over the last few years, with a greater
proportion of the overall IT budget being spent on security equipment and services,” said Ed
Daugavietis, senior research analyst.“In the past year alone, 46 percent of IT managers have
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5
137

increased spending on security compared to only 4 percent who have decreased their level of
security spend[ing].”
The need for IT to consolidate these point security solutions across the global enterprise
to reduce duplication and administration costs has never been greater. Security risk is
growing across the company and throughout the partner channel, with new threats material-
izing daily. New strategies must be deployed across the Web, out to endpoint devices, and
back to secure internal storage at rest on servers from insider theft as well.To mitigate risk to
the company an enterprisewide approach to securing the global enterprise is required. If not,
overlapping security solutions will become impossible to manage effectively.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Information Security
Handbook:A Guide for Managers deﬁnes information security governance as follows:
The process of establishing and maintaining a framework and sup-
porting management structure and processes to provide assurance
that information security strategies:
are aligned with and support business objectives
are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adher-
ence to policies and internal controls, and
provide assignment of responsibility
This deﬁnition is very similar to the IT governance methodology discussed earlier in the
chapter, and it underscores the importance of tight alignment of an enterprise security policy
within the framework of IT governance. In the context of security, governance incorporates
a strong focus on risk management.
As CEOs and boards of directors are increasingly being asked to provide leadership on
ways to secure the business and assure compliance with government regulations, they are in
many ways getting an education on the latest that technology has to offer to support these
objectives. In some industries, and even for some senior executives and board members in
high-technology industries, this can be an intimidating issue. It is more important than ever
that management is adept at the communications skills required to put the issue of IT gover-
nance and security policy into business terms which senior executives and board members
can understand and support.
In simple terms, one key beneﬁt to be derived from effective IT governance and security
policy is to become proactive in the face of increasing threats rather than constantly being in a
reactive or defensive mode and responding to attacks, threats, and increased level of risk to the
business. One area of security product concentration to assist with this issue is Enterprise
Security Management (ESM) software and appliances, which proactively look for anomalies in
connection and user search activity to preempt actual data breaches and criminal activities.
Additionally, these software applications can consolidate and coordinate numerous security
point solutions across an enterprise to better administer products and manage risk exposure.

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

At the same time that new security risks threaten organizations, the traditional amount
of e-mail fraud is at an all-time high. In fact, a MessageLabs Intelligence Report highlights
the escalation of spam activity throughout 2006. It concludes that the annual average spam
level reached 86.2 percent, and spam overtook viruses as the dominant menace over the past
12 months, a trend which is predicted to continue through 2007. It is currently estimated
that more than 90 percent of e-mail is spam.As a result, consumers understandably back
away from e-commerce activity and are increasingly leery of e-mail messages.A look at a
recent Gartner Group report,“Nearly $2 Billion Lost in E-Commerce Sales in 2006,” puts
the economic impact into perspective.
For example, due to consumers’ concerns about the security of the Internet, nearly $2
billion in U.S. e-commerce sales will be lost in 2006 according to the Gartner survey of
5,000 online U.S. adults in August 2006:
■
Approximately $913 million in 2006 e-commerce sales is lost because of security
concerns among online shoppers.
■
Another $1 billion is lost because of shoppers who refuse to shop online because
of security concerns.
Nearly half of online U.S. adults, or 46 percent of more than 155 million people, say that
concerns about theft of information, data breaches, or Internet-based attacks have affected
their purchasing payment, online transaction, or e-mail behavior. Of all the behaviors
affected, online commerce (including online banking, online payments, and online shopping)
is suffering the highest toll.
Gartner estimates that due to these security concerns:
■
33 million U.S. adults were kept away from banking online.
■
9 million U.S. adults have stopped online banking altogether.
■
23.7 million won’t start online banking because of their security concerns.
■
Nearly 70 percent of online consumers say that their concerns have affected their
trust in e-mail from companies or individuals they don’t know personally.
■
Of these, more than 85 percent delete suspect mail without opening it.
The Burton Group, an IT research ﬁrm focused on in-depth analysis of enterprise
infrastructure technologies, reports that the majority of externally originated attacks are not
just criminal in nature, but also targeted and intentional.“Enterprises are not only under
pressure from cyber crime and insider abuse, but are facing increasing and evolving compli-
ance demands—highlighting the importance of establishing effective and measurable security
programs,” says Dan Blum, senior vice president and research director.The ﬁrm also points
out that the security software market is going through consolidation and change, as major
vendors increase R&D, integration, and acquisition efforts. Large platform vendors such as
Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, Oracle, and EMC are entering the market with their own offerings,
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5
139

even as traditional software security specialists step up their efforts.This trend extends to the
channel integrators for these respective vendors as well.
As convergence requires a detailed understanding of coordinating multiple technologies
to create secure and interoperable networks, customers look toward network and systems
integrators for outsourced expertise. Similar to third-party business suppliers or supply chain
partners these relationships must involve trusted partner status as outside integrators can also
increase the level of risk to an organization’s internal processes and critical data.Anyone with
priority access to a client’s IT environment must be scrutinized.This was a major concern
that industry voiced when independent IT consultants were engaged to ﬁx the Y2K millen-
nium bug prior to the January 2000 deadline.A trusted vendor will have appropriate vetting
procedures to ensure that its employees can be trusted partners.
Aside from these risks, there is also a major security value to be realized when a consoli-
dated software market accelerates the move to standards and improves the administration and
management of enterprise security applications.As part of an audit procedure, integrators
closely evaluate the entire life cycle process of securing critical data.This involves how infor-
mation is accessed over networks, stored and managed across the enterprise, and protected
through backup and disaster recovery procedures. It can also involve aspects of physical secu-
rity as far as protecting the site and/or infrastructure.
Security outsourcing models are the next phase of the outsourcing trend that started
with the millennium bug scare.As a General Services Administration (GSA) report,
“Outsourcing Managed Security Services,” explains,“Risks can be accepted, mitigated,
avoided, or transferred.” Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) is often a good solution
for transferring information security responsibility and operations.Although the organization
still owns information security risk and business risk, contracting with an MSSP allows it to
share risk management and mitigation approaches. More organizations are turning to MSSPs
for a range of security services to reduce costs and to access skilled staff whose full-time job
is security. Such services may include the following:
■
Network boundary protection, including managed services for ﬁrewalls, intrusion
detection systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs) 
■
Security monitoring (may be included in network boundary protection)  
■
Incident management, including emergency response and forensics analysis (this
service may be in addition to security monitoring)  
■
Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing  
■
Antivirus and content ﬁltering services  
■
Information security risk assessments  
■
Data archiving and restoration

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

Outsourcing the information security function allows for a range of security services to
reduce costs and to access skilled staff whose full-time job is security.The Gartner Group
(www.gartner.com) reports that by 2005, 60 percent of enterprises will outsource the moni-
toring of at least one network boundary security technology.Additionally,The META Group
(www.metagroup.com), also a research and IT consulting company, expects to see maturity
ﬁrst in the managed VPN and ﬁrewall arenas. Network World (www.networkworld.com) cites
a study released by Analysts International stating that China’s software outsourcing services
market reached $323 million in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006, up almost 44 percent compared
with the ﬁrst quarter of 2005. In India,The National Association of Software and Service
Companies says the country’s outsourcing services will grow 35 percent to 40 percent in
ﬁscal year 2007 to achieve between $8 billion and $8.5 billion versus $6.3 billion in the pre-
vious ﬁscal year.According to Nasscom estimates, the total revenue for the entire IT sector—
domestic and exports—by the end of the current ﬁscal year is estimated to be about $36
billion to $38 billion. Infosys will become the ﬁrst Indian company to be included in
NASDAQ’s prestigious list of top-100 companies.The ability to consolidate security services
and expertise will continue to grow globally for companies of all sizes.
The same beneﬁts derived from the consolidation of security software are applied to the
network and storage components that comprise the convergence in the IT infrastructure.
Companies tend to look for smaller convergence projects ﬁrst, such as improving physical
security operations like video surveillance and analytics systems or access control solutions.
In this way, the consolidation of multiple disparate platforms, software, and vendors can pro-
vide a recognized ROI through more effective operations and reduced costs.This process is
evident when project design teams collaborate on development worldwide with standard
software and databases, or when security surveillance systems migrate from stand-alone
VCRs with analog cameras to Internet Protocol (IP)-based cameras accessing network-based
storage.The initial phases of technology convergence projects highlight standards-based con-
solidation.The ultimate goal is that this convergence becomes the foundation of a secure
global IT infrastructure leveraged for collaborative workﬂows and partnerships. In this way,
an IT governance policy is ﬂexible and responsive to new working models and business
opportunities.
Web Collaboration: A Global
Communications Requirement
Collaboration and the Internet go hand in hand. Collaborating among groups on shared
business objectives is one of the keys to improving employee productivity and corporate
competitiveness in a global environment.The Internet, as part of the IT infrastructure, is an
enabler to that process of collaboration.
Starting with communications, the IT industry has moved to and standardized on the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network communications stan-
dard for connectivity. In the age of intelligent Web services, open source standards providing
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5

interoperable communications are the keys to ﬂexibility and business value.The heart of this
communications network is TCP/IP, a data-oriented standard procedure used for communi-
cating information across a packet switched internetwork.TCP/IP is made up of two
acronyms:TCP, for Transmission Control Protocol, and IP, for Internet Protocol.TCP handles
packet ﬂow between systems and IP handles the routing of packets.The market acceptance
of Voice over IP (VoIP) has made the convergence of voice, video, and data a business reality.
The combination of these features across a robust IP infrastructure generates additional
interest in developing new Web-based collaboration solutions.A report from research ﬁrm
The Dell’Oro Group reveals that IP telephone market revenues in the second quarter of
2006 exceeded $500 million, a year-over-year growth rate of 42 percent.
“The IP Network is… the most scalable price performance platform
since the microprocessor. The IP Network will become the plat-
form.”—John Chambers, CEO, Cisco Systems
One company that understands how to leverage communications technology internally
and then outwardly to trusted partners is Cisco Systems. During the FOSE 2006 govern-
ment tradeshow in Washington DC, CEO John Chambers shared the following story during
his keynote address.
When Cisco Systems looked to the capital markets to secure funding sources for its pur-
chase of Scientiﬁc Atlanta (the ﬁrst time it actually needed to do this for an acquisition), the
company was offered “more” money than it actually requested. Chambers certainly under-
stood the fact that Cisco Systems was a market leader but was surprised and pleased by the
explanation he got from the ﬁnancial community.After a detailed accounting of Cisco’s busi-
ness operations, he was told that “The ability of Cisco’s worldwide business units to collabo-
rate together and execute across an open IP networking platform is a measurable and
sustainable competitive advantage in a global marketplace.”
Although Cisco is a good bet for the ﬁnancial community, it did not become one
overnight. It had the foresight to bet on IP as the backbone for worldwide communications
when few companies saw the future; as a result, it is now positioned to leverage that compet-
itive positioning into the future. Cisco’s vision of collaboration required a two-year internal
process of establishing various departmental steering committees to determine the correct
processes, procedures, and use of its IT infrastructure to attain its business goals. In many
ways, Cisco provides an early example of IT governance policy in action. It is also a great
lesson for leveraging technology convergence into a competitive global advantage. Moving
forward, Cisco continues aggressive investments to secure network operations and sees a
future where security functions are embedded into the actual fabric of the IP network.The
ability to move voice, video, and data securely across the worldwide IP network is its busi-
ness model and the basis of its corporate strategy. Chambers refers to IP as the Internet’s
“plumbing,” and in reality, it is the foundation of network communications.
The ability to leverage the IP network to collaborate effectively requires open source
code and interoperability to extend into application solutions. However, openness and
sharing were not traditionally strong suits for high-technology companies. In fact, proprietary

operating systems and software were viewed as tools to lock in customers and extract the
highest margins possible from those client relationships.This model was responsible for
driving the minicomputer market to a dominant position in the late 1970s to mid-1980s,
and then eventually straight out of business during the early 1990s.
The demise of the minicomputer market was the ﬁrst shot across the bow for the high-
tech industry to embrace open source and standards. It took awhile, but sometime during
the mid-1990s the movement really started to gain momentum from which there has been
no turning back.The poster child for this development and cultural shift in the IT industry
was Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel.The Wikipedia Web site deﬁnes Linux as
follows:
Linux refers to a Unix-like computer operating system which uses
the Linux kernel. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of
open source code and free software as well as user generated soft-
ware; its underlying source code is available for anyone to use,
modify, and redistribute freely. 
The initial reluctance of the IT manufacturers toward an open and “free” operating sys-
tems environment might have been understandable at the time but has proven to be mis-
guided. IDC Research predicts that the overall revenues generated by desktops, servers, and
software running the Linux operating system will exceed $35 billion by 2008. In 2006,
Linux was growing approximately eight times faster than the overall server market and gen-
erating well more than $1 billion in revenues on a quarterly basis. In fact, upward of 100
million people are estimated to be using Linux today, many when they connect to popular
Web search engines such as Google. One of the more interesting industry facts it that IBM,
once the king of the proprietary “closed” mindset, has emerged as one of the best positioned
of the high-tech industry players in regard to its Linux development efforts. Linux revenues
will grow 26 percent annually, to $35.7B in 2008.
One interesting thing about Wikipedia is that it is a prime example of a collaborative
Web site.A word search on Wikipedia on the Wikipeda site ﬁnds the following:
Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based free content encyclopedia. It
is written collaboratively by volunteers, allowing most articles to be
changed by almost anyone with access to the web site.  
The Wikipedia model offers a glimpse into the future of collaborative business models in
global corporations. In this model, the collective expertise and opinions of the masses are
leveraged to address business problems or create new products. Leading-edge companies will
create ﬂexible IT infrastructures to capitalize on these trends. Collaboration can result in an
outsourcing security nightmare based on the need for security extending well beyond the
walls of the company. In a supply chain scenario, a large global company is only as secure as
its smallest supplier link, which, if breeched, can provide access into a large partner’s net-
work(s) and, ultimately, databases. It is important that the process for vendor and partner col-
laboration include a common set of security standards. Once again, integrating enterprise

security policy within the IT governance framework will involve new communication tech-
nologies and processes.Additionally, this Web-based collective could be utilized to advance
better security policies and protect business operations such as supply chains, vetting trusted
partners, and protecting critical digital assets.
As network infrastructure (IP) and open source code (Linux) gain traction to sustain
Web-based collaboration, the need for interoperability across various systems and solutions is
a key focus area for integrators.The Extensible Markup Language (XML) supports a wide
variety of applications. XML languages or “dialects” are easy to design and process. XML’s
primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of data across different information systems, par-
ticularly systems connected via the Internet. Formally deﬁned languages based on XML
allow diverse software to reliably understand information formatted and passed in various
languages. XML will provide a huge step forward in the security industry by enabling users
to share features, functionality, and interoperability among disparate systems. It is now pos-
sible through one graphical user interface (GUI) to have access control, video surveillance
and analytics, building automation, sensor technologies, and emergency communications
available real time on an enterprise management console.
Eventually, convergence will provide the open and interoperable environment where
security applications can be deployed in a proactive mode across the Web and integrated in a
secure computing and networking infrastructure.At the core of the Web services model will
be a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), an environment that can simplify the integration
of multiple systems and applications to communicate with one another in the background
across the network.This is optimal when interconnecting to legacy data assets and applica-
tions. IT governance will manage the architectural road map for current and future business
operations and compliance requirements.
Government Compliance
According to John Hagerty, analyst at AMR Research, companies will spend more than $80
billion on compliance-related work between 2005 and 2009.
HSPD-12
The core requirement for “Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12,” or HSPD-12 as it
is commonly referred to, is to implement a federal government-wide common and reliable
identiﬁcation veriﬁcation system that will be interoperative between all government agencies
and serve as the basis for reciprocity between those agencies. Identity needs to be consistent
across departments and agencies, and should be applicable across both physical and logical
access.
HSPD-12 establishes a policy that clearly deﬁnes how security will be enforced:
■
The program manages identity life cycles.
■
It combines best-of-breed products and resolves integration challenges.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

■
HSPD-12 was created to meet the future security needs of an organization.
HSPD-12 mandates badges for all federal employees and contractors under guidelines
formed by NIST.Although this is a landmark move for the federal government, the impact
of established standards for smart card credentials on state government, university, and corpo-
rate markets will have a more far-reaching effect.The NIST standard provides a thorough
checklist for consideration by all program managers.
Two highlights of the NIST standard are important for multiple markets:
■
A detailed vetting process that includes background checks and the authentication
of birth certiﬁcates and passports
■
The establishment of a credential that is difﬁcult to counterfeit and a structure to
prevent the creation of unauthorized credentials
HSPD-12 was initially developed to address security issues but will have application in
other areas, such as local area network (LAN) logon, e-mail signature, and Web portal usage.
Smart card technology is the base technology supporting the HSPD-12 directive and will
migrate from large government deployments quickly into the commercial environment.They
are excellent devices for storing secure digital signatures, public key data, and biometrics to
authenticate identity and can be utilized for security practices involving both physical and
logical requirements. For a copy of the HSPD-12 directive, see below.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12  
Subject: Policy for a Common Identiﬁcation Standard for Federal
Employees and Contractors
(1) Wide variations in the quality and security of forms of identiﬁca-
tion used to gain access to secure Federal and other facilities where
there is potential for terrorist attacks need to be eliminated.
Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to enhance security,
increase Government efﬁciency, reduce identity fraud, and protect
personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide
standard for secure and reliable forms of identiﬁcation issued by the
Federal Government to its employees and contractors (including
contractor employees).
(2) To implement the policy set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary
of Commerce shall promulgate in accordance with applicable law a
Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identiﬁcation (the
“Standard”) not later than 6 months after the date of this directive
in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense,
the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the
Director of the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget (OMB), and the
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5
145

Director of the Ofﬁce of Science and Technology Policy. The
Secretary of Commerce shall periodically review the Standard and
update the Standard as appropriate in consultation with the
affected agencies.
(3) “Secure and reliable forms of identiﬁcation” for purposes of this
directive means identiﬁcation that (a) is issued based on sound cri-
teria for verifying an individual employee’s identity; (b) is strongly
resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
exploitation; (c) can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and (d)
is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by
an ofﬁcial accreditation process. The Standard will include gradu-
ated criteria, from least secure to most secure, to ensure ﬂexibility in
selecting the appropriate level of security for each application. The
Standard shall not apply to identiﬁcation associated with national
security systems as deﬁned by 44 U.S.C. 3542(b)(2).
(4) Not later than 4 months following promulgation of the
Standard, the heads of executive departments and agencies shall
have a program in place to ensure that identiﬁcation issued by their
departments and agencies to Federal employees and contractors
meets the Standard. As promptly as possible, but in no case later
than 8 months after the date of promulgation of the Standard, the
heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the maximum
extent practicable, require the use of identiﬁcation by Federal
employees and contractors that meets the Standard in gaining phys-
ical access to Federally controlled facilities and logical access to
Federally controlled information systems. Departments and agencies
shall implement this directive in a manner consistent with ongoing
Government-wide activities, policies and guidance issued by OMB,
which shall ensure compliance.
(5) Not later than 6 months following promulgation of the
Standard, the heads of executive departments and agencies shall
identify to the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and
the Director of OMB those Federally controlled facilities, Federally
controlled information systems, and other Federal applications that
are important for security and for which use of the Standard in cir-
cumstances not covered by this directive should be considered. Not
later than 7 months following the promulgation of the Standard,
the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and the
Director of OMB shall make recommendations to the President con-
cerning possible use of the Standard for such additional Federal
applications.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

(6) This directive shall be implemented in a manner consistent with
the Constitution and applicable laws, including the Privacy Act (5
U.S.C. 552a) and other statutes protecting the rights of Americans.
(7) Nothing in this directive alters, or impedes the ability to carry
out, the authorities of the Federal departments and agencies to per-
form their responsibilities under law and consistent with applicable
legal authorities and presidential guidance. This directive is intended
only to improve the internal management of the executive branch
of the Federal Government, and it is not intended to, and does not,
create any right or beneﬁt enforceable at law or in equity by any
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, entities,
ofﬁcers, employees or agents, or any other person.
(8) The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security shall report
to me not later than 7 months after the promulgation of the
Standard on progress made to implement this directive, and shall
thereafter report to me on such progress or any recommended
changes from time to time as appropriate.
GEORGE W. BUSH
Sarbanes-Oxley
The history of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation originates with Senator Paul Sarbanes and
Representative Michael Oxley, who authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), which
was signed into law July 30, 2002. It was the result of the corporate scandals that gained
worldwide attention earlier that year.WorldCom,Tyco, Global Crossing, and Enron blatantly
lied when submitting corporate ﬁnancial statements, in some cases with the knowledge of
their internal and outside accountant, to defraud both shareholders and their own employees.
In Enron’s case, its CPA ﬁrm,Arthur Andersen, actually went out of business after a storied
100-year history.After numerous executive indictments, Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) investigations, and hearings on Capitol Hill, it was no surprise that laws were passed to
protect investors and restore credibility to Wall Street. Unfortunately, it was too late for
investors and many employees who saw their 401K retirement savings wiped out.
SOX provides guidelines and enforces the policing and retention of accounting records
for companies.The key to compliance with SOX is the presence of an extensive audit trail,
complete with drill-down and drill-around functionality.The idea is to provide the ability to
trace source documents through the accounting systems to the ﬁnal ﬁnancial statements, and
back to the original source documents. In other words, corporations provide proof of an
extensive audit trail capability to restore conﬁdence in public markets. Because SOX deﬁnes
business practices which are automated, it has an impact on the technologies used in compli-
ance with the regulations.
www.syngress.com
IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy • Chapter 5
147

The primary requirement is centered on ﬁnancial data—electronic and hard copy.A key
goal within the IT infrastructure is to secure and manage numerous ﬁnancial documents in
an effort to cost-effectively comply with the law.The issue is difﬁcult when one considers
the downside of collaboration in a distributed environment. Policies for storage of ﬁnancial
data must be managed efﬁciently, secured, and protected by failover mechanisms.The large
number of “unstructured” documents such as ﬁnancial spreadsheets transported over corpo-
rate networks in the form of e-mails and stored locally on laptops deﬁnes the magnitude of
the problem from a technical standpoint.Additional SOX mandates require publicly traded
companies to implement internal security controls for both access and computer operations.
This process involves deﬁning risk factors from the physical and logical security perspectives.
A solution here involves the convergence of physical security (access control, video surveil-
lance) and information technology (IP networks and storage systems) to cost-effectively
comply.All of these regulatory issues eventually involve a coordinated IT governance and
enterprise security policy.
HIPPA
Another regulation enacted by Congress is the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).The law’s primary purpose is to protect health infor-
mation by establishing transaction standards for the exchange of health information. It also
mandates security and privacy standards for the use and disclosure of individually identiﬁable
health information. HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare
providers.
The HIPAA provision has three major requirements:
■
Protection for the privacy of protected health information
■
Protection for the security of protected health information
■
Standardization of electronic data interchange in healthcare transactions
HIPPA required that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) establish
national standards for electronic data interchange. EDI is the automated transfer of data in a
speciﬁc format following speciﬁc data content rules between a healthcare provider and
Medicare, or between Medicare and another healthcare plan.
As organizations of all sizes respond to government compliance regulations, the need for
an integrated reporting capability aligned within a ﬂexible, standards-based infrastructure is
required. It is important to remember that these compliance regulations are ongoing and
consistent and are not a one-time event.The nature of the reporting is also subject to change
and the ability to respond in an accurate and timely fashion will improve productivity by
limiting the impact of enterprisewide compliance.
The need for compliance reporting to be integrated into business operations cannot be
understated.An interesting report regarding the impact that compliance reporting has on
internal resources was recently published by the Department of Management at the London
www.syngress.com
148
Chapter 5 • IT Governance and Enterprise Security Policy

School of Economics (LSE).The research concluded that businesses are at risk of failing
compliance audits and managing other security-related efforts due to a lack of qualiﬁed
employees to conduct the work. It is a simple case of demand outpacing supply, with the
issue most severe in the United States, where the government has been aggressively imple-
menting SOX.The report mentioned that many large companies are at risk of reaching a
“compliance breaking point” because they rely on a small internal talent pool for compliance
audits and security projects.As such, these people are very hard to replace if they leave for
higher-paying opportunities.“The practice of reporting breaches, now commonplace in the
United States and quickly spreading to several regions in the world, will impact the way
individuals and organizations think about information handling in general and reputation in
particular,” said Dr. Jonathan Liebenau of LSE, who conducted the report.
The report cited that security practices in global organizations are often subjective, lack
standard benchmarks, and tend to be implemented in a closed environment.These compa-
nies lack a convergence plan for these “disparate” security groups to be better coordinated
with the IT organization.
Conclusion
The pace of international events and their impact on how business is being conducted glob-
ally requires better alignment between enterprise security policy and IT governance.The
twin issues of mandating IT governance and securing global business operations must be
integrated to respond to new economic opportunities while protecting corporate assets and
reputation.
The tipping point in the traditional physical security industry is the movement toward
solution convergence with open systems and standard IT protocols.The imperative is for this
merger of physical and logical security operations to accelerate and deploy globally within
the guidelines of the IT governance policy. Global IP networks, open source software, and
new language and infrastructure solutions are advancing to make this convergence road map
possible. New security products, both physical and logical, are answering the need to expand
and manage security solutions in a holistic manner across a global enterprise rather than as
stand-alone, nonintegrated business operations.
As the new era of global collaboration changes the culture and workﬂows of traditional
corporations, the ability to proactively protect digital assets and secure next-generation Web
services will be of paramount importance. Equally critical will be the ability to extend
trusted relationships outside of the organization to reach suppliers and partners of all sizes
and in all geographic locations.The ability of executive leadership and management to pro-
mote cultural changes and integrate security behaviors into global business operations will be
challenging.The goal of aligning an enterprise security policy within the context of a global
IT infrastructure is the initial step toward the trusted enterprise model.

Major corporations that succeed in the future will evolve from running disparate multi-
national operations with large, complex, and redundant IT systems, services, and security
operations, to become truly global enterprises that integrate security convergence with IT
services to establish a trusted enterprise model. Security in the traditional sense is being rede-
ﬁned and expanded in the face of new threats and global realities.The ability to manage the
business of the enterprise securely is the foundation of the trusted enterprise model and the
new benchmark for deploying security convergence globally.

Introduction
The U.S. government has a rich history in the development of leading-edge technology.A
prime example is the Internet, which originated within a government sponsored program
(the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA) and is discussed in detail in a
later chapter.The current ground war in Iraq and Afghanistan, combined with the interna-
tional focus on ﬁghting terrorism, is generating huge ﬁnancial resources for developing new
and innovative research into weapons and individual combat systems that are migrating from
military to commercial uses in homeland security and commercial businesses.This situation
has resulted in traditional venture capital ﬁrms funneling resources and investment dollars
into startup companies, answering the need for product solutions regarding security conver-
gence. Some venture ﬁrms are creating speciﬁc business units regarding homeland security.
In addition, large established technology companies are focusing research and development
dollars, along with merger, acquisition, and partnering strategies, to aggressively compete in
the “new” security sector of the economy.This is resulting in a wave of product innovations
targeting the electronic and physical security sectors of the industry.The pace of new secu-
rity solutions being deployed over global communications networks is accelerating in tandem
with those technologies’ performance capabilities.This chapter will review the convergence
of military technology advances with commercial deployments and how the venture capital
community is fueling startup activity simultaneous to established technology vendors’ R&D
efforts, to fundamentally change the nature of the traditional global security industry.
Collaboration Convergence: 
The Transfer of Military Technology 
Security and technology have a life cycle that extends back to the dawn of man.The history
of warfare is replete with examples of technology advancing in order to provide valuable
advantage in a time of conﬂict. Every stage of human evolution has had its corresponding
improvements in the art of the kill and the advancement of the war ﬁghter.Today, the trans-
formation seems to be toward more lethality of fewer soldiers or the ability to eliminate
opposing aircraft from a computer screen without the need to even establish visual contact.
“Education makes machines, which act like men, and produces men
who act like machines.”—Erich Fromm
The life cycle of using technology for security will never stop, and certainly continues
unabated to this day. One key point, however, is that never before in history have the twin
industries of the military industrial complex and global commercial business been so tightly
aligned around technology.This collaboration initiates with a standards-based (Internet
Protocol [IP]) communications backbone and extends to agreement on open source oper-
ating systems and storage platforms, making hardware, software, and networking interoper-
ability a reality today, and a direction for the future.Although open source is not a current

operational requirement (Microsoft Windows is not open source, but at the same time a
standard allowing interoperability among systems), the path to standards and interoperability
in security systems is clearly set. Certainly, legacy platforms and proprietary software and net-
works exist outside this paradigm, but the undisputed direction forward is away from that
model.A major technical development is occurring in tandem with global corporate
momentum toward IT governance and enterprise security policy within the defense
industry.The Iraq conﬂict and the global war on terrorism have accelerated defense spending
and technology development for Future Combat Systems (FCSs). In tandem with this focus
on military technology is the evolution and deployment of commercial products successfully
designed and manufactured in the post-September 11 era.A coordinated network design (IP)
and the dual-use capabilities of these technologies between the military and commercial
industry have long-term ramiﬁcations on the future of global infrastructure and the conver-
gence of security solutions.
The military of the future will enjoy a new breed of soldier, similar to the new breed
of corporate employee, who has grown up a child of technology and collaboration. In fact,
the U.S.Army Web site for its FCS offers a free download of its Future Force Company
Commander (F2C2) software, courtesy of defense contractor SAIC.According to Future
Force Warrior Equipment Specialist “Dutch” DeGay,“We are working to have the graphical
user interface inside the computer systems replicate PlayStation 2/Xbox, because most of
today’s soldiers are already familiar with how those systems work.” It only stands to reason
that the technical advancements between these two industries be interchangeable and Web-
based.A closer look at the innovations and the process of technology transfer, as well as the
huge amount of money in the form of government funding and venture capital invest-
ments, indicates that this powerful cycle will be deﬁning global technology deployments for
decades to come.
In reviewing the U.S.Army’s plan for FCS, it is apparent that new thinking centered
upon integrated technology is at the core of the program.At $125 billion and counting, the
program is a huge investment.The example is cited here to prove a point about the synergies
between military and civilian technology trends.
FCS is a new generation of hardware, software, and networking that will totally overhaul
current military technology and, in the process, the war-ﬁghting strategy as a whole will
change across the collective branches of service.The Net-centric war plan has been born to
advance the twenty-ﬁrst-century soldier. It is a network system of systems that includes tech-
nologies for foot soldiers, commanders, equipment, and vehicles.The FCS program is truly
transformational in scope and allows the military to reach one of its primary goals: to move
to a networkcentric warfare model.This approach amounts to collaborating among all
branches of the service to rapidly deploy a fully capable ﬁghting force anywhere in the
world. Each branch of the service (Army, Navy,Air Force, and Marines) represents 18 indi-
vidual units, each executing speciﬁc functions and utilizing a network architecture designed
to communicate with all 18 units in the network.At the heart of the new communications
system are four networked applications: a Linux operating system environment with
embedded training capabilities, software for planning and executing mission strategy, mobile

communications and network management software, and a variety of sensor-enabled applica-
tions for real-time intelligence. Connecting the FCS together is the WIN-T-System, a battle-
ﬁeld-ready tactical Internet operating across satellite and land-based networks, and optimized
for high-speed bandwidth communications.A variety of backend software keeps all the func-
tions interoperating.
A variety of vendors are involved with the FCS program, including Boeing and SAIC,
General Dynamics, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and specialty ven-
dors of sensors and robotics. Daniel Zanini, the FCS deputy program director and a senior
vice president at SAIC, describes the new environment as follows:“Every soldier is a node
on the network … sharing data, passing it to separate systems in the network.” The FCS
model provides a view into the military’s technology planning and migration path, as well as
insights into the future direction of security convergence solutions. Consider the following:
■
Helmet Houses a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, radio, and local area
network/wide area network (LAN/WAN) connections. It includes a wireless
video camera, and a voice-activated drop-down screen embedded in a pair of
transparent glasses, giving the appearance of a 17-inch screen displaying maps and
real-time graphics.The helmet has 360-degree situational awareness and voice
ampliﬁcation capability.
■
Soldier Monitoring System The layer of the uniform closest to the body uti-
lizes sensor technology to monitor vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure,
and hydration.The suit relays information to medics and ﬁeld commanders.A
computer embedded in the back of the uniform provides data-transfer capabilities.
■
Liquid Body Armor Armor contains ﬂuid which, when an electrical pulse is
applied, transitions from a soft state to rigid in thousandths of a second.
■
Exoskeleton Uses lightweight, composite materials to attach to the soldier’s legs
and improve strength and augment lifting ability by 25 percent to 35 percent.
The Army FCS is based on real-time collaboration among physical, electronic, and
human assets within the Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectural framework.
The future of the FCS program, its budget and deliverable date, are not the issue of this
example. What is of interest is the process of designing new solutions for all of the military
branches around a model based on collaboration and industry standards.
The transfer of technology includes many examples of commercial solutions improving
government programs. Matt Bigge is a former army ranger with a Harvard MBA and a BS
from Georgetown University to his credit. He has more than 15 years of operating and ven-
ture capital experience and is currently vice president of the Technology Group for American
Capital, the largest publicly traded ($12 billion) asset management ﬁrm in the United States.
He says that generally, the history of defense commercialization is a mixed blessing. But he
cites the following two categories of successes that I put into two categories”:
www.syngress.com
154
Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

■
Dual use Things where the application of the technology is substantially the
same for both the military and the civilian versions. Examples of this are databases
(Oracle), which were developed initially for the government, security technology
(Visa’s fraud detection software developed by Lockheed Martin), and biometrics, to
name a few. In some cases, the technology is developed ﬁrst in the commercial
market and transferred to the federal market. Security technology generally is a
great example of how defense contracts spent huge amounts of money building
technology that is inferior to what is coming out of venture-backed companies.
■
Technology transfer This is where the underlying technology is applied to a
civilian application that is able to leverage the capabilities of the federally devel-
oped core technology.An example of this is the mixed signal technology used to
enable radar.That same technology is at the core of all wireless communications.
Companies such as TriQuint and RF Microdevices are examples here.Arguably,
Qualcomm falls into the same category.
Collectively, the goal is to develop technical capabilities that will migrate between gov-
ernment and commercial environments. Many venture capital ﬁrms are positioning portfolio
companies for this opportunity around the homeland security market. One can envision the
beneﬁts that the FCS could transfer to future police and physical security ﬁrms to improve
ﬁrst-responder capabilities, reduce crime rates, and secure worldwide supply chains.Also rele-
vant is the changing attitude of the military establishment, similar to corporate America, to
position technology standards for the next generation of collaborative workﬂow, on the bat-
tleﬁeld or in the product development lab.As technology reaches a maturity level allowing
for global standards deployment, concurrent with a new generation of technically savvy end
users, integrated digital security solutions are advancing rapidly. FCS is a leading-edge opera-
tions model, which leverages the critical role of open software development, in tandem with
hardware and networking standards, to deliver critical services.A standards-based global com-
munication infrastructure designed for digital voice, video, and data collaboration provides
the ability to eliminate time and distance as barriers to desired performance.The IP network
provides the foundation for sharing development responsibilities and rapidly deploying time-
critical software services to soldiers.
Follow the Money: Funding Sources 
and New Convergence Strategies
The amount of money ﬂowing into the security sector of the economy is impressive and
gaining the continued attention of the venture capital community for funding new innova-
tive products.The Pentagon is spending $100 million a year just to help coordinate the
transfer of civilian technology for security purposes.Additionally, the Department of Defense
(DoD) is spending $60 billion annually for new technologies in general, with $15 billion
allocated toward advanced research and development, with security-related technology an

The Evolution of Global Security Systems • Chapter 6

important part of the total. Much of the research and development money is ﬂowing to uni-
versity labs and innovative startup companies. Many defense companies, such as L-3, GE, and
Northrop Grumman, have security divisions to advance these technologies, and industry-
leading IT vendors such as Cisco Systems, EMC, and IBM have made signiﬁcant inroads into
the traditional physical security market space in 2006 through acquisition and establishing
new business units leveraging security convergence.The venture capital community is active
in promoting the development of this security business sector.Traditional venture capital
powerhouses such as Kleiner Perkins Cauﬁeld and Byers (www.kpcb.com), have hired
former Secretary of State Colin Powell as an advisor and have investments in leading-edge
security software vendors such as ArcSight. Paladin Capital Group has an established practice
speciﬁc to homeland security with investments in technologies including sensors, servers, and
video surveillance and analytics software.The CIA has spun off a venture ﬁrm, In-Q-Tel, to
fund technologies that have dual-use capabilities in ﬁrst assisting agency operations and ulti-
mately having commercial business applicability.
In–Q–Tel: Funding Dual-Use Security Solutions 
When In-Q-Tel (www.in-q-tel.com) was formed in 1999, the CIA determined that it
needed a means to engage with young, innovative companies that were building cutting-
edge commercial technologies. In the post-September 11 world, it is clear that we cannot
afford to have less than the very best technologies to address the most urgent intelligence
challenges.Yet the bulk of innovation is occurring in commercial markets, driven by young
companies that have little experience, or visibility, with the government.The agility that
enables In-Q-Tel to rapidly discover, develop, and deploy new capabilities is more important
than ever. In-Q-Tel’s strategic focus enables it to take the calculated risks necessary to serve
the United States’ most vital national interest.To date, In-Q-Tel has delivered more than 130
technologies, many of which have contributed directly to CIA and intelligence community
missions.These technologies provide advances in fusing data from maps, images, text, and
other sources, processing vast amounts of information in multiple languages, making sense of
seemingly unconnected information, and identifying the most critical intelligence faster and
more effectively.The ﬁrm has leveraged more than $1 billion in private-sector funds to sup-
port technology for the CIA and the intelligence community through more than 90 compa-
nies and more than 10 universities and research labs. In-Q-Tel is an example of a venture
capital group displaying ﬂexibility while remaining true to its core mission statement.The
new market dynamic places added emphasis on the deployment of security solutions, cer-
tainly post-September 11, and its ability to provide dual-use capabilities. In the future, many
new innovations will originate in venture-funded research laboratories, migrate to govern-
ment agencies, and later provide value to commercial organizations.
As you may know, In-Q-Tel is somewhat unique in its focus on tech-
nologies to advance the practice of intelligence in support of our
national interest. During my tenure as CEO, we were constantly
looking for new innovations at the intersection of technology and

intelligence practices to advance the goal of global security. Looking
forward, I am optimistic about where the convergence of mature
and widely accepted technologies with new product innovations can
lead the intelligence and security communities. Technical conver-
gence accelerates the global security opportunity.—Gillman Louie,
former CEO of In-Q-Tel 
Paladin Capital Group: 
Focused on Securing the Homeland
The Paladin Capital Group (www.paladincapgroup.com) fund focuses on infrastructure assur-
ance and business continuity in a variety of verticals. Current portfolio companies include
enterprises focused on identity management, antimicrobial solutions, mesh networks, IT ser-
vices, data storage, business process software, network management software, and detection.
Dr.Andreassen is a managing director of Paladin and is focused on the development and
implementation of new investment opportunities for Paladin’s Homeland Security Fund and
has a record of distinguished service in the public and private sectors. During his govern-
ment service, his private career, and his service on corporate boards, Dr.Andreassen has been
identiﬁed with promoting technological innovation in the area of national security. When
discussing portfolio strategies and market timetables he advises,“Pick dual-use technologies
for national security and commercial markets. However, understand that these markets
mature at different rates.The government deployment timetable tends to be two to three
years ahead of their commercial counterparts.”
Speciﬁcally, the fund looks across many industries for companies with existing solutions
capable of having an immediate impact on preventing, defending, coping, and/or recovering
from threats to the nation’s critical infrastructure and to homeland security.The Paladin
Group is an example of a venture organization that has created a dedicated fund speciﬁc to
homeland security. It recognizes the opportunity that technical convergence will represent
when integrated with security solutions. Perhaps more important, Paladin understands the

The Challenges of Convergence…
VistaScape and ISS: Leveraging 
Security Convergence Trends
The Paladin Homeland Security Fund portfolio is one of the ﬁnancial backers
behind VistaScape Security Systems. Since 1999, VistaScape had pioneered the
use of geospatially aware intelligent video surveillance technologies to pro-
vide responders with real-time situational awareness about potential security
violations. It is essentially smart surveillance software.
Greg McGonnigle came to VistaScape as chairman and CEO after success-
fully co-founding Internet Security Systems (ISS) in 1995, one of the leading
worldwide security software companies. Gregg was somewhat unique to the
physical security industry based on his IT background. He recalls a customer
discussing his data center issues and mentioning, “The sensitive data is secure
and all it takes is a physical act to trash it all.” This conversation provided a rev-
elation for McGonnigle: that the oldest physical threats are still there. The
bottom line is asset protection and risk management, and what was needed
were “IT concepts applied to physical security information.” He realized the
future meant tons of video on the network creating a huge wave of unstruc-
tured data and that VistaScape needed to add structure to the process in order
to succeed. Essentially, the selling concept was similar to the ISS model of uti-
lizing software to sift through large amounts of data looking for anomalies.
VistaScape moved its business model forward and as a result, Siemens
Building Technologies, Inc. purchased VistaScape in October 2006. The acquisi-
tion underscores a recent wave of merger and acquisition activity occurring
around security convergence from both physical security and IT vendors.
Interestingly, McGonnigle’s other investment provided additional dividends
later in 2006, when IBM acquired ISS in an all-cash transaction at a price of
approximately $1.3 billion. ISS secures networks, desktops and servers from
Internet threats. The ISS (IBM) and VistaScape (Siemens) examples leveraged
two of the continuing trends in security convergence: digital video analytics
and security software as a managed services model. McGonnigle describes
security convergence as “leveraging IT to get the physical security job done.”
As for looking forward to the next new thing, he says, ”The future of video
surveillance lies in ﬁnding an answer to the information (image) management
problem.”

The venture capital community is funding new ideas; some are ahead of
the curve, and the market. The percentages tell us that few result in windfall
proﬁts and front-page business news like Google and NetScape, and many will
never succeed. However, the evolution of the security industry is tied more
than ever to the vision and funding of venture ﬁrms such as Paladin Capital
Group. 
The reference to the ISS and VistaScape case studies underscores an important trend
occurring in the convergence model as it applies to new market strategies and the nature of
competition. Historically, the physical security market has been more conservative and much
slower to replace existing technology, preferring to wait for manufacturer-directed product
cycles, and then embrace new, leading-edge technology.Today, both individual entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists are focusing time and dollars on the new opportunities that the con-
vergence of technology and physical security solutions represent.This is creating a new wave
of innovation, much of it software-based, focused on how next-generation digital technolo-
gies can advance security practices.
As IT vendors enter the physical security market, they are aggressively buying companies
to round out their product offerings and complement existing service models targeting the
space.Traditional security ﬁrms, such as Siemens, are responding in kind as a new competi-
tive dynamic is taking form. It remains to be seen whether VistaScape can reach its full
potential.
Moving forward, more physical security companies will embrace the startup model
through mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships.This is a business domain where these ven-
dors must accelerate their efforts to compete successfully.A balance between the faster adop-
tion of new technologies and the conservative nature of security practices must be reached as
the global opportunity of security convergence expands rapidly.The venture capital engine
and merger and acquisition activity show no signs of slowing down, and both play a major
role in changing the face of the traditional security market.
ICx Technologies: The New 
Holistic Security Solutions Approach
ICx Technologies develops advanced technology solutions for both homeland and military
security needs.The ﬁrm is capitalizing on the need for the security industry to integrate
technologies, such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) sensors, video surveillance, and
access control solutions around networking, software, and command and control capabilities.
This integrated approach allows the newest technical advances in security products to coexist
with legacy systems and provide a holistic approach in a single security solution.The physical
security industry as a rule tends to deploy systems with product life cycles three times those
of high-technology products.

Mark Mills is a co-founding partner of Digital Power Capital, a Wexford Capital Fund,
and currently serves as chairman of the board of ICx Technologies, a DPC/Wexford port-
folio company. Mills is also a physicist by degree, a published author, and a former consultant
to President Reagan’s White House Science Ofﬁce. ICx was created by bringing together
many of the newest security product advances into a portfolio with the collateral goal of
transferring capabilities between security and civilian use. Mills has spent the past ﬁve years
visiting and talking with hundreds of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in the new
multibillion-dollar high-tech security industry, and he feels that the lion’s share of revolu-
tionary intellectual property and new technologies are emerging from universities, laborato-
ries, and small startups. Indeed, he cites the fact that the archetype for high-tech security, the
x-ray machines offered by GE and L3 for explosives detection in airplane check-baggage,
originated in small entrepreneurial companies. He says,“Before September 11, there were
only several dozen security tech companies, and no serious focus from the military-industrial
giants.Today, every big player from Honeywell and Boeing to Northrop and Lockheed has a
security tech operation. More important, there are more than 30,000 small companies in this
new twenty-ﬁrst-century security enterprise.”
According to Mills, the enabling technologies for terror-sensing tools will rapidly
migrate to applications in medicine, industry, transportation, telecom, and even entertain-
ment, driving a tech boom. He mentions the following examples:
■
Sensors to sniff potential chemical weapons will improve industrial processes and
environmental monitoring.
■
Scanners to see through packages will advance medical imaging.
■
Infrared vision technology to keep a 24/7 all-weather eye operating will land in
automotive dashboards.
■
Radar to monitor perimeters and borders will be seen in safety enhancements in
trucks.
The underlying interest in this market stems from the fact that the cumulative private
and public sector security spending in the United States is forecast to exceed $1 trillion over
the coming decade.This is resulting in a cultural shift in the traditional security landscape as
venture capital ﬁrms, major security integrators, and global IT manufacturers position them-
selves to capitalize on the new security industrial complex. Money is ﬂowing to the security
convergence model.
Cisco Systems: Leading 
the Security Convergence Charge
Cisco Systems moved very aggressively into the physical security market in 2006. With $28
billion in annual revenues in 2006, and gross margins exceeding 68 percent, Cisco does not

Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

enter new markets without the stated business goal of driving a minimum of $1 billion per
market segment.
The company sees numerous opportunities within the new security industrial complex
to exceed those goals. Cisco Systems provides products for moving data, voice, and video
across LANs and WANs. It also provides products for wireless access and networking storage
platforms and has a worldwide sales and integration channel capability among the best in the
IT industry. In 2006, Cisco made its presence felt in the physical security market. Its acquisi-
tion of SyPixx, a video surveillance and analytics software company, deﬁned its intentions to
be a major force in the video surveillance and analytics market moving forward. It also
announced a partnership with ASSA ABLOY, the access control giant, positioning the com-
pany front and center in the arena of security convergence within the traditional physical
access market by allowing electronic entry into doors over IP.The ASSA ABLOY agreement
will deliver additional physical security solutions that closely integrate with IP networks.This
relationship extends Cisco’s vision of the Intelligent Converged Environment (ICE), a frame-
work in which the network is the intelligent foundation for new security applications.
The acquisition and partnering strategy in the security convergence market is only just
beginning. John Chambers, president and CEO, states,“It’s clear we are executing well and
on target against our long-term strategy and our vision of the network enabling almost all
forms of communications and IT.” Listening to Chambers’ keynote at numerous security
venues during 2006, it is clear that Cisco feels IP networks are the key to collaboration
among government, military, and civilian agencies.As government, military, and civilian
agencies expand operations further from central hubs, the need to tighten interaction
between disparate teams and organizations increases. Further, as agencies are tasked with
increasing productivity, efﬁciency, and return on investment (ROI), their communications
solutions must not only facilitate seamless collaboration, but also drive lines of business cen-
tral to the mission. Cisco is serious about improving the communications capabilities of the
nation’s ﬁrst responders by providing interoperability between new and legacy communica-
tions systems over the IP network.
Cisco’s Internet Protocol Interoperability and Collaboration System (IPICS) creates an
intelligent system for integrating a disparate push to talk radio systems with voice, video, and
data networks to improve public safety.Additionally, sensors such as smoke detectors and
chemical or gas devices can be integrated into the system and send out alerts.These messages
can be voice, data, and video combined with geographic information systems (GISs) to
determine exact locations. If the incident was serious enough to require additional agency
involvement (such as FEMA), a secure virtual tunneling network capability can be estab-
lished among multiple agencies and locations.The ﬁrst phase of the Cisco IPICS solution
focuses on putting the foundation in place for basic connectivity and management among IP
networks, various voice communications systems, and two-way radio networks.The focus
will later shift to integrating other resources into the Cisco IPICS collaboration environ-
ment, such as standard telephones, cell phones, video feeds, remote sensors, and GPS devices.
A look into Cisco’s marketing strategy concerning interoperable communication and
collaboration in the safety and security market provides insight into its designs on the

broader opportunity that security convergence presents the company.Two-way radios, also
called push-to-talk radios, represent a multibillion-dollar global communications market.
Public agencies, emergency operations, and businesses around the world depend on these
devices to keep their ﬁeld and mobile forces communicating.The management software
Cisco provides is easy to use, is graphically oriented, and operates on a point-and-click basis
to access information and collaborate quickly with numerous parties.The system integrates
voice, video, and data to provide emergency responders with up-to-the-minute information
during a crisis.The Cisco solution eliminates the bottleneck of silo or stand-alone networks
and replaces them with interoperable communications capabilities. IPICS is a good example
of the Cisco “network of networks” concept, which uses standards-based IP technologies to
join various proprietary communications systems into one, cohesive infrastructure. No
market is more critical to address than emergency responders, and the capability of Cisco to
provide interoperable communications across the IP infrastructure is a stellar example of how
security convergence can have a positive and immediate impact on emergency response and
operations.
The Cisco IPICS product is a direct assault on the traditional implementation of “silo”
or stand-alone security system solutions and provides an excellent example of a business
strategy based on the convergence of communications technology with physical security.
Emergency response is one of the foundations of the security profession. By integrating a
variety of technology solutions with emergency response and communications capabilities,
the operational efﬁciencies are immediately improved and the ability to create new innova-
tive solutions is realized.This example also cites the capability of new communications sys-
tems to interoperate among old military and police equipment, such as decades-old handheld
radio devices, and new smartphone technologies. Basic voice communication is improved
and additional capabilities in the form of video, digital mapping, and sensor systems are
incorporated into the security solution set.
Cisco Systems provides outstanding products, but it is also a formidable sales and mar-
keting organization, arguably the best in the IT industry.As Cisco announced its intention to
focus on the safety and security market, it made a series of announcements followed by on-
site seminars in major cities across the domestic United States which highlight its capability
to answer the serious communications problems the country faced September 11.The need
for emergency responders to be able to communicate in a crisis situation is something every
American can relate to regardless of the technology involved.This message hits home while
simultaneously promoting the capability of IP networks to provide the infrastructure
required for interoperability among disparate devices.Automating the ﬁrst responder sector
of the economy is a vital requirement for the nation and a good marketing strategy for IT
organizations responding to a technology trend toward security convergence.As convergence
continues to accelerate, homeland security deployments will increase as the nation turns its
attentions toward domestic security initiatives.Technical advancements and political events
are combining to create a long-term opportunity to transform the roles of both physical and
logical security.

The Forgotten Homeland: Securing America
Upon the ﬁfth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Richard Clarke, chairman of
Good Harbor Consulting and former national coordinator for Security and
Counterterrorism, among other White House positions, and Rand Beers, president of the
National Security Network and former director of Counterterrorism and Counternarcotics
on the National Security Council staff, assembled a team of experts to produce a Century
Foundation Task Force report titled “The Forgotten Homeland.” It is a comprehensive
accounting of the continued threats facing America and provides an excellent road map in
the form of detailed recommendations regarding how to safeguard the country.The report
touches on all issues of concern, from improving our government’s counterterrorism policy
to corporate responsibilities for risk management. It is also interesting to note that many rec-
ommendations involve the need to improve the baseline of communications infrastructure.
Forward-thinking people, from politicians to executives to venture capitalists, will ﬁnd it
required reading to anticipate the next wave of homeland security deployments and to pro-
duce the security solutions that convergence can leverage. Hopefully, this text will evolve
into the blueprint that our government and commercial industries will turn to when making
homeland security decisions.
A network of seemingly unrelated entities is converging to form a new model of secu-
rity to protect Americans at home and abroad. Military technologies are migrating to com-
mercial applications, venture capital money is funding new business startups to create
security innovations, and traditional manufacturers in both the physical and electronic secu-
rity markets are executing merger and acquisition strategies aggressively and changing tradi-
tional sales and support models to position themselves for security convergence.The
centuries-old concept of security is evolving to embrace new threats and challenges as the
reality of the new “21st Century Risk Model” impacts a wider range of concerns from indi-
vidual identity theft to global supply chain disruptions to suitcase nuclear weapons.As secu-
rity policy extends beyond the walls of corporations and reaches out to global markets, it is
imperative that a wider range of expertise from multiple sources be consulted in the plan-
ning process to protect all government and business assets including physical security, elec-
tronic information, and human capital. Wisdom results from experience, and our collective
wisdom is what is required to secure our personal and economic future.
Roger Cressey, president of Good Harbor Consulting, is one person that has the experi-
ence to beneﬁt government and commercial industry during this transition toward security
convergence. His company advises clients on homeland security, cyber security, and coun-
terterrorism issues. Good Harbor provides counsel for a broad range of clients, including
Fortune 500 companies, industry associations, systems integrators, and innovative technology
startups. Cressey is also currently an on-air counterterrorism analyst for NBC News.
Previously, he served as Chief of Staff to the president’s Critical Infrastructure Protection
Board at the White House, from November 2001 to September 2002. From November 1999
to November 2001, Cressey served as director for Transnational Threats on the National
Security Council staff, where he was responsible for coordination and implementation of

U.S. counterterrorism policy. During this period, he managed the U.S. government’s response
to the millennium terror alert, the USS COLE attack, and the September 11 attacks. He
understands the intersection of physical security and cybersecurity.
Cressey has hands-on experience with the strategic challenges facing the security and
technology industries, governments, and countries in the new millennium. His presents his
viewpoints at industry forums worldwide and the lessons he has learned should be incorpo-
rated into the security planning process for organizations large and small.

Cressey touches on a multitude of risk factors facing global corporations, government
agencies, and countries today, from continuing terrorist threats to the increased sophistication
of hackers. Current efforts to secure electronic vulnerabilities in computer networks and to
protect critical infrastructure from physical breaches will remain top priorities.“What’s amazing
to me is how we still don’t truly understand and appreciate the interdependencies between
physical and cyber security in our critical infrastructure,” Cressey says.“This is an area where
more work has to be done and there are certainly tremendous investment opportunities that
will arise in this area.”The ability to protect our national borders and defend us against terrorist
attacks at home or abroad, natural disasters, and deliberate criminal acts will continue to fuel
venture capital funding for technical innovations and government programs for homeland
security. One key factor will be our ability to accelerate security policy worldwide.
Security Convergence: 
Rapidly Going Global
Enterprise spending on converged security projects in the United States and Europe is forecast
to reach $11.2 billion in 2008, from just $1.1 billion in 2005, according to Forrester Research
Inc.Additionally, state and local agencies are also likely to increase IT spending aggressively
over the next three years from approximately $50 billion in 2006 to $72 billion in by 2011,
according to the “State & Local IT Market Forecast” released by Input, a market research and
consulting ﬁrm.The focus on security is a priority in these budget expenditures.
The convergence of physical and logical security functions over the IT infrastructure is a
smaller subset of a much larger global trend toward collaboration and standards. Fueled by
historic funding levels and a conﬂuence of technical, political, and world events, it appears to
be a phenomenon that will remain a priority in the decades ahead for venture capital funds,
vendors, and investors. Established companies from each of their respective industries, IT and
physical security, are converging upon a market opportunity that will require equal parts
competition and partnership.Today new rules are the order of the day.A company can
partner with you on one program, turn around and compete against you on the next, only
to bring you an opportunity the following day.All of this is playing out in a business envi-
ronment where skill sets are overlapping and a lack of new knowledge will surely result in
lost opportunity, or worse.The only thing constant is change, and the only thing constant
about the change affecting the traditional logical and physical security markets is that the
pace of change has accelerated rapidly over the past 12 months.There is no relief in sight.
Recent research from the Homeland Security Research Corporation (HSRC) shows
that the cumulative homeland security and homeland defense market will total more than
$400 billion from 2006 to 2010.This demonstrates a growth of more than three times the
cumulative market of $130 billion from 2001 to 2005.The market for 2006 is estimated to
be valued at $57.6 billion and will grow to $105.7 billion in 2010.
HSRC also feels that the next ﬁve years will have three concentrations:

An energized focus on intelligence and WMD mitigation
■
A greater reliance on the private sector

The emergence of new market leaders 
Federal security budgets are up. Cyber security spending alone will grow 27 percent by
ﬁscal 2009, according to Input, a Reston,Virginia government market intelligence ﬁrm. IT
security spending for civilian agencies is $1.6 billion, with a great portion of that allocated to
the departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Health and Human Services, and Energy and
Transportation. HSRC Executive Vice President Kevin Plexico pointed out that the amount of
money that has been allocated for homeland security is unprecedented in government.“For
those who have watched the budgets and know the patterns in government spending, you
know that having something that’s close to 30 percent compound annual growth rate is pretty
unheard of,” Plexico says. One of the areas that DHS will focus funding on is ﬁrst responder
capability.As detailed earlier, this is a market where the convergence of IP communications
capabilities can immediately have a positive impact upon emergency communications.
Additionally, companies such as ICx Technologies are aggressively moving forward to minia-
turize sensor detection equipment to provide portable, even wearable devices for ﬁrst respon-
ders to quickly recognize and respond to any number of disaster scenarios. Research detailed in
“The Forgotten Homeland Report,” referenced earlier, also provides a road map of potential
investment areas within the homeland security sector in which DHS has priorities.
Security as both an operation within a global corporation and as a professional discipline
is changing rapidly.The convergence of IT with physical and logical security solutions is ele-
vating the importance of security to the executive levels of the corporation and positioning
the function into all business units.The security profession from physical guarding to infor-
mation assurance is changing rapidly and entering an era of increasing visibility and responsi-
bility. Our traditional view of “security” usually implies the physical nature of law
enforcement or the military model.The idea of security in general with its emphasis on pro-
tecting and defending assets is still a vital requirement for a functioning organization, or a
society, for that matter. It has only been in recent years that the security of information has
become a growing concern. With the mass proliferation of technology extending its reach
into our business lives, our homes, and our hands, information itself has become viewed as a
potential risk or threat issue.The news wires are active with daily stories of both corpora-
tions and individuals that are victims of organized data theft, fraud, or stolen identities.The
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (www.privacyrights.org) updates a Chronology of Data
Breaches, which represents individual incidents and a running total “number” of records that
have been compromised.As of February 19, 2007, that number of total records was 104,
067,495.The individual breaches range from The American Red Cross (1 million), the
Chicago Vote Database (1.35 million), and the Colorado Department of Human Services
(1.4 million).The only constant is the fact that the number of these incidents and ﬁnancial
impact of these events continue to grow with no conceivable end in sight. In this environ-
ment, the double-edged sword of technology offers both huge opportunities and equal parts

risk. It is interesting to note that at the same time, it is technology that provides the solution
to these extreme global risks.
In a Ponemon Institute study,“What a Data Breach Costs a Company,” conducted in
October 2005, it was determined that an organization’s direct and indirect costs of
responding to a data breach total $138.39 per data subject.These costs included the internal
investigation; legal, audit, and consulting services; notiﬁcation of the victims of the data
breach; remediation activities; and the loss of customers. In the survey “Managing the Insider
Threat,” respondents reported that although an organization can expect to spend an average
of $3.4 million annually to deal with the security breaches caused by insiders, most are
investing less than $1 million in preventive measures.
The following are the most salient ﬁndings in the study:
■
Data breaches go unreported. More than 78 percent of respondents said that there
has been at least one and possibly more unreported insider-related security
breaches within their company.
■
Lack of resources and leadership makes it difﬁcult to address the insider threat.
Approximately 93 percent believe that the number one barrier to addressing this
risk is lack of sufﬁcient resources, and 80 percent believe that it is the lack of lead-
ership.Another contributing factor to this threat to data is the fact that 31 percent
of respondents report that no one person has overall responsibility for managing
insider threats.
■
Are an organization’s insider threats more or less serious than other information
security risks? Findings suggest that respondents devote a considerable amount of
their efforts helping to prevent or control insider threats as part of their company’s
IT security risk management program.Approximately 10 percent of respondents
report that they spend more than half of their time on insider-related risks.About
55 percent of respondents state that they spend more than 30 percent of their time
helping to manage insider-related issues.
■
The top three IT security risks that respondents face are (1) missed or failed secu-
rity patches on critical applications, (2) insider threats, and (3) virus, malware, or
spyware infections on networks or enterprise systems.To address these risks,
respondents use both manual controls and technologies.
The convergence of technology in general is nothing new, and in fact has been an
ongoing process during the entire evolution of the information age. What is new is that this
process, for the ﬁrst time, is truly having a signiﬁcant impact on security operations from
both a physical and a logical standpoint, simultaneously.
Looking at world events today, it appears that a new global threat matrix has converged
upon people and organizations and has offered up such a huge potential risk to global busi-
ness that the process of security convergence has become a priority. In a word, collaboration in
multiple forms is driving convergence models moving forward and its momentum cannot be

stopped. We have already discussed the issue of collaboration as a business process. Whether
the term is virtual, Web-based, or global, the fact is that the next generation of business solu-
tions involves working anywhere, anytime, and with everybody in a collaborative nature.
This involves real-time data, voice, and video communications across a wide global
geography.This process opens wide the window of information vulnerability and risk.This
“collaboration as workﬂow” trend is just evolving into a mature business model and has
enormous potential to drive employee productivity to never before seen levels. However, in
order for this potential to be reached, business units, IT management, and the security func-
tion within the corporation must also collaborate.This requires a new business model as
well.The departmental blinders come off and a more holistic view involving a coordinated
working relationship among these groups to achieve strategic business objectives takes hold.
The fundamental element in this process is the understanding that “all business is informa-
tion-based” and this information needs to be protected at all costs if the business is to
prosper.This fact extends to every department, and the need to protect assets, both logical
and physical in nature, involves a cross-functional process of prioritizing risk.As the network
of outside suppliers and business partners expands, this need to secure all global operations
evolves into the trusted enterprise model, which provides signiﬁcant and measurable value to
the business.
ArcSight, an industry leader in network and security information management products,
understands the concerns of executives when considering the risk posed to critical data by
employees.This situation multiplies as these organizations extend their collaboration with
outside suppliers and partners.The traditional outside threat scenario is quickly being
exceeded from a priority standpoint as represented in the aforementioned numbers. Finally,
technical collaboration in the model of security convergence is occurring thanks in large
part to the expansion of a global Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
standard for global communications.The alignment of a standard communications network
with open source software code, data life cycle storage management policies, architecture
integration with legacy systems, and global support and service-level agreements are posi-
tioning to accelerate the deployment of integrated security solutions. Global security conver-
gence will embrace technologies as wide-ranging as new enterprise software management
tools designed to proactively protect corporations against internal and external data threats,
to automating technology as old and as basic as locks and bolts on doors and fencing around
perimeters.
In addition, the process of verifying identity and authorizing access to computer net-
works and physical locations will go digital and global.The security economy which gener-
ated in excess of $150 billion in 2006 (Lehman Brothers, Security Annual 2006) is
positioned for rapid change from a technology and competitive standpoint as the major IT
vendors such as Cisco Systems, IBM, and EMC make signiﬁcant inroads into the traditional
security marketplace. It is against this backdrop of aggressively deploying computing stan-
dards to security operations that the industry is primed for rapid growth.Technology conver-
gence is the result of an IP communications standard that is changing the nature of security.
Corporate security services—video surveillance, access control, and fraud detection—are

Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

increasingly database-driven and network-delivered. In other words, IT is ever more tightly
woven together with physical security. Says Timothy Williams, CSO of Caterpillar,
“Something as straightforward as a badge control system may operate more efﬁciently if you
design your network to accommodate it.”
The Starting Point: Identity
Management and Access Control
According to Jeff Kessler, senior vice president of Lehman Brothers, in the ﬁrm’s Security
Annual 2006,“Access control, along with video surveillance, is the most rapidly developing
market in security today.”According to John Mack of USBX Advisory Services, the market
for access control is $4.7 billion and growing between 10 percent and 15 percent annually.
Although many large recognized companies such as GE Security,Tyco, and Honeywell pro-
vide products and services for access control systems, there remains no dominant vendor.
Increasingly, the market is starting to see the creation of joint marketing and sales strategies
with IT manufacturers.The current access control systems market, valued at $768.5 million,
is likely to grow with an approximate annual growth rate of 36.9 percent by 2009.A recent
report from premier market research ﬁrm RNCOS, titled “Access Control Technologies and
Market Forecast World over (2007),” states that the spurt of growth is due to a boom in the
demand for access control and security systems in the United States and world over after
September 11, and later, the series of terrorist attacks in London.
If we start with a formal deﬁnition of identity using Dictionary.com, we ﬁnd the fol-
lowing: Identity: the state or fact of remaining the same one or ones, as under varying aspects
or conditions:The identity of the ﬁngerprints on the gun with those on ﬁle provided evi-
dence that he was the killer. It is interesting to note that the dictionary cites an example of a
classic physical police investigation (lifting ﬁngerprints) with the action of accessing a ﬁle for
identiﬁcation purposes.Assuming this is the current day, that access would certainly be elec-
tronic (IT) and involve networks, computers, databases, and software technologies.
The American Heritage Dictionary offers its research as well: 1.The collective aspect of
the set of characteristics by which a thing is deﬁnitively recognizable or known. 2.The set of
behavioral or personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of
a group.This second deﬁnition may be more applicable to where the current and future
states of technology are heading in terms of biometrics and software-based video analytics.
The meaning of management is easier to grasp, and a simple deﬁnition is provided again
by Dictionary.com, which states: 1.The act or manner of managing; handling, direction, or
control.—Synonyms 1. Regulation, administration; superintendence, care, charge, conduct,
guidance, treatments.The descriptive deﬁnitions and synonyms concerning control are sim-
ilar in context to those of management in our effort to describe identity management and
access control. For example, Dictionary.com deﬁnes control as to exercise restraint or direction
over; dominate; command. Synonyms 1. Manage, govern, and rule.

The deﬁnitions of identity, management, and control are not difﬁcult to agree upon.
They offer up a common concept that is easy enough to visualize in your mind’s eye. We
think about the driver’s license or passport required for airline travel, and the passwords we
use to log on to our computers at home and at work. If we don’t own the business, we all
can relate to management is one form or another, as in managing people or being managed
by other people. Hopefully, the “controlling” aspect of that situation is limited.The problem
develops when we are asked to deﬁne “access” control. In this situation, it seem appropriate
to quote George Bernard Shaw, who, when speaking about the Americans and the English,
described them as “two peoples separated by a common language.” It is certainly true that
the practitioners of both physical and logical security have a historically different view of the
world when the topic of access control is raised. From a physical security perspective, the
role of access control is, in a word, physical. It is the action of allowing a person or thing
(vehicle) physical access to a place, such as a building or an area, not electronic access onto a
computer network or into a database.
The ultimate need to positively identify who has access to what in terms of physical or
logical assets is driving access control to the leadership position in terms of a growth area
within the entire security industry. Identity management and access control really is the
poster child for security convergence due to the underlying fact that it incorporates several
physical security and IT domains. From a networking perspective, IP plays a featured role in
both local and wide area deployments providing the platform for access control applications.
The actual integration support required to make these identity management and access con-
trol installations a reality involves both traditional physical security dealers along with IT net-
work integrators.The sales channels need to collaborate on mutual education to better
understand and position the beneﬁts of standard-based access control architecture.This
channel convergence (physical security and network integrators) is occurring as the IT
department becomes much more active as a recommending and/or decision-making body in
the deployment of these larger enterprise-wide identity management and access control pro-
jects. Identity management becomes the foundation upon which the basis of an enterprise
security policy rests.
Our identity, in essence, is the foundation of a trusted enterprise security policy. When
discussing identity management and access control, correctly identifying individuals lies at
the core of the process. Once identiﬁed or granted access, the principal of least privilege is
important for meeting a minimum requirement of access control requirements.The principal
of least privilege states that a user be given no additional access (privilege) than necessary to
perform a given task.This process is similar to role-based access control, where system users
are assigned permission to perform speciﬁc jobs. In fact, when we look at some of the major
deployments of physical security’s convergence with IT, it is this area of identity management
and access control that is receiving the highest levels of interest and government program
dollars to date.As such, our initial government project deployments today, HSPD-12 being a
primary example, will become the massive installations within the commercial enterprises of
tomorrow. Jamie Lewis, CEO of The Burton Group, in a keynote presentation titled
“Identity in Context:The Evolving Business and Social Infrastructure,” predicts,“The emer-

gence of standards-based, federated communication infrastructure is inevitable. Security
architecture and risk management need to meet identity management.”
Identity and access management is the fundamental process controlling and protecting
both physical and information assets.Additionally, the capability to provide employees, sup-
pliers, and business partners with the ability to securely access global information in real time
improves productivity and reduces costs. Fundamentally, it is as much about the business
and/or security process of allowing access to speciﬁc information and/or locations to indi-
viduals as it is about the technology behind it. Identity management and access control is the
baseline for building management systems to secure the global enterprise.A comprehensive
understanding of business unit operations and their interface to the IT infrastructure as well
as their impact on corporate risk is an important factor in an IT governance and enterprise
security policy. For example, are mobile devices used by salespeople capable of accessing key
customer records or corporate ﬁnancial data in a secure fashion? Or do they pose a risk to
the company? If so, is the risk worth accepting, and what risk assessment criteria was used to
make the determination? Do third-party partners or suppliers have access to a ﬁrm’s corpo-
rate databases and customer information? 
Given the critical role of coordinating identity management and access control systems to
secure business operations, it is interesting to note that it has been, until recently, the least
deployed of the security disciplines. Physical security has concentrated on the badge and all of
its derivatives and information security has concentrated on the password.With the advent of
the network and the sharing of information resources throughout an enterprise, the use of
stronger authentication built into identity management systems becomes a necessity.
In the physical security world, there was a rapid migration from the simple badge with
photo to the radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) keys for door access and other mecha-
nisms in the mid-1990s, and that is leading to the smart card/RFID combination card sim-
ilar to the DoD’s Combined Access Card (CAC).“Convergence is the most signiﬁcant thing
happening in identity management, and it’s totally being overlooked,” says Jonathan Penn, an
analyst with Forrester Research.“Integration and convergence is an upfront cost that pays for
itself over time through lower operational costs and better overall security.”
The fact that convergence is occurring today and changing the product model from silo
to integrated causes some confusion.Additionally, the ROI of security investments is not yet
clearly deﬁned, and requires a new selling tactic for many physical security practitioners who
are coming to terms with the fact that in larger enterprises, the decision process is rapidly
shifting toward the IT organization.As these factors become more obvious, the product fea-
tures and selling cycles will adjust appropriately.
Without the capability to effectively control access to resources within an IT system(s) or
physical location(s) by associating user rights and restrictions, an enterprise security policy is
continuously responding to security events rather than proactively preventing them.A current
example of this problem is the wide variety of security software and appliances deployed across
the network in an effort to keep ahead of user demands to prevent unauthorized electronic
access.The continuous process of adding more security software and devices creates a situation
whereby administration is all but impossible.The end result is a less secure environment.

The problem is one of managing and scaling security policy, solutions, and resources to
protect global operations.The nature of today’s Web-based collaborative business environ-
ment requires global corporations to provide secure access to employees and partners across
multiple networks and storage infrastructures.The need for users to provide multiple pass-
words for multiple access points across the global infrastructure in the performance of their
jobs is time-consuming and confusing, and introduces potential security breaches. It is within
this framework that organizations look to identity management solutions to streamline busi-
ness processes and reduce complexity. Wikipedia deﬁnes identity management as an inte-
grated system of business processes, policies, and technologies that enable organizations to
facilitate and control their users’ access to critical online applications and resources, while
protecting conﬁdential personal and business information from unauthorized users.
Making certain that the right people have secure access to the right information at the
right time, without impeding their productivity, poses a signiﬁcant challenge for most orga-
nizations.According to a recent report prepared by Nemertes Research, the U.S.-based
research ﬁrm, 38 percent of all enterprises cite identity management as a top-funded security
initiative.Additionally, the components of identity management systems cannot be over-
looked.A critical ﬁnding in Nemertes’s recently released benchmark,“Extending the
Enterprise,” is that securing a data center effectively requires that every element within the
data center—from switches and routers to servers and storage—be integrated into an overar-
ching security plan.
Today organizations are utilizing identity management solutions to implement security
policy across the organization as well as provide a process to comply with government regu-
lations such as Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), HSPD-12, and Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Compliance mandates that public cor-
porations have established audit trails to guarantee that critical corporate information has not
been compromised. Identity management and access control solutions automate this func-
tionality across business operations. In order to mitigate risk, global businesses are increas-
ingly establishing standards requiring secure access tied to user identity. It is the audit process,
which follows authentication (Who are you?), authorization (What are you allowed access
to?), and administration (Managing a user ID life cycle) that essentially provides the enforce-
ment process of identity management. When the provisioning process of creating, updating,
and deleting user accounts is combined with an accurate auditing capability, it allows the
integration of identity management and IT for the purpose of continuous compliance to
improve the security of electronic business privileges.
The process of deleting user privileges is equally important in today’s business environ-
ment where insider theft of data is on the rise and poses a huge risk to employers.Access
control aligns with the identity management (veriﬁcation) function. In the IT department’s
jargon, an access control list (ACL) are permissions attached to an object that speciﬁes who
or what is allowed access to perform certain tasks. In physical security, access control refers to
restricting physical access or entry to a physical location. Physical access control can be mon-
itored by people or electronic means. Fran Howarth, principal, Hurwitz & Associates, is a

thought leader in the area of identity management. She describes three main areas addressed
by identity management:
■
Identiﬁcation and authentication This primarily involves the ability to ensure
that every user is who he says he is, and that he has the ability to access the appli-
cations and services to which he, or his particular role in an organization, is enti-
tled.The most common form of identifying people and their roles is through the
use of a dedicated username and associated password. For more secure identiﬁca-
tion, biometric devices or secure certiﬁcates provide a higher level of authentica-
tion of an individual.
■
Access control To ensure that access is directly linked to the identities of users,
access control mechanisms should be embedded within operating systems and
databases that are tied to identity information. Ideally, companies should deﬁne
which data source is authoritative for all identity information and ensure that all
data sources are linked and synchronized so that the data retains its integrity.
■
Audit To ensure that identity management systems are working effectively, it is
essential that usage records be kept so that problems can be ﬂagged and resolved.
There needs to be a central repository to which all information generated is sent
so that it can be timestamped and tied to user records.To effectively audit usage in
distributed environments that encompass business partners as well as internal
resources, companies need to develop the capability to consolidate records from a
diverse range of technology systems so that they can be collated for effective
review.
Analyst Paul Everett, from IMS Research, says,“One of the emerging trends within the
access control industry is the convergence of physical and logical access control. In terms of
logical access, most organizations are still securing their IT infrastructure with passwords,
which in recent times have been called into question in terms of the level of security they
provide. In an attempt to increase security, IT departments are now realizing the potential of
utilizing existing physical access control infrastructure—in particular, card access readers.”
Everett continues,“One of the fundamental beneﬁts of deploying smart cards in the
commercial space is the ability to bring physical door access and IT user identiﬁcation onto
a single token. Contactless physical access control credentials can also carry secure IT appli-
cations such as secure logons to networks and digital signatures.This is signiﬁcantly stream-
lining the costs and potential security concerns associated with credentialing employees.As a
result, smart cards are emerging as the de facto choice for securing not only physical access
to buildings but at the same time IT infrastructures.”
As business operations continue to expand, the need to provide access to multiple
resources, internal and external to the company, and across a global geography accelerates.To
avoid complexity, the ability to authenticate a user’s identity once yet provides access to mul-
tiple resources becomes a necessity. Federated identity management is a concept that provides
a repeatable and secure identity passport for exchanging standards-based security credentials

across multiple distributed environments.This extends business collaboration through the
effective provisioning of employees and business partners to access and share multiple, global
resources.
According to Gartner Group, identity management is best deﬁned as “those IT and busi-
ness processes, organizations, and technologies that are applied to ensure the integrity and
privacy of identity and how it translates to access.”
Market Standards for Identity 
Management Systems: Gartner Group
■
Reuse existing infrastructure and systems.
■
Integrate provisioning with existing systems.
■
Change and modify systems easily over time.
■
Scale for volume, security, and performance.
■
Adhere to relevant standards (while satisfying the ﬁrst four criteria).
■
Deploy easily with partners and providers.
■
Engender ease of use through their unique features and functions.
■
Provide a cost-effective solution.
The market standards for identity management that Gartner describes align nicely
within existing IT infrastructure governance models and lend the application to global
deployment.This ability to extend the security solution across the enterprise is one founda-
tion of the principals of security convergence, and provides the ROI and total cost of own-
ership justiﬁcation required by senior management.The trend in identity management and
access control systems in the future will be the integration of the federated identity manage-
ment model.This will incorporate industry standards, improve the capabilities of single sign-
on solutions, ensure stronger dual-mode authentication through biometrics, and improve
Web services to drive global collaborative workﬂows.
The convergence of IT standards with access control solutions has as its goal the trans-
formation of the entire access control industry from a fragmented and disparate combination
of proprietary hardware and software conﬁgurations to one based on interoperability.This is
not unlike the process of IT standardization that occurred in many other departments such
as software development or product engineering design where proprietary software and
stand-alone hardware platforms once were the order of the day.At the end of the day, the
ability to share information resources across an organization through deploying standards is
too good a ﬁnancial proposition to ignore in an area as critical and universal as access man-
agement technology.

Identity Management: 
Trends at General Motors 
“Ten years ago, the prevailing assumption was that if you were on the GM network, you
were a GM employee,” says Jackson, who is on the board of the Liberty Alliance, a consor-
tium developing protocols for sharing identities.“Today, we have dealers and suppliers [on
the network] that are not a part of GM.Add the fact that we are completely outsourced and
it becomes critical to track who you are and what rights you have, so we can make sure that
people only get to the information they are allowed to get to. Identity is the foundation for
everything we do,” he adds.
“In ﬁve years, what we talk about today as identity and access management will just be
another part of the infrastructure, and it won’t be sold separately. It will be part of your secu-
rity foundation,” says Sally Hudson, a security research manager at IDC.
The prevailing wisdom is that the evolution of distributed computing hinges on identity.
Leading vendors of identity management products are advancing feature sets by designing
open software solution suites that integrate single sign-on and global Web services and
improve both user provisioning and auditing capabilities. By tightening the link between the
application and network layers, identity management software improvements are strength-
ening the overall access control model and positioning for stronger authentication through
the use of biometrics.“There is a fascinating shift underway that has us moving from the
management of identity to management by identity,” says Sara Gates, vice president of iden-
tity management for Sun. Federated management systems allow individuals to apply the same
username, password, or other personal identiﬁcation to sign on to the networks of more than
one enterprise in order to conduct transactions. Identity federation makes identities reusable
across traditional organizational boundaries, dramatically expanding the possibilities for net-
worked collaboration among multiple organizations.

RFID: Positioning for a Bright Future
Auditing also extends to automating the tracking of physical assets through
RFID. The accurate auditing of physical and logical assets across the global
supply chain is critical to managing risk exposure for the organization. The
push for RFID as a standardized process in supply chain management has
experts predicting the technology’s deployment will grow 25 percent by 2008,
according to the annual Lehman Brothers Security Industry Report.

Webopedia (www.webopedia.com) describes RFID technology as short
for radio frequency identiﬁcation, a technology similar in theory to bar code
identiﬁcation. With RFID, the electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the
RF portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is used to transmit signals. An
RFID system consists of an antenna and a transceiver, which read the radio fre-
quency and transfer the information to a processing device, and a
transponder, or tag, which is an integrated circuit containing the RF circuitry
and information to be transmitted. RFID systems can be used just about any-
where, from clothing tags to missiles to pet tags to food—anywhere that a
unique identiﬁcation system is needed. 
Additionally, a leading developer of the technology has written: “RFID is
used for hundreds, if not thousands, of applications, such as preventing theft
of automobiles, collecting tolls without stopping, managing trafﬁc, gaining
entrance to buildings, dispensing goods, providing ski lift access, tracking
library books, buying hamburgers, and tracking a wealth of assets in supply
chain management.” In fact, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, has taken
a leadership role in determining the technology’s future by directing its top
100 suppliers to use RFID by 2005. For example, if a shopper of the future fails
to pay at a self-service RFID checkout station, a “perimeter security system”
made up of RFID readers will alert store staff immediately, at the same time
precisely identifying any missing items. RFID technology can play a critical role
in securing the global supply chain. Unisys Corporation provides consulting
and product expertise in the area of supply chain security. The critical factor is
integrating technologies to provide the customer the ability to track and trace
products, people, and assets, as they move across the supply chain. Unisys
deploys RFID technologies to achieve the following beneﬁts:
■
Achieve real-time asset allocation, inventory management, and
exception handling
■
Take advantage of market shifts and avoid supply chain disrup-
tions and bottlenecks
■
Secure shipments and operations against unauthorized tampering
These product strengths are universal across the industry. Leading tech-
nology companies recognize the value of RFID technology and understand
that it is pervasive and somewhat clandestine in its application. These charac-
teristics require the need to assure the public that privacy concerns will be
respected as the technology reaches mass deployment. “There should be no
secret RFID tags or readers,” according to a draft report by the Center for
Democracy and Technology (CDT) Working Group on RFID. Members of the
group include Cisco, IBM, Intel, the National Consumers League, Procter &
Gamble, and VeriSign.
In the end, RFID forces us to think about privacy issues and how the tech-
nology will impact society. It is a technology that can assist the mundane task

Continued

of locating everyday objects such as car keys and lost pets, to saving lives with
patient information and global tracking capabilities. Ultimately, RFID systems
will become instruments for delivering digital content and users will collabo-
rate and create new applications around the technology. Like many aspects of
technology, including the Internet itself, it offers both positive and negative
capabilities while leveraging a global user base. 
Technologies are becoming both more intelligent and less expensive to
deploy en masse. As this trend continues, the capability of security to be inte-
grated across global networks and improved will be weighted against privacy
concerns. A Frost and Sullivan report, “World Corporate Security (Physical and
Logical) Smart Card Market,” reveals that revenues in this market totaled
$90.4 million in 2005 and could potentially reach $158.5 million in 2011. “The
sharp increase in security threats confronting organizations today makes the
case for smart card-based access control solutions more compelling than ever,”
says senior research analyst Michelle Foong. “Factors stimulating the uptake of
smart card-based access control products among corporations include high-
proﬁle security breaches featured in the media, increasing awareness of access
control products, as well as impetus from government initiatives in some
regions like North America and the Asia Paciﬁc.”
Contactless smart cards are more than just a memory card with additional
capacity. They also contain logic that protects the card’s memory from being
duplicated—the message that is transmitted between the card and reader
cannot be read or copied. The secret lies in an encryption protocol that exists
in the secret keys within the card and reader. Without the keys, the message
is indecipherable. Access control alone does not require large amounts of
memory, but the possibility of multiple applications existing on one card does.
For example, transportation, cashless vending, and access control applications
can all exist on a single card, without any risk of one application compromising
the security of the others. The larger the memory size, the more difﬁcult it is
to manage. 
This has resulted in the emergence of contactless cards with a built-in
microprocessor that can support the operation and effective dynamic parti-
tioning of memory. Initially driven by U.S. government pilot projects, smart
cards are becoming much more widely used in the access control industry. IMS
Research predicts that by 2009, 22.3 percent of readers shipped will be con-
tactless smart card (13.56 MHz) proximity readers. Access Control & Security
Systems, Research and Markets, predicts that “the convergence of access con-
trol technologies with other security systems, like biometric and video surveil-
lance equipment, are likely to witness a colossal demand with an approximate
annual growth rate of around 37 percent around the world by 2009.” 
Various industries and government agencies are embracing the technical transformation
from analog to digital solutions over IP network application areas ranging from video to
access control; incremental value that integration brings when all security systems are man-

aged at the enterprise level—for example, intrusion, access control, asset management,
Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC), and legacy applications such as human
resources ERP tools. For example, most intelligent buildings sense or manage several vari-
ables, or manage more than one building system, extracting greater performance than several
disconnected building systems could achieve. Some form of network, or integrated informa-
tion system, seems to be required for a building to be called “intelligent.” Simple thermostats
are not considered intelligent, and neither are quite complex HVAC and cogeneration sys-
tems. Companies designing intelligent building systems are on the forefront of the security
convergence concept.
Hirsch Electronics:
Convergence and the Intelligent Building
Hirsch Electronics Corp., of Santa Ana, California, manufactures high-security access control
and security management systems for global markets. Its products are installed worldwide in
government, education, military, and commercial industries. Hirsch is on the leading edge of
the convergence of security products and technology to deploy solutions for the future of
the intelligent building market.The company understands the potential impact of Web ser-
vices to facilitate interoperability between devices such as intelligent controllers manufac-
tured by two different access control vendors. Web services will also enable diverse building
control systems such as HVAC systems, lighting systems, and access control systems to swap
data and automate operational decisions.
A Hirsch white paper describes the following scenario.A tenant or employee enters his
building after hours by presenting a card to a reader, or entering a code on the keypad, at the
main entrance.At that point, several things happen.The door unlocks.The HVAC system is
notiﬁed that the individual’s ofﬁce on the ﬁfth ﬂoor needs to have its temperature set points
changed to normal occupancy values so that the individual is comfortable when he arrives.
The lighting system is notiﬁed to turn on the appropriate lights for the ofﬁce area on the
ﬁfth ﬂoor so that the individual feels safe. Property management or the accounting depart-
ment is notiﬁed of the exact time when the individual enters and leaves the building, so the
company can be billed for after-hours energy usage. Everyone beneﬁts. In short, Web ser-
vices will make computers, servers, and microprocessor-controlled devices start, stop, and
report automatically. IT experts compare the signiﬁcance of Web services to the arrival of
the World Wide Web a decade ago.
In order to embrace the future of convergence, Hirsch understands the requirement to
embrace new technology platforms such as XML to provide interoperability. XML is a
common language, one that all microprocessor-controlled devices can be made to under-
stand. It is a tool that opens up network communications among dissimilar systems and
enables them to interoperate.Although application program interfaces (APIs) are also a way
for applications to interface with each other, they represent the old way of doing things.
XML and Web services are the future. With XML, an access control system’s intelligent
boards can share data with the HVAC system controller, the lighting controller, and all the
www.syngress.com
178
Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

other building control systems. More important, XML combines communications capability
with command capability. When the access control system tells the HVAC system that the
occupant of ofﬁce 700 has carded in on Saturday afternoon, the HVAC system responds
with a command to its devices:Turn on the heat in ofﬁce 700.“XML is around ﬁve years
old,” says Rob Zivney, vice president of marketing with Hirsch Electronics.“But many
people are just learning about it. I think we’ll begin to see products using XML come to
market soon—probably as early as ISC West next spring (2007).”
As intelligence and capabilities migrate to edge devices, a period is emerging in which
we can integrate and control just about every aspect of a business—telecommunications, net-
work and Internet access, HVAC control, elevator control, physical access, and video surveil-
lance. Only the end user’s needs and the designer or integrator’s knowledge and abilities
limit the list. Pushing intelligence to the edge devices will be the future of convergence in
the security sector. Security is increasingly challenged to create solutions that are cost-effec-
tive and provide much-needed ROI, while also reducing the total long-term investment in
the overall security operation.
Security systems integration and convergence into the information technology/informa-
tion systems (IT/IS) space have made a dramatic impact on creating these efﬁciencies and
enhancing the overall capabilities of the security operation. Hirsch Electronics points out
that if the facility were conﬁgured with RFID access points, we could not only perform all
the aforementioned functions automatically, but also know the physical position of personnel
at any given time and automatically follow them through the facility while opening doors
and elevators, adjusting heating and cooling, and shutting areas off instantaneously as appro-
priate. It all sounds very sci-ﬁ, but it is in fact well within our reach today. Such RFID inte-
gration makes for much more dramatic cost saving on lighting, heating, and cooling and
gives the user a higher level of comfort and convenience in addition to the security implica-
tions of knowing where personnel are at all times. With HVAC systems accounting for
nearly 40 percent of the energy used in commercial buildings in the United States, this is an
important opportunity to push the bounds of integration and to leverage the advantages of
system control over the network.As security convergence migrates into areas as personal as
our ofﬁces and living spaces, the technologies converge and become pervasive. Convergence
is a technology phase that has a long history, and as it embraces security policy, it is rapidly
changing traditional ideas about how we secure assets—physical, electronic, and personal.
The Challenges of Convergence:
Positioning to Embrace Change
According to the 2006 VARBusiness Market Insight report, 49.2 percent of midsize compa-
nies ranked security infrastructure as their top spending priority in the coming year, followed
by networking infrastructure at 45.8 percent, and backup and data recovery at 45.5 percent.
The next-highest priority was another security-related ﬁeld, regulatory compliance, at 33.2
percent.

The state of security convergence shows a spotlight on the new skill sets required of
network integrators and solution providers when positioning security solutions within the
global enterprise.Typically, traditional physical security integrators have skill sets that are
appropriate to security departments and in many cases have a history of silo installations and
proprietary product lines.
IT integrators, on the other hand, have the technical skills sets required for networking
and storage expertise but lack the hands-on knowledge of installation physical security sys-
tems such as access control and video surveillance networks. Recognizing technical and busi-
ness trends is an important skill in answering the opportunities that security convergence
will offer companies and integrators moving forward. When hockey great Wayne Gretsky
was asked about his game strategy, he replied,“I skate to where the puck is going to be.” He
could see the ice and anticipate, based on experience, how things were going to unfold. By
positioning himself in the right place to succeed, he broke every scoring record in hockey.
Similarities exist between sports and business history. It seems that the greatest players,
teams, CEOs, and corporations rise to the challenge of changing environments and leverage
new opportunities to their advantage.Andy Grove, founder and former CEO of Intel
Corporation, is a case in point. He is one of the true pioneers of the Silicon Valley and a
high-tech industry icon. He has decades of experience in addressing technical convergence
issues and is keenly alert to major trends.“I’m a great believer in particularly being alert to
changes that change something, anything, by an order of magnitude, and nothing operates
with the factors of 10 as profoundly as the Internet.”
Just as Grove has his radar up to detect meaningful changes in the technical landscape,
venture capitalists are keenly aware of the change the security industry is going through in
regard to capital investments.As established businesses, such as Cisco and IBM, recognize
these important trends in technology and investment in the security market, they develop
business strategies to capitalize on these events and in so doing change the structure of the
sales and support channels they control and which provide direction to the entire IT
industry.Traditional physical security providers see new buying relationships in their cus-
tomer accounts and sense the new competitive threats from nontraditional sources, which in
turn impacts their strategies and channel relationships.A convergence of trends from ﬁnan-
cial investments to federal budgets and international events is setting the wave of security
convergence in motion.
In today’s environment, several technology areas are promoting major changes impacting
the future of security convergence. IDC research tells us that today worldwide Web hosting
revenues are more than $20 billion annually, wireless communications represents a $46 billion
plus annual market, and the revenues from Linux open source software development will
grow from $15 billion in 2006 to more than $37 billion in 2008. In the summer of 2006,
laptop sales surpassed those of PCs for the ﬁrst time.These trends point to the development
of next-generation applications hosted on wireless devices accessing real-time search engines
and databases. GPSs, sensors, and open source software will provide instant video, voice, and
data services over IP.They represent just a few of the “Big” changes that will change some-
thing “Big” in the security convergence model moving forward.These new technical break-

throughs will be critical to new-product developments and the skill sets required of the inte-
gration channel to deploy these technologies.
The future belongs to companies/integrators, which correctly anticipate trends and
quickly respond to new business opportunities by creating partnerships.As technology
advances, it becomes impossible to have all the expertise required in-house.The ability to
develop solutions to customer problems through collaboration with partners is what drives a
successful convergence business model.The fact is that large IT vendors require a limited
scope of partnerships.The rationale is that as the largest IT manufacturers enter the security
convergence market, they need to partner with only perhaps 20 percent of their physical
security industry peers to be successful.
This partnership strategy is based on accelerating their own time to market to aggres-
sively compete against other IT manufacturers. IBM worries more about beating HP to the
security convergence market than it does that Honeywell will be too formidable a com-
petitor over time.As mentioned earlier, the traditional physical security market is late to
address the convergence opportunity through partnerships.Additionally, these IT vendors are
focused on emerging software ﬁrms developing open system solutions and leveraging tech-
nical trends to deploy wide area security solutions.These huge IT organizations (Cisco
Systems, IBM, HP, Microsoft, Oracle, EMC) already have worldwide sales and support orga-
nizations, leading-edge R& D staffs with plenty of cash on hand, and established end-user
relationships at executive levels. Security convergence to the IT industry represents a new,
high-growth market opportunity that aligns nicely with the technology sweet spots of enter-
prise infrastructure, new innovative solutions, and integration services.
The Pareto Principal originated in 1906 from Italian economist Vilfredo Prateto’s obser-
vation that essentially said 20 percent of the wealthy owned 80 percent of the land. It has
been modiﬁed through the decades and today we understand it as basically 20 percent of the
people/tasks are vital and the remaining 80 percent are trivial.
This principal also accurately reﬂects the current and future states of the security con-
vergence market.The largest vendors on both sides of the convergence model are deploying
strategies for security convergence. Five years from now, 80 percent of the traditional physical
security vendors, large and small, and their channel partners will be marginalized or out of
business totally if they do not upgrade their IT skills.They will be displaced by the acceler-
ated focus on open systems, standards, and ROI models being promoted by IT vendors and
increasingly being purchased by their decades-long contacts within IT and senior manage-
ment. Major IT vendors control the enterprise purchase cycle.Agree or disagree, the funny
thing about the 80/20 rule is that basically everybody thinks he is in the top 20 percent.
This, of course, is impossible. One of the key attributes to being in the top 20 percent
minority is the ability to recognize and adapt to changing business conditions.This involves a
cultural shift within an organization that is not easy to execute, and in fact, is more difﬁcult
than simply introducing a new product strategy.
Coupled with the ability to recognize change as opportunity and deﬁne a culture that
embraces it quickly is the requirement to differentiate one’s product, people, and company
during these transition periods. One critical element of this process is education.The ability

to make sense of the complexity behind quickly converging technologies and position a
company and its base of customers and partners to adapt successfully is critical. Educating
your internal organization to act as a trusted advisor during periods of technical transition
and industry changes can position a ﬁrm as a thought leader.This ability seems to be
apparent is many of the 20 percent club and the partners they select.
Large high-technology vendors have executed a business model of introducing new
solutions to improve their customers’ business practices while simultaneously upgrading the
infrastructure to allow those new solutions to operate effectively. It is no surprise that the
voice, video, and data over IP strategy that Cisco deploys will require more bandwidth and
networking gear. Or that the security surveillance and video mining applications that IBM
promotes will require large IBM blade server conﬁgurations and multiple terabytes of
storage. Network bandwidth, storage, CPU, cache memory, whatever the problem—IT ven-
dors and their huge sales channels have an upgrade strategy for it. One key point is that this
is predicated upon a three-year product depreciation cycle by which the IT industry sets its
internal clock.
Along the way, the IT vendors have even assisted in the creation of new technology posi-
tions and career paths within their client organizations. Network, storage, database, and system
administrator positions have provided a promotional ladder to vice president titles and chief
information ofﬁcer (CIO) positions.This personnel situation evolved over decades and pro-
vides IT vendors a unique selling advantage in regard to product evaluations, requests for pro-
posals, and ultimately, purchase decisions.This position is enhanced as more responsibility for
security solutions migrates toward the CIO organization in search of a senior-level executive
to drive policy across the executive ranks.Although the IT industry vendors aggressively com-
pete with one another in this environment, this sales cycle is new to the traditional physical
security vendor.With the decision point moving toward the IT department, these security
vendors need partnerships not just to collaborate on solutions, but to leverage these IT
partner buying relationships. Enterprise security policy is focusing on alignment with and
deployment over the worldwide IP network and IT storage infrastructure.
One important aspect to successful partnerships is having some resident support exper-
tise in the basic technologies behind networking and storage.This is a major credibility
factor in securing a revenue-generating partnership in phase one. However, far too many
organizations ignore the initial phase of hiring resident expertise in the physical or IT disci-
pline to provide the needed experience required for successful third-party collaboration.This
reﬂects a fundamental lack of understanding of the mutual beneﬁt behind successful part-
nering. Collaboration is more than sharing industry expertise. It is the equal distribution of
resources dedicated to bringing in the business. If your initial attempts to recruit meaningful
partnerships expose a lack of resource commitment, this is a direct reﬂection upon a lack of
genuine interest on the part of your executive management. Convergence success requires
leadership and commitment to new markets and new resources.At the end of the day,
strategic partnerships will provide the opportunity for large enterprise deployments of secu-
rity solutions.This increases the visibility of security and brings the value of security conver-
gence into clear focus for the senior management of the company.

Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

The reason to care about security convergence is that it represents a huge market oppor-
tunity in a critical area that is virtually untapped in regard to the leveraging IT across WANs.
The physical security industry is currently transitioning from a historically analog infrastruc-
ture to the new IT infrastructure based on IP.As cell phone and iPod technologies illustrate,
we are just in the beginning stages of understanding how powerful, miniature computing
devices, mass deployed and hosting new and yet to be invented solutions, will be utilized. It
is a truly exciting time to be at this apex of security convergence—perhaps just in time to
secure people, property, and assets from the increasing threats of fraud, violence, and ter-
rorism being confronted on a global scale.
In general, security convergence plays to the strengths of the IT industry: buying rela-
tionships, infrastructure understanding, faster product development cycles, better sales organi-
zations, and innovation embedded into a corporate culture.Technical convergence has an
established track record across most of the internal departments in the corporation.Although
these statements point to deﬁnitive advantages of IT as an industry and department within a
corporation, one fact is clear: Security can turn to these inherent advantages to leverage and
accelerate security policy across the organization.
The Emergence of the CIO and 
Its Impact on Security Convergence
Over time, most major companies evolve their technology deployments and how they select
new products and vendors.At the same time, it is important to track the evolution of speciﬁc
executive positions and how they correspond in kind with those technology cycles.
A review of IT history tracks the evolution of the vice president of information tech-
nology (technologist) to the chief information ofﬁcer (executive) position.This is critical to
understand because as the position changed, so did the vendor-selling strategy, from bits and
bytes to ROI and government mandates. Continuing to stress speeds and feeds over business
issues, or not understanding the economic beneﬁts of open IT infrastructure, will not
advance the security convergence cause within the organization.The evolution of tech-
nology and the positions of the people who deploy it say a lot about how security solutions
will evolve to meet the growing threat of corporate risk.
Essentially, the IT career path tracked the advances and the pace of the technology itself.
As information became more of a productivity-enhancing tool, it became more closely asso-
ciated with corporate revenues.As such, it increasingly reached across the organization and
outward into its supply chain partners to improve business operations across an ever-wider
scale.This increased the impact of the technology on all business operations and extended
the visibility of the IT department, its management, and its chief executive.The politics of
the position also became more powerful, and today, CIOs are usually executive staff positions
at the upper levels of the company or government agency hierarchy.Today the CIO has a
complete understanding of all of the various internal business operations and external part-
nerships his technology department impacts.As such, aside from the CEO, the CIO may be
www.syngress.com
The Evolution of Global Security Systems • Chapter 6
183

in the best strategic position to understand the operations of the company worldwide. Based
on this business understanding, the CIO position may prove to be an ideal launching pad
into the CEO suite in the years to come.
Although the CIO has an increasingly powerful position within the corporate hierarchy,
the continuing visibility on all things security-related can also elevate the chief security ofﬁcer
(CSO) position to executive-level status provided the person has the business skill sets
required.Although the IT organization needs a physical security education, a CSO “skill set
upgrade” is also required. Not only does the security ofﬁcer need to understand IT policy,
procedures, and infrastructure issues, but he also must have an in-depth understanding of the
respective business units and how they operate.The CSO must drive security policy into all
internal departments across the global enterprise as well as collaborate externally with part-
ners, suppliers, government agencies, and even foreign governments.The soft skills of business
acumen, tact, and political leverage will be job requirements within the executive circle as
security policy takes a more visible and global role within organizations in the years ahead.
Jeff Kessler, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers, is the leading security industry
analyst on Wall Street. He co-hosts the annual Securing New Ground Conference for secu-
rity industry executives and luminaries to discuss business trends. His comments at the 2006
event reﬂected both an industry and a CSO position in transition:“Convergence is real.
There is a redeﬁnition of the existing security paradigm, and a big trend is the development
of the CSO position.” In fact, the Lehman Brothers organization was presented as an
example of a converged operation consisting of equal parts IT and physical security—a col-
laborative relationship whereby IT standards and integration drive security policy and solu-
tions across the worldwide operation.
Art Coviello, president and CEO at RSA Security (EMC) and co-chair of the
Corporate Governance Task Force, states,“It is the ﬁduciary responsibility of senior manage-
ment in organizations to take reasonable steps to secure their information systems.
Information security is not just a technology issue, it is also a corporate governance issue.”
Adequate security is about managing risk. Governance and risk management are inextricably
linked—governance is an expression of responsible risk management, and effective risk man-
agement requires efﬁcient governance.
Just as the buying decisions for security solutions are changing from independent
departmental installation(s) and/or stand-alone (silo) island mentalities, so too are the actual
number of vendors combining to answer enterprise requirements. Cross-industry partner-
ships and merger and acquisition activity are becoming normal operating procedures for
companies that want to quickly capitalize on security convergence. Examples of these funda-
mental “channel changes” are occurring every month and have been accelerating throughout
the calendar year. We list them here, in no particular order of importance:

(Cover Story, VARBusiness)
Let’s review:
■
A major IT gorilla, Cisco Systems, continues to buy leading-edge technology ﬁrms
in the sweet spot of the physical security market.This trend continues.
■
A former, yet still formidable, IT gorilla, Sun Microsystems, is partnering with a
major physical security provider, GE Security, to establish OEM ties and sell solu-
tions through mutual channels to Fortune 100 and large government agency
accounts.
■
One of the largest IT distributors worldwide, with a $20+ billion business and
more than 90,000 customers has established a security convergence business unit
(SBU) to assist IT integrators in selling physical security products.
■
The cover story in VARBusiness (a leading publication for IT VARs) warns its
large IT integrator subscriber base not to miss the new and growing opportunities
that security convergence offers their businesses.
The focus on the security convergence opportunity by large IT vendors and their global
channel partners is changing the way security products are positioned and sold within enter-
prise accounts.This is a critical and fundamental step toward elevating the traditional security
role to a decision cycle higher in the organization, and in alignment with existing IT infras-
tructure.This process will impact how future security products are developed and sold,
directly and indirectly, into larger global opportunities. Sales channel strategies and follow-on
integration and consulting services will also be affected as new channel competitors enter
the traditional physical security market and focus on their core IT strengths in network,
storage, and integration. In order to position quickly for the security convergence market
opportunity, companies from both traditional security and IT markets are deploying aggres-
sive merger and acquisition strategies:
■
In August, L1 Identity Solutions was established as a business entity resulting from
the combined acquisitions of biometrics software players Viisage Technology,
Identix Inc., Integrated Biometric Technologies, SecuriMetrics, and Iridian. L1
Solutions has a market cap of approximated $1 billion.

■
Also in August, IBM announced a $1.3 billion acquisition of ISS, a publicly held
ﬁrm based in Atlanta. ISS products protect against Internet threats aimed at net-
works, desktops, and servers and are installed in more than 11,000 worldwide
companies and governments.This purchase effectively launches the Global Services
Security Division into the managed security services business.
■
In September, EMC Corporation completed the purchase of RSA Security for
$2.1 billion and announced a $150 million acquisition of Network Intelligence.
EMC’s chairman, president, and CEO, Joe Tucci, announced,“The additions of
RSA and Network Intelligence to the EMC family enable us to execute on our
informationcentric security strategy to help organizations around the world secure
their information throughout its product life cycle and reduce the associated cost
of regulatory compliance.”
■
Finally, as the year 2006 concludes, Siemens Building Technologies decided to pur-
chase VistaScape Security Systems, a leading developer of automated video ana-
lytics software designed to protect critical infrastructure from a broad spectrum of
threats.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the strategic intent is obvious.
What the headlines reﬂect on a continuous basis is an industry convergence between
physical security and IT that is simultaneously changing the competitive landscape. New
roles and responsibilities within major corporations are changing the traditional purchasing
cycles for security products and impacting vendor-selling relationships.A new era of collabo-
ration is accelerating the trend in cross-industry partnering. In addition to this, an active
merger and acquisition cycle is evident in the physical/logical security industry.As Dennis
Moriarty, Senior Vice President for Diebold’s Security Division, states,“The new formula is
to purchase for expertise, not simply scale.”
All this change points to a need for substantially upgrading to new skill sets across orga-
nizations within both industries to accelerate deployment of a consistent security policy
across the enterprise.Although cultural differences between physical security and IT con-
tinue to exist, executive management demands cooperation in providing a cost-effective
security solution.This fact is not lost on either department. Whether the solution is video
surveillance, access control, or the broader area of enterprise security management, security
solutions now cross multiple corporate departments and require collaboration.The career-
limiting decision for department heads is now not to collaborate. With the merging of busi-
ness interests (and budgets) between the traditional security organization, IT, ﬁnance, and just
about every department in the company with a security concern, the ability to promote
cooperation and mutual interest is a key management talent. By demonstrating an under-
standing of the larger security issues facing the overall business and detailing a compelling
ROI, a security policy can become a value add to the corporation.
The age-old problem with this model is that the centerpiece of the strategy is change.
History tells us that organizations steadily and sometimes staunchly oppose anything new. In
this business environment, it is your executive leadership and middle management that win
www.syngress.com
186
Chapter 6 • The Evolution of Global Security Systems

the business battle. In the era of security convergence, the winners recognize industry change
early and execute new strategies quickly.
Conclusion 
As stated earlier, the larger issue global corporations face is an “extreme risk” scenario,
described Dr. James Canton in his recent book, The Extreme Future.This is essentially a new
state of security where organizations must prepare against the real possibility of a major ter-
rorist attack against our country and economy (read supply chains) or natural disaster
(Hurricane Katrina), while simultaneously our traditional risks to people and assets (physical
and digital) are rapidly increasing. Our security risk is compounding annually. It is against
this backdrop that establishing an enterprise security policy within an IT governance model
is critical.As large security initiatives move from big government projects to large commer-
cial enterprises, leading-edge vendors and integrators see security convergence offering huge
opportunities. Information technologies are maturing and global communications standards
are driving new security solutions to protect critical information and infrastructures.
Collaborative workﬂows promise huge productivity gains along with new threats to business
operations. New global risks must be balanced with new global opportunities.
As the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) concluded in its “Convergence
of Enterprise Security Organizations” report (November 2005):“The increasing focus on
security from an enterprise perspective has led to a new way of examining risks that institu-
tions face as a whole.This, in turn, is leading to innovative approaches that emphasize inte-
gration—speciﬁcally, the integration of the risk side of business into the strategic planning
side in a consistent and holistic manner.”The surveys and interviews presented clear evidence
that as leaders in the business, security professionals need to move from a “command and
control” model to an empowering and enabling model, and develop an enterprise-wide view
of risk rather than an asset-based view.As security practitioners experience a collective cul-
tural change in the traditional model of security, they have something in common with their
CEOs and board members.
The post-September 11 era has redeﬁned the meaning of risk to global businesses.At
the CEO and board of directors level, the new concerns range from government regulations,
to cyber crime, to terrorism.The risks are never-ending and the ability to proactively prevent
and respond to business threats requires more strategic thinking than ever before. Corporate
reputations, careers, lives, and the stock valuations of these global organizations hang in the
balance.The ability to effectively execute a security convergence strategy around a business
plan has never been more difﬁcult or required so much leadership.
U.S. Navy Admiral Grace Hopper, a pioneering advocate of computer systems and infor-
mation technologies, perhaps said it best:“Life was simple before World War II.After that, we
had systems.” She could have been describing security. One thing is certain: Even the
Admiral would have had trouble imagining today’s extreme level of corporate risk.

Twenty-First-Century Risk: Physical and
Electronic Security Collaboration
The recent book Breakpoint is a ﬁctional account of a coordinated attack against the United
States. It involves the use of direct physical and electronic measures aimed at critical systems,
networks, and individuals.The author is Richard Clarke, former national coordinator for
Security and Counterterrorism, advisor to the president for Cyberspace Security, and
chairman of the president’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.
When it comes to threats and risk scenarios based upon direct experience involving
physical and electronic security, you would be hard-pressed to ﬁnd someone with equal
expertise.The book takes place in 2012, and is interesting from a security standpoint and
thought-provoking regarding the social issues arising from the integration of IT and life sci-
ences.The attacks upon the global communications infrastructure begin with bomb blasts at
critical network router locations along the East Coast, and the simultaneous destruction of
undersea ﬁber optics cables.The cyber penetrations target Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems,1 causing gas explosions at key computing facilities, nation-
wide power outages, and attacks upon communications satellites.Additional physical attacks
involve the use of both individual suicide bombers and coordinated teams penetrating secu-
rity points with 18-wheel trucks.
This ﬁctional account is terrifying and at the same time provides a sobering realization
that the coordination of our physical and electronic security defenses needs priority status on
a global basis. Securing operations will involve the close working relationships of numerous
government agencies (international, domestic, state, and local), as well as global corporations
and their supply chain partners.The book details one possible “worst case” risk assessment.
Depending upon the type of government agency, military base, defense contractor, or busi-
ness entity (critical infrastructure) involved, these speciﬁc types of threats will have various
degrees of credibility.
For example, the ﬁnancial industry may not be as concerned with loss of life on a daily
basis as it is with the loss of revenue due to fraud, or the negative impact on corporate repu-
tation due to identity theft. However, the ﬁnancial industry has been and will continue to be
the target of terrorist plans to kill citizens and destroy infrastructure, as the September 11
attacks symbolized.As a result, the ﬁnancial community is leading commercial industry in
the effort to protect employees and secure physical and electronic assets with double-digit
increases in annual funding for security-related expenditures.The ability to leverage innova-
tive technology with security policy provides these institutions the capability to better miti-
gate risk scenarios across the global enterprise. It is no wonder that many of the leading
information technologists and security professionals migrate to the ﬁnancial services sector
for employment opportunities.
Although the story in Breakpoint is ﬁctional, the Madrid bombings and other attacks used
a combination of the aforementioned techniques and are often referred to as blended attacks,
whereby you blend technical with physical attacks.Wikipedia explains that the 2004 Madrid
www.syngress.com
190
Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

train bombings consisted of a series of coordinated bombings against the commuter train
system of Madrid, on the morning of March 11, 2004, killing 191 people and wounding
2,050.The perpetrators were local Islamic extremists and two Guardia Civil and Spanish
police informants. It is the only terrorist act in history, according to the European Strategic
Intelligence and Security Center, in which non-Muslims collaborated with Muslims.
During the peak of Madrid rush hour on the morning of March 11, 10 explosions
occurred aboard four commuter trains.All the affected trains were traveling on the same line
and in the same direction between Alcalá de Henares and Atocha station in Madrid. It was
later reported that 13 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had been placed on the trains.
Bomb-disposal teams had dealt with two of the remaining three IEDs.
This new era of threat blends physical and cyber attacks into the risk assessments which
security and IT professionals must address continuously. It is a convergence that involves
both a security policy and the applicable technologies to effectively execute it. It is against
this new threat-level backdrop that government regulations and programs have been enacted
to ensure commercial industry compliance within a wide range of security programs ranging
from ﬁnancial reporting (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [SOX]) to protecting global supply
chains.
The capability of security solutions to be deployed quickly across a wide spectrum of
the global economy is critical to ensure that the nation’s 361 ports are seen by most security
experts as attractive targets for a terrorist attack because they are so vital to the country’s
economy.As recently reported by the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), our
public ports are thriving gateways to international trade and economic prosperity. In fact,
America’s seaports are responsible for $2 trillion in annual trade revenue, providing nearly 5
million people with jobs.That makes ports an invaluable force in spurring local, state, and
national economic growth. It is no small wonder that some of the most advanced security
technologies, from surveillance systems to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) detection
devices, are deployed at seaports.The maritime industry is also at the forefront of a global
partnership between government and industry as the primary emphasis in port security has
gone from preventing cargo theft, to protecting people and facilities from terrorism.
Besides the monetary impact, ports also provide an easy way to gain access to a country
by bypassing much of the scrutiny that is deployed at airports, which is the traditional way
into a country. Examples of port security initiatives affecting global trade include (The
Conference Board) the following:
■
Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) A voluntary pro-
gram in which participants implement security measures throughout the supply
chain.
■
The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) A self-regulation to
improve the security of ports, done in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard.
■
Advanced Notice of Arrival (ANOA)  A Customs and Boarder Protection
(CBP) rule requiring advance notiﬁcation of cargo with the U.S. Coast Guard.
www.syngress.com
Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value • Chapter 7
191

■
Container Security Initiative (CSI)  A CBP effort to secure cargo beyond
U.S. ports by identifying high-risk containers through prescreening and tamper-
proof technology.
■
Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) Designed to fully automate
the system of tracking commercial import and export data.The Framework of
Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade is being adapted by the World
Customs Organization (WCO) and is focusing on security standards as a means to
enhance global trade through automation and new detection technologies.
When reviewing the port security initiatives detailed in the preceding list, one cannot
help but spot a new trend in law enforcement and security communities: collaboration. It is
an aspect we will continue to focus on in this book because of the critical role it plays in the
development of innovative security products and the new policies and procedures based on
shared responsibilities among global security agencies. In fact, the development and deploy-
ment of the fusion center concept (a mechanism to exchange information and intelligence
among multiple agencies) is in some ways a response to criticisms leveled at U.S. agencies for
“a lack of imagination” and limited intelligence sharing in reviewing pre-September 11
operations.The initiatives reﬂect the underlying need for automation and standards required
for the global collaboration to counter terrorism and crime.The C-TPAT, MTSA,ANOA,
CSI, and ACE examples of security guidelines will be integrated with corporate security
departments and their partners to protect and defend the global supply chains which fuel the
international commerce engine.
Additional industry-speciﬁc security guidelines have been developed in ﬁnancial ser-
vices, IT, and the chemical industries.These government and industry initiatives point toward
a proactive security mindset and underscore the urgent requirement for technical conver-
gence between physical and electronic security solutions.The need to accurately determine
the threat level and appropriate risk response is one area of concern for government agency
heads, commercial executives, and their boards of directors. Key operational responsibilities
rest within both physical security and IT management in these organizations.
Increasingly, government is assisting industry with the tools and methodologies for ana-
lyzing risk and vulnerability across all sectors of the economy.These methods are embracing
technology standards and new collaboration models to leverage and coordinate the various
professional skill sets of multiple organizations.This effort will raise productivity levels and
simultaneously provide a higher level of safety and protection to people and assets, both
physical and electronic, and will provide a benchmark of best practices.The issue is one of
deployment times, and how to accelerate security practices globally within a program that
has a major “voluntary” component to it on the part of private industry.
World events may dictate whether today’s voluntary security initiatives become manda-
tory security regulations in the future.The good news is that a serious collaboration between
government and industry is taking place concerning global security practices. We provide
examples of this collaboration later in the chapter, where we detail the various security
industry associations that are taking a leadership role in deﬁning speciﬁc standards to accel-

erate partnerships with groups both internal and external to organizations that have not had
a history of working together.
This convergence extends to legacy systems, software, and security procedures that are
antiquated and require much-needed innovative thinking regarding product development
and industry collaboration. One example of a commercial organization working with gov-
ernment to secure the global supply chain is Unisys Corporation, a $5.76 billion worldwide
technology services and solutions company, with a long history of advising major corpora-
tions, federal agencies, and governments in the use of technology to advance global e-com-
merce initiatives.The Trusted Enterprise Model is being deployed in collaboration with
Unisys partners and these client organizations to protect these commercial supply chains by
leveraging the convergence of physical and electronic security solutions with technical inno-
vations.The trusted enterprise approaches security and risk management as a proactive
strategy that can build trust rather than as a purely defensive measure. It combines the best of
physical and logical products and strategies with management best practices.
Homeland Security
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established November 25, 2002 with the
responsibility of protecting the United States from terrorist attack and coordinating responses
to natural disasters.The DHS works with civilian and government agencies to protect our
borders, and with more than 184,000 employees and a 2006 budget of more than $41 bil-
lion, it is the third largest cabinet department in the federal government.
RAMCAP
One example of a DHS effort promoting government/industry collaboration is Risk
Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP), a program initiated by
DHS.The objective is for DHS to provide funding and to act as a facilitator on the develop-
ment of speciﬁc modules for industry sectors to best identify, analyze, and quantify risk
assessment practices.The actual modules would be created by the private sector, drawing
upon a combination of business executives and technical professionals, security practitioners,
academics, professional and trade association members, and industry consultants.The results
would be the publication of security standards, establishing consistent business terminology
and measurement metrics, and essentially providing a consistent approach to determining
risk and vulnerability assessment across industries.
RAMCAP promotes industry understanding of the various vulnerabilities that may lead
terrorists to select a particular target, and then provides operators of these critical infrastruc-
tures with methods to evaluate the options and prevent actual attacks. DHS is compiling a
baseline risk assessment of the entire U.S. critical infrastructure.The intent of DHS is to
encourage the early use of simple processes to report best practices and distribute essential
risk information across multiple at-risk industry segments.

■
RAMCAP is targeting the following nine sectors:
■
Nuclear power plants
■
Nuclear fuel storage facilities
■
Chemical plants
■
Petroleum reﬁneries
■
Liqueﬁed natural gas
■
Subway systems
■
Railroad systems
■
Highway systems
■
Power generation and transmission facilities 
RAMCAP is composed of integrated steps to evaluate the threat potential, vulnerability,
and possibility of a successful attack and its consequences. It is a collaborative process
between private ownership and DHS to mitigate risk from both physical and electronic
attacks against critical infrastructure. One industry sector that is providing leadership around
RAMCAP risk initiatives is the Chemical Sector Cyber Security Program.“The program is
energized by the progress we have made since 2002 in providing guidance to assist compa-
nies, increasing chemical company participation, and establishing a relationship with the
Department of Homeland Security,” says Neil Hershﬁeld, director of the Chemical Sector
Cyber Security Program and co-chair of its steering team.“Our goal is to try to be one step
ahead. Evolving to keep up with the ever-changing IT threat landscape is a signiﬁcant part
of that effort.”
The program continues to focus on ﬁve key initiatives:
■
Fostering involvement and commitment across the sector 
■
Maintaining a robust public affairs program 
■
Encouraging the adoption of established risk-based practices and guidance 
■
Strengthening the industry’s information-sharing network 
■
Encouraging the acceleration of improved security technology for chemical com-
panies.
The steering team prepared the 2006 strategy by incorporating input from ChemITC

the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council, which represents 16 chemical industry trade
associations, showing their commitment to enhancing security throughout the sector.“With
four years of dedication to cyber security, the sector continues to share with other industries
the vision of better securing our nation’s ‘virtual borders’ from ongoing threats,” says David
Kepler, chairman of ChemITC’s executive board.“With our renewed strategy in place, we

can continue to enhance our cyber security stature and demonstrate our sector’s leadership,
paving the way for other industries to follow.”The meeting where the 2006 strategy was
unveiled brought together chemical company CIOs and senior-level IT executives from both
current and prospective member companies.
RAMCAP is an innovative process for security policy based upon global risk assessment
in collaboration with DHS.As the deﬁnition, or characterization, of risk is changing with
the introduction of new IT innovations (global and collaborative cyber terrorism) and phys-
ical destructiveness (WMD), this creates a cascading effect on security activities.As a result,
vulnerability analysis must now involve new thinking along worst-case scenarios and innova-
tive attack proﬁles, or combinations of attacks (cyber and physical), that were not considered
viable pre-September 11.The September 11 commission mentioned “a failure of imagination,”
and this situation cannot be repeated by global counterterrorism organizations, government
agencies, or commercial businesses owning critical infrastructure.An elevation of terrorist
planning resulting in successful attacks (electronic, physical, or blended) paralyzing a major
city or shutting down operations at one or several seaports would result in ﬁnancial and soci-
etal ramiﬁcations exceeding the coordinated attacks on September 11.The process of risk
management has been elevated in its critical importance in this new threat scenario and
shows no signs of leveling off moving forward.
The RAMCAP model steps an owner/operator through seven categories of risk deﬁni-
tion and assessment:
■
Asset characterization Asset identiﬁcation, assessment of potential severity of
consequences, and consequence-based screening
■
Threat characterization Target determination, adversary characterization, and
threat characterization
■
Consequence analysis Potential damage assessment for each threat, and worst
reasonable consequences
■
Vulnerability analysis Identiﬁcation and assessment of vulnerabilities leading to
worst reasonable consequences, and evaluation of existing countermeasures and
mitigation capability
■
Threat assessment Asset attractiveness and deterrence (owner), adversary capa-
bility and intent determination (DHS), and threat as a function of attractiveness
and adversary capability (DHS)
■
Risk assessment Consequences times vulnerabilities times threat
■
Risk management Consideration of risks, goals, and need for recommendations,
determination of recommendations, evaluation of options, and decision concerning
enhancements

Mitigating the Issue of Security
As global risks have escalated in recent years, the capability of physical security and IT orga-
nizations to mitigate these issues has been a growing concern. In constantly attempting to
address current and mounting threats to physical and electronic assets, there is little time
and/or resources to respond proactively. It is the proverbial “ﬁnger in the dike” situation
whereby no sooner is one problem addressed than another materializes to occupy available
time and resources.
As a result of being forced into a reactive response role, security operations, physical and
logical, have been relegated to “tactical” status. It is becoming increasingly difﬁcult to get a
strategic view of security policy across a global operation.Yet this is exactly what is required
for businesses to operate in a global economy.Today’s supply chains connect the largest and
the smallest enterprises in a collaborative commerce model, and the threats to ongoing
global business have never been greater.The current situation shows no signs of slowing
down and the policy of business as usual will not scale with the risks of running a successful
business.
The age-old profession of “security” is quickly being transformed into the broader disci-
pline of enterprise risk management.This is not to say that traditional security issues go
away, or become marginalized. In fact, the risk compounds to the point where new skill sets
are required of the security practitioner moving forward. It is a blend of understanding both
the physical and the electronic security issues across the enterprise, and the impact that con-
vergence plays in deploying innovative new solutions.
This merging of security skill sets is only half of the equation, however. Equally impor-
tant, and new in many ways to both physical security and IT management, is a comprehen-
sive understanding of how the business or agency actually operates.A business mentality
requires the ability to align security within the context of bringing value to the business as a
critical component of doing business.The new model must emphasize the point that “busi-
ness without security is out of business.”
This is a message that can be delivered only after one clearly understands how the busi-
ness or agency works from the inside out.The ability to position security as policy within
the organization will demand leadership, negotiation, and persuasion skills at the executive
level. In larger organizations, this ability will extend well beyond the scope of the company
and reach into the supply chain and even foreign governments. Security has evolved past the
point of singular focus and individual deployment mentalities, and into the realm of holistic
risk management. Physical and IT security professionals must collaborate together to answer
security concerns that impact the business as a whole, including outside vendor and partner
relationships.A convergence of these two security disciplines is the only possible way to
counter the onslaught of global risk.
At the core of this effort will be the ability to quickly and effectively integrate security
solutions involving both new innovations and legacy systems into a proactive security model.
The result will be an enterprise security policy integrated into an IT governance model and
distributed globally. Dick Leﬂer, a veteran of the U.S. Secret Service and former CSO at

American Express, believes,“RAMCAP is a major indicator of the future of collaboration
between government agencies and industry regarding security risk.”
The Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)
Program 
Government has a recent history regarding security and commerce in this country, which
continues to the current day.The Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Program is a
Presidential Directive (PDD-63) that calls for a national effort to ensure the security of the
increasingly vulnerable and interconnected infrastructures of the United States. It dates back
to July 1996, when then-President Clinton issued an order stating that certain national
infrastructures are critical to the national and economic security of the United States and the
well-being of its citizenry.The purpose of critical infrastructure protection is to establish a
real-time ability for all sectors of the critical infrastructure community to share information
on the current status of infrastructure elements. Ultimately, the goal is to protect our critical
infrastructure by eliminating known vulnerabilities, but much of the responsibility to fund
that initiative rests on the shoulders of private industry.The national infrastructure sectors
that were identiﬁed as critical include the following:
■
Banking and ﬁnance 
■
Transportation
■
Gas and oil storage and transportation
■
Electrical power systems 
■
Information and telecommunications 
■
Law enforcement/ﬁre/emergency services  
■
Government services (continuity)
■
Emergency health services 
■
National water supply 
The American Heritage Dictionary deﬁnes the term infrastructure as “the basic facilities,
services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as trans-
portation and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions
including schools, post ofﬁces, and prisons.” On July 15, 1996, President Clinton signed
Executive Order 13010 establishing the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection (PCCIP).This Executive Order (EO) deﬁned infrastructure as “the framework of
interdependent networks and systems comprising identiﬁable industries, institutions (including
people and procedures), and distribution capabilities that provide a reliable ﬂow of products
and services essential to the defense and economic security of the United States, the smooth
functioning of government at all levels, and society as a whole.This deﬁnition of infrastructure

Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value • Chapter 7
197

is consistent with the broad deﬁnitions from the 1980s. EO 13010 went further, however, by
prioritizing particular infrastructure sectors, and speciﬁc assets within those sectors, on the
basis of national importance.
Fusion Center Guidelines
The post-September 11 era certainly includes the focus mentioned earlier on seaports, and
would also include threats to the nation’s food supply. It is important to note that these risks
also include unintentional acts of nature and diseases such as bird ﬂu.The HSPD-7 excerpt
in the sidebar titled “Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-7” reﬂects the gov-
ernment’s continued focus on protecting critical infrastructure.
The Challenges of Convergence…
Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-7
Subject: Critical Infrastructure Identiﬁcation, Prioritization, and Protection
This is a presidential directive essentially granting the secretary of DHS
powers to coordinate any and all protection activities for each of the critical
infrastructure sectors: information technology; telecommunications; chemical;
transportation systems, including mass transit, aviation, maritime, ground/sur-
face, and rail and pipeline systems; emergency services; and postal and ship-
ping. The directive also mentions the need to protect other key resources
including dams, government, and commercial facilities. In addition, the order
leaves open-ended the need to determine additional critical infrastructure and
key resources categories over time, as appropriate. Many experts from the
security ﬁeld believe that the voluntary recommendations today to protect
critical infrastructure will lead to mandatory security requirements tomorrow
in the wake of additional attacks on the homeland. This will be the result of
the slow response of commercial industry to invest in protecting critical infras-
tructures, 80 percent of which are privately owned across the country.
Programs like RAMCAP may be the benchmark for government to collaborate
with private industry to mandate the implementation of security policy and
technology.
A fusion center is an efﬁcient mechanism to exchange information and
intelligence to improve the ability to ﬁght crime and terrorism by merging data
from a variety of sources. Fusion centers provide collaboration between various
law enforcement sources and government agencies. The fusion center concept
is one of the core principals behind the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing
Plan (NCISP) that addresses the security and intelligence needs recognized after
the attacks of September 11, 2001. It describes a nationwide communications

capability that will link together all levels of law enforcement personnel,
including ofﬁcers on the streets, intelligence analysts, unit commanders, and
police executives, for the purpose of sharing critical data.
Critical to preventing future terrorist attacks is improving our intelli-
gence capability. [NCISP] will serve as a blueprint as we continue to
develop our overall national strategy for sharing information.—
Director Robert S. Mueller, III, FBI
The Challenges of Convergence…
Fusion Centers: A New Era in Intelligence Collaboration
Another example of government leadership involves the collaboration of state
and local agencies to create guidelines and establish standard processes for
the deployment and operation of fusion centers to provide actionable intelli-
gence from multiple sources of disparate information originating from fed-
eral, state, and local agencies. The objective is to improve communications and
intelligence-gathering capabilities in an effort to analyze data trends to exe-
cute predictive measures to thwart terrorist attack or criminal activity.
In concept, fusion and collaboration mean the same thing. Ultimately,
fusion speaks to a uniﬁed process of streamlining mutual skill sets to rapidly
achieve a combined outcome. A technical example of fusion is Voice over IP
(VoIP); an example from the world of physics is nuclear fusion, an example
from politics is the act of parties occasionally assembling to form a coalition,
and a classic example from music is jazz. Essentially, fusion creates a union of
some type, a mixture or blending of two or more things. The fusion center
concept as it pertains to intelligence gathering has, at its core, the concept of
collaboration. The deﬁnition the Web serves up for a fusion center is as fol-
lows: “in intelligence usage, a physical location to accomplish fusion. It nor-
mally has sufﬁcient intelligence automated data processing capability to assist
in the process.” Fusion is a trend in the IT-literate workforce, which reaches
into the business operations of global corporations and extends to our military
strategies and law enforcement and intelligence gathering agencies. 
The Department of Defense (DoD) deﬁned data fusion as “a multilevel,
multifaceted process dealing with the automatic detection, association, corre-
lation, estimation, and combination of data and information from single or
multiple sources.” The DoD model is based on a hierarchical four-phase
approach, including object reﬁnement, situation reﬁnement, threat reﬁne-

Continued

ment, and process reﬁnement. A simpler description of data fusion is the
blending of data from different sources, including law enforcement, public
safety, and the private sector, resulting in meaningful and actionable intelli-
gence and information. The United States is blessed with the best technologies
on the planet, and with the individuals that possess the innovative vision to
turn unique ideas into commercial realities. Almost 100 percent of our failures
to interoperate, communicate, and collaborate concern people and/or organi-
zational issues (i.e., funding). The technology exists today to improve our
ability as a nation to combine multiple resources throughout various levels of
government to better share and manage intelligence in an effort to protect
the country from acts of terrorism and criminal intent.  
One of the advantages of the convergence of IT with security practices is
that many of the traditional barriers between various agencies in law enforce-
ment, government (national, state, and local), and the private sector are
coming down. The critical need for collaboration among these numerous enti-
ties to ultimately prevent and increasingly respond to terrorist and criminal
activities remains a signiﬁcant challenge. Into this void steps the new concept
of intelligence centers. The fusion center vision resulted from the combined
efforts of several government agencies including the Department of Justice
(DOJ), the Homeland Security Advisory Council (HSAC), the Global Justice
Information Sharing Institute, the FBI, and numerous law enforcement orga-
nizations and public safety agencies. The DOJ and DHS have issued their com-
prehensive 
Fusion 
Center 
Guidelines 
(see 
www.fas.org/irp/agency/
ise/guidelines.pdf), which state that fusion centers are a conduit for imple-
menting portions of the NCISP. The NCISP is regarded as the blueprint for law
enforcement administrators to follow when enhancing or building an intelli-
gence function. It contains more than 25 recommendations and serves as the
foundation for the fusion center intelligence guidelines.
The Fusion Center Guidelines (July 2005, Version 1) deﬁne an effective process as 
follows:
■
The use of common terminology, deﬁnitions, and lexicon by all stakeholders
■
Up-to-date awareness and understanding of the global threat environment
■
A clear understanding of the linkages between terrorism-related and non-ter-
rorism-related information and intelligence
■
Clearly deﬁned intelligence and information requirements that prioritize and
guide planning, collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts
■
Clear delineation of roles, responsibilities, and requirements of each level and
sector of government involved in the fusion process
■
Understanding and elimination of impediments to information collection and
sharing.

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

■
Extensive and continuous interaction with the private sector and with the public
at large
■
Connectivity (technical and/or procedural) with critical intelligence streams, anal-
ysis centers, communication centers, and information repositories
■
Extensive participation of subject-matter experts in the analytical process
■
Capacity to ensure aggressive oversight and accountability so as to protect against
the infringement of constitutional protections and civil liberties
In principal, this collaboration within the law enforcement community will involve a
diverse group with responsibilities on local, regional, and national levels.The ability to net-
work and establish professional relationships will be a key element to a successful program
based on cross-channel communications.This is an important cultural change in some envi-
ronments accustomed to keeping information within the conﬁnes of a particular bureaucracy
and reporting structure.A National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States
(also known as the 9-11 Commission) investigation revealed the need to eliminate this “silo”
(agency) communication mentality in an effort to improve our nation’s ability to ﬁght ter-
rorism.This recommendation rings true in the dual effort of fusion centers to combat crim-
inal activity as well. Several professional associations have been active in the early
development of standard processes for the fusion center concept.These organizations must
also take a leading role in developing and implementing education and training programs for
the fusion centers to reach their full potential. Like any new concept which involves a dif-
ferent work process and interaction with technology, this training must be straightforward,
well supported, and easily accessible via the Web for real-time response to questions to avoid
frustration or duplication of effort.
The Challenges of Convergence…
Case Study: New Jersey State Police
The New Jersey State Police have a vested interest in combating crime and ter-
rorism. An area of northern New Jersey has been called “the most dangerous
two miles in America” by leading terrorism experts. That stretch of land con-
tains a chemical plant processing chlorine gas which the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) estimates could threaten up to 12 million people, and
is just one of dozens of potential targets between Newark Airport and the
Port of Elizabeth.
One unfortunate fact is that the private companies that own 80 percent
of the most dangerous targets in the area have given varying degrees of

Continued

cooperation, and the chemical industry has effectively blocked attempts in
Washington to mandate stricter regulations. Add to this mix the fact that the
state is the most populous in the nation per square mile and you understand
its unique safety and security requirements. 
New Jersey is moving aggressively to expand its version of the fusion
center concept by investing more than $10 million into its Statewide
Intelligence Management System (SIMS) to reach all 650 police agencies
statewide and to extend its training program to ofﬁcers at the academy level.
Captain Steve Serrao, of the New Jersey Ofﬁce of Counterterrorism, explains,
“We learned after 9/11 that we had no statewide system for processing tips
and leads.” Those requirements were developed in 2003 and deployed early in
2004 with the goal of automating the intelligence gathering and communica-
tions abilities of all 40,000 law enforcement personnel across the state.
Currently the system is deployed in 300 of the state’s 600 police departments.
The State Police created a fusion center, the Regional Operations Intelligence
Center (ROIC), which includes an Intelligence Center Unit (ICU) responsible for
the rapid dissemination of information related to homeland security and crim-
inal investigations. Each regional unit is composed of four squads providing
coverage 24/7 and includes two analysts trained to query information from
multiple sources to advance the intelligence-policing concept. Additionally,
the ICUs are providing analytics for the New Jersey Statewide Intelligence
Estimate to aid in strategic planning.
Both the RAMCAP program and the creation of nationwide fusion centers represent a
growing trend toward increased collaboration among government, law enforcement agencies,
and commercial industry to engage the public and private sectors in the deployment of
coordinated security measures. Federal government guidelines for critical infrastructure
industries, such as chemical plants, although voluntary today, may eventually become regula-
tions mandated by law to ensure industry compliance in protecting citizens from the dangers
of accidents or premeditated attacks on those facilities.The rapid growth of fusion centers
across the country provides an example of how converging technical standards are positively
impacting the ability of interoperable data exchange between federal, state, and local agen-
cies. Creative approaches requiring the rapid implementation of standard technologies
around new security policies are changing the very nature of traditional security practices.
New global threats, vulnerabilities, and, ultimately, severe consequences justify a new frame-
work for managing and responding to security risk between the public and private sectors.
Industry Associations: Anticipating
Trends in the Global Security Market
Just as government and commercial industries collaborate closely on initiatives concerning
security policy and procedures, leading industry associations are also responding to the new

developments and anticipating how global trends will impact the overall security industry
and their membership companies.The Security Industry Association (SIA;
www.siaonline.org) is an international trade association, formed in 1969, whose membership
has grown today to almost 400 companies. SIA’s members include professionals from every
phase of the security industry—from manufacture to installation—and its clients run the
gamut of the economic sector: commercial, institutional, residential, and government.
Technology, products, and services offered by members include, but are not limited to, access
control; biometrics; surveillance cameras and systems; ﬁre detection and suppression; home
automation; intrusion; remote and wireless monitoring; personal security products and
response systems; mobile security; lock hardware; and many specialized services. In addition,
SIA is very active at the highest levels of our national government in regard to security
industry regulations.
SIA activities fall into four core concentrations—government relations, research and
technology, education and training, and standards:
■
Government relations In the arena of government relations, SIA staff inform
members of timely and relevant policy initiatives, federal regulations, and appropri-
ation activities.Additionally, SIA hosts the Government Sales & Marketing Summit
to introduce its member companies to the government marketplace.
■
Education and training SIA offers a wide range of education and training pro-
grams for security professionals who install and service electronic security equip-
ment and systems. Qualiﬁed security professionals may obtain two certiﬁcations
through SIA: Central Station Operator Instructor (CSOI) and Certiﬁed Security
Project Manager (CSPM).
■
Research and technology In addition to providing daily news feeds, SIA cur-
rently produces two quarterly publications: Quarterly Research Update and Quarterly
Technical Update.These publications address the most topical trend issues from both
a technological and a business perspective.
■
Standards SIA is an ANSI-approved Standards Development Organization.As
such, SIA leads the development of systems integration and equipment perfor-
mance standards. Standards staff also serve in an external liaison capacity, partnering
with federal agencies, law enforcement, and other related associations to develop
and advance standards.
Richard Chace, executive director and CEO of SIA, states,“The pace of change that the
traditional security industry is experiencing is unprecedented and has been consistent since
the events of 9/11.The collaboration I see between government and commercial industry in
the area of security convergence is impressive. It is evident in the program awards, on the
trade show ﬂoors, and in the new competitive landscape [with] a lot of merger and acquisi-
tion activity and new partnerships between traditional security and IT ﬁrms. It is really
aligning security as a key business priority.”

The Open Security Exchange (OSE)
As convergence becomes a dominant theme between the traditional security market and IT,
industry forums inevitably step to the forefront to address pending standards issues and pro-
vide leadership to the industry.
The Open Security Exchange (OSE) was created to address today’s most signiﬁcant
security challenge: the lack of integration between various components of the security
infrastructure.The OSE is a cross-industry forum dedicated to merging physical and IT
security solutions across an enterprise.As physical and IT security merge, networked com-
puter technology and associated applications provide the enterprise with increased opera-
tional efﬁciencies and intelligent security.The OSE has written a speciﬁcation, Physical
Security Bridge to IT Security (PHYSBITS), to assist in the integration of physical and IT
security management.This vendor-neutral speciﬁcation for enabling collaboration between
physical and IT security to support overall enterprise risk management needs provides the
following:
■
A framework for integration of physical and IT security 
■
A data model supporting integration
■
Data sharing between physical and logical access control systems
The OSE’s initial speciﬁcations for physical and cyber security management convergence
(http://opensecurityexchange.com) provide technical integration on three levels:
■
Common administration of users, privileges, and credentials
■
Common strong authentication for access to physical facilities and cyber systems
through the use of dual-purpose credentials
■
Common point of security management and event audit ability
This convergence will eliminate many of the risks created by separate physical and cyber
security management. For example, without physical/cyber security integration, security
teams cannot readily determine whether someone is trying to use a computer system while
its owner is not physically present in the building.This leaves organizations vulnerable to
insider abuse, including password stealing.
Gary Klinefelter, Fargo, vice president of Technology Development, states,“As the OSE
chairperson, one of the things I see missing today is a road map for enterprise security
migration that includes both IT and physical security viewpoints, and explains the strategic,
tactical, and operational considerations of convergence. It needs to consider the business
drivers that feed the need for enterprise security. Finally, a transition model needs to be
developed to help end users migrate to an improved state of security. [Although] standards
and interoperability will be essential to a converged future, seeing where we are headed is
the ﬁrst step.”

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

The OSE is an example of a security industry group that realizes the impact that secu-
rity convergence will have on the market and the need to proactively promote standards.
Industry organizations representing both physical security services and electronic products
are following suit.
The American Society 
for Industrial Security (ASIS)
In 2005, the three leading security associations created an alliance to address the manage-
ment of risks and emerging regulations requiring a more thorough, enterprise-wide
approach to security.The alliance of ASIS International, the Information Systems Audit and
Control Association (ISACA), and the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)
brings together more than 90,000 global security professionals to address these issues.A joint
press release citing the need for this alliance is predicated on the signiﬁcant increase and
complexity of security-related risks to international commerce from terrorism, cyber attacks,
Internet viruses, theft, fraud, extortion, and other threats that require corporations to develop
a more comprehensive approach to protect the enterprise.
The AESRM alliance of the aforementioned organizations was created to address the
integration of traditional (physical) and information security (logical) functions. Besides pro-
viding a comprehensive approach to enterprise security policy, an additional goal is to posi-
tion critical security-related issues for boards of directors and senior-level executive
attention.
The Alliance has produced a detailed listing of objectives, as follows:
■
Developing risk models that more fully qualify and quantify enterprise-wide secu-
rity risks and potential impacts to the business
■
Raising awareness to executive management regarding the nature of existing and
emerging security threats, and best practices to mitigate those threats through the
convergence of security organizations, processes, and approaches
■
Promoting a common security management voice to legislators and government
agencies and providing them with information regarding best security practices
■
Continuing to deﬁne the qualiﬁcation, certiﬁcation, and training requirements for
the chief security ofﬁcer (CSO)/chief information security ofﬁcer (CISO) role
and other security-related positions
The security alliance is coordinating its practices with the trend toward globalization and
collaboration which is expanding the universe of security responsibilities. Emerging technical
advances are promoting the use of outsourcing as a way for corporations to control costs and
improve productivity.Additionally, more value is migrating to information (electronic) assets,
which require new government regulation compliance and protection policies from both a
physical location and a cyber security standpoint.

As Christopher Kelly, a vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, states,“Convergence is
requiring our security leaders to learn much more about the business and change their per-
spective of their position, from a functional subject matter expert to a business person with
functional knowledge.”
These respective security and IT associations and their membership understand that
managing risk effectively in a complex environment can be achieved through convergence.
This process of security convergence is also changing the fundamental job requirements in
the security industry.ASIS (www.asisonline.org) is the preeminent organization for security
professionals, with more than 33,000 members worldwide. ISACA (www.isaca.org) has more
than 35,000 members in more than 100 countries and is the global leader in information
governance, security, and assurance. ISSA (www.issa.org), with more than 13,000 members in
nearly 100 chapters, is an international, not-for-proﬁt association of information security
professionals.
The PSA Security Network (PSA)
PSA Security Network (www.psasecuritynet.com) is the world’s largest electronic security
cooperative.The organization encompasses more than 200 electronic security systems inte-
grators, aligning them over 200 manufacturing vendor partners.Together, PSA members are
responsible for more than $1.4 billion in annual security systems design, installation, integra-
tion, and maintenance of access control, video surveillance, intrusion detection, ﬁre, and life
safety systems.
PSA integrators improve security performance through their access to the latest security
products, best practices, and other resources to develop cost-effective security solutions. In
the face of a rapidly changing security industry, the PSA network understands the impact
that security convergence is having on a global basis and that this technical trend is occur-
ring simultaneously with security policy becoming part of the core businesses they serve.
Bill Bozeman is the CEO and a man who realizes that his organization needs to
embrace change and collaborate with IT partners. Bozeman believes,“PSA is aggressively
recruiting IT integrators into our membership to jointly pursue convergence opportunities.
Our strategy is to create ‘convergence integrators’ who are well positioned to promote a
business model that aligns tightly with the industry trends and will drive higher margins
through integration services.” By playing to one of the PSA’s core strengths of education and
training, Bozeman also understands he holds the key to accelerating convergence opportuni-
ties for both IT and physical security integrators. His membership’s physical security knowl-
edge is a competitive advantage for an IT integrator trying to differentiate service offerings.
Simultaneously, PSA will leverage networking and storage knowledge from IT integrators to
complement existing training programs for their traditional membership. PSA is combining
physical security and IT integrator expertise to create the security integrator of the future.
This strategy is an example of security convergence, which is being adapted by larger phys-
ical security manufacturers and integrators.

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

As government imposes federally mandated compliance regulations and collaborates
with critical infrastructure industries post-September 11, the impact is being felt across the
traditional security landscape.Technology transfers between government and commercial
markets are promoting interoperability through open systems and standards, accelerating large
security installations.The funding of huge government programs supporting homeland secu-
rity initiatives such as HSPD-12, FIPS 201, and the PIV card have a trickle-down effect on
the entire security industry, from manufacturers to installers.As a result, industry associations
from both the traditional physical security and IT industries are adjusting strategies to meet
new market dynamics.The roles of security professionals and practitioners are advancing and
changing with the new deﬁnition of risk in a global economy.
The Security 500 Ranking
Security (www.securitymagazine.com) is a premiere publication focusing on solutions for
enterprise security leaders. It provides an insightful array of global security news and business
information in written and electronic formats and covers all aspects of the security industry.
The magazine also publishes the Security 500 Ranking, which tracks spending by U.S. busi-
nesses on physical and logical security products and services, estimated at more than $200
billion in 2006.
Mark McCourt, publisher, states,“Many organizations do not know what they spend on
physical and logical security or what they get for their spending.As the cost of security has
increased, boards of directors, CEOs, CFOs, and others are asking that question, especially as
spending reaches nearly one-quarter of a trillion dollars.” It is important to note that this
ﬁgure does not include professional services or overhead, such as executive salaries or pri-
vately hired or contracted security ofﬁcers. It also does not include the $40 billion that the
Security 500 Ranking’s number one organization, DHS, will spend in 2006.
A Closer Look:The Top 50 of the Security 500
(27) Government agencies Federal Homeland security dominates; but most cover cities
for emergency management or ﬁrst responders.
(16) Business organizations Many ﬁnancial and energy ﬁrms; 75 percent to 80 per-
cent of critical infrastructure owned and guarded by private organizations.
(7) Guarding transportation, cargo operations A mixture of seaports and airports
operated by city and regional agencies but working under federal mandates.
A new trend is emerging at the most advanced levels; some organi-
zations have integrated security into their business. For example,
security may be a component of the environmental health and
safety function at an energy company, or part of patient safety in a
medical center.”—Bill Zalud, Editor, Security

Security has identiﬁed four external drivers for security spending that bring the security
spending discussion past “if” and to “how much,” and in most organizations, more than one
of these drivers is in play:
■
Asset value Facilities and intellectual property; the greater the asset?s value, the
higher the insurance rates and risk mitigation requirements.
■
Reputation/brand Mitigating risk to avoid a negative impact on reputation,
preventing or addressing fraud, protecting revenue, and retaining customer loyalty.
■
People Both the number one asset that security protects, and the number one
threat to security.
■
Regulation/compliance At a minimum, security spending meets a regulatory,
insurance, or compliance, requirement.
The following list shows the percentage of CEOs, COOs, and CFOs who agree with
the following statements concerning security:
61% Excellence in security is a big competitive advantage in the marketplace.
56% Our organization will lose business if we can’t meet certiﬁcation standards for
security.
46% It is hard to justify spending on security because it is hard to measure its effec-
tiveness.
43% Spending on security enables our organization to pursue activities that would be
too risky to contemplate otherwise.
Shame on us if the CEO or CFO asks us the value of our department
and roles. We cannot be seen as the people who focus on reacting
to things. We should be viewed as solid businesspeople who happen
to have an expertise in security.”—Rob Holm, director, Corporate
Security, The Tribune Company
It would appear from the results of the Security 500 survey that security is certainly a
priority and a highly visible issue to the executive staff.Aligning security with organizational
goals adds the most economic value. For this reason, the role of the security executive is
evolving into more of a business role than strictly a security professional.The security execu-
tive is going global and is accepting a wider responsibility within the scope of enterprise risk
management.

Convergence: Creating 
New Security Business Value
The convergence of information technologies with physical and logical security solutions has
forced a fundamental change on one of the world’s oldest professions.The ability to protect
and defend all assets, physical and electronic, now depends, for the most part, on IT.As these
converged security solutions continue to become embedded in the fabric of our lives (think
video surveillance and ﬁnancial transactions), their impact on society from public safety con-
cerns to civil liberty violations will be profound.
As this trend toward a security society marches slowly, almost invisibly, forward, it begins
with a change in the attitude and expectations of security professionals worldwide. Security
operations are going digital and becoming holistic, all-encompassing, and integrated into
daily life. Security, once an island in itself, is collaborating with all other departments com-
prising the business, not unlike the IT department’s ability to empower through technology,
and making security a core business function of the organization.The post-September 11 era
has fueled the government think tanks and program budgets with a security focus not seen
since the days of the World War 2 Manhattan Project’s race to develop a nuclear bomb.The
security innovations recently introduced and soon to become commercially available will
only accelerate and continue to fundamentally change the security industry. Security conver-
gence will grow from a few select and visible application solutions to become aligned and
interoperable within the process of global business operations.Along the way, the deﬁnition
of security and the professionals tasked with its implementation will change, inevitably
becoming more technically astute and business-savvy.
This trend can be seen in the behavior of security industry associations, which reﬂect
the uneasy change being brought on their professional memberships. Just as the traditional
security guard will morph into a twenty-ﬁrst-century version of Robocop, so too will the
security executive evolve from the role of former career military or law enforcement veteran
looking at corporate security as a second career.The new age of security professional can be
seen in the academic programs being pursued in security management, counterterrorism, and
information forensics, at state college and university systems worldwide.Technology is at the
core and new thinking about how it applies to the security profession is the order of the day
(see Figure 7.1).
The Security 500 report referenced CSO magazine (www.csoonline.com) in relation to
two questions pointing up interesting trends. For example, the percentage of companies
where IT and physical security reported to the same executive leader was 11 percent in 2003
and grew to 40 percent in 2006. Similarly, actual integration activity between the IT and
physical security departments rose from 29 percent in 2003 to 75 percent in only three
years’ time.Along with these advances in reporting structure and integration activities around
convergence, the actual decision cycle is changing to incorporate the advances which inno-
vative technologies are having on the way security is deployed.

Figure 7.1 The New Model of Security Convergence (New Era Associates):
Traditional vs. Digital Thinking
There is a measurable difference in the thinking that occurs in the purchasing cycles of
organizations. In some cases, the IT group is taking control of the budgets and deployment
of security solutions residing on the corporate network and utilizing systems infrastructure.
In others, the security group is selecting the appropriate solutions to execute their job
responsibilities and is looking to IT for the support and operational maintenance of the sys-
tems. In this way, the security function here is no different from other departments in the
corporation, such as ﬁnance and sales.The advent of digital solutions leveraging the conver-
gence of voice, data, and video functionality of Internet Protocol (IP) networks has played a
major role in the decision process.
The Collaboration 
of Security Responsibilities
The new era of physical security and IT convergence offers an opportunity for common
ground among security professionals at all management levels.This cooperation revolves
around not only products and technologies, but also the personal beneﬁt of advancing career
paths.Although we tend to look at security from different viewpoints, we should realize that
we do have mutual “executive” constituencies. Business is not just about solving problems,
but also about eliminating the embarrassment the exposure of that business problem causes.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

This concept applies to both external customers and individual career paths. Security
and IT executives must come together and agree that corporate security involves risk man-
agement and business continuance.The CEO and board of directors expect and deserve a
coordinated working relationship between these critical groups. Within the two organiza-
tions, risk needs to be clearly understood and communicated across the company, duplicate
projects and costs must be eliminated, and security in general terms should be a bridge
toward cooperation and mutual respect. If not, the organizational security policy, as well as
individual career paths, will suffer setbacks.
Inside the corporate organization chart, the security convergence trend is inevitable for
several reasons.The IT executive is becoming more powerful in corporate America as the
CSO gains increasing visibility. However, the business reality is that outside of the CEO, the
CIO basically has a global view of all corporate operations. His or her department touches
everyone’s area, from engineering to sales to personnel.This business background provides
excellent preparation for a move into a CEO role, provided the individual can think in
global terms about the business goals of the organization ﬁrst and not see everything through
the viewpoint of technology. Moving forward, all applications will be standards-based and
enterprise-deployable, including physical security. Compliance and IT governance issues will
dictate that strategy, and vendors outside of this mandate will be excluded from large net-
work opportunities. Physical security products are moving toward convergence as distribu-
tion channels and support requirements evolve to meet both new competitive challenges and
business opportunities.
Perhaps one reason security convergence did not take off immediately after September
11 is because corporate executives understood that the traditional silo approach to physical
security does not scale and additional stand-alone installations would not be cost-effective.
Additionally, expecting the IT department to control all things security is not the answer
either, based on experience level.Although the movement toward security convergence is
centered upon IT infrastructure, the basic experience in the physical security sector is out-
side the scope of an IT job description.
In this confused state, who is responsible? The CIO, CSO, CISO, or CRO? The good
news is that there is a chief in there somewhere! Currently, the physical security department
is operating outside of its comfort zone by being asked to sell enterprise return on invest-
ment (ROI) at the executive level, and to understand and communicate the speciﬁc issues of
IT.At the same time, the IT department is accepting additional responsibility for physical
security operations with which it has little or no experience. It appears that neither organi-
zation has the expertise to pull the broader enterprise risk vision into focus.
From the executive perspective, the security convergence strategy is simply following the
same path that every other department in the corporation, from ﬁnance to engineering, has
already traveled. Deploy solutions across an open infrastructure to improve employee produc-
tivity and generate a positive ROI. Securing a global supply chain is another issue entirely.
Although the business process leverages numerous partnerships around the globe for a com-
petitive advantage, the problem is, in most cases, that security (physical and logical) was a
supply chain afterthought.

211

Moving forward, the challenge is to embed security into the business strategy on the
front end.The stage is set for the “new” security executive to lead on these critical issues.
The underlying problem is to ﬁnd someone with the ability to collaborate and communicate
effectively across multiple constituencies.This position may require a hybrid of physical secu-
rity and IT experience, operational understanding, political tact, and a dose of sales and mar-
keting acumen.This individual needs to be effective across organizations, internal and
external to the company, and have the skills to communicate the vision (in simple English)
to multiple levels of line staff, middle management, and executives.The key is that this posi-
tion needs to be held by a peer of the CIO, CFO, and other executive staff members.The
threat today to the corporation, its shareholders, its business partners, and its customers is too
critical to limit security’s exposure.
The point is that in the near future, security will become “job one” with an executive
reporting directly to the CEO. Organizational charts and titles will differ by industry, but this
security executive position will evolve, gaining exposure, credibility, and power. Securing
supply chains with “trusted partners” will be driven downstream to companies of all sizes.
These companies (your customers) will look to you for solutions that integrate into the
infrastructures of these major multinational organizations, where IP is the network of choice
and data strategies have life cycles that span several storage technologies.The sales and sup-
port skills of physical security and IT integrators will need to be upgraded as expectations
rise.The security organization will become a much more demanding customer. Quickly
deploying IP security solutions that scale will be expected.
The good news is that the revenue opportunities expand along with the responsibilities.
The old saying that “it takes money to make money” applies here. If you don’t have the skill
sets today, hire them and pay for them.The same executive skills of collaboration and com-
munication will extend to your organization if you hope to succeed. Embracing change and
creating new support structures around IP security convergence are your entry requirements.
You’ll be glad you made the commitment. Enterprise security will be the growth industry of
the next 20 years.
“In ﬁve years, all of the systems that physical security relies on will be developed by IT
companies,” says Steve Hunt, president and founder of 4A.“That means the IT professional,
whether he likes it or not, becomes a major inﬂuencer in corporate physical security. My
advice is not to let it go to your head. Form constructive relationships with your security
staff today rather than wait for political battles tomorrow.”
The Emergence of the CIO: Tracking 
Technical Advances to Business Productivity 
Over time, most major companies evolve their technology deployments and how they select
new products and vendors.At the same time, it is important to track the evolution of speciﬁc
executive positions and how they correspond in kind with those technology cycles.
www.syngress.com
212
Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

A review of IT history tracks the evolution of the vice president of data processing (pio-
neer), to the vice president of information technology (technologist), to the chief informa-
tion ofﬁcer (executive) position.This is critical to understand, because as the position
changed, so did the industry’s attitude about technology becoming a business-enabler,
vendor-selling strategy from bits and bytes to ROI and solution orientation. Continuing to
stress speeds and feeds over business issues, or not understanding the economic beneﬁts of
open IT infrastructure versus proprietary architectures in a timely enough fashion, will not
advance the security convergence cause within the organization.
The evolution of technology and the positions of the people who deploy it say a lot
about how security solutions will evolve to meet the growing threat of enterprise risk.The
emergence of the World Wide Web and e-commerce application solutions helped to gain
prominence for the CIO position as technology created new productivity beneﬁts and rev-
enue channels for the organization.Additionally, the worldwide focus on the millennium bug
(W2K) issues presented an opportunity for the CIO to upgrade the corporate infrastructure
and act as an educator to the executive staff and board of directors, gaining valuable credi-
bility and simultaneously increasing the IT budget. Essentially, the IT career path tracked the
advances and the pace of the technology itself.
As information became more of a productivity-enhancing tool, it became more closely
associated with corporate revenues in all areas, from engineering to sales.As such, it increas-
ingly reached across the organization and outward into its supply chain partners to improve
business operations across an ever-wider scale.This increased the impact of the technology
on all business operations and extended the visibility of the IT department, its management,
and its chief executive.
The politics of the position also became more powerful, and today, the CIO usually
occupies an executive staff position at the upper levels of the company or government
agency hierarchy.Today the CIO has a complete understanding of all of the various internal
business operations and external partnerships his technology department impacts.As such,
aside from the CEO, the CIO may be in the best strategic position to understand the opera-
tions of the company worldwide. Based on this business understanding, the CIO’s position
may prove to be an ideal launching pad into the CEO suite in the years to come—that is to
say, if the CIO understands the business issues equally well or better than the technology
itself. Keeping a technical orientation at the expense of understanding business issues will
make career advancement all but impossible for a technologist. It is critical for the CIO to
understand the importance of delegating technical responsibilities as he rounds out his busi-
ness skill sets on his way toward additional executive responsibilities.
These rising expectations of the value of high-technology investments to the bottom
line of the business are the underlying requirement for strategic business thinking on the part
of the CIO. Collaboration with the various internal business units and external suppliers and
partners also extends to the CSO and CISO positions, respectively.As the organization
expands and security takes on priority status, the working relationship, coordination of
responsibilities, and delegation of security authority among the positions become more
www.syngress.com
Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value • Chapter 7
213

strategically important.At the end of the day, it is the expectation of the board of directors
and the CEO that the CIO and CSO will align and work together.
Both of these organizations, IT and physical security, are being converged around a
larger ideal than they focus on separately: one of protecting the organization in an era of
increasing global risk. Perhaps if the events of September 11 never happened and threats
from global terrorism and advances in cyber crime never occurred, the IT and physical secu-
rity departments would remain independent indeﬁnitely. However, these events, continuous
threats, and increasing cyber attacks have promoted the goal of deploying an enterprise secu-
rity policy tightly aligned within the IT governance and infrastructure of the organization.
In many cases, this security function has an internal component and reaches externally to
supplier and partner networks of all sizes and in all locations around the globe.
The Emergence of the CSO: 
Moving from Managing Costs to Saving Lives
Although the CIO has an increasingly powerful position within the corporate hierarchy, the
continuing visibility on all things security-related can also elevate the CSO position to exec-
utive-level status, provided the person has the business skill sets required. Whereas the IT
organization needs a physical security education, a CSO “business skill set upgrade” is also
required.The security ofﬁcer needs to understand not only IT policy, procedures, and infras-
tructure issues, but also the respective business units and how they operate.The CSO must
drive security policy into all internal departments across the global enterprise as well as col-
laborate externally with partners, suppliers, government agencies, and even foreign govern-
ments.The soft skills of business acumen, tact, and political leverage will be job requirements
within the executive circle as security policy takes a more visible and global role within
organizations in the years ahead.
Jeff Kessler, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers, is the leading security industry
analyst on Wall Street. He co-hosts the annual Securing New Ground Conference for secu-
rity industry executives and luminaries to discuss business trends. His comments at the 2006
event reﬂected both an industry and a CSO position in transition:“Convergence is real.
There is a redeﬁnition of the existing security paradigm, and a big trend is the development
of the CSO position.” In fact, the Lehman Brothers organization was presented as an
example of a converged operation consisting of equal parts IT and physical security—a col-
laborative relationship whereby IT standards and integration drive security policy and solu-
tions across its worldwide operation.
The job description of a CSO with responsibility for physical and IT security has been
elusive ever since ASIS formally began deﬁning such a role in 1999 during its national con-
ference in Washington, DC. However, as the security function becomes embedded into the
strategy of global organizations and their revenue-generating supply chains, an in-depth
understanding of physical security, technical trends, and the global business strategy will
become prerequisites for the security executive.

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

Security roles and responsibilities have been elevated and expanded with the introduc-
tion of outsourcing and global supply chains. In addition, the CSO position is in transition
post-September 11. Perhaps Dave Shepherd, former CSO of the Venetian Hotels, says it best:
“The role has changed from managing cost to preserving life.”And for the Las Vegas
Venetian, that includes 85,000 people per day covering 7.5 million square feet, 24 hours per
day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. No organization of that size can function successfully
without a security strategy.And the best security strategies are aligned with organizational
goals, are measurable, and add economic value.
What is interesting is that the Venetian Hotel is a stand-alone entity and is not con-
cerned as much with numerous global operations. Every company will have its own set of
earnings drivers and risks to consider when integrating security with enterprise strategy.
Sometimes an organization will deﬁne the CSO as the person responsible for physical or
facilities security. One deﬁnition of CSO is as follows: the person in charge of all staff mem-
bers who are responsible for enforcing and administering security policies for all systems
within an enterprise or division.A more speciﬁc title is CISO, which refers to a person
responsible for information security in particular.This is one reason for the confusion behind
the CSO and CISO roles. Being relatively new, the CISO role is situational-dependant upon
the organization in which it resides. In some cases, the CISO might report to the CSO; in
others, the CIO.And in an organization such as eBay (described shortly), the CISO position
is viewed as equal or superior to both the CSO and CIO roles.
ASIS feels the CSO is responsible for four different risk management disciplines:
■
Information security
■
Physical security
■
Risk assessment
■
Business continuity
Although the roles and responsibilities will vary by company and industry, it is fair to say
that the role of the CSO in the new-age corporation is gaining inﬂuence. In fact, Security
magazine reports that the nation’s top corporate CSOs, those executives in charge of security
for global companies in the United States, are paid, on average, more than $293,000 annually
in total cash compensation (base salary and bonus paid), according to a compensation survey
by the Florida compensation consulting and research ﬁrm, Foushée Group. CSOs not only
have to plan for international and domestic threats, but are increasingly involved with the
security requirements for information systems and planning for potential public health pan-
demics, which could signiﬁcantly impact a company’s capability to operate.
In addition, the convergence of the IT and physical security function has been gaining
momentum across corporations.Total spending on convergence projects in the public and
private sectors in North America and Europe will exceed $1.1 billion in 2005; according to
Forrester Research, Inc., this fact also creates a new dynamic for the CSO role moving for-
ward.“People have been talking about the concept of how security interrelates and comes
www.syngress.com
Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value • Chapter 7
215

together for some time,” says Tim Williams, CSO of Caterpillar, a 25-year veteran in corpo-
rate security.“What it really boils down to is layers of interdependencies between all our
business operations prioritized by what we deem most critical to our operation, which is the
intellectual property and capital that comes from our employees.”This explanation incorpo-
rates the need for cross-functional collaboration and strategic business understanding when
positioning the security function as a value-added proposition for the corporation. In short, a
holistic enterprise-wide security viewpoint to address the new era of global risk is required.
The Emergence of the CISO: 
Timing and Information Are Everything
Of the three security positions in an enterprise, the CISO is the new kid on the block.The
critical component determining the responsibility level appears to be the size and type of
industry in which the individual is positioned.The larger the better, such is the case of
General Motors, and the industries where information services generate large revenues, such
as Google, eBay,Yahoo!, and the ﬁnancial markets, generally have more highly visible CISO
positions than mid-size manufacturing ﬁrms.
Today, companies are confronted with new and increasing levels of internal and external
security risk and privacy issues regarding the protection of consumer data.A number of gov-
ernment regulatory compliance programs have created additional problems for organizations
to address.“Security folks have often been viewed as a necessary evil who always get in the
way of your doing business,” says Howard Schmidt, CISO at eBay Inc. and former White
House cyber security adviser. But regulatory compliance issues and the increasing losses
related to worms, viruses, and other hacker attacks are making security a part of the core
business process, he says.The critical business requirement to audit and secure information
has created a new dynamic within the IT industry. IT professionals (CIO, CSO, CISO) all
must possess a strong background in business, technology, and security. Of these roles, the
CISO is gaining a prominent position within leading organizations.
What Is a CISO?
Although CISO has many deﬁnitions, you should not confuse the job with that of the CSO.
In most organizations, the CSO has primary responsibility for enterprise risk management
issues involving physical security and infrastructure, business continuity and emergency plan-
ning, as well as criminal investigations and people issues.Again, responsibilities can vary
according to company size and industry. But generally, a CISO is typically focused on the
issues involved with IT security and IT risk management.This involves the protection of
information assets. It is common for a CISO in this capacity to report directly to the CIO,
although this reporting structure is a matter of increasing debate among security professionals
who think that the CISO should be independent of the CIO and the direct IT organization
in the event that a poorly designed or executed information security policy could cause
political embarrassment to that group.A peer-level relationship among the CIO, CISO, and
www.syngress.com
216
Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

CSO would be preferred in this instance, or perhaps having the CISO report to a CSO, who
typically does not have IT expertise in that organization.
In any event, the increasing importance of protecting electronic assets is creating the
need for the CISO position.As stated earlier, the position of CISO is recent and a response
to the increasing threat level and risk posed by cyber crimes.There is no hard and fast orga-
nizational box in which to place the position. It is based on the individual and her skills,
both technical and political, as well as the company and market segment.As security conver-
gence drives security policy to the executive level, it is perhaps the individual with the
power to inﬂuence senior management and the board of directors who will transition to the
leadership role regardless of CIO, CSO, or CISO title.
According to Wikipedia, a CISO focuses on information security strategy within an
organization.This security strategy can vary depending on the needs of the enterprise, but
often it includes responsibility for the following items:
■
Information security mission development
■
Information security ofﬁce governance
■
Information security policy development and management
■
Information security training and awareness development
■
Information security project portfolio development
■
Supervision/management of ethical hackers and chief hacker ofﬁcer
Whatever the role of the CISO in a speciﬁc organization and industry, the one common
denominator is the need to align information risk strategy with business objectives.An inter-
esting trend is developing around the CISO position; security functions are becoming more
operation-oriented.As security moves toward becoming more of a proactive discipline, rather
than a knee-jerk reaction to events, management processes come to the forefront.The man-
agement of a security policy across the organization, involving standard software solutions,
infrastructure issues, and training programs, encompasses risk management. Workgroup or
division requirements may vary, but security must be built into the business process.
A positive trend appears to be developing whereby the CISO is becoming more
involved with the business units early in the strategic development stage. By deploying an
operational risk management approach to IT security at the front end of a business process
rather than responding to emergencies after the fact, security can add value to the business
and signiﬁcantly reduce costs.At the same time, the CISO is becoming more inﬂuential
across the organization.
Positioning Security with the Board
As security policy becomes a major priority in the operation of a business on a global scale,
individual roles and responsibilities will continue to evolve and change. However, one con-
stant in the process is the requirement to gain approval for security funding.As technical

217

convergence continues to merge with traditional security solutions (physical and electronic),
it will allow the security department to apply the same ROI models that have been suc-
cessful in securing IT funding in the past.
The process of selling ROI for products and services within enterprise accounts is pri-
marily (and historically) an IT function. Physical security practitioners place less emphasis on
the enterprise ROI model, perhaps because of a lack of executive-level exposure to some
degree, but also based on the proprietary and stand-alone nature of security deployments to
date. IT sales organizations are experts at selling the beneﬁts of ROI because these ﬁrms have
lived through decades of rapid consolidation cycles in technology products. In the process of
framing technology ROI arguments to CIOs and their technical staffs, IT sales channels have
indirectly been providing the CIO with the supporting documentation and positioning
strategy to secure funding from their own senior managements and boards. One key factor in
positioning cost savings within the context of an enterprise view is in magnifying a little
value across many departments. Consolidated ROI is sold high in the organization and is
valuable once a point product (solution) has established credibility within the enterprise.
Security has traditionally been seen as a cost of doing business. No signiﬁcant standard
ROI model has been used by the profession to date.Typically, security investments in the
form of a technology, such as a surveillance camera, or a human being, such as a security
guard, were ﬁxed and, for the most part, isolated from the rest of the organization. Security
has been viewed as an ongoing operational cost. With the advent of technical advances in
the example of a video surveillance camera and a manned guard service, traditional cost
models change to provide a more measurable ROI, and the ability to leverage that invest-
ment across the organization rather than have it deployed in a silo or stand-alone fashion.
The ability to extend the value of a security asset across an organization, or to make a
traditional asset more productive, lies at the heart of the business value created by security
convergence.A baseline technology in the convergence model is the IP network, which
allows for global digital communications across a standards-based communications infrastruc-
ture.A video surveillance solution deployed across an enterprise IP network utilizes corpo-
rate storage and networking infrastructure and support resources to consolidate multiple
vendor solutions. Video images are simply data and part of an enterprise storage management
strategy, not a different product for each department, installed by various vendors and sup-
ported by individual resources without the ability to share the data images.This not only
restricts buying leverage with vendors, but also is more costly to maintain and less ﬂexible in
daily actual operations.
Lastly, it is redundant to fund, based on this organizations calculating ROSI (return on
security investment).The evolution of an ROSI model is a good omen for the security exec-
utive and the profession in general. Up to now, we have been told that security is a difﬁcult
matrix to position within an ROI calculation. Moving forward, as security solutions are
deployed over IT infrastructures, the same ROI methods that organizations have used for
decades will be applied to security investments. In essence, it will involve a consolidation of
equipment costs and administration over large deployments, individual and collective
employee productivity beneﬁts resulting from using technology to reduce human error and

Chapter 7 • Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value

the actual number of human assets, and the increasing importance that enterprise security
policy and risk mitigation will have on the valuation of corporate assets, which will be
reﬂected in increased operational efﬁciencies across the business.
Video Surveillance:A Benchmark for Security ROI
Advances in video surveillance technology (cameras) have provided an opportunity for new
digital cameras to replace older analog cameras, and to utilize the IP network (and wireless
technology) to replace older coaxial cabling.The cost beneﬁts are signiﬁcant, because the
cost of the people to run coaxial wiring throughout a large operation can be offset by the IP
networking that already exists in most locations.Additionally, digital cameras offer quality
resolution (which will eventually surpass analog) and allow the video to be accessed in real
time, globally, across the Internet.This capability provides endless opportunity for additional
productivity gains. Not only can the video be shared across the network with other users,
but also it can be allocated over IP to different storage platforms and managed appropriately.
Less administration is required for these tasks when compared to multiple points of storage
across the organization. In many instances, the storage area network (SAN) may already exist
in the organization, saving additional costs.
Dave Tyson is the senior manager of the city of Vancouver, where he is responsible for
supporting both physical and IT business services. Recently, he shared an interesting story
with us regarding video surveillance ROI during a security industry panel discussion on the
subject of security convergence.
As he explains, the city of Vancouver will be hosting the Winter Olympic Games in
2010.This fact makes Tyson’s life more interesting as he prepares security for this event. He
mentioned that part of his strategy involves the purchase of new digital surveillance security
cameras to utilize over an existing IP network. With that in mind, the city put out a bid for
700 surveillance cameras. In order to accommodate the cameras with storage and associated
administration costs at multiple locations, a budget was allocated for $500,000 to purchase
network video recorders (NRVs). Realizing that collaboration with the IT department is
good business, he shared his vision with his technical counterparts. In reviewing the city’s IT
infrastructure, they realized Tyson could utilize the existing SAN for the surveillance storage
(a SAN is a large block of disk storage accessible from the network and managed centrally).
Purchasing approximately $40,000 worth of disk space and adding it to the existing SAN
could satisfy Tyson’s video surveillance storage requirement.The savings over the NVR pur-
chase was $460,000, which can be utilized for additional security requirements.
A key point for the CSO or other physical security professional to consider is that an
understanding of IT history is key to your positioning a successful budget request with a
compelling ROI to senior management. For example, PC servers and an NVR are similar dis-
tributed storage concepts and each unit requires some form of management.The issue is that
15 years ago, the IT industry started moving away from the PC server distributed model to
centralized storage as disk space demand exploded and the pricing dropped signiﬁcantly.This
is why SAN architectures were invented in the ﬁrst place. Less administrative complexity

equals easier storage management at lower cost.Video adds huge volumes of storage.
Purchasing and, more important, supporting distributed NVRs across an enterprise infrastruc-
ture greatly increase costs.This is not to say that distributed storage models do not have a
place anywhere in the enterprise.They clearly do. However, collaborating counterparts in
other departments such as IT, ﬁnance, human resources, or facilities can assist in advancing a
positive ROI for security funding.As security becomes a critical component of the global
business operation, the ability to integrate security services across a wider section of the enter-
prise can assist in reducing costs when compared to supporting numerous remote locations.
As far as the physical security guard is concerned, analog surveillance system conﬁgura-
tions usually call for one or several guards to be stationary and watching a bank of video
monitors for unusual activity.This is not only boring work, but also costly in terms of head-
count and the fully burdened cost of a guard (insurance, beneﬁts). What’s more, the ability of
a human being to concentrate on video images has been proven to degrade steadily after 20
minutes’ time. With digital VoIP, the new generation of intelligent surveillance software pro-
vides analytical capabilities to recognize anomalies for the guard(s) and alert them in real
time of activities requiring immediate attention.Additionally, wireless digital surveillance
technologies can get the guard out on patrol, and still provide him with access to intelligent
surveillance software via handheld devices, improving response time and productivity.
This is an example of security convergence changing the oldest security profession in
the book: physical guard services. It results in fewer people, yet more productivity through
wireless video technology and advanced communications. Consider for a moment that the
physical security guard market represents anywhere from 35 percent to 45 percent
(depending on the data source) of the annual revenues for the entire security industry.The
ROI for guard companies, as well as their customers, will be impacted signiﬁcantly on the
positive side with the introduction of digital security solutions delivered over IP infrastruc-
ture.As the capability of the IP network and related software improves to control everything
from access to physical locks on doors and gates, to the energy usage of an intelligent
building through Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls, the return on
security investments will show positive and measurable returns.
Digital video technologies can be utilized to provide a dual-use capability to businesses.
The same camera watching a cash register can be a criminal deterrent and investigation tool
for the security department, or a cashier training and/or customer behavior-modeling tool
for the marketing department. Imagination and creativity become endless in a real-time dig-
ital world. However, the larger business value for the security practitioner in corporate
America comes from the ability to leverage these technologies across a global network and
supply chain involving multiple vendors and partners.The ability to understand the intersec-
tion of innovative technologies with the strategic plans of the organization is critical to secu-
rity adding value to the business.As the security organization becomes more concerned with
managing increasing risk across the organization from a multitude of sources, technical con-
vergence will provide the ability to deploy security policy more effectively.

tion for CSOs whose vision is to advance strategic security practices and solutions.The

Security Executive Council membership is by invitation and currently represents 18 industry
sectors.The mission of the Council is to provide both public and private sector CSOs and
CISOs with new and innovative projects and solutions that are researched and developed by
full-time staff, a distinguished Emeritus Faculty of former CSOs from the nation’s leading
companies and agencies, and Content Expert Faculty who are the nation’s leaders in security
law, compensation, career management, workplace violence, business conduct and anony-
mous reporting, critical incident planning, communications, and awareness. Both Emeritus
and Content Expert Faculty are available to members as part of their membership and are
frequent presenters at leading security education venues.
The council spends a lot of time deﬁning how to measure the value of security invest-
ments. Security metrics focus on the actions (and results of those actions) that organizations
take to reduce and manage the risks of loss of reputation, theft of information or money, and
business discontinuities that arise when security defenses or protocols are breached.They are
useful to senior management, decision makers, users, administrators, or other stakeholders
who face a difﬁcult and complex set of questions regarding security, such as the following:
■
How much money/resources should be spent on security?
■
Which system components or other aspects should be targeted ﬁrst?
■
How can the system be effectively conﬁgured?
■
How much improvement is gained by security expenditures, including improve-
ments to security processes?
■
How do we measure the improvements?
■
Are we reducing our exposure?
Bob Hayes, executive director of the CSO Executive Council, believes,“One of the key
reasons we have not been held to accepted standards of measurement is that there is no
established model for the corporate security organization.”
The Security Scorecard
The Enterprise Security Matrix involves all departments and requires multiple security mea-
surements.The old saying,“If you can measure it you can manage it,” certainly applies here.
It is about the security group communicating its business value across the enterprise to
deploy cost-effective security convergence.The result is an enterprise security policy
deployed within the large IT infrastructure.
Risk management is the process of identifying and understanding applicable risks and
taking informed actions to reduce potential failure, achieve business objectives, and decrease
business performance uncertainty. Four categories of risk confront businesses:
■
Strategic risk Risks that are an inherent part of the business environment and
have a signiﬁcant effect on revenues, earnings, market share, and product offerings.
www.syngress.com
Positioning Security: Politics, Industry, and Business Value • Chapter 7
221

■
Organizational risk Risks that are part of a unit’s environment relating to
people, politics, and values that can impact organizational effectiveness.
■
Financial risk Market, credit, and liquidity risks that create uncertainty, expo-
sure to loss, and potential that the business will not be able to meet its future
obligations.
■
Operational risk The risk of loss from inadequate system controls, human error,
or other management failures.These areas have increasingly become a part of secu-
rity’s realm, encompassing fraud, data integrity, risky operating environments, infor-
mation security, business continuity, inadequate policies and controls, and the rich
variety of good old problems with people.
As a way for executives to effectively gauge risk, the CSO Council has devised a unique
visual information system to determine priorities and interdependencies among various
groups.The so-called CSO Dashboard provides six dials that are watched on a regular basis.
These indicators could be “survival metrics”—the hot buttons CSOs are expected to address
or those few dials that monitor selected wellness indicators unique to your organization or of
particular concern to management. If you are in ﬁnancial services, you might be particularly
attuned to the number of business units with dated contingency plans and inadequate soft-
ware patch administration, internal misconduct, or numbers of people hired with known
derogatory backgrounds.Your business may be in hostile locations or increasingly dependent
on third parties you know have poor security controls. What if you are concerned that you
security service vendor is giving you increasing numbers of problematic personnel? Each of
us can select a few key metrics we should watch because they are the things that keep us
awake at night.
The Malcolm Baldrige Award criteria underscore the wisdom of having an organized set
of performance metrics, embedded within the operations of a security function:
Modern businesses depend upon measurement and analysis of per-
formance. Measurements must derive from the company’s strategy
and provide critical data and information about key processes, out-
puts, and results. Data and information needed for performance
measurement and improvement are of many types, including cus-
tomer, product and service performance, operations, market, com-
petitive comparisons, supplier, employee-related, and cost and
ﬁnancial. Analysis entails using data to determine trends, projec-
tions, and cause and effect—that might not be evident without
analysis. Data and analysis support a variety of company purposes,
such as planning, reviewing company performance, improving oper-
ations, and comparing company performance with competitors’ or
with “best practices” benchmarks.

Positioning Security: The “I” Word
Inﬂuence:At the end of the day, that’s what it is all about. Without inﬂuence, little else mat-
ters. Certainly at the end of the day, the execution and actual impact of security policy can
be measured. However, the ability to inﬂuence thinking at the executive level to actually
fund the security initiatives must occur as a ﬁrst step, because inﬂuence is what gets you
funded.
If you think about it, you really cannot be credible without inﬂuence.You certainly will
not get budget approval for a security project or the required buy-in from constituencies to
execute effectively if you lack inﬂuence. Leadership is also hard to imagine without the
ability to inﬂuence people and events. We have heard time and again that the new era of
security professional requires a more holistic viewpoint.This requires an understanding of
how the business operates, its tactical and strategic goals, and its cultural values. Security pro-
fessionals understand how an enterprise security policy adds value to the overall business and
how to position security as a strategic asset.A more limited view positions security as a col-
lection of independent operations, or cost centers, with no capability to interoperate across
locations or departments to leverage technologies and people into a position to add value.
This ability to collaborate with groups horizontally and vertically within the organiza-
tion, and with partners and suppliers outside of it, is critical for success.The new security
executive also understands that there are various degrees of inﬂuence which need to be exer-
cised as part of a situational management style.This might be described as a combination of
business acumen and tact, or being politically astute. Whatever the description, inﬂuence
plays a critical role. It is very possible to have inﬂuence in one area or discipline, such as law
enforcement or the military, and ﬁnd that outside of that realm your ability to inﬂuence
people and events is signiﬁcantly limited. Inﬂuence in a hierarchy based on rank or com-
mand-and-control decision trees simply does not work in a decentralized and collaborative
environment, where valuable workers are more like free agents than corporate soldiers.This
is where ﬂexibility and people skills come into play and where, done correctly and with sin-
cerity, they generate credibility and, most important, inﬂuence.
Dictionary.com deﬁnes inﬂuence as “the capacity or power of persons or things to be a
compelling force on or produce effects on the actions, behavior, opinions, etc., of others.”
Inﬂuence is similar to power is many ways, but subtler, and absolutely critical to positioning
or selling an idea to senior management, especially if it involves change.
Consider corporate supply chains.Today’s voluntary requirements in securing supply
chains will become mandatory standards following a successful attack impacting the world
economy.At that unfortunate moment, the way the world views corporate security policy
will change signiﬁcantly. During the economic boom of the late 1990s, a funny thing hap-
pened in stock valuation. Corporate IT POLICY, its infrastructure of networking, storage,
and e-commerce applications, drove stock prices higher.
We believe we are approaching the day when corporate SECURITY POLICY mea-
sured by performance matrix and ROI will be a signiﬁcant factor in determining stock
value. How secure are the supply chain, intellectual property, international business

operations, security ratings by insurance providers, and compliance? At the end of the day,
deploying enterprise security policy will be an executive priority impacting shareholders,
determining convergence strategies, and deﬁning your company’s capability to balance global
risk and business opportunity.

How Wall Street Funded the Global
Economy: Twenty-First Century Security
In the late 1990s and early 2000s,Wall Street and the high-technology industry were in a love
affair of sorts.The topic on everyone’s lips, from landscaper to lawyer, was the stock market
and his personal favorite stocks that had shot through the roof recently, as well as the next big
company to promise unbelievable short-term returns.After all, even old Rust Belt companies
such as General Electric were embracing Internet Protocol (IP) networks and e-commerce
solutions as the panacea for competing in an increasingly aggressive global market.
One of the key drivers behind this momentum was the prominent role that the IT
infrastructure was playing regarding employee productivity and customer-facing solutions. It
wasn’t just Cisco Systems and Dell Computer that were experiencing incredible growth;
their customers, who implemented their state-of-the-art IP networking and storage servers
to create the infrastructure to host innovative software solutions and streamline legacy busi-
ness operations, enjoyed success as well.
Many of these marquis end-user accounts, such as Wal-Mart and Federal Express,
changed their respective industries and promoted these technologies as key drivers for facili-
tating added value to their businesses.The powerful tandem of high-speed ﬁber optic net-
working technologies and the World Wide Web combined to accelerate global
communications funding.This momentum came with the hearty endorsements of telecom
industry CEOs and their Wall Street analyst partners.The message was clear:There was no
end in sight to the performance gains and competitive opportunities in a global market, pro-
viding your company embraced the technology wave. If it didn’t, you should be prepared to
be swept away by it. If you chose not to believe Bernie Ebbers, ex-CEO of WorldCom (and
current poster boy for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [SOX], now spending the rest of his
life in prison), all you had to do was look around you—at the stock market, your neighbors’
new car and boat, or your 401K. It is interesting that in hindsight, this frenzy of “group
think” essentially started with an initial public offering (IPO) at a start-up software company,
which drove the investment insanity that led to government regulations, which in turn had a
signiﬁcant impact on the security market we know today, and will continue to drive the
changes we will experience tomorrow.
Netscape built the ﬁrst commercial Web browser and provided the fuel for the growth
of online solutions over the World Wide Web. It was the second successful IPO for founder
Jim Clark, his ﬁrst being Silicon Graphics, and it introduced the world to Marc Andreessen,
the software developer and Web visionary.The Netscape software integrated three separate
Internet technologies—e-mail, newsgroups, and the Web—into one application suite across
the three major operating systems: Windows,Apple Macintosh, and UNIX.The secondary
genius in this strategy was making it available for free over the Web, to individuals and non-
proﬁt corporations.
The only thing in the world that seemed to be keeping pace with the incredible
number of Internet users jumping on the Web in 1995 was the skyrocketing price of

Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

Netscape’s stock offering, the third largest in the history of the NASDAQ Exchange at the
time.An interesting and telling sidebar, however, was that this stock’s appreciation was not
based on solid revenues, but on overly optimistic speculation. Prior to Netscape, start-up
companies usually had to show four to six quarters of consistent revenue growth prior to a
public offering. Netscape not only created a new business model by introducing the world to
the Web, but it also turned the IPO market upside down and laid the foundation for a
groundswell of public offerings featuring new-age companies with little or no track record
of revenues. It was a house of cards that Wall Street was more than willing to fund.As a
result, ﬁnancial history repeated itself with a market crash starting in 2001, which erased
upward of $7 trillion in market valuation.
Leading up to that event, the middle to late 1990s was when Wall Street recognized, or
perhaps the better word is marketed, the importance of an IT infrastructure and innovative e-
business solution strategy in determining what valuation to place on a public company’s
stock.These major titans of industry were already long ago public offerings, but that was no
reason to believe their prices could not experience major growth if they applied new
thinking to old business models.And so they did. If Wal-Mart embraced new technology
platforms based on open systems and new innovations to improve business operations while
JC Penney stood pat with an “IBM-only” mentality, Wal-Mart was the better stock to rec-
ommend to brokerage customers.After all, it was in a better position to capitalize on the
growing global market opportunities in retail. (In fact, today, if Wal-Mart were a country, it
would be the #7 trading partner to China, which had $326 billion in exports last year.) 
The fact is that their respective market positions reversed during the decade of the
1990s, with Wal-Mart becoming the predominant worldwide retailer, passing the 100-plus-
year-old JC Penney as if it were standing in quicksand. It was a strategy in large part based
on new technology deployments to improve everything from inventory turns to the global
supply chain. During the 1990s, Wal-Mart CIO Randy Mott became an industry ﬁgurehead;
who was the CIO at JC Penney? This trend was repeated across numerous business segments
worldwide, with each respective market, from ﬁnancials, airlines, insurance, and educational
institutions, holding up an example of a technology-enabled, World Wide Web–based model
that was deployed to attain dominance.
As if the technology industry needed any additional incentive to roar ahead, the deadline
for the Y2K millennium bug was fast approaching as the decade came to a close. Fear that
the world of zeros and ones would not make the leap into the new year and would crash the
global electrical grid, leading to mass chaos, corporations of all sizes were upgrading oper-
ating systems, databases, servers, desktops, and networks in an effort to prevent a disaster. It
was a windfall in two areas: Open source and commodity-based computing infrastructure
was being deployed in bulk; and the fact that high-speed communications were available
worldwide, and there were nowhere near enough IT consultants to address the Y2K issues,
caused the phenomenon of outsourcing to India to explode. With the subsequent market
crash and industry layoffs, that trend would also continue.
At any rate, the frenzied pace to fend off the millennium bug would introduce security
issues in the form of unscrupulous programmers, lack of a vetting process with new out-

sourcing partners, and a general attitude of malaise in implementing security protections.
This patchwork mentality toward protecting electronic assets persists to this day and has pro-
vided the business driver for implementing Enterprise Security Management (ESM) solu-
tions. During this period in the technology timeline of the middle 1990s to the mid-2000s,
the ability to move assets around the globe in the form of electronic payments and physical
inventory became a key to competitive advantage.As we enter the later stages of the initial
decade of the new millennium, the ability to protect those electronic assets and physical
supply chains will become a key to competitive advantage as well.
Wall Street was in its glory during the times leading up to the technology bubble. Firms
of all sizes, both start-ups and established global players, were now valued based on their
capability to integrate technology platforms and software into the operation of the business.
E-commerce became the poster child of the new age of high-technology business produc-
tivity. When the inevitable end came crashing down on the high-technology market in 2001,
the industry players pulled back to evaluate where the next global growth opportunity
existed for IT products and services.
After the September 11 attacks, the security industry was the focus of worldwide atten-
tion.The venture capital community (long aligned with high-technology business models)
and Wall Street analysts showed increasing interest in the intersection of physical and logical
security applications with technology. Because the IT business was in a ﬂat cycle and the
$120 billion security market was embracing electronic technology, it made sense for the con-
vergence model to be a focus of the major IT vendors and their channel partners.The ven-
ture capital ﬁrms funded the early product development and Wall Street paid particular
attention as new competitors such as IBM and Cisco Systems entered the traditional security
market through mergers and acquisitions and partner strategies. In response, traditional phys-
ical security players also promoted new business models. One example was Stanley Security
Systems, a division of a 100-plus-year-old tool manufacturer, which has created a $1.3 billion
security division over three years of aggressive acquisitions.
As Intel founder Andy Grove stated,“The boom, bust, and build-out cycle of the tech-
nology bubble was healthy is one aspect: It built the global Internet.”Today the Internet has
advanced everything from global outsourcing to securing worldwide supply chains.As secu-
rity convergence accelerates the capability of security solutions to be deployed on a global
basis, it will elevate the role of security policy higher in the executive ranks.The new inno-
vations that began after September 11 and were initiated in the 2002 to 2003 time frame are
entering new markets, gaining traction in IT infrastructures, and changing security command
and control practices. Wall Street is particularly interested in how the ability of security
policy deployed across a global organization, and outbound to supply chain customers and
partners, can affect corporate stock valuations. Security convergence will extend its impact
beyond the companies focusing products and services into various market segments, and will
include the global supply chain and all of its associated infrastructure. In short, the conver-
gence of security policy across worldwide networks and platforms affects everyone, from
Wall Street to Main Street.

Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

Wall Street Still Needs a Yardstick: 
The Trusted Enterprise Valuation
This process of comparing competitive stocks from an IT infrastructure standpoint has not
gone away. However, the new benchmark is security policy (physical and electronic), not e-
commerce—in short, the trusted enterprise. Now that global communication networks, IT
infrastructures, and Web-based models are deployed to maximize collaboration and employee
productivity, how are business operations being protected? Are the security solutions that
provide the capability to protect and defend critical infrastructure and electronic assets part
of an enterprise security policy aligned with the IT infrastructure? Does the company pro-
vide a backup and disaster recovery plan to restore operations quickly in the event of
unforeseen emergency circumstances? Is a security culture part of the organization? Is the
security policy aligned with the business strategy of the respective business units? 
In the new age of global risk facing corporations today, these are the questions the Wall
Street analysts, boards of directors, and investors are asking. If Home Depot has a well-
thought-out security strategy aligned with its business units and in coordination with outside
suppliers and partners, and Lowes Corporation falls short by comparison, how does that fact
affect the valuation of the each company’s stock? Moving forward, the ability to deploy a
Trusted Enterprise Model will pay large dividends to organizations that focus on all aspects
of security. By building security processes into the supply chain, a company can streamline
and improve its operation.
For example,The Manufacturing Institute, the research arm of the National Association
of Manufacturers, claims that companies investing in supply chain security can expect to see
substantial beneﬁts in reduced transit times and inventory.The aforementioned retailers and
manufacturing ﬁrms, like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, with product inventories in the
supply chain on various rail, air, land, and sea lanes, have a vested interest in securing those
goods.Today’s inventory is en route, not in the warehouse.
This means that securing the lines of commerce and the business process will take on
added importance.The new threats of terrorism must be considered regarding the potential
impact of an attack on a seaport or transportation channel.A post-September 11 simulation
exercise forecasted that closing the nation’s ports for 12 days would cost the economy
approximately $58 billion.Additionally, it has been estimated that the cost on the global
supply chain should a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) be successfully deployed or deto-
nated in a container would approach $1 trillion in global losses.A pressing security concern
on a daily basis concerns increased threats from internal employees and organized theft rings
involving physical goods and electronic data theft via cyber terrorism.Add to the threat
matrix natural disasters, power outages, and the impact on business operations and company
reputation if these issues are not quickly contained, resolved, and effectively communicated
internally and to the public, and we understand that the scope of traditional security con-
cerns is enterprise-wide and integrated.

As the global economy continues to expand and the traditional
physical asset transitions to information assets, the need for conver-
gence of traditional physical security and cyber security functions
becomes more demanding. Companies need to continually assess
their risk posture and respond to the ever-changing threats.—Ray
O’Hara, senior vice president, Vance 
Prior to 2001, no one outside our intelligence and defense communities spent serious
time considering the impact that Al Qaeda would have on our ability to secure the opera-
tions of our businesses. Certainly terrorism had shocked the nation with the events in
Oklahoma City, but they were summed up to be caused by a small group of domestic
fanatics and were quickly dismissed in a business context, although that event will never be
forgotten. However, it is the predetermined goal of Al Qaeda and its loosely controlled afﬁli-
ates to destroy and/or otherwise disrupt our economy.
It is very important to concentrate on hitting the U.S. economy
through all possible means.—Osama Bin Laden
Just as our deﬁnition of what terrorist tactics are (e.g., ﬂying planes into buildings) has
expanded to reﬂect present-day events, so does our list of stakeholders in securing our compa-
nies, government institutions, families, and way of life.The Dictionary.com deﬁnition that best
deﬁnes stakeholder for our purposes is as follows: a person or group that has an investment,
share, or interest in something, as a business or industry.What is interesting is that a concept as
old as security can evolve to include such a diverse group of players (stakeholders) around the
globe and continue to expand as our view of security continues to evolve due to world
events.Added to the wild card of terrorism, unpredictable and destructive acts of nature, or
man-made events such as the port labor strike in Oakland, California, one consultant pegged
the estimated cost to the nation of a 10-day strike in Oakland’s port at $19.4 billion.About
7,900 jobs are directly tied to Oakland’s port, earning a payroll of $753 million, according to a
study by the consulting ﬁrm Martin Associates. But that doesn’t include the vintner who ships
wine abroad or the technology entrepreneur importing computer parts.
The importance of a secure global supply chain to the worldwide economy is as impos-
sible to overstate as it is to totally secure.At least we would have some ability to negotiate
with labor unions in our own country. Negotiations with terrorist extremists are simply not
possible. Combine these examples with the fact that the number one issue in regard to data
loss concerns the errors and omissions committed by employees—the human factor. Studies
have consistently shown hardware failure and human error to be the two most common
causes of data loss, accounting for roughly three-quarters of all incidents.The frequency and
impact of data loss can be greatly mitigated by taking proper precautions, such as utilizing
backup power supplies, conducting regular data backups, journaling ﬁlesystems, using redun-
dant storage (such as RAID), using antivirus software and ﬁrewalls, regularly installing secu-
rity ﬁxes, and educating users.
In this new era of security mindset, the trusted enterprise is gaining popularity and
mind share among senior executives and boards of directors.As government regulations such
www.syngress.com
230
Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

as SOX require ﬁnancial reporting standards on a regular basis, the health of the organization
from a security standard will also need to be addressed. One issue, which relates to the SOX
regulations, is the belief by many security professionals that the only way to truly secure a
process such as a supply chain is to regulate it. In this way, government would mandate the
standards and industry would be forced to comply ﬁnancially or face stiff penalties.At the
current time, approximately 75 percent of U.S. port terminal operations are controlled by
foreign-owned companies.Adding insult to injury,AMR reminds us that only between 5
percent and 6 percent of the 25,000 shipping containers that arrive on U.S. shores on a daily
basis are actually checked for WMDs. Stephen Flynn of the Council on Foreign Relations,
and a noted author, says, “We are living on borrowed time.The Number 1 national security
challenge to confront us is a weapon of mass destruction going off in a U.S. city. Well, it
could come into the country at a seaport. So we should focus on what it would take to
make sure that doesn’t happen.”
Identity and Veriﬁcation: The 
Foundation of the Trusted Enterprise
One deﬁnition of trust, according to Dictionary.com, reads: reliance on the integrity, strength,
ability, surety, etc., of a person or thing; conﬁdence. It deﬁnes verify as follows: to ascertain the
truth or correctness of, as by examination, research, or comparison.These are both solid
foundations from which to build the trusted enterprise.As former President Ronald Reagan
famously stated time and again in dealing with the Soviet Union on arms negotiation issues,
“Trust but verify.” He could have been deﬁning the meaning of identity management.
Identity management is the basis for a trusted enterprise deployment. It provides for the
essential security functions of enforcement (authentication and access privileges), provi-
sioning (enrollment and authorized access controls), and monitoring (auditing: who, what,
when, where, and how) which promote trust in ongoing operations. If we cannot trust and
verify that the people, processes, and infrastructure equipment are trustworthy, the entire
operation is suspect.
Companies offer innovative products at various levels of the Trusted Enterprise Model to
facilitate trust and veriﬁcation. For example, IBM offers Federated Identity Management
(FIM) solutions for managing identity and access to resources that span companies or secu-
rity domains. Rather than replicate identity and security administration at both companies,
the solution manages identities and authorizes access to information and services in a trusted
fashion.The foundation of federated identity is trust, integrity, and privacy of data, which
enables companies to extend identity and access management to third parties. Network com-
panies such as Cisco Systems securely manage who and what can access the network, as well
as when, where, and how that access can occur.The objective is to turn virtually every local
and remote network device into an integrated component of an overall enterprise security
strategy.This allows secure access and admission at any point in the network, and isolates
patching problems or infected devices.

The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8

As for additional infrastructure, trusted systems are mainly related to security engi-
neering.This involves areas such as risk management, surveillance, auditing, and communica-
tions. It investigates systems in which some conditional behavior of people or objects has
been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources. Some veriﬁcation can
involve additional steps such as a public key infrastructure- (PKI) generated certiﬁcate.As the
Web continues to expand and embrace more collaborative applications, Web networks of
trusted members are also important in creating trust metrics, which include both people and
systems.This touches on the concept of social networks where reputation management and
trust form the basis of social and commercial interaction among members of those sites and
how trust can be modeled within online communities.
Convergence has evolved to combine voice, data, video, and applications over wired and
wireless networks.This new deﬁnition of convergence is delivering new levels of produc-
tivity, collaboration, and cost savings to the enterprise. However, with the increased levels of
connectedness come new and more complex risks. Enterprises around the world are moving
decisively to converged IP networks. Nearly half of senior executives in a global survey con-
ducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit for AT&T say that IP convergence has been
implemented in all or most of their businesses, nearly double the number recorded in the
same 2005 survey. More than three-quarters say this will be the case within three years. The
rate of IP migration can no longer be termed evolutionary.This development reﬂects a signiﬁ-
cant shift in executive mindsets regarding the importance of network convergence to the
business.The vast majority of survey respondents—84 percent—view convergence as critical
or important to achieving their strategic IT and business goals, compared with 45 percent in
the 2005 survey.
“Better collaboration with customers, suppliers, and partners” and “better customer ser-
vice” are among the key rewards of convergence for global respondents, and are the top two
beneﬁts cited by North American executives. Most executives view security as the single
most critical attribute of network performance in their ﬁrms; at the same time, they consider
network security issues as their top convergence challenge.As global networks connect wider
audiences of business partners and suppliers, the ability to secure the network and establish
the identities of people and machines is at the heart of a trusted enterprise.
The concept of identity management is wide-ranging and, as mentioned, critical to a
trusted enterprise. It is important that security executives communicate to senior manage-
ment that identity management solutions are more than stand-alone solutions to regulatory
issues, or ways to protect assets, but rather that they provide a foundation for the longer-term
value of a trusted enterprise. In global enterprises, identity management will promote
“trusted” operations.A Unisys Corporation white paper,“Identity Management:A Business
Imperative in Building a Trusted Enterprise,” states:
Identity Management ensures transactional integrity with all rela-
tional parties. It is the basis for collaborative trust with suppliers,
distributors, and customers. In sum, Identity Management not only
satisﬁes regulatory compliance and corporate asset protection, but

also leverages that investment to improve the use of technology and
associated processes to better serve employees, customers, partners,
and suppliers—all of which improve the enterprise’s reputation and
bottom line.1
As the ability to converge information technologies with securing business processes
continues to gain momentum, the concept of the “trusted enterprise” will gain importance.
Convergence is, at its core, an effort that involves collaboration or sharing. In the process, this
opens an organization to additional levels of risk that this collaborative environment can
introduce threats from “untrustworthy” individuals or systems infected with a computer
virus.The value of collaboration is in the area of productivity improvement.The ability to
collaborate on a global basis can greatly leverage this factor.
Unfortunately, for corporations that do not prepare against the potential risks that
accompany collaborative software and business practices, this global sharing can negatively
impact operations and increase collective threats. Collaboration is a business driver that is
having a signiﬁcant impact on global business and a trend that will continue in the future. It
is in direct correlation to the development of the next generation of the workforce, which
grew up on PS2 and Xbox video game technologies where shared gaming is gospel.The
innovations being created in software will incorporate this mindset. It is one example of the
convergence on the electronic security side of the equation, but it must interoperate with
the ability to secure physical assets as well.
Technology consulting organizations such as Unisys are in front of this trend for the
simple reason that these ﬁrms offered the original consulting services to implement strategies
for just in time inventory management. Of course, this time frame was well before the reality
of global terrorist activities directed at supply chains.The business issue on the lips of execu-
tive management and boards of directors from these client organizations today has changed
from “just in time” to “just in case.”These individuals are responsible to corporate stake-
holders and shareholders to protect the business and outside investment against risk.As a
result, new product and services offering are being introduced to address the issue of
securing huge global supply chains that extend from businesses to suppliers to governments.
The fact that terrorist organizations have targeted commercial industry presents a clear and
present danger to industry. Osama Bin Laden has a stated purpose:“It is very important to
concentrate on hitting the U.S. economy through all possible means.”
Unisys Corporation: Leading 
the Way to the Trusted Enterprise
As a worldwide technology services and solutions company with customer installations well
represented in the Fortune 100 and leading government agencies, Unisys has a unique van-
tage point and the senior-level relationships to accurately anticipate market needs and trends.
The organization is positioned to provide a full range of services in consulting, systems inte-
gration, outsourcing, infrastructure, and server technologies to secure business operations for

clients on a global scale. Unisys is leading the IT industry in deﬁning a new era of security
and is taking a proactive approach in establishing trusted relationships throughout the busi-
ness cycle to improve productivity. In this scenario, security evolves from a strictly defensive
measure to one that adds value to the corporate business strategy by extending a policy of
trusted relationships throughout the global supply chain.This strategy positions security as an
integrated element of the global business strategy to protect human, physical, and electronic
assets, as well as corporate reputation. Unisys understands that although competing in a
global economy creates tremendous business opportunity, its customers are also operating in
a world of unprecedented risk.These risks are accelerating and the ability to protect and
defend the business on a global scale will provide a competitive advantage over the long
term.
Joe McGrath is the president and CEO of Unisys. He joined the company in 1999 as
senior vice president, Major Account Sales, and chief marketing ofﬁcer after a stellar career at
Xerox Corporation, where he led the color laser printer business from a start-up operation
to a dominant 70 percent global market share. Prior to Xerox, he held executive positions at
Gartner Group, a worldwide IT consulting ﬁrm. McGrath’s industry background and experi-
ence in sales and marketing were evident when, upon arriving at Unisys, he led a seven-
month initiative resulting in a global realignment of business operations. His instincts proved
to be correct and his progression at the company resulted in his appointment to president
and CEO in early 2004 and, soon after, CEO and board member in January 2005. McGrath’s
leadership has positioned Unisys as an innovator in providing best practices in securing crit-
ical global supply chains, and as a pioneer in creating the Trusted Enterprise Model.The
vision of the corporation is tightly aligned with the challenges of securing the business oper-
ations of its customers across the global economy.This strategy positions Unisys at the fore-
front of security convergence.
In his recent keynote speech at The 15th World Congress on IT, McGrath emphasized
the importance of securing global business operations in a high-risk global environment:
Globalization brings tremendous opportunities, but also more vul-
nerabilities than anyone could have possibly imagined. Security
often starts with identity authentication, yet to truly secure their
critical business operations today, companies and governments need
visibility into ﬁrst, middle, and last miles of the supply chain. They
need to protect and manage peoples’ identities, and also protect
and manage their products with the necessary visibility to respond
quickly to [the] ever-changing consumer and marketplace demands
of the new global economy. 
He went on to address the changing global market dynamic regarding global risk:
The term security must be redeﬁned and expanded to encompass
the new global realities of colliding economic, political, and con-
sumer forces that demand more accountability from businesses and
governments. From port security concerns to bird ﬂu risks to large-

scale identity thefts and cyber breaches, individuals, businesses, and
governments think differently today about what security and safety
mean. 
McGrath stressed that as a result, companies and governments need more visibility into
their operations to better plan ahead and more effectively manage risk, both for their cus-
tomers and for their constituents.
Unisys leverages its global position to align itself with leading industry think tanks and
independent consultants representing government, industry, and academia to stay ahead of
the global trends impacting their business operations. For example, the company has created
a broad research project called the Unisys Trusted Enterprise Index, a ﬁrst-of-its-kind survey
measuring the importance, impact, and inﬂuence of trust, privacy, and security within the
corporate world. Conducted in partnership with the Ponemon Institute, a privacy research
organization, the project polled 1,700 respondents from a sampling frame of more than
30,000 business and IT leaders composed of CIOs, CEOs, boards, and security and privacy
experts in the United States and the United Kingdom in September 2006.The ﬁrst phase of
the research polled CEOs and other senior business executives as well as senior IT executives
at leading U.S. and UK companies, and found a clear disconnect between the views of busi-
ness leaders and technology leaders on the factors that build and erode trust. IT leaders
placed a much stronger emphasis on protecting privacy and IT security and business leaders
focused on more ﬁnancial-oriented measures:
Business leaders:
■
Business leaders place value on risk management and good corporate gover-
nance practices to build trust much more than do IT leaders.
■
Business leaders believe negative cash ﬂows, a lack of shared values, and weak
ﬁscal management are much more likely to erode trust than do IT leaders.
Technology leaders:
■
IT leaders believe that positive media coverage, IP protection, and responsible
marketing practices build trust much more than do business leaders.
■
IT leaders ﬁnd that inadequate intellectual property protection, weak privacy,
and undependable IT erode trust much more than do business leaders.
Industries: Winners and Losers
Among all industries included in the research, retail banking is the most trusted in both the
United States and the United Kingdom. Beyond this, there are distinct differences in U.S.
business leaders’ views concerning trusted industries versus their UK counterparts.
Healthcare surfaced as among the most trusted industries in the United States, yet it is
among the least trusted in the United Kingdom. Similarly, government is highly trusted in
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
235

the United Kingdom and one of the least trusted sectors in the United States, according to
respondents.
Geographically, the top three most and least trusted industries are as follows:
■
United States Most trusted: retail banking, healthcare, and professional services.
Least trusted: insurance, telecom, and entertainment and media
■
United Kingdom Most trusted: retail banking, local government, and education
and professional services. Least trusted: entertainment and media, healthcare, and
retailing
The Unisys Trusted Enterprise Index will serve as a comprehensive tool for companies
and governments to better redeﬁne their own security and business processes for greater
impact and visibility into the cause-and-effect relationships between business and technology
goals.
Trust is an intangible asset that is often overlooked until it’s too
late.”—Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute
The survey found that despite an increased sensitivity to corporate ethics and compli-
ance among corporations today, customer satisfaction, leadership, prudent ﬁscal management,
and customer respect are ranked much higher by business leaders surveyed as the most inﬂu-
ential builders and stewards of trust. Factors including market capitalization, market share,
and others rank much lower.
“Many companies devote tremendous dollars and resources to increasing market value,
but as our research proves, in order to build trust among customers, employees, and investors,
they may be focused on the wrong factors, or ignoring the right ones altogether,” according
to Ponemon.The research highlights that although more quantiﬁable factors such as compli-
ance and ﬁnancial performance tend to get the attention of boards and their leaders,“softer”
factors that build trust—how a company treats customers or motivates employees—need
equal attention.
The commercial market leaders on the logical side of security convergence, such as
global ﬁnancial ﬁrms, will lead the charge in this effort to secure the global transport of dig-
ital information. One of the survey ﬁndings of particular interest to the ﬁnancial industry
revealed that three out of every four consumers said they are prepared to switch banks for
greater security protection of their personal information. Slightly more than 77 percent are
willing to change banks for better protection of their money.This represents a 50 percent
increase in willingness to switch banks, as compared to a 2005 Unisys study on identity fraud
and bank security issues.
These survey results should send chills down the spines of ﬁnancial executives and their
boards based on the potential damage to the institutions’ reputation and the exodus of good
customers, including high-net-worth individuals.These data points, combined with other
surveys indicating a continued reluctance of consumers to embrace online ﬁnancial transac-
tions, underscore the strong requirement for banking institutions to provide additional levels
www.syngress.com
236
Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

of security and consumer education. In reality, the potential of credit card fraud occurring at
a local restaurant is many times higher than when buying a product over the Internet.The
same percentages apply when considering written checks sent through the postal service
(especially when Social Security numbers accompany address information) versus online
banking.The point is that ﬁnancial institutions will continue to take a leadership position in
securing digital assets and educating the consumer.
As security convergence casts an ever-wider net across the world economy, it stands to
reason that many more people, places, and processes are caught up in its implementation as a
result of everyday interactivity. Far from being the interdepartmental solutions of an earlier
generation, today’s security solutions are open and interoperable, and scale around the globe.
Solutions that were traditionally stand-alone, such as video surveillance and access control
deployments, are now part of larger data sets and new software solutions created to advance
these base technologies. Independent solutions are then pieced together for wider global
application incorporating database technologies, storage and server infrastructures, failover
and disaster recovery capabilities, and worldwide network interoperability. Without this tech-
nical foundation, global business applications from manufacturing to supply chains are all but
impossible.
Security professionals must understand, implement, and operate effectively across this
global IT infrastructure; otherwise, their job to “defend the corporation” will also be all but
impossible.The critical ﬁrst step in this enterprise deployment process of a security policy
lies in providing the education to and garnering the support of members of the executive
staff and boards of directors.
Training employees on the process of security is a critical step in a trusted enterprise.
Additionally, the concept of the trusted enterprise in combination with industry groups and
alliances focused on the issues of standards and best practices is providing the industry
momentum to address the critical needs to secure global supply chains.The entire world
economy is at risk.
Redeﬁning Security: Trusted Leadership
Another example of thought leadership provided by Unisys is its creation of the Security
Leadership Institute (SLI), a forum of nationally recognized security experts from business
and government that provides insight into emerging security issues and best practices to
organizations worldwide.A goal of the SLI is to help both business and government leaders
to see “beyond the horizon” and gain security insights that can become key factors in their
long-range business strategy.The SLI seeks to better understand the challenges CEOs face in
protecting their organizations, employees, and assets.
According to Unisys, many of the CEOs interviewed thought the word security meant
either physical protection of employees or cyber protection of data networks and other tech-
nologies.Although CEOs acknowledged that these are important issues for their organiza-
tions, they see them as part of the domain of senior executive subordinates who reported to
their leadership team.This might explain why 36 percent of the respondents admitted that
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
237

their organizations have no one proactively managing the trust of the company, unlike the
way they monitor other key disciplines, such as ﬁnance, human resources (HR), and commu-
nications.
However, when the conversation shifted to operational risk management, CEOs readily
began to address the full spectrum of business protection issues they personally owned. For
them, operational risk management addresses business continuity, integrated business pro-
cesses, development of human capital, privacy, corporate ethics, intellectual property protec-
tion, and compliance.The CEOs and boards that are deeply engaged in proactively
understanding the organization’s operational risk proﬁle and mitigation policies/practices
operate with consistency and are focused on delivering value to their customer.
Principles of the Trusted Enterprise Model:
An Excerpt from the Unisys SLI Treatise
Unisys research has discovered that organizations pursuing the Trusted Enterprise Model
adhere to several common operating principles:
■
Management, at all levels, proactively evaluates, measures, and manages operational
risk.
■
Organizations relentlessly pursue corporate transparency, within the ﬁrm and
across all of its processes and practices.
■
CEOs and boards continuously engage in understanding and mitigating the orga-
nization’s entire risk proﬁle and assessing its impact on the business’s strategic
objectives.
■
Organizations develop risk-savvy cultures with clear accountabilities and enforce-
ment practices.
Modeling the Trusted Enterprise
At the core of a trusted enterprise is the basic understanding that security begins at the top,
with the board of directors, the CEO, and the executive staff. Something as critical as
securing the physical, electronic, and human assets of the company is the responsibility of
those in the positions of ultimate authority. One of the responsibilities of corporate gover-
nance lies in evaluating business risks and balancing them against growth opportunities. In
order for this to be effective, security must be integrated into the business plan and managed
like the ﬁnancial accounting practices that monitor other departments. In this way, security
can be integrated into a holistic policy supporting global business objectives. Just as business
is a process of continuous improvement, the enterprise security policy must also constantly
be evolving to be proactive against new threats and risks to the business. In this way, ensuring
the operational integrity of the electronic and physical assets of the business actually acts as
an enabler for achieving goals and competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

The Trusted Enterprise Model provides executives with a new managerial paradigm for
deploying security strategically, rather than tactically, to signiﬁcantly improve the overall
effectiveness of the organization.
The Challenges of Convergence…
Mitigating Risk: Achieving 
Operating Assurance Transparently
The modern enterprise is a very complex and dynamic collection of interre-
lated and interconnected processes. Getting all of these parts working
together to achieve operational success is the essence of the CEO’s task.
Controlling the potential failure of each of these parts individually, together
with the risk of failure of their mission-critical interactions, is the core multi-
plier of operational success. As one CEO reﬂected, “Risk management is not
about circling the wagons; it is about making sure we get across the mountain
safely.” Climbing Mt. Everest requires the ultimate in risk management skill for
a mountain climber. Taking a company to the equivalent of Mt. Everest
requires a CEO who understands and deals with the risks of securing and sus-
taining the premier position in his target market(s).
Establishing the Basics of Risk Mitigation
Six of the more important risk elements confronting the modern enterprise
are as follows:
■
Human resources (employees) People utilization, management,
and development 
■
Enterprise networks Local area networks (LANs), wide area net-
works (WANs), voice communications, and all network infrastruc-
ture elements (e.g., routers, servers, client machines, operating
systems, and applications software)
■
Physical assets Ofﬁces, manufacturing plants, laboratory facilities,
customer and corporate records, etc.
■
Trading and supply chain partners Upstream suppliers/vendors,
along with downstream customers
■
Customers Buyers’ experiences and satisfaction with the enter-
prise in all dimensions
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
239
Continued

■
Audit and compliance mechanisms Supporting systems and pro-
cesses together with the expertise needed to augment current
enterprise knowledge
Risk mitigation must address each element, both alone and as they inter-
relate with one another, to deliver enterprise products and services with min-
imum threat to operational success. Critical to these responses is a
comprehensive protection program that is built for each enterprise through
the direct leadership of its executive management based on the following
principles:
■
Prioritization is pivotal to cost control in risk management. Leaders
cannot do everything necessary to make every process risk-free.
■
A comprehensive risk schema bridging multiple elements assists in
lowering cost and making defenses more robust (layered). For
example, understanding the relationship between enterprise net-
work threats, competent and trustworthy human resources, and
rigorous audit and compliance mechanisms, and then designing
internal policies and processes that minimize these threats in real
time, is a powerful but difﬁcult-to-achieve goal.
■
Technology can be employed to improve visibility into operating
processes and policy compliance, but doing so will not eliminate
risk.
■
Awareness to risk proﬁles, symptomatic factors, mitigation actions,
and other conditions indicating the likelihood of occurrences must
be drilled into the culture of the institution from top to bottom by
the CEO to the point that all employees’ reactions are automatic,
thereby substantially offsetting vulnerabilities and reducing
destructive incidents.
The Impact of the Information Age 
on the Need for “Trusted” Operations
The information age is spawning a complete revolution and transformation in the way busi-
ness is conducted, and with that change, both new opportunities and new risks are
emerging. IT is helping economies grow at increasing rates because of the enormous
increases in productivity brought about by the new business processes made possible by net-
workcentric systems. Connectivity via these networks is spawning global operations and
enterprises, as well as new economic models for efﬁciency such as distributed manufac-
turing, just in time inventory, 24-hour call centers, and a multitude of other productivity and
www.syngress.com
240
Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

cost-cutting mechanisms.The beneﬁts are so pervasive and so compelling that these new sys-
tems and processes are often adopted in spite of the considerable risks that accompany the
beneﬁts.The pressure to make the enterprise more competitive using IT often overwhelms
the need to maintain a consistent posture of risk identiﬁcation, assessment, and management.
Early in this transformation to a digital economy it became apparent to many technically
savvy business and government leaders that accompanying it were signiﬁcant new threats to
their operations. In fact, new risks were posed by the rapid adoption of networked IT, partic-
ularly by the adoption of global network technologies such as the Internet. Computer secu-
rity was the earliest response to some of these new threats. But with the introduction of
these ubiquitous networks and the creation of the commercial Internet, distributed opera-
tions became a reality and so did the possibility of remote attacks across vast distances and
national boundaries.The challenges of protecting these complex networkcentric operations
proved much more difﬁcult, requiring equally complex layered defenses.
The principle of “layered defenses” refers to turning each element and line of defense
such as access control, ﬁrewalls, intrusion detection systems, ESM, encryption, and antivirus
mechanisms into an integrated set of tools for reducing risk based on the return on invest-
ment (ROI) of a given task. In a successfully layered model, mitigation elements are struc-
tured such that breaching one element does not give complete and ready access to all
enterprise data assets.Achieving a layered approach is difﬁcult, but vital to protecting critical
enterprise network information and operational assets.
In addition, institutions experienced new forms of fraud and misuse of their systems
from internal sources or insider threats. Disgruntled or malicious employees emerged as a
true threat, one that is extremely difﬁcult to compensate for and/or protect against.
Today, very few organizations have deployed truly trusted systems that minimize total
enterprise risk to their operations. Instead, many count on “security through obscurity”—
that is, hiding their vulnerabilities behind the sheer complexity of their networks, their soft-
ware applications, and their operating procedures, together with the use of “soft” security
technologies such as ﬁrewalls and passwords to achieve a semblance of protection. What
these leaders fail to comprehend is that complexity alone is not a strong defense or deter-
rent, particularly with networks. Most network systems, although highly complex, are
nonetheless very orderly in how they process information, thereby enabling ready connec-
tivity and access.The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) promotes
“connectivity,” not “security.”
So, the logical questions for an enterprise CEO to ask line “CXOs” (e.g., CFOs and
CIOs) is “How do we reduce the true risks associated with networkcentric operations? How
much security is enough?” However, neither question should be asked or answered from a
purely technological perspective.Although technology plays a signiﬁcant role in improving
enterprise operations, the accompanying business processes provide the resiliency in reducing
risk that characterizes a trusted enterprise.
The information age and its accompanying transformation of operational activities to
networkcentric systems puts severe stress on an institution’s capability to mitigate threats to
its business continuity, to combat fraud, and to prevent insider attacks; particularly in a
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
241

manner that equates to those deﬁning a “trusted enterprise.”The continuous pursuit of pro-
ductivity and efﬁciency leads the leadership of most institutions to deploy increasingly less
centralized processes, which in turn leads to business processes that are more susceptible to
disruption from natural disasters, as well as from directed attacks. Without careful design of
the enterprise protection architecture, and an accompanying schema of interrelated business
processes and internal controls, the enterprise will be increasingly vulnerable and its capa-
bility to function effectively and productively will be increasingly at risk.
To cope with this increased risk the enterprise CEO must set the agenda for the leader-
ship team to build effective business systems that are scoped and designed to minimize dis-
ruptions to the institution’s core operations. Mitigating risk means making business processes
more secure.There must be mechanisms for the detection, analysis, and, when appropriate,
protection, alert, and response to operating threats of all kinds. Core business processes must
have layered defenses preventing successful attacks by insiders and outsiders alike, particularly
outsiders who are assisted by insiders who provide them with sensitive information
describing the characteristics of the internal protective measures. In addition, this schema of
layered protective measures provides additional protection from many natural disasters threat-
ening business continuity. For example, a robust system of off-site ﬁle backup and restoration
not only provides protection from the impact of natural disasters, but is also part of a robust
system for auditing critical ﬁles and records and detecting insider threats.
Basic Elements of Building Secure Operations
The basic elements of fully secured enterprise operations include the following:
■
A sound, comprehensive enterprise protection architecture augmented by a schema
of well-documented, well-understood, and routinely practiced business processes
■
A rigorous system for the detection, analysis of, and, when appropriate, alert to and
protection from threats to enterprise operations and systems
■
The ability to sustain continuity of operations during any conceivable threat
■
Rapid recovery mechanisms to restore full operations once a threat is controlled
■
The ability to analyze and apply forensics to determine what happened when an
incident occurs and to incorporate lessons learned to improve future risk mitiga-
tion processes 
Security and risk management mechanisms will vary greatly for different kinds of insti-
tutions, as well as for different operating units within a single enterprise.They will also
overlap. For example, the mechanisms for controlling risk to physical assets will include
things such as employee identity badges, automatic door locks, special access areas, network
access controls, video surveillance, and perhaps even radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) of
high-value assets.Access to network systems may be controlled by two-factor identity tokens
(the token is something “you have,” and when used together with something “you know”—
www.syngress.com
242
Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

for example, a password—access is granted), which are kept up-to-date by the HR system
that also supports physical access control mechanisms.
Particularly sensitive operations such as ﬁnancial or manufacturing systems will have spe-
cial controls limiting access to only those individuals having good and sufﬁcient reason to
access them. Institutional and customer records will be backed up very often and stored off-
site so that reconstitution is possible even when encountering the worst possible kind of
calamity. Intellectual property is given special protection, both physically and in network-
accessible systems, using controlled access and by giving special attention to new threats such
as cell phone cameras and Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory tokens that can be used to
capture and exﬁltrate sensitive information.Audits of business processes and ﬁnancial opera-
tions and access to privacy-related information, if conducted often and augmented by auto-
mated reviews highlighting suspect or questionable activities, are highly effective in
identifying potential exposures and threats. Critical data strategies will also involve reliable
backup software and systems in the event that data needs to be restored after a loss.A backup
may be required to restore an operating system in relation to disaster recovery operations, or
simply to restore individual ﬁles, mostly due to operator errors. Successful recovery from data
loss requires an effective backup strategy having some proportionality between the impor-
tance of the data lost and the magnitude of effort required to recover it.
Trading and supply chain partners will be subjected to careful scrutiny of their HR,
physical, and network security processes to ensure consistent levels of control over their
employees’ access to employee records, physical assets, and networked systems. Systems
touching customers will be designed to promote good reactions both by the easy but secure
experience of doing business with the enterprise, and by conveying care and concern for
their privacy and security.
Increasingly, risk mitigation measures will be embedded in common, shared business
processes and systems, which when viewed as a whole will constitute a comprehensive,
seamless and transparent approach to ensuring that the enterprise sustains uninterrupted
operations while delivering the highest levels of quality and performance.There have been
many examples of modern attempts to embed risk management into business processes, but
unfortunately, too many were not well developed and certainly not transparent. However, we
can look forward to the following in the immediate future:
■
Physical and network access control systems are converging Underlying
technologies for identity management are reasonably well developed and available,
but systems that are easily deployed, reasonably priced, and trustworthy are not yet
widely available.This is an area where incremental step-by-step deployment of a
series of fully tested components can, over time, be beneﬁcial, rather than
attempting to deploy the perfect system as a single deployment. Integration of
identity management enrollment processes with HR and physical security systems
is potentially more important than the deployment of complex technologies such
as biometrics and smart cards. Once the identity management function is in place
and operating, introduction of more robust identity prooﬁng mechanisms such as
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
243

smart cards makes sense and use of biometrics for very high-risk operations or
assets becomes more valuable.
■
ESM tools enable ﬁne-grained monitoring of network operations
Network threats such as worms and viruses can pose an enormous threat to an
enterprise.There are recent examples where the zero day impact (the ﬁrst day of
the appearance of a new worm or virus) has literally stopped enterprise operations
cold (e.g., the SQL worm launched in early 2003). In the early days of network
protection thinking, emphasis was focused on anomaly detection, or intrusion
detection systems.As networks became more complex, the number of events that
could be captured by intrusion detection systems escalated rapidly. In parallel, ﬁre-
wall, router, server, encryption, and authentication systems were also pumping out
millions of events. Hence, the need to correlate events and evaluate the risk of
attack has become paramount and has spawned development of ESM systems that
allow enterprise network and security managers to not only monitor threats as they
unfold in real time, but also to deal with them using “kill” processes that are not
harmful to enterprise operations, and do not disrupt revenue-producing activities.
■
Fraud detection and protection are desired by enterprise management
and customers alike To be satisfactory to both parties, these processes must be
highly transparent (nearly invisible) and accurate (false positives are not easily toler-
ated by the customer; nor are false negatives acceptable to enterprise manage-
ment).The best system will be right 100 percent of the time, while not interfering
with customers’ buying experiences.Absent such a system (and no such system is
available today), the enterprise is left with taking a layered approach to the risk,
understanding that some customers will be offended and sometimes the institution
will ﬁnd itself a victim of an occasional scam. But in this age of networked trans-
actions that run the gamut from hundreds of thousands of transactions at a value of
$50 each, to dozens of transactions at $100,000 each online, it is only possible to do
the best we can to detect and prevent fraud.The gaming industry has developed
online systems for checking high-roller bonaﬁdes without offensive processes or
privacy intrusions and at acceptable risk.Although the methods are not necessarily
directly transferable to other institutions, by careful design of comparable operating
processes, layered security, select technology, and appropriate audit practices, a suc-
cessful model can be emulated.
■
Policy enforcement and monitoring will be improved dramatically using
simple, well-understood technologies With common tools such as immutable
audit logs, policy engines that compare transaction characteristics (who, what,
where, and why) to the policy constraints can be implemented. Unfortunately, this
area is another where much work is yet to be done to harness the technologies
into a fully integrated, transparent, and easy-to-administer solution.

■
Information sharing is the key to unlocking productivity enhancement
In many cases, information sharing is also the critical element in the most suc-
cessful business processes, ranging from research and development to sales.The
modern enterprise is increasingly dependent on how well and how fast informa-
tion ﬂows between and among its executives, management, operational teams, and
team members. Most operating activities today are “team events” and cannot be
accomplished successfully by a single independent individual. Many tools are avail-
able today that promote connectivity, one-to-one, and one-to-many information
sharing.A few newer tools promote many-to-many sharing or collaboration and
they are improving continuously.These tools are not very secure, nor do they
enhance the enforcement of information protection or continuity controls, because
they often are what might be characterized as “out-of-band” or unstructured com-
munications.
Each method of employing technology to secure business processes has accompanying
risks and the CEO must be aware of them, assess the potential balance of risk versus gain,
make calculated decisions, and then put in place the mechanisms necessary to measure, mon-
itor, and report their efﬁcacy. Collaboration and sharing information while increasing pro-
ductivity carries an additional risk factor for a company. Software designed to secure the
transmission of data over networks, as well as to secure “data at rest” on storage servers, can
be installed to mitigate risks.A centralized administration policy involving numerous
antivirus and security software can also be deployed to better manage larger networks with
multiple-vendor software packages.A comprehensive administration policy that takes into
account storage, backup systems, network security, a managed software installation and
upgrade process, and end-user education will provide additional security beneﬁts.
The New Achilles Heel: 
Assessing the Risk It Imposes
As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the new challenge in enterprise risk is the
global network and the increased connectivity it brings to all business processes, including
those internal to the enterprise and those external to its owned operations—as well as those
executed within the private sector and within governments.The advantages of networkcen-
tric business operations are compelling and there is increasingly little alternative but to capi-
talize on them. But the risks associated with networkcentric operations are potentially large,
and therefore, they must be addressed systematically.Although there are some formal deter-
ministic methods for assessing and analyzing risk in networks and software systems, it is
unlikely that either the CEO or her oversight board will be equipped to evaluate and inter-
pret the results in a meaningful way.The tools and formal methods that do exist are typically
part of the CIO’s repertoire and are not well suited to the strategic assessments the CEO and
oversight board are responsible for making. In fact, they can be harmful at the strategic level,

The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
245

if they mask the complexity of interaction between parts of the enterprise protection archi-
tecture or the interactions within highly networked business systems.
What is more appropriate and useful to the CEO is to have a continuous dialog with
the CIO and other appropriate business executives on basic risk exposure issues regarding
deployed network operations and networkcentric business processes.These dialogs can be
facilitated by a standard set of questions regarding the basic nature and underlying structure
of the systems and a set of measurements that allow the CEO and oversight board to track
actual exposure and performance. Here is a suggested complement of nine standard questions
that can be adapted readily to various enterprise situations, and which together form the
basis for a set of measurements that will provide everyone on the leadership team with a
common window into her institution’s respective risk environment proﬁle:
■
How secure is the enterprise network infrastructure? Is sensitive business data pro-
tected from outside attempts to gain access to restricted systems and resources? Is
the authentication and identity management system in use considered adequate to
the task of protecting the kind of information that is available in the network? Are
incidents involving attempts to gain access logged and audited, and is the informa-
tion collected with sufﬁcient forensics integrity to allow enforcement of standing
security policies governing improper use of the enterprise’s systems?
■
How secure are network operations that extend beyond the enterprise? Is any
control exerted over the security standards employed in partners’/suppliers’ net-
works? Can access policies regarding outside vendors be enforced without com-
promising mission-critical operations? Can competitors gain access to enterprise
data through a partner’s or supplier’s systems or harm the institution by virtue of
access to or blockage of enterprise transactions?
■
Are communications of the enterprise, both within and external to its infrastruc-
ture, protected from third-party access and scrutiny? Are insecure modes of e-mail,
instant messaging (IM), or e-mail attachments undermining the overall security
posture of sensitive operations or making conﬁdential matters available to unau-
thorized individuals inside or outside the enterprise? Are there policies and guide-
lines for such communications for normal matters and for particularly sensitive
matters such as mergers and acquisitions, HR, or ﬁnancial information? Is there a
plan to improve the security of these communications over time?
■
Is security effectiveness measured? What trends are reported and what is driving
both good and bad directions in the trends? Are the trends and their implications
readily understood by all?
■
Are all practical alternative means of dealing with complex risk, such as hiring spe-
cialists as consultants to design mechanisms that will be more effective, cost less, or
both, being considered continuously? Are iterative processes for identifying,
www.syngress.com
246
Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating risks in place and working effectively? Who is
in charge of that process? Are outcomes acceptable?
■
Do line and functional managers have a formal role in owning and protecting the
information that is the foundation of their respective operations? Do they partici-
pate in the decision process that accompanies the identiﬁcation, assessment, priori-
tization, and mitigation of networkcentric operations?
■
Are approaches to security and risk management benchmarked against others in
the enterprise’s economic, competitive, or peer group sector(s)? 
■
Are recent court cases ruling on enterprise liability for loss of data, privacy
infringement, or operational loss monitored actively?
■
Is a mechanism in place to respond to threats to the enterprise’s core operational
processes? Can core operating processes survive a breach? Are the CEO and over-
sight board in danger of betting the enterprise on fragile security practices for mis-
sion-critical functions? What are the odds and the costs of mitigation? Are they in
balance and are they acceptable to all enterprise stakeholders?
Given solid and believable answers to each question, a CEO and oversight board should
be able to assess the readiness of the enterprise to meet the most threatening challenges in its
risk universe with reasonable accuracy and completeness.This is the beginning of what will
of necessity become a continuing saga of assessment, armament, awareness, and corporate
culture change. Putting the journey off will not do; the risks and the costs of ignorance are
too high. Remember what happened to Achilles.
The Critical Imperative: Continuous
Measurement of Preparedness 
“You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”
The increasing risks associated with IT network-based operating processes place a huge
and increasing burden on line managers to measure the risk confronting their respective
organizations on a continuous basis—constantly probing for threat trends and for outright
breaches. One element that can be measured readily is loss. How much money, product, or
service value is being delivered by enterprise networks and systems without compensating
value being returned to the organization? Another factor that is more difﬁcult to measure is
“lost opportunity,” which can be reﬂected in system and network availability, workforce pro-
ductivity, and customer/citizen satisfaction. Finally, the increasing risks associated with critical
assets can be estimated, based on break-in history and other attempts to obtain critical infor-
mation of beneﬁt to competitors or other adversaries.
There is a need for a standard dashboard that provides these measurements to the execu-
tive leadership and drives the focus of proactive risk management considerations toward real
threats in real time. Each responsible executive manager of core functions, including the
www.syngress.com
The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
247

CIO, CFO, and line operating managers, should design dashboards that meet their needs, but
the CEO should select from these dashboard systems the key information needed to stay in
touch with the risk components of the entire enterprise: strategic, operational, and tactical.
Delivery of the information should be in real time and be accumulated into databases for
periodic analyses, trend identiﬁcation, and formal reviews both with oversight boards and
with subordinate management.The system of collection, analysis, and delivery of dashboard
information should be well deﬁned and, to the maximum extent possible, generated auto-
matically with a minimum of human intervention or manipulation.
When events reﬂecting increased risk to the enterprise are detected by a responsible unit
manager or by a “CXO,” those risks must be dealt with immediately. Each occurrence
should be analyzed and classiﬁed according to the degree of risk it represents and whether it
reﬂects systemic and fundamental ﬂaws in the business process. Whenever possible, results of
each signiﬁcant “risk event” should become a “lesson learned” and should be used in
ongoing efforts to deal with other threats and risks encountered by the institution.
The process of confronting risk in any organization is the job of the CEO. Leadership
from that level of management in making risk mitigation a fundamental daily activity, fully
embedded in the culture of the enterprise, is paramount. Properly led, the senior manage-
ment team will coalesce around the concept that the unique success of a trusted enterprise is
built on the foundation of recognizing, analyzing, and dealing effectively with each level of
risk that accompanies and challenges the quality, integrity, and continuity of its ongoing
operations.
Packaging a Program to 
Make Risk Mitigation an Enterprise Reality  
It may be useful to end this chapter with yet another set of questions that help gauge where
an organization stands on its way to dealing with the inherent risks of operating effectively
in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Hopefully, having read the foregoing discussions of the exposure
issues and the various approaches to mitigating them, everyone who reads this chapter can
add to these questions, and should do so.The purpose of these questions is to trigger insight
into the cultural and organizational health of your respective organizations as you proceed
on your journey to building a trusted enterprise.

Trusted enterprise vital signs:
■
Do enterprise leaders and their workforce see regulation and oversight as the
pathway to better business practices and market advantage? Are they continu-
ously thinking of new ways to make visibility and compliance monitoring
more embedded and transparent?
■
Is an enterprise-wide regulatory compliance-monitoring program in place, led
and actively participated in by the CEO?

Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise

■
Are new laws evaluated to understand their impact on extant operating poli-
cies and practices?
■
Are ethics and compliance activities integrated into one cohesive, holistic
approach to serving enterprise stakeholders?
■
Do the CEO and the oversight board receive and review a compliance status
report at each board meeting?
■
Are third-party suppliers’ and partners’ internal controls sound and protected?
Are they audited and are results shared with all participants?
■
Is there broad understanding of what is vital to sustain enterprise operations
and have active controls been put in place to protect mission-critical elements?
■
Are external links to suppliers and customers recognized as being critical to
success, and are they protected appropriately?
■
Are preventive controls in place to stop serious problems from impacting core
operating and IT processes?
■
Are critical assets monitored on an ongoing basis?
■
Are suspicious activities investigated and shut down quickly, and are partici-
pating employees prosecuted?
■
Are repeated patterns of negligence or noncompliance routinely detected and
stopped, and are violators punished appropriately?
■
Organizational attitudes and practices:
■
Does the institution evaluate its opportunities in light of their respective
impact on the organization’s short-range and longer-term risk proﬁles?
■
Are concrete policies in place regarding the identiﬁcation and mitigation of
enterprise risks on an enterprise level?
■
Is a well-organized and structured approach in place to identify risks at the
strategic and operational levels and to have those risk proﬁles reviewed by the
CEO and the oversight board for possible action?
■
Are issues evaluated to determine their potential impact on operational suc-
cess, and are they ranked to set priorities and to allocate resources based on
consequence analysis estimates?
■
Are risk-associated events measured and trends and impacts evaluated by the
CEO and oversight board for potential policy and/or practice changes?
■
Does the CEO discuss risk exposure and mitigation initiatives with enterprise
leadership on a regular basis? Is their awareness of trust policies high and do
they participate actively in routine prevention training?

■
Is compromise a vital element in deciding what to do to mitigate risk, or is it
treated as an all-or-nothing “management” decision?
These questions are a good list by which to qualify the degree of shared responsibility to
risk mitigation that exists in a given organization.At the root of a trusted enterprise is the
ability to cost-effectively manage risk.This process requires collaboration among various
groups within the company and an ability to clearly communicate a process of continuous
measurement. In addition, education examples of best practices must stress the underlying
concept of shared responsibility to the mission of protecting corporate assets.
Can the organization initiate new operational activities quickly, while still integrating
risk management and compliance measures into their launch? CEOs committed to the
Trusted Enterprise Model achieve greater integration of their leadership team, deepen the
loyalty of their workforce, and engender more involvement from their oversight boards. Most
important, they deliver stronger results to their shareholders and greater value to their stake-
holders.

The Challenges of Convergence…
An Industry Alliance for Trusted Computing Systems 
As the concept of the trusted enterprise continues to gain momentum, it is
important to recognize collaboration with other industry alliances on the con-
cept of trusted infrastructure and secure operations. Wikipedia describes the
Trusted Computing Group (TCG), a successor to the Trusted Computing
Platform Alliance (TCPA), as an initiative led by AMD, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
Inﬁneon, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems to implement trusted
computing. Trusted computing (commonly abbreviated as TC) is a technology
developed and promoted by the TCG. The term is taken from the ﬁeld of
trusted systems and has a specialized meaning. In this technical sense, trusted
does not necessarily mean the same as trustworthy from a user’s perspective.
Rather, trusted computing means that the computer can be trusted by its
designers and other software writers not to run unauthorized programs. One
goal of the organization was the development of a trusted platform module
integrated directly into chip sets enabling trusted computing features. The
next project involves a trusted network connection that provides similar secu-
rity protocols for authorizing network clients based on factors such as hard-
ware conﬁguration, operating systems, and antivirus software conﬁgurations.

Chapter 8 • The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise
Continued

According to the TCG Web site (www.trustedcomputinggroup.org), a
trusted computing model is one in which the following elements are built into
the enterprise protection system:
■
Authentication
■
Data protection
■
Network attestation and platform measurement
■
Application protection
■
Content protection
The Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. white paper on Trusted Enterprise
Security, also on the TCG Web site, reiterates the elements needed for building
a trusted computing environment with the following guidelines:
Rather than base security on a “black list” approach that tries to identify
and block things that should happen, why not utilize a “white list” model that
deﬁnes the behavior that actually is allowed and blocks everything else? ESG
believes that a “white list” or Trusted Enterprise Model is far more compelling
given IT complexity and constant ﬂux. “Trusted” security has been used effec-
tively on a limited basis but to extend this model and make it a foundation for
enterprise security, IT technologies must do the following:
■
Include the concept of identity To prevent IT components from
gaining malicious or accidental access to restricted areas, all tech-
nology piece parts need an identity—a unique and standard name
proving that they are who they say they are. In the physical world,
U.S. citizens have a unique Social Security number that has been
used as a form of individual identity.2 IT devices, systems, and
applications need this same type of system based upon unique
identities.
■
Build upon identity with strong authentication To make identity a
building block of security, it must be supported with a failsafe
method of authentication where one entity can identify another
entity with absolute certainty. This kind of authentication must be
tamperproof to ensure that identities cannot be stolen, copied, or
falsiﬁed.
■
Allow organizations to create trust relationships Once technolo-
gies have unique secure identities that can be authenticated, large
companies must have the capability to map technology entities
together to form trust relationships. For example, entities A and B
could be grouped into an exclusive trust relationship based upon
their identities. In this example, no other identity is trusted by
either A or B, and all are therefore restricted from communicating
with both. By deﬁning who can participate in an activity, trust

The New Security Model: The Trusted Enterprise • Chapter 8
251
Continued

relationships preclude malicious outsiders from gaining access to
an IT asset and thus lower the risk of an accidental or intentional
compromise.
■
Guarantee information conﬁdentiality and integrity Once a trust
relationship between entities is established, all subsequent com-
munication passed back and forth must be protected against
prying eyes. In addition, a receiver must have assurance that the
information received actually came from the sending party and
was not altered in any way while in transmission.
This security model is not new; this type of infrastructure is based upon
security technologies such as PKI, digital certiﬁcates, encryption, and hashing.
One beneﬁt of a trusted computing model is the ability for organizations to lower their
risk exposure and cost of compliance by standardizing on secure hardware platforms, security
software, and best practices.The model provides an added degree of security protection to a
corporation in general and a global supply chain in particular.The trusted computing model
is not without detractors who feel that the security enhancements are too restrictive and will
limit user ﬂexibility by allowing third parties control over their personal computers. Moving
forward, changes could be incorporated into the trusted computing model to alleviate these
concerns. One suggestion is a software override feature to allow more user control. Whatever
the continuing issues may be, compromises must be reached for the greater good. Global
industry is evolving rapidly and coming to terms with the fact that the risk to digital asset
security is critical and getting worse. Without the checks and balances of a global business
model based on a trusted enterprise, one which addresses both physical and electronic secu-
rity, our global information infrastructure and global commerce model is at risk.
As the global reach of organizations and their associated security processes continues to
expand, so too does the scope of stakeholders at all levels who are both directly and indi-
rectly associated with the company’s capability to secure its internal operations, external rela-
tionships, and corporate reputation. Security convergence has impacted groups of business
professionals as diverse as venture capitalists and union representatives. From top-secret gov-
ernment agencies and think tanks where innovations are ﬁrst created and deployed, to early
adopters in the military complex and, later, commercial installations in our major ﬁnancial
institutions, the convergence life cycle casts a wide net. Perhaps none is wider, or more
important, than the global supply chain.As security evolves into a more prominent position
within the priorities of global corporations, state and local governments, and countries in the
new age of “extreme risk,” our institutions will be judged as “trusted” based on their capa-
bility to execute an effective enterprise security policy into their global business operations.
In a recent ﬁnding, more than 40 percent of the surveyed Global 1000 organizations
stated they project e-business will generate more than 20 percent of their revenue within 36
months. In addition, the majority of those same Global 1000 organizations plan to collabo-
rate with customers, partners, and suppliers to positively impact organizational productivity.

Central to their capability to realize the beneﬁts of margin improvement and productivity
enhancements across the supply chain is establishing the appropriate levels of trust—not only
in the identities with which they are interacting, but also in the process by which they col-
laborate. Security and privacy are no longer an add-on to corporate operations.They are an
integral part of the supply chain. With identity management, security steps into the role of
business enabler. It is fundamental to an organization’s capability to open its doors to deeper
collaboration with customers, partners, and suppliers. (Source: Ponemon Institute Research) 
Conclusion
Unisys is one leading company that demonstrates an understanding that private and public
sector collaboration is critical to improving global security. Ultimately, success will require a
framework to identify, track, and protect people, products, and information. It demands tech-
nologies old and new, all connected through a clear digital blueprint and aligned within a
security policy based on a Trusted Enterprise Model.
“Seeing today is the path to securing tomorrow,” says Unisys CEO, Joe McGrath.
“Security—in a new world—is not merely about what can go wrong, but what needs to go
right. Organizations today operate on a slender thread, delicately striking a balance between
security as defense and protection, and security as conﬁdence and trust.That slender thread
can unravel or break at a moment’s notice.To achieve success, you must be more secure,
[but] not [just] in a physical sense; you also need to be more conﬁdent.This means an orga-
nization has to be visible—not merely preventing problems, but also inspiring conﬁdence in
the marketplace.”

nology services and solutions company with annual revenues exceeding $6 billion. It is an
industry leader in leveraging innovative technologies to secure worldwide supply chains and to

Introduction
The chapters in this section of the book (Chapters 9 through 12) are intended to give you a
strong primer in Enterprise Security Management (ESM) so that you can obtain the greatest
beneﬁt from the case studies starting in Chapter 13.This chapter in particular will focus
speciﬁcally on the what, why, and how of ESM. What is it? Why is it a logical foundation for
physical and logical security convergence, and how is it used? As such, it may be helpful to
use this chapter as a reference when reading the case studies in Chapter 13.
What Is ESM?
Enterprise Security Management (ESM) is a general term that has been applied to security
event monitoring and analysis solutions. Plenty of acronyms have been thrown around over
the years to describe these solutions. Some of them include the following:
■
EEM Enterprise Event Management
■
SIM Security Information Management
■
SEM Security Event Management
■
SIEM Security Information and Event Management
ESM is actually an enhancement and combination of all of these solutions.The focus of
ESM is to allow an analyst to monitor an organization’s infrastructure in real time, regardless
of product, vendor, and version.This vendor-agnostic approach helps simplify tasks related to
analysis, reporting, response, and other facets of log monitoring. ESM systems have tradition-
ally been applied to IT security, insider threats, and compliance, but their extensibility has
stretched far beyond these areas in the past few years to include a wider set of solutions.
However, it all starts with the collection of logs, error messages, faults, and alerts, collectively
referred to in this section simply as logs and, starting in Chapter 11, as events once the ESM
has processed the logs.These logs can come from any number of sources, including the 
following:
■
Traditional security products
■
Firewalls
■
Intrusion detection and prevention systems 
■
Virtual private networks (VPNs)
■
Antivirus software
■

To expand upon some of the traditional uses of ESM, consider the examples in the fol-
lowing subsections.
External Attack
An external attacker is attempting to penetrate an organization’s network.A network intru-
sion detection system detects the exploit.A ﬁrewall accepts the trafﬁc because it is coming
across an open port.The application running on the target server fails. In this example, the
ESM solution collects logs from all these point solutions, correlates and prioritizes them, and
alerts the analyst to the situation, providing that analyst with actionable information.
Malicious Insider
A disgruntled contractor that as been added to the ESM system’s suspicious watch list (a
mechanism for more closely monitoring individuals that have demonstrated unusual or sus-
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
257

picious behavior) accesses multiple ﬁle shares and copies sensitive information to his work-
station. He then copies the ﬁles to a removable media device.Although no security-speciﬁc
point solutions are involved in this operation, access to the ﬁle share, copying ﬁles to his
workstation, and copying ﬁles to removable media all generated logs which the ESM system
captured. Based on the assets that the contractor accessed, the suspicious watch list he is part
of, and the supporting evidence chain, the ESM system can generate an alert.
Compliance
A common request for regulatory compliance auditors is to ask the IT staff to provide them
with access control information such as login information for systems associated with the
audit. Because ESM systems collect the logs and make them available for reporting, gener-
ating very speciﬁc reports that are associated with only the ﬁnite set of information the audi-
tors are concerned with is simple.Additionally, regardless of vendor, format, and so on, the
logs can be rendered in an easy-to-understand report. In practice, this can mean the differ-
ence between a 10-page access control report containing what is needed, and overkill in the
form of a 10,000-page report simply containing everything.
We will explore many of these sources within the case studies starting in Chapter 13,
but the takeaway for this chapter is that if an asset creates a log and the ESM can capture
that log, it can be used.This is one reason why ESM is so well positioned to be at the center
of a physical and logical security convergence program. Regardless of where the logs come
from, it is just another data feed.
Beyond Log Collection
Once the ESM system has collected the logs, it will use real-time, automated techniques
such as correlation, anomaly detection, pattern discovery, and visualization to reduce false
positives, prioritize the information, and alert an analyst to a potential issue. We explain these
terms in detail in the other chapters in this section, so to stay on point regarding architecture
we won’t elaborate on them here.
ESM also facilitates a framework for security analysts to apply human intuition to issues
through interactive charts, visual tools, and investigative techniques.This powerful combina-
tion of automated and human-driven analysis makes the identiﬁcation of risks more efﬁcient
and effective.
ESM systems can also offer a number of forensics analysis and incident management fea-
tures. From a forensics investigation perspective, ESM supports advanced discovery tech-
niques, reporting, and analysis applied against data that is stored within the ESM database. In
terms of response, ESM generally offers case management and integration with third-party
ticketing systems such as Remedy.Additionally, it provides alerting and escalation features
which you can conﬁgure to work in parity with organizational processes such as change
management procedures.
Another feature of ESM is the capability to actually modify devices with or without
human intervention in order to stop an attack. Here are some examples of these responses:

■
Disabling user accounts 
■
Filtering the Internet Protocol (IP) address on ﬁrewalls, layer-3 switches, and
routers
■
Terminating sessions on VPNs, wireless access points, intrusion prevention systems,
and other network devices
■
Quarantining devices to separated and controlled virtual local area networks
(VLANs)
■
Stopping access at layer 2 by applying Media Access Control (MAC) address ﬁlters
or disabling a physical port on a switch 
To understand this better, consider the situation in which an ESM system collects var-
ious VPN logs and processes them. It determines that malicious activity sourced from a VPN
connection is entering through the organization’s network perimeter.An ESM alert notiﬁes
the analyst of the incident. Working in conjunction with the network operations staff, the
security analyst stops the malicious activity using a combination of native ESM capabilities
and network response capabilities to terminate the VPN connection and disable the user’s
account on a central access control system such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP).This process helps connect the lines between incident detection and incident 
management.
From a business operations perspective, ESM can also help communicate risk and compli-
ance. Senior managers and executives alike commonly rely on output to make them aware of
their organization’s security posture.Armed with this information, more-educated decisions
can be made about risk acceptance, risk remediation, and risk management.As mentioned
earlier, compliance is also an important part of an ESM system’s features, with the capability
to develop clear reports, aid in analysis, and assist in tracking assets that are associated with IT
governance and forms of regulatory compliance such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(SOX), Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of
1999 (GLBA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
Now that you have a high-level understanding of ESM and its capabilities, let’s explore
its relationship to physical and logical security convergence.
ESM at the Center of Physical 
and Logical Security Convergence
Logical security is becoming more tightly integrated with physical security every year.
Digital solutions and IP-based protocols are becoming the standard for physical security, and
they are dropping in price. For example, the cost to deploy digital surveillance cameras and
store their compressed data is far less today than it was just a few years ago.As these tech-
nologies become more integrated, they can provide checks and balances such as comparing
video surveillance and badge reader information with VPNs and other forms of logical

access. From an operational perspective, a view into each discipline will become a require-
ment for incident prevention, detection, and management. Having a central location for
investigation, analysis, correlation, and prioritization across the board just makes sense.All this
feeds into better controls for compliance and enforcement of policy and, ultimately, a faster,
more effective method for reducing risk while increasing operational efﬁciencies. ESM helps
with this by providing several critical features.
By aggregating physical and logical logs into a central location, an organization can get a
holistic perspective of its security posture. Having all the information within a central reposi-
tory allows for more thorough investigation and analysis. Information can be correlated and
prioritized and can yield actionable results for analysts.
Because most ESM systems feature an integrated case management system and bidirec-
tional connectivity with third-party ticketing systems, physical and logical security teams can
collaborate more effectively with each other. Important features that make collaboration
work include alerting, escalation, and case management.This helps to cut down on confusion
regarding job responsibilities during an incident.
Because access controls are built into ESM solutions, the types of features and types of
logs that a physical and logical security group can access will be tightly controlled.This is an
important point in terms of reporting, because a daily report might need to be generated for
each security team lead. Different security teams will be concerned with similar or different
issues.Therefore, it makes sense to limit the information to just that which the respective
security teams require.
An interesting example of disparate teams converging is a fusion center. Fusion centers
comprise collaborations between local, state, and federal governments to address a wide range
of issues, including terrorist attacks. Obviously, each group has information that it is con-
cerned with which it doesn’t need to share with others. However, each group also has access
to information that the other group may not have access to, but would prove useful.
Although the Venn diagram in Figure 9.1 illustrates the ease of these relationships conceptu-
ally, the practical and procedural reality of coordination is still in the early stages as disparate
groups ﬁnd ways to work better with one another. Deciding what information to share can
become even more complex when there are international components within some of these
circles.
These groups are not just consumers of information; they are also collectors.This infor-
mation may comprise human intelligence, physical security data, and logical security data.
Thus, just like physical and logical security teams cooperating, fusion centers are becoming
more common in hopes of increasing efﬁciencies and reducing risk. Several cities and states
have begun building fusion centers to work with national agencies. For example, California,
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Jersey, and New York either already
have fusion centers or are investigating them. New York, for example, has its own foreign
intelligence agency focused on information gathering, with ofﬁces in around 26 countries.

Clearly there is some overlap between local, state, and federal agencies, but there is also a
great deal of information that doesn’t need to be shared among these agencies.The same
holds true for physical and logical security teams.Although they may want to share case
management, reporting, alerting, escalation, and investigation frameworks, they don’t need to
share all portions of these elements all the time.
The net of physical and logical security convergence through ESM is that convergence
of these groups is no longer an opaque topic. Security concerns more than ﬁrewalls; it con-
cerns more than badge readers. Understanding this, today’s organizations are demanding a
truly holistic view of their security posture, and ESM can provide it. With a suite of tools for
log collection, analysis, collaboration, and response, ESM has been making convergence a
reality.
Before we get into ESM deployment strategies, let’s outline a few short examples of
where ESM has integrated with physical security solutions for truly unique and effective
converged security strategies.
Common Access Cards 
and In-House Security Monitoring
By using common access cards (CACs), the Department of Defense (DoD) has begun to
implement a system in which physical and logical identiﬁcation and access control are associ-
ated with a single card.These CACs offer the same features as traditional physical access
cards, complete with photo ID and descriptive information about the carrier. However, they
also have the capability to log the holder of the card onto a logical network. For example,
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
261

after scanning his CAC through a CAC reader by the door to enter a building, an individual
could swipe the card in a CAC reader that is connected to his workstation to authenticate
himself on the network. Further, he could use the CAC to encrypt information and access
secured Web sites and other mechanisms used for secured logical access. CACs are slowly
replacing military IDs and will eventually be carried by most DoD employees and contrac-
tors.
In fact, there are discussions to make CAC the standard for authentication for the TSA
Registered Traveler Program and the Guest Worker Program. From a convergence perspec-
tive, CAC is a great leap forward because now a user’s physical and logical identity is associ-
ated with a common key. Instead of a physical access ID being something such as 10010011
and a logical ID being something such as bsmith, both the physical and logical IDs will be
bsmith.This also makes it much easier to provision new employees and revoke access:
Because all access is associated with one CAC, if you provision or revoke the CAC, you can
more quickly and effectively provision or revoke the individual’s access in its entirety. No
longer is there a need to work through multiple groups to manage all forms of access. CAC
makes the job of the ESM that much more efﬁcient because the ESM doesn’t have to map
bsmith to 10010011, and potentially to many other IDs. Now bsmith is a common key that
the ESM can associate with all of that particular user’s identities.
NOTE
In the U.S. government, there is such a strong push for these types of solu-
tions that a policy for a common identiﬁcation standard has been put it place
for federal employees and contractors. It is called the Homeland Security
Presidential Directive (HSPD-12) and it was explored in Chapter 5.
Some organizations have even brought traditionally outsourced security monitoring ser-
vices in-house to better their response time to incidents, thus reducing risk and even saving
money. For example, an in-house physical security organization can monitor ﬁre alarms, bur-
glar alarms, facility access, and video surveillance. By pulling these services in-house, busi-
nesses now have the option to more easily integrate these services with their overall risk
monitoring capabilities within ESM.
Many banks are ﬁnding that getting their physical and logical security teams to work
together can be invaluable, especially during fraud investigations. Because each team has its
own key competencies, each can leverage one another during investigations.The bank’s cor-
porate security department can work the case from a ﬁnancial perspective as well as with law
enforcement agencies, and the logical security department can provide the IT details that are
needed to support the case. ESM as the core of such a system allows for seamless communi-
cation and documentation of the investigation, and provides a complete audit trail of every-
thing that was done.

ESM Deployment Strategies
In this section, we will explore several ESM deployment strategies. We will discuss each
component of the ESM architecture; however, we will cover the details of their operation in
later chapters.
Standard ESM Deployment
You can deploy ESM solutions in standard, high-availability, and geographically dispersed
conﬁgurations.Additionally, you can use other components within the ESM architecture as
stand-alone solutions or in conjunction with a more robust ESM strategy that expands to
network response and network conﬁguration.To begin with, we’ll look at one example of an
ESM deployment, starting with Figure 9.2.
Figure 9.2 Basic ESM Deployment
As mentioned earlier, regardless of the logs being generated—whether they’re from
physical devices, network devices, servers, and so on—ESM systems are designed to receive
and process logs. Between the point devices and the ESM manager are a number of ways to
transport the logs.
On the far left of Figure 9.2 is a log collection appliance.You can use these types of
appliances as stand-alone solutions or as part of a broader ESM solution.As stand-alone solu-
tions, they are designed to collect logs at very high volumes—tens of thousands of logs every
second—and they provide long-term storage.This storage can equate to many years’ worth

of data in some cases because of compression capabilities offered by most log collection
appliances. Figure 9.3 shows a high-level view of a log collection appliance.
Figure 9.3 Log Collection Appliance: System Status View (Source: ArcSight
Logger v1.0)
Figure 9.3 shows an interactive Web session with a log collection appliance. Because
these devices are designed to collect and store massive amounts of information, it is helpful
to have a dashboard to evaluate their status. For example, looking at Figure 9.3 from left to
right, you can see statistics regarding CPU usage, disk usage, and the number of logs/events
per second being received and transported to the ESM manager.This type of dashboard pro-
vides a fast and easy way to understand what is happening within the appliance.
Figure 9.4 shows another view within the log collection appliance focused on analysis.
The analysis grid in Figure 9.4 displays the logs that are ﬂowing into the appliance based
on certain criteria, such as time, protocols, source IPs, destination IPs, and other key vari-
ables.This image shows Telnet access for the admin account where there were failures and
successes. Search criteria such as these may be valuable in an audit when researching histor-
ical data stored within the appliance for the use of nonapproved protocols such as Telnet,
where sensitive information and passwords are transmitted in clear text.

Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

Figure 9.4 Log Collection Appliance: Analysis View (Source: ArcSight
Logger v1.0)
Log collection appliances provide a solid solution for organizations that want an easy-to-
deploy appliance which allows rapid analysis along with high-speed log collection and inex-
pensive long-term storage. If the appliance is used as part of a broader ESM strategy, it can
then forward all or a subset of the data to the ESM manager for more advanced analysis. In
these scenarios, it might be likely to have multiple log collection appliances deployed to key
locations within the organization. For example, they may be divided by geography or busi-
ness unit.
Many organizations also have management silos. If this is the case in your organization,
you may want to keep all logs separated at operational levels, but the global security team
may require a more holistic view. Figure 9.5 illustrates such a case and shows how an organi-
zation might deploy log collection appliances to consider business and geographical bound-
aries and still maintain global oversight.
As you saw in Figure 9.2, the next log collection capability utilizes an organization’s
existing log management strategy.This is most commonly syslog for UNIX systems;
Microsoft and third-party vendors also offer somewhat similar solutions for Microsoft’s logs.
Syslog servers can collect syslog messages from a number of devices. Residing on the server
would be software commonly called connectors.These connectors come in many forms:
syslog, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), proprietary formats such as
CheckPoint’s Open Platform for Secure Enterprise Connectivity (OPSEC) and Cisco’s
Remote Data Exchange Protocol (RDEP), and many others.The connectors may even reach
out and log into Microsoft systems that don’t have a central log aggregation point, for
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9

example, to retrieve logs for certain deployment strategies. In general, if an organization
already has central locations where logs are being collected, it is easy to install a connector
on each aggregation point.The connectors will in turn do some preprocessing on the logs
and send them to the ESM manager.
Figure 9.5 Distributed Log Collection Appliance Architecture
Although it is somewhat unusual these days for a large organization to not have any type
of log aggregation strategy that ESM can leverage, it does occur, at least in some small subsets
of the network. In these cases, it is possible to simply send logs directly from the point
devices to the ESM manager.This type of design doesn’t allow for preprocessing capabilities
such as encryption, compression, ﬁltering, aggregation, and other features that we will cover
later, but it will at least move the logs into the ESM so that they can be analyzed.
A more common strategy for an organization that doesn’t have a log aggregation
strategy is to use existing servers to deploy a number of connectors on them.This is some-
what similar to the log collection appliance, but only from the perspective of being able to
receive, preprocess, and relay logs to the ESM manager.These systems can generally handle
multiple versions of log connectors (syslog, Microsoft, SNMP, etc.) installed, but they don’t
allow for the high-volume capture, long-term storage, or rapid analysis at the same level as a
log collection appliance.
The ﬁnal strategy for moving logs from point devices to the ESM manager is to deploy
log connectors at any natural aggregation points, such as device managers.These are com-
monly ﬁrewall managers, intrusion detection system managers, access control databases, and
so on. Many organizations will utilize several strategies with the intention of being able to

collect all the mission-critical logs while at the same time reducing the number of point
devices that have to be altered.
By using connectors at aggregation points such as a syslog server or a device manager,
using collection appliances, or a server built with multiple connectors installed, an organiza-
tion can easily deploy a log management strategy that feeds the ESM solution with only a
handful of collection points, even though logs from thousands of systems are being analyzed.
This low-touch approach is one reason why many organizations ﬁnd that a holistic ESM
strategy is really quite practical, because it doesn’t require manipulation of the point systems
generating the logs. Nobody would use ESM in a large environment if he had to make
changes to every system being monitored; these solutions make that possible.
The next stages of the diagram have to do with the ESM manager and database.As with
log collection (covered in Chapter 10), the ESM manager and the ESM database both have
dedicated chapters to follow (Chapters 11 and 12, respectively). Essentially, the ESM manager
is the brains of the architecture. It is a central location for everything, from correlation and
analysis through case management and alerting. It also leverages the ESM database, which is
typically an enterprise-level database such as Oracle for forensics analysis.That is, all the logs
entering the ESM system are processed in memory, in real time, but if historical analysis and
reporting on older logs are desired, instead of receiving logs from the various collection
points the ESM system will retrieve the logs from the database. Real-time and forensics anal-
ysis within the ESM manager is generally seamless, with the same tools available to each. But
there are a few exceptions where additional capabilities are most relevant for forensics anal-
ysis; we will cover them extensively in Chapter 12.
ESM systems generally allow several forms of interaction, including a console and a Web
interface.The console is software that is loaded onto a laptop or workstation. Consoles are
usually more feature-rich and allow for administrative tasks such as creating original content
such as rules, reports, and dashboards, and deﬁning user access privileges. Consoles connect
directly to the ESM manager.They are generally used by IT security analysts because they
offer rich analysis capabilities (which we will cover in Chapters 11 and 12).The Web inter-
face is a slimmed-down version of the console that simply requires a Web browser to con-
nect to the ESM manager, or in some cases, a stand-alone Web server that in turn
communicates with the ESM manager. Regardless of the console or the Web interface, these
solutions will usually provide 128-bit encryption with 1,024-bit key exchange by leveraging
HTTPS.This same level of encryption is also used between the log collection appliance and
connectors to the ESM manager.
Regardless of the Web interface or console interface, both solutions can provide granular
access controls for users. In most cases, these access controls can be tied to standard user-
names and passwords, LDAP, public key infrastructure (PKI), Remote Authentication Dial-In
User Service (RADIUS), two-factor authentication, and similar access control systems. In
most situations, an organization will have several groups that want access to ESM compo-
nents, and each group will have one or many users. In this format, it is easy to add and
remove privileges across various disciplines. Consider the following privileges based on
groups:
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
267

■
Members of the network operations team can use either the console or the Web
interface to access logs that are speciﬁc to routers, switches, and other network
gear.They may want to use the ESM system’s case management system, reporting,
and visualization features. However, they don’t need access to other features, nor
do they need access to logs that are not directly related to their group.They may
also be the primary operators of the network response managers and network con-
ﬁguration managers that we will cover a bit later in this chapter.
■
Members of the IT security team may want to look at everything across all
groups, and may require the most advanced ESM analysis capabilities to be at their
disposal. However, some members within this group may be more concerned with
compliance issues.As such, they are privy only to logs related to those assets associ-
ated with regulatory compliance, as deﬁned in the ESM system’s asset database.
■
Physical security teams and management alike may only require access through the
Web interface.They may want to see graphical dashboards and the case management
system.They may also want report access and maybe even daily reports for their
respective areas. For example, the physical security team may want to see a report
that documents entry into a particularly sensitive area of the facility. Managers may
want to see high-level reports regarding how efﬁciently cases are being addressed and
what the overall risk posture is in comparison to previous weeks and quarters.
As ESM capabilities have been maturing over the years, there has been growth in their
core capabilities. We’ve already addressed the log collection appliance that allows for a stand-
alone or integrated technology to collect, store, and rapidly analyze massive data ﬂows. Other
areas are related to network response and network conﬁguration.As organizations have
grown, they’ve found the need to not only detect, but also, as Figure 9.2 shows, respond in
the case of the network response manager (NRM) and prevent through a pragmatic
approach to network device conﬁguration with the network conﬁguration manager (NCM).
These systems integrate well with traditional ESM capabilities similarly to physical security
solutions. Chapter 11 covers the related network response capabilities for ESM in more tech-
nical detail. However, by use of comparison to physical and logical security convergence,
later in this chapter we will explore network operation center and security operation center
convergence through enhanced collaboration and communication.This will help to illustrate
the extensibility of ESM beyond the use cases that we will cover later in the book. But
before we get to that, there are a few additional architectural examples concerning ESM that
we need to cover.
High-Availability and 
Geographically Dispersed ESM Deployments
Security has steadily become part of an organization’s critical path.There was a time when
operations could still be up with no security, but those days are gone.To address this, security
www.syngress.com
268
Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

vendors have developed high-availability architectures for their solutions; ESM vendors are
no different. Figure 9.6 illustrates a high-availability design for the ESM manager and the
ESM database.
Figure 9.6 High-Availability ESM Architecture
Most ESM systems can use a number of high-availability options, such as Legato, Veritas,
and Oracle RAC.This is usually done within a single data center as opposed to two geo-
graphically dispersed locations.Although different geographies have been used, and they pro-
vide an additional safeguard such as surviving a natural disaster that destroys one data center
while the other remains intact, in practice this is rarely done unless the organization already
has the network capacity in place to replicate systems in this fashion for other assets outside
of security. Bandwidth for this type of operation is generally too cost-prohibitive. When the
risk of an entire data center being destroyed is weighed against the expense of multigeog-
raphy high availability, the overall business risk calculation more commonly leads to a single
data center deployment.
In Figure 9.6, the primary ESM manager receives logs for real-time processing.That
manager sends logs to the primary ESM database for storage and forensics analysis. Should
the primary manager suffer an outage or be taken ofﬂine for maintenance, the secondary
ESM manager will start collecting the logs and can still use the primary ESM database. Once
the primary ESM manager comes back online, logs will be sent to it instead of to the sec-
ondary ESM manager.
Should the same scenario be applied to the primary database, the process would be the
same.The communication between the primary and secondary ESM databases will resync
once the primary database comes back online.

This architecture can also survive an outage of any one ESM manager and any one ESM
database at once.That is, if the primary ESM manager is up but the primary ESM database
goes down, the ESM architecture will run between the primary ESM manager and the sec-
ondary ESM database.Also, if the secondary ESM manager is running and communicating
with the primary ESM database, it can switch over to the secondary ESM database if there is
yet another outage.
The managers and the databases are always in sync during operation, up until the point
when one of the devices goes down. Once connectivity is reestablished, they will begin the
process of resynchronization.This design allows for a very stable ESM architecture.
In addition to high-availability designs, there is often a need for a hierarchy. If you want
to make something scalable, you build a hierarchy, much like with the domain name system
(DNS). With this type of architecture, the ESM manager and database pairs can be inﬁnitely
wide and deep. However, in practice, the hierarchy tree is rarely more than a few layers deep,
although it can be relatively wide based on the organization’s desire to segment operations.
Figure 9.7 explores a hierarchical ESM architecture.
Figure 9.7 Hierarchical ESM Architecture
Figure 9.7 shows how an organization can have various divisions, and each division can
house its own ESM deployment.These divisions are responsible only for what happens
within their environment.At the regional level, there is a similar deployment to that in the
division. However, a key difference is that the regional ESM manager does not receive logs
from connectors or a log collection appliance, but rather from the divisional manager. From
the perspective of the regional ESM manager, the divisional managers simply represent
another feed. Based on organizational policies, all or a subset of the divisional data will be

sent to the regional managers for analysis. If a subset is desired, the regional teams may only
send logs that are considered to be of a high level of severity or are impacting mission-crit-
ical assets, for example. Finally, the same process can be applied to the ESM manager at the
organization’s headquarters.Additionally, the analysts at headquarters can access any of the
regional and divisional ESM managers directly, as long as they have access privileges to do so.
This may allow them to conduct more detailed investigations if all data hasn’t been for-
warded to their ESM manager.
These are essentially the major components of an ESM architecture. However, as stated
earlier in the chapter, certain relationships in regard to network response and network con-
ﬁguration ﬁt within this architecture too.The extensibility of ESM to interoperate with
these features is indicative of an extensible design and, as such, is analogous to physical and
logical security convergence.These synergies will now be explored further.
The Convergence of Network Operations
and Security Operations
Today’s IT mission has changed. Much like physical and logical security convergence, net-
work operation centers (NOCs) and security operation centers (SOCs) are more focused on
business impact than hardware and software impact. Risk is risk, regardless of whether the
incident that causes the network to crash is a router failure due to a power outage, a mali-
cious hacker, or somebody who physically broke in and ran off with the router. Ultimately,
that network impact will have some level of impact on the business, and that is what needs
to be managed.This is why it is important for NOCs and SOCs to collaborate more effec-
tively. In doing so, they can better enable and enhance business process in terms of preventive
measures such as network device conﬁguration and incident management in terms of anal-
ysis, workﬂow, and response. In addition to incident prevention, detection, and management,
NOCs and SOCs working together can also address compliance requirements more easily.
Although it is important for these teams to work together and leverage each other’s core
competencies, by no means do we suggest that they simply merge into one team.They may at
some point report to the CIO or to someone in a similar leadership position, but they each
have clear responsibilities and expertise that are best serviced by them operating autonomously.
This is the same notion that applies to physical and logical security convergence.
Separation of duties and checks and balances are important concepts to maintain when
any groups converge.As with fusion centers, a balance has to be determined to ascertain
which groups need access to which assets, who can make operational changes, what the esca-
lation and approval path is, and how audits are conducted. Convergence is a powerful con-
cept, but without processes in place and individuals to manage those processes, it can create
an inverse situation and actually slow down operations and reduce security.Although tech-
nology is needed to assist efforts, it is of little value without also paying attention to people
and process.

271

One of the issues for network and security analysts today is that there is simply too
much information to process and too few analysts to go around.This problem is getting
worse, not better, as many organizations continue to invest in equipment instead of head-
count. When an organization discovers an issue, its resolution often requires working across
NOC/SOC boundaries to perform root cause analysis.Typically, the organization crosses
these boundaries by leveraging personal relationships, rather than utilizing clearly deﬁned
response strategies or shared incident management workﬂow solutions such as ESM case
management and cooperative investigation features.The NOC is concerned with keeping
things moving efﬁciently and the SOC is concerned with security, rendered through analysis
within the ESM.
This is analogous to the NOC being a ﬂight crew trying to get passengers from point A
to point B while Transportation Security Administration (TSA) ofﬁcials are focused on overall
security. Both roles are absolutely critical, but to be effective, they must work together in an
ideal world and to some extent work toward similar goals.Thus, the TSA ofﬁcials should be
cognizant of schedules and the need to be expedient while the ﬂight crews are also consid-
ering safety and security. If either group notices an issue in the early stages, the idea is that
they can make adjustments to communicate with the other to achieve better synergies.
NOC/SOC cooperation is particularly relevant in the early stages because without it,
analysts from either discipline may be working beyond their expertise. Because most issues
are indistinct in the early stages—for example, is it a hack or is it a hardware failure?—it can
be difﬁcult to pinpoint a problem quickly without collaboration. People will generally retreat
to their comfort zones.A security person will likely assume that an incident is security-
related and a network person will assume that it’s network-related.Thus, operating in silos
leads to inefﬁcient incident management, greater risk, higher cost (partly because more time
has to be spent on analysis, which results in a slower response, duplication of efforts, an
incorrect response, territorial conﬂicts, etc.), and less likelihood of the IT department ever
maturing its focus away from bits and bytes and getting to real business issues.
Of course, ESM, the NRM, the NCM, and technology in general are only part of the
solution.Technology isn’t a panacea.A complete solution also needs to consider people and
process.
People and Process
Consider stafﬁng for the NOC and SOC. Ideally, it would comprise a tiered incident escala-
tion model with general ﬁrst-level support, NOC and SOC analysts, followed by experts in
the respective groups.Tiered stafﬁng equates to tiered analysis and tiered response, which
makes for a much better design, especially in crisis situations where people can become
unsure of where their responsibility begins and ends. Job rotation and hiring individuals that
have exposure to NOC and SOC are also valuable. For physical and logical convergence, this
type of cross-training and hiring of individuals with backgrounds in both areas can be a
challenge, and in many cases, it simply won’t be feasible.Thus, better communication and
www.syngress.com
272
Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

cooperation are even more essential. Figure 9.8 outlines the tiered collaboration model
addressed here.
Figure 9.8 Tiered NOC/SOC Collaboration Model
Figure 9.8 shows a level-one technical support group that likely consists of less-senior
staff from either the NOC or the SOC.This level of support focuses on triaging incidences
and assigning them to the group that is most appropriate. Because the level-one support, as
well as the NOC and SOC teams, can share a common case management system—either
built directly into the ESM solution or integrated with a third-party ticketing system such as
Remedy—it is technically a simple task to assign an incident, attach supporting data, anno-
tate an incident, and so forth. Once the NOC or SOC receives an alert, it can decide to
analyze it and or to reassign it to another team. For difﬁcult situations, experts within one or
both groups may need to get involved.And if the SOC does ﬁnd an issue where remediation
is needed, it is extremely common for the NOC to make any actual changes to network
devices because they are generally more tightly aligned with operations while the SOC does
the investigation and makes the request (we will explore this topic in more detail later in the
chapter). For physical and logical security, this makes even more sense because it would be
rare for these teams to attempt to remediate an incident that falls within the other’s disci-
pline. In order to create a framework where these groups can effectively communicate and
interact, processes must be in place to help guide their action. Without a deﬁned process, the
convergence results will be inversed regardless of how good the people and technology are.
Process has historically been a very unclear term. Everybody talks about how important it
is, but in practice, it is often very loosely deﬁned or not deﬁned at all. Sometimes there are
verbal agreements, sometimes there is a central person that critical decisions are routed
through (thus, the process is simply internal to this person), and other times process exists in

a dusty red binder atop the break-room microwave and is so out-of-date that if it was fol-
lowed, it would result in catastrophe.There are many published frameworks to help lend
guidance to the process issue, but perhaps one of the most practical is the Information
Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework. It is focused on utilizing best practices
to enhance IT solutions and better promote business initiatives.Again, IT is becoming more
about business and managing risk, so a framework that embraces the use of IT as a vehicle to
promote business initiatives falls directly in line with this trend. ITIL is commonly leveraged
by organizations looking to enhance business initiatives through NOC/SOC collaboration.
It should be noted, however, that ITIL is just one of multiple frameworks that can also be
used to this end. Some others are:
■
Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT)
■
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17799:2005
■
Information Services Procurement Library (ISPL)
■
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
■
Capability Maturity Model (CMM/CMMI)
Although we will not explain ITIL fully in this section, we will discuss areas that have a
direct impact on NOC/SOC collaboration and help to address some of the difﬁculties
encountered when groups are removed from silos.
Consider service support, which is a speciﬁc ITIL area that can be ampliﬁed by
achieving better integration across operations, thus reducing duplicate efforts and enhancing
mean time to incident resolution. Basically, the NOC and/or the SOC can interdict more
quickly by leveraging each other’s core competencies rather than trying to decide which
department owns the issue or dealing with ﬁnger pointing or political rivalries.This cross-
operational integration also addresses better quality in service delivery and improved overall
security, especially if it occurs as early as the planning stage (i.e., network conﬁguration [ﬁre
prevention, not ﬁre ﬁghting]).
Take, for example, the deployment of new network gear. It is widely agreed that inte-
grating security into the planning and architecture phase at the onset yields better returns
than trying to add security after the fact. Using the analogy of erecting a skyscraper, most
people would concur that it’s far better to design security into a facility at the beginning to
ensure that everything is safe architecturally, even before construction starts, rather than to
open the doors for business only to discover the weak points later.Although it seems like an
obvious point, ITIL expressly outlines best practices for communication management. Not
only should the NOC and SOC communicate as much as needed, but that communication
quality can be improved upon with tools that facilitate information sharing, alerting, escala-
tion, and ownership—for example, a robust case management ticketing system.
ITIL has a deﬁned framework for security and asset management promoting the utility
of NOC to SOC visibility and vice versa. From a very practical perspective on the physical
and logical sides, many of these teams rarely communicate and many don’t even know each
www.syngress.com

other in large organizations. Something as simple as having lunch once a month can have a
positive impact on cross-departmental cooperation.
ITIL also outlines the importance of asset management; you have to know what you are
trying to protect if you are going to adequately protect it. Essentially knowing your assets
leads to a better understanding of an organization’s risk proﬁle. It also helps in making
informed decisions about acceptance, management, or remediation of the risk. Back to the
skyscraper analogy: If the building is broken into there is cause for alarm, but if burglars have
gained access to a broom closet, the perceived risk is lower than if they have gained access to
a bank’s vault. By understanding the critical locations of the facility and the types of assets
that are housed there (brooms versus gold bars, for example), a more appropriate response
can be engaged.Although this is a fairly straightforward example, it can be more difﬁcult in
the network-centric world where servers, networks, and information must be classiﬁed and
kept up-to-date within the ESM system’s asset database. Fortunately, many ESM systems
allow for asset management to assist in determining risk in relation to real business context,
such as a server housing classiﬁed development plans or information related to a potential
acquisition of a competitor.
It’s amazing how many times organizational processes break down simply because one
group thinks the other owns it. By following ITIL best practices for centralized operation
ownership, without necessarily merging the NOC and SOC, functional decision making can
still be driven from a seemingly autonomous group, even though in actuality they’ve simply
improved communication.This can even affect the bottom line.
Automation is another good example of reducing those operational costs. Many organi-
zations simply say that the SOC, or security in general, slows down NOC efforts with seem-
ingly unrelenting requests for information, such as device conﬁgurations.
For example, the SOC may want to see router, wireless access point, and switch conﬁgu-
rations. Each time the NOC grants these requests, the SOC needs to stop what it’s doing,
generate the output, and ﬁlter out sensitive information. Ideally, the SOC could simply log
into a device that provides real-time, automatically updated copies of the conﬁgurations that
are access-controlled, which don’t require sharing of device passwords and which can auto-
matically ﬁlter out sensitive conﬁguration information. Now the SOC gets what it needs,
and the NOC doesn’t need to do any extra work. With an ITIL framework guiding simple
communication and collaboration techniques empowered by ESM, this is an achievable
reality. Because this particular scenario seems to be a major point of pain for NOCs, we will
cover it separately later in this chapter.
At this point, we have considered people and process, which brings us to the ﬁnal piece
of the equation: technology.

Figure 9.9 NOC/SOC Ecosystem
As with the ESM basic deployment diagram in Figure 9.2, this diagram starts with feeds
from point devices. It also has asset information as well as policy and conﬁguration informa-
tion feeding into the various components.The log collection appliance, ESM system, NRM,
and NCM all receive information from the organization, as illustrated by the arrows.
The log collection appliance as a stand-alone device can render information to analysts,
or it can be another data feed for the ESM system.At the core of the architecture, the ESM
system will provide the key features related to analysis and management, and it interacts
directly with the network response manager to actually perform remediation in the form of
device conﬁguration changes, terminating secessions, and disabling user accounts. Because
the NRM can communicate back into the network for both discovery and response, and do
so either automatically or through analyst interaction, the arrows are bidirectional.The same
bidirectional process applies for the NCM, as it has the capability to act as a central manage-
ment point for various layer-2 and layer-3 devices and thus allow a policy-driven and collab-
orative approach to proactively embed security within the network architecture. Each
component by itself provides tremendous value, but through integration of all these compo-
nents true operational efﬁciencies are gained, cost is reduced, and risk is more effectively
managed under the guise of NOC/SOC collaboration.
Because we’ve already covered the essential components of the log collection appliance,
and the following chapters will detail the ESM portion, we will now focus on the NRM
and NCM.
The network response manager is of great use for the NOC and SOC. In most cases,
the NOC and SOC will share a single NRM appliance because as with ESM, NRM solu-

tions allow for tight access controls and can limit access to information and asset manipula-
tion.Additionally, from a physical security perspective, if rapid remediation is desired, it can
also play an effective role. For example, a physical access control system that is associated
with a central authentication server such as LDAP could be controlled. If a user’s access
needs to be quickly revoked, this can be done through the NRM to terminate physical
access as well as logical access points. Some organizations may already have an NRM-like
solution in place, but they are often focused on a single technology and lack other capabili-
ties afforded by a broader enterprise-level NRM solution. Some of the key features that ven-
dors of network response solutions bring to NOC/SOC collaboration include the following:
■
Vendor-agnostic interoperability
■
Layer-2 and layer-3 network discovery
■
Secure communication
■
Network visualization 
■
Change virtualization
■
Integration with change management procedures
■
Change rollback
■
Policy enforcement
■
Automatic documentation
Most robust NRM solutions will actually securely log into the various layer-2 and layer-
3 devices to determine their conﬁguration.This yields better results than SNMP queries that
are most often preformed in clear text, provide less data than is needed, and are thus less
desirable.These NRM systems attempt to use secure protocols such as Secure Shell (SSH) or
HTTPS whenever possible. Once the NRM system has built a database of the various con-
ﬁgurations, it can create a visual of how the organization’s network is connected at layers
two and three.This is similar to a network diagram done in Visio but it is automatically cre-
ated and continually updated.
Perhaps one of the most valuable capabilities that an NRM solution can offer is the
capability to make virtual changes before actually moving those changes to production
devices.
For example, the SOC may be investigating an incident with the ESM. When it feels it
has enough data to make a decision regarding response, the case moves to the NRM.There
the SOC can test changes, and make modiﬁcations to its criteria based on the NRM’s virtu-
alized change feedback regarding the changes not being in par with regulatory compliance
guidelines, operational procedures, or simply negatively impacting other aspects of the net-
work. Following the virtualized changes, the SOC will likely not have permission to make
the actual operational changes.
Thus, an alert will escalate the case to the NOC.The NOC can review the SOC’s
work, review the virtualization, and coordinate with the SOC to actually make the change
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
277

in accordance with change management policies.An added beneﬁt to performing a response
in this format is that if, after these deliberations, an error was still made the change can
quickly be rolled back.This is generally done with a simple mouse click that allows the
NRM system to roll back the asset conﬁguration to the previous conﬁguration. It is fast and
simple and reduces the possibility of additional errors being made.Additionally, all the
changes will be automatically documented so that neither the NOC nor SOC has to take
time out to document the incident.This also makes the process of audits after the fact much
easier if someone requests information on how the incident was addressed.This example
helps to amplify the value that NOC/SOC collaboration can bring to real-world issues.
Network conﬁguration management vendors have introduced automation that moves
the NOC/SOC tasks into more of a proactive posture. Because most NCMs allow devices
to be conﬁgured to a gold standard following organizational policies, best practices, and reg-
ulatory guidelines, regardless of vendor and version, conﬁgurations can remain consistent. For
provisioning and revocation, this spells out the ability to do more with fewer resources being
chained to conﬁguration changes.The bottom line is that anytime you can do more with
less, it’s a money saver.
Some key features that robust NCMs offer are as follows:
■
Proactive attention to network and security polices, regulations, and best practices
■
Secure, automatic conﬁguration discovery, much like the NRM
■
Gold-standard conﬁguration templates that are vetted by the NOC, SOC, and
other stakeholders
■
Integration with change management policies
■
Completely vendor-agnostic
■
Reduced complexity and human error and increased efﬁciencies in the network
conﬁguration process
■
The ability (as with the NRM) to virtualize, automatically document, and roll
back changes
Network engineers can switch their focus to more advanced tasks such as network design,
planning, and technology evaluations (basically, ﬁre prevention; not ﬁre ﬁghting).This can also
make the sharing of conﬁguration information between SOCs and NOCs better because of
access-controlled views, ﬁltered conﬁgurations, and automated and up-to-date information.
And the NOC/SOC can work together to assist in the deployment strategy so that network
operations and security both have a say in the organization’s network architecture.
The change management process can be mirrored within the network conﬁguration
manager, including escalation and alerting.This centralized system also reduces failures asso-
ciated with human error. Policies can also be implemented at the time of a change, and
changes can be automatically veriﬁed to ensure that they don’t break the policies.

Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

One of the biggest practical beneﬁts is the automatic documentation of changes.This is
a huge issue for many organizations, because big and small changes, especially those con-
cerning compliance-relevant devices, have to be documented. Consider the PCI standard,
which states that organizations need to validate IT conﬁguration changes. With an NCM
solution such as this, that process is automatic.The approach of many NCMs is to have all
changes automatically documented and auditable, making adherence to this section of the
standard transparent.This on-by-default transparency means that the NOC/SOC can better
address the standard without having to take any additional steps.Another beneﬁt of a central
NCM is that it can usually house master conﬁgurations and past conﬁgurations, making it a
valuable resource for conﬁguration comparisons, change rollbacks, audits, and even training.
Consider an audit of recent changes that were made to a network device. For some
reason, the network device is bombarding the ESM with SNMP alerts that seem to indicate
a failing interface. From a physical/logical perspective, this could just as easily be a physical
access device that appears to be connected and then suddenly goes from online to ofﬂine
and back again. Further, let’s assume that a network engineer decided to make some adjust-
ments directly to the network device without following policy and by not using the NCM.
When the NOC and SOC investigate the issue jointly—because both groups are concerned
about the issue and its cause—they can simply bring up the last known conﬁguration for the
device and look for any changes.They can also bring up two conﬁgurations side by side to
analyze the existing conﬁguration against any adjustments that were made.This will produce
an image such as the one in Figure 9.10.
Figure 9.10 Network Device Conﬁguration Comparison (Source: ArcSight
NCM 1.0)
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
279

The view in Figure 9.10 is bifurcated.The view on the left shows the last version of the
conﬁguration, and the view on the right shows the conﬁguration changes that the NOC has
made. Note the version tags on the top, along with the dates and times.Also, on the right,
the conﬁgurations that have been added by the NOC after the incident was discovered are
shaded and read “no SNMP trap link-status” for each interface. It’s worth mentioning that
with most NCM solutions, if the NOC has sensitive information within the conﬁgurations,
such as encrypted password strings and various conﬁguration parameters that it doesn’t share
outside the network team, the SOC’s view can be ﬁltered and limited based on its access
control privileges. In this way, the SOC can use a Web interface to directly access the NCM
in a read-only mode without having to go to the network operations team for assistance.
This is a big timesaver because the NOC doesn’t have to stop what it is doing, compile data
from various sources, and ﬁlter out information every time the SOC makes a request.
Back to the conﬁgurations and the changes that were added by the NOC to address the
problem the “no snmp” string which tells the network device to not send SNMP traps for
these types of interfaces. In this example, the interfaces are for dialers.They go up when a
dial-in connection is made, and they go down when that connection disconnects.This is
perfectly normal and expected behavior, but by associating an SNMP trap for each time this
instance occurs, it can look like there is a potential issue, especially when the SOC is looking
at the information through ESM and may not fully understand what is causing it.
Had the network engineer used the NCM, he would have followed a template that
would have disallowed him from allowing SNMP traps on dialer interfaces in accordance
with organizational policy and best practices.At this point, it is a simple process to use a
wizard-driven interface found within most robust NCMs and disable the SNMP service on
the three dialer interfaces.Additionally, the modiﬁcations will be documented and the new
conﬁguration will be backed up to the NCM.
Now consider a situation where the lines that delineate the NOC and SOC are not
clear, and the SOC can make changes to production network devices without checks and
balances. Perhaps an analyst in the SOC is working with the ESM system and notices an
interesting visual that intuitively appears to be malicious activity. For example, a single source
could be trying to connect to various destinations in an extremely short amount of time.
The security analyst does what he has been trained to do, as listed here and illustrated in
Figure 9.11:
■
Filters out legitimate network trafﬁc from his view that might cause false positives
such as network monitoring tools
■
Filters out unrelated data from the view
■
Identiﬁes the source and the targets (temporary staff network, mission-critical
routers)
■
Identiﬁes the log types (router access logs)
■
Considers time and evaluates the logs holistically

Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

Based on his analysis, the picture illustrates a security incident of note, commonly associ-
ated with brute force login attacks. Further, it looks like it was not only being perpetrated by
a malicious insider, but also is impacting sensitive network devices; thus, action had to be
taken quickly. Figure 9.11 is a mock-up of such a visual.
Figure 9.11 ESM Attack Visualization
Figure 9.11 represents what an attack may look like from the inside.And given that the
source is a temporary staff network, the targets are considered mission-critical assets on a
global scale, and the router access logs are successful (not router access deny logs), the SOC
analyst decides to generate a high-priority case with the ESM case management system and
escalate it to the SOC supervisor.
Although the escalation process does provide some oversight, it does not do so across the
departments to include the NOC. With a similar understanding of the situation as the SOC
analyst, the supervisor decides to respond using the NRM. Because the attacker appears to
be an insider, the policy dictates that he quarantine the attacker by moving the attacker’s
system to a segregated VLAN.
Figure 9.12 shows what this process may look like within the NRM when the response
was applied.

ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
281

Figure 9.12 NRM Incident Response of Type Quarantine (Source: ArcSight
NRM v2.0)
Unfortunately for the SOC, it wasn’t an attack at all, but rather legitimate trafﬁc. Let’s
assume that the individual that was considered the attacker was a consultant that was hired to
update the routers. He was using automated scripts—Expect scripts, for example—to log
into every mission-critical router across the enterprise and make updates in accordance with
the organization’s change management and patch management programs.Although the
NOC was aware of his tasks, the SOC was not. Because the NOC and SOC didn’t commu-
nicate, the fact that the contractor was successfully quarantined caused lost productivity, and
potentially put the network at risk because some systems were not able to be completely
upgraded.As such, they may have had to manually update the systems, requiring further
resources to determine which routers still needed work.
It is clear that a tool such as this has a tremendous amount of power, and to prevent it
from being used against the organization, it should be carefully secured and user access
should be limited and tightly controlled. Checks and balances should be built into the pro-
cess to ensure that the necessary stakeholders are reviewing a response before it is made.
Most enterprise-level networking and security appliances generally are stripped down and
hardened appliances that have very few extra capabilities, thus reducing their chances of
being exploited.They are usually packed with safeguards such as ﬁrewalls, extensive auditing,
and encrypted communication, and access controls further limit a user’s capabilities once he
is logged in.These types of solutions need to be treated as sensitive business assets.

Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

In this case, a phone call, an e-mail, or just a trip over to somebody in the NOC could
have stopped this issue from escalating and the SOC wouldn’t have had to burn so many
cycles investigating the false alarm. Ideally, a more deﬁned process could have been followed,
as illustrated in Figure 9.13, which outlines a more effective and safer mechanism for net-
work response.
Figure 9.13 NRM Incident Response with Authorization (Source: ArcSight
NRM v2.0)
Following the steps in Figure 9.13, the SOC could have performed the investigation and
escalated the incident via the ESM system’s case management system to the NRM for reme-
diation.The SOC could have further tested the changes through change virtualization, con-
ﬁrmed what the operational impact would be, and escalated the case to the NOC. Upon
reviewing the output of the virtualization, the ESM information, and other supporting data
that the SOC may have added, the NOC could have made an educated decision regarding
the best course of action. In this case, the appropriate response would have been to allow the
contractor to complete the router upgrades.The steps in Figure 9.13 show the following:
1.
In step 1, the SOC has escalated the incident to the NOC to authorize and con-
duct the change.The SOC cannot make changes; only the NOC can.Thus, at this
point the NOC has full operational control over the appropriate response.
2.
In step 2, the NOC can review the rule (the action that the NRM will take). In
this example, the rule will quarantine the attacker.This step is critical because it
allows the wall separating the NOC/SOC to be crossed. Furthermore, because of
the enhanced cooperation, better decisions can be made with oversight, and can be
made more quickly.

ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
283

3.
Step 3 shows the status of the quarantine as pending authorization, meaning that
should the NOC decide to follow the SOC’s recommendation, it needs to simply
accept the proposed response, which will prompt the NRM to automatically
establish the quarantine. In this case, it would have opted to not quarantine, and
the false positive would have been avoided.
By working together and following a process such as the one outlined here, operational
efﬁciencies could have been gained, false positives could have been reduced, and cost savings
would have been realized by not spending additional cycles on the nonincident.
It is easy to see how this could map directly to physical security. Consider a similar situ-
ation where someone was incorrectly denied access to a building. Or what if a response was
mounted based off video analytics to address servers that were thought to be in the process
of being stolen, only to ﬁnd out that they were legitimately being moved to a new location.
Coordination is essential across all areas in today’s complex environments if risk is to be
appropriately addressed.
Let’s consider a ﬁnal example of NOC/SOC collaboration and how it relates to compli-
ance requirements. One of the commonalities between NOCs and SOCs is that they both
have to address compliance in their own way.This can be far easier if they work together to
render output for auditors and to ensure the guidelines are being followed holistically across
their organization. Consider SOX. Many auditors will focus on any assets that process or
transmit ﬁnancial data.They may want to know things such as the following:
■
How are these assets accessed?
■
How are the assets secured?
■
What are the vulnerabilities on the systems?
■
How were incidences on these devices addressed?
■
Have failed logins occurred on these systems?
■
Which systems are targeted the most?
You can address these points in a number of ways by using all of the components dis-
cussed in this chapter: log collection appliances, ESM, the NRM, and the NCM. From con-
ﬁguration ﬁles for network devices and audit trails regarding incident management to basic
log ﬁles and advanced correlated information, visuals, and reports, the solutions covered thus
far can greatly enhance both the NOC’s and the SOC’s capabilities to deliver on compliance
requirements. We’ll go through a few of these examples now.
Figure 9.4 was a good example of how, with some very rapid queries on the log collec-
tion appliance, basic information such as how certain assets are being accessed can become
clear. In this case, they were being accessed with Telnet, which may not be optimal from a
security perspective for systems processing or transporting ﬁnancial data because it isn’t
encrypted.

Chapter 9 • ESM Architecture

What if an auditor wants proof that best practices for device conﬁgurations are being
followed? With NCM products, because disparate devices can be conﬁgured using a single
interface and syntax, typically complete with graphical user interface (GUI) conﬁguration
wizards, it is easy to display how devices are conﬁgured. Simply use one conﬁguration tem-
plate regardless of the point solutions that will be conﬁgured, such as Juniper, Cisco, or
Extreme, and regardless of the syntax for those solutions.
By using this model, you can more easily follow policies, best practices, and regulatory
requirements through a completely vendor-agnostic abstract. When an auditor reviews these
conﬁguration templates knowing that they apply across the entire network infrastructure, the
auditing process becomes as simple as the process of making the conﬁgurations in the ﬁrst
place.And if something needs to be modiﬁed, it can be modiﬁed easily, quickly, and holisti-
cally through the template.
Besides looking at conﬁgurations, another common request is for auditors to ask for
details about known vulnerabilities on regulated systems—both servers and network devices.
When the NOC and SOC are working together, this information can be centralized within
the ESM, ﬁltered, and parsed accordingly, and reports can be generated reﬂecting the
auditor’s requests. Figure 9.14 illustrates such a report mockup as it might be generated by
the ESM. Without NOC/SOC cooperation, such a report would be difﬁcult to produce.
Figure 9.14 NOC and SOC Vulnerability Report
www.syngress.com
ESM Architecture • Chapter 9
285

The ESM’s asset database keeps track of the information found in this report. In Figure
9.14, the ﬁrst column shows the target zone, which is the department and country to which
a device belongs. Because this is a SOX report, it makes sense that these belong to the
ﬁnance department.The next column lists the operating system and application that the asset
is running.The third column concerns business criticality.This is determined by how impor-
tant it is that the asset be secure and functioning.The next column is the actual vulnerability.
This information is generally populated by having log connectors associated with vulnera-
bility scanners such as Nessus, eEye, and Qualys.The ﬁnal column lists the actual IP address
of the vulnerable asset.
Now let’s circle back around to the original reason we included this NOC/SOC sec-
tion. ESM and its related products, such as log collection appliances, the NRM, and the
NCM, form a compelling suite of tools usable in several applications. NOC/SOC conver-
gence, much like physical and logical security convergence, is just one of the capabilities. Just
like NOCs and SOCs have been traditionally disparate groups—however, perhaps not as dis-
parate as physical and logical security—there are ways, as we discussed in this chapter, to
leverage people, process, and technology to improve communication and collaborative
efforts. Ultimately, this improves the business.

Conclusion
This chapter covered many aspects of ESM and its related ecosystem from a high level with
the intention of giving you a strong primer on the subject. Chapters 10 through 12 will
continue to explain facets of ESM as they relate to log collection, analysis, response, and
reporting.
We covered several ESM deployment strategies, including a basic installation, high-avail-
ability designs, and global hierarchies. Finally, we explored several examples to illustrate the
extensibility of ESM beyond traditional IT security, and we showed how convergence can
exist between logical security teams and groups such as network operations.
In this chapter, we only brieﬂy touched upon the various architectures, components, and
scenarios for which you can leverage ESM; in fact, the scenarios are virtually limitless.And
whereby this chapter provided a general overview, the following three chapters will go into a
greater level of detail to prepare you for the physical and logical security convergence case
studies.

Introduction
Although there are several ways to address log collection, the focus in this chapter is on using
the Enterprise Security Management (ESM) connector solutions mentioned in Chapter 9.
There are many ways to perform log collection, and ESM vendors offer several solutions.As
discussed in Chapter 9, logs can be sent directly from point devices to the ESM manager,
and they can come from a log collection appliance, a device manager such as a ﬁrewall or
intrusion detection system manager, logical aggregation points such as syslog servers, or some
hybrid of all of these.
A log collection mechanism needs to be scalable, extensible, and ﬂexible. Regardless of
the source, the type of log, or the rate at which logs are being generated, the ESM solution
needs to be able to process that raw log data and turn it into actionable information. More
general log collection and storage does not address this, as we discussed in Chapter 9 when
we talked about log collection appliances.This is because an appliance will provide only a
subset of the advanced analytical features used by ESM, such as correlation, anomaly detec-
tion, pattern discovery, and visualization.A log collection appliance can address some compli-
ance requirements, but deriving robust, actionable security information without these
capabilities isn’t practical. Regardless of the additional features that advanced ESM capabili-
ties add, the ﬁrst step in increasing operational efﬁciencies, reducing risk, and enhancing an
organization’s security posture is log collection. If you can’t capture the logs, your informa-
tion will be ﬂawed and limited.
As we discussed in Chapter 9, there are a number of ways to collect logs.The ﬁrst
mechanism is to simply send logs directly to the ESM manager for processing. People rarely
do this, however, because it doesn’t take advantage of preprocessing (parsing, normalization,
ﬁltering, etc.) on distributed systems; some sources don’t encrypt the transmission; some use
unreliable transport mechanisms such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP); and there is far less
control over the logs.An architecture without log connectors is rarely part of a large organi-
zation. Most organizations install log connectors or the log collection appliance. Log connec-
tors are small software applications that are installed on various operating systems—not on
appliances or network devices.They will listen for raw logs being sent to them, preprocess
the logs, enrich them, and prepare them for transport. Some organizations will deploy a ded-
icated server running multiple ﬂavors of connectors, such as open database connectors
(ODBCs), syslog connectors, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connectors,
Check Point’s Open Platform for Secure Enterprise Connectivity (OPSEC), Cisco’s Remote
Data Exchange Protocol (RDEP),ArcSight’s Common Event Format (CEF), and others.
In some rare situations, the connector is installed directly on the source device.This isn’t
a very scalable solution, and it requires installation on each device, but it is useful in the fol-
lowing situations:

National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
Publication 800-92
NIST has put together an excellent guideline for log management, called Special Publication
800-92. Note that it is a guideline, not a commandment. Organizations must evaluate it per
their organizational needs to determine what works best for them. However, it does provide
a set of clear, well-thought-out approaches to log management.
Here is a bit of background on NIST. NIST is an agency within the U.S. Commerce
Department’s Technology Administration division. It was founded in 1901 with the mission
to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness through standardization. NIST’s
Special Publication (SP)-800 series is focused on delivering guidance and standards for infor-
mation security.The SP-800 series publications represent collaborative efforts between NIST
and commercial industry, government, and academic organizations. SP-800 series publica-
tions are translated into FIPS standards that federal agencies must adhere to (NIST 800-53—
FIPS 200) as part of the FISMA Act of 2002.
The private sector also leverages SP-800 publications widely as authoritative guidance
for IT security as well as regulatory compliance.
Here are some general guidelines from NIST 800-92:
Prioritize log management appropriately throughout the organization:
■
Deﬁne requirements and goals to include applicable laws, regulations, and
organizational policies.
■
Prioritize goals to balance reduction of risk with the time and resources
needed.
Establish policies and procedures for log management:
■
Ensure a consistent approach throughout the organization.
■
Ensure that laws and regulatory requirements are being met.
■
Conﬁrm through periodic audits that logging standards and guidelines are
being followed across the board.
■
Ensure through testing and validation that the policies and procedures are
being performed properly.
www.syngress.com
Log Collection • Chapter 10
291

Create and maintain a secure log management infrastructure:
■
Create components of a log management infrastructure and determine how
these components interact.This aids in preserving the integrity and conﬁden-
tiality of log data.
■
Create an infrastructure robust enough to handle not-peak volumes.
■
Provide proper training for all staff with log management responsibilities:
■
Provide training regarding responsibilities and for skills needed.
NIST 800-92 lays out a nice guideline for this section of the book.The preceding
points, like prioritization, are so critical because if an organization is generating thousands of
logs every second, prudence dictates that not every one will be a high priority. Many may
also be false positives. So, having the ability to reduce false positives, highlight the most
essential issues, and have the supporting data to launch a response is invaluable. Of course, as
NIST also mentions, technology isn’t enough.Technology is simply a way to augment the
policies, procedures, and people that encapsulate log collection and analysis.
Now that you have a little background on logging guidelines, we’ll explore log collec-
tion by leveraging ESM connectors. Note that the process related to log connectors and log
collection appliances is the same, with the only key difference being that a log collection
appliance, as explained in Chapter 9, has the added beneﬁt of operating with the capacity for
long-term storage and rapid analysis on the device itself, or within a more robust architec-
ture that is tied into ESM. Either way, for the sake of this chapter, log collection appliances
are a vehicle for moving logs to the ESM while providing additional valuable features.
Log Normalization
Normalize, by deﬁnition, means to conform to an accepted standard or norm. In the world of
security logs, there are multiple standards and multiple formats. NIST discusses normalization
in 800-92.
In log normalization, each log data ﬁeld is converted to a particular data representa-
tion and categorized consistently. One of the most common uses of normalization is to
store dates and times in a single format. For example, one log-generating asset might
store the log time in a 12-hour format (2:34:56 P.M. EDT) and another log-generating
point device might store it in a 24-hour (14:34) format, with the time zone stored in
different notation (-0400) in a different ﬁeld. Normalizing the data makes analysis and
reporting much easier when multiple log formats are in use.
To help explain this point further, Figure 10.1 illustrates a nontechnical example of the
normalization process. Later in the chapter we’ll explore some technical examples.

Having normalized data isn’t as much of an issue in an environment that is entirely
homogeneous. However, this idealistic notion simply doesn’t exist in the real world. Most
organizations have environments consisting of many heterogeneous assets.Assets may be
operating systems, applications, network devices, and security products, as well as proprietary
devices, telephony devices, physical security devices, and so forth. Each asset has a different
logging format and reporting mechanism. Here is a small list of examples:
Syslog messages
SNMP traps
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) alerts
ODBC
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
Proprietary vendor feeds such as:
Cisco’s RDEP
Check Point’s OPSEC
Open formats such as ArcSight’s CEF

Clearly there is very little commonality among the formats of these logs.To further illus-
trate the differences, consider one log passing through or being detected by three different
products, including a Check Point ﬁrewall, a Cisco router, and a Snort intrusion detection
system, as illustrated in Figure 10.5.

Figure 10.5 One Packet Being Detected by Three Devices
In Figure 10.5, a packet originates from the Internet and works its way through the net-
work until it reaches the internal network. On its way, the packet does not appear to be
malicious to the Cisco router, and it is allowed to pass.The Snort intrusion detection system,
however, does generate an alert because the packet appears to be malicious. Finally, the
Check Point ﬁrewall also views the trafﬁc as legitimate and allows it to access the internal
network. Even though this was one packet, it generated three different logs—one each from
the router, the ﬁrewall, and the intrusion detection system. Had the target asset been moni-
tored as well, the packet may have generated logs from a host-based intrusion detection
system, the operating system, and even the targeted application.
This is a relatively common scenario in most organizations where a router connects to a
ﬁrewall and an intrusion detection system is promiscuously listening on the link between
those devices in an attempt to detect malicious activity that is either inbound or outbound
on that link.
The following examples are logs based on this scenario.These logs represent a remote
printer buffer overﬂow exploit that connects to IIS servers over port 80 while crossing
through a router and a ﬁrewall.

The ﬁrst views of the information from Cisco, Check Point, and Snort are in their
native formats.Again, these all represent the packet as outlined in Figure 10.5.The second
grouping of logs has been normalized, listing common ﬁelds within their respective columns.
When you compare them, it is easy to see that the second group is easier to read; also, more
advanced ESM capabilities can now be efﬁciently applied across the information to use cor-
relation, anomaly detection, pattern discovery, and visualization, regardless of vendor.
As part of the normalization process, the logs need to be parsed, without deleting any
information by default.This is important, as a normalization process should retain 100 per-
cent of the log data if this is what the analyst desires. For example, if you start with 60 ﬁelds
in a log and, after normalization, you keep just six of them you are creating a huge disadvan-
tage if the analyst wanted all or some of the remaining ﬁelds.Also, if you have 60 ﬁelds in a
log and you normalize six but dump the other 54 into a “catchall” bucket, you’re not really
normalizing; thus, correlation and analysis will be severely limited later in the process.
Again, normalization needs to be holistic by default, and only when the analyst and
organizational policy feel it is warranted, such as collecting information from non-mission-
www.syngress.com
Log Collection • Chapter 10
297

critical sources, should anything less than the entire log be normalized. We will discuss this
concept further later in the chapter.
From a computing perspective, a raw log is parsed prior to normalization.This parsing
process is described in NIST 800-92 as follows:
Log parsing is extracting data from a log so that the parsed values
can be used as input for another logging process. A simple example
of parsing is reading a text-based log ﬁle that contains 10 comma-
separated values per line and extracting the 10 values from each
line. Parsing is performed as part of many other logging functions,
such as log conversion and log viewing.
The following ﬁgures represent the ﬁnal transformation in moving from raw logs
derived from the source asset, into parsed logs which are primarily intended to be machine-
readable for processing, and ﬁnally to normalized logs seen in a tabular, grid format that are
intended to be more human-readable. We will cover these tabular representations of the data
in greater detail later in the chapter.The ﬁgures represent just a few of possibly hundreds of
normalized ﬁelds. Figure 10.6 illustrates normalized SAP information, Figure 10.7 shows
Windows operating system information, and Figure 10.8 contains Solaris Basic Security
Module (BSM) logs and IBM mainframe OS 390 logs.

Chapter 10 • Log Collection

Up until just a few years ago, applications such as SAP were thought to live in a silo,
separated from the security staff.Today, because these applications are often the most mis-
sion-critical, it has become important to collect and process their information too.This helps
to further amplify the fundamental shift from a security posture that is focused on the
perimeter to one that focuses on the organization holistically.
Figure 10.7 Normalized Microsoft Operating System Output with ESM
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
As with the SAP example in Figure 10.6, operating system logs are also valuable sources
of data, and as such, they need to be captured and analyzed. Many organizations have incred-
ibly large deployments with potentially tens of thousands of operating systems. Recalling the
log connector strategy used by most ESMs, there is no need to deploy any software/agent on
each device. Logs will simply be collected by existing log aggregation systems, or newly
deployed log aggregation systems such as a log collection appliance or a server running one
or more ESM log collectors.

Figure 10.8 Normalized Solaris BSM and IBM OS 390 Output with ESM
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
In Figure 10.8, we see some additional operating system logs extracted from a binary
logging system and a mainframe. For example, in their native format, the Solaris BSM logs
are in binary, requiring additional steps to read them when juxtaposed to a syslog message
that is in clear text, for example.Additionally, mainframes—being a somewhat more closed
environment than other types of systems—can rarely have software loaded directly on them
that wasn’t speciﬁcally designed for them. Because ESM connectors don’t require being
loaded on the mainframe, this isn’t an issue.This speaks to the extensibility of many ESM
connector solutions. By being able to truly interoperate with all the assets that generate logs
on a network, they can provide a complete view of the environment, much like an air trafﬁc
control tower that monitors its environment by watching what is happening on the ground
and in the air, watching the weather, and so forth.
Although the normalization process formats the logs so that they are easier to read, cor-
relate, and analyze, there is another important component that is indispensable: log severity.
Log Severity
Although the logs are now normalized, each log source may have a unique severity level
assigned to it.This is vendor-speciﬁc. Some vendors grade log severity on a scale of 1 to 10,
others use a scale of 1 to 1,000 and some use letters and various other identiﬁers. Ultimately,
www.syngress.com
300
Chapter 10 • Log Collection

you must treat the severity ﬁeld with some extra care to ensure that later in the prioritiza-
tion process (discussed later in the book), logs will be weighted correctly.
During the normalization process, log connectors collect data about the level of danger
associated with a particular log as interpreted by the asset that sent the log to the connector.
For example, an intrusion detection system may detect someone performing a port scan.
Although this is interesting, it doesn’t constitute the level of severity that is associated with a
buffer overﬂow attack or a worm outbreak.The severity of what the point device discovered,
correlated with other logs, asset information, business relevance, and other factors, can yield
an overall priority score within most ESMs.This gives an analyst a common, vendor-agnostic
framework to compare logs across products, vendors, and versions. Let’s explore the various
severities in a bit more detail, starting with device severity.
Device severity captures the language used by the data source to describe its interpreta-
tion of the danger posed by a particular log. For example, if a network intrusion detection
system detects a Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) packet that does not con-
tain enough data to conform to the DHCP format the intrusion detection system device
may ﬂag this as a level 5,000 exploit. By itself, the number 5,000 doesn’t really tell us much,
nor does it provide a lot of value when we look at multiple disparate devices collectively.
Connector severity is the translation of device severity into a normalized value. For
example, Snort uses a device severity scale of 1 to 10, whereas Check Point uses a scale of
High, Medium, and Low.The log connectors normalize these values into a single severity
scale, such as Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High.Again, this makes reading, cor-
relation, and analysis of the information more efﬁcient.
Figure 10.9 illustrates the difference between the device severity columns. Note that the
term agent severity is synonymous with the term connector severity. For example:
■
Microsoft Windows Device Severity Audit_failure normalizes to Agent Severity
Very-High.
■
Cisco VPN Device Severity 6 (Authentication Successful) normalizes to Agent
Severity Low.
■
Cisco PIX Device Severity 6 (Authentication Deny) normalizes to Agent Severity
Medium.
■
NFR Device Severity Attack normalizes to Agent Severity Medium.
Figure 10.9 helps to show the disparity in device severity nomenclature. Some are
numeric; some are text-based, and others don’t even have a native instance for this ﬁeld.
Regardless, the ESM processes these logs and creates a common severity level sometimes
called Agent/Connector Severity. ESMs are especially powerful in this regard because simply
taking a ﬂood of data and being able to parse it to show only data that has a high or very
high severity level can make unmanageable data ﬂows manageable, even before correlation
and other advanced analytics are applied.

Now that the ﬁelds within the log have been normalized and the severity scoring has
been evaluated and rendered following a level of commonality, one of the most problematic
and often least reliable of all variables in log management can be considered: time.
Log Time Correction
An extremely important factor to consider for log analysis is time.An organization with dif-
ferent assets, located in different time zones and managed by different administrators, is
bound to have at least a few assets that aren’t keeping perfect time or aren’t set to some
agreed upon time zone. More likely, systems will be off by a few seconds or minutes. During
the analysis phase, this difference can make the analyst’s job more complex.
In an idealistic situation, everything would be synced with the Network Time Protocol
(NTP), and the NTP device would get its time from a reliable source such as an atomic
clock. Unfortunately, this is never the case for larger organizations, so alternatives must be
considered.Typically with ESMs, logs will be stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
format, but will be rendered for an analyst based on the analyst’s time zone. UTC is also
known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
Most ESM connectors are conﬁgurable to allow for time correction. In some cases, the
source devices have such unreliable time that it becomes necessary to override the time the
www.syngress.com
302
Chapter 10 • Log Collection

device reports and instead use only the time at which the connector received the log.This
option would assume that the connector is always more likely to report the correct time.To
avoid such an unreliable source log time, an analyst can synchronize the clock of the source
of the logs with the ESM manager through NTP on many ESMs. If a device doesn’t natu-
rally report the time zone along with its time, the connectors will likely be able to append
the log with any user-deﬁned time zone.
With time accounted for, the next step in making the log information more useful and
scalable is the addition of categorization.
Log Categorization
As we’ve seen so far, the logs generated by various assets can be completely different in format
and content.As such, the ﬁelds that describe the characteristics of the individual log lack a
common framework by default, disallowing efﬁcient analysis and cross-device correlation.
To solve this problem, a methodology for describing logs, which enables analysts to
understand the real signiﬁcance of a particular log as reported from different devices, can be
used.This is called categorization.Another beneﬁt that categorization enables is the creation of
vendor-agnostic correlation rules, which we will address in the next chapter. Correlation on
categorized logs allows a scalable solution in which a single correlation rule can be relevant
regardless of the vendor and regardless of the speciﬁc log details of multiple scenarios.This
model is expressed in the form of log categories, and the log connector assigns these cate-
gories before the ESM manager receives the log.The combination of normalization and cat-
egorization which leverages distributed computing by using connectors that preprocess the
data enables the ESM manager to be focused on the analysis phase of the process instead of
parsing and manipulating raw log data.
You can apply categorization to several other ﬁelds within a log besides the actual ﬁeld
expressing the content of the log.This may include detailing the log’s behavior, which tech-
niques it uses, its outcome, and various other categories. However, because this and the other
chapters in this section are focused on creating a primer for the case studies, let’s just con-
sider an example that relates to categorization on the content of the log because that will be
sufﬁcient for these cases.
Consider an analyst that is looking at logs which have been normalized, categorized, and
otherwise preprocessed before being sent to the ESM for analysis. Further consider that there
are three ﬁrewalls from different vendors, and three intrusion detection systems also from dif-
ferent vendors, around the network.An attacker coming in from the Internet is going after
three different points of entry with a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SYN Flood
attack.The attack targets networks behind each ﬁrewall. Intrusion detection systems are
tapped into the link between the ﬁrewall and the Internet router and are also being moni-
tored, as shown in Figure 10.10.
www.syngress.com
Log Collection • Chapter 10
303

Figure 10.10 Categorization of Logs
Figure 10.10 shows the attacker sending TCP SYN Floods to each ﬁrewall intrusion
detection system pair.The ﬁrewalls are blocking the attacks and the intrusion detection sys-
tems are detecting the attacks before they are blocked. Because each pair represents a dif-
ferent vendor, their output is very different.Although normalization will place all their ﬁelds
into the appropriate column, categorization takes it a step further by appending the log with
categorization ﬁelds.The names of the logs are diverse, but the categorized ﬁelds are iden-
tical.They are shown as Attack Blocked and TCP SYN Flood.This makes is very easy to run
reports and to create correlation rules (both discussed in the following chapters), and it
simply makes sense of the data without being dependent on the speciﬁc vendor’s output.
This is a highly extensible model that virtually all enterprise-level ESM solutions support.An
important point to reinforce is that categorization and normalization do not delete any of
the initial data. Normalization simply moves the ﬁelds into a common format and catego-
rization adds additional ﬁelds to enrich the content and make it more usable.
An analyst may want to add several other variables to the logs, when they are collected
by a connector, to further customize them with supporting information.These may include
geographical locations and business information. In addition, a number of additional variables
can be categorized for each log to add extra value through log enrichment.All of these fea-
tures make the logs more usable, but they are beyond the scope of what is needed for the
case studies, and thus are beyond the scope of this particular text.
At this point, the logs have been normalized, the severity levels based on disparate
devices now have commonality, the time is accurate, and the logs have been fully categorized
to become more usable.Thus, it is time to move the logs from the connectors to the ESM
manager.

Chapter 10 • Log Collection

What to Transport
According to NIST,“…organizations should only require logging and analyzing the data that
is of greatest importance, and also have non-mandatory recommendations for which other
types and sources of data should be logged and analyzed if time and resources permit.” In
other words, anything that is mission-critical to your environment should be logged.
One way to determine what is mission-critical is to ask the disaster recovery team what
assets, if destroyed, would make it impossible for the organization to operate or would cause
signiﬁcant issues.The assets the team provides will be absolutely essential. Historically, when
people think about a log management program they start at their perimeter with devices
such as ﬁrewalls, IPSes, routers, and virtual private networks (VPNs). However, although
these are sometimes mission-critical, depending on your organization’s mission the most sig-
niﬁcant assets are more commonly critical applications, operating systems, databases, physical
security safeguards, and so forth; not the perimeter.
ESMs offer a number of options for customizing which logs are actually sent from log
connectors to the ESM manager. Some examples include sending the normalized and catego-
rized logs, or sending the original, unmodiﬁed logs as well. Some ESM connectors can even
send the payload of a log such as that generated from an intrusion detection system alert.
Raw Log Data and Litigation Quality
We’ve discussed normalized data that has been categorized and manipulated to provide
optimal value for analysis and processing. Sometimes an organization, although still needing
this information, also wants the raw log data.This is usually because the organization wants
to have litigation-quality log data. However, there is a lot of confusion around what makes
litigation-quality data.This topic generally comes down to the admissibility and credibility of
the electronic evidence.This section of the chapter will explore various legal issues. Note
that it doesn’t act as a legal opinion or legal advice; as with any legal matter, issues regarding
compliance with speciﬁc laws and regulations should be discussed with legal counsel.
In August 2006, Kahn Consulting Inc., which specializes in legal, compliance, and policy
issues related to information technology, published a paper titled “Computer Security Log
Files as Evidence.” We will expand upon some of the points from that paper in this section.
Two disparate yet interrelated challenges are linked to electronic evidence: admissibility
and creditability. For evidence to be admissible, a court or other regulator must accept it.A
number of laws govern the admissibility of electronic information; however, except for a few
limited exceptions, most jurisdictions don’t have any speciﬁc prohibitions on electronic
information for evidence admissibility.
To be creditable, electronic information has to be authentic, complete, and trustworthy
enough that it can be valued to a degree whereby it could inﬂuence the outcome of a legal
proceeding. In short, a piece of electronic information may be 100 percent admissible, but if
its credibility is low, its integrity can be attacked and it will likely be excluded, or at a min-
imum, its inﬂuence will be greatly diminished.

Log Collection • Chapter 10
305

Because there are so many disparate forms of log data, such as proprietary and legacy
formats, XML, syslog, SNMP, ODBC, and binary, the solutions used for collecting and ana-
lyzing logs will often have the capability to normalize the various formats into a common
schema.This makes more advanced analysis such as correlation, anomaly detection, and pat-
tern discovery much more efﬁcient and effective.
As part of the normalization process, the logs need to be parsed. For mission-critical
assets, 100 percent data capture should be maintained. Depending on organizational policies,
less critical assets may not require such holistic collection, thus reducing storage, processing,
and analysis resources.To get a better idea of normalization, consider the following.
For assets that are not mission-critical, the ﬂexibility of reduced ﬁeld capture, ﬁltering,
and aggregation can save on bandwidth and storage requirements as well as log processing
and log analysis resources. Reduced ﬁeld capture means that for less critical assets, every ﬁeld
doesn’t have to be collected within a log; just the ones deemed most essential. For mission-
critical systems, log collection should be conducted on 100 percent of the ﬁelds within each
log. Filtering will remove entire logs, not just ﬁelds within logs that are determined to be less
essential. Finally, aggregation enables duplicate logs to be rendered as a single log.Take, for
example, a PING Flood. If a device receives 10,000 ICMP Echo Requests over just a few
seconds from the same source, and the packets are identical excluding the timestamp, it
would be advantageous to process, analyze, and store a single log with a start and end time
representing the length of the incident as well as a base count to represent how many
packets were aggregated. Reduced ﬁeld capture, ﬁltering, and aggregation should always be
aligned with organizational policies.
To put this into context, consider compliance regulations.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (SOX) makes it clear that all ﬁnancial transactions need to be logged. However, if an
organization is interested in addressing this regulation, and only 10 percent of the logs on a
database are related to ﬁnancial transactions, why would it want to capture the other 90 per-
cent if the logs don’t make the organization more compliant, don’t further mitigate risk, and
simply don’t provide the organization with additional value but will incur additional costs?
Laws and regulations are clear that authentic electronic information can be admitted as
long as the information’s integrity and accuracy meet given standards.Thus, data that has
gone through normalization, aggregation, and so forth can be used as digital evidence, even
when considering the concept of “original” information.
Original information is the equivalent of having a piece of paper with an individual’s inked
signature on it, not a photocopy. For electronic information, the term original is difﬁcult or
even impossible to deﬁne.Although the Federal Rules of Evidence show a clear preference
for original documents, for electronic evidence, where duplicates are less of an issue because
of the capability of making inﬁnite perfect copies, various laws and regulations have
responded. For example, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
(ESIGN) Act states that the three points to satisfy legal requirements for electronic evidence
also satisfy the requirements of an “original.”The electronic evidence must do the following:
■
Accurately reﬂect the information set forth in the contract or other record
www.syngress.com
306
Chapter 10 • Log Collection

■
Remain accessible for the period the law requires
■
Be able to be accurately reproduced in the future
With this understanding of the “original,” it is clear that for security logs, the emphasis
needs to be placed on the nature and extent of the alteration that occurs. If the normaliza-
tion and similar techniques maintain the meaning of the original, not only can it be used as
litigation-quality data, but also it actually increases the usability and effectiveness of the log
data.
Even with what has been addressed so far, any log collection and analysis solution needs
to be ﬂexible enough to support various organizational risk postures. If an organization feels
that it wants to retain raw log data, above and beyond any legal requirements, it should cer-
tainly be able to, and do so in addition to the normalized information. It is not unusual to
ﬁnd an organization that approaches IT governance in a manner that goes beyond legal and
regulatory requirements. However, with raw log data, the integrity of the asset that generated
the log can still come into question as easily as if the logs were normalized.A log collection
and analysis solution is only as good as the data that enters it. Some assets, such as mission-
critical servers, may be secured with controls that mitigate the risk of information being
altered, removed, or added. However, systems such as laptops will likely not have such strin-
gent controls.The accuracy and authenticity of any log can be called into question, but logs
from assets that do not have robust security controls may be more likely to be thrown out.
A short reference to author authenticity is also important to discuss here. It helps to
illustrate how easily logs can be overshadowed by legal issues.The Federal Rules of Evidence
list criteria for questioning electronic evidence, including determining whether evidence is
altered, whether evidence is reliable, and the authenticity of the author.The author is a par-
ticularly interesting area to question. For example, even if malicious activity is tracked back
to a person’s home PC, he lives alone, and there is copious supporting log information
regarding his activities, if he has an unsecured wireless connection he could simply claim that
any malicious acts could have been perpetrated by anybody in his neighborhood and thus
create doubt. In this case, the law trumps the technology.
Logs, regardless of whether they are normalized or raw, need to ultimately be credible
and admissible to be of any use in a legal situation.Also, the ESIGN Act’s interpretation of
the concept of “original” information requires the logs to accurately reﬂect contracts or
other records, remain accessible pursuant to legal requirements, and allow for accurate repro-
duction.The Federal Rules of Evidence state that if an organization relies on any record
such as a security log in the routine course of business, the information will be generally
admissible. However, there is nothing to stop an expert from challenging its integrity. In the
end, even with concrete log management, many intangibles beyond a log collection and
analysis solution are nested within the law; even the best evidence can be thrown out if it
can’t withstand scrutiny.

Payload
Payload is most commonly associated with intrusion detection system alerts. Instead of just a
log with detailed ﬁelds, an intrusion detection system can capture the actual payload (the
trafﬁc that created the log, similar to a packet trace with a sniffer), associate that payload with
the appropriate log, and store it for human analysis. Prudence dictates that if the intrusion
detection system can retain the payload for human analysis, the ESM’s log connector will do
the same and send not just the log, but also the payload data. Further, the ESM’s console that
interfaces with the ESM manager will allow for viewing of the payload information.

Many security analysts view information such as this as though it’s gold, even though to
most people it is a whole lot of nothing.As such, an analyst would never want to give up the
value that the payload can give him, just to have a central location for log analysis.This is
why more advanced ESM solutions will natively support the retrieval of payloads. Figure
10.11 illustrates an Internet Protocol (IP) header payload displayed through an ESM’s pay-
load viewer.This particular example happens to be in Hex format.
When performing log analysis on a bit of information that happens to have a payload,
the analyst can typically select that log and display the related payload through various for-
mats.This assists the analyst in the investigation so that he doesn’t need to access a source
device, such as an intrusion detection system, just to read a payload.

Data Reduction at the Log Connector
Up to this point, we’ve covered what to do if you want to have more data built into your
log collection phase. Now we’ll cover some solutions for reducing the amount of data
without scarifying quality or utility. For some organizations, this is an extremely critical set
of concepts because although logging every bit of information may sound like the best
approach from an academic perspective, in the real world, storage costs money and will
require systems to process the data and analysts to review it.As explained earlier, storage may
not even be necessary based on your organization’s policies or legal requirements.
All logs are not created equally, and some sources may not generate useful information at
all. For example, some older physical security devices such as badge readers do generate logs,
but only as they relate to maintenance, not access controls.Also, logs often have extra ﬁelds
that add little value, a high level of duplication, and output that is irrelevant to the analysis
process.This information should be modiﬁed per the organization’s log management policies
to leverage features such as ﬂexible ﬁeld collection, aggregation, and ﬁltering. Not only will
having an efﬁcient log management program help increase security and operational efﬁcien-
cies, but it will also reduce costs associated with log processing, storage, and analysis.

Chapter 10 • Log Collection

Flexible Field Collection
Simply put, sometimes you want to collect every ﬁeld in a log, sometimes you want to parse
off certain ﬁelds, and other times you want the bare minimum. Most log connectors allow
for this capability speciﬁc to the source. In most situations, there will be a combination of
log collection scenarios, so having disparate sources treated differently in terms of how many
ﬁelds to collect allows optimal ﬂexibility.
Log-Filtering an Aggregation
“Because of the volume of logs, it might be appropriate in some cases to reduce the logs by
ﬁltering out log entries that do not need to be archived,” according to NIST 800-92.The
net is:
Filtering and aggregation [are] recommended as a means to only
capture logs of security and compliance value based on the organi-
zation’s retention policy. 
Organizations should support a reasonableness position in not collecting useless log data.
You can conﬁgure log connectors with ﬁlter conditions and aggregation logic that will
focus and reduce the volume of logs sent to the ESM manager. For example, you can use ﬁl-
ters to sort out logs that have certain characteristics, that come from speciﬁc network
devices, or that were generated by vulnerability scanners. With aggregation, you can con-
ﬁgure most ESM connectors to aggregate (summarize and merge) logs that have the same
values in a speciﬁed set of ﬁelds, either a speciﬁed number of times or within a speciﬁed
time limit.
Connector aggregation merges logs with matching values into a single aggregated log.
The aggregated log contains only the values the logs have in common, plus the various
timestamps.This reduces the number of individual logs the ESM manager has to evaluate
and store within the ESM database.
Let’s look at a few practical examples of ﬁltering and aggregation with some ﬁrewall logs.
In Figure 10.13, the Cisco PIX ﬁrewall logs can be addressed by ﬁltering and aggregation.
In the ﬁrst group, either the Built inbound TCP connection or the Teardown TCP connection
can be removed; only one is needed if additional information such as directionality is being
collected from other supporting network devices such as routers and switches.
In the second group, the Denied Telnet login sessions are identical—excluding time.As
such, we have a single log, with a base count representing how many times it happened (in
this case, four) and a start and end time (in this case, the start time is 22:00:48 and the end
time is 22:00:50).Thus, all four logs are aggregated into a single log without losing critical
information.
The third group is another example of not needing two logs to show a connection if
logs are being gathered from other network sources.
The forth group is simply information that the analysts may consider unnecessary (such
as the source device reporting its status).

Log Collection • Chapter 10

The net result is about 70 percent reduction in overall data transported to the ESM,
processed, analyzed, and stored.
Figure 10.13 Filtering and Aggregation of Firewall Logs
Figure 10.13 shows some of the advanced, value-added features that ESM connectors
can provide. Because the connector is providing ﬁltering and aggregation, the distributed
preprocessing is saving network bandwidth between the connector and the ESM manager,
processing on the manager, analysis time from the analyst, and storage space within the
database.At the same time, pertinent information isn’t being lost, so maximum operational
efﬁciencies are gained.The analyst generally sets up ﬁltering and aggregation parameters
through the ESM’s graphical user interface (GUI), and applies them to one or many connec-
tors.They can be mixed and matched, and they can be very detailed in their approach to
ensure that aggregation and ﬁltering are being done only on non-mission-critical assets
should that be the desired design.You generally can ﬁnd huge performance gains by applying
ﬁltering and aggregation to devices such as ﬁrewalls and routers while less information is
generally ﬁltered and aggregated from assets such as intrusion detection systems, antivirus
software, and vulnerability scanners.
If we pull all the ideas together around ﬁltering, aggregation, and ﬂexible ﬁeld collection
into a common abstract, the relationships become more apparent. Figure 10.14 illustrates
these relationships. On the y-axis going from Complete Log Collection to Reduced Log
Collection, we can see the effects of log aggregation and ﬁltering.At the top it is 100 percent
data capture, so all the rows are relevant.This is common for mission-critical assets.At the
www.syngress.com
314
Chapter 10 • Log Collection

bottom, several rows are removed.This is common for situations such as ﬁrewall ﬁltering, as
discussed previously. On the x-axis going from Complete Field Collection to Reduced Field
Collection and then Minimal Field Collection we see the effects of ﬂexible ﬁeld collection. On
the far right, all the columns are preserved, again for mission-critical assets. In the middle, the
columns have been reduced; thus, some information is not collected. Finally, on the bottom
left, only a minimal set of columns are preserved, such as time, IPs, ports, and other basic
parameters.
For those devices that are mission-critical, it makes sense to follow a methodology that is
focused on the upper right. For other devices, it may make sense to collect only the minimal
level of data represented at the bottom left.The key is to ﬁnd a balance between operational
efﬁciencies, security, and cost that is in line with your organization’s policies, and to leverage
an ESM solution that gives you the ﬂexibility to pick and choose.
Figure 10.14 Log Aggregation and Filtering Matrix
Now that we have determined what log information to transport to the ESM, the next
logical question is when to transport this information.
When to Transport
There are two primary log transport capabilities for most ESMs: real-time and batch-mode.
The transport capabilities move the logs from the connectors to the ESM manager for pro-
cessing and analysis. Remember, no correlation happens on the connectors. For advanced
analysis, the data must be processed on the ESM manager.
www.syngress.com
Log Collection • Chapter 10
315

In real time, the logs are generated by the source device, collected by the log connectors,
and automatically sent to the ESM for processing following normalization, ﬁltering, and so
forth.This is the most common form of log transport, as most organizations are as equally
concerned with forensics analysis as they are with real-time analysis. However, in some situa-
tions batching makes more sense.
Consider an international organization headquartered in the United States, with ofﬁces
in Asia. Further, let’s assume that its ESM manager resides in the United States and the log
connectors are deployed throughout its regional facilities in Asia. Many organizations have
dedicated links between ofﬁces, and many of these are older frame relay links that operate at
around 56k. It is also likely that these links are being used for critical, even time-sensitive
communication between the ofﬁces. It would not be prudent to try to stream thousands of
logs per second across this link.An alternative is to run the log connectors in a batch mode.
Batching will allow the log ﬂow to be more predictable and controlled. For example, an ana-
lyst can invoke a policy that tells the log connectors to send a batch of logs every 60 seconds
or every 100 logs.
There is an added beneﬁt in batch mode: Should the severity of the log (which we cov-
ered earlier) be high, the log will be sent right away.This helps to ensure that the most time-
sensitive security data is quickly relayed and processed.
There may also be a desire to run log connectors in batch mode for part of the day and
in real-time mode at other times. For example, during business hours, batching may be more
desirable, at least for non-mission-critical assets, and during off hours, real-time mode might
be more appropriate. Being able to have time-based alternatives helps us to truly customize
the log collection process and to parallel the organization’s operational parameters.
Occasionally, information is ﬁrst copied to removable media such as a DVD and then
imported into the ESM.This manual process doesn’t lend itself to real-time analysis; how-
ever, it is useful for situations in which forensics analysis of assets is desired and the assets are
air-gapped from the ESM environment. Even legacy and proprietary applications usually
lend themselves to some form of logging whereby logs can be captured either at the source
or at a log connector aggregator deployment (such as FTPing or SCPing ﬁles from one
device to another device that is running a log connector). However, for some products, such
as legacy physical security systems, there simply is no network connectivity, and sneaker-net
is the only solution.This is rarely an issue with newer physical security solutions as they now
are almost always outﬁtted with network connectivity and logging capabilities.
Now that we have a methodology for what to transport and when, our ﬁnal determina-
tion concerns how to transport.
How to Transport
Robust ESM connectors almost always use TCP as their underlying transport mechanism.TCP
will provide a connection-oriented approach that is more reliable than UDP.The connector
will also establish a heartbeat between itself and the ESM manager.With the heartbeat, the
www.syngress.com
316
Chapter 10 • Log Collection

manager can track the uptime of the connector. It is sometimes common for a connector to
not report any log data to the ESM manager for long periods.As such, it is important to know
that the connector is still up and running and just doesn’t have anything to send. In the analysis
phase, a lack of heartbeat information or log information from a connecter is a problem and
the analyst can be made aware of this problem through, for example, a rule ﬁring, a visual icon
changing state from up to down, or an e-mail alerting him of this fact.
If the link between the connector and the ESM manager does go down, the connector
will cache the log information until it is able to reestablish the connection to the ESM man-
ager, helping to reduce the risk of information being lost.This is just one mechanism for
assisting in availability. Other options include having the log connector send logs to multiple
ESM managers at once, or sending to a primary ESM manager and failing over to a sec-
ondary ESM manager in a high-availability architecture if there is some type of system or
network problem.This is a way for the connectors to complement the HA strategies out-
lined in Chapter 9 regarding high-availability managers and databases.
To reduce the load applied to the network, the log data will be compressed. Even though
logs are somewhat small, compression eases network strain and increases overall efﬁciencies.
The ﬁnal step, before the logs leave the connector and move to the network, is encryp-
tion. Logs are encrypted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption with a 1,024-
bit key exchange.Thus, even if the native log capability of the asset doesn’t encrypt the logs,
they will be encrypted in transport to the ESM manager.
This combination of TCP, log caching, high-availability architectures, compression, and
encryption provides a solid foundation for log transmission. It facilitates reliable, highly avail-
able, efﬁcient, and secure transmission of every log.
Once the logs have successfully been transported to the ESM manager for processing,
they are no longer logs; they are events. Starting in the next chapter, we’ll no longer be
referring to logs; we’ll be referencing this post-connector processed data as events.

Introduction
As we discussed in the preceding chapter, we are no longer considering the data being pro-
cessed by the Enterprise Security Management (ESM) system as being a simple log.The logs
have been enriched by the connectors or log collection appliances to the point where they
are now considered events. When the ESM system receives these events a series of real-time
operations are applied in memory. In this way, ESM solutions help identify and manage mali-
cious activity more efﬁciently than having to rely upon a database for historical queries.
Some examples of this are real-time event prioritization, correlation, and visual analytics.This
chapter will focus on the ESM system’s capability to process these events in real time and
some of the tools that analysts can use to assist in investigations and incident response in the
form of workﬂow and network remediation.The next chapter will cover event analysis from
a forensics and reporting perspective by using historical data from the ESM system’s database.
Threat Formulas
One of the greatest beneﬁts of an ESM solution is the ability to escalate the most critical
events to the top of a priority list while events of lesser importance are ranked lower.This
seems very straightforward, but when there are possibly hundreds of millions of events per
day from thousands of sources and multiple geographies, things become more complex. In
order to address this complexity, ESM solutions commonly leverage threat formulas to per-
form the calculations.
Threat formulas are sometimes called priority formulas. Generally, a number of evaluations
are applied to each event the ESM system is processing, in order to ascertain the event’s
importance in relation to other variables such as known vulnerabilities, the history of the
source or target, business relevance, and so on. On most ESM systems, this is an automatic
feature, because trying to manually assign priorities wouldn’t be feasible with even a mod-
erate level of event load.
Consider a threat formula that applies a numeric value of 0–10 to each event based on
the importance or urgency of the event.A 0 would be assigned to events in which the for-
mula determined the variables to be unimportant or nonurgent, and a 10 would represent a
critical event. In this case, the higher the number is, the higher the risk. However, not every
high-level priority is a security threat. For example, if a Web server’s hard drive appears to be
failing, the priority level will be high, even though from a purely security-focused perspec-
tive, this likely has nothing to do with a security incident. When asset information is added
into the equation, the threat formula becomes even more accurate because business context
can also be leveraged.
Asset Criticality
For large organizations, one of the most important variables is asset criticality. Wholesale
security rarely scales sufﬁciently, and mission-critical assets need to be addressed differently. It
www.syngress.com

Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

would be great if an organization had the resources to treat a print server just as securely as a
mission-critical database with sensitive information, but that’s not the real world, and certain
assets are simply more critical to an organization than others are.
Many organizations approach their disaster recovery team to determine what assets are
so critical that business can’t be done without them. Such assets may include speciﬁc servers
and network gear, geographies, network address space, data centers, and the like. In practice,
it is often better to start with general groups and then to get more granular over time.
Unfortunately, this type of information isn’t usually within the capability of vulnerability
scanners, and sometimes not even within traditional asset management systems. However,
given that large groups can have criticality applied (for example, all Oracle databases, or all
Linux servers), assigning asset criticality manually is manageable.An example of asset criti-
cality can be applied as follows.All customer-facing systems are considered very critical and
all lab systems are considered noncritical.Thus, if events are having an impact on both the
customer-facing and the lab systems in tandem, with all other variables being equal, the cus-
tomer-facing systems will have a higher priority, alerting an analyst to address them ﬁrst.
Figure 11.1 illustrates a tabular view of events and their related priority after the events
have been processed by the threat formula including the application of asset criticality. Most
ESM systems will allow this type of information to be displayed in a number of styles and
formats, and additionally allow the views to be ﬁltered and sorted.This ﬁgure shows that
although some high-level priority events are assigned a value of 10, the majority of the
events fall somewhere between 3 and 7.An organization may set up an alerting policy
whereby it is paged for all events having a value of 7 and higher, is e-mailed for all events
having a value of between 4 and 6, and for all events that score a value of 3 or less, it may
simply be added to a case that is reviewed as time allows. In addition, exceptions may exist
stating that for any mission-critical asset receiving a priority of 5 or greater, a page is sent.
Priorities act as a valuable tool for event triage.
Thus far, the ESM manager has considered a single event, vulnerability information, asset
information, and related variables, and has applied a priority.The events still need to be com-
pared against conditions, however. Conditions can’t be determined with just prioritization;
correlation is needed, particularly when a condition extends across multiple events.
Correlated events themselves which are based on other events can also be prioritized.
Following prioritization, correlation is the next step in the automated event analysis process.

Correlation and Rules
Across multiple events, correlation integrates the key security factors that are critical in
determining the potential for signiﬁcant damage within an organization.These factors
include the following:
■
Real-time events from heterogeneous devices
■
Results of vulnerability scans, and other sources of threat data
■
The value of the asset to the organization
Correlation combines the severity of potential threats and attacks with the value and
vulnerability of business processes and assets to calculate and clearly communicate the
intrinsic risk of particular security events viewed as a whole as opposed to simply viewing a
single event.As a result, security resources are applied where the potential damage is most
acute, and business managers can set policies and monitor the security health of their most
important assets. Correlation within ESM is generally expressed through rules.
A rule is a programmed procedure that evaluates incoming events for speciﬁc conditions
and patterns, infers meaning about their signiﬁcance, and can initiate actions in response.
Rules in this case are similar to intrusion detection system rules, except that they operate on
an event stream instead of a bit stream.They are commonly constructed using aggregation
www.syngress.com
322
Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

and Boolean pattern matching to evaluate objects, such as event ﬁelds, and other supporting
criteria. Some very basic examples of rule logic are as follows:
■
If a vendor-speciﬁc attack string is detected that contains “123xyz” or if the ESM
event categorization ﬁeld contains buffer overﬂow, apply a condition.
■
If an event is detected by an intrusion detection system and the target is consid-
ered mission-critical, create a case. If the target is also vulnerable to the attack
detected by the intrusion detection system, send a page. If the attack appears to be
successful, launch network remediation efforts.
■
If the source of an attack is known to be malicious or the destination target has a
history of being attacked, all priority scores should be increased.
■
For all devices running Oracle, but not installed on Linux and not located in
North America, apply a condition.
■
If the same type of event occurs from one source to one destination over a deﬁned
period, apply a condition; if the same type of event occurs from one source to
multiple destinations over a deﬁned period, apply another condition.
■
If correlated rule A occurs and correlated rule B occurs within a deﬁned period,
launch condition C.
Logic examples of this type can literally go on forever. Fortunately, most ESM systems
are loaded with prebuilt rule content that you can use as written or that you can modify for
speciﬁc needs.You often can use this content as a template to create other rules, or you can
create rules from scratch through a graphical user interface (GUI) editor. Because of normal-
ization and categorization, it is common to write rules that are vendor-agnostic and thus can
be applied to a greater set of events as opposed to speciﬁc vendor event strings. In practice, a
large organization is likely to have fewer than 100 rules for the entire organization.This
approach is very different from an intrusion detection system approach in which rules or sig-
natures may number in the multiple hundreds or thousands. It’s important to remember that
ESM is at an abstract layer above the intrusion detection system, ﬁrewalls, and similar point
solutions.As such, rules in ESM beneﬁt from the quality of those point solutions as well as
the ability to correlate multiple, disparate point solutions. ESM systems need not have the
bit-layer granularity required when looking at data on the wire that point solutions require.
This is because to create events, ESM systems are in fact correlating on the event output
which those point solutions generate.To better understand these concepts we will explore
some additional examples. Scenario-based examples are the best way to illustrate the power
of rules and, thereby, correlation. So, let’s consider a few different scenarios.
Scenario One
In this scenario, correlation is not used.An attacker scans the target network for open ports
and vulnerable hosts.After a few days, he launches an attack against a server that he thinks is
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
323

vulnerable to the attack.The attack successfully passes through the target organization’s
external ﬁrewall.
Without correlation, the outcome of these events is pretty much guesswork. Let’s assume
that a network-based intrusion detection system outside the ﬁrewall detects the port and
vulnerability scans. Furthermore, let’s assume that the same intrusion detection system detects
the actual attack which happens a few days later. In addition to the intrusion detection
system events, the ﬁrewall may have logged accepted trafﬁc passing from the attacker to the
target. However, most people would say that in real life, packet rejects and drops are given
more scrutiny than packet accepts, which means that those attacks which successfully pass
through the ﬁrewall may be missed without additional safeguards in place, such as anther
intrusion detection system behind the ﬁrewall.Therefore, what an analyst may basically be
left with are some intrusion detection system events and nothing to correlate them with. He
has no idea whether the attack was successful, whether the target was vulnerable to the
attack, how critical the target asset was, or any other supporting information.
Now let’s take a look at a new scenario that uses the same use case, but where correla-
tion is applied.
Scenario Two
In this scenario, we’ll add a little more detail to help amplify the key points. Before any type
of malicious activity occurs, the security team scans all systems on the network for open
ports, OS, vulnerability information, applications, and so on.Additionally, the team labels
assets within the ESM system with tags such as subnets, geographies, business relevance, and
other identiﬁers based on criticality. For example, a mission-critical database may be consid-
ered more important than a domain name system (DNS) server.Thus, before an attack even
occurs, the ESM system is aware of this information. Figure 11.2 illustrates the general ﬂow
of events.An attacker launches reconnaissance probes against the target. Later the target is
compromised. Finally, the compromised target communicates back out to the target on a
ﬁrewall-allowable outbound port.

Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

The attacker launches his initial reconnaissance sweeps on the target’s network.This is in
the form of a horizontal port scan that the intrusion detection system detects and sends to
the ESM system.A horizontal port scan is essentially checking every system for a speciﬁc
port. For example, there are 100 targets and an attacker wants to identify which ones are
running a Web server operating on either port 80 or port 443.The opposite of the hori-
zontal port scan is the vertical port scan.These scans check a speciﬁc target, but they check
multiple or all possible ports on the target.The attacker in this case is scanning for port 22,
which is Secure Shell (SSH).
Because port scans are a relatively common activity, they rarely warrant a response
greater than logging the event and making sure the security team is aware of it.The ESM
system has the additional capability of creating an active list, sometimes known as a watch list,
for the attacker and the target.This allows the ESM system to know that a speciﬁc Internet
Protocol (IP) address has been scanning an asset and the target asset has been probed.
Therefore, the attacker’s IP address may be added to a reconnaissance list and the target IP
address may be added to a scanned list.
Active lists can also be powerful from the opposite perspective. If somebody is scanning
an organization’s network today, but last week he attacked it, the organization wouldn’t want
to treat the simple port scan like other port scans. Rather, because the organization knows
this is a malicious source address, network range, domain, and so on, the escalation may be
greater. So, instead of an e-mail alert and generating a case to review the incident, network
response measures may be taken so that the source IP is blocked from entering the organiza-
tion’s network at any ingress point.
Returning to the attacker scanning the network for open SSH ports, once he ﬁnds a
system that is running SSH, he scans it for vulnerabilities.Although running a vulnerability
scan against a target is often more intrusive than a port scan, it is still relatively common and
may not warrant a more dramatic response.Also, the intrusion detection system detects this
activity and updates the ESM system. However, the attacker will now be automatically pro-
moted from a reconnaissance list to a suspicious list, ensuring that any future activity will fall
under increased scrutiny.
The attacker does, in fact, discover that not only is the target running SSH, but the par-
ticular version is vulnerable to exploitation. Now things start to get really interesting.The
attacker waits a few days before launching the attack against the target. He already knows
which system to attack and which exploit to use based on his earlier reconnaissance activity.
When the attack is launched, it is over SSH, which means that at this point, the trafﬁc is
encrypted and the intrusion detection system won’t provide much value.
Because SSH is allowed, the ﬁrewall reports an accept packet from the attacker to the
target.This information by itself isn’t interesting, but when you correlate it with the active
list data, the priority increases.Also, recalling the organization’s own scanning and asset criti-
cality labeling, the asset is known to be running a vulnerable version of SSH that the organi-
zation hasn’t been able to upgrade because the upgraded version isn’t backward-compatible
with the organization’s applications.This is a common problem with patch management and
backward compatibility, and the organization is taking a business risk by leaving a known
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
325

vulnerable system online.These types of risks are taken every day, and unfortunately they are
rather common. If the business impact of taking a system ofﬂine while the compatibility
issue is remedied is perceived as being greater than the security risk, it will typically remain.
To make matters worse, this is not only a mission-critical asset, but also one that has
been categorized as relevant under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) because it stores
ﬁnancial information. Whenever systems that fall under regulatory compliance are impacted,
a greater number of stakeholders tend to take notice because it can have a direct impact on
audits.And even more important, they are likely part of a compliance group because they are
in some way relevant to sensitive information such as storing or transmitting ﬁnancial data.
At this point, we know a malicious attacker has previously probed the network. We also
know that the ﬁrewall has allowed his port 22 SSH trafﬁc through to the target.The ESM
system knows the target is an important asset under the SOX group, it is running SSH, and
it is vulnerable to known SSH attacks.
The exploitation of the vulnerability takes place within seconds.The attacker success-
fully launches the exploit over SSH on the target asset.The target asset then begins to com-
municate via the outbound File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the attacker’s address because the
attacker knows that outbound FTP is commonly allowed by ﬁrewalls.
The attacker has successfully compromised the target asset and now the asset is talking
directly back to the attacker. By correlating all of these relevant data points from both histor-
ical active lists and real-time data, the ESM system is able to alert the security team and/or
make the necessary changes to stop the attack from continuing.
Not all correlation needs to be this detailed. It could be something as basic as a few
attempted brute force logins followed by a successful login. Or it could be statistical correla-
tion whereby there is a substantial change in trafﬁc patterns. For example, SQL trafﬁc may
increase to a much higher level during a SQL Slammer attack than during normal operation.
It is also important to note that just a couple of events, or thousands of events, may be
generating a rule ﬁring a correlated alert.The power is in the extensibility and the fact that
the more asset information feeding the ESM system, the better the output will be.
Now that the events have been processed, prioritized, and correlated, they are ready for
analysis by a human.The nice thing about ESM is that the analyst can look at only high-
level, correlated events, she can look at all events including every ﬁeld within the event and
even the payload, as we discussed in Chapter 10, or she can look at any mix between the
two.This provides great scalability and incident analysis capabilities.
The next scenario is more complex; thus, we will use screen shots to better illustrate an
attack from both the attacker’s and the security analyst’s perspective.This scenario will use some
concepts that we will discuss later on in this chapter, but even though we haven’t covered them
yet, we’ll touch on them here to strengthen your overall understanding of correlation.

Scenario Three
Scenario three is based on an attacker with a goal of compromising the Web server
www.xyz-target.com and taking control of the system.Although this is the primary focus of
the attack, the attacker will also choose to create data overload for the analyst in order to
hide the attack in a storm of events as opposed to using stealth.The idea is that the attack is
just a few grains of sand and the extra events create an entire desert of data, making it difﬁ-
cult for the analyst to pinpoint the attacker’s goal.
The attacker starts of with an Nmap scan. Because the method of attack is designed to
use data overload instead of stealth, the attacker will continue scanning various servers and
networks within the organization from different source addresses, creating as many events
and alarms as possible. Figure 11.3 illustrates portions of the attacker’s scan.
Via Nmap, shown on the left of Figure 11.3, the primary target is discovered to be run-
ning and accessible. Furthermore, it appears to be a Windows 2000 server running multiple
services, including default Internet services, FTP, and DNS, and its Server Message Block
(SMB) ports are open.This is all in addition to its real job of being an Apache Web server.
Once this information is identiﬁed, the attacker will then begin a vulnerability scan of
the target with Nessus.This scan appears on the right of Figure 11.3. Knowing the operating
system and speciﬁc services from the Nmap scan allows the attacker to be more precise in
his attack. For example, he wouldn’t run Linux tests on a Windows server. However, even
though the attack will be precise on his speciﬁc target, as with Nmap, the attacker will
launch multiple Nessus scans against the organization from multiple locations to create an
overload of events and alarms.
Figure 11.3 Results of Nmap and Nessus Scans (Source: Nmap and Nessus)
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
327
www.syngress.com

Figure 11.4 illustrates the ﬁndings from the Nessus scan. Based on the Nessus scan, the
attacker has discovered several avenues for exploitation. Some of the most glaring possibilities
are the fact that the attacker can enumerate a rich set of data points because port 445 is
open.This information arms the attacker with information such as local users, network
shares, services, and the password policy.Allowing SMB trafﬁc through a ﬁrewall is a signiﬁ-
cant issue in network security architecture because of the vast amounts of information that
can be retrieved, as you can see in Figure 11.4. In addition to information retrieval, this also
allows an opening for connecting and controlling the target asset.
Figure 11.4 Nessus Reporting Results (Source: Nessus)
The attacker doesn’t need to look any further at this point to decide on the ﬁrst set of
attacks.The user accounts are visible, so with the right set of credentials, the attacker can
connect to an SMB share such as IPC$.Also, based on the password policy, the attacker can
be aggressive with a brute force attack because he knows that the password policy is set not
to lock the account after any number of invalid login attempts.As an aside, in Windows
2000, account lockout duration is usually set at a value of between 1 and 999 failed logon
attempts. However, you can set it to 0, as in this case, which means the account will never be
locked out.
Before going into what the attacker does next, let’s look at the steps taken thus far
because they might be illustrated through ESM. Figure 11.5 shows several useful features for
discovering the signiﬁcant grains of sand in the desert. Features that allow the analyst to look
at information separated by business relevance are often a good place to start.A useful capa-
bility within enterprise-level ESM systems is visuals that are linked to one another and can

be nested; that is, the analyst can drill down from high-level to low-level details. In just a few
mouse clicks and a few seconds, an analyst could investigate from a high-level business dash-
board listing various business units such as manufacturing and ﬁnance to an operational net-
work diagram and a geographical dashboard. She could drill down further to servers,
networks, and security devices and ultimately to event-speciﬁc views.
Figure 11.5 Multidashboard View for Business Role, Compliance, Network
Topology, and Attacked Assets (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Attacks rarely happen in a vacuum; even if the attacker is not creating extraneous trafﬁc
to hide the attack, every day acceptable data ﬂows will still generate data. In the examples in
Figure 11.5, working from the top down, the attacker is targeting devices that serve various
business roles. Particularly alarming is that four of the targeted assets contain conﬁdential
data and all those assets are receiving “Very High” alert levels.The analyst can also see that
some of the attacks are targeting systems related to various levels of regulatory compliance,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the
Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB).Attacks on such systems will likely result in high-
priority alerts and remediation efforts.Also displayed is the network segment that seems to
be receiving the brunt of the attack. Contained within the network diagram are target assets
with relevant information such as IP address, host name, and related variables. Finally, a
simple graphic on the right notiﬁes even the most novice analyst that a revenue generation
system is under attack. Because the ESM system was seeded with asset-relevant information
such as compliance and business roles from an asset management system or even manually,
the detail that the analyst can extrapolate from the dashboards is far more valuable than pure

event information.The analyst can drill down into this information to discover supporting
information, as seen in Figure 11.6.
Figure 11.6 Geospatial Dashboard (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Figure 11.6 illustrates that the analyst can see the various networks under attack from a
geographical perspective. She can view attacks to determine whether an attack is speciﬁc to a
particular region or whether it is an organization-wide pandemic.The ﬁgure also shows
which areas tend to be getting hit the hardest and with what level of severity.
Another capability is to track events over time, as shown in Figure 11.7.
Figure 11.7 helps show that when breaking the event priorities into groups of time, it
becomes easier to see where the peaks in activity and severity are.Thus, low and slow attacks
as well as full-throttle attacks are equally simple to identify. By looking at the events from the
primary target on the top, we can see a very low number of security events followed by an
increasing set of events.These are the port scans and vulnerability tests peaking in the
middle, followed by a reduction in load toward the end.This is a typical port and vulnera-
bility scan illustration.

Figure 11.7 Time and Moving Average Dashboards (Source: ArcSight ESM
v4.0)
The graphic on the bottom represents statistical moving average data monitors.These
monitors take statistical samples of event data and show changes over time.The moving
average data monitor displays the moving average of events by a selected data ﬁeld.A moving
average allows for short-term ﬂuctuations to be removed and more correctly shows long-
term trends. Filters can be applied so that peaks and valleys that are attributed to legitimate
trafﬁc can be segregated from the other events that make up the dashboard.As an analyst
continues to operate the ESM system, event ﬂows will become increasingly familiar and it
will become easier to identify trafﬁc patters that represent the organization’s baseline or
normal trafﬁc.The more familiar the analysts become with their environment, the more spe-
cialized the ﬁlters and dashboards can become.
In this example, SMB trafﬁc has increased signiﬁcantly above the average.This is in par
with what we would expect from a Windows-speciﬁc vulnerability scan.The line represents
the moving average and the bars represent spikes against that average. Further, as with the
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
331

time sample at the top of Figure 11.7, the moving averages show a large increase in trafﬁc
where in all cases trafﬁc started at zero.This zero baseline start is quickly followed by an
increase, and then a decrease in event ﬂow closer to the end.The visual analytics help to
bring the in-memory correlation into a form of output that the analyst can easily and
quickly understand.And when she needs more information, she can see a detailed view,
which is called an active channel in some ESM systems (see Figure 11.8).
Figure 11.8 Active Channel and Event Drill-Down View (Source: ArcSight
ESM v4.0)
In the large active channel view on the left, the analyst is looking at the actual, normal-
ized event data from various products, including ISS, CheckPoint, Snort, and NFR. Even
though they are from different vendors, the normalized and categorized events can be dis-
played and correlated against each other. Some interesting points are that the target ports 135
and 445 are associated with the ESM system’s categorization tag, /Scan/Service.Thus, we
know somebody is actively examining these ports.At the bottom of Figure 11.8, a snippet of
one event is displayed.An ESM categorization is applied to the event, reading “An IDS
observed a scan of a host.” Further, it states that it is a service scan, the priority is 4, the
target port is 135, and the vendor that detected it is ISS.
In the upper right, working downward, the detailed view of an event is displayed.The
ﬁrst highlighted section is the threat calculation.The fact that all the ﬁelds, including pri-
ority, are set to 10 supports the point that this is a critical situation and a sensitive target.
www.syngress.com
332
Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

Note that even though the subevents may have a lower priority, such as 4, when events are
correlated and evaluated as a whole, a grander situational awareness is achieved.As such, the
overall priority may drop, or in this case, rise to the most critical level: 10.
Next, we see that the attacker’s IP address and global positioning system (GPS) mapping
show the source of the attack as coming from Manhattan Beach, California.At this point, the
analyst has a good idea of what is happening on the network from a business and a technical
level.The analyst evaluates the priorities and can focus her efforts on the most critical issues.
However, the attacker isn’t done: He still hasn’t launched his exploit or accomplished his pri-
mary goal of taking control of the target; to this point, he has simply been gathering infor-
mation at a level that is so aggressive and against such a critical system that he has set off
multiple priority 10 alarms.
In Figure 11.9, we go back to the attacker’s perspective.Armed with the information
gathered during his reconnaissance phase, the attacker launches an attack against the user
accounts discovered with Nessus by using a simple script and a dictionary of usernames and
passwords. Just to show how easy it is to do this, at the very top of Figure 11.9 is an example
of a one-line script that can be used with a for loop and can be run from the Microsoft
Windows XP command line.
Figure 11.9 Attack Script 
Here is a little background on the script in Figure 11.9.The For command is run
directly from the Windows XP command prompt. It calls two tokens from a text ﬁle called
Seed.txt.The text ﬁle contains a list of passwords that are tab-delimitated from a list of user-
names (gleaned from the Nessus results). Next, the script uses the Windows net use command
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
333

to try to connect to the target asset www.xyz-target.com on IPC$.The attacker chooses
IPC$ because he also knows from reconnaissance that the SMB ports are open.
The script runs through several permutations that generate an unknown username or
bad-password error. Finally, the command completes successfully at the bottom of Figure
11.9 using the mhart user account and using mhart again as the password.The attacker is well
aware that one of the most common passwords is actually a user’s username. Now that the
attacker has access to the target system, he can do a number of things. If it is a general user
account, he can try to escalate his privileges to those of an administrator. If it is an adminis-
trator account, he can do anything on the system.As long as the target operating system is
being monitored, actions at the operating system level will also create events that the ESM
system can process and correlate.
Figure 11.10 shows this attack from the analyst’s perspective. With the ESM system
looking at operating system events alone, we see multiple brute force logins within the active
channel. Regardless of whether these logins are across Windows systems, virtual private net-
works (VPNs), UNIX systems, or anything else somebody could brute force, most ESM sys-
tems will automatically categorize them. In this example, the categorization is to /Brute
Force/Login.
The correlation rule is ﬁred and, in this example, is identiﬁed by the lightning bolt for
the Brute Force rule.Although the single events each have a priority of 10, the correlated rule
has a priority of 7.Again, this is because the correlation rule event is considering the bigger
picture and must evaluate the priority against other events being processed and correlated that
may not be rendered in Figure 11.10. Still, a priority of 7 is high enough to take notice.

At this point, the analyst could respond by stopping the attack in real time, disable the
compromised mhart account, escalate the issue to the owner of the target asset, or follow a
predetermined organizational policy. We will cover various remediation actions in more
detail later in this chapter. However, before we get to remediation, we’ll step through some
of the ESM features highlighted in this scenario, including active channels and graphical
analysis tools.
Active Channels
ESM systems can provide many methods for monitoring events in real time. Some examples
include active channels, dashboards, and event graphs.A robust ESM solution will enable an
analyst to drill down on a particular event or series of events in order to investigate them in
greater detail. Figure 11.11 illustrates a general representation of event data in an active
channel.As with rules, ESM systems typically come with a series of stock active channels,
which provide a standard set of views, but they are extremely customizable because every
organization has different needs.To truly gain situational awareness, events are almost always
easier to comprehend as a visual. However, during any type of ESM investigation, it is always
valuable to be able to move from higher-level charts and visuals to the underling events
within active channels. Figure 11.11 shows just a few ﬁelds within each event.Although
most ESM systems will allow a double-click on any event to display the event details in their
entirety, it would be too much information to see on the screen at once with multiple
events.This is why an analyst may select a group of ﬁelds that he would like displayed. In
practice, many organizations will have multiple active channel views saved that allow them to
quickly investigate the data with predeﬁned channels as opposed to customizing them each
time.This particular channel shows the time of the event, the event name, the source of the
attack, the target of the attack, the target port, the target priority, the device vendor that
detected the attack (such as Cisco or ISS), and the product (such as Cisco Secure IDS or ISS
Site Protector).
At the top of the channel, a radar view is also displayed showing the start time and end
time of the events being investigated and any ﬁlters that are applied to render the view in a
more exacting format. For example, an analyst may want to limit the channel to speciﬁc
devices, attack priorities, geographies, event types, vendors, and so on. Finally, a breakdown of
the event priorities are displayed on the top right.There are a total of 2,529 events; here is
how they break down:
■
79 = Very High
■
533 = High
■
572 = Medium
■
1,254 = Low
■
91 = Very Low

Figure 11.11 Event Data in an Active Channel (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Chart Views 
Active channel views provide tremendous value by representing data in a grid. But some-
times more is needed. Often a view that is more graphical is a better place to start when
analyzing data. Chart views display a summary of events as an optional view instead of
looking at the traditional tabular grid. Most ESM systems offer a variety of possible charts,
such as line and area graphs, various bar and pie charts, and charts layered over background
images such as maps or network diagrams.
Figure 11.12 displays a small grid as well as all the charts and graphs through a single,
tiled view.These charts can be sorted and ﬁltered and many ESM systems can update them
in real time along with the active channel grid.This renders a very dynamic situational
awareness console for the analyst.
www.syngress.com
336
Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

Figure 11.12 Multiple Chart Types (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Figure 11.13 displays the same underlying content, but through charts layered over back-
ground images so that an analyst can get a geographical perspective of the events. For
instance, this chart shows that activity of various priority levels is occurring in the western
United States, northeastern Canada, and northern Asia. From this point, a double-click on
one of the charts may drill down into a regional map or even directly to a network diagram
or, possibly, events. ESM systems allow for layered drilldowns to support nesting of back-
ground images.
Dashboards
Beyond the more rudimentary active channels with charts, real-time dashboards can address
more complex, compound operations and can be thought of in their most traditional sense,
such as the instrument panel for an aircraft or automobile.As with these vehicles, where it is
difﬁcult to know what is going on inside a complex machine, dashboards allow complex
information to be displayed in a format that is quickly and easily understood. Real-time
dashboards themselves can be very similar to an active channel where information is dis-
played in a tabular grid consisting of key columns in which the analyst is interested. Or they
can be displayed graphically, as in charts and graphs that can summarize events, representing
them for particular assets, networks, geographies, and so forth.Another useful feature in dash-
boards is the capability in most ESM systems to monitor the ESM system itself, including
connectors, managers, and the status of ESM databases.

337

Figure 11.13 Charts Layered Over a Map (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
The example in Figure 11.14 shows several dashboards tiled together.As with rules and
active channels, most ESM vendors will supply stock dashboards.You can use these dash-
boards as is (as a template), or you can create new dashboards from scratch.Also as with rules
and active channels, the number of disparate dashboard types is limitless. Each dashboard is
independent and can be related to multiple rules, ﬁlters, and specialized criteria. Beyond the
various sorts and summarizations available in active channel charts, more complex operations
are available in dashboards. Figure 11.14 shows the following dashboards:
■
Top transport protocols The most common protocols the ESM system is
detecting
■
Top moving average ﬁelds Statistics on which moving averages are most active
■
Top target IPs Which systems are being attacked the most
■
Top categories Which ESM event categorizations are the most common
■
Recent ﬁred rules The most frequently ﬁred correlation rules
■
Recent events The most recent events, usually ﬁltered to look at a subset of the
data such as mission-critical devices, or perhaps a single subnet
■
Event counts by hour How busy the ESM system is in terms of processing
events every hour
■
Top attacker IPs Which systems seem to be attacking the organization most fre-
quently
Although the high-level information may be useful for bringing an incident more
clearly to an analyst’s attention, the real power again lies within the fact that most ESMs
allow an analyst to drill down through segments within a dashboard to display the under-
www.syngress.com
338
Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

lying content. For example, a pie chart may represent a critical situation. By focusing on the
section in question, the analyst can display only the relevant events associated with the inci-
dent.This greatly reduces the time needed for analysis and investigation.
Figure 11.14 Multiple Dashboards (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Event Graphs
Similar to dashboards, events graphs allow information to be displayed graphically. However,
event graphs are capable of displaying multinode data points, which makes it easier and more
intuitive for an analyst to understand groups of events and causal relationships where there
are attack patterns among various assets.
Essentially, event graphs render groups of events in a meaningful format, giving an ana-
lyst the ability to quickly visualize what has occurred. Because event graphs can work in real
time as well as in forensics investigations (which we will cover in the next chapter), they are
an extremely common utility for detecting attacks while they are occurring and investigating
an incident after the fact. Figure 11.15 is an example of a basic event graph.
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
339

Figure 11.15 Basic Event Graph 
Figure 11.15 illustrates from the left to the right the following potential case.An
attacker, the source node on the far left, executes an attack, represented by an event node, on
a target.The target in turn is compromised, and becomes the source of a new attack which
targets a new node.This would be common behavior for worm activity, for example.
Event graphs are most often found useful in practice when a large group of events are
visualized together. Consider Figure 11.16; by analyzing a large number of events through a
single event graph, certain patterns and clusters can be quickly identiﬁed, which would be
far harder to comprehend by simply looking at an active channel or even a dashboard. By
establishing event graph parameters that consider the analyst’s mission, such as monitoring a
subnet of mission-critical assets and excluding trafﬁc that may cause false positives (backup
utilities and polling network monitoring tools, for example), the graphical rendering of the
events can be very precise. It is also common practice for an analyst using an ESM event
graphing solution to have multiple event graphs in which each graph looks at speciﬁc
parameters in addition to a broader, global event graph that visualizes the network more
holistically.
Many ESM systems will also allow an analyst to use event graphs from an active channel
as a tool for investigation and analysis. For example, an analyst can use an event graph to
investigate events that target Web servers, as shown in Figure 11.17. In such a case, the event
graph is conﬁgured to show what events target Web servers, and on what destination port.
The circles represent the destination IPs, or Web servers.The white squares represent the
ports that remote systems are connecting to on the Web servers, including port 80 (HTTP)
and port 443 (HTTPS).The dark squares are the event names.The majority of the trafﬁc (as
represented by the size of the square) is standard Web trafﬁc; a smaller amount of trafﬁc
appears to be an attack coming from a suspicious source.

Figure 11.18 illustrates an event graph applied to a threat from within, such as from a
malicious insider.This event graph shows the dynamics of a brute force attack followed by
ﬁle manipulation on the compromised target. From the left to the right, and in sequential
order of events, the following actions transpired:

The malicious insider is the dark square on the far left; he launches an attack
against the four target servers in the third column, represented by the four squares.
2.
The second column shows the various actions that the attacker takes, as repre-
sented by the circles; the larger the circle the more events (volume) related to that
particular action:
a.
The top circle, which is also the most voluminous, shows the attacker unsuc-
cessfully trying to log on to the top three target servers as user.
b.
The middle circle shows a successful logon as user into the server represented
by the third square from the top.
c.
The last circle shows successful logons as administrator into all four target sys-
tems.
3.
The server that is experiencing the most event volume is the top square in the
third column; these events are from the brute force attack and the ﬁle manipula-
tion occurring on that server, depicted in the forth column.
4.
The other servers in the column are receiving descending volumes of trafﬁc; note
that although the second square has only two arrows leading into it and the third
has three, the volume of the events is not tied to the number of arrows, but rather
the number of events crossing those arrows.
5.
The forth column shows three different types of operating system-level changes
happening on the targeted server at the top of the third column:
a.
The ﬁrst action has to do with the attacker failing to access a ﬁle.
b.
The send action shows the attacker successfully changing a ﬁle’s attributes.
c.
The third and ﬁnal action shows the attacker successfully accessing a ﬁle.
Collectively, these actions help to provide empirical evidence regarding the malicious
insider’s actions.The insider started by attempting to compromise the servers.This led to
actually compromising a server. Finally, once the server was compromised, the insider manip-
ulated ﬁles on the server.

ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Thus far, we’ve looked at event processing by the ESM system, and tools that an analyst
can use for event analysis. However, two other important analysis characteristics are tightly
integrated within ESM event processing and analysis: workﬂow and remediation.
Workﬂow
An important variable in incident response is the ability to alert, escalate, track, and audit an
incident from beginning to end. It is imperative that because ESM is the core of the incident
detection framework, it also has workﬂow features that allow for the management of inci-
dents and the auditing of those incidents after the fact.The essence of the ESM workﬂow is
very particular, depending on the ESM vendor, and a detailed technical background isn’t
essential in order to fully understand the case studies. However, we will cover some high-
level portions here which address collaborative capabilities, case management, alerting, and
escalation.
One of the necessary features in workﬂow is the ability for several users to collaborate
and share information.This commonly occurs through an ESM-integrated case management
system, a third-party ticketing system such as Remedy, something built in-house, and so on.
The bottom line is that ﬁnding an incident is only part of the equation; managing and
resolving the incident are essential, and if you can do that through a central solution such as
ESM, operational efﬁciencies are increased.Also important is a level of oversight so that cases
can be examined and responses evaluated through an audit.These audits can help to discover
issues and render more effective responses in the future. It is common for audit reports to be
generated that display case information along with analyst statistics. We will cover these types
of reports in Chapter 12.

In addition to case management, simple annotation is also valuable. Not every event
requires that an entire case be generated. Many ESM users ﬁnd that simply being able to
quickly assign and/or comment on one or many events allows them to collaborate with
other members of the team more efﬁciently.This is analogous to IM chat versus e-mail. For
example, a junior security analyst may have questions about a particular group of events.
Instead of generating a case for them, he may desire to assign them to a more senior member
of the team or ﬂag them for further analysis.Annotation allows the analyst to quickly con-
duct these actions without the formality of a new case, and you can ﬁnd this capability in
most enterprise-level ESM systems. Each analyst might have a dedicated active channel dis-
playing events that have been assigned to him—again, much like a chat session.
For this process to be successful, the ESM system must support various users, groups,
escalation levels, and notiﬁcation formats. Most ESM systems will allow granular access con-
trols for users based on group membership.This allows for greater control regarding which
users get access to which events.This is particularly important when addressing insider
threats where access to sensitive information needs to be limited to a small group that is per-
forming the investigation.
Once users and groups are deﬁned, information can be more easily assigned and esca-
lated. Many organizations will have a tiered approach to security events, with the majority
being ﬁelded by a ﬁrst-level team and following an escalation process up through more
advanced analysts and perhaps even business managers. Obviously, not every issue demands
the attention of the CIO, but certain events, because of severity or sensitivity, need to be
escalated. Having an automated process for providing escalation to the correct users and
groups in a timely and consistent manner is paramount to an ESM system’s incident man-
agement effectiveness. Note, however, that practically speaking, there should be a number of
tiers between a ﬁrst-level analyst and a CIO to reduce the potential of causing extra work
related to false positives and to give the middle-tier analysts time to make sense of the issue
and put it into context before a member of the executive team is involved.
When an event occurs and the ﬁrst group or individual is made aware of it, or events are
being escalated to others, the ESM system should have the capability to perform various
notiﬁcations.A notiﬁcation may comprise a case that is automatically appended or a new
case that is generated. It could be a simple e-mail or a Short Message Service (SMS) mes-
sage. It may be an event, such as a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap
being sent to an alternative alerting mechanism. Some organizations with security operations
centers even have alerting tied to audio and video triggers such as buzzers and ﬂashing
lights. If an individual is alerted but doesn’t respond to the alert within a predetermined time
frame, alerts can then be escalated depending on the severity of the event. Perhaps a low-
level event warrants only an e-mail message, but if nobody is responding to it, it may eventu-
ally cause a page to a more senior person.Additionally, a highly critical event may generate a
case as well as notify the entire security team.All of these mechanisms working together lead
to a well-integrated incident response solution.Today many ESM systems take analysis work-
ﬂow a step further to address response from a tactical perspective in the form of network

remediation.As discussed in Chapter 9, a number of synergies exist at this level between
security and network operations.
Network Remediation
Automated tools for remediation have been around for many years.As time has progressed,
organizations have become increasingly aware of the need to not only protect sensitive data,
but also be able to respond to an incident rapidly.Although discovering an incident post-
mortem, which we will cover in the next chapter, is certainly helpful, stopping an incident is
almost always the gold standard.This section will expand upon the network response man-
ager (NRM) details that we covered in Chapter 9.
With organizational security switching the focus to protecting all critical assets as
opposed to simply protecting the stuff inside the ﬁrewalls from the folks outside, it is easy to
become overwhelmed. Organizations today are well aware of insider threats, identity thieves,
cyber criminals, espionage, and the like. But with so many angles to watch, new vulnerabili-
ties, new exploits, and the ﬂood of increasingly broader daily responsibilities (e.g., compli-
ance, risk, privacy, governance, and incident prevention, detection, and management), most
security teams are doing everything they can just to keep their heads above water, let alone
being able to actually stop an attack in near-real time. Fortunately, times have changed, and
although technology alone is never the sole solution, in this space it has matured to the point
where rapid remediation isn’t only interesting from a theoretical perspective, but also offers
real, practical, and usable capabilities.
Some remediation solutions are vendor-speciﬁc, allowing remediation only within their
own product family. Because most organizations have heterogeneous environments, this is
rarely a desirable solution.
Other remediation solutions work in a synergistic manner with broader security man-
agement solutions. ESM solutions, for example, provide incident detection capabilities, but
most offer only limited features in the form of comprehensive network response. However,
ESM is complementary to network remediation solutions. In fact, many remediation solu-
tions depend on the capabilities of an ESM system to make a decision or prompt a security
analyst to decide whether remediation is necessary.The remediation solution simply becomes
an extension of the ESM solution.
History has shown us that reactive, manual responses can be more complex, costly, slow,
and ineffective.Additionally, following a response, the essential task of documenting what was
done is sometimes overlooked.This makes postmortem reviews, change rollbacks, and the
process of addressing future events more difﬁcult to manage. Most organizations also require
change management procedures to be followed, even for an incident that requires rapid
response. If this step is also manual, valuable time will be lost between the detection and
remediation of an incident.
Following are four case studies that we will explore to help illustrate some practical uses
for network remediation which tie ESM and NRM solutions together. Each case will refer-
ence the corresponding numbers within Figure 11.19.

Figure 11.19 Network Remediation Scenarios
Case 1
In the ﬁrst case, malware is detected on a user’s laptop. Perhaps the user took the laptop
home, and while connected to the Internet he accidentally exposed it to malware which
proceeded to install itself on the laptop.The user isn’t doing anything intentionally malicious,
but nonetheless, his laptop is carrying malicious malware and when he physically enters the
organization and plugs in the laptop, the malware will be capable of infecting other assets
within the organization’s network.This malware could be detected in a number of ways:
■
The organization may scan every system that attaches to the network to determine
whether it meets minimum requirements such as antivirus, operating system, and
application patches as well as personal ﬁrewalls and other relevant parameters. If so,
and if any of these parameters are out-of-date, the systems may be excluded from
participating in the network.Although this is interesting conceptually, it is still a
fairly uncommon solution at the time of this writing.
■
Another option might be that after being connected to the network for a few
minutes, the malware may have attempted to propagate, thus generating alerts. Let’s
consider this example.
Regardless of the how the malware was detected, an event collection and analysis solu-
tion such as an ESM system might be used as the central mechanism to process the informa-
tion and, based on predetermined policies, instruct the remediation tools to respond. Because
of the integrated workﬂow, analysis, and response capabilities, ESM systems are well suited
for the role.

Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

The actual response may be automatic; with or without human intervention. It may
require a network analyst to approve the change, or most likely, it would require an approval
process that could be a series of automated notiﬁcations and approvals such as e-mails and
responses from individuals in the escalation chain.These responses could then trigger the
actual remediation while keeping in accordance with change management procedures and
still allowing an efﬁcient response.
From the perspective of the unwitting user, he simply notices that his laptop isn’t
working in cubicle one, so he tries cubicle two, and then three. Some response solutions
focus only on disabling a switch port; if that is the response to this action, it would have to
happen every time the user moves to a different cubicle.This is not a very elegant solution.
Alternatively, a better solution based on this scenario would be a Media Access Control
(MAC) address ﬁlter, blocking the laptop at layer 2 regardless of where it plugs in.Also, the
logical network connection could be automatically moved, positioning the laptop on a quar-
antined virtual local area network (VLAN) and redirecting that user/laptop to a scanning
and cleaning solution before it can be moved back onto the desired network.
Having ESM at the core of this scenario provides the needed incident detection, man-
agement, workﬂow, and network remediation capabilities needed to quickly and effectively
mitigate the threat.The extensibility of ESM solutions allows integration with the malware
detection systems and response solutions needed to offer a truly centralized threat manage-
ment capability for this scenario.
Case 2
The second case illustrates another example of the value of MAC ﬁltering. Here we have a
device/user that appears to be generating suspicious events. It isn’t something the AV scan-
ners or policy checkers detected, but the trafﬁc appears to represent anomalies that are con-
sistent with malicious activity based on the determination of the ESM system. Maybe it’s an
attack, a zero-day exploit, a worm, or perhaps simply a false positive.Turning vast amounts of
seemingly unrelated and benign data into actionable information is one of the areas within
incident detection that is virtually impossible without the assistance of an ESM solution to
correlate all the various events.
MAC ﬁlters can be extremely beneﬁcial when multiple endpoints are connected to the
same switch port. Consider a lab with several servers connected to a hub which is up-linked
to a single physical port on a switch. Disabling the port on the switch disables all the servers
connected to the hub from communicating over that network connection. Voice over IP
(VoIP) networks are another example of this type of connectivity. Some VoIP networks work
by having a user’s workstation connected directly to the IP phone which, in turn, is the
actual device connected to the switch, as illustrated in Figure 11.19.
During a suspicious incident, and based on organizational policies, the last thing that an
organization may want to do is disable the switch port because it disables not only the work-
station’s network connectivity, but also the phone. Instead, managers may want to conﬁgure
the remediation solution to implement a MAC ﬁlter at managers switch port, thus disabling
www.syngress.com
Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response • Chapter 11
347

the connectivity for the workstation but still allowing the user to communicate via phone to
investigate why his access has been disabled.
Once the events are detected by any number of point solutions and the ESM system
correlates them, the ESM system will likely generate a case and alert the appropriate individ-
uals about the incident. Using the tools outlined in this chapter, such as event visualization
and correlation, the analysts can determine whether the events are actually malicious. If they
are, without having to switch to yet another system, the analysts can leverage integration
with the network response manager.As discussed in Chapter 9, this might actually mean that
the security team needs to escalate the event to the network operations team, virtually test
the change without actually impacting the production environment, and ﬁnally allow the
network operations team to actually render the real change if they feel it is warranted.
Regardless of the escalation and approval process, and which group has permissions to make
the actual changes, the integrated nature of ESM and NRM will enhance the process.
Case 3
In the third case, a remote user enters the mix.Although he is a legitimate user, he appears
to be trying to access sensitive systems and conducting large ﬁle downloads as detected by
various operating system and application events. Some of these actions break organizational
policy for remote access and, as such, send up red ﬂags.
For remote users, remediation tools can terminate the session at the access point,
whether it’s a wireless controller or a VPN, for example.Additionally, the remediation tools
can communicate directly with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) system
such as Active Directory and disable that user on the directory server or on the remote con-
nectivity point itself.This is an extremely useful feature because a user could always try to
reinitialize a terminated session and regain access to the network if his accounts are still
enabled.Thus, terminating the session at the access point and disabling the user on the direc-
tory server are both necessary to stop the live session and future connection attempts.
Although not illustrated in Figure 11.19, should a common authentication mechanism
such as Active Directory be used to authenticate both physical and logical access, the user’s
physical access to the organization’s facilities could also be revoked, increasing efﬁciencies in
deprovisioning.
As with the other cases, all the events are central to the ESM system.Analysis and inves-
tigation of the various events associated with the remote user are analyzed. Upon the dis-
covery of unusual activity based on the ESM system’s automatic correlation and/or through
analyst-driven investigation, a decision can be made regarding what, if any, remediation
efforts should be taken. Enterprise-level network response solutions generally have the
extensibility to work beyond switches and routers and can extend their reach to VPNs, wire-
less access points, and other points of perimeter entry.Also, as in this case, the Active
Directory system is altered so that not only is the session terminated, but also the user will
not be able to log on again because his access privileges within LDAP have been revoked.

Chapter 11 • Real-Time Event Correlation, Analysis, and Response

Much like ESM solutions, most NRMs can do this independent of vendor, product, ver-
sion, and the like. Unlike the ﬁrst two cases—which dealt with internal users—this external
scenario shows that an ESM/NRM combination can move well beyond core routing and
switching capabilities to the multitude of perimeter access points and directory systems.
Case 4
In this fourth and ﬁnal case, an external attacker is attempting to gain access to the organiza-
tion’s network. Unlike the third case, this isn’t a legitimate user breaking policy, but an actual
external attack.The possible solutions are limited to blocking and resetting connections.The
remediation solution can communicate natively with the preventive controls, such as net-
work devices, ﬁrewalls, and IPS devices, to initiate connection resets on those systems or
make rule/access control list (ACL) changes. Because the attacker is coming from the
Internet, the best solution is to reset the active session and block the attack at the outermost
ingress, which in this case would be ACL changes on the border router.
For an attack such as this, time to respond may be very limited. Based on organizational
policies and other risk factors, it might be determined that should the ESM system detect
such an event, an automated alert should be sent to the NRM solution for automatic
response.At one time, making automated responses was fraught with error.This was typically
when there was heavy reliance on the output of a single point device, such as an IDS, with
no supporting data. With ESM solutions, correlating a vast number of devices, event types,
vulnerability information, asset information, and the like means these decisions can be made
with much better supporting information.This equates to better risk management.
Depending on other factors within the organization’s risk posture, such as who is doing
the attacking, what is being attacked, and other relevant issues, a conservative stance may be
to escalate the issue to an analyst.This analyst can, in turn, decide to press the “big red
button” on the NRM solution. However, a more aggressive posture may be to have a com-
pletely automated response structure for cases in which the risk of being compromised is
greater than the repercussions of making a mistake and terminating a valid session.
Although an automated response is still the exception, not the rule, it is becoming more
popular.This is especially the case when organizations either lack the resources to be more
conservative or have integrated their ESM and NRM solutions so well within their business
processes that it makes business sense. For the most mission-critical and sensitive assets, auto-
mated responses are beginning to move into the production environment for a larger
number of organizations.
Conclusion
This chapter outlined a number of ESM capabilities that are used for real-time event anal-
ysis. Some of these capabilities included assigning levels of risk to events, correlation capabili-
ties, and how a combination of automated correlation and analyst-driven analysis with visuals
can more quickly yield results. Other areas that we covered include incident workﬂow,

349

including alerting, escalation, and cases. Finally, we addressed the issue of response with
NRM solutions integrated with an ESM system.
Together, this combination of real-time event correlation, analysis, and response creates a
powerful security capability for managing risk.Although organizations have invested a great
deal of time, money, and resources into point solutions, they may not be fully leveraging the
inherent capabilities in the assets they already own if event information isn’t being processed
and made available for efﬁcient and effective analysis. Not only does this provide a more pos-
itive risk posture, but it also helps to generate a better return on investment in the solutions
that already exist within an organization’s environment.As organizations continue to strive to
do more with less, deploying ESM at the core of an event collection and analysis architecture
and integrating network remediation capabilities will help to reach those goals.
The next chapter will move from real-time analysis to forensics analysis. No one capa-
bility is more essential than the other.As such, many ESM solutions will provide trans-
parency between real-time investigation capabilities, as discussed in this chapter, and forensics
analysis, as covered in Chapter 12. Many of the same tools and techniques apply across both
disciplines; however, some ESM systems offer a few additional capabilities which are better
suited for looking at historic information stored within the ESM system’s database as
opposed to real-time events.

Introduction
This is the ﬁnal chapter on Enterprise Security Management (ESM) fundamentals.This
chapter will focus on analysis from a forensics perspective; we will cover use cases in the next
chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, we deﬁne forensics as analysis that is done on infor-
mation that is not ﬂowing to the ESM in real-time; that is, information that is being read
from a database of stored events.These are important capabilities because security is neither a
real-time nor a forensics-speciﬁc endeavor; both forms of analysis must be available. Most
ESM solutions will allow the same analysis functionality regardless of whether the events are
being analyzed in real-time over the network, or forensically from a database. However, the
mechanics are somewhat different and because of this difference, it requires a dedicated
chapter with extra explanation regarding how information can be stored for later retrieval.As
discussed earlier, real-time event analysis through ESM will typically take place in memory.
In contrast, forensics analysis will depend on a supporting database where the events are
stored on hard drives or even backed up to removable media such as DVDs or digital linear
tape (DLT). In addition to covering data storage fundamentals, as with the previous chapters,
we will use scenarios to illustrate the key points.Among these points are reporting capabili-
ties and investigation techniques.
Event Storage
Although real-time analysis is absolutely essential, the value of forensic analysis should not be
overlooked. Often, a logical next step in an investigation process when something is discov-
ered in real-time is to review forensics data for supporting evidence.Therefore, event data
must be stored in a manner that allows for timely and accurate analysis.
Consider the following example. It is discovered that a malicious insider has been
stealing source code and sending it to a competitor.Although the events were captured in
real-time, they don’t tell the analyst what else this insider may have been doing, how long it
has been going on, or who else may be involved in this type of activity.At this point in the
investigation, it makes intuitive sense to begin investigating these questions by applying the
same level of correlation and analysis to the forensically stored events.
ESMs can use a variety of databases; however, most use enterprise-level databases such as
Oracle Enterprise.They do this in order to take advantage of some of the more advanced
features offered by these types of databases, such as partition management, high availability,
and, of course, their proven capability to process thousands of events per second.Another
value point is simply having staff that are familiar with the database product and ensuring
that there is adequate support for the investment.
Although ESM vendors strive to minimize the need for database administrators, certain
tasks are involved in system upgrades and advanced conﬁguration parameters that sometimes
require a person with database expertise. However, for the normal operation of an ESM, a
dedicated DBA is not required but may occasionally be needed. Because ESM is most com-
www.syngress.com
352
Chapter 12 • Event Storage and Forensic Analysis

monly used in large businesses and government organizations that tend to already have
databases such as Oracle in-house, this helps to make the supportability of the backend
database infrastructure that much easier.
For data management, backups, and data restoration, many ESM solutions will divide the
stored events into logical segments such as 24-hour partitions.This allows for an easy-to-
follow, segmented backup strategy.This is, of course, highly customizable because every orga-
nization will have different data retention policies and regulations to follow. Even though
data retention depends on many factors, most organizations will evaluate some key areas to
deﬁne their strategy.Are there any existing policies on data retention? If data is backed up
with the current solution, how long will it take to get it back online so that it can be ana-
lyzed? Are facilities in place to store the backups locally or remotely? Other organizations
may just follow retention requirements outlined by speciﬁc forms of regulatory compliance.
For example:
■
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires seven years.
■
Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires one year.
■
The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) requires six years.
■
The European Union DR Directive requires two years.
■
Basel II requires seven years.
■
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
requires six/seven years.
■
FISMA requires three years.
It would be costly in virtually any situation to retain your entire database containing
many years of events on hard drives, even with compression and disk optimization techniques.
So if the desire is to have 30 days of online data or a year, or to retain ﬁve years of
ofﬂine data or perhaps retain data indeﬁnitely, the ESM and its supporting database should
be able to offer that level of ﬂexibility. With a good backup procedure, organizations should
be able to leverage less-expensive ofﬂine media as long as the ESM manager can quickly
remount and access it, instead of having to invest in larger storage arrays.This greatly reduces
the total cost of ownership associated with large data stores without having a dramatic
impact on operational efﬁciencies.
Regardless of the data being stored ofﬂine or online, ESMs will utilize compression and
indexing techniques to save space and reduce search times, respectively. Because the data
normalization process discussed earlier applies to data in storage as well, you can run com-
plex queries that go well beyond the most common ﬁelds, such as time, source, and destina-
tion.You can greatly enhance searches by customizing indexing parameters. In this way, you
can tailor an indexing solution to an organization’s particular needs without eroding valuable
storage with indexes that are rarely used.This again is a testament to some of the advantages
of using an enterprise-grade database solution.

Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
353

Another feature in the data storage that ESMs commonly offer is hashing of the database
partitions to ensure that a tape loaded from several years ago has content that matches what
was backed up. High-availability offerings such as Oracle’s RAC can also be employed to
support robust architectures where availability is essential.And database vendors such as
Oracle offer countless tools and utilities to assist in optimizing the database solution.
The net beneﬁt of the ESM data storage architecture is that it is a highly scalable, reli-
able, and ﬂexible design that you can customize for both speed and storage cost reduction.
But what does this mean from a security analyst’s perspective? Well, in addition to the ESM
capabilities covered in the previous chapters that apply to real-time analysis, a number of
capabilities are associated with reporting and discovery techniques that we will now cover
which can be applied to forensics data.
Reporting
When it comes to communicating risk to management, few tools are as valuable as reports.
You can leverage reports in operations for researching certain types of events, especially com-
plex relationships that may not be intuitive through other mechanisms. We will cover these
examples in more detail a bit later in the chapter.
ESMs usually provide a wide range of stock reports, but the real value is in the analyst’s
ability to create her own custom reports based on organizational requirements or to assist in
forensic analysis.You generally can create reports in a number of formats, such as Microsoft
Word and Excel, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Portable Document Format (PDF),
comma separated values (CSV), and so on. In addition to supporting multiple report formats,
ESMs can schedule automated reports, archive reports, and make them available for non-
ESM users through access-controlled mechanisms such as a Web interface.The idea is to take
potentially complex technical information, reduce it to just those ﬁelds needed, and present
it to diverse audiences so that it can be more easily and quickly understood.
The following examples illustrate reporting output for various scenarios. Figure 12.1 is a
mockup that represents report output in a simple tabular form. Perhaps the analyst is inter-
ested in creating a report on failed logins against all systems within her network that happen
to be relevant to SOX. Within the ESM, she can pick and choose the parameters that she
would like displayed, and in which order. Each column represents normalized events and
each square is a parameter within that event.As illustrated, from left to right, the ﬁelds are as
follows:
■
Start Date and Time When did the event or events begin?
■
End Date and Time When did the event or events end?
■
Application What application generated the event?
■
Outcome What was the outcome of the login? This report is speciﬁc to failures.
■
Count How many times were the events identical, excluding time?

■
Event What is the event name, based on ESM categorization?
■
UserID What account User ID was used for the failed logins?
■
Target Address On which systems did the failed logins occur?
■
Compliance Which form of regulatory compliance is relevant for these systems?
Because SOX was one of the report criteria, all events are associated with it.
Figure 12.1 Tabular Report
This information is easier to understand in the format shown in Figure 12.1 as opposed
to just looking at logs, because of several reasons:
■
The source devices are different products and log formats, making it hard to corre-
late and even analyze easily.
■
The data will likely reside on disparate systems without any central analysis capa-
bility.
■
There would be no way to search across the various devices, or perform advanced
correlation, anomaly detection, or pattern discovery, without normalized ﬁelds.
www.syngress.com
Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
355

■
You can run the reports vendor-agnostically, ensuring that you capture all relevant
data, not just data from a subset of systems.
■
You can design the reports to display only the ﬁelds that you are interested in.
Because a single event may have 100 or more ﬁelds, it’s important to minimize the
data overload in order to focus on just the ﬁelds that are deemed critical for a spe-
ciﬁc report.
■
You can apply averages, sums, counts, and various mathematical expressions to the
information.
Figure 12.2 is a mockup that shows the number of attacks targeting speciﬁc mission-
critical systems. Very high-level reports such as this are useful for illustrating security events
to nontechnical individuals. Clearly a much larger volume of attacks is hitting the SAN
Firewall and Finance Firewall, which are shown as the highest bars on the chart, with 47 and
50 hits, respectively.This is compared to the Financial Database, which is shown as the lowest
bar on the chart, with only three hits.This is a typical outcome because an analyst would
expect a preventive control such as a ﬁrewall to receive the brunt of most attacks, while the
devices it is protecting suffer from far less exposure to malicious activity.

and time, and even a watermark.This represents the type of report a manager may want to
see every day to get a general idea of the state of incident management within the team.This
particular report evaluates the status of cases including their state, time to resolution, opera-
tional impact, and even time to resolution by user.This report can relay information to a
team leader or manager about the efﬁciencies of the group.They can get a feel for the criti-
cality of cases and what the business relevance is. Just because there are hundreds of cases, it
isn’t necessarily true that all or any of them are critical or pose any signiﬁcant business
impact. Just as the overall group can be evaluated, the same metrics can be applied to the
actual analysts.This allows for both a holistic (team) and speciﬁc (user) perspective for evalu-
ating incident resolution capabilities. It can also be helpful in determining whether more
analysts are needed or more training is required.

In the report in Figure 12.4, a simple 2D pie chart is used to illustrate the volume of
attacks by type. For example, only one event falls under the category Zero Day Worm
Outbreak Detected, but 14 events fall under the category Suspicious Activity—Packet
Manipulation.This report shows how many times a speciﬁc event occurred in relation to
other events. What’s especially nice about the report is that the events have been normalized
and categorized.The normalization helps because multiple, disparate systems are being evalu-
ated for each slice of the pie chart, but the events have also been made more generalized
through the categorization.This allows for fewer pie slices by combining like events into
common categories, such as Attack Blocked and Dropped at FW, which could be from any
number of ﬁrewall vendors and versions.
Figure 12.4 2D Pie Chart Report
You also can create reports to show deltas and trends over time. For example, a security
manager may want to see weekly reports illustrating the organization’s security posture and
containing aggregated counts from other reports at a high level. Within the report, the man-
ager may want to chart the aggregate of assets that have been targeted with high-level secu-
rity events on a quarterly basis. Each attack report is layered over reports from previous
weeks; thus, trends will begin to appear. In this way, the report will show the changes over
time and perhaps even help highlight where additional security resources need to be
deployed, or where new security countermeasures have proven to be effective. It is basically
analogous to looking at lots of reports on transparencies and laying them atop each other to
ﬁnd trends.

Figure 12.5 Trends Report: Line Graph
The report in Figure 12.5 is a mockup that represents a trend report.This report covers
events over the course of four quarters and shows that attacks against critical servers have
dropped signiﬁcantly.Attacks on critical network devices increased between the ﬁrst and
second quarters, but then dropped during the third and forth quarters.Attacks on critical
physical access points dropped between the ﬁrst and second quarters, grew sharply in the
third quarter, and were almost zero in the fourth quarter. Finally, attacks against the DMZ
continued to drop at a gradual pace between the ﬁrst and fourth quarters.
Reporting is one of those subjects that can require an entire book, but this level of
understanding is sufﬁcient for supplying background for the use cases starting in the next
chapter. However, before we get into the next chapter, we will discuss two other features that
are particularly valuable for forensic analysis.They have to do with the discovery of patterns
and being able to interact with patterns.These are more advanced features that are found in
only a few ESMs.
www.syngress.com
Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
359

Discovering and 
Interacting with Patterns
Scientists look for things they’ve been trained to see; computer scientists are no different.
Therefore, valuable information could be overlooked. Some ESM solutions provide capabili-
ties to address this issue above and beyond the correlation and anomaly detection features
discussed in the preceding chapter.
These features are sometimes called pattern discovery features, and they are designed to
identify patterns among events that an analyst may not have been speciﬁcally looking for. In
addition to reviewing data in search of potentially interesting patterns, once those patterns
are discovered, they can often be turned into real-time correlation rules that will then apply
to the detection capabilities to real-time event ﬂows.An analyst may desire to run a pattern
discovery sweep across an hour, day, month, or more of historic data in search of patterns.An
example of a basic pattern may be a single source address failing to log in to multiple servers,
or several repeated failures followed by a successful event.
In addition to pattern discovery is the feature sometimes called interactive discovery.
Interactive discovery is analogous to a report that you can run against forensics events just
like the reports discussed earlier. However, these reports are dynamic and allow an analyst or
even a nontechnical individual to review and manipulate the data. Events can be displayed in
various graphical representations, sections can be highlighted, and most important, the output
can be easily shared and reviewed among various individuals performing an investigation.
Interactive discovery reports are particularly valuable when researching an incident where
security analysts must work with managers, legal departments, and human resources (HR)
departments in order to address a problem, such as a malicious insider.
As with many topics within this section of the book, the greatest sense of understanding
is derived from examples. We’ll start with pattern discovery techniques.
Pattern Discovery
Consider a malicious insider that is attempting to break into multiple databases within an
organization’s network infrastructure.Assume that the insider has legitimate user access to a
database system, but his desire is to obtain root/administrator access and then leverage that
access to get the DBA’s account.
Based on the illustration in Figure 12.6, several steps occur. First, because the insider has
legitimate access to one of the target databases, he uses Secure Shell (SSH) to access the
database server, which is shown on the top. Once he has achieved access to the database
server, the insider creates a hidden directory within /tmp and copies over source code for
the exploit.This is shown in the middle and the actual copied ﬁles are shown on the bot-
tommost image.

360
Chapter 12 • Event Storage and Forensic Analysis

Figure 12.6 UNIX Shell Commands
Next, the insider compiles the exploit code using a gcc compiler on the database. Figure
12.7 illustrates an excerpt from the code.
Figure 12.7 Exploit Code
Now that the exploit code is compiled, the insider executes it. In this example, the
exploit code takes advantage of a vulnerability in Sendmail. In Figure 12.8, the exploit code
is run against the local mail system.
Figure 12.8 Code Execution

Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12

The result of the exploit is the creation of a new account with a user ID of 0 (i.e., root
or superuser), associated with the username “owner” at the very bottom of the image. Both
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are modiﬁed with the owner account, as seen at the bottom of
Figures 12.9 and 12.10, respectively.
Figure 12.9 UNIX Password File
Figure 12.10 UNIX Shadow File
In Figure 12.11, the insider simply switches to the new owner account by using the su
command.
www.syngress.com
362
Chapter 12 • Event Storage and Forensic Analysis

Figure 12.11 UNIX su Command Executed
At this point, the insider has superuser privileges on the local database, but he still
doesn’t have DBA privileges for the database application.The best way for him to capture
the DBA’s credentials is to install a keylogger.Although many keyloggers operate only by
reading access from physically connected keyboards, some can actually capture all remote ses-
sions.An example of such a keylogger is THC-vlogger. Because the user has administrative
access on the system, he simply installs THC-vlogger and waits for the DBA to log in. Once
this occurs, the insider will have the DBA’s database credentials.
Now that he has captured the DBA’s credentials, the insider can manipulate the
database.Assuming that his desire is to steal information, the insider may run a few simple
SQL commands to copy the information, as follows:
Select username from dba_users;
Select owner, table_name from dba_tables;
Spool data.txt;
Select * from custom.customers;
Select * from custom.ﬁnancials;
Armed with a proven mechanism for stealing database information the insider can now
target other databases within the network.
So now that we’ve seen what these events may look like from the insider’s perspective,
let’s take a look at things from the perspective of the security analyst doing the investigation.
As mentioned earlier, the features available for real-time analysis are also available for forensic
analysis with most ESM solutions.Thus, you can display the events in a simple tabular format
that shows the events which various systems generate. Note that as with most insider sce-
narios, no network-based intrusion detection system events or ﬁrewall events are sounding
alarms. We will derive most of the context from system and application logs. Figure 12.12
illustrates how these events may look in tabular format.
www.syngress.com
Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
363

Figure 12.12 Tabular Active Channel
Note that Figure 12.12 shows logs from the UNIX operating system, the Oracle
database, and Tripwire for ﬁle integrity checking. More speciﬁcally, reading the logs from the
bottom up, we can see the following events occurring:
■
Accepted password; mail exploit discovered
■
Exploit executed; passwd and shadow updated
■
su to owner
■
Access Oracle
■
Execute SQL select commands
Figure 12.12 is fairly straightforward. However, these events happen over an extended
period. Consider the gap in waiting for the DBA to log in, which may be hours or even
days. Because of this gap in time, it may be hard to get to the point where displaying such a
concise list of events could be rendered practically because millions of other events could be
within the mix.This is where pattern discovery helps out signiﬁcantly. Because you can run
a pattern discovery query across large windows of time and it can distinguish suspicious pat-
terns irrespective of that time window or of other unrelated events, it is the perfect tool for
visualizing subtle events such as those in this attack. Figure 12.13 is a mockup that illustrates
how a pattern could be formed. We are using a nonsecurity example to more simply explain
the concept.
Figure 12.13 looks at the purchasing habits for patrons of Bob’s Grocery between 11:00
P.M. and midnight. We have ﬁltered the data to be applicable to only a one-hour time slice
and only for those customers who purchased some form of vanilla ice cream. In addition to
the ice cream, we broke the groups of customers into three categories.
www.syngress.com
364
Chapter 12 • Event Storage and Forensic Analysis

Figure 12.13 Late-Night Ice Cream Purchasing Pattern
The ﬁrst category, consisting of bananas, hot fudge, cherries, and nuts, represents the
banana split pattern. Out of all the people purchasing ice cream, 10 of them also purchased
bananas. Of those that purchased ice cream and bananas, six purchased hot fudge. Excluding
one person, everyone that purchased hot fudge also bought cherries; nuts accounted for only
three purchases.
The second category is the root beer ﬂoat pattern.This group consisted of only four
individuals; only one also purchased straws.
The third and ﬁnal category is the ice cream cone group.This was the largest group,
with 15 customers. However, this group tended to limit their purchase to just ice cream and
cones and nothing else.
From a retail perspective, these patterns may help Bob the grocer with his product
placement. Maybe he should place the nuts closer to the ice cream to increase sales, or per-
haps he should sell root beer and straws as a set. From a security perspective, patterned events
could help illustrate unusual behavior, behavior that doesn’t seem malicious when a partic-
ular event is analyzed but does seem malicious when the whole scenario is analyzed, much
like the insider compromising the database and stealing information. Figure 12.14 uses for a
security example the same pattern format that we used for the ice cream example.
Let’s consider a scenario where Sam, a senior system administrator, is a disgruntled
employee that calls his employer on Monday morning and announces that he is quitting
because he feels under-compensated and he has decided to work for a competitor.As part of
the paperwork for HR to complete his termination process, the security team runs a report
of his comings and goings from the ofﬁce building based on a physical access control system
that tracks badge entries and exits. While conducting the investigation, they notice that he
had entered the building on Sunday evening.
www.syngress.com
Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
365

Figure 12.14 Malicious Insider Pattern
They decide to run pattern discovery tools on data related to Sam to see what he might
have done after he was in the building.The security team runs pattern discovery tools against
the forensics data within the ESM by applying appropriate time windows and ﬁlters to
ensure that the pattern will remain within their scope and focused on Sam.They focus on
any parameters that relate to Sam, such as his physical access identiﬁcation, login IDs for
servers, and even events on his workstation.
The ﬁrst pattern that the security team discovers shows Sam accessing a Linux server via
SSH. Next, he copies ﬁles from the server to his workstation via Secure Copy Protocol
(SCP). Finally, he becomes root and attempts to cover his tracks by deleting logﬁles.
Unfortunately for Sam, every move he made created an event that was sent to the ESM in
real-time, including the deleting of logﬁles which, in addition to being on the Linux server,
were automatically sent to the ESM, to which he did not have access. By checking the
ESM’s asset database, the team concludes that this server housed source code for a develop-
ment project for a new product, and the ﬁles that Sam copied were in fact from that project
and considered conﬁdential.
The second pattern shows what Sam did with the ﬁles once they were on his worksta-
tion. Because all workstations were monitored, and connecting peripherals such as a
Universal Serial Bus (USB) key fob on a Windows machine creates a log, that information
was captured.Also, any ﬁles that were moved to that USB device generated events, including
the ﬁlename, and they were also captured. It was clear that Sam had connected his USB
device, moved the source code from his workstation to that USB device, and removed the
USB device.
www.syngress.com
366
Chapter 12 • Event Storage and Forensic Analysis

Finally, directly after he completed the ﬁle move and disconnected, Sam exited the
building.The pattern did not contain the badge-in because the team ran the pattern dis-
covery on all post-entry events; thus, this was not within the scope for the data analysis.
Because Sam was a system administrator, even the deletion of system logs may not have
generated any red ﬂags, let alone using a USB device or coming in on weekends. However,
when looking at the patterns holistically, and given the circumstances, it seems probable that
Sam stole the source code which would now be in the hands of his former employer’s com-
petitor.
With the insider database attack, the events seem equally unimportant individually.
However, looking at them as a whole makes for a descriptive and intuitive pattern and
visual. Figure 12.15 illustrates the pattern of events.
Figure 12.15 Pattern of the Insider’s Database Attack
Figure 12.15 shows the various steps the insider took to gain root on the UNIX server.
It also shows the steps the insider took to access the database and steal the information. Each
group of patterns is separate, but they can also be used as a whole. Because the insider may
decide to use this successful sequence of events to access other systems, the two individual
patterns come together to form a superset for repeat events. In addition to using patterns for
analysis, you can also use interactive discovery techniques, and have the additional ability to
render nontechnical, user-friendly output that groups such as HR, legal, and senior manage-
ment can utilize when the security team needs supporting collateral for communicating risk.

Interactive Discovery
By facilitating a framework for the analyst to explore, share, and better understand data,
interactive discovery techniques will round out the ﬁnal ESM features covered in this text.
Interactive discovery allows you to display a set of events in multiple formats, thus enabling
anyone viewing the output to render it in a format that he is most comfortable with.
Additionally, certain graphics allow for identiﬁcation of certain types of events more easily
than others. For example, an analyst may render data in a scatter plot output in order to
identify outliers as opposed to a bar chart that may be better for comparing event volumes
from disparate sources. Consider the following examples.
Figure 12.16 uses a 3D bar chart to illustrate the aggregated event counts against the
event name categorization and the event outcome categorization.This particular graph
shows that “information warning” and “informational” event name categories of category
outcome type “success” are the most prevalent among the rest of the event sample.
One of the beneﬁts of a 3D versus a 2D graph is that the 3D graph allows you to use an
additional set of parameters. For example, knowing the aggregated event counts for speciﬁc
event categories is valuable. However, additionally knowing what the outcome was for each
event category is even more important.The 3D graph also tells us whether a category of
events such as a compromise was simply attempted, failed, or successful.Those attacks that
were successful would, of course, be where an analyst would want to focus her time.This
becomes clear using a 3D graph, but may not be as apparent with other output.

Figure 12.17 takes the same set of events and plots them against a map and globe to
illustrate the events geospatially.This can be helpful for global organizations that are inter-
ested in seeing event volumes and event severities across their entire organization.The map
shows large amounts of trafﬁc in the western United States and the United Kingdom.This is
a nice, high-level view to have to simply get a feel for event load and event severity.You can
apply ﬁlters to limit views based on virtually any parameters, such as speciﬁc products like
ﬁrewalls or intrusion detection, speciﬁc vendors such as Sun or Cisco, speciﬁc global depart-
ments such as R&D or sales, or even across business-relevant categories such as mission-crit-
ical or ﬁnance-relevant systems.
Figure 12.17 Interactive Discovery Geo IP Chart
Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0 Interactive Discovery
Figure 12.18 shows various interactive charts together to illustrate just a few, ﬁnal exam-
ples of how you can render data using interactive discovery techniques. It’s not necessary for
the sake of the case studies in the following chapters to explore every permutation of inter-
active discovery formats that you can ﬁnd in advanced ESM solutions. However, as with
reports, the power is within the virtually endless set of possible charts that you can apply to
the data.And beyond reports, which are static, an equally powerful component of interactive
discovery is that it allows an analyst to view data from various perspectives, drill down, drill
up, highlight sections of interest, and essentially explore the data through a dynamic, visual
abstract.
Where pattern discovery provided an automated mechanism for searching data for
unknown relationships, interactive discovery allows for greater human intuition to be applied
toward the discovery process.This combination of computer-driven and human-driven anal-
ysis yields a needed balance for security analysis because as any analyst will tell you, much of
www.syngress.com
Event Storage and Forensic Analysis • Chapter 12
369

security is based on intuition as much as it is tools.This is why interactive discovery capabili-
ties are such a key feature in modern ESM solutions.
Figure 12.18 Various Interactive Discovery Charts 
Conclusion
This chapter outlined one approach to forensic data storage and analysis techniques with
ESM. It differed from the preceding chapter’s real-time scenarios only in that the events
were pulled from the ESM’s database and/or ofﬂine media and then into the database,
instead of real-time event feeds.These analysis techniques included reporting, pattern dis-
covery, and interactive discovery. Regardless of the events feeding these systems—logical or
physical—the forensic analysis capabilities remain the same and allow for a combination of
computer-driven discovery and a framework for human intuition to be applied through
advanced visual analysis.These capabilities are some of the key beneﬁts that make an ESM
solution an integral part of a risk management strategy, especially for complex scenarios asso-
ciated with physical and logical security convergence.
At this point in the book, you now have a solid background in many ESM fundamen-
tals. When reading through the use cases you may ﬁnd it valuable to reference these four
chapters again, because each use case is designed to outline particular scenarios and won’t
refocus on the underlying ESM technology that we have covered to this point.

Introduction
This chapter proposes in detail how a calculated insider-trading scam between an investment
banker and a stock broker working for a large Wall Street ﬁnancial ﬁrm could be foiled by
combining physical and logical event data through Enterprise Security Management (ESM).
In the security world, there is a term known as the Chinese wall.A Chinese wall is intended
to prevent certain users with compartmentalized knowledge from communicating. In this
chapter, we will examine what this means and how organizations implement it to protect
information from becoming available that could lead to an insider committing fraud.The
solution we present in this chapter encompasses a security team empowered by advanced
analytic tools and an understanding of the beneﬁts that come from analyzing data beyond
the typical ﬁrewall and intrusion detection system. We will cover how the analysis process
and eventual detection mechanism utilize data sources that focus far more on the activity of
users than on just network trafﬁc.These sources include both Voice over IP (VoIP) call detail
records (CDRs), and e-mail transaction logs that can tell us about communication among
individuals within an organization.
These devices are considered to be nontraditional sources, and the idea of collecting data
from these systems has not appeared on the radar of most security teams.They comprise
some very advanced (and rare) operations in which all user activity is monitored and tracked,
including call records, documents printed, and building and room access. Because these are
nontraditional data sources, new challenges are associated with collecting data from these
devices. We will address those challenges, and their solutions, in this chapter.
What Is a Chinese Wall?
A Chinese wall in this context is obviously not the massive 6,700-kilometer wall built by the
Ming Dynasty back in the 1300s to keep out the attacking Mongols.The term was recoined
after the United States stock market crash of 1929.The expression comes from laws that
Congress passed designating that policies needed to be in place to create a logical separation
between different groups of commercial and investment bankers. One of the main drivers for
this mandate was that the stock market crash was largely blamed on overinﬂated stock prices
due to insider trading and price manipulation.The law Congress passed in 1933, called the
Glass-Steagall Act, initially banned commercial banks from having anything to do with bro-
kerages. Since then, the rule has become less strict, and now large ﬁnancial organizations are
involved in investment banking, stock trading, and numerous other ﬁnancial activities.
The Chinese wall is also known as the Brewer-Nash model, which is designed to prevent
conﬂict-of-interest situations from arising, and to prevent information from being leaked.
The model classiﬁes data as conﬂict-of-interest categories. Once the data is categorized,
users, as well as processes that run on behalf of a user, are broken up into what’s known as a
subject. Rules are then put into place to describe which subjects can access or read and write
which objects.The following excerpt is from “The Chinese Wall Security Policy,” written by
www.syngress.com
372
Chapter 13 • Bridging the Chinese Wall

Dr. David F.C. Brewer and Dr. Michael J. Nash of Gamma Secure Systems Limited (Surrey,
United Kingdom):
Access is only granted if the object requested:
a) is in the same company dataset as an object already accessed by
that subject, i.e. within the Wall, or
b) belongs to an entirely different conﬂict of interest class.
Write access is only permitted if:
a) access is permitted by the simple security rule, and
b) no object can be read which is in a different company dataset to
the one for which write access is requested and contains unsanitized
information.
The preceding rules explain how the Brewer-Nash model deﬁnes data read and write
permissions.The read rule is attempting to ensure that a user reads only the data he has
already read, other data that is similarly classiﬁed, or data that is totally unrelated to the data
he previously read.The write rule is attempting to ensure that users who want to write data
must have already had previous access to that data, and that the data is on their computers.
This is known as the simple security rule.The user also cannot read any object in a different
conﬂict of interest, and the data must be unsanitized, meaning that it hasn’t been obfuscated.
“The Chinese Wall Security Policy” is interesting reading; you can read it at
www.gammassl.co.uk/topics/chwall.pdf.
Some refer to this as separation of duties. Most organizations have accounts payable and
accounts receivable departments that share a common application, such as SAP, to enter new
accounts and pay accounts. Employees who have the ability to enter a new account should
never have permission to pay the account as well.The conﬂict of interest is apparent:An
employee may add a dummy account that is really a front company, and slowly, over time, he
may use this account to embezzle money from his employer.
Over the past 40 years, the Federal Reserve Board, which is responsible for regulating
banks, has been allowing banks to create subsidiaries that can be involved in mergers and
acquisitions and the selling and underwriting of securities.This is where the problem presents
itself.You now have a large company with thousands of employees that may or may not know
each other and can beneﬁt from the information that others within the organization possess.
Let’s look at a very simple example. Joe, who works in the Mergers and Acquisitions
department, knows that a company he has been working with will soon be sold to a much
larger company, and he knows the sale will yield a proﬁt. Larry works for the same organiza-
tion as Joe, except he works in the Investment Banking sector. If Joe happens to have an
“innocent” conversation with Larry over a weekend golf game, and lets Larry in on a little
www.syngress.com
Bridging the Chinese Wall • Chapter 13
373

secret that a particular company will soon be sold, Larry can advise all his clients to invest in
this company, which will undoubtedly turn a large proﬁt for his clients, in turn fattening his
pockets based on his commission.This is one deﬁnition of insider trading. Figure 13.1 depicts
the scenario.
Figure 13.1 The Flow of a Data Leak
Figure 13.1 shows the way the investment data would leak between the Mergers and
Acquisitions department and the Investment Banking department.The boxes in the middle
show the departments and the shields above the departments show the data that each depart-
ment knows about that the other does not.The information leaks from the Mergers and
Acquisitions department, via a department ofﬁcer, to an investment banker. Now the conﬂict
of interest arises because the investment banker has knowledge of a company that will soon
be sold, which, depending on the price, can drive that company’s stock prices up or down. If
the investment banker leaks this information to his clients, you have a classic case of insider
trading.
Since the relaxation of the Glass-Steagall Act, no law says an organization can’t have
both a Mergers and Acquisitions and an Investment Banking department, and no law says
that if an organization does have both departments, the departments have to be physically
separated. Rather, corporations tend to operate under an inferred logical separation that’s really
based on the honor system, and we all know how well that works.Although the examples in
this chapter focus on ﬁnancial institutions, the same principles apply to other types of orga-
nizations.The intelligence community, for example, has a level of clearance known as com-
partmentalization.The idea behind compartmentalized clearance is that no one person knows
all the details of a mission. In the case of foreign intelligence, one team knows the identities

of the operatives, another group knows the targets, and a third knows what information is
trying to be collected.This means that if one person was leaking information, he wouldn’t
be able to compromise the entire mission.
What can we do about this? Keeping people who want to communicate apart from each
other is an extremely difﬁcult task. We can put measures into place using physical access sys-
tems, or place restrictions on phone numbers that people can dial from ofﬁce lines. However,
almost everyone has a cell phone, and in most organizations, you can’t stop people from
having lunch together inside the ofﬁce, much less outside the ofﬁce.And you certainly can’t
control what people do on weekends. We’ve seen extreme examples in which CIA
employees are monitored and will be followed by surveillance teams to ensure that they are
not communicating with others.Typically this occurs after there is reason to believe that
these employees are committing treason.As we mentioned earlier, the “new” Chinese wall is
based on an honor system, so putting restrictions in place really just causes users to become
more evasive. If you alleviate the restrictions put on users and passively monitor their
behavior, they will typically make a mistake and bring their activities to light, especially if
they don’t know you’re watching them. By looking at patterns of activity and communica-
tions, and by using advanced correlation tools, we can make sense of the masses of log data
and draw direct conclusions. In the next section, we will look at some of the challenges
involved with collecting data from new devices, such as e-mail and telephone call logs.
Data Sources
In this section, we will discuss the technologies we will be working with in this chapter. We
call these new data sources because they veer away from the traditional security event. In order
to detect fraudulent activity and anomalies in users’ behavior, you will need to analyze more
than just intrusion detection system data. We are not aware of any signature that you can
write in any intrusion detection system that will tell you that two “trusted” employees are
committing insider trading. Such a system looks for an attack pattern that is traversing the
network and targeting computer systems. In this case, we are not dealing with a logical attack
per se, although an attack is taking place.The users here have legitimate access to the systems
and the data they are accessing, but the problem arises when they share the information with
other users who are not privy to it.
This is a classic example of an insider threat. Internal threats are very difﬁcult to spot
and can cost corporations millions of dollars. Insider threats deal with users who are internal
to the organization and have access to systems and data. How can you catch someone that
doesn’t appear to be doing anything wrong? The book Insider Threat, by Dr. Eric Cole, dis-
cusses many examples of actual cases of insider threat.Another book we recommend is
Enemy at the Water Cooler, by Brian Contos, which details how to address the insider threat
problem from an ESM perspective. Experience shows that to detect an internal threat, an
early warning system must be in place. Most internal compromises are preceded by recon-
naissance activity and can be detected early if an early warning system is being used. One of

the main drivers of an early warning system is data sources that refer to actual users, not just
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. In the next two sections, we will look at some of these
technologies.
E-mail
Everyone has heard of e-mail. It’s been around for ages, and almost every corporation uses it
in one way or another to conduct day-to-day business and communicate both internally and
outside the company. Organizations offer e-mail as a service to their employees, and the
employees typically connect to a corporate mail server via a client such as Microsoft
Outlook. Risks are associated with corporate mail, and far greater risks are associated with
Web mail. In corporate mail environments, a user who intends to sneak data out of the com-
pany can attach a ﬁle to her outgoing message and send the ﬁle to any number of people,
including competitors, ex-coworkers, or even foreign nationals. Fortunately for us, we can
track such activity via the corporate mail server.
Typically when an employee is being investigated, all of her past e-mail will be investi-
gated to determine any wrongdoing or to build a case against her.The difﬁculty arises when
users begin to access Web mail servers such as Yahoo! and Hotmail.These sites allow users to
connect from within an organization, and attach the same ﬁle and mail it to the same
people—but without leaving any sort of record of what they’ve done. Now, when an investi-
gation is underway, the analyst or legal team cannot go back to the mail server and pull up
records of that person’s activities.An emerging ﬁeld known as information leak prevention (ILP)
tries to address these types of threats. ILP products look at content as it crosses the network,
similar to intrusion detection systems; however, so far, they have experienced problems con-
cerning false positives, similar to what intrusion detection system vendors faced years ago.
Investigators and legal teams have been using e-mail transactions as evidence of wrong-
doing for years, so why is this considered a “new” data source? E-mail is considered to be a
new data source because it falls outside the realm of what the typical security organization
usually monitors. E-mail transactions generally have not been analyzed in real time; they
have been used as part of forensic investigations. Once an employee is suspected of wrong-
doing, any e-mails she has sent are questioned. Now we are trying to draw conclusions and
detect early warning indicators of a potential data leakage before it happens, not after the fact.
The information that you can gain from examining e-mail messages may surprise you.
Beneﬁts of Integration
Several use-cases come to mind. One is information on the sender and recipient, which
allows you to build “top talkers” charts that let you determine who talks to whom, what
domains are receiving information from your company, and what domains are sending infor-
mation to your employees. E-mail messages are also useful for human resources (HR) inves-
tigations of employees. Someone from HR or the legal department will typically request all
the e-mails a particular employee has sent as part of collecting evidence for some wrong-

doing. Further, there is the message or the subject, which allows for some insight as to what
is actually being communicated.And when a ﬁle is attached to an e-mail, the ﬁlename can
appear in the subject line, which enables some monitoring of attachments that are being
sent. Other use-cases involve the size of e-mail messages that are being sent, and the times
the user sent the messages. It may arouse suspicions if a user is always sending large e-mail
messages in the middle of the night; this could represent some type of information leak or
other activity which may be a concern to the organization.
Encryption is another great example. Even though an encrypted message cannot be read
based on the frequency and recipient, you could infer what is happening.
Since we mentioned HR, it’s also worth mentioning the legal issues regarding moni-
toring employees’ e-mail transactions. When employment begins at most organizations, the
new employee and the employer sign a policy that usually states that all communications
using company equipment are subject to monitoring.The policies typically in place are not
always quite as speciﬁc as they should be, however, and in many privacy cases, such policies
have been questioned in court.
To avoid confusion, the policy should clearly state that e-mails can and will be moni-
tored. In cases in which policies clearly state the companies are monitoring e-mail, courts
have found in favor of the companies. One such case is Bourke v. Nissan. Nissan ﬁred Bourke
when he was accused of receiving and sending sexually explicit e-mails. Bourke took Nissan
to court for violation of privacy, and the court ruled in favor of Nissan because its policy
clearly stated that e-mails were being monitored. We have also seen discrimination cases in
which an employee claims he is being “picked on” because his e-mails are being monitored,
but not those of other employees. In these cases, it is important to be able to prove that
everyone is treated in the same way, and that in cases of suspected wrongdoing, the investiga-
tion process is the same.
Challenges of Integration
Because e-mail has been around for so long and e-mail messages contain so much useful
information, why isn’t e-mail collection and analysis more widespread? Challenges exist
when it comes to collecting this type of information. Let’s look at one of the most common
e-mail messaging systems in the world, Microsoft Exchange Server.
Distributed Logging
The ﬁrst challenge with collecting data from Exchange is that organizations usually have
more than one Exchange server.A large bank, for example, may have upward of 600,000
employees, and to accommodate that many accounts and the large volume of e-mail transac-
tions that occur daily, the company may use several Exchange servers per location. Microsoft
doesn’t provide any centralized logging mechanism, so collection and conﬁguration must be
done on a per-server basis. Figure 13.2 depicts the conﬁguration section of the Exchange
Server Admin console.Two options are available: enable message tracking and enable subject
logging.
www.syngress.com
Bridging the Chinese Wall • Chapter 13
377

Figure 13.2 The Exchange Logging Properties
In order for Exchange to write a tracking log, you must enable the message tracking
option.To ensure 100 percent data collection, subject line tracking should be enabled as well.
To further the Exchange collection challenge, each server writes to a speciﬁed directory.
As we said, Microsoft does not provide centralized logging, so any collection needs to occur
from each server, or the logs must be written to a shared directory. When using shared direc-
tories, problems may arise, such as security issues, access, and bandwidth utilization, due to
the high volume of messages that are being logged.
In addition, a collection mechanism is required that understands and follows the log
rotation facility that is conﬁgured as part of Exchange message tracking. If an automated
process is collecting the logs that are being written, it must be able to deal with the ﬁlename
changing and a new ﬁle being written to, as part of the log rotation.
Event Volume
Exchange message tracking generates upward of eight messages per e-mail sent. Because this
log can be used as a debugging facility, a message is logged for each step in the process of a
mail delivery.Table 13.1 provides a sample of some of the events that are generated. For
more information regarding the events that Exchange can generate, visit the Microsoft
TechNet Web site, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821905.

The high volume of events generated per e-mail is not the only factor that contributes
to the number of events Exchange generates. If you have multiple Exchange servers
deployed, as most organizations do, each server the message passes through will generate the
same number of events. In order to reduce some of the event volume, your collection mech-
anism needs to be able to ﬁlter out some of the noise. When analyzing Exchange events, it is
typically sufﬁcient to ﬁlter out all events except for event ID 1028, which is the event gener-
ated when an e-mail message has been delivered. Filtering down to this event ID reduces the
noise by a factor of at least eight.This doesn’t apply only to Exchange. In the Sendmail
world, at least two events are written per server for each e-mail that is sent or received.This
is not quite as extreme as eight messages per e-mail, but it still lends itself to ﬁltering.

Log Format
Once the collection is in order, the message needs to be parsed and the values need to be
mapped to their respective normalized ﬁelds. For detailed information regarding normaliza-
tion, refer to Chapter 12.The following log shows the events written when one e-mail mes-
sage is sent through Exchange in raw format:

Each message in the preceding log contains information that needs to be mapped to a
normalized schema. It is common practice to refer to vendor documentation to obtain a
description for the nonobvious event ﬁelds.Table 13.2 gives some examples of brief descrip-
tions for these ﬁelds, as provided by Microsoft.
Table 13.2 Event Fields and Descriptions
Field
Description
date-time
The date and time of the message tracking
event. The value is formatted as yyyy-mm-
ddhh:mm:ss.fffZ, where yyyy = year, mm =
month, dd = day, hh = hour, mm = minute, ss =
second, fff = fractions of a second, and Z signi-
ﬁes Zulu, which is another way to denote UTC.
server-ip
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) address of the source or desti-
nation Exchange server.
server-hostname
The name of the Exchange server that created
the message tracking log entry. This is typically
the name of the Exchange server holding the
message tracking logﬁles.
recipient-address
The e-mail addresses of the message’s recipients.
Multiple e-mail addresses are separated by a
semicolon. 
total-bytes
The size of the message that includes attach-
ments, in bytes.
recipient-count
The number of recipients in the message.
message-subject
The message’s subject, found in the Subject: P2

From Logs to ESM
Once the data has been successfully collected, normalized, and passed to the ESM platform,
it is available for analysis and correlation. Figure 13.3 shows Exchange message tracking
events once they have been processed and presented to a security analyst via the ArcSight
Console.
Figure 13.3 Exchange Message Tracking Events after Processing, As Shown
in the ArcSight Console
E-mail events are a great source of information. Not only are they useful as a way of
tracking who is talking to whom and what information is leaving an organization, but they
also lend themselves to visual analysis. By creating event graphs showing sender-to-recipient
trafﬁc, with the subject of the e-mail message as the connecting node, it is very easy to see
who a particular user is communicating with and how many people have received the com-
munication.
However, because most organizations’ e-mail trafﬁc usually is in the millions of e-mails
per day, it would be inefﬁcient to try to manually look at the messages as they scroll by in a
channel-type view, as shown in Figure 13.3. It is much easier to view these events in a visual
representation. Figure 13.4 shows an event graph of one user’s e-mail trafﬁc.The dark box in
the middle is the sender, the gray connecting circles are the e-mail subjects, and the white
boxes are the recipients.The user is sending an e-mail with a subject of “new project” to ﬁve
other users; an e-mail to his manager; and an e-mail to a friend at Yahoo.com. One of the
most interesting use-cases is to watch all trafﬁc destined for Web mail accounts and examine
the size for possible information leaks.

Figure 13.4 Email Communications Graph
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
Figure 13.5 shows the ﬁeld mappings from the email event to an ESM normalized
schema.The ﬁelds that are typically the most used are the message ﬁeld, where the e-mail
subject is mapped; and the bytes in/out ﬁeld, where we can look at the size of the message.
As we mentioned earlier, the size of an e-mail is very useful in terms of analysis. If you con-
tinuously put message sizes through a statistical analysis engine you can determine the
average e-mail size per user as well as overall.This allows you to monitor and investigate
large deviations. In the ﬁgure, the sender and recipient are mapped to the attacker and target
username ﬁelds, and these are required to do any analysis on a per-user basis. Finally, the
number of recipients allows you to track e-mails that have been sent to a large audience.
Room for Improvement
Microsoft probably did not intend for security teams to collect and analyze Exchange mes-
sage tracking logs, so ease of collection and parsing was not part of the product criteria
because these logs were meant for debugging purposes. With that in mind, Microsoft could
make improvements in several areas. One improvement could be the addition of a consoli-
dated logging mechanism.A centralized log collector would eliminate the scenario of con-
necting to each Exchange server to collect messages, and getting duplicate events as a
message passes through each server.This would also alleviate the need to open network
shares or install connectors on each Exchange server. It also would be nice to have different
levels of logging. If all you had to do was track e-mails sent and received, it would be nice to
www.syngress.com
Bridging the Chinese Wall • Chapter 13
383

turn off logging for all the other components.The most important improvement, however,
would be the ability to log attachment names. It would be nice to see the actual attachment
that was being sent with an e-mail.This is where the Exchange logs are lacking. If this func-
tionality existed, it would be possible to see what types of documents were leaving the orga-
nization and being sent among groups. If we can write a signature on our intrusion
detection system that will parse out the attachment name, it should be a trivial addition for
Microsoft.

In addition to Exchange, Sendmail does not log attachment names either. We have not
been able to ﬁnd a statement from either vendor indicating that they will include this capa-
bility in later releases of their products, nor that they are even considering doing so.
Everyone should call the vendor of their mail server and relay the message that this is impor-
tant information and should be a requirement for future releases.As noted earlier, ILP sys-
tems are available that monitor e-mail as it crosses the network. Such products will provide
the attachment names from e-mails that have been sent, but they come with their own sets
of problems.Also, it’s fairly easy to change the name of an attachment, thus requiring deep
inspection where the actual content of the attachment is analyzed. In large organizations,
dealing with the massive amounts of trafﬁc that need to be inspected can get expensive from
a device perspective.

E-mail is a great technology for communication. It allows users within organizations to
communicate efﬁciently across time zones, and it allows friends to stay in touch. Just imagine
if every time you sent an e-mail you actually had to pick up the phone to get the same mes-
sage delivered.You would never get anything done.As with all conveniences, we pay a price;
a security risk is associated, and therefore, we must take precautions, such as monitoring.
Voice over IP
Now we will walk through the collection of VoIP logs. VoIP is a way to send voice over a
standard IP network. Voice coders and decoders are used to convert voice into IP packets
that can be sent over the network.The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) takes care of the
routing and management of VoIP transactions. VoIP phone systems are becoming more and
more prevalent.They are in most large organizations and have even started to hit the hotel
and consumer markets. VoIP systems generate what is known as a call detail record (CDR),
which is really just a log entry stating that a call was made or received.Tracking phone calls
has been a hot topic in recent times, with the collection of CDRs from the major phone
companies being considered an invasion of privacy, but in the private and public sectors, usu-
ally an agreement is signed stating that all IP-related activity can and will be monitored for
misuse. It’s hard to say whether CDRs should be considered to be logical security or physical
security, but it seems that it could be considered either or neither. We consider phone
records as a combination of the two.
To understand VoIP logging let’s start with a simple example of how a call takes place.
Figure 13.6 depicts a typical VoIP topology.The call starts from the originator and is routed
to the phone’s default gateway, which in the VoIP world is known as the signaling server.The
signaling server is responsible for the setup and teardown of calls.The signaling server then
routes the call to a call server, which runs software that performs call control functions such
as accounting and administration, protocol conversion, and authorization.The call server
then passes the call to the VoIP switch, which either sends the call out or routes it back to
another internal phone.
In VoIP, the sound from your voice is treated as data.The sound is converted into
packets and traverses the network just as normal IP packets would.There are routers and
switches, but the difference here is that a simple latency issue doesn’t make your download
slow; it makes your VoIP service unusable, a condition known as the jitters.You may have
experienced this before, where the person you are talking to sounds as though he is on
another planet.A VoIP network consists of other components, such as media gateways that
handle protocol conversions or components that convert text to voice, but we did not
include them in Figure 13.5 for simplicity. For further information on the inner workings of
VoIP visit www.protocols.com/pbook/VoIPFamily.htm, where you’ll ﬁnd a great introduction to
the components and protocols involved.

Figure 13.5 Simple VoIP Topology
Beneﬁts of Integration
As with tracking any type of communications, monitoring VoIP logs provides basic session
information similar to monitoring e-mail trafﬁc.The information typically provided in a
CDR is the call initiator, the recipient, and the duration of the call. If we compare CDRs to
e-mail events, we can consider the duration to be the size of the message or how much
information was communicated. Basic use-cases would be to monitor top talkers, or moni-
toring who is talking to whom and what time of day calls are being placed.An interesting
application for VoIP logs is to monitor off-hour usage, meaning who comes into the ofﬁce
on the weekends or in the middle of the night to make long-distance personal calls.
More advanced use-cases would be to build relationship charts that show all the people
from different groups that are communicating with each other. For example, in the intelli-
gence community, there are people with compartmentalized knowledge who should not
share this information with other people who have different compartmentalized knowledge.
It seems as though monitoring phone calls among people would be very appealing to some
of the more classiﬁed segments of the industry. In the use-case we are discussing in this
chapter, VoIP logs play a key component to the detection mechanism that is proposed.
Monitoring phone calls between users who should not be communicating on a regular basis
will uncover anomalies such as high volumes of calls between users and long call duration.
This type of behavior, although it may be normal and may not be malicious, can indicate
that a user should be investigated further.
Challenges of Integration
VoIP systems have been designed from the beginning with CDR logging in mind. Most, if
not all, call servers have the capability to log the calls made and received.This logging was

not designed with the security analyst in mind; its main driver is billing. If there was no log-
ging, it would be impossible for service providers to charge for calls that are placed or
received.
Call servers write CDRs to local text ﬁles, but this is not the ideal place to collect them.
The call servers usually have a management software package available that connects directly
to a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port on each switch where these logs are con-
stantly being streamed out (similar to syslog). Once they are collected, they are put into a
database where they can be analyzed for billing and usage information.This works great for
integration with ESM, because log aggregators are our friends. Because the logs are already
being aggregated and collected, all that’s needed is one connector to connect to one system
to obtain all the call records from all the switches managed by the telephony manager appli-
cation.
The next step for integration with VoIP products is conﬁguration, which is by no means
a difﬁcult task. Enabling CDRs for external-to-internal calls and internal-to-external calls is
typically the default on most systems. On the Nortel system depicted in Table 13.4, you can
easily show the conﬁguration of the trunks and see that CDR logging is enabled.

The next step is to conﬁgure the logging of internal-to-internal calling. Most phone
systems do not log this by default, because it’s not relevant to billing. In order to log this
data, internal call detail (ICD) needs to be enabled. On Nortel systems, this setting is set to
ICDD (Internal Call Detail Disabled) by default.Table 13.5 shows how the conﬁgura-
tion should look on a Nortel system if ICD is enabled.

Log Format
The logging format from VoIP systems is generally very simple and doesn’t contain too
many ﬁelds that are relevant to ESM.The ﬁelds that are interesting for analysis are the call
initiator, the recipient, and the call duration ﬁelds.The following log example is from a
Nortel system:
N 025 00 2600
T001023 08/16 17:34 00:03:18 A 14155551212 & 0000 0000
N 027 00 T001002 2600
08/16 17:38 00:00:06 A 14155551212 & 0000 0000
N 029 00 2600 2669
08/16 17:38 00:01:02 & 0000 0000
The ﬁrst line shows an internal-to-external call, placed from extension 2600 to the
number 415-555-1212, at 17:34, with a duration of 3 minutes and 18 seconds.The second
line shows a call originating from an external number going to extension 2600 with a 2-

second duration.The third line shows an internal-to-internal call from extension 2600 to
extension 2611 lasting 6 seconds.
The relevant ﬁelds in the preceding log are the source of the call, the destination, the
duration, and the trunk the call went through.The trunk the call went through is not
important in the actual analysis, but as far as understanding whether a call was inbound or
outbound, the location of the trunk in the log line is important. In the preceding example,
the trunk is the value that starts with a T and is in bold. If the trunk appears before the
extension, as in line two, it is an incoming call; if the trunk appears after the extension, it is
an outbound call; and if no trunk is speciﬁed, the call was placed between two internal
phones. It is also important to note that these logs are from a call server that serves only one
preﬁx. If you have a server that serves multiple preﬁxes, the extension numbers will be ﬁve
digits rather than four.
From Logs to ESM
After parsing the logs and sending the events to the ESM platform, they are ready to be ana-
lyzed and compared with other event feeds.As part of VoIP log processing, a process needed
to be put in place to map the values to the appropriate ﬁelds.This can be especially chal-
lenging when placement of the values changes the meaning of the events, as is the case with
the position of the trunk value. Furthermore, because this is a new event source, the schema
does not always contain a ﬁeld that can deal with a value such as a phone number.This
requires that we add a new ﬁeld to the system, or that we use a ﬁeld that may be reserved
for different types of values.
In this case, it’s best not to abuse a ﬁeld used for an IP address or a username; rather, we
should use a ﬁeld that is reserved for custom values for devices such as this. Figure 13.7
shows how the events would look to an analyst as they come into the ArcSight ESM v4
console. Notice the direction associated with each event.The internal-to-internal calls have
no direction because they stay within the same system.This will be important in our analysis
process later.
Figure 13.6 shows several calls being made and the ﬁelds as they map to the ESM
schema. In the highlighted event, an inbound call was placed from 510-555-1212 to exten-
sion 2600.The call’s duration was 1,980 seconds or 33 minutes. Figure 13.6 shows how the
ﬁelds from an event indicating a successful phone call are mapped to an ESM schema.

product vendor that generated the event; the originator; the recipient; the duration; and the
trunk over which the call came.The biggest challenge here is the duration.This is a very
important ﬁeld in terms of analysis, as it allows you to compute top talkers, top talker pairs,
and the most expensive phone calls. If you recall from the raw logs, the duration was in a
time format whereby the call in this detailed view would have had a value of 22:30, or 22
minutes and 30 seconds.The raw value is very difﬁcult to do any computation on, so the
number must be converted into seconds to allow for functions to be run. In this example,
22:30 is converted into decimal notation as 22.5 minutes and then multiplied by 60 to get
the total number of seconds that the call lasted.
Figure 13.7 is a visual analysis of these phone calls.The call originator is represented by
the small dark boxes; the call direction is represented by the gray circles; and the destination
or call recipient is represented by the white boxes.The ﬁgure shows several transactions. On
the left, you can see that three inbound calls are placed to extension 2600.The graph on the
right shows all the calls placed from extension 2600: three outbound calls and one internal-
to-internal call.

Visualization of event data always lends itself to speeding up the analysis process. It has
been said that a picture is worth a thousand loglines, and seeing a visualization of phone calls
made and received validates that statement.The number of phone calls made and received by
large organizations per day can be in the millions (or, at least, hundreds of thousands).Trying

to make any sense of those calls in a text-based logﬁle in the format shown previously would
be a nightmare. With a visual representation of the same messages, we can quickly separate
inbound and outbound calls as well as determine the caller and recipient.
Although the examples in this chapter include a detailed explanation of VoIP CDRs and
how we can collect them, similar logging mechanisms exist on most, if not all, private branch
exchange (PBX) phone systems. PBX phone systems are beginning to be phased out by
more advanced VoIP systems that are considered more reliable as well as more cost-effective.
The events that a PBX system writes are known as call state events (CSEs) and again are
written after a phone call has been completed. PBX state events contain much of the same
information that a VoIP system will write to a CDR—typically the caller, recipient, and call
duration.
Logical security typically deals with events generated from devices that are tied into the
IP network of an organization. In the past, the phone system was completely separated from
the IP network, so if it was even considered, it was more in the communication or physical
monitoring realm. Now with the introduction of IP-enabled phones, it tends to be a gray
area where the collection of CDRs could be considered either physical or logical.As we
move to the next section, it’s important to remember the information that we can obtain
through the collection of CDRs.These events are not security events per se, and they don’t
indicate any wrongdoing, but the statistics they provide give analysts another data point in
their detection of an insider trading attempt.
Bridging the Chinese Wall: 
Detection through Convergence
Now that we have an understanding of what a Chinese wall is and some of the beneﬁts and
challenges of the collection of new data sources for analysis, we will walk through a simple
scenario of two employees working for a large investment bank and how their plan to trade
insider knowledge is detected. Several advanced correlation techniques will be addressed in
the eventual detection, such as role-based correlation and statistical anomaly detection.The
example we are using in this chapter involves two users in an investment bank, but the
theory and detection mechanism could be applied to any type of organization where silos of
information need to be separated. Government agencies currently use these principles and
data sources to monitor the communications of their internal employees. In such an
example, it is not investment information that is considered compartmentalized; it is much
more serious—the data could be the location of agents, agents’ identities, or upcoming mis-
sions, where a compromise wouldn’t have a dollar price tag.This technology currently is
applied across vertical markets because the underlying principles are good security practices
and prevent the compromise of information among departments where the combination of
compartmentalized knowledge leads to compromise.

The Plot
David and Maxwell work for a large ﬁnancial institution, Finance123.They work in different
departments: David works in the Mergers and Acquisitions department and Maxwell works
in the Brokerage and Investment Banking department. Because communication between
these two departments represents a conﬂict of interest and violates compliance regulations,
strict policies are in place prohibiting communication between the departments.The policies
even go so far as to restrict the employees from entering the building through the same
entrance.The policies are verbally communicated, but there are no restrictions on who you
can call, what e-mail addresses you can send or receive, or who you can meet for lunch
down the street. Unfortunately, for Finance123, the technology and policies are not in sync.
Not all policies can be implemented with technology; sometimes there are staff and procure-
ment limitations, and as the old saying goes,“where there is a will, there is a way.”This is
especially true of how humans behave when they are trying to get around the “system.”The
best you can hope for in this situation is an early detection mechanism through warning
signs, anomaly detection, and analysis, ﬁnding and stopping the problem before it occurs.
Maxwell and David, our conspirators, know that the information they hold is valuable to
one another. If David clues Maxwell in on an upcoming acquisition Maxwell can recom-
mend to all of his clients to invest in the company that is going to be bought.This is good
for both Maxwell and David; their commissions increase and they look like ﬁnancial super-
stars.This activity is exactly what the Chinese wall was designed to prevent.The scenario
shows how David and Maxwell’s communication behavior is brought to the attention of
security analysts, preventing what would be considered a breach of the set policies of
Finance123 and an insider trading attempt.
Detection
Finance123 uses an advanced ESM system set up to monitor external threats and detect
internal abuse. By collecting events from these nontraditional data sources, the company is
able to monitor internal communications as well as detect anomalous behavior by
employees.The setup is fairly typical of an ESM deployment. It consists of several compo-
nents. Figure 13.8 shows (from left to right) the devices generating the data, the ArcSight
connectors that are collecting the data and forwarding it to the ESM system, the ArcSight
Manager, and analyst consoles.

Figure 13.8 Components of an ESM System
Building the Chinese Wall
The ﬁrst important step for eventual detection is for the ESM platform to understand the
users in each department. We can refer to this as role-based correlation. Without an under-
standing of which users are in each department, analysis would be extremely difﬁcult and
would require an analyst to remember the different users and their departments.
Furthermore, it wouldn’t be possible for the ESM platform to detect anomalous communi-
cations among groups without having an understanding of what the groups are. Because
cross-departmental communications are being monitored between two departments, the
setup is simple.All that is needed for the ESM platform to understand the user organization
is a list of user attributes in each department.A user attribute is any value that identiﬁes a par-
ticular user, such as a domain logon, extension, or e-mail address.
Once we know the attributes of a particular user, we can correlate events and attribute
events back to that user. Using Active List technology within ESM, we can easily track these
attributes and correlate events against these lists, speciﬁcally checking for a particular event
value as being in one of the lists.An example would be an event sent to ESM where the
source username, maxwellj@ﬁnance123.com, is checked against the Active List to validate
whether maxwellj@ﬁnance123.com is a member of the Brokerage department. Figure 13.9
shows the two role-based active lists.

In these two active lists, we have set up a virtual Chinese wall where we are keeping
track of the user attributes from each department. In the Brokerage Active List, notice that
there are several entries for Maxwell. We can see his e-mail address, his phone extension, and
his Windows domain account logon username. In the Mergers and Acquisitions list to the
right, there are similar attributes for David.
Bridging the Chinese Wall
As David and Maxwell continue to share information with each other, they communicate
using standard channels, not considering that they could be monitored. However, they are
being monitored.All of their communications are being tracked, and because they have been
corresponding quite a bit, their behavior sets off alerts in the ESM system because their pat-
terns are anomalous.The setup used to detect these anomalies is a series of moving average
data monitors. Data monitors sit in the real-time event ﬂow and collect stats on the events
that are coming into the ESM platform.The data monitors used in this scenario are designed
to collect information on the communications that are occurring between departments.
ESM is tracking all forms of communication between users in the two previously described
active lists. If the e-mail sender is in the Brokerage Active List and the recipient is in the
Mergers and Acquisitions Active List, or vice versa, the communication will be tracked.
Similarly for phone calls, if the caller is in one list and the destination extension is in the
other, the call will be tracked.
So, why not alert on all communications between departments? There may be valid
business reasons for some forms of communications, but if you look at every e-mail that is
sent between the departments or every phone call made, you would need a team of hun-
dreds of analysts.This is why we are looking for anomalies; either users who have never
communicated before or users who demonstrate behavior patterns that fall outside those of
normal communications.

Four different data monitors are being used in this scenario.The ﬁrst is tracking the
number of e-mails sent between users in the two departments. Figure 13.12 shows several
groups of sender/recipient pairs that are communicating across departments.The number of
e-mails from Maxwell to David and David to Maxwell is far higher than those from most
users in the organization.They are not the only users communicating between the depart-
ments, but they are the only two who seem to be replying to each other’s e-mail, as both
show up as a sender and as a recipient.The other two nodes on the data monitor have only
sent e-mail to the other department.

The data monitor in the preceding ﬁgure shows the number of e-mails between a given
sender and recipient pair from different departments over time. Each time slice is 24 hours.
The x-axis represents time—in this case, days—and the y-axis represents the number of e-
mails.The expanded section shows that Maxwell has been sending David an average of eight
e-mails per day for the past 11 days.This is quite a bit of communicating back and forth for
two users who really don’t have any business communicating.The line in the middle of the
chart shows the moving average.

Chapter 13 • Bridging the Chinese Wall

As we continue to monitor e-mail trafﬁc between the departments, not only do we
want to look for anomalies in the number of e-mails sent, but we also want to see the size of
the e-mails sent. If two users are trying to hide their communication or just not communi-
cating via e-mail, but one sends the other a large attachment containing details on all
upcoming mergers and acquisitions, that communication needs to be caught, even though
the message count would be only 1, meaning that it probably wouldn’t show up on an ana-
lyst’s radar using the previous data monitor. Figure 13.11 shows a data monitor looking for
anomalies in the size of messages between users from different departments. It is apparent
from the graph that Maxwell and David have been sending far more information back and
forth than any other users in the two departments. We achieve this statistic by running a sum
function on the bytes ﬁeld, or the size ﬁeld of the e-mail.
Figure 13.11 Data Monitor Looking for Anomalies in Size of Messages
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
As mentioned, the preceding data monitor is doing a sum function on the size of all of
the e-mail messages that have been sent between users in different departments.Again, this is
set up as size over a given time slice, which in this case is a 24-hour period.The y-axis is
represented in bytes and the x-axis is represented in days. In the callout, you can see that
Maxwell has sent David nearly 12 million bytes per day.This is nearly 1.15 MB. E-mail mes-
sages are typically very small.A large e-mail containing several paragraphs of text is typically
around .5 MB.This would indicate more than the average “Hey what’s up?” e-mail going
back and forth, and in fact would indicate that attachments probably are being sent or that
data is being pasted into the body of the e-mail.

David and Maxwell have been showing up all over the e-mail anomaly data monitors,
and similar data monitors are tracking the usage of the VoIP system. With the VoIP events,
we can track almost the same information as with e-mail if we think about the duration of
the call as the bytes sent in the e-mail message. Figure 13.12 shows the sum of the duration
of calls that have taken place between users in the different departments—namely, David at
extension 2156 and Maxwell at extension 2609. Remember that the duration has been con-
verted to seconds, so the numbers in the legend represent seconds.
Figure 13.12 Sum: Duration of Calls between David and Maxwell
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
The data monitor in Figure 13.12 is tracking the sum or total time spent on the phone
between two extensions that are in different departments.The x-axis again represents the
time slices, which are 12 hours, and the y-axis represents the total time spent on the phone
per day, in seconds.The chart that is called out suggests that extension 2156 (David) has
spent nearly 23 minutes per day on the phone with extension 2609 (Max). From the average
marker in the middle of the graph, we can see that the average talk time between the two is
steadily increasing.
Figure 13.13 shows the data monitors used in this scenario, displayed on a dashboard.
Although we covered only one type of data monitor in this chapter, there are different ways
to present the data monitors, including event graphs, top values, and geographic event map-
ping, to name a few.

Data monitors don’t just create a nice visual representation of event trafﬁc; they also
serve a much greater purpose.They actually perform statistical correlation. If an analyst
wasn’t watching these visual representations all day long, the communication between
Maxwell and David may have gone unnoticed. However, because data monitors are doing
real-time analysis, they generate correlation events which can have actions associated with
them.The correlation event is based on certain conditions that are conﬁgured as part of the
data monitor, such as the percent deviation that you want to trigger an alarm or have an
action take place. In this case, we are alerting whenever we see a spike in communications
between departments that is greater than 10 percent.This means that the analyst a
Finance123 received several notiﬁcations telling her that there was a spike in trafﬁc between
these two users. Figure 13.14 shows the correlation events generated by these data monitors
in the analyst’s console.

Bridging the Chinese Wall • Chapter 13
399

Figure 13.14 Correlation Events Generated by These Data Monitors in the
ArcSight ESM Console
Source:ArcSight ESM v4.0
Because the analyst has received these notiﬁcations, it’s time to do some investigation.
The ﬁrst step the analyst must take is to look at the details of the notiﬁcations and deter-
mine who is involved and what other events may be coming from those users.The best way
to do this is to run an investigative report where the username is used as a ﬁlter condition.
The analyst runs several reports to show calls made between Maxwell and David, the dura-
tion of the calls, and e-mail trafﬁc between the two users.These reports can be presented to
management, legal, or HR as evidence that these users have been displaying some question-
able behavior.The report in Figure 13.15 is an example of a user investigation report based
on e-mail trafﬁc between Maxwell and David.

Chapter 13 • Bridging the Chinese Wall

Just by reading the message ﬁeld of the e-mail alone, the analyst is very suspicious and
decides that an investigation is warranted.The report is given to management, and further
investigation into the contents of the e-mails, the different accounts that David has been
involved with, and the investments that Maxwell has been advising on reveals too many
coincidences to say they were not conducting fraudulent activities.
Conclusion
The type of fraud we discussed in this chapter would result not only in the loss of a job, but
also in legal ramiﬁcations.The employees and the company in this case are ﬁctitious, but this
type of thing happens every day and is very hard to detect. If you consider all the informa-
tion that is ﬂoating around your organization, imagine having to track where it is going
externally, let alone internally.These are the types of processes that we can streamline and
automate through ESM and the convergence of new data sources.Although these data
sources do present some challenges, such as the collection of the e-mail messages and some
of the parsing of the VoIP CDRs, these are things that will only improve over time as com-
panies tell their vendors that they need manageable logs and the ability to collect those logs
in a convenient manner. Once they are collected, there are worlds of possibilities for analysis.

Introduction
When you mention the topic of physical and logical security convergence, no one use case
drives home the message and gets listeners to understand the beneﬁts more than the use case
we are addressing in this chapter: physical plus virtual private network (VPN) access.The
term Holy Grail is overused in the security industry and is always used to point out the latest
and greatest discovery.The combination of physical and logical authentication events really is
the epitome of convergence. When correlating locations and access to network resources,
detecting ranges of security violations, including account sharing, is one of the most sought-
after capabilities that exist today. It enables you to detect an account sharing violation by dis-
covering that a user is physically in the building and has accessed the network from a remote
location using his or her account via the VPN, or that the user is not in the building but is
accessing local resources. Many security professionals have talked about scenarios involving
users who are physically at the ofﬁce but whose accounts are being used by others to log
into the network.These use cases span nearly every vertical and probably keep many chief
security ofﬁcers up at night. Large banks and government organizations alike have much to
lose by having unauthorized users on their networks (in addition to the lack of account-
ability that comes with users sharing passwords and user accounts).These scenarios can be
detected and prevented only through true convergence, by mature organizations that are
willing to cross boundaries and with advanced correlation capabilities provided by Enterprise
Security Management (ESM).
In this chapter, we will examine the details of these two main use cases: what’s involved
in detection, and where the true challenges arise. We will then identify how some of these
challenges can be addressed through the use of common access cards, and how the total solu-
tion will involve cross-team collaboration, through log detection and advanced ESM capabil-
ities. We will examine some authentication logs generated by two devices—Tri-D Systems’
One Time Password (OTP) module, which is part of its biometric smartcard offering; and
VPN Access logs from a Juniper Netscreen VPN ﬁrewall. We will then look at the collection
and integration process of collecting logs from physical access systems, and ﬁnally we will
explore our two use cases: ﬁrst, a ﬁnancial institution that catches a corporate spy knee-deep
in its ﬁnancial advisement databases, followed by a government organization with two
administrators sharing their user accounts because it’s convenient.
Use-Case Exploration
Because both of the use cases in this chapter are fairly complex, we will begin by exploring
the moving parts of both examples. Doing this will help when we get to the detection con-
cepts and it will help to understand the data sources from which we want to gather very
particular information. Both use cases involve the correlation of events from disparate sys-
tems that can be brought together only through the use of correlation. Both use cases
involve physical access data complemented with logical authentication events—one from a
www.syngress.com
404
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

VPN and the other from a Windows server.The data sources feeding the correlation engine
are providing key data points regarding user information.All the events we will examine
describe a user’s behavior rather than that of a system.At the end of the day, you can’t ﬁre an
Internet Protocol (IP) address, but you need to know the user who committed the violation.
Physical + VPN Access
As mentioned previously, this is one of the most talked about, most glamorized, and least
achieved use cases in security today. When we look a little deeper, we will understand why.
The consequences of someone sharing his VPN account with an external entity, and giving
that entity full access to conﬁdential company resources, is detrimental. It is not hard for an
employee who has become corrupt or has been corrupt from the beginning to share his cre-
dentials and site information with a third party. Really, it’s quite simple.The employee simply
needs to give the person his username and password, and the IP address used to connect to
the network.The third party simply needs to install the appropriate VPN client and point
the application to the correct IP address and supply the username and password. Now the
third party is on the network, authenticated as a valid user, and has access to all of the net-
work resources that the user account has permission to access.This may include ﬁle shares, e-
mail accounts, applications, and databases.
This is deﬁnitely something that should not be happening, so how can we detect this
type of activity? For starters, we are assuming the employee who is sharing his account is
someone who works on-site most of the time and may travel or work from home, thereby
explaining the need for a VPN account in the ﬁrst place.The user comes into the ofﬁce
most days, and to get access to the building he uses a physical access control system (PACS).
When the user is authenticated via the PACS, an event is generated including the user’s ID
and the entryway through which he entered the building.This is our initial piece of infor-
mation that is critical to collect in order to detect a physical and VPN access violation.
Now that we know who is in the building, we must catch access attempts that indicate
that someone else is attempting to access the network via the VPN using an account that
belongs to someone who is physically in the building. Because VPNs are used to access the
network from remote locations, if a user is physically in the building, he shouldn’t need to
VPN into the network. By collecting the logs from the VPN device or the authentication
module that the VPN device uses to validate login attempts, we get the second piece of
information needed to detect this type of violation.The next section looks at our second use
case, followed by a deep dive into the technologies we are using in this chapter.
Administrative Account Sharing
The second use case we are going to detect in this chapter is not a case of malicious activity,
but rather a case of a general security violation. We are going to detect an account sharing
violation between two employees that may have shared their account and password for work
reasons. Regardless of whether the intent is malicious it is still not a good idea to have users
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
405

sharing accounts because this leads to a lack of accountability and responsibility. If multiple
users share one account, it is extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible, to ﬁgure out whom many
have made a critical change or deleted sensitive data.This is known as lack of account-
ability and is very common when systems are managed using an account such as root, for
example. In a well-organized team, users would never access a system directly as root, nor
would they switch to the root user once on the system. Rather, they would use the sudo
method whereby a user is allowed to execute certain privileged commands as speciﬁed in
the sudo conﬁguration ﬁles. In order to execute the commands, the user’s password must be
supplied, thus creating an audit trail of all the commands that were run and by which user.
It seems that this account sharing violation would be fairly difﬁcult to catch, but by
expanding our data collection and analysis capabilities, through integration of physical access
logs into the normal collection process, we are able to detect such violations.A common
theme in this chapter will be the event that is generated when a user enters the building using
his badge or key fob. Physical access technology will be explained in detail later in this
chapter, but the general idea is that an event, similar to a login to a computer, is generated
when a user enters the building.The other data feed required for this use case is operating
system logs from either Windows or UNIX servers.The trick here is to be able to detect
when the authentication is a local authentication, meaning the user is logging on via a ter-
minal, versus a remote login. Most systems provide this level of logging.Windows differenti-
ates the two based on the event ID, whereas in the UNIX world the logs are written by
different processes.
Because we are collecting the physical access records, ESM knows who is in and out of
the building. By collecting the events from servers around the organization, we can correlate
the fact that we have a local login with the fact that a user is either on-site or not.These data
sets allow us to catch users who are sharing accounts, and experience has shown that this is a
common occurrence that mostly gets brushed under the rug or is never detected to begin
with. In the next section, we will examine these two technologies in more detail and look at
some actual events generated by physical access control systems as well as VPN devices.
Data Sources
The following sections will give us a better understanding of the technologies that we will
be working with in this chapter.The two technology groups we will be looking at are
VPNs, followed by physical access systems. When we talk about the technologies, it’s impor-
tant to remember how the underlying technology works and the type of information that
can be retrieved by analyzing a log message generated by one of the products or type of
products we are looking at.
VPN Gateways
VPN refers to a concept rather than an actual piece of hardware or software. Many products
are called VPNs, but they are really just enablers that allow you to set up a virtual private

network.A VPN really can be described as the capability of a computer to act as part of
another network, typically a corporate infrastructure, when it is not physically connected.
VPNs are commonly used so that remote employees and people who travel can connect to
the corporate network to access services and data—typically, e-mail and ﬁle shares—that are
protected behind a ﬁrewall.This technology allows a user to connect to the Internet from
anywhere and access what’s known as the VPN gateway, or the site’s external IP address,
where there is a device that will allow the user access to the corporate network. VPN access
is managed by these devices that are typically just called VPNs, but these devices will be
referred to as VPN gateways.A VPN gateway is not always an appliance, but that is the
common form factor for ease of deployment and lack of installation.
The VPN gateway serves several purposes. It acts as a router to all of the users who are
connected and allows them to connect through it to get to other systems.The device also
provides encryption, which is a very important component of VPN technology.The end
user will, in most cases, have a client installed on his system which manages the connection
to the VPN gateway.All of the trafﬁc that passes between the client and the server is then
encrypted.This is a safeguard against snooping or capturing sensitive information using tools
such as tcpdump or Ethereal, as illustrated in Figure 14.1. VPN trafﬁc typically uses the
IPSec standard to encrypt all trafﬁc.The VPN client will do a key exchange with the
gateway using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, thus allowing all trafﬁc to be
encrypted over IPSec, or IP security. (For more information on IPSec, see
http://rfc.net/rfc2401.html.) The VPN gateway also provides a pool of IP addresses so that
the user’s system gets a new IP address that is used for all communications with other sys-
tems that are accessible on the network.This is typically known as the VPN address pool.

Figure 14.1 depicts a remote user making a connection both to a company’s external
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and servers that are accessible only from outside if con-
necting through a VPN gateway. It is very common for corporate users to access resources
using an Internet connection in a shared location such as Starbucks.This presents several
concerns.Attackers know users are accessing e-mail and documents, so they will sit in the
same areas where there are wireless access points and just collect trafﬁc.They will gather e-
mail passwords for most Internet mail providers that authenticate in clear text as well as any
other clear text communication such as downloading documents from an FTP server. Figure
14.1 shows what an attacker who is snooping trafﬁc on this network would see. First, the
FTP communication to the organization’s external server is unencrypted, so the attacker can
see all the trafﬁc.The second connection by the remote user to the VPN gateway is
encrypted using IPSec and the attacker cannot see any of the communication. Regardless of
the server or data that’s accessed behind the VPN, the user’s trafﬁc is encrypted, protecting
the company and the user from the snooping hacker.
More important than understanding how VPN gateways are networked together and
how they control trafﬁc is to understand how they authenticate the remote users.There are
several different ways this can be done; some are more secure than others.This brings us to
the topic of multifactor authentication and stand-alone user stores. We will start with a
simple example from a stand-alone Juniper Netscreen ﬁrewall/VPN. If the device is capable
of using multifactor authentication as well as connecting to a Remote Authentication Dial-
In User Service (RADIUS) server and doing two-factor one-time password (OTP) authenti-
cation, which we will look at in greater detail later.The real difference here from a log
collection standpoint concerns from where to collect the logs. If just one VPN gateway is
doing the entire authentication locally, it’s quite simple to get a syslog feed from that device.
We will look at two setups in this chapter: a Netscreen ﬁrewall/VPN with a local user store,
and multiple Juniper Netscreens conﬁgured to talk to open RADIUS. Open RADIUS is a
free RADIUS server that handles the authentication of onetime passwords, such as RSA
secureID tokens.
Juniper Netscreen: Local User Store
The Juniper Netscreen ﬁrewall/VPN in this section is conﬁgured using a local user store.
The process of creating local users is not the optimal way to manage a VPN environment.
The process involves creating a user account for each user and assigning a password.A setup
such as this would not scale at even a medium-size organization. Local user stores are okay if
you are creating a VPN for your home ofﬁce or a very small shop with less than 10 users.
Besides being difﬁcult to manage, they are not as secure as using two-factor authentication.
In this setup, there is just a username and a password. When using two-factor authentication,
a secondary authentication process is involved, making password guessing nearly impossible.
When using the VPN gateway for authentication and user management.You will want
to collect authentication records or events directly from the system.The Netscreen product
uses a standard syslog format for logging directly from the device. It can easily be conﬁgured
www.syngress.com
408
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

to send to any syslog server or, in this case, an ESM connector. Figure 14.2 shows how to
conﬁgure the syslog outputs.
Figure 14.2 Syslog Output Conﬁguration 
Before messages can be sent to ESM or a syslog server, the sending interface must be
selected. If the syslog server you are sending to is internal, you would probably use the trust
interface.Then you can select up to four different syslog destinations and the port on the
target system to which the messages should be sent.Typically, syslog uses User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) port 514. In this example, we are sending syslog messages to a syslog server
as well as an ESM connector.The conﬁguration also allows you to conﬁgure the facility with
which the messages will be tagged.The facility is useful for directing messages to a certain
location once they reach the syslog server. For example, if you want all security alerts in one
place, you can choose local2 and, on your syslog server, add an entry to the conﬁguration
ﬁle, /etc/syslog.conf, that directs all local2.* messages to a particular ﬁle. In the case of for-
warding to an ESM connector, it does not really matter because the messages are stored in
the backend database in the same way, regardless of the facility.
Log Format
Syslog messages are a very easy format to understand.They are easily parsed and typically
conform to standards that make reading and understanding them straightforward.The fol-
lowing message was sent to a syslog server and written to the ﬁlesystem:
Jan 13 19:21:51 device_name Juniper: 2007-1-13 19:21:50 - Employee -
user3(Admin
Users)[] - Login succeeded for user3/Admin Users from 192.168.50.51.
The preceding message is a successful authentication of an administrator logging directly
into the ﬁrewall/VPN. Starting from the beginning of the message, we see a standard syslog
header that is applied to almost all syslog messages.These ﬁelds include a date/timestamp, the
sending device (either hostname or IP address, depending on whether domain name system
[DNS] is conﬁgured properly), and the process or vendor that generated the message. If you
look at syslog messages on a UNIX server, the fourth ﬁeld from the left, above where it says
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
409

juniper, would indicate the process that’s writing the message—for example, sshd. Next, we
have the timestamp, which is the actual time the logon happened.This can be different from
the syslog server timestamp, depending on network latency.The next important ﬁeld is the
username, which is always an extremely important ﬁeld, maybe the most important because
it provides user context. Without this information, we wouldn’t know who is actually log-
ging onto the system.After the username, we can see the user’s permissions, or the group
that the user is in. In this case, it is Admin Users.The log ends with the message, but in this
case, the message contains some additional information that needs to be parsed out. Here we
see not only the username repeated, but also the source from which the user logged in.
Having changing data in the message makes for a more difﬁcult parsing process.You not
only need to capture and extract that information, but also hardcode the event name to a
value that won’t have changing data in it.This may not make complete sense, but assuming
we want to make a report that counts unique event names, it would look something like
Table 14.1.
Table 14.1 Event Name Counts: Accurate
Event Name
Count
Logon Success
1972
Logon Failure
72
This is event3
21
Now, these event names, once in ESM, are static; they don’t have moving parts. So, if we
populate the event name ﬁeld with a value that has changing data, the report will give us
inaccurate results.Table 14.2 shows how it would look if we left the source address and user-
name in the event name ﬁeld.
Table 14.2 Inaccurate: Unparsed Messages
Event Name
Count
Login succeeded for user3/Admin Users from 192.168.50.51
1900
Login succeeded for user2/Admin Users from 192.168.50.51
36
Login succeeded for user3/Admin Users from 192.168.50.52
34
This is event3
21
The example in Table 14.2 really should show us one row for “Login succeeded” with a
count of 1972. We can see that the source IP address changes once and the usernames
change once. So, this changes our report where the query is returning unexpected results
from the database.The database is responding correctly, but because there is changing data in
the even name ﬁeld, the results change when one of the values changes.This is why each
type of information in a log output should have its own ﬁeld.This, of course, is solved when
www.syngress.com

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

using a connector to send the data to ESM, because the ﬁelds can be hardcoded. Further, if
the intent of the report was to get a count of logins by user or per source, this can be
accomplished by adding an additional column for either the source or the user and grouping
by event name and username.
The next log entry shows a successful VPN access through the gateway.This is one of
the messages that feeds our use cases. If we have a user who is physically in the building, we
should never see a message like this from his user account, because a user should not be in
the building physically and accessing the network from a remote location:
Jan 13 19:23:09 device_name Juniper: 2007-1-13 19:23:08 - Employee -
user1(Authentication Servers)[Full Access_IS Only] - Login succeeded for user1
from 1.1.1.1
One of the other issues surrounding the use of a local user store when trying to correlate
VPN authentication events with other types of logs is the fact that the user accounts are not
necessarily in line with the rest of the domain. In other words, a user’s VPN gateway ID may
be Steve and his Windows logon ID may be stevej or something to that effect. (We will dis-
cuss the challenges with each of these platforms and correlation a little later in the chapter.)
The format of these logs messages is very simple and easy to map into a comprehensive ESM
schema. In the next section, we will look at how these messages would look in ESM.
From Logs to ESM
As we have discussed, the logs generated by the Netscreen ﬁrewall/VPN are in a syslog
format.This makes connecting to ESM very simple. We can choose a number of ways to get
the data.The simplest way is to point the device’s syslog output to an ESM Syslog Daemon
Connector.This type of connector acts like a syslog server, but instead of writing the mes-
sages out to a ﬁle, they are sent directly to ESM. Some organizations, however, don’t like this
method, because you don’t get the original message stored anywhere except within ESM. In
these cases, a syslog ﬁle connector can be used which will read the messages from a ﬁle that’s
being written on a syslog server.The connector basically tails the ﬁle and passes the newly
written event to the ESM platform.
Once the collection mechanism is ﬁgured out, we just need to map the ﬁelds to the
ESM schema.Table 14.3 takes the successful authentication log from the previous section
and maps it to the appropriate ﬁelds. Here is the message once again:
Jan 13 19:23:09 device_name Juniper: 2007-1-13 19:23:08 - Employee -
user1(Authentication Servers)[Full Access_IS Only] - Login succeeded for user1
from 1.1.1.1

As you can see, the mappings are very simple. Starting with the event name we normalize
the name to be Login Succeeded and put the original time into the time ﬁeld. Next, we put
the device name or IP address into a device ﬁeld and populate the vendor and product ﬁelds
with the appropriate values.The ﬁeld of interest, of course, is the username ﬁeld, and we of
course map that to the target username ﬁeld. It is important to remember that when dealing
with usernames, the account that’s being authenticated to should always be the target user.We
don’t really know from the message who is using the account, so we wouldn’t put it in the
source user ﬁeld.The source is mostly unknown, except in the case of events such as an su
from one account to another, in which case we know the user who initiated the command
because it’s part of the log message.This is something to keep in mind when doing event anal-
ysis; you rarely know who actually did something. Even with strong authentication, it’s not
guaranteed that the actor who is authenticating is really the owner of the user account.The
next section looks at a more common implementation of a VPN gateway and the authentica-
tion mechanisms that are typically used, known as multifactor authentication.
Tri–D Systems
As mentioned, we are now going to look at a more common deployment practice where a
centralized user store or user management component is accessed for authentication rather
than a local or per-device user store.This setup allows multiple VPN gateways to be
deployed, all sharing the same user store.This is commonly implemented with a technology
known as a RADIUS server.This implementation will still use the same Juniper VPN
gateway, except it will be using three-factor authentication provided via a smart card pro-
duced by Tri-D Systems.The logging mechanism will also be a little different, as we don’t
have to collect the logs from each VPN gateway, but rather from the process that is talking to
the user store and authenticating the user.
A topology of this deployment shows the basic components. It is important to under-
stand the different systems and processes involved. Figure 14.2 shows a typical three-factor
authentication setup using a Juniper ﬁrewall/VPN,Tri-D Systems Biometric Three-Factor
Proximity cards,Tri-D Systems One-Time Password Daemon (OTPD), and Free Radius, an
open source RADIUS server.

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

Figure 14.3 shows how a multifactor authentication setup works.The VPN gateways are
conﬁgured to authenticate VPN users via the RADIUS server rather than using a local user
store.The user on the Internet is attempting to connect to the corporate network through
the gateway.The user has a Tri-D three-factor smart card that generates a onetime password
when he places his ﬁngerprint on the card and the ﬁngerprint is matched. Figure 14.4 shows
the card that each VPN user in the organization has.
Figure 14.3 Centralized User Authentication Using Radius 
The card shown in Figure 14.4 is manufactured by Tri-D Systems and is used for a
number of purposes—one of which is to gain access to the building via the physical access
card readers—but the feature we are focusing on for this section is the capability of the card
to generate a one-time password based on the user’s ﬁngerprint being matched by the built-in
ﬁngerprint reader. In Figure 14.4, the ﬁngerprint reader is located above the seal of the
United States Department of State.The user places his ﬁnger on the reader and upon a posi-
tive match the card displays a one-time password indicated in the middle of the card.This
number, along with the user’s login credentials and a PIN number, are sent from the VPN
client software to the RADIUS server, which then conﬁrms the password and the PIN with
the one-time password daemon that is running on the OTP server in Figure 14.3.This is
probably the most secure setup that can be deployed and it provides multiple layers of protec-
tion.The card has to be in the user’s possession.The person attempting to get the one-time
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14

password has to match his ﬁngerprint just to get the ever-changing password.The user also
has to know the username and the PIN in order for the OTP daemon to authenticate the
account and instruct the RADIUS server to allow access via the VPN gateway. Figure 14.5
shows how this process would look to a user attempting to access the corporate network.
Figure 14.4 Multifactor Smart Card from Tri-D Systems 
Figure 14.5 Multifactor Authentication Process 
www.syngress.com
414
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

As you can see in Figure 14.5, the user must place his ﬁnger on the ﬁngerprint reader
and upon a successful match the one-time password is displayed. Once the password is dis-
played, the user must enter that password, along with his static PIN combined with his user-
name. Once he enters the information, the gateway will make a call to the RADIUS server,
which in turn passes the credentials to the OTP daemon.At this point, access is either
granted or denied.The best part about this setup from an event analysis perspective is the
centralized logging provided by the OTP server. We now have one place that aggregates all
VPN authentication information for us. In the next section, we will look at the logging
format and options available from Tri-D Systems’ OTP server.
Log Format
The OTP daemon uses syslog as its logging facility.This again makes connecting to it very
simple from an ESM perspective.As discussed previously, we can either use a ﬁle-based reader
or send the syslog directly to an ESM connector listening on UDP port 514. Building a parser
for the messages is also quite simple, and if using ArcSight, there is even an option within the
OTP server to conﬁgure the output to be in common event format (CEF). CEF is an open
standard used for log messages that ArcSight published in the community to ease the format-
ting problems that vendors face.We will discuss the CEF standard and log output in detail later
in this section.
All of the logs are preﬁxed with the function name.This is to aid debugging and doesn’t
really add information for the user.This explains the way the messages start; each message is
also preceded by the standard syslog header.
The two most common and important log messages are:
Jan 17 21:22:52 device_name verify: user [bob] authentication succeeded
Jan 17 21:22:26 device_name verify: user [bob] authentication failed
The failed message happens only when the PIN and the one-time password combination
are wrong. It does not occur for other types of errors—for instance, if the user does not exist
in the user store. If a user doesn’t exist, the following message will be generated:
Jan 17 21:23:01 device_name ﬁle_get: /etc/otppasswd: [bob] not found
Some other important logs might precede the success or failure log message:
Jan 17 21:24:36 device_name verify: bad sync auth for [bob]: valid but in
hardfail (6/5 failed/max)
This occurs if the user has more consecutive failures than the OTPD hardfail setting.This
causes the user to be locked out.The log message indicates that the user’s PIN and one-time
password were correct, but they’ve been rejected for exceeding the hardfail setting. In this
case, they’ve had six consecutive failures, but only ﬁve are allowed.This auth failure also
increments the consecutive failure count, even though the PIN and one-time password were
correct.Administrator intervention is required to allow the user to ever log in again.
In order to understand these next three messages, you have to understand the softfail
system. Softfail enforces a delay after n consecutive failures, during which time the user
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
415

cannot log in.The delay starts at one minute (when softfail consecutive failures have been
reached) and doubles for every subsequent consecutive failure, up to 32 minutes. Every new
failure restarts the clock, so if there were ﬁve failures in a row (that is, ﬁve above the softfail
setting), one “immediately” after the other, a mandatory lockout delay of 16 minutes would
be imposed, not 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 minutes. If just before the lockout expired another
failed authentication occurs, the clock would start over with a 32-minute lockout.
In order to overcome this, the user can either wait for the lockout period to expire, or
enter two consecutive correct pass codes, which “overrides” the delay period.The idea is that
any one pass code might be guessable, but guessing two consecutive pass codes is essentially
impossible.
Jan 17 21:29:53 device_name
verify: bad sync auth for [bob]: valid but in
softfail (6/5 failed/max)
The preceding is similar to the hardfail log message, but instead this one indicates that
the user has exceeded the softfail threshold. It would have been preceded by ﬁve verify: user
[bob] authentication failed messages because this is the sixth failure.This message also indicates
that the sixth failure came within one minute of the ﬁfth failure.
The point of the softfail messages is to help discriminate between users that are having
some user interface issues with the one-time password token or maybe have forgotten their
PIN, versus a password guessing attack.A password guessing attack would not wait for the
time delay and would continue the failed authentication attempts; therefore, the account
would be locked out.
The preceding messages were all generated using the OTP server’s default logging
facility, but the OTP server can also output syslog messages in ArcSight CEF format.As
mentioned earlier, the CEF format is an open standard released by ArcSight to improve the
interoperability of infrastructure devices through enhanced alignment of technology vendors
regarding their logging infrastructure. CEP allows vendors to format their log messages in a
standard way so that custom parsers don’t need to be built.The standard is not limited to
ArcSight; it can be used by any vendor that wants to build a parser which parses the output.
Vendor adoption has started and a handful of companies have adopted the logging format.
The following is from a whitepaper released by ArcSight describing the CEF format:
Common Event Format:
The goal is to deﬁne a very simple event format that can be
adopted by vendors of both security and non-security devices. It
should contain the most relevant information and make it easy for
event consumers to parse and consume events.
www.syngress.com
416
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

For ease of integration, we are using syslog as a transport mecha-
nism. This has the effect that a common preﬁx is added to each mes-
sage, containing the date and hostname:
Jan 18 11:07:53 device message
If an event producer does not have the capability to write syslog
messages, it is possible to write the events to a ﬁle. In this case, the
syslog header needs to be omitted and the message starts with the
format deﬁned hereafter.
This part of the message does not have to be generated explicitly by
the event producer! The remaining part of the log format is for-
matted using a common preﬁx comprised of ﬁelds delimited by a
bar (‘|’) character. The preﬁx is mandatory and all the speciﬁed ﬁelds
need to be present. Additional ﬁelds are then reported as part of
the Extension. This is the format:
CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Signature
Id|Name|Severity|Extension
The Extension part of the message is a placeholder for additional
ﬁelds. Those ﬁelds are documented in the Event Dictionary below
are logged as key-value pairs.
The meaning of the preﬁx ﬁelds is as follows:
Version is an integer and identiﬁes the version of the CEF format.
Event consumers will use this information to determine what the
following ﬁelds represent. Currently only version 0 is standardized in
the form outlined above. The future might show that other ﬁelds
need to be added to the “preﬁx” and therefore require the change
in version number. The addition of new formats is handled through
the standard body.
Device Vendor, Device Product and Device Version are strings which
uniquely identify the sending device type. No two products must use
the same pair of device vendor and device product. There is no cen-
tral authority managing these pairs. Event producers should make
sure that their name assignment creates a unique pair.
Signature ID is a unique identiﬁer per event type. This could be a
string or an integer. The signature ID identiﬁes the type of event
reported. In the intrusion detection system (IDS) world, each signature
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
417

or rule that detects certain activity, has a unique signature ID
assigned. For other types of devices this becomes a requirement as
well and helps correlation engines to deal with the events.
Name is a string representing a human readable and understand-
able description of this event. The event name should not contain
information that is mentioned in speciﬁc ﬁelds. For example: “Port
scan from 10.0.0.1 targeting 20.1.1.1” is not a good event name. It
should be: “Port scan”. The other information is redundant and can
be gained from investigating other ﬁelds.
Severity is an integer and reﬂects the importance of this event. Only
numbers between 0 and 10 are allowed, where 10 indicates a very
important event. This number is later used and fed into the Event
Scoring standard discussed below.
Extension is a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are part of a
predeﬁned set. The standard allows for the inclusion of additional
keys as outlined later. An event can contain any number of key-
value pairs in any order, separated by spaces (“ “). If a ﬁeld contains
a space, such as a ﬁle name, this is okay and can be logged in
exactly that manner. For example: ﬁleName=c:\Program
Files\ArcSight is a valid token.
To illustrate, a sample message looks as follows:
Sep 19 08:26:10 device CEF:0|security|threatmanager|1.0|100|worm successfully
stopped|10|src=10.0.0.1 dst=2.1.2.2 spt=1232
The CEF standard is hopefully going to gain more traction moving forward as compa-
nies realize that an extensible common format is an enabler, not only for ArcSight but also
the community in general. If we look at the previous messages generated by the OTP server
as output in CEF, we can see that it is very easy to understand what the values mean and
they are very easy to parse because of the key value pairs:
Here are the non-CEF messages:
verify: user [bob] authentication succeeded
verify: user [bob] authentication failed
ﬁle_get: /etc/otppasswd: [bob] not found
verify: bad sync auth for [bob]: valid but in hardfail (6/5 failed/max)
verify: bad sync auth for [bob]: valid but in softfail (6/5 failed/max)
And here are the same messages in CEF format:
Jan 19 08:26:10 otpserver CEF:0|Tri-D Systems|OTP Server|1.0|verify1|
Authentication Successful|2|tuser=bob
www.syngress.com

Jan 19 08:26:10 otpserver CEF:0|Tri-D Systems|OTP Server|1.0|verify4|Auth Valid
but Softfail|8|tuser=bob
CEF is the preferred method when integrating with the OTP server. It makes the
parsing trivial and allows the messages to be sent to any CEF-compatible collector without
any additional work.The ﬁeld mappings are also predeﬁned as part of the standard, so the
mapping is already done as part of the message. We see one of these messages mapped to the
ESM schema in Table 14.4.

The ﬁelds in Table 14.4 represent the mapping from the OTP server to the ESM
schema. Most of the mappings are straightforward. It is fairly obvious where the name and
the time would map.The user is another easy ﬁeld to map; it goes to the target user because
it is the account that is being authenticated to.As we discussed earlier, we don’t really know
the actor or person who is actually using the account, so we have no information regarding
the source user.The device vendor and product are self-explanatory, as is the version.The ID
is a unique identiﬁer for this particular event type, meaning that if this were an authentica-
tion failure, there would be a different value for ID.The severity has a value of 8, which will
be normalized to a value of high within ESM.
Two of the different ways in which to set up a VPN authentication system: a local user
store and through authentication via a multifactor biometrics authentication system using
Tri-D Systems and Free Radius. We have looked at two methods of logging, with the syslog
messages being sent directly from the gateway device and using the OTP server as an aggre-
gation point.The VPN authentication events are a crucial part of our use case.

PACS come in all shapes and sizes, and from many different vendors, but they all accomplish
a similar task in a similar fashion. Some of the more common systems are swipe card systems
that use a magnetic stripe on a card, similar to a credit card.The card is swiped through the
reader and a door or a turnstile is unlocked, allowing access.Another common system is the
proximity reader, in which the user caries either a card or a small keychain locking device,
known as a key fob.The user places the fob close enough to the proximity reader so that it
can read the signal from the fob, thus granting access. Some readers handle the authentica-
tion at the reader level, and other readers have no intelligence other than asking a centralized
management server to either allow or deny access. Either way, there is always a centralized
management platform to push updated conﬁgurations to the readers or to handle the actual
authentication. Figure 14.6 shows a simple topology of how this would be set up.
Figure 14.6 Simple Physical Access Setup 
In Figure 14.6, the central picture represents a campus, home to the average corpora-
tion. Each checkered keypad represents a door with a physical access reader present to allow
access to the protected area. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd not only external badge readers, but
many readers located inside the building that are not accessible by all employees. Some
buildings have access readers on the elevators to allow access to particular ﬂoors, and some
allow you to get off the elevator but have locked doors at either end of the hallway. (Think
of server rooms or accounting ﬂoors; just because you may have general building access does
not mean you have access to all areas within the building.)

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

In Figure 14.6, there are several external readers and several internal readers; access to
the penthouse and roof is limited to a select few. Each reader is connected to the access
server over a private IP network.This is a major breakthrough for most physical security
products. Only recently has IP been considered for use as a communication protocol by
physical security vendors, and some still have not adopted it. Rather than use IP, they use
serial connections and obscure protocols such as Weigand. Weigand has been the de facto
standard in the physical security world, used to communicate among a wide variety of
devices including ﬁre alarms, PACS, and numerous other sensors. But it is slowly starting to
be phased out as newer technology companies push IP-based protocols for communication.
Proximity readers are the most common form of PACS; biometric readers are becoming
more prevalent but have really not become as popular yet and are typically used in combina-
tion with proximity readers. We will refer to the proximity card as a fob. Each fob has a serial
number or an ID that is associated with a particular user.This is the credential that is passed
to the reader for authentication.The way the ID is read is simple.The fob transmits the ID
to the reader using a radio frequency.The reader is always generating an electromagnetic
ﬁeld, and when the fob comes within range, the internal coil generates enough electricity to
power a chip that transmits the ID or serial number. Several different protocols can be used
for this communication.The ﬁrst widely used protocol for PACS is known as prox, devel-
oped but HID Corporation, the 900-pound gorilla of the physical access control system
space. HID sells the hardware that allows other companies to have a card that will talk to a
reader using its protocols. In addition, HID sells the chips and readers to other manufacturers
(the company is considered to be an OEM in the physical access control space).
The prox protocol lasted for a while, but it is severely ﬂawed in terms of security.The
ID is stored in clear text (unencrypted) on the card.This opens up a whole can of worms. If
you have ever seen presentations regarding radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) readers and
how RFID tags can be read and written with free software tools, this isn’t much different.
(Google “Lukas Grunwald of DN-Systems” and you will ﬁnd some very interesting informa-
tion about the security or lack thereof surrounding RFID.) Because this is just a different
frequency than that used in RFID, the hacks are quite similar. If you build an electromag-
netic ﬁeld that’s strong enough, you can get the clear text serial number off an unsuspecting
employee’s fob. Once you have the ID, you can simply program it onto another fob and then
use it to access any door to which the serial number has access. Because prox was such a
security risk, HID invented a new protocol called iClass. With iClass, each serial number is
encrypted; before the key is transmitted to the reader and in order to be read, a key
exchange occurs.This process is based on public key encryption and has become the stan-
dard for most new PACS.
Once a proximity card is placed within range of a reader, the serial number from the fob
is read and, depending on the setup, either the reader or the authentication control server
grants or denies access. If access is granted, the reader sends the door lock an electric signal
triggering the lock to be opened. In most cases, the communication between the reader and
the lock uses the Weigand protocol.The Weigand protocol continues to be one of the most
commonly used protocols in the physical security world.

When the authentication request occurs and the user is either granted or denied access,
the server will write a record of the transaction, usually to a backend database so that records
can be pulled regarding who accessed the building and to which part of the building access
was granted.This is where we want to connect to get the data needed to realize our goal of
detecting account sharing through convergence.
In the next section, we will look in detail at a physical access control system that will
provide us all the information we need.The product is built by a smaller company, called
Keri Systems, which produces an application built to manage components that are OEM’d
from HID. Remember that in most cases, the actual electronics that are reading the fobs and
the chips in the fobs are OEM’d, or the hardware technology is licensed and distributed with
the controlling software. Some other common and less accessible products that you will see
in the industry are GE Picture Perfect, Lenel OnGuard, and a number of others from ven-
dors such as Honeywell and Siemens.
Keri Systems: Doors
Keri Systems designs and sells a number of products that are used for physical access. It sells
proximity readers, proximity fobs, biometrics tools, and telephone access systems.The
product we are concerned with in this chapter is used to control and administer physical
access devices.This software application is called Doors.
Doors is used to conﬁgure and manage Keri’s physical access controllers. Doors runs on
Windows and all of the communications with the readers is done via the Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Doors has all of the functionality that’s
expected from a PACS. It provides multiple site administrators with different levels of con-
trol, and it accommodates holiday schedules and times when actual doors should open and
lock. From the user interface, you can open and lock doors as well as get a status of all the
controllers that have been entered into the system. More important, it includes built-in mon-
itoring and logging capabilities.
Doors also includes an option to either collect or not collect the logs from the readers.
Obviously, in the event and log analysis business, we will want to collect everything we can
from everywhere possible. For storage purposes, there are options to ﬁlter which events are
actually persisted to the disk as well as which events the controllers or readers will even send.
The methodology Doors uses to collect logs, though, is quite primitive.A buffer is included
on the readers, and when it becomes full, the events are sent to Doors. Further, the actual
console has to be open at the time.This is not a good way for logging to be implemented
when the idea is to do real-time analysis. In this case, if you have a low-trafﬁc reader, it could
take days or even weeks to ﬁll up the buffer, and that would be drastic in our use case. Not
only is there a lack of real-time information when there are low-trafﬁc readers, but also the
application actually has to be open.This seems like it is prone to problems. If an admin closes
the application after making a change, adding a user, or doing something similar, access
records will no longer be available until the application is reopened. It’s unlikely that the
events-logging mechanism would have built-in fault tolerance.Although the mechanisms

used for reporting are not quite up to par, some of the intelligence that is built into the log-
ging is great, as you will see shortly.
The console comes with its own event viewer, which you can use to view the latest
events coming into the system. Figure 14.7shows the view an operator would have within
Doors. Many different events are generated, so at least an operator can apply some ﬁltering
based on event name.
Figure 14.7 Keri Doors: Operator View 
The system can generate 160 different types of messages, some more important to a
security organization than others. We will focus on the nonadministrative task messages.
Numerous messages are generated for the addition of new users, permission changes, and
new access being granted to a user, and these are all great events to have, but not very rele-
vant for this chapter.The conﬁguration management and user management events would fall
perfectly into a compliance scenario where any type of authorization changes and permis-
sion changes should be monitored and reported. Some of the interesting events are described
in the following list, which comes from the product documentation available online at
www.kerisys.com/pages/download/techdocs.asp#doors-tech.
Under each event is a secondary description that we added to explain why these events
are of interest to an analyst focused on convergence:
■
Access By User ID Denied Reported whenever an invalid User ID is entered
into the EntraGuard controller in an attempt to gain access to a controlled door.
This event can be used similar to a failed login.This event refers to a keypad
entry system where the ID being entered is invalid. If this behavior repeats, it
could be considered a brute force attempt.
■
Access By User ID Granted Reported whenever a valid User ID is entered
into the EntraGuard controller, which then grants the user access to a controlled
door.
This event can be used to track building or room access and would work with
either of our use cases.

Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
423

■
Access Denied Reported whenever an invalid card is presented to a door/con-
troller in an attempt to gain access to a controlled area.
An access denied message could signify that someone is trying random cards
on facility doors because the message indicated that the card is not valid—not that
the particular card doesn’t have access to a particular area but that the card itself is
invalid.
■
Access Denied (Access Group Violation) Reported whenever a card is pre-
sented to a reader that is assigned an access group that is not given permission to
access that door.
Access Denied Group Violation can be used to look for internal reconnais-
sance attempts. If a user is poking around trying to determine which rooms or
doors he has access to, this could be considered an early warning indicator of an
internal threat.
■
Access Denied (Expiration Violation) Reported whenever a card is presented
to a reader after the expiration date has passed.
This log entry could indicate that a contractor or an employee who is no
longer with the organization kept his card and is attempting to gain access to the
facility.
■
Access Denied (Reader Locked Out) Reported whenever a Primary ID and
Secondary ID combination has been entered incorrectly six times in a row and the
reader/keypad is locked out for the period of time preset on the System Options
Tab in Doors.
This sounds like a classic username/password guessing attempt. It is good that
there is a conﬁgurable lockout for such activity.This could indicate a forgotten
PIN, or it could be a lost primary ID and an attacker is attempting to guess the
PIN. (This is one reason not to put company information on badges; if they get
lost, the attacker knows right where to go.)
■
Access Granted  Reported whenever a valid card is presented to a door/con-
troller, which then grants the user access to a controlled area.
This is our classic successful building access and will work with our scenarios.
■
APB Violation  Reported whenever a card was used twice in a row at a door in
an attempt to gain access to a secured area without ﬁrst leaving that area.This pre-
vents a user from using a valid card to enter a controlled area and then passing that
card back for another person to use to enter that area.
CORRELATION: This is great. It’s a reverse piggyback. It’s an example of correlating
the fact that the user never left. Of course, this would have to be done in an environment
where a one-badge/one-entry system is in place, as well as an egress exit system. Egress
means the user has to badge out to exit the room as well. We will discuss these scenarios
later in the chapter.
www.syngress.com
424
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

■
Door Closed  Reported whenever a door closes following a valid access request.
This is an interesting event because it can be used in a correlation rule to
determine whether a door has been propped open. If there is a Door Open event
and if this event doesn’t follow within n time, a user could be trying to prop open
a door, to possibly move something large out of the facility.
■
Door Forced Open  Reported if a door has been forced open without a valid
access request having been made.
This is obviously something that should be investigated.
■
Door Not Opened  Reported if a door is not opened within the Unlock Time
following a valid access request.
This is a suspicious event, or it’s completely normal.The suspicion would arise
if one user continuously does this to multiple doors.The user may be attempting
to map out what he has access to. On the other hand, this could simply be a user
who was going to go into a room and his friend walked by, so he changed his
mind and started talking for long enough that the timeout expired.
■
Door Opened Too Long  Reported if a door is held open beyond the Open
Time following a valid access request.
Again, this event could indicate an attempt to remove something from the
facility because the door has been opened for longer than a set amount of time.
These are just a few of the 160-plus events that the Doors application can generate. It
can generate many other events, mostly concerning conﬁguration changes and administrative
tasks that don’t really play into this scenario. Let’s segue into looking at the format of these
messages as reported by Doors, and how we capture and send them to the ESM platform.
Log Format
The following sample logs are a mockup of what sample logs from Doors would look like.
The logs are written in a rotating text ﬁle with comma-delimited values which make the
messages very easy to parse.The general idea is that between each comma there is a ﬁeld
with a value in it that needs to be parsed and mapped to a ﬁeld in the ESM schema. When
the values are comma–separated, it is very easy to build a regular expression that will parse
the messages, making the job of building the connector quite simple.
Some of the log messages will have a user ID and others will not. For example, a mes-
sage regarding a door being pried open will not have a user ID because the system does not
know the user who has pried or forced the door open. For an event regarding a successful or
failed access attempt, a user ID will be present. However, most of the events still have a door
or location ID.This can be useful when tracking a user’s access through the facility. We will
look at some example visualizations of this in the next section.

2007 Jan 21 9:00,Door Forced Open, ,fac3-door3
The log format as it was described is very simple.The ﬁrst ﬁeld is the timestamp, or
when the event occurred.The time is in military time, using a 24-hour clock.The second
value is the event that occurred, such as access granted.The third value, if present, is the user
ID or serial number from the fob used to access the building.The last value is the door that
was accessed, as labeled by the system administrator.The labels typically describe the facility
and the exact door. In this case, the facility is fac1 and fac3 and the doors are represented by
door2 and door3.These values are conﬁgurable, so the naming convention will not always be
the same.
As a side note, the preceding combination of events is quite interesting.The ﬁrst two
events indicate a user sharing his access card because we see an access granted to fac1-door2,
and then an ABP violation on the same door, meaning that the card was used again before it
ever badged out of a secure area.This probably happened because the user entered a secured
area, and handed his card to a coworker to gain access later on.This is a violation because
there is now no accountability for who actually entered other areas using that card.The
second two events look like someone, probably not a current employee, used a disabled card,
and after it didn’t work, he forced the door open.This would obviously be a direct violation.
These events are great sources of information.Table 14.5 shows how these events would map
to the ESM schema.

The use of custom ﬁelds in ﬁeld mapping is crucial.The ability to dynamically extend
the ESM schema is what makes log collection from such disparate devices possible. If you
had to think of the entire schema before you knew what devices you were going to collect
data from, your job would be nearly impossible.This is where an extendable schema is
invaluable. Further, because these events are typically talking about access that is similar to
logical access, they fall right into the ESM event categorization taxonomy where you could
categorize a physical access success event in the following categories:
Object: /Building/Room
Behavior: /Authentication/Verify
Outcome: /Success
Signiﬁcance: /Informational
Device Group: /Physical Acess System
www.syngress.com
426
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

The preceding example shows that the event is talking about a successful authentication
to a room within a building reported by a physical access system, and it’s considered an
informational event.This taxonomy allows an ESM user to quickly drill into an investigation
or build a report. If the goal is to ﬁnd all successful authentications, the simple ﬁlter would
be Behavior=/Authentication/Verify and the Outcome=/Success.This will return all successful
accesses regardless of the reporting system; another invaluable capability provided by an ESM
platform. In the next section, we will see how these events look in ESM and look at some
visual displays used for tracking user access.
From Logs to ESM
The next couple of ﬁgures show the events from the previous section once they have been
sent to ESM via a connector.The view in Figure 14.8 is a channel view that an analyst
would use to monitor real-time events coming into the system or to launch a forensics
investigation.
Figure 14.8 Live Events: Keri Doors to ESM 
Figure 14.8 shows us the earlier event, but in the ESM console.The top two events are
reported because a badge was used to access a secure area twice before the user left.This may
be an indication of a piggybacking attempt.These events have a slightly higher priority and
are categorized as Suspicious.They are not categorized as Hostile or Compromise, but they
should be investigated. Following these two events are four access granted events, meaning
someone successfully entered fac1-door2.The last two events are triggered when a door is
forced open when it hasn’t been unlocked.This is considered a compromise and should be
investigated immediately.
Figure 14.9 show a visual representation of physical access events.The graph shows you
who accessed the area in the past day, and lets you track users who are hanging out together.
With a visual representation of this data, it’s easy to draw conclusions without drudging
through hundreds or thousands of log entries.

Figure 14.9 Location Visualization (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Visual event analysis is one of the easiest ways to ﬁnd a needle in a haystack when trying
to draw conclusions using human interpretation. Looking at lines of log ﬁles will take hours,
if not days, to see what one simple graph can show you. It’s true that a picture is worth a
thousand log lines. Figure 14.9 shows only successful physical access events.The darker
squares are the users, represented by their user IDs or the serial numbers of their physical
access fobs.The circular nodes are the door readers that granted the users access (or, in a
well-labeled setup, the actual rooms or building entrances).The white box in the middle is
the event name, tying all the events together and showing that we are looking at physical
access events.
In Figure 14.9 we see several interesting patterns.The one that stands out the most is in
the upper-left corner.This looks like a number of users going into what appears to be a
meeting room.This is very useful to know if you’re trying to determine the groups of users
who collaborate with each other.At the far right on the bottom we see a single user and the
different locations he has accessed today.This is not extremely interesting, because only three
doors are being accessed, but if there were 20 or 30, this could be considered anomalous
behavior that should be investigated.The nodes at the top right represent a possible miscon-
ﬁguration, or a card that may have been duplicated or copied, because from looking at the
doors that were accessed, it appears that one was to the main entrance to a New York ofﬁce,
one in California, and one in Chicago.This would be a card that should probably be turned
www.syngress.com
428
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

off and other accesses should be investigated. Similar useful information can be obtained
from the reverse of this method—in other words, graphing all the failures. In that scenario, if
you see one user failing to access multiple locations, it could indicate reconnaissance activity.
Now that we have looked at some real examples of physical access events, we are going
to move on to some of the challenges that organizations face.The challenges deal not only
with organizational issues, but also technological issues.
Challenges
This section addresses some of the challenges organizations face when trying to integrate
PACS system logs with an ESM platform.Although these challenges exist, they can all be
addressed if the appropriate support for the program is in place and the right products are
being used.
Piggybacking
Piggybacking is a challenge that many organizations face when trying to determine who is
in the building. Piggybacking describes the situation in which one user authenticates but
holds the door open so that users can enter at the same time.This is a common occurrence,
especially during busy hours such as lunch hour. Imagine coming back from lunch around
1:00 and 30 people are trying to get back into the building.You authenticate using your key
fob; are you going to close the door on the people who are standing right behind you?
Probably not. More likely, you will hold the door and many people will enter, even though
only one was authenticated. Herein lies a signiﬁcant problem. No longer is there a record of
who is actually in the building at any one time. If a social engineer (someone who is
attempting to sneak into a building) wants to gain access to a facility, what better time than
the lunchtime rush.Another threat comes from smokers, one of the easiest groups with
which to socially gain access to a corporation. Smokers always have an area where they
smoke outside of the building, and they have a code.A fellow smoker can bum or borrow a
cigarette, lighter, or hitch a ride into the building, all within the time it takes to have a
couple of puffs. Smoking areas should be heavily monitored using video analytics technology
and warnings should be posted reminding smokers that strangers should not be allowed
access to the building.
Piggybacking is a very difﬁcult problem to address and it exists at almost any corpora-
tion. Some extremely secure areas use airlocks to ensure that only one person at a time
passes thorough an entryway.An airlock is a passageway with two doors.The user authenti-
cates; as they enter the airlock, the door closes behind them.The user is now standing on a
scale, and if the weight is more than one person should weigh, access is not be granted
through the second door.These types of systems also detect servers being removed from data
centers, as well as the removal of other equipment.Although useful, airlock systems are not
very widely deployed and typically are deployed only in extremely secure areas.
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
429

Another solution to piggybacking is the concept of turnstiles, where users who enter a
building have to authenticate at an individual turnstile.This means that a badge is required
for the turnstile to turn, and it will turn only once, which prevents other users from fol-
lowing the authenticated user into the building.Turnstiles are more common than airlocks,
but they still aren’t a guaranteed solution because many times a side gate is available for users
who forgot their cards, or for contractors and visitors. Visitors also present a tough problem.
Visitors are usually not issued a fob, so there is no accountability regarding where they are or
who they are.Typically policies are in place which say visitors must be escorted at all times,
but as you can imagine, this is not always the case. Chapter 16 discusses some emerging
video analytics technologies that are being designed to detect piggybacking attempts. One of
the use cases that can be achieved with PACS logs that we will be discussing can also be an
indicator of people who are piggybacking because a physical access event hasn’t occurred,
but the user is accessing a computer within the building from a local console.This would
deﬁnitely point to a user who didn’t badge in or a user who has shared his account.
Egress
This section addresses a term used commonly in the logical security world to describe IP
trafﬁc that is leaving a network or a protected environment. Egress ﬁltering is used to
describe the blocking of trafﬁc that is not allowed to leave, typically done on border routers
or ﬁrewalls. In the physical security world, the term egress refers to physical access systems
that require users to badge out of a protected location as well as in. In most cases, if the user
doesn’t swipe his badge on the way out, he will not be allowed back into the building when
he returns.This is a great system and should be the norm, but unfortunately, it isn’t. Most
companies don’t implement this type of system because it’s too much trouble to reactivate
the cards, but employees learn quickly.
The reason this is such a great idea is because if the goal is to know who is currently in
the building at any one time, information is needed as to when users leave. It may be a
common occurrence for a particular user—probably in sales or another traveling depart-
ment—to come into the ofﬁce for a meeting and then hit the road. We get an event saying
he entered the building at 9:00, but we never see the fact that he left the building by 11:30.
This is also the case when users go to lunch, or for employees that come and go during the
day. Egress access control is a great way to gather this information, although as a work
around there are ways to conﬁgure an ESM platform to take the fact that we don’t know
into account when determining whether a violation has occurred, such as that presented in
the VPN plus physical access example.
Corporate Structure
In some organizations, corporate structure is also a challenge. Corporate structure, or the
organizational layout of a company, can often interfere with business imperatives. If the busi-
ness imperative is to protect the business from account sharing attacks, and in order to do
this information from the PACS is needed as well as information from the logical access
www.syngress.com

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

devices such as VPNs, the challenge arises.The group that controls and manages the PACS is
typically not under the same organization as the people who manage or own the logical
security devices.At many organizations, the two groups don’t even know each other, and
when security analysts or even a chief security ofﬁcer (CSO) have asked for the logs from
the PACS, the physical security teams have refused to turn them over.The physical security
team, in some cases, is reporting through admin and ﬁnance, or through a department com-
pletely separate from the IT organization, and it is usually not thrilled with the idea of a
security analyst accessing its systems or collecting events from its applications.
In order to combat this, there must be a top-down approach to security. We’re not sug-
gesting that the physical and logical security teams report under the same structure, or that
they even sit together. But sharing information is crucial.There has to be executive or top-
level sponsorship, and support for this type of initiative, for it to be successful, if not just for
the fact that it’s a new idea and people are hesitant of new ideas and changes.The sharing of
information also needs to go both ways.The security analysts need the physical access infor-
mation and the physical security teams need to know whether a user is under investigation
or a user is suspected of wrongdoing so that they can take precaution and keep a closer eye
on the suspect.The issues of corporate structure are not technical concerns, but they need to
be addressed and will probably turn out to be one of the harder issues to deal with when
implementing a converged security infrastructure.
Correlation Issues
The next area where challenges arise is in trying to correlate events from physical access sys-
tems with events from logical security, or just logical devices in general.A logical device
refers to an operating system, a ﬁrewall, a VPN gateway, or another standard system that can
be attached to a network and is generating log output.
Timing Delay and Batch Loading
Earlier we mentioned the problem of timing and batch event mode. When events are
batched, they are stored on an end device and are not sent to the collection point until a
buffer is ﬁlled.This can cause all sorts of problems for real-time correlation.
Picture trying to correlate an event that comes from an operating system within mil-
liseconds from when it actually happens, with an event from a physical access system that
comes into the ESM platform four hours later.This seems impossible. Well, this is the case
with many physical access systems. In many cases, the readers will store events until the
buffer is full and the events won’t be sent until the buffer ﬁlls up, which at a low-trafﬁc
entryway could take hours.The second case is the batch loading case, where due to organi-
zational challenges, the physical security team provides an export of all the events only once
per day. Both of these cases make correlation extremely difﬁcult.You can address this in sev-
eral ways, but only through the use of intelligent event processing and the multiple times-
tamps can actually help you correlate this data.
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
431

The problem is that the logical security events are long gone from real-time analysis by
the time the batch-loaded events are fed into the system, or by the time a reader decides that
it’s time to ofﬂoad its events to the collection point.This means the system is trying to cor-
relate events that happened, say, eight hours ago with events that really happened eight hours
ago but are being entered into the system eight hours later.This makes things difﬁcult. Only
with advanced correlation capabilities that can be considered forensic replay can this be
accomplished.As mentioned in the ESM overview section, events have more than one
timestamp in ESM.They have the time they were originally detected, as well as the time
they were sent to the ESM platform. When doing a forensic replay, all of the desired events
are actually fed back into the correlation engine and the correlations that would have been
achieved in real time can be achieved post-real time.This is an extremely powerful tool for
scenario analysis and discovering things that may have slipped by because events are arriving
with a huge time gap. Without this functionality, any batch-loaded or time-delayed events
are worthless to an ESM system.Although this works to detect incidents, it’s not in real time,
so the damage may have been done in some cases, but if the attack is still in an early stage,
this can be invaluable in stopping a breach.The ultimate solution in this case is to get the
events in real time by either working through the corporate issues or dealing with the PACS
vendor and ensuring that it provides real-time logging capabilities.
IDs and Usernames
As we learned when looking at the logs generated by the Keri Doors PACS, physical access
log messages do not mention usernames. PACS logs refer to users by their fob IDs or serial
numbers, so when an event is written indicating a user has entered the building, the user is
identiﬁed by his ID number. When the same user logs in via his VPN gateway account or
logs onto his computer using his Windows domain account, an event is written indicating
that the user logged in but it refers to the user by the name he used to authenticate.This is
one of the biggest problems facing organizations today: the idea of single sign-on including
physical access. Figure 14.10 represents the problem we are facing.
Figure 14.10 shows two authentication events.The one on the left is an authentication
from a Windows 2003 server indicating a user has successfully accessed the system.The one
on the right shows an event from the Keri Doors application indicating that a user has just
entered the building via the physical access control system.Although both events concern
authentication, and they are the same person they are very difﬁcult to correlate.The circled
portion of the Windows 2003 event shows a username to identify the user that accessed the
computer system.The circled portion on the right shows a target user ID. Now, this makes
correlation nearly impossible. How could a correlation engine possibly know that the user
ID presented by PACS is the same as the username reported by the Windows 2003 server? It
can’t; not with out identity correlation.

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

Figure 14.10 Correlation? Oh No! 
Identity correlation is similar to an identity management solution for correlation. It
allows the correlation engine to match up a seemingly disparate user ID with a seemingly
disparate username. Basically, it works by dynamically associating attributes to a single iden-
tity. So, in the example shown in Figure 14.10, the system would know that an event with
the target user ID 465nnnn63763 is an attribute of a user whose username is rjackson, and
would populate the event with the appropriate information so that the correlation engine
can correlate these two seemingly unrelated events. When the model has been populated, the
events from the previous example would look the same as they do in Figure 14.11, except
that the event from the physical access system would be populated with the appropriate
username so that the correlation could be done.
Figure 14.11 Correlation? Oh Yeah!
The two events in Figure 14.11 are still generated by the same two systems, except now
the PACS event is populated with a username.The event wasn’t actually changed, so don’t
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
433

worry about data integrity or anything like that, because the username is really just a refer-
ence to the value that the identity correlation manager maintains, so the event wasn’t modi-
ﬁed. Without changing the underlying event, the correlation engine (and any rules that you
may have looking for user behavior) will consider both of these events to have been gener-
ated by the same user. Magic? No. Identity correlation! Identity correlation is used not only
for physical and logical convergence, but also when dealing with insider threats, trying to tie
events from applications, databases, and operating systems, all to a single user. Further, this
technology is very useful when trying to correlate VPN gateway events with system access
events because VPNs don’t always use the same ID that a user would use to access a server
or his desktop system.This type of correlation has never before been possible, but it will be a
success criterion in the near future for anyone interested in Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) technology.
This section has hopefully addressed some of the concerns that have kept the adoption
rate slow.As with any emerging technology or ideas, there are always challenges and hurdles,
but they can be overcome with the right people and the right technology.
Detection through 
Convergence: Physical + VPN Access
It’s time to walk through our ﬁrst use case: physical plus VPN access.The logic in place here
has been set up in such a way that it will detect malicious and nonmalicious violations. (By
nonmalicious, we mean the account owner didn’t intentionally do anything wrong; perhaps a
user simply lost his VPN ID and password, or the account was compromised, in which case
the detection would probably lead to a strict talking to and a new account). In this case, the
rules in place detect a malicious attempt to steal trade secrets from a large ﬁnancial advise-
ment company. We have two perpetrators. One works for our favorite company, ﬁnance123,
and the other works for a direct competitor, ﬁnance789. Ronald Jackson (rjackson) has
worked for ﬁnance123 for years and has always been a good employee, but lately he has been
having some trouble at home, has a little gambling problem, and is becoming resentful that
he hasn’t been promoted.
Ronald hangs out at a local bar, where bankers from many different companies hang out
as well as corporate spies, like our other actor, Mike Rickerson. Mike is a corporate spy
working for ﬁnance789 and he frequents many of the same local pubs that employees go to
after work to have a drink and talk about their co-workers. Mike’s specialty is social engi-
neering. He will strike up a conversation with random people until he ﬁnds someone who
seems a little down on his luck or who is frustrated with his job (preferably both). Once he
ﬁnds his mark, he makes friends with him and will probably met up with him one or two
more times before he makes his offer. When he does make the offer, it’s usually accepted
because he has done his homework and knows exactly what to say to entice the victim.
In this case, Mike offers Ronald a lump sum of cash to help pay off his bookies and
promises that if anyone ever ﬁnds out, there will be no way to trace it back to him. Ronald

Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

agrees, so the plot unfolds. Mike explains to Ronald that all he has to do is provide him with
his VPN user ID and call him with the one-time password when he is ready to log in to the
network. He explains to Ronald that he just needs access to a couple of databases where the
ﬁnancial advice records are kept, and he will be gone before anyone is the wiser. Ronald
agrees and they leave the bar.
Two days later Ronald comes into the ofﬁce at his usual 9:00 start time, a little worried
about this whole idea but still determined to go through with it. He doesn’t know that as
soon as he enters the building, he is added to the building tracking list, as this activity is
detected by ArcSight (see Figure 14.12).
Figure 14.12 Badged-In Employees 
In Figure 14.12, we see several things happening when Ronald comes into the ofﬁce.
The initial event displayed is the Physical Access Granted event reported by Keri Doors.This
event is categorized as an authentication verify event that was successful.The following event
is a correlation event as a result of the access event.The correlation rule has an associated
action to add the user to a tracking list.The list can be used for later reference to determine
who is in the building. Once the rule ﬁres, indicated by the lightning bolt in the leftmost
column, we see above it an action event indicating that the requested action was completed
successfully and that user Ronald (rjackson) was successfully added to the Badged in
Employees list.This is an example of identity correlation. Instead of having a user ID, the
event reported by the physical access system has a username.
Ronald is now on the tracking list for users who are in the building, as he has been
every day he comes to work since this technology was implemented at ﬁnance123. Ronald
proceeds to his desk and begins working, when he gets a call from Mike. Mike tells Ronald
that it’s time to get busy and he will need him to provide his one-time password. Mike tells
him when he is ready and Ronald places his ﬁngerprint on his Tri-D Systems three-factor
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
435

authentication card, and his one-time VPN password is displayed. Because he has already
provided his username and PIN, all Mike needs to do is punch in the OTP before the time
window expires.
Well, Mike and Ronald are in for a big surprise.The instant Mike authenticates as
rjackson over the VPN, the alarms start ringing, as shown in Figure 14.13.
Figure 14.13 Physical Plus VPN Access
Remember, Ronald (rjackson) has just been added to the tracking list for users that are
currently in the building.The next base-level event, or noncorrelation event, is the
Authentication Successful event reported by Tri-D Systems’ OTP Server at the top of the
channel in Figure 14.13. Remember, this is the event that’s generated when the user success-
fully enters his one-time password after placing his ﬁnger on the three-factor authentication
card.This event sets off a ﬂurry of alarms. First we see the alarm General Security–Physical
plus VPN Access.This rule ﬁres because the target username is the same as the username
from the physical access granted event, indicating that Ronald is in the building but
accessing the network remotely at the same time.This is also not the only rule that ﬁres.
Several insider threat rules ﬁre indicating that the security team is already very savvy and
looking for early warning signs of internal threats.The rule Info Leak–Trafﬁc from competi-
tion ﬁres because the Attacker DNS domain where that the trafﬁc is originating is
ﬁnance789.com, which is tracked on a competition list.Any trafﬁc to or from any of these
competitors is ﬂagged and the target or source is tracked.
Now Mike has successfully gained access to ﬁnance123’s corporate network and can
begin to access another system using Ronald’s account.The next activity we see is a logon to
an Oracle database system where Mike will begin to access conﬁdential information (see
Figure 14.14).
www.syngress.com
436
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

Figure 14.14 Questionable Activity in Oracle
Starting from the bottom event in Figure 14.14, we see Mike logging onto a Windows
2003 server that is running Oracle. Once on the system, he uses Ronald’s privileges to access
the Oracle database and decides he is going to create himself a new user.The second event
from the bottom shows the attacker or source user as rjackson.This is the operating system
user, logging into the database with the rjackson_dba account. Once in the database, Mike
creates a new user called secretuser and grants the user DBA privileges, as indicated by
events three, four, ﬁve, and six from the bottom. Once he has created the user, he decides he
is going to delete all records of this, so he does a delete statement on the AUDIT$ table
where Oracle audit records are stored. Of course, this action is monitored and ﬂagged as sus-
picious activity. Once he feels he is home free, Mike goes after the information he is inter-
ested in—the Customers table and the Customer Information table—and he selects all of the
records from these tables and spools them to a text ﬁle.A very nice feature of Oracle
auditing is the fact that the operating system user is recorded for each event that’s generated
by a user accessing the database directly.
At this point, Mike has gathered quite a bit of information, and he wants to get it out of
the ﬁnance123 network and have it accessible externally, so he decides to e-mail it to a Web
mail account that he has set up (see Figure 14.15).
In Figure 14.15, we see Mike using Ronald’s e-mail account to send all of this data to
his secret Web mail account, secret@hushmail.com.This, of course, triggers more red ﬂags
because e-mail tracking events from the corporate exchange server are being collected and
this rule ﬁres due to the size of the e-mail that’s being sent to a public Web mail server.
What a great way to sneak information out of a company.This is one of the dangers of Web
mail. Mike then gets a little greedy and decides that he wants to access other databases
around the organization and see what kinds of goodies they might contain. He attempts to
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
437

access several other databases and he can’t seem to log in. Finally, he gets one he can log into
but during this time he has set off more alarms because it appears that he is attempting a
brute force attack (see Figure 14.16).
Figure 14.15 Large E-Mail to Public Web Mail Server 
Figure 14.16 Database Brute Force Success 
The ﬁnal stages in Mike’s attack are simple. He attempts to log on to other Oracle
databases, as indicated by the highlighted events in the channel from Figure 14.16, and he
continues to fail until ﬁnally he is successful, indicated by the event on top.This activity ulti-

438
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

mately leads to Mike’s (actually Ronald’s) account being disabled.The Multiple Failed
Database Access Attempts rule ﬁres due to all of the failed logins, and then when there is a
successful login using the same user account, the Database Brute Force Login Success rule
ﬁres.This rule ﬁring causes ESM to take action using the Network Response Module
(NRM). NRM is used to manage the network from a trafﬁc control standpoint. If a system
becomes out of compliance or is attacking other systems, it can automatically quarantine the
offending system using any of a number of automatic business rules. In this case, the desired
result is to stop Ronald from accessing any other systems, so NRM communicates with the
active directory server and disables Ronald’s account. One thing to note in this scenario is
that the response could have disabled the user account as soon as the physical plus VPN
access violation occurred, but it’s more exciting to see what could have happened had the
response been at the wrong stage of the attack. If the response were conﬁgured at the begin-
ning of the attack, when the VPN communication started, it would have been impossible for
Mike to have used Ronald’s account to access anything within the organization.This is a
good example of why it’s important to look at which point in a use-case response is appro-
priate.
Although Mike did manage to get the information into an e-mail, the e-mail was
blocked at the organization’s content ﬁltering mail gateway. Ronald and Mike now face
charges of corporate espionage, among other things, after a full-ﬂedged investigation led
straight to Ronald, who quickly rolled over and informed the authorities about Mike. Now,
this is a ﬁctional scenario, and Mike and Ronald are not references to any real people, nor
are ﬁnance123 and ﬁnance789 references to any real companies, but corporate espionage and
account sharing violations just like this do happen.This is a great example of how these types
of perpetrators can be caught.
Detection through Convergence:
Administrative Account Sharing
The second use case we will explore is a simpler example.The violation that is detected is
not malicious and probably happens all the time without anyone knowing. In most cases, it’s
probably done for a good reason and is helping the business process to run.
This scenario involves two administrators who work together all the time, each having
different accounts on the systems they manage.The two users have access to different systems
based on their job responsibilities—a typical separation-of-duties access control.The problem
lies in the fact that one of the administrators, Craig, has decided he is not going to come to
work today. Craig is responsible for all of the production databases that are used by the orga-
nization’s ﬁnancial applications (e.g., SAP). Well, one of these databases goes down and Craig
can’t access this server remotely because it’s in a protected network segment. Craig’s
coworker, Jimmy, is in the ofﬁce conducting his typical job duties, such as administrating the
e-mail servers, provisioning new accounts, and performing typical IT administrative tasks.
Craig calls Jimmy and asks him to check out the database server that appears to be down.
www.syngress.com
Physical and Logical Access • Chapter 14
439

When Jimmy tries to access the server, he discovers that his user account doesn’t have per-
mission to access this system because it falls under Craig’s responsibilities.
Here is where the trouble begins. Jimmy calls Craig and tells him he doesn’t have per-
mission to access the server and he can’t really troubleshoot the database without accessing
the system.At this point, Craig considers driving to the ofﬁce, but it seems like it may be
quicker if he just shares his account with Jimmy. Craig gives Jimmy his password and Jimmy
access the system using Craig’s account. Jimmy gets the database back up and running and he
logs off the system. Craig thanks him and they go on about their jobs.
In this case, the account sharing was not mischievous, nor were there any bad intentions,
but the fact remains that Jimmy now knows Craig’s password. Craig will probably change his
password, but he may not, depending on how much he “trusts” Jimmy (or maybe he forgets).
In either case, there is no accountability for anything that happens after this using Craig’s
account. Jimmy may have been waiting for just this opportunity to access something he isn’t
allowed access to, and no one would know whether the perpetrator was him or Craig.
Although this is a security violation, it isn’t worth ﬁring either of the users, but it is worth
educating them on why this is not a good idea.
Another way a person can learn a coworker’s password is through the collection of event
logs. If an organization is collecting operating system event logs, there is a good chance that a
savvy analyst can learn several users’ passwords per day if he knows what to look for. If you
think about logging into a server, either via a Windows login prompt or Secure Shell (SSH),
or from a UNIX console, the ﬁrst parameter you must enter is the username.The second
parameter is the password. Well, how many times have you accidentally entered your pass-
word in the username ﬁeld or on the command line thinking that the username was already
ﬁlled in? It happens more times than you may care to admit.Also, what about the case where
you type your username and press Enter or Tab but the system doesn’t actually respond and
the password is actually appended to the username? Guess what; when you press Enter and
have a failed login, an event is written to the system log either in the Windows event log or
to UNIX syslog.The event has the entered value stored in the username ﬁeld as the user
who attempted to log in but failed.
Now, a good analyst will be able to write a simple rule to detect or ﬁnd these types of
log messages using regular expressions, especially if the organization has a naming convention
for users.This means that if all usernames are eight characters long, or contain two numbers
at the end, or are in the “ﬁrstname.lastname” format, it’s very easy to search through log
messages to ﬁnd entries that don’t match. Now the analyst who monitors your logs may be
collecting passwords. Many organizations have rules in place that automatically notify IT
administrators when this happens and the accounts are forced to have a password change.
This type of response is another example of automation that can be achieved with an ESM
platform using a sophisticated response module such as NRM.
If the password is detected in a log message and automatically or manually remediated,
there isn’t much chance that an analyst would be able to exploit this security hole, especially
if he knows he’s being tracked. If this isn’t the case, if an analyst tries to use the account and
www.syngress.com
440
Chapter 14 • Physical and Logical Access

the user is at home or traveling, the same method of detecting administrative account
sharing can be applied.
As in the previous use case, the system is tracking the users who enter the building. If a
user enters the building and there is an event from the PACS, the username is added to the
badged-in users tracking list. Now the difference in this use case is that we are looking for
the absence of a user being on the list as the indication of a violation. What we are looking
for now is any login attempts or successes that indicate that a user is accessing a system
directly rather than via a remote access protocol such as SSH or a remote desktop.The rule
when it sees an event indicating such activity checks the tracking list and ﬁres if the user is
not on the list.
In Figure 14.17, we see the example where Craig’s account has been used to log on to a
system and the rule has checked the tracking list and determined that Craig is not in the
building.The top event is the correlation rule ﬁred by ArcSight’s correlation engine and the
Logon event is reported by Microsoft. In building this use case, it is very important to have
100 percent data collection. If the collection mechanism that is being used doesn’t capture all
of the data from the event, this Windows message will be useless. Similarly, if the collection
mechanism collects this information and there is no place for it to be used in the schema, it’s
not even worth capturing because this use case will not be possible.To explain why this is
the case, we must understand Microsoft Windows logging.
Figure 14.17 Account Sharing Violation (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
When you log on to a Microsoft system, an event is generated with an ID of 528. Now,
if you think about it, there are many types of logons.There is remote access, mapping a
drive, local logons, and even the differences between logging in and unlocking a workstation.
So, in addition to the event ID of 528, Microsoft has what’s known as a logon type code.A
logon type code ranges from 2 to 11 and has different meanings based on the code. Figure
14.18 is a screenshot of a local logon to a Windows XP system.

In Figure 14.18 several items are obfuscated.This is to protect the user account informa-
tion, hostnames, and such, but the two important ﬁelds are circled.These are the Logon Type
and Event ID ﬁelds.An event ID of 528 means a successful logon; the type of successful
login is indicated in the Logon Type ﬁeld. In this case, it’s a 2, meaning that it’s an interactive
logon or a logon to a local terminal.This is very important in this use case because if the
user is not in the building, there should never be a local logon from the user’s account.
Table 14.6 comes from Microsoft TechNet and describes the different codes associated
with Windows logon events.TechNet is a very useful tool for explaining the nightmare
known as Windows event log analysis.The following information is from

Some interesting use cases can be derived from this information, and knowing the dif-
ference between the different types of logons can be invaluable during a forensics investiga-
tion or when writing a real-time correlation rule such as the one we looked at in this use
case. Similar use cases can be done with the use of Linux or UNIX logs because local logons
are logged differently than remote connections. Most remote connections to UNIX systems
are done these days via SSH, so the logs will have a very unique identiﬁer showing that they
were written by sshd:
Feb
1 23:46:10 localhost sshd[460]: Accepted password for username from 1.1.1.1
port 4998 ssh2
The preceding message is from a Linux system and indicates a successful logon via SSH.
This is obviously a remote user, who would not trigger the Account Sharing rule to ﬁre.
In some large ﬁnancial organizations, this exact use case is being implemented, not just
to catch account sharing violations, but also as a means of catching piggybacking. If a user
logs on locally but has not badged into the building, he is in violation of the corporate
policy. Corporate policy states that all users entering the building need to always swipe their
badges, regardless of whether the door is open.This is being used by the physical security
teams who even have their own customized view into data pertaining to their role within

ESM, and have provided valuable results and analysis capabilities. It’s an example of how
teams can work together across an organization, regardless of reporting structure.
Conclusion
Physical and logical security convergence discussions almost always start with the use cases
described in this chapter, although the true power of the use cases are just starting to be real-
ized. Many organizations have dreams of implementing such monitoring and analytic capa-
bilities, but the goal sometimes seems unattainable.This chapter intended to show the value
provided through the correlation of physical access system logs and logical device logs to
achieve the ultimate in a converged security posture. Some of the takeaways should be that
although these use cases seem extreme, this activity is happening right now. Users are giving
up information to corporate spies.Administrators do share their accounts because it makes
their jobs easier. We are dealing with people, the most unpredictable of all beings, and we are
dealing with the masses. Security organizations these days are responsible for monitoring the
behavior of hundreds of thousands of users in locations all over the world. Every advantage
should be taken.
There are challenges when trying to implement a security monitoring strategy that
spans across the organization as well as across technologies that were never meant to be con-
verged. Using the right tools will provide the technology to make the convergence possible.
Having the appropriate policies in place will make the strategy successful and having execu-
tive buy-in will make the program span the organizational structure, and ultimately, make the
project successful.

Introduction
This chapter focuses on the beneﬁts of integrating video surveillance and monitoring
(VSAM) technology with an Enterprise Security Management (ESM) platform.The use
cases we describe in this chapter focus on an attempted compromise of a critical data center
server residing behind the walls of a secure campus. For the purposes of detail, we are
dealing with a large fabrication facility, known as ArcNet, which produces computer compo-
nents. Instead of just detecting the perpetrator sneaking into the data center and attempting
to compromise a system, we will examine the entire scenario—from the perimeter breach, to
a tailgating violation, to the perpetrator gaining access to not only the facility, but also the
secure data center. Once inside the data center, the attacker accesses a terminal and proceeds
to guess administrator and root passwords on multiple systems.This is known as a brute
force login attempt.The attacker continues to guess passwords that seem obvious, hoping
to get lucky (granted, this is a simple attack, but you may be surprised how many systems are
left with default user accounts and passwords).The use case focuses on detection, as well as
on a closed-loop process that identiﬁes the perpetrator, automatically takes a snapshot, and
adds the resulting picture to a case or trouble ticket as part of the workﬂow process.The
integration with VSAM in this use case is bidirectional. Not only does the video analytics
software forward alerts to the ESM platform, but also the ESM system communicates back
to the analytics application, instructing it to take a snapshot at the time a violation is
detected.
Technology Background: Video Analytics
Video analytics is a loosely deﬁned term. It ranges in meaning from motion detection to
detecting the difference between a human and a car passing in front of a camera. Video ana-
lytics dates to the early 1970s, when it was part of a Carnegie Mellon University project
funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to detect objects in
motion.This represents the most basic application of video analytics. Since then, VSAM has
been adopted across many vertical markets, including commercial, military, and law enforce-
ment. It has become so popular that the results of the data collected by such systems are not
only used as a security measure, but also, in the case of retail stores, to determine where
items should be placed for better sales numbers and to analyze shoppers’ behaviors.
In most cases, video surveillance is used as a security precaution, but the manpower that
it takes to monitor hundreds of video cameras has turned these systems into more of a post
mortem or forensics tool; although cameras have become so inexpensive that they can be
deployed in many different locations, monitoring them all is nearly impossible.As a result,
the value of video surveillance is drastically reduced because it offers no prevention opportu-
nities, since most of the video feeds are being used as part of an investigation after the inci-
dent has occurred. In addition, although most organizations have dedicated staff to monitor
their security camera systems, they typically focus only on the most valuable areas of the
www.syngress.com

organization due to limited resources.The cameras used in such an environment are CCTV
or closed circuit television cameras, which send a signal to only a limited set of monitors
(think of the classic security guard who sits in front of a monitor that displays four different
camera views, all rotating to different cameras, meaning that for some percentage of the time,
nobody is watching).
To combat this problem DARPA funded a project in 1997, again with Carnegie Mellon,
to develop intelligent video analytics systems.These systems are capable of automatically ana-
lyzing video streams from hundreds of cameras, whether analog or digital, to detect anoma-
lies.The detection algorithms can detect numerous suspicious activities, such as a person
loitering in a secure area, climbing over a perimeter fence, or leaving an object somewhere.
Video analytics technology breaks the video streams into pixels and uses sophisticated algo-
rithms to analyze and detect known or suspicious behaviors. Similar technology is being
developed and adopted by commercial vendors that are selling VSAM applications which
integrate with any existing camera infrastructure. We will look at some of these technologies
in the ESM integration portion of this chapter.
The value proposition when using video analytics systems is ﬁrst and foremost real-time
alerting of incidents. Instead of requiring a human to monitor hundreds of video cameras,
VSAM systems act as a video correlation engine with built-in rules to detect violations.
Similar to the value gained in the ESM space, where prior to ESM, analysts tried to correlate
log ﬁles from disparate systems in text ﬁles, now they write a correlation rule and let the
ESM system do the work for them.This greatly increases operational efﬁciencies by reducing
manpower and providing better results on a real-time basis.This technology is moving the
industry from a reactive to a proactive position where the end goal is stopping a problem
before it starts.
VSAM technology is being deployed in a variety of locations.Airports have begun to
adopt this technology to detect people leaving unattended objects in secured areas (a speciﬁc
example is the San Francisco International Airport, which has deployed one of the products
that we will be discussing later in this chapter). In addition, both commercial and govern-
ment organizations use these systems to collect feeds from cameras deployed around the
perimeter of secure campuses.The cameras watch the entrances as well as the fences sur-
rounding the area to look for breaches, such as someone parking a car near a fence where
they shouldn’t park, or by secure gates to look for people trying to pass through a vehicle
entrance. Some VSAM software is actually able to notice a person walking through a hallway
and leaving a package or a briefcase. Other organizations use it to detect removal of objects.
Consider a data center or a shipping/receiving area, where valuable objects may be acces-
sible. Cameras ﬁlming the area develop a baseline of how the area should look; if a server is
removed or a shipping box is picked up after hours, the system will notice that something
has changed and will generate an alarm.
VSAM technology has advanced from detecting motion to detecting unattended objects,
and it seems that the use cases will continue to expand. How does the technology work?
How can you take a stream of video and turn it into actionable alerts? How can a human be

distinguished from a car? In the next section, we will cover some of the techniques currently
being used by some of the more advanced VSAM applications.
Human Recognition
How is it possible to recognize a human in a stream of video? This seems like it would be
extremely difﬁcult, but by breaking the problem into a step-by-step process, we can more
readily understand how a VSAM system can extract the image of a human from the mass of
video streaming into the system.The ﬁrst step in this process is to look for the distinguishing
features of a human being. Without looking for a distinguishing feature, the system will
never be able to differentiate a human from, say, a dog or a car.There are many differences in
the way an image of a human behaves as opposed to that of a car.A human has moving
parts, such as arms and legs, whereas a car could be considered a blob—not too many
moving parts other than the tires, which are only rotating.
The easiest feature to recognize in a human is the way a human walks, otherwise known
as the human gait.The human gait is unique enough that an analytics system can distinguish
a human from most other objects.
Analytic systems typically analyze the joint angle between the lower and upper legs, and
the relationship between the knee joint and the foot—in other words, the angle that is cen-
tered at the knee when the leg bends, and the distance between the knee and the ankle as
the other leg moves.These angles are noted in Figure 15.1. Looking at the ﬁgure from left to
right, you can see that the angle that is created at the knee joint changes as the person moves
his legs, and the distance between the knee and the foot shows a recognizable pattern over
time regarding how far off the ground the foot is lifted with each step.
Figure 15.1 The Human Gait
These unique characteristics make it possible to analyze humans in a stream of video,
but before an algorithm can be applied to the imagery, many steps need to be taken to get to

a point where actual geometric shapes are being processed.The ﬁrst step is to extract the
image from the background.This process is known as binary image extraction.To accom-
plish this, the analytics software develops an understanding of what the background looks
like, because it is static. Next, any motion is detected using motion detection algorithms.
When motion is detected, the moving pixels are extracted from the background to form a
silhouette (see Figure 15.2).
Figure 15.2 The Complete Image
Once the system detects moving pixels, it extracts the background to remove noise or
moving objects, such as water or clouds.The software is then given a set of pixels that repre-
sents only the moving object for analysis. In the process of human recognition, the back-
ground is unimportant because it is fairly static, or the motion that does exist is noise and
can be ﬁltered out. Figure 15.3 represents the same view as Figure 15.2, except with the
background removed.
Now that the background has been extracted, the system has the object of interest as its
main focus and can continue the process.
The characteristics of the object are then removed and all that’s left is a silhouette or a
blob.To the analytics software, the ﬁgure is still not recognized as a person but, as noted ear-
lier, a blob, which is nothing more than a grouping of pixels. Figure 15.4 shows the results of
the characteristic extraction.

Figure 15.3 No Background
Figure 15.4 Silhouette
This is where it gets interesting. Once we have a silhouette, the system needs to be able
to interpret what the silhouette represents. In order to do this, the image is converted into
geometric shapes that can be computed by mathematical algorithms. Figure 15.5 shows how
the silhouette in Figure 15.4 is converted to geometric shapes.The shape that is used is the

trapezoid, and the human body is composed of ﬁve trapezoids.The torso is represented by
one, and each leg is divided into two trapezoids to represent the areas above and below the
knee.
Figure 15.5 Trapezoidal Overlay
Once the body is no longer thousands of pixels, but rather is represented as geometric
shapes, algorithms can work with the measurement of the different angles as the person
moves across an area. Figure 15.5 shows the silhouette of a person that is standing still; when
the person is moving, a distinct pattern of angles is generated because of the way the human
body moves. Figure 15.6 shows the same method, but applied to a ﬁgure in motion.
Figure 15.6 Trapezoidal Final

This ﬁgure clearly shows the legs in motion, or the human gait.The different angles are
measured and compared with known values from a human.This is the most popular and
advanced form of human recognition.This technology is used not only by advanced video
surveillance systems, but also by visual effects companies in the ﬁlm industry to capture the
motion of live actors and then apply the captured data to computer-generated characters.
Other methods exist that are less mathematical and less intelligent. One such method is
known as blob logic. Blob logic takes similar steps to detect motion and then extracts the
moving pixels from the background, but instead of measuring angles and comparing them
with algorithms to determine the difference between a human and, say, a vehicle, blob logic
simply compares the sizes of the blob of pixels and determines that the larger blob is a
vehicle rather than a person. It basically measures the delta between the background and the
foreground and tracks the moving blob of pixels. Systems using the blob logic method are
prone to both false positives and false negatives.These inaccurate results can be compared to
a false positive or a false negative in the world of intrusion detection, in which a false posi-
tive would be the video analytics system detecting something that really didn’t happen, and a
false negative would be the absence of an alert when something actually did occur.
Data Sources
As noted earlier, this chapter focuses on an attempted compromise of a data center server,
detected through the convergence of video analytics and operating system event logs using
ESM as the single pane of glass.The detection details how you can combine a physical secu-
rity device, such as a video analytics system, with common operating system logs to detect
and stop a corporate spy. With that in mind, we will look at different technologies in the
video analytics space as well as data that can be gathered from an operating system’s default
logging facilities.
Many companies make video analytics software; we will discuss two of them in this
chapter: Cernium’s Perceptrak, which implements an open database connectivity- (ODBC)
compliant database, and Vidium’s SmartCatch, which uses an application programmer inter-
face (API) that generates XML output. We chose these two because they have been around
for some time and they appear to be among the more sophisticated products available today.
In addition, both forms of output can easily be collected and sent to an ESM platform.
Cernium
Cernium’s ﬂagship product is Perceptrak, which differentiates itself from other products on
the market because of the methods it uses for detection and object recognition. Cernium has
been around since 1996 and has products deployed across vertical markets including airports,
casinos, retail, and transportation. It uses an efﬁcient segmentation algorithm that is modeled
after the human eye—hence, the name Perceptrak. Because its analytics are based on how
the human eye would recognize objects, it can easily recognize objects that are not part of
the background. Objects are broken into segments and the segments are classiﬁed as part of
www.syngress.com
452
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

an object, which may be a person, vehicle, or something else. Cernium also focuses on elimi-
nating noise from the picture; noise could be something blowing in the wind, or other ele-
ments in the background that are moving, such as an ocean or a street with moving cars.
The analytics process does not compare an entire blob of pixels, but rather compares ele-
ments of an object, known as “symbolic data,” so no pixel-by-pixel comparison is being
done. Pixel-by-pixel comparison is extremely processor-intensive and, in most cases, requires
a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) chip. Cernium says its product can analyze 16
video feeds on a Pentium 4 processor, compared with only two to four cameras on a single
Xeon processor for the more common pixel-by-pixel approaches. By detecting events as
they happen and feeding the information to an operator in an intelligent fashion, Perceptrak
allows security teams to be more effective and preempt possible security violations.An oper-
ator monitoring a video screen is going to be effective for only the ﬁrst 20 to 30 minutes
and then naturally will lose focus. By receiving only events of interest, operators can investi-
gate and respond much more quickly.
Perceptrak can detect numerous suspicious behaviors and activities.The product,
although security-focused, can also detect safety concerns, such as someone falling down. If
an object that has been identiﬁed as a person changes its aspect ratio from a vertical to a
horizontal position and the object is horizontal for longer than the threshold, the system will
generate an alert.The threshold eliminates false positives such as someone picking up a pen.
Other advanced behavior recognition capabilities include a crowd forming, which could be
used as a public safety measure, or crowd dispersal.At airports or other secure areas, the iden-
tiﬁcation of objects left behind is a great use-case.The system will detect a new object
entering the camera’s view, and when the object remains motionless for a given period of
time. Objects of interest can also be deﬁned through the console, and the system will gen-
erate an alert if the object is removed, such as a stolen laptop.
These are some of the advanced use cases, but other suspicious activities can be detected
as well, such as a lurking person, multiple people, vehicles coming to a stop, abandoned vehi-
cles, fast- or slow-moving vehicles, or an erratic person.The erratic person is interesting
because the detection is based on deviation from a direct route.The application knows that
to get to your car in a parking lot, you will follow some path from the door directly to your
car; you wouldn’t walk up to multiple cars (unless you’re at an airport looking for your
rental car), so someone sneaking around a parking lot looking into cars would be detected.
Most of the detectable behaviors have thresholds that can be conﬁgured, as well as the times
of day at which behaviors should be reported. Figure 15.7 shows how easy these are to con-
ﬁgure by adjusting the slider on a per-alert basis.
www.syngress.com
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15
453

Figure 15.7 Perceptrak Console 
The general idea is that the system is installed with default thresholds, which you can
customize for a particular environment.This is similar to what needs to be done with net-
work intrusion detection systems in a logical security environment.An intrusion detection
system generally ships with default rules enabled; however, some rules are too noisy and gen-
erate false positives, so you need to adjust or tune them.Another interesting feature is to set
different thresholds for different days of the week and times of the day. During business
hours, you would expect people to walk through a secure area, but after hours, you may
want an alert on everyone who enters or leaves a designated area.
The Perceptrak system includes the MCON, or master console station, which is respon-
sible for providing the main monitoring interface as well as sending alerts in real time to
operators.You could consider the MCON station to be the operator’s connection to the
analytics system.The MCON station is connected to processing systems over standard
Internet Protocol (IP) networks.The processing servers receive feeds from video cameras that
are either digital (via IP) or analog. It doesn’t really matter whether the cameras provide dig-
ital or analog feeds; they just need to send the feeds to the Perceptrak processing server.
Figure 15.8 shows a 36-camera setup running two processing servers for the analog cam-
eras and digital servers, as well as a processing server for four servers at a remote location.The
satellite processing servers make it easy to collect video feeds from multiple locations.

Challenges of Integration
As mentioned previously, one of the easiest ways that an ESM connector can collect data is
via an ODBC connection to a remote database.All alerts that Perceptrak generates are
written to a database that a connector can query remotely.The hardest part of any database
integration is typically to understand the device schema so that the appropriate ﬁelds can be
designated in the query. Some products in the logical security world (e.g., ISS Site Protector)
have complex schemas whereby parts of the events they generate are stored in pieces in dif-
ferent tables.This causes the query to be complicated in that it uses outer and inner joins to
gather values from all the different tables. Fortunately, this is not the case with the Perceptrak
system.
Now that you understand how Perceptrak works, let’s look at the database schema and
determine the ﬁelds we want to bring into the ESM system.
Log Format
With the Perceptrak system, all alerts are stored in a database, so a remote query to the event
table is all that is required to connect to Perceptrak.The ﬁrst step is to look at the schema
for the alert table.This is a small subset of the entire database schema, but we are not con-
cerned with any of the other tables.Table 15.1 shows the schema from the event table popu-
lated with some sample values.

Looking at the schema and the ﬁelds available in the database, you can see that the
query is easy to write.The results of the query will return the values from the columns in
Table 15.1.The camera ID ﬁeld is important in order to know where in the environment
the incident occurred.The event message obviously talks about the incident that was
detected.The score is similar to a severity value, and the event ID is a unique ﬁeld identi-
fying each event.The value contained in the URL ﬁeld is a link to the video clip from the
time the incident was detected, for further analysis.You can access this link from a remote
workstation, so an analyst can conceivably be at home and still access Perceptrak over a vir-
tual private network (VPN) connection. We will discuss the ﬁeld mappings from the
Perceptrak alerts to the ESM normalized schema later in this chapter.
Vidient
Vidient is another leader in the video analytics space.Their customer base is broad-reaching
and includes airports such as San Francisco International Airport, San Diego International
Airport, and Salt Lake City International Airport.Airports are an obvious choice for inte-
grating video analytics technology, because airports have so many security concerns that can’t
be addressed by simply adding more people to the organization’s security team. With the use
of cameras, it’s now possible to detect a person who leaves their bag unattended without
having an operator monitoring hundreds of individual cameras.Along the lines of conver-
gence, Vidient has a great history of integration with physical access devices; the ability to
www.syngress.com
456
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

detect multiple people passing through an entryway when only one user has been authenti-
cated via the badge reader.
Vidient is a spin-off of NEC Labs, and it bases its detection capabilities on algorithms
that were developed in NEC’s Computer Vision Labs. Vidient focuses on detection through
intelligent video analytics.The Vidient product, SmartCatch, focuses on detecting objects in
motion, classifying these objects very accurately and tracking for correlation against a prede-
termined policy. First, SmartCatch detects the object using motion detection algorithms.
Once motion is detected, the system identiﬁes what is in motion—whether it’s a person, a
vehicle, or a group of people.
Instead of using general blob logic or DARPA-based algorithms, Vidient uses several
methods that measure free space between different parts of the extracted pixels for more
accurate classiﬁcation. For example, the system measures and contrasts certain pixel combina-
tions to detect a human’s head and shoulders.This process of object identiﬁcation, coupled
with many other attributes that constitute a human, allows the system to be very precise in
determining what it is looking at. Once it identiﬁes the object, it tracks it to determine
where the object went. So, if it identiﬁes a suspicious person walking through a camera’s area
of view, the system will track the person and potentially alert operators as to the person’s
current location.
Vidient looks at the problem from the perimeter in the same way that the use case in
this chapter unfolds.The perimeter is the ﬁrst line of defense in both the physical and logical
security worlds. If you can detect someone breaching the perimeter, you can remedy the
problem before the attacker has gained access to a facility or a network resource. SmartCatch
can also detect removed objects, such as a laptop being picked up off a desk, an object being
left behind, or someone walking through a secure area.Another very interesting use case that
we will look at in more detail later in the chapter is tailgating into a secure area.Tailgating is
when two people walk through a secure entrance, but only one of them authenticates via a
badge reader system.This is accomplished by integrating the analytics system with physical
access control systems that can send events to the product when a badge is read.
The Vidient system consists of several different components.At the core of the deploy-
ment are the server and Policy Engine.This is where the main control center for the system
resides.The server is responsible for connections to third-party sensory products, powering
the monitoring consoles and both setting and enforcing policies.The Policy Engine is also
used for third-party notiﬁcations and serves as the event repository; this is a good point to
connect for the ESM integration.The actual video processing is done by video processing
units (VPUs) typically located at the edge of the network. Cameras feed video to the VPUs
for analysis. Figure 15.9 displays the typical way that the Vidient system is deployed.

Challenges of Integration
One of the easy ways to integrate with this product is to access the event store directly.
Assuming that the event store is an ODBC-compliant database, a connector can easily access
the event table and query for the latest alerts that the system has generated. Unfortunately,
this process is not documented, but several methods of integration have been made available
via an API.The API is implemented as a subscription model whereby clients can connect
and receive alerts.The client is ﬁrst authenticated and then can access the alert proxy to
receive events in real time.The client simply opens a socket connection to the proxy and the
proxy pushes alerts formatted in XML to the client.This method is well documented and all
the details of the API are provided, but the XML output can become complex to parse
because of multiple lines and tags.As integration opportunities arise, the ability to access the
www.syngress.com
458
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

event store directly will be the preferred method of integration from both a time-to-market
and ease-of-use perspective.
Log Format
The log format of the events pushed from the alert proxy to the registered client is XML.
Some of the information contained in the alert is internal to the SmartCatch product and
the ESM connector can ignore it. Several key ﬁelds are of interest when integrating with
ESM:
■
Timestamp This is the timestamp of the alert, provided as Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC).This requires the client to translate to the local time zone if neces-
sary.
■
Priority This is system-assigned priority; both numeric and text representations
are provided. 1 High, 4 – Informational
■
Facility This provides the facility name and ID where the alert occurred.
■
Location This provides the location name and ID where the alert occurred.
■
Type This deﬁnes the alert type. It will be based on the behaviors and situation
that generated the alert.
■
Description This provides a descriptive string describing the alert.You can con-
ﬁgure this per alert within the SmartCatch system.
■
VPK This is internal.
■
VPU This is internal.
■
Store This provides the local storage location of the media clip or image associ-
ated with any video event.
■
URL This provides the URL for accessing the media image and/or the video clip
remotely.
■
Attributes This provides additional attributes associated with the alert.These will
vary based on the alert type. For example, in a tailgate alert, this ﬁeld will contain
the number of people tracked into the secure zone. Details of the attributes that
can be generated per behavior can be provided by Vidient on request.
■
Escalations This provides details on the alert’s stage of escalation processing.
The timestamp ﬁeld is very important when dealing with correlation.All times need to
be synchronized. When products report in UTC, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu
the connector that is gathering the events needs to convert this to the standard that the ESM
platform is using.The priority ﬁeld will be calculated and mapped to a normalized severity
value.The VPK ﬁeld is available as additional information.A tricky ﬁeld is attributes, because
the connector won’t know how many attributes there will be, and the number will vary
www.syngress.com

based on the alert, so each message type will require ESM to deal with these differently
because of the varying values that may be present 
The following XML output is an example of a tailgating event as reported by the
SmartCatch system.The values that are bolded are the ﬁelds that the ESM connector is
going to process. Some values have been removed because of the length of the message.

XML is one of the most tedious formats to parse because it comprises multiple lines and
can have varying values, depending on the tags. For example, in the preceding output, the
attributes can change.This log entry has some speciﬁc attributes associated with the access
door tailgating event type; if this were an erratic person event, the attributes would be dif-
ferent.This means that to do a reasonable job mapping ﬁelds to an ESM schema, the con-
nector has to build a separate mapping for each event type that can be reported so that the
mapping will be accurate based on the attributes reported.This makes building the con-
nector more cumbersome and requires help from the product vendor.This is another
example of why a table in a database or a simple syslog message makes integration so much
easier.
Later in the chapter we will examine how the preceding XML will be converted to
normalized events that an ESM platform can process, and how an analyst using an ESM con-
sole would view these alerts. Remember that some of the values will look a little different in
the ESM console because, for example, the timestamps will need to be converted to the
appropriate representation so that they can be correlated with other events.
Now that you understand the differences between these two products, let’s look at event
collection from two of the standard operating systems: UNIX and Microsoft Windows.
Operating Systems
Operating systems generate many different kinds of events. Most applications write both
informational and error messages to the standard logging facility provided by the operating
system. UNIX uses the syslog facility and binary logging ﬁles—for example, wtmp. Other
binary ﬁles are also useful on a UNIX platform, such as /var/log/utmp, which stores binary
information on the users that are currently logged in. When you run the who command, this
ﬁle is accessed and the current users are displayed.Another binary ﬁle is /var/log/lastlog,
which Finger uses to tell when a user was last logged on to the system. Finger is a program
that you can run to gather information on a user, such as his logon name, the last time they
logged in, idle time, as well as the last time her read his mail.
The wtmp ﬁle is a binary ﬁle that you can access only if it’s properly decoded.The
wtmp ﬁle is not the only logging mechanism in UNIX, though. Syslog servers can be con-
ﬁgured to log authentication type events to an additional ﬁle as text, if the syslog.conf ﬁle is
conﬁgured correctly.The following lines are an excerpt from a syslog.conf ﬁle where the
www.syngress.com
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15
461

syslog server is being instructed to log all authentication events to a ﬁle named auth.log,
located in the /var/log directory:
#; /etc/syslog.conf
#; Do not log auth/authpriv messages here; rather log them to
#; a separate ﬁle for processing by security staff.
auth,authpriv.none
/var/log/messages
auth,authpriv.debug
/var/log/auth.log
To understand what is going on in the preceding code snippet, let’s brieﬂy talk about
how syslog works. When an application writes to syslog, the application speciﬁes a facility as
well as a priority.These values can be used as ﬁlters telling the syslog server where you want
the information to be written. Some common facilities are auth and authpriv, which are the
facilities that should be used when applications are logging regarding authenticating or privi-
lege use. Some other common facilities are kern, used for writing kernel messages, and mail,
which is used for information regarding the mail subsystem.The priorities range from debug,
which comprises debugging statements, all the way to crit (critical) and panic. In the ﬁrst bold
line in the preceding code, the statement tells the auth and authpriv facilities to write none, or
nothing, to the messages ﬁle.The second bold line speciﬁes that auth and authpriv should
write debug and all other priorities to /var/log/auth.log. When the priority is speciﬁed, it
follows a top-down approach; if debug is speciﬁed all the higher priorities will also be
included.
Whereas UNIX uses the syslog facility, Windows systems use the Windows Event Log
service, in which the events are written in a proprietary binary format directly to the
Windows event log.The connectors for gathering these events are completely different. In
Windows, three event logs should be monitored: the system log, the application log, and the
security log.The system log is used for operating system logging; this would include events
such as services starting and stopping, kernel panics, or a network interface being discon-
nected from the network.The application log is used by applications running on the oper-
ating system to log information speciﬁc to the application. Microsoft uses this facility as well
to log information regarding its applications. Most attention is typically paid to the security
log.This is where we get authentication events, privilege use, as well as permission changes
and group membership events, provided that the system is properly conﬁgured.
For years, the default setting on Windows was to have a security policy that didn’t have
logging enabled; as such, system administrators would have to conﬁgure this as part of the
Windows domain.At least it’s easy to control the policy for a central location. Each com-
puter that is part of the domain will inherit the security policy from the domain controller.
On a local system, to enable security logging you need to access Local Security Policy
under Administrative Tools in the Control Panel. Once you’ve opened the Local
Security Policy window, expand the Local Policies folder and select the Audit Policy
leaf.This displays a list of policies, as shown in Figure 15.10. In the right-hand pane, select
each section for which you want to enable auditing, and then select success, failure, or both.

Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

Figure 15.10 Conﬁguring Audit Policy (Source: Microsoft Windows XP)
Each setting in Figure 15.10 will enable the logging of different things to the security
log. Some of the more important are logon events and account logon events, in which both
success and failure should be audited.The difference is that in the logon events policy, the
local computer is being accessed, and in the account logon events policy, another computer
is being accessed and the local computer is doing the authentication, such as on a domain
controller.Account management, both success and failure, is also important.Account man-
agement will log any user account changes, such as users being added to new groups or
changing the permissions of a group. Policy changes also are important, as is failed privilege
use. Object access is interesting as well, but it generates high volumes of events because it’s
auditing access to ﬁles, folders, Registry keys, and any other objects within Windows that has
an access control list (ACL) set on it. In most cases, this is set to access failures, although
some organizations want to know about every ﬁle being accessed, so they also monitor suc-
cesses, but this requires considerable overhead.
In both cases, Windows and Linux, hundreds of event types will be inconsequential.
Most of these are informational, and although they will be collected, analysts generally will
ignore them. It is very important when dealing with operating system logs to know the
types of events that are of concern to you and how they can be identiﬁed, such as failed
logins or an unexpected service crashing events on Windows. Even when you know the
event type that you’re looking for, there may still be instances in which one event can mean
completely different things. For example, the Windows login event ID 540 (for a successful
network logon) can have multiple meanings. In one case, it could mean that a user has
authenticated via Active Directory to access a network resource, and in other cases, it could
mean that a network share connection is reauthenticating in the background.There is no
interaction from the user, although his credentials are being used.There are ways to differen-

tiate the two, but they create only subtle differences. In the case of failed logins, on Windows
there are at least 10 different events talking about failed logins.
Many resources are available on the Internet to help decode what Windows events are
really talking about. One such site is Ultimate Windows Security, located at www.ulti-
matewindowssecurity.com/encyclopedia.html.The following code is an excerpt explaining
some of the Windows event IDs.

User Logoff
The log format from both UNIX authentication events and Windows logon events is
easy to understand.The values that we care about the most are the event name (what hap-
pened), the user who did it, the time the event occurred, and the system on which it
occurred.The following logs are from a Windows XP operating system and Ubuntu Linux.
In both cases, the operating system version doesn’t really change the log format or the infor-
mation that’s available.
This is an example of a failed and successful login via secure shell written to
/var/log/auth.log on Ubuntu Linux:
Nov 13 13:24:49 localhost sshd[9656]: Failed password for user1 from
192.168.80.42 port 4892 ssh2
Nov 13 13:24:54 localhost sshd[9656]: Accepted password for user1 from
192.168.80.42 port 4892 ssh2
The syslog entries share common ﬁelds that are usually associated with most syslog mes-
sages.The ﬁrst ﬁeld is a timestamp that is appended to any message written to syslog by the
syslog daemon.This, of course, is very important in terms of telling an analyst when some-
thing has occurred.The second ﬁeld to the right is the system on which the event occurred.
In this case, it is localhost, meaning that the event occurred on the same system that the syslog
server resides. In some cases, a system may be conﬁgured to send information to a remote
host, in which case the entry would be that of the remote system.
www.syngress.com
464
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

The next ﬁeld is the process that is logging the event, and the process ID. In this case, it’s
sshd or the Secure Shell (SSH) daemon.The next part of the message is what is actually sent
to the syslog daemon by the application (or sshd in this case).We can see that the log entry
has multiple values in the string of text that will need to be parsed out in order to use the
information contained in the log entry.The information that’s important is the event, which
in the ﬁrst example is an accepted password; the username, which is user1; the source address,
or where the login attempt originated (192.168.80.42), and the source port, which is 4892. It
is essential when doing ESM integration work to understand log messages and their formats.
Without this understanding, it is not possible to accurately map log ﬁelds to an ESM schema.
Figure 15.11 shows a failed logon reported by Windows XP.This is an important event;
it represents a failed password or a bad username. If several of these events occur in a row, it
could indicate that someone is trying to guess a password.Again, the important ﬁelds in
terms of both Linux and Windows are the user, the system, and the time ﬁelds. Both facili-
ties provide similar information, just in a different format.
Figure 15.11 Failed Logon—Windows XP 
In Figure 15.11, the event is being viewed via the Windows Event Viewer.The ﬁgure
shows several ﬁelds of interest to a security analyst. Looking to the center of the ﬁgure, we
see most of the useful information, such as the username, the domain, and the name of the
system on which the failed logon occurred.The username is the account that was used in
the logon attempt. Of course, this doesn’t mean the perpetrator was necessarily that user; it
could be someone who either knew his username or attempted to guess it. It is very hard to
get physical aspects from the typical event log (another beneﬁt of convergence). If a video
www.syngress.com
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15

clip is associated with the failed access attempt, the actual person can be identiﬁed. It’s never
safe to assume that the name used to log on really belongs to the person that accessed the
system.
From Logs to ESM
Once the device logging facilities and ﬁeld values are understood, the events need to be nor-
malized and mapped to the ESM schema. Integration with video analytics systems is a new
idea and has not been part of standard ESM deployments. Because we are dealing with
devices that are not typical logical security devices, we have to get a little creative with the
ﬁeld mappings, meaning that there may not be a dedicated ﬁeld for something such as a
camera name. Fortunately, a comprehensive schema covers most possible values, and when
there is information that just doesn’t ﬁt in a dedicated ﬁeld, ESM has custom ﬁelds for this
purpose. For example, operating system events have been collected by ESM products for
years, so the mapping of the event ﬁelds to a normalized schema is straightforward. Starting
with the events from the video analytics systems, we will look at how they are integrated
with ESM.
Table 15.2 shows an event from Cernium Perceptrak, and Table 15.3 shows an event
from Vidient SmartCatch after being sent to an ESM system via a connector.

As you can see in the tables, the ﬁeld mappings are not too hard to understand, but
some decisions had to be made regarding where the camera ﬁts into the picture. Because the
camera is not the system that’s generating the event, it doesn’t make sense to use it as the
device.The camera is just feeding data into the decision-making product, so the system
where the analytics application is running was chosen for the device.The event name is stan-
dard; it’s just the alert that was generated.The message ﬁeld is the URL where an analyst can
click to access the video clip from the time of the alert.The camera, camera location, and
facility were all mapped to device custom ﬁelds where they are all available for correlation.
Figure 15.12 shows the events in an analyst’s channel or grid view.
Figure 15.12 ArcSight Active Channel 
Understanding the log format of different devices is only part of the integration.
Products can interact with ESM in many other ways. For instance, you can have console
integrations in which third-party products can be accessed for further analysis, or tools such
as scanners can be integrated as custom tools so that systems triggering an event can be
scanned. In the video analytics space, it is important to know where the incident is occur-
ring so that security teams can be dispatched.The beneﬁt of a ﬂexible ESM solution is that
www.syngress.com
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15
467

it can be customized to meet different requirements. In this use case, the cameras are treated
as assets and can be sorted by location or graphed to determine which parts of the organiza-
tion they are monitoring.An organization may have hundreds of cameras in locations around
the world, so it’s important to ﬁgure out where the camera is geographically located. Figure
15.13 shows the organization of the VSAM cameras at our target organization.
Figure 15.13 Camera Locations
Alternatively, an analyst could use a graphical representation to display similar data but in
an easy-to-navigate graph view. Figure 15.14 is the same camera tree as that shown in the
preceding ﬁgure, except using a graphing feature to visually display cameras or assets within
a part of the organization. In this image, the analyst explored the San Francisco headquarters
location and can follow the leaves to determine exactly where a camera is located. On future
integrations, it would be extremely helpful to be able to double-click a camera and have a
viewer launched that displays a live feed from the selected node.
Video analytics systems cover only half of this use case. We still need to look at the
operating system logs that will be used to detect the brute force login attempt.Although the
use case in this chapter comprises only Windows events, it’s important to understand the
information that can be gathered from all of the different operating systems found
throughout organizations. Most users understand the basics of authentication events, so we
will mainly cover the ﬁeld mappings and a unique visualization method for detecting brute
force login attempts.

Table 15.4 shows a failed login reported by Windows as it would be mapped within an
ESM system. Many more ﬁelds are included in a Windows event, such as which log the
event is from and other Windows-speciﬁc information that is accounted for in ESM, but in
this chapter, we will discuss only the ﬁelds that are relevant to our use case.

username is the user that is trying to log on.These are important because they allow an ana-
lyst to do trending and write rules based on this information. Using these values, an analyst
can quickly run reports to see which users have the highest rate of failed logons and write
rules to detect brute force attempts, as we will discuss later.
Table 15.5 shows a similar event, but reported by the SSH daemon on a UNIX system
denying access to a user who doesn’t have a valid username.The command executed to gen-
erate the failed logon via SSH would look like this:
ssh bad_user_name@remotesystem
The command starts by calling the ssh application and then specifying the username,
which in this case is a nonexistent user on the system, followed by the server to which to
connect.The SSH daemon logs a message noting that a logon was attempted with an illegal
username.The event is then received in the ESM system.Table 15.5 shows the more impor-
tant ﬁeld mappings.

The UNIX logon attempt has very similar ﬁelds of interest.Again, it includes the tar-
geted system, the attempted user, and the process that logged the event (in this case, SSHD).
Not shown in the table is the source address from which the event originated. In the case of
remote authentication attempts, usually a source address ﬁeld indicates the origin of the
attempt.The most important ﬁelds to note between these two events are the category ﬁelds.
These ﬁelds represent part of a security event taxonomy whereby similar events are put into
buckets that describe what the events mean.This is one of the keys in ESM in terms of
enabling cross-device correlation.
The two events are login events, but they are from completely different applications.
Using categories as a ﬁlter or a condition, allows for both of these events to show up in
either a correlation rule or a report by simply referencing a category behavior of
/Authentication/Verify. If the events were not categorized, a ﬁlter condition containing the
exact syntax of a login message from every different device that you are collecting events
from would be the only way to correlate this information. It would take analysts much
longer to write a simple rule because they would ﬁrst have to ﬁgure out the syntax of a
www.syngress.com
470
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

Windows logon event versus a logon event from Solaris or Linux. We cannot stress enough
how powerful a comprehensive categorization taxonomy is when correlating events from
disparate devices.
In the event graph in Figure 15.15, we see a graphical detection of a brute force login
attempt where a user (or, more likely, an automated script) is attempting to log on to mul-
tiple systems using the same username.The events are reported by different sources; this
would be extremely difﬁcult without categorization.
Figure 15.15 Brute Force Logon Attempt—Graphical Representation
(Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Figure 15.15 shows the attacking system, 10.0.111.39 (represented by the dark square), as
well as the user attempting to log on to all of the white squares.The username is test and the
connecting node is the category behavior ﬁeld, or in this case, /Authentication/Verify.This
graph represents some of the unique attacks that can easily be detected through visual anal-
ysis. Many resources are available if you want to learn more about visual event analysis. For
example, Raffael Marty is an expert in security event visualization and is working on some
very interesting initiatives (for more information, visit http://secviz.org).
Detection through Convergence
We have examined how video analytics began and how it works, we have seen the power of
intelligent video analytics systems, and we have looked at authentication events from mul-

tiple operating systems. Now we will discuss the detection of a malicious individual who
accesses a secure facility and attempts to compromise a system in a secure data center.
The Plot
We will refer to the perpetrator as Marc. Marc is a corporate spy whom a competitor has
hired to get information on upcoming product designs. Marc has tried to access the organi-
zation,ArcNet, through standard hacking attempts, and although he accessed the network
and scoped out the environment, all he managed to gain access to were several desktops that
were running vulnerable software. Marc tried to access several of the servers that seemed to
hold project plans and, possibly, design specs, judging from the share names, but he was
unable to gain access. Marc did ﬁnd one piece of valuable information on one of the systems
that he compromised: a server list containing the location of many production systems. Marc
decided that because he couldn’t access these systems directly, he would attempt to sneak
into the facility and social-engineer his way into the data center.Then he would attempt to
access the system directly by guessing default passwords or attempting to use a password-
cracking program.The detection mechanisms and incident investigation will highlight the
value gained when converging video analytics with logical security events.
To get a better understanding of the facility to which Marc is attempting to gain access,
let’s look at a ﬂoor plan that details the different entrances to the building as well as the
camera setup (see Figure 15.16).

The ﬂoor plan shows only the ground level of the ArcNet fabrication and design facility.
The building comprises multiple ﬂoors, each with a similar design, except for the lobby and
the data center.The parking structure is multilevel and each level has a keyed entry as well as
a keypad entry system to gain access to the facility.The cameras that are located at each
corner of the ﬂoor have a 360-degree view of the parking structure.Any visitor entering the
building through the lobby will be on camera as soon as he walks through the door, and will
need an access card or an escort to get any farther.The data center is well protected as well.
Each row of servers has a camera, as does the entrance.The room is also protected with a
keyed and numerical pin number access control system.The shipping/receiving area at the
bottom of the diagram is also well protected, not only from people trying to gain access to
the building, but also from thieves trying to steal products that are being shipped out.
Marc will ﬁrst access the facility by driving into the parking structure and poking
around the different entrances to the building from the garage.
As he moves around, Perceptrak detects his behavior as that of an erratic person; instead
of walking in a straight line, as he would if he were going from his car to a door, Marc is
walking back and forth, stopping and turning around. Perceptrak detects this as suspicious
movement and sends an alert.
The operator monitoring the video console receives the alert but decides that it isn’t
important enough to deploy a guard to investigate (similar to what occurs as a false positive
in the intrusion detection world; after you see so many of them, they become easy to
ignore). Instead, the operator tags the alert, the video clip from the incident is automatically
saved, and the operator decides to keep an active video window on his console so that he
can view the parking garage. Figure 15.17 shows alerts in several different areas.The one we
are focused on is the top-middle view, which shows Marc walking through the garage.
Figure 15.17 Perceptrak Console—Erratic Person
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15
473
www.syngress.com

Marc then realizes there is a shipping and receiving area around the side of the building
where he may be able to gain access through an open shipping dock.The video analytics
system alerts the operator that a person is walking through a secure area.The shipping and
receiving area has been identiﬁed as a secure area because products are loaded onto the ship-
ping trucks in this area and would probably be a likely target for thieves. From within the
console, a particular area can be marked off as being secure so that all activity in that area can
be monitored more closely and rules can alert operators when people are entering these
areas.The console snapshot in Figure 15.18 is from SmartCatch and shows the operator’s
view as Marc tries to access the building through shipping and receiving.
Figure 15.18 SmartCatch Console—Accessing Secure Area
As these events are being sent to the ESM system, security analysts begin to suspect that
something is going on.They are looking into the erratic person event that Cernium has
reported, and then they see a person walking through a secure area.The analysts have
decided that this isn’t a problem yet, because this may just be a person out for a cigarette
break or someone who was working in the area during shipping hours who may have for-
gotten something.
Marc doesn’t see an easy way to gain access, so he decides to go back to the parking
garage, thinking that he will attempt to follow another employee into the building.At large
corporations, many employees don’t know each other and wouldn’t think twice about
someone walking through the door behind them. Marc is going to use this to his advantage.
He goes back to the garage and waits for another employee to arrive.As soon as an unsus-
www.syngress.com
474
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

pecting employee heads for the entrance door, Marc speeds up and waits for the door to
almost close before he grabs it and passes through.This action is detected as a tailgating vio-
lation because only one of the two people who passed through the entrance presented an
access card.The SmartCatch system is connected to the physical access system using dry
contacts, so when a user authenticates via the badge reader, an electric signal is sent to
Vidient and is processed, allowing the system to track successful badge access. Figure 15.19
shows how this would look to an operator.
Figure 15.19 SmartCatch Console—Tailgating
In the operator replay of the violation, starting from left to right, we can see how Marc
sneaks into the facility through the parking garage.The person in the far-left clip turns
around and sees that the door is closing.Then he continues to walk, but he doesn’t wait long
enough because Marc stops the door from closing completely and then slowly opens the
door and proceeds to walk into the facility. We can see Marc as he comes through the door
in the far-right clip. Now in the building, Marc looks like a normal employee. He is dressed
professionally and would probably not be questioned by anyone as he walks around
attempting to ﬁnd the data center. Once he ﬁnds the data center, he is going to wait for
another unsuspecting person to either exit or enter the data center. Luckily for Marc, he
doesn’t have to wait long before a technician who doesn’t even work for the company exits
the data center, pushing a cart ﬁlled with equipment. Marc uses this as an opportunity to
help the technician by holding the door open for him as he pushes out the cart.This is why
it’s extremely important to monitor not only who enters a data center, but also who leaves
the data center or any other secure environment.This way, the physical access system used to
badge out would complement the video as proof of who let Marc slip through without pre-
senting any identiﬁcation or using the physical access system to badge into the secured area.
www.syngress.com
Intelligent Video Analytics • Chapter 15
475

The monitoring system can tell the difference between the cart that the technician is
pushing and another human, so it doesn’t trigger an alert when the cart passes through, but
it does when Marc enters the data center.The reviewing operators review the clip and
determine that it was probably some confusion with the cart and decide that they don’t
need to respond.
Marc is now in the data center. He begins to look around for the servers that are on his
list. He ﬁnds some of the systems and he turns on a shared console. First he tries to access the
Windows system as guest, test, and then administrator, using all the standard passwords he can
think of. He tries password, admin, the company name, and several other passwords before the
user accounts are locked out. Because he is unable to gain logical access to the system, he gets
frustrated and powers down the server. He decides that it’s going to be simpler to just steal
the actual hard drives from the system. Because most servers these days have hot-swappable
drives, it is extremely easy to just remove the actual disks from the front of the server. Marc
loads up his backpack with stolen hard drives and ﬁgures that he will be able to mount them
using an external Universal Serial Bus (USB) hard drive adapter and gain access to any data
on these drives.The server shutting down and the password-guessing attempts cause the ESM
system to generate several alerts based on the suspicious activity that has been observed.
The ﬁrst correlation event is a medium-priority alert triggered by the default account
attempts. It is considered to be suspicious—or at least bad security practice—to have default
accounts enabled on systems.That being the case, there should never be login attempts using
these accounts unless a system is conﬁgured incorrectly or someone is attempting to gain
access via a default account which probably has a default password set.The ESM system
keeps track of these accounts, and whenever an authentication attempt is made using one of
these accounts, a correlation event is triggered and the assigned actions are taken. In this case,
it’s probably just reviewed by an analyst because the attempt was not successful.
The other correlation rules that ﬁred indicates a critical server shutdown and a brute
force login attempt.The brute force rule was triggered because there were multiple failed
logins on the same system using the same user account.This was when Marc was attempting
to guess the administrator password.
Figure 15.20 shows the correlation rule and the rule chain that caused it to ﬁre.The
rule chain consists of the events that matched the exact conditions speciﬁed in the rule logic.
The logic in this rule is looking for more than ﬁve failed logins, speciﬁed by the following
condition:
Category Behavior=/Authentication/Verify and Category Outcome=/Failure
This rule is written to be vendor independently by using the security category tax-
onomy.The rule logic also speciﬁes that all ﬁve events have to be targeting the same host, so
the target host of all ﬁve events has to be equal.The username is not speciﬁed, so attempting
to use different usernames will still cause the conditions to be met.
www.syngress.com
476
Chapter 15 • Intelligent Video Analytics

Figure 15.20 ArcSight Active Channel—Brute Force Login Attempt 
The correlation event in Figure 15.20 is indicated by the lightning bolt in the ﬁrst
column generated by ArcSight ESM.The other events are the ones leading up to the rule
ﬁring, reported by Microsoft Windows. Several automated actions are taken at this point, as
conﬁgured as part of the correlation rule. Because the usernames that were attempted don’t
really belong to anyone, there is no accountability, so the analysts don’t know who is actually
attempting to brute force the system.To solve this problem, one of the rule actions is to
trigger the surveillance system to take a snapshot of the area where the incident occurred.
Some video analytics systems have interfaces through which you can instruct the system to
take a snapshot of the current environment. ESM is set up in such a way that the zone
where the violation occurred maps to a speciﬁc set of cameras, so the correlation engine can
pass the location to the script as a variable to tell the analytics system on which cameras to
trigger the snapshot.The snapshot can then be accessed over the Web directly in the ESM
console.The snapshot can also be appended to the associated trouble ticket that is generated
when this type of violation occurs.This is how a closed-loop workﬂow is deﬁned.
The analysts now have not only the events that occurred, but also a picture of the
intruder. In this case, the picture is extremely important because it shows that this is not an
internal user, and the account that was being used was administrator, so it’s not associated with
any particular user.
The case editor in Figure 15.21 shows the Events tab where the events that are part of
the incident are stored.The detailed view at the bottom of the ﬁgure shows the target zone
information.This is the value that is passed to the video analytics system to have the snap-
shot taken on the correct cameras. Figure 15.22 shows Marc as he is standing in the data
center, captured in a snapshot triggered by ESM.

Marc has not been successful in logically accessing any of the servers, but he does have a
backpack full of hard drives and he attempts to leave the building.The security analysts call
the physical security team and alert them to the breach, at which point a team of guards is
deployed to apprehend Marc as he leaves the data center.The security team ﬁnds the stolen
disk drives in Marc’s backpack, and he is detained until the authorities arrive.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we explored the power of intelligent video analytics combined with logical
security events as part of a closed-loop incident detection and investigation process. Video
analytics systems, although fairly new, are becoming more prevalent in today’s security infras-
tructure.As cameras are becoming increasingly less expensive and the need for surveillance
increases, the number of operators to monitor video systems would be the biggest concern.
Video analytics allows organizations to spend less money on human operators, who, after less
than an hour of staring at a video screen, are mostly ineffective anyway. Using video analytics
systems to streamline an operator’s workﬂow allows organizations to achieve operational efﬁ-
ciencies, because the operators are only looking at video that they are alerted to by the ana-
lytics software. In other words, they are only investigating possible incidents or violations,
thus using their time much more productively.
The convergence of products such as those from Cernium and Vidient with ESM plat-
forms is a natural extension to the current data feeds that are collected by ESM.The beneﬁts
are not only enhanced insider threat detection, but also protection against physical perimeter
threats and public safety concerns.The integration allows for ESM to continue being the
single pane of glass into the overall security posture of the enterprise as it relates not only to
logical security, but physical security as well.

Introduction
This chapter focuses on the beneﬁts of integrating environmental sensor products with
Enterprise Security Management (ESM). Environmental sensors are intended to alert and
respond to physical threats to IT systems and prevent disasters such as water leakage, temper-
ature increases, and emmisions of dangerous gases from causing a massive outage.According
to the Wall Street Journal,“Downtime costs the average Fortune 500 company
$50,000/minute.” Server rooms overheating or wiring closets ﬁlling up with water can and
will cause outages and downtime for businesses. Because the ultimate goal of any IT profes-
sional is to ensure that critical systems are available, it doesn’t matter whether the threat is
caused by a hacker or the environment. With an early warning system and strategic policies
in place you can achieve and maintain operational efﬁciencies.
Environmental Sensors: 
A Technology Background
Environmental monitoring is not a new idea. For example, for some time now, chemical
plants and factories have been using equipment to monitor their production lines for
increases in temperature that could cause failures or explosions due to chemical instability in
different temperature zones. Hotels use very basic sensors to ensure that rooms remain at a
certain temperature. Food distribution companies use sensors to make sure freezers are oper-
ating correctly. Even homeowners use sensors in the form of smoke and carbon monoxide
detectors to alert them of the need to evacuate in the case of ﬁre or potentially lethal levels
of carbon monoxide.All of these technologies have been adapted and applied to computing
environments.
More recent is the trend of incorporating environmental sensors into IT processes. For
years, most servers have been able to detect when they are overheating and send simple mes-
sages to a receiver using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). It is a good
idea to gather this information for many reasons.Typically, computer hardware is not
designed to work in extreme temperatures; that is why data centers are air conditioned to
keep systems cool and prevent an outage, which can cause hundreds of thousands of dollars’
worth of damage.
In the past, environmental factors were monitored on switchboards that would turn red
when there was a problem, and a crew would be deployed to investigate and respond to the
problem. However, these out-of-band communication systems were costly to deploy and
maintain.These days, everything is done over Ethernet, where a base unit can communicate
and receive alerts from various probes all over a standard Internet Protocol (IP) network.
Many different types of environmental sensors are available. Some monitor data center
environments and others focus on physical security threats. Let’s look at some of the more
common types of sensors and why they are important in mission-critical environments:

Chapter 16 • Environmental Sensors

■
Voltage sensors Regular batteries or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) bat-
teries are prone to corrosion, causing leakage, short circuits, failures, and power
ﬂuctuations. Power ﬂuctuations can cause damage to equipment and battery fail-
ures can lead to outages.
■
Humidity sensors If an area is too humid, corrosion can result, which can cause
battery leakage, rusting, and premature aging of equipment.
■
Temperature sensors Servers are not designed to run in abnormal temperatures.
Temperature sensors most commonly detect air conditioning outages, especially in
data centers.
■
Fluid sensors Many times wiring cabinets are installed underground or in base-
ments, where they are prone to water leakage. Water and electronics don’t mix.
■
Airﬂow sensors Airﬂow sensors are used to ensure that enough air is ﬂowing
through a particular area to prevent hot spots.The temperature may be okay where
a sensor is located, but if the airﬂow is blocked, other areas may become too hot.
■
Motion sensors These can be deployed in secure areas where access is prohibited
and operators can be alerted to the presence of a person.
■
Audio sensors These can be deployed to detect noise—from breaking glass to
the sound of an alarm.
When a sensor generates an alarm, a notiﬁcation is sent using various vehicles, such as
SNMP and e-mail. It is usually up to an operator to respond to these alerts and ensure that
the issue is resolved, but what if the alarm occurs in a remote location? It would be inefﬁ-
cient for someone to travel to the remote location to ﬁx the problem on-site. Fortunately, a
suite of remote management capabilities are available to allow for remote response.
Remote Response
Remote response is a key capability when dealing with environmental alarms. When the
temperature rises in a data center, operators need to be able to administer systems even if the
system is not responding due to component failures. Similarly, if a water leak is detected in a
remote wiring closet, operators should be able to automatically activate a sump pump to
keep the equipment from being destroyed.These types of responses are available and have
been fairly well adopted.
The IPMI Standard
A standard for monitoring and managing computer systems, the Intelligent Platform
Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of interfaces used to communicate with computer
hardware and ﬁrmware.They are out-of-band interfaces, meaning that even if a system is pow-
ered down, communication is still possible.The setup consists of a baseboard controller that
www.syngress.com
Environmental Sensors • Chapter 16
483

operates on standby power and periodically polls systems to detect issues such as chassis
intrusion, drive bay intrusion, processor area intrusion, and problems with the unit’s fans.
Because the baseboard does not use the system’s main power supply to operate, administra-
tors can access it directly over Ethernet using the system’s network interface card (NIC), or
via a serial connection.Administrative tasks can be performed, such as a soft shutdown or
even powering on a system that has been turned off.
NOTE
Many large computer manufacturers, including Dell, HP, Intel, and IBM, have
adopted the IPMI standard. All of the newer Dell servers, for example, use
this standard for management via the Open Manage software that comes
with the standard server package. 
The following is a list of some of the key information contained in the IPMI standard:
■
Packet format This speciﬁes how a packet should be structured in order to
communicate with an IPMI-enabled system over Ethernet.
■
Other communication mechanisms Serial or modem
■
Sensor codes The standard explains how sensor codes enable programmers to
understand the meanings of values being communicated via IPMI.
■
How to retrieve information The standard includes information on the correct
way to communicate with an IPMI-enabled system and request data from a partic-
ular component.
You can download the IPMI standard from the Intel Web site, at
www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi. In addition, open source command line-interface tools
are available that enable communication with baseboards, allowing you to script and auto-
mate tasks.These tools are available from SourceForge, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmitool.

Chapter 16 • Environmental Sensors

Figure 16.1 Dell Server Being Monitored via IPMI (Source: APC/NetBotz)
As you can see in the lower right corner of Figure 16.1, the output provides detailed
information about the current state of the system, including the temperature of many of the
system’s components and even the speed of the system’s fans.This interface also allows a user
with the correct permissions to power off or restart the server.
Dry Contacts
A dry contact is a circuit that is in either an open or a closed state and can be used to monitor
and control third-party systems.These types of circuits are very common in window alarms;
for example, once a window that is outﬁtted with a dry contact circuit is opened, the circuit
is broken and an alarm is triggered. In the case of response and remediation, dry contacts can
be used to control other electronic devices, such as sump pumps, auxiliary fans, and air con-
ditioning units. Dry contacts comprise part of an electronic relay with the device, and when
activated, they can power an electronic device off or on.They act like a switch that you can
control remotely by sending electrical currents to it. If a dry contact is open, it is like
sending an off signal to the system to which it’s connected. If a current is sent to the contact,
it turns to the closed position and allows the current to go to the attached system, which
powers it on.This allows for all kinds of equipment to be remotely managed and operated.

Imagine the earlier case of the remote wiring closet ﬁlling with water because it’s in a base-
ment and there is ﬂooding in the area.The ﬂuid detection sensor detects ﬂuid on the ground
and alerts an operator.The operator can then send a command to the dry contact that tells
the sump pump to turn on.
Figure 16.2 shows how you can use a dry contact and a switch to turn a light bulb on
and off.At the bottom right of the ﬁgure, you can see a constant power source running to
the light bulb.The light bulb, of course, will not work unless it is grounded; as you can see,
the ground wire is running off to the left.The dry contact is essentially the break in the
ground wire where, rather than being fully connected, both sides connect back to a switch
or a relay, be it a manual switch or a switch that can be sent a command to open or close.
The current state is open, which means the light bulb is not grounded, so it is off. If the
switch closes, it in effect connects the ground wire, thus turning the light on. In some cases,
the switch can be sent a command from a remote system instructing it to open or close the
dry contact. Similar applications of this technology are being used in the automated home
projects being conducted by MIT and others.

Response to Environmental Threats
Although a variety of products are available for integrating environmental modeling with
ESM, one that stands out is NetBotz, recently acquired by APC. NetBotz offers a complete
solution which includes video monitoring capabilities. In addition,APC is a huge player in

the market for controlling and monitoring power in the data center, with a product line that
includes everything from UPSes and batteries, to power management appliances. Because of
its ubiquity, we have decided to focus on the NetBotz solution in our explanation of envi-
ronmental monitoring and ESM.
The NetBotz Solution
NetBotz devices come in several sizes; you choose the one that’s right for you based on the
size of the deployment and the number of sensors being monitored.The company’s low-end
appliance is ideal for monitoring a few sensors located in wiring closets or very small equip-
ment rooms; its intermediate option can be used to monitor an average server room, and its
high-end appliance can be used to monitor a data center.The larger the appliance, the more
expandable it is because it provides more ports for sensor pods and the capability to link up
with other appliances.This appliance has built-in sensors which monitor its immediate
vicinity. It also includes a built-in camera, as well as ports which are used to expand the
monitoring capabilities with additional sensors that are deployed throughout the data center
or monitored area.
You can use a range of sensors with the NetBotz devices. Some are built by NetBotz
and others are either third-party or NetBotz-branded third-party sensors.Add-ons include
additional cameras, and sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, airﬂow, audio, ﬂuids,
particles, vibration, glass breakages, and gas; using third-party dry contact sensors, you can
monitor a large number of additional products. With all these sensors, the ability to monitor
for nearly any type of natural or environmental problem is possible and extremely easy
because all of the sensors are Plug and Play.
Layout of a Fully Monitored Data Center 
The fully monitored data center seems to be the main driver for most of the functionality
that is available with the NetBotz product, and the reason that most companies purchase an
environmental monitoring solution such as NetBotz.The sensor pods are inexpensive, so
there isn’t a problem deploying multiple sensors in a single rack.The recommended setup is
usually three temperature sensors per rack, depending on the number of servers.The high-
powered 1 u systems available today generate more heat than traditional servers, and organi-
zations usually have more of them, so the concentration of heat is greater. Water leakage
sensors should be deployed under a raised ﬂoor because a leak will go unnoticed since there
is typically at least 18 inches underneath the tiles. Water leak sensors should also be deployed
around any type of portable cooling unit as these are prone to leaks. If there are windows in
the data center glass break sensors should be deployed and electronic locks can be put on the
cabinets which can report on access.

Components of a Defense in Depth Strategy
Utilizing a product such as NetBotz allows an organization to take a defense in depth
approach to the physical security of its data center or critical environment. Rather than
relying on human input or patrols by staff to ensure that the environment is running well,
the NetBotz devices provide built-in 24/7 monitoring. Not only will the device alert staff
when it detects a rise in temperature, but it will also report many other environmental con-
ditions that may cause harm. Figure 16.3 shows the complete defense in depth protection
that you can achieve by fully deploying an environmental monitoring solution.
Figure 16.3 Complete Defense in Depth Protection
Figure 16.3 depicts a logical view of a data center that has been protected using an in-
depth strategy.As you can see, temperature increases, which you would expect to detect
using an environmental monitoring product, are not the only threat to your critical systems.
Detection needs to span the full spectrum of environmental threats, so sensors are in place to
detect other harmful conditions such as electrical problems due to spikes and outages.
Electrical spikes can damage equipment if systems are not protected with surge protectors.
Water is also a huge threat to electronics.This is just something a human would not see
before the water level rises to a point that it’s already causing damage. Hazardous chemicals

and audible alarms are extremely important as well, and battery packs can emit poisonous
gases when they get older or short out, which is extremely harmful to humans. Of course,
what in-depth strategy would be complete without video surveillance? By deploying cam-
eras in the data center, a user doesn’t have to make the trip to see what’s going on, and if an
unauthorized change has been made, it’s easy to review a video tape to pinpoint the guilty
party.
In the typical data center, racks are positioned using the concept of hot isle/cold isle.
This means that if there are multiple rows of server racks, the rear of the systems will face
each other and the front of the systems will face each other.This is done for cooling pur-
poses; the airﬂow can be directed down the hot isles where most of the heat is being
exhausted by the computer’s fans. When using a defense in depth strategy, you should place
humidity sensors in the hot isles, and you should place cameras so that they have a clear
view of all the racks.The cameras can be recording all the time, or you can activate them
using motion sensors to record access to systems and/or equipment racks. Figure 16.4 shows
an example of a fully monitored data center using the NetBotz solution.

APC/NetBotz)
Deployment
Because most organizations are spread out across many geographies and have data centers
and environments that require monitoring in many different locations, the NetBotz appli-
ances can be managed via a centralized management system known as InfraStruXure
www.syngress.com
Environmental Sensors • Chapter 16
489

Central.The management console allows for administration of all associated appliances from
one console and serves as the master repository for alarms and events generated by individual
appliances.The structure uses the same concept as multiple intrusion detection sensors con-
necting back to a centralized logging facility. One of the main beneﬁts of using the manage-
ment console is the ability to conﬁgure all of your sensors of a particular type at once. For
example, if you want to lower the temperature at which alarms will be generated, you can
conﬁgure the sensor type and push the conﬁguration out to all of the different appliances.
Figure 16.5 shows a console connected to InfraStruXure Central while performing device
conﬁguration.
Figure 16.5 Console Connected to InfraStruXure Central While Performing
Device Conﬁguration (Source: APC/NetBotz)
Figure 16.5 represents the starting point after logging into InfraStruXure Central. In the
upper-lefthand pane are the different locations where devices are deployed.This allows users
to quickly bring focus to a particular area by highlighting the appropriate leaf in the tree. For
example, if a user wanted to control or manage all of the devices in the C200 Server Room,
he would simply highlight the appropriate node in the tree and the focus would be on only
those devices. In the lower-righthand pane are the devices that are deployed in the high-
lighted node from the pane in the top left. Because all devices are highlighted, the lower-
righthand pane shows all of the devices that are deployed. If the C200 Server Room were
highlighted, the bottom-left pane would only display devices in that location.The top-right
www.syngress.com
490
Chapter 16 • Environmental Sensors

pane allows an administrator to make global or local conﬁguration changes to be pushed out
to the sensors, and the bottom-right pane allows for the administration and management of
the product.This is a very important part of centralized deployment.This ability to conﬁgure
all sensors of a particular type saves the administrator hours, considering the number of sen-
sors that are typically deployed in a well-protected data center.
Figure 16.5 also shows the ﬁrst step of performing mass conﬁguration. In the top-right
panel you can see the different types of sensors available, including airﬂow settings, tempera-
ture, and humidity. If you want to change the temperature setting, for example, you simply
double-click the temperature icon and the screen shown in Figure 16.6 appears.
Figure 16.6 Setting Temperature Thresholds (Source APC/NetBotz)
From the control panel shown in Figure 16.6, you select all or a particular number of
sensors, look at their current readings, and change their minimum and maximum values.The
process to conﬁgure other types of sensors is similar in that you’re usually setting a minimum
and maximum threshold.
Log Format
The sensors report alerts back to InfraStruXure Central via the appliance that is managing
the sensor.Anytime the sensor detects, for example, a change in temperature that is above or
below its threshold, it will report back to its managing appliance, which then reports the
alert back to InfraStruXure Central, where the alert is stored in a Postgres SQL database. We
have discussed database integration in several of the use case chapters of this book, including
Chapter 15. Database integration is typically one of the easiest ways for an ESM connector
to integrate with other devices. It is even more ideal when the database is already a collector
and aggregator of alerts from the point devices.

Figure 16.7 shows alerts viewed in the NetBotz operator console.You use this alert view
to pull up alerts from any of the deployed appliances or any of the individual sensors
attached to one of the appliances.

ferent sensors are placed.This map allows a user to quickly access a particular area without
having to know the sensor’s IP address or name.The map in the ﬁgure happens to be a map

of NetBotz headquarters in Austin,Texas. We can see that several different areas within the
organization either are under surveillance or are being monitored for environmental factors.
Even the kitchen seems to be under surveillance (perhaps someone is stealing leftovers from
the refrigerator; a common problem in a corporate environment).
Accessing the NetBotz console is nice, but our goal is to get these alerts into an ESM
system.The idea is to be able to get this information directly from the backend database that
is storing these alerts.To do so we need to connect the NetBotz device to the ESM solu-
tion. With that in mind, the ﬁrst step to building a connector for NetBotz is to understand
how the alert table is structured within the database, and to understand the different data
values.Table 16.1 is a sample of data that we pulled from the alert table on NetBotz
InfraStruXure Central located at NetBotz headquarters.
Table 16.1 Data Sample Pulled from Alert Table on NetBotz InfraStruXure
Central (Source: APC / NetBotz )
When building the connector, our ﬁrst task is to understand the data structure of the
event table within the NetBotz database. By looking at a schema diagram with explanations
of the ﬁelds, as well as looking at a database export containing values, we can decide which
ﬁelds are relevant for the integration.The export shown in Table 16.1 is the result of a query
www.syngress.com
Environmental Sensors • Chapter 16
493

that is pulling all of the ﬁelds that are relevant for integration with ESM. Once the ﬁelds are
identiﬁed, we need to build the query that the connector will use to poll the database.
Table 16.1 shows several sample events reported from several different sensors. We now
decide where in the ESM schema we want to put these values. Most of them are fairly
obvious, starting with the time_stamp ﬁeld.This tells us when the alert occurred, so we will
map that to the ESM ﬁeld end time. Meanwhile, the alert_type ﬁeld tells us why the alert
was triggered, and the Alert ﬁeld says what the alert was. So, we concatenate these ﬁelds to
form the event name ﬁeld. By concatenating these ﬁelds, we include more information
describing the event in one ﬁeld. It doesn’t make sense to go to two different ﬁelds to see
this information.
Now that we have the event name and time_stamp ﬁelds, we need to deal with the
Location, severity, and ip_address ﬁelds. Dealing with the severity and IP address is very easy.
We will simply map the IP address to the device address ﬁeld in the ESM system.The device
address ﬁeld is used to represent the IP address of the device that originally generated the alert.
Because the device hostname is not present in the database, it will be picked up by the con-
nector via domain name system (DNS) and will be automatically populated.We will map the
severity ﬁeld to a normalized severity within the ESM system.The severity Error will map to
High,Warning will map to Medium, and Failure and Critical will map to Very High.
The attached_device ﬁeld refers to the type of sensor unit that is detecting the alarm.
We will map this to the device product.The sensor ﬁeld is the actual module of the product
that is detecting the alert.The sensor pods have multiple sensing capabilities built in, and
each is performing a different function. We will map this to the device facility ﬁeld.
The Location ﬁeld is important because we need to know where alerts are occurring; by
mapping this ﬁeld to a device custom ﬁeld, we will be able to access it in the ESM system. If
we were using NetBotz to monitor multiple locations, and the location ﬁelds and naming con-
vention were not intuitive, we would not know where to go to investigate an incident. In the
next section, we will see how we solve this problem using assets within an ESM system.
Figure 16.8 shows the same events from Table 16.1, but as seen by an analyst in the ESM
system. In the ﬁgure, an active channel is using a ﬁeld set that shows the relevant ﬁelds of
NetBotz events.A ﬁeld set is a preconﬁgured set of ﬁelds that is used when analyzing events
from different sources.A ﬁeld set is useful for accessing information more quickly because if
you know that a particular device populates particular ﬁelds, you can build a ﬁeld set and
apply it to the analyst’s views.

Figure 16.8 Events from Table 16.1 As Seen by an Analyst in the ESM
System (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Getting the events into an ESM system is not very difﬁcult, but some technical and
organizational challenges do exist. We will look at some of these challenges and solutions in
the next section.
Challenges of Integration
With a little creativity, you can overcome the challenges of integrating a product such as
NetBotz with ESM.The log format, as we saw in the preceding section, is very straightfor-
ward, and the logs are centrally stored, which makes data collection extremely simple.
The ﬁrst concern that comes to mind is how to identify where the alarms are occur-
ring. Let’s look at an example where we are monitoring multiple data centers and we get an
alert saying that there is a temperature problem. How would an analyst using ESM know
where the alert is occurring? The sensors should be treated as devices, and to keep track of
them, they are treated as assets within the ESM system, allowing them to be classiﬁed by
location, function, and criticality. Each device that is reporting into the ESM system is con-
sidered to be an asset that can be categorized within a ﬂexible hierarchy.
The ability to treat sensors as assets allows the analyst to enhance events using asset-spe-
ciﬁc attributes that more clearly identify the attack situation.This inﬂuences the response
process that an analyst will follow. Let’s look at another active channel that has been
enhanced with asset information (see Figure 16.9).This channel compares to the one shown
in Figure 16.8, except the events have been enhanced and provide a little more detail to an
analyst.
In Figure 16.9, we see the alarms that are occurring as well as the criticality of the loca-
tion, the location of the sensor, and the type of sensor (the last three ﬁelds on the right). If
an operator is looking at this view and sees these alerts, he will know which alerts to
respond to ﬁrst based on the information in the Location Criticality and Sensor Location
ﬁelds.The information in the Sensor Location ﬁeld is particularly helpful, because without
it, the operator would have to use multiple consoles to get his job done. In addition, an
operator could use the information in this ﬁeld to identify trends in problems occurring in
different locations. Over a period of time, he could gather statistics on a per-location basis,
www.syngress.com
Environmental Sensors • Chapter 16
495

and if problems continue, he could provide the results to the co-location and/or building
management responsible for keeping environmental settings normal within data centers or
server rooms.
Figure 16.9 Active Channel Enhanced with Asset Information (Source:
ArcSight ESM v4.0)
If NetBotz is only sending a simple event to the ESM system, you may be wondering
how the location, criticality, and sensor type are derived. Each NetBotz sensor is automati-
cally imported into the ESM system and is represented as an asset. Once the system is recog-
nized as an asset, all of the asset functionality within the ESM system is available.The ﬁrst
step is to build a categorization taxonomy that will be used to describe the assets—in this
case, the NetBotz sensors.The attributes we are concerned with are Location, Location
Criticality, and Sensor Type. Figure 16.10 shows the category hierarchy we used for this
example.
Figure 16.10 shows what’s known as the Navigator within ArcSight ESM. In the ﬁgure,
Asset Categories is selected; this is where we build out our taxonomy. Starting from the
Environmental Monitoring leaf, we see the Location and Sensor Type.The Sensor Type is a
ﬂat group whereas the Location has many children, all the way to the level of the actual
server room where the sensor resides.
This brings up our second integration concern, which is nontechnical but more of an
organizational challenge: Who do you call? If an organization has a centralized network
operation center/security operation center (NOC/SOC) in Boston, for example, and it
receives alarms for servers in a data center in San Francisco, who does the organization call?
How would the operator know which person or group should respond? This is where poli-
cies and procedures need to come into place regarding response processes. ESM can alert dif-
ferent groups and escalate among users as well as assign owners to different sensors or assets.
If the correct alerting setup is in place, the appropriate people in San Francisco will be
alerted automatically and an operator in an SOC or NOC would just need to verify that the
alarm has been cleared. If there is no automatic notiﬁcation setup, the operator would need
to investigate the sensor manually and see who the asset owner is and which group should
www.syngress.com
496
Chapter 16 • Environmental Sensors

be notiﬁed when there is an issue with that asset.All of this information is available by
double-clicking on the alarm reported into the ESM system.
Figure 16.10 Category Hierarchy (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
Now that you have a better understanding of what type of data you can get from an
environmental monitoring product such as NetBotz, let’s walk through a use case that high-
lights the beneﬁts of integrating environmental sensors with ESM.
Data Center Meltdown
Air conditioning failure in the data center is a use case that is not far from an IT adminis-
trator’s heart. If you have ever been in an operations role or been responsible for a large
number of servers, you know the last thing you want is to come to the ofﬁce and ﬁnd a
catastrophe.
The following example is exactly that: a catastrophe.The air conditioning units on the
roof of a building that houses a San Francisco data center for a large organization have failed.
The main person responsible for the daily operations of the data center is Jason. Jason’s boss
is Bruce. On-call duties rotate among group members and a pager is used to notify the team
when there is trouble with systems for which they are responsible. On a normal Sunday
night, Jason is preparing for work the next morning and he logs on to some of the servers
that he uses in the data center and sees that everything is running normally.
www.syngress.com
Environmental Sensors • Chapter 16
497

Monday morning Jason arrives at the ofﬁce in downtown San Francisco to ﬁnd a dis-
aster. Every system on the HP Open View display is RED.This usually means that the moni-
toring application cannot ping the servers. He tries to access some of the servers from his
desktop and is unable to gain access.The systems are not responding. He goes to the base-
ment of the building, which houses the data center, and to his dismay he ﬁnds the doors
open and his boss yelling at the building management staff. Jason immediately knows what
happened because the big fans in the data center are blowing hot air through the data center
doors.The air conditioning units have failed.The building management company found the
problem at around 6:00 that morning and didn’t notify its customers. Luckily for this organi-
zation, Bruce is an early bird.
Bruce is extremely upset and Jason knows there is going to be trouble. Fortunately for
Jason, it was not his week to be on call, so the pages were going to a coworker who didn’t
respond. If the escalation system were more advanced, lack of a response in the ﬁrst 10 min-
utes of an alert would have escalated to the second-level destination (Jason). However, this
wasn’t the case in Jason’s organization, and although this wasn’t Jason’s fault, the situation
resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to the organization’s equip-
ment. Drastic temperature increases for an extended period of time will cause damage to
many different server components.After the incident occurred, many systems didn’t power
on, several hard disks were corrupted, and some of the processors had completely stopped
working.And because of the incident, many of the warranties on the systems were voided
and the ones that weren’t continued to have periodic failures due to the event.As soon as
the systems started running again, the employee who was on call (but didn’t respond ini-
tially) received around three hundred pages saying there were problems in the data center.
This is because the system responsible for sending the pages was one of the ﬁrst to die.
How could this organization have avoided this catastrophe? Let’s walk through the same
scenario, but this time using ArcSight and NetBotz. We will replace the heads-up display
(HUD) with a HUD that can be easily built within the ESM system. We will replace the
third-party notiﬁcation system with an integrated notiﬁcation and escalation process, and
rather than take a substantial loss we will power off the systems before they are damaged.
Finally, we’ll be the ones to alert building management of the problem.
First, let’s build a HUD for use in the NOC. Figure 16.11 shows a HUD for each loca-
tion that the NOC is responsible for monitoring. Each node represents a location, and when
there is a problem, the associated node will change state to represent that an alarm was
received for that location.This would be displayed on the wall of the NOC and used during
working hours to monitor the environmental status of the organization’s data centers.These
nodes are built using the same asset context that we talked about in the preceding section.

Monitoring (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
The HUD in Figure 16.11 shows an individual node for each location being monitored
in the NOC.The dashboard shows that all is well because each location has a status of
Normal.The location is indicated on the title bar of each node and the status is indicated in
the center of the node. When alarms come in from the different sensors, the display will
change to reﬂect the current alarm status.These mappings are conﬁgurable and can be used
by operations groups to display any kind of stateful data.
Figure 16.12 shows what happens when we receive the alarm regarding the temperature
increase in the San Francisco data center. Notice that the status changes from Normal to
Temp Critical.
If this alarm happened during the day, an operator could call the appropriate parties, and
if it were a false alarm, the operator could right-click on the node and reset the status back
to Normal (see Figure 16.13).

However, in our scenario, the air conditioners have failed in the middle of the night, and
the organization does not have 24/7 on-site monitoring. Nevertheless, ESM is conﬁgured to
send notiﬁcations to different teams depending on the location of the alarms and the criti-
cality. If the alarm is just a warning, the system will not send a notiﬁcation during off-hours.
If the alarm is critical, it sends an e-mail notiﬁcation to a capable pager, such as Skytel.The
notiﬁcation system also includes settings for escalation based on severity. If the alarm is of
low severity, the system will wait for two hours before escalating; if it is of medium or high
severity, it will wait for less time.A critical severity alarm at Jason’s organization has been
conﬁgured to escalate after 10 minutes. Even with a time frame of 10 minutes the person
being notiﬁed has many different options to respond. He can respond directly to the e-mail
notiﬁcation, log on to the Web-based console and acknowledge the notiﬁcations there, or
log on to the main analyst console. Figure 16.14 shows the notiﬁcation and escalation set-
tings for the team in charge of the San Francisco data center.

of the San Francisco Data Center (Source: ArcSight ESM v4.0)
The box on the left shows the escalation path for the San Francisco data center team.
The ﬁrst level is Sean; depending on the escalation wait times shown on the right, after a
certain period Jason will be notiﬁed. Obviously, the goal is to never have the system notify
Bruce.

The critical temperature alarm from Figure 16.12 comes in from a NetBotz sensor pod
at 2:00 Monday morning.This is long before Bruce will arrive at work, and probably at least
an hour or two before he wakes up and starts replying to e-mail. So, the ﬁrst e-mail notiﬁca-
tion goes to Sean’s cell phone. He doesn’t respond in time, so the system automatically noti-
ﬁes Jason. Jason is at home and is not able to access his analyst console, so he decides to log
in via the Web interface and acknowledge his notiﬁcation before driving to the data center
to see what’s wrong.
Once Jason arrives at the data center, he immediately notices that it is far too hot.The
temperature is at least 90 degrees, so he calls the building management company to get
someone on-site. He then proceeds to shut down the servers manually while he waits for the
rest of his team to come in and help. By having processes and products in place to notify and
alert when there are potential disasters, hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment
damage was prevented.
Conclusion
Monitoring for security incidents—whether internal or external—is extremely important.
With that being said, one of the three most important reasons we try to protect ourselves is
to ensure availability. If an information system is unavailable, the business process that relies
on that system is going to fail.This is why monitoring for environmental problems is just as
important as monitoring for malicious attacks against an organization. Some of the condi-
tions that can be detected, such as ﬂoods or increases in dangerous gases, could be detri-
mental to an organization if they go unnoticed.The emergence of products such as NetBotz
makes sense in today’s IT infrastructure.The beneﬁts of integrating environmental alarms to
the converged NOC/SOC using an ESM solution shows how efﬁcient an operations team
can be. One team with different expertise can respond to critical conditions, regardless of
whether they are security-related or systems-related, using the same products and processes.
In this chapter, we discussed the functionality of a basic system monitoring product both
with and without environmental sensors in place. Jason was at home when he received a
notiﬁcation, logged on via a Web console, and was able to arrive at the data center in time to
avoid a major loss of equipment. Jason was able to power down the servers manually, but he
would not have been able to do so if his organization housed thousands or even hundreds of
servers. One or two people would have been unable to safely shut down that many systems
before a drastic rise in temperature caused damage. In that situation, it would make sense to
have a correlation rule within the ESM solution that would execute a shutdown action on
all servers in a particular location. For this to happen, the organization would need precise
deﬁnitions regarding what would constitute a true alarm as opposed to a false positive (for as
anyone in the IT industry knows, the last thing you want to do is shut down a data center
needlessly).A more practical solution is to build a tool within the console that can query for
all the IP addresses in a location and then, using an IPMI integration, systematically perform
a soft shutdown on the servers.This would at least require operator intervention to verify
that the alarm is indeed viable and the systems need to be turned off to avoid damage.

Introduction
You may not be aware of it, you may not even consider it, but critical infrastructure allows
for all of the modern-day conveniences we are used to.The health of the nation depends on
the infrastructure that provides electricity, moves and controls water, provides gas and oil, and
ensures the operation of our transportation and communication networks. When we ﬂick a
light switch, when we get a glass of water, when we pump gas into our cars, when we dial
9-1-1 in an emergency—all of these things that we may take for granted are available to us
because of the infrastructure that supports the delivery of these goods and services.
It is impractical to think that every time water needs to be redirected or electricity
needs to be routed down a different line that someone would actually go on-site and physi-
cally make the change.That obviously wouldn’t make sense.This is where process control
systems come into play.These systems monitor and control critical infrastructures as well as a
number of other applications, such as automotive manufacturing plants and hospitals. In this
chapter, we will explore how process control systems work, with an emphasis on the systems
used by the oil and gas industry.These systems are commonly referred to as Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Most of the time when people are talking
about process control systems they mention SCADA, although SCADA is a subset of the
larger process control system.
This chapter will take a slightly different approach than some of the other use-cases
chapters in the book.The ﬁrst section examines process control and SCADA systems, fol-
lowed by the reasons convergence is necessary and the challenges and threats that face the
organizations responsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure. We will also hear
from two industry experts in one-on-one interviews detailing real-world examples of prob-
lems found in process control networks.
From a longevity perspective, protecting a nation’s critical infrastructure is far more
important than any business system, Web site, or individual organization. Without power,
water, and oil, you may as well forget about the ﬁnancial database or the Web server that got
hacked, or even the personal information that disappeared on your laptop.There is a serious
threat out there, especially from terror organizations that want to inﬂict the most damage
they can with no regard for human life.This is not at all meant to be a scare tactic, but the
threat is real and only through a converged solution between the infrastructure owners, the
logical security vendors, and the infrastructure control vendors will a nation’s infrastructure
be protected.After you read this chapter, the beneﬁts of a converged monitoring and detec-
tion solution providing a single pane of glass into both physical and logical threats will be
apparent.

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Technology Background: 
Process Control Systems
Process control systems are commonly referred to as SCADA systems when talked about in
the context of security. Process control systems are designed to allow for automation in
industrial processes, such as controlling the ﬂow of a chemical into a processing plant.
Process control systems are used in automated manufacturing and reﬁnement production.
When cars are manufactured, process control systems measure the speeds at which parts of
the manufacturing process are occurring, and will adjust the rate of the conveyor belts and
the delivery of additional parts to match the current speed of assembly.
Process control systems consist of sensors that are used to detect changes in conditions,
controls which can respond to those changes in conditions, and a human interface that
allows operators to make manual changes.The sensors provide feedback to the control and
the control can reply with commands based on the feedback.A simple example is an air
compression system.A factory is using compressed air as part of its manufacturing process,
and the air should be at a constant pressure of 75 pounds per square inch (psi). When the
pressure drops below 75 psi, the sensor that is monitoring the pressure will report back to
the control.The control can then instruct an air compressor to activate, which builds the
pressure back up.This is an example of an on/off control.
Another example of a system using on/off controls is a heating system.The thermostat
that is monitoring the temperature reports back to the control, and if the temperature drops
below a certain degree, a command is sent to the heater to turn back on.This is a very
simple example, but it gets the point across. Figure 17.1 shows a simple process control
model for a heating system.

www.syngress.com

The process control model in Figure 17.1 includes a heater, a fuel line providing fuel to
the heater, a control, and a thermostat.The thermostat will provide the current state to the
control and the control will communicate with a valve on the fuel source that opens and
closes based on commands from the control. When the temperature drops, the valve opens,
allowing fuel to ﬂow to the heater, thus enabling the temperature to rise.
Proportional controls don’t just turn things on and off, but also adjust output when the
sensor is reaching an upper or lower bound. In the heater example, when a sensor detects
that the temperature is dropping, it provides feedback to the control which then directs the
fuel input valve to open a little. Rather than have only two states—on and off—there can be
slight corrective actions that force the dropping temperature to be corrected gradually.
The controls live within small microcomputers or embedded systems known as pro-
grammable logic controllers (PLCs).They are designed to be very durable and can survive in
extreme temperatures, in water, and in surroundings with a lot of electrical interference.The
controllers are programmed to respond to particular conditions reported via their sensors,
such as a temperature dropping below a certain degree.The PLC can then send out a
signal—either digital or analog—to activate a pump, open a valve, or close a switch. Digital
signals can support only two states—on and off—and are typically used to control valves.
Analog signals can support multiple states, similar to the temperature control on an oven—
the oven is either completely off, or it is anywhere between off and its maximum allowable
temperature.Analog signals are used to control adjustable switches.Think of the air pressure
example again.Assume that a particular processing component needs to have pressure
between 100 psi and 200 psi.The psi begins to drop toward 100 at a very slow rate.The
PLC receives notice from its sensor of the slow drop in pressure, and instead of signaling the
switch to open full blast, it signals it to open a percentage of full blast. In this way, you can
slowly correct a condition rather than brute force a very delicate process. Imagine if the
range had only a 1 psi to 2 psi difference; ﬁne-tuning would be required to keep the pres-
sure within that range.
Modbus
The communication between PLCs and the valves and switches that they control is typically
implemented using a protocol called Modbus. Modbus is a messaging structure invented by
Modicon in 1979. Its basic capabilities provide a client-server relationship using a very
simple and open standard. Modbus has been implemented for thousands of different devices
and can be considered the lingua franca for devices manufactured by different companies to
communicate. Basically, Modbus is designed to move raw bits or words over a network
regardless of the medium.This means that Modbus can operate over wireless serial or even
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks, which is the most
common application in more advanced implementations.
Modbus-compatible devices communicate with a master controller that sends commands
and receives data back from the end devices. Each device on the Modbus network has a
unique address and the controller will basically broadcast the command across the entire net-
www.syngress.com
506
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

work, but only the intended recipient will respond.The command can instruct the device to
take action, such as open or close, and can be used to request feedback.The technology is
very simple and is built for scalability and reliability. Security seems to have been an
afterthought, probably because in the past, the security of SCADA environments has always
been looked at from a physical perspective. Spooﬁng a Modbus command if connected to
the network would be trivial, especially on an Internet Protocol- (IP) enabled network. One
could deduce that if access to the network isn’t an issue, an attacker could spoof a trusted
source address and broadcast commands to the entire network; something will probably
answer. Requesting feedback would also be a good way to map a process control system net-
work: Send a broadcast requesting feedback and everything that answers is a Modbus-capable
device.At that point, start sending Modbus function commands,1 and see what types of
devices are out there.
Figure 17.2 shows a Modbus query in Ethereal, a packet capture and analysis tool avail-
able with most Linux distributions (see www.ethereal.com).
Figure 17.2 Modbus Query 
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
507

Figure 17.2 shows the Ethereal console displaying a packet capture from a Modbus net-
work.To explain what we are looking at, let’s talk about the image in three panels: top,
middle, and bottom.
The top pane shows packet headers, meaning it’s only showing basic information about
the communication, such as the source and destination IP addresses.The several headers that
are shown seem to be a series of queries and responses between 1.1.1.2 and 64.69.103.153.
The middle pane allows an analyst to drill down into certain layers of the packet, such as the
Ethernet layer or the IP layer, which is the ﬁrst expanded layer in the example.The second
expanded layer is the application protocol that is using TCP/IP, in this case Modbus. When
expanding the Modbus protocol we can see that this is a query from a controller to a
Modbus-capable device requesting that it read data from its registers.The logical response to
this request is to send the values that the registers returned.The bottom pane shows the
actual payload of the packet in which the hex value for the Read multiple registers command is
highlighted. It’s clear that the commands are in clear text and that there is no encryption or
authentication, so the viability of a packet such as this being created is not questionable.
Packet-spooﬁng programs and skilled hackers are able to construct packets that would look
just like this, and without any authentication, the remote system will believe that the packet
is coming from a trusted controller.
Programmable Logic Controllers
PLCs come in many shapes and sizes, depending on the application, but to give you a sense
of the form factor Figure 17.3 shows several PLCs manufactured by Direct LOGIC.
Figure 17.3 Programmable Logic Controllers 
www.syngress.com
508
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

If you look closely at Figure 17.3, you can see that most of the PLCs have both serial
and Ethernet adapters, indicated by the white circles.They are also commonly equipped
with modems for cases where communications are available only via telephony networks.
Electrical inputs allow the PLCs to communicate with the different systems that they con-
trol.The valves and switches are connected using electrical circuits, so there need to be mul-
tiple inputs on the PLC.
The theory of process control systems and the way in which they communicate is fairly
simple, but when applied to a massive processing application such as an oil reﬁnery, there are
hundreds of thousands of sensors, switches, controllers, and valves.The scale of the process
makes it complex, and thus, challenges arise.The oil and gas industry in particular uses
SCADA technology, which allows the monitoring and control of different aspects of the pro-
cessing facilities from a centralized location.
SCADA 
SCADA is a subset of process control systems used by the oil and gas industry. SCADA is an
industrial measurement and control system, much like process control, except that the pro-
cess control system is typically contained in one facility, such as a factory or a manufacturing
plant, whereas SCADA systems tend to be geographically dispersed. SCADA systems are
designed to enable the monitoring and control of processing systems that may be thousands
of miles away from the controller. SCADA systems are typically architected in a client-server
topology in which you have the controller, or the master terminal unit (MTU), connected
to hundreds or thousands of data-gathering or control units known as remote terminal units
(RTUs). SCADA systems are designed to be rugged and durable and can communicate over
long distances. Imagine an oil pipeline spanning hundreds or thousands of miles.The ﬂow of
oil needs to be monitored and controlled at these remote and often inaccessible locations or
substations.
SCADA is used to monitor and control processing equipment. Some of the controls are
initiated by operators who are monitoring huge process control dashboards and other com-
mands are automatically issued based on feedback to the controller received from the RTUs.
The RTUs are responsible for collecting or gathering data and sending it back to the
MTUs.The MTUs will process the data to look for alarm conditions; if the MTUs detect
such conditions, either they will automatically send the appropriate command back to the
RTU, or an operator will handle the situation manually.The data received from the RTUs is
typically displayed on a dashboard in a monitoring center for operators to respond to, if nec-
essary.The data may consist of ﬂow graphs, switches that have been turned on or off, or the
counters of a particular process.
Figure 17.4 shows a simpliﬁed example of a SCADA topology. It shows several compo-
nents that are part of almost any SCADA network.

Figure 17.4 Automated Reﬁnery Process and Control
Figure 17.4 shows us several things. First, the brain of the operation is the MTU, and
this is where an operator can connect to view the current status of the processing network.
We will look a little closer at an operator’s view a bit later.The next thing to note is the gray
box on the right, which represents a process control system network.This could be an oil
reﬁnery or an electrical processing plant. Within the processing network, there are sensors
connected to RTUs, responsible for controlling process equipment at remote sites and
acquiring data from the equipment to send back to the MTU.The network also consists of
ﬂow computers which have sensors that monitor the ﬂow of material through lines, be it
gas, oil, or electricity.All of these systems typically communicate back to the MTU using
Modbus over varying media. We can also see in Figure 17.4 that the medium used to
transmit data ranges from Frame Relay to satellite or wireless; even modems are used in
some instances where other means of communication are not available.
RTUs
Found in nearly all SCADA implementations, an RTU is a small computer that is designed
to withstand harsh environmental factors such as water, salt, humidity, temperature, dirt, and
dust. For example, RTUs should be able to operate at -10° C and up to 65° C.This is a
range of below freezing to 150° F.An RTU consists of a real-time clock, input/output inter-
faces, electrical spike protectors, a restart timer to ensure that the system restarts if it fails, and
a power supply with a battery backup in case power to the system is lost. It also includes
communications ports—either serial, Ethernet, or a modem—along with volatile and non-
volatile memory.The nonvolatile memory is used in case communications are severed; the
system will write its data to memory and then send it to the controller once communica-
tions have been reestablished.

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Figure 17.5 shows the inner workings of a typical RTU.All of these components are
generally contained within a very durable case that is designed to withstand the extreme
conditions mentioned earlier. Note that the RTU can also be connected directly to a PLC,
so based on the feedback and the data collected the PLC can make changes to process com-
ponents.
Figure 17.5 RTU
Figure 17.6 shows an RTU manufactured by Control Wave.This RTU has built-in
Ethernet and even a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. Built-in FTP? That should raise an
immediate red ﬂag. We all know how secure FTP is. It probably wouldn’t be to hard to plug
into this unit via the Ethernet port and compromise the FTP server. Just visit www.sans.org
and search for FTP vulnerabilities. FTP is probably one of the most insecure protocols out
there.And if you think that a hacker would have to get inside the case to access the Ethernet
port, guess what:An attacker would have all the time in the world to do this because these
systems are usually located in remote locations such as swamps and deserts. Once the attacker
is on the system, it’s likely that he could send falsiﬁed data back to the controller by snifﬁng
some sample trafﬁc and adjusting the values.This could cause all sorts of trouble at a pro-
cessing plant; indeed, the consequences could be catastrophic.

A skilled attacker could probably compromise one of these systems in a denial of service
(DoS) manner, or actually gain access to the system using a buffer overﬂow attack on the
FTP service. If he gained physical access to the system, he could connect a laptop via the
Ethernet port and examine trafﬁc to get an IP address. Once the attacker can communicate
with the system, he could conduct a port scan to see what services are running on the
system. If he saw FTP, a knowledgeable hacker would probably target that service for
exploitation. Depending on his goals, he could choose to either take the system ofﬂine with
a DoS attack, or if his intent was to gain access, he could use a buffer overﬂow type exploit,
gaining him console or command-line access to the system. It really depends on the version
and distribution of the FTP server that’s installed as to the extent of the capabilities and the
impact of an attack.
Figure 17.7 shows another RTU.Although this RTU doesn’t come with a hardened
case, you could purchase one for it to protect it from a sledgehammer for at least a minute.A
sledgehammer or other destructive tool would quickly and efﬁciently provide an attacker
physical access to the RTU and allow him to access communication ports.

Figure 17.7 Our Good Friend, TUX 
As you can see from the image of TUX, the penguin, in the lower right-hand side of the
image, the Linux operating system is running on this RTU.Are you wondering what the
patching process is on these systems? Automatic updates are probably not an option because
this RTU is running an open version of Linux, so it is vulnerable to every exploit to which
the particular version of Linux is vulnerable. If one of these were available, it would be inter-
esting to attach it to a network and scan it with Nmap, an open source network scanner
available from www.insecure.org, to see what’s running on it.There is even a phone number
for support right on the unit. Would they give out the default password? Social engineers
can be very convincing:“I’m out at pipeline 2234, it’s going to blow, and I have to get access
to the system! I need the admin password!” Numerous problems present themselves
regarding RTUs. We will address some of them in later sections of this chapter that look at
challenges, threats, and solutions.
Just as an example, in 2006, according to Internet Security Systems X-Force, an average
of around 600 vulnerabilities was released per month. Figure 17.8 shows the breakdown by
month.
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
513

Figure 17.8 Average Number of Vulnerabilities Released per Month in
2006 
Of course, not all of these vulnerabilities were directly related to the Linux operating
system, but ISS also reported that 1.2 percent was directly related to the Linux kernel. Out
of the 7,247 vulnerabilities, ISS reported that almost 100 directly related to the underlying
Linux kernel. It also noted that the top 10 vendors in terms of vulnerability count account
for only 14 percent of the more than 7,000 vulnerabilities reported.This means that 6,233
vulnerabilities are targeting other applications and systems.That’s an alarming number of vul-
nerabilities in the applications that are running on the operating systems where the vulnera-
bility is not directly associated with the operating system vendor. Especially in the Linux
world, where many of the applications are open source and not developed by a particular
vendor, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re vulnerable to without vulnerability assessment
practices. It’s scary to not think about patching these systems.
Flow Computers
Flow computers, as the name suggests, are used to measure ﬂows through lines.These could
be gas lines, oil lines, water lines, or electrical lines.A ﬂow computer’s sole purpose is to
report back to the MTU the current ﬂow rates for the line that it is monitoring.As you can
imagine, ﬂow rates should never drop to zero, and they should typically have an average
operating ﬂow that does not deviate much. Statistical data monitors such as the ones dis-
cussed in Chapter 13 can be used to alert on deviations from an average ﬂow if an
Enterprise Security Management (ESM) system were to collect this ﬂow information.
www.syngress.com
514
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Similar technology exists on the ﬂow computer to detect and report alarm condition based
on feedback from its sensors that sit on transport lines. Figure 17.9 shows what a ﬂow com-
puter looks like up close, and in the ﬁeld.
Figure 17.9 Flow Computer Up Close and in the Field 
As you can see in the image on the left, the ﬂow sensor has a tap into the medium
through which material is being transported. In this case, it’s an oil line.The most common
form of ﬂow monitoring is done using differential pressure calculations.The basic idea is that
a plate is inserted into the ﬂow and the pressure hitting the plate is measured.This provides
feedback regarding how much of the material is ﬂowing through the pipe at any given time.
The image on the right shows the type of remote environment in which something like this
may be deployed, and in the types of conditions these systems are expected to perform. It’s
no wonder that when they were building systems that can work in the snow, buffer over-
ﬂows were not a huge consideration. Now they need to be. Both RTUs and ﬂow sensors
report back to the MTU, the centralized command and control center.
MTUs and Operator Consoles
MTUs are the single point of human interaction for the entire operation. MTUs are used to
monitor and control the RTUs and sensors typically located at the operation’s central moni-
toring facilities with which they communicate, and to collect data from the RTUs and the
ﬂow computers.The MTU is also what feeds and responds to the operator’s console.The
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
515

console has two uses. First, it is the human interface to the SCADA systems. Operators can
manually respond to alarm conditions by issuing commands to open and close switches, and
turn equipment or control valves on and off.The console is used to issue the command at the
operator’s will, and the command is sent to the MTU.The MTU then sends the command to
the appropriate RTU from which the actual valve or switch is directed to open, close, or
adjust. (Actually, the command is broadcast across the entire network, and the RTU or PLC
with the right address will perform the action.) Again, we see a weakness of the protocols and
broadcasting commands, in that waiting for a response is neither secure nor efﬁcient.
Now let’s look at what an operator would actually see when he is sitting in front of his
terminal.The following images represent products from several different companies that pro-
duce MTUs and human machine interface applications. Figure 17.10 is from Iconics.The
view we see is an alarm window that alerts the operator to different conditions in a water
processing plant.
Figure 17.10 Iconics Alert Viewer 
Initially, the darker boxes in Figure 17.10 were red, signifying critical alarms.This view
allows the operator to see a near-real-time view of all alerts that have occurred in the past
several hours. Because this is a water processing plant, the alarm conditions relate to different
parts of the process which cleans the water. For example, we can see chemical readings for
alkaline levels. We can also see that some of the water levels in the tanks are too low. We also
see something called a “Warp core brench,” which doesn’t sound like a good thing. So, how
does an operator respond to these alarms? Well, the ones that are not automatically adjusted
using PLCs will need human interaction.This is where a human machine interface (HMI) is
www.syngress.com

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

needed, allowing an operator to select a portion of the process, such as a valve, and issue
commands to adjust it.
An HMI allows an operator to control particular parts of the process network from his
console. Rather than walk, drive, or ﬂy to the system, the operator can simply push a button
to correct alarm conditions. Figure 17.11 is also from Iconics; it shows the company’s HMI
interface to the water processing plant that is generating these alarms.
Figure 17.11 Iconics Plant Diagram and Control View 
In Figure 17.11, we can see a menu of commands to the right of what appears to be a
processing tank.This menu would appear after an operator has requested an action to be
performed. (Hopefully this is in response to the Warp core breach.)
Figure 17.12 shows what an operator sees when monitoring data received from ﬂow
computers. In this example, the ﬂow computers are monitoring the ﬂow of different chemi-
cals through a processing plant. If you remember the discussions on statistical monitoring, this
should ring a bell because the technology is very similar. Instead of monitoring for spikes and
drops of logical data, such as trafﬁc from an IP address, this application is monitoring for
spikes and drops in the amount of chemical that is ﬂowing through the processing lines.

Figure 17.12 Rate Monitoring 
In Figure 17.12, we see different shaded lines (originally in color) representing the
volume of chemical ﬂowing through a monitored line.There is one line for each chemical
being monitored. We can derive from the ﬁgure that at the third block from the right, there
is an extreme drop in the volume of a particular chemical ﬂowing through the system.This
type of view can be very useful for trending as well as for looking for anomalous patterns in
ﬂow which could indicate problems.
SCADA is deﬁnitely a requirement for the operator who is monitoring thousands of cir-
cuits or valves in a processing plant. It’s a very similar concept to the ESM systems of the
logical security world—taking in large amounts of data and presenting it in a way that allows
for human interpretation.
There is obviously no way an operator could actually look at all these alarms by going
to a console for each, just as a security analyst cannot use multiple consoles to look at intru-
sion detection or ﬁrewall data.Although correlation isn’t involved here, it does leave the
door open for integration with a correlation engine. If you could correlate failed logons to
an RTU and then a successful logon, you have probably been the victim of a brute force
attack.The power of correlation in the SCADA world is a new frontier, and we will examine

some bleeding-edge examples in the use-case section.The following quote by Howard
Schmidt in New Scientist magazine sums up SCADA and process control:“It used to be the
case that we’d open ﬂoodgates by turning a wheel; today it’s done through a keyboard, often
through a remote system.”
A SCADA example that must be included in any conversation worth having is a
SCADA implementation in a brewery.There is an interesting article in which a brewery in
the United Kingdom has implemented ﬁve SCADA systems to optimize processing and
allow for real-time decision making. It’s an example of SCADA technology leading to opera-
tional efﬁciencies in other areas besides oil and gas.The article, located at www.industrialnet-
working.co.uk/mag/v7-2/f_bottling_1.html, is worth a read.
Why Convergence?
Unfortunately, in the world we live in today, certain organizations and individuals would love
to terrorize a nation by disrupting the processing of some part of the nation’s critical infras-
tructure. Because of this, it is imperative that as a community, we investigate and respond to
the threats and challenges that exist. In this section, we will look at some of the myths sur-
rounding SCADA security as well as the stakeholders involved with trying to protect SCADA
and process control networks. In order to protect the critical infrastructure, there needs to be
collaboration across different organizations, from the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) to the industrial manufacturing industry, as well as technology vendors. SCADA tech-
nology developers and the people who use the equipment haven’t in the past seen much need
for security because their main focus is on reliability, and the capability for systems to be up
on a 24/7 basis. In a presentation by Dr. Paul Dorey, vice president and chief information
security ofﬁcer (CISO) at British Petroleum, given in 2006 at the Process Control Systems
Forum Conference, many of the common myths surrounding SCADA security were identi-
ﬁed.We list the myths here, and provide our own explanations to clarify them.
■
Myth 1: “Our process control systems are safe because they are all iso-
lated” According to surveys, 89 percent are connected. So what does this mean?
It means that almost all SCADA networks are in one way or another connected
back to a corporate network. It’s the old problem of security versus convenience,
or ease of getting a job done. If there was a ﬁle that an admin had to get into the
SCADA network or vice versa and every time they had to cross an air gap with a
CD or other type of media, their job would be very painful. Furthermore, if the
networks were air-gaped (in which there was absolutely no connection between
the two networks), operators would have to use their terminals only for moni-
toring the SCADA processes.They would have no Internet access, no e-mail, and
none of the other conveniences that we are all used to. Of course, at one point, it
was true that SCADA networks were isolated, but with modern connection
requirements, this is no longer the case.
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
519

■
Myth 2: “My networks aren’t connected; my server uses a separate net-
work to connect to the process control network and the corporate net-
work” This has to be one of the biggest violations imaginable.This means the
user has two interfaces in her computer: one on the corporate network, which is
where an infection, virus, or worm could easily come from; and the other on the
process control network, where the virus or worm will likely travel to once it
infects the host system.This also means that if the user’s computer is ever compro-
mised by a malicious insider or even an outsider, the attacker will have full-blown
access to the process control network.This should be a direct security violation.
■
Myth 3: “Antivirus can’t be applied” Many people believe that vendors will
not support installation of antivirus applications on a SCADA system.According to
the presentation, this is supported in more cases than expected.This is something
that we will address in the “Threats and Challenges” section of this chapter where
vendors stop supporting the software or platform if security measures are put into
place.Again, this is one of the reasons stakeholders from many different organiza-
tions need to get together and get these vendors to take the appropriate action and
support security.
■
Myth 4: “Our system isn’t vulnerable, as it uses proprietary protocols”
Proprietary protocols may be the case with SCADA-speciﬁc applications, but as
we discussed earlier, many systems are running on common operating systems such
as Windows and Linux, and services such as FTP are installed. Just because the
protocol used for the SCADA application is probably fairly unknown doesn’t mean
that the operating system and all vulnerabilities associated with it are not. Myth #3
mentions that antivirus software can’t be installed, which probably means that not
much is done as far as disabling unnecessary services or doing any hardening pro-
cedures to these systems.
■
Myth 5: “I have a ﬁrewall, so I’m safe” See Myth #2; this completely
bypasses the ﬁrewall. Furthermore, ﬁrewalls can’t stop users from plugging laptops
directly into process control networks, and ﬁrewall rules tend to be modiﬁed for
convenience. If an admin needs to connect to a system and he is also in charge of
the ﬁrewall, good money says there will be a ﬁrewall rule allowing him access.This
is an example of the failure of separation of duties.The admin for the ﬁrewall or
the person responsible for securing the environment should never be the same
group or person that has to work with the systems.
It’s amazing to look at some of the thought processes that are going on in the industry.
The different schools of thinking are very apparent. If you’re coming from the world of the
process control engineer, it’s not likely that you have ever even touched a ﬁrewall or that you
understand much about IP and logical security. If you are coming from the logical security
side of things, SCADA, process control systems, process control networks, PLC, and the other
technologies mentioned probably seem foreign to you, and the catastrophes that could incur

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

if these systems were to fail may seem far-fetched. Someone who has worked with process
control systems their whole career understands the implications of system failure, which leads
to the school of thinking that states that if a vendor says it doesn’t support the system and
doesn’t know the results of applying a security update, hesitation to install an update is
understandable. So how can these issues be addressed to provide security while not breaking
applications that critical processes depend on? How can there be a common ground between
vendors and the oil and gas industry? The only way is with participation from many different
organizations.
To bridge the gap between vendors and industry, there must be a collaboration that
involves players from different backgrounds, with different skill sets and different schools of
thought.The owners of the different industry sectors need to work together to demand from
process control vendors that security be taken seriously.This includes the chemical industry,
the oil and gas industry, nuclear power, water, and electric. Next, the major SCADA and pro-
cess control vendors need to get together and work with the industry sectors to deliver
secure products.These vendors would include Honeywell, Siemens, Rockwell, Invensys, and
Emerson, which are some of the major players in the process control system ﬁeld.There also
needs to be support from academia. Several key organizations would include the
International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), the Institute for Information
Infrastructure Protection (I3P), and the American Automatic Control Council (A2C2).The
academics represent the scientists and engineers who are developing the leading-edge tech-
nologies for the future of process control. If they are involved and are aware of the concerns,
they will take these concerns into consideration when they are inventing and designing new
products, and security will not be an afterthought.
Figure 17.13 shows a mockup of a diagram used in a presentation given at a Process
Control Systems Forum Conference in 2006 by Michael Torppey, who is a technical man-
ager at PCSF and a senior principal at Mitretek Systems.The ﬁgure displays the different
cross-sector groups involved, as well as the private security industry.
In Figure 17.13, the link graph starts in the center with the stakeholders in an effort to
protect critical infrastructure. Surrounding the center are the different sectors, such as
Academia and the Department of Homeland Security. Within each sector, the individual
groups or organizations that play a critical role are identiﬁed. National labs such as Sandia
and Lawrence Livermore are also involved in the overall cross-sector collaboration.The labs’
inﬂuence provides expert advice and direction to the overall strategy of the effort. Sandia
Labs, in fact, was deeply involved in a project sponsored by DHS where industry and secu-
rity vendors were brought together to try to detect a series of potential attacks. DHS is, of
course, involved in many aspects of the collaboration, from project sponsorship and security
expertise to the oil and gas industry, to pushing the issues up the political ladder toward pres-
idential sponsorship.The standards committees are very important as well, because the
research done will become best practices which then are implemented as standards where
they are accessible for others to follow as guidelines.

Figure 17.13 Stakeholders Involved in Protecting Critical Infrastructure 
The only sector that was left out in the original diagram and that should be included is
the one comprising logical security vendors, the same vendors that have become leaders and
experts in protecting logical IP-based infrastructures.These companies and individuals are
key in bridging the gap. It would be a reinvention of the wheel if process control system
owners didn’t follow some of the same best practices that are used to secure ﬁnancial records
at a bank or classiﬁed information within government.The advances made over the past sev-
eral years in the areas of perimeter protection have been working fairly well. It’s been several
years since the last virus or worm has caused any real damage, and you hear far less about
Web sites being hacked into.Technology has gotten better and awareness has been raised.
With that in mind, it’s time to look at some of the speciﬁc threats and challenges facing
organizations as we move to a converged secure SCADA world.

Threats and Challenges
This section begins with a quote from a popular process control system vendor.The quote
sets the stage, as well as provides insight as to how bad the problems are that need to be
addressed in today’s process control environments:
Security has become an increasingly critical factor and will continue
to be essential to public utility agencies. Wonderware offers robust
data-level security, in addition to the standard security features pro-
vided by the Microsoft Windows operating system, to protect your
control system from cyber or physical risks.”—http://content.wonder-
ware.com/NR/rdonlyres/83A979AD-A805-41A3-BC4F-
D021C692F6D1/591/scada_water_4pg_rev5_ﬁnal.pdf
This is just the tip of the iceberg.The standard security features offered by Windows?
You’ve got to be kidding, right? It’s not a joke.This is the level of security awareness that
you will ﬁnd when talking to some of the process control system vendors. In this section, we
will look at some of the speciﬁc threats and challenges facing process control and, speciﬁ-
cally, the oil and gas industry. We will also hear from two industry experts who have or still
do work in a SCADA process control environment.
Interconnectivity
One of the ﬁrst challenges or issues is the interconnectivity of process control networks and
corporate networks.As we learned earlier in the chapter, some 89 percent of process control
networks are actually connected to corporate networks. In the past, SCADA networks were
not physically connected to corporate networks. Reﬁneries used to have completely
autonomous or self-sufﬁcient networks. Previously, there wasn’t a need to connect into
reﬁneries from remote locations; they didn’t need Internet access or e-mail. Nowadays,
reﬁneries, factories, and manufacturing plants are interconnected.This means there is an
Internet connection, and a connection to headquarters for remote access. Now think of all
the connections back at corporate: business partners, virtual private networks (VPNs), and
wireless.All of these create a window through which an attacker can penetrate. Once on the
corporate network, the attacker is only one attack away from full access to the process con-
trol network.
Another signiﬁcant challenge that creates many weaknesses is that the industry is stan-
dardizing on common operating systems and protocols.The systems and hardware being
developed and manufactured today are designed to run on Windows and Linux.These sys-
tems are also using TCP/IP as a means of communication.This is a double-edged sword.
There is a deﬁnite upside because at least the vulnerabilities and weaknesses are somewhat
known and can be ﬁxed, but known vulnerabilities also represent the downside. If the vul-
nerabilities are known to security professionals, you can be sure they are also known to the
bad guys. With common operating systems come common problems, such as shipping with

523

default services enabled. In most cases, vulnerabilities are associated with these services and
they need to be disabled, but without a hardening policy in place, it’s likely that they are not.
It’s been said that some vendors don’t support the patching or upgrading of systems. It’s
not uncommon to go into a process control environment and ﬁnd that most systems are still
running Windows NT SP 4. Not only do the vendors not want the systems patched, but
also management doesn’t want downtime, particularly when dealing with these critical sys-
tems, because downtime costs money. In most IT organizations, there is redundancy or
blackout periods where patches can be applied and systems can be rebooted, but in pro-
cessing and reﬁnement, every minute a system is down means less product, which means less
revenue. If the systems are not able to be patched or updated, the process control systems are
going to remain vulnerable to attacks that already exist and are easily obtainable by even the
most unsophisticated attackers.The use of host-based ﬁrewalls and host-based intrusion
detection/prevention software is a good idea, although if patches and updates are not sup-
ported, ﬁrewalls and HIDS are for sure not allowed.
Can you determine system security if you can’t test the system? This is another problem
in the SCADA world. Vulnerability scanning tools such as Tenable Network Security’s Nessus
will cause SCADA applications and older operating systems to freeze or crash completely.
Scanning tools commonly work by sending combinations of IP packets to a network port in
hopes of soliciting a response. Sometimes these packets are out of band (OOB), meaning that
they don’t adhere to the speciﬁcations for IP.The reason for this is to illicit a speciﬁc
response and map that to a known response from either the operating system in general
(known as OS ﬁngerprinting) or from a service that’s listening on the network.This type of
scanning has been known to break SCADA systems. If the developer built the network
daemon to speak IP, based on the standard and didn’t take into account error conditions or
bad packets, the application would receive an unintended response when trying to process
these malformed packets. Commonly this leads to the application simply crashing or needing
to be restarted. If you can’t perform regular vulnerability scans in an environment such as
this, how can a security posture be evaluated? The application and hardware vendors need to
understand that vulnerability scanning is a critical component in securing these systems.
Tenable Network Security has begun to address this problem by working with standards
companies, such as OPC and Modicon, to develop a series of checks or plug-ins that will
check for SCADA security issues speciﬁcally, without disabling or breaking the application.
This shows the type of collaboration that is needed in the industry to move forward and
protect the critical infrastructure.The checks include default usernames and passwords, inse-
cure versions of protocols, problems related to Modbus, and checks to determine the applica-
tions that are running on the systems.These checks have been speciﬁcally designed to not
break the SCADA applications, but they don’t take into account the inability to scan for
normal operating system vulnerabilities. Most scanners have settings for performing safe
checks, but it seems that even safe checks may harm SCADA applications and take down a
system. Figure 17.14 shows the SCADA plug-in selection in Nessus.
www.syngress.com
524
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Figure 17.14 Nessus 3 Console with SCADA Plug-ins 
From this screen, the user can select the plug-ins that are part of a particular scan or
scanning policy, and then save his selection for future scans.The idea would be to have dif-
ferent policies based on the systems being scanned.This is a great start and is a good indica-
tion of the direction security vendors are taking. It really shows that people are concerned
and are willing to help by adapting their products to look for problems speciﬁc to SCADA
environments.
SCADA vulnerabilities are no longer a secret; there is growing interest among the
hacker community.At Black Hat Federal, a hacking/security conference sponsored by the
Black Hat organization, there were talks about how to break into SCADA systems.Also, at
Toorcon, there was a presentation which included instructions for how to attack some of the
commonly used protocols in SCADA or process control network environments such as
Modbus. So, now we have not only the fact that the systems are vulnerable, but also how to
exploit the protocols that used to make the industry feel secure because the protocols were
fairly unknown. Security through obscurity is no longer an option for the process control
industry.
As systems increasingly become interconnected and more security devices are put into
place, we see the common problem of digital overload—increasing the amount of data to
process and ﬂoods of event logs. If no one is looking at the logs, they are basically useless.
Data growth is becoming overwhelming for teams that have little to no security data analysis

experience.Again, this is where the logical security community needs to step up and help.
Products such as ESM can process large amounts of data and will help in the analysis process,
but the industry needs to invest in its security infrastructure and hire some security experts
to help with the process. It will not be a cheap retroﬁt, but it is necessary and the costs of
not doing it far outweigh the costs of making the commitment.
Another important challenge is the migration to the “wireless plant.” Lately, everyone
seems to be moving to wireless. Now, this is a great efﬁciency enhancer, just as it is in a cor-
porate environment, but it brings with it the same problems. It is extremely easy to crack the
security that’s been applied to wireless networks.The Wired Equivlancy Privacy (WEP) is
not unbreakable. Downloadable tools are available that will collect a series of wireless com-
munications and crack the key, allowing an attacker full access to the network. Nonetheless,
many vendors these days are pushing reﬁneries and manufacturing plants toward wireless.
Figure 17.15 is an example of an advertisement for just that.
Figure 17.15 Wireless for everyone! (Source: Emerson Process
Management)
This is scary; just think about war drivers, people who drive around trying to connect to
open or weakly secured wireless networks.This would probably represent the mother load
for them.They could pull up with a high-gain antenna and see all kinds of radio frequencies
ﬂoating around one of these environments. Unfortunately, they don’t just want to look; they
want access.Therefore, serious attention needs to be paid to securing these wireless net-
works.They need to be encrypted. Hopefully they employ Media Access Control (MAC)
address ﬁltering and don’t use the Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP). If this
isn’t the case, though, the ability to access these wireless systems would be trivial.Again, if
you can access the network, it’s fairly easy to start snifﬁng trafﬁc and see the type of com-
mands or trafﬁc ﬂoating around.This would allow an attacker to spoof sources and send fal-

siﬁed commands and data back to the MTU, wreaking havoc on the organization.The other
consideration with wireless hackers is that they are not always trying to destroy systems, but
if they do get onto a SCADA network and don’t know what they are doing and start scan-
ning, even if not with malicious intentions, they could cause severe damage unsuspectingly.
We have looked at some of the challenges and threats out there. In the next section, we
will hear from an industry expert who will explain to us through an interview his experi-
ences when dealing with the protection of SCADA systems.
Interview: SCADA Penetration Testing
The following interview was conducted January 2007 with Gabriel Martinez, CISSP.
Martinez is a security expert with more than 12 years in the industry providing security
consulting services to nearly every vertical, including government, the Department of
Defense (DoD), intelligence, healthcare, and ﬁnancial. In addition, he has experience with
the power and utilities industry. He has also spoken at several conferences on the topic,
including the American Gas Association. He brings numerous real-world examples that tie in
with what we have been discussing thus far.
Colby: Can you tell me a little about your background as it relates to SCADA?
Gabriel: I have performed many security risk assessments for companies in the power and
energy space. We would break up the assessment in several phases. First, we begin the
assessment with a penetration test focused on externally exposed systems, simulating an
Internet-based attack.The second phase would focus on testing from within the organi-
zation. We would test the access gained from two perspectives: someone just plugging in
a laptop, and from a legitimate user.This really gave us the insider threat perspective.And
ﬁnally, we would review any security policies and technical security controls in place.
In general terms, the external systems tended to be relatively secure, but on the inside it
was very much a different story. We used to describe it as a hard-shell candy; hard and
crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.
Colby:Tell me more about the external vulnerabilities. Do you think it’s possible to get in
from outside?
Gabriel:There tends to be a much smaller footprint and limited exposure.About four or ﬁve
years ago, though, you would ﬁnd exposed Web servers and other DMZ systems that
were accessible from the Internet, almost guaranteeing an entryway through a trusted
access control list (ACL).These days, through awareness and better practices, these have
been locked down. However, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploits to match,
there is always a risk.
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
527

Colby: What are some common misconceptions surrounding process control network secu-
rity?
Gabriel: Everyone tends to believe the systems are not connected to corporate networks.
This used to be one of the main ﬁndings that upper management was always surprised
to hear about.The systems really are interconnected.There might be a ﬁrewall, but they
usually had open ACLs and allowed connectivity from numerous different subnets.
To give you an example, once I discovered that a group of workstations from the corpo-
rate network were dual-homed (they had more than one network interface). One side
had an IP connection to the corporate network and a controller card for an energy
management system, which used a proprietary technology. I scanned the workstations
and found that they were all running Carbon Copy, a remote control product, so I
downloaded a copy and found they were using the default password. Now that I was on
these workstations, I had full access to the energy management system.These worksta-
tions were conﬁgured that way so that operators could access them remotely via their
corporate VPN so that they could manage/monitor their SCADA environment from
their desktops.
Colby: Didn’t all the scanning and pen testing activity get picked up by the security team?
Gabriel: I’m glad you asked that.The test was designed so that only upper management
knew that a penetration test was being conducted. I’d say 80 percent of the time, our
pen tests were never discovered by the security team or IT staff. .
Colby: Weren’t they using intrusion detection systems?
Gabriel: Some were, some weren’t, but even the ones that were weren’t even monitoring the
logs. Really, they needed an ESM platform. What good is a ﬁrewall/intrusion detection
system if you don’t monitor it?
Colby: I agree.They generate tremendous numbers of logs, and humans cannot interpret the
mass amounts of data that are generated.That’s a great example of what we have been
talking about so far. Let’s move on to another common myth.
Gabriel:Another myth is security through obscurity.The misconception is that people don’t
have the knowledge to control a SCADA network.A person once told me there was no
way someone would know how to take over his system. I countered by simply asking
him, if he were in a ﬁnancial predicament and were offered a large sum of cash or were
being blackmailed by a foreign government, could he provide the necessary details or
could he shut down the SCADA network? Much knowledge is now accessible via the
Internet, including vendor documentation. Vendors even announce who their biggest
customers are, so a targeted attack could be made easier.

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Colby:The latest trends show SCADA components moving to common operating systems
such as Windows and Linux. Can you tell me about the path and update processes you
have seen?
Gabriel:As SCADA systems move to common operating systems such as UNIX and
Windows, they are subject to the same patch management and security issues that any
other organization faces when securing a critical system or network. Systems need to be
patched and locked down and protected via better access controls. Most systems I
looked at were typically not up-to-date and had numerous vulnerabilities as well as
unnecessary services running.
Colby: Did you ﬁnd problems between vendor support and patch-level and security hard-
ening?
Gabriel: One of the industry issues is that if you did secure or harden the system by shutting
down insecure services and/or applying patches, the vendors wouldn’t support it.Today
awareness is changing and industry collaboration is beginning to get the message across
to vendors that security is a necessity.
Colby: During your penetration tests and scanning, did many systems crash?
Gabriel: We didn’t do much actual scanning of SCADA systems. We started with the corpo-
rate networks, and once SCADA networks were ascertained, we evaluated the systems
manually—looking at ﬁrewall policies, both inbound and outbound, of the process con-
trol networks. We would log on to servers and look at the services running and compare
the versions to a known vulnerability database we used. If anything, we conducted some
simple tests, but because SCADA applications were sensitive to particular communica-
tions such as bad packets and out-of-band trafﬁc that’s used by scanning products to ﬁnd
vulnerabilities and identify operating systems, we tended to not use these tools.
Colby: What scanning tools did you use?
Gabriel: We used a combination of homegrown tools, and publicly available tools such as
Nessus, using custom plug-ins that we built.
Colby: Have you heard that Nessus now has SCADA plug-ins?
Gabriel:Yes, that’s pretty forward-thinking. It shows movement in the right direction because
it’s being recognized as a problem. I wish I had them available when I was doing these
tests.
Colby: Did you ever run into any geographical or physical concerns?
Gabriel: Sometimes there were terminals in remote locations, like computers connected in at
a remote substation.The only thing protecting it was a fence and a door, but they were
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
529

usually in such remote locations that nobody would notice someone climbing over or
cutting through the fence. One time we went to one of these locations and went inside
with a key and found the system was still logged in.
Colby:That’s pretty scary. I’ll bet they weren’t pleased about that. Do you have any other
security concerns surrounding remote sites?
Gabriel: Communications to remote systems. RTUs generally use satellite, x.25, or Frame
Relay protocols, but as backups they had modems for fail-safe operation with poorly
conﬁgured passwords or default passwords.You would be presented a prompt to issue
commands or make conﬁguration changes.Also, these remote systems as of late are con-
nected via IP networks, making them vulnerable to standard IP-based attacks like man
in the middle attacks, spooﬁng, or denial of service attacks.
Colby: What were some of the top vulnerabilities you would ﬁnd?
Gabriel: I’d say they are common across any industry: weak authentication (i.e.,
common/default passwords); weak access controls; insecure trusts like rshell and the r
command suite, including rlogin, where trust was based on the initiator’s IP address; and
nonpatched vulnerable systems.
We found that if you gained access to just one vulnerable system, you would gain access
to just about every other system in minutes.
Colby: What about vendor access and business-to-business relationships?
Gabriel: Vendors would have dial-up access into the systems for support and would dial
directly into SCADA systems with weak or default passwords. Plus, you’re trusting the
vendor’s employee, who now has full access to the systems.Theoretically, you could go
in as the vendor or break into a vendor and then use their systems to gain access. Plus,
there are all the normal concerns surrounding trusting other entities to access your net-
work in business-to-business relationships.
We never conducted a test using that angle, but given the proper motivation and
funding, anything is possible.
Colby: What about wireless?
Gabriel: It’s getting better, but it’s still a concern, just as wireless is a concern in corporate
environments.There are tools that crack WEP keys, allowing users onto the network.
And once they are on, everything is accessible.The wireless networks should be locked
down, maybe use VPN technology, or at least MAC ﬁltering, but MACs can be spoofed,
so this is only a thin layer of protection.

Colby:There seem to be numerous problems and insecurities surrounding SCADA and pro-
cess control networks. In your opinion, what can be done?
Gabriel: Considering the consequences of a successful attack, this is a very important aspect.
Security best practices need to be implemented.The industry needs to heed the warn-
ings and look at how security has been achieved in other verticals, such as ﬁnancial
organizations and the DoD. Secure architectures need to be implemented, policies and
procedures need to be in place; it’s not much different from securing any other critical
environment.There need to be strong access controls, and regular vulnerability assess-
ments need to be performed because the environments are always changing. Intrusion
detection systems and other point security products such as host-based intrusion detec-
tion and ﬁrewalls must be not only deployed, but also the logs need to be collected and
monitored. Just having the logs doesn’t help. Correlation and analytic processing are
required to ﬁnd relationships between disparate events. I suggest using an SIEM product;
unwatched alerts are meaningless.
Colby:You were directly involved with a cross-sector collaboration project involving the oil
and gas industry. Can you tell me a little about it?
Gabriel: I was brought in from an ESM perspective to see how ESM can improve the gen-
eral security of SCADA environments.The project coordinators came up with a test
environment that included a simulated process control network connected to a repro-
duced corporate network. We were in a lab environment that simulated an oil reﬁne-
ment network.The simulation included a corporate network, a process control network,
and a distribution control network. I developed the logic to monitor and detect what-
ever attack scenarios they came up with.
Colby: Can you tell me a little about the attack scenarios?
Gabriel: Without going into too much detail, I can say that there were four or ﬁve scenarios.
Each consisted of an attacker who gained access to the process control network by
attacking systems that were either directly connected or trusted to connect to the net-
work. Some of the attacks started in the corporate network. One started at a remote
substation and the other was over wireless. We looked at data feeds from several different
SCADA products, including Telvent and Omniﬂow, as well as events from several other
security products.
Colby:Thanks for your time. Everything you have said is really enlightening and right in line
with the current industry trends. Do you have any plans to do more work in the
SCADA arena?
Gabriel:The pleasure is all mine, anything to do to help. I’m sure this won’t be the last
chance I get to use what I know about SCADA, especially with the problems that are
being identiﬁed in the industry.Thank you.

It’s amazing how the interview lined up with the items discussed in this chapter.
Martinez’s input really shows that the myths we discussed earlier, and some of the threats and
challenges, are not just scare tactics; they really do exist, and the industry really does need to
come together and improve the security posture of process control environments.
The project Martinez was involved with is Project LOGIIC, which stands for Linking
the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cyber Security.The project was funded by DHS and
led by Sandia National Laboratories. Other participants in the project included Chevron,
Citgo, BP, Ergon, and SRI International, to name a few.The goal of the project was to iden-
tify new types of security sensors for process control networks.The integrated solution lever-
aged ArcSight’s ESM technology and represented the ﬁrst test of this type to deliver an
expertly developed, fully tested solution that enabled centralization of security information,
monitoring vulnerable points of entry within oil and gas IT and process control networks.
The LOGIIC consortium is a model example of a partnership between government and
industry that is committed to combining resources to deﬁne and advance the security of the
oil and gas industry. More information is available from Sandia
(www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/logiic-project.html) and DHS
(www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/logic.html).
Interview: Process Control System Security
The following interview was conducted with Dr. Ben Cook from Sandia National
Laboratories. Cook is a member of the research team at Sandia and has a doctorate in sci-
ence and IT. His background is in modeling and simulation in complex systems: physical and
engineering systems. Cook does a lot of computational work and for the past ﬁve years or so
at Sandia, he’s been involved in helping to start and manage several infrastructure protection,
research, and development projects. Project LOGIIC is one of those. He also is looking very
holistically at infrastructures such as the power grid and trying to understand their vulnera-
bilities as well as how Sandia can work with industry to secure those infrastructures in an
economical fashion.
Colby:Thank you for spending time to talk with me. I appreciate it.You have told me a little
about your background, dealing with complex systems. What do you mean by complex
system? Do you mean process control systems? 
Ben: I’m looking at systems like the power grid. Control systems would be a piece of that—
basically, how would you model the power grid on a regional scale.A piece of the
power grid is the information infrastructure, the control systems.Another piece of the
power grid is the actual physical infrastructure in the way of transmission lines and trans-
formers and generators, and yet another piece of the power grid is the markets through
which the power is sold. My technical background is modeling physical systems—large
physical systems where you have lots of different things going on in the way of physics,
in terms of ﬂuid dynamics and solid mechanics.The goal was to think about how you
would model these coupled systems: how you would idealize them, abstract them,

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

develop the mathematical models, and solve those mathematical models using computers
and then visualize the results.
Colby: Sounds like fun.
Ben: Sandia has had large programs for the past decade or so looking at infrastructure and
their dependencies, trying to understand linkages between infrastructures: how does the
power grid rely on the oil and gas infrastructure, and if you look at an actual gas
pipeline, how does it depend on the power grid?  
If the power grid goes down, how does that outage in the power grid ripple out and
bring about consequences in other infrastructures? You have clearly intertwined with all
physical infrastructures, like the power grid and the oil and gas pipelines and reﬁneries.
You have telecommunications infrastructure; companies are increasingly dependent upon
the telecommunications infrastructure. We’ve done a lot of work at Sandia in taking a
look at a very large scale. It’s the backbone of our infrastructure systems that support the
economy and support our way of life. How could that backbone be compromised, and
equally important, how would you protect that backbone? How might you reengineer
the infrastructure? That can be done through policy.You know, maybe there are ways of
introducing, just like we did on LOGIIC, new sensors that would allow utilities to have
a broader, more global view of their system health and to be able to anticipate failures,
and then take measures to try to stabilize those systems.
We spend a lot of time here at Sandia working on those kind of issues, and I’ve been
involved in that work here for over ﬁve years now. Project LOGIIC is just one example
on the cyber security side.
Colby: Is there a red team/blue team model like the Marines or the DoD uses, in which one
team attacks systems and the other tries to detect the attacks?
Ben:Yes, it’s similar. If you look at the threat through your own rose-colored glasses, it’s likely
to be a very biased view.You really have to try to get into the mind of an adversary, so
part of this is trying to think about who your adversaries might be. How do they look at
the world? What are they trying to accomplish? What resources do they have available?
How sophisticated are they? What are their technical capabilities?  
Colby: Besides the obvious—terrorist organizations—who else do you consider to be adver-
saries that would actually try to compromise a process control system or part of the
infrastructure? I hope that just the hacker that’s going to break into Web sites for fun
wouldn’t consider breaking into an oil reﬁnery just because potential loss of human life
is far different from taking down a Web site.
Ben: Certainly that’s a concern because there is some exposure and some risk of collateral
damage if the hacker just happens to come about a company that has an open door to
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
533

its control systems, and this hacker ﬁnds himself somehow having successfully exploited
one of those control system components.
Colby: Let’s talk a little about some of the differences in these systems compared to systems
in a typical IT infrastructure.
Ben: Control systems are a little different from IT systems in that in an IT system, your con-
cern is trying to protect the data. Some of the tenets of security from an IT perspective
are availability, conﬁdentiality, and integrity; usually availability is something that you can
sacriﬁce. If my workstation goes down for the next hour, I will lose some productivity,
but there are other things that I could do.
If I’m losing data on my workstation, or if somebody steals that data, that’s a serious
issue. In the case of control systems, availability is paramount, so if the control systems
are there to control and to manage the operations, it’s the continuity of the operations
that the industry really cares about.They care about what you care about as a consumer
of electric power or gasoline.You want to make sure gas is available at the pump; that
when you ﬂick on a light switch in your house the lights go on. Control systems really
are a different beast in that availability has to be preserved, almost at all costs.
It is really that coupling, then, between the control systems, the information systems, the
hardware and the software that make up the control systems, and the physical process—
understanding that coupling and understanding how a control system compromise might
in turn impact the operation, the reﬁnery, and the pumping of oil. Fortunately, the
industry has been pretty good in terms of thinking through these things, because maybe
in the past they haven’t had to worry so much about someone attacking them through a
cyber means, but they have had to worry about other types of problems that may impact
operations, such as losing power, in which case they would like the reﬁnery to continue
to operate.
They’ve thought through some of these infrastructure dependencies and interdependen-
cies that we were talking about earlier, and from a business continuity standpoint they’ve
tried to mitigate the potential impacts of an errant control system component or a signal
instruction, or the loss of power.
Colby: Is this done with a lot of redundancy built in?
Ben:There’s redundancy, but there’s also fail-safe safety systems; sometimes they are mechan-
ical and sometimes they’re electromechanical, but there’s an extra layer of protection.
Colby:That’s comforting to know.
Ben: In the past, these guys could always revert, if necessary, to mechanical, hands-on opera-
tions of the processes.

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

Colby: Closing valves manually?  
Ben:Yes, but that becomes harder with the trend toward full automation.Then there is the
question of whether you have the manpower to do that, as you make your transition
from no automation to partial automation to full automation. I spent a lot of time with
folks in the oil and gas industry and other related infrastructure sectors the past couple
of years, and I’ve been very impressed with the amount of effort they put into trying to
make sure their operations run smoothly and reliably. It’s really their bottom line.
Colby: If a system goes down, production goes down, and proﬁts go down.
Ben:That’s one of the ways a lot of folks are thinking about how you make the business case
for investment in security.At the end of the day, from the CIO or CSO perspective, if
they can make that connection between availability, or continuity of operations, and
security, it’s a very powerful connection and it’s good justiﬁcation for making an invest-
ment in security.
Colby: Security is one of those hard things to prove because showing that nothing has hap-
pened is when you’re really showing that you have a good security practice in place.
Ben: Naturally, so having a proven understanding of the state of health of your operation is
something that can be valuable for not only trying to understand whether you’re poten-
tially being exploited, but also whether something’s going wrong and isn’t functioning
correctly. Maybe it’s not functioning correctly because of human error, or maybe it’s not
functioning correctly because it’s just not fully optimized and you have some opportuni-
ties to squeeze more out of your business through additional optimization, or maybe
something’s not functioning correctly because a component is starting to fail.
Colby: Maybe an old piece of equipment is just starting to fail on its own… 
Ben: …yes, something like leaks in the pipeline.The leak protection is big business.A
broader view, a deeper view into your business, and a more intelligent view—this is the
power of ArcSight. It provides not only the broad view, but also the deep view. On the
process side, you can do things like monitor your process control networks. Sometimes
they’re using specialized protocols, which run on top of TCP/IP.
Colby:That’s really neat. Completely new event sources are always interesting. It’s a great
time to derive new use cases because you can look at the new data that you’re receiving
and how it can correlate with other events that are coming into the systems. What were
other things you looked at in LOGIIC?
Ben: Exposures, the vector through which an adversary can attack; they’re going to work
their way to the control systems through the business network. Plus, the technologies
that are now increasingly being used and deployed on our control systems are the same
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
535

technologies that they’re familiar with and that they probably have exploits for, and they
have the same set of vulnerabilities.
Colby: Good point. I’ve also heard that some of the data vendors actually don’t want people
upgrading the operating systems, so they’re running on older versions like Windows NT.
Ben:Yes, and this gets back to the issue that we talked about earlier, about the control sys-
tems being a different beast to manage from a securities standpoint. We talked about
availability being paramount. If availability is your utmost concern, understandably
there’s going to be a reluctance to patch.
Colby:This seems like a place where collaboration across the industry really needs to come
from both the product vendor side, and the customers in terms of trusting that the ven-
dors are supporting these things.
Ben: I think there’s been good dialogue there. On the vendor side, there’s increased under-
standing on the importance of security, so they are trying to work more closely with
their customers to more quickly upgrade the systems that are out there, the legacy sys-
tems, but they’re also trying to incorporate security features into their new product lines.
Colby:Awareness is key.
Ben:Yes, it is. Now you have asset owners who are saying they want to know what you’re
doing about security.They want to understand what your typical response time is to
patches and how closely you work with Microsoft, how quickly you can patch, how you
are addressing this type of vulnerability and what implementation of Modbus you are
using, and whether you have looked at these types of issues with that protocol. In
response, vendors are starting to take action to address the legacy issues, as well as embed
security into their new products.That’s encouraging.
Colby: Now scanning, that’s another big problem, right?  
Ben:Yes, scanning is a problem.Again, inadvertently, because they don’t have this under-
standing of the importance of availability on the control system side and there hasn’t
been a dialogue, the IT guy tries to scan something on the control system network side.
Colby: I think also that if you look at the security that’s happened as far as a lot of the IT
technology companies, and online businesses, you don’t hear so much about them get-
ting broken into anymore, so I think security practices have improved across the board.
And I think that if they take the best practices from these companies that already have
online entities like banks and other organizations, they will be ahead of the game.
Ben:Absolutely—looking at the best practices and just applying them into the process con-
trol environment. In the past, people have said they can’t use a particular antivirus
product on PCs because the workload associated with the process of operation is sufﬁ-

ciently high that if their box gets any further bogged down running it, it’s just not going
to perform well, and it might actually hiccup and bring the process down. People are
starting to look at that and say that maybe in some cases they actually can run that soft-
ware. Certainly, bringing together the IT guys on the business side with the control
system guys and the physical security guys—bringing those folks together and getting
them to talk and to understand that they do have shared responsibilities and that they
can work together—they’re going to be much more effective.
Colby: It’s really the converged approach; convergence is just necessary.
Ben:Yes, but thinking of it in broader terms, convergence of the security infrastructure—it’s
the technologies in the organizations, and the resources.
Colby:At the end of the day, if the power goes down, eBay is not going to be running its
Web site, so it should be willing to share its knowledge and experiences. It depends on
the critical infrastructure, just like anyone else.
Ben:And you certainly see that in LOGIIC.You saw that with the commitment of the asset
owners to open up and to share their understanding of the issues and to provide guid-
ance to the team toward the development of a solution that would be useful not only to
them, but (in their minds at least) also to the broader industry. Companies like Chevron,
BP, Ergon, and Citgo that were part of LOGIIC, those organizations felt this shared
responsibility, not only within their organizations, but within sectors.There’s a merging,
an understanding of supply chain integrity.These companies are very intimate; they’ve
linked with one another. One company might be the provider of crude to another com-
pany’s reﬁnery, and that company might be pumping its crude through maybe the com-
pany that gave it the reﬁned products, so the crude is coming from one company and
going through a reﬁnery; and the reﬁned products that come out from that other com-
pany’s reﬁnery go back into the company that provided the crude pipeline.
Colby: It’s all interconnected?  
Ben:Yes, and ultimately, it’s distributed by some other company and trucked out and sold
through another company’s retail gas stations.At the end of the day, they all need to be
working together and their facilities have to work as one, as in a supply-chain sense.
Colby: I’m just glad to see projects like LOGIIC and the work you guys are doing because
the more I research this stuff, it’s kind of scary, actually.
Ben: It’s been a great opportunity.There are powerful forces that are not going to stop any-
time soon.The trend is toward increased connectivity, toward globalization.These com-
panies that we’re talking about here that we’re trying to help on LOGIIC, those are
multinational companies. It’s not a problem that’s unique to the United States.This is a
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
537

problem that exists throughout the world, because everyone is becoming more and more
connected.
Colby: I think that awareness has increased a lot over the past couple of years, which is a
good sign. It shows that people know there is a problem and that by working together,
they can address the issues. It’s already starting.Technologies and policies are out there
that can address the concerns, and it’s just a matter of getting them in place.
Well, Ben, it’s been a pleasure. I’d really like to thank you for your time today, for sharing
your experiences and knowledge with me. I look forward to working together in the
future.
Ben: My pleasure. I think this book sounds great and will probably be a real eye-opener for
people.
Cook has extremely valuable insights into many of the issues surrounding complex
system and process control system environments these days. He works on a daily basis to
help protect the nation’s critical infrastructure through awareness and better understanding of
the interdependencies between critical components of the industry sectors. His involvement
in LOGIIC, among other projects, not only gives him a unique perspective on new ways to
protect infrastructure, but also allows him to be in a thought leadership position and apply
his past experiences to solutions moving forward. It’s exciting and reassuring to hear about
some of the advances being made as well as the awareness levels among not only the
industry, but also the product vendors.
Because we have been discussing these threats and challenges that exist within process
control networks, it only makes sense to look at real-world examples of incidents where
some of these challenges or weaknesses were exploited. In the next section, we will examine
some incidents involving process control environments that made the news.
Real-Life Examples
We pulled the following examples from various presentations and articles that discuss real-life
attacks and potential threats to SCADA and process control systems.The ﬁrst several exam-
ples are from a working document published by ISA, which sets standards and provides edu-
cation and research in the process control arena.The document,“dISA-99.00.02
Manufacturing and Control Systems Security,” is recommended reading for anyone who
wants to learn more about SCADA security.
In January 2003, the SQL Slammer Worm rapidly spread from one
computer to another across the Internet and within private networks.
It penetrated a computer network at Ohio’s Davis-Besse nuclear
power plant and disabled a safety monitoring system for nearly ﬁve
hours, despite a belief by plant personnel that the network was pro-
tected by a ﬁrewall. It occurred due to an unprotected interconnec-

538
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

tion between plant and corporate networks. The SQL Slammer Worm
downed one utility’s critical SCADA network after moving from a cor-
porate network to the control center LAN. Another utility lost its
Frame Relay Network used for communications, and some petrochem-
ical plants lost Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and data historians.
A 9-1-1 call center was taken ofﬂine, airline ﬂights were delayed and
canceled, and bank ATMs were disabled.
This is an example of where patching and antivirus software would have been extremely
useful.Also note what was said about the ﬁrewall:“despite a belief by plant personnel that
the network was protected by a ﬁrewall.”This just goes to show that a ﬁrewall is not enough.
There are backdoors into networks that people don’t even realize exist because someone
may have added them for convenience, and they may not even be in use anymore but the
connection remains hot.The example shows the worm moving from the corporate network
into the plant network.The next example is just as bad, but it involves destruction of the
environment via a sewage processing plant in Australia:
Over several months in 2001, a series of cyber attacks were con-
ducted on a computerized wastewater treatment system by a dis-
gruntled contractor in Queensland, Australia. One of these attacks
caused the diversion of millions of gallons of raw sewage into a
local river and park. There were 46 intrusions before the perpetrator
was arrested.
It’s good to know that the perpetrator was arrested.You can read the complete appeal at
www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/2002/164.html. It’s interesting to note that the man
was charged with 26 counts of computer hacking. It’s also interesting that the attacker
spoofed a pumping station in order to gain access to the network:
On examination it was found that the software to enable the laptop
to communicate with the PDS system through the PDS computer had
been re-installed in the laptop on 29 February 2000 and that the
PDS Compact computer had been programmed to identify itself as
pump station 4—the identiﬁcation used by the intruder in accessing
the Council sewerage system earlier that night. The software pro-
gram installed in the laptop was one developed by Hunter
Watertech for its use in changing conﬁgurations in the PDS com-
puters. There was evidence that this program was required to
enable a computer to access the Council’s sewerage system and that
it had no other practical use.
Here is another example of a disgruntled individual—not an employee but someone an
employee had a relationship with—deciding to launch a DoS attack against a female chat
room user:
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
539

In September 2001, a teenager allegedly hacked into a computer
server at the Port of Houston in order to target a female chat room
user following an argument. It was claimed that the teenager
intended to take the woman’s computer ofﬂine by bombarding it
with a huge amount of useless data and he needed to use a number
of other servers to be able to do so. The attack bombarded
scheduling computer systems at the world’s eighth largest port with
thousands of electronic messages. The port’s web service, which con-
tained crucial data for shipping pilots, mooring companies, and sup-
port ﬁrms responsible for helping ships navigate in and out of the
harbor, was left inaccessible.
It’s noteworthy that although that attack wasn’t targeted at the process control system
directly, it was actually affected and operations were shut down. What if the attack were
directed toward the process control environment? 
The next example is not of an attack that happened, but of a threat that is far greater
than that of a mad chat room user. In an article in the Washington Post, written by Barton
Gellman and published June 27, 2002 (www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A50765-
2002Jun26), it was mentioned that much reconnaissance activity targeting Paciﬁc Gas and
Electric as well as many other utilities across the United States was originating from the
Middle East—namely Pakistan and Saudi Arabia:
Working with experts at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, the FBI traced trails of a broader reconnaissance. A
forensic summary of the investigation, prepared in the Defense
Department, said the bureau found “multiple casings of sites”
nationwide. Routed through telecommunications switches in Saudi
Arabia, Indonesia, and Pakistan, the visitors studied emergency tele-
phone systems, electrical generation and transmission, water storage
and distribution, nuclear power plants, and gas facilities.
There have also been references to Al Qaeda gathering SCADA and process control
documentation, and that computers have been seized that contain documents as well as user
guides to operate process control systems.Al Qaeda is not a mad chat room user.They will
not try to DoS a chat client; they will launch a direct attack against the critical infrastructure
if they are given a glimpse of an opportunity.This is all the more reason to take the security
of process control networks as a serious responsibility that needs to be addressed sooner
rather than later, and that needs open involvement from many different technology sectors.
Information needs to be shared across organizations, just like the information sharing prac-
tices that have been set up with government programs such as the US-CERT, FIRST, and
G-FIRST.These are all information sharing and response programs to computer-related
attacks.The work that SANS is doing should be noted, where they held a Process Control
and SCADA Security Summit in September 2006.This is exactly the kind of activity that is
www.syngress.com

Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

needed to shed light and bring awareness to the issues that we face in regard to protecting
critical infrastructure.
In the next section, we will look at examples of an attack targeting an oil reﬁnery.This is
an example of a real threat that could occur without an increase in investment and awareness.
Plant Meltdown
In this use-case example, we will follow the behavior of a disgruntled employee, John
McClane.The targeted organization is a national oil reﬁnery called Petrol123, located in
Texas. John had been working for Petrol123 for nearly 20 years as a SCADA engineer, but
he was recently ﬁred. John was overlooked for a promotion, and instead of working harder,
he became angry with other employees.After multiple reprimands and second chances, he
was ﬁnally let go. John resented the fact that he was ﬁred after 20 years of dedicated service,
and he felt he should have been promoted over his coworkers.This is where the story
begins.
The Plot
John’s job involved monitoring and responding to alarms generated by the different RTUs
and ﬂow computers around the organization. John is familiar with the inner workings of the
reﬁnery and knows how to cause considerable damage. Because John worked at Petrol123
for 20 years, he is familiar with the processing network, where RTUs and ﬂow computers
are located, as well as the geographic locations of remote substations. He devises a plan to
cause general chaos within the reﬁnery, and at this point doesn’t have much regard for the
company or his ex-coworkers. His plan to disrupt the oil reﬁnement processes comprises
spooﬁng commands to the MTU and some of the PLCs which will allow him to control
the ﬂow of crude oil into the plant.
Let’s start by looking at the process control network at Petrol123 and some of the dif-
ferent security devices that are deployed (see Figure 17.16). John is not aware of the security
devices that have been put in place, as he was never involved in IT operations.
Starting at the top, we have a standard corporate network consisting of a wireless con-
nection for the employees with laptops, and we have the standard corporate servers such as
e-mail, databases, ﬁle servers, and ﬁnancial systems.The corporate network, as we have found
in most cases, in connected to the process control network via a ﬁrewall.The ﬁrewall does
have some access control rules in place to try to prevent the spread of worms and viruses,
but they are minimal and there are many exceptions for remote access.
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
541

Figure 17.16 Petrol123 Process Control Network (Source: Visio)
The SCADA process control network (bottom right) has several devices that we should
note.The MTU takes in data from all of the RTUs, as well as the ﬂow computers moni-
toring the ﬂow of oil throughout the reﬁnery, and the oil pipeline that feeds the crude oil
into the processing plant.There is also a remote substation located miles away from the
actual reﬁnery, where ﬂow can be controlled as well as rerouted.At the substation, there are
RTUs and ﬂow monitoring systems connected directly to the pipeline.
John is familiar with most of this equipment; he knows where it’s located and has a gen-
eral understanding of how it works and its function in the environment. What he doesn’t
know is that within the past year, Petrol123 has deployed intrusion detection systems as well
as an ESM platform. John doesn’t know much about logical security, so as far as he is con-
cerned, he is in the clear.
John’s plan is pretty simple: He is going to gain access to the network via the remote
substation. Knowing it’s in an obscure location in the hill country of Texas, he is not worried
about anyone seeing him break in.The substations are also so obscure and remote that they
typically don’t have guards. John packs up his laptop, ﬁlled with some of the latest hacking
tools that he found on the Internet, as well as some how-to guides. He drives to the out-
skirts of town and does a little surveillance of the substation and surrounding area.
Everything looks clear, so he parks his car and heads over to the station, needing only to
climb the fence to get onto the property.

RTU

He breaks into the housing and locates the RTU as well as the ﬂow sensor that’s moni-
toring the pipeline. He uses a large screwdriver and pops open the cover of the RTU. Just as
he ﬁgured, an Ethernet connection leads to the RTU. John decides that accessing the net-
work directly over Ethernet rather than hacking the satellite link will be much easier.
Because this was part of his plan, he purchased a small Ethernet hub that allows for connec-
tion sharing. Next, he unplugs the connection to the RTU and the ﬂow computer and con-
nects it to his hub, then uses another cable to reconnect the RTU. Next, he plugs his laptop
into the hub as well. John knows that in the time he disconnected the RTU, there will be a
system-down alert, but because he immediately reconnected it, a system-up alert will be sent
as well.This will cause the operator monitoring the SCADA console to most likely ignore
the message, thinking it’s just a simple error.
Once on the network, John opens Ethereal, a packet capturing tool, to sniff the network
trafﬁc coming from the RTU and the ﬂow computer. Because the network is not using
DHCP, he doesn’t get an IP address automatically, so he needs to see the IP addresses that are
being used by the systems that are talking on the network. He discovers they are using stan-
dard private addresses.The RTU seems to be using 10.0.1.102 and the ﬂow computer is
using 10.0.1.103. John then assigns himself a random address of 10.0.1.191, hoping that it is
an unused address. He is now on the network, and if he wants, he can start communicating
with other connected systems. His plan involves identifying the MTU so that he can spoof it
as the source of his fabricated commands, so he can’t do anything before he identiﬁes the
address of the MTU. Remember, the only check that is done when a command is sent is
based on an IP address check to see whether the MTU or a PLC is sending the command.
John’s plan is to launch an attack by sending spoofed commands to the different RTUs
and ﬂow computers in the process control network, instructing the systems to open their
valves full throttle.This could cause pipes to break and could destroy the plant, or at least
create a considerable amount of damage.At this point, John is still capturing trafﬁc and
looking at which systems the RTU and the ﬂow computer are communicating with. He sees
that most of the trafﬁc is headed back to one address, so he assumes that is the MTU.The
RTU and the ﬂow sensor are probably updating the MTU with their latest information and
they really don’t have reason to communicate with other systems on the network. John can
also see the system as the source of several broadcast messages.
The next thing John needs to do is map out the network for logic controllers as well as
other RTUs to which he can send commands. He knows that scanning SCADA systems
with a common port scanner will probably set off alarms, so he uses Telnet to map the net-
work. Most of the systems have Telnet enabled for remote administration.
What John doesn’t know is that Petrol123 is now using ESM and has deployed intru-
sion detection systems. He ﬁgures Telnet will go under the radar because it’s used all the
time, but as his requests cross the network, the routers he passes through generate logs to
the effect that there was accepted trafﬁc from his address.This sets off alarms in ESM.The
process control network does not use DHCP and this is a very static environment, so ana-
lysts want to be alerted whenever there are any communications from hosts that have never
been seen on the network.The way this is accomplished is to map out all of the systems on
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
543

the network using assets. Once all known systems are imported to ESM as assets, a simple
rule can be written to ﬂag any trafﬁc that is not going from one asset to another.
At this point, John has been detected, although the alert that is generated is not high-
priority, so the analysts are not going to respond right away. Figure 17.17 shows the analyst’s
view of the events in question.
Figure 17.17 ArcSight Active Channel—SCADA incidents (Source: ArcSight
ESM v4.0)
In Figure 17.17, the analyst can see several correlation events, indicated by the lightning
bolt in the far-left column. Starting from the bottom, we can see the Modbus timeout events
from when John unplugged the ﬂow computer to hook up his hub.These events caused the
Failed Communication to a Flow Computer rule to ﬁre. Because the system did come back
online, these events were passed off as a ﬂuke and the analysts didn’t follow up further.The
next event we see is the Rogue System Detected event.This is triggered because of a router
event with a source that hasn’t been modeled as an asset within ESM.The analysts ﬁgure that
someone just installed a new system and didn’t alert them to the fact, so they begin investi-
gating all recent change requests.
Meanwhile, John still thinks he is home free. He does get frustrated with the process of
telneting to each possible address on the network and decides against his better judgment to
launch a scan regardless of the results. He decides to just issue a single port scan of each
system to determine what systems are alive on the network.This, of course, sets off many
alerts within ESM.
Figure 17.18 is an analyst’s view of the security posture of the process control network
as seen through ESM. Counters at each section of the network are represented by bar charts
and pie charts. In the ﬁgure, you can see three counters.The one at the upper left shows all
ESM ﬁred rules or correlation events.The pie chart shows all attacks or suspicious activity
www.syngress.com
544
Chapter 17 • Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA

targeting systems in the process control network.The third counter is a bar chart showing all
attacks or suspicious activity originating from the remote substation. It is crucial to be able
to map out the network and determine from which segment attacks are occurring so that
the scope of the attack can be narrowed down.
Figure 17.18 Holistic Security Posture Petrol123 (Source: ArcSight ESM
v4.0)
The analysts can quickly see from where the alerts are originating and what parts of the
network are being targeted.The analysts can drill down on any part of the display to get to
the underlying events, and they discover that 10.0.1.191, the address that John assigned him-
self, has not only been detected as a rogue host, but also has been the source of several port
scans.
John starts getting nervous because he has launched the scan, but he has discovered sev-
eral systems that appear to be RTUs and PLCs. He decides to start sending Modbus com-
mands to these systems. John is not an experienced programmer by any means, and he
www.syngress.com
Protecting Critical Infrastructure: Process Control and SCADA • Chapter 17
545

knows just enough about networks to get himself in trouble. He uses a packet crafting tool
to send what he thinks look like valid commands to the different systems telling them to
open their associated valves 100 percent.The systems keep replying with errors, so John gets
frustrated and decides that if he can’t dazzle them with his brilliant attack plan, he will just
launch a DoS attack on the MTU. He uses a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port ﬂood tool
and launches his attack.This is obviously picked up by the intrusion detection system, and
using ArcSight’s Network Response Module, the router access control lists between the
remote substation and the process control network are changed, blocking all trafﬁc from
John’s address.The change is done by the analyst using the authorization queue process
within the Network Response Module (see Figure 17.19).
Figure 17.19 Network Response Module—Authorization Queue (Source:
ArcSight TRM v2.0)
Figure 17.19 shows the Authorization queue in ArcSight NRM. Because this is a critical
environment, the organization does not want to take an automated response, so it lets ESM
recommend the actions that should be taken—in this case, block the source of the DoS and
let an analyst decide whether to commit the action based on the analyst’s access rights.
At this point, both a security team and the authorities have been dispatched to the
remote substation, where they ﬁnd John still fumbling with his laptop, wondering why his
attempts to DoS the MTU are not successful. He will have a long time to wonder while
serving hard time at Leavenworth Federal Prison.
Conclusion
SCADA and process control systems are extremely important in today’s automated world. We
depend on these systems to be operational for our daily activities and well-being. Process
control systems have been designed for efﬁciency and stability, but a cyber attack could bring
them to their knees.The consequences of a compromised process control system span far
greater than someone stealing your identity, or breaking into a critical server within your
organization.The consequences here could mean the difference between life and death. Not
only could a successful attack result in damage to the environment, as in the Australian
sewage treatment case, or the inability to operate a port, as in the case of the mad chat room

client, but a targeted, well-funded attack could cause the loss of human life. Luckily, this has
not happened yet.
There are challenges. It’s common knowledge that issues surround the security of process
control systems, but there are also teams of dedicated individuals who are working hard to
bring security to the forefront of any process control environment. Security needs to be an
integrated part of any organization, including the industries responsible for critical infrastruc-
ture. It’s not that they don’t care; it’s just that in the past, security hasn’t been a top priority.
These days, with all the threats of terrorism and havoc from extremist groups, as well as mali-
cious insiders, everyone is aware of the need for a converged plan of action to address these
global concerns.This is evident through projects conducted involving government, industry,
and security vendors, spanning across sectors of business to collaborate on, research, and address
the issues. It’s evident that there is community awareness of the concerns and the problems, as
SANS is holding dedicated conferences to improve the security of process control networks.
This shows that not only has the government gotten involved through DHS, but also that the
security industry has gotten involved and is willing to help secure the critical infrastructure.

Final Thoughts
Chapter 18

Introduction 
The security landscape is in ﬂux, and convergence is driving the changes. Not just tech-
nology convergence, but also functional, organizational, and skill convergence are taking
place. In looking at the subject, we did not intend for this to be a recipe book, but rather a
road map to options and opportunities. We intended to give readers at several levels in the
organization insight into future planning for the changes they will institute within their
organizations to take advantage of the changing landscape of security.
Security is becoming a mainstream element of the enterprise. It is becoming an enabler,
not just a controller of enterprise actions. It helps mobilize information and information
exchange. It will help reinforce trust across organizations and with partners. It is not a castle-
and-moat approach, but a set of highway ramps with rules of the road and enforcement that
keeps the business viable and compliant.
This subject demands attention by the entire management team, from the CEO and
business unit managers to the CIOs and emerging new-style CSOs. We hope that the book
provided you with the kind of information necessary to get all of these enterprise leaders
engaged in the changes that are taking place.
Final Thoughts from William Crowell
Security must enable action within the organization, not restrain action. Information sharing
is at the root of the gains we have made during the past two decades in productivity and
organizational effectiveness, but in many cases, those changes have been made without real
regard for the increased risks that they introduce to business processes. Now, with globaliza-
tion and networkcentric businesses, we must build an integrated approach to securing the
enterprise, making it trusted by our customers and partners, and complying with the public’s
need for transparency into enterprise operations and risks.
Bill’s Rules of the Road
■
Convergence offers the opportunity to make security a part of the business process
and an enabler of better business practices.
■
Think about erecting layers of security, each of which reduces risk and which
together offer far greater protection than a single Maginot Line.
■
Technology can improve the effectiveness of integrated security systems by orga-
nizing the events that characterize risks to our businesses and correlating them to
discover attacks and conduct forensics.
■
Begin thinking about how the elements of the security system can also be used to
accomplish other business tasks, such as video surveillance for marketing and radio
frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) for performance enhancement and tracking.

Chapter 18 • Final Thoughts

■
Don’t focus on just the insider or external threat, but rather treat them as coequal
and sometimes cooperative threats.
■
Secure the entire business process, from the supply chain to the delivery of prod-
ucts, not just the physical or informational assets.
■
The security system can never be static, but must always adapt to evolving threats.
■
Take advantage of the changes that convergence will force in the organization to
build an integrated risk assessment and risk mitigation function.
■
Pay attention to the new risks to the security system itself that convergence will
introduce, particularly where IT and networks form the foundation of new 
capabilities.
■
Worry a lot about buying or building systems that are based on proprietary rather
than standards-based technology.
Final Thoughts from Dan Dunkel
Security as a profession is taking a quantum leap forward in tandem with the technical
advancements of the twenty-ﬁrst century. We will look back a decade hence and realize
these initial stages of physical and logical security convergence truly changed and reposi-
tioned an age-old industry.A new era that redeﬁnes global risk will rely on a new generation
of security professional to establish the trusted environment required to succeed in a global
community. Collaboration will become the foundation for the next generation of security
practitioners to create new innovations concerning the protection of physical, electronic, and
human assets.
Dan’s Rules of the Road
■
Security and convergence are concepts that must be examined separately to gain
an understanding of their combined business value.
■
Enterprise security policy integrated within an IT governance framework offers
the best protection of global assets and human resources.
■
The security professional of the future understands the impact of technical innova-
tion and global business operations from both an internal and an external 
perspective.
■
Security convergence in a word is collaboration; it involves a shared responsibility for
a sound defense of global assets and business operations.
www.syngress.com
Final Thoughts • Chapter 18
551

■
The military soldier, ﬁrst responder, and corporate employee of the future are chil-
dren of technical interoperability and collaboration; this will change the global def-
initions of work, management, and risk.
■
The convergence of voice, data, and video over the global Internet Protocol (IP)
network is accelerating a redeﬁnition of the traditional electronic and physical
security business models.
■
Convergence is the most signiﬁcant trend in identity management practice and
provides the foundation of the Trusted Enterprise Model.
■
The convergence of new technologies with existing business practices creates
complexity and change.This underscores the importance of industry education
and creates opportunities for entirely new products, marketing strategies, and com-
petitive threats to traditional vendors and their sales and support channels.
■
At the core of the trusted enterprise is the basic understanding that security policy
begins at the top, with the board of directors and the CEO.
■
In the future, the valuation of a company’s stock and shareholder investment will
be tightly aligned with its global security policy.
Final Thoughts from Brian Contos
Although no one piece of technology offers a panacea for successful convergence, ESM solu-
tions are well positioned to assist in successfully enabling organizations to reach their conver-
gence goals.
Brian’s Rules of the Road
■
ESMs can be applied to many business challenges, including regulatory compli-
ance, traditional IT security, insider threats, and convergence.
■
They offer a centralized, secure, and vendor-agnostic framework for log collection.
■
Logs are enriched collection points, and log collection is extensible, leveraging fea-
tures such as normalization, categorization, compression, and encryption.
■
Logs can be collected with a number of mechanisms, such as a log collection
appliance, connectors, or direct feeds from point solutions.
■
ESMs can interoperate with virtually any device that creates a log in a networkcen-
tric environment, making them ideal for both physical and logical asset monitoring.
■
They are designed to not only address extremely high event rates within govern-
ment organizations and large enterprises, but also provide frameworks to make that
information understandable and actionable.
www.syngress.com
552
Chapter 18 • Final Thoughts

■
They are highly scalable and capable of supporting geographically dispersed
deployments as well as high-availability and tiered architectures.
■
They have practical uses for both real-time analysis and forensics investigations.
■
They offer tools that help augment human intuition in the analysis process, such as
correlation, anomaly detection, prioritization, pattern discovery, event visualization,
and event investigation.
■
They have integrated event annotation, case management, reporting, escalation, and
alerting capabilities, which aid is incident management and policy/process work-
ﬂow.
■
They can interoperate with asset conﬁguration and remediation solutions, having a
direct impact on network devices and access control systems in both proactive and
reactive scenarios.
■
They have granular access control and auditing capabilities so that multiple users
and groups with diverse requirements can be supported simultaneously.
Final Thoughts from Colby DeRodeoff
It’s no longer a question of whether physical and logical security will converge; the conver-
gence is upon us and the only question that remains is how organizations will deal with and
adapt to the changing “threatscape” of today’s world. We have seen through numerous use-
case examples the operational efﬁciencies and layered protections that can be achieved
through Enterprise Security Management (ESM) and correlation, making the decision to
embrace a converged solution not only viable, but also the only decision that will lead to a
comprehensive and complete global security organization.
Colby’s Rules of the Road
■
New technologies can be an enabler if they are understood and used properly.
■
Convergence depends on a view through a single pane of glass into information
provided by many disparate systems in order to get a holistic view into the overall
security of an organization.
■
It’s easier to sneak into an organization and steal hardware than it is to hack into a
Web server and access a conﬁdential back-end database.
■
As more physical security technologies begin to play in an IP-enabled world, the
digital intensity will increase in the form of data overload.
■
The capabilities in ESM, such as correlation and data collection, play a critical role
in any successful convergence project.
www.syngress.com
Final Thoughts • Chapter 18
553

■
New plateaus can be achieved by adopting new practices that go outside the anal-
ysis of the traditional ﬁrewall and intrusion detection data.
■
Security is not just protecting against traditional attacks, but ensuring the availability
of systems and processes, whether the threat is an attacker or a natural disaster.
■
There will be challenges in trying to implement a converged security practice. Using
the right tools will provide the technology to make the convergence possible.
■
Having the appropriate policies in place will make the strategy successful.
■
Having executive buy-in will make the program span the organizational structure
and ultimately make the project successful.
