Excel Formulas and Functions For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
S
preadsheets are such a mainstay in today’s world; the term is almost a 
household word. Certainly in our homes it is. And we don’t just mean 
because we write books on Excel. Spouses use Excel to track household expen-
ditures and insurance claims. A neighbor analyzes his eBay transactions in 
Excel. Our local merchant keeps tabs on his store’s inventory on a worksheet.
In the workplace, Excel is one of the most commonly used analysis and report-
ing tools. Financial statements, sales reports, inventory, project scheduling, 
customer activity — so much of this stuff is kept in Excel. The program’s ability 
to manipulate and give feedback about the data makes it attractive.
About This Book
This book is about the number-crunching side of Excel. Formulas are the 
keystone to analyzing data — that is, digging out nuggets of important infor-
mation. What is the average sale? How many times did we do better than 
average? How many days are left on the project? How much progress have 
we made? That sort of thing.
Formulas calculate answers, straight and to the point. But that’s not all. Excel 
has dozens of built-in functions that calculate everything from a simple aver-
age to a useful analysis of your investments to complex inferential statistics. 
But you don’t have to know it all or use it all; just use the parts that are rel-
evant to your work.
This book discusses more than 150 of these functions. But rather than just 
show their syntax and list them alphabetically, we have assembled them by 
category and provided real examples of how to use them alone, and in formu-
las, along with step-by-step instructions and illustrations of the results.
How to Use This Book
You do not have to read the book sequentially from start to finish, although 
you certainly can. Each chapter deals with a specific category of functions — 
financial in one chapter, statistical in another, and so on. Some categories are 

2
Excel Formulas and Functions For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
split over two or more chapters. We suggest two ways for you to use 
this book:
 
✓ Use the Table of Contents to find the chapters that are of interest to you.
 
✓ Use the Index to look up specific functions you are interested in.
What You Can Safely Ignore
If you already know what function you want to use and need a bit of guidance 
on it, you can find it in the index and ignore any other discussion that is in 
the same chapter (although it makes us sad to think of that). Just kidding!
You can ignore any info in the Technical Stuff icons. You can also ignore 
Chapter 1 if you are already a fairly competent Excel user — especially if you 
have used formulas and functions.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume you have a PC with Excel 2010 loaded on it. That’s a no brainer! 
We also assume you know how to navigate with a keyboard and mouse. 
Lastly, we assume you have used Excel before, even just once. We do dis-
cuss basics in Chapter 1, but not all of them. If you really need to start from 
scratch, we suggest you read the excellent Excel 2010 For Dummies by Greg 
Harvey (Wiley).
Other than that, this book is written for Excel 2010 but just between you and 
us — it works just fine with older versions of Excel. There could be a func-
tion or two that isn’t in an older version or works slightly differently. But 
Microsoft has done an excellent job of maintaining compatibility between 
versions of Excel, so when it comes to formulas and functions, you can be 
confident that what works in one version works in another.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts. Each part’s subject matter indicates 
what type of functions it covers. Use the index to find the page numbers for 
particular functions. Do read chapters that pertain to your interest. For all 
you know, other functions are even better suited to your needs. With that 
said, dig in to what is inside each part of the book.

 Introduction
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions
Part I is introductory, of course, but not all of it is so basic. Chapter 1 is the 
de facto intro chapter. That’s where you can brush up on how Excel works, 
or read about it for the first time. We discuss the Formulas tab of the Ribbon 
in Chapter 1. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 cover what is likely to be new ground to 
many readers — specifically, using the Insert Function dialog box, using array 
functions, and correcting formulas. Looking through these chapters can help 
you down the road.
Part II: Doing the Math
As the name implies, Part II is all about math. The first chapters cover 
finance-related functions and last two are plain old math – simple to sophis-
ticated. Several functions in Excel work with loan factors, interest rates, and 
returns on investments. This is the place to go when creating worksheets 
that track costs, revenue, and the like. Part of the discussion in Part II is 
about currency formatting.
Part III: Solving with Statistics
Part III is rather large because it covers a rather sizeable topic. Chapters 9, 
10, and 11 show you how to work with statistical functions. Each of these 
chapters focuses on a specific discipline. Chapter 9 covers the functions used 
in descriptive statistics, such as the ever-popular AVERAGE function, along 
with many related functions that give details about your data. Chapter 10 
focuses on significance tests. Chapter 11 rounds out the statistical functions 
with those used in predicting factors. This is where you read about forecast-
ing and looking for trends.
Part IV: Working with Data
Part IV is a biggie. Here is where you read about working with dates and 
times; how to work with strings of text; and how to pluck out pieces of data 
from a database (an area of rows and columns, that is). Chapters 12 and 13 
are the date and time chapters. Chapter 14 covers a number of cool func-
tions, such as the amazing IF and the workhorses HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP. 
Chapter 15 explains functions that provide information about your data 
and computer; it also explains working with errors. Chapter 16 is all about 
strings. No, I don’t mean the kind to fly kites. A string is a text value, and 
there is so much you can do to manipulate them. Lastly, Chapter 17 explains 
all the database functions.

Excel Formulas and Functions For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part V: The Part of Tens
And then there’s the Part of Tens — a For Dummies tradition if ever there 
was one. In Part V, we have included three chapters: tips for working with 
formulas; the most popular functions; and finally, really cool functions to go 
to town with.
Icons Used in This Book
 
A Tip gives you a little extra piece of info on the subject at hand. It may offer 
an alternate method. It may lead you to a conclusion. It may, well, give you a 
tip (just no stock tips — sorry).
 
The Remember icon holds some basic concept that is good to keep tucked 
somewhere in your brain.
 
As it implies, a Warning is serious stuff. These icons tell you to be careful — 
usually because you can accidentally erase your data or some such horrible 
event.
 
Once in a while, some tidbit is interesting to the tech-head types, but not to 
anyone else. You can read these or ignore them as you see fit.
Where to Go from Here
Roll up your sleeves, take a deep breath, and then forget all that preparing-
for-a-hard-task stuff. Using Excel is easy. You can hardly make a mistake with-
out Excel catching it. If you need to brush up on the basics, go to Chapter 1. 
This chapter is also the best place to get your first taste of formulas and func-
tions. After that, it’s up to you. The book is organized more by area of focus 
than anything else. If finance is what you do, go to Part II. If working with 
dates is what you do, go to Part IV. Seek and you will find.

Part I
Putting the Fun in 
Functions

In this part . . .
W
e cover the basics, as any good Part I of a book 
should. Here is the place to get familiar with the 
fundamentals of Excel. Chapter 1 is a quick study in work-
books, worksheets, formulas, and functions — everything 
you need to get going! If you’re a beginner or need to 
brush up on Excel, then Chapter 1 is the place to start. 
But that’s not all, folks. Chapter 2 tells you about a key 
dialog box that makes working with functions much eas-
ier. That enables you to concentrate on more important 
details, such as where you are going on your lunch break. 
Part I finishes with a one-two punch of using arrays and 
correcting formulas.

xcel is to computer programs what a Ferrari is to cars: sleek on the out-
side and a lot of power under the hood. Excel is also like a truck — it can 
handle all your data, lots of it. In fact, in Excel 2010, a single worksheet has 
17,179,869,184 places to hold data. Yes, that’s what we said — more than 17 
billion data placeholders. And that’s on just one worksheet!
 
Opening files created in earlier versions of Excel may show just the number of 
worksheet rows and columns available in the version the workbook was cre-
ated with.
Excel is used in all types of businesses. And you know how that’s possible? 
By being able to store and work with any kind of data. It doesn’t matter 
whether you’re in finance or sales, whether you run an online video store or 
organize wilderness trips, or whether you’re charting party RSVPs or track-
ing the scores of your favorite sports teams — Excel can handle all of it. Its 
number-crunching ability is just awesome! And so easy to use!
Just putting a bunch of information on worksheets doesn’t crunch the data or 
give you sums, results, or analyses. If you want to just store your data some-
where, you can use Excel or get a database program instead. In this book, we 

8
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
show you how to build formulas and how to use the dozens of built-in func-
tions that Excel provides. That’s where the real power of Excel is — making 
sense of your data.
Don’t fret that this is a challenge and that you may make mistakes. We did 
when we were ramping up. Besides, Excel is very forgiving. It won’t crash on 
you. Excel usually tells you when you made a mistake, and sometimes it even 
helps you to correct it. How many programs do that!? But first the basics. 
This first chapter gives you the springboard you need to use the rest of the 
book. We wish books like this were around when we were introduced to com-
puters. We had to stumble through a lot of this.
Working with Excel Fundamentals
Before you can write any formulas or crunch any numbers, you have to know 
where the data goes. And how to find it again. We wouldn’t want your data to 
get lost! Knowing how worksheets store your data and present it is critical to 
your analysis efforts.
Understanding workbooks and worksheets
A workbook is the same as a file. Excel opens and closes workbooks, just as 
a word processor program opens and closes documents. Click the Microsoft 
Office button, found at the upper left of your Excel screen, to view the selec-
tions found under the File menu in earlier versions of Excel. Figure 1-1 shows 
the new look for accessing basic functions such as opening, saving, printing, 
and closing your Excel files (not to mention a number of other nifty functions 
to boot!).
 
Excel 2010 (and Excel 2007) files have the .xlsx extension. Older version Excel 
files have the .xls extension.
When Excel starts up, it displays a blank workbook ready for use. If at any 
time you need another new workbook, click the Microsoft Office button and 
click on New. You will be presented with a plateful of templates, including a 
blank workbook. That’s the baby you want, so give it a click to select it and 
then click the Create button. A new workbook will open. When you have 
more than one workbook open, you pick the one you want to work on by 
selecting it in the Windows Taskbar.
A worksheet is where your data actually goes. A workbook contains at least 
one worksheet. If you didn’t have at least one, where would you put the data? 
Figure 1-2 shows an open workbook that has three sheets — Sheet1, Sheet2, 
and Sheet3. You can see these on the worksheet tabs near the bottom left of 
the screen.

10
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
At any given moment, one worksheet is always on top. In Figure 1-2, Sheet1 
is on top. Another way of saying this is that Sheet1 is the active worksheet. 
There is always one and only one active worksheet. To make another work-
sheet active, just click its tab.
 
Worksheet, spreadsheet, and just plain old sheet are used interchangeably to 
mean the worksheet.
Guess what’s really cool? You can change the name of the worksheets. 
Names like Sheet1 and Sheet2 are just not exciting. How about Baseball Card 
Collection or Last Year’s Taxes? Well, actually Last Year’s Taxes isn’t too 
exciting either.
The point is you can give your worksheets meaningful names. You have two 
ways to do this:
 
✓ Double-click the worksheet tab and then type in a new name.
 
✓ Right-click the worksheet tab, select Rename from the list, and then type 
in a new name.
Figure 1-3 shows one worksheet name already changed and another about to 
be changed by right-clicking its tab.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Changing 
the name 
of a 
worksheet.
 
You can try changing a worksheet name on your own. Do it the easy way:
 
1. Double-click a worksheet’s tab.
 
2. Type in a new name and press Enter.
 
You can change the color of worksheet tabs. Right-click the tab and select Tab 
Color from the list.
To insert a new worksheet into a workbook, click the Insert sheet tab, which 
is located after the last worksheet tab. Figure 1-4 shows how. To delete a 
worksheet, just right-click the worksheet’s tab and select Delete from the list.

11
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
Don’t delete a worksheet unless you really mean to. You cannot get it back 
after it is gone. It does not go into the Windows Recycle Bin.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Inserting 
a new 
worksheet. 
You can insert many new worksheets. The limit of how many is based on 
your computer’s memory, but you should have no problem inserting 200 or 
more. Of course we hope you have a good reason for having so many. Which 
brings us to the next point.
Worksheets organize your data. Use them wisely and you will find it easy to 
manage your data. For example, let’s say you are the boss (we thought you’d 
like that!), and you have 30 employees that you are tracking information 
on over the course of a year. You may have 30 worksheets — one for each 
employee. Or you may have 12 worksheets — one for each month. Or you 
may just keep it all on one worksheet. How you use Excel is up to you, but 
Excel is ready to handle whatever you throw at it.
 
New Excel files default to having three worksheets. You can change this 
default number on the Personalize tab in the Excel Options dialog box. To dis-
play the dialog box, click the Microsoft Office button and then click the Excel 
Options button.
Introducing the Formulas Ribbon
It’s a fact of life — or rather, a fact of Microsoft marketing — that each new 
release of Office has a slightly different look. The folks at Microsoft went 
whole hog with Office 2007. Imagine this — no menus or toolbars. These have 
been such staples of Windows applications that only something amazing 
could upstage them.
Without further ado, we present the Ribbon. The Ribbon sits at the top of the 
application where menus used to unfold and toolbars made their home. A few 
items do appear as menu headers along the top of the Excel screen, but they 
actually work more like tabs. Click them, and no menus appear. Instead, the 
Ribbon presents the items that are related to the clicked header.
Figure 1-5 shows the top part of the screen, in which the Ribbon displays 
the items that appear when you click the Formulas header. In the figure, the 

12
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Ribbon is set to show formula-based methods. Along the left, functions are 
categorized. One of the categories is opened to show how you can access a 
particular function.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Getting to 
know the 
Ribbon.
 
These categories are along the bottom of the Formulas Ribbon:
 
✓ Function Library: This includes the Function Wizard, the AutoSum fea-
ture, and the categorized functions.
 
✓ Named Cells: These features manage named areas. In fact, the new 
Name Manager is here, a brand-new Excel 2007 feature.
 
✓ Formula Auditing: These features have been through many Excel incar-
nations, but never before have the features been so prominent. Also 
here is the Watch Window, which lets you keep an eye on the values in 
designated cells, but within one window. In Figure 1-6 you can see that a 
few cells have been assigned to the Watch Window. If any values change, 
you can see in the Watch Window. Note how the watched cells are on 
sheets that are not the current active sheet. Neat!
 
✓ Calculation: This is where you manage calculation settings, such as 
whether calculation is automatic or manual.
 
✓ Solutions: Any loaded add-ins that provide further functions appear 
here. In Figure 1-5, the Data Analysis Add-in is just another name for the 
ever-popular Analysis ToolPak.

13
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
Figure 1-6: 
Eyeing the 
Watch 
Window.
 
 
Another new feature that goes hand in hand with the Ribbon is the Quick 
Access Toolbar. (So there is a toolbar after all!) In Figure 1-5 the Quick Access 
Toolbar sits just under the left side of the Ribbon. On it are icons that per-
form actions with a single click. The icons are ones you select by using the 
Customization tab in the Excel Options dialog box. You can put the toolbar 
above or below the Ribbon by right-clicking the Quick Access Toolbar and 
choosing the option.
Working with rows, column, 
cells, ranges, and tables
A worksheet contains cells. Lots of them. Billions of them. This might seem 
unmanageable, but actually it’s pretty straightforward. Figure 1-7 shows a 
worksheet filled with data. Use this to look at a worksheet’s components. 
Each cell can contain data or a formula. In Figure 1-7, the cells contain data. 
Some, or even all, cells could contain formulas, but that’s not the case here.
Columns have letter headers — A, B, C, and so on. You can see these listed 
horizontally just above the area where the cells are. After you get past the 26th 
column, a double lettering system is used — AA, AB, and so on. After all the 
two-letter combinations are used up, a triple-letter scheme is used. Rows are 
listed vertically down the left side of the screen and use a numbering system.
You find cells at the intersection of rows and columns. Cell A1 is the cell 
at the intersection of column A and row 1. A1 is the cell’s address. There is 
always an active cell — that is, a cell in which any entry would go into should 
you start typing. The active cell has a border around it. Also, the contents of 
the active cell are seen in the Formula Box.
 
When we speak of, or reference, cell, we are referring to its address. The 
address is the intersection of a column and row. To talk about cell D20 means 
to talk about the cell that you find at the intersection of column D and row 20.

14
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
Figure 1-7: 
Looking at 
what goes 
into a work-
sheet.
 
In Figure 1-7, the active cell is C7. You have a couple of ways to see this. For 
starters, cell C7 has a border around it. Also notice that the column head 
C is shaded, as well as row number 7. Just above the column headers are 
the Name Box and the Formula Box. The Name Box is all the way to the left 
and shows the active cell’s address of C7. To the right of the Name Box, the 
Formula Box shows the contents of cell C7.
Getting to know the Formula Bar
Taken together, the Formula Box and the Name 
Box make up the Formula Bar. You use the 
Formula Bar quite a bit as you work with for-
mulas and functions. The Formula Box is used 
to enter and edits formulas. The Formula Box 
is the long entry box that starts in the middle of 
the bar. When you enter a formula into this box, 
you then can click the little check-mark button 
to finish the entry. The check-mark button is 
only visible when you are entering a formula. 
Pressing the Enter key also completes your 
entry; clicking the X cancels the entry.
An alternative is to enter a formula directly into 
a cell. The Formula Box displays the formula 
as it is being entered into the cell. When you 
want to see just the contents of a cell that has 
a formula, make that cell active and look at its 
contents in the Formula Box. Cells that have 
formulas do not normally display the formula, 
but instead display the result of the formula. 
When you want to see the actual formula, the 
Formula Box is the place to do it. The Name 
Box, on the left side of the Formula Bar, is used 
to select named areas in the workbook. This is 
addressed further in the material.

15
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
If the Formula Bar is not visible, choose the Advanced tab; in the Display sec-
tion in the Excel Options dialog box, choose to make it visible.
A range is usually a group of adjacent cells, although noncontiguous cells can 
be included in the same range (but that’s mostly for rocket scientists and 
those obsessed with calculus). For your purposes, assume a range is a group 
of continuous cells. Make a range right now! Here’s how:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer over the first cell where you wish to define 
a range.
 
2. Press and hold the left mouse button down.
 
3. Move the pointer to the last cell of your desired area.
 
4. Release the mouse button.
Figure 1-8 shows what happened when we did this. We selected a range of 
cells. The address of this range is A3:D21.
 
A range address looks like two cell addresses put together, with a colon (:) in 
the middle. And that’s what it is! A range address starts with the address of 
the cell in the upper left of the range, then has a colon, and then ends with the 
address of the cell in the lower right.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Selecting a 
range 
of cells.
 
One more detail about ranges — you can give them a name. This is a great 
feature because you can think about a range in terms of what it is used for, 
instead of what its address is. Also, if we did not take the extra step to assign 
a name, the range would be gone as soon as we clicked anywhere on the 
worksheet. When a range is given a name, you can repeatedly use the range 
by using its name.

16
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Say you have a list of clients on a worksheet. What’s easier — thinking of 
exactly which cells are occupied, or thinking that there is your list of clients?
Throughout this book, we use areas made of cell addresses and ranges, 
which have been given names. It’s time to get your feet wet creating a named 
area. Here’s what you do:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer over a cell, click and hold the left mouse 
button down, and drag the pointer around.
 
2. Release the mouse button when done.
 
 You’ve select an area of the worksheet.
 
3. Click Name a Range in the Named Cells category on the Formulas 
Ribbon.
 
 The New Name dialog box appears. Figure 1-9 shows you how it looks 
so far.
 
4. Name the area if need be.
 
 Excel guesses that you want to name the area with the value it finds 
in the top cell of the range. That may or may not be what you want. 
Change the name if you need to. In this example, we changed the name 
to Clients.
 
 An alternative method to naming an area is to select it, type the name in 
the Name Box (left of the Formula Bar), and press the Enter key.
 
Figure 1-9: 
Adding a 
name to the 
workbook.
 
 
5. Click the OK button.
That’s it. Hey, you’re already on your way to being an Excel pro! Now that 
you have a named area, you can easily select your data at any time. Just go to 
the Name Box and select it from the list. Figure 1-10 shows how we select the 
Clients area we set up.

17
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
Figure 1-10: 
Using the 
Name Box 
to find the 
named area.
 
Tables work in much the same manner as named areas. Tables have a few 
features that are unavailable to simple named areas. With tables you can indi-
cate that the top row contains header labels. Further, tables default to have 
filtering ability. Figure 1-11 shows a table on a worksheet, with headings and 
filtering ability.
 
Figure 1-11: 
Trying a 
table.
 
With filtering, you can limit which rows show, based on which values you 
select to display.
 
The Insert Ribbon contains the button to use for inserting a table. 
Formatting your data
Of course you want to make your data look all spiffy and shiny. Bosses like 
that. Is the number 98.6 someone’s temperature? Is it a score on a test? Is it 
ninety-eight dollars and sixty cents? Is it a percentage? Any of these formats 
is correct:
 
✓ 98.6
 
✓ $98.60
 
✓ 98.6%

18
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Excel lets you format your data in just the way you need. Formatting options 
are on the Home Ribbon, in the Number category.
Figure 1-12 shows how formatting helps in the readability and understand-
ing of a worksheet. Cell B1 has a monetary amount and is formatted with the 
Accounting style. Cell B2 is formatted as a percent. The actual value in cell B2 
is .05. Cell B7 is formatted as currency. The currency format displays a nega-
tive value in parentheses. This is just one of the formatting options for cur-
rency. Chapter 5 explains further about formatting currency.
 
Figure 1-12: 
Formatting 
data.
 
Besides selecting formatting on the Home Ribbon, you can use the familiar (in 
previous versions) Format Cells dialog box. This is the place to go for all your 
formatting needs beyond what’s available on the toolbar. You can even create 
custom formats. You can display the Format Cells dialog box two ways:
 
✓ On the Home Ribbon, click the drop-down list from the Number cat-
egory, and then click More Number Formats.
 
✓ Right-click any cell and select Format Cells from the pop-up menu.
Figure 1-13 shows the Format Cells dialog box. So many settings are there it 
can make your head spin! We discuss this dialog box and formatting more 
extensively in Chapter 5.
Getting help
Excel is complex; you can’t deny that. And lucky for all of us, help is just a key 
press away. Yes, literally one key press — just press the F1 key. Try it now.

19
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
This starts the Help system. From there you can search on a keyword or 
browse through the Help Table of Contents. Later on, when you are working 
with Excel functions, you can get help on specific functions directly by click-
ing the Help on this function link in the Insert Function dialog box. Chapter 2 
covers the Insert Function dialog box in detail.

Gaining the Upper Hand on Formulas
Okay, time to get to the nitty-gritty of what Excel is all about. Sure, you can 
just enter data and leave it as is, and even generate some pretty charts from 
it. But getting answers from your data, or creating a summary of your data, or 
applying what-if tests — all of this takes formulas.
To be specific, a formula in Excel calculates something, or returns some 
result based on data in the worksheet. A formula is placed in cells and must 
start with an equal sign (=) to tell Excel that it is a formula and not data. 
Sounds simple, and it is.
 
All formulas should start with an equal (=) sign. An alternative is to start a for-
mula with a plus sign (+). This keeps Excel compatible with Lotus 1-2-3.
Look at some very basic formulas. Table 1-1 shows a few formulas and tells 
you what they do.

20
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
We use the word return to refer to what displays after a formula or function 
does its thing. So to say the formula returns a 7 is the same as saying the for-
mula calculated the answer to be 7.
Table 1-1 
Basic Formulas
Formula
What It Does
=2 + 2
Returns the number 4.
=A1 + A2
Returns the sum of the values in cells A1 and A2, whatever 
those values may be. If either A1 or A2 has text in it, then 
an error is returned.
=D5
The cell that contains this formula ends up displaying the 
value that is in cell D5. If you try to enter this formula into 
cell D5 itself, you create a circular reference. That is a 
no-no. See Chapter 4.
=SUM(A2:A5)
Returns the sum of the values in cells A2, A3, A4, and A5. 
Recall from above the syntax for a range. This formula uses 
the SUM function to sum up all the values in the range.
Entering your first formula
Ready to enter your first formula? Make sure Excel is running and a work-
sheet is in front of you, and then:
 
1. Click an empty cell.
 
2. Type this in: = 10 + 10.
 
3. Press Enter.
That was easy, wasn’t it? You should see the result of the formula — the 
number 20.
Try another. This time you create a formula that adds together the value of 
two cells:
 
1. Click any cell.
 
2. Type in any number.
 
3. Click another cell.
 
4. Type in another number.

21
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
5. Click a third cell.
 
 This cell will contain the formula.
 
6. Type a =.
 
7. Click the first cell.
 
 This is an important point in the creation of the formula. The formula 
is being written by both your keyboard entry and clicking around with 
the mouse. The formula should look about half complete, with an equal 
sign immediately followed by the address of the cell you just clicked. 
Figure 1-14 shows what this looks like. In the example, the value 15 has 
been entered into cell B3 and the value 35 into cell B6. The formula was 
started in cell E3. Cell E3 so far has =B3 in it.
 
Figure 1-14: 
Entering a 
formula that 
references 
cells.
 
 
8. Enter a +.
 
9. Click the cell that has the second entered value.
 
 In this example, this is cell B6. The formula in cell E3 now looks like this: 
=B3 + B6. You can see this is Figure 1-15.
 
10. Press Enter.
 
 This ends the entry of the function. All done! Congratulations!
Figure 1-16 shows how the example ended up. Cell E3 displays the result of 
the calculation. Also notice that the Formula Bar displays the contents of cell 
E3, which really is the formula.

Understanding references
References abound in Excel formulas. You can reference cells. You can refer-
ence ranges. You can reference cells and ranges on other worksheets. You 
can reference cells and ranges in other workbooks. Formulas and functions 
are at their most useful when using references, so you need to understand 
them.
And if that isn’t enough to stir the pot, you can use three types of cell refer-
ences: relative, absolute, and mixed. Okay, one step at a time here. Try a for-
mula that uses a range.
Formulas that use ranges often have a function in the formula, so use the 
SUM function here:

23
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
1. Enter some numbers in many cells going down one column.
 
2. Click in another cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =SUM( to start the function.
 
4. Click the first cell that has an entered value, hold the left mouse button 
down, and drag the mouse pointer over all the cells that have values.
 
5. Release the mouse button.
 
 The range address appears where the formula and function are being 
entered.
 
6. Enter a ).
 
7. Press Enter.
 
8. Give yourself a pat on the back.
 
Wherever you drag the mouse to enter the range address into a function, you 
can also just type in the address of the range, if you know what it is.
Excel is dynamic when it comes to cell addresses. If you have a cell with a for-
mula that references a different cell’s address and you copy the formula from 
the first cell to another cell, the address of the reference inside the formula 
changes. Excel updates the reference inside the formula to match the number 
of rows and/or columns that separate the original cell (where the formula is 
being copied from) from the new cell (where the formula is being copied to). 
This may be confusing, so try an example so you can see this for yourself:
 
1. In cell B2, enter 100.
 
2. In cell C2, enter =B2 * 2.
 
3. Press Enter.
 
 Cell C2 now returns the value 200.
 
4. If C2 is not the active cell, click it once.
 
5. Press Ctrl + C, or click the Copy button in the Clipboard category on 
the Home Ribbon.
 
6. Click cell C3.
 
7. Press Ctrl + V, or click the Paste button in the Clipboard category on 
the Home Ribbon.
 
8. If you see a strange moving line around cell C2, press the ESC key.
 
 Cell C3 should be the active cell, but if it is not, just click it once. Look at 
the Formula Bar. The contents of cell C3 are =B3 * 2, and not the =B2 
* 2 that you copied.
 
Did you see a moving line around a cell? That line’s called a marquee. It’s a 
reminder that you are in the middle of a cut or copy operation, and the mar-
quee goes around the cut or copied data.

24
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
What happened? Excel, in its wisdom, assumed that if a formula in cell C2 ref-
erences the cell B2 — one cell to the left, then the same formula put into cell 
C3 is supposed to reference cell B3 — also one cell to the left.
When copying formulas in Excel, relative addressing is usually what you 
want. That’s why it is the default behavior. Sometimes you do not want rela-
tive addressing but rather absolute addressing. This is making a cell reference 
fixed to an absolute cell address so that it does not change when the formula 
is copied.
In an absolute cell reference, a dollar sign ($) precedes both the column 
letter and the row number. You can also have a mixed reference in which the 
column is absolute and the row is relative or vice versa. To create a mixed 
reference, you use the dollar sign in front of just the column letter or row 
number. Here are some examples:
Reference Type
Formula
What Happens After Copying the Formula
Relative
=A1
Either, or both, the column letter A and the 
row number 1 can change.
Absolute
=$A$1
The column letter A and the row number 1 do 
not change.
Mixed
=$A1
The column letter A does not change. The row 
number 1 can change.
Mixed
=A$1
The column letter A can change. The row 
number 1 does not change.
Copying formulas with the fill handle
As long as we’re on the subject of copying formulas around, take a look at the 
fill handle. You’re gonna love this one! The fill handle is a quick way to copy 
the contents of a cell to other cells with just a single click and drag.
The active cell always has a little square box in the lower-right side of its 
border. That is the fill handle. When you move the mouse pointer over the 
fill handle, the mouse pointer changes shape. If you click and hold down the 
mouse button, you can now drag up, down, or across over other cells. When 
you let go of the mouse button, the contents of the active cell automatically 
copy to the cells you dragged over.
A picture is worth a thousand words, so take a look. Figure 1-17 shows a 
worksheet that adds some numbers. Cell E4 has this formula: =B4 + C4 + 
D4. This formula needs to be placed in cells E5 through E15. Look closely at 
cell E4. The mouse pointer is over the fill handle, and it has changed to what 
looks like a small, black plus sign. We are about to use the fill handle to drag 
that formula to the other cells. Clicking and holding the left mouse button 
down and then dragging down to E15 does the trick.

Getting 
ready to 
drag the for-
mula down.
 
Figure 1-18 shows what the worksheet looks like after the fill handle is used 
to get the formula into all the cells. This is a real timesaver. Also, you can see 
that the formula in each cell of column E correctly references the cells to its 
left. This is the intention of using relative referencing. For example, the for-
mula in cell E15 ended up with this formula: =B15 + C15 + D15.

Assembling formulas the right way
There’s a saying in the computer business: garbage in, garbage out. And that 
applies to how formulas are put together. If a formula is constructed the 
wrong way, it either returns an incorrect result or an error.

26
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Two types of errors can occur in formulas. In one type, Excel can calculate 
the formula, but the result is wrong. In the other type, Excel is not able to cal-
culate the formula. Check out both of these.
A formula can work and still produce an incorrect result. Excel does not report 
an error because there is no error for it to find. Often this is the result of not 
using parentheses properly in the formula. Take a look at some examples:
Formula
Result
=7 + 5 * 20 + 25 / 5
112
=(7 + 5) * 20 + 25 / 5
245
=7 + 5 *( 20 + 25) / 5
52
=(7 + 5 * 20 + 25) / 5
26.4
All of these are valid formulas, but the placement of parentheses makes a dif-
ference in the outcome. You must take into account the order of mathemati-
cal operators when writing formulas. The order is:
 
1. Parentheses
 
2. Exponents
 
3. Multiplication and division
 
4. Addition and subtraction
This is a key point of formulas. It is easy to just accept a returned answer. 
After all, Excel is so smart. Right? Wrong! Like all computer programs, Excel 
can only do what it is told. If you tell it to calculate an incorrect but structur-
ally valid formula, it will do so. So watch your p’s and q’s! Er, rather your 
parentheses and mathematical operators when building formulas.
The second type of error is when there is a mistake in the formula or in the 
data the formula uses that prevents Excel from calculating the result. Excel 
makes your life easier by telling you when such an error occurs. To be pre-
cise, it does one of the following:
 
✓ Excel displays a message when you attempt to enter a formula that is 
not constructed correctly.
 
✓ Excel returns an error message in the cell when there is something 
wrong with the result of the calculation.
First, let’s see what happened when we tried to finish entering a formula that 
had the wrong number of parentheses. Figure 1-19 shows this.
Excel finds an uneven number of open and closed parentheses. Therefore the 
formula cannot work (it does not make sense mathematically), and Excel tells 
you so. Watch for these messages; they often offer a solution.

27
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
Figure 1-19: 
Getting a 
message 
from Excel.
 
On the other side of the fence are errors in returned values. If you got this 
far, then the formula’s syntax passed muster, but something went awry none-
theless. Possible errors are:
 
✓ Attempting to perform a mathematical operation on text
 
✓ Attempting to divide a number by 0 (a mathematical no-no)
 
✓ Trying to reference a nonexistent cell, range, worksheet, or workbook
 
✓ Entering the wrong type of information into an argument function
This is by no means an exhaustive list of possible error conditions, but you 
get the idea. So what does Excel do about it? There are a handful of errors 
that Excel places into the cell with the problem formula.
Error Type When It Happens
#DIV/0!
When you’re trying to divide by 0
#N/A!
When a formula or a function inside a formula cannot find the 
referenced data
#NAME?
When text in a formula is not recognized
#NULL!
When a space was used instead of a comma in formulas that ref-
erence multiple ranges; a comma is necessary to separate range 
references
#NUM!
When a formula has numeric data that is invalid for the opera-
tion type
#REF!
When a reference is invalid
#VALUE!
When the wrong type of operand or function argument is used
Chapter 4 discusses catching and handling formula errors in detail.

Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Using Functions in Formulas
Functions are like little utility programs that do a single thing. For example, 
the SUM function sums up numbers, the COUNT function counts, and the 
AVERAGE function calculates an average.
There are functions to handle many different needs: working with numbers, 
working with text, working with dates and times, working with finance, and 
so on. Functions can be combined and nested (one goes inside another). 
Functions return a value, and this value can be combined with the results of 
another function or formula. The possibilities are nearly endless.
But functions do not exist on their own. They are always a part of a formula. 
Now that can mean that the formula is made up completely of the function or 
that the formula combines the function with other functions, data, operators, 
or references. But functions must follow the formula golden rule: Start with 
the equal sign. Look at some examples:
Function/Formula
Result
=SUM(A1:A5)
Returns the sum of the values in the 
range A1:A5. This is an example of a 
function serving as the whole formula.
=SUM(A1:A5) /B5
Returns the sum of the values in the 
range A1:A5 divided by the value in 
cell B5. This is an example of mixing a 
function’s result with other data.
=SUM(A1:A5) + AVERAGE(B1:B5)
Returns the sum of the range A1:A5 
added with the average of the range 
B1:B5. This is an example of a formula 
that combines the result of two 
functions.
Ready to write your first formula with a function in it? This function creates 
an average:
 
1. Enter some numbers in a column’s cells.
 
2. Click an empty cell where you want to see the result.
 
3. Enter =AVERAGE( to start the function.
 
 Note: Excel presents a list of functions that have the same spelling as the 
function name you type. The more letters you type, the shorter the list 
becomes. The advantage is, for example, typing the letter A, using the ↓ 
to select the AVERAGE function, and then pressing the Tab key.

29
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
4. Click the first cell with an entered value and, while holding the mouse 
button, drag the mouse pointer over the other cells that have values.
 
 An alternative is to enter the range of those cells.
 
5. Enter a ).
 
6. Press Enter.
If all went well, your worksheet should look a little bit like ours, in Figure 1-20. 
Cell B10 has the calculated result, but look up at the Formula Bar and you can 
see the actual function as it was entered.
 
Figure 1-20: 
Entering the 
AVERAGE 
function.
 
Formulas and functions are dependent on the cells and ranges to which 
they refer. If you change the data in one of the cells, the result returned by 
the function updates. You can try this now. In the example you just did with 
making an average, click one of the cells with the values and enter a different 
number. The returned average changes.
 
A formula can consist of nothing but a single function — preceded by an equal 
sign, of course!
Looking at what goes into a function
Most functions take inputs — called arguments or parameters — that specify 
the data the function is to use. Some functions take no arguments, some take 
one, and others take many — it all depends on the function. The argument 
list is always enclosed in parentheses following the function name. If there’s 
more than one argument, they are separated by commas. Look at a few 
examples:

30
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Function
Comment
=NOW()
Takes no arguments.
=AVERAGE(A6,A11,B7)
Can take up to 255 arguments. 
Here, three cell references are 
included as arguments. The argu-
ments are separated by commas.
=AVERAGE(A6:A10,A13:A19,A23:A29) In this example, the arguments are 
range references instead of cell 
references. The arguments are 
separated by commas.
=IPMT(B5, B6, B7, B8)
Requires four arguments. Commas 
separate the arguments.
Some functions have required arguments and optional arguments. You must 
provide the required ones. The optional ones are well, optional. But you may 
want to include them if their presence helps the function return the value 
you need.
The IPMT function is a good example. Four arguments are required, and two 
more are optional. You can read more about the IPMT function in Chapter 5. 
You can read more about function arguments in Chapter 2.
Arguing with a function
Memorizing the arguments that every function takes would be a daunting 
task. We can only think that if you could pull that off you could be on televi-
sion. But back to reality, you don’t have to memorize them because Excel 
helps you select what function to use, and then tells you which arguments 
are needed.
Figure 1-21 shows the Insert Function dialog box. This great helper is 
accessed by clicking the Insert Function button on the Formulas Ribbon. The 
dialog box is where you select a function to use.
The dialog box contains a listing of all available functions — and there are 
a lot of them! So to make matters easier, the dialog box gives you a way to 
search for a function by a keyword, or you can filter the list of functions by 
category.
 
If you know which category a function belongs in, you can click the function 
category button in the Formulas Ribbon and select the function from the list.

31
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
 
Figure 1-21: 
Using the 
Insert 
Function 
dialog box.
 
Try it! Here’s an example of how to use the Insert Function dialog box to mul-
tiply a few numbers:
 
1. Enter three numbers in three different cells.
 
2. Click an empty cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Click the Insert Function button on the Formulas Ribbon.
 
 As an alternative, you can just click the little fx button on the Formula 
Bar. The Insert Function dialog box appears.
 
4. Select either All or Math & Trig.
 
5. In the list of functions, find and select the PRODUCT function.
 
6. Click the OK button.
 
 This closes the Insert Function dialog box and displays the Function 
Arguments dialog box (see Figure 1-22), where you can enter as many 
arguments as needed. Initially it may not look like it can accommodate 
enough arguments. You need to enter three in this example, but it looks 
like there is only room for two. This is like musical chairs!
 
 More argument entry boxes appear as you need them. First, though, how 
do you enter the argument? There are two ways.
 
7. Enter the argument one of two ways:
 
• Type the numbers or cell references into the boxes.
 
• Use those funny-looking squares to the right of the entry boxes.
 
 In Figure 1-22 two entry boxes are ready to go. To the left of them are 
the names Number1 and Number2. To the right of the boxes are the little 
squares. These squares are actually called RefEdit controls. They make 
argument entry a snap. All you do is click one, click the cell with the 
value, and then press Enter.

instead is the address of the cell that contains the value — exactly what 
you want.
 
11. Repeat Steps 7–9 to enter the other two cell references.

34
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
You do not have to use the Insert Function dialog box to enter functions into 
cells. It is there for convenience. As you become familiar with certain func-
tions that you use repeatedly, you may find it faster to just type the function 
directly into the cell.
Nesting functions
Nesting is something a bird does, isn’t it? Well, a bird expert would know the 
answer to that one, but we do know how to nest Excel functions. A nested 
function is tucked inside another function, as one of its arguments. Nesting 
functions let you return results you would have a hard time getting to other-
wise. (Nested functions are used in examples in various places in the book. 
The COUNTIF, AVERAGE, and MAX functions are discussed in Chapter 9.)
Figure 1-26 shows the daily closing price for the S&P 500, for the month of 
August 2009. A possible analysis is to see how many times the closing price 
was higher than the average for the month. Therefore, the average needs to 
be calculated first, before you can compare any single price. By embedding 
the AVERAGE function inside another function, the average is first calculated.
 
When a function is nested inside another, the inner function is calculated first. 
Then that result is used as an argument for the outer function.
 
Figure 1-26: 
Nesting 
functions.
 
The COUNTIF function counts the number of cells in a range that meet a 
condition. The condition in this case is that any single value in the range 
is greater than (>) the average of the range. The formula in cell D7 is 

35
 Chapter 1: Tapping into Formula and Function Fundamentals
=COUNTIF(B5:B25, “>” & AVERAGE(B5:B25)). The AVERAGE func-
tion is evaluated first, and then the COUNTIF function is evaluated using the 
returned value from the nested function used as an argument.
Nested functions are best entered directly. The Insert Function dialog box 
does not make it easy to enter a nested function. Try one. In this example, 
you use the AVERAGE function to find the average of the largest values from 
two sets of numbers. The nested function in this example is MAX. You enter 
the MAX function twice within the AVERAGE function:
 
1. Enter a few different numbers in one column.
 
2. Enter a few different numbers in a different column.
 
3. Click an empty cell where you want the result to appear.
 
4. Enter =AVERAGE( to start the function entry.
 
5. Enter MAX(.
 
6. Click the first cell in the second set of numbers, press the mouse 
button, and drag over all the cells of the first set.
 
 The address of this range enters into the MAX function.
 
7. Enter a closing parenthesis to end the first MAX function.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Once again, enter MAX(.
 
10. Click the first cell in the second set of numbers, press the mouse 
button, and drag over all the cells of the second set.
 
 The address of this range enters into the MAX function.
 
11. Enter a closing parenthesis to end the second MAX function.
 
12. Enter a ).
 
 This ends the AVERAGE function.
 
13. Press Enter.
Figure 1-27 shows the result of your nested function. Cell C14 has this for-
mula: =AVERAGE(MAX(B4:B10),MAX(D4:D10)).
 
When using nested functions, the outer function is preceded with an equal 
sign (=) if it is the beginning of the formula. Any nested functions are not pre-
ceded with an equal sign.

xcel has so many functions that it’s both a blessing and a curse. You can 
do many things with Excel functions — if you can remember them all! 
Even if you remember many function names, memorizing all the arguments 
the functions can use is a challenge.
 
Arguments are pieces of information that functions use to calculate and return 
a value.
Never fear: Microsoft hasn’t left you in the dark with figuring out which 
arguments to use. Excel has a great utility to help insert functions, and their 
arguments, into your worksheet. This makes it a snap to find and use the 
functions you need. You can save both time and headaches, and make fewer 
errors to boot — so read on!
Getting Familiar with the Insert 
Function Dialog Box
The Insert Function dialog box (shown in Figure 2-1) is designed to simplify 
the task of using functions in your worksheet. The dialog box not only 
helps you locate the proper function for the task at hand but also provides 

38
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
information about the arguments that the function takes. If you use the Insert 
Function dialog box, you don’t have to type functions directly into worksheet 
cells. Instead, the dialog box guides you through a (mostly) point-and-click 
procedure — a good thing, because if you’re anything like us, you need all 
the help you can get.
In the Insert Function dialog box, you can browse functions by category or 
scroll the complete alphabetical list. A search feature — where you type a 
phrase in the Search for a Function box, click the Go button, and see what 
comes up — is helpful. When you highlight a function in the Select a Function 
box, a brief description of what the function does appears under the list. You 
can also click the Help on this function link at the bottom of the dialog box to 
view more detailed information about the function.
 
Figure 2-1:

You can display the Insert Function dialog box in three ways:
 
✓ Click the Insert Function button on the Formulas Ribbon.
 
✓ On the Formula Bar, click the smaller Insert Function button (which 
looks like fx).
 
✓ Click the small arrow to the right of the AutoSum feature on the 
Formulas Ribbon and select More Functions. AutoSum has a list of 
commonly used functions that you can insert with a click. If you select 
More Functions, the Insert Function dialog box opens. See Figure 2-2.

Finding the Correct Function
The first step to using a function is finding the one you need! Even when you 
do know the one you need, you may not remember all the arguments it takes. 
You can find a function in the Insert Function dialog box in two ways:
 
✓ Search: Type one or more keywords or a phrase into the Search for a 
function box. Then click the Go button. 
 
• If a match is made, the Or select a category drop-down list displays 
Recommended, and the Select a function box displays a list of the 
functions that match your search. 
 
• If no match is made, the Or select a category drop-down list dis-
plays Most Recently Used functions, and the most recently used 
functions appears in the Select a function dialog box.
 
✓ Browse: Click the Or select a category down arrow and from the drop-
down list, select All, or select an actual function category. When an 
actual category is selected, the Select a function box updates to just the 
relevant functions. You can look through the list to find the function you 
want. Alternatively, if you know the category, you can select it on the 
Formulas Ribbon.
Table 2-1 lists the categories in the Or select a category drop-down list. 
Finding the function you need is different from knowing which function you 
need. Excel is great at giving you the functions, but you do need to know 
what to ask for.

Entering Functions Using the 
Insert Function Dialog Box
Now that you’ve seen how to search for or select a function, it’s time to use 
the Insert Function dialog box to actually insert a function. The dialog box 
makes it easy to enter functions that take no arguments and functions that do 
take arguments. Either way, the dialog box guides you through the process of 
entering the function.

41
 Chapter 2: Saving Time with Function Tools
Sometimes function arguments are not values but instead are references to 
cells, ranges, named areas, or tables. That this is also handled in the Insert 
Function dialog box makes its use so beneficial.
Selecting a function that 
takes no arguments
Some functions return a value, period. No arguments are needed for these 
ones. This means you don’t have to have some arguments ready to go. What 
could be easier? Here’s how to enter a function that does not take any argu-
ments. The TODAY function is used in this example:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Click the Insert Function button on the Ribbon to open the Insert 
Function dialog box.
 
3. Select All in the Or select a category drop-down list.
 
4. Scroll through the Select a Function list until you see the TODAY func-
tion and click it once.
 
 Figure 2-3 shows what our screen looks like.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Selecting a 
function.
 
 
5. Click the OK button.
 
 The Insert Function dialog box closes and the Function Arguments 
dialog box opens. The dialog box tells you that function does not take 
any arguments. Figure 2-4 shows how the screen now looks.

Figure 2-4: 
Confirming 
no argu-
ments exist 
with the 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
 
6. Click the OK button.
 
 Doing this closes the Function Arguments dialog box, and the function 
entry is complete.
 
You may have noticed that the Function Arguments dialog box says the 
Formula result will equal Volatile. This is nothing to be alarmed about! This 
just means the answer can be different each time you use the function. For 
example, TODAY will return a different date when used tomorrow.
Figure 2-5 shows how the function’s result has been returned to the work-
sheet. Cell B2 displays the date when we wrote this example. The date you 
see on your screen is the current date.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Populating 
a worksheet 
cell with 
today’s 
date.
 
 
Most functions do take arguments. The few that do not take arguments can 
return a result without needing any information. For example, the TODAY 
function just returns the current date. It doesn’t need any information to 
figure this out.

43
 Chapter 2: Saving Time with Function Tools
Selecting a function that uses arguments
Most functions take arguments to provide the information the function needs 
to perform its calculation. Some functions use a single argument; others use 
many. Taking arguments and using arguments are interchangeable terms. 
Most functions take arguments, but the number of arguments depends on the 
actual function. Some take a single argument, and some can take up to 255.
The following example shows how to use the Insert Function dialog box to 
enter a function that does use arguments. The example uses the PRODUCT 
function. Here’s how to enter the function and its arguments:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Click the Insert Function button on the Ribbon.
 
 Doing this opens the Insert Function dialog box.
 
3. Select Math & Trig in the Or select a category drop-down list.
 
4. Scroll through the Select a Function list until you see the PRODUCT 
function and then click on it once.

5. Click the OK button.
 
 The Insert Function dialog box closes, and the Function Arguments 
dialog box opens. Figure 2-7 shows what the screen looks like. The 
dialog box tells you that this function can take up to 255 arguments, yet 
there appears to be room for only 2. As you enter arguments, the dialog 
box provides a scroll bar to manage multiple arguments.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Ready 
to input

arguments.
 
 
6. In the Function Arguments dialog box, enter a number in the 
Number 1 box.
 
7. Enter another number in the Number 2 box.
 
 You are entering actual arguments. As you enter numbers in the dialog 
box, a scroll bar appears, letting you add arguments. Enter as many as 
you like, up to 255. Figure 2-8 shows how we entered eight arguments. 
Also look at the bottom left of the dialog box. As you enter functions, the 
Formula result is instantly calculated. Wouldn’t it be nice to be that smart?
 
8. Click OK to complete the function entry.
 
 Figure 2-9 shows the worksheet’s result.
Entering cells, ranges, named areas, 
and tables as function arguments
Excel is so cool. Not only can you provide single cell references as argu-
ments, but in many cases you can enter an entire range reference, or the 
name of an area or table as a single argument! And what’s more, you can 
enter these arguments by using either the keyboard or the mouse.

This example demonstrates using both single cell and range references as 
well as a named area and table as arguments. For this example, we use the 
SUM function. Here is how to use the Insert Function dialog box to enter the 
function and its arguments:
 
1. Enter some numbers in a worksheet in contiguous cells.
 
2. Select the cells, and then click the Table button on the Insert Ribbon.
 
 The Create Table dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the OK button to complete making the table.
 
 The Ribbon should display table style and other options. (If not, look 
along the Excel title bar for Table Tools, and click it.) On the left of the 
Ribbon is the name that Excel gave the table. You can change the name 
of the table, as well as the appearance.

4. Somewhere else on the worksheet, enter numbers in contiguous cells.
 
5. Select the cells, and then click the Define Name button on the 
Formulas Ribbon.
 
 The New Name dialog box opens.
 
6. Enter a name for the area.
 
 We used the name MyArea. See Figure 2-10 to see how the worksheet is 
shaping up.

7. Enter some more numbers in contiguous cells either across a row or 
down a column.
 
8. Enter a single number into cell A1.
 
9. Click an empty cell where you want the result.
 
10. Click the Insert Function button on the Formulas Ribbon.
 
 The Insert Function dialog box opens.
 
11. Select the SUM function.
 
 SUM is in the All or Math & Trig categories, and possibly in the Recently 
Used category.
 
12. Click OK.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box opens. To the right of each Number 
box is a small fancy button — a special Excel control sometimes called 
the RefEdit. It allows you to leave the dialog box, select a cell or range 
on the worksheet, and then go back into the dialog box. Whatever cell or 
range you click or drag over on the worksheet is brought into the entry 
box as a reference.

47
 Chapter 2: Saving Time with Function Tools
 
 You can type cell and range references, named areas, and table names 
directly into the Number boxes as well. The RefEdit controls are there to 
use if you want to work with the mouse instead.
 
13. Click directly on the first RefEdit.
 
 The dialog box shrinks so that the only thing visible is the field where 
you enter data. Click on cell A1, where you had entered a number.
 
14. Press the Enter key.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box reappears.
 
15.  In the second entry box, type the name of your named area.
 
 If you don’t remember the name you used, use the RefEdit control to 
select the area on the worksheet.
 
16. In the third entry box, enter your table name and press the Enter key.
 
17. If you don’t remember the name you used, use the RefEdit control to 
select the table.
 
18. In the fourth entry box, enter a range from the worksheet where some 
values are to be found.
 
 It does not matter if this range is part of a named area or table. Use the 
RefEdit if you wish to just drag the mouse over a range of numbers. Your 
screen should look similar to that in Figure 2-11.
 
Figure 2-11:

19. Click the OK button.
 
 The final sum from the various parts of the worksheet displays in the 
cell where the function was entered. Figure 2-12 shows how the example 
worksheet turned out.

Congratulations! You did it. You successfully inserted a function that took a 
cell reference, a range reference, a named area, and a table name. You’re har-
nessing the power of Excel. Look at the result — the sum of many numbers 
found in various parts of the worksheet. Just imagine how much summing 
you can do. You can have up to 255 inputs and, if needed, each one can be a 
range of cells.
 
You can use the Insert Function dialog box at any time while entering a for-
mula. This is helpful when the formula uses some values and references in 
addition to a function. Just open the Insert Function dialog box when the for-
mula entry is at the point where the function goes.
Getting help in the Insert 
Function dialog box
The number of functions and their exhaustive capabilities gives you the 
power to do great things in Excel. However, from time to time, you may need 
guidance on how to get functions to work. Lucky for you, help is just a click 
away.
Both the Insert Function and Function Arguments dialog boxes have a link 
to the Help system. At any time, you can click the Help on this function link 
in the lower-left corner of the dialog box and get help on the function you’re 
using. The Help system has many examples; often reviewing how a function 
works leads you to other, similar functions that may be better suited to your 
situation.

 Chapter 2: Saving Time with Function Tools
Using the Function Arguments 
dialog box to edit functions
Excel makes entering functions with the Insert Function dialog box easy. 
But what about when you need to change a function that has already been 
entered into a cell? What about adding arguments or taking some away? 
There is an easy way to do this!
 
1. Click in the cell with the existing function.
 
2. Click the Insert Function button.
 
 The Function Argument dialog box appears. This dialog box is already 
set to work with your function. In fact, the arguments that have already 
been entered into the function are displayed in the dialog box as well!
 
3. Add, edit, or delete arguments.
 
• To add an argument (if the function allows), use the RefEdit con-
trol to pick up the extra values from the worksheet. Alternatively, 
if you click in the bottom argument reference, a new box opens 
below it into which you can enter a value or range.
 
• To edit an argument, simply click into it and change it.
 
• To delete an argument, click into it and backspace it out.
 
4. Click OK when you’re finished.
 
 The function is updated with your changes.
Directly Entering Formulas 
and Functions
As you get sharp with functions, you will likely bypass the Insert Function 
dialog box altogether and enter functions directly. One place you can do this 
is in the Formula Bar. Another way is to just type into a cell.
Entering formulas and functions 
in the Formula Bar
When you place your entry in the Formula Bar, the entry is really going into 
the active cell. However, since the active cell can be anywhere, you may 
prefer entering formulas and functions directly in the Formula Bar. That 

50
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
way you know that the entry will land where you need it. Prior to entering a 
formula in the Formula Box (on the right side of the Formula Bar), the Name 
Box on the left lets you know where the entry will end up. The cell receiv-
ing the entry may be not be in the visible area of the worksheet. Gosh, it 
could be a million rows down and thousands of columns to the right! Once 
you start entering the formula, the Name Box becomes a drop-down list of 
functions. This is useful for nesting functions. As you enter a function in the 
Formula Box, you can click on a function in the Name Box and the function 
is inserted into the entry you started in the Formula Box. Confused? Imagine 
what we went through explaining that! Seriously though, this is a helpful way 
to assemble nested functions. Try it, get used to it, it will add to your Excel 
smarts.
When your entry is finished, press the Enter key or click the little check-mark 
button to the left of the Formula Box.
Figure 2-13 makes this clear. A formula is being entered into the Formula Box, 
and the Name Box follows along with the function(s) being entered. Note, 
though, that the active cell is not in the viewable area of the worksheet. It 
must be below and/or to the right of the viewable area because the top-left 
portion of the worksheet is shown in Figure 2-13.
 
Figure 2-13: 
Entering a 
formula in 
the Formula 
Box has 
its conve-
niences.
 
In between the Name Box and the Formula Box are three small buttons. From 
left to right, they do the following:
 
✓ Cancel the entry
 
✓ Complete the entry
 
✓ Display the Insert Function dialog box
 
The Cancel and Complete Function buttons appear only when you enter a 
formula, a function, or just plain old values in the Formula Bar. If you type the 
entry into a cell, the Cancel and Complete Function buttons do not appear.

51
 Chapter 2: Saving Time with Function Tools
Entering formulas and functions 
directly in worksheet cells
Perhaps the easiest entry method is typing the formula directly in a cell. Just 
type formulas that contain no functions and press the Enter key to complete 
the entry. Try this simple example:
 
1. Click a cell where the formula is to be entered.
 
2. Enter this simple math-based formula: =6 + (9/5) *100.
 
3. Press the Enter key.
 
 The answer is 186. (Don’t forget the order of operators; see Chapter 4 
for more information about the order of mathematical operators.)
Excel makes entering functions into your formulas as easy as a click. As you 
type the first letter of a function into a cell, immediately a list of functions 
starting with that letter is listed. See Figure 2-14.
 
Figure 2-14: 
Entering 
functions 
has never 
been this 
easy.
 
The desired function in this example is MIN, which returns the minimum 
value from a group of values. As soon as we type M (first enter the equal sign 
if this is the start of a formula entry), the list in Figure 2-14 appears, show-
ing all the M functions. Now that an option exists, either keep typing the full 
function name, or scroll to MIN and press the Tab button. Figure 2-15 shows 
just what happens when we do the latter: MIN is completed and provides the 
required syntax structure — not much thinking involved! Now your brain can 
concentrate on more interesting things, such as poker odds. (Will Microsoft 

52
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
ever create a function category for calculating poker odds? Please?) In Figure 
2-15 the MIN function is used to find the minimum value in the range A7:A15. 
Entering the closing parenthesis and then pressing the Enter key completes 
the function. In this example the answer is 1222.
A1: 15
A2: 32
A7: 38
A8: 39
A9: 28
A10: 26
A11: 29
A12: 30
A13: 30
A14: 28
A15: 31
The formula in D5 is +(A1+A2) * MIN(A7:A15)This results in 1222 not 21.
 
Excel’s ability to show a list of functions based on spelling is called Formula 
AutoComplete.

formula

You can turn Formula AutoComplete on or off in the Excel Options dialog box:
 
1. Click the Microsoft Office button at the top left of the screen.
 
2. Click Excel Options.
 
3. In the Excel Options dialog box, select the Formulas tab.

53

4. In the Working with Formulas section, check or uncheck the Formula 
AutoComplete check box.
 
 See Figure 2-16 for the check box’s placement.

Saying “Array!” for Formulas 
and Functions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding arrays
▶ Creating formulas that use arrays
▶ Using functions that return arrays of data
E
xcel is really quite sophisticated — its many built-in functions make your 
work easier. On top of that, Excel allows you to tell functions to work 
on entire sets of values, called arrays, which makes for even more clever 
analysis.
An array is a set of two or more values (for example, the contents of two 
or more worksheet cells, or even the contents of two or more worksheet 
ranges). Certain functions use arrays for arguments.
You may be thinking “Hey, how is this different from just entering a bunch 
of arguments?” You’re right in the comparison. For example, the SUM func-
tion can take up to 255 arguments. Isn’t this the same as giving the function 
an array with 255 values? Well, yes and no. It’s the same idea, but using the 
array approach can streamline your work, as you soon see.
There is even another side to array functions. Some of the functions return an 
array. Yes, that’s right. Most of the time a function returns a single value into 
a single cell. In this chapter, we show you how a function returns a group of 
values into multiple cells.
Discovering Arrays
An array is like a box. It can hold a number of items. In Excel, an array holds 
a collection of values or cell references. These arrays are used exclusively in 
formulas and functions. That is, the association of some values as one cohe-
sive group exists just for the purpose of calculating results. An array differs 

56
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
from the named areas (a range of cells) that you can create in Excel. Named 
areas become part of the worksheet and can be referenced at any time.
Named areas are set using the New Name dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1. In 
contrast, there is no such dialog box or method to create arrays that can be 
referenced from functions or formulas. Arrays, instead, are embedded in 
formulas.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Creating a 
named area 
with the 
New Name 
dialog box.
 
Named areas are easily referenced in formulas. For example, if a workbook 
contains a named area Sales, then the values of all the cells in Sales can be 
summed up like this:
=SUM(Sales)
Assume that Sales contains three cells with these values — 10, 15, and 20. 
These values of course can be directly entered in the SUM function like this:
=SUM(10,15,20)
This is almost an array, but not quite. Excel recognizes a group of values 
to be an array when they are enclosed with braces ({ and }). Therefore, to 
enter the array of values into the function, the entry looks like this:
=SUM({10,15,20})
Essentially the braces tell Excel to treat the group of values as an array. So 
far, you may be wondering about the usefulness of an array, but in the next 
section, we show you how using arrays with standard functions such as SUM 
can provide sophisticated results.
 
To enter values as an array within a function, enclose them with braces. 
Braces have a curly look to them, not to be confused with brackets. On a typi-
cal keyboard braces and brackets are on the same key. Holding the Shift key 
while pressing the brace/bracket key provides the brace.

57
 Chapter 3: Saying “Array!” for Formulas and Functions
However, getting the braces into the formula takes a particular keystroke. 
You don’t type braces in directly.
Using Arrays in Formulas
You can use arrays when entering formulas and functions. Typically, the 
arguments to a function are entered in a different manner, which we dem-
onstrate in this section. Using arrays can save entry steps and deliver an 
answer in a single formula. This is useful in situations that normally require a 
set of intermediate calculations from which the final result is calculated. We 
don’t know about you, but we like shortcuts, especially when we have too 
much to do!
Here’s an example: The SUM function is normally used to add a few numbers 
together. Summing up a few numbers doesn’t require an array formula per 
se, but what about summing up the results of other calculations? This next 
example shows how using an array simplifies getting to the final result.
Figure 3-2 shows a small portfolio of stocks. Column A has the stock symbols, 
Column B has the number of shares per stock, and Column C has a recent 
price for each stock.
 
Figure 3-2: 
A stock 
portfolio.
 
The task is to find out the total value of the portfolio. The typical way to do 
this is to
 
1. Multiply the number of shares for each stock by its price.
 
2. Sum up the results from Step 1.

58
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Figure 3-3 shows a very common way to do this. Column D contains formulas 
to calculate the value of each stock in the portfolio. This is done by multiply-
ing the number of shares for each stock by its price. For example, cell D4 
contains the formula =B4*C4. Cell D10 sums up the interim results with the 
formula =SUM(D4:D8).
 
Figure 3-3: 
Calculating 
the value 
of a stock 
portfolio, 
the old-
fashioned 
way.
 
The method shown in Figure 3-3 requires creating additional calculations — 
those in Column D. These calculations are necessary if you need to know the 
value of each stock, but not if all you need to know is the value of the portfo-
lio as a whole.
Fortunately, alternatives to this standard approach exist. One is to embed 
the separate multiplicative steps directly inside the SUM function, like this:
=SUM(B4*C4,B5*C5,B6*C6,B7*C7,B8*C8)
That works, but it’s bloated to say the least. What if you had 20 stocks in the 
portfolio? Forget it!
Another alternative is the SUMPRODUCT function. This function sums the 
products, just as the other methods shown here also do. The limitation, 
however, is that SUMPRODUCT can only be used for summing. It cannot, for 
example, give you an average.
In many situations such as this one, your best bet is to use an array function. 
Figure 3-4 shows the correct result from using the SUM function entered as 
an array function. Notice that the formula in the Formula Bar begins and ends 
with a brace.

59
 Chapter 3: Saying “Array!” for Formulas and Functions
 
Figure 3-4: 
Calculating 
the value of 
a stock port-
folio using 
an array 
function.
 
The syntax is important. Two ranges are entered into the function: One con-
tains the cells that hold the number of shares, and the other contains the 
cells that have the stock prices. These are multiplied in the function by enter-
ing the multiplication operator (*):
{=SUM(B4:B8*C4:C8)}
Ctrl + Shift + Enter had been pressed to turn the whole thing into an array 
function. That special keystroke combination is done when finishing the 
formula and not before. Note the lack of subtotals (per stock) in cells D4:D8. 
Compare Figure 3-4 with Figure 3-3 and you can see the difference.
 
Use Ctrl + Shift + Enter to turn a formula into an array formula. You must use 
the key combination after entering the formula instead of pressing the Enter 
key. The key combination takes the place of the press of the Enter key.
Here’s how you use an array with the SUM function:
 
1. Enter two columns of values.
 
 The two lists must be the same size.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =SUM( to start the function.
 
 Note how a brace has not been entered in this step.
 
4. Click the first cell in the first list and while holding the left mouse 
button down; drag the pointer over the first list. Then release the 
mouse button.
 
5. Enter the multiplication sign (*).

60
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
6. Click the first cell of the second list, hold down the left mouse button, 
and drag the pointer over the second list.
 
7. Release the mouse button.
 
8. Enter a ).
 
9. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to end the function.
 
 Do not just press the Enter key by itself when using an array with the 
SUM function.
Array functions are useful for saving steps in mathematical operations. 
Therefore you can apply these examples to a number of functions, such as 
AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and so on.
As another example, suppose you run a fleet of taxis and you need to calcu-
late the average cost of gasoline per mile driven. This is easy to calculate for 
a single vehicle. You just divide the total spent on gasoline by the total miles 
driven, for a given period of time. The calculation looks like this:
cost of gasoline per mile = total spent on gasoline ÷ 
total miles driven
How can you easily calculate this for a fleet of vehicles? Figure 3-5 shows 
how this is done. The vehicles are listed in Column A, the total miles driven 
for the month appear in Column B, and the total amounts spent on gasoline 
appear in Column C.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Making 
an easy 
calculation 
using an 
array 
formula.
 

61
 Chapter 3: Saying “Array!” for Formulas and Functions
One single formula in cell C21 answers the question. By using the AVERAGE 
function in an array formula, the result is returned without the need for any 
intermediate calculations. The formula looks like this: {=AVERAGE(C6:C17/
B6:B17)}.
Working with Functions 
That Return Arrays
A few functions actually return arrays of data. Instead of providing a single 
result, as most functions do, these functions return several values. The 
number of actual returned values is directly related to the function’s argu-
ments. The returned values go into a range of cells.
 
Excel array functions accept arrays as arguments and possibly return arrays 
of data.
A good example of this is the TRANSPOSE function. This interesting function 
is used to reorient data. Data situated a given way in columns and rows is 
transposed (changed to be presented instead in rows and columns). Figure 3-6 
shows how this works.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Transposing 
data.
 
Cells B3 through D10 contain information about departments in a company. 
Departments are listed going down Column B. Note that the area of B3 through 
D10 specifically occupies three columns and eight rows. The header row is 
included in the area.

62
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
Cells B16 through I18 contain the transposed data. It is the same data, but 
now it occupies eight columns and three rows. In total number of cells, this is 
the same size as the original area. Just as important is that the area is made 
up of the same dimensions, just reversed. That is, a 3-by-8 area became an 
8-by-3 area. The number of cells remains at 24. However the transposed area 
has not been altered to be 6 by 3 or 2 by 12, or any other two dimensions that 
cover 24 cells.
Every single cell in the B16:I18 range contains the same formula: 
{=TRANSPOSE(B3:D10)}. However, the function was entered only once.
In detail, here is how you can use the TRANSPOSE function:
 
1. Enter some data that occupies at least two adjacent cells.
 
 Creating an area of data that spans multiple rows and columns is best 
for seeing how useful the function is.
 
2. Elsewhere on the worksheet, select an area that covers the same 
number of cells but has the length of the sides of the original area 
reversed.
 
 For example:
 
• If the original area is two columns and six rows, then select an area 
that is six columns and two rows.
 
• If the original area is one column and two rows, then select an area 
that is two columns and one row.
 
• If the original area is 200 columns and 201 rows, then select an 
area that is 201 columns and 200 rows.
 
• If the original area is five columns and five rows, then select an 
area that is five columns and five rows. (A square area is trans-
posed into a square area.)
 
 Figure 3-7 shows an area of data and a selected area ready to receive the 
transposed data. The original data area occupies 11 columns and 3 rows. 
The selected area is 3 columns by 11 rows.
 
3. Enter =TRANSPOSE( to start the function.
 
4. Click the first cell in the original data and drag the pointer over the 
entire original data area while keeping the mouse button down. Once 
the area is selected, release the mouse button.
 
 The function now shows the range of the original area. Figure 3-8 shows 
how the entry should appear at this step.
 
5. Enter a ).
 
6. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to end the function.

data.
 
 
Figure 3-8: 
Completing 
the function.
 
Note: The transposed data does not take on the formatting of the original 
area. You need to format the area as needed. Figure 3-9 shows the result of 
using TRANSPOSE and then formatting the transposed data.
Wait! Isn’t this a waste of time? Excel can easily transpose data using the 
Paste Special dialog box. Simply copying a range of data and using this dialog 
box to paste the data gives the same result as the TRANSPOSE function. Or 
does it?
Figure 3-10 shows the Paste Special dialog box with the Transpose check box 
checked. This will transpose the data. You don’t even have to select the cor-
rect number of rows and columns where the transposed data will land. It just 
appears transposed, with the active cell as the corner of the area.

64
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
Figure 3-9: 
Transposed 
data after 
formatting.
 
However, when data is transposed with the Paste Special dialog box, the 
actual data is copied to the new area. By contrast the TRANSPOSE function 
pastes a formula that references the original data — and that is the key point. 
When data is changed in the original area, the change is reflected in the new, 
transposed area, if the TRANSPOSE function was used.
 
You can transpose data in two ways. The area filled with the TRANSPOSE func-
tion references the original data and will update as original data is changed. 
Using the Paste Special dialog box to transpose data creates values that do 
not update when the original data changes.

Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
In This Chapter
▶ Preventing errors with Excel
▶ Following the flow of cell and range references to and from formulas
▶ Using Excel’s array of tools to uncover and correct formulas
E
xcel would be nothing if it didn’t allow you to create formulas. Creating 
formulas is, after all, the real purpose of a worksheet — to allow you to 
build a solution that pertains to your specific needs. Without formulas, Excel 
would be no more than a place to store information. Boring!
Excel allows formulas to have up to 8,192 characters in length. This means 
you can create some monster formulas! Formulas can reference cells that 
have formulas that reference other cells that have formulas that reference . . . 
well, you get the idea!
Ah, but this comes with a price — how can you track down errors in long for-
mulas? How can you avoid them in the first place? In this chapter, we explain 
how Excel steers you away from entering problematic formulas, and how to 
correct completed formulas that are not working in the way you intended.
Catching Errors as You Enter Them
Excel is keeping an eye on you when you enter formulas. Don’t be worried! This 
is a good thing. You aren’t being graded. Excel is helping you, not testing you.
All formulas start with an equal sign. When you complete an entry by press-
ing Enter or Tab (or clicking into another cell), Excel scans the entry. If the 
entry did indeed start with an equal sign, then Excel immediately looks for 
three major problems:

66
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
✓ Do the number of open and closed parentheses match?
 
✓ Does the formula reference the same cell it is entered in? For example 
what if cell A1 has this formula: =A1*5. This is called a circular reference. 
This is a bit like a dog chasing its tail.
 
✓ Does the formula refer to a nonexistent reference?
Each of the problems is handled differently. Excel will offer a fix for mis-
matched parentheses but will only warn you about formulas that reference 
the cell they are entered in. For nonexistent references, Excel will ask you 
where to find them. Excel will display an Open File type of dialog box that 
you use to browse to the reference, assuming the reference is meant to come 
from an external workbook. If a reference to an external workbook was not 
the intention, then the dialog box won’t make sense. In this case, dismiss the 
dialog box and edit the formula.
Getting parentheses to match
In a mathematical formula, each open parenthesis must have a matching 
closing parenthesis. Excel checks your formulas to make sure they comply. 
Figure 4-1 shows a simple business calculation that requires parentheses to 
make sense. The result is based on multiplying units by price per unit, adding 
an additional purchase amount to that, then applying a discount, and finally 
applying tax.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Using 
parentheses 
in a formula.
 
In math terms here is how the formula works:
(units sold × price per unit + additional cost) × discount × (1 + tax rate)

67
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
The placement of the parentheses is critical to making the formula work. 
Excel won’t sense a problem if any particular parenthesis is in the wrong 
place as long as there is a matching number of open and closed parentheses. 
For example, using the cells and values from Figure 4-1, here are some possi-
bilities of valid formulas that return incorrect answers:
Formula
Result
=B3*(B4+B6) * B8 * (1 + B9)
5626.84
=B3*B4+(B6 * B8) * (1 + B9)
549.13
=(B3*B4+B6 * B8) * (1 + B9)
589.96
=(B3*B4+B6) * (B8 * 1 + B9)
299.15
 
Correct parentheses placement and a firm understanding of mathematical-
operator precedence are critical to calculating correct answers. We suggest 
a brush up on these basic math concepts if you aren’t sure how to construct 
your formulas. See Chapter 18 for more.
 
There is a great mnemonic for orders of operation: Please excuse my dear 
Aunt Sally. That is meant to help remember: parentheses, exponents, multi-
plication, division, addition, subtraction. By the way, I had to excuse my dear 
Aunt Honey for undercooking the stuffing one year at Thanksgiving. Great 
meal, and then we all got sick!
What if, during entry, a parenthesis is left out? When you try to complete 
the entry, Excel will pop up a warning and a suggestion. In this example, the 
first closed parenthesis is purposely left out. Here is the incorrect formula: 
=(B3*B4+B6*B8*(1+B9).
Figure 4-2 shows how Excel catches the error and offers a solution.
Don’t be hasty! The correction proposed by Excel will correct the mis-
matched parentheses but will not create the correct formula. Look 
closely at the following example of a proposed correction by Excel: 
=(B3*B4+B6*B8*(1+B9)).
But what you really need is this: =(B3*B4+B6)*B8*(1+B9).
Excel simply added the missing parenthesis to the end of the formula. A good 
idea, but not good enough. If the proposed correction were accepted, a result 
of $549.13 would be returned in this example. The correct answer is $268.46. 
In this case, you should reject the proposal and fix the formula yourself.
 
Do not assume Excel’s proposed formula corrections are right for you. 
Carefully review the proposed correction and accept or reject accordingly.

Avoiding circular references
A circular reference occurs when a cell refers to itself, whether directly or 
indirectly. For example, if =100 + A2 is entered into cell A2, then a direct 
circular reference has been created. An indirect circular reference is when 
the formula in a given cell refers to one or more other cells that in return 
refer back to the original cell. For example a formula in A1 refers to cell A2, 
A2 refers to A3, and A3 refers back to A1.
Figure 4-3 shows a worksheet that has a direct circular reference. Cell D10 is 
meant to sum the values above it but mistakenly includes itself in the sum: 
=SUM(D4:D10). Excel reports the problem in the message box shown in 
Figure 4-3.
 
If Automatic Calculation is turned off, then the circular reference is unno-
ticed until a manual calc is done (by pressing F9) or the setting is changed to 
Automatic Calculation.
When the dialog box in Figure 4-3 appears, you have a few choices:
 
✓ Clicking OK takes you to the Help system Circular Reference topic.
 
✓ Clicking Cancel accepts the formula as is, which is not likely what you 
meant to do.
Figure 4-4 shows the Formulas tab in the Excel Options dialog box. Here is 
where the calculation setting — automatic or manual — is set. Note that the 
Iteration check box is here as well. When this is set, circular references are 
allowed. How they calculate values in this case is dependent on the Maximum 
Iterations and Maximum Change settings.

69
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos

Checking and applying iterations on the Calculation tab of the Options dialog 
box allows you to use circular references in your formulas, useful for certain 
advanced calculations that are beyond the scope of this book. (See Excel Help 
for more information.)
Excel 2010 has an approach to hunting down circular references. The 
Formulas tab on the Ribbon has a section named Formula Auditing. In this 
section is an Error Checking drop-down list that shows any circular refer-
ences. See Figure 4-5.

The drop-down will list circular references, and clicking on one will take you to 
the listed cell with the circular reference. This allows you to get to them easily 
instead of having to review all your formulas. Hey, now that’s a timesaver!
Mending broken links
Formulas can reference external workbooks. As an example, a formula 
could be written like this: =’C:\Inventory\[Inventory.xls]Engine 
Parts’!$D$8. The formula uses the value found in the external workbook 
Inventory.xls. What if the workbook is not found?
Links become broken when external workbooks have been moved, deleted, 
or renamed. When a workbook that contains an external reference is opened 
but cannot find the other workbook(s) referenced in one or more formulas, 
then a warning message appears. Figure 4-6 shows the message that pops up 
when a link is broken.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Deciding 
what to 
do when 
formulas 
reference 
unfound 
external 
workbooks.
 
You have two choices when the error message appears:
 
✓ Click the Continue button. The cells that contain formulas that refer-
ence external workbooks just present results calculated with the last 
known values found in the external workbooks from previous sessions.
 
✓ Click the Edit Links button. This action displays the Edit Links dialog 
box shown in Figure 4-7. This dialog box offers a number of choices for 
handling the broken links.

71
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
 
Figure 4-7: 
Using the 
Edit Links 
dialog box 
to correct 
external 
reference 
problems.
 
The Edit Links dialog box gives you options on how to handle broken links. 
The buttons along the right side of the dialog box work like this:
 
✓ Update Values: When external workbooks are where they should be, 
this action gets the values from the external workbooks, and the cells 
with those formulas are recalculated. When there are broken links, an 
Open File type of dialog box appears from which you browse to a file 
from which to get the values. This does not necessarily have to be the 
missing workbook — it could be another workbook. A point to be aware 
of is that using Update Values in this manner does not fix the link. It 
helps you get values but does not change the way formulas are written. 
Instead, use the Change Source option, listed next.
 
✓ Change Source: This option displays an Open File type of dialog box 
that lets you select an external workbook to use. Selecting a workbook 
in this dialog box actually alters the formula that references the external 
workbook. So, this is the best course to take to permanently fix a broken 
link.
 
✓ Open Source: In the case of broken links, this action does nothing 
because the source (the external workbook) cannot be found. An error 
message will confirm this. In the case of working links, this action opens 
the workbook referenced in the link.
 
✓ Break Link: This action converts formulas that contain external links 
to the calculated values. In other words, the cells that contain formulas 
with external links are replaced with a value; the formulas are removed. 
Make sure this is what you want to do. You cannot undo this action, and 
it can be a serious mistake if you did this unintentionally. Excel displays 
a confirmation of this, shown in Figure 4-8.
 
✓ Check Status: Provides status about links. A number of values are pos-
sible (such as OK, Unknown, Error: Source not found, Error: Worksheet 
not found, and so on). In the Edit Links dialog box (refer to Figure 4-7), 
Status is a column in the middle of the dialog box. Each link receives its 
own status.

72
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
Figure 4-8:

that you 
mean to 
break links. 
The Edit Links dialog box shown in Figure 4-7 also has the StartUp Prompt 
button in the lower left. Clicking this button leads to a choice of what the 
workbook should do when opened and there are no external links. The 
choices are:
 
✓ Let users choose whether to display the alert or not.
 
✓ Don’t display the alert and don’t update automatic links.
 
✓ Don’t display the alert and update links.
Using the Formula Error Checker
Some errors are immediately apparent, such as mismatched parentheses 
explained earlier. Other types of entries are not blatant errors but instead 
resemble errors. In this case, Excel alerts you to the possible problem and 
lets you choose how to handle it.
Figure 4-9 shows a few numbers and a sum at the bottom. The formula in cell 
B10 is =SUM(B4:B9). There is nothing wrong here, no possible error yet.
Note that in Figure 4-9 the headings row is not adjacent to the rows of infor-
mation. Rows 2 and 3 are in between the headings and the data. This is not 
unusual, because this leads to a clean-looking report.
However, watch what happens if a value is accidentally entered into the area 
between the headings and the data. The formula in cell B10 calculates values 
starting in Row 4. When a value is entered in cell B3, Excel alerts you that 
there may be an error. You can see this in Figure 4-10. A small triangle is now 
visible in the upper-left corner of cell B10 — the cell with the formula.
Clicking back into cell B10, and moving the pointer over the triangle, causes 
a small symbol with an exclamation point to appear. Clicking the symbol dis-
plays a list of choices, shown in Figure 4-11.
 
An error is represented by a triangle in the upper-left corner of a cell. This is 
different from a smart tag, which is seen as a triangle in the lower-right corner 
of a cell. Smart tags lead to helpful options based on the contents of the cell. 
See the Excel Help system for more information on Smart Tags.

The first item in the list is just a statement of the problem. In this example, 
the statement is “Formula Omits Adjacent Cells.” Sure enough, it does just 
that! But is it an error? Did you mean to enter the extra value in cell B3? 
Perhaps it has some other meaning or use.

74
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
The other items in the list give you options for what to do:
 
✓ Update Formula to Include Cells: Automatically changes the formula to 
include the extra cell in this example. So the formula in cell B10 changes 
from =SUM(B4:B9) to =SUM(B3:B9). And, of course, the calculated 
sum will change as well.
 
✓ Help on This Error: Steers you to Excel’s Help system.
 
✓ Ignore Error: Removes the list and returns you to the worksheet. The 
triangle is removed from the cell in question. You’ve told Excel that you 
know what you’re doing and you want Excel to butt out. Good job!
 
✓ Edit in Formula Bar: The cursor is placed in the Formula Bar so you can 
easily edit the formula.
 
✓ Error Checking Options: Displays the Error Checking tab from the

tab, you set options on how Excel handles errors.

Auditing Formulas
With Excel, you can create some fairly complex solutions. A cell can contain 
a formula that uses values from multitudes of other cells and ranges. Working 
through long, complex formulas to track down problems can be quite 
tedious. The good news is that Excel has a way to help!

75
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
Formulas may contain precedents and may serve as dependents to other 
formulas:
 
✓ Precedents are cells or ranges that affect the active cell’s value.
 
✓ Dependents are cells or ranges affected by the active cell.
It’s all relative! A cell often serves as both a precedent and a dependent. 
Figure 4-13 shows a simple worksheet with some values and some calcula-
tions. Cell B9 contains the formula =SUM(B3:B8). Cell F9 contains the for-
mula =SUM(F3:F8). Cell B18 contains the formula =B9-F9.
 
✓ Cells B3:B8 are precedents of B9, but at the same time cell B9 is depen-
dent on all the cells in B3:B8.
 
✓ Cells F3:F8 are precedents of F9, but at the same time cell F9 is depen-
dent on all the cells in F3:F8.
 
✓ Cells B9 and F9 are precedents of B18, but at the same time cell B18 is 
dependent on cells B9 and F9.
 
Figure 4-13: 
Under-
standing 
precedents 
and 
dependents.
 
To help follow and fix formulas, Excel provides formula auditing tools. The 
Ribbon’s Formula Auditing section of the Formulas tab has three buttons that 
let you use formula auditing. Figure 4-14 shows the worksheet from Figure 4-13 
with visible precedent and dependent lines. The methods for displaying these 
lines are shown in the Ribbon.
Precedent and Dependent lines are always inserted from or to the active cell. 
From the active cell:

76
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
✓ To see what other cells are referenced in the active cell’s formula, click 
the Trace Precedents button.
 
✓ To see which other cells contain a reference to the active cell, click the 
Trace Dependents button.
The Remove Arrows drop-down has three choices:
 
✓ Remove Arrows
 
✓ Remove Precedent Arrows
 
✓ Remove Dependent Arrows
 
Figure 4-14: 
Tracing 
formulas.
 
In Figure 4-14, cells B9 and F9 have arrows that originate in the cells above. 
This shows the flow of precedents into the given cells. The arrow head rests in 
the cell that has the formula that contains the references of the precedents.
On the other hand, cells B9 and F9 themselves then have lines coming from 
them and ending as arrow heads in cell B18. Therefore, B9 and F9 serve as 
precedents to cell B18. Or, said another way, cell B18 is dependent on cells 
B9 and F9.
 
Double-clicking a tracer arrow activates the cell on one end of the line. Double-
clicking again activates the cell on the other end.
Tracing precedents and dependents can lead to some interesting conclusions 
about a worksheet. Complex formulas can be difficult to follow, but by dis-
playing tracer arrows, you can better see what is going on. Figure 4-15 shows 
a piece of a worksheet used in a comprehensive financial solution. The active 
cell, H2, has a complex formula in it, as you can see by looking at the Formula 
Bar. The tracer arrows show that numerous precedents are feeding the for-
mula in the active cell.

77
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
When a cell references a cell on a different worksheet, an icon that looks like 
a worksheet appears at the end of the precedent line. This serves as a visual 
clue that the formula is comprised of values from more than the current 
worksheet.
 
Figure 4-15: 
Examining 
the com-
ponents of 
a complex 
formula.
 
The tracer arrows make it easy to see the values that are feeding the for-
mula and, therefore, make it easier to look for the source of a problem. For 
example, cell H2 may be returning a negative number as an answer. The 
formula adds certain values together. Positive numbers added with a nega-
tive number may return a negative number as the result of the calculation. 
Therefore, just looking for a negative number among the values at the end of 
the tracer arrows may help identify the problem, perhaps within just a few 
seconds!
Watching the Watch Window
The Watch Window lets you watch the calculated results of a formula but 
without the limitation of having the cell be in the viewing area of Excel. This 
feature is helpful when you’re working on correcting formulas that use prec-
edents that are scattered about the worksheet or workbook.
First, to set up a watch, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Watch Window button on the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
 
2. In the Watch Window, click the Add Watch button.
 
 The Add Watch dialog box opens.

78
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
3. Use the RefEdit control (the square button to the right of the entry 
box) to specify the cell(s), or type in the cell address or range.
 
4. Click the Add button in the Add Watch dialog box to complete setting 
up the watch.
Figure 4-16 shows the Watch Window with a watch already in place. Cell C6 
on the Costs worksheet is being watched. The formula uses precedents from 
both the Orders and Shipping worksheets. The Watch Window sits on top of 
the workbook and stays visible regardless of which worksheet is active. This 
means, for example, that you could try different values on the Orders work-
sheet and see the result in the calculation in Costs!C6, but without having to 
bounce around the worksheets to see how new values alter the calculated 
result.
 
Figure 4-16: 
Using the

The Watch Window also lets you delete a watch. That’s a good thing; oth-
erwise you would end up with a bunch of watches you no longer need! To 
delete a watch, perform these steps:
 
1. Select a watch from the list of watches in the Watch Window.
 
2. Click the Delete Watch window.
Evaluating and Checking Errors
The Evaluate Formula dialog box walks you through the sequential steps 
used in calculating a result from a formula. These steps are useful in tracking 
down errors in formulas that are long, or have precedents. For example, the 
formula =IF(MAX(Orders!B2:B29)>200,MAX(Orders!B2:B29)*Shipping! 
C22,Shipping!C24) refers to different worksheets. Using the Evaluate 
Formula dialog box makes it easy to see how this formula is worked out by 
Excel. The step-by-step approach lets you see what is done at each step.

79
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
Figure 4-17 shows the Evaluate Formula dialog box at the start of evaluating the 
formula. To display the Evaluate Formula dialog box, simply click the Evaluate 
Formula button on the Ribbon. With each successive click on the Evaluate 
button, the Evaluation box displays the interim results. The Step In and Step 
Out buttons are enabled during the steps that work on the precedents.
 
Figure 4-17: 
Evaluating a 
formula.
 
The Evaluate Formula dialog box is great for really seeing how each little step 
feeds into the final calculated result. Using this dialog box lets you pinpoint 
exactly where a complex formula has gone sour.
A similar error-hunting tool is the Error Checking dialog box. (Excel really 
wants to help you!) Figure 4-18 shows the dialog box.
 
Figure 4-18: 
Checking 
the cause of 
an error.
 
Display the Check Error dialog box by clicking the Error Checking selection 
in the Error Checking drop-down menu on the Ribbon (on the Formulas tab, 
of course).
The dialog box has a handful of buttons that let you analyze the error and 
make decisions about it:
 
✓ Help on this error starts the Excel Help system.
 
✓ Show Calculation Steps opens the Evaluate Formula dialog box.

80
Part I: Putting the Fun in Functions 
 
✓ Ignore Error ensures that Excel no longer cares about the error. The cell 
may still display an error symbol, but Excel does not give a hoot, and 
probably you won’t either, since you clicked the button.
 
✓ Edit in Formula Bar places the cursor in the Formula Bar, making it easy 
for you to edit the formula.
 
✓ Options opens the Excel Options dialog box.
 
✓ Previous and Next cycle through the multiple errors on the worksheet, 
assuming there is more than one error.
 
The Error Checking drop-down hosts the Trace Error command. Only prec-
edents are pointed out by the tracer lines. This makes it easy to see the cells 
that feed into a cell that has an error.
Making an Error Behave 
the Way You Want
Excel has a neat function: IfError. Don’t confuse it with IsError, which is 
similar but not as slick. Figure 4-19 shows how IfError one-ups IsError. In the 
figure, F7 has the dreaded Divide by Zero error. It’s not a pretty thing to see, 
and I am sure the boss would appreciate a cleaner visual to work with.
 
Figure 4-19: 
Two ways to 
prevent an 
error from 
being seen.
 
Cell H7 has the tried-and-true way to make the error not look like an error. 
Using the IsError function nested inside an If function takes care of the 
error’s appearance, as seen in cell H7 (which refers to cell F7). Cell H8 
achieves the same result with the new IfError function. Cells J7 and J8, 
respectively, show the formulas that are in cells H7 and H8.

81
 Chapter 4: Fixing Formula Boo-Boos
 
✓ In cell H7 is =IF(ISERROR(F7),0,F7+3)
 
✓ In cell H8 is =IFERROR(F7+3,0)
The main distinction is that IfError, as a single function, does what used 
to take two functions. I don’t know how many times the “keep it simple” 
approach has been bantered around, but what the heck — we’re all for 
making our work easier. With IfError, the first argument is being tested. If the 
test makes sense, Excel goes with it. Otherwise, the second argument is used.
 
IfError can return a message. For example, consider this: 
=IFERROR(F7+3,”Somebody Goofed!”).

re you a money-minded person? We have just the

depreciation, and internal rates of return. Chapter 5 
explains how Excel works with and formats monetary val-
ues. Did you know that Excel is so smart it can work with 
your local currency? 
Keeping tabs on loans has never been easier. Heck, you 
can even figure whether a loan is worth it in the first 
place! Chapter 6 takes this up a notch to demonstrate 
advanced financial functions that calculate depreciation 
and internal rates of returns — the kind of stuff you would 
think to ask an accountant about. Only now you can figure 
it out yourself.
Chapters 7 and 8 round this part out with a one-two 
punch of math functions, from the simple SUM to the

Chapter 5
Calculating Loan Payments 
and Interest Rates
In This Chapter
▶ Formatting monetary values
▶ Estimating loan payments
▶ Determining the number of payments
▶ Calculating interest
▶ Calculating the principal loan amount
A
 penny saved is a penny earned. A penny by itself is not much. But add 
a little savings here and there over the life of a loan, and the sum could 
be significant! Just think of what you can do with the extra money — extend a 
vacation, give it to charity, or save it for a rainy day.
Taking out a car loan, a mortgage, or another type of loan involves planning 
how you want to manage the loan payments. In the simplest terms, all you 
may need to know is the amount of your monthly payment. But knowing the 
components of a loan and being able to compare one loan with another can 
help you to manage your financial resources in your own best interest.
Consider an auto loan, one of the most common loan types. The factors 
involved include the cost of the vehicle, the down payment, the length of the 
loan, and the interest rate. Excel can help you see how all these factors affect 
your bottom line, letting you make the best decision (we would love to get 
the Ferraris, but the Hyundais will have to do).
You can use the financial functions in Excel to crunch the numbers for your 
loans. You supply these functions with the relevant numbers: the principal 
amount, the interest rate, the period (how often you make a payment), and 
the length of the loan. Then, the functions return an answer such as your 
payment amount. In this chapter, we show you how to use these functions to 
turn your finance figures into meaningful results.

86
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
The principal is the amount being borrowed. The interest rate is the annual 
percentage that the lender charges for lending the money. Your total pay-
ments will equal the principal plus the sum of all interest charges.
Understanding How Excel 
Handles Money
Excel is a lot more than a simple adding machine. It has great tools for work-
ing with money values and a number of ways of presenting the amounts. 
For example, Excel makes it easy for you to make sure that your financial 
amounts are displayed with two decimal points. You can even work with dif-
ferent currencies from around the world.
Going with the cash flow
Excel works with money on a cash flow basis. In other words, money 
amounts are treated either as a cash flow in (money you receive) or a cash 
flow out (money you pay out). Yes, we know, there always seems to be too 
many of the latter and not enough of the former — but hey, you can’t blame 
Excel for that!
Excel represents cash flows in as positive numbers and cash flows out as 
negative numbers. For example, when you calculate the payments on a loan, 
the situation is as follows:
 
✓ The amount of the loan is entered as a positive value because this is the 
money you’ll receive from the bank or whoever is giving you the loan.
 
✓ The monthly payment that Excel calculates is a negative value because 
this is money that you’ll be paying out.
Formatting for currency
One of Excel’s shining strengths is accepting, manipulating, and reporting on 
monetary data. As such, Excel provides robust formatting for numeric data, 
including the ability to control the placement of commas and decimals, and 
even how to format negative values.

87
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
People are used to seeing money amounts formatted with a currency symbol 
and a certain number of decimal places. In the United States and Canada, that 
is the dollar sign and two decimal places. Let’s face it — $199.95 looks like 
money, but 199.950 does not. Excel makes formatting cells to display money 
amounts as easy as clicking a button. To format amounts as dollars, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells you want to format.
 
2. Click the Dollar ($) button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, in the Number 
group.
This technique assigns Excel’s default Accounting format to the selected 
cells. In the United States, the default currency format follows:
 
✓ A dollar sign, aligned to the left of the cell
 
✓ Two decimal places
 
✓ Negative numbers enclosed in parentheses
The default format depends on your locale, which is a setting of the operat-
ing system. If you’re in Italy, for example, the locale should be set so that the 
default currency format is the euro (€).
But suppose you don’t want the default currency formatting. Perhaps you’re 
in the United States and working on a spreadsheet for the London office. You 
can specify the currency symbol, the number of decimal places, and how 
negative values are shown by following these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells you want to format.
 
2. Right-click the cell(s) and choose Format Cells from the drop-down 
menu.
 
3. In the Format Cells dialog box, select the Number tab, as shown in 
Figure 5-1.
 
4. Click Currency in the Category list.
 
5. Select the desired number of decimal places from the Decimal Places 
drop-down list.
 
6. Select the desired currency symbol from the Symbol drop-down list.
 
7. Select the desired format for negative numbers from the Negative 
Numbers list.
 
8. Click OK to apply the formatting.

88
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
Figure 5-1: 
Using the 
Format Cells 
dialog box 
to control 
numeric 
display.
 
 
The Currency and Accounting formats are similar to each other, except for 
a couple of key points. Currency provides choices for displaying negative 
values; Accounting uses one fixed display with parentheses. Currency places 
the currency symbol next to the number; Accounting places the currency 
symbol at the left of the cell.
Choosing separators
When numbers are formatted as currency, two separator symbols are typi-
cally used — one to separate thousands and the other to separate the deci-
mal part of the value. In the United States, commas are used for thousands 
and the period for the decimal:
$12,345.67
Other countries have different ways of doing this. In many European coun-
tries, for example, the period is used to separate thousands, and the comma 
is used for the decimal. In addition, the currency symbol is often at the end of 
the number. An amount in euros, for example, may be formatted as follows:
12.345,67€

89
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
In almost all situations, the operating system’s locale settings result in the 
proper separators being used automatically. If you need to change the sepa-
rators from the defaults, do so in the Regional and Language Options in the 
Windows Control Panel. Note: These instructions are for computers running 
Windows Vista:
 
1. Click Start➪Control Panel.
 
2. Click the Clock, Language, and Region link.
 
3. Click the Regional and Language Options link.

Figuring Loan Calculations
Loans are part of almost everyone’s life. At the personal level, you may need 
to deal with car loans, education loans, and a home mortgage. From a busi-
ness perspective, companies from the smallest to the largest often use loans 
to fund new equipment, expansion, and so on. No matter what kind of loan 
you need, Excel has the tools that permit you to evaluate loans and calculate 
specific details.
Most loans have the following five factors:
 
✓ Loan principal: The amount you’re borrowing. For example if you’re 
interested in a loan for $5,000, then the loan principal is $5,000.
 
✓ Interest rate: The cost to borrow the principal. This is how lenders 
make money. The interest rate is a fee, so to speak, that a borrower pays 
to a lender. Usually, but not always, the interest rate is expressed as a 
percent per year.
 
✓ Payment period: Loans are usually paid back by paying a periodic 
amount. Most often the period is monthly.

91
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
 
✓ Duration of the loan: This is the count of payment periods. For example 
a loan may have 36 monthly payments.
 
✓ Payment: The amount you pay each payment period.
Each of these factors is related to all the others. If you borrow more, your 
monthly payments will be higher — that’s no surprise. If you get a low inter-
est rate, you may be able to pay off your loan in less time — that may be 
something to consider!
The functions used to calculate loan factors work with the same group of 
inputs, namely the five factors just listed. The functions typically accept 
three or four inputs as data and then calculate the desired value, kind of like 
the way algebra works.
Calculating the payment amount
The PMT function tells you the periodic payment amount for your loan. If 
you know the principal, interest rate, and number of payments for a loan, you 
can use the PMT function to calculate the payment amount. But first, a word 
about interest rates.
Most loan interest rates are expressed as an annual rate. However, Excel 
needs the interest rate per payment period in order to calculate properly. For 
example, if you’re calculating for a loan with monthly payments, you need the 
monthly interest rate. You can easily get this number by dividing the annual 
interest rate by 12, the number of months in a year. To calculate a loan pay-
ment, follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the loan principal, annual interest rate, and number of payment 
periods in separate cells within the worksheet.
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to display.
 
3. Enter =PMT( to begin the function entry.
 
 A small pop-up menu shows the arguments used in the function.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the interest rate, or just enter the cell 
address.
 
5. Enter /12 to divide the annual interest rate to get the monthly interest 
rate.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).

92

7. Click the cell where you entered the number of payments, or enter the 
cell address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Click the cell where you entered the principal amount, or just enter 
the cell address.
 
10. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
Watch those percents! Remember that a percent is really one one-hundredth, 
so 5 percent is the numerical value 0.05. You can format values to display as 
percents in Excel, but you must enter the proper value.
Figure 5-4 shows how we set up a worksheet with values and returned the 
periodic payment amount for a loan. The amount is expressed as a negative 
number because payments are a cash flow out. For example, you may be con-
sidering taking a loan out from the bank for some house additions. Using real 
numbers, the loan may be structured like this:
 
✓ A loan amount of $15,000 (the principal)
 
✓ An annual interest rate of 5 percent
 
✓ A monthly payment period
 
✓ A payment period of 24 payments
This summarizes four of the key parameters. The PMT function figures out 
the fifth — the periodic payment, which is the amount you have to shell out 
each month.
 
Figure 5-4: 
The PMT 
function 
calculates 
the loan 
payment 
amount.
 
Although the PMT function returns the constant periodic payback amount for 
a loan, note that each payment actually consists of two portions. One portion 
goes toward reducing the principal, and the other portion is the interest pay-
ment. As if this weren’t already confusing enough!

93
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
 
You may notice some new terms when using this function: Pv, Fv, and Nper. In 
financial terminology, present value (Pv) refers to the value of a transaction at 
the present moment. When dealing with a loan, for example, the present value 
is the amount you receive from the loan — in other words, the principal. The 
term future value (Fv) refers to the value of a transaction at some point in the 
future, such as the amount you’ll accumulate by saving $50 a month for five 
years. Nper stands for the number of payment periods in the loan.
Calculating interest payments
The IPMT function tells you the interest payment for a given period. In each 
payment period during a typical loan, the payment consists of a portion set 
to reduce the principal of the loan, with the other portion of the payment 
being the interest on the principal. The amount of interest varies payment by 
payment. In a typical loan, the portion of the payment that is interest is high-
est in the first period and is reduced in each successive period.
The IPMT function takes four inputs: the principal, the interest rate, the 
number of payments for the loan, and the number of the payment you’re 
interested in. For example, a loan may have 24 payments, and you’re inter-
ested in how much interest is included in the 12th payment. For some types 
of loans, the interest is tax deductible, so this information may literally be 
worth something! Here are the steps to use the IMPT function:
 
1. Enter the following information in separate cells within a column on 
the worksheet:
 
• Loan principal
 
• Annual interest rate
 
• Number of payment periods
 
• Number of the actual period for which you want to calculate the 
interest
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =IPMT( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the interest rate, or just enter the cell 
address.
 
5. Enter /12.
 
 This divides the annual interest rate to get the monthly interest rate.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).

7. Click the cell where you entered the number of the payment to ana-
lyze, or just enter the cell address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Click the cell where you entered the number of payments, or just 
enter the cell address.
 
10. Enter a comma (,).
 
11. Click the cell where you entered the principal amount, or just enter 
the cell address.
 
12. Type a ), and press Enter.
The IPMT function returns the interest portion of the amount of the specified 
payment. This amount will be smaller than the full periodic payment amount. 
How much smaller depends on which sequential payment is being examined. 
The remainder of the payment — the part that is not interest — goes to 
reduce the principal.
You can use two optional arguments with IPMT:
 
✓ Future Value: The amount you wish the loan to be worth at the end of 
its life. The default is 0.
 
✓ Type: This tells the function whether payments are applied at the end 
of the period or the beginning of the period. A value of 0 indicates the 
end of the period. A value of 1 indicates the beginning of the period. The 
default is 0.
These optional arguments when used become the respective fifth and sixth 
arguments.
Calculating payments toward principal
The PPMT function tells you the payment on principal for a given period. In 
each payment period during a typical loan, the payment consists of a portion 
that goes toward reducing the principal of the loan and another portion that 
is interest. With the PPMT function, you can find out the amount that reduces 
the principal.
The ratio of the interest portion to the payment on principal portion varies 
payment by payment. In a typical loan, the portion of the payment that 
is interest is highest in the first period and is reduced in each successive 
period. Turning that around, the last payment is almost all toward paying 
down the principal.

95
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
The PPMT function takes four inputs: the principal, the interest rate, the 
number of payments for the loan, and the number of the payment in ques-
tion. For example, a loan may have 36 payments and you’re interested in how 
much principal is included in just the last payment. Here are the steps to use 
this function:
 
1. Enter the loan principal, the annual interest rate, the number of pay-
ment periods, and the number of the actual period for which the inter-
est is to be calculated in separate cells within the worksheet.
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if you want.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =PPMT( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the interest rate, or just enter the cell 
address.
 
5. Enter /12 to divide the annual interest rate to get the monthly interest 
rate.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell where you entered the number of the payment to ana-
lyze, or just enter the cell address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Click the cell where you entered the number of payments, or just 
enter the cell address.
 
10. Enter a comma (,).
 
11. Click the cell where you entered the principal amount, or just enter 
the cell address.
 
12. Type a ), and press Enter.
The PPMT function returns the amount of the payment that reduces the prin-
cipal. This amount will be smaller than the full periodic payment amount. 
How much smaller depends on which sequential payment is being examined. 
The remainder of the payment, of course, is the interest charge.
 
The PMT function tells how much each payment is. The IPMT function tells 
you the interest portion. The PPMT tells you the principal function. For any 
given payment period, the amounts returned by IPMT and PPMT should equal 
the amount returned by PMT.

96
Part II: Doing the Math 
You can use two optional arguments with PPMT:
 
✓ Future Value: The amount you want the loan to be worth at the end of 
its life. The default is 0.
 
✓ Type: This tells the function whether payments are applied at the end 
of the period or the beginning of the period. A value of 0 indicates the 
end of the period. A value of 1 indicates the beginning of the period. The 
default is 0.
These optional arguments, when used, become the respective fifth and sixth 
arguments.
Calculating the number of payments
The NPER function tells you how many payments are necessary to pay off 
a loan. This is useful when you know how much you can afford to pay per 
month, and need to know how long it will take to pay off the loan. The inputs 
for this function are the principal, the interest rate, and the periodic payment 
amount.
Here’s how to use the NPER function:
 
1. Enter the following into separate cells on your worksheet:
 
• Loan principal
 
• Annual interest rate
 
• Periodic payment amount (the amount you can afford to pay)
 
 Enter the periodic payment amount as a negative number because pay-
ments are a cash flow out. You can add labels to adjacent cells to iden-
tify the values, if you want.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to display.
 
3. Enter =NPER( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the interest rate, or just enter the cell 
address.
 
5. Enter /12 to divide the annual interest rate to get the monthly interest 
rate.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).

the cell address.
 
10. Type a ), and press Enter.
Figure 5-5 shows how we set up a worksheet with values and used the NPER 
function to find out how many payments are necessary to pay off a loan. In 
our example, we assume you can afford to pay $200 per month for a loan. The 
amount you need is $4,000, and you’re able to get a 6-percent interest rate.
With this set of assumptions, the NPER function tells returns a value of 21.12 
months to pay off the loan. We don’t think anyone will mind if you round that 
off to 21 months. Knowing you’ll pay off the loan in less than two years may 
very well allow you to plan ahead for some other activity at that time. Did 
someone say “Las Vegas”!?
 
Figure 5-5:

You can use two optional arguments with NPER:
 
✓ Future Value: The amount you want the loan to be worth at the end of 
its life. The default is 0.
 
✓ Type: This tells the function whether payments are applied at the end 
of the period or the beginning of the period. A value of 0 indicates the 
end of the period. A value of 1 indicates the beginning of the period. The 
default is 0.
These optional arguments, when used, become the respective fifth and sixth 
arguments.

98
Part II: Doing the Math 
Calculating the interest rate
The RATE function tells you what the interest rate is on a loan. This function 
is great for comparing loan offers. Although a loan offer will always include 
an interest rate, you may want to use Excel to double-check and ensure that 
some other fees are not included in the payments. Then you can compare dif-
ferent loan scenarios to see which one offers the true lowest interest rate. We 
don’t think anyone wants to pay more than they have to!
 
Some lenders charge fees as well as an annual interest rate. When these fees 
are figured in, the effective interest rate will be higher than the stated interest 
rate. You can use the RATE function to determine the effective interest rate 
for a loan. If it’s the same as the stated interest rate, then you know no fees are 
being added.
The inputs for this function are the principal, the number of payments, 
and the fixed amount of the periodic payment. Here’s how to use the RATE 
function:
 
1. Enter the following in separate cells within the worksheet:
 
• Loan principal
 
• Number of payment periods
 
• Amount you will pay each month
 
 Enter the monthly payment amount as a negative number because it is a 
cash flow out. You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, 
if you want.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =RATE( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the number of periods, or just enter 
the cell address.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click the cell where you entered the monthly payment amount, or just 
enter the cell address.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).
 
8. Click the cell where you entered the principal amount, or just enter 
the cell address.
 
9. Type a ), and press Enter.

99
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
The RATE function returns the interest rate per period. This number can 
be misleading. The periodic interest amount may be small enough that it is 
displayed as 0 percent if the formatting in the cell isn’t set to display enough 
decimal points.
To find out the annual rate, you simply need to take the number returned by 
RATE and multiply it by 12. To do this:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the annual interest rate 
to appear.
 
2. Enter a =.
 
3. Click the cell where the RATE function returned the periodic interest 
rate.
 
4. Enter a ×.
 
5. Enter 12.
 
6. Press Enter.
As an example, assume a loan principal of $15,000 with a monthly payment 
of $650. The loan is to be paid off in 24 months. Figure 5-6 shows a worksheet 
with these figures. The periodic interest rate is calculated with the RATE 
function, and then the annual rate is calculated by multiplying the periodic 
interest rate by 12.
 
Figure 5-6: 
The RATE 
function 
calculates 
the periodic 
interest 
rate.
 
You can use three optional arguments with RATE:
 
✓ Future Value: The amount you want the loan to be worth at the end of 
its life. The default is 0.
 
✓ Type: This tells the function whether payments are applied at the end 
of the period or the beginning of the period. A value of 0 indicates the 

100
Part II: Doing the Math 
end of the period. A value of 1 indicates the beginning of the period. The 
default is 0.
 
✓ Guess: An estimate of what the interest rate should be. It is possible 
the function will need this value to determine a result. (See Excel’s Help 
system for further information.) The default value is .1 (for 10 percent).
These optional arguments, when used, become the respective fourth, fifth, 
and sixth arguments.
Calculating the principal
The PV function tells you what the principal amount of a loan is when you 
know the other loan factors, such as the interest rate and the number of pay-
ment periods. You can use PV to determine how much you can borrow when 
you already know how much you can pay each month and how long you can 
make payments.
The inputs for this function are the interest rate, the number of payment peri-
ods, and the monthly payment amount. The interest rate used in the function 
is the periodic rate, not the annual rate. Here’s how to use the PV function:
 
1. Enter the following into separate cells on your worksheet:
 
• Annual interest rate
 
• Number of payment periods
 
• Periodic payment amount
 
 Enter the periodic payment amount as a negative number because pay-
ments are a cash flow out. You can add labels to adjacent cells to iden-
tify the values, if desired.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =PV( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the interest rate, or just enter the cell 
address.
 
5. Enter /12 to divide the annual interest rate to get the monthly interest 
rate.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell where you entered the number of payments, or just 
enter the cell address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).

101
 Chapter 5: Calculating Loan Payments and Interest Rates
 
9. Click the cell where you entered the periodic payment amount, or just 
enter the cell address.
 
10. Type a ), and press Enter.
As an example, assume a monthly payment amount of $600. The annual inter-
est rate is 5 percent. There are 24 monthly payments. Figure 5-7 shows a 
worksheet with these figures.
With these assumptions, the loan principal is $13,676. Altering any of the 
parameters will cause PV to return a different amount of principal. For exam-
ple, raising the interest rate to 7.5 percent tells you that you can only borrow 
$13,333. Although you may often think of how much you’re borrowing, having 
interest in the interest is just as important!
You can use two optional arguments with PV:
 
✓ Future Value: The amount you want the loan to be worth at the end of 
its life. The default is 0.
 
✓ Type: This value tells the function whether payments are applied at the 
end of the period or the beginning of the period. A value of 0 indicates 
the end of the period. A value of 1 indicates the beginning of the period. 
The default is 0.
These optional arguments, when used, become the respective fifth and sixth 
arguments.

M
oney makes the world go ’round, so the saying goes. We have a new 
one: Excel functions make the money go ’round. Excel has functions 
that let you figure out what an investment will be worth at a future date. We 
all know it’s a good thing to look for a good interest rate on an investment. 
With the FV function, you can take this a step further and know how much 
the investment will be worth down the road.
Have you ever wondered what to do with some extra money? You can put 
it in the bank, you can pay off a debt, or you can purchase something. Excel 
helps you figure out the best course of action by using the IRR function. The 
IRR function lets you boil down each option to a single value that you can 
then use to compare opportunities and select the best one.
For the business set, Excel has a number of functions to help create depreciation 
schedules. Look no further than the SLN, SYD, DB, and DDB functions for help in 
this area. Brush up on these, and you can talk shop with your accountant!
Looking into the Future
The FV function tells you what an investment will be worth in the future. The 
function takes an initial amount of money and also takes into account addi-
tional periodic fixed payments. You also specify a rate of return — the interest 
rate — and the returned value tells you what the investment will be worth 
after a specified period of time.

104
Part II: Doing the Math 
For example, you start a savings account with a certain amount, say $1,000. 
Every month you add an additional $50 to the account. The bank pays an 
annual interest rate of 5 percent. At the end of two years, what is value of the 
account?
This is the type of question the FV function answers. The function takes five 
arguments:
 
✓ Interest rate: This argument is the annual interest rate. When entered 
in the function, it needs to be divided by the number of payments per 
year — presumably 12, if the payments are monthly.
 
✓ Number of payments: This argument is the total number of payments in 
the investment. These payments are the ones beyond the initial invest-
ment; don’t include the initial investment in this figure. If payments 
occur monthly and the investment is for three years, then there are 
36 payments.
 
✓ Payment amount: This argument is the fixed amount contributed to the 
investment each payment period.
 
✓ Initial investment (also called PV or present value): This argument 
is the amount the investment starts with. A possible value is 0, which 
means no initial amount is used to start the investment. This is an 
optional argument. If left out, 0 is assumed.
 
✓ How payments are applied: The periodic payments may be applied at 
either the beginning of each period or the end of each period. This argu-
ment affects the result to a small but noticeable degree. Either a 0 or a 1 
can be entered. A 0 tells the function that payments occur at the end of 
the period. A 1 tells the function that payments occur at the start of the 
period. This is an optional argument. If left out, 0 is assumed.
 
When using the FV function, be sure to enter the initial investment amount 
and the periodic payment amount as negative numbers. Although you’re 
investing these monies, you’re essentially paying out (even if it’s into your 
own account). Therefore, these are cash flows out.
Here’s how to use the FV function:
 
1. Enter the following data in separate cells within the worksheet:
 
• Annual interest rate
 
• Number of payment periods
 
• Periodic payment amount
 
• Initial investment amount
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired.

Part II: Doing the Math 
Depreciating the Finer Things in Life
Depreciation is the technique of allocating the cost of an asset over the 
useful period that the asset is used. Depreciation is applied to capital assets, 
tangible goods that provide usefulness for a year or more.
Vehicles, buildings, and equipment are the type of assets that depreciation 
can be applied to. A tuna sandwich is not a capital asset because its useful-
ness is going to last for just the few minutes it takes someone to eat it — 
although the person eating it may expect to capitalize on it!
Take the example of a business purchasing a delivery truck. The truck costs 
$35,000. It’s expected to be used for 12 years; this is known as the life of the 
asset. At the end of 12 years, the vehicle’s estimated worth will be $8,000. 
These figures follow certain terminology used in the depreciation formulas:
 
✓ Cost: This is the initial cost of the item ($35,000). This could include not 
just the price of the item but costs associated with getting and installing 
the item, such as delivery costs.
 
✓ Salvage: This is the value of the item at the end of the useful life of the 
item ($8,000).
 
✓ Life: This is the number of periods that the depreciation is applied to. 
This is usually expressed in years (in this case, 12 years).
Depreciation is calculated in different ways. Some techniques assume that 
an asset provides the majority of its usefulness during the earlier periods of 
its life. Depreciation in this case is applied on a sliding scale from the first 
period to the last. The bulk of the depreciation gets applied in the first few 
periods. This is known as an accelerated depreciation schedule. Sometimes 
the depreciation amount runs out sooner than the asset’s life. Alternatively, 
depreciation can be applied evenly over all the periods. In this case, each 
period of the asset’s life has an equal amount of depreciation to apply. The 
different depreciation methods are summarized in Table 6-1.
 
The depreciable cost is the original cost minus the salvage value.

methods use the example of a delivery truck that costs $35,000, is used for 12 
years, and has an ending value of $8,000. An important calculation in all these 
methods is the depreciable cost, which is the original cost minus the salvage 
value. In this example, the depreciable cost is $27,000, calculated as $35,000 – 
$8,000.

Part II: Doing the Math 
In the three depreciation methods shown in Figure 6-2 — straight line, sum of 
the years’ digits, and double declining balance — all end having the accumu-
lated depreciation at the end of life equal to the depreciable cost, or the cost 
minus the salvage.
However each method arrives at the total in a different way. The Straight 
Line method simply applies an even amount among the periods. The Sum of 
Years’ Digits and Double Declining Balance methods accelerate the deprecia-
tion. In fact the Double Declining Balance method does it to such a degree 
that all the depreciation is accounted for before the asset’s life is over.
Calculating straight line depreciation
The SLN function calculates the depreciation amount for each period of the 
life of the asset. The arguments are simple: just the cost, salvage, and the 
number of periods. In Figure 6-2, each cell in the range D9:D20 has the same 
formula: =SLN($B$2,$B$3,$B$4). Because straight line depreciation pro-
vides an equal amount of depreciation to each period, it makes sense that 
each cell uses the formula verbatim. The answer is the same regardless of the 
period (this approach differs from the accelerated depreciation methods that 
follow).
 
Using dollar signs ($) in front of column and row indicators fixes the cell 
address so it won’t change.
Here’s how to use the SLN function:
 
1. Enter three values in a worksheet:
 
• Cost of an asset
 
• Salvage value (always less than the original cost)
 
• Number of periods in the life of the asset (usually a number of 
years)
 
2. Enter =SLN( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the original cost, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the salvage amount, or enter its address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the number of periods, or enter its address.
 
8. Type a ), and press the Enter key.

109
 Chapter 6: Appreciating What You’ll Get, Depreciating What You’ve Got
The returned value is the amount of depreciation per period. Each period has 
the same depreciation amount. The same formula, referencing the same cells 
(using $ for absolute referencing) is in each cell in the D9:D20 range.
Creating an accelerated depreciation 
schedule
The SYD function creates an accelerated depreciation schedule (that is, more 
depreciation is applied in the earlier periods of the asset’s life). The method 
uses an interesting technique of first summing up the years’ digits. So for a 
depreciation schedule that covers five years, a value of 15 is first calculated 
as 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. If the schedule is for ten years, then the first step of 
the method is to calculate the sum of the digits 1 through 10, like this: 1 + 2 + 
3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55.
The years’ digit sum is then used as the denominator in calculations with the 
actual digits themselves to determine a percentage per period. The digits 
in the calculations are the reverse of the actual periods. In other words, in 
a five-year depreciation schedule, the depreciation for the first period is 
calculated as (5 ÷ 15) × Depreciable Cost. The second period depreciation is 
calculated as (4 ÷ 15) × Depreciable Cost. The following table makes it clear, 
with an assumed five-year depreciation on a depreciable cost of $6,000, and a 
salvage value of $0:
Period

( 5/15) × 6,000

$1,200
4
( 2/15) × 6,000
$800
5
( 1/15) × 6,000
$400
Guess what? You don’t even need to know how this works! Excel does all the 
figuring for you. The SYD function takes four arguments: the cost, the sal-
vage, the life (the number of periods), and the period to be calculated.

110
Part II: Doing the Math 
SYD returns the depreciation for a single period. Earlier, we showed you that 
the SLN function also returns the depreciation per period, but because all 
periods are the same, the SLN function didn’t need to have an actual period 
entered as an argument.
The SYD function returns a different depreciation amount for each period, so 
the period must be entered as an argument. In Figure 6-2, each formula in the 
range F9:F20 uses the SYD function but has a different period as the fourth 
argument. For example, cell F9 has the formula =SYD($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B9), 
and cell F10 has the formula =SYD($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B10). The last argument 
provides a different value.
Here’s how to use the SYD function to calculate the depreciation for one 
period:
 
1. Enter three values in a worksheet:
 
• Cost of an asset
 
• Salvage value (always less than the original cost)
 
• Number of periods in the life of the asset (usually a number of 
years)
 
2. Enter =SYD( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the original cost, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the salvage amount, or enter its address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the number of periods, or enter its address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Enter a number for the period for which to calculate the depreciation.
 
10. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
The returned value is the amount of depreciation for the entered period. To 
calculate the depreciation for the entire set of periods, enter a formula with 
the SYD function into the same number of cells as there are periods. In this 
case, each cell has a different period entered for the fourth argument. To 
make this type of entry easy to do, enter the first three arguments as abso-
lute cell addresses (in other words, use the dollar sign ($) in front of the row 
and column indicators). Leave the fourth argument in the relative address 
format.

111
 Chapter 6: Appreciating What You’ll Get, Depreciating What You’ve Got
In cell F9 in Figure 6-2, the formula is =SYD($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B9). Note 
how the first three arguments are fixed to the cells B2, B3, and B4. With this 
formula entered in cell F9, simply dragging the formula (using the fill handle 
in the lower-right corner of the cell) down to F20 fills the range of cells that 
need the calculation. The fourth argument changes in each row. For example, 
cell F20 has this formula: =SYD($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B20).
Creating an even faster accelerated 
depreciation schedule
The Double Declining Balance method provides an accelerated depreciation 
schedule but calculates the amounts differently than the Sum of Years’ Digits 
method.
Although rooted in the doubling of the Straight Line method (which is not an 
accelerated method), the calculation for each successive period is based on 
the remaining value of the asset after each period instead of to the deprecia-
ble cost. Because the remaining value is reduced each period, the schedule 
for each period is different.
The DDB function takes five arguments. The first four are required:
 
✓ Cost
 
✓ Salvage
 
✓ Life (the number of periods)
 
✓ Period for which the depreciation is to be calculated
The fifth argument is the factor. A factor of 2 tells the function to use the 
Double Declining Balance method. Other values can be used, such as 1.5. The 
factor is the rate at which the balance declines. A smaller value (than the 
default of 2) results in a longer time for the balance to decline. When the fifth 
argument is omitted, the value of 2 is the default.
The DDB function returns a different depreciation amount for each 
period, so the period must be entered as an argument. In Figure 6-2, 
each formula in the range H9:H20 uses the DDB function but has a dif-
ferent period as the fourth argument. For example, cell H9 has the 
formula =DDB($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B9), and cell H10 has the formula 
=DDB($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B10). The last argument provides a different value.

112
Part II: Doing the Math 
As shown in Figure 6-2 earlier, the Double Declining Balance method provides 
an even more accelerated depreciation schedule than the Sum of Years’ 
Digits method. In fact, the depreciation is fully accounted for before the 
asset has reached the end of its life.
Here’s how to use the DDB function to calculate the depreciation for one 
period:
 
1. Enter three values in a worksheet:
 
• Cost of an asset
 
• Salvage value (always less than the original cost)
 
• Number of periods in the life of the asset (usually a number of 
years)
 
2. Enter =DDB( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the original cost, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the salvage amount, or enter its address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the number of periods.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Enter a number for the period for which to calculate the depreciation.
 
10. If a variation on the Double Declining Balance method is desired, then 
enter a comma (,) and a numeric value other than 2.
 
11. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
The returned value is the amount of depreciation for the entered period. To 
calculate the depreciation for the entire set of periods, you need to enter a 
formula with the DDB function into the same number of cells as there are 
periods. In this case, each cell would have a different period entered for the 
fourth argument. One of the best approaches is to use absolute addressing 
for the first three function arguments. Then, when filling the rest of the cells 
by dragging or copying, the reference to original cost, salvage amount, and 
number of periods will stay constant. You can see an example of absolute 
addressing in the Formula Bar shown in Figure 6-2.
 
There is no hard-and-fast rule for selecting the best depreciation method. 
However, it makes sense to use one that matches the depreciating value of the 
asset. For example, cars lose a good deal of their value in the first few years, 
so applying an accelerated depreciation schedule makes sense.

113
 Chapter 6: Appreciating What You’ll Get, Depreciating What You’ve Got
Calculating a mid-year 
depreciation schedule
Most assets are not purchased, delivered, and put into service on January 1. 
So Excel provides a depreciation formula, DB, that accounts for the periods 
being offset from the calendar year. The DB function takes five arguments. 
The first four are the typical ones: the cost, the salvage, the life (the number 
of periods), and the period for which the depreciation is to be calculated. 
The fifth argument is the number of months in the first year. The fifth argu-
ment is optional, but when left out, the function will use 12 as a default.
For the fifth argument, a value of 3 means the depreciation starts in October 
(October through December is 3 months), so the amount of depreciation 
charged in the first calendar year is small. A value of 11 means the deprecia-
tion starts in February (February through December is 11 months).
Figure 6-3 shows a depreciation schedule created with the DB function. Note 
that the life of the asset is 12 years (in cell B4) but that the formula is applied 
to 13 different periods. Including an extra year is necessary because the first 
year is partial. The remaining handful of months must spill into an extra cal-
endar year. The depreciation periods and the calendar years are offset from 
each other.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Offsetting

114
Part II: Doing the Math 
The example in Figure 6-3 is for an asset put into service in August. Cell 
D9 has the formula =DB($B$2,$B$3,$B$4,B9,5). The fifth argument is 
5, which indicates the first year depreciation covers 5 months — August, 
September, October, November, and December.
Here’s how to use the DB function to calculate the depreciation for one 
period:
 
1. Enter three values in a worksheet:
 
• Cost of an asset
 
• Salvage value (always less than the original cost)
 
• Number of periods in the life of the asset (usually a number of 
years)
 
2. Enter =DB( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the original cost, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the salvage amount, or enter its address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the number of periods.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Enter a number for the period for which to calculate the depreciation.
 
10. Enter a comma (,).
 
11. Enter the number of months within the first year that the depreciation 
is applied to.
 
12. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
The returned value is the amount of depreciation for the entered period. To 
calculate the depreciation for the entire set of periods, you need to enter 
a formula with the DB function in the same number of cells as there are 
periods. However, you should make space for an additional period (refer to 
Figure 6-3).
 
Enter the constant arguments of the function with absolute addressing (the 
dollar signs used in front of row numbers or column letters). This makes the 
function easy to apply across multiple cells by copying the formula. The refer-
ences to the pertinent function arguments stay constant.

115
 Chapter 6: Appreciating What You’ll Get, Depreciating What You’ve Got
Measuring Your Internals
Which is better to do — pay off your credit card or invest in Uncle Ralph’s 
new business venture? You’re about to finance a car. Should you put down a 
large down payment? Or should you put down a small amount and invest the 
rest? How can you make decisions about alternative financial opportunities 
like these?
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) method helps answer these types of ques-
tions. The IRR function analyzes the cash flows in and out of an investment and 
calculates an interest rate that is the effective result of the cash flows. In other 
words, all the various cash flows are accounted for, and one interest rate is 
returned. Then you can compare this figure to other financial opportunities.
Perhaps Uncle Ralph’s business venture will provide a 10-percent return on 
your investment. On the other hand, the credit-card company charges you 
12 percent on your balance. In this case, paying off the credit card is wiser. 
Why? Because earning 10 percent is pointless when you’re just losing 12 per-
cent elsewhere. Uncle Ralph will understand, won’t he?
The IRR function takes two arguments. The first is required; the second is 
optional in some situations and required in others.
The first argument is an array of cash flows. Following the cash-flows stan-
dard, money coming in is entered as a positive value, and money going out 
is entered as a negative value. Assuming the particular cash flows in and out 
are entered on a worksheet, the first argument to the function is the range 
of cells.
The second argument is a guess at what the result should be. We know this 
sounds crazy, but Excel may need your help here (though most times it 
won’t). The IRR function works by starting with a guess at the result and cal-
culating how closely the guess matches the data. Then it adjusts the guess up 
or down and repeats the process (a technique called iteration) over and over 
until it arrives at the correct answer. If it doesn’t figure it out in 20 tries, then 
the #NUM! error is returned. In this case, you could enter a guess into the 
function to help it along. For example, 0.05 indicates a guess of 5 percent, 0.15 
indicates a guess of 15 percent, and so on. You can enter a negative number, 
too. For example, entering –0.05 tells the function you expect a 5-percent 
loss. If you don’t enter a guess, Excel assumes 0.1 (10 percent).
Figure 6-4 shows a business venture that has been evaluated using IRR. The 
project is to create a music CD and market it. Assorted costs such as studio 
time are cash flows out, entered as negative numbers. The one positive value 
in cell B7 is the expected revenue.

116
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
Figure 6-4: 
Calculating 
the return 
on a 
business 
venture.
 
The IRR function has been used to calculate an expected rate of return. The 
formula in cell B10 is =IRR(B3:B7). The entered range includes all the cash 
flows, in and out.
This project has an internal rate of return of 11 percent. By the way, the 
investment amount in this case is the sum of all the cash flows out — $8,400. 
Earning back $11,960 makes this a good investment. The revenue is signifi-
cantly higher than the outlay.
 
Even though a business opportunity seems worthy after IRR has been applied, 
you must consider other factors. For example, you may have to borrow the 
money to invest in the business venture. The real number to look at is the IRR 
of the business venture less the cost of borrowing the money to invest.
However, the project can now be compared to other investments. Another 
project may calculate to a higher internal rate of return. Then the second 
project would make sense to pursue. Of course, don’t forget the fun factor. 
Making a CD may be worth giving up a few extra points!
 
When comparing opportunities using the IRR function, a higher returned value 
is a better result than a lower IRR.
Figure 6-5 compares the business venture in Figure 6-4 with another invest-
ment opportunity. The second business venture is to start up a video-taping 
business for weddings and other affairs. There is a significant outlay for 
equipment and marketing. An internal rate of return is calculated for the 
first year, and then for the first and second year together. Cell H10 has the 
formula =IRR(H3:H5), and cell H11 has the formula =IRR(H3:H6). It’s clear 
that even within the first year the second business venture surpasses the first.

117

Figure 6-5: 
Comparing

oppor-
tunities.
 
This is how to use the IRR function:
 
1. Enter a series of cash flow values:
 
• Money paid out, such as the initial investment, as a negative 
value
 
• Money coming in, such as revenue, as a positive value
 
2. Enter =IRR( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Drag the cursor over the range of cells containing the cash flows, or 
enter the range address.
 
4. Optionally, enter a guess to help the function.
 
 To do this, enter a comma (,) and then enter a decimal value to be used 
as a percentage (such as .2 for 20 percent). You can enter a positive or 
negative value.
 
5. Type a ), and press Enter.
Considering that IRR is based on cash flows, in and out, it’s prudent to 
include paying yourself, as well as accounting for investments back in the 
business. Salary is a cash flow out; investment is a cash flow in.
Figure 6-6 expands on the video-taping business with a detailed example. As 
a business, there are various cash flows in and out — investment, utility pay-
ments, fees to the accountant and lawyer, advertising, salary, and so on.
The Internal Rate of Return for the first three months of the business is dis-
played in cell E1. The formula is =IRR(B4:B25,-0.2). By the way, this one 
needed a guess to return the answer. The guess is –0.2. The internal rate or 
return is –6 percent. The video-taping business is not a moneymaker after a 
few months, but this is true of many startups.

Note that this example includes dates. The IRR function works with an 
assumption that cash flows are periodic, which they aren’t in this example. 
There is another function, XIRR, that handles dates in its calculation of the 
internal rate of return.

xcel is excellent for working with advanced math and complex calcula-
tions. You can do so many complex things with Excel that it’s easy to 
forget that Excel is great at basic math, too.
Need the sum of a batch of numbers? No problem. Need to round a number? 
Read on! In this chapter, we show you not just how to sum and round num-
bers but how to use these methods in ways that give you just the answers 
you need.
Adding It All Together with 
the SUM Function
Just adding numbers together is something Excel is great at. Oh, you can use 
your calculator to add numbers as well, but think about it: On a calculator 
you enter a number, then press the + button, then enter another number, 
then press the + button, and so on. Eventually you press the = button and 
you get your answer. But if you made an entry mistake in the middle, you 
have to start all over!
The SUM function in Excel adds numbers together in a more efficient way. 
First, you list all your numbers on the worksheet. You can see them all and 
verify that they’re correct. Then you use the SUM function to add them all 
together. Here’s how:

120
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
1. Enter some numbers in a worksheet.
 
 These numbers can be both integer and real (decimal) values. You can 
add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if you want.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =SUM ( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click a cell where you entered a number.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click a cell where you entered another number.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until all the numbers have been entered into the 
function.
 
8. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
Figure 7-1 shows an example of how these steps help sum up amounts that 
are not situated next to each other on a worksheet. Cell F6 contains the sum 
of values found in cells C2, E2, G2, and I2.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Using the 
SUM func-
tion to add 
noncon-
tiguous 
numbers.
 
Using SUM is even easier when the numbers you’re adding are next to each 
in a column or row. The SUM function lets you enter a range of cells in place 
of single cells in the arguments of the function. So adding a list of contiguous 
numbers is as easy as giving SUM a single argument. Here’s how you enter a 
range as a single argument:
 
1. Enter some numbers in a worksheet.
 
 Be sure the numbers are continuous in a row or column. You can add 
labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired, but this doesn’t 
affect the SUM function.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =SUM( to begin the function entry.

121
 Chapter 7: Using Basic Math Functions
 
4. Enter the range address that contains the numbers. 
 
 Alternatively, you can click in the first cell with a number, hold down the 
left mouse button, and drag the mouse over the range of cells.
 
5. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
Using a range address in the function is a real timesaver — and is easier on 
the fingers, too. Figure 7-2 shows how a single range is used with the SUM 
function. Look at the Formula Bar and you’ll see the entire function’s syntax 
is =SUM(B6:B12). A single range takes the place of multiple individual cell 
addresses.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Calculating 
a sum from 
a range of 
cells.
 
You can sum multiple ranges in a single formula, which is great when mul-
tiple distinct contiguous cell ranges all must feed a grand total. Figure 7-3 
shows just such a situation.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Calculating 
a sum of 
multiple 
ranges.
 

122
Part II: Doing the Math 
Here’s how you use SUM to add the values in multiple ranges:
 
1. Enter some lists of numbers in a worksheet.
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =SUM( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the first cell in a range and, while holding down the left mouse 
button drag the mouse over all the cells in the range, and then release 
the mouse button.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click the first cell in another range and, while holding down the left 
mouse button, drag the mouse over all the cells in this range, and then 
release the mouse button.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until all the ranges have been entered into the 
function.
 
8. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
The completed function entry should look similar to the entry shown in the 
Formula Bar in Figure 7-3. Each range is separated by a comma, and a grand 
sum is in the cell where the function was entered.
 
When entering ranges into a formula, you can either type them in or use the 
mouse to drag over the range.
Excel has a special button, the AutoSum button, that makes it easier to use the 
SUM function. The AutoSum button is on both the Home tab and the Formulas 
tab on the Ribbon. The AutoSum feature works best with numbers that are in 
a vertical or horizontal list. In a nutshell, AutoSum creates a range reference 
for the SUM function to use. AutoSum makes its best guess of what the range 
should be. Often, it gets it right — but sometimes you have to help it along.
Using AutoSum is as easy as a click and pressing the Enter key. Figure 7-4 
shows that the AutoSum button on the Ribbon has been clicked, and Excel, 
in its infinite wisdom, guessed correctly that the operation is to sum cells 
B6:B13. At this point the operation is incomplete. Pressing the Enter key fin-
ishes the formula.
 
You can click the check mark to the left of the formula to complete the 
operation.
Follow these steps to use AutoSum:
 
1. Enter some lists of numbers in a worksheet.
 
 You can add labels to adjacent cells to identify the values, if desired.

2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Click the AutoSum button.
 
 AutoSum has entered a suggested range into the SUM function.
 
4. Change the suggested range, if necessary, either by entering it with 
the keyboard or using the mouse to drag over a range of cells.
 
5. Press the Enter key or click the check mark on the Formula Bar to 
complete the function.
 
It’s easy to use AutoSum to tally up multiple ranges, such as shown in Figure 
7-3. Before ending the function with the Enter key or the check mark, instead 
enter a comma and then drag the mouse over another range. Do this for as 
many ranges as you need to sum. Finally, finish the function by pressing Enter 
or clicking the check mark.
By the way, the AutoSum button can do more than addition. If you click the 
down arrow on the button, you have a choice of a few other key functions, 
such as Average. See Figure 7-5.

Part II: Doing the Math 
Rounding Out Your Knowledge 
Excel calculates answers to many decimal places. Unless you’re doing rocket 
science, you probably don’t need such precise answers. Excel has a great set 
of functions for rounding numbers so they’re usable for the rest of us.
Excel’s rounding functions are really helpful. The other day, Ken’s son had 
a couple of his friends over. We ordered a large pizza for their lunch. That’s 
eight slices for three hungry boys. How many slices does each boy get? 
Presto magic, we went over to the computer where Excel was already 
running (okay, we are Excel nuts after all), and we entered this simple 
formula =8/3.
Of course, Excel gave us the perfect answer. Each boy gets 2.66667 slices. 
Have you ever tried to cut 66,667/100,000ths of a slice of pizza? Not easy! 
This is the type of answer that rounding is used for. Although, to tell you the 
truth, we did solve the pizza problem a different way. We gave them each two 
slices, and we ate the last two (pretty good with mushrooms!).
Just plain old rounding
Easy to use, the ROUND function is the old tried-and-true method for round-
ing off a number. It takes two arguments — one argument is the number to 
round (typically this is a cell reference), and the other argument indicates 
how many decimal places to round to.
The ROUND function rounds up or down depending on the number being 
rounded. When the value is less than the halfway point of the next significant 
digit, then the number is rounded down. When the value is at or greater than 
the halfway point, then the number is rounded up:
 
✓ 10.4 rounds down to 10.
 
✓ 10.6 rounds up to 11.
 
✓ 10.5 also rounds up to 11.
Table 7-1 shows some examples of the ROUND function.

=ROUND(12.3456,1)
12.3
The second argument is 1. The result 
is rounded to a single decimal place.
=ROUND(12.3456,2)
12.35
The second argument is 2. The result 
is rounded to two decimal places. 
Note that the full decimal of .3456 
becomes .35. This is because the 
.0456 portion of the decimal value 
rounds to the closest second place 
decimal, which is .05.
=ROUND(12.3456,3)
12.346
The second argument is 3. The result 
is rounded to three decimal places. 
Note that the full decimal or .3456 
becomes .346. This is because the 
.0056 portion of the decimal value 
rounds to the closest third place deci-
mal, which is .006.
=ROUND(12.3456,4)
12.3456
The second argument is 4. There are 
four decimal places. No rounding 
takes place.
=ROUND(12.3456,0)
12
When the second argument is 0, the 
number is rounded to the nearest 
integer. Because 12.3456 is closer to 
12 than to 13, the number rounds 
to 12.
=ROUND(12.3456,-1)
10
When negative values are used in 
the second argument, the rounding 
occurs on the left side of the decimal 
(the integer portion). A second argu-
ment value of –1 tells the function to 
round to the closest value of 10. In 
this example, that value is 10 because 
12 is closer to 10 than 20.

126
Part II: Doing the Math 
Here’s how to use the ROUND function:
 
1. In a cell of your choice, enter a number that has a decimal portion.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =ROUND( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the number.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a number to indicate how many decimal places to round to.
 
7. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
 
Rounding functions make the most sense when the first argument is a cell 
reference, not an actual number. Think about it: If you know what a number 
should appear as, you would just enter the number — you would not need a 
function to round it.
Rounding in one direction
Excel has a handful of functions that round numbers either always up or 
always down. That is, when rounding a number, the functions that round 
down will always give a result that is lower than the number itself. Functions 
that round up, of course, always give a higher number. These functions are 
useful when letting the good ol’ ROUND function determine which way to 
round just isn’t going to do.
A few of these rounding functions not only round in the desired direction 
but even allow you to specify some additional ways of rounding. The EVEN 
and ODD functions, for example, round respectively to the closest even or 
odd number. The CEILING and FLOOR functions let you round to a multiple. 
EVEN, ODD, CEILING, and FLOOR are discussed later in this section.
Directional rounding, pure and simple
ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN are similar to the ROUND function. The first 
argument to the function is the cell reference of the number to be rounded. 
The second argument indicates the number of decimal places to round to. But 
unlike the plain old ROUND, the rounding direction is not based on the halfway 
point of the next significant digit but rather on which function you use.
For example, =ROUND(4.22,1) returns 4.2, but =ROUNDUP(4.22,1) returns 
4.3. ROUNDDOWN, however, returns 4.2 because 4.2 is less than 4.22. Table 
7-2 shows some examples of ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN.

cate the rounding would go to 
the next lower integer.

The second argument is 1. The 
result is rounded to a single 
decimal place. Note that the 
full decimal of .798 rounds 
down to .7. The standard 
ROUND function would round 
the decimal up to .8.

2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter either =ROUNDUP( or =ROUNDDOWN( to begin the function 
entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the number.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a number to indicate how many decimal places to round to.
 
7. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
Rounding to the multiple of choice
The FLOOR and CEILING functions take directional rounding to a new level. 
With these functions, the second argument is a multiple to which to round to. 
What does that mean?
Well, imagine this: You’re a human resources manager and you need to pre-
pare a summary report of employee salaries. You don’t need the figures to be 
reported down to the last penny, just rounded to the closest $250 multiple. 
Either FLOOR or CEILING can be used to do this. For this example, FLOOR 
can be used to round down to the closest multiple of $250 that is less than 
the salary, or CEILING can be used to round up to the next $250 multiple 
greater than the salary. Figure 7-6 shows how both FLOOR and CEILING 
return rounded values.
FLOOR and CEILING exceed the rounding ability of ROUND, ROUNDUP, and 
ROUNDDOWN. These three functions can use the positioning of digit place-
holders in how they work. For example, =ROUND(B4,-3) tells the ROUND 
function to round on the thousandth position. On the other hand, FLOOR and 
CEILING can round to whatever specific multiple you set.

129
 Chapter 7: Using Basic Math Functions
 
Figure 7-6: 
Using 
FLOOR or 
CEILING to 
round to a 
desired 
multiple.
 
The FLOOR function rounds toward 0, returning the closest multiple of the 
second argument that is lower than the number itself.
The CEILING function works in the opposite direction. CEILING will round its 
first argument, the number to be rounded, to the next multiple of the second 
number that is in the direction away from 0.
Certainly, a few examples will make this clear! Table 7-3 shows ways that 
FLOOR and CEILING can be used.

Part II: Doing the Math 
FLOOR and CEILING can be used to round negative numbers. FLOOR rounds 
toward 0, and CEILING rounds away from 0. FLOOR decreases a positive 
number as it rounds it towards 0 and also decreases a negative number 
toward 0, although in absolute terms, FLOOR actually increases the value of a 
negative number. Weird, huh?
CEILING does the opposite. It increases a positive number away from 0 and 
also increases a negative number away from 0, which in absolute terms 
means the number is getting smaller.
 
For both the FLOOR and CEILING functions, the first and second arguments 
must match signs. Trying to apply a positive number with a negative multiple, 
or vice versa, results in an error.
Here’s how to use either the FLOOR or CEILING function:
 
1. Enter a number in any cell.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter either =FLOOR( or =CEILING( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the number.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a number that is the next multiple you want to round the 
number to.
 
 For example, to get the floor value, at the ones place, make sure 1 is the 
second argument. The first argument should, of course, be a number 
larger than 1, and should be a decimal value, like this: =Floor(19.77, 1). 
This returns 19 as the floor, but hey — don’t hit the ceiling about it!
 
7. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
Rounding to the next even or odd number
The EVEN and ODD functions round numbers away from 0. The EVEN func-
tion will round a number to the next highest even integer. ODD rounds a 
number to the next highest odd integer. Table 7-4 has examples of how these 
functions work.

The EVEN function is helpful in calculations that depend on multiples of two. 
For example, let’s say you’re in charge of planning a school trip. You need to 
figure out how many bus seats are needed for each class. A seat can fit two 
children. When a class has an odd number of children, you still have to count 
that last seat as taken, even though only one child will sit there.
Say the class has 17 children. This formula tells you how many seats are 
needed: =EVEN(17)/2. The EVEN function returns the number 18 (the next 
higher integer), and that result is divided by 2 because two children fit on 
each seat. The answer is 9 seats are needed for a class of 17.
Here’s how to use either the EVEN or ODD function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter either =EVEN( or =ODD( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell where you entered a number, or enter a number.
 
4. Type a ), and press the Enter key.
Leaving All Decimals Behind with INT 
The INT function rounds a number down to the next lowest integer. The 
effect is as if the decimal portion is just dropped, and often INT is used to 
facilitate just that — dropping the decimal.
INT comes in handy when all you need to know is the integer part of a 
number or the integer part of a calculation’s result. For example, you may be 

132
Part II: Doing the Math 
estimating what it will cost to build a piece of furniture. You have the prices 
for each type of raw material, and you just want a ballpark total.
Figure 7-7 shows a worksheet in which a project has been set up. Column 
A contains item descriptions, and Column B has the price for each item. 
Columns C and D contain the parameters for the project. That is, Column C 
contains the count of each item needed, and Column D has the amount of 
how much will be spent for each item, that is the price per item multiplied by 
the number needed of the item.
The sums to be spent are then summed into a project total. If you added the 
item sums as they are — 83.88, 107.76, and 19.96 — you get a total of $211.60. 
Instead, the INT function is used to round the total to a ballpark figure of $211.
In cell D8, INT is applied to the total sum, like this:
=INT(SUM(D3:D5))
The INT function effectively drops the decimal portion, .60, and just returns 
the integer part, 211. The project estimate is $211.
 
Figure 7-7: 
Using INT to 
drop unnec-
essary 
decimals.
 
INT takes only the number as an argument. INT can work on positive or nega-
tive values, but works a little differently with negative numbers. INT actually 
rounds down a number to the next lower integer. When working with positive 
numbers the effect appears the same as just dropping the decimal. With neg-
ative numbers the effect is dropping the decimal portion then subtracting 1.
With negative numbers, the function produces an integer that is further away 
from 0. Therefore, a number such as –25.25 becomes –26. Here are some 
examples:
 
✓ INT(25.25) returns 25.
 
✓ INT(25.75) returns 25.

133
 Chapter 7: Using Basic Math Functions
 
✓ INT(-25.25) returns –26.
 
✓ INT(-25.75) returns –26.
Here’s how to use the INT function:
 
1. In a cell of your choice, enter a number that has a decimal portion.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
3. Enter =INT( to begin the function entry.
 
4. Click the cell where you entered the number.
 
5. Enter a closing parenthesis to end the function, and press the Enter key.
 
INT can also be used to return just the decimal part of a number. Subtracting 
the integer portion of a number from its full value leaves just the decimal as 
the answer. For example, 10.95-INT(10.95) equals 0.95.
Leaving Some Decimals 
Behind with TRUNC 
The TRUNC function drops a part of a number. The function takes two argu-
ments. The first argument is the number to be changed. The second argu-
ment indicates how much of the number is to be dropped. A value of 2 for the 
second argument says to leave 2 decimal places remaining. A value of 1 for 
the second argument says to leave 1 decimal place remaining.
TRUNC does no rounding as it truncates numbers. Here are some examples:
 
✓ =TRUNC(212.65, 2) returns 212.65.
 
✓ =TRUNC(212.65, 1) returns 212.6.
 
✓ =TRUNC(212.65, 0) returns 212.
You can even use TRUNC to drop a portion of the number from the integer 
side. To do this, you enter negative values for the second argument, like this:
 
✓ =TRUNC(212.65, -1) returns 210.
 
✓ =TRUNC(212.65, -2) returns 200.
 
The INT and TRUNC functions work exactly the same way for positive num-
bers. The only difference is when negative numbers are being changed. Then 
INT’s rounding produces a different result than TRUNC’s truncation.

134
Part II: Doing the Math 
Looking for a Sign
Excel’s SIGN function tells you whether a number is positive or negative. The 
SIGN function does not alter the number in any way but instead is used to 
find out information about the number.
SIGN does actually return a number, but it isn’t a variation of the number 
being tested in the function. SIGN returns only three different numbers:
 
✓ 1 if the number being tested is positive
 
✓ –1 if the number being tested is negative
 
✓ 0 if the number being tested is 0
Consider these examples:
 
✓ =SIGN(5) returns 1.
 
✓ =SIGN(-5) returns –1.
 
✓ =SIGN(0) returns 0.
Using SIGN in combination with other functions presents sophisticated ways 
of working with your information. As an example, you may be tallying up a 
day’s receipts from your store. You want to know the total value of sold mer-
chandise and the total value of returned merchandise. Sales are recorded as 
positive amounts, and returns are recorded as negative amounts.
Figure 7-8 shows a worksheet with these facts. Column A shows individual 
transaction amounts. Most are sales and are positive. A few returns occurred 
during the day, entered as negative amounts.
Just summing the whole transaction list would calculate the net revenue of 
the day, but often a business needs better information. Instead, two sums are 
calculated: the sum of sales and the sum of returns.
For each value in Column A, there is a value in Column B. The Column B 
values are the result of using the SIGN function. For example, cell B3 has this 
formula: =SIGN(A3).
As shown in Figure 7-8, values in Column B equal 1 when the associated value 
in Column A is positive. Column B displays –1 when the associated value is 
negative. This information is then used in a SUMIF function, which selectively 
sums information from Column A.

135
 Chapter 7: Using Basic Math Functions
 
Figure 7-8: 
Using SIGN 
to help cor-
rectly sum 
amounts.
 
In cell B18 is this formula: =SUMIF(B3:B15,1,A3:A15).
In cell B19 is this formula: =ABS(SUMIF(B3:B15,-1,A3:A15)).
The SUMIF function is used to indicate a criterion to use in determining 
which values to sum. For the sum of sales in cell B18, the presence of the 
value 1 in Column B determines which values to sum in Column A. For the 
sum of returns in cell B19, the presence of the value –1 in Column B deter-
mines which values to sum in Column A.
Also, the ABSOLUTE function (ABS) is used to present the number in cell 
B19 as a positive number. The answer in cell B19 is the sum of merchandise 
returns. You would say there was $64.18 (not –$64.18) in returned merchan-
dise, if you were asked.
The SUMIF function is covered in Chapter 8. The ABS function is covered next 
in this chapter.
Here’s how to use the SIGN function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =SIGN( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell where you entered a number, or enter a number.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.

136
Part II: Doing the Math 
Ignoring Signs
The ABS function returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute number 
is always a positive. The absolute of a positive number is the number itself. 
The absolute of a negative number is the number but with the sign changed 
to positive. For example, =ABS(100) returns 100, as does =ABS(-100).
The ABS function is handy in a number of situations. For example, sometimes 
imported data comes in as negative values, which need to be converted to 
their positive equivalents. Or, for example, when working with cash flows as 
discussed in Chapter 3, the ABS function can be used to present cash flows 
as positive numbers.
A common use of the ABS function is to calculate the difference between two 
numbers when you don’t know which number has the greater value to begin 
with. Say you need to calculate the difference between scores for two contes-
tants. Score 1 is in cell A5, and score 2 is in cell B5. The result goes in cell C5. 
The formula in cell C5 would then be =A5-B5.
Plugging in some numbers, assume score 1 is 90 and score 2 is 75. The dif-
ference is 15. Okay, that’s a good answer. What happens when score 1 is 75 
and score 2 is 90? The answer is –15. This answer is mathematically correct 
but not presented in a useful way. The difference is still 15, not –15. By using 
the ABS function, the result is always returned as positive. Therefore, for this 
example, the best formula coding is like this: =ABS(A5-A6).
Now either way, whether score 1 is greater than score 2 or score 2 is greater 
than score 1, the correct difference is returned.
Here’s how to use the ABS function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =ABS( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell where you entered a number, or enter a number.
 
4. Type a ), and press the Enter key.

n this chapter, we show you some of the more advanced math functions. 
You won’t use these functions everyday, but they’re just the right thing 
when you need them. Some of this will come back to you because you prob-
ably learned most of this in school.
Using PI to Calculate Circumference 
and Diameter
Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. A circle’s circumfer-
ence is its outer edge and is equal to the complete distance around the circle. 
A circle’s diameter is the length of a straight line spanning from one side of 
the circle, through the middle, and reaching the other side.
Dividing a circle’s circumference by its diameter returns a value of approxi-
mately 3.14159, known as pi. Pi is represented with the Greek letter pi and the 
symbol π.
Mathematicians have proven that pi is an irrational number — in other words, 
it has an infinite number of decimal places. They have calculated the value 

138
Part II: Doing the Math 
of pi to many thousands of decimal places, but you don’t need that level of 
precision in most calculations. Many people use the value 3.14159 for pi, but 
the PI function in Excel does a bit better than that. Excel returns a value of pi 
accurate to 15 digits — that is 14 decimal places in addition to the integer 3. 
This function has no input arguments. The function uses this syntax:
=PI()
 
In Excel, the PI function always returns 3.14159265358979, but initially it may 
look like some of the decimal points are missing. Change the formatting of the 
cell to display numbers with 14 decimal places to see the entire number.
If you know the circumference of a circle, you can calculate its diameter with 
this formula:
diameter = circumference ÷ pi
If you know the diameter of a circle, you can calculate its circumference with 
this formula:
circumference = diameter × pi
If you know the diameter of a circle, you can calculate the area of the circle. 
A component of this calculation is the radius, which equals one-half of the 
diameter. The formula is:
area = (diameter × 0.5)^2 × pi
Generating and Using Random Numbers
Random numbers are, by definition, unpredictable. That is, given a series of 
random numbers, you can’t predict the next number from what has come 
before. Random numbers are quite useful for trying formulas and calcula-
tions. Suppose you’re creating a worksheet to perform various kinds of data 
analysis. You may not have any real data yet, but you can generate random 
numbers to test the formulas and charts in the worksheet.
For example, an actuary may want to test some calculations based on a distribu-
tion of people’s ages. Random numbers that vary between 18 and 65 can be used 
for this task. You don’t have to manually enter fixed values between 18 and 65, 
because Excel can generate them automatically using the RAND function.

139
 Chapter 8: Advancing Your Math
The RAND function is simple — it takes no arguments and returns a decimal 
value between 0 and 1. That is, RAND never actually returns 0 or 1; the value 
is always in between these two numbers. The function is entered like this:
=RAND()
The RAND function returns values such as 0.136852731, 0.856104058, or 
0.009277161. “Yikes!” you may be thinking. “How do these numbers help 
if you need values between 18 and 65.” Actually it’s easy with a little extra 
math.
There is a standard calculation for generating random numbers within a 
determined range. The calculation follows:
= RAND() * (high number - low number) + low number
Using 18 and 65 as a desired range of numbers, the formula looks like 
=RAND()*(65-18)+18. Some sample values returned with this formula 
follow:
51.71777896
27.20727871
24.61657068
55.27298686
49.93632709
43.60069745
Almost usable! But what about the long decimal portions of these numbers? 
Some people lie about their ages, but I’ve never heard someone say he’s 27.2 
years old!
All that is needed now for this 18-to-65 age example is to include the INT 
or ROUND function. INT simply discards the decimal portion of a number. 
ROUND allows control over how to handle the decimal portion.
The syntax for using the INT function with the RAND function follows:
= INT((high number – low number + 1) * RAND() + low 
number)
The syntax for using the ROUND function with the RAND function follows:
=ROUND(RAND() * (high number-low number) + low number,0)

Table 8-1 points out how the INT and ROUND functions return different num-
bers. For example, 51.71777896 is more accurately rounded to 52. Bear in 
mind that the second argument in the ROUND function, 0 in this case, has an 
effect on how the rounding works. A 0 tells the ROUND function to round the 
number to the nearest integer, up or down to whichever integer is closest to 
the number.

Random values are volatile. Each time a worksheet is recalculated, the random 
values change. This behavior can be avoided by typing the formula directly 
into the Formula Bar, pressing the F9 key, and then pressing the Enter key.
A last but not insignificant note about using the RAND function: It is subject 
to the recalculation feature built in to worksheets. In other words, each time 
the worksheet calculates, the RAND function is rerun and returns a new 
random number. The calculation setting in your worksheet is probably set 
to automatic. You can check this by looking at the Formulas tab in the Excel 
Options dialog box. Figure 8-1 shows the calculation setting. On a setting of 
Automatic, the worksheet recalculates with every action. The random gener-
ated numbers keep changing, which can become quite annoying — not to 
mention the fact that it can ruin your work!
 
Luckily, you can generate a random number but have it remain fixed regard-
less of the calculation setting. The method is to type the RAND function, along 
with any other parts of a larger formula, directly into the Formula Bar. After 
you type your formula in, press the F9 key, and then press the Enter key. This 
tells Excel to calculate the formula and enter the returned random number as 
a fixed number instead of a formula. If you press the Enter key or finish the 
entry in some way without pressing the F9 key, you’ll have to enter it again.

Part II: Doing the Math 
Altering the function to use 2 items at a time from the total of 4 items — 
PERMUT(4,2) — returns just 12 permutations:
Ordering Items
Remember the Beatles? John, Paul, George, and Ringo? If you’re a drummer, 
you may think of the Beatles as Ringo, John, Paul, and George. The order of 
items in a list is known as a permutation. The more items in a list, the more 
possible permutations exist.
Excel provides the PERMUT function. It takes two arguments: the total 
number of items to choose from and the number of items to be used in deter-
mining the permutations. The function returns a single whole number. The 
syntax of the function follows:
=PERMUT(total number of items, number of items to use)
 
Use permutations when the order of items is important.
 
The total number of items must be the same as or greater than the number of 
items to use, or else an error is generated.
You may be confused about why the function takes two arguments. On the 
surface, it seems that the first argument is sufficient. Well, not quite. Getting 
back to the Beatles (anyone have a copy of Abbey Road we can borrow?). If 
we plug in 4 as the number for both arguments, like this — =PERMUT(4,4) — 
24 permutations are returned:
 
✓ 
John Paul George Ringo
 
✓ 
John Paul Ringo George
 
✓ 
John George Paul Ringo
 
✓ 
John George Ringo Paul
 
✓

Just for contrast, using the number 2 for both arguments — PERMUT(2,2) — 
returns just two items! When using PERMUT, make sure you’ve selected the 
correct numbers for the two arguments; otherwise, you’ll end up with an 
incorrect result and may not be aware of the mistake. The PERMUT function 
simply returns a number. The validity of the number is in your hands.
Combining
Combinations are similar to permutations but with a distinct difference. 
The order of items is intrinsic to permutations. Combinations, however, are 
groupings of items when the order doesn’t matter. For example, “John Paul 
George Ringo” and “Ringo George Paul John” are two distinct permutations 
but identical combinations.
 
Combinations are grouping of items, regardless of the order of the items.
The syntax for the function follows:
=COMBIN(total number of items, number of items to use)
The first argument is the total number of items to choose from, and the 
second argument is the number of items to be used in determining the com-
binations. The function returns a single whole number. The arguments for 
the COMBIN function are the same as those for the PERMUT function. The 
first argument must be equal to or greater than the second argument.
Plugging in the number 4 for both arguments — COMBIN(4,4) — returns 1. 
Yes, there is just one combination of four items selected from a total of four 
items! Using the Beatles once again, just one combination of the four musi-
cians exists, because the order of names doesn’t matter.
Selecting to use two items from a total of four — COMBIN(4,2) — returns 6. 
Selecting two items out of two — COMBIN(2,2) — returns 1. In fact, when-
ever the two arguments to the COMBIN function are the same, the result is 
always 1.

Part II: Doing the Math 
Raising Numbers to New Heights
There is an old tale about a king who loved chess so much he decided to 
reward the inventor of chess with any request he had. The inventor asked for 
a grain of wheat for the first square of the chessboard on Monday, two grains 
for the second square on Tuesday, four for the third square on Wednesday, 
eight for the fourth square on Thursday, and so on, each day doubling the 
amount until the 64th square was filled with wheat. The king thought this was 
a silly request. The inventor could have asked for riches!
What happened is that the kingdom quickly ran out of wheat. By the 
15th day, the number equaled 16,384. By the 20th day, the number was 
524,288. On the 64th day, the number would have been an astonishing 
9,223,372,036,854,780,000, but the kingdom had run out of wheat at least a 
couple of weeks earlier!
This “powerful” math is literally known as raising a number to a power. The 
power, in this case, means how many times a number is to be multiplied 
by itself. The notation is typically seen as a superscript (23 for example). 
Another common way of noting the use of a power is with the carat symbol: 
2^3. The verbiage for this is two to the third power.
In the chess example, 2 is raised to a higher power each day. Table 8-2 shows 
the first ten days.

The concept is easy enough. Each time the power is incremented by 1, the 
result doubles. Note that the first entry raises 2 to the 0 power. Isn’t that 
strange? Well, not really. Any number raised to the 0 power = 1. Also note 
that any number raised to the power of 1 equals the number itself.
Excel provides the POWER function, whose syntax follows:
=POWER(number, power)
Both the number and power arguments can be integer or real numbers, and 
negative numbers are allowed.
 
In a worksheet, either the POWER function or the carat can be used. For exam-
ple, in a cell you can enter =POWER(4,3), or =4^3. The result is the same 
either way. The carat is inserted by holding Shift and pressing the number 6 
key on the keyboard.
Multiplying Multiple Numbers
The PRODUCT function is useful for multiplying up to 255 numbers at once. 
The syntax follows:
=PRODUCT (number1, number2,…)
Cell references can be included in the argument list, as well as actual num-
bers, and, of course, they can be mixed. Therefore, all these variations work:
=PRODUCT(A2, B15, C20)
=PRODUCT(5, 8, 22)
=PRODUCT(A10, 5, B9)

146
Part II: Doing the Math 
In fact, you can use arrays of numbers as the arguments. In this case, the 
notation looks like this:
=PRODUCT(B85:B88,C85:C88, D86:D88)
Here’s how to use the PRODUCT function:
 
1. Enter some values on a worksheet.
 
 You can include many values, going down columns or across in rows.
 
2. Position the pointer in the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
3. Enter =PRODUCT( to begin the function.
 
4. Click a cell that has a number.
 
 Alternatively, you can hold down the left mouse button and drag the 
pointer over a range of cells with numbers.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 up to 255 times.
 
7. Enter a ), and press Enter.
The result you see is calculated by multiplying all the numbers you selected. 
Your fingers would probably hurt if you had done this on a calculator.
Figure 8-2 shows this on a worksheet. Cell C10 shows the result of multiplying 
12 numbers, although only three arguments, as ranges, have been used in the 
function.

 Chapter 8: Advancing Your Math
Using What Remains with 
the MOD Function
The MOD function returns the remainder from an integer division operation. 
This is called the modulus, hence the function’s name. The function has two 
arguments: the number being divided, and the number being used to divide 
the first argument. The second argument is the divisor. The syntax follows:
=MOD(number, divisor)
These are examples of the MOD function:
=MOD(12,6) returns 0
=MOD(14,5) returns 4
=MOD(27,7) returns 6
=MOD(25,10) returns 5
=MOD(25,10) returns –5
=MOD(15.675,8.25) returns 7.425
The returned value is always the same sign as the divisor.
You can use MOD to tell whether a number is odd or even. By simply using 
a number 2 as the second argument, the returned value will be 0 if the first 
argument is an even number and 1 if it is not.
But what’s so great about that? You can just look at a number and tell 
whether it’s odd or even. The power of the MOD function is apparent when 
testing a reference or formula, such as =MOD(D12 - G15,2). In a complex 
worksheet with many formulas, you many not be able to tell when a cell will 
contain an odd or even number.
Taking this a step further, the MOD function can be used to identify cells in a 
worksheet that are multiples of the divisor. Figure 8-3 shows how this works.
Row 1 of the worksheet in Figure 8-3 shows example formulas of ones that 
are entered into the successive rows of Columns B and C, starting from the 
second row. Column A contains numbers that will be tested with the MOD 
function. If looking for multiples of 4, the MOD function will have 4 as the 
divisor, and when a value is a multiple of 4, MOD returns 0. This is evident by 
comparing the numbers in column A with the returned values in column B.

148
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Using MOD 
to find spe-
cific values.
 
The same approach is used in column C, only here the divisor is 10, so mul-
tiples of 10 are being tested for in column A. Where a 0 appears in column C, 
the associated number in Column A is a multiple of 10.
In this way, the MOD function can be used to find meaningful values in a 
worksheet.
Summing Things Up
Ah ha! Just when you think you know how to sum up numbers (really, haven’t 
you been doing this since your early school years?) we drum up some fancy-
footing summing that makes you think twice before going for that quick total.
The functions here are very cool — very “in” with the math crowd. To be a 
true Excel guru, try out the SUBTOTAL, SUMPRODUCT, SUMIF, and SUMIFS 
functions shown here, and then strut your stuff around the office!
Using SUBTOTAL
The SUBTOTAL function is very flexible. It doesn’t perform just one calcula-
tion, but rather it can do any one of 11 different calculations depending on 
what you need. What’s more, SUBTOTAL can perform these calculations on 
up to 255 ranges of numbers. This gives you the ability to get exactly the type 
of summary you need without creating a complex set of formulas. The syntax 
for the function follows:
=SUBTOTAL(function number, range1, range2,…)

149
 Chapter 8: Advancing Your Math
The first argument determines which calculation is performed. It can be 
any of the values shown in Table 8-3. The remaining arguments identify the 
ranges containing the numbers to be used in the calculation.

Part II: Doing the Math 
Figure 8-4 exemplifies a few uses of the SUBTOTAL function. Raw data values 
are listed in Column A. The results of using the function in a few variations 
are listed in Column C. Column E displays the actual function entries that 
returned the respective results in Column C.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Working 
with the 
SUBTOTAL 
function.
 
 
Using named ranges with the SUBTOTAL function is useful. For example, 
=SUBTOTAL(1, October_Sales, November_Sales, December_sales) 
makes for an easy way to calculate the average sale of the fourth quarter.
There is a second set of numbers that can be used for the Function Number 
(the first argument in the SUBTOTAL function). These numbers start with 
101 and are the same functions as shown in Table 8-3. For example, 101 is 
AVERAGE, 102 is COUNT, and so forth.
The 1 through 11 Function Numbers consider all values in a range. The 101 
through 111 Function Numbers tell the function to ignore values that are 
in hidden rows or columns. Figure 8-5 shows SUBTOTAL in use with both 
Function Number systems. Comparing Figure 8-5 to Figure 8-4, you can see 
that Row 2 has been set to hidden. In Figure 8-5, the values in column B 
are calculated using the same Function Numbers as in Figure 8-4; column 
G shows SUBTOTAL using the Function Numbers that start with 101. For 
example, cell B3 still shows the average of the numbers in the range A1:A6 
as equal to 14. The result in cell G3 shows the average of A1:A6 equal to 15.2. 
The value of 8 in cell A2 is not used because it is hidden.

Using SUMPRODUCT
The SUMPRODUCT function provides a sophisticated way to add various 
products — across ranges of values. It doesn’t just add the products of sepa-
rate ranges; it produces products of the values positioned in the same place 
in each range, then sums up those products. The syntax for the function 
follows:
=SUMPRODUCT(Range1, Range2, …)
The arguments to SUMPRODUCT must be ranges, although a range can be 
a single value. What is required is that all the ranges be the same size, both 
rows and columns. Up to 255 ranges are allowed, and at least 2 are required.
SUMPRODUCT works by first multiplying elements, by position, across the 
ranges, then adding all the results. To see how this works, take a look at the 
three ranges of values in Figure 8-6. We have put letters in the ranges instead 
of numbers to make this easier to explain. Suppose you entered the following 
formula in the worksheet:
=SUMPRODUCT(B2:C4, E2:F4, H2:I4)
The result would be calculated by the following steps:
 
1. Multiplying A times H times N and saving the result.
 
2. Multiplying D times K times Q and saving the result.
 
3. Multiplying B times I times O and saving the result.
 
4. Multiplying E times L times R and saving the result.
 
5. Multiplying C times J times P and saving the result.

152

6. Multiplying F times M times S and saving the result.
 
7. Adding all six results to get the final answer.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Following 
the steps 
used by 
SUM
PRODUCT.
 
 
Be careful when you’re using the SUMPRODUCT function. It’s easy to mis-
takenly assume the function will add products of individual ranges. It won’t. 
SUMPRODUCT returns the sums of products across positional elements.
As confusing as SUMPRODUCT seems, it actually has a sophisticated use. 
Imagine you have a list of units sold by product, and another list of the prod-
ucts’ prices. You need to know total sales (that is, the sum of the amounts), 
where an amount is units sold times the unit price.
In the old days of spreadsheets, you would use an additional column to first 
multiply each unit sold figure by its price. Then you would sum those inter-
mediate values. Now, with SUMPRODUCT, the drudgery is over. The single 
use of SUMPRODUCT gets the final answer in one step. Figure 8-7 shows 
how one cell contains the needed grand total. No intermediate steps were 
necessary.

Using SUMIF and SUMIFS
SUMIF is one of the real gemstones of Excel functions. It calculates the sum of 
a range of values, including only those values that meet a specified criterion. 
The criterion can be based on the same column that is being summed, or it 
can be based on an adjacent column.
Suppose you use a worksheet to keep track of all your food-store purchases. 
For each shopping trip, you put the date in Column A, the amount in Column 
B, and the name of the store in column C. You can use the SUMIF function to 
tell Excel to add all the values in Column B only where Column C contains 
“Great Grocery”. That’s it. SUMIF gives you the answer. Neat!
Figure 8-8 shows this example. The date of purchase, place of purchase, and 
amount spent are listed in three columns. SUMIF calculates the sum of pur-
chases at Great Grocery. Here is how the function is written for the example:
=SUMIF(C3:C15,”Great Grocery”,B3:B15)
 
Figure 8-8: 
Using 
SUMIF for 
targeted 
tallying.
 
 
A couple of important points about the SUMIF function:
 
✓ The second argument can accommodate several variations of expres-
sions, such as including greater than (>) or less than (<) signs or other 
operators. For example, if a column has regions such as North, South, 
East, and West, the criteria could be <>North, which would return the 
sum of rows that are not for the North region.
 
✓ Unpredictable results occur if the ranges in the first and third arguments 
do not match in size.

154
Part II: Doing the Math 
Try it yourself! Here’s how to use the SUMIF function:
 
1. Enter two ranges of data in a worksheet.
 
 At least one should contain numerical data. Make sure both ranges are 
the same size.
 
2. Position the pointer in the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
3. Enter =SUMIF( to begin the function.
 
4. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the pointer over one of the 
ranges.
 
 This is the range that can be other than numerical data.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click one of the cells in the first range.
 
 This is the criteria.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).
 
8. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the pointer over the 
second range.
 
 This is the range that must contain numerical data.
 
9. Enter a ), and press Enter.
The result you see is a sum of the numeric values where the items in the first 
range matched the selected criteria.
The example in Figure 8-8 sums values when the store is Great Grocery, but 
does not use the date in the calculation. What if we need to know how much 
was spent at Great Grocery in April only? Excel provides a function for this of 
course — SUMIFS.
SUMIFS lets you apply multiple “if” conditions to a sum. The format of SUMIFS 
is a bit different than SUMIF. SUMIFS uses this structure:
=SUMIFS(range to be summed, criteria range 1, criteria 1, 
criteria range 2, criteria 2)
The structure requires the range of numerical values to be entered first, fol-
lowed by pairs of criteria ranges and the criteria itself. In Figure 8-9 the for-
mula is:
=SUMIFS(B3:B15,A3:A15,”<5/1/2010”,C3:C15,”Great Grocery”)

155
 Chapter 8: Advancing Your Math
The Function uses B3:B15 as the source of values to sum. A1:A15 is the first 
criteria range, and “<5/1/2010” is the criteria. This tells the function to look 
for any date that is earlier than May 1, 2010 (which filters the dates to just 
April). This is followed by a second criteria range and value — in C3:C15 look 
just for Great Grocery. The final sum of $84.24 adds just three numbers — 
15.04, 42.25, and 26.95 — because these are the only values in April for Great 
Grocery.

Getting an Angle on Trigonometry
Did you think Excel was not up to snuff to provide some tricks for trigonom-
etry? Then think again. Who can resist playing around with such exciting 
things like cosines and tangents? Alright we admit this is not for everyone, 
but here are the trig functions none-the-less. Besides even if the concepts are 
difficult, you can always throw around the terms at a party and be recognized 
as the brainiest person there.
Three basic trigonometry functions
The sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle are likely the most used values in 
trigonometry calculations. They provide answers about the relationships of 
a triangle’s angles to the sides of the triangle. (See how we boiled down the 
bulk of trigonometry into a single sentence!)
Figure 8-10 shows a handful of angles in Column A, and their corresponding 
sine, cosine, and tangent values, respectively in Columns B, C, and D.

156
Part II: Doing the Math 
 
Figure 8-10: 
Using 
SIN, COS, 
and TAN 
Functions.
 
The SIN, COS, and TAN functions take just the single argument of a number 
(the angle) and return the converted values. The functions look like this if the 
angles are in radians:
=SIN(angle)
=COS(angle)
=TAN(angle)
If the angles are in degrees, then they need to be converted into radians by 
using the RADIANS function. In this case you would use these:
=SIN(RADIANS(angle))
=COS(RADIANS(angle))
=TAN(RADIANS(angle))
Which leads us to…
Degrees and radians
An angle can be expressed in degrees or radians. A degree is more common 
to us non-rocket scientists. Most everyone know that there are 360 degrees in 
a circle, or that a right angle is 90 degrees, or even that doing a “180” means 
turning completely around and going the other way.
One radian = 180/pi degrees and one degree = pi/180 radians. All this 
talk about pi is making us hungry! For lowdown and quick conversion: 1 
radian=57.3 degrees.
 
Pi is approximately equal to 3.14159. See the beginning of this chapter for a 
forkful of pi.

157
 Chapter 8: Advancing Your Math
Excel provides the RADIANS and DEGREES functions to convert a number 
from radians to degrees or vice-versa. We think the real reason they did this 
was to keep pi out of the picture so we would concentrate on work and not 
dessert.
The functions are the single argument type:
=RADIANS(angle in degrees)
=DEGREES(angle in radians)
Using some numbers, we can see that 90 degrees = 1.5707963267949 radians 
and so 1.5707963267949 radians must equal 90 degrees. And it does.

Just pick up the newspaper or turn on the television or the radio. We’re 
bombarded with interesting facts and figures that are the result of sta-
tistical work: There is a 60-percent chance of rain; the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average gained 2.8 percent; the Yankees are favored over the Red Sox, 4-3; 
and so on.
Statistics are used to tell us facts about the world around us. Statistics are 
also used to give us lies about our world. Statistics can be used to confuse or 
obscure information. Imagine you try a new candy bar and you like it. Well, 
then you can boast that 100 percent of the people who tried it liked it!
Sometimes statistics produce odd conclusions — to say the least! Imagine 
this: Bill Gates helps at a homeless shelter. The average wealth of the 40 or so 
people in the room is $1 billion. How about this: You hear on the news that 
the price of gasoline dropped 6 percent. Hurray! Let’s go on a trip. But what 
is that 6-percent decrease based on? Is it a comparison to last week’s price, 
last month’s price, or last year’s price? Perhaps the price of gasoline dropped 
6 percent, compared to last month. But still prices are 20 percent higher than 
last year. Is this good news?
Statistics are traditionally divided into two types. Descriptive statistics, cov-
ered in this chapter, help you to summarize and understand data. Inferential 
statistics, covered in Chapter 10, are used to draw conclusions about data 
comparisons.

Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
Several statistical functions have been upgraded in Excel 2010. Generally, a 
function may now have a sample and population variation; an inclusive or 
exclusive (of bounding values) variation; a multiple ranges or single range 
variation; or some other dual purpose variation. Some functions in this chap-
ter are shown in this new format.
Stuck in the Middle with AVERAGE, 
MEDIAN, and MODE
Are you of average height? Do you earn an average income? Are your children 
getting above-average grades? There is more than a single way to determine 
the middle value from a group of values. There are actually three common 
statistical functions to describe the center value from a population of values. 
These are the mean, the median, and the mode.
 
The term population refers to all possible measurements or data points, while 
the term sample refers to the measurements or data points that you actually 
have. For example, if you are conducting a survey of registered voters in New 
Jersey, the population is all registered voters in the state, while the sample is 
those voters who actually took the survey.
Technically, the term average refers to the mean value, but in common lan-
guage average can also be used to mean the median or the mode instead of 
the mean. This leads to all sorts of wonderful claims from advertisers and 
anyone else who wants to make a point.
 
It’s important to understand the difference between these terms:
 
✓ Mean: The mean is a calculated value. It’s the result of summing the 
values in a list or set of values and then dividing the sum by the number 
of values. For example, the average of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 equals 2. 
This is calculated as (1 + 2 + 3) ÷ 3 or 6 ÷ 3.
 
✓ Median: The median is the middle value in a sorted list of values. If 
there is an odd number of items in the list, then the median is the actual 
middle value. In lists with an even number of items, there is no actual 
middle value. In this case, the median is the mean of the two values 
in the middle. For example, the median of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 3 because the 
middle value is 3. The median of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is 3.5 because the mean of 
the two middle values, 3 and 4, is 3.5.
 
✓ Mode: The mode is the value that has the highest occurrence in a list of 
values. It may not exist! In the list of values 1, 2, 3, 4, there is no mode 
because each number is present the same number of times. In the list of 
values 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, the mode is 2 because 2 is used twice and the other 
numbers are used once.

163
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
The mean, median, and mode are sometimes called measures of central ten-
dency because they serve to summarize a data sample in a single statistic.
Get started! These steps create three results in your worksheet, using the 
AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and MODE functions:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
 Any mix of numbers will do.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the mean to appear.
 
3. Enter =AVERAGE( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) to end the AVERAGE function.
 
6. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the median to appear.
 
7. Enter =MEDIAN( to start the function.
 
8. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
9. Enter a ) to end the MEDIAN function.
 
10. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the mode to appear.
 
11. Enter =MODE.SNGL( to start the function.
 
12. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
13. Enter a ) to end the MODE function.
Depending on the numbers you entered, the three results may be the same 
(very unlikely!), or about the same, or quite different. The MODE function will 
have returned #N/A if there were no repeating values in your data.
 
The mean is calculated using the AVERAGE function.
Imagine this: Three people use a new toothpaste for six months, and then 
all go to the dentist. Two have no cavities. Hey, this toothpaste is great! The 
third person has three cavities. Uh oh!
Person
Cavities
A
0
B
0
C
3

164
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
The average number of cavities for this group is 1. That is, if you’re using 
the mean as the average. This doesn’t sound like a good toothpaste if, on 
average, each person who used it got a cavity! On the other hand, both the 
median and the mode equal 0. The median equals 0 because that’s the middle 
value in the sorted list. The mode equals 0 because that’s the highest occur-
ring value. As you can see, statistics prove that the new toothpaste gives 0 
cavities, on average — sort of.
Look at another example. Figure 9-1 shows the results of a midterm test for a 
hypothetical class. The mean, median, and mode are shown for the distribu-
tion of grades.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Defining 
central 
tendencies 
in a list of 
grades.
 
As almost always happens, the mean, the median, and the mode each return 
a different number. Strictly speaking, we should say that the average grade 
is 86.72, the mean value. But if the teacher or the school wants to make their 
impact on students look better, they could point out that the most frequently 
occurring score is 94. This is the mode and, sure enough, three students 
did receive a 94. But is this the best representation of the overall results? 
Probably not.
Working with the functions that return these measures of central tendencies — 
AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and MODE — can make for interesting and sometimes 
misleading results. Here is one more example of how these three functions 
can give widely different results for the same data. Here are data for six cus-
tomers and what they spent with a company last year:

165
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
Customer
Total Amount Spent Last Year
A
$300
B
$90
C
$2,600
D
$850
E
$28,400
F
$300
The mean (using the AVERAGE function) is $5,423.33. The median is $575, 
and the mode is $300. These three amounts aren’t even close! Which one best 
represents the typical amount that a customer spent last year?
The issue with this set of data is that one value — $28,400 — is so much 
larger than the other values that it skews the mean. You may be led to 
believe that each customer spent about $5,423. But looking at the real 
values, only one single customer spent a lot of money, relatively speaking. 
Customers A, B, C, D, and F spent nowhere near $5,423.33, so how can that 
“average” apply to them?
Figure 9-2 shows this situation in which one value is way out of league with 
the rest — sometimes called an outlier — which makes the average not too 
useful. Figure 9-2 also shows how much the mean changes if the one spend-
thrift customer is left out, but if you leave out any other customer, there is 
very little change in the mean.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Deciding 
what to 
do with an 
unusual 
value.
 

166
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
In Scenario 2, Customer E is left out. The mean and the median are much 
closer together — $968 and $850, respectively. Either amount reasonably rep-
resents the mid value of what customers spent last year.
But can you just drop a customer like that (not to mention the biggest cus-
tomer)? Yikes! Instead, you can consider a couple of creative averaging solu-
tions. Either use the median or use a weighted average (a calculation of the 
mean but in which the relevance of each value is taken into account). Figure 
9-3 shows the result of each approach.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Calculating 
a creative 
mean.
 
Scenario 1 shows the mean and the median for the set of customer amounts. 
Here, using the median is a better representation of the central tendency of 
the group.
 
When reporting results based on an atypical calculation, it’s good practice to 
add a footnote that explains how the answer was determined. If you were to 
report that the “average” expenditure was $925, a note should explain this is 
the median, not the mean.
Scenario 2 in Figure 9-3 is a little more complex. This involves making a 
weighted average, which is used to let individual values be more or less influ-
ential in the calculation of a mean. This is just what you need! Customer E 
needs to be less influential.
Weighted averages are the result of applying a weighting factor to each value 
that is used in calculating the mean. In our example, all the customers are 
given a weight factor of 18 except Customer E, who has a weight factor of 
10. All customers except Customer E have been given increased weight, and 
Customer E has been given decreased weight because his sales value is so 

167
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
different from all of the others. When weights are applied in an average, the 
sum of the weights must equal 100. Without applying any weighting factor, 
each customer effectively has a weight of 16.667 — the number of custom-
ers divided into 100. Applying a weight of 10 to Customer E, and 18 to all the 
other customers, keeps the sum of the weights at 100: 18 × 5 + 10. The values 
of 18 and 10 have been subjectively chosen. When you use weighting factors 
to calculate a weighted average you must make that fact known when you 
present the results.
The mean in Scenario 2 is $3,711. This figure is still way above the median or 
even the mean of just the five customers without Customer E; refer to Figure 
9-2. Even so, it’s less than the unweighted mean shown in Scenario 1 and is 
probably a more accurate reflection of the data.
By the way, the mean in Scenario 2 is not calculated with the AVERAGE func-
tion, which cannot handle weighted means. Instead, the SUMPRODUCT func-
tion is used. The actual formula in cell F18 looks like this:
=SUMPRODUCT(F9:F14,G9:G14)/SUM(G9:G14)
The amount that each customer spent last year is multiplied by that custom-
er’s weight, and a sum of those products is calculated with SUMPRODUCT. 
Finally, the sum of the products is divided by the sum of the weights.
Deviating from the Middle
Life is full of variety! Calculating the mean for a group will not reflect that 
variety. Suppose you are doing a survey of salaries for different occupations 
and that occupation A has a mean salary of $75,000 a year and occupation B 
has the same mean of $75,000 a year. Does this mean that the two groups are 
the same? Not necessarily. Suppose that in group A the salaries range from 
$65,000 to $85,000, but in group B they range from $35,000 to $115,000. This 
difference — how much the values differ from the mean — is called variance. 
Excel provides you with functions to calculate and evaluate variance, and 
this is an important part of many statistical presentations.
Measuring variance
Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is in relation to the 
mean. Variance is calculated by summing the squared deviations from the 
mean.

168
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Mathematics that make you work
Specifically, variance is calculated as follows:
 
1. Calculate the mean of the set of values.
 
2. Calculate the difference from the mean for each value.
 
3. Square each difference.
 
4. Sum up the squares.
 
5. Divide the sum by the number of items in the sample, minus 1.
A sample is a selected set of values taken from the population. A sample is 
easier to work with. For example, any statistical results found on 1,000 sales 
transactions probably would return the same, or close to the same, results if 
run on the entire population of 10,000 transactions.
 
Note that the last step differs depending on whether the VAR.S or VAR.P func-
tion is used. VAR.S uses the number of items, minus 1, as the denominator. 
VAR.P uses the number of items.
Figure 9-4 shows these steps in calculating a variance without using Excel’s 
built-in function for the task. Column B has a handful of values. Column C 
shows the deviation of each figure from the mean of the values. The mean, 
which equals 7.8, is never actually shown. Instead, the mean is calculated 
within the formula that computes the difference. For example, cell C8 has this 
formula:
=B8-AVERAGE($B$4:$B$8)
Column D squares the values in Column C. This is an easy calculation. Here 
are the contents of cell D8: =C8^2. Finally, the sum of the squared deviations 
is divided by the number of items, less one item. The formula in cell D12 is 
=SUM(D4:D8)/(COUNT(B4:B8)-1).

variance

 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
Functions that do the work: VAR.S and VAR.P
Now that you know how to create a variance the textbook way, you can 
forget it all! We show the mathematical steps so you could understand what 
happens, but Excel provides the VAR.S and VAR.P functions to do all the 
grunge work for you.
In Figure 9-4, cell D15 shows the variance calculated directly with the VAR.S 
function: =VAR.S(B4:B8).
Try it yourself. Here’s how:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
 Any mix of numbers will do.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the variance to appear.
 
3. Enter =VAR.S( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
Variance is calculated on either a population of data or a sample of the 
population:
 
✓ The VAR.S function calculates variance on a sample of a population’s 
data.
 
✓ The VAR.P function calculates variance on the full population.
The calculation is slightly different in that the denominator for variance of a 
population is the number of items. The denominator for variance of a sample 
is the number of items less one. Figure 9-5 shows how VAR.S and VAR.P are 
used on a sample and the full population. Cells A4:A43 contain the number of 
hours of television watched daily by 40 individuals.
The VAR.S function calculates the variance of a sample of 20 values. The 
VAR.P function calculates the variance of the full population of 40 values. 
VAR.P is entered in the same fashion as VAR.S. Here’s how:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
 Any mix of numbers will do.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the variance to appear.
 
3. Enter =VAR.P( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.

Analyzing deviations
Often, finding the mean is an adequate measure of a sample of data. 
Sometimes the mean is not enough — you also want to know the average 
deviation from the mean. That is, finding the average of how far individual 
values differ from the mean of the sample. For example, you may need to 
know the average score on a test and also how far the scores, on average, 
differ from the mean. Average deviation is another way to specify variance.
Here’s an example:
Score
Deviation from 84.83 Mean
78
6.83
92
7.17
97
12.17
80
4.83
72
12.83
90
5.17
The mean of this sample of values is 84.83. Use the AVERAGE function, if you 
want to double-check. Each individual value deviates somewhat from the 
mean. For example, 92 has a deviation value of 7.17 from the mean. A simple 
equation proves this: 92 – 84.83 = 7.17.

171
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
If you use the AVERAGE function to get the mean of the deviations, you have 
the average deviation. It’s even easier than that, though. Excel provides the 
AVEDEV function for this very purpose! AVEDEV calculates the mean and 
averages the deviations all in one step.
Here’s how to use the AVEDEV function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the average deviation 
to appear.
 
3. Enter =AVEDEV( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) press the Enter key.
 
The AVEDEV function averages the absolute deviations — in other words, neg-
ative deviations (where the data point is less than the mean) are converted to 
positive values for the calculation. For example, a value of 10 has a deviation 
of –40 from a mean of 50: 10 – 50 = –40. However, AVEDEV uses the absolute 
value of the deviation, 40, instead of –40.
The variance, explained earlier in the chapter, serves as the basis for a 
common statistical value called the standard deviation. Technically speaking, 
the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Variance is calcu-
lated by squaring deviations from the mean.
The variance and the standard deviation are both valid measurements of 
deviation. However, the variance can be a confusing number to work with. In 
Figure 9-4, the variance was calculated to be 17.7 for a group of values whose 
range is just 11 (14 – 3). How can a range that is only a size of 11 show a vari-
ance of 17.7? Well, it does, as shown earlier in Figure 9-4.
This oddity is removed when using the standard deviation. The reversing of 
the squaring brings the result back to the range of the data. The standard 
deviation value fits inside the range of the sample values. In addition, you’ll 
find the standard deviation is more commonly used than the variance in sta-
tistical analyses. Excel has a standard deviation formula — STDEV.P. This is 
how you use it:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the standard deviation 
to appear.
 
3. Enter =STDEV.P( to start the function.

4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
Figure 9-6 takes the data and variance shown in Figure 9-4 and adds the stan-
dard deviation to the picture. The standard deviation is 3.762977544. This 
number fits inside the range of the sample data.

Looking for normal distribution
The standard deviation is one of the most widely used measures in statistical 
work. It’s often used to analyze deviation in a normal distribution. A distri-
bution is the frequency of occurrences of values in a population or sample. 
A normal distribution often occurs in large data sets that have a natural, or 
random, attribute. For example, taking a measurement of the height of 1,000 
10-year-old children will produce a normal distribution. Most of the mea-
sured heights will center around and deviate somewhat from the mean. A few 
measured heights will be extreme — both considerably larger than the mean, 
and considerably smaller than the mean.
Ringing the bell curve
A normal distribution is often visually represented as a graph in the shape of 
a bell — hence the popular name, the bell curve. Figure 9-7 shows a normal 
distribution.

173
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
 
Figure 9-7: 
Displaying a 
normal dis-
tribution in a 
graph.
 
A normal distribution has a few key characteristics:
 
✓ The curve is symmetrical around the mean — half the measurements 
are greater than the mean and half are less than the mean.
 
✓ The mean, median, and mode are all the same.
 
✓ The highest point of the curve is the mean.
 
✓ The width and height are determined by the standard deviation. The 
larger the standard deviation, the wider and flatter the curve. You can 
have two normal distributions with the same mean and different stan-
dard deviations.
 
✓ 68.2 percent of the area under the curve is within one standard devia-
tion of the mean (both to the left and the right), 95.44 percent of the area 
under the curve is within two standard deviations, and 99.72 percent of 
the area under the curve is within three standard deviations.
 
✓ The extreme left and right ends of the curve are called the tails. Extreme 
values are found in the tails. For example, in a distribution of height, 
very short heights are in the left tail, and very large heights are in the 
right tail.
Different sets of data almost always produce different means and standard 
deviations and, therefore, a different-shaped bell curve. Figure 9-8 shows two 
superimposed normal distributions. Each is a perfectly valid normal distribu-
tion; however, each has its own mean and standard deviation, with the nar-
rower curve having a smaller standard deviation.
Analysis is often done with normal distributions to determine probabilities. 
For example, what is the probability that a 10-year-old child’s height is 54 
inches? Somewhere along the curve is a discrete point that represents this 
height. Further computation (outside the scope of this discussion) returns 
the probability. What about finding the probability that a 10-year-old is 54 
inches high or greater? Then the area under the curve is considered. These 
are the type of questions and answers determined with normal distributions.

174

Figure 9-8: 
Normal 
distribu-
tions come

heights and 
widths.
 
 
A good amount of analysis of normal distributions involves the values in the 
tails — the areas to the extreme left and right of the normal distribution curve.
 
All normal distributions have a mean and a standard deviation. However, the 
standard normal distribution is characterized by having the mean equal 0 and 
the standard deviation equal 1.
A table of values serves as a lookup in determining probabilities for areas 
under the standard normal curve. This table is useful when working with data 
that has been modified to fit the standard normal distribution. This table is 
often found in the appendix section of statistics books and on the Internet as 
well. Try www.statsoft.com/textbook/sttable.html.
Using STANDARDIZE
In order to use this table of standard normal curve probabilities, the data 
being analyzed must be standardized. Excel provides the STANDARDIZE func-
tion for just this purpose. STANDARDIZE takes three arguments: the data 
point, the mean, and the standard deviation. The returned value is what the 
data point value is when the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.
 
An individual value from a nonstandard normal distribution is referred to as x. 
An individual value from a standard normal distribution is referred to as z.
Figure 9-9 shows how the STANDARDIZE function changes raw values to stan-
dard values. The standard deviation of the raw data is 7.438637452, but the 
standard deviation of the standardized values is 1. The mean of the standard-
ized values is 0.
Column B in Figure 9-9 has a long list of 1,200 random values. The mean is 
17.23473829, as seen in cell C2. The standard deviation is 7.438637452, as 
seen in cell C3. For each data point in Column B, the standardized value is 
displayed in Column E. The list of values in Column E are those returned with 
the STANDARDIZE function.

175
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
 
Figure 9-9: 
Standard-
izing a 
distribution 
of data.
 
The STANDARDIZE function takes three arguments:
 
✓ Data point
 
✓ Mean of the distribution
 
✓ Standard deviation of the distribution
For example, this is the formula in cell E7: =STANDARDIZE(B7,C$2,C$3).
Note how a few key properties of the distribution have changed after the 
values are standardized:
 
✓ The standard deviation is 1.
 
✓ The mean is 0.
 
✓ The standardized values fall within the range –1.77 to 1.72.
This third point is determined by using the MIN and MAX functions, respec-
tively, in cells I7 and I8. Having values fall in the range –1.7 to 1.7 allows the 
values to be analyzed with the Areas Under the Standard Normal Curve table 
mentioned earlier. That is, it’s a property of standard normal curves to have 
all values fit into this range.
Here’s how to use the STANDARDIZE function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values into a column.
 
 It makes sense if this list is a set of random observable data, such as 
heights, weights, or amounts of monthly rainfall.

176
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation.
 
 See the section “Stuck in the Middle with AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and 
MODE” to learn about the mean.
 
 The STANDARDIZE function references these values. The mean is cal-
culated with the AVERAGE function, and the standard deviation is cal-
culated with the STDEV.P function. STDEV.P is used instead of STDEV.S 
because the whole data population is used.
 
3. Place the cursor in the cell adjacent to the first data point entered in 
Step 1.
 
4. Enter =STANDARDIZE( to start the function.
 
5. Click the cell that has the first data point.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the mean.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Click the cell that has the standard deviation.
 
10. Enter a ) to end the function.
 
 The formula with the STANDARDIZE function is now complete. However, 
you must edit it to fix the references to the mean and standard devia-
tion. The references need to be made absolute so they won’t change 
when the formula is dragged down to other cells.
 
11. Double-click the cell with the formula to enter the edit mode.
 
12. Precede the column and row parts of the reference to the cell that 
contains the mean with a dollar sign ($).
 
13. Precede the column and row parts of the reference to the cell that 
contains the standard deviation with a dollar sign ($).
 
14. Press the Enter key, the Tab key, or the Esc key to end the editing.
 
15. Use the fill handle to drag the formula down to the rest of the cells 
that are adjacent to the source data points.
 
It’s important that the references to the mean and standard deviation are 
treated as absolute references so they won’t change when the formula is 
dragged to the other cells. Therefore, the formula should end up looking like 
this: =STANDARDIZE(B7,$C$2,$C$3). Note the $ signs.
Skewed from the norm
There is deviation in a distribution, but who says the deviation has to be uni-
form with deviation the same on both sides of the mean? Not all distributions 

177
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
are normal — some are skewed, with more values clustered either below the 
mean or above it:
 
✓ When more values fall below the mean, the distribution is positively 
skewed.
 
✓ When more values fall above the mean, the distribution is negatively 
skewed.
The following minitable has a few examples:
Values
Mean
Comment
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Figure 9-10 shows a distribution plot, where 1,000 values are in the distribu-
tion, ranging between 1 and 100. The values are summarized in a table of 
frequencies (discussed later in this chapter). The table of frequencies is the 
source of the chart.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Working 
with skewed 
data.
 

178
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
The mean of the distribution is 53.669, shown in cell D17. Cells D19 and D20 
show the number of values that fall above and below the mean. There are 
more values above the mean than below. The distribution, therefore, is nega-
tively skewed.
The actual skew factor is –0.27323459. The formula in cell D22 is 
=SKEW(A1:A1000). The chart makes it easy to see the amount of skew. 
The plot is leaning to the right.
 
Finding out the amount of skew in a distribution can help identify bias in the 
data. If, for example, the data is expected to fall into a normal (unskewed) 
distribution (such as a random sampling of height for 10-year-old children) 
and the data is skewed, then you have to wonder if some bias got into the 
data. Perhaps a number of 14-year-old children were measured by mistake 
and those heights were mixed in with the data. Of course, being skewed is not 
itself an indication of bias. Some distributions are skewed by their very nature.
SKEW
Here’s how to use the SKEW function to determine the skewness of a 
distribution:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the amount of skew to 
appear.
 
3. Enter =SKEW( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
KURT
Another way that a distribution can differ from the normal distribution is 
kurtosis. This is a measure of the peakedness or flatness of a distribution 
compared with the normal distribution. It is also a measure of the size of the 
curves’ tails. You determine kurtosis with the KURT function, which returns 
a positive value if the distribution is relatively peaked with small tails com-
pared with the normal distribution. A negative result means the distribution 
is relatively flat with large tails.
Figure 9-11 shows the curves of two distributions. The one on the left has 
a negative kurtosis of –0.82096 indicating a somewhat flat distribution. The 
distribution on the right is above 1, which means the distribution has a pro-
nounced peak and relatively shorter tails.

3. Enter =KURT( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
Comparing data sets
At times you need to compare two sets of data to see how they relate to one 
another. For example, how does the amount of snowfall affect the number of 
customers entering a store? Does the money spent on advertising increase 
the number of new customers? You answer these questions by determining 
whether the two data sets are correlated.
Excel provides two functions for this task: COVARIANCE.S (or COVARIANCE.P) 
and CORREL. Respectively, these return the covariance and correlation coef-
ficient results from comparing two sets of data.
COVARIANCE.S and COVARIANCE.P
Either COVARIANCE function takes two arrays as its arguments and returns 
a single value. The value can be positive or negative. A positive value means 
that the two arrays of data tend to move in the same direction: If data set A 
increases (or decreases), then data set B also increases (or decreases). A 

180
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
negative value means that the two data sets tend to move in opposite direc-
tions: When A increases, B decreases, and vice versa. The covariance’s abso-
lute value reflects the strength of the relationship.
 
When COVARIANCE.S or COVARIANCE.P returns 0, there is no relationship 
between the two sets of data.
Sales of bread will likely create sales of butter; they’re somewhat related. In 
other words, the amount of butter a store sells is likely to follow the amount 
of bread it sells — more bread, more butter:
Day
Loaves of Bread Sold
Tubs of Butter Sold
Monday
62
12
Tuesday
77
15
Wednesday

26
As bread sales increase, so do sales of butter. Therefore, sales of butter are 
expected to have a positive relation to sales of bread. These items comple-
ment each other. In contrast, bread and muffins compete against each other. 
As bread is purchased, the sales of muffins likely suffer because people will 
eat one or the other. Without even using any function, you can conclude that 
bread sales and butter sales move in the same direction and that bread sales 
and muffin sales move in differing directions. But by how much?
Figure 9-12 shows an example that measures snowfall and the number of 
customers coming into a store. Two covariance calculations are given — one 
for snowfall between 0 and 3 inches, and one for snowfall between 0 and 8 
inches.
 
Figure 9-12: 
Using 
COVARI-
ANCE to 
look for a 
relationship 
between

sets.
 

181
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
In Figure 9-12, the first COVARIANCE measures the similarity of the amount 
of snowfall with the number of customers, but just for 0 to 3 inches of snow. 
The formula in cell G7 is =COVARIANCE.P(B5:B8,D5:D8). The answer is 
–6.875. This means that, as snowfall increases, the number of customers 
decreases. The two sets of data go in opposite directions. As one goes up, the 
other goes down. This is confirmed by the result being negative.
The formula in cell G12 is =COVARARIANCE.P(B5:B13,D5:D13). This exam-
ines all the values of the data sets, inclusive of 0 to 8 inches of snow. The 
covariance is –47.7778. This, too, confirms that as snowfall increases, the 
number of customers decreases.
However, note that the covariance of the first calculation, for 0 to 3 inches of 
snow, is not as severe as the second calculation for 0 to 8 inches. When there 
is just up to 3 inches of snow on the ground, some customers stay away — 
but not that many. On the other hand, when there are 8 inches of snow, no 
customers show up. The first covariance is comparably less than the second: 
–6.875 versus –47.7778. The former number is closer to 0 — and tells you that 
a few inches of snow don’t have much effect. The latter number is signifi-
cantly distanced from 0 — and, sure enough, when up to 8 inches of snow is 
considered, customers stay home.
Note that the COVARIANCE.P function is used when using the data in rows 5     
through 8 because those data points are being considered as a population 
and not a sample of a population.
Here’s how to use the COVARIANCE.P function:
 
1. Enter two lists of numbers.
 
 The lists must be the same size.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want covariance to appear.
 
3. Enter =COVARIANCE.P( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the first list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the pointer over the second list, or enter the address of the 
range.
 
7. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
CORREL
The CORREL function works in the manner as COVARIANCE, but the result is 
always between –1 and 1. The result is, in effect, set to a standard. Then the 
result of one correlation can be compared to another.

182
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
A negative result means there is an inverse correlation. As one set of data 
goes up, the other goes down. The actual negative value tells to what degree 
the inverse correlation is. A value of –1 means the two sets of data move per-
fectly in opposite directions. A value of –0.5, for example, means the two sets 
move in somewhat opposite directions.
 
The CORREL function returns a value between –1 and 0. A positive value 
means the two data sets move in the same direction. A negative value means 
the two sets of data move in opposite directions. A value of 0 means there is 
no relation between the sets of data.
Figure 9-13 shows three correlation results. The correlations display how 
customers reacted (as a percentage increase in sales) with regard to three 
types of advertising. All three advertising campaigns show a positive cor-
relation. As more money is spent on advertising, customer responsiveness 
increases (or at least doesn’t reverse its direction).
 
Figure 9-13: 
Comparing 
the results 
of adver-
tising 
campaigns.
 
All three returned correlation values fall within the range of 0 to 1 and, there-
fore, are easy to compare with each other. The evidence is clear — direct 
mail is not as efficient as magazine or radio advertising. Both the magazine 
and radio advertising score high; the returned values are close to 1. However, 
direct mail returns a correlation of 0.4472. A positive correlation does exist — 
that is, direct-mail expenditures create an increase in customer responsive-
ness. But the correlation is not as strong as magazine or radio advertising. 
The money spent on direct mail would be better spent elsewhere.

Here’s how to use the CORREL function:
 
1. Enter two lists of numbers.
 
 The lists must be the same size.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want correlation to appear.
 
3. Enter =CORREL( to start the function.

Analyzing Data with 
Percentiles and Bins
No, not with trash bins (although you may want to throw your data out at 
times)! The term bins refers to analyzing data by determining how many data 
points fall into specified ranges, or bins. Percentiles is a technique for analyz-
ing data by determining where values relate, percentage-wise, to the entire 
data set.
Imagine this: A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug to lower cho-
lesterol. The data is 500 cholesterol readings from the people in the sample. 
In Figure 9-14, the 500 cholesterol readings are in Column A. Of interest is 
how the data breaks up with regard to the 25-percent, the 50-percent, and the 
75-percent marks. That is, what cholesterol reading is greater than 25 percent 
of the data (and therefore smaller than 75 percent of the data)? What value is 
at the 50-percent position? These measures are called quartiles because they 
divide the sample into four quarters.
QUARTILE.INC and QUARTILE.EXC
The QUARTILE function is designed specifically for this kind of analysis. The 
function takes two arguments: One is the range of the sample data, and the 
other indicates which quartile to return. The second argument can be a 0, 1, 
2, 3, or 4 when using QUARTILE.INC; or 1, 2, or 3 when using QUARTILE.EXC. 
QUARTILE.EXC is used when the minimum and maximum values are to be 
excluded, therefore, that version of the function does not take 0 0r 4 as the 
second argument:

=QUARTILE.INC(A4:A503,4)
Maximum value in the data
 
Figure 9-14: 
Finding out 
values at

percentiles.
 
QUARTILE.INC (or QUARTILE.EXC) works on ordered data, but you don’t 
have to do the sorting; the function takes care of that. In Figure 9-14, the 
quartiles have been calculated. The minimum and maximum values have 
been returned by using a 0 and a 4, respectively, as the second argument.
Here’s how to use the QUARTILE function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want a particular quartile to 
appear.
 
3. Enter =QUARTILE.INC( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a value between 0 and 4 for the second argument.
 
7. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.

185
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
PERCENTILE.INC and PERCENTILE.EXC
The PERCENTILE functions are similar to the QUARTILE functions except you 
can specify which percentile to use when returning a value. You aren’t locked 
into fixed percentiles such as 25, 50, or 75.
PERCENTILE.INC (or PERCENTILE.EXC) takes two arguments:
 
✓ Range of the sample
 
✓ Value between 0 and 1
The value tells the function which percentile to use. For example, 0.1 is the 
10th percentile, 0.2 is the 20th percentile, and so on.
 
Use the QUARTILE.INC function to analyze data at the fixed 25th, 50th, and 
75th percentiles. Use the PERCENTILE.INC function to analyze data at any 
desired percentile. PERCENTILE.EXC is used when the second argument is 
exclusive of 0 and 1. In other words, the second argument can be any value 
between 0 and 1 but not 0 or 1.
Figure 9-15 shows a sample of test scores. Who scored at or above the 90th 
percentile? The highest-scoring students deserve some recognition. Bear in 
mind that scoring at the 90th percentile is not the same as getting a score of 
90. Values at or above the 90th percentile are those that are in the top 10 per-
cent of whatever scores are in the sample.
 
Figure 9-15: 
Using 
PERCEN TILE 
to find high 
scorers.
 

186
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
It so happens that the score that is positioned at the 90th percentile is 80. 
Cell F4 has the formula =PERCENTILE.INC(B3:B27,0.9), which uses 0.9 as 
the second argument.
The cells in C3:C27 all have a formula that tests whether the cell to the 
left, in column B, is at or greater than the 90th percentile. For example, cell 
C3 has this formula: =IF(B3>=PERCENTILE.INC(B$3:B$27,0.9),”A 
winner!”,””).
If the value in cell B3 is equal to or greater than the value at the 90th percen-
tile, then cell C3 displays the text “A winner!”. The value in cell B3 is 59, 
which doesn’t make for a winner. On the other hand, the value in cell B5 is 
greater than 80, so cell C5 displays the message.
Here’s how to use the PERCENTILE.INC function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =PERCENTILE.INC( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a value between 0 and 1 for the second argument.
 
 This tells the function what percentile to seek.
 
7. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
RANK
The RANK.EQ or RANK.AVG function tells you the rank of a particular 
number, in other words where the value is positioned, within a distribution. 
In a sample of ten values, for example, a number could be the smallest (rank = 1), 
the largest (rank = 10), or somewhere in between. The function takes three 
arguments:
 
✓ The number being tested for rank: If this number isn’t found in the 
data, an error is returned.
 
✓ The range to look in: A reference to a range of cells goes here.
 
✓ A 0 or a 1, telling the function how to sort the distribution: A 0 (or if the 
argument is omitted) tells the function to sort the values in descending 
order. A 1 tells the function to sort in ascending order. The order of the sort 
makes a difference in how the result in interpreted. Is the value in question 
being compared to the top value of the data or the bottom value?

187
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
The difference between RANK.EQ and RANK.AVG is that if more than one 
value is at the same rank, then RANK.EQ will use the larger value, whereas 
RANK.AVG will use the average of the values.
Figure 9-16 displays a list of employees and the bonuses they earned. Say 
you’re the employee who earned $4,800. You want to know where you rank 
in the range of bonus payouts. Cell F4 contains a formula with the RANK.
EQ function: =RANK.EQ(C9,C3:C20). The function returns an answer of 4. 
Note that the function was entered without the third argument. This tells the 
function to sort the distribution descending in determining where the value 
is positioned. This makes sense for determining how close to the top of the 
range a value is.
 
Figure 9-16: 
Determining 
the rank of a

Follow these steps to use the RANK function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =RANK.EQ( to start the function.
 
4. Click the cell that has the value you want to find the rank for, or enter 
its address.
 
 You can also just enter the actual value.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the pointer over the list of values, or enter the address of the 
range.

188
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
7. If you want to have the number evaluated against the list in ascend-
ing order, enter a comma (,) and then enter a 1.
 
 Descending order is the default and doesn’t require an argument to be 
entered.
 
8. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
PERCENTRANK
The PERCENTRANK.INC or PERCENTRANK.EXC formula also returns the rank 
of a value but tells you where the value is as a percentage. In other words, a 
PERCENTRANK function may tell you that a value is positioned 20 percent 
into the ordered distribution. PERCENTRANK takes three arguments:
 
✓ The range of the sample.
 
✓ The number being evaluated against the sample.
 
✓ An indicator of how many decimal points to use in the returned answer. 
(This is an optional argument. If left out, three decimal points are used.)
PERCENTRANK.EXC is used when a rank between 0 and 100% (between 0 
and 1) is to be returned, but not 0 or 1. In Figure 9-16, the percent rank of 
the $4,800 value is calculated to be 82.3 percent (0.823). Therefore, $4,800 
ranks at the 82.3-percent position in the sample. The formula in cell F8 is 
=PERCENTRANK.INC(C3:C20,C9).
 
In the RANK.EQ function, the value being evaluated is the first argument, and 
the range of the values is the second argument. In the PERCENTRANK.INC 
function, the order of these arguments is reversed.
Follow these steps to use the PERCENTRANK.INC function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =PERCENTRANK.INC( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list of values, or enter the address of the 
range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click the cell that has the value you want to find the rank for, or enter 
its address.
 
 You can also just enter the actual value.

189
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
 
7. If you want to have more or less than three decimal points returned 
in the result, enter a comma (,) and then enter the number of desired 
decimal points.
 
8. Enter a closing parenthesis to end the function.
FREQUENCY
The FREQUENCY function places the count of values in a sample into bins. 
A bin represents a range of values, such as 0–1 or 20–29. Typically, the bins 
used in an analysis are the same size and cover the entire range of values. For 
example, if the data values range from 1–100, you might create ten bins each, 
ten units wide. The first bin would be for values of 1 to 10, the second bin 
would be for values of 11 to 20, and so forth.
Figure 9-17 illustrates this. There are 300 values in the range B3:B304. The 
values are random, between 1 and 100. Cells D3 through D12 have been set as 
bins that each cover a range of ten values. Note that, for each bin, its number 
is the top of the range it’s used for. For example, the 30 bin is used for hold-
ing the count of how many values fall between 21 and 30.
 
A bin holds the count of values within a numeric range — the number of 
values that fall into the range. The bin’s number is the top of its range.
 
Figure 9-17: 
Setting up 
bins to use 
with the 
FREQUENCY 
function.
 
FREQUENCY is an array function and requires specific steps to be used cor-
rectly. Here is how it’s done:
 
1. Enter a list of values.
 
 This can be a lengthy list and likely represents some observed data, 
such as the age of people using the library or the number of miles driven 
on the job. Obviously, you can use many types of observable data.

190
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
2. Determine the high and low values of the data.
 
 You can use the MAX and MIN functions for this.
 
3. Determine what your bins should be.
 
 This is subjective. For example, if the data has values from 1 to 100, you 
can use 10 bins that each cover a range of 10 values. Or you can use 20 
bins that each cover a range of 5 values. Or you can use 5 bins that each 
cover a range of 20 values.
 
4. Create a list of the bins by entering the high number of each bin’s 
range, as shown in cells D3:D12 in Figure 9-17.
 
5. Click the first cell where you want the output of FREQUENCY to be 
displayed.
 
6. Drag down to select the rest of the cells.
 
 There should now be a range of selected cells. The size of this range 
should match the number of bins. Figure 9-18 shows what the worksheet 
should look like at this step.

Hurray, you did it! You have entered an array function. All the cells in the 
range where FREQUENCY was entered have the same exact formula. The 
returned values in these cells are the count of values from the raw data that 
falls within the bins. This is called a frequency distribution.
Next, take this distribution and plot a curve from it:

MIN and MAX
Excel has two functions — MIN and MAX — that return the lowest and high-
est values in a set of data. These functions are simple to use. The functions 
take up to 255 arguments, which can be cells, ranges, or values.

193
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
Figure 9-22 shows a list of home sales. What are the highest and lowest 
values? Cell F4 displays the lowest price in the list of sales, with this for-
mula: =MIN(C4:C1000). Cell F6 displays the highest price with this formula: 
=MAX(C4:C1000).
 
Figure 9-22: 
Finding high 
and low 
values.
 
Here’s how to use the MIN or MAX function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter either =MIN( or =MAX( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
MIN and MAX return the upper and lower values of the data. What if you need 
to know the value of the second highest price? Or the third?
LARGE and SMALL
The LARGE and SMALL functions let you find out a value that is positioned at 
a certain point in the data. LARGE is used to find the value at a position that 
is offset from the highest value. SMALL is used to find the value at a position 
that is offset from the lowest value.

194
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Figure 9-22 displays the top five home sales, as well as the bottom five. Both 
the LARGE and SMALL functions take two arguments: the range of the data in 
which to find the value, and the position relative to the top or bottom.
The top five home sales are found by using LARGE. The highest sale, in cell 
F10, is returned with this formula: =LARGE(C$4:C$1000,1). Because the 
function used here is LARGE, and the second argument is 1, the function 
returns the value at the first position. By no coincidence, this value is also 
returned by the MAX function.
To find the second highest home sales, a 2 is entered as the second argument 
to LARGE. Cell F11 has this formula: =LARGE(C$4:C$1000,2). The third, 
fourth, and fifth largest home sales are returned in the same fashion, respec-
tively, using 3, 4, and 5 as the second argument.
The bottom five sales are returned in the same fashion but by using the SMALL 
function. For example, cell F22 has this formula: =SMALL(C$4:C$1000,1). 
The returned value, $143,339, matches the value returned with the MIN func-
tion. The cell just above it, F21, has this formula: =SMALL(C$4:C$1000,2).
Hey, wait! You may have noticed that the functions are looking down to row 
1000 for values, but the bottom listing is numbered as 60. An interesting thing 
to note in this example is that all the functions use row 1000 as the bottom 
row to look in, but this doesn’t mean there are that many listings. This is 
intentional. There are only 60 listings, for now. What happens when new sales 
are added to the bottom of the list? By giving the functions a considerably 
larger range than needed, we’ve built in the ability to handle a growing list. 
It’s interesting to see how the labels were created with regard to this.
The labels in cells E10:E14 (#1, #2, and so on) are just entered as is. Clearly, 
any ranking that starts from the top would begin with #1, proceed to #2, and 
so on.
However, the labels in cells E18:E22 (#56, #57, and so on) were created with 
formulas. The COUNT function is used to count the total number of listings. 
Even though the function looks down to row 1000, it only finds 60 listings, so 
that is the returned count. The #60 label is based on this count. The other 
labels (#59, #58, #57, and #56) are created by reducing the count by 1, 2, 3, 
and 4, respectively:
 
✓ The formula in cell E22 is =”# “ & COUNT(C$4:C$1000).
 
✓ The formula in cell E21 is =”# “ & COUNT(C$4:C$1000)-1.
 
✓ The formula in cell E20 is =”# “ & COUNT(C$4:C$1000)-2.
 
✓ The formula in cell E19 is =”# “ & COUNT(C$4:C$1000)-3.
 
✓ The formula in cell E18 is =”# “ & COUNT(C$4:C$1000)-4.

Here’s how to use the LARGE or SMALL function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter either =LARGE( or =SMALL( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a number indicating the position to return.
 
7. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
 
Use LARGE to find a value’s position relative to the highest value. Use SMALL 
to find a value’s position relative to the smallest value.
Going for the Count
The COUNT and COUNTIF functions return, well, a count. What else could it 
be with a name like that?
COUNT
COUNT is straightforward. It counts how many items are in a range of values. 
There is a catch, though: Only numeric values and dates are counted. Text 
values are not counted, nor are blank cells.
 
COUNTA works the same as COUNT, but it counts all cells that are not empty, 
including text cells.
To use the COUNT function:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =COUNT( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.

Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Figure 9-23 shows a list of popular movies along with the sales figure and the 
year for each movie. Cell F5 displays the count of movies, returned with the 
COUNT function. The formula in cell F5 is =COUNT(C5:C329).
Note that the range entered in the function looks at the sales figures for the 
movies. This is intentional. Sales figures are numerid. If COUNT used the 
range of movie titles, in Column B, the count would be 0 because this column 
contains text data.
 
Figure 9-23: 
Counting 
with and 
without 
criteria.
 
COUNTIF
The COUNTIF function is handy when you need to count how many 
items are in a list that meet a certain condition. In Figure 9-23, cell 
F7 shows the count of movies made in 2002. The formula in cell F7 is 
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,2002).
The COUNTIF function takes two arguments.
 
✓ The range address of the list to be counted
 
✓ The criterion
Table 9-1 presents some example of criteria for the COUNTIF function.

197
 Chapter 9: Throwing Statistics a Curve
Table 9-1 
Using Criteria with the COUNTIF Function
Example
Comment
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,”=2002”)
Returns the count of movies made in 
2002.
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,2002)
Returns the count of movies made in 
2002. Note that this is unique in that 
the criteria do not need to be in double 
quotes. This is because the criterion is 
a simple equality.
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,”<2002”)
Returns the count of movies made 
before 2002.
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,”>=2002”)
Returns the count of movies made in or 
after 2002.
=COUNTIF(D5:D329,”<>2002”)
Returns the count of movies not made 
in 2002.
The criteria can also be based on text. For example, COUNTIF can count all 
occurrences of Detroit in a list of business trips. You can use wildcards with 
COUNTIF. The asterisk (*) is used to represent any number of characters, 
and the question mark (?) is used to represent a single character.
As an example, using an asterisk after Batman returns the number of Batman 
movies found in Column B in Figure 9-23. A formula to do this looks like this: 
=COUNTIF(B5:B329,”Batman*”). Notice the asterisk after Batman. This 
lets the function count Batman and Robin, Batman Returns, and Batman 
Forever, along with just Batman.
Your criterion can be entered in a cell rather than directly in the COUNTIF 
function. Then just use the cell address in the function. For example, if you 
enter “Batman*” in cell C1, then =COUNTIF(B5:B329,C1) would have 
the same result as the previous example. Cell F11 in Figure 9-23 returns the 
count of movies that have earned more than $200,000,000. The formula is 
=COUNTIF(C5:C329,”>200000000”).
What if you need to determine the count of data items that match two condi-
tions? Can do! The formula in cell F15 returns the count of movies that were 
made in 2002 and earned more than $200,000,000. However, COUNTIF is not 
useful for this type of multiple condition count. Instead, the SUMPRODUCT 
function is used. The formula in cell F15 follows:
=SUMPRODUCT((C5:C329>200000000)*(D5:D329=2002))

198
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Believe it or not, this works. Although this formula looks like it’s multiply-
ing the number of movies that earned at least $200,000,000 by the number 
of movies made in 2002, it’s really returning the count of movies that meet 
the two conditions. (Quick trivia: Which two 1998 movies earned at least 
$200,000,000? The answer [drum roll, please]: Armageddon and Saving Private 
Ryan.)
To use the COUNTIF function, follow along:
 
1. Enter a list of numerical values.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =COUNTIF( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the list, or enter the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a condition and enclose the condition in double quotes.
 
 Use the following as needed:
 
• = (equal to)
 
• > (greater than)
 
• < (less than)
 
• * (wildcard)
 
• ? (wildcard)
 
• <> (not equal to)
 
7. Enter a ) and press the Enter key.
 
 The result is a count of cells that match the condition.
 
There is also a COUNTIFS function. This function allows using multiple ranges 
and criteria to return a count. COUNTIFS is quite similar to SUMIFS shown in 
Chapter 8.

W
hen you have data from a population, you can draw a sample and run 
your statistical analysis on the sample. You can also run the analysis 
on the population itself. Is the mean of the sample data the same as the mean 
of the whole population? You can calculate the mean of both the sample and 
the population and then know precisely how well the sample represents the 
population. Are the two means exact? Off a little bit? How much different?
The problem with this though is that getting the data of the entire population 
in the first place isn’t always feasible. On average, how many miles per gallon 
does a Toyota Camry get after five years on the road? You cannot answer this 
question to an exact degree because it’s impossible to test every Camry out 
there.
So instead we infer the answer. Testing a handful, or sample, of Camrys is 
certainly possible. Then the mean gas mileage of the sample is used to repre-
sent the mean gas mileage of all 5-year-old Camrys. The mean of the sample 
group will not necessarily match the mean of the population, but it is the best 
value that can be attained.
This type of statistical work is known as estimation, or inferential statistics. In 
this chapter, we show you the functions that work with the Student t-distribution, 
useful for gaining insight into the unknown population properties. This is the 
method of choice when using a small sample, say 30 data points or less.
The tests presented in this chapter deal with probabilities. If the result of a 
test — a t-test, for example — falls within a certain probability range, then 
the result is said to be significant. Outside that range, the result is considered 
nonsignificant. A common rule of thumb is to consider probabilities less than 
5 percent, or 0.05, to be significant, but exceptions to this rule exist.

200
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
The Student t-distribution has nothing to do with students. The originator of 
the method was not allowed to use his real name due to his employer’s rules. 
Instead, he used the name Student.
Testing to the T
The TTEST function returns the probability that two samples come from 
populations that have the same mean. For example, a comparison of the 
salaries of accountants and professors in New York City is underway. Are the 
salaries, overall (on average), the same for these two groups? Each group is a 
separate population, but if the means are the same, then the average salaries 
are the same.
Polling all the accountants and professors isn’t possible, so a sample of each 
is taken. Twenty-five random members of each group divulge their salary 
in the interest of the comparison. Figure 10-1 shows the salaries of the two 
groups, as well as the results of the TTEST function.
 
Student t-testing is generally used when the sample size is 30 items or fewer.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Comparing 
salaries.
 
The TTEST function returns 10.6 percent (0.106437) based on how the argu-
ments to the function were entered. This percentage says there is a 10.6-per-
cent probability that the mean of the underlying populations are the same. 
Said another way, this is the likelihood that the mean of all accountant sala-
ries in New York City matches the mean of all professor salaries in New York 
City. The formula in cell E8 is =TTEST(A2:A26,B2:B26,2,2).

201
 Chapter 10: Using Significance Tests
The arguments of the TTEST function are listed in Table 10-1.
Table 10-1 
Arguments of the TTEST Function
Argument
Comment
Array 1
This is the reference to the range of the first array 
of data.
Array 2
This is the reference to the range of the second 
array of data.
Tails
Either a 1 or 2. For a one-tailed test, enter a 1. For 
a 2-tailed test, enter a 2.
Type
Type of t-test to perform. The choice is a 1, 2, or 
3. A number 1 indicates a paired test. A number 2 
indicates a two-sample test with equal variance. 
A number 3 indicates a two-sample test with 
unequal variance.
The third argument of TTEST tells whether to conduct a one-tailed or two-
tailed test. A one-tailed test is used when there is a question of whether one 
set of data is specifically larger or smaller than the other. A two-tailed test is 
used to tell whether the two sets are just different from each other without 
specifying larger or smaller.
The first two arguments to TTEST are the ranges of the two sets of values. A 
pertinent consideration here is how the two sets of data are related. The sets 
could be comprised of elements that have a corresponding member in each 
set. For example, there could be a set of “before” data and a set of “after” data.
Seedling
Height at Week 1
Height at Week 2
#1
4 inches
5 inches
#2
33⁄4 inches
5 inches
#3
41⁄2 inches
51⁄2 inches
#4
5 inches
5 inches
This type of data is entered into the function as paired. In other words, each 
data value in the first sample is linked to a data value in the second sample. 
In this case, the link is due to the fact that the data values are “before” and 
“after” measurements from the same seedlings. Data can be paired in other 
ways. In the salary survey, for example, each accountant may be paired with 

202
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
a professor of the same age to ensure that length of time on the job does not 
affect the results — in this case, you would also use a paired t-test.
When you’re using TTEST for paired samples, the two ranges entered for the 
first and second arguments must be the same size. When you’re comparing 
two independent (unpaired) samples, the two samples don’t have to be the 
same size.
 
Use TTEST to determine the probability that two samples come from the same 
population.
Here’s how to use the TTEST function:
 
1. Enter two sets of data.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =TTEST( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the pointer over the first list, or enter the address of its range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the pointer over the second list, or enter the address of its range.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).
 
8. Enter a 1 for a one-tailed test, or enter a 2 for a two-tailed test.
 
9. Enter a comma (,).
 
10. Enter one of the following:
 
• 1 for a for a paired test
 
• 2 for a test of two samples with equal variance
 
• 3 for a test of two samples with unequal variance
 
11. Enter a ).
 
If you ever took a statistics course, you may recall that a t-test returns a 
t-value, which you then had to look up in a table to determine the associated 
probability. Excel’s TTEST function combines these two steps. It calculates 
the t-value internally and determines the probability. You never see the actual 
t-value, just the probability — which is what you’re interested in anyway!
The TDIST function returns the probability for a given t-value and degrees 
of freedom. You would use this function if you had a calculated t-value and 
wanted to determine the associated probability. Note that the TTEST func-
tion doesn’t return a t-value but rather a probability, so you wouldn’t use 
TDIST with the result that is returned by TTEST. Instead, you would use 

203
 Chapter 10: Using Significance Tests
TDIST if you had one or more t-values calculated elsewhere and needed to 
determine the associated probabilities.
TDIST takes three arguments:
 
✓ The t-value
 
✓ The degrees of freedom
 
✓ The number of tails (1 or 2)
A t-distribution is similar to a normal distribution. The plotted shape is a bell 
curve. However a t-distribution differs particularly in the thickness of the 
tails. How much so is dependent on the degrees of freedom. The degrees of 
freedom roughly relate to the number of elements in the sample, less one. 
All t-distributions are symmetrical around 0, as is the normal distribution. In 
practice, however, you always work with the right half of the curve — positive 
t-values.
To use the TDIST function, follow along:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =TDIST( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a value for t, or click a cell that has the value.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the degrees of freedom.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter one of the following:
 
• 1 for a one-tailed test
 
• 2 for a two-tailed test
 
8. Enter a ).
 
If the t-value is based on a paired test, then the degrees of freedom is equal 
to 1 less than the count of items in either sample (remember, the samples are 
the same size). When the t-value is based on two independent samples, then 
the degrees of freedom = (count of sample-1 items – 1) + (count of sample-2 
items – 1).
The TINV function produces the inverse of TDIST. That is, TINV takes two 
arguments — the probability and the degrees of freedom — and returns the 
value of t. To use TINV, follow along:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =TINV( to start the function.

204
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
3. Enter the probability value (or click on a cell that has the value).
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the degrees of freedom.
 
6. Enter a ).
Comparing Results to an Estimate
The Chi Square test is a statistical method for determining whether observed 
results are within an acceptable range compared with what the results were 
expected to be. In other words, the Chi Square is a test of how well a before 
and after compare. Did the observed results come close enough to the 
expected results that we can safely assume there is no real difference? Or 
were the observed and expected results far enough apart that we must con-
clude there is a real difference?
A good example is flipping a coin 100 times. The expected outcome is 50 
times heads, 50 times tails. Figure 10-2 shows how a Chi Square test statistic 
is calculated in a worksheet without using any functions.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Calculating 
a Chi 
Square.
 
Cells B5:B6 are the expected results — that heads and tails will each show 
up 50 times. Cells C5:C6 show the observed results. Heads appeared 44 
times, and tails appeared 56 times. With this information, here is how the Chi 
Square test statistic is calculated:
 
1. For each expected and observed pair, calculate the difference as 
(Expected – Observed).
 
2. Calculate the square of each difference as (Expected – Observed)2.
 
3. Divide the squares from the previous step by their respective 
expected values.
 
4. Sum the results of the previous step.

205
 Chapter 10: Using Significance Tests
Of course, a comprehensive equation can be used for the first three steps, 
such as =(expected - observed)^2/expected.
The result in this example is 1.44. This number — the Chi Square value — is 
then looked up in a table of Chi Square distribution values. This table is a 
matrix of degrees of freedom and confidence levels. Seeing where the calcu-
lated value is positioned in the table for the appropriate degrees of freedom 
(one less than the number of data points) will show you the probability that 
the difference between the expected and observed values is significant. That 
is, is the difference within a reasonable error of estimation or is it real (for 
example, caused by an unbalanced coin)?
 
The table of degrees of freedom and confidence levels is often found in the 
appendix of a statistics book or can be found on the Internet.
The CHISQ.TEST function returns the probability value (p) derived from the 
expected and observed ranges. There are two arguments to the function: the 
range of observed (or actual) values, and the range of expected values. These 
ranges must, of course, contain the same number of values, and they must be 
matched (first item in the expected list is associated with the first item in the 
observed list, and so on). Internally, the function takes the degrees of freedom 
into account, calculates the Chi Square statistic value, and computes the 
probability.
Use the CHISQ.TEST function this way:
 
1. Enter two ranges of values as expected and observed results.
 
2. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =CHISQ.TEST( to start the function.
 
4. Drag the cursor over the range of observed (actual) values, or enter 
the address of the range.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the cursor over the range of expected values, or enter the 
address of the range.
 
7. Enter a ).
Figure 10-3 shows a data set of expected and actual values. The Chi Square 
test statistic is calculated as before, delivering a value of 1.594017, seen in 
cell F12. The CHISQ.TEST function, in cell D14, returns a value of 0.953006566, 
the associated probability. Remember that CHISQ.TEST doesn’t return the 
Chi Square statistic but rather the associated probability.

206
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
Figure 10-3: 
Determining 
probability.
 
Now tie in a relationship between the manually calculated Chi Square and the 
value returned with CHISQ.TEST. If you looked up your manually calculated 
Chi Square value (1.59) in a Chi Square table for degrees of freedom of 6 (one 
less than the number of observations), you would find it associated with a 
probability value of 0.95. Of course, the CHISQ.TEST function does this for 
you, returning the probability value, which is what you’re after. But suppose 
you’ve manually calculated Chi Square values and want to know the associ-
ated probabilities. Do you have to use a table? Nope — the CHISQ.DIST.RT 
function comes to the rescue. And furthermore, if you have a probability and 
want to know the associated Chi Square value, you can use the CHISQ.INV.RT 
function.
 
The RT in the CHISQ.DIST.RT and CHISQ.INV.RT functions is the abbreviation 
for Right Tail — the functions in the configuration work with the right tail of 
the distribution.
Figure 10-3 demonstrates the CHISQ.DIST.RT and CHI.SQ.INV.RT functions 
as well. CHISQ.DIST.RT takes two arguments: a value to be evaluated for a 
distribution (the Chi Square value, 1.59 in our example), and the degrees of 
freedom (6 in the example). Cell D16 displays 0.953006566, which is the same 
probability value returned by the CHISQ.TEST function — just as it should be! 
The formula in cell D16 is =CHISQ.DIST.RT(F12,6).
CHISQ.TEST and CHISQ.DIST.RT both return the same probability value but 
calculate the result with different arguments. CHISQ.TEST uses the actual 
expected and observed values and internally calculates the test statistic to 
return the probability. This is done behind the scenes — just the probability 
is returned. CHISQ.DIST.RT needs the test statistic fed in as an argument.

207
 Chapter 10: Using Significance Tests
To use the CHISQ.DIST.RT function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =CHISQ.DIST.RT( to start the function.
 
3. Click the cell that has the Chi Square test statistic.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the degrees of freedom.
 
6. Enter a ).
The CHISQ.INV.RT function rounds out the list of Chi Square functions in 
Excel. CHISQ.INV.RT is the inverse of CHISQ.DIST.RT. That is, with a given 
probability and degrees of freedom number, CHISQ.INV.RT returns the Chi 
Square test statistic.
Cell D18 in Figure 10-3 has the formula =CHISQ.INV.RT(D14,6). This 
returns the value of the Chi Square: 1.594017094. CHISQ.INV.RT is useful then 
when you know the probability and degrees of freedom and need to deter-
mine the Chi Square test statistic value.
To use the CHISQ.INV.RT function, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =CHISQ.INV.RT( to start the function.
 
3. Click the cell that has the probability.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the degrees of freedom.
 
6. Enter a ).

W
hen analyzing data, one of the most important steps is usually to 
determine what model fits the data. No, we aren’t talking about a 
model car or model plane! This is a mathematical model or, put another way, 
a formula that describes the data. The question of a model is applicable for 
all data that comes in X-Y pairs, such as the following:
 
✓ Comparisons of weight and height measurements
 
✓ Data on salary versus educational level
 
✓ Number of fish feeding in a river by time of day
 
✓ Number of employees calling in sick as related to day of the week
Modeling
Suppose now that you plot all the data points on a chart — a scatter chart 
in Excel terminology. What does the pattern look like? If the data is linear, 
they’ll fall more or less along a straight line. If they fall along a curve rather 
than a straight line, they aren’t linear and are likely to be exponential. These 
two models — linear and exponential — are the two most commonly used 
models, and Excel provides you with functions to work with them.

210
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Linear model
In a linear model, the mathematical formula that models the data is as follows:
Y = mX + b
 
This tells you that for any X value, you calculate the Y value by multiplying X 
by a constant m, and then adding another constant b. The value m is called the 
line’s slope and b is the Y intercept (the value of Y when X = 0). This formula 
gives a perfectly straight line, and real-world data doesn’t fall right on such a 
line. The point is that the line, called the linear regression line, is the best fit 
for the data. The constants m and b are different for each data set.
Exponential model
In an exponential model, the following formula models the data:
Y = bmX
The values b and m are, again, constants. Many natural processes, includ-
ing bacterial growth and temperature change, are modeled by exponential 
curves. Figure 11-1 shows an example of an exponential curve. This curve is 
the result of the preceding formula when b = 2 and m = 1.03.
 
Again, b and m are constants that are different for each data set.

An 
exponential 
curve.

 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
Getting It Straight: Using SLOPE and 
INTERCEPT to Describe Linear Data
As we discuss earlier, many data sets can be modeled by a straight line — in 
other words, the data is linear. The line that models the data, known as the 
linear regression line, is characterized by its slope and its Y intercept. Excel 
provides the SLOPE and INTERCEPT functions to calculate the slope and Y 
intercept of the linear regression line for a set of data pairs.
The SLOPE and INTERCEPT functions both take the same two arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is a range or array containing the Y values of the 
data set.
 
✓ The second argument is a range or array containing the X values of the 
data set.
The two ranges must contain the same number of values; otherwise, an error 
occurs. Follow these steps to use either of these functions:
 
1. In a blank worksheet cell, enter =SLOPE( or =INTERCEPT( to start the 
function entry.
 
2. Drag the mouse over the range containing the Y data values, or enter 
the range address.
 
3. Enter a comma (,).
 
4. Drag the mouse over the range containing the X data values, or enter 
the range address.
 
5. Type a ) and press Enter.
 
When you know the slope and Y intercept of a linear regression line, you can 
calculate predicted values of Y for any X using the formula Y = mX + b where m 
is the slope and b is the Y intercept. But Excel’s FORECAST and TREND func-
tions can do this for you.
Knowing the slope and intercept of a linear regression line is one thing, but 
what can you do with this information? One very useful thing is to actually 
draw the linear regression line along with the data points. This method of 
graphical presentation is commonly used; it lets the viewer see how well the 
data fits the model.
To see how this is done, look at the worksheet in Figure 11-2. Columns A and 
B contain the X and Y data, and the chart shows a scatter plot of this data. 

212
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
It seems clear that the data is linear and that you can validly use SLOPE and 
INTERCEPT with them. The first step is to put these functions in the work-
sheet as follows. You can use any worksheet that has linear X-Y data in it.

 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
 
1. If necessary, add a new, empty column to the worksheet to the right of 
the Y value column.
 
 Do this by clicking any cell in the column immediately to the right of 
the Y value column, and then, on the Home ribbon, clicking the Insert 
button and selecting Insert Sheet Columns.
 
2. Place the cursor in this column in the same row as the first X value.
 
3. Enter an equal sign (=) to start a formula.
 
4. Click the cell where the SLOPE function is located to enter its address 
in the formula.
 
5. Press F4 to convert the address to an absolute reference.
 
 It displays with dollar signs.
 
6. Enter the multiplication symbol (*).
 
7. Click the cell containing the X value for that row.
 
8. Enter the addition symbol (+).
 
9. Click the cell containing the INTERCEPT function to enter its address 
in the formula.
 
10. Press F4 to convert the address to an absolute reference.
 
 It displays with dollar signs.
 
11. Press Enter to complete the formula.
 
12. Make sure the cursor is on the cell where you just entered the formula.
 
13. Press Ctrl + C to copy the formula to the clipboard.
 
14. Hold down the Shift key and press the ↓ key until the entire column is 
highlighted down to the row containing the last X value.
 
15. Press Enter to copy the formula to all selected cells.
At this point, the column of data you just created contains the Y values for 
the linear regression line. The final step is to create a chart that displays both 
the actual data as well as the computed regression line.
 
1. Highlight all three columns of data — the X values, the actual Y 
values, and the computed Y values.
 
2. Click the Insert tab on the Ribbon (shown in Figure 11-3).
 
3. Click the Scatter chart button.
 
4. Select the Scatter with Only Markers chart type.

What’s in the Future: Using FORECAST, 
TREND, and GROWTH to Make 
Predictions
The FORECAST function does just what its name suggests — it forecasts 
an unknown data value based on existing, known data values. The function 
is based on a single important assumption — that the data is linear. What 
exactly does this mean?

215
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
FORECAST
The data that FORECAST works with are in pairs — there’s an X value and a 
corresponding Y value in each pair. For example, perhaps you’re investigat-
ing the relationship between people’s heights and their weight. Each data 
pair would be one person’s height, the X value, and their weight, the Y value. 
Many kinds of data are in this form — sales by month, for example, or income 
as a function of educational level.
 
You can use the CORREL function to determine the degree of linear relation-
ship between two sets of data. See Chapter 9 to find out about the CORREL 
function.
To use the FORECAST function, you must have a set of X-Y data pairs. You 
then provide a new X value, and the function returns the Y value that would 
be associated with that X value based on the known data. The function takes 
three arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is the X value that you want a forecast for.
 
✓ The second argument is a range containing the known Y values.
 
✓ The third argument is a range containing the known X values.
Note that the X and Y ranges must have the same number of values or the 
function returns an error. The X and Y values in these ranges are assumed to 
be paired in order.
 
Don’t use FORECAST with data that isn’t linear. Doing so produces inaccurate 
results.
Now you can work through an example of using FORECAST to make a predic-
tion. Imagine that you’re the sales manager at a large corporation. You’ve 
noticed that the yearly sales results for each of your salespeople is related 
to the number of years of experience each has. You’ve hired a new salesman 
with 16 years of experience. How much in sales can you expect this person to 
make?
Figure 11-5 shows the existing data for salespeople — their years of experi-
ence and annual sales last year. This worksheet also contains a scatter chart 
of the data to show that it’s linear. It’s clear that the data points fall fairly well 
along a straight line. Follow along to create the prediction:
 
1. In a blank cell, enter =FORECAST( to start the function entry.
 
 The blank cell is C24 in Figure 11-5.
 
2. Enter 16, the X value that you want a prediction for.
 
3. Enter a comma (,).

216

4. Drag the mouse over the Y range, or enter the cell range.
 
 C3:C17 is the cell range in the example.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the mouse over the X range, or enter the cell range.
 
 B3:B17 is the cell range in the example.
 
7. Enter a ), and press Enter to complete the formula.
 
Figure 11-5: 
Forecasting 
sales.
 
After formatting the cell as Currency, the result shown in Figure 11-5 displays 
the prediction that your new salesman will make $27,093 in sales his first 
year. But remember: This is just a prediction and not a guarantee!
TREND
You just saw how the FORECAST function can predict a Y value for a known 
X based on an existing set of linear X-Y data. What if you have more than one 
X value to predict? Have no fear, TREND is here! What FORECAST does for a 
single X value, TREND does for a whole array of X values.
 
Like FORECAST, the TREND function is intended for working with linear data. 
If you try to use it with nonlinear data, the results will be incorrect.
The TREND function takes up to four arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is a range containing the known Y values.
 
✓ The second argument is a range containing the known X values.

217
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
 
✓ The third argument is a range containing the X values that you want pre-
dictions for.
 
✓ The fourth argument is a logical value. It tells the function whether to 
force the constant b to 0. If the fourth argument is TRUE or omitted, the 
linear regression line (used to predict Y values) is calculated normally. 
If this argument is FALSE, the linear regression line is calculated to go 
through the origin (where both X and Y are 0).
Note that the ranges of known X and Y values must be the same size (contain 
the same number of values).
TREND returns an array of values, one predicted Y for each X value. In other 
words, it’s an array function and must be treated as such. (See Chapter 3 for 
help with array functions.) Specifically, this means selecting the range where 
you want the array formula results, typing in the formula, and pressing Ctrl + 
Shift + Enter rather than pressing Enter alone to complete the formula.
When would you use the TREND function? Here’s an example: You’ve started 
a part-time business, and your income has grown steadily over the past 12 
months. The growth seems to be linear, and you want to predict how much 
you will earn in the coming six months. The TREND function is ideal for this 
situation. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. In a new worksheet, put the numbers 1 through 12, representing the 
past 12 months, in a column.
 
2. In the adjacent cells, place the income figure for each of these months.
 
3. Label this area Actual Data.
 
4. In another section of the worksheet, enter the numbers 13 through 18 
in a column to represent the upcoming six months.
 
5. In the column adjacent to the projected month numbers, select the six 
adjacent cells (empty at present) by dragging over them.
 
6. Type =TREND( to start the function entry.
 
7. Drag the mouse over the range of known Y values, or enter the range 
address.
 
 The known Y values are the income figures entered in Step 2.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Drag the mouse over the range of known X values, or enter the range 
address.
 
 The known X values are the numbers 1 through 12 entered in Step 1.
 
10. Enter a comma (,).
 
11. Drag the mouse over the list of month numbers for which you want 
projections (the numbers 13 through 18).
 
 These are the new X values.

218
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
12. Enter a ).
 
13. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to complete the formula.
When you’ve completed these steps, you’ll see the projected income figures, 
calculated by the TREND function, displayed in the worksheet. An example is 
shown in Figure 11-6. There’s no assurance you’ll have this income — but it 
may be even higher! You can always hope for the best.

TREND 
function to

GROWTH
The GROWTH function is like TREND in that it uses existing data to predict Y 
values for a set of X values. It’s different in that it’s designed for use with data 
that fits an exponential model. The function takes four arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is a range or array containing the known Y values.
 
✓ The second argument is a range or array containing the known X values.
 
✓ The third argument is a range or array containing the X values for which 
you want to calculate predicted Y values.
 
✓ The fourth value is omitted or TRUE if you want the constant b calcu-
lated normally. If this argument is FALSE, b is forced to 1. You won’t use 
FALSE except in special situations.
 
The number of known X and known Y values must be the same for the 
GROWTH function or an error occurs. As you’d expect, GROWTH is an array 
formula and must be entered accordingly.
To use the GROWTH function, follow these steps. Note: This assumes that 
you have a worksheet that already contains known X and Y values that fit the 
exponential model.

219
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
 
1. Enter the X values for which you want to predict Y values in a column 
of the worksheet.
 
2. Select a range of cells in a column that has the same number of rows 
as the X values you entered in Step 1.
 
 Often this range is in the column next to the X values, but it doesn’t have 
to be.
 
3. Enter =Growth( to start the function entry.
 
4. Drag the mouse over the range containing the known Y values, or 
enter the range address.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Drag the mouse over the range containing the known X values, or 
enter the range address.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).
 
8. Drag the mouse over the range containing the X values for which you 
want to predict Y values, or enter the range address.
 
9. Enter a ).
 
10. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to complete the formula.
Figure 11-7 shows an example of using the GROWTH function to forecast 
exponential data. Columns A and B contain the known data, and the range 
D10:D19 contains the X values for which predictions are desired. The 
GROWTH array formula was entered in E10:E19. The chart shows a scat-
ter plot of the actual data, up to X = 40, and the projected data, for X values 
above 40. You can see how the projected data continues the exponential 
curves that are fit by the actual data.

Part III: Solving with Statistics 
Using NORM.DIST and POISSON.DIST 
to Determine Probabilities
You can get a good introduction to the normal distribution in Chapter 9. To 
recap briefly, a normal distribution is characterized by its mean (the value 
in the middle of the distribution) and by its standard deviation (the extent to 
which values spread out on either side of the mean). The normal distribu-
tion is a continuous distribution, which means that X values can be fractional 
and aren’t restricted to integers. The normal distribution has a lot of uses 
because so many processes, both natural and human, follow it.
NORMDIST
 
The word normal in this context doesn’t mean “good” or “okay,” and a distri-
bution that is not normal is not flawed in some way. Normal is used simply to 
mean “typical” or “common.”
Excel provides you with the NORM.DIST function for calculating probabilities 
from a normal distribution. The function takes four arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is the value for which you want to calculate a 
probability.
 
✓ The second argument is the mean of the normal distribution.
 
✓ The third argument is the standard deviation of the normal distribution.
 
✓ The fourth argument is TRUE if you want the cumulative probability and 
FALSE if you want the noncumulative probability.
 
A cumulative probability is the chance of getting any value between 0 and the 
specified value. A noncumulative probability is the chance of getting exactly 
the specified value.
Normal distributions come into play for a wide variety of measurements. 
Examples include blood pressure, atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels, wave 
height, leaf size, and oven temperature. If you know the mean and standard 
deviation of a distribution, you can use NORM.DIST to calculate related 
probabilities.
Here’s an example: Your firm manufactures hardware, and a customer wants 
to buy a large quantity of 50mm bolts. Due to the manufacturing process, 
the length of bolts varies slightly. The customer will place the order only if 
at least 95 percent of the bolts are between 49.9mm and 50.1mm. Measuring 

221
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
each one isn’t practical, but previous data shows that the distribution of bolt 
lengths is a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 
0.05. You can use Excel and the NORM.DIST function to answer the question. 
Here’s the plan:
 
1. Use the NORM.DIST function to determine the cumulative probability 
of a bolt being at least 50.1mm long.
 
2. Use the NORM.DIST function to determine the cumulative probability 
of a bolt being at least 49.9mm long.
 
3. Subtract the second value from the first to get the probability that a 
bolt is between 49.9mm and 50.1mm long.
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. In a new worksheet, enter the values for the mean, standard devia-
tion, upper limit, and lower limit in separate cells.
 
 Optionally, add adjoining labels to identify the cells.
 
2. In another cell, enter =NORM.DIST( to start the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell containing the lower limit value (49.9) or enter the cell 
address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell containing the mean, or enter the cell address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell containing the standard deviation, or enter the cell 
address.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Enter TRUE).
 
10. Press Enter to complete the function.
 
 This cell now displays the probability of a bolt being less than or equal 
to the lower limit.
 
11. In another cell, enter =NORMDIST( to start the function entry.
 
12. Click the cell containing the upper-limit value (50.1), or enter the cell 
address.
 
13. Repeat Steps 4 through 10.
 
 This cell now displays the probability of a bolt being less than or equal 
to the upper limit.

222
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
14. In another cell, enter a formula that subtracts the lower-limit probabil-
ity from the upper-limit probability.
 
 This cell now displays the probability that a bolt will be within the speci-
fied limits.
Figure 11-8 shows a worksheet that was created to solve this problem. You 
can see from cell B8 that the answer is 0.9545 — in other words, 95.45 per-
cent of your bolts fall in the prescribed limits, and you can accept the cus-
tomer’s order. Note in this worksheet that the formulas in cells B6:B8 are 
presented in the adjacent cells so you can see what they look like.

POISSON.DIST
Poisson is another kind of distribution used in many areas of statistics. Its 
most common use is to model the number of events taking place in a speci-
fied time period. Suppose you were modeling the number of employees 
calling in sick each day, or the number of defective items produced at your 
factory each week. In these cases, the Poisson distribution is appropriate.
The Poisson distribution is useful for analyzing rare events. What exactly 
does rare mean? People calling in sick at work is hardly rare, but a specific 
number calling in sick is rare, at least statistically speaking. Situations where 
Poisson is applicable includes numbers of car accidents, counts of custom-
ers arriving, manufacturing defects, and the like. One way to express it is that 
the events are individually rare, but there are many opportunities for them to 
happen.
The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution. This means that the X 
values in the distribution can only take on specified, discrete values such as 
X = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on. This is different from the normal distribution, which 
is a continuous distribution in which X values can take any value (X = 0.034, 
1.2365, and so on). The discrete nature of the Poisson distribution is suited to 
the kinds of data you use it with. For example, with employees calling in sick, 
you may have 1, 5, or 8 on a given day, but certainly not 1.45, 7.2, or 9.15!

223
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
Figure 11-9 shows a Poisson distribution that has a mean of 20. Values on the 
X axis are number of occurrences (of whatever you’re studying), and values 
on the Y axis are probabilities. You can use this distribution to determine 
the probability of a specific number of occurrences happening. For example, 
this chart tells you that the probability of having exactly 15 occurrences is 
approximately 0.05 (5 percent).
 
Figure 11-9: 
A Poisson 
distribution 
with a mean 
of 20.
 
 
The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution and is used only with data 
that takes on discrete (integer) values, such as counting items.
A Poisson distribution is not always symmetrical, as is the one shown in 
Figure 11-9. Negative X values make no sense in a Poisson distribution. After 
all, you can’t have fewer than zero people calling in sick! If the mean is a small 
value, the distribution will be skewed, as shown in Figure 11-10 for a Poisson 
distribution with a mean of 4.
 
Figure 11-10: 
A Poisson 
distribution

of 4.
 

224
Part III: Solving with Statistics 
 
Excel’s POISSON.DIST function lets you calculate the probability that a speci-
fied number of events will occur. All you need to know is the mean of the dis-
tribution. This function can calculate the probability two ways:
 
✓ Cumulative: The probability that between 0 and X events will occur.
 
✓ Non-cumulative: The probability that exactly X events will occur.
The two Poisson graphs shown earlier were for noncumulative probabilities. 
Figure 11-11 shows the cumulative Poisson distribution corresponding to 
Figure 11-9. You can see from this chart that the cumulative probability of 15 
events — the probability of 15 or fewer events occurring — is about 0.15.
 
Figure 11-11: 
A cumula-
tive Poisson 
distribution 
with a mean 
of 20.
 
 
What if you want to calculate the probability that more than X events will 
occur? Simple! Just calculate the cumulative probability for X and subtract the 
result from 1.
The POISSON.DIST function takes three arguments:
 
✓ The first argument is the number of events that you want to calculate 
the probability for. This must be an integer value greater than 0.
 
✓ The second argument is the mean of the Poisson distribution to use. 
This too must be an integer value greater than 0.
 
✓ The third argument is TRUE if you want the cumulative probability and 
FALSE if you want the noncumulative probability.
For example, suppose that you’re the manager of a factory that makes brake 
shoes. Your district manager has announced an incentive: You’ll receive a 
bonus for each day that the number of defective shoes is less than 20. How 

225
 Chapter 11: Rolling the Dice on Predictions and Probability
many days a month will you meet this goal, knowing that the average number 
of defective brake shoes is 25 per day? Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. In a new worksheet, enter the average number of defects per day (25) 
in a cell.
 
 If desired, enter an adjacent label to identify the cell.
 
2. In the cell below, type =POISSON.DIST( to start the function entry.
 
3. Enter the value 20.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell where you entered the average defects per day, or enter 
its cell address.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter TRUE).
 
8. Press Enter to complete the formula.
 
9. If desired, enter a label in an adjacent cell to identify this as the prob-
ability of 20 or fewer defects.
 
10. In the cell below, enter a formula that multiplies the number of 
working days per month (22) by the result just calculated with the 
POISSON.DIST function.
 
 In our worksheet, this formula is =22*B3, entered in cell B4.
 
11. If desired, enter a label in an adjacent cell to identify this as the 
number of days per month you can expect to have 20 or fewer defects.
The finished worksheet is shown in Figure 11-12. In this example, we have for-
matted cells B3:B4 with two decimal places. You can see that with an average 
of 25 defects per day you can expect to earn a bonus 4 days a month.

Dressing Up for Date Functions
In This Chapter
▶ Handling dates
▶ Working with days, months, and years
▶ Getting the value of today
▶ Determining the day of the week
O
ften when working with Excel, you need to manage dates. Perhaps you 
have a list of dates when you visited a client and you need to count 
how many times you were there in September. On the other hand, maybe you 
are tracking a project over a few months and want to know how many days 
are in between the milestones.
Excel has a number of useful Date functions to make your work easier! This 
chapter explains how Excel handles dates, how to compare and subtract 
dates, how to work with parts of a date (such as the month or year), and 
even how to count the number of days between two dates. You can always 
reference the current data from your computer’s clock and use it in a calcula-
tion; we show you how.
Understanding How Excel Handles Dates
Imagine if, on January 1, 1900, you starting counting by ones, each day adding 
one more to the total. This is just how Excel thinks of dates. January 1, 1900, 
is one; January 2, 1900, is two; and so on. We’ll always remember 25,404 as 
the day man first walked on the moon, and 36,892 as the start of the new 
millennium!
 
The millennium actually started on January 1, 2001. The year 2000 is the last 
year of the 20th century. Representing dates as a serial number — specifically, 
the number of days between January 1, 1900, and the date in question — may 
seem odd, but there are very good reasons for it. Excel can handle dates from 
January 1, 1900, to December 31, 9999. Using the serial numbering system, 
that’s 1 through 2,958,465!

230
Part IV: Working with Data 
Because Excel represents dates in this way, it can work with dates in the 
same manner as numbers. For example, you can subtract one date from 
another to find out how many days are between them. Likewise, you can 
add 14 to today’s date to get a date two weeks in the future. This trick is 
very useful, but people are used to seeing dates represented in traditional 
formats, not as numbers. Fortunately, Excel uses date serial numbers only 
behind the scenes, and what you see in your workbook are dates in the stan-
dard date formats such as Jan 20, 2010, and 12/20/12.
 
In Excel for the Mac, the serial numbering system begins on January 1, 1904.
The way years are handled requires special mention. When a year is fully 
displayed in four digits, such as 2005, there is no ambiguity. However, when 
a date is written in a shorthand style, such as in 3/1/02, it isn’t clear what the 
year is. It could be 2002, or it could be 1902. Say 3/1/02 is a shorthand entry 
for someone’s birthday. Then on March 1, 2005, he is either 3 years old or 
103 years old. In those countries that write dates as dd/mm/yy, this would be 
January 3, 1902, or January 3, 2002.
Excel and the Windows operating system have a default way of interpret-
ing shorthand years. Windows 2000 and later has a setting in the Customize 
Regional Options dialog box found in the Control Panel. This setting guides 
how Excel will interpret years. If the setting is 1930 through 2029, then 3/1/02 
indicates the year 2002, but 3/1/45 indicates the year 1945, not 2045. Figure 12-1 
shows this setting.
Here’s how to open and set it:
 
1. Click your computer’s Start button.
 
2. Select Control Panel.
 
3. Select Regional and Language Options.
 
 The Regional and Language Options dialog box opens.
 
4. Select the Regional Options tab if it is not selected by default.
 
5. Click the Customize this format button.
 
 The Customize Regional Options dialog box appears.
 
6. Select the Date tab.
 
7. Enter a four-digit ending year (such as 2029) to indicate the latest year 
that will be used when interpreting a two-digit year.
 
8. Click OK to close each dialog box.
 
These steps may differ depending on which version of Windows is running on 
your computer.

To ensure full accuracy when working with dates, always enter the full four 
digits for the year.
Formatting Dates
When you work with dates, you’ll probably need to format cells in your work-
sheet. It’s great that Excel tells you that June 1, 2010, is serially represented 
as 40330, but you probably don’t want that on a report. To format dates, you 
use the Format Cells dialog box, shown in Figure 12-2. To format dates, follow 
these steps:
 
1. If not already displayed, click the Home tab at the top of the Excel 
screen.
 
2. Click the small arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Number section.
 
 The Format Cells dialog box appears, revealing the Number tab.
 
3. Select Date in the Category List.
 
4. Select an appropriate format from the Type List.
Now you can turn the useful but pesky serial dates into a user-friendly format.

Part IV: Working with Data 
 
When you enter a date into a cell using one of the standard date formats, Excel 
recognizes it as a date and automatically assigns a Date format to the cell. You 
may want to use the Number Format dialog box to assign a different Date 
format.

Making a Date with DATE
You can use the DATE function to create a complete date from separate year, 
month, and day information. The DATE function can be useful because dates 
don’t always appear as, well, dates, in a worksheet. You may have a column 
of values between 1 and 12 that represents the month, and another column of 
values between 1 and 31 for the day of the month. A third column may hold 
years — in either the two-digit shorthand or the full four digits.
The DATE function combines individual day, month, and year components 
into a single usable date. This makes using and referencing dates in your 
worksheet easy. Follow along to use the DATE function:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =DATE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the year.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).

233
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
 
5. Click the cell that has the number (1–12) that represents the month.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the number (1–31) that represents the day of the 
month.
 
8. Type a ), then press Enter.
Figure 12-3 displays a fourth column of dates that are created using DATE 
and the values from the first three columns. The fourth column of dates has 
been formatted so the dates are displayed in a standard format, not as a raw 
date serial number.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Using

a date from 
separate 
month, day, 
and year 
values.
 
DATE provides some extra flexibility with the month number. Negative 
month numbers are subtracted from the specified year. For example, the 
function =DATE(2006, -5, 15) returns the date July 15, 2005, because 
July 2005 is 5 months before the first month of 2006. Numbers greater than 
12 work the same way — =DATE(2001, 15, 1) returns March 1, 2002, 
because March 2002 is 15 months after the first month of 2001.
Day numbers work the same way. Negative day numbers are subtracted 
from the first of the specified month, and numbers that are greater than the 
last day of the specified month wrap into later months. Thus, =DATE(2002, 
2, 30) returns March 2, 2002, because February does not have 30 days. 
Likewise, =DATE(2002, 2, 40) returns March 12, 2002.

234
Part IV: Working with Data 
Breaking a Date with DAY, 
MONTH, and YEAR
That which can be put together can also be taken apart. In the preceding sec-
tion, we show you how to use the DATE function to create a date from sepa-
rate year, month, and day data. In this section, you find out how to do the 
reverse — split a date into individual year, month, and day components using 
the DAY, MONTH, and YEAR functions. In Figure 12-4, the dates in column A 
are split apart by day, month, and year, respectively, in Columns B, C, and D.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Splitting 
apart a 
date with 
the DAY, 
MONTH, 
and YEAR 
functions.
 
Isolating the day
Isolating the day part of a date is useful in applications where just the day, but 
not the month or year, is relevant. For example, say you own a store and want 
to figure out whether more customers come to shop in the first half or the 
second half of the month. You’re interested in this trend over several months. 
So the task may be to average the number of sales by the day of the month only.
The DAY function is useful for this because you can use it to return just the 
day for a lengthy list of dates. Then you can examine results by the day only.
Here’s how you use the DAY function:
 
1. Position the pointer in the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =DAY( to begin the function entry.

235
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
 
3. Click the cell that has the date.
 
4. Enter a ), then press Enter.
 
 Excel returns a number between 1 and 31.
Figure 12-5 shows how the DAY function can be used to analyze customer 
activity. Column A contains a full year’s sequential dates (most of which are 
not visible in the figure). In Column B, the day part of each date has been iso-
lated. Column C shows the customer traffic for each day.
 
Figure 12-5: 
Using the 
DAY 
function 
to analyze 
customer 
activity.
 
This is all the information that is needed to analyze whether there is a differ-
ence in the amount of customer traffic between the first half and second half 
of the month.
Cells E4 and E10 show the average daily customer traffic for the first half 
and second half of the month, respectively. The value for the first half of the 
month was obtained by adding all the customer values for day values in the 
range 1 to 15 and then dividing by the total number of days. The value for the 
second half of the month was done the same way but using day values in the 
range 16 to 31.
The day parts of the dates, in Column B, were key to these calculations:
 
✓ In cell E4 the calculation is =SUMIF(B2:B366,”<16”,C2:C366)/
COUNTIF(B2:B366”<16”).
 
✓ In cell E10 the calculation is =SUMIF(B2:B366,”>15”,C2:C366)/
COUNTIF(B2:B366,”>15”).
The SUMIF function is discussed in Chapter 8. The COUNTIF function is dis-
cussed in Chapter 9.

236
Part IV: Working with Data 
The DAY function has been instrumental in showing that more customers 
visit the fictitious store in the second half of the month. This type of informa-
tion is great for a store owner to plan staff assignments, sales specials, and 
so on.
Isolating the month
Isolating the month part of a date is useful in applications where just the 
month, but not the day or year, is relevant. For example, you may have a list 
of dates on which more than five of your employees call in sick and need to 
determine if this is more common in certain months than others.
You could sort the dates and then count the number for each month. That 
would be easy enough, but sorting may not be an option based on other 
requirements. Besides, why manually count when you have, right in front of 
you, one of the all-time greatest counting software programs ever made?
Figure 12-6 shows a worksheet in which the MONTH function has extracted 
the numeric month value (1–12) into Column B from the dates in Column 
A. Cell B2 contains the formula =MONTH(A2) and so on down the column. 
Columns C and D contain a summary of dates per month. The formula used in 
cell D3 is =COUNTIF($B$2:$B$260,1).
This counts the number of dates where the month value is 1 — in other 
words, January. Cells D4 through D14 contain similar formulas for month 
values 2 through 12. The figure’s data plot makes it clear that calling in sick 
is more prevalent in December and January. See Chapter 9 for information on 
the COUNTIF function.

237
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
Use the MONTH function this way:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =MONTH( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the date.
 
4. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
 Excel returns a number between 1 and 12.
Isolating the year
Isolating the year part of a date is useful in applications where just the year, 
but not the day or month, is relevant. In practice, this is less used than the 
DAY or MONTH functions because date data is often — though not always — 
from the same year.
Follow the steps to use the YEAR function:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =YEAR( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the date.
 
4. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
 Excel returns the four-digit year.
Converting a Date from Text
You may have data in your worksheet that looks like a date but is not rep-
resented as an Excel date value. For example, if you enter 01-14-07 in a cell, 
Excel would have no way of knowing whether this is January 14, 2004, or 
the code for your combination lock. If it looks like a date, you can use the 
DATEVALUE function to convert it into an Excel date value.
In practice, any standard date format entered into a cell is recognized by 
Excel as a date and converted accordingly. However, there may be cases, 
such as when text dates are imported from an external data source or data is 
copied and pasted into Excel, that you need DATEVALUE.
 
Why not enter dates as text data? Because although they may look fine, you 
can’t use them for any of Excel’s powerful date calculations without first con-
verting them to date values.

238
Part IV: Working with Data 
The DATEVALUE function recognizes almost all commonly used ways that 
dates are written. Here are some ways that you may enter August 5, 2005:
 
✓ 8/5/05
 
✓ 5-Aug-2005
 
✓ 2005/08/05
DATEVALUE can convert these and several other date representations to a 
date serial number.
After you’ve converted the dates to a date serial number, the dates can be 
used in other date formulas or to perform calculations as described in other 
parts of this chapter.
To use the DATEVALUE function, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the date serial number located.
 
2. Enter =DATEVALUE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the text format date.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 The result will be a date serial number, unless the cell where the result 
is displayed has already been set to a date format.
Figure 12-7 shows how some nonstandard dates in Column A have been con-
verted to serial numbers with the DATEVALUE function in column B. Then 
column C displays these serial numbers formatted as dates.
 
Figure 12-7: 
Converting 
dates into 
their serial 
equivalents 
with the

Did you notice something funny in Figure 12-7? Normally, you won’t be able to 
enter a value such as the one in cell A4 — 02-28-09 — without losing the lead-
ing 0. The cells in Column A had been changed to the Text format. This format 

239
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
tells Excel to leave your entry as is. The Text format is one of the choices in the 
Category list in the Format Cells dialog box. (Refer to Figure 12-2.)
Note also that the text date in cell A8, Feb 9 09, could not be converted by 
DATEVALUE so the function returns the error message #VALUE#. We did say 
Excel is great at recognizing dates, but we did not say it is perfect! In cases 
such as this, you have to format the date another way so DATEVALUE can 
recognize it.
Finding Out What TODAY Is
When working in Excel you often need to use the current date. Each time you 
print a worksheet, for example, you may want the day’s date to show. The 
TODAY function fills the bill perfectly for this. It simply returns the date from 
your computer’s internal clock. To use the TODAY function, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the pointer in the cell where you want the result.
 
2. Type =TODAY().
 
3. Press Enter to end the function.
That’s it! You now have the date from your computer. If your computer’s 
clock is not set correctly, don’t blame Excel. Like all dates in Excel, what you 
really end up with is a serial number, but the Date formatting displays the 
date in a readable fashion.
As with all functions in Excel, you can embed functions in other functions. 
For example, if you need to know just the current date’s month, you can com-
bine the TODAY function with the MONTH function, like this:
=MONTH(TODAY())
Counting the days until your birthday
After a certain age a lot of people wish their birthday would not come around 
so often, but if you still like birthdays you can use Excel to keep track of how 
many days are left. Entered in a cell, this formula tells you how many days 
are left until your birthday (assuming that your next birthday is May 5, 2007):
=DATE(2011,5,5) - TODAY()

240
Part IV: Working with Data 
Use the DATE function to enter the day, month, and year of your next birth-
day. This avoids having a shorthand entry, such as 5/5/2011, be interpreted 
as a mathematical operation on its own.
If the formula were =5/5/2011 – TODAY(), an incorrect answer would be 
calculated because this effectively says, “Divide 5 by 5, then divide that result 
by 2011, then subtract the serial number of today’s date.” The answer would 
be incorrect.
 
Using the DATE function to represent dates in which a mathematical opera-
tion is performed is a good idea.
Counting your age, in days
When your birthday finally rolls around, someone may ask how old you are. 
Maybe you’d rather not say. Here’s a way to respond, but in a way that leaves 
some doubt: Answer by saying how old you are in days!
Excel can help figure this out. All you have to do is count the number of days 
between your birth date and the current date. A simple formula tells you this:
=TODAY() - DATE(birth year, birth month, birth day)
Here’s an example, assuming your birthday is March 18, 1956: =TODAY() - 
DATE(1956, 3, 18).
Determining the Day of the Week
The Beatles wrote a song called “Eight Days a Week,” but for the rest of us 
seven days is the norm. The WEEKDAY function helps you figure out which 
day of the week a date falls on. Now you can figure out whether your next 
birthday falls on a Friday. Or, you can make sure a planned business meeting 
does not fall on a weekend.
Here is how you use the WEEKDAY function:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =WEEKDAY( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Select the cell that has the date you want to find out the weekday for.

241
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 WEEKDAY returns a number between 1 and 7. Table 12-1 shows what the 
returned number means.

WEEKDAY Returned Values

Don’t confuse the returned numbers with actual dates! Just because Table 
12-1 shows a value of 4 indicating Wednesday doesn’t mean the fourth of a 
month is a Wednesday. The values of the returned numbers are also a bit 
confusing because most people consider Monday, not Sunday, to be the first 
day of the week. You can go argue the point with Microsoft if you like! Or, 
better yet, you can include a second, optional, argument that tells WEEKDAY 
to return 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on:
=WEEKDAY(A1, 2)
 
The numbers 1 through 7, returned from the WEEKDAY function, are not the 
same as the first through seventh of the month.
The WEEKDAY function lets you extract interesting information from date-
related data. For example, maybe you’re on a diet and you’re keeping a tally 
of how many calories you consume each day for a month. Then you start 
wondering, “Am I eating more on weekends than on weekdays?” Figure 12-8 
shows a worksheet that calculates the average calories consumed on each 
day of the week over a month’s time. A quick glance at the results shows that 
Saturdays and Sundays are not your high-calorie-consumption days — rather, 
it’s Monday and Tuesday that you have to watch out for.

Working with Workdays
Most weeks have five workdays — Monday through Friday — and two week-
end days. I know; some weeks seem to have 20 workdays, but that’s just your 
imagination! Excel has two functions that let you perform workday-related 
calculations.
Determining workdays in a range of dates
The NETWORKDAYS function tells you how many working days are in a range 
of dates. Ever sit at your desk and stare at the calendar trying to count how 
many working days are left in the year? Excel can answer this vital question 
for you!
NETWORKDAYS counts the number of days, omitting Saturdays and Sundays, 
in a range of dates that you supply. You can add a list of dates that should 
not be counted, if you want. This optional list is where you can put holidays, 
vacation time, and so on.
Figure 12-9 shows an example using NETWORKDAYS. Cells C3 and C4 show 
the start and end dates, respectively. In this example, the start date is pro-
vided with the TODAY function. Therefore, the result will always reflect a 
count that starts from the current date. The end date is the last day of the 
year. The function in cell C6 is =NETWORKDAYS(C3,C4,C10:C23).
The function includes the cells that have the start and end dates. Then there 
is a range of cells — C10 through C23. These cells have dates that should 

243
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
not be counted in the total of workdays: holidays and vacation. You can put 
anything in here, but they do have to be Excel dates. If a date specified in this 
list falls on a workday, then NETWORKDAYS does not count it. If it falls on a 
weekend, it would not be counted anyway, so it is ignored.
 
Figure 12-9: 
Counting 
workdays

DAYS.
 
To use NETWORKDAYS, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =NETWORKDAYS( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the start date for the range of dates to be counted.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the number end date for the range of dates to 
be counted.
 
 If you want to add a list of dates to exclude, continue to Steps 6 and 7; 
otherwise, skip these and go to Step 8.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click and drag the pointer over the cells that have the dates to exclude.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 The result is a count of days, between the start and end dates, that do 
not fall on Saturday or Sunday and are not in an optional list of exclusion 
dates.

244
Part IV: Working with Data 
Workdays in the future
Sometimes you are given a deadline — or you may give it to someone else: 
“Have that back to me in 20 working days.” Fine, but what is the date 20 work-
ing days from now? The WORKDAY function comes to the rescue. You spec-
ify a start date, the number of working days, and an optional list of holidays 
that are not to be counted as working days. (This list works just the same as 
for the NETWORKDAYS function discussed in the previous section.)
To use WORKDAYS, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =WORKDAY( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the start date for the calculation.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the number of workdays, or enter the number 
directly in the formula.
 
 If you want to add a list of dates to exclude in the count, continue to 
Steps 6 and 7; otherwise, skip these and go to Step 8.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click and drag the pointer over the cells that have the dates to be 
excluded.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 The result is a date that is the specified number of workdays from the 
start date, not counting dates in the optional list of exclusion dates.
Calculating Time between Two Dates 
with the DATEDIF Function
Excel provides the DATEDIF function to calculate the number of days, 
months, or years between two dates. This is an undocumented function, that 
is, you will not see it in the Insert Function dialog box, and you cannot find 
it in the Excel Help system. Why is it undocumented? Beats us — but it sure 
can be useful! Impress your friends and co-workers. The only thing you have 
to do is remember how to enter it. Of course, we don’t mind if you keep this 
book around to look it up.

245
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up for Date Functions
DATEDIF takes three arguments:
 
✓ Start date
 
✓ End date
 
✓ Interval
The interval argument tells the function what type of result to return, summa-
rized in Table 12-2.

What It Means
Comment
“d”
Days
The count of inclusive days from the start date 
through the end date.
“m”
Months
The count of complete months between the 
dates. Only those months that fully occur 
between the dates are counted. For example, if 
the first date starts after the first of the month, 
then that first month is not included in the count. 
For the end date, even when it is the last day of 
the month, that month is not counted. See Figure 
12-10 for an example.
“y”
Years
The count of complete years between the dates. 
Only those years that fully occur between the 
dates are counted. For example, if the first date 
starts later than January 1, that first year is not 
included in the count. For the end date, even 
when it is December 31, that year is not counted. 
See Figure 12-10 for an example.

The count of inclusive days from the start date 
through then end date, but as if the two dates 
are in the same year. The year is ignored.
“ym”
Months excluding 
years
The count of complete months between the 
dates, but as if the two dates are in the same 
year. The year is ignored.

xcel has a superb handful of functions for working with times and per-
forming calculations on time values. You can analyze data to the hour, 
minute, or second. And Excel helps you get this done in a New York minute!
Understanding How Excel Handles Time
In the previous chapter, we explain how Excel uses a serial number system 
to work with dates. Well, guess what? The same system is used to work with 
time. The key difference is that, although dates are represented by the inte-
ger portion of a serial number, time is represented by the decimal portion.
What does this mean? Consider this: 38353. That is the serial number repre-
sentation for January 1, 2010. Notice, though, that there is no indication of 
the time of day. The assumed time then is 12 a.m. (midnight), the start of the 
day. You can, however, represent specific times if needed.
Excel uses the decimal side of the serial number to represent time as a fraction 
of the 24-hour day. Thus, 12 p.m. (noon) is 0.5, and 6 p.m. is 0.75. Table 13-1 
shows some more examples and reveals how dates and time information are 
combined in a single serial number.

248
Part IV: Working with Data 
Table 13-1 
How Excel Represents Time
Date and Time

40179.91667
January 1, 2010 11:59 p.m.
40179.99931
Time is represented in a decimal value — up to five digits to the right of the 
decimal point. A value of 0 is the equivalent of 12 a.m. A value of .5 is the 
equivalent of 12 p.m. — the midpoint of the day. The value of .99931 is the 
same as the 23rd hour and start of the 59th minute. A value of .99999 is the 
same as the 23rd hour, the 59th minute, and the 59th second — in other 
words, one second before the start of the next day.
Can you represent time without a date? You bet! Use a value less than 1 for 
this purpose. For example, the serial number 0.75 represents 6 p.m. with no 
date specified.
Representing time as a serial number provides the same advantages as it 
does for dates — the ability to add and subtract times. For example, given a 
date/time serial number, you can create the serial number for the date/time 
one and a half days later by adding 1.5 to it.
Formatting Time
When you work with time values, you’ll probably need to format cells in your 
worksheet so the times display in a standard format that people will under-
stand. The decimal numbers don’t make sense to us human folk. To format 
time, you use the Format Cells dialog box, shown in Figure 13-1. To format 
time, follow these steps:
 
1. If not already displayed, click the Home tab at the top of the Excel 
screen.
 
2. Click the small arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Number section.
 
 The Format Cells dialog box appears.

displayed.
 
 
You can display time a number of ways. Excel can format time so that hours in 
a day range from 1 a.m. to 12 a.m. and then 1 p.m. to 12 p.m. Alternatively, the 
hour can be between 0 and 23 with values 13 through 23 representing 1 p.m. 
through 11 p.m. The latter system, known to some as military time, is com-
monly used in computer systems.
Note that Excel stores a date and time together in a single serial number. 
Therefore, some of the formatting options in both the time and date catego-
ries display a complete date and time.
Keeping TIME
You can use the TIME function to combine hours, minutes, and seconds into 
a single usable value. Figuring out the serial number representation of a par-
ticular moment in time isn’t easy. Luckily, the TIME function does this for 
you. You provide an hour, minute, and second, and TIME tells you the serial 
value. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the result displayed.
 
2. Enter =TIME( to begin the function entry.

250
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
3. Click the cell that has the hour (0–23), or enter such a value.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click the cell that has the minute (0–59), or enter such a value.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click the cell that has the second (0–59), or enter such a value.
 
8. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
 The result is a decimal serial number, or a readable time if the cell is for-
matted properly.
You should be aware that the minute and second values “wrap.” A value of 
60 or greater for seconds wraps to the next minute — for example, 75 sec-
onds is interpreted as 1 minute 15 seconds. Likewise, a minutes value of 90 is 
interpreted as 1 hour 30 minutes. Hours wrap too — an hours value of 26 is 
interpreted as 2 a.m.
Text to Time with TIMEVALUE
If you enter a time in a standard format into a cell, Excel recognizes it as a 
time. It is converted to a serial number, and the cell is assigned the default 
time format. If, however, you are pasting or importing data from another 
application, you may encounter times in text format, such as “2:28 PM”. 
You can convert these to a time serial number using the TIMEVALUE func-
tion. Here’s how:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the result displayed.
 
2. Enter =TIMEVALUE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that contains the time in text format.
 
4. Type ) and press Enter.
 
TIMEVALUE works just with text. If the TIMEVALUE function returns the error 
code #VALUE#, it probably means one of two things:
 
✓ The time is in a text format that Excel does not recognize, such as 
“2:28PM” (no space before PM) instead of “2:28 PM”.
 
✓ The time is not actually in text format but is an Excel time serial number 
formatted to look that way. Change the cell format to General to check.

251
 Chapter 13: Keeping Well-Timed Functions
Deconstructing Time with HOUR, 
MINUTE, and SECOND
Any moment in time really is a combination of an hour, a minute, and a 
second. In the preceding section, we show you how the TIME function puts 
these three components together. In this section, we show you how to break 
them apart using the HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND functions. The worksheet 
in Figure 13-2 shows a date and time in several rows going down Column A. 
The same dates and times are shown in Column B, with a different format. 
Columns C, D, and E show the hour, minute, and second, respectively, from 
the values in Column A.
 
Note that if the date/time serial number contains a date part, then HOUR, 
MINUTE, and SECOND ignore it; all they care about is the time part.
 
Figure 13-2: 
Splitting

the HOUR, 
MINUTE,

functions.
 
Isolating the hour
Extracting the hour from a time is useful in applications that tally hourly 
events. A common use of this occurs in call centers. If you’ve ever responded 
to an infomercial or a pledge drive, you may realize that a group of workers 
wait for incoming phone calls such as the one you made (we hope you got 
a good bargain). A common metric in this type of business is the number of 
calls per hour.
Figure 13-3 shows a worksheet that summarizes calls per hour. Calls have 
been tracked for October 2010. The incoming call dates and times are listed 
in Column A. In Column B, the hour of each call has been isolated with the 
HOUR function. Column D is a summary of calls per hour, over the course of 
the month.

252
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 13-3: 
Using the 
HOUR 
function to 
summarize 
results.
 
In Figure 13-3 the values in Column D are calculated using the COUNTIF func-
tion. There is a COUNTIF for each hour from 10 a.m. through 11 p.m. Each 
COUNTIF looks at the range of numbers in Column B (the hours) and counts 
the values that match the criteria. Each COUNTIF uses a different hour value 
for its criteria. The following is an example:
=COUNTIF($B$3:$B$1100,”=16”)
Here is how to use the HOUR function:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the result displayed.
 
2. Enter =HOUR( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the full-time (or date/time) entry.
 
4. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
 Excel returns a number between 0 and 23.
Isolating the minute
Isolating the minute part of a time is necessary in applications that track 
activity down to the minute. A timed test is a perfect example. Remember in 
school when the teacher would yell, “Pencils down”?
Excel can easily calculate how long something takes by subtracting one time 
from another. In the case of a test, the MINUTE function helps with the cal-
culation because how long something took in minutes is being figured out. 
Figure 13-4 shows a list of times it took for students to take a test. All stu-
dents started the test at 10 a.m. Then, when each student finished, the time 
was noted. The test should have taken a student no more than 15 minutes.

253
 Chapter 13: Keeping Well-Timed Functions
 
Figure 13-4: 
Calculating 
minutes 
elapsed 
with the 
MINUTE 
function.
 
For each data row, Column D contains a formula that subtracts the minute 
in the end time, in Column C, from the start time, in Column B. This math 
operation is embedded in an IF statement. If the result is 15 or less, then Yes 
appears in column D; otherwise a No appears:
=IF(MINUTE(C3)-MINUTE(B3)<=15,”Yes”,”No”)
Like the HOUR function, the MINUTE function takes a single time or date/time 
reference as its argument.
Isolating the second
Isolating the second from a date value is useful in situations where highly 
accurate time calculations are needed. In practice, this isn’t a common 
requirement in Excel applications.
Follow these steps to use the SECOND function:
 
1. Position the pointer in the cell where you want the results displayed.
 
2. Enter =SECOND( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click the cell that has the time value, or enter a time value.
 
4. Enter a closing parenthesis to end the function, and press Enter.
Finding the Time NOW
Sometimes when working in Excel you may need to access the current time. 
For example, you may be working on a client project and need to know how 
much time you’ve spent on it. Use the NOW function when you first open the 
workbook, and use it again when finished. Subtracting one value from the 
other provides the elapsed time.

254
Part IV: Working with Data 
Here’s how to use the NOW function:
 
1. Select the cell where you want the result.
 
2. Type in =NOW().
 
3. Press Enter to end the function.
 
You must take one additional step to make the preceding NOW time calcula-
tion work. When you get the current time at the start, copy the value and then 
use Paste Special to paste it back as a value. This strategy prevents it from 
updating constantly to the current time. You can also do this by selecting the 
cell, clicking in the Formula Bar, and then pressing F9.
NOW provides not just the current time but also the current date. This is 
similar to the TODAY function. TODAY returns the current date — without 
the current time. NOW returns the full current date and time. See Chapter 12 
for more information on the TODAY function.
Calculating Elapsed Time over Days
Each day has 24 hours. Multiplying 24 by 7 tells us there are 168 hours in a 
week. How many hours are in a month? This is not as easy to tell. A month 
may have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
Counting elapsed time, in hours, could require a complex algorithm. While 
there is no single function in Excel for this task, you can combine a couple of 
functions in a formula to get the answer. This is another side benefit of the 
fact that Excel represents date/time values as serial numbers. This makes it 
easy to calculate the number of hours that have passed between two date/
time values.
Figure 13-5 shows a worksheet with start and end date/time values in two col-
umns. A third column shows the calculated number of elapsed hours for each 
start/end pair.
In Column A and Column B are dates and times. These dates and times are 
really just serial numbers with a decimal portion. Using the INT function, 
Excel counts the difference in days, even if the span pops over to a new year. 
Then the HOUR function is used to calculate the difference of the decimal 
portion. The formula for the first row is
 =(INT(B3)-INT(A3))*24 + HOUR(B3) - HOUR(A3).

255
 Chapter 13: Keeping Well-Timed Functions
 
Figure 13-5: 
Calculating 
elapsed 
time.
 
Each successive row has the same formula in Column C but with the cell ref-
erences pointed to the values on the row. The first part of the formula calcu-
lates the difference in days and multiplies this by 24 for the total number of 
hours in the number of days.
The trick is to correctly calculate the time between the start and end values. 
The hour portion of both the start and end values is determined with the 
HOUR function, and then one value is subtracted from the other. The result 
of this subtraction is added to the precalculated number of hours from the 
count of days. Note that minutes are ignored — perhaps you can figure out 
how to modify the formula to take seconds into account!

ecision, decisions! If one of your students gets an 88 on the test, is 
that a B+ or is it an A? If your company’s new product earns at least 
$15,000,000 in revenue, how much of a bonus should you give to the team? 
Or do you have to get to $20,000,000 before you do that? How does this affect 
the financial statements?
Excel cannot make decisions for you, but it can help you make better deci-
sions. Using functions, such as IF and CHOOSE, you can set up your work-
sheet to chart a course through the possibilities. Hey, things could be worse! 
Were it not for Excel, you might have to try the old Ouija board technique.
Excel also can help you find what you’re looking for. Looking for something 
in a large, complex worksheet can seem like the old needle-in-a-haystack 
routine. It’s okay to admit it. After all, it happens to the best of us! We’re here 
to help. In this chapter, we show you a slew of functions that make it easy to 
look up information that’s spread around the rows and columns.
Testing on One Condition
The IF function is like the Swiss Army knife of Excel functions. Really, it is 
used in many situations. Often you can use it with other functions, which we 

258
Part IV: Working with Data 
do often in this chapter. IF, structurally, is easy to understand. The function 
takes three arguments:
 
✓ A test that gives a true or false answer. For example, the test “is the 
value in cell A5 equal to the value in cell A8” can have 
only one of two possible answers, yes or no. In computer talk, that’s true 
or false. This is not a calculation, mind you, but a comparison.
 
✓ The data to be returned by the IF function if the test is true.
 
✓ The data to be returned by the IF function if the test is false.
Sounds easy enough. Here are some examples:
Function
Comment
=IF(D10>D20, D10, D20)
If the value in D10 is greater than the 
value in D20, then the value in D10 is 
returned because the test is true. If the 
value in D10 is not greater than — that 
is, smaller or equal to — the value in 
D20, then the value in D20 is returned. 
If the values in D10 and D20 are equal, 
the test returns false, and the value in 
D20 is returned.
=IF(D10>D20, “Good news!”, 
“Bad news!”)
If the value in D10 is greater than 
the value in D20, then the text “Good 
News!” is returned. Otherwise “Bad 
News!” is returned.
=IF(D10>D20, “”, “Bad 
news!”)
If the value in D10 is greater than the 
value in D20, then nothing is returned. 
Otherwise “Bad News!” is returned. 
Note that the second argument is a pair 
of empty quotes.
=IF(D10>D20, “Good news!”, 
“”)
If the value in D10 is greater than 
the value in D20, then “Good News!” 
is returned. Otherwise nothing is 
returned. Note that the third argument 
is empty quotes.
 
An important aspect to note about using IF: letting the second or third argu-
ment return nothing. An empty string is returned, and the best way to do this 
is to place two double quote marks together with nothing in the middle. The 
result is that the cell containing the IF function remains blank.

259
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
IF, therefore, lets you set up two results to return — one for when the test 
is true and another for when the test is false. Each result can be a number, 
some text, a function or formula, or even blank.
As seen in the previous example, a common use of IF is to see how two values 
compare to each other and return either one value or the other, depending 
on how you set up the test in the first argument.
IF is often used as a validation check to avoid errors. For example, suppose 
you have a financial worksheet that uses a variable percentage in its calcula-
tions. The user must enter this percentage each day, but it must never be 
greater than 10 percent. To avoid the chance of errors, you could use the 
IF function to display an error message in the adjacent cell if you mistak-
enly enter a value outside the permitted range. Assuming the percentage is 
entered in cell A3, here’s the required IF function:
=IF(A3>.1, “ERROR: the % in A3 TOO LARGE”, “”)
Figure 14-1 shows how IF can be put to good use in a business application. 
A fictitious store shop — Ken’s Guitars (kinda snappy, don’t you think?) — 
keeps tabs on inventory in an Excel worksheet.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Keeping 
an eye on 
inventory at 
the guitar 
shop.
 
Column D shows the inventory levels, and column E shows the reorder 
levels. It works this way: When a product’s inventory level is the same or 
less than the reorder level, it is time to order more of the product. (We don’t 
know about you, but we love the thought of being surrounded by a bunch of 
Stratoblasters!) The cells in column F contain a formula.

260
Part IV: Working with Data 
The formula in cell F8 is =IF(D8<=E8,”ORDER”,””). It says that if the 
number of Stratoblaster 9000 guitars in stock is the same or less than the 
reorder level, then return Order. If the number in stock is greater than the 
reorder level, then nothing is returned. Nothing is returned because three are 
in stock and the reorder level is two. In the next row, the number of Flying Xs 
is equal to the reorder level; therefore, cell F9 displays Order.
Using IF is easy:
 
1. Enter two values in a worksheet.
 
 These values should have some meaning to you, such as the inventory 
levels example in Figure 14-1.
 
2. Click the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
3. Enter =IF( to start the function.
 
4. Decide what test you want to perform.
 
 You can see whether the two values equal each other; whether one is 
larger than the other; whether subtracting one from the other is greater 
than, equal to, or less than 0; and so on. For example, to determine 
whether the first value equals the second value, click the first cell (or 
enter its address), enter an equal sign (=), and then click the second cell 
(or enter its address).
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter the result that should appear if the test is true.
 
 For example, enter “The values are equal”. Remember, text must be 
enclosed in quotes.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).
 
8. Enter the result that should appear if the test is false.
 
 For example, enter “The values are not equal”.
 
9. Enter a ), and press Enter.
The IF function can do a whole lot more. Nested IF functions give you a lot 
more flexibility in performing tests on your worksheet data. A bit of persever-
ance is necessary to get through this. Nested means that you can place an IF 
function inside another IF function. That is, the inner IF is placed where the 
true or false argument in the outer IF goes (or even use internal IFs for both 
of the arguments). Why would you do this?
The other night we were deciding where to go for dinner. We were consider-
ing Italian, and decided that if we went to an Italian place, and it served mani-
cotti, then we would have manicotti. Otherwise, we decided to just eat pizza.

261
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
Logically, this decision looks like this:
If the restaurant is Italian, then
If the restaurant serves manicotti, then
we will have manicotti
else
we will have pizza
 
This looks a lot like programming code. We have left out the End If state-
ments on purpose to avoid confusion because the IF function has no equiva-
lent value.
That’s it! Make note that the inner IF statement has a result for both the true 
and false possibilities. The outer IF does not. Here is the structure of this as 
nested Excel IF statements: =IF(Restaurant=Italian, IF(Restaurant 
serves manicotti, “manicotti”, “pizza”), “”). If the restaurant 
were not Italian, then it wouldn’t matter what we ate (as indicated by the 
third argument of the outer IF being empty).
 
You can nest up to 64 IF statements, although things are likely to get very com-
plicated once you go beyond 4 or 5.
You can apply a nested IF statement to increase the sophistication of the inven-
tory worksheet from Figure 14-1. Figure 14-2 has an additional column — Hot 
Item. A Hot Item can take three forms:
 
✓ If the inventory level is half or less of the reorder level and the last sale 
date is within the last 30 days, then this is a Hot Item. The point of view 
is that in 30 days or less the stock sold down to half or less than the 
reorder level. This means the inventory is turning over at a fast pace.
 
✓ If the inventory level is half or less of the reorder level and the last sale 
date is within the last 31–60 days, then this is a Warm Item. The point 
of view is that in 31–60 days the stock sold down to half or less than 
the reorder level. This means the inventory is turning over at a medium 
pace.
 
✓ If neither of the preceding two conditions is met, the item is not 
assigned any special status.
There are Hot Items and there are Warm Items. They both must meet the 
common criterion that the inventory is 50 percent or less of the reorder level. 
Only after this first condition is met does the second criterion — the number 
of days since the last order — come into play. Sounds like a nested IF to us! 
Here is the formula in cell G9:
=IF(D9<=(E9×0.5),IF(NOW()-C9<=30,”HOT!”,IF(NOW()-
C9<=60,”Warm!”,””)),””).
Okay, take a breath. We leave no Excel user behind!

262
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 14-2: 
Looking 
for hot 
inventory 
items.
 
The outer IF tests if the inventory in column D is equal to or less than half 
(50 percent) of the reorder level. The piece of the formula that does that is 
=IF(D9<=(E9×0.5). This test, of course, produces a true or false answer. If 
it is false, then the false part of the outer IF is taken (which is just an empty 
string found at the end of the formula: ,””)).
That leaves the whole middle part to wade through. Stay with it!
If the first test is true, then the true part of the outer IF is taken. It just so hap-
pens that this true part is another IF function:
IF(NOW()-C9<=30,”HOT!”,IF(NOW()-C9<=60,”Warm!”,””))
The first argument of the inner IF tests whether the number of days since the 
last order date (in column C) is less than or equal to 30. You do this by sub-
tracting the last order date from today, as obtained from the NOW function.
If the test is true, and the last order date is within the last 30 days, then HOT! 
is returned. A hot seller indeed! If the test is false then . . . wait, what’s this? 
Another IF function! Yes: an IF inside an IF inside an IF. If the number of days 
since the last order date is greater than 30, then the next nested IF tests 
whether the number of days is within the last 60 days:
IF(NOW()-C9<=60
If this test is true, then Warm! is returned. If the test is false, then nothing is 
returned.

263
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
A few key points about this triple-level IF statement:
 
✓ The IF that tests whether the number of elapsed days is 30 or fewer has 
a value to return if true (HOT!) and a value to return for false (whatever 
is returned by the next nested IF).
 
✓ The outer IF and the innermost IF return nothing when their test is false.
 
✓ On the surface, the test for 60 or fewer days also would catch a date 
that is 30 days or fewer since the last order date! This is not really what 
is meant to be. The test should be whether the number of elapsed days 
is 60 or fewer but more than 30! You do not have to actually spell it out 
this way because the formula got to the point of testing for the 60-day 
threshold only because the 30-day threshold already failed. Gotta watch 
out for these things!
Choosing the Right Value
The CHOOSE function is ideal for converting a value into a literal. In plain-
speak, this means turning a number, such as 4, into a word, such as April. 
CHOOSE takes up to 30 arguments. The first argument acts as key to the rest 
of the arguments. In fact, the other arguments do not get processed, per se, 
by the function. Instead, the function looks at the value of the first argument 
and, based on that value, returns one of its other arguments.
The first argument must be, or evaluate to, a number. This number, in turn, 
indicates which of the following arguments to return. For example, the follow-
ing returns Two: =CHOOSE(2, “One”, “Two”, “Three”).
 
The first argument is the number 2. This means that the function will return 
the second in the list of arguments following the first argument. But watch 
out — this is not the same as returning the second argument! It means to 
return the second argument not counting the first one.
Figure 14-3 shows a useful example of CHOOSE. Say you have a column of 
months that are in the numerical form (1 through 12). You need to have these 
displayed as the month names (January through December). CHOOSE to the 
rescue!
Cells C4:C15 contain formulas with the CHOOSE function. The formula in cell 
C4 follows:
=CHOOSE(B4,”January”, “February”, “March”, “April”, 
“May”, “June”, “July”, “August”, “September”, 
“October”, “November”, “December”)
Cell B4 contains the value 1, so the first argument starting in the list of pos-
sible returned strings (that is, “January”), is returned.

264
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 14-3: 
Choosing 
what to see.
 
 
CHOOSE is most often used to return meaningful text that relates to a number, 
such as returning the name of a month from its numeric value. But CHOOSE is 
not restricted to returning text strings. You can use it to return numbers.
Try it yourself! Here’s how:
 
1. Enter a list of numeric values into a worksheet column.
 
 These values should all be small, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on.
 
2. Click the cell to the right of the first value.
 
3. Enter =CHOOSE( to start the function.
 
4. Click the cell to the left (the one that has the first value).
 
 Or you can enter its address.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Enter a list of text strings that each have an association with the num-
bers entered in Step 1.
 
 Each text string should be in double quotes and separated with commas 
(for example, “January”, “February”, “March”).
 
7. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 The cell to the right of the first item displays the returned text.
 
8. Use the fill handle from the first cell with the formula, and drag the 
formula down to all the other cells adjacent to list entries.
Let’s Be Logical
We once worked on a grammar problem that provided a paragraph with no 
punctuation and asked that the punctuation be added:
That that is is not that that is not is not that it it is

265
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
The answer follows:
That that is, is not that that is not. Is not that it? It is.
So true! That that is, such as an apple, is not that that is not, such as an 
orange. (Is your head spinning yet?)
NOT
NOT is a logical operator. It is used to reverse a logical value, turning true to 
false or false to true.
Enter this formula into a cell:
 = 5 + 5 = 10
The result is the word TRUE. Makes sense. The math checks out. Now try 
this:
=NOT(5 + 5 = 10)
What happens? The word false is returned.
The NOT function provides greater flexibility when designing the test por-
tion of a SUMIF function (which you read about in Chapter 8). Sometimes it 
is easier to define what you want omitted from the sum than to define what 
you want included. Figure 14-4 shows an example of how this works. The task 
is to sum up all orders except those in June. Column A lists the months, and 
column C lists the amounts.
 
Figure 14-4: 
Being 
selective 
with 
summing.
 

266
Part IV: Working with Data 
Cell C22 calculates the full sum with this formula:
=SUM(C2:C20)
The total is $3,122.
On the other hand, the formula in cell C24 is:
{=SUM(IF(NOT(A2:A20=”June”),C2:C20,””))}
This says to sum values in the range C2:C20 only for where the associated 
month in column A is not June.
 
Note that this formula is an array formula. When entered, the entry was com-
pleted with Ctrl+Shift+Enter instead of just plain Enter. See Chapter 3 for more 
information on array formulas.
AND and OR
Next are the AND and OR functions. AND and OR both return a single logical 
answer — either true or false — based on the values of two or more logical 
tests (such as the way IF works):
 
✓ The AND function returns true if all the tests are true. Otherwise, false is 
returned.
 
✓ The OR function returns true if any one or more of the tests is true. 
Otherwise, false is returned.
The syntax of both AND and OR is to place the tests inside the function’s 
parentheses; the tests themselves are separated by commas. Here is an 
example that returns true if the value in cell D10 equals 20 or 30 or 40:
=OR(D10=20,D10=30,D10=40)
Check out how this works. In Figure 14-3, you see how you can use the 
CHOOSE function to return the name of a month derived from the number of 
the month. That works okay, but what if you type a wrong number or even a 
non-numerical value as the first argument in CHOOSE?
As is, the CHOOSE function shown in Figure 14-3 returns the #VALUE! error if 
the first argument is a number greater or less than the number of arguments 
(not counting the first argument). So, as is, the function only works when the 
first argument evaluates to a number between 1 and 12. If only life were that 
perfect!

267
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
The next best thing, then, is to include a little validation in the function. 
Think this through. Both statements must be true:
 
✓ The first argument must be greater than 0.
 
✓ The first argument must be less than 13.
The formula that uses CHOOSE needs an overhaul, and here it is, courtesy of 
the AND function:
=IF(AND(B4>0,B4<13),CHOOSE(B4,”January”, “February”, 
“March”, “April”, “May”, “June”, “July”, 
“August”, “September”, “October”, “November”, 
“December”),”That is not a month!”)
Wow, that’s a mouthful (or rather, a cell-full). The CHOOSE function is still 
there, but it is nested inside an IF. The IF has a test (which is explained 
shortly). If the test returns true, then the CHOOSE function returns the name 
of the month. If the IF test returns false, then a simple That is not a 
month! message is returned. Figure 14-5 shows this in action.
 
Figure 14-5: 
Being 
logical 
about what 
to choose.
 
The test part of the IF function is this:
AND(B4>0,B4<13)
The AND returns true if the value in Cell B4 is both greater than 0 and less 
than 13. When that happens, the true part of the IF statement is taken, which 
uses the CHOOSE statement to return a month name. Otherwise the “That 
is not a month!” statement is displayed. In Figure 14-5 this is just what 
happens in cells C9 and C15, which, respectively, look at the data values in 
cells B9 and B15.

268
Part IV: Working with Data 
Can you figure out how to accomplish the same thing using OR instead of 
AND? Think for a moment and then look at the answer here:
=IF(OR(B4<1,B4>12),”That is not a month!”, 
CHOOSE(B4,”January”, “February”, “March”, 
“April”, “May”, “June”, “July”, “August”, 
“September”, “October”, “November”, 
“December”))
 
AND returns true when every condition is true. OR returns true when any 
condition is true.
Here’s how to use AND or OR:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter either =AND( or =OR( to start the function.
 
3. Enter one or more logical tests.
 
 A test typically is a comparison of values in two cells or an equation, 
such as A1 = B1 or A1 + B1 = C1. Separate the tests with commas.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 If you enter the AND function, the result is true if all the tests are true. If 
you enter the OR function, the result is true if at least one of the tests is 
true.
Finding Where It Is
You can find a plethora of things with the ADDRESS, ROW, ROWS, COLUMN, 
COLUMNS, and OFFSET functions.
ADDRESS
The ADDRESS function takes a row number and a column number as argu-
ments and returns a standard cell reference (cell address). For example, if 
you pass the row number 4 and the column number 3, the function returns 
C4. ADDRESS can return an absolute or relative reference in either of Excel’s 
two reference formats. Before getting to the details, review the differences 
between absolute and relative cell references.
 
✓ A relative reference is expressed as just the column letter and row number 
(for example, M290). When you copy a formula that contains a relative cell 
reference, the reference — the row number and the column letter — is 
adjusted to reflect the location to which you copied the formula.

269
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
 
✓ An absolute reference has a dollar sign in front of the column letter and 
the row number (for example, $M$290). When you copy a formula that 
contains an absolute cell reference, the reference does not change.
 
✓ A partial absolute reference has a dollar sign in front of the column letter 
or the row number (for example, $M290 or M$290). When you copy a for-
mula that contains a partial absolute cell reference, the part of the refer-
ence with the dollar sign does not change, but the other part does.
Figure 14-6 shows a worksheet in which entering a formula with a completely 
relative cell reference causes a problem. Totals are the result of adding the 
tax to the amount. The tax is a percentage (0.075) for a 7.5-percent tax rate. 
This percentage is in cell C1 and is referenced by the formulas. The first for-
mula that was entered is in cell C7 and looks like this: =B7×(1 + C1).
The formula in cell C7 works correctly. It references cell C1 to calculate the 
total. But if you use the fill handle to copy the formula from cell C7 to cells 
C8 and C9, there’s a problem. The reference to cell C1 changed to cell C2 and 
C3. Since these cells are empty, the results in cells C8 and C9 are incorrect — 
they are the same as the amounts to the left. (No tax is added.)
 
Figure 14-6: 
Changing a 
reference 
from relative 
to absolute.
 
To better understand, column D displays the formulas that are in column C. 
When the formula in cell C7 was dragged down, the C1 reference changed 
to C2 in cell C8, and to C3 in cell C9. Often this is what you want — for Excel 
to automatically change cell references when a formula is copied. But some-
times, as in this situation, it is not what you want. You need an absolute cell 
reference.

270
Part IV: Working with Data 
The formula is cell C17 is almost identical to the one in cell C7 except that the 
reference to cell C1 has been made row absolute by placing a dollar sign in 
front of the row number. The formula in cell C17 looks like this: =B17×(1 + 
C$1). When this formula was dragged down into C18 and C19, the reference 
was not adjusted but stayed pointing at cell C1. Note that in this example 
only the row part of the reference is made absolute. That’s all that is neces-
sary. You could have make the reference completely absolute by doing this: 
=B17×(1 + $C$1) and the result would be the same, but it’s not required in 
this example.
 
Put a dollar sign in front of the column letter of a cell reference to create an 
absolute column reference. Put a dollar sign in front of the row number to 
create an absolute row reference.
Excel supports two cell reference styles: the good old A1 style and the R1C1 
style. You see the A1 style — a column letter followed by a row number — 
throughout this book (D4 or B2:B10, for example). The R1C1 style uses a 
numerical system for both the row and the column, such as this: R4C10 — 
literally, Row 4 Column 10 in this example.
Now get back to the ADDRESS function. It takes up to five arguments:
 
✓ The row number of the reference.
 
✓ The column number of the reference.
 
✓ A number that tells the function how to return the reference. The default 
is 1, but can be
 
• 1 for full absolute
 
• 2 for absolute row and relative column
 
• 3 for relative row and absolute column
 
• 4 for full relative
 
✓ A value of 0 or 1 to tell the function which reference style to use.
 
• 0 uses the R1C1 style.
 
• 1 (the default if omitted) uses the A1 style.
 
✓ A worksheet or external workbook and worksheet reference.
Only the first two arguments are required. These are the row number and 
column number being addressed. The function returns the specified refer-
ence as text. Table 14-1 shows a few examples of using the ADDRESS function.

Sheet4!R5C2
This returns an R1C1 
style reference to B5 
on Sheet 4.

272
Part IV: Working with Data 
Use ADDRESS this way:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =ADDRESS( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a row number, a comma (,), and a column number.
 
 You can also enter references to cells where those values are located.
 
4. If you want the result to be returned in a mixed or full reference, then 
enter a comma (,) and the appropriate number: 2, 3, or 4.
 
5. If you want the result to be returned in R1C1 style, then enter a 
comma (,) and enter 0.
 
6. If you want the result to be a reference to another worksheet, then 
enter a comma and put the name of the worksheet in double quote 
marks.
 
 Or, if you want the result to be a reference to an external workbook, 
then enter a comma and enter the workbook name and worksheet name 
together. The workbook name goes in brackets, and the entire reference 
goes in double quote marks, such as this: “[Book1]Sheet2”.
 
7. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
Instead of directly entering a row number and column number into ADDRESS, 
you can enter cell references. However, the values you find in those cells must 
evaluate to numbers that can be used as a row number and column number.
ROW, ROWS, COLUMN, and COLUMNS
The ADDRESS function is rarely used on its own. Most often it is used as part 
of a more complex formula. A useful example of ADDRESS follows the discus-
sion of ROW, ROWS, COLUMN, and COLUMNS.
ROW and COLUMN are passed a reference to a cell or range and return the 
row number or the column number, respectively. Sounds simple enough. 
These functions take a single optional argument. The argument is a reference 
to a cell or range. The function returns the associated row number or column 
number. When the reference is a range, it is the first cell of the range (the 
upper left) that is used by the function.
ROW and COLUMN are particularly useful when the argument is a name 
(for a named area). When you use ROW or COLUMN without an argument, it 
returns the row number or column number of the cell the function is in. What 
the point of that is, we don’t know. Here are examples of ROW and COLUMN:

273

=ROW(D3)

=ROW(D3:G15)

4
=COLUMN(D3:G15)

=ROW(Team_Scores)
The first row of the Team_Scores range
=COLUMN(Team_Scores)
The first column of the Team_Scores range
The ROWS and COLUMNS functions (notice these are now plural), respec-
tively, return the number of rows or the number of columns in a reference:
Formula
Result
=ROWS(Team_Scores)
Number of rows in the Team_Scores range
=COLUMNS(Team_Scores)
Number of columns in the Team_Scores range
Now you are getting somewhere. You can use these functions with ADDRESS 
to do something useful. Here’s the scenario: You have a named range in 
which the bottom row has summary information, such as averages. You need 
to get at the bottom row but don’t know the actual row number. Figure 14-7 
shows this situation. The Team_Scores range is B3:C9. Row 9 contains the 
average score. You need that value in a calculation, even if another team is 
added to the list and the row number changes.
 
Figure 14-7: 
Using 
reference 
functions to 
find a value.
 

274
Part IV: Working with Data 
Cell B12 uses a combination of ADDRESS, ROW, ROWS, and COLUMN to 
determine the cell address where the average score is calculated. That for-
mula follows:
=ADDRESS(ROW(Team_Scores) + ROWS(Team_Scores) - 1, 
COLUMN(Team_Scores) + 1)
 
✓ ROW returns the row number of the first cell of Team_Scores. That row 
number is 3.
 
✓ ROWS returns the number of rows in the named range. That count is 7.
Adding these two numbers is not quite right. A 1 is subtracted from that total to 
give the last row (9). In this example, you need only COLUMN to get the column 
number because it understood that the range’s second column is the column of 
scores. In other words, you have no idea how many rows the range has, so ROW 
and ROWS are both used, but you do know the scores are in the range’s second 
column. This tells you that cell C9 contains the average score. Now what?
Cell B16 contains an IF that uses the address to perform its calculation:
=IF(ADDRESS(ROW(Team_Scores) + ROWS(Team_Scores) - 
1, COLUMN(Team_Scores) + 1)>100,”Great 
Teamwork!”,”Try again”)
The IF function tests whether the average score is greater than 100. If it is, 
then the “Great Teamwork!” message is displayed. This test is possible 
because the ADDRESS, ROW, ROWS, and COLUMN functions all help give the 
IF function the address of the cell where the average score is calculated.
Using ROW, ROWS, COLUMN, or COLUMNS is easy. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =ROW(, =ROWS(,=COLUMN(, or =COLUMNS( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a reference or drag the mouse over an area of the worksheet.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
Again, these functions are rarely used alone, but are almost always used in a 
more complex formula as in the example just presented.
OFFSET
The OFFSET function lets you get the address of the cell that is offset from 
another cell by a certain number of rows and/or columns. For example, cell 
E4 is offset from cell B4 by three columns because it is three columns to the 
right. OFFSET takes up to five arguments. The first three are required:

275
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
 
✓ A cell address or a range address: Named ranges are not allowed here.
 
✓ The number of rows to offset: This can be a positive or negative 
number. Use 0 for no row offset.
 
✓ The number of columns to offset: This can be a positive or negative 
number. Use 0 for no column offset.
 
✓ The number of rows in the returned range: The default is the number 
of rows in the reference range (the first argument).
 
✓ The number of columns to return: The default is the number of col-
umns in the reference range.
If you omit the last two arguments, then OFFSET returns a reference to a 
single cell. If you include a value greater than 1 for either or both, then the 
function’s return references a range of the specified size with the top-left cell 
at the specified offset.
Figure 14-8 shows some examples of using OFFSET. Columns A through C 
contain a ranking of the states in the United States by size in square miles. 
Column E shows how OFFSET has returned different values from cells that 
are offset from cell A3. Some highlights follow:
 
✓ Cell E4 returns the value of cell A3 because both the row and column 
offset is set to 0: =OFFSET(A3,0,0).
 
✓ Cell E7 returns the value you find in cell A1 (the value also is A1). This 
is because the row offset is –2. From the perspective of A3, minus two 
rows is row number 1: =OFFSET(A3,-2,0).
 
✓ Cell E8 displays an error because OFFSET is attempting to reference a 
column that is less than the first column: =OFFSET(A3,0,-2).
 
✓ Cell E10 makes use of the two optional OFFSET arguments to 
tell the SUM function to calculate the sum of the range C4:C53: 
=SUM(OFFSET(A3,1,2,50,1)).
Here’s how to use the OFFSET function:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =OFFSET( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a cell address or click on a cell to get its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the number of rows you want to offset where the function looks 
for a value.
 
 This number can be a positive number, a negative number, or just 0 for 
no offset.

276
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter the number of columns you want to offset where the function 
looks for a value.
 
 This can be a positive number, a negative number, or just 0 for no offset.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.
OFFSET is another of those functions that can be used alone but is usually 
used as part of a more complex formula.

Looking It Up
Excel has a neat group of functions that let you extract data from lists and 
tables. What is a table? A table is a dedicated matrix of rows and columns 
that collectively form a cohesive group of data. Tables usually have labels 
in the top row or the left column that identify the columns and rows of data. 
The remainder of the table contains the data itself.
HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP
The HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions extract the data from a particular 
cell in a table. HLOOKUP starts by searching across the first row of the table 
to find a value that you specify. When it finds that value, it goes down the 
column a specified number of rows and returns the value in the target cell. 
VLOOKUP works the same way except that it searches down the first column 
of the table and then moves across a specified number of columns.

277
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
HLOOKUP takes four arguments; the first three are required:
 
✓ The value to find in the top row of the table: This can be text or a 
number.
 
✓ The address of the table itself: This is either a range address or a 
named range.
 
✓ The row offset from the top row: This is not a fixed row number but 
rather the number of rows relative from the top row.
 
✓ A true or false value: If true (or omitted), a partial match is acceptable 
for step 1. If false, only an exact match is allowed.
Figure 14-9 shows how HLOOKUP pulls values from a table and displays them 
elsewhere in the worksheet. This function is quite useful if you need to print 
a report with a dedicated print area and must include some, but not all, of 
the data in the table. This example uses the HLOOKUP function to extract the 
desired data and display it for printing.
 
Why not just use a cell reference to the table cell that contains the desired 
data? A cell reference will not return the correct data if the table is moved or 
if one or more columns are added. With HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP you know 
you’ll always get data from the correct column or row.
 
Figure 14-9: 
Using 
HLOOKUP to 
locate data 
in a table.
 
In Figure 14-9 the table is the range B20:H21, which has been assigned the 
name Daily_Results. Each cell in the range C6:C12 uses HLOOKUP to locate a 
specific value in the table. For example, cell C6 has this formula:
HLOOKUP(“Monday”,Daily_Results,2,FALSE)

278
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
✓ The first argument: Tells the function to search for Monday in the first 
row of the table.
 
✓ The second argument: The table itself is specified by its assigned name.
 
✓ The third argument: Tells the function to return the data in the second 
row of the specified column. While this table has just two rows, there is 
no effective size limit to the table you use with HLOOKUP.
 
✓ The fourth argument: Specifies that an exact match for Monday must 
be found. If you set this argument to true or omit it, HLOOKUP finds an 
approximate match. For approximate matching to work properly, the 
values in the row must be sorted, left to right, in ascending order.
VLOOKUP works in the same way, except that it finds a value in the first 
column of the table and then moves over a specified number of columns. The 
arguments follow:
 
✓ The value to find in the leftmost column of the table.
 
✓ The address of the table itself: This is either a range or a named area.
 
✓ The column offset from the leftmost column: This is not a fixed column 
number but rather the number of columns relative from the leftmost 
column.
 
✓ A true or false value: If true (or omitted), VLOOKUP finds an approxi-
mate match. If false, an exact match is required. For an approximate 
match, the column must be sorted in ascending order.
Figure 14-10 shows an example of using VLOOKUP. The worksheet displays 
products and annual revenue data for the fictitious guitar shop. The range 
A6:D27 has been named Sales.
 
Figure 14-10: 
Using 
VLOOKUP to

279
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
The goal is to use VLOOKUP to extract the sales amount for the Wireless Gig 
Kit. However, the product names are in the second column of the Sales range, 
and VLOOKUP normally searches in the first column. You can use OFFSET 
to force VLOOKUP to search for Wireless Gig Kit in the second column 
of the range. This is the formula in cell B3: =VLOOKUP(“Wireless Gig 
Kit”,OFFSET(Sales,0,1),3, FALSE).
Note that the offset specified as the third argument to VLOOKUP is 3. That’s 
because the sales figures are in the third column relative to the Products 
column, where VLOOKUP is performing its search.
Here’s how to use either HLOOKUP or VLOOKUP:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter either =HLOOKUP( or =VLOOKUP( to start the function.
 
3. If using
 
• HLOOKUP: Enter the value that you want to find in the top row 
of the table.
 
• VLOOKUP: Enter the value that you want to find in the first 
column of the table.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the range address that defines the table of data, or enter its 
name if it has been assigned one.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. If using
 
• HLOOKUP: Enter a number to indicate the row of the value to 
return.
 
• VLOOKUP: Enter a number to indicate the column of the value to 
return.
 
 Remember that the number you enter here is relative to the range or 
area defined in the second argument.
 
8. Optionally, enter a comma (,) and FALSE.
 
 This forces the function to find an exact match for the value entered in 
the first argument.
 
9. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
Excel also provides the LOOKUP function, which is specialized for returning 
values from single-column or single-row ranges. See Excel Help for more infor-
mation on this function.

280
Part IV: Working with Data 
MATCH
The MATCH function returns the relative row number or column number of a 
value in a table. The key point here is that MATCH returns the relative value 
but does not return the value itself.
This function is useful when you need an item’s position. You are not often 
interested in this information by itself but may use it in a more complex for-
mula. We show you how shortly.
MATCH takes three arguments:
 
✓ The value to search for: This can be a number, text, or a logical value.
 
✓ Where to look: This is a range spanning a single row or column, or a 
named area that comprises a single row or column.
 
✓ How the match is to be applied: This argument is optional.
The third argument can be one of three values. They work as follows:
 
✓ 1 tells MATCH to find the largest value that is less than or equal to the 
lookup value. The array must be sorted in ascending order. This is the 
default value if the argument is omitted.
 
✓ –1 tells MATCH to find the smallest value that is greater than or equal to 
the lookup value. The array must be sorted in descending order.
 
✓ 0 tells MATCH to find the first value that is an exact match. The array 
need not be sorted.
Figure 14-11 shows the products and revenue for the guitar shop. Note that 
the information has been sorted in ascending order according to the Amount 
column. The goal is to get a count of how many products have sales less than 
$10,000. MATCH makes this easy, as shown in Figure 14-11. This formula is in 
cell B4: =MATCH(10000,OFFSET(Sales,0,3,ROWS(Sales),1))-1.
Take this formula apart from the inside out. First, you know that MATCH needs 
a reference to the column where it is to search — in this case, the Amount 
column in the Sales range. Sounds like a job for OFFSET! Type the following:
OFFSET(Sales,0,3,ROWS(Sales),1)
This returns a range that has the following characteristics:
 
✓ Offset by no rows and three columns from the Sales range
 
✓ Has a height equal to the number of rows in Sales
 
✓ Has a width of one column

281
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
 
Now that you have this range, you can tell MATCH to look for the largest value 
that is less than or equal to 10000. Because the data is sorted, the relative 
position of this value in the range is one more than the number of products 
with sales less than $10,000. Why one more? Because the heading row at the 
top of the range is counted too — so you subtract 1 to get the final answer.
 
Figure 14-11: 
Making a 
match.
 
Here’s how to use the MATCH function:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =MATCH( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a value to match.
 
 This can be a numeric, text, or logic value. You can enter a cell address 
provided the referenced cell has a usable value.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the range in which to look for a match.
 
 This can be a range reference or a named area.
 
6. Optionally, enter a comma (,) and enter a –1, 0, or 1 to tell the function 
how to make a match.
 
 The default is 1. A 0 forces an exact match.
 
7. Type a ), and press Enter.
The information returned by MATCH can be helpful when you use it with the 
INDEX function. INDEX returns the value found at a specified row and column 
intersection within a table. You can use MATCH to find the row and find the 
column and then use INDEX to get the actual data.

282
Part IV: Working with Data 
INDEX takes three arguments:
 
✓ The table to look in as a range address or range name
 
✓ The row number relative to the table’s first row
 
✓ The column number relative to the table’s leftmost column
The return value is the value of the cell where the row and column intersect.
Figure 14-12 shows an example where INDEX retrieves a value from a table 
that summarizes some guitar-shop sales by product and quarter. The table 
range in this example has been named Sales_by_qtr. The following formula, 
in cell C2, extracts the sales for 6 Foot Cables for Qtr 2:
=INDEX(Sales_by_qtr, MATCH(“6 Foot Cables”, OFFSET(Sales_
by_qtr,0,0,ROWS(Sales_by_qtr),1),0), MATCH(“Qtr 
2”, OFFSET(Sales_by_qtr, 0,0,1,COLUMNS(Sales_
by_qtr))))
Wow, that’s quite a cell full of formula! But you already know everything 
you need to understand it. The first argument to INDEX is no mystery — it 
is simply the name assigned to the table. The second and third arguments, 
which tell INDEX what cell to look in, are complicated. Look at the first one, 
for the row argument:
 MATCH(“6 Foot Cables”, OFFSET(Sales_by_qtr, 
0,0,ROWS(Sales_by_qtr),1),0)
You want to look down the table’s first column, where the product names are 
listed, and find the row that contains 6 Foot Cables. You also know that 
the MATCH function is just right for this job and that the function needs to 
know where to look. In other words, you must tell it the address of the table’s 
first column. Here is where OFFSET comes into play:
OFFSET(Sales_by_qtr, 0, 0, ROWS(Sales_by_qtr), 1)
This call to OFFSET returns a range address that has the following 
characteristics:
 
✓ Is located with reference to the range Sales_by_qtr
 
✓ Is offset from Sales_by_qtr by zero rows and zero columns (in other 
words, starts at cell B7)
 
✓ Contains the same number of rows as Sales_by_qtr
 
✓ Contains one column
The result is that this call to OFFSET returns the range B7:B18. The MATCH 
function becomes this, in effect:

283
 Chapter 14: Using Lookup, Logical, and Reference Functions
MATCH(“6 Foot Cables”, B7:B18, 0)
Because an exact match is requested, the data does not have to be sorted. 
MATCH finds the search text in the fourth row relative to the top of the table. 
This is the value that INDEX uses for its row argument. The column argument 
to INDEX is handled in the same way.
 
Figure 14-12: 
Using 
INDEX to 
extract data 
from a table.
 
Here’s how to use the INDEX function:
 
1. Click a cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =INDEX( to start the function.
 
3. Enter a reference to the table.
 
 You can drag the mouse over the range or enter its address. If the table 
has been named, you can enter the name.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter the row number relative to the table’s first row.
 
 This number can be the result of a calculation or the value returned 
from a function.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter the column number relative to the table’s leftmost column.
 
 This number can be the result of a calculation or the value returned 
from a function.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.

n this chapter, we show you how to use Excel’s information functions, 
which you use to obtain information about cells, ranges, and the work-
book you’re working in. You can even get information about the computer 
you’re using. What will they think of next!?
The information functions are great for getting formulas to focus on just the 
data that matters. Some functions even help shield you from Excel’s con-
fusing error messages. The first time we saw the #NAME? error we thought 
Excel was asking us to enter a name (just another of the more exciting Excel 
moments). Now, at least we know to use the ISERROR or ERROR.TYPE func-
tions to make error messages more meaningful. And after reading this chap-
ter, so will you!
Getting Informed with the CELL Function
The CELL function provides feedback about cells and ranges in a worksheet. 
You can find out what row and column a cell is in, what type of formatting it 
has, whether it’s protected, and so on.
CELL takes two arguments:
 
✓ The first argument, which is enclosed in double quotes, tells the func-
tion what kind of information to return.
 
✓ The second argument tells the function which cell or range to evalu-
ate. If you specify a range that contains more than one cell, the function 
returns information about the top-left cell in the range. The second argu-
ment is optional; when it isn’t provided, Excel reports back on the most 
recently changed cell.

286
Part IV: Working with Data 
Table 15-1 shows the list of possible entries for the first argument of the CELL 
function.
Table 15-1 Selecting the First Argument for the CELL Function
Argument
Example
Comment
address
=CELL(“address”)
Returns the address of the 
last changed cell.
col
=CELL(“col”,Sales)
Returns the column number 
of the first cell in the Sales 
range.
color
=CELL(“color”,B3)
Tells whether a particular 
cell (in this case, cell B3) is 
formatted in such a way that 
negative numbers are repre-
sented in color. The number, 
currency, and custom formats 
have selections for display-
ing negative numbers in red. 
If the cell is formatted for 
color-negative numbers, a 1 
is returned; otherwise, a 0 is 
returned.
contents
=CELL(“contents”,B3)
Returns the contents of a 
particular cell (in this case, 
cell B3). If the cell contains a 
formula, returns the result of 
the formula and not the for-
mula itself.
filename
=CELL(“filename”)
Returns the path, filename, 
and worksheet name of the 
workbook and worksheet that 
has the CELL function in it 
(for example, C:\Customers\
[Acme Company]Sheet1). 
Results in a blank answer in 
a new workbook that has not 
yet been saved.
format
=CELL(“format”,D12)
Returns a cell’s number 
format (in this case, cell D12). 
See Table 15-2 for a list of 
possible returned values.

287
 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
Argument
Example
Comment
paren-
theses
=CELL(“parentheses”,D12)
Returns 1 if a cell (in this 
case, D12) is formatted to 
have either positive values 
or all values displayed with 
parentheses. Otherwise, 0 is 
returned. A custom format is 
needed to make parentheses 
appear with positive values in 
the first place.
prefix
=CELL(“prefix”,R25)
Returns the type of text 
alignment in a cell (in this 
case, cell R25). There are 
a few possibilities: a single 
quotation mark (‘) if the 
cell is left-aligned; a double 
quotation mark (“) if the cell 
is right-aligned; a carat (^) if 
the cell is set to centered; or 
a backslash(\) if the cell is 
fill-aligned. If the cell being 
evaluated is blank or has a 
number, then the function 
returns nothing.
protect
=CELL(“protect”,D12)
Returns 1 if a cell’s protection 
(in this case, cell D12) is set 
to locked; otherwise, a 0 is 
returned. The returned value 
is not affected by whether 
the worksheet is currently 
protected.
row
=CELL(“row”,Sales)
Returns the row number of the 
first cell in the Sales range.
type
=CELL(“type”,D12)
Returns a value correspond-
ing to the type of information 
in a cell (in this case, cell 
D12). There are three possible 
values: b if the cell is blank; l 
if the cell has alphanumeric 
data; and v for all other possi-
ble values including numbers 
and errors.
width
=CELL(“width”)
Returns the width of the last 
changed cell, rounded to an 
integer. For example a width 
of 18.3 is returned as 18.

288
Part IV: Working with Data 
The second argument, whether it’s there or not, plays a key role in how the 
CELL function works. When included, the second argument is either a cell 
address, such as B12, or a range name, such as Sales. Of course, you could 
have a range that is only one cell, but let’s not confuse the issue!
 
If you enter a nonexistent range name for the second argument, Excel returns 
the #NAME? error. Excel can’t return information about something that 
doesn’t exist!
An interesting way to use CELL is to keep track of the last entry on a work-
sheet. Say you’re updating a list of values. The phone rings, and you’re tied 
up for a while on the call. When you get back to your list, you’ve forgotten 
where you left off. Yikes! What a time to think “If only I had used the CELL 
function!”
Figure 15-1 shows such a worksheet. Cell B18 displays the address of the last 
cell that was changed.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Keeping 
track of 
which cell 
had the lat-
est entry.
 
Using CELL with the filename argument is great for displaying the workbook’s 
path. This technique is common for printed worksheet reports. Being able to 
find the workbook file that a report was printed from six months ago is a real 
timesaver. Don’t you just love it when the boss gives you an hour to create 
a report, doesn’t look at it for six months, and then wants to make a change? 
Here’s how you enter the CELL function to return the filename:
=CELL(“filename”)

289
 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
You can format cells in many ways. When the first argument to CELL is 
format, a code is returned that corresponds to the formatting. The possible 
formats are those found in the Format Cells dialog box. Table 15-2 shows the 
formats and the code that CELL returns.

Using CELL with the format argument lets you add a bit of smarts to your 
worksheet. Figure 15-2 shows an example of CELL making sure information is 

290
Part IV: Working with Data 
correctly understood. The dates in Column A are of the d-mmm format. The 
downside of this format is that the year is not known. So, cell A1 has been 
given a formula that uses CELL to test the dates’ format. If the d-mmm format 
is found in the first date (in cell A4), then cell A1 displays a message that 
includes the year from cell A4. After all, cell A4 has a year — it’s just format-
ted not to show it. This way the year is always present — either in the dates 
themselves, or at the top of the worksheet.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Using CELL 
and the 
format 
argument to 
display 
a useful 
message.
 
The formula in cell A1 — =IF(CELL(“format”,A4)=”D2”,”Receipts 
for “&YEAR(A4),”Receipts”) — says that if the formatting in A4 is 
d-mmm (according to the values in Table 15-2), then display the message with 
the year; otherwise, just display Receipts.
Here’s how to use the CELL function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =CELL( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter one of the first argument choices listed in Table 15-1.
 
 Make sure to surround it with double quotes (“ ”).
 
4. If you want to tell the function which cell or range to use, enter a 
comma (,).
 
5. If you want, enter a cell address or the name of a range.
 
6. Enter a ), and press Enter.

 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
Getting Information about Excel 
and Your Computer System
Excel provides the INFO function to get information about your computer and 
about the program itself. INFO takes a single argument that tells the function 
what type of information to return. Table 15-3 shows how to use the INFO 
function.
Table 15-3 Using INFO to Find Out about Your Computer or Excel
Argument
Example
Comment
direc-
tory
=INFO(“directory”)
Returns the path of the current 
directory. Note that this is not nec-
essarily the same path of the open 
workbook.
Numfile
=INFO(“numfile”)
Returns the number of worksheets 
in all open workbooks. Includes 
worksheets of add-ins, so the 
number could be misleading.
origin
=INFO(“origin”)
Returns the address of the cell at 
the top and to the left of the scrol-
lable area. An A$ prefix in front of 
the cell address is for compatibility 
with Lotus 1-2-3.
osver-
sion
=INFO(“osversion”)
Returns the name of the current 
operating system.
recalc
=INFO(“recalc”)
Returns the status of the recalcula-
tion mode: either Automatic or 
Manual.
release
=INFO(“release”)
Returns the version number of 
Excel being run.
system
=INFO(“system”)
Returns the name of the operating 
environment: either mac or pcdos.
One useful application of the INFO function is to use the returned Excel ver-
sion number to determine whether the workbook can use a newer feature. 
For example, the ability to work with XML data has only been available in 
Excel 2002 and later. By testing the version number, you can be notified 

292
Part IV: Working with Data 
whether you can work with XML data. This formula uses the release choice 
as the argument:
=IF(INFO(“release”)>9,”This version can import XML”, “This 
version cannot import XML”)
Figure 15-3 shows values returned with the INFO function. The information 
shows facts about Ken’s computer.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Getting 
facts about 
the com-
puter with 
the INFO 
function.
 
Here’s how to use the INFO function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =INFO( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter one of the argument choices listed in Table 15-3.
 
 Make sure to surround it with double quotes (" ").
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
Finding What IS and What IS Not
A handful of IS functions report back a true or false answer about certain cell 
characteristics — for example, is a cell blank or does it contain text? These 
functions are often used in combination with other functions, typically the IF 
function, to handle errors or other unexpected or undesirable results.
The errors Excel reports are not very friendly. What on earth does #N/A 
really tell you? The functions we describe in this section won’t make the 
error any clearer, but they give you a way to instead display a friendly mes-
sage like “Something is wrong, but I don’t know what it is.”

293
 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
Table 15-4 shows the IS functions and how they’re used. They all return 
either True or False, so the table just lists them.
Table 15-4 
Using the IS Functions to See What Really Is
Function
Comment
=ISBLANK(value)
Tells whether a cell is blank.
=ISERR(value)
Tells whether a cell contains any error other 
than #N/A.
=ISERROR(value)
Tells whether a cell contains any error.
ISEVEN(value)
Tells whether a number is even.
=ISLOGICAL(value)
Tells whether value is logical.
=ISNA(value)
Tells whether a cell contains the #N/A error.
=ISNONTEXT(value)
Tells whether a cell contains a number or error.
=ISNUMBER(value)
Tells whether a cell contains a number.
ISODD(value)
Tells whether a number is odd.
=ISREF(value)
Tells whether value is a reference.
=ISTEXT(value)
Tells whether a cell contains text.
ISERR, ISERROR, and ISNA
Three of the IS functions — ISERR, ISERROR, and ISNA — tell you about an 
error.
Error Function
Comments
ISERR
Returns true if the error is anything except the #N/A 
error. For example, the #DIV/0! error returns true.
ISNA
The opposite of ISERR. It only returns true if the error 
is #N/A.
ISERROR
Returns true for any type of error. This includes 
#N/A, #VALUE!, #REF!, DIV/0!, #NUM!, #NAME?, and 
#NULL!.

294
Part IV: Working with Data 
Why is #N/A treated separately? It is excluded from being handled with ISERR 
and has its own ISNA function. Actually, you can use #N/A to your advantage 
to avoid errors. How so? Figure 15-4 shows an example that calculates the 
percentage of surveys returned for some of Florida’s larger cities. The calcu-
lation is simple — just divide the returned number by the number sent.
However, errors do creep in. (Creepy errors, yuck!) For example, no sur-
veys were sent to Gainesville, yet 99 came back. Interesting! The calculation 
becomes a division by zero error, which makes sense. On the other hand, 
Tallahassee had no surveys sent, but here the returned value is the #N/A 
error, purposely entered. Next, look at Column E. In this column, True or 
False is returned to indicate whether the calculation, per city, should be 
considered an error — Gainesville true, Tallahassee false.
true or false appears in Column E because all the cells in Column E use 
the ISERR function. The formula in cell E13, which tests the calculation for 
Tallahassee, is =ISERR(D13).
Simply put, D13 displays the #N/A error because its calculation (=C13/B13) 
uses a cell with an entered #N/A. The ISERR does not consider #N/A to be an 
error; therefore, E13 returns False. The upshot to all this is that eyeballing 
Column E makes distinguishing entry and math errors from purposeful flag-
ging of certain rows as having incomplete data easy.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Putting an 
error to your 
advantage.
 
ISBLANK, ISNONTEXT, ISTEXT, 
and ISNUMBER
The ISBLANK, ISNONTEXT, ISTEXT, and ISNUMBER functions tell you what 
type of data is in a cell.

295
 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
Error Function
Comments
ISBLANK
Returns true if the cell is empty. Returns false otherwise.
ISNONTEXT
Returns true if the cell contains anything that is not text: 
a number, a date/time, or an error. Also returns true if the 
cell is blank. Returns false if the cell contains text or a for-
mula whose result is text.
ISTEXT
The opposite of ISNONTEXT: Returns true if the cell con-
tains text or a formula whose result is text. Returns false 
otherwise.
ISNUMBER
Returns true if the cell contains a number or a formula 
whose result is a number. Returns false otherwise.
ISBLANK returns true when nothing is in a cell. Using ISBLANK is useful to 
count how many cells in a range are blank. Perhaps you’re responsible for 
making sure that 200 employees get their timesheets in every week. You can 
use a formula that lets you know how many employees have not yet handed 
in their hours.
Such a formula uses ISBLANK along with the IF and SUM functions, like this:
{=SUM(IF(ISBLANK(B5:B26),1,0))}
This formula makes use of an array. See Chapter 3 for more information on 
using array formulas. Figure 15-5 shows how this formula works. In columns 
A and B are lists of employees and their hours. The formula in cell A1 reports 
how many employees are missing their hours.
ISTEXT returns True when a cell contains any type of text. ISNONTEXT 
returns True when a cell contains anything that is not text, including num-
bers, dates, and times. The ISNONTEXT function also returns True if the cell 
contains an error.
The ISNUMBER function returns True when a cell contains a number, which 
can be an actual number or a number resulting from evaluation of a formula 
in the cell. You can use ISNUMBER as an aid to help data entry. Say you 
designed a worksheet that people fill out. One of the questions is age. Most 
people would enter a numeric value such as 18, 25, 70, and so on. But some-
one could type in the age as text, such as eighteen, thirty-two, or “none of 
your business.” An adjacent cell could use ISNUMBER to return a message 
about entering the numeric age. The formula would look something like this:
=IF(ISNUMBER(B3),””,”Please enter your age as a number”)

296
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 15-5:

an entry.
 
Here’s how to use any of the IS functions:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter one of the IS functions.
 
 For example, enter =ISTEXT( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter a cell address.
 
4. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
 The result is always either True or False.
Getting to Know Your Type
The TYPE function tells you what the type of the information is. Possible 
types follow:
 
✓ Number
 
✓ Text
 
✓ A logical value
 
✓ An error
 
✓ An array

297
 Chapter 15: Digging Up the Facts
In all cases TYPE returns a number:
 
✓ 1 is returned for numbers.
 
✓ 2 is returned for text.
 
✓ 4 is returned for logical values.
 
✓ 16 is returned for errors.
 
✓ 64 is returned for arrays.
Figure 15-6 shows each of these values returned by the TYPE function. Cells 
B3:B7 contain the TYPE function, with each row looking at the adjacent cell 
in Column A. The returned value of 64 in cell B7 is a little different. This indi-
cates an array as the type. The formula in cell B7 is =TYPE(A7:A9). This is 
an array of values from cells A7:A9.
 
Figure 15-6: 
Getting the 
type of the 
data.
 
Here’s how to use the TYPE function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =TYPE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter a cell address, or click a cell.
 
4. Enter a ), and press Enter.
 
When using TYPE to indicate an array, the function must be entered as an 
array function, using CTRL + Shift + Enter to complete the function entry.
The ERROR.TYPE function returns a number that corresponds to the particular 
error in a cell. Table 15-5 shows the error types and the returned numbers.

298

The best thing about the ERROR.TYPE function is that you can use it to 
change those pesky errors into something readable! To do this, use the 
CHOOSE function along with ERROR.TYPE, like this:
=CHOOSE(ERROR.TYPE(H14),”Nothing here!”,”You can’t 
divide by 0”,”A bad number has been entered”, 
“The formula is referencing a bad cell 
or range”,”There is a problem with the 
entry”,”There is a problem with the entered 
value”,”Something is seriously wrong!”)
See Chapter 14 for assistance on using the CHOOSE function. This is how you 
use the ERROR.TYPE function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =ERROR.TYPE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter a cell address, or click a cell.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.

A
 rose is still a rose by any other name. Or maybe not, when you use 
Excel’s sophisticated text-manipulation functions to change it into 
something else. Case in point: You can use the REPLACE function to change a 
rose into a tulip or a daisy, literally!
Did you ever have to work on a list where people’s full names are in one 
column but you need to use only their last names? You could extract the last 
names to another column manually, but that strategy gets pretty tedious for 
more than a few names. What if the list contains hundreds of names? This 
is just one example of text manipulations that you can easily and quickly do 
with Excel’s text functions.
Breaking Apart Text
Excel has three functions that are used to extract part of a text value (often 
referred to as a string). The LEFT, RIGHT, and MID functions let you get to the 
parts of a text value that their name implies, extracting part of a text value 
from the left, the middle, or the right. Mastering these functions gives you the 
power to literally break text apart.

300
Part IV: Working with Data 
How about this: You have a list of codes of inventory items. The first three 
characters are the vendor ID and the other characters are the part ID. You 
need just the vendor IDs. How do you do this? Or how do you get the part 
numbers not including the vendor IDs? Excel functions to the rescue!
Bearing to the LEFT
The LEFT function lets you grab a specified number of characters from the 
left side of a larger string. All you do is tell the function what or where the 
string is and how many characters you need to extract.
Figure 16-1 demonstrates how the LEFT function isolates the vendor ID in a 
hypothetical product code list (Column A). The vendor ID is the first three 
characters in each product code. You want to extract the first three charac-
ters of each product code and put them in column B. You put the LEFT func-
tion in Column B with the first argument, specifying where the larger string 
is (Column A) and the second argument specifying how many characters to 
extract (three). See Figure 16-1 for an illustration of this worksheet with the 
LEFT formula visible in the Formula Bar. (What’s Column C in this worksheet? 
We get to that in the next section.)
 
What if you ask LEFT to return more characters than the entire original string 
contains? No problem. In this case, LEFT simply returns the entire original 
string. The same is true for the RIGHT function, explained in the next section.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Getting the 
three left 
charac-
ters from 
a larger 
string.
 

301
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
Try it yourself! The LEFT function is really handy and yet so easy to use!
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the extracted string 
displayed.
 
2. Enter =LEFT( to start the function.
 
3. Click the cell containing the original string, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number.
 
 This number tells the function how many characters to extract from the 
left of the larger string. If you enter a number that is equal to or larger 
than the number of characters in the string, then the whole string is 
returned.
 
6. Type a ), and press Enter.
Swinging to the RIGHT
Excel does not favor sides. Because there is a LEFT function, there also is a 
RIGHT function. RIGHT extracts a certain number of characters from the right 
of a larger string. It works pretty much the same way as the LEFT function.
Column C of Figure 16-1 uses the RIGHT function to extract the rightmost four 
characters from the product codes. Cell C4, for example, has this formula: 
=RIGHT(A4,4).
Here’s how to use the RIGHT function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the extracted string 
displayed.
 
2. Enter =RIGHT( to start the function.
 
3. Click the cell containing the original string, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number.
 
 This number tells the function how many characters to extract from the 
right of the larger string. If you enter a number that is equal to or larger 
than the number of characters in the string, then the whole string is 
returned.
 
6. Type a ), and press Enter.

302
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Use LEFT and RIGHT to extract characters from the start or end of a text 
string. Use MID to extract characters from the middle.
Staying in the MIDdle
MID is a powerful text extraction function. It lets you pull out a portion of a 
larger string — from anywhere within the larger string. The LEFT and RIGHT 
functions allow you to extract from the start or end of a string but not the 
middle. MID gives you essentially complete flexibility.
MID takes three arguments: the larger string (or a reference to one); the char-
acter position to start at; and how many characters to extract. Here’s how to 
use MID:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the extracted string 
displayed.
 
2. Enter =MID( to start the function.
 
3. Click the cell that has the full text entry, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number to tell the function which character to start the extrac-
tion from.
 
 This number can be anything from 1 to the full count of characters of 
the string. Typically the starting character position used with MID is 
greater than 1. Why? If you need to start at the first position, you may as 
well use the simpler LEFT function. If you enter a number for the start-
ing character position that is greater than the length of the string, then 
nothing is returned.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter a number to tell the function how many characters to extract.
 
 If you enter a number that is greater than the remaining length of the 
string, then the full remainder of the string is returned. For example, if 
you tell MID to extract characters 2 through 8 of a six-character string, 
then MID returns characters 2 through 6.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.
Here are some examples of how MID works:

=MID(“APPLE”,4,2)
LE
=MID(“APPLE”,4,1)
L
=MID(“APPLE”,2,3)
PPL

Figure 16-2 shows how the MID function helps isolate the fourth and fifth 
characters in the hypothetical inventory shown in Figure 16-1. These charac-
ters could represent a storage-bin number for the inventory item. The MID 
function makes it easy to extract this piece of information from the larger 
product code.

Finding the long of it with LEN
The LEN function returns a string’s length. It takes a single argument — the 
string being evaluated. LEN is often used with other functions, such as LEFT 
or RIGHT.
Manipulating text sometimes requires a little math. For example, you may 
need to calculate how many characters to isolate with the RIGHT function. 
A common configuration of functions to do this is RIGHT, SEARCH, and LEN, 
like this:
=RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)- SEARCH(“ “,A1))

304
Part IV: Working with Data 
This calculates the number of characters to return as the full count of charac-
ters less the position where the space is. Used with the RIGHT function, this 
returns the characters to the right of the space.
 
The LEN function is often used with other functions, notably LEFT, RIGHT, 
and MID. In this manner, LEN helps determine the value of an argument to the 
other function.
Here’s how to use LEN:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =LEN( to begin the function.
 
3. Perform one of these steps:
 
• Click a cell that contains text
 
• Enter the cell’s address
 
• Enter a string, enclosed in double quotation marks
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
Putting Text Together with 
CONCATENATE
The CONCATENATE function pulls multiple strings together into one larger 
string. A good use of this is when you have a column of first names and a 
column of last names and need to put the two together to use as full names.
CONCATENATE takes up to 255 arguments. Each argument is a string or a cell 
reference, and the arguments are separated by commas. The function does 
not insert anything, such as a space, between the strings. If you need to sepa-
rate the substrings, as you would with the first name and last name example, 
you must explicitly insert the separator. Figure 16-3 makes this clear. You can 
see that the second argument to the CONCATENATE function is a space.
In Figure 16-3, the full names displayed in Column C are concatenated from 
the first and last names in Columns A and B, respectively. In the function’s 
arguments, enter a space between the references to cells in Columns A and B. 
You enter a space by enclosing a space between double quotation marks, like 
this: “ ”.

305
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
 
Figure 16-3: 
Putting 
strings 
together 
with 
CONCAT-
ENATE.
 
There is another way to concatenate strings. You can use the ampersand (&) 
character instead and skip using CONCATENATE altogether. For example, 
another way to create the full names seen in Figure 16-3 is by entering the fol-
lowing formula in the target cell: =A3 & “ ” & B3. Either method gets the 
job done. There really is no compelling reason to use one over the other — 
it’s up to you, empowered user!
You can give this a whirl on your own. Surely, you must have a list of names 
somewhere in an Excel workbook. Open that workbook, or at least enter first 
names and last names on your own, and then do the following:
 
1. Position the cursor in an empty column, in the same row as the first 
text entry, and enter =CONCATENATE( to start the function.
 
2. Click the cell that has the first name, or enter its address.
 
3. Enter a comma (,).
 
4. Enter a space inside double quotation marks.
 
 It should look like this: “ ”.
 
5. Enter a comma (,).
 
6. Click the cell that has the last name, or enter its address.
 
7. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
8. Use the fill handle to drag the function into the rows below, as many 
rows as there are text entries in the first column.
 
You can combine text strings two ways: use the CONCATENATE function or 
use the ampersand (&) operator.

306
Part IV: Working with Data 
Changing Text
There must be a whole lot of issues around text. We say that because a whole 
lot of functions let you work with text. There are functions that format text, 
replace text with other text, and clean text. (Yes, text needs a good scrubbing 
at times.) There are functions for just making lowercase letters into capitals 
and capital letters into lowercase.
Making money
Formatting numbers as currency is a common need in Excel. The Format 
Cells dialog box or the Currency Style button on the Number Formatting 
options on the Home tab of the Ribbon are the usual places to go to format 
cells as currency. Excel also has the DOLLAR function. On the surface, 
DOLLAR seems to do the same thing as the similar currency formatting 
options but has some key differences:
 
✓ DOLLAR converts a number to text. Therefore, you cannot perform 
math on a DOLLAR value. For example, a series of DOLLAR amounts 
cannot be summed into a total.
 
✓ DOLLAR displays a value from another cell. As its first argument, 
DOLLAR takes a cell address or a number entered directly into the func-
tion. DOLLAR is handy when you want to preserve the original cell’s 
formatting. In other words, you may need to present a value as currency 
in one location but also to let the number display in its original format in 
another location. DOLLAR lets you take the original number and present it 
as currency in another cell — the one you place the DOLLAR function in.
 
✓ DOLLAR includes a rounding feature. DOLLAR has a bit more muscle 
than the currency style. DOLLAR takes a second argument that specifies 
how many decimal places to display. When negative values are entered 
for the second argument, this serves to apply rounding to the digits on 
the left side of the decimal.
Figure 16-4 shows how the DOLLAR function can display various numeric 
values just the way you want. At the bottom of the worksheet is an area of 
detailed revenues. At the top is a summary that uses DOLLAR.
 
Unless a cell has been formatted otherwise, you can tell the type of entry by 
alignment. Text aligns to the left; numbers, to the right.
Specifically, the cells in the range C5:D7 use the DOLLAR function to present 
values from the detail area and also round them down to no decimals. For 
example, cell C5 contains =DOLLAR(G15,0). The grand total in cell C9 takes 
advantage of DOLLAR to round to the nearest 1,000. In this case the second 
argument is set to –3, like this: =DOLLAR(G25+G30,-3). Here are examples 
of how the rounding feature works:

307

$1,230
=DOLLAR(1234.56,-2)
$1,200

Using DOLLAR is easy:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =DOLLAR( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell that contains a number, or enter a number.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number to indicate the number of decimal points to display.
 
 If the number is 0, then no decimal points are displayed. Numbers less 
than 0 force rounding to occur to the left of the decimal point.
 
6. Type a ), and press Enter.

308
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
The DOLLAR function is named DOLLAR in countries that use dollars, such as 
the United States and Canada. In versions of Excel designed for countries that 
use a different currency, the name of the function should match the name of 
the currency.
Turning numbers into text
The TEXT function is a bit like the DOLLAR function in that it converts a 
number value to text data, but it gives you more result formatting options. 
TEXT can format numbers as currency, like DOLLAR, but is not limited to 
this.
The first TEXT argument is a number or reference to a cell that contains a 
number. The second argument is a formatting pattern that tells the func-
tion how to format the number. You can see some formatting patterns in the 
Custom category, on the Number tab, in the Format Cells dialog box (shown 
in Figure 16-5).
 
Figure 16-5: 
Formatting 
options 
in the 
Format Cells 
dialog box.
 
Excel lets you create custom formatting patterns so you can present your 
data just the way you need to. For example, you can specify whether num-
bers use a thousands separator, whether decimal values are always dis-
played to the third decimal point, and so on.

309
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
These patterns are created with the use of a few key symbols. A pound sign 
(#) is a placeholder for a number — that is, a single digit. Interspersing 
pound signs with fixed literal characters (such as a dollar sign, a percent 
sign, a comma, or a period) establishes a pattern. For example, this pattern — 
$#,###.# — says to display a dollar sign in front of the number, to use a 
comma for a thousands separator, and to display one digit to the right of 
the decimal point. Some formatting options used with the TEXT function are 
shown in Table 16-1. Look up custom number formatting in Excel Help for 
more information on custom format patterns, or go to www.microsoft.com 
and search for guidelines for custom number formats.

Figure 16-6 shows how the TEXT function is used to format values that are 
incorporated into sentences. Column C contains the formulas that use TEXT. 
For example, C4 has this formula: =“We spent “ & TEXT(B4,”$#,#.#0”) 
& “ on “ & A4. Cell C8 has this formula: =“We opened the office on 
“ & TEXT(B8,”mmm d, yyyy”).

Part IV: Working with Data 
Here’s how to use TEXT:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =TEXT( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell that contains a number or a date, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a ", and then enter a formatting pattern.
 
 See the Format Cells dialog box (in the Custom category on the Number 
tab) for guidance.
 
6. Enter a " after the pattern is entered.
 
7. Type a ), and press Enter.
The VALUE function does the opposite of TEXT — it converts strings to num-
bers. (This is not to say text such as twenty, but numbers that have been 
formatted as text.) Excel does this by default anyway, so we don’t cover the 
VALUE function here. You can look it up in Excel’s Help system if you’re curi-
ous about it.
Repeating text
REPT is a nifty function that does nothing other than repeat a string of text. 
REPT has two arguments:
 
✓ The string or a reference to a cell that contains text
 
✓ The number of times to repeat the text
REPT makes it a breeze to enter a large number of repeating characters. 
Figure 16-7 shows how this works. Cells B14 and B15 contain important sum-
mary information. To make this stand out, a string of asterisks (*) has been 
place above and below, respectively, in B13 and B16. The REPT function was 
used here, with this formula: =REPT(“*”,120). This simple function has 
removed the drudgery of having to enter 120 asterisks.
Try it out:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =REPT( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Either click a cell that contains text, or enter text enclosed in double 
quotation marks.
 
 Typically, you would enter a character (such as a period or an asterisk), 
but any text will work.

311
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number to tell the function how many times to repeat the text.
 
6. Type a ), and press Enter.

Swapping text
Two functions — REPLACE and SUBSTITUTE — replace a portion of a string 
with other text. The functions are nearly identical in concept but are used in 
different situations.
 
Both REPLACE and SUBSTITUTE replace text within other text. Use REPLACE 
when you know the position of the text you want to replace. Use SUBSTITUTE 
when you don’t know the position of the text you want to replace.
REPLACE
REPLACE takes four arguments:
 
✓ The target string as a cell reference
 
✓ The character position in the target string at which to start replacing
 
✓ The number of characters to replace
 
✓ The string to replace with (does not have to be the same length as the 
text being replaced)
For example, if cell A1 contains the string Our Chicago office has 
closed., then the formula =REPLACE(A1,5,7,”Dallas”) returns the 
string Our Dallas office has closed.
Check out how to use REPLACE with the Inventory Control data from earlier 
in the chapter, shown in Figure 16-8. A new task is at hand. To be compatible 

312
Part IV: Working with Data 
with a new computer system, you have to modify the product codes with two 
dashes between the vendor ID and the internal tracking number. The original 
codes are in Column A. Use a combination of REPLACE and LEFT functions to 
get the job done: =REPLACE(A4, 1, 3, LEFT(A4,3) & “--”).
These arguments replace the original three characters in each product code 
with the same three characters followed by two dashes. Figure 16-8 shows 
how REPLACE alters the product codes. In the figure, the first three product 
code characters are replaced with themselves and the dashes. The LEFT 
function and the dashes serve as the fourth argument of REPLACE.
 
Figure 16-8: 
Using 
REPLACE 
to change 
text.
 
 
Remember a couple of points about REPLACE:
 
✓ You need to know where the text being replaced is in the larger text. 
Specifically, you have to tell the function at what position the text starts, 
and how many positions it occupies.
 
✓ The text being replaced and the new text taking its place don’t have to 
be the same size.
Here’s how to use the REPLACE function:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =REPLACE( to begin the function entry.

313
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
 
3. Click a cell that contains the full string of which a portion is to be 
replaced.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Enter a number to tell the function the starting position of the text to 
be replaced.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Enter a number to tell the function how many characters are to be 
replaced.
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Click a cell that contains text, or enter text enclosed in double quota-
tion marks.
 
 This is the replacement text.
 
10. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
You can also use REPLACE to delete text from a string. Simply specify an 
empty string (“”) as the replacement text.
SUBSTITUTE 
Use the SUBSTITUTE function when you don’t know the position in the target 
string of the text to be replaced. Instead of telling the function the starting 
position and number of characters (as you do with REPLACE), you just tell it 
what string to look for and replace.
SUBSTITUTE takes three required arguments and a fourth optional argument:
 
✓ A reference to the cell that contains the target text string.
 
✓ The string within the target string that is to be replaced.
 
✓ The replacement text.
 
✓ An optional number to tell the function which occurrence of the string 
to replace.
The fourth argument tells SUBSTITUTE which occurrence of the text to be 
changed (the second argument) and actually replaced with the new text 
(the third argument). The text to be replaced may appear more than once in 
the target string. If you omit the fourth argument, then all occurrences are 
replaced. This is the case in the first example in Table 16-2; all spaces are 
replaced with commas. In the last example in Table 16-2, only the second 
occurrence of the word two is changed to the word three.

replaced with a

spaces remain as 
they are.
=SUBSTITUTE(“apple

The third space 
is replaced with a 
comma. The other 
spaces remain as 
they are.
=SUBSTITUTE(“There

There are 
three cats 
and three 
birds.
Both occurrences of 
two are replaced with 
three.
=SUBSTITUTE(“There 
are two cats and 
two birds.”,”two”,
”three”,2)
There are two 
cats 
and three 
birds.
Only the second 
occurrence of two is 
replaced with three.
Try it yourself! Here is what you do:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =SUBSTITUTE( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell that contains text, or enter its address.
 
 This is the full string of which a portion is to be replaced.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click a cell that contains text, or enter text enclosed in double quota-
tion marks.
 
 This is the portion of text that is to be replaced.
 
6. Enter a comma (,).
 
7. Click a cell that contains text, or enter text enclosed in double quota-
tion marks.
 
 This is the replacement text. If you want to specify which occurrence of 
text to change, continue with Steps 8 and 9; otherwise, go to Step 10.

315
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
 
8. Enter a comma (,).
 
9. Enter a number that tells the function which occurrence to apply the 
substitution to.
 
10. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
You can use SUBSTITUTE to remove spaces from text. In the second argument 
(what to replace), enter a space enclosed in double-quote marks. In the third 
argument, enter two double-quote marks, with nothing in between them. This is 
known as an empty string.
Giving text a trim
Spaces have a way of sneaking in and ruining your work. The worst thing is 
that you often can’t even see them! When the space you need to remove is 
at the beginning or end of a string, use the TRIM function to remove them. 
The function simply clips any leading or trailing spaces from a string. It also 
removes extra spaces from within a string, and a sequence of two or more 
spaces is replaced by a single space.
Figure 16-9 shows how this works. In Column A is a list of names. Looking 
closely, you can see that some unwanted spaces precede the names in cells 
A5 and A10. Column B shows the correction using TRIM. Here is the formula 
in cell A5: =TRIM(A5).
 
Figure 16-9: 
Removing 
spaces with 
the TRIM 
function.
 

316
Part IV: Working with Data 
TRIM takes just one argument — the text to be cleaned of leading and trailing 
spaces. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the result to appear.
 
2. Enter =TRIM( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell that contains the text that has leading or trailing spaces, or 
enter the cell address.
 
4. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
Be on the lookout: Although you generally use it to remove leading and trailing 
spaces, TRIM removes extra spaces in the middle of a string. If there are two 
or more spaces next to each other, TRIM removes the extra spaces and leaves 
one space in place.
This is usually a good thing. Most times you don’t want extra spaces in the 
middle of your text, but what if you do? Here are a couple of alternatives 
to remove a leading space, if it is there, without affecting the middle of the 
string:
Formula to Remove Leading Space
Comment
=IF(LEFT(E10,1)=“ “,SUBSTITUTE
(E10,” “,”“,1), E10)
If a space is found in the first posi-
tion, substitute it with an empty 
string; otherwise, just return the 
original string.
=IF(LEFT(E10,1)=“ 
“,RIGHT(E10,LEN(E10)-1), E10)
If a space is found in the first posi-
tion, return the right side of the 
string, less the first position. (See 
the section on LEN, earlier in this 
chapter.)
Making a case
In school you were taught to use an uppercase letter at the start of a sen-
tence as well as for proper nouns. But that was a while ago, and now the 
brain cells are a bit fuzzy. Lucky thing Excel has a way to help fix case, er 
Case, um CASE — well, you know what we mean.
Three functions alter the case of text: UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER. All three 
functions take a single argument — the text that will have its case altered. 
Here are a few examples:

317
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
Formula
Result
=LOWER(“The Cow Jumped Over 
The Moon”)
the cow jumped over the moon
=UPPER(“the cow jumped over 
the moon”)
THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON
=PROPER(“the cow jumped over 
the moon”)
The Cow Jumped Over The Moon
Try this:
 
1. Enter a sentence in a cell.
 
 Any old sentence will do, but don’t make any letters uppercase. For 
example, type “excel is great” or “computers give me a headache.”
 
2. Position the cursor in an empty cell.
 
3. Enter =UPPER( to start the function.
 
4. Click the cell that has the sentence, or enter its address.
 
5. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
6. In another empty cell, enter =PROPER( to start the function.
 
7. Click the cell that has the sentence, or enter its address.
 
8. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
 You should now have two cells that show the sentence with a case 
change. One cell has the sentence in uppercase; the other cell, in proper 
case.
 
Perhaps you noticed there is another possibility that needs to be addressed. 
What about when just the first word needs to start with an uppercase letter 
and the rest of the string is all lowercase? Some people refer to this as sen-
tence case. You can create sentence case by using the UPPER, LEFT, RIGHT, 
and LEN functions. (LEN is explained earlier in this chapter.) With the assump-
tion that the text is in cell B10, here is how the formula looks:
=UPPER(LEFT(B10,1)) & RIGHT(B10,LEN(B10)-1)
In a nutshell, the UPPER function is applied to the first letter, which is iso-
lated with the help of the LEFT function. This result is concatenated with the 
remainder of the string. You know how much is left by using LEN to get the 
length of the string and using the RIGHT function to get all the characters 
from the right, less one. This type of multiuse function work takes a bit of get-
ting used to.

318
Part IV: Working with Data 
Comparing, Finding, and Measuring Text
Excel has many functions that manipulate text, but sometimes you just need 
to find out about the text before you do anything else! A handful of functions 
determine whether text matches other text, let you find text inside other text, 
and tell you how long a string is. These functions are passive — that is, they 
do not alter text.
Going for perfection with EXACT
The EXACT function lets you compare two strings of text to see whether 
they’re the same. The function takes two arguments — the two strings of 
text — and returns a true or false value. EXACT is case sensitive, so two 
strings that contain the same letters but with differing case produces a result 
of false. For example, Apple and APPLE are not identical.
EXACT is great for finding changes in data. Figure 16-10 shows two lists of 
employees, one for each year, in Columns A and B. Are they identical? You 
could spend a number of minutes staring at the two lists. (That would give 
you a headache!) Or you can use EXACT. The cells in Column C contain the 
EXACT function, used to check Column A against Column B. The returned 
values are true for the most part. This means there is no change.
A few names are different in the second year. Marriage, divorce, misspellings — 
it could be any of these. EXACT returns false for these names, which means 
they aren’t identical in the two lists and should be checked manually.
 
Figure 16-10: 
Comparing 
strings with 
the EXACT 
function.
 

319
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
Here’s how you use EXACT:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter =EXACT( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Click a cell that contains text, or enter its address.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click another cell that has text, or enter its address.
 
6. Type a ), and press Enter.
 
If you get a true result with EXACT, the strings are identical. A false result 
means they’re different.
 
What if you want to compare strings without regard to case? In other words, 
APPLE and apple would be considered the same. Excel does not have a func-
tion for this, but the result is easily obtained with EXACT and UCASE. The idea 
is to convert both strings to uppercase and compare the results:
=EXACT(UCASE(“APPLE”), UCASE(“apple”))
You could just as well use LOWER here.
Finding and searching
Two functions, FIND and SEARCH, work in a quite similar fashion. A couple 
of differences are key to figuring out which to use. Both FIND and SEARCH 
find one string inside a larger string and tell you the position at which it was 
found (or produce #VALUE if it is not found). The differences follow:
FIND
SEARCH
Case sensitive. It will not, for example, 
find At inside heat.
Not case sensitive.

FIND takes three arguments:

✓ The position in the larger string to start looking at; this argument is 
optional

320
Part IV: Working with Data 
If the third argument is left out, the function starts looking at the beginning of 
the larger string. Here are some examples:
Value in Cell A1
Function
Result
Happy birthday to you
=FIND(“Birthday”,A1)
#VALUE!
Happy birthday to you
=FIND(“birthday”,A1)
7
Happy birthday to you
=FIND(“y”,A1)
5
Happy birthday to you
=FIND(“y”,A1,10)
14
In the first example using FIND, an error is returned. The #VALUE! error is 
returned if the text cannot be found. Birthday is not the same as birthday, 
at least to the case-sensitive FIND function.
SEARCH
The SEARCH function takes the same arguments as FIND. The two common 
wildcards you can use are the asterisk (*) and the question mark (?). An 
asterisk tells the function to accept any number of characters (including zero 
characters). A question mark tells the function to accept any single charac-
ter. It is not uncommon to see more than one question mark together as a 
wildcard pattern. Table 16-3 shows several examples.

The asterisk says

the letter b is at 
position 1. Using 
an asterisk at the 
start is not useful. It

example) is not in the 
larger text.

The asterisk says 
search for any

Because the search 
starts with a fixed 
character, its posi-

asterisk serves no 
purpose here.

Part IV: Working with Data 
Back in Figure 16-3, we show you how to concatenate first and last names 
together. What if you have full names to separate into first names and last 
names? SEARCH to the rescue! (Does that make this a search-and-rescue mis-
sion?) Figure 16-11 shows how the SEARCH, LEFT, RIGHT, and ISERROR func-
tions work together to turn names into individual first and last names.
 
Figure 16-11: 
Splitting 
names 
apart.
 
Isolating the first name from a full name is straightforward. You just use 
LEFT to get characters up to the first space. The position of the first space is 
returned from the SEARCH function. Here is how this looks:
=LEFT(A3,SEARCH(“ “,A3)-1)
Getting the last names is just as simple — not! When the full name has only 
first and last names (no middle name or initials), you need SEARCH, RIGHT, 
and LEN, like this:
=RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ “,A3))
However, this does not work for middle names or initials. What about 
Franklin D. Roosevelt? If you rely on the last name being after the first space, 
then the last name becomes D. Roosevelt. An honest mistake, but you can do 
better. What you need is a way to test for the second space and then return 
everything to the right of that space. There are likely a number of ways to do 
this.
Here is what you see in Column C, in Figure 16-11:
=IF(ISERROR(SEARCH(“ “,RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ 
“,A3)))),RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ 
“,A3)),RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ “,A3,SEARCH(“ 
“,A3)+1)))

323
 Chapter 16: Writing Home about Text Functions
Admittedly, it’s a doozy. But it gets the job done. Here is an overview of what 
this formula does:
 
✓ It’s an IF function and therefore tests for either true or false.
 
✓ The test is if an error is returned from SEARCH for trying to 
find a space to the right of the first space: ISERROR(SEARCH
(“ “,RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ “,A3)))).
 
✓ If the test is true, then there is no other space. This means there is no 
middle initial, so just return the portion of the name after the first space: 
RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ “,A3)).
 
✓ If the test is false, then there is a second space, and the task is to return 
the portion of the string after the second space. SEARCH tells both the 
position of the first space and the second space. This is done by nest-
ing one SEARCH inside the other. The inner SEARCH provides the third 
argument — where to start looking from. A 1 is added so the outer 
SEARCH starts looking for a space one position after the first space: 
RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-SEARCH(“ “,A3,SEARCH(“ “,A3)+1)).
Your eyes have probably glazed over, but that’s it!
The monster formula isolates last names from full names that include a 
middle initial. A task for you to try, if you have any working brain cells left is 
to write a formula that isolates the middle initial, if there is one. If you don’t 
want to tackle this just now, we understand. We even need a break too!
Here’s how to use FIND or SEARCH:
 
1. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
2. Enter either =FIND( or =SEARCH( to begin the function entry.
 
3. Enter a string of text that you want in a larger string, enclosed with 
double quotation marks, or click a cell that contains the text.
 
4. Enter a comma (,).
 
5. Click a cell that contains the larger text, or enter its address.
 
 If you want the function to begin searching at the start of the larger 
string, then go to Step 7. If you want to have the function begin the 
search in the larger string at a position other than 1, go to Step 6.
 
6. Enter a comma (,) and the position number.
 
7. Type a ), and press Enter.

Database Functions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding an Excel database structure
▶ Figuring out how criteria work
▶ Adding, averaging, and counting database records
▶ Testing for duplicate records
B
elieve it or not, an Excel worksheet has the same structure as a data-
base table. A database table has fields and records; an Excel worksheet 
has columns and rows. Same thing. Given this fact, why not ask questions of, 
or query, your information in much the same way as is done with a database?
In this chapter, we tell you how to use Excel’s database functions to get quick 
answers from big lists. Say you have a client list on a worksheet — name, 
address . . . that sort of thing. You want to know how many clients are in New 
York. You may think about sorting your list by state and then counting the 
number of rows. Forget it. That’s the old way! In this chapter, we show you 
how to do this sort of thing with a single function.
Putting Your Data into 
a Database Structure
 
To use the database functions, you need to put your data into a structured 
format. Excel is very flexible. Usually, you put data wherever you want. But to 
make the best of the database functions, you need to get your data into a con-
tiguous area of rows and columns. Each row is a record, and each column is a 
field. The top row contains labels that identify the fields.

326
Part IV: Working with Data 
Figure 17-1 shows a database on a worksheet. This example is a list of stu-
dents (by ID number), and their class, teacher, and grade. Each student occu-
pies a row — in other words, a record — in the database. Each of the four 
fields — Student ID, Class, Teacher, and Final Grade — is in one column and 
is identified by a label in the top row.
 
Figure 17-1: 
Using a 
database 
to store 
student 
information.
 
The data on the worksheet in Figure 17-1 is really just normal data. There is 
nothing special about it. However, the data sits in organized rows and col-
umns, making it ready for working with Excel’s database functions:
 
✓ Each column is a field that holds one particular item of data, such as 
Student ID or Class. It must contain no other data.
 
✓ Each row contains one record. In this example, a record is the data for 
one student.
 
✓ The top row of the database contains labels that identify the fields.
This sample data is used in this chapter to demonstrate the database func-
tions. Of course, you can have a database in Excel and never use the data-
base functions, but you have a lot more power at your fingertips if you do use 
them.

327
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
Working with Database Functions
The database functions all work in basically the same way. They perform 
some calculation on a specified field for those records that meet specified 
criteria. For example, you can use a database function to calculate the aver-
age final grade for all students in Accounting 101.
 
All database functions use the following three arguments:
 
✓ The database range: This argument tells the function where the data-
base is. You enter it using cell addresses (for example, A1:D200) or 
a named range (for example, Students). The range must include all 
records, including the top row of field names.
 
✓ The field: You must tell a database function which field to operate 
on. You can’t expect it to figure this out by itself! You can enter either 
the column number or the field name. A column number, if used, is 
the number of the column offset from the first column of the database 
area. In other words, if a database starts in Column C, and the field is 
in Column E, the column number is 3, not 5. If a heading is used, put it 
inside a set of double quotation marks. Database functions calculate a 
result based on the values in this field. Just how many values are used 
depends on the third argument — the criteria.
 
✓ The criteria: This tells the function where the criteria are located — it 
is not the criteria per se. The criteria tell the function which records to 
use in its calculation. You set up the criteria in a separate part of the 
worksheet, apart from the database area. This area’s address is passed 
to the database function. Criteria are explained in detail throughout the 
chapter.
Establishing your database
All database functions take a database reference as the first argument. 
The database area must include headers (field names) in the first row. In 
Figure 17-1, the first row uses Student ID, Class, Teacher, and Final Grade as 
headers to the information in each respective column.
 
A great way to work with the database functions is to name the database area 
and then enter the name, instead of the range address, into the function.

328
Part IV: Working with Data 
To set up a name, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the entire database area.
 
 Make sure the top row has headers and is included in the selection.
 
2. Click the Formulas tab (at the top of the Excel window).
 
3. Click Define Name in the Defined Names area.
 
 The New Name dialog box appears, with the range address set in the 
Refers To box.
 
4. Type a name in the Name Box (or use the suggested name).
 
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Later, if records are added to the bottom of the database, you have to 
redefine the named area’s range to include the new rows. You can do this 
as follows:
 
1. Click the Name Manager button on the Excel Formulas tab.
 
 The Name Manager dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the name in the list you want to redefine.
 
3. Click the Edit button in the dialog box.
 
 Excel opens the Edit Name dialog box, shown in Figure 17-2, with infor-
mation about the selected range.
 
Figure 17-2: 
Updating 
the refer-
ence to a 
named area.
 
 
4. Change the reference in the Refers To box.
 
 You can use the small square button to the right of the Refers To box to 
define the new reference by dragging the mouse pointer over it. Clicking 
the small square button reduces the size of the Edit Name dialog box 
and allows you access to the worksheet. When you are done dragging 
the mouse over the new worksheet area, press Enter to get back to the 
Define Name dialog box.

329
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
 
5. Click the OK button to save the reference change and close the 
dialog box.
 
6. Click Close.
 
If you add records to your database range by inserting new rows somewhere 
in the middle, rather than adding them on at the end, Excel automatically 
adjusts the reference to the named range.
Establishing the criteria area
As we have mention earlier, the criteria are not part of the database function 
arguments but are somewhere in the worksheet and then referenced by the 
function. The criteria area can contain a single criterion, or it can contain two 
or more criteria. Each individual criterion is structured as follows:
 
✓ In one cell, enter the field name (header) of the database column that 
the criterion will apply to.
 
✓ In the cell below, enter the value that the field data must meet.
Figure 17-3 shows the student database with a criteria area to the right of the 
database. There are places to put criteria for the Class, Teacher, and Final 
Grade. In the example, a criterion has been set for the Class field. This crite-
rion forces the database function to process only records (rows) where the 
Class is Accounting 101. Note, though, that a criterion can be set for more 
than one field. In this example, the Teacher and Final Grade criteria have 
been left blank so they don’t affect the results.
The DAVERAGE function has been entered into cell F8 and uses this crite-
ria range. The three arguments are in place: The name Students tells the 
function where the database is the Final Grade field (column) is where the 
function finds values to calculate the average, and the criteria are set to the 
worksheet range that has criteria that tell the function to use only records 
where the Class is Accounting 101 — in other words, F2:H3. The entry in cell 
F8 looks like this:
=DAVERAGE(Students,”Final Grade”,F2:H3)
Why does this function refer to F2:H3 as the criteria range when the only 
defined criterion is located in the range F2:F3? It’s a matter of convenience. 
Because cells G3 and H3 in the criteria range are blank, the Teacher and Final 
Grade fields are ignored by a database function that uses this criteria range. 
However, if you want to enter a criterion for one of those fields, just enter it in 
the appropriate cell; there is no need to edit the database function arguments. 

330
Part IV: Working with Data 
What about assigning a name to the criteria area and then using the name as 
the third argument to the database function? That works perfectly well, too.
 
Figure 17-3: 
Selecting 
criteria to 
use with a 
database 
function.
 
 
Whether you use a named area for your criteria or simply type in the range 
address, you must be careful to specify an area that includes all the criteria 
but does not include any blank rows or columns. If you do, the database func-
tion’s results will be incorrect.
Here’s how you enter any of the database functions. This example uses 
the DSUM function, but the instructions are the same for all the database 
functions — just use the one that performs the desired calculation.
 
1. Import or create a database of information on a worksheet.
 
 The information should be in contiguous rows and columns. Be sure to 
use field headers.
 
2. Optionally, use the New Name dialog box to give the database a name.
 
 To name your database, see the section on “Establishing your database.”
 
3. Select a portion of the worksheet to be the criteria area, and then add 
headers to this area that match the database headers.
 
 You have to provide criteria headers only for database fields that crite-
ria are applied to. For example, your database area may have ten fields, 
but you need to define criteria to three fields. Therefore, the criteria 
area can be three columns wide.
 
4. Position the cursor in the cell where you want the results to appear.
 
 This cell must not be in the database area or the criteria area.
 
5. Enter =DSUM( to begin the function entry.
 
6. Enter the database range or a name, if one is set.
 
7. Enter a comma (,).

331
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
 
8. Enter either one of the following:
 
• The header name, in quotation marks, of the database field that 
the function should process
 
• The column number
 
9. Enter a comma (,).
 
10. Enter the range of the criteria area.
 
11. Type a ), and press Enter.
Fine-Tuning Criteria with AND and OR
Excel’s database functions would not be of much use if you could not create 
fairly sophisticated queries. A few common types of queries follow:
 
✓ Records that match two or more individual criteria
 
✓ Records that match any one of several criteria
 
✓ Values that fall within a specified range
To find records that match two or more criteria, place the criteria in adjacent 
columns in the criteria area. Continuing with the student grade database, the 
criteria area shown in Figure 17-4 matches records where the Class field con-
tains Accounting 101 and the Teacher field contains Mr. Harris. This is 
called an AND criterion.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Finding 
records that 
match two 
criteria.
 
To match records that meet any one of several criteria, place the individual 
criteria in two or more rows below the field name. Figure 17-5 shows a cri-
teria range that matches all records where the Class field contains either 
Accounting 101 or English Literature. This is called an OR criterion.

332
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 17-5: 
Finding 
records that 
match any 
one of two 
or more 
criteria.
 
To combine AND with OR in a criteria range, use two or more columns and 
two or more rows. Figure 17-6 shows a criteria range that finds all records 
where Class is Accounting 101 and Teacher is either Mr. Harris or 
Mr. Richards.
 
Figure 17-6: 
Combining 
AND and OR 
criteria.
 
To define a criterion that uses ranges, use these numerical comparison 
operators:
 
✓ < for less than
 
✓ > for greater than
 
✓ <= for less than or equal to
 
✓ >= for greater than or equal to
Of course, you can apply these to fields with numerical values. Figure 17-7 
shows two criteria areas. The upper one matches all records where Final 
Grade is 90 or higher. The lower one matches all records where Final Grade 
is equal to or greater than 80 and less than 90.

333
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
Adding Only What Matters with DSUM
The DSUM function lets you sum numbers in a database column for just 
those rows that match the criteria you specify. For example, take a database 
that contains data on individual sale amounts for sales people. The database 
range is named Sales. You want to calculate total sales for each of the three 
sales representatives. Figure 17-8 shows how this is done. Three criteria 
areas are defined in D2:D3, E2:E3, and F2:F3. The DSUM function is entered in 
cells E8:E10. The formula in cell E8 is thus:
=DSUM(SALES, “Sale Amount”, D2:D3)
The functions entered in E9 and E10 are identical except for referencing a dif-
ferent criteria range. The results show clearly that Amy is the sales leader.
 
Figure 17-8: 
Calculating 
the sum of 
sales with 
the DSUM 
function.
 
Going for the Middle with DAVERAGE
The DAVERAGE function lets you find the average, or mean, of a field for just 
the rows that match the criteria. For this example you return to the student 
database.
Figure 17-9 shows a worksheet in which the average grade for each course 
has been calculated using DAVERAGE. For example, cell G22 shows the aver-
age grade for Masters of Philosophy. Here is the formula:
=DAVERAGE(Students,”Final Grade”,F14:G15)
Each calculated average uses a different criteria area. Each area filters the 
result by a particular course. In all cases, the criteria area for the Teacher is 
left blank and, therefore, has no effect on the results.

334
Part IV: Working with Data 
 
Figure 17-9: 
Calculating 
the aver-
age grade 
for each 
course.
 
For the sake of comparison, DAVERAGE is also used in cell G24 to show the 
overall average for all courses. Because a criterion is a required function 
argument, the calculation in cell G24 is set to look at an empty cell. None of 
the Class criteria cells are free, so the function looks to the Teacher criterion 
in cell G3. Because this cell has no particular teacher entered as a criterion, 
all of the records in the database are used to create this average — just what 
you want. Here is the formula in cell G24:
=DAVERAGE(Students,”Final Grade”,G2:G3)
It doesn’t matter which field header you use in the criterion when getting a 
result based on all records in a database. What does matter is that there is no 
actual criterion underneath the header.
Counting Only What Matters 
with DCOUNT
The DCOUNT function lets you determine how many records in the database 
match the criteria.
Figure 17-10 shows how DCOUNT can determine how many students took 
each course. Cells G18:G22 contain formulas that count records based on the 
criterion (the Class) in the associated criteria sections. Here is the formula 
used in cell G20, which counts the number of students in Calculus 101:
=DCOUNT(Students,”Final Grade”,F8:G9)

335
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
Note that DCOUNT requires a column of numbers to count. Therefore, the 
Final Grade heading is put in the function. Counting on Class or Teacher 
would result in zero. Using a column that specifically has numbers may seem 
a little odd. The function is not summing the numbers; it just counts the 
number of records. But what the heck? It works.
 
Figure 17-10: 
Calculating 
the number 
of students 
in each 
course.
 
Now take this a step further. How about counting the number of students 
who got a grade of 90 or better in any class? How can this be done? This cal-
culation requires a different criterion — one that selects all records where 
Final Grade is 90 or greater. Figure 17-11 shows a worksheet with this crite-
rion and the calculated result shown.
 
Figure 17-11: 
Calculating 
the number 
of students 
who earned 
a grade of 
90 or better.
 
The result in cell F6 concatenates — that is, combines but does not add — the 
answer from the DCOUNT function with some text. The formula looks like 
this:
=DCOUNT(Students,”Final Grade”,F2:F3) & “ students 
received a 90 or better.”

336
Part IV: Working with Data 
The criterion specifically states to use all records where the Final Grade is 
greater than 89 (>89). You can specify >=90 with the exact same result.
Finding Highest and Lowest 
with DMIN and DMAX
The DMIN and DMAX functions find the minimum or maximum value, respec-
tively, in a database column, for just the rows that match the criteria. Figure 
17-12 shows how these two functions can find the highest and lowest grades 
for English Literature.
The formulas in cells F8 and F10 are practically identical. Here is the formula 
in cell F8:
=”The highest grade in “ & $F$3 & “ is “ & 
DMAX(Students,”Final Grade”,$F$2:$F$3)
 
Figure 17-12: 
Calculating 
the highest 
and lowest 
grades for 
a specified 
class.
 
Finding Duplicate Values with DGET
DGET is a unique database function. It does not perform a calculation but 
rather checks for duplicate entries. The function returns one of three values:
 
✓ If one record matches the criterion, DGET returns the criterion.
 
✓ If no records match the criterion, DGET returns the #VALUE! error.
 
✓ If more than one record matches the criterion, DGET returns the #NUM! 
error.

337
 Chapter 17: Playing Records with Database Functions
By testing to see whether DGET returns an error, you can discover problems 
with your data. Perhaps you suspect that a student has registered twice for 
a specific class. If this is true, two records will have the same Student ID and 
Class.
Figure 17-13 shows how to check if student NR5090 is entered more than 
once for Calculus 101. If there is more than one record, DGET returns an 
error. Cell F5 contains a formula that nests the DGET function inside the 
ISERROR function; all that is inside the IF function. If DGET returns an error, 
return one message; if DGET does not return an error, return a different mes-
sage. Here is the formula:
=IF(ISERROR(DGET(Students,”Student ID”,F2:G3)),F3 & “ has 
duplicate records”, F3 & “ has one record”)

with Formulas

▶ Making sure the order of operators is correct
▶ Viewing and fixing formulas
▶ Referencing cells and using names

S
everal elements can help you be as productive as possible when writing 
and correcting formulas. You can view all your formulas at once and cor-
rect errors one by one. You can use add-in wizards to help write functions. 
You can even create functions all on your own!
Operator Precedence
One of the most important factors when writing formulas is to get the operators 
correct, and we do not mean telephone company operators. This has to do with 
mathematical operators — you know, little details such as plus signs, and multi-
plication signs, and where the parentheses go. Operator precedence — the order 
in which operations are performed — can make a big difference in the result. 
You have an easy way to keep your operator precedence in order. All you have 
to remember is “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.”
No, we have not lost our minds! This phrase is a mnemonic for the following:
 
1. Parentheses
 
2. Exponents

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Multiplication
 
4. Division
 
5. Addition
 
6. Subtraction
Thus, parentheses have the first (highest) precedence, and subtraction has 
the last precedence. Well, to be honest, multiplication has the same prece-
dence as division, and addition has the same precedence as subtraction, but 
you get the idea!
For example, the formula =1 + 2 × 15 equals 31. If you think it should 
equal 45, then you better go visit your aunt! The answer equals 45 if you 
include parentheses, such as this: =(1 + 2) × 15.
 
Getting the order of the operators correct is critical to the well-being of your 
worksheet. Excel generates an error when the numbers of open and closed 
parentheses do not match, but if you meant to add two numbers before the 
multiplication, Excel will not know that you simply left the parentheses out!
A few minutes of refreshing your memory on operator order can save you a 
lot of headaches down the road.

In case you haven’t noticed, it’s kind of hard to view your formulas without 
accidentally editing them. That’s because anytime you are in “edit” mode and 
the active cell has a formula, the formula may incorporate the address of any 
other cell you click. This totally messes things up.
Wouldn’t it be easy if you could just look at all your formulas? There is a way! 
It’s simple. Click the Office button at the top left of the Excel workspace, click 
on Excel Options, and then click on the Advanced Tab. Scroll down to the 
Display options for this worksheet section. See Figure 18-1.
Notice the Show formulas in cells instead of their calculated results check box. 
This box tells Excel that for any cells that have formulas to display the formula 
itself instead of the calculated result. Figure 18-2 shows a worksheet that dis-
plays the formulas. To return to normal view, repeat these steps and uncheck 
the option. This option sure makes it easy to see what all the formulas are!
 
You can accidentally edit functions even when you have selected the View 
Formulas option. Be careful clicking around the worksheet.

You can also display formulas by clicking the Show Formulas button on the 
Formulas tab on the Ribbon.
Fixing Formulas
Suppose your worksheet has some errors — don’t panic! It happens to 
even the savviest users, and Excel can help figure out what’s going wrong. 
On the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing section is the Error Checking 
button. Clicking the button displays the Error Checking dialog box shown in 
Figure 18-3. That is, the dialog box appears if your worksheet has any errors. 
Otherwise, it just pops up a message that the error check is complete. It’s 
that smart!

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 18-3: 
Checking for 
errors.
 
When there are errors, the dialog box appears and sticks around while you 
work on each error. The Next and Previous buttons let you cycle through all 
the errors before the dialog box closes. For each error it finds, you choose 
what action to take:
 
✓ Help On This Error: This leads to the Help system and displays the 
topic for the particular type of error.
 
✓ Show Calculation Steps: The Evaluate Formula dialog box opens, and 
you can watch step by step how the formula is calculated. This lets you 
identify the particular step that caused the error.
 
✓ Ignore Error: Maybe Excel is wrong? Ignore the error.
 
✓ Edit in Formula Bar: This is a quick way to just fix the formula yourself 
if you don’t need any other help.
The Error Checking dialog box also has an Options button. Clicking the 
button opens the Formulas tab from the Excel Options dialog box. In the 
Formulas tab you can select settings and rules for how errors are recognized 
and triggered.
Use Absolute References
If you are going to use the same formula for a bunch of cells, such as those 
going down a column, the best method is to write the formula once and then 
drag it down to the other cells by using the fill handle. The problem is that 
when you drag the formula to new locations, any relative references change.
Often this is the intention. When there is one column of data and an adjacent 
column of formulas, typically each cell in the formula column refers to its 
neighbor in the data column. But if the formulas all reference a cell that is 
not adjacent, usually the intention is for all the formula cells to reference an 
unchanging cell reference. Get this to work correctly by using an absolute 
reference to the cell.

345
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Formulas
 
To use an absolute reference to a cell, use the dollar sign ($) before the row 
number, before the column letter, or before both. Do this when you write the 
first formula, before dragging it to other cells, or you will have to update all 
the formulas.
For example, don’t write this:
=A4 × (B4 + A2)
Write it this way instead:
=A4 × (B4 + $A$2)
This way all the formulas reference A2 no matter where you copy them, 
instead of that reference turning into A3, and A4, and so on.
 
Here’s another timesaver — when you are entering or editing a formula, you 
can cycle a cell reference between relative, row absolute, column absolute, and 
fully absolute by placing the editing cursor on the reference and pressing F4.
Turn Calc On/Turn Calc Off
The Excel default is to calculate your formulas automatically as they are 
entered or when you change the worksheet. In some situations you may want 
to set the calculation to manual. Leaving the setting on automatic is usually 
not an issue, but if you are working on a hefty workbook with lots of calcula-
tions, you may need to rethink this one.
Imagine this: You have a cell that innocently does nothing but display the 
date. But then there are dozens of calculations throughout the workbook that 
reference that cell. Then there are dozens more calculations that reference 
the first batch of cells that reference the cell with the data. Get the picture? 
In a complex workbook there could be a lot of calculating going on. And the 
time this takes can be noticeable.
Turning the calculation setting to manual lets you decide when to calculate. 
Do this in the Excel Options dialog box; click the Office button, and then click 
Excel Options to get there. In the dialog box click the Formulas tab, in which 
calculation options are selected as shown in Figure 18-4. You can check for 
one of the automatic calculations settings or for manual calculation.

346

Pressing F9 calculates the workbook. Use it when the calculation is set to 
Manual. Here are some further options:
What You Press
What You Get
F9
Calculates formulas that have changed since the last 
calculation, in all open workbooks
Shift + F9
Calculates formulas that have changed since the last 
calculation, just in the active worksheet
Ctrl + Alt + F9
Calculates all formulas in all open workbooks, 
regardless of when they were last calculated
 
You can also change the calculation option without going into Excel Options. 
On the Ribbon click the Formulas tab. On the tab is a Calculation section.
Use Named Areas
Heck, maybe it’s just us, but we think it is easier to remember a word such 
as Customers or Inventory or December than it is to remember B14:E26 or 
AF220:AR680. So we create names for the ranges we know we’ll reference in 
our formulas and functions.
Naming areas is easy to do, and in fact, you can do it a few ways. The first is 
to use the New Name dialog box. You can get to this by clicking the Define 
Name button on the Formulas tab on the Ribbon. In the dialog box, you set a 
range, give it a name, and press the OK button. See this in Figure 18-5.

347
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Formulas
 
Figure 18-5: 
Defining a 
named area.
 
The Name Manager is another dialog box that can displayed by clicking its 
button on the Formulas tab. This dialog box lets you add, update, and delete 
named areas. A really quick way to just add them (but not update or delete) 
is to
 
1. Select an area on the worksheet.
 
2. Click in the Name Box and enter the name.
 
 The Name Box is part of the Formula Bar and sits to the left of where for-
mulas are entered.
 
3. Press Enter.
Done! Now you can use the name as you please. Figure 18-6 shows a name 
being entered by using the Name Box. Of course you can use a particular 
name only once in a workbook.

Defining a 
named area 
the easy 
way.
 
Use Formula Auditing
There are precedents and dependents. There are external references. There 
is interaction everywhere. How can you track where the formula references 
are coming from and going to?

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Use the formula auditing tools, that’s how! On the Formulas tab is the 
Formula Auditing section. In the section are various buttons that control the 
visibility of auditing trace arrows. See Figure 18-7.
 
Figure 18-7: 
Auditing 
formulas.
 
The formula auditing toolbar has a number of features for wading through 
your formulas. Besides showing tracing arrows, it also can check errors, eval-
uate formulas, check for invalid data, and add comments to worksheets.
Use Conditional Formatting
Just like the IF function returns a certain value when the first argument condi-
tion is true and another value when it’s false, conditional formatting lets you 
apply a certain format to a cell when a condition is true. On the Home tab in 
the Styles section is a drop-down with many conditional formatting options. 
Figure 18-8, shows some values that have been treated with conditional 
formatting. Conditional Formatting lets you set the condition and select the 
format that is applied when the condition is met. For example, you could 
specify that the cell be displayed in bold italics when the value it contains is 
greater than 100.
Conditions are set as rules. The Rule Types are:
 
✓ Formal all cells based on their values
 
✓ Format only cells that contain…
 
✓ Format only top or bottom ranked values
 
✓ Format only values that are above or below average
 
✓ Format only unique or duplicate values
 
✓ Use a formula to determine which cells to format

349
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Formulas
 
Figure 18-8: 
Applying a 
format when 
a condition 
is met.
 
When the condition is true, formatting can control the following:
 
✓ Borders
 
✓ Font settings: Style, color, bold, italic, and so on
 
✓ Fill: A cell’s background color or pattern
Cells can also be formatted with color schemes or icon images placed in the 
cell.
Use Data Validation
On the Data tab, in the Data Tools section, is Data Validation. Data Validation 
lets you apply a rule to a cell (or cells) such that entry must adhere to the 
rule. For example, a cell can be set to accept only an integer entry between 50 
and 100. See Figure 18-9.
When entry does not pass the rule, a message is shown. See Figure 18-10.
 
The error message can be customized. For example if someone enters the 
wrong number, the displayed error message can say “ Noodlehead – learn how 
to count!” Just don’t let the boss see that.

Create Your Own Functions
Despite all the functions provided by Excel, you may need one that you just 
don’t see offered. Excel lets you create your own functions by using VBA pro-
gramming code; your functions show up in the Insert Function dialog box.
Okay, we know what you’re thinking: Me, write VBA code? No way! It’s true — 
this is not for everyone. But nonetheless, here is a short and sweet example. 
If you can conquer this, then you may want to find out more about program-
ming VBA. Who knows, maybe one day you’ll be churning out sophisticated 
functions of your own!
Follow along to create custom functions:
 
1. Press Alt + F11.
 
 This gets you to the Visual Basic Editor, where VBA is written.
 
 You can also click the Visual Basic button on the Developer tab on the 
Ribbon. The Developer tab is visible only if checked on the Customize 
Ribbon tab in Excel Options.

351
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Formulas
 
2. Choose Insert➪Module in the editor.
 
 You have an empty code module sitting in front of you. Now it’s time to 
create your very own function!
 
3. All you have to do is type this programming code, shown in Figure 18-11:
Public Function Add(number1 As Double, number2 As 
Double)
 Add = number1 + number2
End Function
 
4. Save the function.
  
 Macros and VBA programming can only be saved in Macro-Enabled 
Workbook.
 
 After you type in the first line and press Enter, the last one appears 
automatically. This example function adds two numbers, and the word 
Public lists the function in the Insert Function dialog box. You may have 
to find the Excel workbook on the Windows task bar because the Visual 
Basic Editor runs as a separate program.
 
Figure 18-11: 
Writing 
your own 
function.
 
 
5. Return to Excel to find and use the function in the Insert Function 
dialog box, in the User Defined Category. Click the Insert Function 
button in the Formulas tab to display the dialog.
 
 Figure 18-12 shows this.

6. Click OK.
 
 The dialog box opens, ready to receive the arguments; see Figure 18-13. 
Isn’t this incredible? It’s as if you are creating an extension to Excel, and 
in essence you are.
 
 
 You can enter =Add( into a cell and use the function you created that 
way — just like any other Excel function.
 
Figure 18-13:

This is a very basic example of what you can do by writing your own func-
tion. The possibilities are endless, but, of course, you need to know how to 
program VBA. We suggest reading Excel VBA Programming For Dummies, by 
John Walkenbach (Wiley).

his chapter lists the top ten Excel functions. Actually, it lists the top 15, 
but in some cases two related functions are treated as a single item. To 
be fair, there is no absolute top-ten list of functions, but over the years (don’t 
ask how many!) we have worked on hundreds of worksheets and saw some of 
the same functions used all the time.
The functions in this list are of the type that apply to a wide array of needs. 
You won’t see a financial function or any advanced statistical function — just 
the basics — but knowing the functions in this chapter is essential to good 
Excel work. You can always refer here for a quick brush-up on how to use 
these important functions.
SUM
Adding numbers is one of the most basic mathematical operations. And so 
there is the SUM function dedicated to doing just that. SUM takes up to 30 
arguments.
Each argument can be a single number or a range containing multiple num-
bers. That means SUM can add up a whole bunch of numbers! The syntax 
follows:

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
=SUM(number 1, number 2, ...)
You can also use SUM with a range, as shown here:
=SUM(A1:A12)
You can also use SUM with more than one range, such as this:
=SUM(A1:A12, B1:B12)
AVERAGE
Although technically a statistical function, AVERAGE is so often used it 
deserves a place in the top ten functions. Everyone is interested in averages. 
What’s the average score? What’s the average salary? What’s the average 
height? What’s the average number of hours we watch TV? (That’s a sore 
spot in our households!)
AVERAGE can take up to 30 arguments. Each argument can be a number or a 
range that contains numbers. The syntax follows:
=AVERAGE(number 1 ,number 2 ,...)
You can also use AVERAGE with a range, as shown here:
=AVERAGE(A1:A12)
You can also use AVERAGE with more than one range, such as this:
=AVERAGE(A1:A12, B1:B12)
COUNT
COUNT counts the number of cells in a range that contain numbers. It does 
not provide any sum — just the count. For a list with ten numbers, for exam-
ple, COUNT returns 10, regardless of what the numbers are.
COUNT takes up to 30 arguments, which can be cell references, range refer-
ences, or numbers themselves. COUNT ignores non-numeric values. If an 
argument to COUNT is A1:A10 but only two cells contain a number, then 
COUNT returns 2. The syntax follows:

355
 Chapter 19: Ten Functions You Really Should Know
=COUNT(cell reference 1, cell reference 2,...)
You can also use COUNT with a range, as shown here:
=COUNT(A1:A12)
You can also use COUNT with more than one range, such as this:
=COUNT(A1:A12, B1:B12)
INT and ROUND
The INT and ROUND functions both work by removing or reducing a num-
ber’s decimal portion. They differ in exactly how they remove it.
INT
INT simply drops the decimal portion without rounding — that is, without 
regard to whether the number is closer to the next higher integer or the next 
lower integer. Be aware that INT always truncates to the next lower integer. 
For example, INT changes 12.05 to 12, but it also changes 12.95 to 12. Also, 
INT changes both –5.1 and –5.9 to –6, not to –5, because –6 is the next lower 
integer. INT takes but the single number argument. The syntax follows:
=INT(number)
ROUND
On the other hand, the ROUND function lets you control how the decimal 
portion is handled. ROUND takes two arguments — the number to be manipu-
lated and the number of decimal places to round to. This gives you more con-
trol. A number such as 5.6284 can become 5.628, 5.63, 5.6, or just 6. ROUND 
always rounds up or down to the nearest number of the next significant digit, 
so 5.628 becomes 5.63, not 5.62.
ROUND turns 12.95 into either 12.9 or 13, depending on the setting of the 
second argument. Note that there are two functions — ROUNDUP and 
ROUNDDOWN — that round in one direction only. The syntax for ROUND 
follows:

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
=ROUND(number, number of decimal places to round to)
The syntax for ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN is the same as ROUND:
=ROUNDUP(number, number of decimal places to round to)
=ROUNDDOWN(number, number of decimal places to round to)
IF
IF is a very handy function. It tests a condition and then returns one of two 
results depending on the outcome of the test. The test must return a true or 
false answer. For example, a test may be B25 > C30. If true, then IF returns 
its second argument. If false, IF returns its third argument.
IF is often used as a validation step to avoid unwanted errors. The most 
common use of this is to test whether a denominator is 0 before doing a divi-
sion operation. By testing for 0 first, you can avoid the #DIV/0! error.
One of the great things about IF is that the result can be a blank. This func-
tion is great when you want to return a result if the test comes out one way 
but not if the result is otherwise. The syntax follows:
=IF(logical test, value if true, value if false)
NOW and TODAY
The NOW function returns the current date and time according to your 
computer’s internal clock. TODAY returns just the date. If the date or time is 
wrong, it can’t help you with that.
A common use of NOW is to return the date and time for a printed report. 
You know, so a message such as “Printed on 10/24/2004 10:15” can be put on 
the printed paper.
A common use for TODAY is to calculate the elapsed time between a past date 
and “today.” For example, you may be tracking a project’s duration. A cell on 
the worksheet has the start date. Another cell has a formula that subtracts 
that date from TODAY. The answer is the number of days that have gone by.
NOW and TODAY take no arguments. The syntax for each follows:
=NOW()
=TODAY()

357
 Chapter 19: Ten Functions You Really Should Know
 
When you put either NOW or TODAY in a cell, the format automatically 
changes to the default date format. That way the date and (with NOW) time 
display properly. You can change to a different date/time format if desired by 
right-clicking the cell and selecting Format Cells from the pop-up menu.
HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP
HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP both find a value in a table. A table is an area of 
rows and columns that you define. Both of these functions work by using a 
search value for the first argument that, when found in the table, helps return 
a different value.
In particular you use HLOOKUP to return a value in a row that is in the same 
column as the search value. You use VLOOKUP to return a value in a column 
that is in the same row as the search value. The syntax for these functions 
follows:
=HLOOKUP(lookup value, table area, row, match type)
=VLOOKUP(lookup value, table area, column, match type)
ISNUMBER
A rose is a rose and by any other name would smell as sweet, but numbers 
don’t get off that easy. For example, 15 is a digit, but fifteen is a word. The 
ISNUMBER function tells you, flat-out true or false, if a value in a cell is a 
number (including the results of formulas). The syntax follows:
=ISNUMBER(value)
MIN and MAX
MIN and MAX find the respective lowest or highest numeric value in a range 
of values. These functions take up to 30 arguments, and an argument can be a 
range. Therefore, you can test a large list of numbers simply by entering the 
list as a range. The syntax for these functions follows:
=MAX(number1,number2,...)
=MIN(number1,number2,...)

358
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can also use MIN and MAX with a range, as shown here:
=MAX(A1:A12)
or with more than one range, such as this:
=MAX(A1:A12, B1:B12)
SUMIF and COUNTIF
SUMIF and COUNTIF, respectively, sum or count values if a supplied criterion 
is met. This makes for some robust calculations. With these functions it’s 
easy to return answers for a question such as “How many shipments went 
out in October?” or “How many times did the DJIA go over 10,000 last year?”
SUMIF takes three arguments:
 
✓ A range in which to apply the criteria
 
✓ The actual criteria
 
✓ The range from which to sum values
A key point here is that the first argument may or may not be the same range 
from which values are summed. Therefore, you can use SUMIF for a question 
such as “How many shipments went out in October?” but also for one such as 
“What is the sum of the numbers over 100 in this list?” The syntax for SUMIF 
follows:
=SUMIF(range,criteria,sum_range)
Note too that the third argument in SUMIF can be left out. When this hap-
pens, SUMIF uses the first argument as the range in which to apply the crite-
ria and also as the range from which to sum.
COUNTIF counts the number of items in a range that match criteria. This is 
just a count. The value of the items that match the criteria doesn’t matter 
past the fact that it matches the criteria. But after a cell’s value matches the 
criteria, the count of that cell is 1. COUNTIF takes just two arguments:
 
✓ The range from which to count the number of values
 
✓ The criteria to apply
The syntax for COUNTIF follows:
COUNTIF(range,criteria)

he hits just keep on coming! Just when you thought you had all the Excel 
functions down pat, here we go rocking the boat. Add this mix of useful 
functions to your plate of Excel goodies and you will be that much more of an 
Excel master. Be the envy of all the kids on the block!
Work with Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal, 
and Binary Numbers
In certain lines of work, it is desirable or even necessary to work in another 
base system. Designing computer systems is a good example. The computer 
chips that run our PCs work with a binary system. Circuits are either on or 
off. This means that there are just two possible states — and they are often 
expressed as 0 and 1.
In base 2, or binary, all numbers are expressed with the digit 0 or 1. The 
number 20 as we know it in decimal is 10100 in binary. The number 99 is 
1100011. The binary system is based on powers of 2.
In other words, in base 10 you count up through ten digits in one position 
before moving one position to the left for the next significant digit. And then 
the first position cycles back to the beginning digit. To make it simple, you 
count 0 to 9, and then add a 1 to the next significant digit, and start the first 
position over at 0, and therefore 10 comes after 9.

360
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Binary, octal, and hexadecimal each count up to a different digit before 
incrementing the next significant digit. Binary only has two values — 0 and 1. 
That’s why when any larger base number, such as a base 10 number, is con-
verted to binary, there are more actual digit places. Look at what happens to 
the number 20. In base 10, 20 is represented in 2 digits. In binary, 20 is repre-
sented in 5 digits.
Octal, based on powers of 8, counts up to 8 digits — 0 through 7. The digits 8 and 
9 are never used in octal. Hexadecimal, based on powers of 16, counts up to 16 
digits, but how? What is left after 9? The letters of the alphabet, that’s what!
Hexadecimal uses these digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The 
letters A through F represent the decimal values 10 through 15, respectively. 
If you have ever worked on the colors for a Web site, you might know that 
FFFFFF is all white. The Web server recognizes colors represented in hexa-
decimal notation and responds appropriately.
The number 200 in decimal notation becomes C8 in hexadecimal notation. 
The number 99 in decimal notation becomes 63 in hexadecimal notation.
Enough theory! The point to all this is that there are a group of functions to 
do all these conversions. These functions take into account all combinations 
of conversion between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. These func-
tions are

 Chapter 20: Ten or so Really Cool Functions
Convert Units of Measurement
CONVERT is a really great function that Excel provides. Not surprisingly, it 
converts things, or more specifically, it converts measurements. The number 
of measurements it converts is truly impressive. The function converts feet 
to inches, meters to feet, Fahrenheit to Celsius, pints to liters, horsepower to 
watts, and much more. In fact, there are ten categories that contain dozens of 
units of measure to convert from and to. The categories follow:
 
✓ Weight and mass
 
✓ Distance
 
✓ Time
 
✓ Pressure
 
✓ Force
 
✓ Energy
 
✓ Power
 
✓ Magnetism
 
✓ Temperature
 
✓ Liquid measure
The function takes three arguments: the value, the “from” unit of measure, 
and the “to” unit of measure. As an example, here is the function syntax for 
converting 10 gallons to liters: =CONVERT(10,”gal”, “l”). By the way, the 
answer is 37.85.
Find the Greatest Common Divisor and 
the Least Common Multiple
A greatest common divisor is the largest integer that divides evenly into each 
number in a set of numbers. In other words, it divides with no remainder. Take 
the numbers 5, 10, and 100. The greatest common divisor is 5 because each of 
the numbers divided by 5 returns another integer (no decimal portion).
The GCD function takes up to 255 values as its arguments. Noninteger values are 
truncated. By its nature any returned greatest common divisor must equal or be 
smaller than the lowest argument value. Often there is no greatest common divisor 
other than 1 — which all integers share. The syntax for the GCD function follows:
GCD(number1,number2, ...)
The least common multiple is an integer that is the lowest multiple common 
among a group of integers. For example, the least common multiple of 2, 4, 
and 6 is 12. The least common multiple of 9, 15, and 48 is 720.
The LCM function takes up to 29 values as its arguments. Noninteger values 
are truncated. The syntax for the LCM multiple function follows:
LCM(number1,number2, ...)

362
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Easy Random Number Generation
The Excel RAND function returns a number between 0 and 1. And that’s it. 
Usually you have to massage the returned number into something useful. 
The typical thing to do is multiply it by some number to get it within a range 
of values, then add the lower limit to that, and finally to use INT to turn the 
whole thing into an integer. The days of drudgery are over!
The RANDBETWEEN function returns a random integer between two values. 
Two arguments are used — the low end of the range and the high end of the 
range. Just what we need! For example, =RANDBETWEEN(5, 10) returns a 
whole number between 5 and 10. Always.
Converting to Roman Numerals
C, V, L, I; We get these mixed up. Is C for 100 or 1000? What is L for? Whew, 
we don’t have to memorize these anymore.
The ROMAN function takes care of it all. Just throw a number in the normal 
format we are familiar with and out comes the equivalent Roman numeral. 
Easy! The syntax is =ROMAN(number to convert, optional style).
Factoring in a Factorial
If you like multiplication, then you will love the FACT function. A factorial, 
simply put, is the product of multiplying sequential integers. In math notation 
6! (notice the exclamation point) is to say 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x6, which equals 
720. Try it on your calculator or use an Excel sheet of course.
The FACT function makes the tedious entry go away, which we think you will 
like. FACT just takes a number — the number of integers to use for the grand 
product. Figure 20-2 shows some examples.
Determining Part of a Year with YEARFRAC
If you need to know what percentage of a year a range of dates is, Excel has 
the perfect function for you! YEARFRAC returns a percentage of a year. You 
feed the function a start and end date, and an optional basis for how to count 
dates (such as a 360-day year, a 365-day year, and so on.). The number given 
back from the function is a percentage — a number less than 1 assuming the 
range of dates is less than a full year. An exact one-year range returns 1, and 
a range longer than a year returns a number more than 1.
