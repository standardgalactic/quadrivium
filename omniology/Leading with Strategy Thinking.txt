Praise for Leading with Strategic Thinking
“This is a very practical book, highlighting how the best leaders and
organizations gain strategic insight and then make change happen. In the
armed forces we take both strategy and leadership very seriously—this book
does justice to both topics.”
—General Richard Myers,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Military (Retired)
“Leading with Strategic Thinking is an important, new contribution to the
practice of leadership. Deﬁning the intersection between business strategy and
strategic management reveals multiple paths to leadership development—at a
point in time or over time. I applaud Aaron and BK for making leadership
more accessible for all of us.”
—Renetta McCann,
Chief Talent Ofﬁcer, Leo Burnett
“Through a powerful blend of diverse leadership examples and academic
insights, Olson and Simerson provide a framework of leadership types that
masterfully address the two competencies required of any successful leader:
having strategic insight and driving strategic change.”
—Marc Knez,
Clinical Professor of Strategic Management,
University of Chicago Booth School of Business
“Across industries, many leaders are encouraged to improve their strategic
skills.Often,thepathtoskillenhancementisnotclear.WhatIappreciateabout
this book is the tangible behaviors, real-life case studies and speciﬁc actions
to address the strategic needs of a leader and an organization. I strongly

“Kudos to Olson and Simerson for giving us clear, compelling, and relevant
approaches to strategic leadership, change, and implementation. Whether you
are in the C-Suite or aspiring to get there, this book illustrates how strategic
leaders can ﬁnd the right way to adapt their approach. The examples, from
established enterprises like Google and 3M, to entrepreneurial start-ups and
even vast public sector transformations, make this a ‘must-read,’ whether you
desire to lead a public company, a venture backed start-up, or an emerging
not-for-proﬁt. A great book that everyone on the team should read.”
—Michael C. Krauss,
President, Market Strategy Group;
“@ C-Level” columnist for Marketing News
“Great leadership is all about adjusting to new context. Aaron and BK provide
us with a framework and insights to not only manage the disorientation of
shifting context but to leverage it for better business results.”

Foreword
Disruptive change requires a new type of strategic leadership. While it
is hard to deﬁne, we know what it looks like when we see it and when
we don’t. This book creates a new lexicon for this critical skill set and
actionable ideas on how to develop a strategic perspective, apply
adaptive thinking, and demonstrate courageous leadership.
A good example of the complex challenges we face is health care.
It’s clear that the traditional way of delivering health beneﬁts—and
health care—is broken. Costs continue to rise unabated, and the health
of the population continues to decline. Nowhere is this more acute than
in the United States. For the ﬁrst time in decades, key stakeholders from
employers, to insurance carriers, to health care providers, to govern-
ment are all working on ways to ﬁx a system that is ripe for fundamental
change. In my recent discussions with literally hundreds of government
leaders, CEOs in the health care industry, and senior executives at some
of the world’s largest employers, they are all trying to make sense of their
role in an evolving health environment. They must rethink their
deﬁnition of health and performance, reexamine the strength of the
implied contract for health between employers and employees, and
reconsider their role in transforming the health ecosystem in ways that
align risk and consequences and drive healthy behaviors and outcomes.
This is just one example of a new breed of disruptive forces that are
fueling upstarts and challenging incumbents in almost every industry

and economy around the world. Advances in technology are trans-
forming every aspect of our lives—enabling new solutions, services,
and products delivered in a highly personalized way. The rise of
consumerism is giving new power to the individual and raising
expectations for the information and access needed to make increas-
ingly consequential choices that affect our security and well-being.
Likewise, globalization is creating both opportunity and competition
as people and countries become increasingly intertwined.
Navigating these kinds of systemic change requires strategy and
leadership. Finding the right solutions will require strategic analysis,
design, and planning. Driving the necessary change will require strong
leadership that embraces diverse thought, builds trust, creates momen-
tum, and removes barriers. Without both strategy and leadership, we
risk making incremental progress that doesn’t address the real under-
lying problems we face.
The urgent need for strategic leadership exists at every level. We
need leaders who can see opportunities arising from complex, highly
interdependent problems. We need frontline leaders who can lead
the charge, inﬂuencing others to embrace new ways of working
together—and working for one another to achieve a common
mission. We need individuals who are motivated to reinvent their
own work and equipped to make trade-offs between competing
priorities without constant direction from above.
Strategic leadership is easy to recognize when it is present—or
missing—but it is often hard to describe. I’ve worked with many
leaders in my career who possess the ability to assess an environment
and quickly adapt their approach to suit the situation. I’ve probably
worked with more who were unable to deconstruct a challenge,
consider alternatives and consequences, and work differently to get
the desired results. I’ve realized that the best leaders see patterns that
others don’t and can turn these observations into unique actions. They
enroll and empower those around them to actively participate in
problem solving. Most importantly, they aren’t afraid to seek feedback
and make course corrections when needed along the way. This book

helps motivate, develop, and support individuals and organizations to
bring together strategic thinking and strong leadership.
Aaron and BK offer fresh and pragmatic insights into what it
means to approach a problem strategically and then lead through the
required change. I’ve enjoyed spending time with them sharing some
of my real-life examples of what strategic leaders actually do when
addressing real-world problems and opportunities. As teachers, coaches,
and leaders themselves, they’ve used their own experiences, along with
insights from their deep networks, to capture crucial aspects of strategic
leadership in practical terms that are easy to understand and apply. The
result is a new and powerful language on how to lead through strategic
change.
I look forward to seeing this book help organizations and indi-
viduals lead more strategically and with more sustainable impact.

Preface
“You need to be more strategic.” When someone receives this kind of
feedback, what does it mean?
We believe that too often strategic thinking is deﬁned narrowly
and is misunderstood. Strategic thinking is deﬁned narrowly when its
relevance is seen as being limited to senior executives responsible for
deﬁning strategic direction. This narrow deﬁnition overlooks the
value that is created when everyone in an organization approaches
work in a more strategic manner. This is particularly true in times of
disruption, when forces of technology and social change challenge the
status quo and create opportunities for massive improvements in
collaboration, productivity, and value creation. Likewise, strategic
thinking is misunderstood when it is thought of as synonymous with
strategic planning. This limits the relevance and application of a key
skill that can and should be applied in a wide range of contexts.
Strategic thinking can and should improve the performance of CEOs,
but it can and should also be applied by line managers, individual
contributors, politicians, coaches, and parents. For these reasons, being
competent in strategic thinking is critical for individuals and organi-
zations. Practiced well, it drives performance and distinguishes high
potentials. Practiced poorly, it destroys value and derails careers.
Strategic thinking comprises three key activities: assessing situa-
tions, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. Relevant concepts

and tools from the ﬁelds of cognitive psychology, systems thinking,
and game theory can enhance any leader’s ability to think strategically.
It is in the application of strategic thinking to the art of leadership
where many experts and books on this topic neglect to address
important insights. Broader than a set of best practices or a strategic
plan, strategic leadership:
■
Acknowledges both the planned and emergent nature of gaining
strategic insight,
■
Considers the nuances of effectively driving strategic change, and
■
Varies widely as a reﬂection of both personal style and context.
These issues, often overlooked, are the primary focus of this book.
In it we explore academic literature, popular opinion, real-world data,
and case studies that inform our deﬁnition of strategic leadership.
We have written this book especially for those seeking answers to
questions about the intersection of strategic thinking and leadership.
The readers of this book will likely fall into one of several categories:
■
Aspiring and seasoned leaders: We wrote this book speciﬁcally for
you, and designed it to be focused and practical. It has value in its
entirety, but any speciﬁc chapter can stand alone and provide
actionable advice. Use our book as a practical guide when
(1) embarking on a new venture in which you want to weigh
and select the most appropriate approach, (2) taking on new or
expanded responsibilities that require you to reconsider how you
approach your work, (3) reﬂecting on your work and how
you consider your role, or (4) receiving feedback suggesting
that you become more effective and have greater impact.
■
Consultants and advisors can use our book to coach leaders on
the essentials of strategic thinking and leadership. From our
experience, the concepts and tools in this book are well suited to
help leaders at any level or with any amount of experience
consider the challenges that sit at the intersection of strategy and
leadership.

Academicians and students can use this book to teach or learn
what leaders must do when driving strategy within various
contexts, under different circumstances, and with different pur-
poses in mind. While this book is intended to serve as a practical
guide rather than an academic text, we have based our writing on
well-regarded principles validated by empirical research. We
wrote this book because we identiﬁed speciﬁc relationships
between strategy and leadership that we do not see being fully
addressed in today’s popular or academic literature.
With these readers in mind, we have written a book intended to
be as enjoyable to read as it is practical. While some books focus on
strategic thinking and others on leadership, this book focuses on the
intersection of the two topics. In looking at these relationships, we will
address:
■
The major contexts and circumstances within which strategic
thinking and leadership typically occur,
■
Four types of strategic leadership that integrate strategy formula-
tion and execution, and
■
How a leader can adapt their approach to best suit a given situation.
This book is composed of real examples. Organized around a
conceptualframework,itfocusesonpracticalcasesfeaturingrealleaders.
We draw these examples from our extensive experience working with
senior executives, leadership teams, and graduate students who have
applied these techniques to become more effective and achieve results.
This book’s chapters are sequenced to introduce broader concepts
and then provide tools likely to prove useful. The book contains six
chapters:
1. Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership. Presents the

of strategic leadership is introduced, and we review four examples
that demonstrate strategic thinking and leadership in action.

2. The Four Types of Strategic Leadership. Introduces our method-
ology and overarching framework. We describe the key activities
we see leaders typically apply when practicing one of four types of
strategic leadership:
a. Visionary Leadership: Driving strategy through personal vision.
b. Directive Leadership: Driving strategy through structure and
process.
c. Incubating Leadership: Driving strategy through empowering
others.
d. Collaborative Leadership: Driving strategy through cocreation.
3. Examples of Strategic Leadership. Four case studies describe what
real-world leaders do when applying the four types of strategic
leadership.
4. Applying Strategic Leadership. Spotlights how leaders can apply
the concepts of this book to make conscious decisions to lead
strategically, with a focus on gaining insight and driving change. A
case study highlights one leader’s intentional approach to adapt his
leadership style to get results.
5. Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy. Spotlights what
individuals, depending on their strategic leadership type, must (1)
consider as likely biases and blind spots, and the steps they must
take to mitigate them; and (2) do to garner the buy-in, commit-
ment, and advocacy of others. We provide examples to demon-
strate how strategic leaders draw upon the hearts, minds, and hands
of followers.
6. Developing Strategic Leadership. Showcases the skills that strategic
leaders must demonstrate to be effective as strategic leaders,
including how many of those skills vary depending on the type
of strategic leadership being applied. We highlight practical exam-
ples of how we see strategic leadership developed at both the
individual and organizational levels.

leaders were an essential part of our work. The strategic thinkers and

Introduction
Whether responsible for one or many, whether attempting to inﬂuence
an individual or a nation, we consider strategic thinking and leadership
to be of paramount importance.
Issues and Considerations
Strategic thinking and leadership are effective only if they occur
within the proper context. Their relevance is only clear if you
have ﬁrst thought about several fundamental questions: What do
you care about? What are your challenges? What do you aspire to
become? How do you wish to contribute to your colleagues, team,
organization, or community?
Answers to such fundamental questions open the door to a slate of
additional questions. How do you interpret the present, past, and
future? How do you identify and analyze the full range of available
options? How do you inﬂuence others to support your chosen course
of action? What actions will you take to achieve the impact you desire?
This book goes beyond the mechanics of strategic thinking and
leadership. We will explore the motives and preferences that lead to an
individual thinking and acting strategically. Regardless of your goal,
information provided in this book will help you recognize and

leverage the positive aspects of your personal style and also avoid your
personal blind spots.
In some ways, strategic thinking is like constructing a mental map
that connects the current “here and now” to something, somewhere,
or sometime in the future. Just like a road map that will take you from
the countryside into the center of a large city, strategic thinking gives
you a general feel for your route, gives you waypoints that help
designate your path, and provides guidance if things turn sideways
while you are en route.
The Importance of Holistic Perspective
Strategic thinking occurs during every phase of your overall effort.
Such a holistic perspective helps you raise awareness of key consider-
ations, build conﬁdence regarding the appropriate path forward, and
increase precision in executing planned actions.
A leader beneﬁts from a holistic perspective just as a pilot beneﬁts
from considering all aspects of ﬂying an aircraft. A close colleague who is
a pilot recently told us about the roles, responsibilities, and considera-
tions of piloting a twin-engine airplane. He pointed out that operating a
high-performance airplane capable of cruising at 520 miles per hour at
altitudes of more than 49,000 feet carries a lot of responsibility. At that
speed, the plane is covering almost 8.7 miles each minute or the
equivalent of two football ﬁelds each second. To function in a
responsible manner, pilots adhere to certain principles that help
them maintain a holistic perspective. It is critical that the pilot be aware
of what is happening within their own mind and body, within the
cockpit and aircraft, and within the surrounding 50 to 75 miles of
airspace. Our colleague suggests these are some of the guiding principles
pilots consider when handling an airplane:
■
Your focus and attention must “stay ahead of the airplane.”
■
You must be forward looking and forward thinking.
xxii

■
You should direct your eyes outside of the cockpit approximately
90 percent of the time, directing your eyes inside the cockpit 10
percent of the time.
■
You should use multiple cockpit instruments to verify or discount
the data you receive from any one instrument, in order to alert
you to a malfunctioning instrument.
■
You must properly “manage the cockpit.” Awareness is only half
of the equation, and cockpit resource management ensures that
the pilot receives full beneﬁt from all of the available resources,
including data from cockpit instruments, recommendations from
fellow crew members, observations from outside the cockpit, and
guidance coming from air trafﬁc controllers.
■
You must ensurefull understanding of who isin control—therecan
only be one pilot in command of the aircraft at any given time.
Clearly, piloting an aircraft requires a holistic perspective. We ﬁnd
that the same is true for effective strategic thinking. In the course of
our work advising individuals and organizations, we have found that
the most effective leaders take similar steps to achieve appropriate
awareness, anticipate required actions, share responsibility, mitigate
risk, and ensure intended outcomes.
The Importance of Context
Just as a holistic perspective improves strategic thinking by ensuring that
all factors are considered, it is also important to consider context. One of
us (Simerson) grew up in a rural area of North Carolina known for its
cattle. There I learned that there are two primary techniques for manag-
ing livestock. In this context, the prevailing wisdom is that close-
quarter rangemanagement is betterthan open-range management. The
close proximity of the herd allows one to monitor and manage each
head of livestock more closely. That said, the same technique is not
better from a broader perspective—population density creates issues of
disease control and environmental impact management.

For the more urban reader, consider this question: Does having a
swimming pool increase the property value of your home? It turns
out that it depends. Conversations with a local real estate profes-
sional suggest that if you have a swimming pool, it does not add to
the value of your home. Most agents believe it actually lowers the
value because many prospective buyers do not want the added cost
of maintenance, are concerned about decreased yard space, or worry
about their children. That said, if your neighbors have a swimming
pool and you also have a swimming pool, your property value will
be comparable to your neighbors’. And, in fact, if you are one of the
few in your neighborhood who does not have a swimming pool,
your property value will go down. The old mantra “location,
location, location” holds true here. The inﬂuence or impact of
having a swimming pool differs according to where the property is
located.
The Importance of Applying Perspective and Context
We consider questions to be a critical element of strategic thinking.
Both the number of questions asked and the nature and scope of those
questions are both important. On this front, a conversation that one of
us overheard while serving as a law enforcement executive comes to
mind. A patrol commander and a crime analyst were discussing the
ability to predict the likely time and location of armed robberies based
on available data. This was an important issue, in that our local
community had experienced a spate of armed robberies at several
local convenience stores committed by what was presumed to be the
same individual.
As they discussed the matter, it became increasingly clear that the
commander’s comments were focused mainly on the precision and
accuracy of the forecast, while the crime analyst’s comments centered
on matters related to maintaining a holistic perspective and context. As
the commander kept asking for more detail, the analyst kept focusing
xxiv
Introduction

3GCINTRO
03/10/2015
2:0:21
Page xxv
on what patrol ofﬁcers would do with the information. Experience
suggests neither set of questions was right or better than the other.
Although it is unrealistic to expect predictions to be 100 percent
accurate, a certain level of precision is needed in order to ensure the
utilization of resources. A forecast that is 99 percent accurate is much
better than one that is only 60 percent accurate. That said, achieving
99 percent accuracy is only useful if it inﬂuences or impacts actions in
some planned and purposeful way.
These situations showcase the underlying tenet of this book: Strate-
gic thinking only matters if it leads to purposeful action. Furthermore,
leadership only matters if it is informed by a clear understanding of
context and perspective. It is strategic leadership—the result of leader-
ship actions informed by strategic thinking—that drives meaningful
results.
Fundamental Questions
With these issues in mind, we highlight a few of the questions that
colleagues, clients, and students have raised with us when discussing
strategic thinking and leadership. We believe you will be able to relate
to many, if not all, of them.

These and other questions inform our focus in writing this book, as
do hundreds of other conversations we’ve had with leaders in both
professional and casual situations. We don’t address all of them directly,
but we’re conﬁdent that you will gain insight into each of them and into
your own questions as you work your way through this text.
Strategic thinking—with its emphasis on assessing situations,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions—is a compelling impera-
tive in today’s complex, changing, and risk-laden world. While the
focus and process of strategic thinking may vary, it is always key to
maintaining perspective and focus when the external environment
changes. Leadership—with its emphasis on inﬂuencing others toward
a chosen course of action—is equally compelling. While the manner

in which leadership is exercised may change, it is nonetheless key to
having an impact on your team, organization, community, industry,
or profession.
These are the considerations and questions we intend to address as
we explore the key aspects of leading with strategic thinking. The next
chapter presents fundamental concepts that deﬁne both strategic
thinking and leadership, and provides real-world examples of strategic
leadership in practice.

Fundamentals of
Strategic Thinking
and Leadership
To adequately address the issues and questions we raised in the
Introduction, we must recognize and understand the nature of
strategic thinking and leadership. To do so, we will begin by
addressing each as an independent topic. We will also explore the
important relationship between them. After reviewing their nature
and elements, we will turn our attention to their application through
several stories of strategic thinking and leadership in action.
The Nature of Strategic Thinking
Achieving a meaningful understanding of strategic thinking involves
addressing several interrelated topics. From an academic perspective,
we see strategic thinking at the intersection of three ﬁelds of study:
cognitive psychology, systems thinking, and game theory.

Cognitive psychology is the study of perception, creativity, deci-
sion making, and thinking. Systems thinking is an approach to
understanding how systems behave, interact with their environment,
and inﬂuence each other. Game theory is the study of decision making
when the decision involves two or more parties (the decision maker
and the opponent or adversary). While these are all academic disci-
plines, they address highly practical real-world matters. Applying
cognitive psychology helps you manage your biases and blind spots.
Systems thinking helps you broaden the slate of factors you consider
when evaluating options and prioritizing actions. Game theory helps
you further recognize the ramiﬁcations of your decisions and actions
and take steps to mitigate opposing forces. We will now explore each
of these disciplines in terms of how they inﬂuence and impact strategic
thinking and strategic leadership.

Before we begin, we should note that the purpose of this chapter is
not to provide an exhaustive review of the research that has been
conducted in each of these three ﬁelds. Rather, our intent is to lay the
foundation for subsequent chapters and provide enough information
to raise your level of awareness of considerations impacting your
ability to think and lead strategically.
Cognitive Psychology
The term cognitive psychology was ﬁrst used in 1967.1 It is the branch of
psychology that studies mental processes regarding how people
perceive, solve problems, make decisions, and become motivated.
Although cognitive psychology includes the study of memory and
how individuals sense and interpret external stimuli, the most relevant
elements for our purposes include how preconceived notions and
beliefs inﬂuence and impact your analysis, the conclusions you draw,
and the decisions you make. It also reveals the impact of mental
models and processes on our focus, self-awareness, and awareness of
the environment. Combined, these factors inﬂuence how we perceive
our current reality, interpret existing and emerging opportunities, and
imagine the future we desire.
In essence, cognitive psychology helps us explore and understand
the way we interpret and interact with the environment. We consider
this important because interpretation involves our grasping and analyz-
ing information, and interaction involves our managing, altering, or
manipulating our current or future environment.
Types of Discovery
The questions we ask are a key inﬂuence on how we interpret and
interact with the environment. For example, what questions do we
typically use when seeking to comprehend? When thinking about

the future? When attempting to identify viable alternatives? A series
of studies conducted by noted psychologist Jerome Bruner in the
1960s revealed that individuals have a natural tendency to ask
certain types of questions when attempting to understand situations,
events, and circumstances. His research revealed two types of
questions, rooted in concepts called “episodic empiricism” and
“cumulative constructionism.” Episodic empiricism is manifest in
questions unrelated to or unbound by existing rules, laws, and
principles—they are the questions typically used when attempting
to make sense of the world and decide on a path forward. In this
case, the question becomes the new hypothesis. Cumulative con-
structionism, on the other hand, manifests as questions intended to
add clarity to existing understanding, paradigms, and structure.2 Put
simply, some questions focus on “drilling down,” while others focus
on “broadening.”
For example, consider the two types of questions that can be asked
about a commercial-transport airplane crash. Cumulative construc-
tionism–type questions, intended to drill down, might include:
■
When did the crash occur?
■
How far from the departure airport was the crash?
■
How far from the arrival airport was the crash?
■
Did the pilots declare an emergency prior to the crash?
■
Were there any eyewitnesses to the crash?
■
If there were eyewitnesses, what did they see?
■
Was anyone on the ground injured or killed?
■
Did the pilots deviate from the ﬂight plan prior to the crash?
■
Did the airplane strike a mountain or another airplane?
■
Were there any survivors?
Episodic empiricism–type questions, asked to broaden one’s think-
ing, might include:
■
What type of material was the transport airplane carrying?
■
What is the safety record of the company owning the airplane?
4

■
What was the safety record of the ﬂight crew?
■
Who manufactured the airplane?
■
What is the safety record of airplanes built by this particular
manufacturer?
■
How do all of the above compare to other airplanes, ﬂight crews,
and airplane manufacturers?
■
How do all of the above compare to equipment, operators, and
manufacturers in other industries?
Both lines of questioning are important. The value lies in under-
standing the difference and appropriate use of each.
From our perspective, the former type of questions are valid but
will likely lead you down the current path to a certain conclusion and
decision, albeit one with a greater level of detail. In contrast, the latter
type of questions will likely lead you to a broader understanding and
ultimately to a new and potentially more creative insight through
considering more options.
The Role of Cognitive Ability
Another branch of cognitive psychology focuses on the role of
intelligence in decision making and problem solving. While these
activities are undoubtedly a component of strategy, we deemphasize
the role of intelligence in strategic thinking and strategic leadership.
Our stance is consistent with the conclusion that Bruner came to in his
analysis of creativity:
Nothing has been said about ability, or abilities. What shall we say of energy,
of combinatorial zest, of intelligence, of alertness, of perseverance? I shall say
nothing about them. They are obviously important but, from a deeper point of
view, they are also trivial. For at any level of energy or intelligence there can be
more or less of creating in our sense. Stupid people create for each other as well
as beneﬁting from what comes from afar. So too do slothful and torpid people.
I have been speaking of creativity, not of genius.3

Creativity is manifest in a wide range of circumstances, indepen-
dent of basic intelligence. Given this, we do not consider intelligence
to play a distinguishing role in strategic thinking or strategic leadership.
Instead, we consider several other cognitive characteristics to be
important, including the following:
■
The ability to recognize and take advantage of personal strengths
and mitigate personal weaknesses,
■
Comfort with and ability to understand complexity,
■
The ability to recognize related concepts and principles,
■
Self-conﬁdence and belief in oneself,
■
Comfort with ambiguity and uncertainty,
■
A willingness to take risks,
■
The courage of conviction,
■
The willingness to draw conclusions and make decisions, and
■
Personal assertiveness.
These cognitive characteristics consistently have been proven to
correlate with creativity.4
We believe that cognitive activities associated with the creative
process5 enable strategic thinking. These activities—while perhaps not
always discrete or linear—typically include the following:
■
Preparation: Becoming familiar with existing works, what has
been done, how challenges are typically addressed, and how
opportunities are typically seized.
■
Incubation: Allocating time to the creative process, such that
ideas and thoughts combine and awareness and understanding
materialize.
■
Insight: Combining existing concepts, principles, frameworks,
and models to form new relationships, combinations, associations,
or structures.
■
Veriﬁcation: Assessing and elaborating on new ideas to determine
whether they are likely to be brought to fruition and molded into
a complete product.

Types of Thought Processes
Whether your approach to problem solving and decision making
involves sequential steps or taking intuitive leaps may depend partly
on what research psychologist Gary Klein describes as System 1 and
System 2 thinking.6 System 1 thinking involves applying instinct and
intuition, which are in essence experience-based and expertise-driven.
System 2 thinking involves applying and following preestablished
steps and procedures. System 1 is somewhat unstructured, emergent,
and omnidirectional, while System 2 is linear, somewhat rigidly
sequenced, and unidirectional. While System 2 will help ensure you
do not make serious mistakes in your logic or thinking, it alone is not
enough. Much like the list of drill-down, cumulative construction–
type questions we cited earlier, System 2 thinking alone proves
inadequate in terms of raising, considering, and addressing the myriad
issues in our complex, ambiguous, and uncertain world. System 1
thinking is much more effective at raising these issues.
In his inﬂuential book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel Prize winner
Daniel Kahneman7 provides examples of activities attributed to
System 1 thinking:
■
Determining that one object in the distance is closer than another.
■
Looking toward the direction of a loud and sudden sound.
■
Completing the phrase “peanut butter and . . .”
■
Making a “sad face” when shown a heartbreaking photo.
■
Detecting anger in someone’s voice.
■
Understanding two- to three-word sentences.
■
Driving a vehicle on an empty road.
Kahneman also provides examples attributed to System 2 thinking:
■
Looking for a person wearing a red hat.
■
Walking faster than normal.
■
Self-monitoring and self-regulating your behavior.

■
Stating your telephone number.
■
Comparing and contrasting the value of consumer goods.
■
Completing and submitting the annual tax form.
■
Evaluating a complex logical argument.
Just like the two types of questions highlighted earlier, System 1 and
System 2 thinking both serve different purposes.
We believe that System 1 and System 2 exploration is not an
either-or proposition. Rather, we consider both to be conducive to
credible analysis and exploration. The issue therefore is not which
System to apply but, rather, when to emphasize each and what risks
to consider when placing too much emphasis on one or the other.
More speciﬁcally, when should you apply a process-driven meth-
odology and when should you broaden your thinking to include or
emphasize intuition or instinct? What are the trade-offs or risks of
placing too much emphasis on one type of thinking and too little on
the other?
While the preceding exploration focuses heavily on the internal
cognitive process, it is imperative that the internal process occurs with
conscious awareness of context. Alva Noë, a professor of philosophy
and expert in the theory of perception, emphasizes the importance of
paying attention both to what one is doing and how one is doing it at
any given moment:
Suppose I am a hiker. I walk along and move my legs in all sorts of subtle
ways to follow a path along a trail. But the steps I take and the way I move my
legs are modulated by, controlled by, the textures and bumps and patterns of
the trail itself. There is a kind of locking in. To study experience, to think
about the nature of experience, is to look at this two-way dynamic exchange
between the world and the active perceiver.8
Context is as critical to the leaders’ thinking as it is to the hiker’s walk.
Conversations with Bobby Duby,9 a world-class hunter, showcase
these tenets. Bobby is a hunter even hunting opponents like. He takes
8

steps to follow all state laws pertaining to wildlife conservation and
hunting, only kills enough animals to provides an adequate amount of
meat for his family, takes steps to leave only footprints behind when
leaving a hunting area, works with local wildlife ofﬁcers when he
comes across illegal or questionable practices, and does all that he can
to help ensure the animals he shoots do not suffer. He also takes steps
to level the playing ﬁeld. For example, he only hunts with a
compound bow, hunts only on land in which game has escape routes,
and does not bait his prey. Bobby realizes taking these steps comes
with a price; in all likelihood, they decrease his success as a hunter.
This is noteworthy given that some people pay professional guides up
to $15,000 to $20,000 to hunt as he does and where he does.
While attempting to follow the hunting principles of his fore-
fathers, what does Bobby do to increase the odds of his hunting trips
being successful? In many ways, he applies the thought processes and
discovery methods we have highlighted here—for example:
■
Bobby believes that there is no substitute for hunting time. The
more time you spend in the ﬁeld, the more likely you are to
succeed as a hunter.
■
He relies heavily on his intuition, which he believes is strengthened
each hunting season. In seeking to strengthen his intuition, he
believes that his failures are as important as his accomplishments.
■
Bobby studies maps of his hunting area, studies the ﬂora and fauna
therein, monitors weather patterns, and analyzes changes in
elevation of the terrain. He applies both structured analysis and
“a gut feeling” that he has developed over time to determine what
this information implies.
■
He periodically reassesses the situation during each hunting trip,
evaluating presenting events and circumstances to recognize
unanticipated and unexpected occurrences that might inﬂuence
his thinking and behavior during the remainder of the trip.
■
Bobby has conversations with as many individuals as he can who
might be familiar with the area, the wildlife, and prevailing or
emerging situations, events, and circumstances.

Page 10
These examples reﬂect the integrated application of both types of
discovery questions as well as both System 1 and System 2 thinking.
Bobby integrates these methods to improve his performance as a
hunter, just as we each have the opportunity to integrate practical
concepts from cognitive psychology into our work and daily lives.
Systems Thinking
We consider systems thinking to be a key element of strategic
thinking. Much has been written about systems thinking since noted
systems scientist Barry Richmond began studying and writing about
the topic in the late 1990s.10 Richmond considers most challenges
we face to be multifaceted, interconnected, and constantly changing.
He stresses the challenge of recognizing and understanding these
interdependencies when dealing with such complexity. Given this
challenge, he has been a champion for more effective methods of
thinking.
Types of Thinking
Unfortunately, many people do not think in a way that is likely to
recognize and understand the complexity that surrounds them.
Richmond notes that many people are raised to be linear, sequential,
and one-dimensional thinkers. For our purposes, we will focus our
discussion on the tendency of some individuals to demonstrate a
“checklist” mentality. While Richmond identiﬁes other important
implications of linear thinking, we emphasize the checklist mentality
because it is particularly relevant to our exploration in this book.
One implication of having a checklist mentality is considering
“cause” to be the one or two actions that occur immediately prior to a
particular event. Such a cause-effect relationship can reveal an
unconscious assumption that only directly linked factors can inﬂuence
10
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC01
03/10/2015

Page 11
an event in meaningful ways, underestimating the relevance and
impact of indirect causes and inﬂuences.
Whenever an incident occurs, an individual using this mode of
thinking would likely ask:
■
Have we identiﬁed the one or two actions immediately preceding
the state, event, or incident? If so, check.
■
Have we created a solution to be applied to the one or two
contributing factors? If so, check.
Having evaluated and conﬁrmed these two questions, the matter
would be considered closed. Unfortunately, this leaves several addi-
tional questions unexplored:
■
What other factors directly or indirectly inﬂuence the event?
■
Do each of these factors contribute equally, or do some have a
greater impact than others?
■
To what extent will a speciﬁc solution address the contributing
factors?
■
Which solutions should occur ﬁrst, second, and third to ensure
optimal results?
■
Is this event a symptom of some larger problem?
Each of these questions combats the checklist mentality by opening up
the possibility of discovering additional relevant data.
We frequently observe the checklist mentality at play when working
with our clients, colleagues, and graduate students. We therefore recog-
nize the strength of Richmond’s recommendations for countering such a
mind-set and helping us recognize and understand how things really
work.Hisrecommendationstaketheformofthefollowingdiscretetypes
of thinking that contribute to his broader deﬁnition of systems thinking:
■
Dynamic Thinking: Involves recognizing patterns and trends that
materialize over time rather than focusing on isolated factors,
events, or circumstances.
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership
11

3GC01
03/10/2015
2:8:42
Page 12
■
Closed-loop Thinking: Involves recognizing that systems consist
of connected and interdependent processes that do not ﬂow
one way but, rather, interact in dynamic and constantly changing
ways. An important facet of closed-loop thinking is that it helps
you recognize the role the individual plays in inﬂuencing the
system.
■
Generic Thinking: Involves recognizing the broad-based and
multifaceted implications of people, processes, systems, mecha-
nisms, and events. Using an example common in business school
courses, what might have happened if the railroad companies had
considered themselves to be part of the transportation industry
rather than merely being railroad companies? Might Southern
Railway now be responsible for transporting supplies to the
International Space Station?
■
Operational Thinking: Involves thinking in terms of how a
system, process, or mechanism actually works rather than how
it was intended to work. This helps one avoid falling into the trap
of assuming that the system designed in the planning process will
perform “in accordance to plan” simply because that was the
original intent.
■
Continuum Thinking: Involves recognizing that what seems like
opposing forces typically are connected and have certain com-
monalities or interdependencies. Such recognition allows one to
ﬁnd common ground upon which to build rather than continuing
to focus on the boundaries and disconnections.
Each of these examples provides concrete ways to apply systems
thinking to avoid the checklist mentality and to understand more
accurately the dynamics typically at play in a given situation.
Systems Thinking in Groups
Just as systems thinking can help individuals think more strategically, it
can also help teams and organizations. In the 1980s, Peter Senge
conducted research to discover how organizations build learning
12
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC01

Page 13
capacity and why some organizations are better at learning than others.
The practices that differentiate the effective learning organization are
referred to as the Five Learning Disciplines, all of which we consider to
contribute to strategic thinking:
■
Shared Vision: Involves formulating a compelling vision to create
commitment among a group to “pull” individuals toward the
envisioned future state.
■
Mental Models: Involves surfacing the values, assumptions, and
expectations that determine the way people think and behave. We
will describe tools later in this chapter that can help challenge
existing assumptionsandensure that contributorsworking together
to turn the vision into reality do so in a consistent and mutually
supportive manner.
■
Personal Mastery: Involves taking steps to strengthen self-aware-
ness about how we think, draw conclusions, make decisions, and
manage conﬂict, as well as how we apply these to establish,
manage, and strengthen relationships.
■
Team Learning: Involves teams working together to review
situations and gain mutual understanding of what they had hoped
to accomplish, how things progressed, and how they handled
unexpected and unplanned events. Doing so can reveal under-
lying and contributing factors, and identify necessary steps to
increase effectiveness and efﬁciency in the longer term. Again,
we will describe tools later in this chapter that can help teams
work together to identify lessons learned and establish new best
practices.
■
Systems Thinking: Helps teams and team members recognize
interconnected factors and forces that inﬂuence or impact events,
analyze events to understand related and contributing challenges
and opportunities, and identify ways to leverage the opportunities
and mitigate the challenges.11
The Five Learning Disciplines contribute to strategic thinking and
help organizations build learning capacity by emphasizing the impor-
tance of planned and purposeful thinking; the beneﬁt of teamwork

and teams composed of self-conﬁdent, self-motivated, and capable
team members; and the importance of individuals and teams thinking
through issues, considerations, and related implications prior to drawing
conclusions and making decisions.
Applying Systems Thinking
A case involving a multifacility medical center that provides “full life
cycle” health care services showcases how the effective use of systems
thinking might lead to better outcomes. In this scenario, the Emer-
gency Services Department is a well-known and highly recognized
trauma center, seeing scores of patients every day who are experienc-
ing some type of physical distress.
The department operates in an environment of continuous
improvement, measuring success through a variety of internal and
regulatory-driven metrics. The director of the Emergency Services
Department conducts quarterly patient satisfaction surveys to gain
insight into the overall impact of its policies and procedures, and
to measure the effectiveness and efﬁciency of its operation. A
special recognition program includes cards that patients and their
families can easily complete and submit to recognize exemplary
performance.
The director of the Emergency Services Department, troubled by
a decreasing Patient Satisfaction Index, or PSI, decides to take action.
The director’s strategic intent is to take steps to address concerns raised
by patients with the ultimate goal of increasing the department’s PSI.
Upon analyzing the data revealed through the quarterly patient
survey, she realizes that approximately 80 percent of the concerns
raised relate to wait time. Patients are spending two to four hours in
the waiting room per visit. The director’s examination of the data
reveals that concerns are being raised by “single appointment” patients
and recurring patients who receive extended care.
14
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC01
03/10/2015
2:8:42
Page 15
Further examination reveals that the concerns being raised mostly
center on the fact that patients entering the department at certain
hours miss meals. Those entering after 3:00 or 4:00 AM miss breakfast,
those entering after 9:00 or 10:00 AM miss lunch, and those entering
after 2:00 or 3:00 PM miss dinner. The director weighs the options and
decides to begin offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner to patients in the
waiting room during the appropriate hours.
Time passes, and new patient satisfaction surveys and comments
suggest the director’s solution is working. Single-appointment and
returning patients are pleased with the meals they now receive. The
department’s PSI is climbing, primarily as a result of increased satisfac-
tion relating to the catered meals. Happy to see this key performance
indicator returning to historical levels, the director takes satisfaction in a
job well done.
If the director had applied systems thinking concepts and princi-
ples, how might have her considerations, conclusions, decision(s), and
subsequent actions been different? In terms of her general considera-
tions, the director might have broadened her level of analysis to
include local, regional, and national emergency services departments.
She might have shifted her focus from attempting to increase patient
satisfaction by providing catered meals to attempting to increase
patient satisfaction by decreasing wait times. In terms of the questions
she asked, the director might have explored how effectively and
efﬁciently the Emergency Services Department operates within the
context of other similar emergency services organizations. Perhaps she
might have investigated how the department’s structure, systems,
processes, policies, or staff capabilities affect the department’s efﬁ-
ciency and effectiveness. In terms of the conclusions she drew and
decisions she made, the director and her colleagues might have
attempted to tackle the issue of patients using the Emergency Services
Department as their primary health care provider through patient
education. Alternately, they might have taken steps to strengthen
the integration of systems and processes to enhance efﬁciency and

Page 16
effectiveness. Perhaps they might have taken steps to bolster controls
and incentives to ensure employees at all levels are committed,
engaged, and motivated to work together to achieve the Emergency
Services Department’s goals and objectives.
In seeking the ultimate solution, they might have taken a variety of
additional steps likely to improve the department’s operating perform-
ance in more fundamental ways and thus increase patient satisfaction
and the department’s PSI in ways that don’t simply mask the deeper
problems within the department, as providing catered meals does. Any
of these ideas might more appropriately identify and address root cause
issues that were contributing to the presenting issue of wait times.
Exploring these ideas reﬂects the application of systems thinking.
Game Theory
In his best-selling novel State of Fear, Michael Crichton introduces a
slate of fascinating, captivating, and at times scheming protagonists and
antagonists.12 In his typical engaging way, Crichton devotes more
than 500 pages to the debate around humanity’s inﬂuence on global
warming. As predicted, the protagonists and antagonists battle—both
ﬁguratively and literally—throughout the course of the book. Moves
are made, actions are taken . . . countermoves are made, counter-
actions are taken.
Crichton includes a bibliography in his work of ﬁction to show-
case, from our perspective, the need for politicians, scientists, business
leaders, and community leaders to apply clear thinking to the subject
of global warming. His bibliography cites research and writing on
topics such as why failures associated with managing complex systems
typically result from bad habits and lazy procedures rather than a lack
of human capability,13 and how early witch hunts reﬂect how the
consensus of many is not always correct, regardless of how many
people agree or how long the agreement is shared.14 We consider this
an excellent lead-in to our review of game theory.

Most strategy invariably requires change. Research on change
highlights that individuals being asked to contribute to a desired state
or compelling future will typically do so if steps are taken to help them
understand and commit to the purpose and intent of the change.15 By
applying proven methodologies of change leadership, a leader is more
likely to succeed. However, in some cases, the decisions you make and
the actions you take occur in a risk-laden environment. These risks can
include the possibility that those being inﬂuenced and impacted might
resist or potentially take steps to sabotage a proposed change to the
status quo.
Given the likelihood of resistance, a review of game theory is a
useful contribution to our exploration of strategic thinking. Game
theory assumes that, as in the case of Crichton’s protagonists and
antagonists, individuals you interact with may counter your moves.
Rather than assuming a neutral or positive reaction from stakeholders,
game theory expects and anticipates other parties’ potential dis-
agreement, conﬂict, and action that may hinder progress. Such
adversarial or competitive situations require planned action, including
contingencies and countermeasures. An understanding of the general
principles of game theory will raise your likelihood of success when
functioning under these circumstances.
A Brief Word about Game Theory
While the concepts from cognitive psychology and systems thinking
that we have presented will help generate ideas and advance a
particular position, game theory is about handling competition and
resistance. In reviewing game theory, our goal is to introduce several
practical tools toward that end. It is important to note that game
theory frequently involves theoretical and mathematical arguments.
For our purposes, we will focus on several of the more actionable
concepts without going very far into the underlying conceptual
theory. For those interested in the theory, we encourage readers to

refer to other sources for a more thorough review and analysis of the
theoretical and mathematical arguments within the ﬁeld, several of
whichwehaveidentiﬁedinthe Resourcessectionatthe end ofthis text.
While other branches of decision theory assume effective imple-
mentation of decisions and subsequent directives, game theory is based
on the assumption that interests among multiple stakeholder groups
may differ and that others involved typically have alternatives available
to them.
From our perspective, game theory strengthens strategic thinking
because it highlights the context within which decisions are being
made and actions are being taken. A simple example involves the Hua
Shan Plank Trail in China. It is one of the most dangerous hiking
trails in the world; traversing it involves climbing vertical staircases,
walking along a narrow wooden platform bolted onto the side of a
mountain, and stepping into indentions carved into rock . . . all
while perched thousands of feet above the surrounding terrain. Two
hikers approaching each other while traversing the Plank Trail must
anticipate the likelihood of an accident; the more steep, vertical, or
narrow the trail when the two hikers meet, the more likely there will
be an accident. The more dangerous the situation, the more impor-
tant a signal to indicate, “I will be taking this part of the path and
hopefully you will take the other route,” is needed. To negotiate the
approaching challenge, at least one party must signal intent. The
other party must see and properly interpret that signal. Much like a
pilot communicating with air trafﬁc control, both parties must
acknowledge the signal, and then each respective party must act
in accordance to the exchanged signals. Such cooperation is most
likely to occur if both parties are familiar with their environment, are
personally aware of their place within that environment, recognize
approaching hazards and risks, and can respond properly to a signal of
intent. Such cooperation and positive results are less likely to occur if
either party is not paying attention or is preoccupied. A thrill-seeker
may further complicate matters by handling the situation differently

than the other hiker might expect. A savvy hiker functioning in this
type of situation anticipates these possibilities and plans accordingly.
Game theory analyzes the mechanics of such situations, with speciﬁc
attention to the implications of these matters of intent, signal, and
response.
Cooperative and Noncooperative Games
Unlike the typical hiker or climber, we occasionally face situations in
which it is not in our best interest to help another party. These
situations, called “noncooperative” games in game theory, typically
involve two or more players attempting to generate a personal gain in
some area (market share, quality, efﬁciency, proﬁtability, etc.) with
success in that area resulting in a loss to the other players. Players
involved in such a zero-sum game must recognize this fundamental
tenet: other players are opposing players, and what is in one player’s
best interest is likely to be harmful to others. Whereas the example of
the two hikers emphasizes signaling and cooperation, this game
emphasizes concealed intentions and countermoves.
It is important to recognize the complexity of the systems within
which we interact. Rather than facing a situation in which self-
interest or the interests of others are totally aligned or clash, in real life
we often face situations in which the interests of players partially align
and partially clash. This requires clarity regarding your goals and the
other players’ goals. An analysis of your personal interests and those of
the other party will reveal a slate of assumptions and expectations that
may be addressed by one or more combinations of moves and
countermoves. Combined, they have the potential of producing
mutually acceptable results and outcomes. Experience suggests that
individuals operating in such a “mixed-motive” situation should seek
out a combination of solutions that leads to the most optimal result
and outcome possible.16

Sequential versus Simultaneous Moves
In addition to understanding motivations, it is also important that you
determine whether your interaction with colleagues is sequential or
simultaneous. When sequential, one player acts and then a second
player acts in response. When interacting in such a manner, you must
anticipate how your action will inﬂuence and impact the second
player, and how the second player will in turn interpret and then
respond to your initial move. You can and should anticipate multiple
moves in many situations, just as an effective chess player anticipates an
opponent’s next several moves. When acting sequentially, strive to
anticipate the impact of your initial actions and how other parties are
likely to respond. Then use this information to select your best course
of action.
When your interaction is simultaneous, two players act concur-
rently. In this case, each player is unaware of the actions—if any—the
other player is taking. When facing such a situation, it is important to
recognize that you are not acting alone and that:
1. The actions you take will impact other players in some manner,
either positively or negatively, and
2. The actions of others will simultaneously combine or collide with
yours and will contribute to a new state.
In addition to recognizing the nature of the situation, you must also
calculate the implications of each party’s moves within the context of
their intent. While sequential interaction involves linear thinking,
simultaneous interaction involves your thinking in multiple direc-
tions, taking each party’s intent and actions into consideration at the
same time.17
While you are analyzing your personal interests and those of the
opposing party, it is important to keep in mind the slate of external
forces likely to inﬂuence your moves and countermoves. At no time

do you function in complete isolation. The following example serves
as a powerful illustration of this point. It also reinforces the point that
the term players, as used in game theory, may refer to individuals,
teams, organizations, communities, or, as in this case, nature.
Conservationists since the 1960s have recognized the impact of
introducing or reintroducing animals into an ecosystem. Since 1995,
when wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park, the
willow trees standing along streams in the park have grown taller. This
has led many to conclude that the reintroduced wolves have improved
the health of the trees, thus improving the health of the Yellowstone
ecosystem. The rationale: the reintroduction of wolves has led to a
decline in the elk population, which has reduced damage to the willow
trees. In terms of game theory, the prevailing rationale goes something
like this: to strengthen the Yellowstone ecosystem, we will reintroduce
wolves into the park. The result of the reintroduction—in essence,
nature’s reaction to it—will be a decline in the elk population, which in
turn will reduce the amount of damage to the surrounding ecosystem.
This reasoning makes sense. Proponents of the reintroduction
considered taller willow trees along streams in northern Yellowstone
National Park as evidence of success. However, this case reﬂects
decision making based on only one or two variables, with the
assumption that subsequent results and outcomes are caused by the
changes being made to those variables.
Research by ecologists at Colorado State University conﬁrms that
reductions in elk numbers following the reintroduction of wolves are
proportionate to increases in willow height.18 However, additional
research conducted by this group and others reveals that a multitude of
additional factors also inﬂuence the Yellowstone ecosystem. A broader
analysis reveals that geography, climate, and water supply also play a
role. For example, the Colorado State University researchers cite a
2013 study that reveals the impact of beavers on vegetation health.
Beaver dams lower and raise water levels, and in turn water levels
affect vegetation health.19

Strategic Thinking Summarized
We consider these three subjects—cognitive psychology, systems
thinking, and game theory—to be critical ﬁelds that inform strategic
thinking. Application of cognitive psychology will help you manage
your biases and blind spots. Systems thinking will help you broaden
the slate of factors you consider when identifying options and
prioritizing actions. Game theory will help you further recognize
the ramiﬁcations of your actions and help you take steps to mitigate,
reduce, or avoid opposing forces.
The Art of Leadership
The purpose of this section is not to present a comprehensive review
of leadership theory. Rather, our aim is to highlight key ways that
thinking on leadership has changed over time and to present some of
the behaviors and actions we believe effective leaders typically exhibit.
In the context of human history, it wasn’t that long ago that the
deﬁnition of leadership was limited to either a charismatic hero,
someone from a particular social or economic class, or an individual
occupying a particular box on an organizational chart. Those whose
names appeared at the top of the chart served as the leader, while all
others—regardless of how high up or down on the pyramid—were
considered to be employees, associates, or workers.
Thankfully, mainstream thinking has evolved considerably, and
today our deﬁnition of leadership—and leaders—has become much
more democratic. The sixth edition of Leadership: Theory and Practice
deﬁnesleadershipasa“processwherebyanindividualinﬂuencesagroup
of individuals to achieve a common goal.”20 This particular deﬁnition
contains four components that we consider to be central to leadership:
■
Process: Leadership is not a trait or characteristic; rather, it is a
transactional event that occurs between the leader and follower.
22

Page 23
■
Inﬂuence: The leader inﬂuences the follower; without inﬂuence,
leadership does not exist, and leading does not occur.
■
Group: Leadership involves the leader inﬂuencing a group,
organization, or community; others, the group, must be involved
in the transaction in order for leadership to occur.
■
Common goals: Leadership involves the leader directing their
focus and energy toward individuals who are attempting to achieve
a common goal.21
An Abbreviated History of Leadership Theory
Our understanding and expectations of leaders have evolved over
time. Our views have changed through a combination of broad
societal shifts and through the research and writings of key thought
leaders. We consider this journey to be an interesting one, and we
hope you ﬁnd this condensed and abbreviated history of leadership
interesting as well.
Trait Theory
The “hero” leader possesses and exhibits characteristics such as self-
conﬁdence, courage, intelligence, and charisma. These characteristics,
combined with the right circumstance, are the basis upon which some
ﬁnd themselves in the spotlight. Although many of us have the
potential to be a hero, relatively few of us will ever act in ways
and under the right conditions in order to be considered a “hero” by
these standards. Stogdill reﬂected on this prevalent and traditional
thinking, noting several innate traits commonly seen as critical to
leadership:
■
Adaptability
■
Ambitiousness
■
Assertiveness
■
Cooperativeness

■
Dependability
■
Persistence
■
Self-conﬁdence22
According to trait theory, innate traits are inborn—you either have
them or you don’t. Trait theory emphasizes the importance of identi-
fying individuals possessing leadership traits. If an individual possesses
the relevant traits, they are considered a natural-born leader and
capable of thinking and acting like one. If an individual lacks these
traits, they are likely destined to think and act like a follower.
Conditional Models
Fiedler’s contingency model of leadership reveals that your leadership
style must “match” the situation if you are likely to produce the most
favorable results.23 In his model, an individual’s leadership style leans
toward being either task-focused or relationship-focused. Fiedler
developed a tool called the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC), an
assessment that asks the leader to rate the person that they enjoys
working with the least on a series of characteristics such as friendliness
and trust. Leaders rated low on the LPC are considered to be task
oriented, and those rated high are considered to be relationship
oriented. Matching an individual’s leadership style to a situation yields
the most favorable results. For example, if the situation is ambiguous
and the task uncertain, consider calling upon a relationship-oriented
leader. If the situation is clear-cut and followers are being asked to
accomplish a well-deﬁned task, consider a task-oriented leader.
Achieving a proper leadership ﬁt depends on three variables: the
level of trust and conﬁdence followers have in their leader, the extent
to which everyone understands the activity to be undertaken, and the
leader’s ability to recognize and reward the followers. While this
contingency model introduces some understanding of the importance
of achieving the proper “ﬁt” between the leader and the situation, it
24

Page 25
still reﬂects trait theory in the emphasis on an individual being
categorized as either relationship or task oriented.
Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Leadershipsuggests that
leadership behavior is most effective when it matches the situation.24
Instead of replacing the leader to match the situation, Situational
Leadership suggests that the leader can and should adapt. From the
Situational Leadership perspective, your leadership style should not
remain static; rather, it should remain dynamic and adapt to a combi-
nation of situational requirements, follower needs, and intended
outcomes. Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Leadership emphasizes
two factors: the amount of direction and support the leader provides,
and the degree of competency and commitment the follower exhibits.
Hersey and Blanchard suggest that these two follower variables—
competence and commitment—typically result in one of four fol-
lower types:
1. The follower who lacks competency and is unwilling to perform
the task.
2. The follower who lacks competency but is willing to do the task.
3. The follower who is competent to perform the task but lacks self-
conﬁdence (does not believe they can perform the task) and
therefore has self-doubt and lacks commitment.
4. The follower who is self-conﬁdent, is willing, and is capable of
performing the task.25
The authors go on to suggest that the amount of support and direction
the leader gives should adjust and thus reﬂect one of four leadership
styles:
1. Telling: Involves one-way communication from the leader, con-
sisting of direction and guidance.
2. Selling: Involves two-way communication between the leader
and follower; direction and support are given as and when needed.
3. Participating: Involves two-way communication between the
leader and follower. The follower is allowed to make decisions

and act independently to the extent that their competency and
commitment allow; the leader monitors the follower’s perform-
ance and provides needed support.
4. Delegating: Involves two-way communication between the leader
and follower. The follower is allowed to make decisions and act
independently; the follower alerts the leader when challenges that
cannot be addressed surface and/or when they needs direction or
support.26
In deﬁning these four leadership styles, Hershey and Blanchard
introduced an important advancement over the earlier trait-based and
contingency models. It was the leaders’ behavior, not the leader
themselves, that needed to ﬁt the situation. This distinction opened
up the possibility that a leader can indeed adapt to ﬁt the situation rather
than simply being evaluated as a ﬁt based on ﬁxed and predetermined
personal characteristics.
Another important element of Situational Leadership is the
assumption that the situation is not set but, rather, is dynamic and
constantly changes. Thus, the follower who is conﬁdent, capable, and
willing to perform one task may be less conﬁdent, capable, or willing
to face the next challenge. In the work of Hershey and Blanchard, we
continue to see a greater acknowledgment that both the leader and
the follower can and do adapt, reﬂecting further progression beyond
early trait theories toward a rather dynamic understanding of the role
and capability of the leader.
Competency and Activity Models
In the 1980s, the research of several thought leaders brought attention
to the focus and activities of effective leaders. Bennis and Nanus
surveyed 90 leaders and identiﬁed four key abilities of what they
labeled as transformational leaders:
■
Management of Meaning: The leader helps the follower assign
meaning to situations, actions, and events. Like the baseball

umpire who calls the ball traveling across home plate as either a
“strike” or a “ball,” the leader helps the follower interpret a
particular behavior or action as being positive (e.g., being con-
sistent with the organization’s mission) or negative (e.g., running
counter to the organization’s values).
■
Management of Attention: The leader emphasizes and helps the
follower focus on what is important, signiﬁcant, vital, and critical.
One important mechanism that helps guide the follower’s atten-
tion is the vision and mission of the organization.
■
Management of Trust: The leader establishes trust as the founda-
tion of their ability to inﬂuence the follower. Trust involves acting
in a purposeful manner and being consistent in one’s words and
actions.
■
Management of Self: The leader consciously maintains self-aware-
ness, self-monitoring, and self-regulation. Such awareness allows
the leader to lead and support followers in the most effective
manner.27
These four abilities explore powerful ways of leading, focusing less
on the tactical relationships between leaders and followers and more
on the inﬂuence that leaders could have through their chosen areas of
focus and their personal conduct.
Kouzes and Posner introduced ﬁve sets of skills and abilities that
help leaders function at their personal best. Based on a combination of
survey results and individual interviews, their Five Practices of Exem-
plary Leadershipmodel emphasizes that highly effective leaders:
■
Model the Way: They establish standards of excellence pertaining
to how followers should be treated and goals should be achieved.
They set interim goals to encourage small wins, and they modify
the organization’s bureaucracy so that it does not impede progress,
achievement, or success.
■
Inspire a Shared Vision: They serve as a change agent, striving to
make a difference. They work with their followers to establish a
compelling vision for the future. They then do all that they can to
capture the hearts and minds of their followers.

■
Challenge the Process: They seek out opportunities to challenge
and change the status quo. They work with others to identify
ways to strengthen the organization. They themselves are—and
encourage others to be—lifelong learners.
■
Enable Others to Act: They recognize the power of positive
relationships and encourage collaboration and teamwork. They
take steps to include and involve their followers and give them
the opportunity to provide input. They understand the impor-
tance of mutual respect and ensure others receive the respect they
are due.
■
Encourage the Heart: They recognize and reward the commit-
ment and contribution of their followers. They recognize and
celebrate progress and accomplishment, and in doing so they
stimulate action, progress, and achievement.28
Kouzes and Posner’s model emphasizes a practical focus on actions
and has been embraced widely since it was ﬁrst published.
Contextual Leadership
Contextual Leadership—a model developed by one of the authors of
this book (Simerson)—builds on earlier concepts, placing more empha-
sis on the importance of context and personal adaptation. The model
emphasizes that regardless of one’s title, position, or role, everyone must
occasionally inﬂuence others in a way that causes them to perform at a
level they otherwise might not attempt or consider possible. When
functioning in such a manner, we consider an individual to be thinking
and acting as a leader.
The importance of leadership is evident. Experience proves that
unexpected and unanticipated challenges and opportunities surface
almost daily. In these situations, a leader acts to seize the opportunity or
to avoid the threat. To adapt to these situations, an effective leader
takes on a speciﬁc role to suit and address those circumstances.

Research conducted while developing the Contextual Leadership
Model revealed nine leadership roles that enable an individual to
inﬂuence others by addressing the requirements of the situation and
the expectations of stakeholders. Each of these roles is a conﬁguration
of speciﬁc focus areas, actions, and skills that an individual can adopt or
emphasize at a given point in time. From our research and experience,
an individual can take on each of these roles with intentional focus.
Some come more naturally, given an individual’s background, per-
sonality, and personal style. All of them can be learned. The nine
leadership roles are described as follows:
■
The Custodial Leader: Leadership begins and ends with the Custodial
Leader. You must begin with a deep desire to extend your leadership
beyond your time—to make certain your actions contribute to current and
future success. That is the beginning. The end is the sum total of all else
that you do, the results of all your other actions—the reality of what you
have left behind being either better or worse.
■
The Trusted Leader: Having others trust you cannot be accomplished
through words—it must be accomplished through actions. Be honest,
including admitting when you have made mistakes. Keep your promises,
be open about your dreams and your fears, and show consistency in your
actions. Don’t try to motivate others with fear and don’t waste time and
energy looking for someone to blame.
■
The Trusting Leader: A key to others trusting you is to show that you
trust them. Do you make the goals clear and allow others to determine how
to reach them? Do you reinforce good performance? Do you treat mistakes
and failures as an opportunity to learn? Do you share responsibility? Do
you trust others?
■
The Nurturing Leader: People do notmaintain good health by accident and
neither do organizations. As a leader, you need to know how your
organization is doing emotionally, psychologically, and physically. You
will at times have to calm fears or be honest with people about their
limitations. You need to build a sense of family and make certain that people
know that regardless of what happens, you will remain a “united family.”
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership

Page 30
■
The Strategic Leader: This type of leader must maintain a global view of
the world. Externally, you need to understand your industry, your
competition, and the reality of doing business in today’s tumultuous
times. Internally, you must clearly communicate your strategic vision,
perhaps involve others in crafting it, but always with a focus on moving
forward to achieve it. Strategic leadership involves deciding on the desired
position of an organization in the competitive environment as well as the
actions that make that position a reality.
■
The Developmental Leader: These leaders give—they give people a
chance to learn, a chance to contribute, and an opportunity for broader
experiences and use of their talents. The Developmental Leader ﬁnds out
what others have to contribute, solicits input from others, and challenges
others to think in creative and innovative ways. The Developmental
Leader gives people the gift of personal growth and, in turn, receives the
gift of improved performance.
■
The Supportive Leader: To be a Supportive Leader, you must make
certain that people are getting what they need, when they need it, in a way
they can use it. Make certain you have given sufﬁcient time and budget to
effectively implement new ideas. Make certain you are consistently
communicating key messages to all areas of the organization. Make
certain you are doing everything possible to increase everyone’s likelihood
of achieving success.
■
The Inspiring Leader. There are inspirational speakers and there are
inspirational leaders. To inspire people through your leadership, you
don’t need to dazzle them with your words and the rhythms of your
speech—you need to remind them. Remind them why they are part of
the organization. Remind them how others have succeeded in similar
situations where failure appeared imminent. Remind them what every-
one working together can accomplish. That is inspiration through
leadership.
■
The Working Leader: There are times when you must work among your
followers—aligning everyone to the common goal, helping people differ-
entiate between crises and mere inconveniences, working among others to
solve problems. Find out what others are having difﬁculty with and what

they are ﬁnding easy. Measure and communicate progress. Spend time
with the details.29
The nine leadership roles deﬁne the focus and activities required to
address a particular circumstance, and anyone can adopt these roles
through intentional effort and self-awareness. These principles are
central to our view of effective leadership.
Strategic Leadership
We now arrive at the strategic leader. As the central focus of this book,
strategic leadership means integrating strategic thinking and leader-
ship. The rest of this book will establish and detail our observations
regarding how leaders are most effective when seeking insight and
driving strategic change. We will examine the key choices they face,
the options they should consider, and the way in which they conduct
themselves and work with others. We will also highlight where some
leaders go wrong when they fail to integrate both strategic thinking
and leadership effectively. Strategic thinking without leadership risks
becoming an intellectual exercise, as demonstrated by the many
strategic plans that gather dust on the shelves of executive ofﬁces.
Leadership without strategic thinking risks not creating meaningful
value, as is evident when otherwise effective leaders race down the
wrong path or execute a good plan the wrong way. The strategic
leader recognizes these risks and focuses on formulating strategy in a
credible way and executing strategy in a planned and purposeful
manner.
Strategic leaders have a multifaceted focus. They must establish
and communicate a compelling mission (the “what”) and vision (the
“where”), and then work with colleagues and allies to formulate a
path to success (the “how”). These form the basis of what has
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership
31

3GC01

Page 32
become widely recognized as the core components of strategic
management:
■
Strategy Formation: The determination of strategic intent, includ-
ing such aspects as an organization’s mission, vision, and goals.
■
Strategy Execution: The application of actions, controls, incen-
tives, and communication intended to achieve the strategy.30
Each component is critical in its own right, and we should look at
them both in greater detail.
Strategy Formation and Strategy Execution
The available literature on both strategy formation and strategy
execution is extensive. We will touch on some of it in the context
of this book, with a bias toward concepts and tools directly relevant to
the intersection of strategic thinking and leadership. We will not
provide an exhaustive inventory of the tools of strategic management.
For those interested in delving deeper, you will ﬁnd a list of recom-
mended resources, including our own writing on the topic, in the
Resources section at the end of this book.
Effective strategy formation involves solving problems in a way
that adds value, is unique when compared to other options, and is
sustainable over time. The solution to a given problem is often itself
referred to as “the strategy.” Strategy is the topic of much discussion
and debate. Strategies are seen as good or bad, clear or unclear. Some
discussion focuses on what even constitutes a strategy. Well-known
professor of strategic management, Richard Rumelt wrote an entire
book on the subject, arguing that this confusion has resulted in a
deluge of unclear thinking passed off as strategy. Rumelt proposes a
basic structure of good strategy that he labels “the kernel.” A kernel
has three components: (1) a diagnosis of the problem, (2) a guiding
policy that helps set direction in solving the problem, and (3) a set of
32
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC01
03/10/2015
2:8:43
Page 33
cohesive actions that carry out the guiding policy.31 For example, one
could describe the kernel of Apple’s business as (1) helping higher-end
consumers who aren’t technology experts (2) access leading-edge
technology through easy-to-use “all-in-one” products by (3) con-
trolling all hardware, software, and services to deliver a seamless
experience.
Strategy execution involves delivering on the proposed solution.
While it is related to the third component of Rumelt’s kernel,
effective strategy execution raises a broad range of additional issues.
A competitor who decided to mimic Apple’s approach would face a
number of challenges in copying all of their actions. It would need to
acquire its own design talent, establish supply chain sources and
manufacturing relationships, build appropriate retail locations, and
establish a comparable brand reputation. Any one of these tasks would
be a feat in its own right, but in combination it would be a very
challenging task. As evidence of this, while many of Apple’s competi-
tors have produced hardware, software, or services of similar quality,
none have been able to match its business results. In the third quarter
of 2013, while Apple’s iPhone made up only 12.9 percent of all
smartphone devices shipped, it made more proﬁt than all of its
competitors combined.32
This example raises the very real challenges involved in being
effective at both strategy formation and strategy execution. This is
what makes strategic leadership so challenging, and likewise what
makes it so important. Strategic leaders create tremendous value and
impact if they can effectively solve the riddles of strategy formation
and strategy execution.
Strategic Thinking and Leadership in Action
After taking steps to recognize and understand strategic thinking and
leadership, we turn our attention to the activities of the strategic
leader. As previously stated, strategic leadership applies to both strategy

33

formation and strategy execution. We will be analyzing each of these
components separately in Chapter 2, but to get started, we will ﬁrst
ground the conversation with a simpler approach—four stories of
strategic leadership in action.
We have chosen these examples to illustrate the ways we see both
strategic thinking and leadership applied. They feature organizations,
leaders, and situations that are relatively well known, as we have found
that their familiarity makes them easy to grasp and discuss. Each story
builds on that popular understanding, but as is often the case, a closer
look reveals lesser-known or misunderstood aspects of what made
these organizations and leaders successful. It is in these details that we
ﬁnd some of the most interesting examples of the many ways that
strategic leadership shows up in real life.
Disney
To many, Walt Disney serves as the very deﬁnition of a visionary. His
work and the company he founded continue to inﬂuence entertain-
ment, business, and society decades after his death. Unquestionably
strategic, his life and legacy are an excellent example of both the
impact and limitations of visionary leadership.
Disney was born in 1901, a year that marked a new century and
the end of the Victorian era. In the next century, technology would
revolutionize entertainment, both culturally and as an industry. In that
regard, Disney ﬁts one characteristic of the most recognized visiona-
ries: being in the right place at the right time. Capitalizing on that
opportunity, Disney demonstrated a second key characteristic of
visionaries with impact: insight into an opportunity to harness change
and deﬁne a future that had yet to unfold.
Disney’s pioneering achievements in animation are well known
due largely to the lasting impact of his most famous character, Mickey
Mouse. Steamboat Willie, the ﬁrst Mickey-animated short that featured
sound, was a breakout success when it debuted in 1928. It was
34
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC01

Page 35
followed by a string of successful shorts. A decade later, Disney’s ﬁrst
animated feature ﬁlm, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, became the
most ﬁnancially successful motion picture of 1938. That ﬁnancial
success ensured the viability of Walt Disney Productions and marked
the beginning of what is commonly referred to as the Golden Age of
Animation, from 1937 to 1942. That period saw the introduction of
some of the most famous and innovative animated ﬁlms of all time,
including Fantasia, Bambi, and Dumbo. Each praised in its own right, in
total these ﬁlms pushed the boundaries of animation and motion
picture storytelling.
Looking back at their success belies the creative risk and innova-
tion they represented at the time, and overshadows the tenuous nature
of Walt Disney Productions in those early days. Steamboat Willie was
actually the third Mickey Mouse cartoon, after two silent-ﬁlm
versions failed to attract signiﬁcant attention. Snow White was only
partially complete when the studio ran out of money, and Disney had
to screen it for creditors in order to secure loans to see it through to
completion. It was Disney’s passion and personal vision that fueled his
continued experimentation. His emerging vision was informed by
each failure and success. While this drive led to his ultimate triumph, it
also strained relations between Disney and his artists—a tension that
would persist even after ﬁnancial success was beyond question.
Behind these creative victories lies an equally important vision that
proved strategically vital to the lasting success of Disney’s creations.
Walt Disney pioneered a business model based on the ownership of
entertainment properties, forging the earliest marketing synergies that
now dominate mainstream entertainment. Today’s entertainment
merchandising and product tie-ins are so common that it’s difﬁcult
to comprehend that this practice is barely a half-century old. Through
investments in the Disneyland theme park, launched in 1955, Disney
gained ﬁrsthand insights into and early experience with the myriad
business opportunities that lay beyond the distribution of those
early ﬁlms and the characters they made famous. In a 2013 Harvard
Business Review article, Washington University professor Todd Zenger

highlighted a map Disney drew in 1957 that depicted his emerging
vision just two years after his experience with the theme park. In the
map, a dense web of theme park rides, music, TV, and entertainment
opportunities are depicted as ﬂowing from the creative studio that
drove the Disney machine. Zenger notes that Disney’s drawing both
predicted the evolution of the entertainment industry and served as a
road map for him and his successors, guiding them to explore addi-
tional opportunities and create business value for decades to come.33
While Disney’s visionary leadership is evident in both his creative
works and his business success, it also serves to illustrate a critical risk
often associated with visionary leaders. In the years following Disney’s
death, the company and its executives often struggled to navigate the
future without falling victim to its past. Much has been written about
the rise of a question that often guided decisions within the company:
“What would Walt do?” First coined to harness the creative vision that
drove the company, it came to haunt decisions that were at times
criticized as lacking creativity or holding back necessary change.
Indeed, every CEO of the Walt Disney Company since its founder
has had to frame their own agenda and leadership style in relation to
Disney the founder.34 In that context, it’s not difﬁcult to imagine the
challenges that lie in deﬁning strategy for the company in a world that
has changed radically since Disney passed away in 1966. This risk has
become so well recognized that Steve Jobs, Apple’s equally visionary
chief executive, famously advised his successor Tim Cook to never ask
what Jobs would do. “Just do what’s right,” he implored.
Visionary leadership continues to maintain a particular hold on the
public’s imagination. Talk of the need for vision and the power of
visionary leaders pervades both the popular and business press. Fueled
by the rapid progress of technology and its disruptive inﬂuence in both
industry and society, the opportunity to create change and deﬁne
something truly new often seems within reach to today’s entrepre-
neurs, entertainers, executives, and social activists. And yet, for all this
popular attention, considerable mystery remains: where does vision
actually come from? Indeed, in the best-selling book Strategy Safari,
36

Page 37
the authors noted that the majority of writing on entrepreneurship
and visionary leadership has been “in the spirit of the great leader view
of management.”35 This view of the heroic leader is well documented
by the popular press or biographies. It often focuses on the individual’s
personality, it and does much to eulogize that person’s accomplish-
ments but does little to help others understand where the person’s
insight came from or the real actions they took to drive change.
The modern emphasis on a compelling “founder’s story” for startup
companies illustrates this problem, showing preference for a compel-
ling (and oftentimes false) story that conveys a sense of purpose at the
expense of accurate and speciﬁc detail that can help individuals see
how to craft a vision and use it to drive change strategically.
While the tendency is toward mythologizing visionary leaders, we
shouldn’t be altogether dismissive. When we get past the superﬁcial
characterizations of visionaries, it’s still clear that leaders like Disney are
no doubt strategic. As such, he provides an excellent example for us to
consider as we analyze strategic leaders.
General Electric
General Electric (GE) is widely viewed as one of the most well-
managed companies in the world. The nine executives who have
held the titles of CEO or chairman include some of the most well-
regarded business leaders in history, from GE’s ﬁrst president, Charles
Cofﬁn—named the greatest CEO of all time in a Fortune magazine
cover story36 —to Jack Welch, one of the most celebrated CEOs and
leadership pundits alive today. The company’s current CEO, Jeff
Immelt, was handpicked by Welch in 2001 and has been listed as
one of the world’s best CEOs by Barron’s magazine three times.
Beyond the job at the top, GE is also widely recognized for
developing future executives. In a 2006 article, The Economist deemed
GE “America’s CEO Factory,” a label still widely used to describe the
company’s ability to produce strong general managers who have gone
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership
37

Page 38
on to lead businesses within GE and other companies across a diverse
range of industries.37 This reputation is backed up by research, as GE
consistently appears near the top of Aon Hewitt’s semiannual “Top
Companies for Leaders” research study, which assesses organizations’
effectiveness at developing their leaders and evaluates the link between
leadership practices and ﬁnancial results.38
GE is therefore a useful company to examine, serving as a standard-
bearer for modern management and as a training ground for executive
talent.
But, for all of its famed executive talent, the best way to learn
strategy from GE is not by focusing on the iconic individuals who have
led the corporate giant but, rather, by examining GE’s most enduring
management practices, each famous in its own right. For it has been
these business processes—from the prescriptive “blue books” of the
1950s to Jack Welch’s famous Work-Out sessions of the 1980s—that
deﬁne the culture of this storied company.
In 1956, under the watch of CEO Ralph Cordiner, GE pur-
chased land north of New York City that would later become
Crotonville. Since then, Crotonville has arguably become the
most famous corporate university in the world. It became the
mechanism used to disseminate the core practices of the company
and to develop its up-and-coming managers. In those early days,
Crotonville taught a highly prescriptive set of management practices
that typiﬁed the scientiﬁc management of the day. Over the next
decade, they evolved into a formal set of strategic planning processes.
At Crotonville’s height, GE had over 200 staff in its strategic planning
department.
Then, in the 1980s, Jack Welch famously dismantled that depart-
ment, criticizing it as isolated and overly bureaucratic. In its place,
Welch established more agile mechanisms. The Work-Out empha-
sized dialogue among employees close to core work activities, focused
on eliminating work that didn’t add value, and is still widely admired
for the ability to speed up decision making. In a typical Work-Out
session, a problem is identiﬁed as the central topic of the session.
38

Page 39
Necessary research or data gathering is done in advance, and formal
roles are established for a session’s sponsor, facilitator, and participants.
Emphasis is placed on ensuring the session includes both managers and
those who do the work activities in question. Decisions are made
within the session, and participants leave with clear guidance on how
to proceed and implement the established plan.
More recently, Jeff Immelt has started to bring back some of the
emphasis on strategy and long-range planning that distinguished GE’s
past, updated with a new focus on creativity and innovation. Inher-
iting an organization from Welch that emphasized execution and
efﬁciency across the vast array of business units GE had amassed over
decades, Immelt found himself in an era marked by rapid changes in
technology, Internet-fueled disruption, and economic growth that
had largely slowed following the boom of the 1990s.
Given this challenge, Immelt turned his focus to growth. He
reintroduced—and renamed—the GE strategic planning process as
GE’s “Growth Playbook,” and in 2005, he introduced a corresponding
set of ﬁve “Growth Values” against which every GE employee would
be evaluated.39 Immelt increased R&D spending from 3 percent of
revenue in the Welch era to 5 percent of revenue in 2011,40 supporting
a Global Research organization of over 2,800 employees and 1,000
PhDs.41 Crotonville also added courses around innovation and strategic
thinking.
This focus on innovation is an overt component of GE’s branding
and marketing as well, stated as “GE Imagination at Work.” GE
reinforced this message through several high-proﬁle advertising cam-
paigns positioning it as an innovator. These included “ecomagination”
and “healthymagination,” which spotlighted the company’s more
innovative products, its increasing focus on the environment, and its
culture of creativity.
During each of these periods, GE has adopted management prac-
tices that have systemically driven strategy in line with management’s
prevailing view of the status and needs of the organization. This
disciplined approach—be it the prescriptive processes of the 1950s or
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership
39

Page 40
the collaborative approach today—distinguishes GE as a company
focused on a rigorous and disciplined governance model aligned to the
times and the priorities of the company.
3M
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing—better known as 3M—is
widely recognized as a benchmark for innovation among global
companies, a reputation earned by its decades-long track record of
introducing revolutionary products used in everything from house-
hold cleaning to NASA missions.
Founded in 1902 by two investors pursuing opportunities in local
mineral deposits, the company quickly switched to a focus on
manufacturing sandpaper—a shift that Silicon Valley would popular-
ize as “pivoting” nearly a century later. The company faced similar
challenges in this new market, but this time it chose to continue on.
Through a combination of customer feedback, continuous improve-
ment, and product innovation, 3M was proﬁtable by its ﬁfteenth year.
Soon after, in 1921, the company took its ﬁrst steps toward being
a research-driven company when it acquired a patent and hired
its creator, Francis Okie. That patent lead to the introduction of
Wetordry, a unique waterproof sandpaper quickly adopted by the
automotive industry. It also laid the foundation for nearly a century of
product innovation that continues today.
As the company grew, it institutionalized values and codiﬁed
routines that helped it scale and sustain the innovation that deﬁned its
ﬁrst success. Today the company offers over 60,000 commercialized
products and spends over $1.7 billion annually on R&D, an amount
representing 5.6 percent of sales in 2013.42 It has also received
widespread recognition for its achievements, ranking ﬁfth on
PWC’s 2013 list of the World’s Most Innovative companies43 and
repeatedly making Fortune’s annual list of the World’s 50 Most
Admired Companies—it ranked twenty-ﬁrst in 2013.44 In 1995,
40

Page 41
President Bill Clinton awarded 3M the National Medal of Technol-
ogy and Innovation “for its many innovations over decades.”45
Perhaps most famously, 3M’s management targets 30 percent of
annual revenue to come from products introduced within the last ﬁve
years. This metric provides a simple measure for both management
and shareholders to evaluate the company’s execution on its innova-
tion-based business model. While the company hasn’t always achieved
the target—in 2008, that number had dropped to 25 percent—the
number reached 35 percent in 2013, and a goal of 40 percent was set
for 2017.46
However, this metric alone can’t explain 3M’s sustained record of
innovation. Plenty of CEOs set ambitious goals for revenue or
operating performance. By themselves, these goals are no better
than the claims of countless athletes and coaches that “this will be
the year” to bring home the championship. Rather, it takes an
integrated set of management routines and employee actions to
achieve sustained results.
In the case of 3M, a key management principle gives us an
indication of how 3M sustains its innovation-centered strategy:
15 percent time. This is a well-known but undocumented policy
within the company that allows any technical employee to spend up to
15 percent of their week pursuing personal research interests. The
result is a continuous exploration of new ideas and insights. Many of
those insights have led to some of the company’s most successful
products, including Scotch brand tapes and Post-it Notes.
A management practice critical to 3M’s innovation is their treat-
ment of failure. Employees are rarely punished for failed projects.
Rather, the projects are viewed as opportunities for continuous exper-
imentation, and employees are regularly encouraged to focus on lessons
learned and alternative beneﬁts. Again, Post-it Notes offers an inform-
ative example. Started as research focused on creating new adhesives,
the outcome of the project was considered a failure due to its weak
bonding properties. Rather than being discarded, the adhesive was
retained. Years later, another employee picked up the project and
Fundamentals of Strategic Thinking and Leadership
41

3GC01

Page 42
started using the adhesive to temporarily attach paper to other surfaces.
Today, Post-it Notes using that adhesive is one of the company’s most
widelyrecognized products and an excellent exampleof 3M’s culture of
experimentation and learning from failure. In fact, 3M now offers more
than 400 Post-it Note products in over 100 countries.
These two principles—15 percent time and continuous exper-
imentation—offer a view into the system of management practices
that drive 3M’s core strategy of product innovation. The company’s
goals, management practices, and employee activities are aligned
around a singular focus on incubating and commercializing projects
that come not from the most senior executives but from the insights of
thousands of 3M employees. The practices also provide an example of
strategic leadership for others to follow. Numerous companies have
followed 3M’s incubation model. Google’s 20 percent time is a recent
and equally famous example, and several of its core products, such as
Gmail and AdSense, came out of a policy that Google’s founders
designed to allow engineers to pursue pet projects.
Nelson Mandela and South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission
In 1995, South African President Nelson Mandela authorized the
creation of a special body called the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission. Its mission was to address the country’s 40-year history
of racial segregation called “apartheid,” in which minority white
Afrikaners ruled the country’s majority black inhabitants. Over the
ensuing 3 years, the commission played a central role in addressing that
history. It is widely viewed by experts as setting the standard for
addressing restorative justice and is commonly cited as a key element
of South Africa’s successful transition to democratic rule. It also
presents a process that we have come to view as an archetype for a
particular form of strategic leadership.
One of us (Olson) had the privilege of visiting South Africa in
1994 in the weeks following Mandela’s election as the nation’s ﬁrst

black president. During that tour, a series of political brieﬁngs and
personal interactions with each of the country’s historically divided
ethnic and political groups provided palpable insights. It revealed both
the remarkable progress that had been made in the years leading up to
the nation’s ﬁrst democratic elections and the daunting challenges that
lay ahead in achieving closure for the millions of citizens whose lives
had been affected by apartheid.
Mandela’s leadership during this transition has received increasing
global recognition in the decades that followed, culminating in the
global outpouring of respect that followed his death in 2013. His
personal journey served as a remarkable example of the country’s
transitions. Over the course of his life, he emerged as a leading ﬁgure
in the antiapartheid movement, spent 27 years imprisoned by the
government for treason, and then went on to share the 1993 Nobel
Peace Prize. Yet, in the course of his growing stature, the role he
played in establishing and supporting the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission has received relatively less attention. That omission is
remarkable in that the commission was a critical component of
Mandela’s approach to leading the country during his presidency,
and it provides a window into his approach to leadership.
The commission was founded through legislation “to establish the
truth in relation to past events as well as the motives for and
circumstances in which gross violations of human rights have
occurred, and to make the ﬁndings known in order to prevent a
repetition of such acts in future.”47 It addressed these goals through
three committees: an Amnesty Committee, a Reparation and Reha-
bilitation Committee, and a Human Rights Violations Committee.
The committees provided a structured process to hear from any and all
individuals and stakeholders, establish a record of facts and ﬁndings,
and form policies and recommendations. Importantly, the Commis-
sion and its committees focused strongly on establishing the conditions
for healing and a future of peaceful coexistence. This stands in contrast
to historical situations in which a focus on punishment has been seen at
times as perpetuating a cycle of retribution and ongoing social conﬂict.

As one example, the commission created a Register of Reconcili-
ation, designed to allow any citizen to make public comments. The
resulting record provides a fascinating and often emotional look into
the lives of South Africans, many of whom express regret not just for
actions taken but for a lack of action to oppose the apartheid system
during that era.
Nelson Mandela played a visible role during this process, acting as
the primary sponsor of the commission and a voice that articulated its
vision. Speaking at the commissioning service, he said:
All South Africans face the challenge of coming to terms with the past in ways
which will enable us to face the future as a united nation at peace with itself.
To you has been entrusted the particular task of dealing with gross violations
of human rights in a manner that ensures that the painful truth is laid bare and
that justice is done to the victims within the capacity of our society and within
the framework of the constitution and the law. . . .The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission affords all South Africans an opportunity to
participate in reconciliation and nation building. There is a role for
community based organizations and nongovernmental organizations to
play their part. There is a role, too, for individuals to make a contribution.48
It is in this comment that Mandela’s strategic leadership is revealed.
His insight was the important role that participation of all South
Africans would play in the commission’s success. While there were
many ways in which justice could be served both to victims and to
perpetrators, it was only through direct participation that broader goals
of closure, reconciliation, and future peaceful coexistence could be
achieved. By providing a carefully constructed process, Mandela and
the commission created the opportunity to establish trust. By creating
avenues for participation in that process, they created the dialogue and
interactions necessary to build trust.
The power of both process and participation are likewise evident
in examples where trust is not established. In the decades following
South Africa’s transition, several nations have attempted to navigate
44
Leading with Strategic Thinking

Page 45
similar transitions in political rule or coexistence between ethnic
groups. Some have even used truth commissions similar to the format
used in South Africa. Those that have failed to reach their goal often
demonstrate a failure of either process—marked by intervention of
military or governmental entities that modify or invalidate prior
established agreements—or participation—marked by the rejection
of key aspects of the process by parties who do not feel their views
were heard or respected. And, indeed, close examination reveals
pointed objections and dissatisfaction in South Africa’s process.
Our point is not that Mandela and South Africa’s Truth and Recon-
ciliation Commission are beyond criticism but, rather, that it stands as
one of the best examples of both the characteristics and challenges to
the approach to which they aspired, which demonstrates an important
approach to collaboration that we will continue to examine as we look
more closely at the various manifestations of strategic leadership.
Implications
These four examples bring strategic thinking and leadership to life. In
the key actors, you can see the building blocks of strategic thinking—
cognitive psychology, systems thinking, and game theory—and the
basic components of leadership—context, focus, activity, and role
adaptation.
Yet, when the elements of strategic thinking and leadership are
applied in these four situations, the results look very different. The
structured management approach preferred in the early days at GM
could not feel more different than the experimental culture formed
at 3M. The domineering personal style of Walt Disney was nearly
the exact opposite of the collaborative approach chosen by Nelson
Mandela.
If we accept that each of these leaders was both successful and
highly strategic, what should we make of their differences? If their

Page 46
actions vary so widely, what does that tell us about “being strategic?”
Would they be successful if placed in different situations? If not, why?
In these questions, we ﬁnd interesting challenges. They are the
issues our clients, colleagues, and students have wrestled the most with
when encountered. Indeed, they are the questions we’ve wrestled
with ourselves when trying to teach other people to be more strategic.
And it is in that struggle that we have gained insights into the
intersection of strategic thinking and leadership. As we turn to the
exploration of that intersection, we’ll continue to draw on these four
examples to help us ﬁnd our way.
This chapter was designed to provide an overview of issues per-
taining to strategic thinking and leadership, and to introduce strategic
leadership as the intersection of those two concepts. In the next chapter,
we will present the application of strategic leadership through four
strategic leadership types.

The Four Types of
Strategic Leadership
The information we present in Chapter 1 suggests that strategic
leadership involves two key activities: strategy formation and strategy
execution. In the former, you address issues pertaining to needs,
expectations, requirements, choices, trade-offs, positioning, and com-
petitive advantage. We call the output of this activity “strategic insight.”
In the latter, you garner buy-in and commitment, and bolster contri-
bution and advocacy through effective communication, incentives, and
controls. We call the output of this activity “strategic change.”
Fundamental Questions for the Strategic Leader
When considering how one leads, you can frame many of the
fundamental issues using two simple questions:
■
How will you gain strategic insight?
■
How will you drive strategic change?
47

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 48
Critically, the answer to both of these questions comes before the
work of strategy formation and strategy execution begins. This occurs
explicitly, through conscious choice, or implicitly, through the
leader’s actions. We believe strongly that the more effective leader
is conscious of the questions and their implications, and we will use
this chapter to explore each question and the choices that they present.
Strategy Formation: Planned versus Emergent
When deciding how to gain strategic insight that will inform a
resulting strategy, a leader faces two options. In the extremes, the
activity will be “planned,” well deﬁned, and determined through a
preset and well-structured process, or “emergent,” unfolding and
evolving through a dynamic and less structured process guided largely
by ﬁrsthand, day-to-day experience.
These distinct choices anchor a continuum along which real-life
examples can be placed. Drawing from the examples we introduced in
the prior chapter, at one end of the spectrum, GE reﬂects an organi-
zation with a heavy emphasis on process. The blue books from its early
days provide an extreme example of this, but even the more recent
management models that Welch and Immelt employed reﬂect a belief
in the power of routines and processes to drive the company. In
contrast, Disney’s decisions and creative genius were guided by
nothing more than his own views and beliefs. We can therefore
use these two examples to form the extreme ends of our continuum
on how strategy is determined.
Adding in our other two examples, 3M provides another example
of emphasis being placed on emergent strategy. Many of their
products come from a relatively unstructured process of exploration,
albeit one informed by science. The engineers at 3M are free—and
indeed encouraged—to pursue their interests in a way similar to
Disney’s creative trial and error. In the case of Nelson Mandela’s
South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we ﬁnd an
48

Page 49
example of an approach in which process is central to success and is
highly structured. The commission encouraged citizen participation
and saw it as critical to the reconciliation it sought to achieve, but it
was the highly structured process that was critical to establishing and
maintaining trust in its fragile new democracy.
Figure 2.1 places our four examples along the continuum we’ve
created, illustrating the range of choices in regards to where a leader
can focus to deﬁne strategy.
Strategy Execution: Directive versus Participative
When deciding how to execute strategy, the leader faces a similar
choice. In the most general terms, will the leader choose to be
“directive,” operating in a top-down and rather unidirectional man-
ner, or “participative,” involving others in the process in a rather
multidirectional manner?
Again we can use our four examples to bring these options to life.
As shown in Figure 2.2, GE and Disney are paired together at one end
of the spectrum. Disney was unquestionably the decision maker and
catalyst for change within the company in its early days, and the
lingering question, “What would Walt do?” remains today as a
metaphor for his central role in most aspects of how the company

was run. GE perhaps provides a more nuanced example, given Jack
Welch’s emphasis on breaking down bureaucracy and empowering
frontline employees to make decisions, but the earlier days of the
company undoubtedly reﬂected a culture that was most comfortable
with top-down decision making.
At the other end of the spectrum, 3M and the South Africa Truth
and Reconciliation Commission provide two examples where suc-
cessful execution of the strategy was highly dependent on a partici-
pative process. At 3M, the need for continuous innovation required
the company to engage a large number of employees in the search for
new product opportunities. Given that, the very nature of its decen-
tralized approach put many of the execution decisions in the hands of
individual engineers and small teams. Likewise, the South Africa
Commission engaged all stakeholders as it went about its fact-ﬁnding
and decision-making process. While a small group of decision makers
did drive judgments regarding reparations, punishment, and amnesty,
the broader reconciliation process that was the ultimate goal of the
commission could only be achieved when individuals and groups
engaged the process and each other to build trust.
In this second continuum, we have again marked our extremes
and portrayed them through practical examples of how organizations
can operate in very different ways when they execute on their chosen
strategy.
Linking Strategy Formation and Strategy Execution
In addressing strategy formation and strategy execution indepen-
dently, we see our four examples forming different pairs. While
Disney and 3M have gone about the creative process of strategy
formation in a similar fashion, they approach execution in very
different ways. Disney’s creative approach involved artists in constant
dialogue and interaction, with Walt acting as the visionary and judge
of the ﬁnished product. At 3M, engineers operate in an environment
50

3GC02
03/10/2015

Page 51
where they aren’t beholden to a Disney-like arbiter and are thus more
empowered to determine and pursue their creative path.
Likewise, while both GE and Mandela’s commission were similar
in their process-oriented approach to strategy formation, they differed
in how they approached execution. GE (in its early days) was highly
directive in all aspects of the company’s day-to-day work, while
Mandela’s commission was highly participative in how it carried out
its mission.
We can see these differences more easily if we combine our two
continuums, placing strategy formation as the vertical axis and leaving
strategy execution as the horizontal axis, as shown in Figure 2.3.
Presented this way, we ﬁnd that each of the four examples represent
a unique combination of activities:
■
Walt Disney’s visionary leadership reﬂects an approach in which
he was central to both the discovery of his strategy and all aspects
of how the Walt Disney Company pursued that strategy.
■
In 3M, the discovery and execution of the company’s product
strategy involved the participation of hundreds of individuals,
each encouraged to follow their own instincts. 3M management
thus operated as an incubator, monitoring the many team-driven

experiments and then investing in the most promising opportu-
nities that emerged.
■
GE’s CEO set the tone for both the direction and daily operations
of the enterprise, directing hundreds of thousands of employees
across multiple business lines using clearly deﬁned operating models
that were consistently applied through well-deﬁned processes and
measured outcomes.
■
In South Africa, Mandela chartered the South Africa Truth and
Reconciliation Commission as a collaborative exercise, marked
by clearly deﬁned processes designed to engage a diverse and
divided range of stakeholders. In doing so, he established the basis
to form and grow trust that ultimately ensured the nonviolent
transition from apartheid to democratic rule.
In these examples, we now have come to four distinct types of
leadership. Each is strategic in its own right, well tailored to a given
purpose, and combines a unique set of choices and corresponding
behaviors that helps that leader best solve the problem at hand. We
will call these our four types of strategic leadership.
Four Types of Strategic Leadership
Building on the general description presented in Chapter 1, we deﬁne
the strategic leader as the individual who—regardless of role, position,
or title—intentionally takes advantage of opportunities to think
strategically, inﬂuence others toward a chosen course of action,
and garner needed buy-in, commitment, and advocacy.
The four types of strategic leadership combine the range of choices
a leader faces in a simple, uniﬁed framework. As such, it presents four
basic options that can be considered in a given situation, and for each
option, it prescribes a particular set of behaviors, considerations, and
relevant skills. We have found these four types easiest to consider
when presented as a matrix, as shown in Figure 2.4.

While the chart implies the four types are distinct, we have found
that in practice they often blur together. In the case of GE, over time
the evolution of the company’s management style can be seen as
changing from the strict command-and-control style of the 1950s
under the leadership of CEO Ralph Cordiner to the less bureaucratic
style of famed CEO Jack Welch in the 1980s and 1990s. One could
characterize this as a shift away from the directive type toward a more
collaborative approach. Likewise, few would question describing
Mandela as a visionary, and we would agree even as we highlight
collaborative leadership as the best description of how he chose to
address the challenges of healing a nation and encouraging peaceful
coexistence during his presidency.
In drawing these distinctions, we don’t seek to split hairs or make
false distinctions. We do believe that these four types represent unique
and distinct styles of leadership, and we have found it useful to treat
them as such for the sake of clarity and the lessons they can teach, even
as we acknowledge that they often blend together in the complexity
of real-life application. In that spirit, our next step will be to explore
each type in more detail.

About Our Methods
As we begin to elaborate on our framework, we want to share a
bit of background on the work that went into its creation. We
developed our framework over the course of nearly ﬁve years.
What started as informal discussions about the challenges of
deﬁning strategic thinking—a question we always start with in
our graduate class—led us to a discussion of the many ways that
strategic thinking can be applied. We came to the conclusion
that the application of strategic thinking varied in ways similar to
leadership, in that context has a major bearing on how strategic
leaders behave.
A second major inﬂuence was the evolution of strategy as an
academic discipline. As that body of work has evolved, clear
distinctions have formed. In the area of strategy formation, the
distinction between planned and emergent strategy has been an
important insight. Likewise, in the ﬁeld of strategic management,
a distinction between directive and participative execution is now
commonly observed, informed by the study of organizational
change. For those interested, you’ll ﬁnd a list of relevant resources
on these topics in the Resources and References sections.
Withthe conceptualboundaries now set, we engagedin several
exercises to establishourframework.This beganin the classroom,as
we shared initial design concepts and asked our graduate students
for examples of well-known leaders they identiﬁed with each type.
You’ll ﬁnd some of those examples in Chapter 2. Having made
some adjustments in those early days, we then conducted expert
reviews, gathering feedback on the framework from academic
colleagues and leading practitioners in the ﬁelds of strategic man-
agement, change management, and organizational behavior.
After deﬁning our framework, we then proceeded to vali-
date it through interviews and focus groups. In our focus groups,
54

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 55
we asked individual leaders to describe their approach to leading
or the leadership they observed their colleagues practicing,
deﬁned in their own words. We captured these descriptions
through audio recordings and worksheets. Our focus groups
allowed us to understand the approach and mind-set of a large
number of leaders and then compare that data to the considera-
tions emphasized in our framework. We then used one-on-one
interviews to focus on each of the strategic leadership types. In
these interviews, we spoke with individuals who were in some of
the roles that our previous focus groups had identiﬁed as most
commonly associated with that type. In total, we conducted
interviews and focus groups with over 300 leaders from more
than 10 countries as input for this book. You will ﬁnd much of
that work reﬂected not only in this chapter but also in anecdotes
and stories throughout the book.
As a ﬁnal step, we used various well-accepted methods to test
validity. We ran card-sort exercises with several groups of
graduate students and professionals to validate competencies
associated with our model. You will see the output of that
work in Chapter 6. We also tested the framework against real-
world case studies, which you will ﬁnd in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.
The Visionary Type: Driving Strategy through Personal Insight
Visionary leaders are easy to identify. They are charismatic—often
controversial—ﬁgures, and thus they draw attention and easily come
to mind. When we ask students in our class to brainstorm examples for
each of the four types of strategic leadership, the list for the visionary
type is always the longest. The names they identify are well known
and reﬂect a very wide range of professions, roles, and time periods.
Steve Jobs tops the list most frequently, which is not surprising,
given that the development of our framework and this book spans

the apex of his acclaim: helping to launch the personal computer
revolution in the 1970s, by all accounts, and reinventing three
industries—music, phones, and mobile computing—in the last
decade before his untimely death in 2011. Contemporaries such
as Microsoft founder Bill Gates frequently join him on the list, along
with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Starbucks CEO
Howard Schultz. Titans of business such as automobile pioneer
Henry Ford and noted IBM CEO Thomas Watson come up often
as well.
While these business names are mentioned frequently, they by no
means dominate the list. In fact, entertainers show up in greater
numbers. They reﬂect a wider range of examples as well, including
revolutionary artists like Pablo Picasso, world builders like George
Lucas and J. K. Rowling, popular artists that pioneered new forms
like the Beatles and Jay Z, and even subversive satirists like Matt
Groening.
Politicians and scientists are also well represented. Interestingly,
political visionaries are the one area where our students—typically, a
rather international mix—ﬁnally bring more global representation to
our lists. Globally, inﬂuential names like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson
Mandela, and Martin Luther King, Jr., frequently dominate discussion,
but regional examples like Lee Kuan Yew, who served as Singapore’s
ﬁrst prime minister and is widely recognized as its founding father, are
cited frequently as well.
Typical Characteristics of the Visionary Leader
This diversity presents our ﬁrst key point regarding the visionary
leader: they appear across a wide range of situations. They can appear
anywhere, regardless of their role, job title, experience level, social
status, education, or background. Beyond the well-known names we
listed, students frequently cite acquaintances, colleagues, and even
family members they consider to be visionary in one way or another.

Page 57
We ﬁnd this aspect of the discussion about visionary leaders to
be somewhat surprising and quite refreshing. Vision need not be
limited to the select few who have the opportunity to create entire
industries or invent new products, as it is equally at home in helping
redeﬁne how more accessible problems are solved. Students have
volunteered teachers, athletic coaches, and coworkers with stories
every bit as credible as the more famous names raised in the same
discussions.
Beyond this theme of diversity, other characteristics are common.
When we asked our graduate students and focus groups to describe
the strengths of a visionary leader, the two words most commonly
used are “insightful” and “inspirational.” Visionary leaders are des-
cribed as having the ability to see the future and anticipate change.
They inspire through both the compelling vision that they commu-
nicate and their personal passion. People often ﬁnd them exciting to
be around.
When we asked for descriptions of visionary leaders’ shortcom-
ings, the two qualities we hear most often were “impatient” and
“difﬁcult to work with.” These impressions are often based on well-
known stories about the strong personalities of many of the people on
their lists. For all the accolades that Steve Jobs has received, there are
just as many stories about his competitive nature, lack of empathy, and
scathing judgment. For many, visionary leaders are seen as intimidat-
ing as often as they are seen as admirable.
Our interviews also reinforced these perceptions. Commenting on
a leader he worked for and admired, one individual said, “She’s the
reason I’ve stayed with the company for all these years. She’s not only
motivated me, but she was really a role model for what it meant to be
committed to what’s possible.” Another leader lamented the hands-off
style of a visionary leader he worked for, noting that “the quality of the
vision isn’t always determinative of success. His personal charisma and
vision were signiﬁcant, but his vision didn’t always ﬂow through the
company. At times he seemed more like a benefactor than a leader. He
really needed to be more directive.”

Page 58
The Focus of the Visionary Leader
We ﬁnd that the primary focus of visionary leaders is their own
worldview. By this we mean that their main (and sometimes only)
priority is their vision, which serves as the centerpiece and the guiding
principle for all of their energy, perceptions, priorities, and actions.
Often that vision is intertwined or even synonymous with a view of
the world and how it does—or should—operate.
As such, the scope and time horizon of the visionary leader is
expansive. Steve Jobs famously shared that he learned his obsession
with quality from his adoptive father, who taught him that painting
the back of the fence was as important as painting the front. While Jobs
took it as a lesson on the importance of quality, it also illustrates the
lengths to which he went in applying his own views of the world.
Both Steve Jobs and Walt Disney are again useful illustrations of
the unbounded nature of a visionary’s worldview and its implications,
particularly because, for both of them, their company often operated
as the embodiment of their vision, written large. Under Jobs’s leader-
ship, Apple operated as a complete ecosystem of technologies—both
hardware and software—designed to interoperate as a cohesive entity.
Macintosh computers, iPods, iPhones, and iPads shared not just a
nomenclature but also a set of design principles, operating processes,
and user experiences. Even Apple as an organization has been described
as an embodiment of Jobs’s vision. Unlike other companies, teams at
Apple were organized to tackle individual products or problems
with the whole system in mind. Rather than establishing a traditional
business structure, with autonomous performance units each responsi-
ble for one or more product categories, Jobs moved a single team from
product to product to ensure the overarching vision was applied
consistently.
Likewise, the application of Disney’s worldview knew few bound-
aries as the Walt Disney Corporation expanded. Nothing illustrates this
better than Celebration, Florida, the planned community developed by
the company in the mid-1990s and situated adjacent to the Walt Disney
58

World Resort. Like Apple, the town is an entire community designed
and operated through a master plan conceived in the spirit of the Disney
worldview. Each element of the city was considered, including its
architecture, education system, and community organizations. At the
time, Disney CEO Michael Eisner encouraged the planning team to
think of the town as an embodiment of the Disney brand and values. In
doing so, he drew connections to an earlier Disney project—EPCOT,
or Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow—which is
housed at the Disney World Resort and which itself was ﬁrst conceived
as a utopian city of the future by Walt Disney himself.
In spite of the expansive nature of the visionary leaders’ world-
view, they can be equally ﬁckle and narrow in their attention at
any given moment. Disney was famously prone to having a short
attention span, often abruptly losing interest in a given project or
idea. In several instances, Jobs was vocally dismissive of many ideas,
only to introduce them as revolutionary innovations at a later date.
Shortly after the release of the Amazon Kindle in 2007, Jobs told the
New York Times that it would inevitably fail because “people don’t
read anymore.”1 Apple went on to release its own iPad and iBooks
in 2010.
What Visionary Leaders Do
Having established a proﬁle of visionary leaders, both in terms of
their commonly observed characteristics and their typical focus, we
now turn to the mechanics of their approach. What do visionary
leaders do? And what do successful visionary leaders do differently
than unsuccessful ones?
To answer this question, we spoke with visionary leaders and the
people who work with them. We identiﬁed them through their
reputation and their track records, focusing on leaders who had
earned reputations for achieving breakthrough results and disruptive
change but in a wide-ranging variety of professions, industries, and

Page 60
geographies. By talking to real people who inspired and drove
change—often revolutionary change—we were able to assess the
practical and speciﬁc things that visionary leaders do. We took
note of the mechanics of visionary leadership, both internal (including
mind-set, paradigms, mental models, and thought processes) and
external (including methodologies, processes, tools, and techniques).
From this analysis, we identiﬁed ﬁve actions that uniquely distin-
guish successful visionary leaders:
1. They monitor trends, with an eye toward disruption and an orienta-
tion to opportunities to gain leverage and challenge the status quo.
2. They develop insight, forming and reﬁning a worldview that antici-
pates future opportunities to address problems in new ways.
3. They design solutions, proposing ideas strategically aligned to address
a changing environment in ways that differ from prevailing wisdom.
4. They iterate, moving rapidly through stages of evolution and adap-
ting their vision to accommodate new information or environmen-
tal change.
5. They enroll others, using a variety of means and methods to advance
their agenda and enlist others to share their view and lend needed
support.
To make each of these actions clear and to more plainly reveal the
way visionary leaders apply them successfully, we will explain each in
more speciﬁc detail.
Action #1: Monitoring Trends
Effective visionaries distinguish themselves in that they are acutely
aware of the environment—particularly trends and disruption. In
plain terms, the difference between a visionary leader with inﬂuence
and someone daydreaming is the alignment of the leader’s worldview
to circumstance and environmental factors that make their vision
viable.

We once conducted career planning with an individual who was
dissatisﬁed with his work and career direction. We conducted a series of
exercises to assess his skills and interests and then discussed business
trends he could capitalize on to apply himself in ways that he might ﬁnd
more interesting. To encourage him to explore where these possibilities
might lead, we asked him to describe himself in 10 years. He quickly
laid out a scenario that included relocating to the mountains of
Colorado, becoming certiﬁed as an amateur pilot, and spending his
weekend ﬂy-ﬁshing. When we then asked him about what opportu-
nities he could focus on now that would help him jump-start this vision,
his disposition shifted. Even after an awkward minute of silence, he still
couldn’t produce one speciﬁc opportunity in his current situation that
he could focus on in order to start pursuing that dream. While we are
no longer in touch with him, we fear that he is likely still doing the same
type of work he was at the time and is as unhappy today as he was then.
Clearly, realizing one’s vision begins with a ﬁrst step. The visionaries
we spoke with were effective in ﬁnding steps that were grounded in the
current situation even as they imagined dramatic and sometimes revolu-
tionary change. This applies to even the most dramatic of visionary
leaders. In his study of extraordinarily successful individuals such as Bill
Gates, author Malcolm Gladwell famously observed that some of the
most inﬂuential individuals in history beneﬁt from not just individual
intelligence and ability but a combination of factors that include circum-
stance, timing, and even luck.2
This emphasis on time and place give an important clue to those
interested in taking this ﬁrst step. Being connected to sources of
information and the cues to trends and disruption is a consistent theme
among the leaders we analyzed.
Silicon Valley provides a helpful example. Much has been written
of the extraordinary amount of innovation and economic value that
has come out of the Bay Area surrounding San Francisco since the
dawn of the computing revolution in the 1970s. Many of today’s
largest and most valuable companies emerged from this small area,
including early innovators in computer hardware such as Hewlett-
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
61

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 62
Packard and Apple, as well as the revolutionary companies that
enabled the information age, such as Google and Yahoo! Today
Silicon Valley is the Mecca of entrepreneurs the world over and is a
hotbed of innovation that has few, if any, peers. Other cities and
nations have invested heavily to replicate the formula, but few have
succeeded. Why? Many have focused on the raw talent concentrated
in this small location, citing the draw of the best and the brightest to
this single area. Nations focus on strategies to prevent the “brain drain”
crisis that sees their most capable future leaders depart for opportuni-
ties elsewhere. While this may very well be a legitimate concern, their
strategies to provide incentives to those individuals to stay face a
fundamental challenge that is easy to overlook. It is not raw talent
alone that makes Silicon Valley a better breeding ground for innova-
tive visionaries. It is the concentrated activity of innovation itself.
Being situated in the community of entrepreneurial innovation
provides heightened access to the signals of trends and disruptions that
visionary leaders require. These signals are manifest in countless ways,
some overt and some subtle. The ﬂow of this information is acceler-
ated by the very proximity of innovators solving seemingly disparate
problems but all fueled from a common source—the rapid progress of
technology currently changing many of the fundamental building
blocks of society. This concentration of information sharing provides
the fundamental “stew” that allows visionary leaders to encounter
trend signals that are the ﬁrst and prerequisite step distinguishing vision
from daydreams.
Action #2: Developing Insight
While our observations suggest that access to information on relevant
trends is often a prerequisite to visionary leadership, it doesn’t guarantee
success. The visionary leaders we examined typically demonstrate an
ability to combine relevant information in unique and revolutionary
ways. We call this ability “developing insight.”
62

Page 63
Management theorists often refer to strategy formation as a “black
box,” citing the fact that for most of their existence, business schools
and the corresponding academic literature have done little to explore
or explain the relevant mechanics of human cognition.3 Behavioral
studies have revealed actions frequently associated with insight, most
being variations of the information-seeking actions that we high-
lighted in Step 1. Unfortunately, these do little to help the individual
leaders who seek to improve their odds of seeing things that others
with access to the same information do not.
To address this challenge, we will bypass some of these more
academic considerations as well as the complex, if relevant, consider-
ations of cognitive psychology and instead offer an approach that is
perhaps relatively mundane: clearly deﬁning the problem to be solved.
Well-deﬁned problems are a logical and helpful precursor to
designing the best solutions. An abundance of examples illustrates
the self-evident nature of the beneﬁts of this approach. All of the most
successful visionary products, services, social changes, and revolutions
have solved a clear and meaningful problem. Timothy Berners-Lee
solved the problem of making the Internet more accessible to average
people by dramatically simplifying the user experience through
hypertext and the creation of the World Wide Web. Henry Ford
solved the problem of scaling production of the automobile in a cost-
effective manner through the assembly line. Galileo Galilei solved
basic problems in the prevailing scientiﬁc thinking of his day by
proposing that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the universe.
Each of these individuals, now lauded as visionary leaders of their era
and founders of the building blocks of modern society, developed
insight while clearly addressing an important problem. In contrast,
poorly deﬁned problems are often the Achilles’ heel of ill-conceived
or unfocused visionary ideas. Search the Web for “strange patents,”
and you’ll get a sense of what we mean.
Importantly, these problems need not be ones that are commonly
seen at the time. Many of the most revolutionary changes we now
enjoy were not viewed as meaningful when ﬁrst introduced. In 1858,
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
63

3GC02

Page 64
a New York Times columnist complained of the societal injury likely to
be caused by the invention of the telegraph:
Superﬁcial, sudden, unsifted, too fast for the truth, must be all telegraphic
intelligence. Does it not render the popular mind too fast for the truth? Ten
days brings us mail from Europe. What need is there for the scraps of news in
ten minutes? How trivial and paltry is the telegraphic column? It snowed here,
it rained there, one man killed, another hanged. Even the Washington letter
had deteriorated since the innovation, and I can consciously recommend my
own epistles prior to 1844, in preference for those of later years.”4
The following century would reveal the many problems solved
by faster communication that were apparently not obvious to one
journalist at the time. Clearly, not every insight is appreciated for its
potential and eventual impact when ﬁrst introduced.
Action #3: Designing Solutions
We now arrive at the most recognized activity of the visionary leader.
Forming the solution itself—be it a product, service, concept, or
perspective—crystalizes the visionary leader’s integration of all prior
inputs, derived from observation and analysis to form a coherent view
regarding future opportunity.
The solution can emerge in many ways. Many accounts of that
moment resemble the story of how Newton discovered the theory of
universal gravitation—an apple fell from a tree to strike him on the
head, and he was struck by his insight at that same time. While some
visions may take place in such a speciﬁc moment, it is equally common
for the leader’s vision to form over time. The visionary impact of many
famous innovations has only been evident in hindsight. In its own
corporate history, home furnishing innovator IKEA acknowledges
that its signature ﬂat-pack method of selling partially assembled
furniture was not conceived as a bold innovation but was instead
64

a simple observation that several coworkers made after removing the
legs from a table to ﬁt it into a car.5 “Why should we put the legs on
the table in the ﬁrst place?” they asked. That admittedly humble
moment was the critical insight that paved the way for the much
grander and far-reaching vision that would make IKEA a dominant
worldwide retailer today.
Regardless of how the solution is formed, it inevitably reﬂects a
form of creative thinking essential to successful visionary leadership. We
emphasize this as a critical point, particularly in an era when technology
makes the gap between innovators and fast followers ever more narrow.
The visionary leader is by deﬁnition the ﬁrst (or nearly ﬁrst) mover in
any situation. Those quick to copy may, in fact, be more successful than
the visionary leader who initially conceives a solution, but in doing so
they demonstrate proﬁciency in execution, not vision.
Ways to Stimulate Creative Thinking
■Engage in communities, conferences, or reading outside your
typical area of expertise.
■Set aside time in your week that doesn’t involve completing
routine tasks.
■Visit places where you will encounter unfamiliar people, cul-
tures, or ideas.
■Spend time with coworkers in your organization with different
roles.
■Debate commonly held ideas or question assumptions about
your work or business.
■Imagine a situation in which you (or your organization) could
no longer work the same way—what would you do?
This fact does not preclude the opportunity for visionary leaders to
see alternatives that build on or modify existing solutions. Most new
ideas are in one way or another evolutionary rather than revolution-
ary. Combinations are a particularly useful and actionable example of
this. The e-book, ﬁrst widely popularized by the Amazon Kindle, was
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
65

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 66
a vision inspired by logical combinations. What may be less clear is
that while the Kindle was launched in 2007, the combinations ﬁrst
imagined came much earlier. In 1930, Bob Brown wrote of a concept
that married the traditional printed book with the “talkie,” the movies
with sound that had recently debuted in that era. In the third chapter
of his book, The Readies, Brown describes this proposed invention as
he envisioned it:
[A] moving type spectacle, reading at the speed-rate of the present day with the
aid of a machine, a method of enjoying literature in a manner as up to date as
the lively talkies. . . . Present day reading methods are as cumbersome as they
were in the time of Caxton and Jimmy the Ink. Though we have advanced
from Gutenberg’s movable type through the linotype and monotype to photo-
composing we still consult the book in its original archaic form as the only
oracular means we know for carrying the word mystically to the eye. Writing
has been bottled up in books since the start. It is time to pull out the stopper.
To continue reading at today’s speed I must have a machine. A simple
reading machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric
light plug and read hundred thousand word novels in ten minutes if I want to,
and I want to. A machine as handy as a portable phonograph, typewriter or
radio, compact, minute, operated by electricity, the printing done microscopi-
cally by the new photographic process on a transparent tough tissue roll which
carries the entire content of a book and yet is no bigger than a typewriter
ribbon, a roll like a miniature serpentine that can be put in a pill box.6
In his proposal, Brown demonstrates the creative power of
combinations. Imagining the marriage of the traditional printed
text with the emerging possibilities that narrated ﬁlm represented,
he embarks on a creative exercise to deﬁne this brave new world. In
doing so, he lays the groundwork for ideas that would take nearly
80 years to take a form capable of achieving the scale and wide
adoption that he envisioned.
With Brown’s invention, we reach the key transition in our
exploration of visionary leadership—that of the move from formation
toexecution—forBrown’s“Readie”posesseveralimportantchallenges

to ourconceptofthevisionary leader.Does Brown’s ability toimagine a
talking book really make him a visionary leader? Does his concept make
those who follow him with similar ideas any less visionary? What should
we make of Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and the backer of a product
like Brown’s that actually exists and has succeeded in the marketplace?
In the context of our work on strategic leadership, we answer that
the difference between Brown and Bezos cuts to the heart of what
distinguishes the visionary from the visionary leader. While both
Brown and Bezos can fairly be described as visionaries in regard to
their contributions to the evolution of books and reading, only Bezos
can accurately be described as a visionary leader. It is the execution of
new ideas that is the hallmark—indeed the very deﬁnition—of a
leader who drives strategy through vision.
In introducing the relevance of execution to visionary leadership,
we now encounter our last two actions that distinguish the way
effective visionary leaders drive change: iterating and enlisting others.
Action #4: Iterating
Brown’s talking book clearly would not have succeeded as ﬁrst con-
ceived. It created novel methods of accomplishing a common task—
reading—butitalsointroducedtrade-offs,achievingthattaskinwaysthat
weren’t dramatically better than other easily available alternatives. What
made the “Readie” dramatically better than a person reading a book
aloud to others? When the e-book ﬁnally saw success in overtaking the
printed page, it did so by solving other problems that ended up being far
more meaningful to the average reader. E-books enhanced distribution,
allowing the reader to acquire a book in seconds without a time-
consuming tripto the store. E-books allowed inﬁnite selection, offering a
catalog of millions of books available that couldn’t be matched by any
existing retailer. Perhaps most important, e-books offered an equivalent
solution at a lower price. After purchasing the initial device, the customer
found that e-books were often notably less expensive than their print
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
67

3GC02

Page 68
counterparts. This advantage was key to Amazon’s ultimate success, a
fact they well understood, as demonstrated by their aggressive moves to
reduce the Kindle’s price in subsequent years.
Each enhancement was critical to the success of e-books. Each also
reﬂected important iterative change that went beyond—and at times
against—the vision ﬁrst articulated by Brown. It is this ability and
willingness to adapt that is the fourth distinguishing action of effective
visionary leaders.
As illustrated by Brown’s “Readie,” the initial vision is far less
important than the ability to adapt and change. While thousands of
individuals developed similar ideas in the 80 years following his initial
published concept, it was the combination of trial and error and
continuous learning that allowed the Kindle to ﬁnally emerge as a
success. This is a key insight from our investigation of visionary leaders,
and it is a ﬁnding that is highly actionable by leaders who wish to
employ a visionary leadership type.
This ethic has been widely adopted by two core principles that
guide many entrepreneurs and startups: failing fast and the pivot.
Failing fast is the intentional embrace of experimentation and a mind-
set that views failure as an opportunity to learn. Framed as such, it
allows individuals to embrace and try new ideas while also encourag-
ing them to control risk by limiting the investment in an idea until it
has proven to have sufﬁcient merit. The pivot is a related concept,
emphasizing the continuous exploration of alternative applications to
the current path. The concept is similar to the 3M principle of
exploring alternative applications of failed technologies that we out-
lined in Chapter 1. Just as 3M found breakthrough success in Post-it
Notes as an alternative application of an adhesive technology, many
startups ﬁnd their ultimate success in unexpected ways. The Wrigley
Company, one of the world’s most famous chewing gum makers,
began as a manufacturer of soap and baking powder. As William
Wrigley, Jr., sought out ways to expand sales, he came to realize that
the two free packs of chewing gum offered with each sale were more
popular than the products they were intended to promote.7

Action #5: Enrolling Others
The ﬁnal action we ﬁnd that consistently distinguishes visionary
leaders is their ability to motivate other stakeholders to support
and participate in their worldview. From our review of visionary
leaders, this ﬁnal action contributes greatly to the difference between
extraordinary and even average performance. While many aspects of
the other four actions are easy to replicate or copy, enrolling others is
extremely difﬁcult to mimic. The active support and participation of
others in the realization of the founder’s vision can greatly accelerate
that vision, while the lack of such support can make even the best
insights, design, and continuous adaption irrelevant.
Achieving this support can take many forms. It is often referred to
as “developing followership”—the ability to motivate others to share a
vision and contribute through a high degree of personal conviction in
the value of the vision itself. This is commonly seen in organizations or
movements with a social purpose. Many of the names our students
provide when we ask them to identify visionary leaders jump to mind
for this speciﬁc reason—Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi,
and Nelson Mandela all appealed to a moral imperative and rallied
followers around a vision to achieve greater realization of basic human
rights by correcting injustices to oppressed people. While the motiva-
tion of followers in these circumstances is easy to understand, many
organizations and visionary leaders have been able to achieve similar
devotion to decidedly less altruistic causes. Many founders of com-
mercial enterprises have rallied teams by appealing to purpose, be it
creating good, reinventing the status quo, or beating the competition.
Enrolling others need not always be done by gaining their enthu-
siastic support. The visionary leaders we spoke with and analyzed were a
pragmatic bunch, and at times they achieved the necessary support of
stakeholders through decidedly less noble means. By employing coer-
cive inﬂuence, be it through the advantage of their reputation, eco-
nomic leverage, or the fear of being excluded, visionary leaders often
demonstrate the use of an intentional calculus that weighs the relative

value of any one individual’s participation against the various options
and costs of achieving their support. Steve Jobs embodied this calculat-
ing inﬂuence when he appealed to a skeptical John Sculley, then CEO
of Pepsi, to leave his successful organization and help lead Apple, saying,
“Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you
want to come with me and change the world?”
Challenges in enrolling others can also extend to issues with the
general public. Among the many failures that marked the end of the
ﬁrst dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, few were as spectacular as that
of Webvan. Conceived as a just-in-time delivery service for major
U.S. cities, the company dispatched trucks to deliver goods to
customers who made purchases from its website. Buyers selected a
30-minute window for delivery, often the same day. In its rapid
growth, the founders placed orders exceeding $1 billion to establish its
infrastructure of warehouses and delivery trucks, only to declare
bankruptcy in 2001, less than two years after going public. In
2008, Web publisher CNET declared it the greatest dot-com ﬂop
of all time.8 And yet, a decade later, the concept of just-in-time
delivery returned to popularity with the likes of Google, Amazon, and
others delivering nearly identical services.
The Impact of Visionary Leaders
In summarizing our review of the ﬁve actions we have observed in
successful visionary leaders, we return again to the matter of their
primary focus. Visionary leaders are passionate and unrelenting in the
pursuit of a particular view of the world. They form their worldview
through an acute understanding of the environment and emerging
trends, using that understanding to identify existing or emerging
problems, and craft novel solutions to those problems that are
demonstrably better than existing or possible alternatives. Having
formed a coherent vision, they drive strategic change through rapid,
iterative application of their vision, adapting their vision when

Page 71
confronted with new or changing information, and enrolling others to
share and participate in that vision in ways most critical to ensuring its
realization. The difference between successful and unsuccessful vision-
ary leaders is their inﬂuence, as manifest in their ability to both
conceive and execute compelling ideas.
As a ﬁnal illustration of this distinction, we ﬁnd a particular scene
from the ﬁlm The Social Network to be telling. When faced with legal
action by fellow Harvard students who claim to have conceived the
idea behind the social networking website ﬁrst, Facebook founder and
CEO Mark Zuckerberg becomes increasingly frustrated during a
pretrial discovery session. Struggling to withhold his frustration, he
interrupts the lawyer’s line of questions, stating, “You know, you really
don’t need a forensic team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys
were the inventors of Facebook, you’d have invented Facebook.”9
The Directive Type: Driving Strategy through Structure and Process
In some ways, the directive leader is the “classic” leadership type that
many expect when they think of strategy in a business context.
Indeed, many of the concepts, activities, and tools associated with
this type that we will discuss are actively used today and taught
regularly in the world’s best business schools. It is appropriate to
consider many of them to be the predominant and mainstream
thinking about how organizations operate effectively to both deﬁne
and execute strategy. In many ways, this is simply because they work.
They reﬂect decades—sometimes centuries—of reﬁnement as the
basic tools of business, and even as research and cultural shifts have
surfaced new ways of leading that have raised the proﬁle of the other
strategic leadership types we highlight, many of them are, in fact,
deﬁned in relation to the directive type.
As a result, when we poll our graduate students and focus groups,
the list of directive leaders comes quickly and is dominated by well-
known names to those who pay attention to the history of business or
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership

read The Wall Street Journal. They commonly name contemporary
CEOs synonymous with some of today’s largest companies: GE’s Jack
Welch, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Ford’s Alan Mulally,
and IBM’s Lou Gerstner come up often. Many of history’s most
effective military strategists come up almost as often, ranging from
U.S. generals Dwight Eisenhower and George S. Patton to Napoleon
and Genghis Khan. Famous American football coaches like the Dallas
Cowboys’ Tom Landry or the Green Bay Packers’ Vince Lombardi
are occasionally named, seemingly because of the chess-like nature of
playmaking in that sport.
The chess master is an apt metaphor for the work of the directive
leader, as many see them as strategists who stand back and away from
the fray, allowing them the opportunity to see the battle take place on
the board and to weigh options as they make each move. Indeed, the
histories of chess and of strategy are intertwined in many ways. The
earliest variants of the game in sixth-century India served as a tool for
military strategy.10 In modern times, the logical structures and rules of
chess inform the modern understanding of competitive dynamics
through the study of game theory, as we referenced in Chapter 1.
Typical Characteristics of the Directive Leader
Our focus groups and students typically described directive leaders as
“conﬁdent” and “decisive.” They projected a certain sense of control
to others, both through their personalities and because, in most cases,
they occupied roles that did provide them with a high degree of
power. Most often they were the decision makers, with formal
responsibility to set strategy and allocate resources accordingly. It’s
worth noting that these characteristics were seen as strengths by those
we spoke with, as they used them to describe leaders whom they saw
as credible and accomplished. As such, their conﬁdence was well
earned and didn’t tend toward the boasting that might occur among
72
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 73
some leaders. In fact, some colleagues we spoke with went out of their
way to note that the leaders they work with demonstrated this strength
as a “quiet conﬁdence,” due more to the knowledge that comes from
experience or expertise than from personal pride or arrogance.
Likewise, colleagues largely appreciated their decisive nature.
They described them as clear and gifted, with the ability to boil
down complicated situations or choices to the essential components
that had to be weighed when making a decision. When coupled with
the ability to look at situations objectively, these leaders were also seen
as being very fair, even when they made decisions that resulted in clear
winners and losers.
When asked for shortcomings of directive leaders, those we spoke
with frequently said they were “controlling” or “removed.” Some
described their tendency to be controlling as overuse of what was
otherwise considered to be a strength—they often know what needs to
be done, but at times they don’t bring others along. This highlights the
ﬁne line that all leaders have to walk in how they handle themselves
and the particular nuances involved in providing clear direction. As a
case in point, an interviewee told us about a boss she had who came in
to address customer service issues within a department, saying that
“they were viewed as a success outside the team because they did what
they were supposed to do, but the staff was resentful. They felt the
changes were just additional work. After a while, some people did see
how it saved us time in managing complaints, but they never saw
the leader as being very interested in hearing their input.”
Rather, these leaders were seen as removed, in that they risked
being out of touch with the work of the teams or organizations they
led, often because the focus and activities they focused on were largely
separate from that of others. At worst, they suffered from the classic
split in modern strategy work in which those who set the plan are
entirely separate from those involved in executing the plan. While
much has been written about this fatal ﬂaw, those we spoke with still
see it occasionally happen even with the best of directive leaders.

The Focus of the Directive Leader
The best directive leaders we spoke with saw themselves as building a
system. They conceive the team or organization as a machine or
organism, whose parts operate together to manage the dynamic
activity of realizing the ﬁrm’s strategy.
The typical directive leader is systematic in evaluating the core
levers of success in their respective business or endeavor, and they
prioritize the management of those value drivers accordingly. The
way they do this is what distinguishes them as directive leaders: they
take a structural approach in all cases. Whether the core value drivers
of their business are ﬁnancial engineering, human capital, real estate,
supply chain management, technical innovation, intellectual property,
or brand, the directive leader seeks to put structure around it and
manage it in alignment with the broader purpose and objectives of the
organization. Put simply, in building the system, they focus on what is
most likely to drive results.
One might think that directive leaders aren’t attuned to the
human aspects of leadership. In most cases, we found that nothing
could be further from the truth. These leaders consider the team and
talent to be a critical part of that system. In fact, many directive leaders
we heard about and spoke with put as much rigor into the systems to
identify, develop, and manage their talent as they did in their techno-
logy investments or supply chain.
What Directive Leaders Do
Directive leaders are highly intentional in every aspect of how they
perform their role. The best leaders we spoke to were very self-aware
of how they spent their time and attention. They were also aware that
others were equally attentive to the tone they set. The corporate
legend of everyone reading what the CEO reads is indeed true.
Knowing this, many executives we’ve observed are both wary that
74
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:53
Page 75
their words might be taken too literally and keen to use this inﬂuence
to send signals about what they consider important.
From our analysis of existing literature and our discussions with
directive leaders and their colleagues, here are the ﬁve actions that we
found most commonly distinguish successful directive leaders:
1. They set direction, using process to ensure a rigorous evaluation of
the situation, alternatives, and the best available way forward.
2. They establish governance, deﬁning roles, processes, and forums to
manage strategy execution.
3. They motivate others, inspiring teams and aligning incentives to get
the expected contribution of individuals and groups.
4. They monitor performance, using well-deﬁned controls to maintain
an understanding of progress and gain insight on potential risks.
5. They intervene and adjust, overriding standard procedures when
they see a need to prevent issues or repair damage.
Having identiﬁed these key activities, we also see patterns in how
these leaders apply them to suit the situation. To elaborate, we now
look at each of these actions more closely.
Action #1: Setting Direction
The directive leader takes a highly structured approach to determining
strategic direction. Whereas visionary leaders are most comfortable
working on the basis of their vision for guidance, directive leaders
commonly look to data and formal analysis. Leaders prone to taking
this structured approach have beneﬁted greatly from a great many
tools that have formed and evolved over decades.
Strategic analysis took on a formal structure in the twentieth
century, as the Industrial Revolution and social sciences led to the
formal academic study of business, with strategy and strategic man-
agement ﬁrst attracting academic attention in the 1960s. It was
Michael Porter’s work in the 1980s, and most notably his 1980

75

Page 76
book Competitive Strategy, that deﬁned the modern underpinnings
of strategic analysis that are still prominent today.11 Porter’s work
emphasized strategic positioning, in which a given product or service
achieves a relative advantage in the marketplace over alternatives based
on characteristics such as features or price. Concepts of market
position gave new formal criteria by which markets, organizations,
and products could be evaluated.
Today, these tools are used to structure and evaluate a rapidly
expanding array of data. Indeed, big data has become a ﬁeld of study in
itself. The long-sought promise of data that can increasingly inform
decision making has rapidly become a reality, both through access to
real-time data on the daily ﬂow of organizational ﬁnances and new
insights on more difﬁcult-to-assess qualitative issues such as customer
sentiment. The directive leader’s structured approach to decision
making is well suited to capitalize on this trend, and the zealousness
by which the directive leader has done so is evident in the dramatic
levels of investment in management information systems among
companies, large and small alike.
Balancing Planned and Emergent Strategy
For all the opportunity and beneﬁts that big data provides to
inform formal decision making and strategic analysis, we ﬁnd
that many directive leaders are equally concerned about consid-
ering issues of strategy and direction where formalized decision
making and big data is of little use—or can even be a hindrance.
In times of disruptive innovation, many traditional tools for
strategic management have proven inadequate for identifying
emerging market opportunities. While many of the directive
leaders we looked at have demonstrated a preference for ana-
lytical methods like the ones we’ve described here, some have
sought ways to balance this with management tactics more adept
at identifying and capitalizing on emergent opportunity. At
76

Page 77
times these included skunk-works projects led by small teams
that are allowed to operate outside the regular structures the
organization. For the purpose of our analysis, we consider this a
hybrid approach that integrates elements of our visionary and
directive leadership types. We will look at applying these kinds
of combinations in more detail in Chapter 4.
Action #2: Establishing Governance
The directive leader typically combines these decision-making tools
with process, which serves as a key component of their approach
to establishing governance. The hallmark of this direction-setting
aspect is strategic planning, or the formal method by which teams
determine strategy. Typically, the directive leader deﬁnes this
process in advance, often in the context of a broader strategic planning
cycle that is anchored to an annual planning cycle. While the
frequency of this cycle may vary, the presence of a regular cadence
rarely does.
Governance can and does look very different in various settings. In
many organizations, it takes the shape of a formal sequence of
meetings aligned to the ﬁnancial year. A management team may
meet monthly or quarterly, conducting a formal operating review of
key aspects of the business and then using certain meetings through-
out the year to address longer-term topics, such as goal setting or
competitive analysis. Other groups are then convened around this
core cadence, including designed meetings of subgroups to address
customers, products, or business operations. A governing group such
as a board of directors may also exist and operate above the core
cadence to attend to ﬁduciary responsibilities.
The character of the leader’s management style or the organiza-
tion’s culture can also inﬂuence how this governance framework is
deﬁned. Leaders with a preference for operating detail may establish
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
77

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 78
elaborate sequences of meetings and forums to allow them access to
operational status deep within the management team. Other leaders
with a more external focus or with less interest in operating detail may
establish accountabilities that leave such matters to one or more trusted
lieutenants who operate on the leader’s behalf.
Regardless of the chosen format, clearly deﬁned accountability is
critical to success when leaders apply this activity. We ﬁnd the best
directive leaders to be particularly adept at deﬁning responsibilities
and maintaining those distinctions even (or especially) when situations
become contentious or challenging.
Action #3: Motivating Others
The directive leaders we spoke with were keen students of motiva-
tion. While the emphasis of the prior actions may seem to reﬂect a
rather calculating approach to management, these leaders are, in fact,
quite astute in assessing what makes people tick. Their approach to
these issues is the third major action that we saw when analyzing
directive leaders, as they took an intentional approach in both how
to motivate others and how to use incentives to drive desired
behavior.
In practice, this often appears as attending to the complex issue of
how goals, responsibilities, structure, and personal motivations result
in a set of incentives that drive the behavior of the leader’s counter-
parts and team. These leaders watched for both the intended and
unintended consequences of team dynamics, and many put consid-
erable time into understanding the mind-set of key talent through
regular discussions and checking with other colleagues to get an
understanding of how things were going. Notably, this rarely
resulted in attention to pay. While compensation tied to formal
goals is a part of formalizing incentives, effective leaders often
identify ways that such factors as reputation or a sense of purpose
drive behavior.

The idea that effective leaders take intentional actions to motivate
and engage their teams appears prominently in Aon Hewitt’s 2014
study of global trends in employee engagement:
Our work consistently points back to the impact of leaders on employees’
engagement, and to the fact that companies that excel at engagement almost
invariably have strong leaders who implicitly understand and value employee
engagement. They typically have had early experiences that stretched them
and allowed them to grow. These experiences support and shape unique belief
structures about their own sense of purpose, the importance of followers, and a
generally optimistic outlook. These experiences and belief systems ultimately
manifest themselves in behaviors that exhibit the leader’s own sense of purpose
and focus to inspire others, demonstrate personal connection and authenticity,
and help others grow and develop.12
The best directive leaders we spoke with understood this and
paid close attention to it, both through integrating these considera-
tions into their direct interactions with their team and by monitoring
the attitudes of their overall employees through things like regular
employee surveys.
Interestingly, we observed that many of these leaders included a
focus on purpose, as referenced in Aon Hewitt’s research. Mission and
purpose have gotten greater attention in recent years, particularly as
the Millennial Generation now entering the workforce brings with it a
heightened concern for matters of purpose and those having a positive
impact on society or the environment, but in truth these issues are not
new. Over 25 years earlier, leading leadership researchers James
Kouzes and Barry Posner identiﬁed making a difference as one of
the ﬁve core practices they saw driving effective leaders and helping
them motivate others.13
Action #4: Monitoring Performance
Having set in motion a framework to set direction and drive organiza-
tional execution, the directive leader establishes a structured approach
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
79

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 80
to monitoring performance. This typically includes attention to matters
both inside the organization or team and in the broader external
environment.
The balanced scorecard is one of the most popular management
frameworks today for monitoring organizational performance. Popu-
larized by Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton in a 1990 Harvard
Business Review article, it provides a structured approach to identifying
and tracking key drivers of strategy execution across a diverse set of
performance indicators. Kaplan and Norton recommended the use of
four categories—ﬁnancial metrics, customer metrics, internal business
processes, and indicators of organizational learning and performance—
as key indicators of long-term organizational performance.14 In prac-
tice, the structure of such scorecards doesn’t always use these categories,
but by deﬁnition they do always include a combination of ﬁnancial and
nonﬁnancial organizational metrics.
Importantly, the exercise of deﬁning appropriate scorecard metrics
is often as important as the metrics themselves. Scorecards serve as a
simpliﬁed snapshot of the organization’s performance at a given point in
time. Identifying the right metrics is, in effect, an exercise in determin-
ing the key drivers of value for the organization. Indeed, in their later
work, Kaplan and Norton highlighted this in their proposed approach to
strategy maps—a framework used to identify causal relationships critical
to achieving strategic objectives.15 The work of developing a strategy
map reveals judgments regarding how a given strategy is achieved.
We’ve seen leaders effectively use balanced scorecards and strategy
maps to understand the assumptions of their fellow leaders. By applying
these tools, a leader can see how—or if—various aspects of an organi-
zation’s operational performance are viewed as being relevant to
achieving agreed-upon strategic goals. Identifying differences in these
views between members of a leadership team can help surface issues that
often drive organizational or team conﬂict.
We see the most effective directive leaders using these insights to
simultaneously monitor performance in two ways: evaluating strategy
execution through the use of scorecards and other similar tools while
80
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 81
also monitoring the tools themselves for potential gaps or blind spots.
This attention to the system itself is fundamental to addressing major
issues before they occur.
The shift in Microsoft’s position in the technology industry
between 2006 and 2014 provides one example to illustrate the role
of incentives and motivation. In 2006, the company had enjoyed
roughly 20 years of market dominance in the personal computer
industry through the market-leading position of its Windows operat-
ing system. It had used this position of strength to expand its business
into other product categories, such as its Ofﬁce suite, Xbox enter-
tainment console, business server software, and various Internet
services. This included products targeting mobile phone users, where
Microsoft had been an early entrant with its Windows Mobile
platform. Despite its dominant position in the technology industry,
the company struggled to maintain its position as customer preferences
shifted to mobile computing and products from the likes of Google
and Apple that were better suited for use in those environments.
How could a company with Microsoft’s dominant market position
and vast resources let this happen? While extensive analyses and case
studies could—and will—be written to truly understand the events that
transpired, we’d suggest that motivations and incentives played a
substantial role. In many cases, it was Microsoft’s dominance in existing
markets that discouraged them from making the necessary adjustments
to suit changing consumer tastes. Their decision to delay the release of
Microsoft Ofﬁce on these new platforms until well after other com-
petitors had provided competing solutions is one example. Their
reluctance to offer one of their more lucrative products on a competing
platform and at a much lower price was understandable in the context
of their historical business, but it was potentially catastrophic to their
future.
The directive leaders we looked at understood these dilemmas.
They ﬁnd ways to measure performance both in terms of execution
against current state objectives and with an eye toward future trends
that may fundamentally challenge the current state. They consider
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
81

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 82
these factors when driving both the formal and informal incentives
that inﬂuence the motivations of others.
Action #5: Intervening and Adjusting
As we have said, the primary focus of directive leaders is in building a
system that effectively drives strategy formation and strategy execu-
tion. They take a structured approach, selecting tools and processes
that create an environment of healthy team and organizational
performance, and they monitor that system with an eye toward
current and future requirements. However, like any system, at times
that structure can break down. At those times, we see directive leaders
insert themselves and intervene.
In May 2014, Minot Air Force Base conducted an installation-
wide stand-down to raise awareness of the U.S. Air Force’s push to
eliminate sexual assault in the military.16 Such stand-downs are part of
the military culture—they occur when commanders feel the need to
adjust everyone’s focus and performance through brieﬁngs, conver-
sations, or—in the case of Minot—small-group exercises and work-
shops. Air Force stand-downs typically occur following incidents
involving aircraft technology or pilot performance. Standing down
for a few hours or a full day gives ofﬁcers and aircrew the opportunity
to review and discuss the causes of previous incidents, as well as to
review changes in policies or procedures stemming from the incidents.
When a military installation stands down, everything comes to a halt,
serving as a visible reminder of the signiﬁcance of the action being
taken as well as the initiating incident or event.
Such interventions are not limited to the military. As part of its
effort to bolster its brand and stimulate sales, Starbucks closed 7,100
stores across the United States for three hours on a late February day in
2008. The purpose of the closure was to introduce 135,000 managers
and employees to new standards pertaining to how Starbucks drinks are
made. The ultimate goal: helping ensure that managers and employees
82

Page 83
provide the best customer experience possible.17 The decision was part
of an internal effort to address client perceptions regarding product
quality and the Starbucks experience. While there were certainly ways
that the company could have conducted this training that wouldn’t
have required store closures, the decision by newly returned CEO
Howard Schultz to conduct the training in such a dramatic fashion was
also meant to send a clear message to the public that action was being
taken.
From our experience, leaders don’t take the decision to intervene
lightly. They view the standard system of governance as critical to
establishing a healthy organization, and they see decisions to overrule
that system as having signiﬁcant risks. Overriding the system can
encourage others to request similar interventions. It also risks creating
perceptions of inequity if it leads others to believe that the leader favors
certain leaders over others.
Notably, failing to intervene can have a similar effect. As in life,
some people ﬁnd ways to work around the system and achieve results
that aren’t in line with the intent of a given rule or guiding principle.
To avoid this risk, in these cases we have seen effective leaders act in an
intentionally visible way. Making an example of one person for the
sake of sending a clear message can be a difﬁcult choice for a leader to
make, but it can send a very strong message to others on what is and
isn’t considered acceptable.
The Impact of Directive Leaders
At their best, directive leaders are perhaps one of the most compelling
examples of achieving results through others. Directive leaders typi-
cally have little direct responsibility for delivering the end product or
desired strategic objective, but they have a broad impact on how
others do so. In many ways, that makes them similar to the incubating
leader, which we will focus on next. However, whereas a leader who
applies the incubating type of leadership plays a somewhat limited role
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
83

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 84
in the work of others by intervening only where they can make a
difference or add value, the directive leader plays a much more holistic
role in empowering others to achieve results.
We’ll also note that the directive leader doesn’t simply tell people
what to do. This would be a misunderstanding of our use of the word
directive, and we actually debated the use of that term throughout the
development of our framework. We embrace the term because these
leaders certainly provide direction, but it is important to note that
actions we’ve outlined here clearly demonstrate that the directive
leaders spend as much time encouraging as they do telling.
By taking ownership for the overall system that drives and supports
high performance, they take full and ﬁnal responsibility for all aspects
of strategy formation and strategy execution. They do this through a
combination of setting direction, establishing clear responsibilities and
governance, motivating others to achieve common goals, monitoring
performance on an ongoing basis, and intervening when they see the
need to change course or repair damage.
In doing so, their own character and style often have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the organization that they create. In many cases, the
famous directive leaders our students identiﬁed are synonymous with
the organizations they lead. Given this, the best directive leaders we’ve
workedwith take that responsibility very seriously. They seethemselves
as the stewards of the organization, and they understand that their own
ethics and attitudes are critical components of how they lead. While this
certainly isn’t true of all directive leaders, and this type of strategic
leadership can certainly enable less idealistic or virtuous individuals to
wield power in undesirable ways, we see in directive leadership
enormous potential to create results that few others can accomplish.
The Incubating Type: Driving Strategy through Empowering Others
More than the other three leadership types we have deﬁned, the
incubating leader is most commonly linked to particular roles. In
84
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 85
several industries, particular jobs include responsibilities that require
leaders to sponsor, nurture, and develop projects or other leaders.
Entrepreneurs typically look to angel investors and venture capitalists,
not just for funds, but also for the business insights and networking that
are crucial to the early stages of success. In the arts, executive producers
sometimes play this role. Likewise, at universities the best deans and
department heads act not just as decision makers but as mentors and
sounding boards for faculty members navigating both the terrain of
their academic discipline and the challenges of the tenure track.
When we poll our graduate students to name incubating leaders,
many of the names come from these ranks. Well-known artists like
Ron Howard and Dr. Dre are cited, recognized for their expansive
inﬂuence in their respective ﬁelds and their critical role in making the
careers of fellow artists. Warren Buffett is also frequently mentioned,
given that his investment style has demonstrated an uncanny ability
to exploit opportunities that provide healthy returns by using capital
to enable the companies in which he invests to make targeted
strategic moves.
Lesser-knownindividualsarecommonlycitedasincubatingleaders,
too. Robin Williams’s portrayal of an English teacher in Dead Poets
Society is a well-recognized mentor, but most of the professors, coaches,
and trusted conﬁdants on our students’ list aren’t household names.
Even so, the stories that students share demonstrate real impact and are
deeply meaningful in their own right and context. Similarly, one
student spoke of a particularly inﬂuential teacher, stating, “My basket-

While these roles commonly feature—and at times require—
incubating leaders, there is a unique place in our list for those who
hold no particular role or title but who serve a unique purpose within
their respective organization or community. Often they are endowed
with special titles like “honorary” or “emeritus,” or perhaps they are

the valued family patriarch or matriarch. In many ways, their unique
place deﬁes conventional categorization, but it is this very quality that
stands out to us as deﬁning them as a group and enables them to serve
as an embodiment of many of the values and actions that we will
explore here.
In addition to the examples these leaders set, organizations
designed as business incubators or accelerators also inform our insights.
Often sponsored by economic development organizations, govern-
ment entities, academic institutions, or private investors, most
incubators exist to provide a range of services to entrepreneurs and
early stage enterprises to start new businesses, including physical real
estate, access to technology, business support, and management advice.
The ﬁrst business incubator was founded in 1959 by Joseph
Mancuso in Batavia, New York.18 While the idea was slow to catch
on at ﬁrst, the model gained popularity in the 1990s in tandem with
the emerging impact of computer and information technology. Later,
business accelerators emerged with a more narrow focus on helping
existing startups complete the transition process out of incubation and
into the marketplace. Many large organizations have also formed in-
house incubators to encourage innovation and new businesses—either
on a centralized or decentralized basis—as illustrated by our proﬁle of
3M in Chapter 1. A large network of business associations and
academic publications has formed around these models, providing
a rich source of research and insight that we have drawn upon to
inform our analysis.
Typical Characteristics of the Incubating Leader
Our students and interview participants often describe incubating
leaders as “perceptive” and “encouraging.” These leaders see potential
and nurture it. Incubating leaders are very focused on the success of
others, and they play an active role in helping other leaders succeed.

Their keen perception tends to show up as an ability to assess both
situations and talent. They are students of the environment, with a
good sense of trends and opportunities. In this regard, they are similar
to the visionary leader. This keen judgment informs how they allocate
resources. Venture capitalists provide ﬁnancial backing where they see
the right combinations of strategic opportunity and entrepreneurial
talent. For other types of leaders who give out insight rather than
funding, their time is the scarce resource they manage. Speaking to
one colleague of an incubating leader, we were told, “If you got their
time and their advice, they must have seen some real potential.”
In addition to these commonly cited characteristics, we’ve noticed
that a certain amount of experience was often mentioned, more so
than in the other leadership types. Most of the incubating leaders
named in our focus groups and interviews were relatively experienced
in their respective ﬁelds, and they were seen as having insight and
credibility, in part because of their prior accomplishments.
Incubating leaders combine this experience with a high degree of
intellectual curiosity. A 1999 survey of 145 venture capitalists cited
“intellectual stimulation” as one of the main reasons for pursuing a
career in the ﬁeld.19 This combination of experience and curiosity
seems to be central to the unique DNA that makes up the incubating
leader’s mind-set.
Incubating leaders do have their weaknesses. While respected for
their insight and appreciated for their encouragement, they aren’t
always viewed as providing clear direction. This is logical when they
are operating in a role of coach or mentor, but it becomes problematic
when a leader with an incubating style is in a position of formal
authority. “I didn’t always know what they wanted. Sometimes we’d
have long discussions, and afterward I’d realized that we still hadn’t
come to a decision,” said one person who had worked for an
incubating leader. This is an important caution for some leaders to
consider and a good example of the fact that each strategic leadership
type we’ve identiﬁed has an appropriate place and time.

The Focus of the Incubating Leader
The incubating leader deﬁnes personal success on the basis of the
success of others. In this regard, we see an immediate contrast between
the incubating and the visionary leader. Both are focused largely on
the opportunity to capitalize on new ideas and disruptive change, but
whereas the visionary leader makes themselves and their own world-
view the center of the creative process, the incubating leader operates
as more of an outsider looking in. They focus less on developing their
own vision and more on acting as a resource to others. “I’ve always
found them to be a really useful sounding board,” a typical inter-
viewee said.
This doesn’t mean that they act with a lack of self-interest. They
have a clear expectation of a return on their investment, whether that
investment is through their resources or their time. The beneﬁts they
seek are often multifaceted, and incubating leaders are savvy when it
comes to assessing the value of intangible assets like their reputation,
social network, and the currency of trading favors.
This focus on supporting others also doesn’t mean they aren’t
discerning.Whileincubatingleadersareoftendescribedasencouraging,
many interviewees also saw them as tough judges—they don’t offer
help where they don’t see real promise, and they don’t encourage false
hope. In consulting with one organization on the criteria that would
deﬁne high-potential leaders, this item received speciﬁc attention. We
endedupdeﬁning itas“thecourage toterminateunsuccessfulprojects,”
and it became a favorite point of discussion when the executive team
was evaluating the potential of speciﬁc leaders to take on executive
accountability.
Given these considerations, the incubating leader is almost always
juggling a diverse range of priorities and involvements. Whereas
visionary and directive leaders operate as the center of the stage,
with other actors revolving around them, incubating leaders partici-
pate in the strategy of others more like the actors’ coach, actively
observing and inserting themselves when they see problems or

opportunities for improvement. They also differ from the director of a
play, in that they focus more on monitoring than managing the overall
production.
What Incubating Leaders Do
Given the focus of incubating leaders, we found examining their
actions to be a fascinating exercise. These leaders act in decidedly
different ways than the other strategic leadership types. Typically
involved in a diverse range of relationships and activities, they juggle
their time and attention with an unusually large number of counter-
parts. They spend less time with them than some other types of
leaders, and they spend that time in different ways.
Following our conversations with incubating leaders, and after also
talking with those who have worked with them, we have concluded
that the most effective ones consistently demonstrate the following:
1. They build networks, forming relationships both within their area of
specialization and beyond.
2. They assess opportunities, developing insights drawn from patterns
across their network of relationships and their prior experience.
3. They diversify their bets, selecting each investment with an attention
to both potential risk and return.
4. They lend assets, deploying resources and advice where they see the
opportunity to create value and accelerate possibilities.
5. They create support ecosystems, forming mechanisms that enhance
the performance of others and provide indicators of the perform-
ance and return on each individual investment.
Action #1: Building Networks
Incubating leaders take their networks very seriously, as those networks
are fundamental to the value that incubating leaders can create for
themselves and provide to others.
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership

The value of networks has increasingly been the topic of academic
research. The value of social capital is of particular relevance to our focus
on incubating leaders. University of Chicago Professor Ronald Burt’s
inﬂuential research has highlighted the value created by a speciﬁc
activity called “network brokerage” and by individuals whose relation-
ships span what Burt calls “network holes.”20 Distinguishing open
networks (connections between multiple groups made by a relatively
smallnumberofindividuals, with relationships across otherwise separate
social networks) from closed networks (connections made within a
single group, in which many people share the same set of relationships),
Burt’s research proves that value is often created by “network brokers”
making those boundary-spanning connections, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 2.5. While closed networks are particularly effective at creating
value through a focus on execution, open networks are uniquely
capable of creating value through the discovery of new opportunities.
One example of the importance of these boundary-spanning
connections appears in research and strategy groups. Centralized
groups developed to concentrate research or analytical expertise
can generate critical insights on behalf of the wider organization.
The creative insights generated by collaboration within these “closed
network” teams, particularly when they bring together diverse exper-
tise, can be extremely powerful. However, that insight risks being lost
if the centralized group lacks connections to the wider organization in
meaningful ways that allow their insight to be converted into products

that reach customers and solve real-world problems. At 3M, the initial
research in adhesives would not have led to the Post-it Note without
the connections made between the research team and the team
responsible for relevant product lines in the commercial tape division.
These open and closed networks inform our observations on the
various activities of incubating leaders as they build their own networks.
Such leaders are particularly effective at participating in and spanning
multiple networks. They consciously seek out relationships for multiple
purposes and curate their relationships to maintain a diverse set of
connections that help them both discover new opportunities to create
value and then form teams to exploit those opportunities.
Analysis of how they allocate their time indicates that most incu-
bating leaders focus on building open networks. Typical venture
capitalists spend most of their time networking with entrepreneurs,
both to discover new opportunities and to give them a wide set of
comparisons by which to evaluate a given business opportunity. In
contrast, they put a low value on time spent with their peers. Less than a
third of venture capitalists in one study deemed that their network of
fellow venture capitalists was “very important,” versus 56 percent citing
networking with entrepreneurs to be critical.21
Creating Network Value
■Develop relationships with professionals in other specialty areas.
■Join and lurk in online communities to discover adjacent ﬁelds.
■Subscribe to one professional publication or attend one con-
ference per year outside your area of expertise, rotating the
topic annually.
Incubating leaders also cultivate their networks as a resource for
others. They maintain these contacts less for the insights and value
they provide to the leader and more as an asset that they can then draw
upon as needed to aid and assist at a speciﬁc time of need, which can
include forming or supplementing teams or making introductions.
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
91

Page 92
In many cases, this activity becomes self-reinforcing. As incubating
leaders develop a track record and reputation for being well net-
worked, they attract additional connections from others who seek
them out. When this happens, the leaders shift their attention to
evaluating and acting on these solicitations. The most noteworthy
leaders we spoke with didn’t accept every relationship or maintain
every contact, but they were conscious and intentional about how
they handled them. This included deciding how to handle incoming
requests, developing a strategy to prioritize their responses, and
actively tracking their existing contacts so that important relationships
didn’t go too long and risk deteriorating due to neglect.
Action #2: Assessing Opportunities
After establishing a network, the second key action of incubating
leaders is the development of insights. This activity draws heavily on
pattern recognition, a fundamental component of strategic thinking
that we introduced in Chapter 1.
The patterns we see these leaders focus on most frequently are the
assessment of talent and situational opportunity, mentioned previously
as the two primary areas of focus for incubating leaders. In each case,
these patterns inform the creation of mental models. This can either be
done consciously in the form of criteria or checklists, or unconsciously
in the form of instincts. Here we will focus on detailing the conscious
approach, as it provides the most actionable insights, although it is
worth noting that there is merit to the unconscious “instinct-driven”
approach that is often evident in our interviews and acknowledged in
much of the academic literature on decision making. For our pur-
poses, we will call these explicit mental models “archetypes.”
Leaders codify these mental models in a set of attributes that deﬁne
both success and risk. The proﬁle of a successful protégé typically will
include some combination of personality attributes, personal abilities,
and prior experiences. These can be codiﬁed into a formal set of
92
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 93
competencies by which individuals are assessed—a common practice
in larger organizations—or they may form a less formal proﬁle of what
“good” looks like. The more effective leaders constantly revisit this
proﬁle, reﬁning it through an expanding accumulation of experiences
and observations of both success and failure. As referenced earlier, this
is a primary beneﬁt of the leader’s network-curation activities. This is
particularly true in situations where technology or changing social
norms challenge and disrupt what “good” looks like.
The best incubating leaders also take a keen interest in any
encounter that expands or challenges their perspective—either because
it’s fundamentally new or because some aspect of an otherwise typical
encounter has some attribute that doesn’t ﬁt the mold. These anomalies
are seen as promising curiosities, and they provide the opportunity to
unearth additional opportunities. A leader of strategy and customer
relationships for an online fund-raising platform cited certain product
categories as mattering more than others. Given the opportunity to help
an entrepreneur raise funds for a new and emerging wearable technol-
ogy, the leader took a particular interest in the project: “We worked
with them differently than we did with other customers in the past,
because we recognized an opportunity to learn a lot.”
The criteria that incubating leaders develop are then applied to the
assessment of opportunities to invest. Effective incubating leaders
recognize opportunities that others don’t. They are also keenly aware
of the biases that mental models can often produce. Following a career
as one of the most talented basketball players in history, Magic Johnson
has built a lucrative second career as an investor in businesses focused on
underserved urban communities. What began with an equity stake in
movie theaters located in the diverse communities of central Los
Angeles has expanded, as Magic Johnson Enterprises, into a wide range
of businesses, including fast food, health clubs, coffee shops, and
insurance. By directing investment and attention to the opportunities
in underserved communities, Johnson capitalized on the historical
inattention and oversight of other investors regarding the proﬁtable
opportunities that these communities presented.

Page 94
Action #3: Diversifying Bets
According to conventional wisdom and research analysis, a signiﬁcant
number of startups and new ventures fail. While the statistics may
vary—based in part on the varying deﬁnition of failure—the fact
remains that even the most successful incubating leader must assume
some degree of failure and plan accordingly. The diversity of the
incubating leader’s interests is the hedge against this risk.
Leaders we interviewed gave several reasons for consciously
making multiple bets. First, by deﬁnition, the incubating leaders’
role limits their involvement in any one endeavor. As sponsors,
mentors, or backers, these leaders stand apart from the projects and
the leaders they engage with. Overstepping this was seen by many to
violate the basic function of their role, and they were highly conscious
of this boundary. “In the end, it’s their company,” said one leader we
spoke with whose organization advises early stage entrepreneurs. “My
consultants can give advice and an outsider’s perspective, but we can’t
let ourselves get too close at a certain point or we lose our objectivity.”
Furthermore, they recognize the risks that come with any one
opportunity they choose to back. The potential for downside loss, be
it ﬁnancial loss or reputational risk, was another consideration that
encourages leaders to spread out their time and attention.
In the end, participating in a diverse range of endeavors is a
virtuous cycle. The more these leaders participate in a broad range of
activities, the more they are able to see and discriminate insights across
that activity set. This serves to mitigate the incubating leaders’ risk
associated with any one endeavor, while increasing the value they can
add to each protégé, given the insights born from the breadth of their
experience.
Some of the most opportunistic, incubating leaders we examined
intentionally position themselves to maximize the potential beneﬁts of
the endeavors of others across a given category. Rather than throwing
their lot in with one of many attempts, these leaders often recognize
and seize the opportunity to establish positional power that allows
94

3GC02

2:22:54
Page 95
them to insert themselves through participation in an overall category
or platform. Technology often acts as an enabler of these situations.
In 1877, a then-unknown Thomas Edison invented a technology
to record and reproduce sound using tin cylinders. His invention—
the ﬁrst phonograph—was hailed as a miracle technology, gaining
the attention of scientists, the public, and even the president of the
United States. Over the following 20 years, Edison iterated on the
technology over time through several short-lived businesses. As similar
competing technologies expanded the emerging market, Edison
eventually began producing both players and catalogs of molded
cylinder recordings. The catalogs featured multiple music genres
and artists, offering a minuscule range of options by today’s standards
but introducing the ﬁrst opportunity for people to hear musical
performances without attending live events in person. Before the
process of mass production of cylinders was introduced in 1901, artists
would perform for each recording individually. The artist and Edison’s
phonographic company then would split the proceeds. In this
instance, we ﬁnd one of the earliest examples of a business model
that would gain prominence over the ensuing century, for which
Edison provided a platform enabling others to build their own
professional reputation and income. Edison’s technology (and impor-
tantly, his patent for it) allowed him to beneﬁt ﬁnancially from all the
artists who were distributed by his company. As technology improved,
these business models ﬂourished in a variety of industries, expanding
the role and inﬂuence of those in the position to operate as a sponsor
or producer of a wide range of individuals. While some would be
more successful than others, the platform’s owner beneﬁted from the
collective success of many, many small bets.
Action #4: Lending Assets
Having placed their bets, incubating leaders face a choice regarding
how much (or little) they invest themselves and their resources in the
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
95

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 96
success of their chosen endeavors or protégés. The more thoughtful
leaders described this as a careful balance, as they focused ﬁrst on when
to insert themselves and when not to act.
Such decisions are often informed by criteria or guiding principles
that the incubating leader developed over time. Most of these are
learned through experience, often through caution developed by the
negative consequences of prior mistakes.
The decision to invest is also consistently viewed as an investment
and not a gift. Like any investment, the leaders are lending their assets,
not giving them away, and they expect a return. This may be
monetary, or it may take less tangible forms. Many of these leaders
viewed goodwill as a valuable asset. Research supports their insight, as
social capital is proven to accrue to individuals who bridge networks
and create value through those connections.22 Interestingly, others see
this value as well. The people we spoke with valued the investment
that an incubating leader made in them, and they typically presumed
the need to return that value in some form. “Returning the favor”
was one common form this took, and our conversations led us to
speculate that many of these individuals were motivated in part by the
insight that they, too, had an opportunity to build and leverage social
capital by intentionally demonstrating that they take these investments
seriously.
The time horizon can also vary, and these leaders often demon-
strate a willingness to make very long-term bets. Indeed, social capital
has proven to have lasting beneﬁts, albeit of a relatively fragile nature
and most likely to accrue to those most experienced in managing
social capital.23 We would propose that these relatively rare individ-
uals are, in fact, the most successful incubating leaders.
Action #5: Creating Support Ecosystems
Finally, effective leaders we spoke to looked beyond assets as discrete
interventions and instead focused on the environment. Whereas
96
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 97
asset allocation focuses on solving for the individual endeavor or
protégé, an ecosystem view focuses on the total environment. Rather
than, “What would help this team right now?” they ask, “What would
create an environment that accelerated success?” Rather than, “How
do I help the team solve this problem?” they ask, “What would reduce
the chance that the team encounters barriers?” This is the application
of systems thinking to an incubator’s role of creating supportive
ecosystems.
Returning to Edison’s tin cylinders, the evolution of the music
entertainment industry gives us one example of such an ecosystem. As
subsequent technologies more effectively enabled the mass distribu-
tion of recorded entertainment, a collection of new roles emerged to
support artists. As the initial patents related to the ﬁrst recording
machines expired, independent record companies quickly formed to
capitalize on the growing marketplace. Expanding revenue opportu-
nities led to greater investments in each step of the creative process,
paving the way for the collection of producers, talent scouts, agents,
and distributors that we see today. This collection of interdependent
and overlapping entities forms an ever-evolving pipeline that accel-
erates the discovery, development, and commercialization of talent.
While no one individual or organization oversees this ecosystem, a
collective and shared intelligence still has taken shape with the aid of
industry organizations, trade unions, and additional enabling tech-
nologies. From this collection of activities and subgroups, the net-
works form that then create the opportunities for network brokerage,
which we described as the ﬁrst activity of the incubating leader.
Today’s app marketplaces for the major mobile computing plat-
forms provide another and perhaps better illustration of how a single
organization or individual leader can, in fact, play an incubating role
that guides and develops the entire support ecosystem. As Apple,
Google, and Microsoft compete for customers of their respective
smartphone platforms, developers play a crucial role in producing
the high-quality apps that attract these consumers and enhance the
value of the platforms. Simultaneously, as each platform provider has

97

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 98
developed increasingly tight vertical integration of the app distribution
system, they take on more control and responsibility for each com-
ponent of the ecosystem. Whereas the early days of the software
industry mirrored many aspects of the relatively decentralized enter-
tainment industry, these technology platforms have become increas-
ingly closed and centralized. Google controls not only the Android
software platform but also the corresponding hardware standards,
acceptance into the Android app marketplace, and promotion of
individual app developers through its Google Play storefront. As its
role in supporting and controlling the platform becomes more all
encompassing, Google provides an expanding range of support
services to its developer community by way of software development
tools, educational conferences, promotional assistance, and at times
even ﬁnancial backing or incentives. In doing so, it plays the role of an
incubator, supporting thousands of individual app developers and
millions of individual apps. Its success in providing a rich ecosystem of
support enhances the abilities of all developers, and as they each ﬁnd
their relative success within the marketplace, Google beneﬁts through
its 30 percent commission on every individual app transaction.
This involvement in providing holistic assistance and support isn’t
limited to large companies or technology platforms. Many of the
incubating leaders we spoke with demonstrated similar thinking in
regards to their teams. The most effective leaders impact the per-
formance of their teams through how they share information, deﬁne
incentives that encourage or discourage speciﬁc behavior, and even
shape the culture and working environment of the team.
The Impact of Incubating Leaders
Ourresearchandinterview ﬁndings validate that working foror with an
incubating leader can be a unique and empowering experience. More
than other types of leaders, incubating leaders put disproportionate
emphasis on bolstering the success of others. They are keen students of

their environment; they demonstrate a disproportionate ability to see
opportunity and to identify talent. This ability is important, as it informs
where they invest themselves, making calculated bets that in any given
periodallocatetheirtimeandassetsacrossmultipleprioritiesandendeavors.
They also make judgments about the degree to which they
intervene in each endeavor, balancing their attention and their
involvement to provide an appropriate level of guidance or resources
to improve the likelihood of success at a given point in time. The best
incubating leaders do this both with an attention to timely interven-
tion as well as an ability to create an overall, ongoing environment that
promotes successful behavior and minimizes barriers.
In total, this collection of attributes, skills, and actions may seem a
relatively tall order. From our experience, it is. We encountered true
incubating leaders relatively less often in our exploration. Even among
those in roles that included these kinds of responsibilities, those who
fulﬁlled the full spirit that our proﬁle of the incubating leader implied
stood out among their peers. Like a favorite professor or a uniquely
gifted mentor, their rare nature was part of what led others to speak so
highly of them and to commonly express a true appreciation for the
opportunity to work with them and beneﬁt from their unique gifts.
The Collaborative Type: Driving Strategy through Cocreation
Collaboration is a topic that has gained increasing attention. In many
ﬁelds, research has led to a more sophisticated view of the nature of
complex problems and has highlighted the need for integrated solu-
tions. Increasing interdependencies between societies, governments,
enterprise, and individual teams have also risen, as technology has
allowed for new ways of working that no longer face the limitations of
time or physical proximity.
Collaboration began to gain new attention in academic circles in
the 1990s. Researchers focused on both the requirement of collabo-
rative leadership in particular settings and the attributes of successful
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
99

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 100
collaborative endeavors. Signiﬁcant attention among researchers
focused on private-public partnerships, in which collaboration was
seen as an increasing requirement to solve multifaceted problems in
communities and political environments where a purely government-
driven solution would likely prove inadequate.
At the same time, MBA programs made a pronounced shift
toward team-based learning in the classroom as well. Responding
to pressure to prepare their students more effectively to enter a
workforce requiring greater collaborative ways of working, schools
responded through now-common techniques such as team-based case
study assignments.24 While these teaching methods have demon-
strated staying power, their reception hasn’t been universally positive.
Objections from students include the relative deemphasis on individ-
ual performance, the common phenomenon of disproportionate
work effort among team members (now commonly referred to as
“social loaﬁng”), and the potential biases inherent in team-based work
activities that may put those in minority roles or with introverted
personalities at a comparative disadvantage.
For any controversy associated with team-based teaching meth-
ods, there is little doubt that the ability to collaborate with others is a
prerequisite skill for most work and work environments today. That
said, the topic of collaborative leadership has received relatively less
attention than the related topic of teamwork. While it has been
heavily researched in relation to some government-related sectors and
in certain professional ﬁelds, such as primary school education and
administration, historically it hasn’t been as prominent in the broader
ﬁeld of general leadership studies, where more attention has been paid
to traditional theories of management control or to a more recent
focus on visionary, transformation, and charismatic leadership the-
ory.25 One may attribute this to an ongoing and decidedly Western
emphasis on individualism. In spite of the recent emphasis on team-
work in the modern classroom, social conventions and incentives in
Western societies continue to emphasize the role of the individual in
ways that are markedly more pronounced than in many Eastern
100

2:22:54
Page 101
societies. Indeed, our strategic leadership students from Eastern coun-
tries note a decidedly individualistic bias in much of the literature and
theory we teach.
When asked, our students frequently named athletic coaches as
examples of collaborative leaders, including the likes of NBA coach
Phil Jackson and Harry Parker, legendary and long-time coach of
Harvard University’s varsity rowing program. They would also cite
certain politicians known for building consensus and reaching across
party lines, such as Lyndon Johnson. (Sadly, these discussions of
politicians often included an acknowledgment that this kind of
nonpartisan collaboration is increasingly rare.)
In the ﬁeld of business, our students found these individuals
relatively harder to identify. For all the talk of collaboration and team-
work among executives, it’s harder to ﬁnd CEOs who have made their
names in collaborative leadership than those who are well known as
visionaries or even respected dictators. Many of the most well-known
collaborative leaders our students named were known for building
alliances or were noted iconoclasts—Tony Hsieh, the idiosyncratic
CEO of Zappos, often topped the list. Beyond the job at the top,
we did ﬁnd more names. They are relatively less well known to the
general public but often distinguish themselves for their reputation of
driving results and serving as role models within their organizations.
Given these considerations and a handful of role models, we enter
the study of the collaborative leader with a sense of legitimate interest
in understanding and exploring what we might learn from individuals
who demonstrate a more participative approach to strategy formation
and strategy execution. What possibilities do collaborative leaders see
that their counterparts might not?
Typical Characteristics of the Collaborative Leader
Collaborative leaders are particularly adept at ﬁnding opportunity that
can only come from partnerships. They seek out and thrive in teams,

Page 102
which seems to unleash a certain creative energy in themselves and in
those with whom they work. “I always come away with new ideas
after our discussions. They’re one of my favorite people to work
with,” said one colleague of a collaborative leader.
Participants in our classes and focus groups often describe collab-
orative leaders as “engaging” and “trustworthy.” They are perceptive
regarding team dynamics and are attuned to the social structures and
political dynamics of the work environment that others might not see.
They are seen as enhancing a team’s ability to get work done, at times
playing the role of coach, advisor, mediator, devil’s advocate, or
cheerleader. This includes not shying away from difﬁcult or challeng-
ing situations. In our interviews, the most effective collaborative
leaders were described as being able to promote discussion that is
balanced and calming on difﬁcult topics.
They also are seen as being unusually effective at building relation-
ships. People see them as more self-aware than the average leader,
conscious of their own abilities and motivations and rather transparent
when working with others. This gives them a reputation of authen-
ticity and trustworthiness that others view as appealing.
Contrary to popular opinion, collaborative leaders didn’t always
appear to be extraverts. While they may exhibit some of the typical
characteristics of being energized in group settings, they can also
operate as the quiet but thoughtful observer. In fact, many noted that
the tendency of collaborative leaders to be good listeners was actually
in contrast to other leadership types, which tend to project themselves
and their opinions on the group.
When asked to identify the shortcomings of collaborative leaders,
their colleagues stated that at times they could appear indecisive. The
tendency to seek out the opinion of others can at times undermine
perceptions of their own authority or slow down decision making
because they have a strong need to develop consensus. “Sometimes
you just need to be the one to make the decision,” one person
reported saying to their collaboration-prone manager.

The Focus of the Collaborative Leader
The best collaborative leaders focus on what are commonly called
win-win situations. While they are achievement oriented, they don’t
view success through a strictly competitive lens. Faced with a dilemma,
they are prone to seek out a “third way” that can avoid creating winners
and losers in a situation. This is often for the longer-term beneﬁt of the
team or organization, as the collaborative leader pays attention to issues
of organizational culture, seeking out ways to create an inclusive team
environment where stakeholders feel that they have a say in decisions
and ownership of collective outcomes.
In both strategy formation and strategy execution, these collabo-
rative leaders distinguish themselves through a focus on participation.
They are highly conscious of stakeholders and focus on understanding
the roles, priorities, and motivations involved in decision making.
They often monitor the involvement of these stakeholders, attentive
to the individual engagement of their fellow leaders and teammates to
both the endeavor and its intended outcomes.
This doesn’t mean that they treat all opinions or stakeholders as
equal. They maintain focus on intended outcomes by also paying
conscious attention to objective criteria that inform their own point of
view, even as they seek out the advice of others to test and reﬁne their
own thinking. They also pay attention to process, using structured
forums and frameworks to bring both objectivity and fairness to
matters of strategic direction.
What Collaborative Leaders Do
Collaborative leaders spend more time working with a smaller circle of
counterparts than either directive or incubating leaders. They use this
time to get work done, focusing on identifying and working through
the matters that create shared value.

Having analyzed these collaborative leaders, we ﬁnd that the best
ones demonstrate the following:
1. They build relationships, moving beyond transactional work to
establish deeper connections with colleagues.
2. They listen, focusing on establishing a real understanding of others
that avoids interpreting data through their own lens or priorities.
3. They ﬁnd common interests, seeking out areas of mutual beneﬁt
that can create value beyond what individuals can achieve
independently.
4. They share power, often giving away their own power or control
while still maintaining clear lines of accountability.
5. They demonstrate trust, seeking ways to extend trust before they ask
it of others.
Action #1: Building Relationships
Collaborative leaders start with relationships, often leading with
personal connections over business ones, as they are aware of the
power that these connections have to accelerate work in collaborative
settings.
PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has made headlines for the simple act
of getting to know her key leaders in meaningful ways that go beyond
standard work-related discussions. She’s known for setting aside time
for agenda-free “ﬁreside chats,” reaching out to the spouses of top
executives and sharing insights from her own experience raising her
two daughters in internal memos to PepsiCo employees. She is a
strong, vocal advocate for these practices and for developing relation-
ships with coworkers, citing the need to engage both the heart and the
mind to get the most out of people.
An Aon Hewitt study backs this up, as their research reveals that
three of the ﬁve most critical drivers of creating highly engaged leaders
and employees relate to establishing shared purpose, demonstrating
character and integrity, and interacting regularly with others. These
104

3GC02

Page 105
higher levels of engagement are proven to be good for business; Aon
Hewitt’s list of Best Employers who achieve top quartile engagement
levels are also proven to have better results.26
All this should come as no surprise to those who have done
business internationally. Building relationships is a hallmark of doing
business in many cultures. Western business executives used to
“getting down to business” are often befuddled or even oblivious
to these cultural norms, and hamper their ability to achieve their goals
by not attending to both the cultural etiquette and legitimate value
associated with putting relationships before work.
Developing relationships doesn’t mean that leaders have to share
everything about their personal lives at work. Rather, the collabora-
tive leaders we spoke with simply made conscious and intentional
efforts to know their colleagues. Their actions are often as simple as
taking the time out to thank colleagues for good work, being aware of
and acknowledging life events or key milestones outside the ofﬁce,
scheduling time that didn’t directly involve work tasks, or even just
taking time on Monday mornings to talk about the weekend before
diving in to the ﬁrst agenda item of the day. While these items may
sound obvious or perhaps trite to some, they came up regularly as the
small but meaningful examples that our interview participants said
they appreciated when they noted the relationships they had with
collaborative leaders.
Action #2: Listening
Listening is a second key action that our collaborative leaders dem-
onstrated. This listening had two distinct purposes: it was another way
for the leader to establish and build relationships, and it provided them
with more insight into the priorities and mind-set of their fellow
leaders.
Research demonstrates that the act of listening has proven to have
positive effects. Researchers at MIT’s Human Dynamics Lab conducted
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
105

Page 106
studies of teams in various work environments using special electronic
badges that tracked various aspects of ofﬁce collaboration. Their
ﬁndings unearthed what they called “natural leaders,” revealed by
patterns in the data that distinguished individuals who drove team
energy and connections in productive ways. Among many character-
istics of these informal leaders, they were prone to listen as much as
or more often than they spoke and to listen with above average
intensity.27
The power of listening has been a well-known secret to consul-
tants for years. John Bausch, a fellow faculty member in our graduate
program, relays a favorite story in his course on establishing transfor-
mational client relationships. Working on a large project that involved
multiple deliverables and consulting organizations, he had an oppor-
tunity to observe the lead partner of another ﬁrm interacting with the
client. For nearly the entire conversation, the partner was able to drive
the conversation by repeating a single question: “And then what
happens?” Through this simple question, the partner was able to
effectively stay out of the way as the client walked through their own
reﬂections on the key milestones and issues related to the project. The
partner walked away with both the relevant insights needed to assist
the client as well as a clear demonstration to the client that they were
listening and interested in understanding the situation.
Active listening is one technique used to conﬁrm the mutual
understanding between two parties. Commonly used in counseling,
education, medical, and management contexts, it involves the listener
restating or paraphrasing a speaker’s key points. Such restating pro-
vides the dual beneﬁt of demonstrating the listener’s attention to the
speaker while allowing the listener to conﬁrm they accurately inter-
preted the speaker’s intended message. The more effective leaders we
spoke with combine this with intentional demonstration of empathy
to the speaker.
This simple but critical action—listening—stands in stark contrast
to the other leadership types we analyzed. Visionary leaders were, in
fact, cited by many as being exceptionally weak listeners, prone to
106
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 107
interpreting data in the context of the worldview and vision that
dominates their attention. Some leaders were noted for listening, but
for different purposes, as the directive leader listens to monitor and
track while the incubating leader listens to discover opportunities to
advise or invest. With these comparisons in mind, our collaborative
leaders were most often credited with authentic listening, given their
propensity to enter into discussions with the least amount of ulterior
motives and having the most to gain in achieving a deeper under-
standing of what their colleagues had to say.
Action #3: Finding Common Interests
It is in our third action—ﬁnding common interests—where we see
collaborative leaders most clearly approaching strategy in a unique
way compared to other leaders. For it is in the exploration of mutual
interest where the collaborative leader is best positioned to ﬁnd areas
of opportunity that traditional approaches to strategy overlook.
In stock car auto racing, gaining a competitive edge demands a
combination of driver skill, vehicle performance, and aerodynamics.
The most elite drivers can reach speeds well in excess of 200 miles per
hour, and the margin of victory of the closest races has been recorded in
as little as one one-thousandth of a second. While the intense,
competitive nature of elite drivers wouldn’t be surprising to anyone,
it may be more surprising to know that cooperation plays a key role in
the success of top drivers even as they compete against each other in
major races. In many cases, these drivers coordinate to gain small
efﬁciencies achieved by minimizing aerodynamic drag when cars align
in a tight formation. These techniques serve to increase speed and
reduce fuel consumption, giving the drivers who participate a small
edge. Decorated NASCAR champion Darrell Waltrip deemed this and
other mutually beneﬁcial techniques “coopetition,” and he has extoled
the virtues of working with competitors for competitive advantage as
well as for the betterment of the overall racing community.

Collaborative leaders are attuned to these types of unique oppor-
tunities. They appear in a variety of ways, from industry consortiums
that pursue advocacy agendas representing common concerns, to
patent consortiums that share intellectual property. These practices
are often commonly seen in new or growing industries, where the
sheer magnitude of the marketplace opportunity creates greater
incentives for early entrants to focus on growing the market than
on devoting resources to beating their competition.
Collaborative practices and mutual interests can be seen in mature
industries as well. In 2005, automakers Toyota and PSA Peugeot
Citroën launched three similar cars targeting urban youth in Europe.
What made the three cars unique was that they were the product of a
joint venture between the two competitors, which split development
to reduce costs on shared components while competing on separate
aspects that included exterior styling, interior options, and vehicle
marketing. In this case, collaboration allowed each automaker to
pursue mutual interests to reduce costs of business activities that didn’t
create value, while still leaving each to operate independently in areas
where they were able to leverage unique organizational capabilities
and pursue market differentiation.
Collaborative leaders often play an important role within organi-
zations and teams to establish mutual interests as well. Too often, even
in the same organization that supposedly serves to form the basis of
teamwork, competing priorities or self-interest can create challenges.
Collaborative leaders often serve to bring teams together in these
circumstances, appealing to superordinate goals that highlight the
necessary contribution of individual teams and the completion of
related goals to achieve a broader purpose or expected outcome.
In a 1985 article published in MIT Sloan Management Review,
David Maister coined the term “one-ﬁrm ﬁrm” to name a system of
management practices he identiﬁed that distinguished highly effective
professional service ﬁrms. Most of these practices were developed
speciﬁcally to engender collaboration and minimize internal compe-
tition. These practices centered largely on policies related to hiring,
108
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 109
incentives, and organizational culture. They promoted values such as
loyalty, teamwork, and a focus on client service. A key ﬁnding among
the ﬁve ﬁrms analyzed was a preference for performance evaluation
and compensation systems that avoided separate proﬁt centers within
the organization. By emphasizing overall organizational performance,
they avoided creating incentives for internal competition and instead
sent a strong message that the success of the individual was inter-
dependent with the success of the whole.28 In combination, these
practices can all be seen as creating an environment that promotes and
emphasizes common interests.
As one example of ﬁnding common interests, we had the oppor-
tunity to interview a leader named Henry about his experiences when
he assumed responsibility for one of his ﬁrm’s local markets. Upon
entering his new position, he found his then recently merged organi-
zation sending mixed signals to individuals. Although needing to
function as a “one-ﬁrm ﬁrm,” executives and consultants were
managed and rewarded in a way that encouraged siloed thinking.
When working together, there was an express need to be candid and
straightforward. Employees at all levels would agree to take needed
actions to support their colleagues, but at times they would then fall
short in doing so. While motivations weren’t always clear, these
shortfalls appeared to be intentional at times. Henry points out that
“recognizing the importance of my team members working together
as a cohesive team, I decided to establish a set of ground rules to guide
how the members of the ‘new’ organization would think and behave
differently. Importantly, these principles were accompanied by spe-
ciﬁc behavior that would no longer be considered acceptable.”29
Henry worked with his team to identify behaviors crucial to the
team’s success. To encourage candid communication and give team
members permission to hold each other accountable, each member
was given “nagging rights.” He then worked with his team so they
became more comfortable with conﬂict. Rather than considering
conﬂict and disagreement as issues to be avoided, they recognized that
properly managed disagreement and conﬂict typically led to more

109

2:22:54
Page 110
powerful conclusions and decisions. This emphasis on guiding prin-
ciples, appropriate behavior, and comfort with conﬂict paid off. When
working with clients, each team member began to seek out opportu-
nities to introduce clients to other members of the team. This created
the opportunity to expand assistance and support to the client through
the ﬁrm’s increased slate of service offerings.
Action #4: Sharing Power
Collaborative leaders view power and control differently than other
leaders. While they demonstrate ambition and drive in similar ways to
all high-performing individuals, they also see ways to give power to
others that further their own goals.
We once advised an executive in a large multinational ﬁnancial
services ﬁrm on the introduction of a new initiative. She had done an
excellent job developing the strategy, having been given the time and
support to assess the situation, speak with stakeholders, understand prior
successes and challenges, get input and suggestions from key leaders, and
testa varietyofideasandoptionsbeforeproposingaﬁnalsolution.There
was broad enthusiasm to move forward on the new program. However,
as she began to introduce it, she started to experience resistance. Some of
her coworkers asked questions about what was happening and why she
was meeting with other leaders about the project. This change in tone
and support was frustrating and confusing. Why did the broad support
and enthusiasm she had been hearing change so quickly?
The answer lies in how she was implementing the strategy. While
she had been highly collaborative in her approach to forming the
strategy, when the time came to move forward, she started to do much
more ofthe work on her own. She hadtaken logicalactionsto set up the
program for success, creating a project plan, testing dates and milestones
against other activities across the organization, and reviewing the
support with the program’s sponsors, including the CEO. What she
hadn’t done was involve her counterparts in the implementation in the
110
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 111
same way she had done while forming the initial strategy. She took
much of the work on herself, drafting communications, scheduling
meetings, and developing the program’s tools and required resources.
When we asked her why she’d taken on all these things herself, she said
she wanted to make sure everything went well. “This is a big initiative
for me and something really new for the company. I just want to make
sure everything is done right,” she explained. Furthermore, she knew
that a lot of her counterparts were very busy, and she was hesitant to ask
them for help, fearing that it would either inconvenience them or slow
down the project.
After several conversations, she changed course. She brought
together a team that could help manage the implementation and
shared the time line. She asked for input on how to handle each phase.
Who should be responsible for key tasks? Who should each commu-
nication come from? Were the milestones realistic? Through the
course of this discussion, individuals divided up the work and took on
accountability for inﬂuencing others across the organization on some
of the more tricky aspects of the project. The leader of the program
remained somewhat skeptical but was pleased to have the help and
started to realize that her own time was, in fact, a bottleneck driving
some of the project plan. As time passed, the broader team she’d
assembled spread outto dotheirwork.They mademost ofthe deadlines
without issues. When a few issues did creep up, she reconvened the
group and they discussed these questions: Should we delay a milestone
to allow for a few things to be tied up or proceed? Did the plan we set in
the conversation still make sense? These conversations were very rich,
bringing in additional information and insights that she wouldn’t have
had. The project launched on time and with a broad range of leaders
involved and invested in its success.
In our experience, sharing power can have counterintuitive
results. It takes more time up front and can add layers and complexity
to some activities that otherwise would have been easier. That said,
the cumulative effect can dramatically enhance results. Teams and
organizations with experience sharing power can achieve things that
The Four Types of Strategic Leadership
111

3GC02

Page 112
others working alone simply can’t. Unsurprisingly, collaboration
leads the list of organizational priorities for many CEOs today. Sharing
power is a critical—and often underappreciated—component of mak-
ing collaboration work.
Action #5: Demonstrating Trust
Trust is another fundamental aspect of collaborative leadership, and it
is a critical element of the other four actions. Relationships, listening,
common interests, and sharing power all contribute to—and depend
on—mutual trust. Effective collaborative leaders we spoke with under-
stood this, and many of them talked speciﬁcally about it. The employee
of a pottery company we spoke with was clear about the impact of this
trust, describing her experience working with the company’s CEO:
“She was candid, sincerely and personally involved, and very trusting of
her team. She really developed a bond with her team, and her approach
led to numerous examples of life-changing experiences that came from
her style.”
Research studies on trust have ﬂourished in the ﬁeld of leadership.
A comparative review of qualitative and quantitative research on
leadership cited trust and integrity as one of the two most prominent
themes in the qualitative research analyzed (the other theme being
good communication), with trust also appearing prominently in the
quantitative studies reviewed.30 Furthermore, the topic of trust has
taken on newfound energy among leaders and researchers with the
onset of virtual teams. Technology enables new forms of collaboration
but simultaneously introduces challenges in forming trust in the
absence of types of interactions that often build trust with colocated
teams. Research veriﬁes that trust remains important in virtual teams
but faces additional challenges in regard to both heightened concern
about whether effort among team members will be reciprocated and
concerns over whether some types of work can actually be conducted
effectively in a virtual environment.31

Page 113
While it is true that the other four actions contribute to the
development of trust (with research suggesting relationships are the
most effective enabler among the four), we have chosen to call out
developing trust as a separate item because we noted an interesting
phenomenon among some of the most successful collaborative
leaders we analyzed: they take speciﬁc, intentional actions to
demonstrate trust in others. Often, in doing so they also intention-
ally made the ﬁrst move.
On July 15, 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced his
intention to conduct a diplomatic visit to the People’s Republic of
China. The announcement followed several years of conﬁdential and
subtle public overtures to Chinese leadership, including a secret visit to
Beijing by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. The opportu-
nity to improve U.S.-China relations was of critical strategic impor-
tance to the United States, addressing the need to settle existing
tensions regarding the political status of Taiwan and bring peaceful
resolution to the Vietnam War. Even more critically, the United
States faced mounting concerns regarding the growing inﬂuence of
the Soviet Union, so it viewed an alliance with China as an important
opportunity to strengthen its position in the Cold War balance.
When the visit ﬁnally took place in February 1972, it allowed both
nations to demonstrate a new beginning in strengthened relations after
a long estrangement. Nixon conducted a diplomatic meeting with
Chairman Mao Zedong, followed by a week of sightseeing, meetings
with other Chinese ofﬁcials, and public appearances. The trip gave
citizens of both countries a view into the leadership of each country
and gave U.S. citizens their ﬁrst detailed look at the Chinese culture
and people in over 25 years. The resulting improvement in diplomatic
relations between the two nations was dramatic and is widely viewed
as a key turning point in the Cold War. It was also perhaps the greatest
achievement of Nixon’s presidency, notable both for its political
importance and for its unexpected nature—few had expected such
a gesture. Today “Nixon goes to China” is a frequently used metaphor
referring to an unexpected gesture intended to build trust.

The Impact of Collaborative Leaders
In summary, our investigation of collaborative leaders reveals a type
that emphasizes cocreation of strategy. In both strategy formation and
strategy execution, they favor an inclusive approach that involves
others and results in mutually beneﬁcial solutions. As a result, both
their actions and the leaders themselves are thought of highly as the
approach they take to solving problems by enrolling others. From the
conversations we held with their teammates, we found that often they
wanted the collaborative leader to succeed because they saw direct
beneﬁt to themselves as well.
Collaborative leaders also make great partners and bridge builders
between organizations.As such,they are wellsuitedtorolesthatinvolve
forging alliances, maintaining client relationships, and leading new
ventures that involve navigating unfamiliar territory. These bridges
can also be useful within organizations across traditional silos. Collabo-
rative leaders can thus bring a lot of value to business functions, such as
ﬁnance or other shared services, where the beneﬁts of centralization are
best realized when led by an individual who understands the unique
challenges of working with others to get things done.
While we noted in the opening of this section that our graduate
students often struggled to identify CEOs known as collaborative
leaders, based on our analysis of both the skills speciﬁc to this leadership
type and the trends of an increasingly interdependent global market-
place, we expect this might eventually look like an historical anomaly.
There are many reasons to believe that the collaborative chief executive
will be the leader of the future.
Similarities and Differences
Having reviewed each of the four types of strategic leadership in greater
detail, we can now see many themes emerge. As we have noted in
several instances, similarities and differences exist. Both directive and
114
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC02
03/10/2015
2:22:54
Page 115
visionary leaders demonstrate signiﬁcant control, but whereas the
visionary leader focuses on implementing a particular view of the
future, the directive leader focuses more on the organization itself.
Incubating and collaborative leaders engage others extensively in
strategy formation and execution, but the way they choose to work
with others plays out very differently. Both directive and incubating
leaders empower others to drive strategic value, but they do it in very
different ways. Each of these comparisons helps clarify the differences
between each of the four types and highlights the unique contribution
that each can make.
The key question this raises is one of choice: When and how are
each of these four types best applied? That is the question we will now
address.

Examples of
Strategic Leadership
Having proposed a deﬁnition of strategic leadership and the four
strategic leadership types, we will now review real-world case exam-
ples that address each one. The key actions we itemized in Chapter 2
came out of discussions with hundreds of individuals who helped us
uncover and clarify our deﬁnitions. The examples we provide in this
chapter stood out during that analysis, providing some of the most
clear and compelling portraits of what strategic leadership looks like
in action.
Four Examples
The following four stories feature leaders we know and with whom
we have had the pleasure to work. As you’ll see, they are each
accomplished leaders in their own regard. They’ve made a real impact
117

3GC03
03/10/2015
2:26:32
Page 118
in their chosen profession or organization, and at times they’ve even
had a larger impact on our world and society. Our working relation-
ship with these leaders gave us an inside view to both what they’ve
accomplished and the important choices they made regarding how
they approached their work. More importantly, they are excellent
examples of what real people do to lead strategically. In this regard,
they aren’t abstract. We’ve spent extensive time observing and talking
with each of them, allowing us to present a detailed account of the key
things they’ve done to get results. These leaders are also practical role
models, and their stories provide useful examples of leadership deci-
sions that scale. In our view, the things they’ve done are within the
reach of anyone with the desire to learn from the lessons they can
teach.
Indiegogo: Driving Strategy through Vision
Visit the Indiegogo website and you’ll ﬁnd people sharing thousands
of fascinating ideas: a household robot to track family schedules, an
adhesive patch to ﬁght mosquito-borne disease in Africa, or a
documentary to honor the life of ﬁlm critic Roger Ebert. Like all
of the ideas posted on Indiegogo, these three were posted by someone
passionate about bringing that particular idea to life. They are
remarkable because of how compelling they are. They are also
remarkable for another reason—all three of them have attracted
hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from around the world.
Indiegogo launched in 2008 as “the world’s funding engine.” It
enables anyone to raise money for a speciﬁc project. Campaigners—
individuals seeking funds for a project—begin by posting an overview
of their idea on the Indiegogo website. Visitors can browse projects by
category, learn about them through descriptions, photos, and short
videos, and then contribute to projects that suit their interest. In
return, contributors often receive gifts—which Indiegogo calls
“perks”—based on their level of contribution.

Page 119
The particular model of fund-raising—often called “crowdfund-
ing”—has similarities to long-standing techniques practiced by organi-
zations like National Public Radio, which for decades has run
membership drives, offering gifts like mugs or tote bags in exchange
for contributions. Indiegogo distinguishes itself from this and other
fund-raising tools through their ability to deliver massive scale on a
turnkey basis, bypassing the historical constraints of audience access and
logistical challenges.
For campaigners, Indiegogo offers an alternative source for raising
capital beyond traditional methods that might be limited by an
individual’s personal network or the criteria of ﬁnancial institutions.
Anybody can raise funds for a project as long as they have an idea that
will interest other people and the energy to be a champion for their
project.
For contributors, Indiegogo offers a way for someone to become a
part of creating something new. For some people, it’s the simple
opportunity to contribute to something they care about. For others,
it’s the chance to play a speciﬁc role. For example, artists often use
Indiegogo to offer top contributors the chance to contribute an idea to
a ﬁlm’s script or even to be included in the ﬁnished product as a
character.
Indiegogo was born of a really big idea—to disrupt the ﬁnance
industry. As cofounder Danae Ringlemann states, “Our mission is to
democratize access to capital. We want to clear the way for anybody to
have a chance to raise money and have their success be based on how
hard they are willing to work and how much their audience cares—
and nothing else.”1 Danae has always felt passionate about the topic,
having watched her parents struggle with the day-to-day ﬁnancial
challenges of running a family business. As she started her own career,
her early work in the banking industry gave her better insight into
how decisions on access to ﬁnancial capital were made. It also showed
her that gatekeepers controlled most of these decisions. She came to
realize the corresponding struggle that many people had navigating
the challenges of accessing and inﬂuencing those gatekeepers.

Page 120
As Danae went to graduate school to get her MBA, she explored
these ideas with her fellow students and colleagues. Current Indiegogo
CEO Slava Rubin, one of its three cofounders, recalled their conver-
sation over a dinner:
Eric Schell, Danae, and I all had a mutual frustration with raising money.
Eric was on the board of a theater company, Danae was working with different
ﬁlmmakers and entrepreneurs as an investment banker, and I had raised funds
for charity after my dad had died of bone marrow cancer 10 years earlier. We
thought to ourselves, isn’t it interesting that we’re all tech savvy and there are
some interesting marketplaces that are already being democratized by the
Internet like YouTube for content or eBay for auctions, but access to capital is
still all about the gatekeeper. We thought, “How can we create a platform
where anybody can fund anything?”2
That dinner conversation framed their initial idea: an open market-
place for funding without any traditional gatekeepers.
Their idea set off an initial process of research and due diligence.
They quickly found out that executing that simple idea was much more
complicated. “As part of doing research, we found out about the
Securities Act of 1933 as well as various different banking laws,” Slava
explained. “We realized that an investment instrument or a ﬁnancial
product would be really hard to implement because of regulatory
issues. We were forced to make a decision—was that going to stop us?”
Needless to say, it did not. That research led them to explore
alternative models, including donations. This simpliﬁed the regulatory
issues but introduced other complications and questions. What would
motivate someone to give if they were no longer gaining equity
participation and the associated beneﬁts of the mutual funds they’d
originally focused on?
Outside of proﬁt, we thought there were a few other reasons why a person
would fund anything. It could be that they care about the person or the
cause—we call that passion—maybe they want a product like a service or an

experience or they want reputation like their name in the credits—we call that
perks—or maybe they want to participate in a movement bigger than
themselves—we ended up calling that participation. Right away we had
this massive vision of what could be accomplished. We were thinking about
YouTube, we were thinking about eBay. Wouldn’t it be cool if instead of
having venture capitalists, banks, and people in the government getting to
decide if someone could raise money or not . . . how cool would it be if people
could directly decide whether or not you would get the money? The challenge
was how to go from vision to reality.
Ironically, part of that challenge was getting others to see and
believe in the opportunity that they envisioned. They needed stake-
holders to buy in and provide them with the support, resources, and
funding to get started. Slava compared this challenge to the popular
ﬁlm Inception, in which characters implant ideas into other people’s
subconscious:
Understanding Inception is critical to understanding what it’s like to be a
leader and what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. In the movie there are two
realities—the real physical world and the dream world, a layer below it. The
only way characters in the ﬁlm could tell the difference was whether or not a
spinning top would be pulled down by gravity. In the real world, gravity
would pull it down. In the dream world it would spin forever . . . As a
leader, I already have the complete vision of what’s going to happen in my
head. The challenge is how I can bring it to the real world.
Navigating this involved making careful and sometimes difﬁcult
choices. Some of these choices involved constraints. The Indiegogo
team faced an early decision regarding funding when they spoke with
venture capitalists for the ﬁrst time in 2008. Most wanted a larger share
of the company than the founders were willing to give up:
Our plan was to raise funds in Q3 of 2008. But as we went out, we realized
that if we could develop a case study and some traction, we’d be able to get
money at better terms. I had this plan where in Q1 we were going to launch,
Examples of Strategic Leadership
121

3GC03

2:26:32
Page 122
in Q2 we were going to have case studies, and in Q3 we were going to PR our
case studies and then use that PR to raise money at better terms. It was a great
plan . . . except for the fact that the market crashed in Q4 due to the U.S.
mortgage crisis. This destroyed our entire plan. We had to stretch our
bootstrapped funding, which was only supposed to go through 2008 but
ended up lasting until the summer of 2010—two years later.
The team adapted and ended up using the new funding time line
to their advantage. By the time they eventually did secure funding,
they had a much more mature platform and position in the market-
place. The team ended up securing $1.5 million in seed funding in
March 2011 and a total of $56.5 million over the course of three years.
Another challenge was where to focus. “Do we want to go after
every market segment ﬁrst, or do we want to start with one vertical?”
said Slava. They started out in ﬁlm only, feeling that they’d beneﬁt
from having a clear focus as a team and a clear target audience to which
they could explain themselves. In this regard, they saw themselves as
taking an approach similar to Amazon, which started out only selling
books before becoming the expansive retailer it is today. “You need to
get people focused on small ideas ﬁrst and then keep making it bigger.”
Taking this approach allowed them to limit and focus their initial
efforts into building their proﬁle among artists and ﬁlmmakers, and
they launched at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008. Tying
their launch to a well-known event gave them visibility—and, maybe
just as importantly, it also limited the cost of acquiring their ﬁrst users.
“Part of it was market strategy, part of it was based on the limitations of
our own resources,” Slava noted. From there they forged other
partnerships, expanding to reach artists beyond ﬁlm in 2010 through
a collaboration with MTV. In 2012, they joined with President Barack
Obama’s Startup America on a crowdfunding initiative aimed at a
much wider audience of entrepreneurs. While this breadth was a key
part of the cofounders’ original vision to disrupt the ﬁnancial industry,
they were intentional in taking practical steps to start small rather than
trying to address the entirety of the opportunity from the start.

Just as they took an iterative approach to their target audience,
the team also evolved Indiegogo as an organization over time. As
they made progress, the roles of the cofounders changed, as Slava
describes:
When we ﬁrst got together, our roles were always the same—we were three
equal cofounders. We were entrepreneurs, we needed to roll up our sleeves and
just do what needed to be done. After a few years, we started to really clarify
our roles. We separated the things we were focused on. We talked about it as
three parts—the hands, the eyes, and the heart. Eric was the hands; he made
everything. He did the design, the engineering, and the coding. If users
played with something, he made it. Danae was the heart, all the operations:
the ﬁnance, the people, the messaging, customer support. The glue was
Danae. I was the eyes: marketing, strategy, PR, and fund-raising–things
that had to do with outside the company, the environment, and how we could
navigate it.
Several things drove this specialization. First, the three cofounders
each had areas of interest and expertise, and while they shared most of
the responsibility, they naturally gravitated to certain work. Second,
they also needed to divide up that work as the scope and size of
Indiegogo grew over time. Third, external pressures also encouraged
them to specialize. “Our investors felt that we needed to have deﬁned
roles,” Slava described. “We needed to look inside ourselves and decide
howwewouldstructureourteam.Thatwasthe ﬁrsttimewe’dusedany
titles, and we decided to become the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief
Technology Ofﬁcer, and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, aligning with
the eyes, hands, and heart we’d talked about in the past.”
As the organization grew, their roles and the wider team contin-
ued to evolve. They made changes to the organization’s structure
every six to nine months over the following three years. As CEO, this
required Slava to adapt. “In the early days, it was much more about
being involved in every single piece of action and going the last mile to
make sure things got done. Now, what’s more common is that I’m
Examples of Strategic Leadership
123

3GC03

2:26:32
Page 124
involved in bringing in the right people and focusing more on the
vision.” Indeed, all three cofounders were dealing with the trade-offs
and choices that had to be made. As the business and the team grew,
they had to make choices. While this involved increased delegation,
the cofounders decided that they had to continue to maintain
ownership and direct control of two things: assembling the right
team and maintaining the company’s vision.
They focused on building the right team by paying attention to
hiring. “I’m still involved in every single hire,” Slava said. “I’ve been a
stickler about that because I think that my main role is providing
guidance and parameters, making sure we’re hiring people who are
empowered with a scope of work to make big decisions.” In addition
to bringing the right skills, the team also focused on hiring people with
a passion for their vision. “I just keep focusing on ‘the why,’” Danae
said. “If you talk about the why, people who also have the same why
self-select in. We have amazing people who come to us because we’re
proactive about making sure our mission is always very clear. We hire
people who believe in that mission. If you want to be at Indiegogo just
because you want to get some skills and put an Internet technology
company on your resume, you just don’t make the cut. You have to
fundamentally believe in the problem we’re solving.”
In addition to hiring, the cofounders held onto their role of
maintaining the vision. To do this, they went through an exercise to
formalize a set of values that could codify what they were trying to do.
These values came out of their experience starting the company and
helped them deﬁne an alignment between that initial vision and the
decisions that needed to be made every day. Over the course of several
conversations, Danae described how the values came about:
We didn’t really start out to do a values exercise, but once we had the money
to start hiring people, we all got together to talk. What came out was that we
all came to work for the same four reasons. We all wanted to change an
industry that needed to be changed. We were excited to change something that
needed to be changed, and fearlessness became a word that jumped out of
124

3GC03

Page 125
that. Second, we all wanted to bring our whole selves to work. Authenticity
was the word that came out of that. We all came to work because we wanted to
work with others. We preferred winning with others versus winning alone,
and that was the nature of all of us. Collaboration became our word because
of that. And ﬁnally, we all wanted to help people who wanted to be helped.
We were all tired of being cogs in a larger wheel, and we wanted to know that
how we were spending our time every day was helping people in this world.
Empowerment was the word that came out of that.
These discussions and the resulting four values—fearlessness,
authenticity, collaboration, and empowerment—became a new lan-
guage that reinforced their vision. As the company grew, more people
were making decisions, but the vision and values keep the overall goal
at the center of everything the company does.
While their choices on what to keep and hand off made sense to
them, these choices were often tricky to navigate. “Sometimes it’s
funny now when people on the team ask me what we should do,”
Slava remarked. “They want to get guidance and they really want the
CEO’s perspective, but I tell them that I really don’t know the answer
because I’m not involved in some decisions anymore.” Likewise,
while the vision remained with the founding team, they all realized
they had to let others participate. “You don’t want to be autocratic,
and just say to people, ‘Hey, this is the way it goes, so follow me.’ But
at the same time, you don’t want to get paralyzed by making everyone
think that they are involved and just going around in circles. It’s been a
tricky balance of taking in all the information and being able to convey
leadership in a way that makes sense and is compelling.”
Last, Indiegogo has had to stay focused on what would drive
future success. While their vision deﬁnes their success in the long term,
interim milestones bring their own unique requirements. Having
navigated growth, Indiegogo ﬁnds itself in an enviable market position
as the world’s largest crowdfunding platform, with more than 300,000
campaigns launched as of late 2014. This means they can revisit and
reﬁne the way they create value for their customers. Their increasing

scale allows them to do things they couldn’t execute as a smaller entity,
like gain insights into what distinguishes successful campaigners from
unsuccessful ones.
Erica Labovitz, Indiegogo’s Head of Customer Happiness, joined
the team as the ﬁrst full-time employee of the company in 2010. We
sat in on one of Erica’s workshops for campaigners and listened as she
translated Indiegogo’s massive collection of campaign data into
actionable insights. The participants in that session had straightforward
questions. One campaigner was developing a solution to provide
portable, rechargeable batteries in Third World countries. Having
raised $100,000, he needed an additional $150,000 to begin producing
prototypes. While his questions were largely practical ones—how to
describe his goal on the Indiegogo website, what the best day was to
launch his campaign—the implications of his questions for his overall
success were very broad.
Erica shared both guiding principles and speciﬁc suggestions to
address his concerns. “There are three things we’ve learned that create
a good campaign: one, have a good pitch. Two, be proactive. Three,
ﬁnd an audience that cares,” Erica explained. While the merit of these
principles is probably timeless, she was able to make them even more
practical given Indiegogo’s data and platform. “If a campaigner
includes a video in their pitch, you’ll raise on average 115 percent
more money than a campaign without a video. We know that
campaigners who provide updates once every ﬁve days tend to raise
218 percent more than those who update less often. Campaigns that
reach their targets usually raise about a third of their goals in the ﬁrst
week.” In addition to simply providing the Indiegogo platform to
reach potential donors, Erica’s advice gave the workshop attendees
practical, fact-driven guidance and a conﬁdence they otherwise
wouldn’t have had.3
Looking ahead, the team knows they’ll have to keep evolving
how they execute their vision. They need to continue to think and act
strategically, drawing fresh insight that will drive the company
forward. For example, Slava noted the deeper issues that have surfaced
126

3GC03

Page 127
about human behavior. “We’ve seen that people tend to outsource
their risk mitigation capacity. Once I see someone already involved in
a campaign that I trust, now I’m more willing to follow. We also see
people acting on social proof. As a campaigner, you always need to get
your own audience on board ﬁrst. Strangers do not want to be suckers.
They do not want to fund your empty campaign. Given that, you
need to get your friends, your family, and your fans to help you get the
momentum ﬁrst, and then Indiegogo will help you get more success
than you could ever get on your own.” Indiegogo’s opportunity, and
challenge, are to continue to improve on fulﬁlling that promise.
As these milestones come and go, the team expects to continue
using their vision as a primary vehicle for leading Indiegogo. It will
provide the focus, motivation, and criteria they need to lead in their
industry. Danae told us:
The reason why we’ve been able to pivot and move was because we’ve cared
more about the problem we were trying to solve and doing it the best way
rather than clinging to how we were solving it. We’ve been so focused on
ﬁxing ﬁnance and making it more efﬁcient, fair and egalitarian that we’ve
been able to pivot and not be married to the solution. We’ve changed our
product a ton. We’re still changing our product. What doesn’t change is that
why: to democratize access to capital and empower everybody.
Understanding Indiegogo’s Success
As a case study, Indiegogo offers us several insights as to what visionary
leadership looks like. They provide practical examples of all ﬁve of the
key actions of visionary leaders that we highlighted in Chapter 2: the
founders monitored trends, developed insights, designed a solution,
iterated quickly, and took action to enroll others. Their story also
brings to life many of the real challenges that visionary leaders face.
Looking at Indiegogo’s story, there are three things that we found
particularly interesting.
Examples of Strategic Leadership
127

2:26:32
Page 128
First, they show the importance of iteration to this type of
leadership. All of our conversations with the team involved the
importance of adapting and advancing the vision through small steps.
The team’s reaction to the constraints of ﬁnancial regulation, their
navigation of changes in the economy, and their careful selection of
third-party partners all reﬂect this reality. These conversations were set
against the backdrop of a similar theme in Silicon Valley. Members of
the team talked about it as a guiding principle, called “test and go.” In
the past, starting a new business would begin with an elaborate and
comprehensive business plan. Today, there’s less up-front planning
but, ironically, fewer untested assumptions. “Today you have data,
and research, and feedback, and customer guidance in real time,” Slava
noted. “People really used to have to shoot in the dark. Now it’s like
we have our headlights turned on. Increasingly, technologies allow
our team and our customers to iterate so quickly.”
Second, this ability to quickly iterate heightens the importance of
focus. The ability to do things quickly in many ways expands what is
possible at any given moment. Unfortunately, it also results in an
exponential increase in choice. Even with limited resources, the
Indiegogo team had the opportunity to pursue a range of users,
industries, international geographies, and feature enhancements at
almost every point along the way. As one example, a key need that
Indiegogo’s users often face when running campaigns is how to offer
perks and rewards to donors. Handling the distribution of perks can be
a daunting task for many campaigns, and Indiegogo faced a decision
on how much assistance they would provide. While services related to
the administration of perks could have been a source of added revenue
for the company, in the end it wasn’t a key enabler to their primary
objective of growth. Indeed, it could have been a distraction, given
how resource intensive the activity can be. Instead, they concentrated
on the less resource-intensive approach of providing their users with
ideas and advice. They provide to all campaigners an online resource
they call the Indiegogo Campaign Playbook.

Given the importance of focus, we asked the team how they
thought about it. Slava reﬂected on the relationship using a metaphor:
Too often people like to use the octopus approach. If you put a piece of
cellophane in front of it, an octopus will use its eight tentacles to try and break
through. They’ll have an equal distribution of weight across the cellophane,
pushing it around but not actually breaking through it. There’s not enough
focused pressure anywhere, even though it’s using 100 units of energy.
Instead, if you put just 5 units of energy behind a small little knife, it can
easily puncture right through the cellophane. It goes through really quickly.
Like an octopus, many teams can’t accomplish very much because they have
too many things and they don’t focus. Bringing a vision to reality is very hard
to do if you have too many things that the team, investors, users, or the general
public need to understand.
Third, and last, the Indiegogo story highlights the many practical
beneﬁts of a powerful vision. In the course of their story, the vision
helped the team achieve a wide range of things:
■
It established initial alignment among the three cofounders.
■
It enabled them to work in a context of ambiguity without the
need for clear role deﬁnition.
■
It attracted and motivated the team, as others joined in with
excitement about making an impact and changing the world.
■
It attracted users, providing a clearly understandable message
about what Indiegogo did and the possibilities it could enable.
■
It helped make decisions, allowing them to decide which oppor-
tunities to act on and which to walk away from.
■
It acted as a benchmark, encouraging the team to constantly think
big, aim high, and refresh their plan based on new insights along
the way.
In all of these ways, the Indiegogo case illustrates how a visionary
approach functions as a speciﬁc type of strategic leadership. While
there are elements of the other three leadership types in their

story—including attention to roles and governance matters that are
critical to directive leadership, or partnerships with MTV and others
common to collaborative leadership—the essence of their success is
the success of their vision. The team found a powerful idea and used it
to drive change. In doing so, they built a company, distributed
millions of dollars to people around the world to fund their dreams,
and changed the way people think about gaining access to capital.
P&G’s Latin American Merger with Gillette: Driving Strategy
through Structure and Process
In early 2005, Procter & Gamble (P&G) agreed to acquire Gillette in
an effort to combine many of the world’s top brands and broaden
P&G’s portfolio of consumer products. P&G set a goal of generating
more than $1 billion annually in combined revenue and savings within
three years of merging with Gillette. P&G realized that much of this
value would ultimately be attributed to a well-organized approach to
integrating Gillette’s worldwide organization. A major component of
this required the integration and transformation of IT.
At the time of the acquisition, José Ignacio Sordo was the Latin
American CIO for P&G, leading an IT organization composed of
more than 2,200 associates.4 The team provided IT services across the
entire region. To increase the likelihood of P&G optimizing the
Gillette brand and realizing the synergy objective, José was asked to
lead the Latin American P&G and Gillette business integration and to
drive the integration, coordination, and execution of the new orga-
nization’s business capability. Because P&G’s leadership team planned
to rely on the Latin American experience to more effectively and
efﬁciently move into other markets, José was asked to achieve this
within two years of the acquisition.
The geographic scope of José’s undertaking was huge. Just in terms
of Latin America alone, he was responsible for the Andean Cluster
(Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia), the South Cone
130

Page 131
(Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay), Latin America North
(Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
Honduras), Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. The func-
tional scope of José’s undertaking was similarly broad. His organiza-
tion was responsible for all ordering, shipping, and billing systems,
P&G’s physical distribution network, manufacturing control systems,
integrated trade terms and agreements, accounting and ﬁnancial
reporting systems, P&G’s Human Resource beneﬁt harmonization
and HR system, infrastructure standardization, facilities consolidation,
and plan system optimization. Charged with establishing the
approach, methodology, and process for integrating the two giants,
José quickly realized that a stumble on his and his organization’s part
would jeopardize the business case behind the P&G-Gillette merger.
The risks included shortfalls in proﬁtability or underperformance
in P&G’s brand recognition, which was expected to result from their
acquisition of Gillette.
From José’s perspective, three factors would ultimately contribute
to the successful integration of P&G and Gillette:
1. The “new” P&G had the right to succeed, ensured by its taking
steps to not lose sight of or become distracted while delivering on
its value proposition and acting in a manner consistent with and
supportive of its underlying values and overarching mission and
vision.
2. The merged P&G and Gillette organization would quickly pro-
vide added value to stakeholders and customers, remaining nimble
by leveraging existing structures, systems, processes, and so on.
3. The “new” P&G would identify and address potential impedi-
ments, obstacles, and barriers to success by proactively taking steps
to reduce, mitigate, or avoid the most likely threats and monitor-
ing progress so unexpected challenges could be identiﬁed and
addressed along the way.
José considered these three factors to be a given and was conﬁdent
the new P&G would bolster its brand, increase proﬁtability, and
Examples of Strategic Leadership

optimize synergy savings if it focused on one goal: execution.
Yet along with this goal, he considered leadership and team contri-
bution to be of paramount importance:
My goal was not to create a team of doers . . . it was to create a team of
leaders. A team of leaders was essential to P&G’s success, a team of leaders
willing to make the tough call, willing to do the right things for the right
reasons. Our approach was designed to foster leadership, not a team of
followers waiting for their next set of directives, guidance, or orders. Of equal
importance was personal and team contribution. From my perspective, leaders
help generate and implement ideas. They contribute to the organization’s
success in several ways: they come up with ideas; create an environment
conducive to others coming up with ideas; they provide guidance and direction;
they also step back or step aside and give others the freedom they need to do
what is necessary to get the job done. Throughout the process, leaders along
with all the other members of the team must remain fast, speedy, nimble.
From José’s perspective, this speed and agility required focus, and
focus was possible only through the absence of distraction or disrup-
tion. José therefore believed it was important for members of the
combined organization to quickly establish new assumptions and
expectations about what was and wasn’t important. It was critical
that everyone felt that they were on the same team. One way José
helped Gillette employees feel they were part of P&G was to “connect
the two company networks—enabling e-mail and other personal
productivity systems within the P&G ﬁrewall—on the ﬁrst day
following the close of the deal.”
This connectivity achieved both operational and symbolic out-
comes—for example, everyone was immediately on the same com-
munications platform, and welcome signage was set up at every site.
Along with the focus on execution was the emphasis on the basics:
I realized that individuals would naturally prefer for things to remain the
same . . . the P&G employees would prefer to retain and use P&G legacy
132
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC03

Page 133
systems and processes while the 10,000 Gillette employees would prefer to
keep and utilize Gillette legacy systems and processes. Although I am a strong
believer in continuous improvement, the days, weeks, and months following a
merger is not the time to be deciding how to improve systems and processes;
rather, it is important to focus on the basics. We therefore encouraged
individuals to accept whatever P&G or Gillette system or process was selected
as the “new” P&G best practice with the understanding that reﬁnements and
improvements would occur later on. We encouraged business value via
acceptance and compliance; in encouraging acceptance and compliance, we
discouraged second-guessing, distractions, and disagreement. This—along
with our emphasis on quickness, speed, and nimbleness—helped us avoid
some of the hurdles typically encountered following an acquisition or merger.
José and his leadership team not only encouraged acceptance and
compliance through words but also backed up their words with
action. They adopted a slate of incentives to encourage P&G and
Gillette legacy employees to accept change, focus on their personal
and team contribution, and execute on the new organization’s value
proposition. To treat everyone fairly, P&G provided bonus opportu-
nities for P&G legacy employees, grant opportunities for Gillette
legacy employees, and stock option opportunities for business leaders.
The incentives were tied to these expectations:
■
Leaders would not recommend substantial changes to corporate
functions, systems, or processes during the ﬁrst year.
■
All employees would need to support the use of rather basic core
capabilitiesduringtheﬁrstyear,realizing that continuous improve-
ment opportunities would be acted upon at a later point in time.
■
Everyone was to contribute to three clear goals: (1) help make the
P&G and Gillette integration happen, (2) not put up roadblocks
during the ﬁrst year, and (3) personally assist with or contribute to
the P&G and Gillette integration.
To help set the stage for optimal execution, José’s leadership
team participated in a strategic planning session. The planning
Examples of Strategic Leadership
133

3GC03
03/10/2015
2:26:32
Page 134
session was designed to allow the P&G leadership team to do the
following:
■
Decide what it would start doing, stop doing, or begin doing
differently to help ensure that employees would not lose sight of
delivering on its value proposition;
■
Determine how the organization would optimize performance by
leveraging existing structures, systems, and processes;
■
Identify likely impediments, obstacles, and barriers to P&G’s
short-term success;
■
Identify steps it would take to reduce, mitigate, or avoid the most
likely threats; and
■
Establish a process and time line for monitoring progress so that
unexpected challenges could be identiﬁed and addressed through-
out the ﬁrst year.
To make it easier for the business leaders to accept and adapt to
their new expectations, José allowed them to review, revise, and in
most cases completely “ofﬂoad” their previous portfolio of priorities.
After careful assessment, it became clear that many of their priorities
before the P&G and Gillette merger had ceased to exist—or at a
minimum, their order of priority changed on the acquisition close date.
In our discussions with José, he noted that a critically important
theme was introduced at the beginning and reinforced throughout the
strategic planning session:
I highlighted that it was extremely important that this merger succeed . . . we
had to rise up to the occasion and think and act in an exemplary manner . . .
we were operating under an extreme amount of pressure coming from our
stakeholders and customers . . . we had to focus on our survival . . . we had
to trust each other . . . we couldn’t second-guess each other . . . we had to
execute . . . we had to remain quick, fast, and nimble.
The strategic planning session also served as a forum for emphasiz-
ing and reinforcing three important messages: “First, if we—regardless
134
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC03
03/10/2015
2:26:32
Page 135
of our position, title, or role—help P&G succeed, we will be
rewarded. Second, as of day one, we are P&G’s ‘new’ leadership
team . . . it is important that we think and act in an aligned and
uniﬁed manner . . . our doing so begins here. Third, we must work
together to address concerns our customers, suppliers, governments,
and key stakeholders might have . . . we must each strongly believe
that we can and will make this integration happen . . . by ‘believing’
it will happen and we will all end up being winners.”
José structured and facilitated the strategic planning session in
such a way that each leadership team member could only reach one
conclusion: we can and will make this happen. He solicited every-
one’s views and, to the extent possible, committed to acting on
their suggestions and recommendations. Suggestions likely to bol-
ster or facilitate execution were recognized, emphasized, and/or
adopted. Suggestions likely to undermine the organization’s speed,
agility, and nimbleness were dropped, suspended, or postponed. For
each recommendation he adopted, follow-up actions were identi-
ﬁed, responsibilities were assigned, and critical dates were estab-
lished. In doing so, José Ignacio Sordo facilitated a process by which
interconnections were identiﬁed. This served to reinforce to the
leadership team members that their success would not be through
independent action but, rather, through teamwork and uniﬁed,
aligned action.
To introduce and reinforce new expectations and requirements
throughout the combined organization, José established a centralized
command center. This served two important purposes. Operationally,
it helped members of the leadership team focus on the most important
priorities, monitor progress, and identify and address unexpected and
unanticipated obstacles. It also served as a depository of lessons learned
and best practices that needed to be shared throughout the organiza-
tion. Symbolically, it showcased strategic goals, metrics, time lines,
and responsible parties. Importantly, it functioned as a scorecard,
spotlighting key milestones. José also used it to spotlight exemplary
actions that had taken place, providing special recognition and

acknowledgment to team members who demonstrated the kind of
actions that José wanted others to emulate.
José asked his leadership team to deﬁne or update Service Level
Agreements that the IT organization had with each of the P&G business
segments. The purpose of this was twofold: ﬁrst and foremost, it would
help solidify the trust that existed between the IT organization and the
business sectors. Second, José also knew the process of conﬁrming or
establishing new Service Level Agreements and that the Service Level
Agreements themselves would bolster the conﬁdence that business
leaders had regarding P&G’s ability to maintain focus, speed, and agility.
José believed the resulting “service-level descriptions and quality and
cost speciﬁcations helped the IT leaders recognize what their organi-
zation had to focus on and also reinforced to the P&G business leaders
that they would receive the assistance and support they required to
accomplish their newly deﬁned strategic goals.”
To provide needed direction and support to the new workforce,
José relied on focused and highly centralized communications. José’s
leadership team identiﬁed and agreed on underlying communication
principles. These principles included immediate transparency to
everyone responsible for contributing to P&G’s success, while also
ensuring that information shared was consistently accurate and com-
municated in a manner likely to resonate with individuals throughout
the organization. Establishing P&G’s integration communication
strategy proved to be time consuming, but José Ignacio Sordo
knew that actions that would increase trust and credibility would
greatly outweigh the extra time and effort.
Because José considered integration-related communication to
be so critical, he assigned the responsibility to just one person. The
individual served as P&G’s ofﬁcial voice and was responsible for
ensuring that everyone in the new P&G organization received needed
information on a timely basis, and that all communications helped
maintain and reinforce an “open and supportive” environment in
which ﬂawless execution could occur. Realizing that the average
P&G employee received dozens or even hundreds of messages each
136

Page 137
day, this communication czar made sure integration-related messages
stood apart from the countless other messages received throughout the
day. Of equal importance was that messages be (1) shared by indi-
viduals most likely to be considered credible and trustworthy, and
(2) customized so that they likely met the communication styles of
those receiving the messages. The communication czar also played an
equally important role in helping ensure that leaders’ actions matched
their words. Steps were taken to illustrate or reinforce key messages,
and key messaging was followed by concrete action. When actions
likely to distract occurred, the communication czar recommended
they be curtailed, modiﬁed, or suspended until a later date. When
team or individual interests were not being adequately addressed, the
czar employed additional communication events, vehicles, or channels
and/or recommended that other steps be taken to address the need.
José considered incoming information to be as important as the
messaging being broadcast throughout the organization. He knew that
feedback would verify or discount the strength of the plan initially
developed and would help identify areas or aspects of the plan needing
to be modiﬁed or reinforced. Feedback would also help senior
leadership identify unexpected and unanticipated obstacles that could
distract teams and individual contributors from doing their job.
In spite of all this preparation, challenges surfaced. Fortunately,
José had established an infrastructure, process, and culture that allowed
the challenges to be identiﬁed and addressed. For example, P&G
recognized early on that for the new organization to succeed, it would
have to keep the Gillette legacy employee voluntary annual turnover
rate at a single-digit level. Realizing how difﬁcult this would be under
the circumstances, José worked with his leadership team to develop
and execute a series of countermeasures. José reﬂected on his approach
in one of our conversations:
We knew we had to keep voluntary turnover to an absolute minimum. We
decided on a ﬁve-part strategy: ﬁrst and foremost, we held our entire
leadership team accountable for retention. They were responsible for
Examples of Strategic Leadership

Page 138
establishing the right environment; we monitored their effort and rewarded
their results and outcomes. This did not come to them as a surprise: we
communicated the need, described the expectation, and left it up to them to
welcome everyone into the “new” P&G organization. Second, we helped
everyone settle into their new role. We helped them recognize the importance
of their contribution; we helped them see the “big picture” by providing career
advice and guidance. We did not speak in generalities; we were direct,
detailed, and speciﬁc. Third, we strengthened our on-boarding and assimila-
tion program. We did not do this in a vacuum; we solicited input from P&G
legacy employees, we took best practices into consideration, we obtained
feedback from Gillette legacy employees . . . and we acted on all of it. It led
to our taking steps to ensure our on-boarding and training programs were well
balanced and properly paced. It also led to our bolstering the performance and
transition management skills of our supervisors and managers. We knew our
frontline managers would make or break us when it came to the “moments of
truth” that a majority of our employees encountered. Fourth, we communi-
cated, communicated, and communicated. In addition to outgoing messaging,
we relied on “robust sensing mechanisms” to alert us to emerging issues so that
we could quickly address them. For example, this helped us recognize the
importance of Employee Beneﬁts harmonization and reinforced the impor-
tance of highlighting and showcasing early wins occurring in the “new”
organization. Finally, it spotlighted the importance of our acting in accordance
with our core values, upholding our integration principles, and “walking the
integration talk.”
José sequenced the P&G and Gillette integration in ﬁve geo-
graphic waves. This strategy was partly driven by the magnitude of
change taking place throughout the organization. However, it also
allowed lessons learned and best practices from an earlier phase to be
identiﬁed and shared throughout the combined organization prior to
the subsequent phase. Interestingly, lessons learned and best practices
took two forms: “Gillette Best Practices” were lessons learned and best
practices from Gillette in the past that were recognized, selected, and
incorporated into P&G’s operating manual. “We considered the
‘Gillette Best Practices’ to be of utmost importance: they helped
138
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC03

2:26:32
Page 139
strengthen our new organization’s operations while giving us instant
credibility and recognition from Gillette’s legacy employees,” José
stated. “P&G Best Practices” were lessons learned and best practices
from P&G in the past that had been tested and proven over time. The
“P&G Best Practices” remained critical to the mission. José was clear
that “they allowed us to ‘keep our eye on the ball’ in terms of
operating the P&G business as always while helping us leverage all
lessons learned and best practices to maximize the total revenue and
proﬁt on the Gillette brands.”
The P&G and Gillette integration demanded discipline. In terms
of governance, José introduced and managed a rigorous, centrally
managed implementation process that contained a series of go/no-go
gates. Prior to advancing between waves, criteria pertaining to systems
and business readiness had to be met and all previously identiﬁed
challenges had to be resolved. “To minimize disruption, each regional
integration was timed to avoid critical ﬁnancial windows, major
product launches, and other key events. Issues, challenges, opportu-
nities, lessons learned, and best practices were applied to the next
wave. Repeating this process increased our efﬁciencies and resulted in
accelerated business optimization. To reduce our risk, we started with
the smallest markets (Peru and Chile represented 5 percent of our total
sales volume) and then expanded into our larger markets. This allowed
us to design, develop, test, reﬁne, and adjust prior to regional
expansion. This was key to our approach—it ensured smooth transi-
tion from one wave to the next.”
Understanding José Ignacio Sordo’s Success
The P&G and Gillette Latin American integration was implemented
on April 1, 2005. Five countries went live on a shared SAP technology
platform, generating invaluable lessons for the rest of the Latin
American waves as well as for the “new” P&G enterprise. Under
José’s leadership, the P&G and Gillette integration exceeded all

expectations, in many cases delivering exceptional results six months
earlier than expected.
Looking more closely at how José leads, it becomes evident that he
applied many of the actions typical of a directive leadership approach.
In exhibiting directive leadership, he did the following:
■
Analyzed the context, situation, and circumstances; decided on
actions to be taken; anticipated the likely results and outcomes of
those actions; and took steps to address the negatives while taking
advantage of the positives.
■
Took the requirements, needs, and business expectations of a
variety of stakeholders into consideration when setting the plan.
■
Assessed the risk associated with his vision and plan, and took steps
to reduce, mitigate, or avoid those risk.
■
Took steps to help teams and individuals focus and contribute to
the organization’s success through the establishment of a clearly
deﬁned plan.
■
Provided needed guidance by establishing governance, deﬁning
roles and responsibilities, managing performance in a consistent
manner, and providing needed incentives and controls.
For José, directive leadership is about doing all that you can to set
the stage for business success, making the strategy and process clear,
and by doing so empowering others to contribute to that success
through the context of their given role.
Much of José’s personal style can be traced to his character. José
places the needs of the organization above his own. He willingly
becomes responsible and accountable for the results of his team as well
as his organization. He relates the following: “My grandfather taught
me that I was only permitted four answers while conducting business:
‘yes,’ ‘no,’ ‘no excuse,’ and ‘I do not understand.’” That philosophy
became the cornerstone of José’s character. For him, there is no
opportunity for equivocation or excuse. The leader should be clear,
concise, and compelling in describing or deﬁning the future and in
establishing and reinforcing performance expectations. The leader
140

owes their team the knowledge, tools, and incentive for contributing
as a member of the team.
For all the ﬁnancial success and operational targets that he
achieved, the lasting testament to José’s strategic leadership is the
fact that the incoming team embraced his work and the company they
joined—even today, approximately 40 percent of the Latin American
Leadership Team has a Gillette heritage.
Design for America: Driving Strategy through Empowering Others
Sitting in her ofﬁce on the campus of Northwestern University,
Professor Liz Gerber recounted to us how she ﬁrst came up with the
idea that became Design for America: “One of my very ﬁrst jobs was
working in toy design. I got to work with kids and elicit ideas from
them that would inform the development process. I was struck by the
amazing ideas they came up with even though nobody had taught
them how to design. That was a very early inﬂuence—ten-year-olds
intimately know this topic of play, and really we just have to give them
a little instruction about how this happens and they can come up with
ideas.”5 That insight eventually led to a program that now involves
thousands of college students, expanded to 24 university campuses, led
to the commercial release of several products, and was featured on the
cover of Fast Company magazine in the fall of 2011.6
Design for America encourages students to bring innovative
solutions to social issues. Students in the program have worked on
problems like reducing the unintended transfer of illness within
hospitals, improving water conservation in cafeterias, and helping
improving the lives of diabetic children. Along the way, the organi-
zation has also developed techniques to improve the conﬁdence and
ability of students to solve problems and make a difference in the
world. As Liz states, “We can use the design process to inﬂuence and
change people’s belief in themselves through their ability to innovate.
How do we prepare future innovators? That’s the challenge.”

“I’ve always admired Teach for America—that model of volun-
teerism,” Liz said. That program, which encourages college graduates
in the United States to spend two years teaching in urban and
underprivileged schools following graduation, gave her the inspiration
to explore alternative ways to teach design. While the two programs
differ in structure (Design for America engages with students while
they are still in school, while Teach for America is a postgraduate
program), they both tap into the growing wave of interest that
Millennials have in social change.
The organization also reﬂects a deep belief that anyone can make
a difference. Just like the children with whom Liz worked when she
was designing toys, she’s consistently observed the fact that great ideas
can come from anywhere. “When I was at Wild Planet Toys, we had
a challenge where we posted a few ideas up on the Web so that
people across the country could vote on them. That was another
insight that there was a huge, untapped population out there of
people—kids—and that if we could teach them a bit, they could
really get involved in this process.” Liz described this as innovation self-
efﬁcacy—the conﬁdence and ability to innovate.7 Her frustration was
that many teaching methods seemed to undermine this conﬁdence,
encouraging students to focus on problems deﬁned for them and
discouraging risk taking in an environment of constant measurement
and evaluation. In Design for America, she wanted to create a very
different environment to teach and empower students to take risks
and make a difference.
Her beliefs were validated by Design for America’s early success.
After gaining support from the dean of Northwestern’s School of
Engineering, she launched the organization in February 2009 with a
small group of students she’d engaged in early stage conversations.
They set out to ﬁnd their ﬁrst project, selecting an existing design
competition focused on improving the lives of children with
diabetes. Liz discovered the competition from an e-mail she received
and passed it along to her students. They were interested, but a bit
142

3GC03

Page 143
anxious—the deadline was in one week. Liz encouraged them in
spite of the timing:
It turns out that was kind of perfect. It didn’t allow the students to sit and
deliberate over this. I told them, “You guys have ﬁre under you. You’re ready
to go, but you have no clue what you’re going to work on. Here is a project
that has been validated by an external group. This is legitimate; it’s
something big; we care about it; it changes the way people live. See what
you can come up with for it.”
The team came up with a concept—a stuffed bear with diabetes
named Jerry. Jerry would be equipped with a combination of hard-
ware and software, allowing children to act as its caretaker. They
would role-play scenarios typical to an effective medical regimen:
diagnosing symptoms, administering regular doses of insulin, and
tending to Jerry’s general health and comfort. This caretaking would
develop the child’s understanding of the importance and details of the
routine through their own caretaking and the empathy they demon-
strated themselves. They wrote up the idea and submitted it to the
competition. And they won.
Emboldened by their success, the students threw themselves into
the organization. They reinvested the prize money from that compe-
tition into additional projects, recruited additional students, added
projects, and started publicizing Design for America beyond the
Northwestern campus. Liz provided encouragement, guidance, and
resources as needed:
I’ve always tried to get them to develop the organization’s identity
themselves and to really have ownership of it. I didn’t always go along
with everything they said, but there were deﬁnitely things I intentionally
decided not to ﬁght even if I would have done something else. Maybe I don’t
love that it’s happening that way, but the majority seems to think it’s the right
way, so we’ll keep going. That said, there are lines. There were things that I
knew were incredibly important or I knew from experience weren’t likely to

Page 144
work, and in those cases, I had to have a say. I’ve also tried to mature the
organization. I’ve said, “Let’s be explicit about our goals and hypotheses.
How are we going to measure them? Have we really succeeded?”
Liz was also networking and advocating on their behalf. “At this
point, my dean advised me to get other people on board,” Liz
recounts. She had his support, and she sought out ways to broaden
that support across a wider network. She would meet with other
faculty and administrators, share the team’s story, and help them see
where things could go.
As momentum built, Liz started to consider a new challenge—how
to scale. Several of the most dedicated students were advocating for
expansion as word spread about the group. “We reached out to more
facultyandstudentswhoknewthingsaboutorganizationalstructureand
the best waystothinkaboutthat.Oneperson offeredtohelporganize it,
and so at that point, we had what would become our ﬁrst studio.”
Studios became a core component of the Design for America
model. As the number of students and projects increased, an over-
arching structure was established to maintain adequate coordination.
Liz and her fellow advisors identiﬁed the students with passion and a
demonstrated track record to take on added responsibility. The Studio
Lead role was created to empower those students. In the course of
building the organization and working with the Studio Leads, Liz and
her advisors developed a number of additional insights. They found
that some techniques were more effective than others in challenging
students and building their skills.8 This “what works” list became a set
of design principles for the program:
1. Scope design projects for immediate local, social, and big impact.
2. Encourage a bias toward action.
3. Feed forward and feedback.
4. Engage with real clients.
5. Follow a strategy of small wins and failures (i.e., learning opport-
unities).
144

2:26:32
Page 145
6. Create an interdependent community, including all stakeholders.
7. Follow a facilitative leadership strategy.
8. Broadcast successes through social networking sites.
Liz and her advisory team reﬁned each of these guidelines as they
learned from experience. For example, they put tremendous effort
into the third principle around feedback, constantly looking for ways
to provide immediate, direct, and authentic feedback and forced
reﬂection in a safe environment. Following the role of Studio
Lead, the second role of Project Coach was formalized. Experienced
students were assigned as coaches following completion of their own
projects. In doing this, continuous learning was built into the process.
The studio structure soon expanded beyond Northwestern.
Students from other universities, including Stanford, Dartmouth,
Cornell, and UCLA, began reaching out. Again, Liz was enthusiastic
but very focused on ﬁnding an approach that would work. “We’ve
had no problem attracting students. Every year we have lots of interest
in creating more studios, but I don’t want to scale at a rate that gives
students really bad experiences.” Even with this intent, Liz had to
embrace the fact that she wouldn’t be able to stop the expansion.
While they could exercise control over the use of the Design for
America brand and certain assets, there was, in fact, very little to
prevent enthusiastic students from joining or even setting up new
studios. “Even today, one of my frustrations as the leader of this
distributed organization is getting accurate numbers,” she lamented.
“What are we saying the number of members is this month? Because I
want to have it consistent. Every time I give a talk, I ﬁnd it’s harder to
pin down than I thought it would be.” This combination of oppor-
tunities and challenges led to two more critical components of the
organization: the Design Loft and the Leadership Studio.
As the Northwestern team started to face the challenges of
supporting other campuses, they realized they needed a way to
consistently replicate the experience. They initially thought of it as
“DFA in a Box.” After further conversations, the Digital Loft came
Examples of Strategic Leadership
145

Page 146
about through collaboration between Liz and a fellow faculty member
from the School of Education and Social Policy. As she described it:
My colleague was doing a lot of work on intelligent tutoring in games, and so I
showed him Design for America. He pointed out that what we were working
on was scaling education. They wouldn’t have grading, but students still need
support with things like process and support and deadlines. The main thing
we talked about in creating the Digital Loft is how to orchestrate the learning
without the class, grades, and syllabus and all that other infrastructure. And
so he came in and said, “I’d love to help you come up with a really social
platform that would enable the information sharing but that would also
promote the right social interactions.”
They set out to build the Digital Loft platform with funding from
the National Science Foundation. One of the most useful features has
been “crowd critique.” Based on concepts popularized as the “wis-
dom of crowds” in the mid-2000s, the team focused on getting
student teams enough feedback from a large population to replicate
the quality of insight normally drawn from individual experts. Using
the platform, a person can present their work in person or virtually,
and people observing can enter comments. Importantly, observers can
also vote on the comments, pushing individual items higher or lower
on the list. Liz explained, “The result is that all the students get better
feedback, because they now have the system to get more feedback
from more people than they would have otherwise. Interestingly, they
also learn how to give better feedback from using this platform by
watching which feedback others view as most effective and helpful.
That was really powerful, and I’d never thought about it before, but
when you’re in a room and everyone is typing, you can see what
comments are getting uploaded. It cues people to give similar, well-
structured feedback.” The platform allows for numerous other ways to
enable networking and collaboration. Often teams will bring in
additional expertise. “Teams can make suggested connections, point-
ing out other teams or experts working on related problems, and add
insights to the conversation.”

Leadership Studio—a summer gathering of studio leaders and
experienced students—emerged as a solution to another scaling prob-
lem: how to build advanced skills and a stronger core network among
the most active students in the program. Students come together and
focus on more advanced problems, including gaining experience
teaching the organization’s core participatory design methodologies
to others. This reinforces the student’s understanding of the core
mechanics of Design for America while also asking them to achieve
enough personal mastery to convey what they know in a credible and
articulate way. The gathering of students also reinforces the network
and ties within the broader organization. “This summer we had 70
students come to learn,” Liz describes. “They’re all gathering to meet
each other, too, so there is a strong and important social component.”
Today, Design for America can count an impressive range of
accomplishments. Like Jerry the Bear, other ideas have found com-
mercial success. The project that focused on hospital-borne illness
resulted in SwipeSense, a device hospital staff carry with them that
monitors and encourages hand hygiene as they travel from patient to
patient. A project focused on quality of life issues for the elderly led
to Luna Lights, a system of modular lighting that activates visual trails
to the restroom or other important locations when sensors indicate the
user has gotten out of bed. These products fulﬁll the mission of Design
for America, helping students to make a difference in the world
through the techniques of human-centered design—observing mat-
ters in context, generating ideas with an interdisciplinary team, and
rapidly prototyping solutions to ﬁnd out what works. The student’s
experience also builds the innovation self-efﬁcacy that Liz mentioned
in our ﬁrst discussion with her. The students leave with skills, but they
also leave empowered. As one Design for America student recounted:
Getting involved in DFA you expect, well okay, I’m going to go do this!
And whatever they tell me to do I’ll do! We’ll go and we’ll make this club and
it will be cool. I didn’t realize until later that these other people didn’t always
know how to do “it” either. I remember that being a really big deal, because
Examples of Strategic Leadership
147

3GC03

Page 148
then you realize that you can do things without being told what to do. And
that’s big; it’s a big lesson . . . you don’t have to be told how to do something
in order to do it. You just do it.9
Sustaining this momentum provides Liz with her own unique
challenge as the organization continues to progress. She has to
maintain a constant focus on how to empower and encourage her
students while also determining the best use of her own accumulated
experience with the organization.
These days I feel sometimes like I have a strange role in that I’ve been around
longer than all the students, so I know what we’ve done before. Someone will
bringupan idea, andI thinkinmyhead,“Oh yeah,we triedthat then, and we
tried that then, and it didn’t work either time.” But instead of discouraging
them, I always try and saysomething like, “Great, let me give you some insight
into other previous efforts, but I love that you’re excited about this. Plan it out,
show us what you’d like to do, and let’s try it.” In thosecases, I don’t shut them
down, but I do ask them to gather a little more evidence about whether it’s going
to work or not. Given where we’ve evolved to, I think that’s my new role.
By encouraging students while also challenging them when she
sees the need, she’s making the students better. Liz is also modeling the
very essence of what has deﬁned Design for America’s success. She’s
highly focused on empowering her students, encouraging them to
bring passion and a conﬁdence that they can try things and do things
that they haven’t done before. But, at the same time, she adds value by
equipping them with insights, connections, and resources that they
wouldn’t have otherwise in the spirit of making them as successful as
they can be.
Understanding the Success of Design for America
Design for America ﬁts the full deﬁnition of an incubator, helping
students generate, formalize, test, and implement ideas. In doing so, it
has generated tremendous energy among students who are interested
148
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC03
03/10/2015
2:26:32
Page 149
in addressing big, real-world problems they wouldn’t otherwise be as
empowered to tackle.
The approach that Liz took working with her students and building
the organization also gives us practical examples of the things that
incubating leaders do. For example, she encouraged them to focus on
projects that address meaningful problems that people would care
about. She thought very critically about this, demonstrating a bias
for problems that would be easy for people outside the organization to
understand and that the team was likely to be able to tackle in a
meaningful way. This helped the students build credibility for their
work by assuring in advance that their ideas would address issues people
would care about. This reﬂects one of the key actions of incubating
leaders that we described in Chapter 2—assessing opportunities.
Having prequaliﬁed the team’s projects, she then went on to
improve their odds of success through other key actions we’ve noted,
including the development of relevant social networks that could help
the students succeed, the lending of assets like her expertise and the
visibility that Design for America could bring to good ideas, and ﬁnally
the development of a robust support ecosystem through tools like the
Digital Loft.
Through our discussions with Liz and our observation of the
Design for America program, we came to realize the tremendous
energy she and her team put into structuring the student experience.
She spoke at length regarding the principles and tactics she considered.
She knew what success looked like in her mind, and in all aspects this
was about empowering her students. In Chapter 2, we described the
focus of the incubating leader as deﬁning personal success on the basis
of the success of others—a good description of what Liz and Design for
America have been able to accomplish.
Google Takeout: Driving Strategy through Cocreation
Brian Fitzpatrick joined Google in 2005 to found the Chicago engi-
neering team. He arrived after earlier work at Apple and several other
Examples of Strategic Leadership

startups. Brian had also spent time on various open-source projects,
including key contributions he made to an application called “Subver-
sion” that powers the work of thousands of engineers around the world.
At the time that Brian joined, Google was experiencing a period of
explosive growth. In its core search business, it was evolving rapidly,
creating enormous distance between itself and competitors like Yahoo!
While Google was experimenting in numerous other product catego-
ries that would lead to Gmail (launched as an invitation-only beta in
2004), Google Docs (launched in 2006), and handsets using its Android
mobile operating system (launched in 2008), none of its businesses
outside of being a search engine were contributing meaningfully to
Google’s business performance at the time. As a result, Google was
extraordinarily dependent on its search-driven advertising revenue.
Brian was relatively free to choose his own areas of focus. He was
encouraged to pursue projects that were in line with the general
priorities of the organization without having to receive approval
from senior executives. In Brian’s case, these projects were heavily
inﬂuenced by his own specialization in open-source software develop-
ment. Rooted in the earliest days of the personal computer revolution,
open-source development involves making the computer program
code freely and publically available. This is in sharp contrast to
“closed-source” development, in which a programmer or company
keeps its software code proprietary and conﬁdential. Open-source
software has demonstrated wide-ranging beneﬁts and is now a mainstay
of most modern computing platforms and the Internet as a whole. And
it was these principles of open-source development—most notably
ideas of openness and data portability—that guided Brian’s thinking:
When I started at Google, it was a much smaller company. It was just me and
a product manager talking about things we could do in Chicago because we
were doing open-source stuff here and it was just a few of us. We bandied
about this idea about making it easier for people to leave Google—something
our CEO was talking publically about. I thought to myself that this felt like
the right thing to do for our users and for us long term—people don’t use

Google Search because they’re locked into it or because their data is stuck in it;
they use it because it’s the best thing for them. Since we were talking about
how our users could leave, I thought, “Let’s make sure that we really are
making it easy for them to leave.” So I talked to one vice president and said I
wanted to do this, and he said sure, hire a half-dozen engineers and see what
you can do.10
From these initial conversations, Brian ended up exploring how
Google’s products could be modiﬁed to make it easier for users to take
their data out of Google if they wanted to stop using the company’s
services. In doing so, he ended up creating an initiative and product
that caught the interest of Google CEO Eric Schmidt and became a
key strategic project for the entire company.
At the time, Google was facing growing attention due to its
dominant position in Internet searching. Schmidt was keen to dem-
onstrate to regulators around the world that Google wasn’t using its
position in searching as an unfair competitive advantage. The stakes
were arguably quite high. Microsoft had come under similar scrutiny
in the mid-1990s. Like Google’s search engine, Microsoft’s Windows
operating system was extraordinarily dominant. Microsoft used that
market dominance to extend their leadership into other product
categories, such as Internet browser software. In November 2001,
the company settled with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to
a ﬁve-year monitoring program that severely regulated the company’s
business practices. Having observed the impact that the ruling had on
Microsoft’s business, Schmidt wanted to avoid a similar fate. In short,
how could Google demonstrate to users and to governments around
the world that it was not a monopoly in spite of controlling over 65
percent of the global market for Web search?
At the same time, Brian’s efforts around data portability were
gaining traction. “We sort of quietly crept from project to project and
spoke with managers around the company,” Brian explained. “Have
you ever thought about making it easy for users to export?” he would
ask. Most had indeed considered the issue, but few had taken any

action. It wasn’t the kind of feature that was considered a priority
during the beginning phases of a project when building core features
and assessing user reactions were critical to success. In these cases, the
teams were rarely resistant to the idea and were very open to Brian’s
offer to help. They would share resources and assist in building out the
necessary features that would let users remove their data. “We’d just
go to each product, and the teams would let us do code reviews and
work with them on user interfaces,” Brian said.
The team took a mission-like zeal in its efforts, working within the
organization and its formal decision-making structure while also
operating as a populist band of coders sometimes working against
the status quo. At one point in 2007, they decided to label themselves
the Data Liberation Front—a reference to a sketch in the Monty
Python ﬁlm Life of Brian. The title reﬂected the balance of creativity
and disruption that the team brought to ﬁghting the corporate mind-
set and behavior that they didn’t want Google to fall prey to. This
helped fuel the team’s sense of purpose but also helped team members
attract like-minded colleagues. “I have people who want to come to
work on my team all the time because they love this idea.”
This isn’t to say there wasn’t resistance. At times Brian’s peers or
managementwouldquestionthevalue ofwhat they weredoing.“Isthis
really important to do?” a group supervisor might ask. “I want to put
your head count on something else.” Brian was clever in navigating
these challenges: “I would sort of sneak around, and we went from
different org to different org for a while until we ﬁnally found a home
within security, where we’ve been for years now with a very supportive
manager who is the Vice President of Security.” From this, Brian
learned to be savvy about who to seek out for necessary permission, and
when to ask—and not to ask—for that sponsorship.
For me, getting support is like being a lawyer in the courtroom. I don’t want
to ask somebody permission unless I know the answer they’re going to give
me. So I try to ﬁnd the right person who will give me permission, make sure I
know they’re going to say yes, and then I launch it. I always look for getting
152

the minimum required permission. I don’t try to cover all my bases, because
the more people you ask, eventually you’ll ﬁnd someone who will say no. But
if you do the right thing for the company, and if you are empowered and you
know how far you can go, you can get just enough permission to get it
done . . . and then stop asking.
Brian got the support he needed to get started, while also managing
risks that could derail the team.
He also used annual off-site meetings to reﬂect on what the team
had accomplished and what more they might do. These were free-
ﬂowing sessions where he challenged the team to think creatively.
“Let’s take 10 minutes to ﬁgure out the worst stuff we could do to our
users,” Brian would start off. Working to generate lists of all the ways
that Google could intentionally or unintentionally harm users and
lock them into products, Brian then had the team brainstorm all the
ways they could help the company avoid those risks. From one of
these sessions, the team suggested an integrated product that would let
users get their data from every Google product with just one click.
“That sounds insane,” Brian reacted. “Let’s do it.”
From there, the team set out to make their idea a reality. Leading
the team, Brian played the role of coach and supporter. He provided
very little direction to the engineers, who had most of the technical
expertise and product insight to do the “heavy lifting.” Instead, he
spent his time making connections within the organization on their
behalf. “Mostly, it was just me keeping out of their way and then
helping them ﬁgure out how to launch it. What’s the best time?
What’s the best product to start with? What are the right places?
Really, what’s the easiest way to get something launched . . . that
requires knowing the right people.”
While the idea the team had come up with was big, they started
working on it in modest ways. “I started out small and quietly because
I didn’t know how the company would react,” Brian recalled. “I’m
going to make it easier for people to leave, but I don’t want to get
ﬁred.” Brian was pleased to ﬁnd that most people in the company

loved the idea, both at the very top as well as among rank-and-ﬁle
engineers. Indeed, when CEO Eric Schmidt found out about the
project, he was truly excited—why weren’t they talking to more
people about it? Having spoken publically about the importance of
consumer choice, Schmidt ﬁnally had a concrete way to demonstrate
the lengths to which Google would go to make good on that
principle. Endorsed as a corporate priority, Brian and the team
accelerated their efforts.
On June 28, 2011, the team launched Google Takeout. Takeout
was a single Web page that allowed users of Google products to export
personal information such as their contacts or photos from a variety of
Google services. By using industry-standard ﬁle formats, Takeout
enabled the user to switch services and take their data to a different
online provider other than Google.
The product launched with support for ﬁve services. While the
initial list was modest and didn’t include some of Google’s most
popular products, it marked an important milestone for the company
and the team. The team now had a formal product to call their own—
a validation of relevance in both the hierarchy and vernacular of
Google’s culture—and with it they gained a way to more clearly
designate what it meant for other product owners to align themselves
with the team’s efforts. In black-and-white terms, other products
either included Google Takeout integration or they did not. This gave
Brian more leverage, and he found that teams were eager to ﬁnd out
how they could be supportive. Additional products came rapidly, and
the momentum they built culminated with the integration of two of
Google’s largest services—YouTube and Gmail—in 2012 and 2013,
respectively.
As they made progress, Brian also began working more directly
with Google’s PR and policy teams. The ease with which Takeout
allowed users to export their data, along with the simplicity of having a
single point of access, helped colleagues in both areas describe how
Google acted in ways that were consistent with its guiding philosophy.
In effect, Brian made it easier for them to do their jobs. In doing so,
154

3GC03

2:26:33
Page 155
they became allies in the common causes they were all working
toward. By highlighting Takeout in both internal and external
messaging, the policy team and PR leadership further validated the
work the team had done.
Understanding Brian’s Success
Reﬂecting on the project, Brian articulates how the team operated
within Google over the years to ﬁrst deﬁne and later build momentum
for their strategy. “Here we are seven years later, and now people
come to me asking how they can do it. We have documentation, they
integrate it into their product, and we conduct a review when they are
done. Long term it’s been a cultural change in the company, which has
been really exciting.”
Much of the change can be traced to Brian’s use of collaborative
leadership. He demonstrated all ﬁve key actions we introduced in
Chapter 2, including building relationships, listening, ﬁnding com-
mon interests, sharing power, and demonstrating trust. The changes
that the team initially made to existing products, the creation of
Google Takeout, and the support that Brian gained from senior
executives all reﬂect a focus on collaboration. Indeed, it’s unlikely
that many of these results would have been possible had he chosen a
less collaborative approach.
Looking more closely at what enabled the team’s success, Brian
was particularly savvy about gaining support. As he worked within the
organization, Brian was thoughtful about whom he approached and
how he worked with them. He used his network to understand the
priorities and ideas of other Googlers, striking partnerships with those
with whom he had common interests. The PR and policy teams were
two excellent examples. They had strong motivation to support
Brian’s goals, as they gave legitimacy to their priorities around how
Google wanted to treat its users, and given Brian’s prior success in
helping product owners, he offered them a proven recipe for success.

Page 156
This was particularly important given Google’s culture, where a focus
on corporate compliance wasn’t likely to create the kind of behavior
they might want:
I don’t know how it works at other companies, but Google is half engineers.
Most engineers are brilliant creative types and rather antiauthoritarian. They
do not respond well to someone hitting them with a stick. If someone comes in
and says, “You’re going to have to comply with this,” they’re going to say,
“Yeah, whatever.” That may work in the short term, but they will hate you
for it; they’re not going to respect you. But the real problem is it’s expensive
to hit people with a stick. You’re spending someone’s authority above you—
a senior vice president or someone. Then when you’ve spent that authority,
you have to go back and get more—a new initiative or more people with more
sticks. You end up feeding this really cancerous growth of enforcers. Instead,
the better way is to get people to buy in, show them why this is important,
and then make it easy for them. I like to say, “speak softly and carry a large
engineering team.” If we really have to get this done, it’s a lot easier if you’re
looking three-quarters out rather than this quarter because people are planned
up for the hour already. So, if we need to get this done but we know everyone
is busy, we can talk to them about reasonable time frames and then also
provide an engineering team that has some infrastructure and some tools that
will enable you to do very, very little work, or even none in some cases. We
have all this documentation, we have some sample code, and if you have any
questions, just ask our engineering team. And what we found is that with
most teams, that just goes a long way.
In taking this approach, Brian shows the power of building on the
intersection of common interests. In the end, Takeout was a solution
that met the needs of multiple stakeholders, providing a showcase for
Schmidt regarding Google’s good-faith efforts to avoid consumer
lock-in, providing a process for policy leaders to gain support from
engineering teams without using the stick of compliance, and giving
product owners an easy way to do right by their users with less effort
than it would have taken for them to do so on their own. By treating
user’s data in an open way that emphasized portability, Google was
156

able to make it easy for customers to switch between the services of
multiple companies; it embraced principles that maintained and
enhanced the Internet’s core elements of interoperability; and it
demonstrated Google’s desire to be a “good actor” competitively.
“For me, a lot of it comes down to ﬁnding the intersection—what’s
right for Google as a company, what’s right for the Internet, and
what’s right for our users. It’s a consumer-friendly way of doing
product,” says Brian.
Wrap-Up
The cases of Indiegogo, P&G’s merger with Gillette, Design for
America, and Google Takeout provide real-world examples of leaders
who demonstrate each of the four strategic leadership types. They
bring those types to life, applying the relevant key actions of each type
while also showing some of the challenges that go along with doing so
effectively.
In our next chapter, we will turn our attention to how a leader
makes choices regarding how to lead. Each of our four leadership
types are options—available ways to lead. Effective leaders will
choose the approach best suited to the requirements of the situation
and to their own personal leadership style. We’ll explore this by
returning to the two fundamental leadership choices we introduced
earlier: how to gain insight and how to drive change.

Applying Strategic
Leadership
Up to this point, we have focused on establishing a clear under-
standing of what strategic leadership is. We looked at existing views
regarding both leadership and strategic thinking, reviewing the most
signiﬁcant concepts and theories that exist today. We explored the
intersection of those two topics, introducing our own deﬁnition of
strategic leadership as the application of those concepts to ﬁnd the
most effective manner in a given situation to gain insight and drive
change. We deﬁned the four types of strategic leadership, and we
described each of them based on our conversations with hundreds of
leaders. We used four speciﬁc leaders to bring these best practices to
life. With that as background, we now turn our attention to the matter
of putting all of this to work. How can individuals apply these
principles of strategic leadership to get results?
159

3GC04

Page 160
We will address this by returning to the two questions we
introduced in Chapter 2, highlighting the primary decisions that
every leader must make in how they choose to approach their work:
■
How will you gain strategic insight?
■
How will you drive strategic change?
The ﬁrst question will inform where you focus in order to identify
the best direction to go. The second question will determine the
principles used when deciding how to proceed. We will now explore
these questions, one at a time.
Gaining Strategic Insight
Too often, the decision regarding where one gains insight isn’t a
decision at all. Insight can function in ways that often obscure its
origins. It might be masked in the trappings of conventional wisdom,
thus codiﬁed and institutionalized in a way that prevents most people
from seeing it for the novel idea that it once was. As the old
management tale goes, the beneﬁts of the buggy whip were a
revolutionary insight right up until the automobile rendered it
obsolete. Insight can also be shrouded in mystery, being portrayed
as the lightning bolt that strikes without warning. Just as Benjamin
Franklin was supposedly struck with his understanding of the power to
harness electricity, some of the most impactful insights in history are
too often presented as one-time occurrences that can’t possibly be
anticipated or repeated.
We advocate for the far more utilitarian view, which we intro-
duced in Chapter 2. Insight can be gained through two simple ways:
(1) through process, with an emphasis on a structured and rigorous
review of inputs and factors, or (2) through mindful experience,
emerging from relevant and meaningful knowledge that allows one to
gain useful observations drawn out from ﬁrsthand experience. The
four stories we reviewed in the prior chapter bring these options to
160

life. Two of our examples relied on clearly deﬁned structure and
process to surface the opportunity:
■
At P&G, José relied heavily on process. He established and
followed a series of management routines that provided him
the data he needed to see patterns and choose the way forward.
■
At Google, Brian drew from a structure of existing values,
corporate priorities, and Google products to see his opportunity.
While he brought his own experience and values that certainly
informed his perspective, those gained meaning and speciﬁcity as
Brian engaged in the formal organization and its well-structured
environment of roles, tools, and processes.
Our other two examples highlight the value of experience and
personal reﬂection as the root of insight:
■
The Indiegogo founders each had direct experience with fund-
raising that informed their view of capital markets. It was this
personal, shared experience that helped them see the opportunity
that became their crowdfunding platform.
■
In creating Design for America, Liz drew from her personal
experience developing children’s toys to form her views of the
design process and design education. Furthermore, she empow-
ered her students to gain similar insights by structuring the
ecosystem that gave them a chance to form their own observa-
tion-driven discoveries.
These four stories demystify how strategic insight really happens.
They illustrate the difference between process-driven and experience-
driven insight, and they showcase actions that can be applied in other
contexts and learned by other people. Indeed, just as each of our
stories highlight a repeatable approach, numerous programs and best
practices have emerged to effectively produce insight through either
process or experience.
Process-based systems have gained increasing sophistication as
technology has led to improvements in both data collection and

analysis. As one example, Walmart has developed sophisticated man-
agement information systems that allow them to gain real-time
insights into both short-term and long-term trends. They can monitor
the day-to-day performance of their retail shelves around the world
while they harvest long-term patterns that inform everything from
store openings to the mix of products they offer. This trend will
undoubtedly accelerate, as organizations both large and small gain
access to tools that allow them to do similar, sophisticated analysis of
large amounts of data and identify patterns that only have been seen
through the assistance of technology.
Experience-based insight has received similar attention. In the
1970s, as Hewlett-Packard led the earliest stages of the computer
revolution, its managers were encouraged to learn not from reports
or from time spent in management meetings but, rather, through
“management by walking around.”1 This time out in the ﬁeld with
engineers and customers gave them the real-world data they needed to
see and seize opportunities in the rapidly evolving states of that
emerging industry. Similarly, many organizations now use rigorous,
systematic rotations of employees to move individuals between key
roles that build up the working knowledge of multiple industries or
product categories. This accumulated ﬁrsthand experience makes them
better at making connections and uncovering new opportunities.
These experiences become valuable once they are combined with
activities that encourage a leader to draw out the patterns and meaning.
Just like Brian used periodic retreats with his team at Google to prompt
them to reﬂect, the commute home from work can become productive
time for a leader who uses it to digest the activities of the day and decide
what was the most interesting or important thing they discovered.
Identifying the Right Approach
The key to becoming more effective at gaining strategic insight is to
ﬁrst decide how to go about it. To apply any of these techniques, we
162
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC04
03/10/2015
2:34:28
Page 163
suggest starting with a set of simple questions that we have found to
work with our clients, our students, and in our own experience
developing strategies. The questions focus on the environmental
factors that we ﬁnd often provide cues to the most appropriate
approach in a given situation:
1. What has historically been done? History can be both valuable and
a constraint. Determine what the default or most common
approach has been in the past, what was good about it, and
what unintended consequences it might be producing.
2. What is the state of the industry, and what’s normally done? We
often ﬁnd that industries come with de facto standards and
practices that end up driving insight. This mainstream view is
often self-reinforcing, as leaders and organizations benchmark
with each other to ﬁnd best practices. These best practices can
be useful, but they can also create an industry-wide monoculture
that locks in the current view and locks out other ideas.
3. What role is personal experience playing today, and what else
could it provide? Identify ways to draw fresh insight from past
experience. If your experience proves to be limiting, look for ways
to gain new insights from a change to your routine. Spend more
time with customers, engineers, or the stakeholders you ﬁnd most
challenging.
4. What is the most relevant data, and how do you manage it?
Organizations and leaders don’t need to have the resources and
technologies of Walmart to get useful data. Finding and prioritiz-
ing meaningful data can be more important than gathering lots of
it. Audit the current approach to take an objective look and to
explore new opportunities.
5. What would other relevant stakeholders consider credible? The
status quo shouldn’t be a limitation, but any new approach has to
be valid. Use trusted colleagues and the most challenging devil’s
advocate to evaluate what could be done differently.
By considering these questions and issues, you’ll be better prepared
to anticipate the conditions that might make either process-driven or

Page 164
experience-driven techniques a more effective method for developing
insights. You may also ﬁnd creative ways to integrate the two.
Driving Strategic Change
Deciding how to most effectively drive change has received consid-
erably more attention than the matter of how one gains insight. The
business shelf of any bookstore will have at least a few books on
the topic of change. This reﬂects heightened general awareness on the
topic, as the complexities of both our society and organizations have
made large-scale change both more feasible and more challenging.
Most often, contemporary thought leaders make a compelling case for
an increasingly inclusive approach to change. Indeed, our colleagues at
Northwestern teach an excellent course on “Designing Sustainable
Strategic Change,” in which students are taught how to involve
stakeholders, not just in planning the change, but also in designing the
very change itself.
For all the modern attention that stakeholder participation has
gained, it’s important to remember that there remains a choice to be
made by leaders seeking to drive strategic change. Leaders have the
choice to (1) provide direction, engaging stakeholders in a largely one-
way process that deﬁnes the strategy and change as determined by the
individual leader, or (2) create participation, deﬁning processes that
involve the contributions of others in what a given change should look
like and how it should be managed. To clarify this choice, we’ll again
turn to our four stories to illustrate each option. We see leaders
providing direction when driving change in two of our cases:
■
At Indiegogo, the cofounders took speciﬁc action to own and
protect their vision. They had a very clear sense of what success
looked like, and they provided clear guidance on what the
boundaries were as their organization grew. Their focus on
organizational alignment was evident in their emphasis on hiring,
164
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC04
03/10/2015
2:34:28
Page 165
with a clear focus on values and organizational ﬁt. While they
took real actions to empower their team, they were quick to act if
an individual or idea didn’t ﬁt their view of what success looked
like.
■
At P&G, José dictated both the expectations and the terms of
engagement for most stakeholders. One can imagine there was
little question of what change was expected and the role each
person needed to play in making it happen. The beneﬁts of
adherence to this view, including the inherent confusion that can
come from deviation and competing priorities during a complex
merger, gave José the mandate and inﬂuence he needed to get the
intended results.
In contrast, we see the leaders in our other two cases take a very
different and decidedly more participative approach to their respective
change agendas:
■
At Design for America, Liz involved her students in every aspect
of creating the organization. She drew speciﬁc attention to this in
our discussions, highlighting the importance of student ownership
for the mission and vision if the organization were to succeed.
Indeed, an early attempt to “tell” students what would happen fell
ﬂat and left a lasting impression on her and how she decided to
lead.
■
At Google, Brian had little choice but to involve others in how he
deﬁned and approached change. Without direct authority, Brian
had to win over his fellow product owners to the merits and
importance of data portability. Likewise, the antiauthoritarian
culture among engineers made it unlikely that Brian could have
been as directive with his own team as José was able to be in a
different context and organizational culture.
These four stories show different ways that leaders can drive
change. They each focus on different things and take different actions.
Importantly, they succeed because of a strong ﬁt between the situation
they were in and the approach they chose.

The directive approach to change has a long history—indeed,
CEOs, politicians, and even parents have been telling other people
what to do for centuries. What has always distinguished good
techniques from bad ones is appreciating and understanding what
it takes to direct change effectively. As evident in all our case studies,
an effective approach involves much more than just telling people
what to do. These principles aren’t all new—indeed, both Niccolò
Machiavelli and Dale Carnegie provided relevant insight into the
language of their times—but today the ﬁelds of social and individual
psychology provide increasingly rich insights into the nature of human
and organizational behavior. Incentives can be used to drive change at
both the individual and the organizational level, and tools like
inﬂuence plans and gamiﬁcation systems exist to direct and motivate
stakeholder change at scale.
The participative approach to change can be seen as challenging
some of the traditional ideas regarding strategy execution. Most of the
popularliteratureonstrategicmanagementtreatsstrategyformationand
strategy execution sequentially. A strategic position is determined, and
the organization is then mobilized to action. A truly participative
approach to driving strategic change blurs this distinction. Simply
opening up matters of implementation rarely achieves the level of
stakeholder involvement that can qualify as true participation. This
technique has become common practice in many projects associated
with public spaces. In determining the best use or design for a neglected
city park, architects and city planners will now typically create vehicles
forcommunitymemberstocontributeideas orreactions that informthe
design process. These methods accelerate buy-in and increase stake-
holder commitment, and can even contribute to a better solution.
Identifying the Right Approach
Our four stories in Chapter 3 legitimize both of the ways that one
can drive change. While participative approaches may receive more
166
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC04
03/10/2015
2:34:28
Page 167
attention, they aren’t always the best approach. Likewise, there isn’t
anything inherently good or bad about taking a directive approach.
The key to becoming more effective at driving change is selecting an
approach best suited to the situation. We suggest several questions
when considering the choice at hand:
1. What needs to be accomplished? The nature of the change itself—
the goal or solution in question—can often deﬁne opportunities
and constraints. The degree to which the solution is ﬂexible can
deﬁne the opportunity to involve stakeholders. We often ﬁnd it
helpful to challenge the ﬁrst answer we get to this question, as
there are often more options than are initially perceived.
2. How inﬂuential are stakeholders, and how much are they needed?
The ability of key stakeholders to enable or block a given strategy
can provide a clear mandate to ensure they are involved and
supportive. Likewise, sometimes an inclusive approach can end up
wasting energy on constituents who have little inﬂuence.
3. What are the available means of motivating others? In some
contexts, incentives and controls can be useful. In other cases,
there may be practical limits on the available tools to reward or
deter particular behavior.
4. To what degree does complexity play a role, and how? In a world
with increasing connections enabled by communication and
technology, complexity can’t be ignored. Considering the role
that dependencies (inter and intra) might play in a given change
can surface issues earlier so that they can be managed accordingly.
5. What role does sustainability play in achieving the desired results?
Some strategies are time bound, and thus the change to be
managed can be time bound. At other times, it’s important for
a given change to be sustained. In those cases, determining the
degree to which sustaining measures need to be self-sufﬁcient can
clarify the need for a participatory approach.
Driving change can be a critical and massive undertaking. These
ﬁve questions can surface some of the issues that should be considered
when embarking on the journey to execute strategy.

Integrating the Four Types
Throughout most of this book, we’ve emphasized the differences
between the four types of strategic leadership. Indeed, they are
distinct. Nobody would mistake Steve Jobs for an incubating
leader—everyone he engaged with was helping him with his vision,
whether they intended to or not. That said, in practice the four types
of strategic leadership should be considered points of emphasis and not
mutually exclusive. Many leaders integrate one or more types. They
may use a different approach when working with a given stake-
holder—taking a participative approach to stakeholders when they
can have a meaningful impact on outcomes, while being more
directive with stakeholders that have less inﬂuence. They may also
use a different type of leadership over the course of many phases
within a given project. We see GE taking a more participative
approach to its workforce over the decades as the problems it focuses
on come to require very different types of solutions.
To illustrate this in action, we’ll use a ﬁnal case to highlight the
integrated application of strategic leadership that we often see. We’ve
selected a case that highlights some of the earliest stages of strategic
leadership in action. It’s the story of an individual taking the ﬁrst steps
to form a new organization and how he navigated the initial phases of
his work. It’s also an excellent example that highlights the four
strategic leadership types as he makes choices related to both the
formation (i.e., gaining insight) and execution (i.e., driving change) of
his strategy.
Todd Connor and The Bunker: A Conscious Approach to Strategic
Leadership
Todd Connor had already had a wide-ranging career when he decided
to start The Bunker. He joined the U.S. Navy immediately after
ﬁnishing college, serving as a navigator on the guided missile cruiser

USS Bunker Hill. He worked in state government as an investigator for
the Illinois inspector general, and in private industry, in a number of
general management and consulting roles. He also spent two and a half
years working in education, where he was executive director of the six
military high schools operated by the City of Chicago. In March 2014,
he decided to change direction and try his hand at building his own
organization—a nonproﬁt designed to help military veterans start their
own small businesses.
Todd saw the opportunity through a combination of his prior
professional experience and his participation in the Chicago business
community:
First it begins with my own identity. I’m a veteran who has done things in the
public sector. I’ve done things in the private sector, and I was in the process of
launching a startup business. I’m at the intersection of a number of
constituencies. I also took a diagnostic view of the larger landscape. Right
now, there are hundreds of thousands of troops coming off of active duty.
There is a huge corporate push to address veterans’ issues. There is a huge
political desire to speak to solutions for veterans. And then I also saw that in
the veteran landscape, there’s some disorganization. A lot of traditional
organizations are being pushed to do nontraditional things. So, I saw these
three things: (1) a huge constituency that was wanting to help veterans, (2) a
traditional veteran service landscape that was ripe for a new organization, and
(3) myself at the unique intersection of these things, where either I or
somebody like me could pull together a solution to speciﬁcally help veteran-
owned companies.2
With this insight, Todd went about exploring how best to capitalize
on the opportunity.
He had several assets due to his situation and experience, including
extremely high credibility with many important stakeholders. His
service in the military made him credible with veterans, his time in the
public sector helped him understand the interests of politicians, and his
private-sector experience made him trustworthy to businesses used
to seeing many requests for support. So he began talking with these

Page 170
diverse groups of stakeholders to better gauge the opportunity and
their interest in collaborating. Todd quickly saw that raising thought-
ful questions with the various stakeholders built his credibility even
further. “The more conversations I had that were exploratory,” he
found, “the more I was given the license to go and create something.”
He decided to go ﬁrst to 1871, a nonproﬁt coworking space built
to serve the Chicagoland entrepreneurial community. Located in
Chicago’s Merchandise Mart—famous for being the largest building
in the world when it opened in 1930—1871 had recently become a
nerve center of entrepreneurial activity for the region after private-
sector leaders and Chicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, launched it in
2012. More recently, the leadership of 1871 had started talking
publicly about making additional efforts to diversify the constituencies
it served and created a program focused on women in technology that
launched earlier that same year. They were evaluating additional ideas
at the time that Todd started his own investigation.
Seeing the opportunity come into focus, Todd put serious
thought into how to differentiate his idea and himself within a
very crowded space. Veterans’ issues are high proﬁle, and there are
countless organizations already working to meet their needs. Todd
saw the challenges, but he also saw the need to move quickly:
If we were going to create a veteran-owned business incubator in Chicago,
there would be a ﬁrst-mover advantage to doing that. 1871 is the one place
where this kind of stuff happens at scale, and so if we were going to do
something, it would have to be there. And there weren’t going to be two
veteran incubators. I knew that. I also knew that 1871 wanted to do
something for veterans, and what they needed was a packaged solution that
they could just say “yes” to. So it was through conversations with them where
I was able to say, “Look, I think I have your solution, and it’s called The
Bunker, and here’s how it will work.”
Todd got the response he was hoping for. Leadership at 1871 saw
the credibility and inﬂuence that Todd could bring, and they saw clear
170

Page 171
alignment in their mutual interests. With one partner secured, Todd
looked to further strengthen his position:
My instinct on this was that the ﬁrst phase was to ask, “How can we get
people on record saying that this was the thing they were going to support?”
And so we looked for an opportunity. That opportunity I saw was a
luncheon, which was being hosted with the Pat Tillman Foundation.
They’re a great organization focused on veterans’ issues, and the mayor
of Chicago was scheduled to come speak. The Pat Tillman Foundation
luncheon was a perfect opportunity, with a strong organization where we
could wrap into this as a press announcement that would seal the reality of
what could be happening.
Todd approached representatives from each organization, and
they were eager to support the announcement. On June 27, 2014,
Mayor Emanuel and 1871 CEO Howard Tullman announced The
Bunker at the luncheon. Several other inﬂuential Chicago leaders
were in attendance, and Illinois governor Pat Quinn voiced his
support in a statement issued for the event. The luncheon generated
press coverage in major local news outlets, solidifying Todd’s role as an
inﬂuential Chicago connection for those looking to engage with the
veteran community.
With his credibility established, Todd began a new phase of the
work. “The announcement was a critical moment, and it gave us
license to proceed,” Todd reﬂected. “The plan actually really came
together afterwards.” Todd began to focus on preparing the organi-
zation to start delivering on its promise. That started with forming the
initial team that would work with him to create The Bunker. He
approached two colleagues whom he knew and who had already
spent some time with him on related efforts. The ﬁrst was Brandon
Bodor, executive director of the Illinois Commission on Volunteer-
ism and Community Service and an appointee of the governor. The
second was Thomas Day, a freelance journalist who had written on
veteran affairs. Both were fellow veterans.

Their work together started out informally, with Todd focused
mostly on getting them excited about being involved. “It was on the
basis that we were going to work together and build something really
cool—and very important—together,” Todd explained. “We’re
lucky to be in this moment when we have the license to do this,
but it’s up to us to prove that we can do it.” As the momentum and
work increased, they did talk about the implications, but they didn’t
start with roles. “It was early, so I was asking for their help without
being able to pay them for their time. So I approached them, asking
for help, but with the promise that if and when we were able to raise
money, they would start getting paid.” Todd was also mindful of the
interests and motivations of each of his prospective partners. Brandon
was ﬁnishing up business school and was keen on making a transition
outside of government. “I also saw in Brandon an asset, which is all
these political relationships and a deep understanding of the veteran
service community, which I didn’t have. He knows veteran politics in
a way that I don’t.” Likewise, as a writer, Tom also ﬁt a key need for
the team. Tom had experience covering veterans’ affairs as a journalist.
Given that, he had all the right skills needed to help the organization
with a major task ahead—developing a communications campaign.
With the team established and initial tasks assigned, the three of
them worked together to start building momentum for the organiza-
tion. They saw what they wanted The Bunker to become, but they
faced a challenge in navigating the interdependent nature of several
key parts of the plan. While they could volunteer their own time, they
also needed a combination of corporate funding and participating
entrepreneurs to get off the ground. Todd took on the task of
determining how to deﬁne the right sequence.
It was all these dominos that had to fall. The politicians and inﬂuential
advocates saying this was going to happen was the ﬁrst domino, giving us
some credibility to go to the market and show that this was real. The second
domino was getting companies announced as moving into The Bunker—that
172

could begin a string of early press and e-mail announcements so that our
stakeholders would see the momentum. And third, we had to get our ﬁrst
big corporate sponsor. We needed that ﬁrst gift, because the ﬁrst gift
created inevitability for the second gift, and for the third gift, and for the
fourth gift.
Having deﬁned the logical sequence, Todd and the team set to
work identifying the ﬁrst participating entrepreneurs. Todd had a clear
idea of what he was looking for: early stage companies that were still
getting started but were far enough along to have their own credibility.
The Bunker needed these initial companies as much as they needed
The Bunker. Todd approached them accordingly. “Behind the scenes,
I was going to individual veterans and appealing to them on the basis of
joining this platform and helping us build something great.”
One of those veteran-owned companies was RideScout, creators
of a mobile app that helped users make transportation decisions.
RideScout had already seen some initial success with positive public
press and traction with a user base. Todd saw the opportunity to help
RideScout by connecting them with the public exposure he had
started to achieve, but he was also transparent with them. “Frankly, I
needed them as much as they needed us. I made the appeal to them in
part as fellow veterans based on the chance to help the overall veteran
community.” After understanding what Todd and his team were
trying to do, RideScout joined up. Todd announced RideScout as the
ﬁrst company to join The Bunker. Three weeks later, RideScout was
acquired by automaker Daimler.
The success of RideScout gave additional attention and credibility
to The Bunker, and shortly thereafter Todd secured their ﬁrst
corporate sponsor. Once Todd and the team were able to get traction
with each of these three components—external validation, veteran
participation, and corporate sponsorship—they became mutually
reinforcing. In the next several weeks, 19 veteran-owned companies
agreed to participate in the launch of The Bunker.

173

Page 174
The Bunker’s ﬁrst entrepreneur cohort met together for a kickoff
event on November 1, 2014. Todd, his team, and 38 founders from
the 19 veteran-owned companies spent the day discussing their
experiences navigating the challenges of starting a business. Todd
also shared additional news that weekend: veteran entrepreneurs and
government ofﬁcials in several other cities had contacted him. They
were eager to understand how The Bunker worked and how they
might do something similar. Indeed, six cities were already making
plans to start their own Bunker programs, which Todd planned to
announce at another luncheon later that month.
During the retreat, spirits were high. The group was drawing on
the energy of their potential, both from their individual business plans
and the collective opportunity that lay ahead for the group. The
Bunker’s imminent national expansion added to the feeling of
momentum. Underlying this, their quickly developing bonds were
reinforced by a kinship born of their shared military service. The
excitement was palpable. In fact, it was easy to forget that six months
earlier, The Bunker had only been an idea.
For all of its initial success and its rapid rise to prominence, the
ultimate success of The Bunker is by no means assured. As they move
forward, Todd and the team he has assembled expect to face the full
range of highs and lows. Challenges will no doubt slow them down
and complicate their ambitious plans. Even so, the groundwork they
have established is extremely promising. The infrastructure has come
together, and, even more importantly, the level of commitment of the
organization’s members—both to The Bunker and to each other—is
remarkable.
Deconstructing Todd’s Approach
Todd’s work on The Bunker is an excellent example of strategic
leadership in action. It highlights many of the concepts we’ve intro-
duced in this book and how they can be effectively applied at the very
174
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC04
03/10/2015
2:34:29
Page 175
earliest stages of a new initiative. It also provides insight into the very
speciﬁc and practical things that a strategic leader must do to develop
insight and drive strategic change.
Notably, Todd was very self-conscious about his strategies regard-
ing leadership. He approached situations with a speciﬁc idea of what
he wanted to accomplish and, importantly, how best to accomplish it.
This was evident in his approach to syndicating his initial idea. Todd
didn’t directly advocate for himself as the best person to address
veteran employment issues. Rather, he made himself the logical
candidate by the way in which he created speciﬁc conversations
and handled himself in those conversations. He collaborated with
other relevant stakeholders, ﬁnding mutually beneﬁcial opportunities
for partnership that addressed the main issues he needed to navigate as
he built up the credibility and momentum he needed to get The
Bunker off the ground. In those moments, we see him exercising
many of the actions common in collaborative leadership. In turn, as he
gained legitimacy with stakeholders, he then made a conscious effort
to change his approach. As the launch of The Bunker became more
certain, he put more effort into deﬁning the speciﬁcs of what it could
become and used those speciﬁcs in a message to attract and motivate
his partners, the 19 veteran-owned companies, and the interested
parties he began speaking with in other cities. In these scenarios, he
demonstrated many aspects of visionary leadership necessary to artic-
ulate the opportunity and motivate others to join him. In these and
other situations, Todd provides an excellent example of how it is often
possible and indeed necessary to intentionally use and integrate all four
types of strategic leadership over time.
Last, it’s worth calling out the role that tenacity and courage
played in this story. At many points along the way, there was nothing
easy or even clear about the work that needed to be done. Looking
back, Todd recalls when, early in the spring, he selected November 1
for a targeted launch. At the time, it felt very arbitrary, and indeed it
was. In spite of that, it’s clear that the very act of setting a date helped
drive focus and urgency. He created these milestones for his own sake,
Applying Strategic Leadership
175

3GC04

Page 176
but he also used them effectively to motivate and inﬂuence others. “I
always think about forcing mechanisms. The launch deadline created a
clear milestone and a forced decision—sponsors and entrepreneurs
needed to decide if they were on board.” Todd was highly intentional
about how and when to create these forced choices. “How do you
create a sense of urgency? You create moments where you round
people up into consensus,” he observed. By determining the right
times to be deﬁnitive, he was able to create enough structure to make
it easy and clear for others to see how they could participate and why
they should. Todd strongly emphasized this in one of our discussions,
noting, “I think a leader’s job is to lay down and create structure where
one doesn’t exist.” We see this as an excellent guiding principle for
much of what it takes to effectively apply our principles of strategic
leadership.
Integration and Authenticity
In practice, strategy formation and strategy execution are highly
interdependent. It’s rarely possible to deﬁne strategy in absence of
considering what execution will require. Likewise, the four types of
strategic leadership invariably overlap, intersect, and reinforce each
other when applied to the messy nature of real life. It’s the leader’s
challenge to reconcile and integrate them in a meaningful way. This
involves reading the situation and context for cues, but it’s also a
matter of personal discretion. The leaders we’ve observed who
achieve the greatest impact and develop the widest followership
demonstrate a type of personal integrity that reﬂects a strong and
clear sense of themselves. They know who they are, and they show up
that way consistently. They adapt in ways that make sense to the
situation, but they don’t do things that undermine their own credi-
bility. While sometimes the concepts and distinctions that authors
make in books like this can feel artiﬁcial—and indeed they are—they
call out meaningful differences. Good leaders understand those
176

Page 177
differences for what they are, and then they integrate that under-
standing into their own beliefs, priorities, and behavior.
In this chapter, we’ve started to address the application of strategic
leadership. We will continue that exploration in the next chapter.
While we’ve raised some of the key choices and considerations
involved in gaining insight and driving strategic change, we’ll now
continue on to identify additional techniques that strategic leaders use
to effectively garner buy-in, commitment, and advocacy.

Garnering Buy-in,
Commitment, and
Advocacy
We have introduced four strategic leadership types, described the
focus and emphasis of each, given examples of how they are best
applied, and illustrated each type with representative cases. Regardless
of the leadership type employed, it is important to recognize the slate
of external forces and internal factors inﬂuencing both short-term and
long-term success. This involves “connecting the dots” to determine
how best to proceed.
Strategic leadership almost always involves continuous improve-
ment and constant adaptation. It involves reﬁning a strategy to take
advantage of emerging opportunities and mitigate prevailing threats.
Such reﬁnement is a requirement and not an option. It ensures that the
strategic intent remains valid and maximizes the positive impact of
activities intended to turn a vision into reality.
Our experience and the conversations we’ve had with others
suggest that the best strategy will still produce suboptimal results if
individuals think and act in isolation. A leader’s success relies on
179

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:26
Page 180
followers—followers willing and able to offer creative ideas and
contribute to the execution of those ideas. A group of people who
are each excellent individually will produce suboptimal results if steps
are not also taken to build a capable and committed team aligned in
their intent, effort, and contribution.
The support of individuals will not occur merely through hap-
penstance. Stakeholders must understand and commit to the vision.
Achieving this commitment is often referred to as change management,
change enablement, or change leadership. An entire industry of consultants
and literature has developed to address this challenge. Rather than
reviewing the multitude of frameworks and models these experts
espouse, we will offer a simple approach to attaining needed buy-in,
commitment, and advocacy.
Attaining Needed Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
Why are buy-in and commitment important? Imagine standing next
to a bar extending between two chairs. The bar is hanging about
18 inches off the ﬂoor. You are asked to jump vertically while standing
next to the bar. The higher you jump, the better. You will be
rewarded if you jump as high as or higher than the bar. How high
might you jump? We have posed this question to numerous col-
leagues, students, and clients. The answer is frequently “I would jump
18 inches.” The answer is seldom “I would jump as high as I possibly
could.” We therefore reframe the question so it becomes, “When
asked to jump, why might a person capable of jumping 20, 24, or
26 inches jump higher than the minimum requirement?” When
asked, our colleagues, students, and clients typically answer in a
somewhat similar way: “I would jump as high as I possibly could
if I knew it would make a difference to the person asking me to jump
and if I cared about the person asking.”
As is suggested in this analogy, individuals being asked to con-
tribute to a cause are typically rewarded for doing so, sometimes
180

2:38:26
Page 181
through personal recognition and sometimes monetarily. When
given an incentive to contribute, they are usually very savvy at
determining the amount of reward they will receive for the amount
of effort they contribute. Most people understand and act in accord-
ance to a social contract; most individuals think and act as required to
the extent that they understand what is expected of them. To the
extent that they think highly of the individual setting the expectation,
they may exert extra effort. To the extent they believe in the mission
or vision they are working toward, they are also likely to exert extra
effort. We consider buy-in and commitment to be of utmost
importance because they encourage individuals to put forth discre-
tionary effort.
We consider advocacy to be equally important. Few leaders can be
successful if they are alone in championing their goals. Ideas—
particularly big ideas—need a broad coalition of support. They often
need the validation of inﬂuencers to give them legitimacy in the face
of skeptics. They often need resources from stakeholders who have to
make trade-off decisions on where to direct limited budgets, time, or
organizational attention. They often need assistance from gatekeepers
or those in a position to clear barriers that arise. Addressing these
enabling factors or potential barriers can only occur through the
advocacy of others.
Our approach to attaining needed buy-in, commitment, and
advocacy is simple and straightforward. In short, when it comes to
attaining buy-in, commitment, and advocacy, we recommend that
you take steps to win the hearts, engage the minds, and leverage the
hands of your followers.
Winning the Hearts of Your Followers
It is important that followers put their “hearts” into what they are
being asked to do and accomplish. It is through their hearts that they
will have the internal desire to go above and beyond what will be
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
181

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:26
Page 182
required of them. Without such desire, they may put forth less effort,
settle for suboptimal performance, or worse yet, generate minimally
required results when they are capable of generating much more. The
absence of real desire might impact not only individual performance.
Informal leaders can inﬂuence others to think and act in a similar
dysfunctional manner. On the other hand, commitment helps gener-
ate internal drive that will help them embrace the uncertainty and
ambiguity typically associated with change. It can help followers
counter the pressures and stresses being exerted by others who are
more resistant. Such commitment helps build the conﬁdence they will
need when being asked to take risks, such as making a decision based
on limited or incomplete information. Recognizing that most people
have full lives with responsibilities and obligations falling outside of
their career, a clear sense of purpose and a personal commitment to a
goal will help them prioritize multiple and frequently competing
commitments.
Winning the hearts of others involves proving to them that an
objective aligns with their own priorities. It involves seeking out and
offering opportunities for them to contribute to a meaningful cause in
a meaningful way. It includes thinking and acting in a manner that
mirrors their own actions and resonates with them. It involves
thinking and acting in a way that reﬂects shared values, principles,
and intentions. It requires doing things for the right reasons during
moments of truth, not from your perspective but, rather, from theirs.
It involves providing ample opportunities for others to contribute and
excel, allowing them to make attempts and learn from their mistakes,
and encouraging them to share those experiences and lessons with
others. It requires you to do all that you can to provide whatever
support they need to succeed.
The best followers are savvy, and they will quickly know if their
effort and contribution are likely to be rewarded or futile. This
requires regular and consistent proof that reinforces mutual trust. It
demands that you be “all in for the long haul” and as committed to the
success of others as you are to your own. From our experience, most
182
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:26
Page 183
people have a keen sense for self-serving behavior. Acting in self-
centered ways can quickly undermine buy-in and lose the hearts of
potential followers. Demonstrating a legitimately selﬂess approach will
pay dividends, as colleagues gain conﬁdence that your intent and
purpose match theirs.
We live in a world that encourages personal responsibility. As a
global community, we expect adults to self-monitor and self-regulate
their behavior. When working with others in a business context, we
expect our colleagues to contribute to the effort, add value to the
process, act in a responsible manner, and be accountable for those
actions. People rarely live or act in isolation. Most are rooted in a
community. Likewise, members of organizations generally do not
work in a vacuum or in isolation. Rather, they typically act as
contributing members of a team. Even individual contributors are
expected to act in accordance with organizational values, ensuring that
the product they manufacture or service they provide meets team or
organizational standards. With “teamwork” comes the shared assump-
tion that to succeed, each team member must (1) contribute to the
team’s purpose, strategic intent, or goal and (2) rely on the input and
contribution of others to succeed.
Collaboration and contribution are therefore important, whether
individuals are thinking and acting as a member of their community or
as a member of your organization. To win the hearts of others, we
encourage turning the spotlight on them. Individuals must be given
the opportunity to contribute to a cause they consider to be important
and essential. They should be encouraged to contribute in a way they
consider to be right, just, and fair. They must be allowed to participate
in a manner they consider to be signiﬁcant and meaningful. This can
be accomplished by looking for opportunities to:
■
Involve followers when making decisions. Ask them about the
what, how, when, and where of the plan. Ask them for input on
what to focus on, the best way to move forward, or what support
they will need to effectively contribute.
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
183

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:26
Page 184
■
Include followers throughout the entire process. Include them in
conversations at the front end so they can help you ﬁrm up or
reﬁne an idea or concept. Include them at key stages so they can
help strengthen or enhance your technology, systems, and pro-
cesses. Include them at the back end so they can help you identify
ways to improve subsequent iterations.
■
Act on the input of your followers. Their questions or concerns
might reveal an undiscovered bias or blind spot. They can help
you identify previously unexplored issues, considerations, or
implications. Their suggestions and recommendations might
help you ﬁrm up your thoughts on your vision, concept, idea,
approach, or mechanics.
These three actions provide concrete ways to win the hearts of
your followers, by involving them in decisions, bringing them into the
process, and taking visible actions based on what you hear.
While these actions are straightforward, applying them consis-
tently takes meaningful effort. Often it can involve real change to the
status quo. To illustrate this, we’ll now turn to an example—the
YMCA of the USA—to illustrate a strategic leader taking steps to win
the hearts of his followers.
Case in Point: The YMCA of the USA
The YMCA was established in England in 1844. It has grown into an
international organization that serves more than 45 million people in
more than 120 countries and is one of the largest volunteer organiza-
tions in the world. The U.S.-based organization was established seven
years after its English counterpart. The YMCA of the USA (Y-USA) is
now composed of 900 local member associations, each led by a CEO
and governed by a board of directors. It has 2,700 branches, serving
more than 22 million children and adults at over 10,000 locations
across the country. A large metropolitan area like Atlanta might have
one local member association, 25 branches, and a number of YMCA
184

Page 185
facilities, schools, churches, and athletic centers. The goal of the Y-
USA is to create long-lasting personal and social change by strength-
ening communities through three areas of focus: youth development,
healthy living, and social responsibility.
Unlike many organizations, the YMCA is not a monolithic,
headquarters-led organization. Rather, it consists of a network of
federated local member associations. Each local association is obligated
to act in accordance with the Y-USA’s mission, vision, values, and
governing constitution, but the leadership team of each local Y can to
a large extent accept, reject, or modify guidance from the parent
organization. The organization acknowledges this in several ways—it
often describes itself as a “movement” when referring to the parent
organization and its member associations.
The member associations of the YMCA federation are responsible
for identifying and addressing the unique needs of the communities
within which they serve. Each “local Y” strives to address its com-
munity’s needs through a network of volunteers, staff members, local
donors, and community partners. National headquarters serves as the
central resource for local Ys across the United States. In serving as a
shared resource, the Y-USA headquarters in Chicago develops broad
strategies that member Ys can address collectively. It provides infor-
mation and support to local YMCAs attempting to nurture the
potential of children, promote healthy living, and foster a sense of
social responsibility.
The YMCA of the USA fosters youth development in several
important ways. The Y recognizes the importance of instilling the
values of honesty, respect, and responsibility in today’s youth and in
helping children gain needed knowledge, skills, and self-conﬁdence.
It provides a safe environment in which young children can meet to
talk, exercise, learn, and grow. It does this through a broad range of
programs, such as child care for young children and leadership
development for teenagers, each of which introduce and reinforce
important values while building skills and abilities key to becoming
tomorrow’s leaders. The YMCA considers spirit, mind, and body to
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
185

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:26
Page 186
be equally important. It brings family members and community
members together, encourages healthy living, and promotes lifelong
learning through its programs, sporting events, and recreational
activities. The Y also recognizes the importance of community
members working together for the common good. YMCA volun-
teers, staff, and partners collaborate to create and deliver innovative,
community-based solutions that address social challenges and prob-
lems unique to—and affecting members of—the local community.
Neil Nicoll was appointed president and CEO of the YMCA of
the USA in June 2006. Prior to his appointment, Neil had served as
the CEO of the YMCA of Greater Seattle since 1992. A social scientist
by training and the person responsible for matching local resources and
needs in the Greater Seattle area, Neil recognized the importance of
local volunteers, staff, donors, and partners working together to
address the needs of the Y’s constituents. Neil’s academic studies
taught him that this type of collaboration does not occur by happen-
stance. Rather, it requires the buy-in, commitment, and advocacy of a
critical mass of community members. Neil’s experience as a staff
member and as the leader of a local YMCA taught him that local
stakeholders working together in a uniﬁed manner is vital for the local
Y’s impact. It also gave him a key insight—that the overarching
success of the Y-USA relies on local member associations working
together, leveraging resources, and sharing best practices. Neil strongly
believes that “success relies on the performance of the local YMCA,
strengthened—rather than encumbered—by support received from
headquarters in Chicago.”1
At the time of Neil’s appointment, the Y-USA was accomplishing
its mission. However, Neil and many of the local association CEOs he
knew believed that community needs had evolved considerably over
time, sometimes in ways that the federation struggled to support. He
and many of his colleagues felt that the local YMCAs lacked the
ﬂexibility they needed to tackle local issues. At times they also lacked
the unity, alignment, and connectivity the federation needed to
address prevailing and emerging national issues. Neil felt deeply
186

Page 187
that the key to the Y’s future success was greater alignment among the
900 association CEOs and local boards of directors, moving forward
together in one direction to accomplish the Y-USA’s mission, cause,
and the priorities as set by broader social issues.
Neil had the opportunity to address this need when he was named
president and CEO. He began by taking advantage of an organization-
wide strategic planning effort already under way, deciding to use the
process as a mechanism for instilling trust throughout the federation
and for building commitment among its network of volunteers, staff
members, donors, and partners. In doing so, he made major changes to
the process that the planning effort followed.
He started by reconﬁguring the strategic planning process so that it
would lead to the member associations working more closely together
as a tight-knit federation rather than a loose web of isolated local
entities. Within the ﬁrst 12 months of taking ofﬁce, he focused on
several things:
■
Soliciting the input, involvement, and contribution of the 900
local associations;
■
Exploring the beneﬁts of the associations working together rather
than in isolation;
■
Deciding as a movement which issues the YMCA of the USA
would tackle;
■
Determining jointly how local associations would work in con-
cert to address those challenges; and
■
Reinforcing the importance of identifying and addressing local
issues while also contributing to the federation’s broader mission,
cause, and priorities.
To instill trust and to encourage involvement and inclusion, Neil
changed the way the strategic plan was developed. Rather than
creating it centrally and then sharing it with the 900 associations,
Neil and a small team attempted to raise awareness and build trust by
visiting 14 cities in 17 days. In each city, they met with all association
CEOs and chief volunteer ofﬁcers to discuss and decide how the
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy

Page 188
strategic planning process would move forward. During this period,
Neil and his leadership team learned the importance of having
conversations with stakeholders. The beneﬁt of the conversations
was twofold: (1) they served as an information-sharing forum and as a
conduit for innovative ideas and recommendations from throughout
the federation, and (2) the time devoted to conversations and discus-
sions resulted in fewer questions and less resistance later on in the
process.
In town hall–style sessions, Neil and his leadership team con-
ducted a series of conversations with hundreds of colleagues at a time.
To ensure that local associations would be fully invested in the plan,
Neil asked for a voluntary increase in national dues to fund additional
national services. For Neil, this was one of his earliest moments of
truth. After hours of conversations, discussions, and debates spanning
four weeks, the needed $5 million dollars in funding was raised. Each
local association agreed to add between 5 and 10 percent to their
annual dues. Their commitment to do so led to a key outcome—all of
the associations now had “skin in the game.”
The ﬁrst strategic plan developed after Neil’s appointment led to
signiﬁcant changes. They saw more active involvement of each of the
900 local YMCA associations, with each member association con-
tributing money and resources to priorities built around national social
issues. Each of the local associations also became more aligned to the
Y-USA’s broader mission, cause, and priorities.
The initial strategic planning effort marked the beginning of the
YMCA headquarters’ engagement with local Ys in almost all impor-
tant decisions pertaining to programs and resources. Task forces and
committees were subsequently established to allow local leaders to
explore issues from a national perspective. It also enabled them to
contribute to the design, development, and implementation of inno-
vative solutions.
Two years later, the next strategic planning cycle occurred
following a comprehensive study of the YMCA’s mission, cause,
priorities, and performance. As YMCA association CEOs and chief
188

Page 189
volunteer ofﬁcers started sharing perceptions about the Y’s brand, Neil
established a task force of 15 local YMCA association CEOs to address
the matter. The members of the task force represented their peers,
worked with Neil and his staff, and spoke with external consultants to
assess the brand. They explored ways of strengthening it and discussed
where the Y-USA should apply its effort and direct its resources over
the short term.
The task force conducted the most comprehensive market
research study in the YMCA’s 160-year history. This market research
revealed that 98 percent of Americans recognized the YMCA brand,
with 92 percent having a favorable impression. However, the task
force was astounded to learn that only 50 percent of those surveyed
understood why the YMCA offers its current slate of programs.
Rather than recognizing that YMCA programs were tied to its
goal of building self-esteem and self-conﬁdence, respondents believe
the YMCA provides activities and programs for the simple sake of
providing activities and programs. This lack of awareness and under-
standing revealed the need to clarify the Y’s brand and align all of the
local associations behind it.
Reinforcing this challenge, another important discovery that
emerged was that the 900 associations across the country had adopted
502 different mission statements. This fragmentation was a major
concern for the task force, but after discussion, they decided not to ask
the associations to abandon them. Instead, the task force took a
different path. They reached out to the local YMCAs, ﬁrst emphasiz-
ing the local YMCA association’s long and noteworthy history and
their proven track record of success built on a common heritage. The
task force then conducted a series of conversations, discussions, and
debates to help the local associations recognize their common cause.
From this work, they established a mutual understanding and self-
identity that local Ys could rally around: “We strengthen the foun-
dations of community.”
The 15 YMCA CEOs on the task force, representing their peers
across all 900 associations, decided to adopt this statement as the Y’s
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
189

Page 190
common cause or brand promise. Following further conversations,
the task force went on to identify ways that member associations could
strengthen the foundations of community. Importantly, in this process
both the common cause and the means they’d pursue toward that end
were identiﬁed by the task force rather than Neil or national head-
quarters. This was a direct reﬂection of Neil’s philosophy regarding
the organization, born of his experience working in a local chapter.
Once the YMCA’s focus and boundaries had been crystallized, the
association CEOs realized that the YMCA’s constitution would need
to be modiﬁed to extend and expand the requirements for an
association remaining chartered as a member of the federation.
Following the previously tested and proven approach, Neil appointed
another task force of staff and volunteers to review and modify the Y’s
constitution. The task force—through a series of discussions con-
ducted throughout the federation—established 12 requirements each
association would be required to meet as a member. An association
failing to adhere to the requirements would be subject to having its
membership in the YMCA federation revoked.
Prior to taking the amendments to the 900 associations for a vote,
Neil and his team went on a road trip to 14 cities over a three-week
period. During this tour, the amendments were introduced, debates
occurred, and recommendations were captured. Many of those
recommendations were incorporated into a series of revisions. The
revised amendments were shared on a second, similar road trip. Only
then were the amendments put to a vote, with the association CEOs
and chief volunteer ofﬁcers being allowed to vote on each of the
12 constitutional requirements. All passed with 92 percent or more
support, due in large part to the trust that the task force had built and
the process that Neil and his leadership team had put in to place.
The amended constitution set the stage for the YMCA’s third
strategic planning cycle. This planning process was structured around
the YMCA’s three areas of focus—youth development, healthy living,
and social responsibility. A Strategic Plan Advisory Committee was
formed, which sought the guidance and input from more than
190

Page 191
1,700 peers in creating a plan for delivering the YMCA cause through
the adoption of deﬁned goals, metrics, designated responsibilities, and
accountabilities. They agreed to work together on signature programs
such as diabetes, to close existing academic gaps, and to put the Y’s 22
million members to work as volunteers addressing social change.
These actions, through the commitment and contribution of the local
associations, were concrete actions reﬂecting the Y’s promise to
strengthen communities.
The approach Neil has taken over the last eight years to bolster
buy-in, commitment, and advocacy by involving every local associa-
tion in strategic planning and decision making has led to numerous
positive results. The YMCA’s brand revitalization is well under way,
and a national marketing campaign will launch in 2015. The national
dues structure has been modiﬁed so that it is fairer to small and large
associations alike. Member associations are working together to
implement a full slate of signature programs to address national social
issues. The YMCA is now striving to strengthen communities by
putting its 22 million members to work as a community of volunteers.
Most important, Neil has put the federation to work to strengthen the
broader national community by helping each member association
think and function as part of a community rather than as an isolated
local entity.
Neil points out that “the YMCA member associations now realize
that by thinking and functioning as a federation, they can be much
stronger than they could ever be individually.” The sharing of resources
and knowledge is much more powerful than their individual compo-
nents. The strides that the YMCA has made to foster inclusion and
involvement has had two important beneﬁts. First, the CEOs and
boards of directors willingly contribute to the YMCA of the USA’s
mission,cause, and priorities.Second, YMCA staff arenowmuch better
at reaching consensus, managing disagreement, and resolving conﬂict.
Enhanced skills in these areas have proven invaluable as conversations
pertaining to internal and external issues continue. The 900 member
associations now ask about what else they and the Y-USA might do to
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy

Page 192
meet the personal and social needs of their local community. They have
an equal appreciation for these issues at the national level.
Neil emphasizes that the willingness to listen, discuss, debate, and
compromise are all part of the YMCA’s attempt to promote personal
and social change. His eight-and-a-half-year journey also suggests that
engaging others, allowing them to help crystallize a vision, demon-
strating listening, setting high expectations, and taking steps to help
others are key to instilling trust. Neil advocates actively for this
philosophy, encouraging all leaders to “be passionate about what
they do, take bold steps to leverage the collective power of their team,
and actively learn about the needs, concerns, and motives of the
people they serve.” These actions, from Neil’s perspective, all con-
tribute to capturing the hearts of followers.
Engaging the Minds of Your Followers
It is important for followers to apply their “minds” to what they are
being asked to do and accomplish. It is through intellectual engage-
ment that they will apply the knowledge required to accomplish critical
tasks. Such engagement will enable them to think about and reﬂect on
what they are doing, encouraging them to investigate ways of doing it
more effectively and efﬁciently. Such engagement will allow them to
recognize the risks and costs of failing to do what is necessary and to
understand the nature and importance of their contribution toward the
greater good. Such engagement gives them the insights they need to
continuously improve systems, processes, and technologies to support
the broader plan. The proper and appropriate application of knowl-
edge will contribute to the conﬁdence they’ll need to act autono-
mously or make decisions with limited guidance and direction.
Recognizing that today’s environment is often complex, intellectual
engagement and the resulting knowledge is the mechanism by which
followers—individually and as members of a team—will solve prob-
lems, manage conﬂict, and resolve crises.
192

It’s important that your followers possess the right knowledge to
contribute to your strategy and to properly strengthen the mechanisms
necessary to drive outcomes. This involves helping them be conﬁdent
that they have the capability and fortitude to do so. It includes
emphasizing knowledge areas critical for individual, team, and orga-
nizational success. It also involves knowing when individuals and
teams don’t have the knowledge and expertise they need and taking
steps to mitigate or reduce that risk. It includes recognizing, celebrat-
ing, and sharing lessons learned so they can be adopted and applied
throughout the organization or community. It involves role modeling
the correct application of knowledge and reacting properly when
mistakes occur. It requires doing things for the right reasons, not from
your perspective but, rather, from that of others.
To illustrate these actions, we will use a case study from the United
States Coast Guard that demonstrates the unique role that knowledge
can play and the way that one leader prompted intellectual engage-
ment among his colleagues to effectively garner buy-in, commitment,
and support.
Case in Point: The United States Coast Guard
The Coast Guard was established in 1790. It has a rich and storied
history of safeguarding the nation’s interests and saving countless lives
during natural disasters and emergencies. Its active-duty members and
reservists contribute to the Coast Guard’s mission both individually
and as members of the close-knit Coast Guard team. Semper Paratus
(Always Ready) is the Coast Guard’s well-known motto.
The Coast Guard is a large, complex organization. It is one of ﬁve
armed forces of the United States. It patrols more than 95,000 miles of
shoreline and navigable waterways and protects the security of the
nation’s 3.4-million-square-mile maritime economic zone. Its pri-
mary mission is to save lives, protect the nation’s ports and natural
resources, enforce its laws and treaties, and interdict drug smugglers

and illegal migrants. The Coast Guard’s inﬂuence and impact are local,
regional, national, and global. Although its presence since the late
1700s was primarily along the nation’s rivers, in its seaports, and along
the coastline, that presence—along with its mission—drastically
expanded in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
on the United States. At that time, the Coast Guard had over 43,000
full-time employees, 9,000 reservists, and 8,000 civilian employees
and operated over 230 cutters, 1,400 boats, and 240 aircraft.
In terms of shore facilities, the Coast Guard at that time owned and
leased almost 35 million square feet of building and ofﬁce space,
operated and maintained more than 7,900 buildings at more than 600
locations, and managed approximately 70,000 acres of land. The Coast
Guard’s Ofﬁce of Civil Engineering Shore Facilities Capital Asset
Management Division, operating out of the U.S. Coast Guard Head-
quarters in Washington, DC, was responsible for maintaining the
Coast Guard’s shore facilities. This was an important endeavor because
(1) the Coast Guard’s mission readiness and capability relied on its
shore facilities and (2) the replacement value of the shore facilities was
huge, at the time estimated at over $7 billion, or almost 45 percent of
the Coast Guard’s total capital assets.
Establishing a world-class shore facilities management strategy
within the Coast Guard was the vision of David M. Hammond,
who at the time served as the Coast Guard’s base operations program
manager. David considered strategic planning to be key to maximizing
the Coast Guard’s shore facilities and asset management, in turn helping
support Coast Guard mission readiness and accomplishment. Bolstering
these management capabilities, he believed, “would improve decision
making within the Coast Guard and allow it to more effectively
leverage resources, allow it to manage risk associated with having
inadequate or insufﬁcient shore facilities, and lower shore facilities’
management costs.”2 David also recognized the magnitude of change
that would be associated with adopting a “robust” shore facilities
management strategy. A departure from the previous base-centered
approach to a more strategic Coast Guard–wide asset-management
194

Page 195
planning and decision-making process would require new ways of
thinking.
We have had the honor and privilege of working closely with the
Coast Guard as consultants and advisors. We consider “Coasties,” as
members of the Coast Guard are sometimes called, to be well trained,
properly prepared, and 100 percent committed to their mission. They
not only follow policies and procedures but also adhere to more than
200 years of Coast Guard tradition. Within this context, David
devoted much of his career to helping the Coast Guard adopt a
more strategic asset management process. He knew from the begin-
ning that such a profound change in their way of doing business would
require the buy-in, contribution, and advocacy of the Coast Guard’s
rank and ﬁle. Although David’s subsequent effort to win the hearts and
leverage the hands of his colleagues was highly successful, we consider
his approach to engaging the minds of his uniformed and civilian
colleagues to be especially noteworthy.
David realized that in order to engage the minds of his colleagues
around a particular vision or mission, he would have to ﬁrst think
through the implications of the change he was advocating. After
reﬂecting on his personal level of capability and expertise, David
recognized the need to bolster his own understanding of best practices.
He enrolled in graduate-level courses in research, engineering, man-
agement, and planning at Syracuse University. He also attended an
advanced management-development program conducted at the
National Defense University, where he took graduate-level courses
in strategy development, management, and planning. David describes
the management development program as placing equal emphasis on
policy formulation and execution, information technology, and
important subjects such as change leadership and strategic manage-
ment. This blend of courses led to an important insight: self-awareness
and situational awareness are equally important to the person think-
ing and acting as a change agent. Self-awareness aids in recognizing
strengths and mitigating limitations. David considers the resulting
competency, self-conﬁdence, and self-motivation to be key to his
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
195

3GC05

2:38:27
Page 196
success in that those three factors reinforced his ability to fully engage
the minds of his colleagues. His situational awareness led David to
conclude that given the Coast Guard’s culture, the Coasties’ deeply
engrained values, and their commitment to doing things the “Coast
Guard way,” he would have to engage the minds of his colleagues in a
variety of ways.
Once David felt he was personally prepared to help guide change
within the Coast Guard, he began his decade-long journey by
identifying and allying himself with several uniformed and civilian
leaders within the Coast Guard who had progressive ideas similar to his
own. He also realized that as a senior civilian program manager, he
would have to gain the trust and respect of uniformed ofﬁcers. He
therefore formed a trusting relationship and a lasting informal part-
nership with Jack Dempsey, a young and progressive lieutenant
commander who helped David reﬁne his vision and garner the respect
of the uniformed rank and ﬁle over time. In addition to introducing
and reinforcing the vision through informal conversations with Coast
Guard leaders and managers, David and Jack established a formal
Guidance Team of shore facility and capital-asset management leaders.
Members of this Guidance Team helped David and Jack further reﬁne
David’s vision. In doing so, David and Jack realized that the members
of the Guidance Team gained personal ownership of the vision. At
times, this shared ownership resulted in changes to the vision. While
David and Jack had very clear views on what success looked like, they
made the conscious decision to embrace this input. For David and
Jack, the overall success of the plan—rather than their personal
ownership of that vision—was of the utmost importance.
The Guidance Team gave David and Jack a forum within which
to share information with key stakeholders about the what, why,
where, when, and how of proceeding. They provided brieﬁngs and
presentations on what the approach would entail, how it represented
the next step in the continuing evolution of facilities management,
and how it would contribute to the Coast Guard’s mission readiness
and accomplishment. They invited thought leaders and luminaries in
196
Leading with Strategic Thinking

2:38:27
Page 197
engineering, architecture, and facilities management to share insights
that could be applied to the Coast Guard. In some meetings, the
Guidance Team members discussed case studies, illustrating how large,
complex organizations similar to the Coast Guard had adopted and
beneﬁted from a more strategic approach.
This learning helped the Guidance Team embrace the idea that
uniformed and civilian employees working within their areas of
responsibility could succeed if given needed information (i.e., the
what and the why), guidance and direction (i.e., the who and the
how), and support and assistance (i.e., the when and the where). The
Guidance Team helped David and Jack identify knowledge gaps that
needed to be addressed through traditional training and development
activities. Guidance Team members also recommended that David and
Jack address knowledge gaps and garner needed buy-in through three
key actions: (1) conducting stakeholder interview and information-
sharing sessions, (2) holding a Coast Guard Facilities and Assets Man-
agement Summit, and (3) applying a proposed decision-making process
during one of the Coast Guard’s Regional Strategic Planning Sessions.
David and Jack worked with a small team to develop and conduct
a series of stakeholder interview and information-sharing sessions.
These were designed to serve two important purposes. First and
foremost, they provided information on upcoming changes to the
Coast Guard’s Shore Facilities and Asset Management process and
how those changes would positively affect their organization’s mission
readiness and accomplishment. Second, they were designed to solicit
information from the key stakeholders and organize forums for
addressing those needs. The list of stakeholders participating in the
interview and information-sharing sessions included almost two dozen
high-ranking, uniformed, and civilian employees representing a half-
dozen geographic, operational, and functional areas. Information
shared during the sessions centered on these four key messages:

the Coast Guard moves toward a more strategic facilities and assets
acquisition and management environment.
■
The stewardship of the shore facilities and assets remains essential in
supportoftheCoastGuard’smissionreadinessandaccomplishment.
■
Strategic planning and decision making are essential as civil engi-
neers seek to anticipate and meet the Coast Guard’s operational
needs.
■
Knowledge gaps currently exist that would hinder the Coast
Guard’s ability to execute this strategy, and the Ofﬁce of Civil
Engineering will partner with thought leaders in the private sector
to close those gaps.
In addition to providing a vehicle to share these messages, the
sessions also allowed David and Jack to solicit information from key
stakeholders, such as:
■
Their understanding of the goals driving the changes being made.
■
Their awareness of how these changes would allow shore facilities
and assets to be acquired and managed at the right time, place, and
cost.
■
Perceived conﬁdence in the Ofﬁce of Civil Engineering’s ability
to more strategically manage shore facilities and assets.
■
Trust in the Ofﬁce of Civil Engineering’s access to the resources,
technology, systems, and HR capabilities needed for this new
approach.
■
Their commitment to providing necessary support, assistance, and
advocacy.
ThefeedbackandsupportthatDavidandJackreceivedthroughthese
sessions informed their next steps. Based on a perceived need for greater
communication, the Ofﬁce of Civil Engineering launched a monthly
electronicnewsletter describing changes beingmadetobolster the Coast
Guard’s approach. Editions of the newsletter addressed topics such as
critical dates and milestone events, what employees were being asked to
do, and what they could do to help prepare for and support the new
approach. Although the newsletter proved beneﬁcial, the Guidance
198
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:27
Page 199
Team members realized additional steps were needed to engage the
minds of their colleagues and associates. Based on issues raised in the
monthly newsletter’s “Frequently Asked Questions” section, they
decided to hold a summit.
The Facilities and Assets Management Summit was designed to
supplement and reinforce previously shared information about the
why, what, and how of the Coast Guard adopting the new approach.
It also included lectures, working sessions, and a learning lab show-
casing supporting technology, processes, and resources. In addition to
providing relevant information, the Summit allowed David and Jack
to solicit information from the rank and ﬁle on their:
■
Understanding of the changes being made and how they would
allow the Coast Guard to better acquire and manage its shore
facilities and assets;
■
Appreciation of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required of
them to support the new approach;
■
Conﬁdence in using the resources, technology, and systems being
put into place; and
■
Commitment to supporting, assisting, and advocating for the
Coast Guard’s new approach.
Like the information sessions, the summit was widely viewed as a
success. This bolstered David and Jack’s credibility, allowing them to
proceed with a crucial ﬁrst application of the new approach.
To prove its merit, David and Jack then arranged for the new
process to be utilized during one of the Coast Guard’s Regional
Strategic Planning Sessions. “We recognized the importance of
proving to key stakeholders and the rank and ﬁle that the newly
adopted resources, technology, processes, and knowledge could be
applied in the ﬁeld,” David recalled. David and Jack considered the
pilot application to serve two important purposes. First, it would
bolster the previous planning process by emphasizing external forces
affecting the Coast Guard’s mission readiness and accomplishment.
This included both positive forces and obstacles, barriers, and
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
199

Page 200
impediments. Second, lessons learned and best practices captured
during the pilot program would be incorporated into the next
iteration of the process, to be leveraged by other Coast Guard regions
as they conducted future planning sessions.
The Regional Strategic Planning Session involved uniformed
ofﬁcers and civilian managers. They were briefed on the new
approach to strategic planning and decision making. In addition to
receiving an overview of the process, they were given examples of
how each step might be implemented, given the Region’s unique
situation and circumstance. When questions were raised, time was
taken to address them. When problems surfaced, time was devoted to
helping the participants understand the nature of the problem and
explore various ways of resolving it. The participants were impressed
with the focus and clarity of the process and pleased with how
applicable the steps were. More speciﬁcally, the new process allowed
the participants to:
■
Examine internal and external trends inﬂuencing and impacting
the Coast Guard’s mission readiness and accomplishment;
■
Compile a prioritized list of the strengths, weaknesses, opportu-
nities, and threats most likely to impact the region 4 to 12 years
into the future;
■
Deﬁne the future missions of the region;
■
Determine key factors necessary both to capitalize on the strengths
and opportunities and to mitigate the weaknesses and threats;
■
Formulate a status quo and alternate concepts of operational force
allocations to support achievement of future missions of the region;
■
Develop strategies for accomplishing the status quo and three
alternative operational force allocations;
■
Craft alternative concepts of logistics to support each alternative
operational force allocation; and
■
Selecttheoperational forceallocationsand conceptof logisticsmost
likely to enable the Coast Guard to successfully accomplish its
future missions by capitalizing on its strengths and opportunities,
and by mitigating weaknesses and threats identiﬁed through the
SWOT analysis.

From David’s perspective, “the most important aspect of the new
approach was that it focused on external strategic results and outcomes
rather than on internal tactical output factors.” Of critical importance,
the results and outcomes of the process were tied directly to the Coast
Guard’s mission readiness and accomplishment.
These actions represent a small percentage of the steps David and
Jack took to identify and seize opportunities to engage the minds of
their colleagues and associates. As knowledge gaps surfaced, David,
Jack, and members of the Guidance Team supplemented the preced-
ing actions with additional information sharing and professional
development activities. They also engaged the minds of the Coasties
by ratcheting up the Coast Guard’s performance management, feed-
back, reward, and recognition systems. These and other actions helped
David and Jack garner needed buy-in, commitment, and advocacy.
Together, they contributed to the successful introduction of a more
strategic process. That process has contributed to more improved and
timely decision making within the Coast Guard, more effective
utilization of assets and resources, less risk associated with inadequate
or insufﬁcient shore facilities, and lower overall operational costs.
Although reluctant to take credit for this accomplishment, David and
Jack were awarded the Society of American Military Engineers’
Oren Medal for their “outstanding contribution to military engineer-
ing through achievement in design, construction, administration,
research, and development.”
Leveraging the Hands of Your Followers
It is important for followers to “use both hands” when striving to do
what they are being asked to do. It is through the skillful application of
their full abilities that they will add value and the organization or
community will achieve its potential. While buy-in and commitment
are extremely important, the team must possess and apply the proper
tools to accomplish the task at hand. We use “tools” broadly in this

context, as it includes necessary skills and abilities. We also broadly
deﬁne the “job” as including helping to formulate and reﬁne the
vision in addition to helping determine the best path forward.
Leveraging the hands of others involves intentionally determining
what is required of stakeholders and then taking concrete steps to
ensure they have the means of doing what is required. This includes
forming a deep understanding of the inputs (e.g., information,
instructions, and guidance), mechanisms (e.g., resources and tools),
and mechanics (e.g., the actions or activities) required for success.
Leveraging the hands of followers also involves recognizing what will
prove difﬁcult and providing support to address those challenges.
Often it involves working side by side with your followers to explore
ways to enhance mechanics that are already in place.
Today, working alongside followers often differs from times past.
Information and interaction ﬂow in real time, aided by technology
that has accelerated the pace of change. This has real implications for
how you prepare and work with stakeholders:
■
Consider job aids or electronic performance support rather than
policy and procedure manuals.
■
Consider just-in-time brieﬁngs rather than training classes.
■
Consider daily text messages or social media postings rather than
monthly newsletters.
■
Consider the distribution of regular, up-to-date thinking rather
than ﬁnalized, completed plans.
Enabling others to contribute requires more than a committed and
knowledgeable team. Team members also need to be actively engaged.
An approach built on a solid foundation of inputs and two-way
collaboration will contribute to an environment that instills self-
conﬁdence, buy-in, commitment, and advocacy.
The Heartland Angels serves as an example of an organization
taking multifaceted steps to attain the buy-in, commitment, and advo-
cacy of others. We’ll use a proﬁle of its founder and CEO as a case in

his many followers.
Case in Point: The Heartland Angels
Heartland Angels, Inc. might be described as a private equity network
that helps investors identify companies in which to invest. However,
the focus of the individuals who make up Heartland Angels extends
well beyond investing. While the “core” of Heartland Angels is its
network of investors, it is also a network of mentors, advisors, and
consultants who work together to provide knowledge, share exper-
tise, and introduce a slate of management assets to enthusiastic
entrepreneurs and newly established management teams.
Ronald L. Kirschner, MD, is the president of Heartland Angels.3 In
some ways, Dr. Kirschner’s career has been similar to those of typical
physicians. He has practiced medicine for 23 years. He has served as the
president of the Irving Park chapter of the Chicago Medical Society.
He taught at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center and was previously
an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Medi-
cine. He also completed residencies in emergency medicine at the
University of Chicago and in anesthesia at West Virginia University.
That is where Dr. Kirschner’s career as a typical physician ends.
Throughout his life, Ronald Kirschner has had an unquenchable thirst
for knowledge and an equally demanding curiosity. He has always
been interested in how different methods might improve the quality
of life for individuals, families, and entire communities. His studies in
medicine, science, and business have prompted his interest in how to
best set the stage for individual, team, and organizational success. He
has conﬁdence in the potential of science and technology to improve
life but realizes there are many situations in which the right resources
aren’t available to innovators.
This realization led Dr. Kirschner to broaden his focus beyond the
practice of medicine. He became actively involved in health care

203

3GC05

Page 204
innovation and development, startups, and private equity. While still
practicing medicine, he established three companies dealing with
nutrition, managed care, and health care resource utilization. He
served as a subject matter expert on health care issues to the Illinois
State government. He served as a VP of technology development for a
biotechnology company and was involved with the board of directors
of a company that develops FDA-approved cancer treatment drugs
based on traditional Chinese medicine. He has also helped the owners
and leaders of a slate of early stage companies make funding, planning,
and development decisions. After spending time on these various
activities, Dr. Kirchner recognized the need for a network of investors,
mentors, advisors, and consultants to help stimulate local innovation in
a more coordinated way. To do so, Dr. Kirschner established Heart-
land Angels.
The Heartland Angels business model is unique. It brings human,
intellectual, and ﬁnancial capital together to achieve two important
objectives: to serve as a catalyst of innovation and to provide the means
by which early stage organizations will not only survive but thrive.
Heartland Angels targets companies that focus on three areas: science-
and technology-based innovations; retail, manufacturing, and distri-
bution; and telecommunications and information technology. Heart-
land Angels has established a track record of identifying promising
startups and helping them succeed. Heartland Angels’ approach
consists of four components:
1. The team establishes a highly structured approach to funding viable
innovations.
2. A comprehensive analysis is conducted with early stage manage-
ment teams to identify the opportunities, blind spots, biases, and
challenges needing action.
3. Experts and executives with deep expertise provide real-time guid-
ance and assistance.
4. Protocols are established to ensure optimal communication and
leveraging of resources and capabilities between the investor
network and portfolio company.
204

Page 205
These four components form the basis for accelerating the success
of each new venture.
Dr. Kirschner realized early on that Heartland Angels’ network of
mentors, advisors, and consultants would have to set it apart from
other private-equity ﬁrms. To succeed, they would have to work
together to gain the trust, conﬁdence, and commitment of entrepre-
neurs and newly established management teams. He recognized that
to gain trust, his network would have to prove through its words
and actions that it is on the side of the entrepreneur. They had to help
each management team with both their short-term and long-term
success.
To execute on this goal, Dr. Kirschner established several key
priorities to help ensure that the Heartland Angel network would
deliver value:
■
All investment opportunities would need to fall within the three
core priorities for the Heartland Angels: science- and technology-
based innovations; retail, manufacturing, and distribution; and
telecommunications and information technology.
■
A structured evaluation for investors was necessary at the front
end of the process. This front-end evaluation would assess risks
associated with the opportunity.
■
An analysis for entrepreneurs was also necessary. This would
surface both the internal strengths and weaknesses as well as the
external opportunities and threats that the management team
would need to address.
■
A deeper operational review would evaluate matters of technol-
ogy, systems, processes, governance, and management practices.
This evaluation would deﬁne a blueprint for management and
also would reveal the founders’ biases and blind spots.
■
The completed analysis informed an evaluation of the manage-
ment team itself, surfacing both strengths and competency gaps
that would need to be addressed.
Addressing these priorities in a proactive manner allowed Dr.
Kirschner and the network to identify the best ways to provide support
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
205

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:27
Page 206
for each new venture. Achieving success as a startup is no small task.
Each management team must address competitive challenges, prepare
for short- and long-term growth, apply leadership and management
capabilities, plan and coordinate resources, distribute products or
deliver services, hit key milestones, and execute an agreed-upon exit
strategy.
To raise the likelihood of success, Dr. Kirschner established a
network of individuals to provide needed guidance and support.
Although Heartland Angels’ broad network of resources stands ready
to provide needed assistance and support, new ventures typically
receive initial guidance and direction primarily from Dr. Kirschner.
He uses this time to sensitize the management team to deﬁciencies and
capabilities that need to be addressed in the organization’s business
plan in order to give them initial credibility when presenting to
prospective investors. For example, a management team might add a
CFO before presenting its business plan so that the team is better
equipped to ﬁrm up the ﬁnancial forecast.
Dr. Kirschner helps each new venture prepare in order to present a
compelling case for its founders’ vision to prospective investors. From
his perspective, a compelling case requires speaking from both con-
ceptual and tactical perspectives. Conceptually, Dr. Kirschner helps
ensure the entrepreneur can tell others about the vision for their
product, service, or company. It is important for prospective investors
to understand why it should exist, where it currently stands, and where
it is headed into the future. It is important for the entrepreneur to
demonstrate a thorough and well-considered understanding of the
problem they are going to solve. Tactically, Dr. Kirschner helps ensure
the founder can prove to others that the management team has thought
through the full spectrum of business issues, considerations, and
implications involved in successfully executing their strategy. Here,
Dr. Kirschner tries to expose personal biases and blind spots likely to
impede their success. This could include gaps in research and devel-
opment, transfer of knowledge and technology, marketing, supply
chain management, manufacturing, distribution, or scaling strategies.

Page 207
The range of capabilities that Dr. Kirschner helps them consider
extends well beyond the topics taught in a typical MBA program. To
garner the interest of prospective investors, the entrepreneur must do
the following:
■
Share insights, realizations, and lessons that go beyond the tech-
nology, services, products, or ﬁnancials. The entrepreneur must
share something meaningful, something likely to resonate “with
folks outside of the room.”
■
Tell a credible and believable story about where the idea came
from, how the product or service will meet a need, how many
individuals are willing and able to purchase the product or service,
and the challenges the company will face on the road ahead.
■
Describe how the product or service will beneﬁt society. Simply
generating revenue or gaining wealth is not compelling for the
type of investors Heartland Angels works with.
■
Demonstrate through experience and commitment that the entre-
preneur has the fortitude to take this idea from concept to reality.
The catalyst for this falls outside of dollars and cents—it falls within
the heart and mind of the leader.
■
Address how any technology-related aspects of the plan are a
viable solution to an everyday concern, challenge, or problem.
Technology for its own sake is a trip to be avoided.
■
Create excitement with the prospective investors. A good idea
will compel them to ask questions. The best ideas will prompt
follow-up questions. Dr. Kirschner watches for both.
Only after the founder and management team have demonstrated
an ability to tell a conceptually and tactically compelling story are they
allowed access to the Heartland Angels’ broad network of alliances,
mentors, advisors, and consultants.
Heartland Angels has established relationships with professional
services ﬁrms, service providers, and academic institutions that help a
startup with execution and the necessary coordination of resources.
These alliances are mutually beneﬁcial in that they allow organizations
to showcasediscoveries andinnovations, establish strategicrelationships
Garnering Buy-in, Commitment, and Advocacy
207

3GC05
03/10/2015

Page 208
in adjacent industries, source prospective employees, and share mutu-
ally beneﬁcial information within the alliance. These alliances also
provide information and data likely to prove useful to management
teams preparing to present to prospective investors. Alliance members
frequently work together to identify opportunities to join forces. To
enable these connections, Heartland Angels will frequently sponsor
social events that allow entrepreneurs from different industries and
disciplines to network and share stories.
Heartland Angels established a formal mentoring program designed
to provide concrete and timely guidance to entrepreneurs. Like most
mentoring programs, the Heartland Angels’ mentor establishes a lasting
and trusting relationship with the entrepreneur. The mentor helps
develop self-awareness and a better understanding of their context. This
can include help to:
■
Outline goals and objectives for moving forward,
■
Clarify personal values that are key to short- and long-term success,
■
Identify and capitalize on opportunities for personal and profes-
sional development,
■
Surface and take steps to address personal weaknesses, or
■
Recognize andtake stepstomitigatepersonal biases and blindspots.
Heartland Angels has also established a network of voluntary
advisors who are best suited to assist early stage companies operating
within a particular industry or sector. These advisors help establish
accountability within the management team and ensure that everyone
delivers on their accountabilities, achieves their performance objectives,
and performs in accordance with predeﬁned outcomes. The advisors’
focus differs from the role the mentor plays. The advisors help teams
respond to nuanced situationsandcircumstances, and address challenges
pertaining to speciﬁc matters of organizational structure, strategy,
technology, systems, processes, and practices. The advisor serves as a
trusted generalist and many times is the only person with whom the
entrepreneur, small business owner, or management team member is
208
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC05
03/10/2015
2:38:27
Page 209
comfortable sharing initial thoughts and ideas. The advisor frequently
helps the entrepreneur think through issues, considerations, and impli-
cations. They occasionally participate in crucial conversations and help
facilitate critical meetings. Advisors typically provide introductions to
thought leaders, professional services ﬁrms, and consultancies that are
likely to prove useful and beneﬁcial to the entrepreneur in the future or
when certain situations or circumstance emerge. Heartland Angels
advisors have practical experience. They help entrepreneurs translate
a raw idea into a compelling vision and transform a group of new
employees into a high-performing team. They also help managers think
and act like leaders and provide guidance and direction on what the
management team can do to help set the stage for short- and long-term
success.
In addition to the advice and expertise, the Heartland Angels
established a network of service providers who offer support in areas
such as business planning, accounting, marketing, supply chain man-
agement, and manufacturing. Heartland Angels helps set the stage for a
successful partnership with these providers, ensuring that they are
more than just transactional relationships. Individual consultants and
consulting ﬁrms are required to complete a comprehensive and
detailed questionnaire when applying to the network, and once
accepted they must provide references. The Heartland Angels net-
work database provides a proﬁle of each individual consultant and
service provider, including details on capabilities relevant to early stage
companies.
These are the key actions and steps Dr. Kirschner takes to leverage
the hands of his fellow investors and partners. Collectively, they offer
greater value to the early stage ventures they work with than Dr.
Kirschner could alone. In making these connections, he is constantly
expanding and leveraging a wide network for the beneﬁt of these
ventures. He gladly gives his own time where he sees the opportunity.
By doing so, Dr. Kirschner leads by example. As others follow his lead,
he bolsters trust and conﬁdence within the overall Heartland Angels
network.

Winning Hearts, Engaging Minds, and Leveraging Hands
Strategic leadership entails enlisting others who can help provide
insight and drive change. To enlist others, it is essential to win the
hearts, engage the minds, and leverage the hands of others. To win
hearts, ask others to contribute to a cause that is meaningful and
important to them, think and act as a selﬂess steward, and take steps to
include and involve stakeholders in important decisions. To engage
minds, strive to share information others will need and solicit input on
how to proceed. To leverage hands, take steps to make connections
between parties that can apply knowledge, skills, and abilities where
they will have the greatest impact.
Taking actions like these can attract, engage, and retain individuals,
which is crucial to success. Enlisting others can also free up capacity for
matters of strategic importance. Committed partners can also enhance
strategic thinking by bringing creative and innovative ideas. As a close
colleague in a professional services ﬁrm points out, in some cases
1 + 1 = 4.
We’ve now reviewed the actions that individuals can take to gain
insight, drive change, and enlist others. Having examined what
effective strategic leadership looks like, this prompts a question we
are often asked but have yet to address in this book: How might an
individual bolster his or her ability to think and lead more strategically?
We address this important question in the next chapter.

Developing
Strategic Leadership
The genesis of this book was our experience coaching and teaching
leaders to be more strategic. Between the two of us, we have spent
over 35 years working with organizations and individuals to help
them be more effective. We have spent a combined 15 years in the
classroom teaching graduate students to understand and apply the
concepts of strategy. In 2008, we created a class at Northwestern
University called “Leading with Strategic Thinking,” in response to
alumni who wished there had been more content on the fundamentals
of business strategy in their master’s programs. A few years into that
class, we started discussing the ideas that became this book. The title of
the class came to embody what we saw as a real need for many leaders
and organizations: an appreciation of how to better apply a combina-
tion of strategic thinking and leadership. Leadership consistently
differentiates the performance of individuals who stand out from
their peers and achieve extraordinary results. Likewise, leadership has a
211

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 212
greater impact when it is applied strategically—focused on the right
priorities and applied in suitable ways.
We have been in countless conversations in which the lack of
strategic thinking is lamented. We’ve spoken with CEOs who have
asked us to help executives who were struggling to meet changing
expectations. We’ve advised teams who weren’t productive in their
time spent together. We’ve helped leaders who have started a new role
with a mandate to drive change, only to realize that the team they
inherited was unlikely to meet the challenges that lie ahead. Some-
times they are right, and the best course of action is for different leaders
with different skills to take the reins. Sometimes the urgency of the
situation leaves little choice but to take swift action and change course.
But other times this hasn’t been the case. Frequently, we’ve seen that
leaders can become more strategic, and we’ve worked with many
leaders and leadership teams to help them do so.
We once worked with a global petrochemical company whose HR
department was spending millions of dollars a year on management
consulting ﬁrms. The annual expenditure was increasing, and the senior
VP of HR needed to stem the trend. We formed a small cross-
functional team. An analysis of expenditures and targeted interviews
revealed that the HR directors that comprised the core leadership team
were not leading strategically when managing the company’s supple-
mental workforce. From an enterprise perspective, the use of manage-
ment consulting ﬁrms was too disconnected. The cross-functional team
developed a policy and protocol that were supported and reinforced
through executive coaching and team workshops. The objective was to
change three things regarding the performance of the HR directors:
1. To change their perspective, to focus on the enterprise rather than
on the business segment;
2. To widen factors they considered, expanding their level of analysis
beyond strictly local considerations; and
3. To improve the questions they asked, making them savvier when
sourcing/contracting management consulting ﬁrms, with an appre-
ciation of these considerations.
212
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 213
This approach, in short, led the HR directors to lead more
strategically. They broadened their perspective and learned to focus
on the bigger picture, recognized connections and interdependencies,
and acted in a manner that was more aligned and uniﬁed with fellow
HR directors throughout the company. The change was dramatic,
resulting in millions of dollars in savings.
In many situations like this, we have found that strategic leadership
can be learned. We have seen leaders dramatically increase their impact
after reﬂecting on their actions and mental models. We have seen
the “aha!” moments when our graduate students realize how to
effectively apply the tools of strategic management. We have talked
with leaders who come to see things that they now appreciate after
years of failing to recognize the nuances of leading organizations in a
strategic manner.
After working with thousands of these leaders and students, we
have identiﬁed a collection of skills that strategic leaders possess.
Competencies of the Strategic Leader
From our experience, the underlying competencies essential to strategic
leadership fall into two categories:
■
Core competencies are fundamental to all types of strategic leadership.
They appear consistently in the successful individuals we have
proﬁled in this book and in the hundreds of others we surveyed.
■
Applied competencies are speciﬁc to one of the four types of strategic
leadership. The relevance of these competencies varies based on
the style of leadership chosen or on the requirements of a given
situation, and they are demonstrated by the leaders we examined
who exhibited each type.
Intotal,theyrepresent15competencies—3 core and12applied.All
15 can be learned through a combination of intentional focus, training,
and experience.

Applying the Competencies That Enable Strategic Leadership
The three core competences we identify—systems thinking, decision
making, and managing risk—reﬂect the essential combination of
leadership and strategic thinking. In our class, we teach our students
to apply these concepts using several classic case studies. Each real-
world case represents a very different organization and circumstance:
■
A U.S. retail giant—Best Buy—executing a transition in their sales
strategy,1
■
A nonproﬁt—the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepre-
neurship—facing challenges scaling their organization,2
■
A global pharmaceutical company—Wyeth—attempting to
deploy an integrated IT platform,3 and
■
Two consumer goods marketers—Newell and Rubbermaid—
attempting to grow their combined sales following a merger.4
In discussing these cases with our graduate students over the course
of many years, we have found that they provide a basis for bringing
each skill to life. They also provide a very practical basis for talking
about the opportunities—and challenges—to applying general con-
cepts to real-world circumstances. Often it is the comparison of how a
single concept is applied in these four settings that illuminates them,
drawing out the similarities and differences that emerge.
Systems Thinking
Recognizing patterns is perhaps the most essential ability we will
discuss in this book. We introduced systems thinking in Chapter 1 as a
body of research that informs our understanding of strategic thinking.
Bobby Duby, a hunter, illustrated systems thinking in action by
recognizing the patterns of Mother Nature, the animals he tracked,
and the art of hunting that he perfected. Bobby learned to hunt by
214

3GC06

2:43:40
Page 215
applying systems thinking to these patterns, but how did he learn
systems thinking itself?
Mapping the systems and patterns around us is one way to be more
effective at seeing and understand them. By surfacing cause-and-effect
relationships, even in everyday activities, we can reﬂect on the
relationships that we observe. Kaplan and Norton5 noted the value
of this exercise in developing their approach to strategy maps. A
strategy map requires a leader to deﬁne key objectives for a given
organization in each of four areas—ﬁnancial measures, customer
measures, business process measures, and organizational learning
measures—and then link those objectives together in cause-and-effect
relationships.
We ask our students to develop strategy maps for each of the four
cases in our class. The exercise forces them to demonstrate their
understanding of the case while exposing each student’s mental model
regarding that organization. As one example, a strategy map that our
students create for the consumer electronics retailer Best Buy will
typically include the following components:
■
Financial: Growth through increased sales and margin improve-
ment through better operating performance.
■
Customer: Brand differentiation through advertising and loyalty
through positive customer experiences.
■
Business process: Operational efﬁciency though supply chain
management and consumer proﬁle development through pur-
chasing data analysis.
■
Organizationallearning:Store-by-storeperformancedataprovided
to store managers and customer proﬁle training for sales associates.
After identifying these key metrics, we then ask our students to
map the relationships between them. This is where the systems and
mental models they exhibit are most clearly revealed. We ﬁnd that the
opinions within a single team can be wide ranging. Some teams see
business processes, such as supply chain management, as the primary

(or even only) driver of margin improvement. Others focus on the
value of organizational learning, noting that a well-trained manager
can dramatically increase in-store performance by gaining insights
from customer trends and store performance data.
Core Competencies of Strategic Leadership
■Systems Thinking: Recognizes relationships and interdepen-
dencies in a complex system or situation, including the ability to
anticipate the intended and unintended consequences of a given
action.
■Decision Making: Applies a structured approach to making
choices, including the ability to make a choice in a context
having multiple stakeholders.
■Managing Risk: Assesses opportunities and calculates risks,
taking steps to achieve the desired outcome in a manner that
exceeds the potential or actual risk.
Decision Making
Making choices is fundamental to leadership (if not to life!). Too
often, business texts and conventional wisdom make these choices
look simplistic. The right choice can appear rather clear in hindsight.
Few question the wisdom of famous decisions when reviewed after
the fact. But honest accounts of important decisions reveal that the
right answer was often not as clear at the time. In fact, sometimes the
choices themselves aren’t completely clear. Famous retailer Mont-
gomery Ward operated as a pioneering leader of mail order and
department store retail until its bankruptcy and eventual demise in
2000. While the competitive forces that overtook it are obvious in
broad terms, it is rather more difﬁcult to identify a single milestone in
its 128-year history as the deﬁnitive mistake that lead to its extinction.
In our class, the case of the National Foundation for Teach-
ing Entrepreneurship (NFTE) provides a similar decision-making
216
Leading with Strategic Thinking

2:43:40
Page 217
challenge. Founded in 1987, the organization faces a fundamental
choice in how to grow after its early success. Its options, prompted by
an offer of funding contingent on reﬁning its operating model, force a
choice between the organization’s freewheeling roots and a more
disciplined approach to governing the growing operation. The orga-
nization’s own entrepreneurial mission sets the choice in even more
stark terms—does it stick to the creative ethos it teaches students or
embrace more structure, as its increasing size seems to now require?
How does it decide which ventures to pursue and which to halt? How
does it preserve its organizational culture if it becomes less focused on
empowering the ideas of its staff—a historically important value?
The case frames a true dilemma, and one that offers no clear
indicators of which is right. In this, it provides a real test of strategic
leadership. It is also particularly useful because, for the purposes of our
class, there is no right answer. We are as interested in the rationale our
studentsoffer as the conclusionthey come to. While there isn’t a rightor
wrong answer, there is a better or worse approach to the decision. The
best teams consistently include several components in their chosen path:
■
Assumptions: What factors cannot be proven but are assumed to
be true? The best teams in our class focus on things that will have a
material impact on their ultimate choice and that, if not correct,
will change their ﬁnal decision. In the case of NFTE, key
assumptions can include the preferred funding model or the legal
status of the organization. If they elect to forgo the offer of their
major benefactor in favor of diversifying their revenue streams,
are less beholden to the requirements of a single stakeholder. If the
organization were to become a for-proﬁt enterprise, many of their
options would undoubtedly change. Either of these could be
stated as assumptions (i.e., “givens”) based on what is provided in
the case, and calling them out as such makes the relevance and
implications of each assumption more clear.
■
Options: What are the potential paths forward? This is the time
for creative thinking. The best teams get every idea out, no matter
how likely or outlandish. In the case of NFTE, are the two
Developing Strategic Leadership
217

3GC06

2:43:40
Page 218
choices presented—to stay loosely structured or to adopt a more
rigid organizational model—really the only ones? It’s worth
considering other business models or organization structures
beyond the binary options provided by the case. We’ve had
teams suggest spinning off parts of the organization or propose a
small incubator group as creative ideas.
■
Decision Criteria: What values, principles, or factors are most
critical to making the best decision? Here our teams often make
difﬁcult choices. Weighing the importance of staff sentiment is a
particularly tricky choice, as many joined NFTE due to its entre-
preneurial roots and culture. Financial constraints can also provide
very real requirements. The opinions of key stakeholders—the
NFTE’s primary benefactor in this case—should also be given
appropriate weight. Effective teams itemize as many criteria as
possible and then rank and weigh them to construct a decision-
making rubric.
■
Statement of Decision: What is the best path forward? In the end,
all ideas aren’t considered equal. After all of the criteria are
weighed and applied, the best path forward frequently becomes
very clear. That said, effective teams often take this as an
opportunity to reassess both the assumptions and the criteria.
After a structured review, the gut instinct of the team should still
be considered to validate or challenge the ultimate choice.
By taking a case like NFTE through these steps, our students
consistently report feeling more conﬁdent in their ﬁnal choice. They
realize that too often, real-world decisions don’t get this kind of rigor.
Practicing the steps of structured decision making provides a helpful
reminder of the key elements of an effective decision and the nuances
of applying them in a team environment.
Managing Risk
The ability to assess and manage risk ensures that the value of a chosen
strategy isn’t undermined by unexpected or undesired factors.

Prominent experts6 note that risk can surface in many forms, including
risks assumed as part of a chosen strategy (e.g., humans’ ﬁrst landing on
the moon in 1969), risks born of ﬂawed execution (e.g., BP’s
Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010), and risks external to but
nonetheless affecting the strategy (e.g., the impact of the 2011
earthquake and tsunami on Japan’s nuclear reactors). The key to
preventing or minimizing the harm done by such risks is to understand
and manage them accordingly.
Every case in our class involves some degree of risk. Unfort-
unately, not every team of students identiﬁes the risks. Many risks
surface in connection with the assumptions that teams document in
their decision-making process. “How conﬁdent are you in that
assumption?” can effectively draw these risks out for discussion.
The best assumptions reveal true strategy risks—the type of risks
inherent in a chosen strategy (again, like a moon landing). For many
years, we taught a case that focused on Research in Motion, the
makers of BlackBerry mobile devices, and their strategy for develop-
ing a tight engineering culture by co-locating all their engineers in
their corporate headquarters. After several years of debating the risks
and merits associated with concentrating all of their engineering
talent in Waterloo, Canada, the market intervened and gave its own
verdict. As the company’s product fell more and more behind the
competition from companies located in Silicon Valley and elsewhere,
the risks associated with having engineers disconnected from that
California hotbed of innovation became increasingly hard to ignore.
Needless to say, we stopped using the case as an example of strategic
thinking.
We make it very clear to our students that risk can’t be fully
eliminated. Creating something distinct and of unique value inher-
ently involves embracing a certain degree of risk that others avoid or
can’t successfully manage. Thus, the answer for each of the cases we
teach—and for leaders who wrestle with the challenges of real-life
risks—is to properly identify and categorize risks. Having done so,
decisions can then be made to avoid, manage, or offset each.

In another case we teach, the global pharmaceutical maker Wyeth
embarks on a strategy to develop a global technology infrastructure
that can better aid the ﬂow of information and resources across its
geographies and product lines. The team charged with this mandate
takes a decidedly “middle of the road” approach, introducing mean-
ingful change but avoiding stakeholders who aren’t supportive of the
investment. Our students are left to wrestle with the merits of this
approach: is the management of Wyeth practicing effective change
management by establishing early wins, or do they lack conviction?
Again, the best approach lies less in a student’s chosen answer and
more in the ability to apply sound thinking to identify the relevant
risks and articulate a consistent rationale for how to best deal with each
one.
As demonstrated by these two cases, our students gain valuable
insights and learn to apply strategic leadership to real-world exam-
ples by wrestling with the application of key concepts and tools. We
ﬁnd the same in our work consulting with executives and leadership
teams: helping leaders take a structured approach to their work can
make them more effective at managing the challenges of strategy
formation and strategy execution. They become more effective at
recognizing patterns and cause-effect relationships that surface
through systems thinking. They become better at making decisions
by adopting a structured approach that formalizes the assumptions,
options, criteria, and choices they make. And they become more
skillful at managing risks when they identify and categorize them
appropriately. In doing so, leaders can and do learn the fundamentals
of strategic leadership.
Applying the Competencies That Enable the Four Types
Having covered the three core competencies that are fundamental to
all strategic leadership, we now turn our attention to the competencies
that distinguish the four types of applied strategic leadership we
220
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 221
introduced in Chapter 2. From our work, we have identiﬁed the skills
and knowledge that consistently underlie what visionary, directive,
collaborative, and incubating leaders do. Each leadership type has
three unique competencies that surface regularly in our work, result-
ing in 12 of them. We will now walk through each of the four strategic
leadership types, highlighting how the skills and knowledge unique to
each are applied. In doing so, we’ll illustrate how they are commonly
learned.
Developing Visionary Leadership
The visionary leaders we have worked with demonstrate a unique
combination of abilities. Other people they work with also see these
leaders as uniquely talented. Our observations consistently surface
three key skills that visionary leaders require: creative thinking, self-
reliance, and the ability to inspire others.
Visionary Competencies
■Creative Thinking: Draws upon unique insight, often through
alternate methods of observation, to generate ideas that lead to
the creation of something new.
■Self-reliance: Draws on one’s own resources to achieve a given
objective, including being intentionally or unintentionally
reluctant to solicit assistance from others.
■Inspiring Others: Creates an environment likely to motivate
others by advocating a compelling vision or values.
Creative thinking is the spark that generates ideas. It is the insight
to identify an opportunity or a solution, and is often described to us in
discussions as “seeing what others don’t.” In some regard, it is similar
to the systems thinking we highlighted earlier—visionary leaders have
the ability to see and make connections in a unique way. Indeed, this
Developing Strategic Leadership
221

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 222
ability does draw on systems thinking as a key part of effective
creativity, in that patterns and combinations are often the building
blocks of developing vision. What distinguishes visionary leaders is the
ability to use those connections to generate new ideas. As noted in
Chapter 2, the earliest vision for what became the Kindle was the
combination of books and the “talking pictures” that pioneered
modern ﬁlm. As such, creative thinking is divergent in nature and
thus differs from convergent focus that uses patterns and connections
to narrow one’s focus (a skill we’ll see other leadership types demon-
strate later in our review).
As critical as creative thinking is, it alone isn’t enough. As we
illustrated in Chapter 2, lots of people had ideas about social networks
at the time that Mark Zuckerberg was working on Facebook. What
distinguished him from others was his ability to execute on that idea.
In doing so, we see Zuckerberg and other visionary leaders draw on
the other two key skills to turn ideas into reality—self-reliance and the
ability to inspire others. Importantly, they go together and emphasize
separate but complementary things.
Self-reliance is the skill of drawing on one’s self to make things
happen. It is the inner reserve of conﬁdence, conviction, and energy to
push the idea into reality. It is also the ability to decide when to take
things on personally rather than relying on others. It comes up often in
the discussions we have with people who have worked with visionary
leaders, and it is commonly part of the narrative of great visionaries in
literature and the popular press. Well-known individuals we’ve
referenced in this book, such as Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and Henry
Ford, had the ability to keep going and advance their vision even
when no one else believed in what they were trying to do. Each one of
them encountered challenges that would cause self-doubt in most
people, but each had the courage to press on.
Inspiring others, in contrast, is the skill of drawing on others to
make things happen. We see visionary leaders do this primarily
through their ability to motivate. They get people excited. They
build conviction. In our discussions with the team at Indiegogo, Head
222
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 223
of Customer Happiness Erica Labovitz said of the CEO, “He always
told this story about what fund-raising and economics would look like
in 10, 20, 30 years and how Indiegogo was going to play a part in that.
Every time he told that story, it was like the lightbulb went off with
people in the room. And that, to me, was his biggest moment as a
leader. It gave us the road map for the company.”7 This example
illustrates a common approach that visionary leaders take in using their
skill to inspire others—storytelling. Stories are a major way that
visionary leaders inspire others, but there are several others. They
can also draw on a sense of purpose, personal pride, and beating the
competition. The most effective leaders demonstrate that this skill
involves knowing which works best in a given situation and shows
that the ability to inspire involves knowing what stakeholders care
about.
Interestingly, the way visionary leaders and these three skills are
often described to us reveals a deep assumption: that they can’t be
learned. While this isn’t stated overtly, visionary leaders are often
referred to as “gifted” or having been born with their unique abilities.
This harks back to the early trait theories of leadership that we referred
to in Chapter 1—the historical assumption that great leaders are born,
not made. The comparison is useful here, because just as the research on
leadership has debunked this belief, our own experience and teaching
demonstrates that visionary leadership can, in fact, be learned. By
focusing on developing the three core skills of visionary leadership—
creative thinking, self-reliance, inspiring others—we’ve seen leaders
become more effective at developing and executing their vision.
Breaking down visionary leadership into these three skills demystiﬁes
it, revealing fundamental components that are easily learned.
We once worked with an executive who took responsibility for a
struggling business facing industrywide decline. Historically a high-
margin growth business, the sector had matured, and now several large
competitors faced a war for market share and declining proﬁts. This
wasn’t the kind of environment where one would expect visionary
leadership to be necessary, and indeed the leader was chosen for his
Developing Strategic Leadership
223

Page 224
proven track record as an operator rather than his ability to inspire.
Surprisingly, in working with him to assess options, it became clear
that visionary leadership was, in fact, central to his success. The
leadership team and staff he inherited had all the technical and
operational ability they needed to succeed, having grown up within
the business. They’d also proven their ability to adapt, having spent
several years focusing on the streamlining and process efﬁciency
typical to a competitive market. What they lacked was the motivation
to press on. The constant discussion of the business’s decline, its dim
prospects, and the competitive threats weighed heavily on them.
These factors also overshadowed the fact that this business remained a
core holding of the parent company and an essential source for
revenue and client relationships that other operating units depended
on. What was needed was a new vision that would articulate that
opportunity as a rallying point to inspire the troops.
This was a daunting task for the executive, who hadn’t faced that
task in the past and wasn’t seen as particularly inspiring by his team.
What he did have was a willingness to learn—the critical prerequisite
and the entry point through which we began to work with him to
take on this new challenge. This involved spending considerable time
in one-on-one dialogue and coaching. It involved discussions of
how best to expand and to articulate the seed of opportunity he
had identiﬁed—the vision of his business as an asset to the company
and an enabler of strong client relationships. These discussions guided
and stretched his creative thinking. What were the patterns and
relationships that could deﬁne success in this new context? How
could it be articulated? It also involved discussions about his own
ability to drive change. From which of his personal experiences could
he draw courage in the face of this new challenge? How could he use
those experiences to build conﬁdence in what he needed to do? Last,
we discussed how to inspire and rally the troops. What aspects of this
new vision would they see as fresh and exciting? What clues did his
knowledge of his team as colleagues give him about how to motivate
them, both as individuals and as members of a team?

Page 225
This coaching was the primary vehicle for his development as a
visionary leader, and we ﬁnd that coaching and dialogue is often the
best vehicle for developing these types of skills. It also drew out the
lessons from his prior experience, a second source of learning critical to
improving as a visionary leader. These are skills developed in the ﬁeld
and from practice more than in the classroom.
Developing Directive Leadership
Effective directive leaders master a set of skills that help them drive
strategy through process and structure. They take charge, whether
through formal authority or through power given to them by others
who recognize their ability to get results. The three skills we see
consistently among directive leaders are critical thinking, planning and
organizing, and motivation.
Director Competencies
■Critical Thinking: Uses relevant, credible, broad-based informa-
tion to create hypotheses, evaluate options, and draw conclusions.
■Planning and Organizing: Structures somewhat or exceptionally
complicated situations by deﬁning roles, rules, and processes that
increase the likelihood of short- and long-term success.
■Motivation: Uses a combination of incentives to create focus and
draw out the discretionary efforts of others toward a speciﬁed
goal.
Critical thinking is the ability to form judgments from relevant
information. These judgments can come in the form of hypotheses,
priorities, or conclusions. One might see this as very similar to the
decision-making competency we highlighted earlier, but we make a
distinction between critical thinking and other forms of decision
making. While directive leaders obviously need to be skilled at making
Developing Strategic Leadership
225

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 226
decisions—as do all four types of leaders—they also need to be good at
other types of judgment. Is a particular opportunity worth pursuing
before we have enough data to be certain? Which of several available
options are more important than others? Should someone be trusted
with a decision or responsibility? Finding the best answer to these
questions doesn’t ﬁt the logical process we introduced in this chapter,
but it does involve applying critical thinking. Those we see practicing
critical thinking effectively are good at ﬁnding and using the right
evidence to answer a particular question and then determining the
right framework to come to an appropriate judgment.
Planning and organizing is a skill that is easily observed in directive
leaders. While it is sometimes difﬁcult to identify effective critical
thinking, organized leaders are relatively easy to distinguish from their
less organized counterparts. The skill is manifest in a wide variety of
activities critical to the role of the directive leader: deﬁning roles on a
leadership team, setting out objectives in a planned and purposeful
manner, and ensuring that information is shared among relevant
parties. Leaders who are effective at planning and organizing typically
take a methodical, process-driven approach to their work. They also
hold others accountable to do the same. This is apparent in many of
the key actions of directive leaders that we identiﬁed in Chapter 2,
such as establishing governance and monitoring performance. While
skilled directive leaders aren’t limited to linear thinking, they do
demonstrate strength in applying a certain type of logic that often
manifests in an attention to process and structure.
Motivation is the third skill we see as critical to the directive type
of leader. It is similar to the visionary leader’s skill at inspiring others
but not identical. Inspiration is one form that motivation can take, but
the directive leader applies a wider range of motivational techniques to
drive performance and inﬂuence others. This is because directive
leaders focus on different things. As we outlined in Chapter 2,
the directive leader’s focus is on building a system that serves as
the structure for both strategy formation and strategy execution. That
system can inspire the team at one point, but the team also needs to
226
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 227
exercise discretion at times. The motivation created through reward
systems is a particularly useful example of the relevance of this skill.
How do we reward desired behavior? How do we discourage
undesirable behavior? How do we anticipate and avoid unintended
consequences of incentives? Leaders who use a directive approach take
ownership for ﬁnding the right answers to these kinds of questions and
thus need to be skilled in doing so.
The good news is that these three skills are highly teachable, and
much of that teaching can be handled in easy ways. You can see it
taking place in MBA classes and corporate leadership development
programs offered by countless schools and large companies. Books are
another viable source for learning the basics of these three skills (and
we hope this book is a relevant example of that!). This is particularly
true because many of the skills of the directive leadership type are
about applying systems and frameworks. For example, numerous tools
like the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)
analysis, Force Field Analysis, and the Growth-Share Matrix are
available to aid in critical thinking. While the list of available tools
is nearly endless and their relevance depends highly on the situation,
you’ll ﬁnd several suggested options that we have found to be useful in
the Resources section of this book.
To provide an example, one of the most popular exercises in our
graduate class every term is one called “the hot dog exercise.” We use
it to teach students to apply Generic Strategies, one of the most well-
known frameworks for deﬁning competitive advantage.8 For the
exercise, we break the class into four teams and assign each team
one of Porter’s generic strategies:
■
Cost Leadership: The pursuit of a mass-market audience, attracting
customers using the lowest cost available. Walmart is a common
example.
■
Differentiation: The pursuit of mass-market audiences, attracting
customers using special features perceived as providing extra
value. Target is a common example.

227

■
Cost Focus: The pursuit of a narrowly deﬁned consumer demo-
graphic, providing cost advantages of particular value to that
demographic. IKEA is a common example.
■
Differentiation Focus: The pursuit of a narrowly deﬁned con-
sumer demographic, providing features of unique value to that
demographic. Tiffany & Co. is a common example.
Having reviewed the concept and assigned strategic positions to
small teams of students, we make each team responsible for developing
a business plan for a particular product: the Chicago-style hot dog.
(Note: Given the international composition of our class, we some-
times spend as much time explaining the hot dog as we do Porter’s
framework. Put simply, it’s a traditional hot dog served on a sesame
seed bun and garnished with chopped onions, tomato slices, peppers, a
large pickle, mustard, bright green pickle relish, and no ketchup.) Each
team is asked to address several key questions in their business plan:
What is their product? What is their price point? How will they
market their product? What is their organization’s structure? How will
they motivate their staff? What are their critical business processes?
What are their key performance indicators?
The creativity of our students is evident in the range of ideas
they’ve produced over the years:
■
Hot dog stands targeting patrons of late-night bars, a clever
example of differentiation focus.
■
A technology to order hot dogs from your phone at baseball
games. Notably, this was a concept they identiﬁed well before
the advent of smartphones and the apps that now do exactly that.
■
Flash-frozen, all-in-one products offered in the freezer aisle in
grocery stories. We’ve never been sure we’d try these ourselves,
but we’ve acknowledged the team’s ability to apply their chosen
“low-cost” strategic positioning with conviction.
■
Branded Chicago hot dogs, using the broad popularity of the
Blues Brothers and other Chicago icons to expand product
awareness beyond its traditional regional market.

As they then elaborate on their product strategies, we ask them to
avoid detailed ﬁnancial models, instead encouraging them to be very
clear on how their business will operate. In their responses, we ﬁnd
that some teams focus on R&D or technology while others invest in
capabilities around branding or supply chain management. This
highlights a key principle of Generic Strategies: advantages in market
position go to those who out-execute competitors with a similar
strategic focus. Those with a cost focus need to out-execute all other
players on cost, being very good at delivering a low-cost product and
avoiding temptations to stray into activities like advertising that
undermine their efﬁciency.
In making these decisions, our students learn something beyond
Porter’s framework—they’re practicing the skills of being a directive
leader. By making them accountable to develop and execute the
strategy, they are assigned the responsibilities that many leaders ﬁnd
themselves in. They are applying critical thinking by making a series of
judgment calls and solving various problems. By focusing them on
how they will operationalize their ideas, we are making them practice
the core skills of planning and organizing. By asking them how they’ll
build a team and incentivize their staff, we’re making them address
issues of motivation. This relatively simple simulation integrates many
aspects of practicing directive leadership.
Developing Incubating Leadership
Incubating leaders draw on a set of skills that are rather different than
those we just discussed for directive leaders. While the directive leader
personally drives strategy formation and execution, the incubating
leader lends support to the strategic work of others. In doing so, they
draw on very different competencies. From our experience, the three
most important skills to the incubating leadership type are evaluative
thinking, valuing and leveraging diversity, and sponsoring.
Developing Strategic Leadership
229

Incubator Competencies
■Evaluative Thinking: Explores assumptions, expectations, and
requirements of clients and customers; monitors existing and
emerging technologies, products, and services; and applies those
criteria to assess opportunities for meeting or exceeding current
or emerging needs.
■Valuing and Leveraging Diversity: Draws unique insight from
varied and dissimilar viewpoints and perspectives, and applies
strong points and positive elements and features to ideas,
contingencies, remedies, and solutions.
■Sponsoring: Takes actions to support the success of individuals
or projects by providing needed resources, offering feedback or
advice to improve success, and advocating to build support
among other relevant stakeholders.
As we noted in Chapter 2, a key action of incubating leaders is that
they are very good at assessing situations, opportunities, and people by
drawing on evaluative thinking. Evaluative thinking is a concept that
has received attention in recent years, given the rise of evaluation and
testing in many academic settings. In a presentation to the American
Evaluation Association, researchers from Cornell University deﬁned
evaluative thinking as “a cognitive process, in the context of evalua-
tion, motivated by inquisitiveness and a belief in the value of evidence,
which involves:
1. Identifying assumptions,
2. Posing thoughtful questions,
3. Pursuing deeper understanding through reﬂection and perspective
taking, and
4. Making informed decisions in preparation for action.”9
Their description has notable similarities to our deﬁnition of
decision making presented earlier in this chapter. What distinguishes
evaluative thinking from the decision-making skill required of all
230
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:40
Page 231
strategic leaders is their mention of thoughtful questions and perspec-
tive taking. Incubating leaders evaluate the ideas and actions of others.
In doing so, they take an “outside in” perspective in their thinking.
They are not a part of the team, as other leaders typically are, but rather
are judging the merit as someone with an outside, objective perspec-
tive. In this context, asking good questions is a critical skill. Is this idea
likely to succeed or fail? Does the individual or team have the ability to
execute on their plan? Do other competing ideas or stakeholders risk
undermining the likely success of this team? Targeted questions,
relevant to a given context, help the incubating leader effectively
evaluate a given situation or opportunity.
Valuing and leveraging diversity is the second critical skill for
incubating leaders. While incubating leaders are effective at evalua-
tion, they also appreciate and cultivate the unique ideas and abilities of
others. Given the incubating leader’s role in supporting others, they
are less effective if they discount or fail to understand views that do not
match their own. In her book, The Loudest Duck, Laura Liswood
describes a 2008 initiative at Goldman Sachs to identify, educate, and
mentor women in developing countries. Empowering these women
was an obvious case of incubating leadership—it focused on equipping
the women to participate in business activities from which they had
been historically excluded in their communities. Empowering these
women involved learning enough to understand the needs they had
and the challenges they faced due to their traditional social status. This
required the skill of valuing and leveraging diversity, as the sponsors at
Goldman needed to understand an experience and worldview that
were very different from their own. Appreciating these challenges
made the Goldman program leaders better able to target the assistance
that would be most beneﬁcial to these women.10
Our third competency, sponsoring, naturally complements the
ﬁrst two. Sponsorship is the skill of aiding in the success of an initiative
or an individual. It is applied in a wide range of contexts. Executives
sponsor projects in organizations; leaders sponsor other, less experi-
enced leaders to accelerate career growth; and angel investors sponsor

startups through investment of capital and advice. After the incubating
leader has used evaluative thinking to determine where to invest their
attention and resources and then has applied the skill of understanding
the value that can be created by those with diverse perspectives, they
increase the success that value can achieved by practicing effective
sponsorship. This skill entails deciding both where and how to best
provide support. It draws on the same skill set that effective coaches
demonstrate—they identify gaps in performance and then take mea-
sures to close those gaps. A colleague of ours, Nichole Barnes-
Marshall, has experience developing this skill in executives. As the
global head of inclusion and diversity at Aon plc, Nichole has designed
and managed sponsorship programs that help executives be more
effective at growing the next generation of leaders to prepare them as
viable successors for large jobs. In this work, she sees why they succeed
as well as why they struggle. In observing these skills at work, Nichole
says, “Sponsorship is a set of actions, but it’s important to also see it as a
skill. Coaching others to succeed and knowing when to take action on
their behalf doesn’t come naturally to some executives who might
have achieved their own success without being self-aware of how they
got there. Leaders don’t always recognize the way their actions create
or undermine other leaders. Being effective at sponsoring means
knowing when and how to take action on someone else’s behalf.”11
Developing as an incubating leader is all about practice. Effective
use of the three skills we’ve highlighted is difﬁcult without a certain
amount of accumulated experience. This is largely because each skill
requires a particular type of pattern recognition that comes from
seeing many situations and drawing out the relevant themes from that
experience. In our conversations with venture capitalists, this was a
consistent theme. By observing hundreds of businesses and entrepre-
neurs, they gained an improved sense of what constitutes a good
opportunity. Our discussions with Liam Krehbiel, CEO of a nonproﬁt
venture capital ﬁrm called A Better Chicago, reinforced this. Liam had
made intentional moves early in his career to begin accumulating the
experience and ﬁrsthand knowledge he knew he needed: “I had spent
232

time in nonproﬁts before going to business school. My trajectory was
all about bouncing back and forth between for-proﬁts and nonproﬁts.
I started off as an investment banker, then went to New York and
spent four years in the nonproﬁt sector, then went to business school,
and then started this. I went to business school and then to Bain
[Capital] as a way to accelerate my growth.”12
If experience is the critical element for developing these skills, what
can be done to intentionally improve as an incubating leader? Acceler-
ating the collection of experiences is a practical and common way we
see this done. As we described in Chapter 2, networking is one of the
top activities that incubating leaders practice. While there are many
reasons why these leaders actively network, the ability to gain insight
from a wide range of people and situations is a major beneﬁt. With this
in mind, learning from experience as an incubating leader is often more
about “dipping into” a subject or group than it is about gaining deep
experiences. In fact, we’ve observed that being too deep in a given ﬁeld
or team can actually hurt an incubating leader’s effectiveness. Devel-
oping the skills to be an incubating leader is about balancing a trade off
between breadth and depth, with a bias toward the former.
Developing Collaborative Leadership
Collaborative leaders draw on a set of skills that are rooted in partner-
ship. Collaborative leaders partner with others as advisors, colleagues,
and allies. In doing so, we’ve observed them drawing on three skills
unique to this strategic leadership type: synthetic thinking, active
listening, and relationship management.
Collaborative Competencies
■Synthetic Thinking: Integrates separate, independent, and un-
related ideas, concepts, and/or frameworks to form a new and
unique point of view or idea.
(continued )

233

(continued )
■Active Listening: Establishing mutual understanding between
two or more parties by identifying, articulating, and verifying
the statements and beliefs of others.
■Relationship Management: Works with another individual or a
group to jointly achieve a speciﬁed result.
Synthetic thinking emphasizes the development of ideas and
insights from existing concepts. Effective collaborative leaders are
particularly adept at building on the ideas of others. This may come in
the form of translating one goal into another, related goal, as the leader
of a business division does when working with their counterparts. It
can come in the form of new insights into an existing goal, as in the
advice provided by a trusted advisor. It can also come in the form of a
mutual goal, as in the case of two companies that decide to partner in
the marketplace. In each case, synthetic thinking aids in the identiﬁ-
cation and the development of the opportunity—and both activities
are key. Opportunity identiﬁcation is rather similar to the pattern
recognition we identiﬁed in our earlier deﬁnition of systems thinking,
but opportunity development is different in that it is about using the
ideas of others as building blocks. This act of creating—indeed, co-
creation—is at the heart of the skill. Using our example in Chapter 3
of Brian’s product, Google Takeout, the team developed the idea for
Takeout from a combination of inputs: their observations regarding
existing Google products, their understanding of Google’s broader
business and values, and their own experience in helping individual
product owners make data more portable for users. This is an excellent
example of synthetic thinking in action.
We used active listening in Chapter 2 as the label for a speciﬁc
technique to conﬁrm the mutual understanding between two parties.
Here we have chosen to use it again as a label for the more general
skill. Indeed, in our interviews, people often used this term to describe
234
Leading with Strategic Thinking

3GC06
03/10/2015
2:43:41
Page 235
what they generally considered simply to be effective listening. We
ﬁnd this revealing, and we think it is a meaningful distinction beyond
just being a point of emphasis. The term and technique gained
popularity in the 1970s as a variety of practitioners brought concepts
from psychotherapy to other settings, including the workplace.13
Practiced well, active listening commonly involves repeating a state-
ment back to another person to conﬁrm what was said. It demonstrates
both understanding and empathy, conveying that “I heard what you
had to say, and I acknowledge it is important.” We ﬁnd this useful
because it reinforces the importance of mutual understanding that
underlies successful partnerships. Great collaborative leaders hear what
others say, and, more importantly, they hear what they mean. They
demonstrate this understanding in the ways that they talk and behave,
and in doing so they build a mutual commitment. In the best
circumstances, this can be a direct contributor to establishing trust.
While trust isn’t easily codiﬁed as a skill, it is essential to effective
partnerships, and it is often cited in our interviews and in relevant
literature as being enabled by active listening.
Collaboration, our ﬁnal skill, is perhaps obvious, given that it is
also used as our label for this type of leadership. Even so, it deserves
special attention. Collaboration is a unique skill and a challenge for
some leaders who are more accustomed to acting autonomously.
Indeed, some make the mistake of not really recognizing collaboration
as leadership at all. It does have some overlap with “teamwork,” a skill
commonly expected in most organizations and jobs today, but the skill
we see demonstrated by collaborative leaders goes beyond mere
teamwork. Having developed insight through synthetic thinking,
and having established mutual trust through the practice of active
listening, collaboration is the primary way that these leaders move
things forward. They are highly proactive, inclined to ask broader
questions and step up to lead in ambiguous situations. They are at
times provocative, challenging colleagues and their team to consider
or do new things. In doing so, they are constantly mindful of bringing

others along. Whereas a visionary leader is adept at articulating a bold
vision that compels others to move along but rarely makes an effort to
accommodate or understand those who disagree, a collaborative
leader makes sure critical stakeholders have bought in and are pulling
together. They pay attention to group dynamics and adjust their style
to enable the kind of collaboration required in the moment. Collab-
oration is an inherently social skill.
From our experience, synthetic thinking, active listening, and
collaboration are very much learned skills. They come naturally to
some more than others, but we’ve repeatedly seen leaders adapt and
grow as collaborative leaders. Like many learned skills, this is best
accomplished by applying a speciﬁc skill in a controlled environment.
Indeed, simulations are a powerful way to learn these core skills in a
way that complements the traditional learning methods of teaching.
At Aon, we develop our leaders in exactly this way. As a professional
services ﬁrm that advises and serves the world’s most successful compa-
nies, Aon sees collaborative leadership as critical to our consultants’
developing strong relationships with clients based on trust, insight, and a
drive to achieve mutually beneﬁcial results. We teach this to leaders
through a program we call the Client Service Model, or CSM. The
three-day experience is rooted in a realistic case study. CSM participants
(referred to as “delegates”) receive detailed brieﬁng materials on the
ﬁctional company, which they are expected to review before the
program. Once they arrive, delegates are quickly thrown into a
challenging series of meetings with key client contacts and new stake-
holders. They are expected to synthesize information they glean
through prereading along with what they discover through discussion
and questions. The third day culminates in a meeting with the ﬁctional
CEO, in which delegates are given a chance to propose a solution to
help the organization integrate another company that they have
recently acquired. Signiﬁcant investment is made into the quality
and impact of the program. The most senior executives of the ﬁrm
spend time teaching in these sessions, coaching the delegates and also
playing characters in the simulation. A centerpiece of this program is the
236

Page 237
emphasis placed on feedback. Delegates are advised to expect more
feedback in the program than they’ve ever received before. Facilitators
moderate debrieﬁngs after each module of the simulation, and each
delegate provides one-on-one feedback to peers in small-group settings
after they meet with the mock client.
The elements of this program are typical of simulations used to
teach these skills, but they are by no means the only way they can be
learned. Elements of this particular program reﬂect the key aspects of
learning through practice—intentional self-awareness, the opportu-
nity to apply the speciﬁc skill in a range of situations, and the ability to
receive feedback from an observer focused on providing targeted
advice. Each of these can be integrated into the routines of daily work,
and we often advise leaders to identify a mentor or coach with whom
they can work to do so.
Organization and Individual Development
We’ve now reviewed all 15 competencies of strategic leadership—the
three core competencies and the three applied competencies unique
to each strategic leadership type. We also highlighted some of the most
effective ways to develop each competency, drawn from our expe-
rience teaching and advising leaders to improve. For those interested
in developing personally or in improving the effectiveness of your
organization, we close with some thoughts on developing strategic
leadership.
Many of the thoughts we’ll share here are in the form of questions.
Questions are a frequent topic among our graduate students, as they
come to realize that a well-formed question is one of the most
powerful tools they can have as a leader. A good question can do
many things: raise unexplored issues, focus the discussion of an
individual or a group, challenge the status quo, or ensure that current
thinking is well formed and complete. We raise questions here with all
of those possibilities in mind.

Developing Organizations
For some, developing strategic leadership is a matter of building
organizational capability. Do we have the leaders we need? Do our
leaders have the skills and a leadership style that is best suited to the
strategy we will pursue? How widely do we need this skill in our
workforce? These broad questions raise ways that the concepts in this
book can be applied to make an organization more effective.
The complexity of developing organizations is a topic in and of
itself. There are ofﬁce shelves full of books on this issue, and we will
not do justice to the broad topic here. Instead, we’ve suggested several
texts that we ﬁnd particularly insightful in the Resources section.
With that in mind, we’ll take the opportunity to highlight a few key
considerations that we’ve often found to be both pivotal and useful as
we’ve advised leaders and built organizations ourselves.
Deﬁning What’s Required
Throughout this book, we emphasize that the four types of strategic
leadership are often integrated and overlap when applied. Likewise,
individuals can and do easily move between them. That said, at times
the organization’s overarching strategy or its environmental circum-
stance does, in fact, mean there is a “right” approach. Identifying these
requirements is fundamental to developing the right kind of strategic
leadership in an organization.
From our experience, what makes a particular type of strategic
leadership appropriate can be driven by several potential factors, includ-
ing industry, market position, or organizational culture. In a 2012 article
in Harvard Business Review, three consultants from Boston Consulting
Group summarized an analysis of over 120 countries to identify the best
way to manage strategic planning, given industry characteristics.14 They
found that industry volatility was a major factor in selecting the right
approach.Ina similar vein,ourcolleagues atAonHewitthavepublished

research that identiﬁes the unique cultural characteristics of high-
performing companies with a particularly competitive strategy. Orga-
nizations with customer-centric strategies were most successful when
they had an action-oriented culture, while cost-leadership strategies
were most effective when they were enterprise focused and collabora-
tive.15 Deﬁning the right application of strategic leadership for a given
organization is an important point of consideration.
Building Organizational Capability
Another decision point is how widely held the skill set of strategic
thinking should be within the organization. While strategic planning
or strategy development is often compartmentalized in an ofﬁcer’s
positionor a team,the skill of strategicleadership isn’t so easily conﬁned.
In one regard, we suggest that strategic leadership be as widely
disseminated as possible. The type of leadership and strategic thinking
we’ve outlined here is broadly applicable. The impact that can come
from an individual demonstrating leadership is often meaningful
wherever it is manifest in an organization. Likewise, strategic thinking
makes the leader’s impact more targeted and thus more likely to create
value. On the other hand, the investment required to build strategic
leadership means it is best viewed like any other potential investment.
Developing leaders to be more strategic should generate easily
measured beneﬁts.
With that in mind, we advocate a two-part approach for those
looking to identify how and where to develop strategic leadership:
1. Identify the speciﬁc areas where value is created in the organiza-
tion. Where do strategy formation and strategy execution take
place? Are leaders exercising a type of leadership best suited to their
mandate? Will the next generation of leaders have the skills they
need to face the future, or are they likely to just emulate what
worked in the past?

2. Beyond those targeted teams or individuals, consider how the
general capabilities of the organization can be enhanced through
greater leadership and more strategic thinking. How would
strategic leadership inﬂuence and improve the performance of
key employee populations? How can it help better deﬁne what
high performance looks like?
These questions will help frame how you think about an organi-
zation and how well it encourages individuals to be leaders who think
and act strategically.
Building Individual Capability
The topic of leadership is an opportunity to discuss expectations. As
we highlighted in Chapter 1, thinking on the subject of leadership has
evolved considerably over time. Likewise, the discussion of leadership
has become more comprehensive in organizations and teams. It’s now
rather common for management teams to talk about both “what”
needs to be accomplished and “how” it can be done most effectively.
These discussions can set expectations and deﬁne norms both among
executives and for the organization that they lead. We think this is
healthy.
Finding the right person for a new position, assignment, or project
is the best time for these issues to be raised, as it’s when the options are
all open. In these cases, we like to start with the end in mind—what
would success ideally look like in this role? Including both the “what”
outcomes (e.g., customer satisfaction, ﬁnancial performance) and the
“how” outcomes (e.g., with a spirit of collaboration within the team)
can ensure that expectations are clear and shared from the start.
Helping incumbents lead more strategically can come in many
forms. It can involve coaching, formal training, increased exposure to
new experiences, or taking on new responsibilities. A great way to
develop many of the skills we’ve identiﬁed here is placing a proven
240

Page 241
leader into a new and unfamiliar context. In larger organizations, one
of the most powerful developmental experiences is a rotation from
customer-facing roles to a corporate or shared services role. This
change in responsibility typically requires a very different focus,
organizational perspective, and action. It can often involve applying
a different type of strategic leadership as well. Our review of the
competencies earlier in this chapter can provide additional ideas for
developing a speciﬁc skill.
Developing as a Leader
Anyone reading this book can apply the concepts and principles we
have introduced to their own work as a leader. As we have reiterated
many times, leadership—and the speciﬁc types of strategic leadership
we’ve deﬁned here—can be applied regardless of role. That said, one
must decide how to properly apply strategic leadership. When
considering your own approach, consider several questions:
■
What is the best way to accomplish your intended outcomes?
■
How can you best draw upon your experiences and strengths?
■
How ready are your colleagues or your team to lead (or follow)?
■
If applied, how might each strategic leadership type affect
outcomes?
Thesequestionscan helpdetermine the bestwaytoinﬂuenceresults
and outcomes. In addition to ﬁnding the most appropriate approach to
leading in a given situation, looking for opportunities to apply a
different leadership type is also a useful exercise. We’ve consistently
observed that the most effective leaders are the ones who are versatile
and can adapt, and this ability to adapt is itself a skill that can be practiced
and learned.
If you choose to try a type of leadership that’s different from the
one(s) you have applied in the past, we encourage you to enroll

someone else in your effort. Asking someone you regularly work with
and trust to be an observer and provide candid feedback can give you
added insight on your impact. We’ve watched a seasoned leader take
this approach with a trusted protégé, using the opportunity to create a
dialogue that made her more effective while also giving her likely
successor added insight into the job and the challenges it entailed.
Case in Point: GE’s Crotonville
GE was one of the four organizations that we highlighted in Chapter 1,
noting their distinct and well-recognized approach to strategy and
leadership. In addition to those strengths, GE is also notable for their
approach to developing strategic leaders. In November 2014, GE was
ranked ﬁrst in Aon Hewitt’s latest study examining the relationship
between leadership practices and ﬁnancial results.16 Given this distinc-
tion, it’s worth looking more closely at what they do well.
About Aon Hewitt’s Top Companies for Leaders Study
Since 2001, Aon Hewitt has conducted research on the link
between leadership practices and ﬁnancial results. Their research
database contains information on over 2,300 companies span-
ning 40 countries. These ﬁndings have been published in a series
of research reports, and each report has been accompanied by a
ranking of companies demonstrating the most effective leader-
ship practices. Rankings are presented both globally and by
region.
In 2014, Aon Hewitt’s latest study found that top companies
shared ﬁve key characteristics in their leadership approach:
■Assessment: When it comes to building leaders, top com-
panies assess the whole leader early in their careers. This
242

3GC06

Page 243
includes evaluating leaders’ experiences, competencies, val-
ues, and organizational ﬁt. This helps organizations under-
stand the unique needs of their talent pipeline to fuel the
right development solutions that move people forward
faster.
■Awareness: Top companies have leaders who demonstrate
tremendous self-awareness by understanding their personal
strengths and weaknesses and using this information to
become more effective leaders.
■Resilience: In today’s unpredictable environment, top com-
panies build resilience in their leaders by creating inclusive
cultures where multiple perspectives and ideas are expected
and fostered to help the organization meet continued
business challenges.
■Engaging Leadership: Organizations leading the way focus
on identifying and building engaging leaders who are
stabilizers, demonstrate versatility, and stay connected to
people and events inside and outside their organization.
■Sustainability: Aon Hewitt Top Companies for Leaders
focus on building talent programs nimble enough to
respond quickly to the market demands, yet sustainable
to deliver superior business outcomes.17
We had the opportunity to interview several individuals at GE
regarding their approach to developing leaders. These conversations
reinforced the ﬁndings from Aon Hewitt’s study. GE takes leadership
and leadership development very seriously; in fact, they consider both
to be deeply linked. As GE’s vice chairman John Rice stated, “We’ve
found that our best leaders are our best learners.”18 For that reason,
GE’s Crotonville Leadership Institute continues to play a central role
in the company, driving both how the company develops individuals
and its overall organizational capability.
To understand this, we spent time with Kimberly Kleiman-Lee, a
member of the team at Crotonville and the person responsible for GE’s
approach to senior executive and ofﬁcer development. Kimberly’s own

career with the company started in GE Healthcare, where she had
worked as a Six Sigma Black Belt. Her current work gave us insight into
both the rationale and methods behind GE’s success.
When asked about how GE teaches strategy, Kimberly spoke in
practical terms, describing it as “taking a thoughtful approach to
accomplish the things that matter.” She elaborated in describing both
the process and the qualitative aspects of developing strategic leaders:
At GE, teaching strategy is really about addressing both the science and the
art. The science behind our strategies is all the operating mechanisms that we
are well known for. The way we look at our talent strategy, for example, has
been known for decades as Session C. We have similar mechanisms that drive
our ﬁnancial strategy so that it’s well managed, routine, and predictable. We
have other operating rhythms to drive the future of our business, such as
Blueprint Reviews. The science is reﬂected in the systems and structures we
put in place that drive the things that matter to us, and we continue to
reimagine our approaches to keep them contemporary. The art behind it all is
really expressed in the way leaders apply their practical learning.19
In calling out both the science and the art, we see GE as taking a
very holistic approach to teaching strategic leadership. In doing so,
they overcome the barriers that some organizations encounter when
looking at strategy as an analytical exercise divorced from the practical
activities of leadership. Furthermore, we observe GE applying this
holistic view in sophisticated ways that target both individual leaders
and the overall capability of GE as an organization.
GE’s holistic approach to developing individuals is evident in
their Executive Development Course (EDC), one of Crotonville’s
longest-standing programs. EDC is a blended program involving
both formal study in the classroom and targeted experiences outside
the classroom, which complement those studies and allow partici-
pating executives to apply what they are learning. These experiences
can be dramatic and impactful. In 2013, 22 executives in the program
went to Africa for three weeks to study the challenge of maternal and

infant mortality. Sponsored by GE Healthcare and GE Africa, the
team was asked to develop business strategies that effectively
responded to health care needs in ways that were centered on local
demands. Before going, the team developed hypotheses based on
formal research and existing GE solutions. During the trip, the team
then tested these hypotheses through ﬁrsthand experience and time
spent with pregnant mothers and their newborn children. Some of
the hypotheses were validated, while others were disproven. One
idea to increase the use of portable ultrasound equipment was found
to be impractical given the limited facilities available. The team found
other, more practical solutions to meet related needs during preg-
nancies. Following the trip, the team made six formal recommenda-
tions as a result of their experience. One of those was to pilot a
comprehensive health care initiative in ﬁve African countries. This
was reinforced by a $5 million investment of GE tools and method-
ologies to accelerate the design of product solutions. On a more
personal level, the program’s participants and several of their col-
leagues donated over $250,000 to charities focused on access to fresh
water. This was one sign of the very real and personal impact that the
experience had on them as leaders. Kimberly Kleiman-Lee partici-
pated in the team’s trip and described how “the conditions, the
context, and the experience were the things that these leaders took
back with them. Applying GE tools like Lean Six Sigma or FastWorks
were then the way that they processed those experiences and
communicated them back to other stakeholders within GE.” In
our view, this is an outstanding example of developing strategic
insight, integrating both real-world experience and formal processes
to identify, reﬁne, and syndicate a speciﬁc strategy. It was also a
powerful way to build those skills in the executives who participated.
In addition to developing individual leaders, GE is intentional
about developing organizational capacity for strategic leadership. One
way this is exempliﬁed is through another Crotonville program called
Leadership, Innovation, and Growth (LIG). LIG is a program that is
used on an as-needed basis to address topics of strategic importance to
Developing Strategic Leadership
245

Page 246
a particular business unit or to GE as a whole. “We typically apply
LIG to explore a new direction driven by Chairman Jeff Immelt,”
Kimberly describes. “We typically have an academic director from a
leading university and a background in a relevant topic, strategy, or a
cutting-edge approach.” Sessions have addressed topics such as growth
in one of GE’s emerging markets and revitalizing product develop-
ment in GE’s power generation business.
The program is notable for its focus on driving both strategic
insight and strategy execution through the structure of program
milestones. It is initiated by a problem statement, deﬁned by Immelt
or the CEO of one of GE’s business divisions. The entire management
team of that business then gathers for three days to discuss the problem.
This session is conducted using a combination of GE methodologies
and insights from outside experts. Thought leaders and academics
from leading universities are often invited to participate. After the
session, the executives are tasked with follow-up actions to do
additional research and generate recommendations.
This is in preparation for a second session, involving the original
participants as well as a larger group of 100 or more leaders from that
business. This second session is typically action oriented, bringing
closure to strategic decisions and exploring issues related to execution.
The format serves to reinforce commitment from the top manage-
ment team while also bringing a wider group of leaders on board to
understand and support the strategy. Education is again incorporated
into the session’s design, with outside experts raising provocative
questions to test both the quality of the strategy and the resolve of the
management team to execute that strategy.
The LIG program is then closed through the development of a
formal statement, typically framed in the structure of a letter addressed
to Immelt or the sponsoring executive. This letter serves as the team’s
statement of commitment. Often it is circulated more widely to
demonstrate commitment to wider groups of leaders and employees.
This closing statement, like the other milestones in the program, is
used to reinforce organizational alignment, which in turn addresses a
246

Page 247
combination of issues related to strategic insight and strategic execu-
tion, and as such provides another excellent example of addressing the
issues we see as critical to strategic leadership in practice. Individual
leaders complete the process with a greater understanding of the
particular strategy and their role, informed by the dialogue and
education embedded in the process. In taking this approach, the
LIG program leaves the entire organization more effective and
strategically aligned than before the process began.
These two programs—EDC and LIG—provide excellent exam-
ples of how strategic leadership is developed. EDC represents a holistic
approach to developing individuals to be more strategic leaders. LIG
takes a structured approach to improving GE’s overall organizational
capability to deﬁne and execute strategy. In combination, they
reinforce our view that GE deserves the recognition it has earned
as one of the world’s top companies for leadership.
In Closing
We opened this book with questions that people have asked us about
the nature of strategic leadership. Those questions informed our focus,
and we hope we’ve answered them adequately. We raised our own
questions in this ﬁnal chapter—ones that can only be answered by
those striving to apply the principles of strategic leadership.
We ﬁnd these questions fascinating because of their enduring
nature. Strategic thinking and leadership raise meaningful issues—
matters of purpose, intent, priorities, and actions. These are things that
matter. By striving to practice strategic leadership, we all have the
opportunity to make a difference. We have the chance to be more
effective in doing the things that matter, be that to ourselves, our team,
our organization, our community, or our world. We hope to have
that impact, and we hope that you do, too.

Firming Up and Rounding Out Your Skills and Abilities
The previous chapter presented ways to develop your ability to think
and lead more strategically. As you give additional consideration to
strategic thinking and leadership, it is important that you push
boundaries and test new skills and abilities. It is only through testing
and practice that you will expand your toolkit. As you learn and apply
new skills, you may wish to explore additional tools, review other
books and articles, or attend a conference or workshop on the subject
of strategic thinking and leadership. If that is the case, the following
resources may prove useful.
Tools
Regardless of your preferred strategic leadership type, we believe you
will ﬁnd the following tools useful. The ﬁrst is the Strategic Thinking
Self-Audit. It is designed to help you (1) determine the extent to
which you are leveraging strategic thinking and (2) identify potential
blind spots that need to be addressed through additional consideration.

When generating ideas, we use the following process:
1. Review all of the relevant information and data you have on hand.
2. Brainstorm ideas.1 For example, when considering how you will
achieve your mission and attain your long-term vision,
a. Generate as many ideas as possible, without concern about
whether the ideas are actions, tactics, or strategies.
b. Be as creative and innovative as possible.
c. Take advantage of existing products, services, markets, clients,
customers, capabilities, technology, systems, processes, values,
principles, and cultural elements.
d. Envision new technology, systems, and processes.
e. Generate as many ideas as possible; focus on quantity over
quality.
3. Capture your ideas on sticky notes:
a. Write one idea per separate sticky note.
b. Each idea must be written as a phrase or statement.
c. Each phrase or statement must contain a verb.
4. Process your sticky notes using an Afﬁnity Diagram.2
a. Lay your sticky notes on a table or place them on ﬂip-chart
paper afﬁxed to a wall.
b. Identify natural themes by placing sticky notes with similar or
connected ideas in a group.
c. Once all of your sticky notes are grouped into natural themes,
review and reﬁne the groups by separating an idea that does not
ﬁt into any of the existing groups into a freestanding idea. If an
idea ﬁts into more than one group, create duplicate sticky notes
and place them into the proper themes.
d. Once you no longer need to move any of the sticky notes, you
can assume your ideas are placed into proper groups and that
each group has a unique theme or unifying concept.
e. Review each group to identify the natural theme or unifying
concept. Summarize the concept in a concisely stated ﬁve- to
seven-word description written on a new sticky note.
f. Place the sticky note containing the description (referred to as
the “header card”) at the top of each group.

Prioritization
After generating your ideas and organizing them in a way that can be
acted upon, you will in all likelihood need to prioritize them so that
the most important ideas are selected or acted upon ﬁrst. The bubble
sort3 is a simple and easy-to-use prioritization tool. Do not mistake its
ease of use with the quality of the results that it produces; we have
successfully applied the bubble sort in a variety of contexts, ranging
from personal application to group decision making in large, global
organizations. In applying the bubble sort, you:
1. Decide on the criteria you will use to evaluate your ideas. Criteria
might include:
a. The magnitude of impact that the idea will have on your
mission and vision.
b. The likelihood that the idea will be realized or achieved, given
existing strengths, capabilities, limitations, and impediments.
c. The extent to which the idea is realistic, sensible, and practical,
given the resources it will require.
d. The degree to which your stakeholders are likely to consider
the idea to be realistic, sensible, and practical.
2. Write the criteria on a ﬂip chart so that they can easily and
consistently be applied to each idea.
3. Write each idea on a separate sticky note and then randomly place
the sticky notes one above another in a vertical column on a ﬂip
chart.
4. While keeping the criteria in mind, compare the top two sticky
notes to determine which is the most important (i.e., more likely
to succeed and yield the greatest result and outcome). If the lower
sticky note is more important, exchange the position of the notes.
This results in the more important sticky note being positioned
above the less important one.
5. Repeat this paired comparison and exchange it for the second and
third sticky note, then the third and fourth sticky note, and so on
until you reach the bottom of the column.
6. Repeat the process for the entire column (starting again with the
top two sticky notes) if any notes are moved during the analysis.

7. Apply the process to the entire column until no sticky notes are
exchanged during a complete pass-through. At this point, the
sticky notes (and the list of ideas) are in priority order from most to
least important.

Additional Resources
We are conﬁdent that many of these resources will prove useful as you
strive to strengthen your ability to think and lead strategically. If you
wish to expand your research, take a few minutes to research “strategic
thinking” and “strategic leadership” at your learning resource center,
public or college library, or online through one of the popular Internet
search engines. Take advantage of the references and resources you
come across, even the ones you initially feel will provide only marginal
beneﬁts. Our experience suggests that what you discover “at the
margins” might prove the most useful as you learn new concepts, push
new boundaries, and test new skills.

and Organizational Change.
