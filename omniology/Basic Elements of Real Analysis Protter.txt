Preface
Some time ago Charles B. Morrey and I wrote A First Course in Real Analy-
sis, a book that provides material sufﬁcient for a comprehensive one-year
course in analysis for those students who have completed a standard ele-
mentary course in calculus. The book has been through two editions, the
second of which appeared in 1991; small changes and corrections of mis-
prints have been made in the ﬁfth printing of the second edition, which
appeared recently.
However, for many students of mathematics and for those students
who intend to study any of the physical sciences and computer science,
the need is for a short one-semester course in real analysis rather than
a lengthy, detailed, comprehensive treatment. To ﬁll this need the book
Basic Elements of Real Analysis provides, in a brief and elementary way,
the most important topics in the subject.
The ﬁrst chapter, which deals with the real number system, gives the
reader the opportunity to develop facility in proving elementary theo-
rems. Since most students who take this course have spent their efforts in
developing manipulative skills, such an introduction presents a welcome
change. The last section of this chapter, which establishes the technique
of mathematical induction, is especially helpful for those who have not
previously been exposed to this important topic.
Chapters 2 through 5 cover the theory of elementary calculus, includ-
ing differentiation and integration. Many of the theorems that are “stated
without proof” in elementary calculus are proved here.
It is important to note that both the Darboux integral and the Riemann
integral are described thoroughly in Chapter 5 of this volume. Here we
vii

Preface
establish the equivalence of these integrals, thus giving the reader insight
into what integration is all about.
For topics beyond calculus, the concept of a metric space is crucial.
Chapter 6 describes topology in metric spaces as well as the notion of
compactness, especially with regard to the Heine–Borel theorem.
The subject of metric spaces leads in a natural way to the calculus
of functions in N-dimensional spaces with N > 2. Here derivatives of
functions of N variables are developed, and the Darboux and Riemann
integrals, as described in Chapter 5, are extended in Chapter 7 to N-
dimensional space.
Inﬁnite series is the subject of Chapter 8. After a review of the usual
tests for convergence and divergence of series, the emphasis shifts to
uniform convergence. The reader must master this concept in order to
understand the underlying ideas of both power series and Fourier se-
ries. Although Fourier series are not included in this text, the reader
should ﬁnd it fairly easy reading once he or she masters uniform con-
vergence. For those interested in studying computer science, not only
Fourier series but also the application of Fourier series to wavelet theory is
recommended. (See, e.g., Ten Lectures on Wavelets by Ingrid Daubechies.)
There are many important functions that are deﬁned by integrals, the
integration taken over a ﬁnite interval, a half-inﬁnite integral, or one
from −∞to +∞. An example is the well-known Gamma function. In
Chapter 9 we develop the necessary techniques for differentiation under
the integral sign of such functions (the Leibniz rule). Although desirable,
this chapter is optional, since the results are not used later in the text.
Chapter 10 treats the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. After an introduction
to functions of bounded variation, we deﬁne the R-S integral and show
how the usual integration-by-parts formula is a special case of this inte-
gral. The generality of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is further illustrated
by the fact that an inﬁnite series can always be considered as a special
case of a Riemann–Stieltjes integral.
A subject that is heavily used in both pure and applied mathematics
is the Lagrange multiplier rule. In most cases this rule is stated without
proof but with applications discussed. However, we establish the rule
in Chapter 11 (Theorem 11.4) after developing the facts on the implicit
function theorem needed for the proof.
In the twelfth, and last, chapter we discuss vector functions in RN. We
prove the theorems of Green and Stokes and the divergence theorem,
not in full generality but of sufﬁcient scope for most applications. The
ambitious reader can get a more general insight either by referring to the
book A First Course in Real Analysis or the text Principles of Mathematical
Analysis by Walter Rudin.

The Real Number
System
1.1
Axioms for a Field
In this and the next four chapters we give a reasonably rigorous founda-
tion to the processes of calculus of functions of one variable, a subject
usually studied in a ﬁrst course in calculus. Calculus depends on the
properties of the real number system. To give a complete foundation for
calculus we would have to develop the real number system from the be-
ginning. Since such a development is lengthy and would divert us from
our goal of presenting a course in analysis, we suppose that the reader is
familiar with the usual properties of real numbers.
In this section we present a set of axioms that form a logical basis for
those processes of elementary algebra upon which calculus is based. Any
collection of objects satisfying the axioms given below is called a ﬁeld.
In particular, the system of real numbers satisﬁes these axioms, and we
indicate how the customary laws of elementary algebra concerning addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division are direct consequences of
the axioms for a ﬁeld.
Throughout the book we use the word equals or its symbol  to stand
for the words “is the same as.” The reader should compare this with other
uses for the symbol  such as that in plane geometry when, for example,
two line segments are said to be equal if they have the same length.

The Real Number System
Axioms of Addition
A-1. Closure property
If a and b are numbers, there is one and only one number, denoted a + b,
called their sum.
A-2. Commutative law
For any two numbers a and b, the equality
b + a  a + b
holds.
A-3. Associative law
For all numbers a, b, and c, the equality
(a + b) + c  a + (b + c)
holds.
A-4. Existence of a zero
There is one and only one number 0, called zero, such that a + 0  a for any
number a.
A-5. Existence of a negative
If a is any number, there is one and only one number x such that a + x  0.
This number is called the negative of a and is denoted by −a.
Theorem 1.1
If a and b are any numbers, then there is one and only one number x such
that a + x  b. This number x is given by x  b + ( −a).
Proof
We must establish two results: (i) that b + (−a) satisﬁes the equation
a + x  b and (ii) that no other number satisﬁes this equation. To prove
(i), suppose that x  b + (−a). Then, using Axioms A-2 through A-4, we
see that
a + x  a + [b + (−a)]  a + [(−a) + b]  [a + (−a)] + b  0 + b  b.
Therefore, (i) holds. To prove (ii), suppose that x is some number such
that a + x  b. Adding (−a) to both sides of this equation, we ﬁnd that
(a + x) + (−a)  b + (−a).
Now,
(a + x) + (−a)  a + [x + (−a)]  a + [(−a) + x]
 [a + (−a)] + x  0 + x  x.

1.1.
Axioms for a Field
3
We conclude that x  b + (−a), and the uniqueness of the solution is
established.
Notation. The number b + (−a) is denoted by b −a.
The next theorem establishes familiar properties of negative numbers.
Theorem 1.2
(i) If a is a number, then −( −a)  a.
(ii) If a and b are numbers, then
−(a + b))  ( −a) + ( −b).
Proof
(i) From the deﬁnition of negative, we have
(−a) + [−(−a)]  0,
(−a) + a  a + (−a)  0.
Axiom A-5 states that the negative of (−a) is unique. Therefore, a 
−(−a). To establish (ii), we know from the deﬁnition of negative that
(a + b) + [−(a + b)]  0.
Furthermore, using the axioms, we have
(a + b) + [(−a) + (−b)]  [a + (−a)] + [b + (−b)]  0 + 0  0.
The result follows from the “only one” part of Axiom A-5.
Axioms of Multiplication
M-1. Closure property
If a and b are numbers, there is one and only one number, denoted by ab (or
a × b or a · b), called their product.
M-2. Commutative law
For every two numbers a and b, the equality
ba  ab
holds.
M-3. Associative law
For all numbers a, b, and c, the equality
(ab)c  a(bc)
holds.

1.
The Real Number System
M-4. Existence of a unit
There is one and only one number u, different from zero, such that au  a
for every number a. This number u is called the unit and (as is customary)
is denoted by 1.
M-5. Existence of a reciprocal
For each number a different from zero there is one and only one number x
such that ax  1. This number x is called the reciprocal of a (or the inverse
of a) and is denoted by a−1 (or 1/a).
Axioms M-1 through M-4 are the parallels of Axioms A-1 through A-4
with addition replaced by multiplication. However, M-5 is not the exact
analogue of A-5, since the additional condition a ̸ 0 is required. The
reason for this is given below in Theorem 1.3, where it is shown that the
result of multiplication of any number by zero is zero. We are familiar
with the fact that says that division by zero is excluded.
Special Axiom on distributivity
D. Distributive law
For all numbers a, b, and c, the equality
a(b + c)  ab + ac
holds.
In every logical system there are certain terms that are undeﬁned. For
example, in the system of axioms for plane Euclidean geometry, the terms
point and line are undeﬁned. Of course, we have an intuitive idea of the
meaning of these two undeﬁned terms, but in the framework of Euclidean
geometry it is not possible to deﬁne them. In the axioms for algebra given
above, the term number is undeﬁned. We shall interpret number to mean
real number (positive, negative, or zero) in the usual sense that we give
to it in elementary courses. Actually, the above axioms for a ﬁeld hold
for many systems, of which the collection of real numbers is only one.
For example, all the axioms stated so far hold for the system consisting
of all complex numbers. Also, there are many systems, each consisting of
a ﬁnite number of elements (ﬁnite ﬁelds), that satisfy all the axioms we
have stated until now.
Additional axioms are needed if we insist that the real number system
be the only collection satisfying all the given axioms. The additional axiom
required for this purpose is discussed in Section 1.3.
Theorem 1.3
If a is any number, then a · 0  0.

1.1.
Axioms for a Field
5
Proof
Let b be any number. Then b + 0  b, and therefore a(b + 0)  ab. From
the distributive law (Axiom D), we ﬁnd that
(ab) + (a · 0)  (ab),
so that a · 0  0 by Axiom A-4.
Theorem 1.4
If a and b are numbers and a ̸ 0, then there is one and only one number x
such that a · x  b. The number x is given by x  ba−1.
The proof of Theorem 1.4 is just like the proof of Theorem 1.1 with
addition replaced by multiplication, 0 by 1, and −a by a−1. The details
are left to the reader.
Notation. The expression “if and only if,” a technical one used fre-
quently in mathematics, requires some explanation. Suppose A and B
stand for propositions that may be true or false. To say that A is true if B
is true means that the truth of B implies the truth of A. The statement A is
true only if B is true means that the truth of A implies the truth of B. Thus
the shorthand statement “A is true if and only if B is true” is equivalent
to the double implication that the truth of A implies and is implied by the
truth of B. As a further shorthand we use the symbol ⇔to represent “if
and only if,” and we write
A ⇔B
for the two implications stated above. The term necessary and sufﬁcient is
used as a synonym for “if and only if.”
We now establish the familiar principle that is the basis for the solution
of quadratic and other algebraic equations by factoring.
Theorem 1.5
(i) We have ab  0 if and only if a  0 or b  0 or both.
(ii) We have a ̸ 0 and b ̸ 0 if and only if ab ̸ 0.
Proof
We must prove two statements in each of parts (i) and (ii). To prove (i),
observe that if a  0 or b  0 or both, then it follows from Theorem 1.3
that ab  0. Going the other way in (i), suppose that ab  0. Then there
are two cases: either a  0 or a ̸ 0. If a  0, the result follows. If a ̸ 0,
then we see that
b  1 · b  (a−1a)b  a−1(ab)  a−1 · 0  0.
Hence b  0 and (i) is established. To prove (ii), ﬁrst suppose a ̸ 0 and
b ̸ 0. Then ab ̸ 0, because a ̸ 0 and b ̸ 0 is the negation of the

6
1.
The Real Number System
statement “a  0 or b  0 or both.” Thus (i) applies. For the second part
of (ii), suppose ab ̸ 0. Then a ̸ 0 and b ̸ 0, for if one of them were
zero, Theorem 1.3 would apply to give ab  0.
Theorem 1.6
(i) If a ̸ 0, then a−1 ̸ 0 and [(a−1)−1]  a.
(ii) If a ̸ 0 and b ̸ 0, then (a · b)−1  (a−1) · (b−1).
The proof of this theorem is like the proof of Theorem 1.2 with addition
replaced by multiplication, 0 replaced by 1, and (−a), (−b) replaced by
a−1, b−1. We leave the details to the reader. Note that if a ̸ 0, then a−1 ̸ 0
because aa−1  1 and 1 ̸ 0. Then Theorem 1.5(ii) may be used with
b  a−1.
Using Theorem 1.3 and the distributive law, we easily prove the laws
of signs stated as Theorem 1.7 below. We emphasize that the numbers a
and b may be positive, negative, or zero.
Theorem 1.7
If a and b are any numbers, then
(i) a · ( −b)  −(a · b).
(ii) ( −a) · b  −(a · b).
(iii) ( −a) · ( −b)  a · b.
Proof
(i) Since b + (−b)  0, it follows from the distributive law that
a[b + (−b)]  a · b + a · (−b)  0.
Also, the negative of a ·b has the property that a ·b +[−(a ·b)]  0. Hence
we see from Axiom A-5 that a · (−b)  −(a · b). Part (ii) follows from part
(i) by interchanging a and b. The proof of (iii) is left to the reader.
We now show that the laws of fractions, as given in elementary algebra,
follow from the axioms and theorems above.
Notation. We introduce the following standard symbols for a · b−1:
a · b−1  a
b  a/b  a ÷ b.
These symbols, representing an indicated division, are called fractions.
The numerator and denominator of a fraction are deﬁned as usual. A
fraction with denominator zero has no meaning.
Theorem 1.8
(i) For every number a, the equality a/1  a holds.
(ii) If a ̸ 0, then a/a  1.

1.2.
Natural Numbers and Sequences
7
Proof
(i) We have a/1  (a · 1−1)  (a · 1−1) · 1  a(1−1 · 1)  a · 1  a. (ii) If
a ̸ 0, then a/a  a · a−1  1, by deﬁnition.
Problems
1. Show that in Axiom A-5 it is not necessary to assume that there is
only one number x such that a + x  0.
2. If a, b, and c are any numbers, show that
a + b + c  a + c + b  b + a + c  b + c + a  c + a + b  c + b + a.

Natural Numbers and Sequences
Traditionally we build the real number system by a sequence of enlarge-
ments. We start with the positive integers and extend that system to
include the positive rational numbers (quotients, or ratios, of integers).
The system of rational numbers is then enlarged to include all positive

The Real Number System
real numbers; ﬁnally we adjoin the negative numbers and zero to obtain
the collection of all real numbers.
The system of axioms in Section 1.1 does not distinguish (or even
mention) positive numbers. To establish the relationship between these
axioms and the real number system, we begin with a discussion of
natural numbers. As we know, these are the same as the positive
integers.
We can obtain the totality of natural numbers by starting with the num-
ber 1 and then forming 1 + 1, (1 + 1) + 1, [(1 + 1) + 1] + 1, and so on. We
call 1 + 1 the number 2; then (1 + 1) + 1 is called the number 3; in this
way the collection of natural numbers is generated. Actually it is possible
to give an abstract deﬁnition of natural number, one that yields the same
collection and is logically more satisfactory. This is done in Section 1.4,
where the principle of mathematical induction is established and illus-
trated. Meanwhile, we shall suppose that the reader is familiar with all
the usual properties of natural numbers.
The axioms for a ﬁeld given in Section 1.1 determine addition and
multiplication for any two numbers. On the basis of these axioms we were
able to deﬁne the sum and product of three numbers. Before describing
the process of deﬁning sums and products for more than three elements,
we now recall several deﬁnitions and give some notations that will be
used throughout the book.
Deﬁnitions
The set (or collection) of all real numbers is denoted by R1. The set of
ordered pairs of real numbers is denoted by R2, the set of ordered triples
by R3, and so on. A relation from R1 to R1 is a set of ordered pairs of real
numbers; that is, a relation from R1 to R1 is a set in R2. The domain of this
relation is the set in R1 consisting of all the ﬁrst elements in the ordered
pairs. The range of the relation is the set of all the second elements in
the ordered pairs. Observe that the range is also a set in R1.
A function f from R1 into R1 is a relation in which no two ordered
pairs have the same ﬁrst element. We use the notation f : R1 →R1 for
such a function. The word mapping is a synonym for function.
If D is the domain of f and S is its range, we shall also use the notation
f : D →S. A function is a relation (set in R2) such that for each element
x in the domain there is precisely one element y in the range such that
the pair (x, y) is one of the ordered pairs that constitute the function.
Occasionally a function will be indicated by writing f : x →y. Also, for
a given function f , the unique number in the range corresponding to an
element x in the domain in written f(x). The symbol x →f(x) is used for
this relationship. We assume that the reader is familiar with functional
notation.
A sequence is a function that has as its domain some or all of the
natural numbers. If the domain consists of a ﬁnite number of positive

1.2.
Natural Numbers and Sequences
9
integers, we say that the sequence is ﬁnite. Otherwise, the sequence is
called inﬁnite. In general, the elements in the domain of a function do
not have any particular order. In a sequence, however, there is a natural
ordering of the domain induced by the usual order in terms of size that
we give to the positive integers. For example, if the domain of a sequence
consists of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n, then the elements of the range, that
is, the terms of the sequence, are usually written in the same order as
the natural numbers. If the sequence (function) is denoted by a, then
the terms of the sequence are denoted by a1, a2, . . . , an or, sometimes
by a(1), a(2), . . . , a(n). The element ai or a(i) is called the ith term of the
sequence. If the domain of a sequence a is the set of all natural numbers
(so that the sequence is inﬁnite), we denote the sequence by
a1, a2, . . . , an, . . .
or {an}.
Deﬁnitions
For all integers n ≥1, the sum and product of the numbers a1, a2, . . . , an
are deﬁned respectively by bn and cn:
a1 + a2 + . . . + an ≡bn
and
a1 · a2 · · · an ≡cn.
We use the notation
n

i1
ai  a1 + a2 + . . . + an
and
n

i1
ai  a1 · a2 · · · an.
The symbol  is in general use as a compact notation for product analo-
gous to the use of  for sum. We read n
i1 as “the product as i goes from
1 to n.”
On the basis of these deﬁnitions it is not difﬁcult to establish the next
result.

The symbol xn, for n a natural number, is deﬁned in the customary
way as x · x · · · x with x appearing n times in the product. We assume that
the reader is familiar with the laws of exponents and the customary rules
for adding, subtracting, and multiplying polynomials. These rules are a
simple consequence of the axioms and propositions above.
The decimal system of writing numbers (or the system with any base)
depends on a representation theorem that we now state. If n is any natural
number, then there is one and only one representation for n of the form
n  d0(10)k + d1(10)k−1 + · · · + dk−1(10) + dk
in which k is a natural number or zero, each di is one of the numbers
0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, and d0 ̸ 0. The numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9 are called digits of
the decimal system. On the basis of such a representation, the rules of
arithmetic follow from the corresponding rules for polynomials in x with
x  10.
For completeness, we deﬁne the terms integer, rational number, and
irrational number.
Deﬁnitions
A real number is an integer if and only if it is either zero, a natural
number, or the negative of a natural number. A real number r is said to
be rational if and only if there are integers p and q, with q ̸ 0, such that
r  p/q. A real number that is not rational is called irrational.
It is clear that the sum and product of a ﬁnite sequence of integers
is again an integer, and that the sum, product, or quotient of a ﬁnite
sequence of rational numbers is a rational number.
The rule for multiplication of fractions is given by an extension of
Theorem 1.7 that may be derived by mathematical induction.
We emphasize that the axioms for a ﬁeld given in Section 1.1 imply
only theorems concerned with the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The exact nature of the elements in the ﬁeld
is not described. For example, the axioms do not imply the existence of a
number whose square is 2. In fact, if we interpret number to be “rational
number” and consider no others, then all the axioms for a ﬁeld are sat-
isﬁed. The rational number system forms a ﬁeld. An additional axiom is
needed if we wish the ﬁeld to contain irrational numbers such as
√

1.3
Inequalities
The axioms for a ﬁeld describe many number systems. If we wish to
describe the real number system to the exclusion of other systems, ad-
ditional axioms are needed. One of these, an axiom that distinguishes
positive from negative numbers, is the Axiom of inequality.

12
1.
The Real Number System
Axiom I
(Axiom of inequality) Among all the numbers of the system, there is a set
called the positive numbers that satisﬁes the two conditions: (i) for any number
a exactly one of the following three alternatives holds: a is positive or a  0 or
−a is positive; (ii) any ﬁnite sum or product of positive numbers is positive.
When we add Axiom I to those of Section 1.1, the resulting system of
axioms is applicable only to those number systems that have a linear or-
der. For example, the system of complex numbers does not satisfy Axiom
I but does satisfy all the axioms for a ﬁeld. Similarly, it is easy to see that
the system described in Problem 6 of Section 1.2 does not satisfy Axiom I.
However, both the real number system and the rational number system
satisfy all the axioms given thus far.
Deﬁnition
A number a is negative whenever −a is positive. If a and b are any
numbers, we say that a > b (read: a is greater than b) whenever a −b is
positive.
It is convenient to adopt a geometric point of view and to associate
a horizontal axis with the totality of real numbers. We select any conve-
nient point for the origin and call points to the right of the origin positive
numbers and points to the left negative numbers (Figure 1.1). For every
real number there will correspond a point on the line, and conversely,
every point will represent a real number. Then the inequality a < b may
be read: a is to the left of b. This geometric way of looking at inequalities
is frequently of help in solving problems.
Figure 1.1
It is helpful to introduce the notion of an interval of numbers or points.
If a and b are numbers (as shown in Figure 1.2), then the open interval
from a to b is the collection of all numbers that are both larger than a and
smaller than b. That is, an open interval consists of all numbers between
a and b. A number x is between a and b if both inequalities a < x and
x < b are true. A compact way of writing these two inequalities is
a < x < b.
The closed interval from a to b consists of all the points between a and
b and in addition the numbers (or points) a and b (Figure 1.3).

1.3.
Inequalities
13
Figure 1.2
Figure 1.3
Suppose a number x is either equal to a or larger than a, but we don’t
know which. We write this conveniently as x ≥a, which is read: x is
greater than or equal to a. Similarly, x ≤b is read: x is less than or equal
to b, and means that x may be either smaller than b or may be b itself. A
compact way of designating all points x in the closed interval from a to b
is
a ≤x ≤b.
An interval that contains the endpoint b but not a is said to be half-open
on the left. Such an interval consists of all points x that satisfy the double
inequality
a < x ≤b.
Similarly, an interval containing a but not b is called half-open on the
right, and we write
a ≤x < b.
Parentheses and brackets are used as symbols for intervals in the
following way:
(a, b)
for the open interval a < x < b,
[a, b]
for the closed interval a ≤x ≤b,
(a, b]
for the interval half-open on the left a < x ≤b,
[a, b)
for the interval half-open on the right a ≤x < b.
We extend the idea of interval to include the unbounded cases. For exam-
ple, consider the set of all numbers larger than 7. This set may be thought
of as an interval beginning at 7 and extending to inﬁnity to the right (see
Figure 1.4). Of course, inﬁnity is not a number, but we use the symbol
(7, ∞) to represent all numbers larger than 7. We also use the double
inequality
7 < x < ∞
to represent this set. Similarly, the symbol (−∞, 12) stands for all num-
bers less than 12. We also use the inequalities −∞< x < 12 to represent
this set.

The Real Number System
Figure 1.4
Deﬁnition
The solution of an equation or inequality in one unknown, say x, is the
collection of all numbers that make the equation or inequality a true
statement. Sometimes this set of numbers is called the solution set. For
example, the inequality
3x −7 < 8
has as its solution set all numbers less than 5. To demonstrate this we
argue in the following way. If x is a number that satisﬁes the above in-
equality, we can add 7 to both sides and obtain a true statement. That is,
the inequality
3x −7 + 7 < 8 + 7,
or
3x < 15,
holds. Now, dividing both sides by 3, we obtain x < 5; therefore, if x is
a solution, then it is less than 5. Strictly speaking, however, we have not
proved that every number that is less than 5 is a solution. In an actual
proof, we begin by supposing that x is any number less than 5; that is,
x < 5. We multiply both sides of this inequality by 3 and then subtract 7
from both sides to get
3x −7 < 8,
the original inequality. Since the hypothesis that x is less than 5 implies
the original inequality, we have proved the result. The important thing
to notice is that the proof consisted in reversing the steps of the original
argument that led to the solution x < 5 in the ﬁrst place. So long as each
step taken is reversible, the above procedure is completely satisfactory
for obtaining solutions of inequalities.
By means of the symbol ⇔, we can give a solution to this example in
compact form. We write
3x −7 < 8 ⇔3x < 15
(adding 7 to both sides)
and
3x < 15 ⇔x < 5
(dividing both sides by 3).
The solution set is the interval (−∞, 5).
Notation. It is convenient to introduce some terminology and symbols
concerning sets. In general, a set is a collection of objects. The objects
may have any character (number, points, lines, etc.) so long as we know
which objects are in a given set and which are not. If S is a set and P is

1.3.
Inequalities
15
an object in it, we write P ∈S and say that P is an element of S or that
P belongs to S. If S1 and S2 are two sets, their union, denoted by S1 ∪S2,
consists of all objects each of which is in at least one of the two sets. The
intersection of S1 and S2, denoted by S1 ∩S2, consists of all objects each
of which is in both sets.
Figure 1.5
Schematically, if S1 is the horizontally shaded set of points in Figure
1.5 and S2 is the vertically shaded set, then S1 ∪S2 consists of the entire
shaded area, and S1 ∩S2 consists of the doubly shaded area. Similarly, we
may form the union and intersection of any number of sets. When we
write S1 ∪S2 ∪. . . ∪Sn for the union S of the n sets S1, S2, . . . , Sn, then
S consists of all elements each of which is in at least one of the n sets.
We also use the notation S  n
i1 Si as shorthand for the union of n sets.
The intersection of n sets S1, S2, . . . , Sn is written S1 ∩S2 ∩. . . ∩Sn or,
brieﬂy, n
i1 Si. It may happen that two sets S1 and S2 have no elements
in common. In such a case their intersection is empty, and we use the
term empty set for the set that is devoid of members.
Most often we will deal with sets each of which is speciﬁed by some
property or properties of its elements. For example, we may speak of the
set of all even integers or the set of all rational numbers between 0 and
1. We employ the special notation
{x : x  2n and n is an integer}
to represent the set of all even integers. In this notation the letter x
stands for a generic element of the set, and the properties that determine
membership in the set are listed to the right of the colon. The notation
{x : x ∈(0, 1) and x is rational}
represents the set of rational numbers in the open interval (0, 1). If a set
has only a few elements, it may be speciﬁed by listing its members be-
tween braces. Thus the notation {−2, 0, 1} denotes the set whose elements
are the numbers –2, 0, and 1.
The words and and or have precise meanings when used in connection
with sets and their properties. The set consisting of elements that have

16
1.
The Real Number System
property A or property B is the union of the set having property A and
the set having property B. Symbolically, we write
{x : x has property A or property B}
 {x : x has property A} ∪{x : x has property B}.
The set consisting of elements that have both property A and property B
is the intersection of the set having property A with the set having property
B. In set notation, we write
{x : x has property A and property B}
 {x : x has property A} ∩{x : x has property B}.
If A and B are two sets and if every element of A is also an element of
B, we say that A is a subset of B, and we write A ⊂B. The two statements
A ⊂B and B ⊂A imply that A  B.
We give two examples that illustrate how set notation is used.
Example 1
Solve for x:
3
x < 5
(x ̸ 0).
Solution. Since we don’t know in advance whether x is positive or nega-
tive, we cannot multiply by x unless we impose additional conditions. We
therefore separate the problem into two cases: (i) x is positive, and (ii) x
is negative. The desired solution set can be written as the union of the
sets S1 and S2 deﬁned by
S1 

x : 3
x < 5 and x > 0

,
S2 

x : 3
x < 5 and x < 0

Now,
x ∈S1 ⇔3 < 5x and x > 0
⇔x > 3
5 and x > 0
⇔x > 3
5 .

1.3.
Inequalities
17
Similarly,
x ∈S2 ⇔3 > 5x and x < 0
⇔x < 3
5 and x < 0
⇔x < 0.
Thus the solution set is (see Figure 1.6)
S1 ∪S2  ( 3

Solve for x:
2x −3


,
S2 

x : 2x −3
x + 2
< 1
3 and x + 2 < 0

.
For numbers in S1, we may multiply the inequality by x + 2, and since
x + 2 is positive, the direction of the inequality is preserved. Hence
x ∈S1 ⇔3(2x −3) < x + 2 and x + 2 > 0
⇔5x < 11 and x + 2 > 0
⇔x < 11
5
and x > −2
⇔x ∈(−2, 11
5 ).

18

The Real Number System
For numbers in S2, multiplication of the inequality by the negative
quantity x + 2 reverses the direction. Therefore,
x ∈S2 ⇔3(2x −3) > x + 2 and x + 2 < 0
⇔5x > 11 and x + 2 < 0
⇔x > 11
5
and x < −2.
Since there are no numbers x satisfying both conditions x >
11
5 and x <
−2, the set S2 is empty. The solution set (Figure 1.7) consists of S1 
(−2, 11
5 ).

Mathematical Induction
The principle of mathematical induction with which most readers are
familiar can be derived as a consequence of the axioms in Section 1.1.
Since the deﬁnition of natural number is at the basis of the principle of
mathematical induction, we shall develop both concepts together.
Deﬁnition
A set S of numbers is said to be inductive if
(a) 1 ∈S and
(b) (x + 1) ∈S whenever x ∈S.
Examples of inductive sets are easily found. The set of all real numbers
is inductive, as is the set of all rationals. The set of all integers, positive,
zero, and negative, is inductive. The collection of real numbers between
0 and 10 is not inductive, since it satisﬁes (a) but not (b). No ﬁnite set of
real numbers can be inductive since (b) will be violated at some stage.
Deﬁnition
A real number n is said to be a natural number if it belongs to every
inductive set of real numbers. The set of all natural numbers will be
denoted by the symbol N.
We observe that N contains the number 1, since by the deﬁnition of
inductive set, 1 must always be a member of every inductive set. As we
know, the set of natural numbers N is identical with the set of positive integers.
Theorem 1.9
The set N of all natural numbers is an inductive set.

20
1.
The Real Number System
Proof
We must show that N has properties (a) and (b) in the deﬁnition of in-
ductive set. As we remarked above, (a) holds. Now suppose that k is an
element of N. Then k belongs to every inductive set S. For each inductive
set, if k is an element, so is k + 1. Thus k + 1 belongs to every induc-
tive set. Therefore k + 1 belongs to N. Hence N has Property (b), and is
inductive.
The principle of mathematical induction is contained in the next theo-
rem, which asserts that any inductive set of natural numbers must consist
of the entire collection N.
Theorem 1.10 (Principle of mathematical induction)
If S is an inductive set of natural numbers, then S  N.
Proof
Since S is an inductive set, we know from the deﬁnition of natural number
that N is contained in S. On the other hand, since S consists of natural
numbers, it follows that S is contained in N. Therefore S  N.
We now illustrate how the principle of mathematical induction is ap-
plied in practice. The reader may not recognize Theorem 1.10 as the
statement of the familiar principle of mathematical induction. So we shall
prove a formula using Theorem 1.10.
Example 1
Show that
(1.1)
1 + 2 + . . . + n  n(n + 1)
2
for every natural number n.
Solution. Let S be the set of natural numbers n for which the formula (1.1)
holds. We shall show that S is an inductive set.
(a) Clearly 1 ∈S, since formula (1.1) holds for n  1.
(b) Suppose k ∈S. Then formula (1.1) holds with n  k. Adding (k +1)
to both sides, we see that
1 + . . . + k + (k + 1)  k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1)  (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
,
which is formula (1.1) for n  k + 1. Thus (k + 1) is in S whenever
k is.
Combining (a) and (b), we conclude that S is an inductive set of natural
numbers and so consists of all natural numbers. Therefore formula (1.1)
holds for all natural numbers.

Mathematical Induction
21
Now mathematical induction can be used to establish Proposition 1.2
of Section 1.2. We state the result in the next theorem.

Since the set of natural numbers N is identical with the set of positive
integers, the fact that a natural number is positive follows from the axiom
of inequality and the deﬁnition of N.
Theorem 1.12 (The well-ordering principle)
Any nonempty set T of natural numbers contains a smallest element.
Proof
Let k be a member of T. We deﬁne a set S of natural numbers by the
relation
S  {p : p ∈T and p ≤k}.
The set S contains a portion (not necessarily all) of the set consisting of
the natural numbers {1, 2, 3, . . . , k −1, k}. Thus since S is ﬁnite, it has
a smallest element, which we denote by s. We now show that s is the
smallest element of T. First, since s ∈S and S ⊂T, then s ∈T. Suppose
t is any element of T different from s. If t > k, then the inequality k ≥s
implies that t > s. On the other hand, if t ≤k, then t ∈S. Since s is the
smallest element of S and s ̸ t, we have s < t. Thus s is smaller than
any other element of T, and the proof is complete.

Continuity and
Limits
2.1
Continuity
Most of the functions we study in elementary calculus are described by
formulas. These functions almost always possess derivatives. In fact, a
portion of any ﬁrst course in calculus is devoted to the development of
routine methods for computing derivatives. However, not all functions
possess derivatives everywhere. For example, the functions (1 + x2)/x,
cot x, and sin(1/x) do not possess derivatives at x  0 no matter how
they are deﬁned at x  0.
As we progress in the study of analysis, it is important to enlarge
substantially the class of functions we examine. Functions that possess
derivatives everywhere form a rather restricted class; extending this
class to functions that are differentiable except at a few isolated points
does not enlarge it greatly. We wish to investigate signiﬁcantly larger
classes of functions, and to do so we introduce the notion of a continuous
function.
Deﬁnitions
Suppose that f is a function from a domain D in R1 to R1. The function f
is continuous at a if (i) the point a is in an open interval I contained in
D, and (ii) for each positive number ε there is a positive number δ such
that
|f(x) −f(a)| < ε
whenever
|x −a| < δ.
23

24
2.
Continuity and Limits
If f is continuous at each point of a set S, we say that f is continuous on
S. A function f is called continuous if it is continuous at every point of
its domain.
The geometric signiﬁcance of continuity at a point a is indicated in
Figure 2.1. We recall that the inequality |f(x) −f(a)| < ε is equivalent to
the double inequality
−ε < f(x) −f(a) < ε,
Figure 2.1 The graph of f is in the rectangle for a −δ < x < a + δ.
or
f(a) −ε < f(x) < f(a) + ε.
Similarly, the inequality |x −a| < δ is equivalent to the two inequalities
a −δ < x < a + δ.
We construct the four lines x  a −δ, x  a + δ, y  f(a) −ε, and
y  f(a) + ε, as shown in Figure 2.1. The rectangle determined by these
four lines has its center at the point with coordinates (a, f(a)). The geo-
metric interpretation of continuity at a point may be given in terms of
this rectangle. A function f is continuous at a if for each ε > 0 there is a
number δ > 0 such that the graph of f remains within the rectangle for
all x in the interval (a −δ, a + δ).
It is usually very difﬁcult to verify continuity directly from the deﬁni-
tion. Such veriﬁcation requires that for every positive number ε we exhibit
a number δ and show that the graph of f lies in the appropriate rectangle.
However, if the function f is given by a sufﬁciently simple expression, it
is sometimes possible to obtain an explicit value for the quantity δ corre-

sponding to a given number ε. We describe the method by means of two
examples.
Example 1
Given the function
f : x →
1
x + 1 ,
x ̸ −1,
and a  1, ε  0.1, ﬁnd a number δ such that |f(x) −f(1)| < 0.1 for
|x −1| < δ.
Figure 2.2
Solution. We sketch the graph of f and observe that f is decreasing for
x > −1 (see Figure 2.2). The equations f(x)−f(1)  0.1, f(x)−f(1)  −0.1
can be solved for x. We ﬁnd
1
x + 1 −1
2  0.1 ⇔x  2
3
and
1
x + 1 −1
2  −0.1 ⇔x  3
2 .
Since f is decreasing in the interval 2
3 < x <

of f lies in the rectangle formed by the lines x 

the distance from x  1 to x 

the important general observation that when a value of δ is obtained for a

given quantity ε, then any smaller (positive) value for δ may also be used for
the same number ε.
Figure 2.3

Consider the function
f : x →

x −4
√x −2 ,
x ≥0, x ̸ 4,
4,
x  4.
If ε  0.01, ﬁnd a δ such that |f(x) −f(4)| < 0.01 for all x such that
|x −4| < δ.
Solution. If x ̸ 4, then factoring x −4, we get
f(x)  (√x −2)(√x + 2)
√x −2
 √x + 2 .
The graph of f is shown in Figure 2.3, and we observe that f is an
increasing function. We solve the equations f(x) −f(4)  0.01 and
f(x) −f(4)  −0.01 and obtain
√x + 2 −4  0.01 ⇔√x  2.01 ⇔x  4.0401,
√x + 2 −4  −0.01 ⇔√x  1.99 ⇔x  3.9601 .
Since f is increasing, it follows that |f(x) −f(4)| < 0.01 for 3.9601 < x <
4.0401. Selecting δ  0.0399, we ﬁnd that |f(x) −f(4)| < ε for |x −4| <
δ.

Deﬁnition
Suppose that a and L are real numbers and f is a function from a domain
D in R1 to R1. The number a may or may not be in the domain of f . The
function f tends to L as a limit as x tends to a if (i) there is an open
interval I containing a that, except possibly for the point a, is contained
in D, and (ii) for each positive number ε there is a positive number δ such
that
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
If f tends to L as x tends to a, we write
f(x) →L
as
x →a
and denote the number L by
lim
x→a f(x).
(i) We see that a function f is continuous at a if and only if a is in the
domain of f and f(x) →f(a) as x →a.
(ii) The condition 0 < |x −a| < δ (excluding the possibility x  a) is
used rather than the condition |x−a| < δ as in the deﬁnition of continuity,
since f may not be deﬁned at a itself.

In Problems 1 through 8 the functions are continuous at the value a given.
In each case ﬁnd a value δ corresponding to the given value of ε such that

2.2
Limits
The basic theorems of calculus depend for their proofs on certain standard
theorems on limits. These theorems are usually stated without proof in a
ﬁrst course in calculus. In this section we ﬁll the gap by providing proofs
of the customary theorems on limits. These theorems are the basis for the
formulas for the derivative of the sum, product, and quotient of functions
as well as for the Chain rule.
Theorem 2.1 (Limit of a constant)
If c is a number and f (x)  c for all x on R1, then for every real number a
lim
x→a f(x)  c.
Proof
In the deﬁnition of limit, we may choose δ  1 for every positive ε. Then
|f(x) −c|  |c −c|  0 < ε
for
|x −a| < 1.
Theorem 2.2 (Obvious limit)
If f (x)  x for all x on R1 and a is any real number, then
lim
x→a f(x)  a.
Proof
In the deﬁnition of limit, we may choose δ  ε. Then, since f(x) −f(a) 
x −a, we clearly have
|f(x) −f(a)|  |x −a| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < ε.
Theorem 2.3 (Limit of a sum)
Suppose that
lim
x→a f1(x)  L1
and
lim
x→a f2(x)  L2.
Deﬁne g(x)  f1(x) + f2(x). Then
lim
x→a g(x)  L1 + L2.

2.2.
Limits
29
Proof
Let ε > 0 be given. Then, using the quantity ε/2, there are positive
numbers δ1 and δ2 such that
|f1(x) −L1| < ε
2
for all x satisfying 0 < |x −a| < δ1
and
|f2(x) −L2| < ε
2
for all x satisfying 0 < |x −a| < δ2.
Deﬁne δ as the smaller of δ1 and δ2. Then
|g(x) −(L1 + L2)|  |f1(x) −L1 + f2(x) −L2|
≤|f1(x) −L1| + |f2(x) −L2|,
and for 0 < |x −a| < δ, it follows that
|g(x) −(L1 + L2)| < ε

The result is established.

The corollary may be established by induction.
Theorem 2.4 (Limit of a product)
Suppose that
lim
x→a f1(x)  L1
and
lim
x→a f2(x)  L2.
Deﬁne g(x)  f1(x) · f2(x). Then
lim
x→a g(x)  L1L2.
Proof
Suppose that ε > 0 is given. We wish to show that there is a δ > 0 such
that
|g(x) −L1L2| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
If ε1 and ε2 are positive numbers (their exact selection will be made later),
there are positive numbers δ1 and δ2 such that
(2.1)
|f1(x) −L1| < ε1
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ1

30
2.
Continuity and Limits
and
(2.2)
|f2(x) −L2| < ε2
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ2.
We ﬁrst show that |f1(x)| < |L1| + ε1 for 0 < |x −a| < δ1. To see this, we
write
f1(x)  f1(x) −L1 + L1;
hence
|f1(x)| ≤|f1(x) −L1| + |L1| < ε1 + |L1|.
Deﬁne M  |L1| + ε1. To establish the result of the theorem, we use the
identity
g(x) −L1L2  L2(f1(x) −L1) + f1(x)(f2(x) −L2).
Now we employ the triangle inequality for absolute values as well as
inequalities (2.1) and (2.2) to get
|g(x) −L1L2| ≤|L2| · |f1(x) −L1| + |f1(x)| · |f2(x) −L2|
≤|L2| · ε1 + M · ε2.
Select ε1  (ε/2)L2 and ε2  (ε/2)M. The quantities δ1 and δ2 are those
that correspond to the values of ε1 and ε2 respectively. Then with δ as the
smaller of δ1 and δ2, it follows that∗
|g(x) −L1L2| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
Corollary
Suppose that fi(x) →Li as x →a for i  1,2, . . . ,n, and suppose that
g(x)  f1(x) · · · fn(x). Then limx→a g(x)  L1L2 · · · Ln.
Theorem 2.5 (Limit of a composite function)
Suppose that f and g are functions on R1 to R1. Deﬁne the composite function
h(x)  f [g(x)]. If f is continuous at L and if g(x) →L as x →a, then
lim
x→a h(x)  f(L).
Proof
Since f is continuous at L, we know that for every ε > 0 there is a δ1 > 0
such that
|f(t) −f(L)| < ε
whenever
|t −L| < δ1.
From the fact that g(x) →L as x →a, it follows that for every ε′ > 0,
there is a δ > 0 such that
|g(x) −L| < ε′
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
∗This proof assumes that L2 ̸ 0. A slight modiﬁcation of the proof establishes the
result if L2  0.

2.2.
Limits
31
In particular, we may select ε′  δ1. Then f [g(x)] is deﬁned, and
|f [g(x)] −f(L)| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
Theorem 2.6 (Limit of a quotient)
Suppose that
lim
x→a f(x)  L
and
lim
x→a g(x)  M.
Deﬁne h(x)  f (x)/g(x). If M ̸ 0, then
lim
x→a h(x)  L/M.
The proof of Theorem 2.6 is a direct consequence of Theorems 2.4 and
2.5. We leave the details to the reader.
Theorem 2.7 (Limit of inequalities)
Suppose that
lim
x→a f(x)  L
and
lim
x→a g(x)  M.
If f (x) ≤g(x) for all x in some interval about a (possibly excluding a itself ),
then
L ≤M.
Proof
We assume that L > M and reach a contradiction. Let us deﬁne ε 
(L −M)/2; then from the deﬁnition of limit there are positive numbers
δ1 and δ2 such that
|f(x) −L| < ε
for all x satisfying
0 < |x −a| < δ1
and
|g(x) −M| < ε
for all x satisfying
0 < |x −a| < δ2.
We choose a positive number δ that is smaller than δ1 and δ2 and further-
more so small that f(x) ≤g(x) for 0 < |x −a| < δ. In this interval, we
have
M −ε < g(x) < M + ε
and
L −ε < f(x) < L + ε.
Since M + ε  L −ε, it follows that
g(x) < M + ε  L −ε < f(x);
then f(x) > g(x), a contradiction.

Theorem 2.8 (Sandwiching theorem)
Suppose that f , g, and h are functions deﬁned on the interval 0 < |x −a| < k
for some positive number k. If f (x) ≤g(x) ≤h(x) on this interval and if
lim
x→a f(x)  L,
lim
x→a h(x)  L,
then limx→a g(x)  L.
Proof
Given any ε > 0, there are positive numbers δ1 and δ2 (which we take
smaller than k) such that
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ1
and
|h(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ2.
In other words, L −ε < f(x) < L + ε and L −ε < h(x) < L + ε for all x
such that 0 < |x −a| < δ, where δ is the smaller of δ1 and δ2. Therefore,
L −ε < f(x) ≤g(x) ≤h(x) < L + ε
in this interval. We conclude that |g(x) −L| < ε for 0 < |x −a| < δ, and
the result is established.

2.3.
One-Sided Limits
33
2.3
One-Sided Limits
The function f : x →√x is continuous for all x > 0, and since
√
0  0,
it is clear that f(x) →f(0) as x tends to 0 through positive values. Since f
is not deﬁned for negative values of x, the deﬁnition of continuity given
in Section 2.1 is not fulﬁlled at x  0. We now extend the deﬁnition of
continuous function so that a function such as √x will have the natural
property of continuity at the endpoint of its domain. For this purpose we
need the concept of a one-sided limit.
Deﬁnition
Suppose that f is a function from a domain D in R1 to R1. The function f
tends to L as x tends to a from the right if (i) there is an open interval I
in D that has a as its left endpoint and (ii) for each ε > 0 there is a δ > 0
such that
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < x −a < δ.
If f tends to L as x tends to a from the right, we write
f(x) →L
as
x →a+,
and we denote the number L by
lim
x→a+ f(x).
A similar deﬁnition is employed for limits from the left. In this case the
condition 0 < x −a < δ is replaced by
0 < a −x < δ,
and the notation f(x) →L as x →a−,
lim
x→a−f(x)  L,
is used.
The condition 0 < |x −a| < δ is equivalent to the two conditions
0 < x −a < δ and 0 < a −x < δ. All the theorems on limits that were
stated and proved in Section 2.2 used the inequality 0 < |x −a| < δ.
As a result, all the theorems on limits imply corresponding theorems for
limits from the left and limits from the right.
The deﬁnition of one-sided limit leads to the deﬁnition of one-sided
continuity.
Deﬁnitions
A function f is continuous on the right at a if a is in the domain of f
and f(x) →f(a) as x →a+. The function f is continuous on the left at
a if a is in the domain of f and f(x) →f(a) as x →a−.

Continuity and Limits
If the domain of a function f is a ﬁnite interval, say a ≤x ≤b, then
limits and continuity at the endpoints are of the one-sided variety. For
example, the function f : x →x2−3x+5 deﬁned on the interval 2 ≤x ≤4
is continuous on the right at x  2 and continuous on the left at x  4.
The following is the general deﬁnition of continuity for functions from a
set in R1 to R1.
Deﬁnitions
Let f be a function from a domain in R1 to R1. The function f is contin-
uous at a with respect to D if (i) a is in D, and (ii) for each ε > 0 there
is a δ > 0 such that
(2.3)
|f(x) −f(a)| < ε
whenever x ∈D and
|x −a| < δ.
A function f is continuous on D if it is continuous with respect to D
at every point of D.
The phrase “with respect to D” is usually omitted in the deﬁnition of
continuity since the context will always make the situation clear.
If a is a point of an open interval I contained in D, then the above
deﬁnition of continuity coincides with that given in Section 2.1.
Deﬁnition
A point a is an isolated point of a set D in R1 if there is an open interval
I such that the set I ∩D consists of the single point {a}.
A function f from a domain D in R1 to R1 is continuous at every isolated
point of D. To see this, let a be an isolated point of D and suppose I is such
that {a}  I ∩D. We choose δ > 0 so small that the condition |x −a| < δ
implies that x is in I. Then condition (ii) in the deﬁnition of continuity is
always satisﬁed, since (ii) holds when x  a, the only point in question.
The theorems of Section 2.2 carry over almost without change to the
case of one-sided limits. As an illustration we state a one-sided version of
Theorem 2.5, the limit of a composite function.
Theorem 2.9
Suppose that f and g are functions on R1 to R1. If f is continuous at L and if
g(x) →L as x →a+, then
lim
x→a+ f [g(x)]  f(L).
A similar statement holds if g(x) →L as x →a−.
The proof of Theorem 2.9 follows precisely the line of proof of Theorem
2.5. Although we always require x > a when g(x) →L, it is not true that
g(x) remains always larger than or always smaller than L. Hence it is
necessary to assume that f is continuous at L and not merely continuous
on one side.

2.3.
One-Sided Limits
35
With the aid of the general deﬁnition of continuity it is possible to show
that the function g : x →n√x, where n is a positive integer, is a continuous
function on its domain.
Theorem 2.10
For n an even positive integer, the function g:x →n√x is continuous for x on
[0,∞). For n an odd positive integer, g is continuous for x on ( −∞,∞).
Proof
For x ≥0 and any ε > 0, it follows that
|n√x −0| < ε
whenever
|x −0| < εn.
Therefore g is continuous on the right at 0 for every n. If n is odd, then
n√−x  −n√x, and g is also continuous on the left at 0.
It is sometimes easier to determine one-sided limits than two-sided
limits. The next theorem and corollary show that one-sided limits can be
used as a tool for ﬁnding ordinary limits.
Theorem 2.11 (On one- and two-sided limits)
Suppose that f is a function on R1 to R1. Then
lim
x→a f(x)  L if and only if
lim
x→a+ f(x)  L and
lim
x→a−f(x)  L.
Proof
(a) Suppose f(x) →L as x →a. Then for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0
such that f(x) is deﬁned for 0 < |x −a| < δ and
(2.4)
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
For this value of δ we have
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < x −a < δ.
This last statement implies that f(x) →L as x →a+. Similarly, since the
condition 0 < |x −a| < δ is implied by the inequality 0 < x −a < δ, it
follows from inequality (2.4) that |f(x) −L| < ε whenever 0 < a −x < δ.
Hence f(x) →L as x →a−.
(b) Now assume that both one-sided limits exist. Given any ε > 0, there
are numbers δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that f(x) is deﬁned for 0 < x−a < δ1
and 0 < a −x < δ2; moreover, the inequalities
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < x −a < δ1,
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < a −x < δ2

36
2.
Continuity and Limits
hold. If δ is the smaller of δ1 and δ2, then
|f(x) −L| < ε
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
Corollary
Suppose f is a function on R1 to R1. Then f is continuous at a if and only if
it is continuous on the left at a and continuous on the right at a.

In Problems 1 through 12, in each case determine whether or not the

Limits at Inﬁnity; Inﬁnite Limits
Consider the function
f : x →
x
x + 1 ,
x ̸ −1,
whose graph is shown in Figure 2.4. Intuitively, it is clear that f(x) tends
to 1 as x tends to inﬁnity; this statement holds when x goes to inﬁnity
through increasing positive values (i.e., x tends to inﬁnity to the right)
or when x goes to inﬁnity through decreasing negative values (x tends to
inﬁnity to the left). More precisely, the symbol
x →∞
means that x increases without bound through positive values and x de-
creases without bound through negative values. If x tends to inﬁnity only
through increasing positive values, we write
x →+∞,
while if x tends to inﬁnity only through decreasing negative values, we
write
x →−∞.
The above conventions are used to deﬁne a limit at inﬁnity.
Deﬁnitions
We say that f(x) →L as x →∞if for each ε > 0 there is a number A > 0
such that |f(x) −L| < ε for all x satisfying |x| > A.
We say that f(x) →L as x →+∞if for each ε > 0 there is an A > 0
such that |f(x) −L| < ε for all x satisfying x > A.
We say that f(x) →L as x →−∞if for each ε > 0 there is an A > 0
such that |f(x) −L| < ε for all x satisfying x < −A.

The next theorem extends Theorem 2.5 on composite functions.
Theorem 2.13 (Limit of a composite function)
Suppose that f and g are functions on R1 to R1. If f is continuous at L and
g(x) →L as x →+∞, then
lim
x→+∞f [g(x)]  f(L).
The proofs of Theorems 2.12 and 2.13 follow the pattern of the proofs
of Theorems 2.2 and 2.5, respectively.
Referring to Figure 2.4 and the function f : x →x/(x + 1), x ̸ −1,
we see that f increases without bound as x tends to –1 from the left. Also,
f decreases without bound as x tends to –1 from the right. We say that f
has an inﬁnite limit as x tends to –1; a more precise statement is given in
the next deﬁnition.
Deﬁnitions
A function f becomes inﬁnite as x →a if for each number A > 0 there
is a number δ > 0 such that |f(x)| > A for all x satisfying 0 < |x −a| < δ.
We write f(x) →∞as x →a for this limit. We also use the notation
lim
x→a f(x)  ∞,

2.4.
Limits at Inﬁnity; Inﬁnite Limits
39
although we must remember that inﬁnity is not a number and the usual
rules of algebra do not apply.
Figure 2.5 y  (1/x) cos(1/x).
If f is deﬁned only on one side of a number a rather than in a deleted
interval containing a, we may deﬁne a one-sided inﬁnite limit. A function
f becomes inﬁnite as x →a+ if for each number A > 0 there is a
number δ > 0 such that |f(x)| > A for all x satisfying 0 < x −a < δ. An
inﬁnite limit from the left is deﬁned similarly. Various other possibilities
may occur. For example, the function f : x →1/(x −1)2 has the property
that f →+∞as x →1. In such a case f has a positive inﬁnite limit as
x →1. Similarly, a function may have a negative inﬁnite limit, and it may
have both positive and negative one-sided inﬁnite limits.
Example 1
Given the function
f : x →1
x cos 1
x ,
decide whether or not f tends to a limit as x tends to 0.
Solution. For the values xn  1/(2nπ), n  1, 2, . . ., we have f(xn)  2nπ,
while for x′
n  1/((π/2)+2nπ), we have f(x′
n)  0. Hence there are certain
values, xn, tending to zero as n →∞at which f grows without bound,
while on other values, x′
n, also tending to zero, the function f always has
the value zero. Therefore, f has no limit as x →0. See Figure 2.5.

Limits at Inﬁnity; Inﬁnite Limits
41
The theorems on the limits of sums, products, and quotients of func-
tions require special treatment when one or more of the functions has an
inﬁnite limit or when the limit of a function appearing in a denominator
is zero.
In the case of the limit of the sum of two functions, the appropriate
theorem states that if
lim
x→a f(x)  L,
lim
x→a g(x)  ∞,
then
lim
x→a[f(x) + g(x)]  ∞.
If both f and g tend to inﬁnity as x tends to a, no conclusion can be drawn
without a more detailed examination of the functions f and g. We must
bear in mind that ∞cannot be treated as a number. However, we do have
the “rules”
+∞+ (+∞)  +∞
and
−∞+ (−∞)  −∞.
In the case of the limit of a product, if f(x) →L, L ̸ 0, and g(x) →∞,
as x →a, then f(x)g(x) →∞as x →a. However, if L  0, no conclusion
can be drawn without a closer investigation of the functions f and g.

Limits of Sequences
An inﬁnite sequence may or may not tend to a limit. When an inﬁnite
sequence does tend to a limit, the rules of operation are similar to those
given in Section 2.2 for limits of functions.
Deﬁnition
Given the inﬁnite sequence of numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . , we say that
{xn} tends to L as n tends to inﬁnity if and only if for each ε > 0 there
is a natural number N such that |xn −L| < ε for all n > N. We also write
xn →L as n →∞, and we say that the sequence {xn} has L as a limit.∗
The notation
lim
n→∞xn  L
will be used. If the sequence {xn} increases without bound as n tends to
inﬁnity, the symbol xn →+∞as n →∞is used; similarly if it decreases
without bound, we write xn →−∞as n →∞.
The theorems on limit of a constant, limit of equal functions, limit of
a product, limit of a quotient, limit of inequalities, and the Sandwiching
theorem have corresponding statements for sequences.
A variation of the theorem on composite functions, Theorem 2.5, leads
to the next result, which we state without proof.
Theorem 2.13
Suppose that f is continuous at a and that xn →a as n →∞. Then there is
an integer N such that f (xn) is deﬁned for all integers n > N; furthermore,
f (xn) →f (a) as n →∞.
Example

∗Strictly speaking, we should write n →+∞instead of n →∞. However, for the
natural numbers it is a long-established custom to write ∞instead of +∞; we shall continue
to observe this custom.

2.5.

ﬁnd the limits of f(xn), f(yn), and f(zn) as n →∞.
Solution. Since sin nπ  0, n  1, 2, . . . , we have f(xn) →0 as n →∞.
Also,
f(yn)  (2n + 1
2 )π sin(2n + 1

2 )π →+∞

and
f(zn)  (2n + 3
2 )π sin(2n + 3
2 )π  −(2n + 3
2 )π →−∞
as
n →∞.
Observing that xn, yn, and zn all tend to 0 as n →∞, we note that f(x)
cannot tend to a limit as x →0.
The next axiom, when added to those of Chapter 1, serves to describe
the real number system uniquely.
Axiom C (Axiom of continuity)
Suppose that an inﬁnite sequence x1,x2, . . . ,xn, . . . is such that xn+1 ≥xn for
all n, and there is a number M such that xn ≤M for all n. Then there is a
number L ≤M such that xn →L as n →∞and xn ≤L for all n.
The situation is shown in Figure 2.6. If we plot the numbers xn on a
horizontal line, the corresponding points move steadily to the right as n
increases. It is geometrically evident that they must cluster at some value
such as L that cannot exceed the number M.
Figure 2.6 xn tends to L as n →∞.
By means of Axiom C we establish the following simple result.
Theorem 2.14
(a) There is no real number M that exceeds all positive integers.
(b) If xn ≥n for every positive integer n, then xn →+∞as n →∞.
(c) limn→∞(1/n)  0.
Proof
(a) Let xn  n and suppose there is a number M such that M ≥xn for
every n. By Axiom C there is a number L such that xn →L as n →∞
and xn ≤L for all n. Choose ε  1 in the deﬁnition of limit. Then for
a sufﬁciently large integer N, it follows that L −1 < xn < L + 1 for
all n > N. But xN+1  N + 1, and so L −1 < N + 1 < L + 1. Hence
N + 2  xN+2 > L, contrary to the statement xn ≤L for all n.

44
2.
Continuity and Limits
(b) Let M be any positive number. From part (a) there is an integer N
such that N > M; hence xn > M for all n ≥N.
(c) Let ε > 0 be given. There is an integer N such that N > 1/ε. Then if
n > N, clearly 1/n < ε. The result follows.

Basic Properties

3.1
The Intermediate-Value Theorem
The proofs of many theorems of calculus require a knowledge of the
basic properties of continuous functions. In this section we establish the
Intermediate-value theorem, an essential tool used in the proofs of the
Fundamental theorem of calculus and the Mean-value theorem.
Theorem 3.1 (Nested intervals theorem)
Suppose that
In  {x : an ≤x ≤bn},
n  1, 2, . . . ,
is a sequence of closed intervals such that In+1 ⊂In for each n. If limn→∞(bn−
an)  0, then there is one and only one number x0 that is in every In.
Proof
By hypothesis, we have an ≤an+1 and bn ≤bn+1. Since an < bn for
every n, the sequence {an} is nondecreasing and bounded from above
by b1 (see Figure 3.1). Similarly, the sequence bn is nonincreasing and
bounded from below by a1. Using Axiom C, we conclude that there are
numbers x0 and x′
0 such that an →x0, an ≤x0, and bn →x′
0, bn ≥x′
0, as
n →∞. Using the fact that bn −an →0, n →∞, we ﬁnd that x0  x′
0
and
an ≤x0 ≤bn
for every n. Thus x0 is in every In.

Basic Properties of Functions on R1
Figure 3.1 Nested intervals.
The hypothesis that each In is closed is essential. The sequence of half-
open intervals
In  {x : 0 < x ≤1
n }
has the property that In+1 ⊂In for every n. Since no In contains 0, any
number x0 in all the In must be positive. But then by choosing N > 1/x0,
we see that x0 cannot belong to IN  {x : 0 < x ≤1/N}. Although the
intervals In are nested, they have no point in common.
Before proving the main theorem, we prove the following result, which
we shall use often in this chapter.
Theorem 3.2
Suppose f is continuous on [a,b], xn ∈[a,b] for each n, and xn →x0. Then
x0 ∈[a,b] and f (xn) →f (x0).
Proof
Since xn ≥a for each n, it follows from the theorem on the limit of
inequalities for sequences that x0 ≥a. Similarly, x0 ≤b so x0 ∈[a, b].
If a < x0 < b, then f(xn) →f(x0) on account of the composite function
theorem (Theorem 2.5). The same conclusion holds if x0  a or b. A
detailed proof of the last sentence is left to the reader.
We now establish the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 3.3 (Intermediate-value theorem)
Suppose f is continuous on [a,b], c ∈R1, f (a) < c, and f (b) > c. Then there
is at least one number x0 on [a,b] such that f (x0)  c.
Note that there may be more than one such x0, as indicated in Figure
3.2.
Proof
Deﬁne a1  a and b1  b. Then observe that f((a1 + b1)/2) is either equal
to c, greater than c, or less than c. If it equals c, choose x0  (a1 + b1)/2
and the result is proved. If f((a1 + b1)/2) > c, then deﬁne a2  a1 and
b2  (a1 + b1)/2. If f((a1 + b1)/2) < c, then deﬁne a2  ((a1 + b1)/2)
and b2  b1.
In each of the last two cases we have f(a2) < c and f(b2) > c. Again
compute f((a2 + b2)/2). If this value equals c, the result is proved. If

f((a2 + b2)/2) > c set a3  a2 and b3  (a2 + b2)/2. If f((a2 + b2)/2) < c,
set a3  (a2 + b2)/2 and b3  b2.
Figure 3.2 Illustrating the Intermediate-value theorem.
Continuing in this way, either we ﬁnd a solution in a ﬁnite number of
steps or we ﬁnd a sequence {[an, bn]} of closed intervals each of which is
one of the two halves of the preceding one, and for which we have
(3.1)
bn −an  (b1 −a1)/2n−1,
f(an) < c,
f(bn) > c
for each n.
From the Nested intervals theorem it follows that there is a unique point
x0 in all these intervals and that
lim
n→∞an  x0
and
lim
n→∞bn  x0.
From Theorem 3.2, we conclude that
f(an) →f(x0)
and
f(bn) →f(x0).
From inequalities (3.1) and the limit of inequalities it follows that f(x0) ≤c
and f(x0) ≥c, so that f(x0)  c.

3.2
Least Upper Bound; Greatest Lower
Bound
In this section we prove an important principle about real numbers that
is often used as an axiom in place of Axiom C.
Deﬁnitions
A set S of real numbers has the upper bound M if x ≤M for every
number x in S; we also say that the set S is bounded above by M. The set
S has the lower bound m if x ≥m for every number x in S; we also
say that S is bounded below by m. A set S is bounded if S has an upper
and a lower bound. Suppose that f is a function on R1 whose domain D
contains the set S. We denote by f |S the restriction of f to the set S;
that is, f |S has domain S and f |S(x)  f(x) for all x in S. A function f is
bounded above, bounded below, or bounded if the set R consisting of the
range of f satisﬁes the corresponding condition.
Suppose we deﬁne
f(x) 



1
2x ,
0 < x ≤1,
1,
x  0.

3.2.
Least Upper Bound; Greatest Lower Bound
49
Then f is not bounded on S  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1}. See Figure 3.3.
Figure 3.3
We now prove the fundamental principle on upper and lower bounds
(see Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4 U is the least upper bound for S.
Theorem 3.4
If a nonempty set S ⊂R1 has an upper bound M, then it has a least upper
bound U; that is, there is a unique number U that is an upper bound for S
but is such that no number U′ < U is an upper bound for S. If a nonempty
set has a lower bound m, it has a greatest lower bound L.
Proof
The second statement follows by applying the ﬁrst to the set S′  {x :
−x ∈S}. We prove the ﬁrst statement using the Nested intervals theorem.
If M ∈S, then we may take U  M, since in this case every x in S is less
than or equal to U, and if U′ < U, then U′ is not an upper bound, since
U ∈S and U > U′. If M is not in S, let b1  M and choose a1 as any point
of S. Now, either (a1 + b1)/2 is greater than every x in S, or there is some
x in S greater than or equal to (a1 + b1)/2. In the ﬁrst case, if we deﬁne
a2  a1 and b2  (a1 + b1)/2, then a2 ∈S and b2 is greater than every
x in S. In the second case, choose for a2 one of the numbers in S that is
greater than or equal to (a1 + b1)/2 and set b2  b1; then we again have
a2 ∈S and b2 greater than every x in S. Continuing in this way, we deﬁne

3.
Basic Properties of Functions on R1
an inﬁnite sequence {[an, bn]} of closed intervals such that
(3.2)
[an+1, bn+1] ⊂[an, bn]
and
(bn+1 −an+1) ≤
1
2 (bn −an)
for each n, and so for each n,
(3.3) bn −an ≤(b1−a1)/2n−1,
an ∈S,
bn > every number in S.
From the Nested intervals theorem, it follows that there is a unique
number U in all these intervals and
lim
n→∞bn  U,
lim
n→∞an  U.
Let x be any number in S. Then x < bn for each n, so that x ≤U by the
limit of inequalities. Thus U is an upper bound for S. But now let U′ < U
and let ε  U −U′. Then, since an →U, it follows that there is an N
such that U′  U −ε < an ≤U for all n > N. But since all the an ∈S, it
is clear that U′ is not an upper bound. Therefore, U is unique.
Deﬁnitions
The number U in Theorem 3.4, the least upper bound, is also called
the supremum of S and is denoted by
l.u.b. S
or
sup S.
The number L of Theorem 3.4, the greatest lower bound, is also called
the inﬁmum of S and is denoted by
g.l.b. S
or
inf S.
Corollary
If x0 is the largest number in S, that is, if x0 ∈S and x0 is larger than every
other number in S, then x0  sup S. If S is not empty and U  sup S, with U
not in S, then there is a sequence {xn} such that each xn is in S and xn →U.
Also, if ε > 0 is given, there is an x in S such that x > U −ε. Corresponding
results hold for inf S.
These results follow from the deﬁnitions and from the proof of
Theorem 3.4.
With the help of this corollary it is possible to show that the Axiom of
Continuity is a consequence of Theorem 3.4.
Deﬁnitions
Let f have an interval I of R1 as its domain and a set in R1 as its range.
We say that f is increasing on I if f(x2) > f(x1) whenever x2 > x1. The
function f is nondecreasing on I if f(x2) ≥f(x1) whenever x2 > x1. The
function f is decreasing on I if f(x2) < f(x1) whenever x2 > x1. The
function f is nonincreasing on I if f(x2) ≤f(x1) whenever x2 > x1. A

51
function that has any one of these four properties is called monotone
on I.
Monotone functions are not necessarily continuous, as the following
step function exhibits:
f : x →n,
n −1 ≤x < n,
n  1, 2, . . . .
See Figure 3.5. Also, monotone functions may not be bounded. The func-
tion f : x →1/(1 −x) is monotone on the interval I  {x : 0 ≤x < 1}
but is not bounded there.
Figure 3.5 A step function.
If a function f deﬁned on an interval I is continuous on I, then an
extension of the Intermediate-value theorem shows that the range of
f is an interval. In order to establish this result, we use the following
characterization of an interval on R1.
Theorem 3.5
A set S in R1is an interval ⇔(i) S contains more than one point and (ii) for
every x1,x2 ∈S the number x is in S whenever x ∈(x1,x2).
Proof
If S is an interval, then clearly the two properties hold. Therefore, we
suppose that (i) and (ii) hold and show that S is an interval. We consider
two cases.
Case 1: S is bounded. Deﬁne a  inf S and b  sup S. Let x be an
element of the open interval (a, b). We shall show that x ∈S.

52
3.
Basic Properties of Functions on R1
Since a  inf S, we use the corollary to Theorem 3.4 to assert that
there is an x1 ∈S with x1 < x. Also, since b  sup S, there is an x2 in S
with x2 > x. Hence x ∈(x1, x2), which by (ii) of the hypothesis shows that
x ∈S. We conclude that every element of (a, b) is in S. Thus S is either
a closed interval, an open interval, or a half-open interval; its endpoints
are a, b.
Case 2: S is unbounded in one direction. Assume that S is unbounded
above and bounded below, the case of S bounded above and unbounded
below being similar. Let a  inf S. Then S ⊂[a, ∞). Let x be any number
such that x > a. We shall show that x ∈S. As in Case 1, there is a number
x1 ∈S such that x1 < x. Since S has no upper bound there is an x2 ∈S
such that x2 > x. Using (ii) of the hypothesis, we conclude that x ∈S.
Therefore, S  [a, ∞) or S  (a, ∞).
We now establish a stronger form of the Intermediate-value theorem.
Theorem 3.6
Suppose that the domain of f is an interval I and f is continuous on I. Assume
that f is not constant on I. Then the range of f , denoted by J, is an interval.
Proof
We shall show that J has properties (i) and (ii) of Theorem 3.5 and there-
fore is an interval. Since f is not constant, its range must have more than
one point, and property (i) is established. Now let y1, y2 ∈J. Then there
are numbers x1, x2 ∈I such that f(x1)  y1 and f(x2)  y2. We may as-
sume that x1 < x2. The function f is continuous on [x1, x2], and so we
may apply the Intermediate-value theorem. If c is any number between
y1 and y2, there is an x0 ∈[x1, x2] such that f(x0)  c. Thus c ∈J, and we
have established property (ii). The set J is an interval.
If f is continuous on I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}, it is not necessarily the case
that J is determined by f(a) and f(b). Figure 3.6 shows that J may exceed
the interval [f(a), f(b)]. In fact, I may be bounded and J unbounded, as
is illustrated by the function f : x →1/x with I  {x : 0 < x < 1}.
The range is J  {y : 1 < y < ∞}. The function f : x →1/(1 + x2)
with I  {x : 0 < x < ∞} and J  {y : 0 < y < 1} is an example of a
continuous function with an unbounded domain and a bounded range.
Consider the restriction to [0, ∞) of the function f : x →xn where n is a
positive integer. By Theorem 3.6, the range of f is an interval, which must
be [0, ∞), since f(0)  0, f is increasing, and f(x) →+∞as x →+∞.
Hence, for each x ≥0, there is at least one number y ≥0 such that
yn  x. If y′ > y, then (y′)n > yn  x. Also, if 0 ≤y′ < y, then (y′)n < x.
Thus the solution y is unique. We denote it by x1/n. Every positive number
has an nth root for every positive integer n. The function x →x1/n, x ≥0,
can be shown to be continuous on [0, ∞) by the methods of Chapter 2.

The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem
Suppose that
(3.4)
x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .
is a sequence of numbers. Then the sequences x1, x3, x5, . . . and
x2, x5, x8, x11, . . . are examples of subsequences of (3.4). More generally,
suppose that k1, k2, k3, . . . , kn, . . . is an increasing sequence of positive
integers. Then we say that
xk1, xk2, . . . , xkn, . . .
is a subsequence of (3.4). The choice k1  1, k2  3, k3  5, k4  7, . . .
is an example of a subsequence of (3.4) above. To avoid double sub-
scripts, which are cumbersome, we will frequently write y1  xk1, y2 
xk2, . . . , yn  xkn, . . ., in which case
y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . .
is a subsequence of (3.4).
We easily prove by induction that if k1, k2, k3, . . . , kn, . . . is an increasing
sequence of positive integers, then kn ≥n for all n.
The sequence
(3.5)
x1  0, x2 

8 , . . . ,
which are obtained from (3.5) by taking the odd-numbered terms and
the even-numbered terms, respectively. Each of these subsequences is
convergent, but the original sequence (3.5) is not. The notion of a con-
vergent subsequence of a given sequence occurs frequently in problems
in analysis. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem is basic in that it estab-
lishes the existence of such convergent subsequences under very simple
hypotheses on the given sequence.
Theorem 3.7 (Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem)
Any bounded inﬁnite sequence of real numbers contains a convergent
subsequence.

3.3.
The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem
55
Proof
We shall use the Nested intervals theorem (Theorem 3.1). Let {xn} be a
given bounded sequence. Then it is contained in some closed interval
I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}. Divide I into two equal subintervals by the midpoint
(a + b)/2. Then either the left subinterval contains an inﬁnite number of
the {xn} or the right subinterval does (or both). Denote by I1  {x : a1 ≤
x ≤b1} the closed subinterval of I that contains inﬁnitely many {xn}. (If
both subintervals do, choose either one.) Next, divide I1 into two equal
parts by its midpoint. Either the right subinterval or the left subinterval
of I1 contains inﬁnitely many {xn}. Denote by I2 the closed subinterval
that does. Continue this process, obtaining the sequence
In  {x : an ≤x ≤bn},
n  1, 2, . . . ,
with the property that each In contains xp for inﬁnitely many values of
p. Since bn −an  (b −a)/2n →0 as n →∞, we may apply the Nested
intervals theorem to obtain a unique number x0 contained in every In.
We now construct a subsequence of {xp} converging to x0. Choose xk1
to be any member of {xp} in I1 and denote xk1 by y1. Next choose xk2 to
be any member of {xp} such that xk2 is in I2 and such that k2 > k1. We
can do this because I2 has inﬁnitely many of the {xp}. Set xk2  y2. Next,
choose xk3 as any member of {xp} in I3 and such that k3 > k2. We can
do this because I3 also has inﬁnitely may of the {xp}. Set xk3  y3. We
continue, and by induction obtain the subsequence y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . .. By
the method of selection we have
an ≤yn ≤bn,
n  1, 2, . . . .
Since an →x0, bn →x0, as n →∞, we can apply the Sandwiching
theorem (Theorem 2.8) to conclude that yn →x0 as n →∞.

3.4
The Boundedness and
Extreme-Value Theorems
In this section we establish additional basic properties of continuous
functions from R1 to R1. The Boundedness and Extreme-value theorems
proved below are essential in the proofs of the basic theorems in differ-
ential calculus. The Boundedness theorem shows that a function that is
continuous on a closed interval must have a bounded range. The Extreme-
value theorem adds additional precise information about such functions.
It states that the supremum and the inﬁmum of the values in the range
are also in the range.
Theorem 3.8 (Boundedness Theorem)
Suppose that the domain of f is the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, and f
is continuous on I. Then the range of f is bounded.
Proof
We shall assume that the range is unbounded and reach a contradiction.
Suppose that for each positive integer n, there is an xn ∈I such that
|f(xn)| > n. The sequence {xn} is bounded, and by the Bolzano–Weierstrass
theorem, there is a convergent subsequence y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . ., where
yn  xkn, that converges to an element x0 ∈I. Since f is continuous
on I, we have f(yn) →f(x0) as n →∞. Choosing ε  1, we know that
there is an N1 such that for n > N1, we have
|f(yn) −f(x0)| < 1
whenever
n > N1.
For these n it follows that
|f(yn)| < |f(x0)| + 1
for all
n > N1.
On the other hand,
|f(yn)|  |f(xkn)| > kn ≥n
for all
n.
Combining these results, we obtain
n < |f(x0)| + 1
for all
n > N1.
Clearly, we may choose n larger than |f(x0)| + 1, which is a contradic-
tion.

3.5.
Uniform Continuity
57
In Theorem 3.8, it is essential that the domain of f is closed. The
function f : x →1/(1 −x) is continuous on the half-open interval I 
{x : 0 ≤x < 1}, but is not bounded there.
Theorem 3.9 (Extreme-value theorem)
Suppose that f has for its domain the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b},
and that f is continuous on I. Then there are numbers x0 and x1 on I such
that f (x0) ≤f (x) ≤f (x1) for all x ∈I. That is, f takes on its maximum and
minimum values on I.
Proof
Theorem 3.8 states that the range of f is a bounded set. Deﬁne
M  sup f(x) for x ∈I,
m  inf f(x) for x ∈I.
We shall show that there are numbers x0, x1 ∈I such that f(x0)  m,
f(x1)  M. We prove the existence of x1, the proof for x0 being similar.
Suppose that M is not in the range of f ; we shall reach a contradiction.
The function F with domain I deﬁned by
F : x →
1
M −f(x)
is continuous on I and therefore (by Theorem 3.8) has a bounded range.
Deﬁne M  sup F(x) for x ∈I. Then M > 0 and
1
M −f(x) ≤M
or
f(x) ≤M −1
M
for x ∈I.
This last inequality contradicts the statement that M  sup f(x) for x ∈I,
and hence M must be in the range of f . There is an x1 ∈I such that
f(x1)  M.
The conclusion of Theorem 3.9 is false if the interval I is not closed.
The function f : x →x2 is continuous on the half-open interval I  {x :
0 ≤x < 1} but does not achieve a maximum value there. Note that f
is also continuous on the closed interval I1  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1}, and its
maximum on this interval occurs at x  1; Theorem 3.9 applies in this
situation.
3.5
Uniform Continuity
In the deﬁnition of continuity of a function f at a point x0, it is necessary to
obtain a number δ for each positive number ε prescribed in advance (see
Section 2.1). The number δ, which naturally depends on ε, also depends
on the particular value x0. Under certain circumstances it may happen

58
3.
Basic Properties of Functions on R1
that the same value δ may be chosen for all points x in the domain. Then
we say that f is uniformly continuous.
Deﬁnition
A function f with domain S is said to be uniformly continuous on S if
for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
|f(x1) −f(x2)| < ε
whenever
|x1 −x2| < δ
and x1, x2 are in S. The important condition of uniform continuity states
that the same value of δ holds for all x1, x2 in S.
Among the properties of continuous functions used in proving the basic
theorems of integral calculus, that of uniform continuity plays a central
role. The principal result of this section (Theorem 3.10 below) shows
that under rather simple hypotheses continuous functions are uniformly
continuous.
Figure 3.7
A function may be continuous on a set S without being uniformly
continuous. As Figure 3.7 shows, once an ε is given, the value of δ required
in the deﬁnition of ordinary continuity varies according to the location of
x1 and x2; the “steeper” the function, the smaller the value of δ required.
As an example of a continuous function that is not uniformly
continuous, consider
f : x →1
x
deﬁned on the set S  {x : 0 < x ≤1}. It is clear that f is continuous for
each x in S. However, with ε any positive number, say 1, we shall show

3.5.
Uniform Continuity
59
there is no number δ such that
|f(x1) −f(x2)| < 1
whenever
|x1 −x2| < δ
for all x1, x2 in S. To see this we choose x1  1/n and x2  1/(n + 1)
for a positive integer n. Then |f(x1) −f(x2)|  |n −(n + 1)|  1; also,
we have |x1 −x2|  1/(n(n + 1)). If n is very large, then x1 and x2 are
close together. Therefore, if a δ is given, simply choose n so large that x1
and x2 are closer together than δ. The condition of uniform continuity is
violated, since f(x1) and f(x2) may not be “close.”
An example of a uniformly continuous function on a set S is given by
(3.6)
f : x →x2
on the domain S  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1}. To see this, suppose ε > 0 is given.
We must ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that
|x2
1 −x2
2| < ε
whenever
|x1 −x2| < δ
for all x1, x2 in S. To accomplish this, choose δ  ε/2. Then, because
0 ≤x1 ≤1 and 0 ≤x2 ≤1, we have
|x2
1 −x2
2|  |x1 + x2| · |x1 −x2| < 2 · 1
2 ε  ε.
This inequality holds for all x1, x2 on [0, 1] such that |x1 −x2| < δ.
The same function (3.6) above deﬁned on the domain S1  {x : 0 ≤
x < ∞} is not uniformly continuous there. To see this, suppose ε > 0
is given. Then for any δ > 0, choose x1, x2 such that x1 −x2  δ/2 and
x1 + x2  4ε/δ. Then we have
|x2
1 −x2
2|  |x1 + x2| · |x1 −x2|  4ε
δ · 1
2 δ  2ε.
The condition of uniform continuity is violated for this x1, x2.
An important criterion for determining when a function is uniformly
continuous is established in the next result.
Theorem 3.10 (Uniform continuity Theorem)
If f is continuous on the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, then f is uniformly
continuous on I.
Proof
We shall suppose that f is not uniformly continuous on I and reach a
contradiction. If f is not uniformly continuous, there is an ε0 > 0 for
which there is no δ > 0 with the property that |f(x1) −f(x2)| < ε0 for all
pairs x1, x2 ∈I and such that |x1 −x2| < δ. Then for each positive integer
n, there is a pair x′
n, x′′
n on I such that
(3.7)
|x′
n −x′′
n| < 1
n
and
|f(x′
n) −f(x′′
n)| ≥ε0.

Basic Properties of Functions on R1
From the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, it follows that there is a subse-
quence of {x′
n}, which we denote {x′
kn}, convergent to some number x0 in
I. Then, since |x′
kn −x′′
kn| < 1/n, we see that x′′
kn →x0 as n →∞. Using
the fact that f is continuous on I, we have
f(x′
kn) →f(x0),
f(x′′
kn) →f(x0).
That is, there are positive integers N1 and N2 such that
|f(x′
kn) →f(x0)| <
1
2 ε0
for all
n > N1
and
|f(x′′
kn) →f(x0)| <
1
2 ε0
for all
n > N2.
Hence for all n larger than both N1 and N2 we ﬁnd
|f(x′
kn) −f(x′′
kn| ≤|f(x′
kn) −f(x0)| + |f(x0) −f(x′′
kn)| <
1
2 ε0 + 1
2 ε0  ε0.
This last inequality contradicts (3.7), and the result is established.
As the example of the function f : x →1/x shows, the requirement
that I be a closed interval is essential. Also, the illustration of the function
f : x →x2 on the set S1  {x : 0 ≤x < ∞} shows that Theorem 3.10 does
not apply if the interval is unbounded. It may happen that continuous
functions are uniformly continuous on unbounded sets. But these must
be decided on a case-by-case basis. See Problems 3 and 4 at the end of the
section.

3.6
The Cauchy Criterion
We recall the deﬁnition of a convergent sequence x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .. A
sequence converges to a limit L if for every ε > 0 there is a positive
integer N such that
(3.8)
|xn −L| < ε
whenever
n > N.
Suppose we are given a sequence and wish to examine the possibility of
convergence. Usually the number L is not given, so that condition (3.8)
above cannot be veriﬁed directly. For this reason it is important to have a
technique for deciding convergence that doesn’t employ the limit L of the
sequence. Such a criterion, presented below, was given ﬁrst by Cauchy.
Deﬁnition
An inﬁnite sequence {xn} is called a Cauchy sequence if and only if for
each ε > 0, there is a positive integer N such that
|xn −xm| < ε
for all m > N and all n > N.
Theorem 3.11 (Cauchy criterion for convergence)
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for convergence of a sequence {xn} is that
it be a Cauchy sequence.
Proof
We ﬁrst show that if {xn} is convergent, then it is a Cauchy sequence.
Suppose L is the limit of {xn}, and let ε > 0 be given. Then from the
deﬁnition of convergence there is an N such that
|xn −L| <
1
2 ε
for all n > N.
Let xm be any element of {xn} with m > N. We have
|xn −xm|  |xn −L + L −xm| ≤|xn −L| + |L −xm| <
1
2 ε + 1
2 ε  ε.

62
3.
Basic Properties of Functions on R1
Thus {xn} is a Cauchy sequence.
Now assume that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence; we wish to show that it
is convergent. We ﬁrst prove that {xn} is a bounded sequence. From the
deﬁnition of Cauchy sequence with ε  1, there is an integer N0 such
that
|xn −xm| < 1
for all n > N0 and m > N0.
Choosing m  N0 + 1, we ﬁnd that |xn −xN0+1| < 1 if n > N0. Also,
|xn|  |xn −xN0+1 + xN0+1| ≤|xn −xN0+1| + |xN0+1| < 1 + |xN0+1|.
Keep N0 ﬁxed and observe that all |xn| beyond xN0 are bounded by 1 +
|xN0+1|, a ﬁxed number. Now examine the ﬁnite sequence of numbers
|x1|, |x2|, . . . , |xN0|, |xN0+1| + 1
and denote by M the largest of these. Therefore, |xn| ≤M for all positive
integers n, and so {xn} is a bounded sequence.
We now apply the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem (Theorem 3.7) and
conclude that there is a subsequence {xkn} of {xn} that converges to some
limit L. We shall show that the sequence {xn} itself converges to L. Let
ε > 0 be given. Since {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, there is an N1 such that
|xn −xm| <
1
2 ε
for all n > N1 and m > N1.
Also, since {xkn} converges to L, there is an N2 such that
|xkn −L| <
1
2 ε
for all n > N2.
Let N be the larger of N1 and N2, and consider any integer n larger than
N. We recall from the deﬁnition of subsequence of a sequence that kn ≥n
for every n. Therefore,
|xn −L|  |xn −xkn + xkn −L| ≤|xn −xkn| + |xkn −L| <
1
2 ε + 1
2 ε  ε.
Since this inequality holds for all n > N, the sequence {xn} converges to
L.
As an example, we show that the sequence xn  (cos nπ)/n,
n 
1, 2, . . ., is a Cauchy sequence. Let ε > 0 be given. Choose N to be any
integer larger than 2/ε. Then we have
|xn −xm| 

cos nπ
n
−cos mπ
m
 ≤m| cos nπ| + n| cos mπ|
mn
 m + n
mn
.
If m > n, we may write
|xn −xm| ≤m + n
mn
< 2m
mn  2
n .
However, because n > N, we have n > 2/ε, and so |xn −xm| < ε, and
the sequence is a Cauchy sequence.

The Heine–Borel Theorem

3.7
The Heine–Borel Theorem
In this section we establish a theorem that is useful in the further de-
velopment of differentiation and integration. The Heine–Borel theorem
shows that “covering” a set with a collection of special sets is particularly
helpful in verifying uniform continuity.
Consider, for example, the collection of intervals
(3.9)
In 

x : 1
n < x < 1

,
n  2, 3, 4, . . . .
Any collection of intervals such as (3.9) is called a family of intervals.
The symbol F is usually used to denote the totality of intervals in the
family. Each interval is called a member (or element) of the family. Care
must be exercised to distinguish the points of a particular interval from
the interval itself. In the above example, the interval J  {x :
1
3 < x <
2
3 }
is not a member of F. However, every point of J is in every interval In for
n > 2. The points 0 < x < 1 are not themselves members of F although
each point of 0 < x < 1 is in at least one In.
Deﬁnitions
A family F of intervals is said to cover the set S in R1 if each point of S
is in at least one of the intervals of F. A family F1 is a subfamily of F if
each member of F1 is a member of F.
For example, the intervals
(3.10)
I′
n 

x :
1
2n < x < 1

,
n  1, 2, . . .
form a subfamily of family (3.9). Family (3.9) covers the set S  {x : 0 <
x < 1}, since every number x such that 0 < x < 1 is in In for all n larger
than 1/x. Thus every x is in at least one In. Family (3.10) also covers S.
More generally, we may consider a collection of sets A1, A2 . . . An, . . .,
which we call a family of sets. We use the same symbol F to denote
such a family. A family F covers a set S if and only if every point of S is
a point in at least one member of F.
The family F,
Jn  {x : n < x < n + 2},
n  0, ±1, ±2, . . . ,
covers all of R1. It is simple to verify that if any interval is removed from
F, the resulting family fails to cover R1. For example, if J1 is removed,
then no member of the remaining intervals of F contains the number 2.
We shall be interested in families of open intervals that contain in-
ﬁnitely many members and that cover a set S. We shall examine those
sets S that have the property that they are covered by a ﬁnite subfamily,
i.e., a subfamily with only a ﬁnite number of members. For example, the
family F of intervals Kn  {x : 1/(n + 2) < x < 1/n}, n  1, 2, . . .,

64
3.
Basic Properties of Functions on R1
covers the set S  {x : 0 < x <
1
2 }, as is easily veriﬁed. It may also
be veriﬁed that no ﬁnite subfamily of F  {Kn} covers S. However, if we
consider the set S1  {x : ε < x <
1
2 } for any ε > 0, it is clear that
S1 is covered by the ﬁnite subfamily {K1, K2, . . . , Kn} for any n such that
n + 2 > 1/ε.
We may deﬁne families of intervals indirectly. For example, suppose
that f : x →1/x with domain D  {x : 0 < x ≤1} is given. We obtain a
family F of intervals by considering all solution sets of the inequality
(3.11)
|f(x) −f(a)| < 1
3 ↔−1
3 < 1
x −1
a < 1
3
for every a ∈D. For each value a, the interval
(3.12)
La 

x :
3a
3 + a < x <
3a
3 −a

is the solution of Inequality (3.11). This family F  {La} covers the set
D  {x : 0 < x ≤1}, but no ﬁnite subfamily covers D.
Theorem 3.12 (Heine–Borel theorem)
Suppose that a family F of open intervals covers the closed interval I  {x:a ≤
x ≤b}. Then a ﬁnite subfamily of F covers I.
Proof
We shall suppose that an inﬁnite number of members of F are required
to cover I and reach a contradiction. Divide I into two equal parts at
the midpoint. Then an inﬁnite number of members of F are required to
cover either the left subinterval or the right subinterval of I. Denote by
I1  {x : a1 ≤x ≤b1} the particular subinterval needing this inﬁnity of
members of F. We proceed by dividing I1 into two equal parts, and denote
by I2  {x : a2 ≤x ≤b2} that half of I1 that requires an inﬁnite number
of members of F. Repeating the argument, we obtain a sequence of closed
intervals In  {x : an ≤x ≤bn}, n  1, 2, . . ., each of which requires an
inﬁnite number of intervals of F in order to be covered. Since bn −an 
(b −a)/2n →0 as n →∞, the Nested intervals theorem (Theorem 3.1)
states that there is a unique number x0 ∈I that is in every In. However,
since F covers I, there is a member of F, say J  {x : α < x < β}, such
that x0 ∈J. By choosing N sufﬁciently large, we can ﬁnd an IN contained
in J. But this contradicts the fact that inﬁnitely many intervals of F are
required to cover IN, since we found that the one interval J covers IN.
In the Heine–Borel theorem, the hypothesis that I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}
is a closed interval is crucial. The open interval J1  {x : 0 < x < 1} is
covered by the family F of intervals (3.9), but no ﬁnite subfamily of F
covers J1.

The Derivative in R1
In a ﬁrst course in calculus we learn a number of theorems on differenti-
ation, but usually the proofs are not provided. In this section we review
those elementary theorems and provide the missing proofs for the basic
results.
Deﬁnition
Let f be a function on R1 to R1. The derivative f ′ is deﬁned by the formula
(4.1)
f ′(x)  lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
.
That is, f ′ is the function whose domain consists of all x in R1 for which
the limit on the right side of equation (4.1) exists. Of course the range of
f ′ is in R1.
The following seven elementary theorems on the derivative are simple
consequences of the theorems on limits in Chapter 2.
Theorem 4.1
If f is a constant, then f ′(x)  0 for all x.

Elementary Theory of Differentiation
Theorem 4.2
Suppose that f is deﬁned on an open interval I, that c is a real number, and
that g is deﬁned by the equation g(x)  cf (x). If f ′(x) exists, then g′(x) does,
and g′(x)  cf ′(x).
Theorem 4.3
Suppose that f and g are deﬁned on an open interval I and that F is deﬁned
by the equation F(x)  f (x) + g(x). If f ′(x) and g′(x) exist, then F′(x) does,
and F′(x)  f ′(x) + g′(x).
Theorem 4.4
If f ′(a) exists for some number a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof
We write
f(a + h) −f(a) 
 f(a + h) −f(a)
h

· h.
The term in parentheses on the right approaches f ′(a), a ﬁnite number, as
h →0. The second part, namely h, tends to zero. Therefore f(a + h) −f(a)
tends to zero as h →0. That is, f is continuous at a.
Theorem 4.5
Suppose that u and v are deﬁned on an open interval I and that f is deﬁned
by the equation f (x)  u(x) · v(x). If u′(x) and v′(x) exist, then f ′(x) does, and
f ′(x)  u(x)v′(x) + u′(x)v(x).
Proof
We deﬁne 4f  f(x +h)−f(x), 4u  u(x +h)−u(x), 4v  v(x +h)−v(x).
Then a computation yields
4f  u4v + v4u + 4u · 4v.
Divide by h:
4f
h
 u 4v
h
+ v 4u
h
+ 4u · 4v
h .
As h →0, we ﬁnd 4u
h
→u′(x), 4v
h
→v′(x) and 4u →0. Hence
f ′(x)  u(x)v′(x) + v(x)u′(x).
Theorem 4.6
Suppose that u and v are deﬁned on an open interval I, that v(x) ̸ 0 for all
x ∈I, and that f is deﬁned by the equation f (x)  u(x)/v(x). If u′(x) and
v′(x) exist, then f ′(x) does, and
f ′(x)  v(x)u′(x) −u(x)v′(x)
[v(x)]2
.

The Derivative in R1

Proof
We have
4f ≡f(x + h) −f(x)  u(x + h)

With 4u  u(x + h) −u(x), 4v  v(x + h) −v(x), we ﬁnd

We leave the proof of the following theorem to the reader.
Theorem 4.7
Given f :x →xn and n is an integer, then
f ′(x)  nxn−1.
(We assume that x ̸ 0 for n < 0.)
We now establish the Chain rule (Theorem 4.9 below) which, together
with Theorems 4.1 through 4.7, forms the basis for calculating the deriva-
tives of most elementary functions. The Chain rule is a consequence of
the following lemma, which states that every differentiable function is
approximated by a linear function whose slope is the derivative.
Theorem 4.8 (Fundamental lemma of differentiation)
Suppose that f has a derivative at x0. Then there is a function η deﬁned in an
interval about 0 such that
(4.2)
f(x0 + h) −f(x0)  [f ′(x0) + η(h)] · h.
Also, η is continuous at 0 with η(0)  0.
Proof
We deﬁne η by the formula
η(h) 



1
h [f(x0 + h) −f(x0)] −f ′(x0),
h ̸ 0,
0,
h  0.
Since f has a derivative at x0, we see that η(h) →0 as h →0. Hence
η is continuous at 0. Formula (4.2) is a restatement of the deﬁnition of
η.

and
f ′(x0)  g′[u(x0)] · u′(x0).
Proof
We use the notation 4f  f(x0 + h) −f(x0), 4u  u(x0 + h) −u(x0), and
we obtain
(4.3)
4f  g[u(x0 + h)] −g[u(x0)]  g(u + 4u) −g(u).
We apply Theorem 4.8 to the right side of equation (4.3), getting
4f  [g′(u) + η(4u)]4u.
Dividing by h and letting h tend to zero, we obtain (since 4u →0 as
h →0)

The Extreme-value theorem (Theorem 3.9) shows that a function
which is continuous on a closed interval I takes on its maximum and
minimum values there. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point
of I, and if the function possesses a derivative at that point, the following
result gives a method for locating maximum (and minimum) values of
such functions.
Theorem 4.10
Suppose that f is continuous on an interval I and that f takes on its maximum
value at x0, an interior point of I. If f ′(x0) exists, then
f ′(x0)  0.
The proof follows immediately from the deﬁnition of derivative. A
similar result holds for functions that take on their minimum value at an
interior point. See Figure 4.1.
The next two theorems, Rolle’s theorem and the Mean-value theo-
rem, form the groundwork for further developments in the theory of
differentiation.
Theorem 4.11 (Rolle’s theorem)
Suppose that f is continuous on the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, and that
f has a derivative at each point of I1  {x:a < x < b}. If f (a)  f (b)  0,
then there is a number x0 ∈I1 such that f ′(x0)  0.

Figure 4.1
Proof
Unless f(x) ≡0, in which case the result is trivial, f must be positive
or negative somewhere. Suppose it is positive. Then according to the
Extreme-value theorem, f achieves its maximum at some interior point,
say x0. Now we apply Theorem 4.10 to conclude that f ′(x0)  0. If f is
negative on I1, we apply the same theorems to the minimum point.
Theorem 4.12 (Mean-value theorem)
Suppose that f is continuous on the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b} and
that f has a derivative at each point of I1  {x:a < x < b}. Then there exists
a number ξ ∈I1 such that
f ′(ξ)  f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
Proof
We construct the function
F(x)  f(x) −f(b) −f(a)
b −a
(x −a) −f(a).
We have
F′(x)  f ′(x) −f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
By substitution, we see that F(a)  F(b)  0. Thus F satisﬁes the hypothe-
ses of Rolle’s theorem, and there is a number ξ ∈I1 such that F′(ξ)  0.

Hence
0  F′(ξ)  f ′(ξ) −f(b) −f(a)

,
and the result is established. See Figure 4.2.
The next theorem, a direct consequence of the Mean-value theorem,
is useful in the construction of graphs of functions. The proof is left to
the reader; see Problem 10 at the end of this section.
Theorem 4.13
Suppose that f is continuous on the closed interval I and has a derivative at
each point of I1, the interior of I.
(a). If f ′ is positive on I1, then f is increasing on I.
(b). If f ′ is negative on I1, then f is decreasing on I.

See Figure 4.1.
L’Hˆopital’s rule, so useful in the evaluation of indeterminate forms, has
its theoretical basis in the following three theorems.
Theorem 4.14 (Generalized Mean-value theorem)
Suppose that f and F are continuous functions deﬁned on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}.
Suppose that f ′ and F′ exist on I1  {x:a < x < b}, the interior of I, and that
F′(x) ̸ 0 for x ∈I1. Then
(i) F(b) −F(a) ̸ 0, and
(ii) there is a number ξ ∈I1 such that

The Derivative in R1

(4.4)
f(b) −f(a)
F(b) −F(a)  f ′(ξ)
F′(ξ) .
Proof
According to the Mean-value theorem applied to F, there is a number
η ∈I1 such that F(b) −F(a)  F′(η)(b −a). Since F′(η) ̸ 0, we conclude
that F(b) −F(a) ̸ 0, and (i) is proved. To prove (ii), deﬁne the function
φ on I by the formula
φ(x)  f(x) −f(a) −f(b) −f(a)
F(b) −F(a) [F(x) −F(a)].
A simple calculation shows that φ(a)  φ(b)  0; thus Rolle’s theorem
can be applied to φ. The number ξ ∈I1 such that φ′(ξ)  0 yields
0  φ′(ξ)  f ′(ξ) −f(b) −f(a)
F(b) −F(a) F′(ξ),
which is equation (4.4).
Theorem 4.15 (L’Hˆopital’s rule for 0/0)
Suppose that f and F are continuous functions on I  {x:a < x < b} and
that f ′ and F′ exist on I with F′ ̸ 0 on I. If
lim
x→a+ f(x)  lim
x→a+ F(x)  0 and lim
x→a+
f ′(x)
F′(x)  L,
then
lim
x→a+
f(x)
F(x)  L.
Proof
We extend the deﬁnitions of f and F to the half-open interval I1  {a ≤
x < b} by setting f(a)  0, F(a)  0. Since F′(x) ̸ 0 on I and F(a)  0,
we see from Theorem 4.12 that F(x) ̸ 0 on I. Let ϵ > 0 be given. Then
there is a δ > 0 such that

where ξ is such that a < ξ < x < a + δ. Since ϵ is arbitrary, the result
follows.
Corollary 1
L’Hˆopital’s rule holds for limits from the left as well as limits from the right. If
the two-sided limits are assumed to exist in the hypotheses of Theorem 4.15,
then we may conclude the existence of the two-sided limit of f/F.
Corollary 2
A theorem similar to Theorem 4.15 holds for limits as x →+∞, −∞, or ∞.
Proof of Corollary 2.
Assume that
lim
x→+∞f(x)  lim
x→+∞F(x)  0,
lim
x→+∞
f ′(x)
F′(x)  L, F′(x) ̸ 0 on I.
We let z  1/x and deﬁne the functions g and G by the formulas

g′(z)  −1
z2 f ′

z2 F′

so that g′(z)/G′(z) →L, g(z) →0, and G(z) →0 as z →0+. Hence we
apply Theorem 4.15 to g/G, and the result is established. The argument
when x →−∞or ∞is similar.
Theorem 4.16 (L’Hˆopital’s rule for ∞/∞)
Suppose that f ′ and F′ exist on I  {x:a < x < b}. If
lim
x→a+ f(x)  lim
x→a+ F(x)  ∞, and lim
x→a+
f ′(x)
F′(x)  L,
and if F′(x) ̸ 0 on I, then
lim
x→a+
f(x)
F(x)  L.
Theorem 4.16 holds for limits from the left as well as limits from the
right. The proof is more complicated than the proof of Theorem 4.15
although the same in principle. We omit the details.
Indeterminate forms such as 0 · ∞, 1∞, and ∞−∞may frequently be
reduced by algebraic manipulation and by use of the logarithm function
to 0/0 or ∞/∞. Then we may apply Theorem 4.15 or 4.16. Sometimes
f ′(x)/F′(x) as well as f(x)/F(x) is indeterminate. In such cases, we can

apply Theorem 4.15 or 4.16 to f ′/F′ and see whether or not f ′′/F′′ tends
to a limit. This process may be applied any number of times.

Solution. Set f : x →1 + x −ex and F : x →2x2. Then limx→0(f(x)/F(x))
yields the indeterminate form 0/0. We try to apply Theorem 4.15 and ﬁnd
that limx→0(f ′(x)/F′(x)) also gives 0/0. A second attempt at application of
the theorem shows that
lim
x→0

Hence limx→0(f ′(x)/F′(x))  −1

Inverse Functions in R1
We have seen in Section 1.2 that a relation from R1 to R1 is a set of
ordered pairs of real numbers; that is, a relation is a set in R2. A function
from R1 to R1 is a particular case of a relation, one in which no two ordered
pairs have the same ﬁrst element.
Deﬁnition
Suppose that S is a relation from R1 to R1. We deﬁne the inverse relation
of S as the set of pairs (x, y) such that (y, x) is in S.
If S is the solution set in R2 of an equation such as f(x, y)  0, the
inverse of S is the solution set in R2 of the equation f(y, x)  0. Suppose
that f is a function, and we consider the ordered pairs in R2 that form
the graph of the equation y  f(x). Then the inverse of f is the graph
of the equation x  f(y). The simplest examples of functions show that
the inverse of a function is a relation, but not necessarily a function. For
example, the function f : x →x2, with graph y  x2, has for its inverse
the relation whose graph is given by y2  x. This inverse relation is not
a function.
Theorem 4.17 (Inverse function theorem)
Suppose that f is a continuous, increasing function that has an interval I for
domain and has range J. (See Figure 4.3.) Then,
(a) J is an interval.

78
4.
Elementary Theory of Differentiation
(b) The inverse relation g of f is a function with domain J, and g is
continuous and increasing on J.
(c) We have
(4.5)
g[f (x)]  x for x ∈I and f [g(x)]  x for x ∈J.
A similar result holds if f is decreasing on I.
Proof
From the Intermediate-value theorem (Theorem 3.3) we know at once
that J is an interval. We next establish the formulas in part (c). Let x0 be
any point of J. Then there is a number y0 in I such that x0  f(y0). Since
f is increasing, y0 is unique. Hence g is a function with domain J, and
the formulas in part (c) hold. To show that g is increasing, suppose that
x1 < x2 with x1, x2 in J. Then it follows that g(x1) < g(x2), for otherwise
we would have f [g(x1)] ≥f [g(x2)] or x1 ≥x2.
We now show that g is continuous. Let x0 be an interior point of J and
suppose y0  g(x0) or, equivalently, x0  f(y0). Let x′
1 and x′
2 be points of
J such that x′
1 < x0 < x′
2. Then the points y′
1  g(x′
1) and y′
2  g(x′
2) of
I are such that y′
1 < y0 < y′
2. Hence y0 is an interior point of I. Now let
ϵ > 0 be given and chosen so small that y0 −ϵ and y0 + ϵ are points of
I. We deﬁne x1  f(y0 −ϵ) and x2  f(y0 + ϵ). See Figure 4.3. Since g is
increasing,
y0 −ϵ  g(x1) ≤g(x) ≤g(x2)  y0 + ϵ for all x such that x1 ≤x ≤x2.
Figure 4.3 f and g are inverse functions.
Because y0  g(x0), the above inequalities may be written
g(x0) −ϵ ≤g(x) ≤g(x0) + ϵ for x1 ≤x ≤x2.
Choosing δ as the minimum of the distances x2 −x0 and x0 −x1, we obtain
|g(x) −g(x0)| < ϵ whenever |x −x0| < δ.

Inverse Functions in R1
79
That is, g is continuous at x0, an arbitrary interior point of J. A slight
modiﬁcation of the above argument shows that if the range J contains its
endpoints, then g is continuous on the right at c and continuous on the
left at d.
The proof of Theorem 4.17 for functions that are decreasing is com-
pletely analogous. In this case the inverse function g is also decreasing. If
the function f in the Inverse function theorem has a derivative, then the
following result on the differentiability of the inverse function g holds.
Theorem 4.18 (Inverse differentiation theorem)
Suppose that f satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 4.17. Assume that x0 is a
point of J such that f ′[g(x0)] is deﬁned and is different from zero. Then g′(x0)
exists and
(4.6)
g′(x0) 
1
f ′[g(x0)] .
Proof
From Theorem 4.17 we have formula (4.5),
f [g(x)]  x.
Using the Chain rule, we conclude that g′(x) exists and
f ′[g(x0)]g′(x0)  1.
Since f ′ ̸ 0 by hypothesis, the result follows.
It is most often the case that a function f is not always increasing or
always decreasing. In such situations the inverse relation of f may be
analyzed as follows: First ﬁnd the intervals I1, I2, . . . on each of which
f is always increasing or always decreasing. Denote by fi the function
f restricted to the interval Ii, i  1, 2, . . .. Then the inverse of each fi
is a function which we denote by gi. These inverses may be analyzed
separately and differentiation applied to the formulas fi[gi(x)]  x, i 
1, 2, . . ..
For example, suppose f : x →x2 is deﬁned on I  {x : −∞< x < ∞}.
Then f is increasing on the interval I1  {x : 0 ≤x < ∞} and decreasing
on I2  {x : −∞< x ≤0}. The restriction of f to I1, denoted by f1,
has the inverse g1 : x →√x with domain J1  {x : 0 ≤x < ∞}. The
restriction of f to I2, denoted by f2, has the inverse g2 : x →−√x, also
with domain J1. Equations (4.5) become in these two cases
(√x)2  x
for x ∈J1,
√
x2  x
for x ∈I1,
(−√x)2  x
for x ∈J1,

The inverse relation of f is g1 ∪g2.

5.1
The Darboux Integral for Functions
on RN
The reader is undoubtedly familiar with the idea of the integral and with
methods of performing integrations. In this section we deﬁne the integral
precisely and prove the basic theorems for the processes of integration.
Let f be a bounded function whose domain is a closed interval I  {x :
a ≤x ≤b}. We subdivide I by introducing points t1, t2, . . . , tn−1 that are
interior to I. Setting a  t0 and b  tn and ordering the points so that t0 <
t1 < t2 < . . . < tn, we denote by I1, I2, . . . , In the intervals Ii  {x : ti−1 ≤
x ≤ti}. Two successive intervals have exactly one point in common.
(See Figure 5.1.) We call such a decomposition of I into subintervals a
subdivision of I, and we use the symbol 4 to indicate such a subdivision.
Since f is bounded on I, it has a least upper bound (l.u.b.), denoted by
M. The greatest lower bound (g.l.b.) of f on I is denoted by m. Similarly,
Mi and mi denote the l.u.b. and g.l.b., respectively, of f on Ii. The length
of the interval Ii is ti −ti−1; it is denoted by l(Ii).

denoted S+(f, 4), is deﬁned by

Figure 5.1 A subdivision of I.
Suppose 4 is a subdivision a  t0 < t1 < . . . < tn−1 < tn  b,
with the corresponding intervals denoted by I1, I2, . . . , In. We obtain a
new subdivision by introducing additional subdivision points between
the various {ti}. This new subdivision will have subintervals I′
1, I′
2, . . . , I′
m
each of which is a part (or all) of one of the subintervals of 4. We denote
this new subdivision by 4′ and call it a reﬁnement of .
Suppose that 41 with subintervals I1, I2, . . . , In and that 42 with subin-
tervals J1, J2, . . . , Jm are two subdivisions of an interval I. We get a new
subdivision of I by taking all the endpoints of the subintervals of both
41 and 42, arranging them in order of increasing size, and then label-
ing each subinterval having as its endpoints two successive subdivision
points. Such a subdivision is called the common reﬁnement of 1 and
2, and each subinterval of this new subdivision is of the form Ii ∩Jk,
i  1, 2, . . . , n, k  1, 2, . . . , m. Each Ii ∩Jk is either empty or entirely
contained in a unique subinterval (Ii) of 4i and a unique subinterval (Jk)
of 42. An illustration of such a common reﬁnement is exhibited in Figure
5.2.

Deﬁnitions
If f is a function on R1 that is deﬁned and bounded on I  {x : a ≤x ≤b},
we deﬁne its upper and lower Darboux integrals by
 b
a
f(x)dx  inf S+(f, 4) for all subdivisions 4 of I,
 b
a
f(x)dx  sup S−(f, 4) for all subdivisions 4 of I.
If
 b
a
f(x)dx 
 b
a
f(x)dx,
we say that f is Darboux integrable, or just integrable, on I, and we
designate the common value by
 b
a
f(x)dx.
The following results are all direct consequences of the above
deﬁnitions.
Theorem 5.2
If m ≤f (x) ≤M for all x ∈I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, then
m(b −a) ≤
 b
a
f(x)dx ≤
 b
a
f(x)dx ≤M(b −a).
Proof
Let 41 and 42 be subdivisions of I. Then from parts (a) and (c) of Theorem
5.1, it follows that
m(b −a) ≤S−(f, 41) ≤S+(f, 42) ≤M(b −a).
We keep 41 ﬁxed and let 42 vary over all possible subdivisions. Thus
S+(f, 42) is always larger than or equal to S−(f, 41), and so its greatest
lower bound is always larger than or equal to S−(f, 41). We conclude that
m(b −a) ≤S−(f, 41) ≤
 b
a
f(x)dx ≤M(b −a).
Now letting 41 vary over all possible subdivisions, we see that the least
upper bound of S−(f, 41) cannot exceed
 b
a f(x)dx. The conclusion of the
theorem follows.
The next theorem states simple facts about upper and lower Darboux
integrals. The results all follow from the deﬁnitions of inf, sup, and upper
Darboux and lower Darboux integrals.

Then formula (5.3) above is valid whether or not b is between a and c so
long as all the integrals exist.
It is important to be able to decide when a particular function is inte-
grable. The next theorem gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
integrability.
Theorem 5.4
Suppose that f is bounded on an interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}. Then f is
integrable ⇔for every ϵ > 0 there is a subdivision 4 of I such that
(5.4)
S+(f, 4) −S−(f, 4) < ϵ.
Proof
Suppose that condition (5.4) holds. Then from the deﬁnitions of upper
and lower Darboux integrals, we have
 b
a
f(x)dx −
 b
a
f(x)dx ≤S+(f, 4) −S−(f, 4) < ϵ.
Since this inequality holds for every ϵ > 0 and the left side of the
inequality is independent of ϵ, it follows that
 b
a
f(x)dx −
 b
a
f(x)dx  0.
Hence f is integrable.
Now assume that f is integrable; we wish to establish inequality (5.4).
For any ϵ > 0 there are subdivisions 41 and 42 such that
(5.5)
S+(f, 41) <
 b
a
f(x)dx + 1
2 ϵ and S−(f, 42) >
 b
a
f(x)dx −ϵ
2 .
We choose 4 as the common reﬁnement of 41 and 42. Then (from
Theorem 5.1)
S+(f, 4) −S−(f, 4) ≤S+(f, 41) −S−(f, 42).

The Darboux Integral for Functions on R1
87
Substituting inequalities (5.5) into the above expression and using the
fact that
 b
a f(x)dx 
 b
a f(x)dx, we obtain S+(f, 4) −S−(f, 4) < ϵ, as
required.
Corollary
If f is continuous on the closed interval I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, then f is integrable.
Proof
The function f is uniformly continuous, and hence for any ϵ > 0 there
is a δ such that
|f(x) −f(y)| <
ϵ
b −a whenever |x −y| < δ.
Choose a subdivision 4 of I such that no subinterval of 4 has length
larger than δ. This allows us to establish formula (5.4), and the result
follows from Theorem 5.4.
Theorem 5.5
(Mean-value theorem for integrals). Suppose that f is continuous on
I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}. Then there is a number ξ in I such that
 b
a
f(x)dx  f(ξ)(b −a).
Proof
According to Theorem 5.2, we have
(5.6)
m(b −a) ≤
 b
a
f(x)dx ≤M(b −a),
where m and M are the minimum and maximum of f on I, respectively.
From the Extreme-value theorem (Theorem 3.12) there are numbers x0
and x1 ∈I such that f(x0)  m and f(x1)  M. From inequalities (5.6) it
follows that
 b
a
f(x)dx  A(b −a),
where A is a number such that f(x0) ≤A ≤f(x1). Then the intermediate-
value theorem (Theorem 3.3) shows that there is a number ξ ∈I such
that f(ξ)  A.
We now present two forms of the Fundamental theorem of calcu-
lus, a result that shows that differentiation and integration are inverse
processes.

Elementary Theory of Integration
Theorem 5.6
(Fundamental theorem of calculus—ﬁrst form). Suppose that f is
continuous on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, and that F is deﬁned by
F(x) 
 x
a
f(t)dt.
Then F is continuous on I, and F′(x)  f (x) for each x ∈I1  {x:a < x < b}.
Proof
Since f is integrable on every subinterval of I, we have
 x+h
a
f(t)dt 
 x
a
f(t)dt +
 x+h
x
f(t)dt,
or
F(x + h)  F(x) +
 x+h
x
f(t)dt.
We apply the Mean-value theorem for integrals (Theorem 5.5) to the last
term on the right, getting
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
 f(ξ),
where ξ is some number between x and x + h. Now, let ϵ > 0 be given.
There is a δ > 0 such that |f(y) −f(x)| < ϵ for all y on I1 (taking ξ  y)
with |y −x| < δ. Thus, if 0 < |h| < δ, we ﬁnd that

F(x + h) −F(x)
h
−f(x)
  |f(ξ) −f(x)| < ϵ,
since |ξ −x| ≤|h| < δ. Since this is true for each ϵ > 0, the result
follows.
Theorem 5.7
(Fundamental theorem of calculus—second form). Suppose that f and
F are continuous on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b} and that F′(x)  f (x) for each
x ∈I1  {x:a < x < b}. Then
(5.7)
 b
a
f(x)dx  F(b) −F(a).
Proof
We consider a subdivision 4 of I. We write
F(b) −F(a) 
n

i1
{F(xi) −F(xi−1)}.
We apply the Mean-Value theorem to each term in the sum. Then as the
mesh size tends to zero we get (5.7).

The Riemann Integral
In addition to the development of the integral by the method of Darboux,
there is a technique due to Riemann that starts with a direct approxima-
tion of the integral by a sum. The main result of this section shows that
the two deﬁnitions of integral are equivalent.
Deﬁnitions
Suppose that 4 is a subdivision of I  {x : a ≤x ≤b} with subintervals
I1, I2, . . . , In. We call the mesh of the subdivision 4 the length of the
largest subinterval among l(I1), l(I2), . . . , l(In). The mesh is denoted by
∥4∥. Suppose that f is deﬁned on I and that 4 is a subdivision. In each
subinterval of 4 we choose a point xi ∈Ii. The quantity
n

i1
f(xi)l(Ii)
is called a Riemann sum.
For nonnegative functions it is intuitively clear that a Riemann sum
with very small mesh gives a good approximation to the area under the
curve. (See Figure 5.3.)
Deﬁnitions
Suppose that f is deﬁned on I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}. Then f is Riemann
integrable on I if there is a number A with the following property: For
every ϵ > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that for every subdivision 4 with mesh
smaller than δ, the inequality

Theorem 5.8
If f is Riemann integrable on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}, then f is bounded on I.

In the deﬁnition of Riemann integral, choose ϵ  1 and let 4 be a

Now select xi  x′

|f(x1) −f(x′
1)|l(I1) < 2 ⇔|f(x1) −f(x′
1)| <
2
l(I1) .
Using the general inequality |α| −|β| < |α −β|, we obtain
|f(x1)| <
2
l(I1) + |f(x′
1)|.
Fix x′
1 and observe that the above inequality is valid for every x1 ∈I1.
Hence f is bounded on I1. Now the same argument can be made for
I2, I3, . . . , In. Therefore, f is bounded on I.

thus f is Darboux integrable. Furthermore, these inequalities show that

We omit the proof of the theorem that shows that every Darboux
integrable function is Riemann integrable. Thus we state the following
result:
Theorem 5.10
A function f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] if and only if it is Darboux
integrable on [a,b].
In light of Theorem 5.10 we shall now drop the terms Darboux and
Riemann, and just refer to functions as integrable.
One of the most useful methods for performing integrations when the
integrand is not in standard form is the method known as substitution. For
example, we may sometimes be able to show that a complicated integral
has the form
 b
a
f [u(x)]u′(x)dx.
Then, if we set u  u(x), du  u′(x)dx, the above integral becomes
 u(b)
u(a)
f(u)du,
and this integral may be one we recognize as a standard integration. In
an elementary course in calculus these substitutions are usually made
without concern for their validity. The theoretical foundation for such
processes is based on the next result.
Theorem 5.11
Suppose that f is continuous on an open interval I. Let u and u′ be continuous
on an open interval J, and assume that the range of u is contained in I. If

The Logarithm and Exponential
Functions
The reader is undoubtedly familiar with the logarithm function and the
exponential function. In this section, we deﬁne these functions precisely
and develop their principal properties.
Deﬁnitions
The natural logarithm function, denoted by log, is deﬁned by the
formula
log x 
 x
1
1
t dt, x > 0.
Theorem 5.12
Let f :x →log x be deﬁned for x > 0 and suppose a and b are positive
numbers. The following statements hold:
(i) log (ab)  log a + log b.
(ii) log 1  0.
(iii) log (ar)  r log a for every rational number r.
(iv) f ′(x)  1/x.
(v) log x →+∞as x →+∞.
(vi) The range of f is all of R1.
Proof
To prove (i), we write
log(ab) 
 ab

t dt 
 a

Changing variables in the last integral on the right by letting u  t/a, we

Hence log(ab)  log a + log b.
Figure 5.4 The logarithm and its inverse.
To verify (ii) simply set b  1 in the above formula.
To establish (iii) we proceed step by step. If r is a positive integer, we get
the result from (i) with a  b and mathematical induction. For negative
integers, write a−n  1/an. Finally, if r  p/q where p and q are integers,
set u  a1/q, and thus uq  a. Hence q log u  log a. Since
ar  ap/q  up,

98
5.
Elementary Theory of Integration
we have
log(ar)  log(up)  p log u  p
q log a  r log a.
Statement (iv) is simply a statement of the Fundamental theorem of
calculus.
To prove (v), note that if x > 2n, n a positive integer, then
log x > log(2n)  n log 2 ≥1
2 n,
the last inequality being obvious from Figure 5.4(a). That the range of f
is all of R1 (vi) follows from the Intermediate-value theorem.
Since the logarithm function is strictly increasing, its inverse is a
function; therefore, the following deﬁnition makes sense.
Deﬁnition
The inverse of the logarithm function is called the exponential function
and is denoted by exp.
Theorem 5.13
If f :x →exp x is the exponential function, the following statements hold:
(i) f is continuous and increasing for all x ∈R1; the range of f is I 
{x:0 < x < +∞}.
(ii) f ′(x)  exp x for all x.
(iii) exp (x + y)  ( exp x) · ( exp y).
(iv) exp (rx)  ( exp x)r, for r rational.
(v) f (x) →+∞as x →+∞.
(vi) f (x) →0 as x →−∞.
(vii) log ( exp x)  x for all x ∈R1 and exp ( log x)  x for all x > 0.
(viii) If a > 0 and r is rational, then exp (r log a)  ar.
Proof
Items (i) and (vii) are immediate consequences of the Inverse function
theorem.
To establish (ii), ﬁrst set y  exp x. By the Chain rule applied to log y 
x, it follows that
1
y y′  1 or y′  y  exp x.
To prove (iii), set y1  exp x1 and y2  exp x2. Then x1  log y1,
x2  log y2, and
x1 + x2  log y1 + log y2  log(y1y2).
Hence
exp(x1 + x2)  y1y2  (exp x1)(exp x2).

5.3.
The Logarithm and Exponential Functions
99
The formula in (iv) is obtained by induction (as in the proof of part (iii)
of Theorem 5.12). The proofs of (v) and (vi) follow from the corresponding
results for the logarithm function. See Figure 5.4, in which we note that
since the exponential function is the inverse of the logarithm, it is the
reﬂection of the logarithm function with respect to the line y  x.
Item (viii) is simply proved: exp(r log a)  exp(log(ar))  ar.
Expressions of the form
ax, a > 0,
for x rational have been deﬁned by elementary means. If x  p/q, then
we merely take the pth power of a and then take the qth root of the result.
However, the deﬁnition of quantities such as
3
√
2, (
√
7)π
cannot be given in such an elementary way. For this purpose, we use the
following technique.
Deﬁnition
For a > 0, and x ∈R1, we deﬁne
ax  exp(x log a).
Observe that when x is rational this formula coincides with (viii) of
Theorem 5.13, so that the deﬁnition is consistent with the basic idea of
“raising to a power.”
Deﬁnitions
If b > 0 and b ̸ 1, the function logb (called logarithm to the base b) is
deﬁned as the inverse of the function f : x →bx. When b  10 we call
the function the common logarithm.
The number e is deﬁned as exp 1. In the graph of Figure 5.4(b) we can
estimate the value of e as a number slightly larger than 2.7. The following
statements about e are mostly self-evident:
(i) loge x  log x for all x > 0.
(ii) exp x  ex for all x.
(iii) Given f : x →xn for an arbitrary real number n, then f ′(x) 
nxn−1.
(iv) limx→0+(1 + x)1/x  e.
Problems
1. Given f : x →ax, show that f ′(x)  ax log a. (Theorem 5.13, Part
(ii).)
2. Given f : x →xn with n any real number; show that f ′(x)  nxn−1.
3. Show that 2 < e < 4.

4. Prove that limx→0+(1 + x)1/x  e.
5. If x > −1, show that log(1 + x) ≤x.
6. Prove that ex ≥1 + x for all x.
7. Show that F : x →[1 + (1/x)]x is an increasing function.
8. Given f : x →log x, from the deﬁnition of derivative, we know that
lim

f(x + h) −f(x)

Use this fact to deduce that limh→0(1 + h)1/h  e.

The Schwarz and Triangle
Inequalities; Metric Spaces
In Chapters 2 through 5 we developed many properties of functions from
R1 into R1 with the purpose of proving the basic theorems in differen-
tial and integral calculus of one variable. The next step in analysis is the
establishment of the basic facts needed in proving the theorems of cal-
culus in two and more variables. One way would be to prove extensions
of the theorems of Chapters 2–5 for functions from R2 into R1, then for
functions from R3 into R1, and so forth. However, all these results can
be encompassed in one general theory obtained by introducing the con-
cept of a metric space and by considering functions with domain in one
metric space and with range in a second metric space. In this chapter we
introduce the fundamentals of this theory, and in the following chapters
we apply the results to differentiation and integration in Euclidean space
in any number of dimensions.
We establish a simple version of the Schwarz inequality, one of the
most useful inequalities in analysis.
Theorem 6.1 (Schwarz inequality)
Let x  (x1,x2, . . . ,xN) and y  (y1,y2, . . . ,yN) be elements of RN. Then

The equality sign holds if and only if either all the xi are zero or there is a
number λ such that yi  λxi for i  1,2, . . . ,N.
Proof
If every xi is zero, then the equality sign in expression (6.1) holds. Assume
that there is at least one xi not zero. We form the function
f(λ) 
N

i1
(yi −λxi)2,
which is nonnegative for all values of λ. We set

Then clearly,
f(λ)  Aλ2 −2Bλ + C ≥0,
A > 0.
From elementary calculus it follows that the nonnegative minimum value
of the quadratic function f(λ) is
AC −B2
A
.
The statement AC −B2 ≥0 is equivalent to expression (6.1). The equality
sign in expression (6.1) holds if f(λ)  0 for some value of λ, say λ1; in
this case yi −λ1xi  0 for every i.
We recall that in the Euclidean plane the length of any side of a triangle
is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. A generalization
of this fact is known as the Triangle inequality. It is proved by means of a
simple application of the Schwarz inequality.
Theorem 6.2 (Triangle inequality)
Let x  (x1,x2, . . . ,xN) and y  (y1,y2, . . . ,yN) be elements of RN. Then

Since the left side of this inequality is nonnegative, we may take the
square root to obtain expression (6.2).
If all xi are zero, then equality in expression (6.2) holds. Otherwise,
equality holds if and only if it holds in the application of Theorem
6.1. The nonnegativity of λ is required to ensure that 2 N

nonnegative terms when we set yi  λxi.
Corollary
Let x  (x1,x2, . . . ,xN), y  (y1,y2, . . . ,yN), and z  (z1,z2, . . . ,zN) be
elements of RN. Then

The equality sign in expression (6.3) holds if and only if there is a number r
with 0 ≤r ≤1 such that yi  rxi + (1 −r)zi for i  1,2, . . . ,N.
Proof
Setting ai  xi −yi and bi  yi −zi for i  1, 2, . . . , N, we see that inequal-
ity (6.3) reduces to inequality (6.2) for the elements a  (a1, . . . , aN) and
b  (b1, b2, . . . , bN). The number r is λ1/(1 + λ1) in Theorem 6.1.
Remark
The corollary to Theorem 6.2 is the familiar assertion that the sum of the
lengths of any two sides of a triangle exceeds the length of the third side in
Euclidean N-dimensional space.
In this chapter we shall be concerned with sets or collections of ele-
ments, which may be chosen in any manner whatsoever. A set will be
considered fully described whenever we can determine whether or not
any given element is a member of the set.
Deﬁnition
Let S and T be sets. The Cartesian product of S and T, denoted by
S × T, is the set of all ordered pairs (p, q) in which p ∈S and q ∈T. The

104
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
Cartesian product of any ﬁnite number of sets S1, S2, . . . , SN is the set of
ordered N-tuples (p1, p2, . . . , pN) in which pi ∈Si for i  1, 2, . . . , N. We
write S1 × S2 × · · · × SN.
Examples
(1) The space RN is the Cartesian product R1 × R1 × · · · × R1 (N factors).
(2) The Cartesian product of I1  {x : a ≤x ≤b} and I2  {x : c ≤x ≤d}
is the rectangle T  {(x, y) : a ≤x ≤b, c ≤x ≤d}. That is,
T  I1 × I2.
Deﬁnition
Let S be a set and suppose d is a function with domain consisting of all
pairs of points of S and with range in R1. That is, d is a function from S × S
into R1. We say that S and the function d form a metric space when the
function d satisﬁes the following conditions
(i) d(x, y) ≥0 for all (x, y) ∈S × S; and d(x, y)  0 if and only if x  y.
(ii) d(y, x)  d(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈S × S.
(iii) d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) for all (x, y, z) ∈S. (Triangle inequality.)
The function d satisfying conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) is called the met-
ric, or distance, function in S. Hence a metric space consists of the pair
(S, d).
Examples of metric spaces
(1) In the space RN, choose
d(x, y) 

i1
(xi −yi)2,
where x  (x1, x2, . . . , xN) and y  (y1, y2, . . . , yN). The function d is
a metric. Conditions (i) and (ii) are obvious, while (iii) is precisely the
content of the corollary to Theorem 6.2. The pair (RN, d) is a metric
space. This metric, known as the Euclidean metric, is the familiar one
employed in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean geometry.
(2) In the space RN, choose
d1(x, y)  max
1≤i≤N |xi −yi|,
where x  (x1, x2, . . . , xN) and y  (y1, y2, . . . , yN). The reader can verify
that d1 is a metric. Therefore, (RN, d1) is a metric space. We observe that
this metric space is different from the space (RN, d) exhibited in the ﬁrst
example.
(3) Let C be the collection of all continuous functions that have I  {x :
0 ≤x ≤1} for domain and have range in R1. For any two elements f, g in

C, deﬁne
d(f, g)  max
1≤i≤N |f(x) −g(x)|.
It is not difﬁcult to verify that d is a metric. Hence (C, d) is a metric
space.
Examples 1 and 2 above show that a given set may become a metric
space in a variety of ways. Let S be a given set and suppose that (S, d1) and
(S, d2) are metric spaces. We deﬁne the metrics d1 and d2 as equivalent
if there are positive constants c and C such that
cd1(x, y) ≤d2(x, y) ≤Cd1(x, y)
for all x, y in S. It is not difﬁcult to show that the metrics in Examples 1
and 2 are equivalent.

(iii) Show that d is a metric and that (S, d) is a metric space.
6.2
Topology in Metric Spaces
We now develop some of the basic properties of metric spaces. From an
intuitive viewpoint we frequently think of a metric space as Euclidean
space of one, two, or three dimensions. However, the deﬁnitions and
theorems apply to all metric spaces, many of which are far removed from

6.2.
Topology in Metric Spaces
107
ordinary Euclidean space. For this reason we designate the properties as
the topology of the space.
For convenience we will use the letter S to denote a metric space with
the understanding that a metric d is attached to S.
Deﬁnitions
Let p1, p2, . . . , pn, . . . denote a sequence of elements of a metric space S.
We use the symbol {pn} to denote such a sequence. Suppose p0 ∈S. We
say that pn tends to p0 as n tends to inﬁnity if d(pn, p0) →0 as n →∞.
The notations pn →p0 and limn→∞pn  p0 will be used.
Let p0 be an element of S, a metric space, and suppose r is a positive
number. The open ball with center at p0 and radius r is the set B(p0, r)
given by
B(p0, r)  {p ∈S : d(p, p0) < r}.
The closed ball with center at p0 and radius r is the set B(p0, r) given
by
B(p0, r)  {p ∈S : d(p, p0) ≤r}.
Figure 6.1 Ball with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. The circle forming the
boundary of B(0, 1) is not part of the open ball.

Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
Figure 6.2 An open ball with center at (0, 0) and radius 1. The four sides
of the square forming the boundary of B(0, 1) are not part of the open
ball.
Deﬁnition
Let A be a set in a metric space S and suppose p0 is an element of A. We
say that p0 is an isolated point of A if for some positive number r there
is an open ball B(p0, r) such that
B(p0, r) ∩A  {p0},
where {p0} is the set consisting of the single element p0.
For example, in R1 with the Euclidean metric the set A  {x : 1 ≤x ≤
2, x  3, 4} has the elements 3 and 4 as isolated points of A. None of the
points in the interval 1 ≤x ≤2 is an isolated point of A.
Deﬁnition
A point p0 is a limit point of a set A if every open ball B(p0, r) contains
a point p of A that is distinct from p0. Note that p0 may or may not be an
element of A.
For example, in R1 with the usual Euclidean metric deﬁned by
d(x1, x2)  |x1 −x2|, the set C  {x : 1 ≤x < 3} has x  3 as a
limit point. In fact, every member of C is a limit point of C.
A set A in a metric space is closed if A contains all of its limit points.
A set A in a metric space S is open if each point p0 in A is the center
of an open ball B(p0, r) that is contained in A. That is, B(p0, r) ⊂A. It is
important to notice that the radius r may change from point to point in
A.
Theorem 6.3
A point p0 is a limit point of a set A if and only if there is a sequence {pn} with
pn ∈A and pn ̸ p0 for every n and such that pn →p0 as n →∞.

6.2.
Topology in Metric Spaces
109
Proof
(a) If a sequence {pn} of the theorem exists, then clearly every open ball
with p0 as center will have points of the sequence (all ̸ p0). Thus p0 is a
limit point.
(b) Suppose p0 is a limit point of A. We construct a sequence {pn} with the
desired properties. According to the deﬁnition of limit point, the open ball
B(p0, 1
2 ) has a point of A. Let p1 be such a point. Deﬁne r2  d(p0, p1)/2
and construct the ball B(p0, r2). There are points of A in this ball (different
from p0), and we denote one of them by p2. Next, deﬁne r3  d(p0, p2)/2
and choose p3 ∈A in the ball B(p0, r3). Continuing this process, we see
that rn < 1/2n →0 as n →∞. Since d(p0, pn) < rn, it follows that {pn}
is a sequence tending to p0, and the proof is complete.
Theorem 6.4
(a) An open ball is an open set.
(b) A closed ball is a closed set.
Proof
(a) Let B(p0, r) be an open ball. Suppose q ∈B(p0, r). We must show
that there is an open ball with center at q that is entirely in B(p0, r). Let
r1  d(p0, q). We consider a ball of radius ¯r  (r −r1)/2 with center at
q. See Figure 6.3. Let q′ be a typical point of B(q, ¯r). We shall show that
q′ ∈B(p0, r). We can accomplish this by showing that d(p0, q′) < r. We
have
d(p0, q′) ≤d(p0, q) + d(q, q′) < r1 + ¯r  r1 + 1
2 (r −r1)) 
1
2 (r + r1) < r.
Figure 6.3 An open ball is an open set.
(b) To show that B(p0, r) is a closed set we must show that every limit
point of B(p0, r) belongs to B(p0, r). If q is such a limit point, there is a
sequence p1, p2, . . . , pn, . . . in B(p0, r) such that d(pn, q) →0. However,

110
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
for each n, we have
d(pn, p0) ≤r.
Therefore
d(q, p0) ≤d(q, pn) + d(pn, p0) ≤d(q, pn) + r.
Letting n →∞, the theorem on the limit of inequalities shows that
d(q, p0) ≤r. That is, q ∈B(p0, r).
Let S be a space of elements, by which we mean that S is the totality of
points (or elements) under consideration. A set of points is a collection
of elements in S. We shall often deal with a set of sets, that is, a set whose
elements are sets in S. We speak of such a set as a family of sets and
denote it by a script letter such as F. If the number of sets in the family is
ﬁnite, we use the term ﬁnite family of sets and use subscripts to identify
the members. For example, {A1, A2, . . . , An}, where each Ai is a set in S,
is a ﬁnite family of sets.
Deﬁnitions
Let F be a family of sets, a typical member of F being denoted by the
letter A. That is, A is a set of points in a space S. We deﬁne the union of
the sets in F, denoted by 
A∈F A, by the formula
'
A∈F
A  {p : p ∈S and p is in at least one set of F}.
We deﬁne the intersection of the sets in F, denoted by 
A∈F A, by the
formula
(
A∈F
A  {p : p ∈S and p is in every set of F}.
If A and B are sets in S, we deﬁne their difference B −A by the formula
B −A  {p : p is in B and p is not in A}.
If A is any set in S, we deﬁne the complement of A, denoted by C(A),
as the set S −A.
Theorem 6.5
(a) The union of any family F of open sets in a metric space is open.
(b) Let A1,A2, . . . ,An be a ﬁnite family of open sets. Then the intersection
n
i1 Ai is open.
Proof
(a) Suppose that p ∈
A∈F A. Then p is in at least one set A in F. Since
A is open, there is an open ball with center at p and radius r, denoted
by B(p, r), that is entirely in A. Hence B(p, r) ⊂
A∈F A. We have just

6.2.
Topology in Metric Spaces
111
shown that any point of 
A∈F A is the center of an open ball that is also
in 
A∈F A. Thus the union of any family of open sets is open.
(b) Suppose that p ∈n
i1 Ai. Then for each i there is an open ball B(p, ri)
that is entirely in Ai. Deﬁne ¯r  min(r1, r2, . . . , rn). The open ball B(p, ¯r)
is in every Ai and hence is in n
i1 Ai. Thus the set n
i1 Ai is open.
Remark
The result of Part (b) of Theorem 6.5 is false if the word ﬁnite is dropped from
the hypothesis. To see this, consider R2 with the Euclidean metric and deﬁne
the inﬁnite family of open sets Ak, k  1,2, . . . , by the formula
Ak  {(x, y) : 0 ≤x2 + y2 < 1
k }.
Each Ak is an open ball (and therefore an open set), but the intersection
∞
k1 Ak of this family consists of the single point (0,0), clearly not an open
set.
Theorem 6.6
(a) Let A be any set in a metric space S. Then A is closed ⇔C(A) is open.
(b) The space S is both open and closed.
(c) The null set is both open and closed.
Proof
We ﬁrst assume that A is closed and prove that C(A) is open. Let p ∈C(A)
and suppose that there is no open ball about p lying entirely in C(A). We
shall reach a contradiction. If there is no such ball, then every ball about
p contains points of A (necessarily different from p, since p ∈C(A)). This
fact asserts that p is a limit point of A. But since A is assumed closed, we
conclude that p is in A, which contradicts the fact that p ∈C(A). Thus
there is an open ball about p in C(A), and so C(A) is open.
The proof that A is closed if C(A) is open is similar.
Part (b) is a direct consequence of the deﬁnitions of open and closed
sets. Part (c) follows immediately from parts (a) and (b), since the null
set is the complement of S.
Theorem 6.7
(a) The intersection of any family F of closed sets is closed.
(b) Let A1,A2, . . . ,An be a ﬁnite family of closed sets. Then the union n
i1 Ai
is closed.
The proof of Theorem 6.7 is an immediate consequence of the
deﬁnition of a closed set and the deﬁnition of the intersection of sets.
It is important to observe that Part (b) of Theorem 6.7 is false if the
word ﬁnite is dropped from the hypothesis. It is not difﬁcult to construct

112
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
an inﬁnite family of closed sets such that the union of the family is not a
closed set.
Deﬁnition
Let {pn} be an inﬁnite sequence of points. An inﬁnite sequence of points
{qn} is called a subsequence of {pn} if there is an increasing sequence of
positive integers k1, k2, . . . , kn, . . . such that for every n,
qn  pkn.
To illustrate subsequences, observe that the sequence
p1, p2, . . . , pn, . . .
has subsequences such as
p1, p3, p5, . . . ,
p5, p10, p15, . . . ,
p1, p4, p7, . . . .
It is clear that the subscripts {kn} of a subsequence have the property that
kn ≥n for every n. This fact may be proved by induction.
Theorem 6.8
Suppose that {pn} is an inﬁnite sequence in a metric space S, and that {qn} is
a subsequence. If pn →p0 as n →∞, then qn →p0 as n →∞.
(Every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit.)
Proof
Let ε > 0 be given. From the deﬁnition of convergence, there is a positive
integer N such that d(pn, p0) < ε for all n > N. However, for each n, we
have qn  pkn with kn ≥n. Thus
d(qn, p0)  d(pkn, p0) < ε
for all n > N.
Therefore qn →p0 as n →∞.
Deﬁnitions
A point P is an interior point of a set A in a metric space if there is an
r > 0 such that B(p, r) is contained in A. The interior of a set A, denoted
A(0), is the set of all interior points of A. For any set A, the derived set
of A, denoted A′ is the collection of limit points of A. The closure of A,
denoted ¯A, is deﬁned by ¯A  A ∪A′. The boundary of a set A, denoted
∂A, is deﬁned by ∂A  ¯A −A(0).
Example
Let A be the open ball in R2 (with the Euclidean metric) given by A 
{(x, y) : 0 ≤x2 + y2 < 1}. Then every point of A is an interior point, so

6.2.
Topology in Metric Spaces
113
that A  A(0). More generally, the property that characterizes any open
set is the fact that every point is an interior point. The boundary of A is
the circle ∂A  {(x, y) : x2 + y2  1}. The closure of A is the closed ball
¯A  {(x, y) : 0 ≤x2 + y2 ≤1}. We also see that A′, the derived set of A,
is identical with ¯A.

6.3
Countable and Uncountable Sets
If A and B are sets with a ﬁnite number of elements, we can easily com-
pare their sizes by pairing the elements of A with those of B. If after we
complete the pairing process there remain unpaired members of one of
the sets, say of A, then A is said to be larger than B. The same situation
holds for sets with inﬁnitely many elements. While many pairs of inﬁnite
sets can be matched in a one-to-one way, it is a remarkable fact that there
are inﬁnite sets that cannot be paired with each other. The problem of
the relative sizes of sets with inﬁnitely many members has been studied
extensively, and in this section we shall describe only the basic proper-
ties of the sizes of ﬁnite and inﬁnite sets. These properties and the more
sophisticated developments of the theory of inﬁnite sets turn out to be
useful tools in the development of analysis. The theorems we consider
below pertain to sets in RN.
Deﬁnitions
A set S is denumerable if S can be put into one-to-one correspondence
with the positive integers. A set S is countable if S is either ﬁnite or
denumerable.

6.3.
Countable and Uncountable Sets
115
Theorem 6.9
(a) Any nonempty subset of the natural numbers is countable.
(b) Any subset of a countable set is countable.
Proof
To establish Part (a), let S be the given nonempty subset. Since S is a subset
of the positive integers, it must have a smallest element. We denote it by
k1. If S  {k1}, then S has exactly one element. If the set S −{k1} is not
empty, it has a smallest element, which we denote by k2. We continue the
process. If for some integer n, the set S −{k1, k2, . . . , kn} is empty, then
S is ﬁnite and we are done. Otherwise, the sequence k1, k2, . . . , kn, . . .
is inﬁnite. We shall show that S  {k1, k2, . . . , kn, . . .}. Suppose, on the
contrary, that there is an element of S not among the kn. Then there is
a smallest such element, which we denote by p. Now, k1 is the smallest
element of S, and so k1 ≤p. Let T be those elements of k1, k2, . . . , kn, . . .
with the property that ki ≤p. Then T is a ﬁnite set, and there is an
integer i such that ki ≤p < ki+1 for some i. Since p is not equal to any
of the kj, it follows that ki < p < ki+1. By construction, the element
ki+1 is the smallest element of S that is larger than k1, k2, . . . , kj. Since p
is in S, we have a contradiction of the inequality ki < p < ki+1. Thus
S  {k1, k2, . . . , kn, . . .}.
Part (b) is a direct consequence of part (a).
Theorem 6.10
The union of a countable family of countable sets is countable.
Proof
Let S1, S2, . . . , Sm, . . . be a countable family of countable sets. For each
ﬁxed m, the set Sm can be put into one-to-one correspondence with some
or all of the pairs (m, 1), (m, 2), . . . , (m, n), . . .. Hence the union S can be
put into one-to-one correspondence with a subset of the totality of ordered
pairs (m, n) with m, n  1, 2, . . .. However, the totality of ordered pairs
can be arranged in a single sequence. We ﬁrst write the ordered pairs as
shown in Figure 6.4.
(1, 1)
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
. . .
(2, 1)
(2, 2)

(4, 1)
(4, 2)
(4, 3)
(4, 4)
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
Then we write the terms in diagonal order as follows:
(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1), . . . .

116
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
This sequence is in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers.
The reader may verify that the ordered pair (p, q) in the above ordering
corresponds to the natural number r given by
r  (p + q −1)(p + q −2)
2
+ q.
Figure 6.4
Theorem 6.10 shows that the set of all integers (positive, negative, and
zero) is denumerable. Since the rational numbers can be put into one-to-
one correspondence with a subset of ordered pairs (p, q) of integers (p is
the numerator, q the denominator), we see that the rational numbers are
denumerable.
The next theorem shows that the set of all real numbers is essentially
larger than the set of all rational numbers. Any attempt to establish a
one-to-one correspondence between these two sets must fail.
Theorem 6.11
R1 is not countable.
Proof
It is sufﬁcient to show that the interval I  {x : 0 < x < 1} is not
countable. Suppose I is countable. Then we may arrange the members of
I in a sequence x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .. We shall show there is a number x ∈I
not in this sequence, thus contradicting the fact that I is countable. Each
xi has a unique proper decimal development, as shown in Figure 6.5. Each
dij is a digit between 0 and 9.
Figure 6.5 Decimal expansions of x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . ..

6.3.
Countable and Uncountable Sets
117
We now deﬁne a number x in I by the following decimal development:
(6.4)
x  0.a1a2a3 . . . .
Each digit ai is given by
ai 

4
if dii ̸ 4,
5
if dii  4.
Then expression (6.4) is a proper decimal expansion of the number x, and
it differs from xn in the nth place. Hence x ̸ xn for every n, and I is not
countable.
Deﬁnitions
An open cell is RN Is a set of the form
{(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : ai < xi < bi, i 1, 2, . . . , N}.
We suppose that ai < bi for every i. Note that an open cell is a straight-
forward generalization of an open interval in R1. Similarly, a closed cell
is a set of the form
{(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : ai ≤xi ≤bi, i 1, 2, . . . , N}.
Again, we assume that ai < bi for every i.
Theorem 6.12
An open set in R1 is the union of a countable family of disjoint open intervals.
Proof
Let G be the given open set and suppose x0 ∈G. Since G is open, there
is an open interval J that contains x0 and such that J ⊂G. Deﬁne I(x0) as
the union of all such open intervals J. Then I(x0) is open and contained
in G. Furthermore, since the union of a set of open intervals having a
common point is an open interval, I(x0) is an open interval. Let x1 and x2
be distinct points of G. We shall show that I(x1) and I(x2) are disjoint or that
I(x1) ≡I(x2). Suppose that I(x1)∩I(x2) is not empty. Then I(x1)∪I(x2) is an
interval in G that contains both x1 and x2. Hence I(x1) ∪I(x2) is contained
in both I(x1) and I(x2). Therefore, I(x1) ≡I(x2). Thus G is composed of the
union of disjoint open intervals of the type I(x0), and by Theorem 6.10
the union is countable.
Problems
1. Show that the totality of rational points in R2 (that is, points both
of whose coordinates are rational numbers) is denumerable.
2. Show that the totality of rational points in RN is denumerable.
3. Deﬁne the set S as follows: The element x is in S if x is an inﬁnite

6.4
Compact Sets and the Heine–Borel
Theorem
In Theorem 3.7 we established the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, which
states that any bounded inﬁnite sequence in R1 contains a convergent sub-
sequence. In this section we investigate the possibility of extending this
theorem to metric spaces. We shall give an example below which shows
that the theorem does not hold if the bounded sequence in R1 is replaced
by a bounded sequence in a metric space S. However, the important no-
tion of compactness, which we now deﬁne, leads to a modiﬁed extension
of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
Deﬁnition
A set A in a metric space S is compact if each sequence of points {pn} in
A contains a subsequence, say {qn}, that converges to a point p0 in A.
We see immediately from the deﬁnition of compactness and from the
Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem that every closed, bounded set in R1 is com-
pact. Also, it is important to notice that the subsequence {qn} not only
converges to p0 but that p0 is in A.
Deﬁnition
A set A in a metric space S is bounded if A is contained in some ball
B(p, r) with r > 0.
Theorem 6.13
A compact set A in a metric space S is bounded and closed.
Proof
Assume that A is compact and not bounded. We shall reach a contradic-
tion. Deﬁne the sequence {pn} as follows: Choose p1 ∈A. Since A is not
bounded, there is an element p2 in A such that d(p1, p2) > 1. Continuing,
for each n, there is an element pn in A with d(p1, pn) > n −1. Since A is

6.4.
Compact Sets and the Heine–Borel Theorem
119
compact, we can ﬁnd a subsequence {qn} of {pn} such that qn converges
to an element p0 ∈A. From the deﬁnition of convergence, there is an
integer N such that d(qn, p0) < 1 for all n ≥N. But
(6.5)
d(qn, p1) ≤d(qn, p0) + d(p0, p1) < 1 + d(p0, p1).
Since qn is actually at least the n th member of the sequence {pn}, it follows
that d(qn, p1) > n −1. For n sufﬁciently large, this inequality contradicts
inequality (6.5). Hence A is bounded.
Now assume that A is not closed. Then there is a limit point p0 of
A that is not in A. According to Theorem 6.4, there is a sequence {pn}
of elements in A such that pn →p0 as n →∞. But any subsequence
of a convergent sequence converges to the same element. Hence the
deﬁnition of compactness is contradicted unless p0 ∈A.
It is natural to ask whether or not the converse of Theorem 6.13 holds.
It is not difﬁcult to give an example of a sequence of bounded elements
in a metric space that has no convergent subsequence. Thus any set
containing such a sequence, even if it is bounded and closed, cannot
be compact.
For some metric spaces the property of being bounded and closed is
equivalent to compactness. The next theorem establishes this equiva-
lence for the spaces RN with a Euclidean or equivalent metric.
Theorem 6.14
A bounded, closed set in RN is compact.
Proof
Let A be bounded and closed. Then A lies in a cell
C  {(x1, x2, . . . , xN) : ai ≤xi ≤bi, i  1, 2, . . . , N}.
Let {pn} be any sequence in A. Writing pk  (p1
k, p2
k, . . . , pN
k ), we have
ai ≤pi
k ≤bi,
i  1, 2, . . . , N,
k  1, 2, . . . , n, . . .. Starting with
i  1, it is clear that {p1
k} is a bounded sequence of real numbers. By
the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, {p1
k} has a convergent subsequence.
Denote this convergent subsequence by {p1
k′}. Next let i  2 and consider
the subsequence {p2
k′} of {p2
k}. Since {p2
k′} is bounded, it has a convergent
subsequence, which we denote by {p2
k′′}. Observe that {p1
k′′} being a subse-
quence of the convergent sequence {p1
k′} is also convergent. Proceeding
to i  3, we choose a subsequence of {p3
k′′} that converges, and so on until
i  N. We ﬁnally obtain a subsequence of {pk}, which we denote by {qk},
such that every component of qk consists of a convergent subsequence of
real numbers. Since A is closed, qk converges to an element c of RN with
c in A. The set A is compact.

120
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
Deﬁnition
A sequence {pn} in a metric space S is a Cauchy sequence if for every
ε > 0 there is a positive integer N such that d(pn, pm) < ε whenever
n, m > N.
We know that a Cauchy sequence in R1 converges to a limit (Section
3.6). It is easy to see that a Cauchy sequence {pn} in RN also converges to a
limit. Writing pn  (p1
n, p2
n, . . . , pN
n ), we observe that {pi
k}, k  1, 2, . . ., is a
Cauchy sequence of real numbers for each i  1, 2, . . . , N. Hence pi
k →
ci, i  1, 2, . . . , N, and the element c  (c1, c2, . . . , cN) is the limit of
the sequence {pk}. However, we cannot conclude that in a general metric
space a Cauchy sequence always converges to an element in the space.
In fact, the statement is false. To see this, consider the metric space (S, d)
consisting of all rational numbers with the metric d(a, b)  |a −b|. Since
a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers may converge to an irrational
number, it follows that a Cauchy sequence in S may not converge to a
limit in S.
Let H be a set in a space S and suppose that F is a family of sets in
S. The family F covers H if every point of H is a point in at least one
member of F. Coverings of compact sets by a ﬁnite number of open balls
have a natural extension to coverings by any family of open sets. The
next theorem, an important and useful one in analysis, gives one form of
this result. It is a direct extension of Theorem 3.12.
Theorem 6.15 (Heine–Borel theorem)
Let A be a compact set in a metric space S. Suppose that F  {Gα} is a family
of open sets that covers A. Then a ﬁnite subfamily of F covers A.
Proof
Suppose no such subfamily exists. We shall reach a contradiction. Since
A is compact, there is a ﬁnite number of balls, say of radius
1
2 , that
cover A. Suppose the centers of these balls are the points p11, p12, . . . , p1k1
in A, and the balls are denoted by B(p1i, 1
2 ), i  1, 2, . . . , k1. We have
k1
i1 B(p1i, 1
2 ) ⊃A. Then one of the sets
A ∩B(p11, 1
2 ),
A ∩B(p12, 1
2 ),
. . . ,
A ∩B(p1k1, 1
2 ),
is such that an inﬁnite number of open sets of F are required to cover it.
(Otherwise, the theorem would be proved.) Call this set A ∩B(p1, 1
2 ) and
observe that it is a compact subset of A. Now we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite number
of balls B(p2i, 1
4 ), i  1, 2, . . . , k2, such that
A ∩B(p1, 1
2 ) ⊂
k2
'
i1
B(p2i, 1
4 ).

6.4.
Compact Sets and the Heine–Borel Theorem
121
One of the balls B(p21, 1
4 ), . . . , B(p2k2, 1
4 ) is such that an inﬁnite number
of open sets of F are required to cover the portion of A contained in that
ball. Denote that ball by B(p2, 1
4 ). Continuing in this way we obtain a
sequence of closed balls
B(p1, 1
2 ), B(p2, 1
4 ), . . . , B(pn,
1
2n ), . . .
such that pn ∈A ∩B(pn−1, 1/2n−1), and an inﬁnite number of open sets
of F are required to cover A ∩B(pn, 1/2n). Since d(pn−1, pn) ≤1/2n−1 for
each n, the sequence {pn} is a Cauchy sequence and hence converges to
some element p0. Now, since A is compact, we have p0 ∈A. Therefore,
p0 lies in some open set G0 of F. Since pn →p0, there is a sufﬁciently
large value of n such that B(pn, 1/2n) ⊂G0. However, this contradicts
the fact that an inﬁnite number of members of F are required to cover
B(pn, 1/2n) ∩A.
Remarks
The compactness of A is essential in establishing the Heine–Borel theo-
rem. It is not enough to assume, for example, that A is bounded. A simple
example is given by the set in R1 deﬁned by A  {x : 0 < x < 1}.
We cover A with the family F of open intervals deﬁned by Ia  {x :
a/2 < x < 1} for each a ∈A. It is not difﬁcult to verify that no ﬁnite
subcollection of {Ia} can cover A.

Functions on Compact Sets
In Chapter 3, we discussed the elementary properties of functions de-
ﬁned on R1 with range in R1. We were also concerned with functions
whose domain consisted of a part of R1, usually an interval. In this sec-
tion we develop properties of functions with domain all or part of an
arbitrary metric space S and with range in R1. That is, we consider real-
valued functions. We ﬁrst take up the fundamental notions of limits and
continuity.
Deﬁnition
Suppose that f is a function with domain A, a subset of a metric space S,
and with range in R1; we write f : A →R1. We say that f(p) tends to l
as p tends to p0 through points of A if (i) p0 is a limit point of A, and
(ii) for each ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
|f(p) −l| < ε for all p in A
with the property that 0 < d(p, p0) < δ. We write
f(p) →l as p →p0,
p ∈A.

6.5.
Functions on Compact Sets
123
We shall also use the notation
lim
p→p0
p∈A
f(p)  l.
Observe that the above deﬁnition does not require f(p0) to be deﬁned,
nor does p0 have to belong to the set A. However, when both of these
conditions hold, we are able to deﬁne continuity for real-valued functions.
Deﬁnitions
Let A be a subset of a metric space S, and suppose f : A →R1 is given.
Let p0 ∈A. We say that f is continuous with respect to A at p0 if (i)
f(p0) is deﬁned, and (ii) either p0 is an isolated point of A or p0 is a limit
point of A and
f(p) →f(p0) as p →p0,
p ∈A.
We say that f is continuous on A if f is continuous with respect to A at
every point of A.
If the domain of f is the entire metric space S, then we say that f is
continuous at p0, omitting the phrase “with respect to A.” The deﬁnitions
of limit and continuity for functions with domain in one metric space S1
and range in another metric space S2 are extensions of those given above.
The basic properties of functions deﬁned on R1 discussed in Chapter
3 do not always have direct analogues for functions deﬁned on a subset
of a metric space. For example, the Intermediate-value theorem (Theo-
rem 3.3) for functions deﬁned on an interval of R1 does not carry over to
real-valued functions deﬁned on all or part of a metric space. However,
when the domain of a real-valued function is a compact subset of a met-
ric space, many of the theorems of Chapter 3 have natural extensions.
For example, the following theorem is the analogue of the boundedness
theorem (Theorem 3.8).
Theorem 6.16
Let A be a compact subset of a metric space S. Suppose that f :A →R1 is
continuous on A. Then the range of f is bounded.
Proof
We assume that the range is unbounded and reach a contradiction.
Suppose that for each positive integer n, there is a pn ∈A such that
|f(pn)| > n. Since A is compact, the sequence {pn} ⊂A must have a
convergent subsequence, say {qn}, and qn →¯p with ¯p ∈A. Since f is
continuous on A, we have f(qn) →f(¯p) as n →∞. Choosing ε  1 in the
deﬁnition of continuity on A and observing that d(qn, ¯p) →0 as n →∞,
we can state that there is an N1 such that for n > N1, we have
|f(qn) −f(¯p)| < 1
whenever
n > N1.

124
6.
Elementary Theory of Metric Spaces
We choose N1 so large that |f(¯p)| < N1. Now for n > N1 we may write
|f(qn)|  |f(qn) −f(¯p) + f(¯p)| ≤|f(qn) −f(¯p)| + |f(¯p)| < 1 + |f(¯p)|.
Since qn is at least the nth member of the sequence {pn}, it follows that
|f(qn)| > n for each n. Therefore,
n < |f(qn)| < 1 + |f(¯p)| < 1 + N1,
a contradiction for n sufﬁciently large. Hence the range of f
is
bounded.
Note the similarity of the above proof to that of Theorem 3.8. Also,
observe the essential manner in which the compactness of A is employed.
The result clearly does not hold if A is not compact.
Problems
In the following problems a set A in a metric space S is given. All functions
are real-valued (range in R1) and have domain A.
1. If c is a number and f(p)  c for all p ∈A, then show that for any
limit point p0 of A, we have
lim
p→p0
p∈A
f(p)  c
(theorem on limit of a constant).
2. Suppose f and g are such that f(p)  g(p) for all p ∈A −{p0}, where
p0 is a limit point of A, and suppose that f(p) →l as p →p0, p ∈A.
Show that g(p) →l as p →p0, p ∈A (limit of equal functions).
3. Suppose that f1(p) →l1 as p →p0, p ∈A, and f2(p) →l2 as p →p0,
p ∈A. Show that f1(p) + f2(p) →l1 + l2 as p →p0, p ∈A.
4. Under the hypotheses of Problem 3, show that f1(p) · f2(p) →l1 · l2
as p →p0, p ∈A.
5. Assume that the hypotheses of Problem 3 hold and that l2 ̸ 0. Show
that f1(p)/f2(p) →l1/l2 as p →p0, p ∈A.
6. Suppose that f(p) ≤g(p) for all p ∈A, that f(p) →L as p →p0,
p ∈A, and that g(p) →M as p →p0, p ∈A. Show that L ≤M.
Show that the same result holds if we assume f(p) ≤g(p) in some
open ball containing p0.

Differentiation

in RN
7.1
Partial Derivatives and the Chain
Rule
There are two principal extensions to RN of the theory of differentiation
of real-valued functions on R1. In this section, we develop the natural
generalization of ordinary differentiation discussed in Chapter 4 to partial
differentation of functions from RN to R1. In Section 7.3, we extend the
ordinary derivative to the total derivative.
We shall use letters x, y, z, etc. to denote elements in RN. The compo-
nents of an element x are designated by (x1, x2, . . . , xN), and as usual, the
Euclidean distance, given by the formula
d(x, y) 

will be used. We also write d(x, y)  |x −y| and d(x, 0)  |x|.
Deﬁnition
Let f be a function with domain an open set in RN and range in R1. We
deﬁne the N functions f,i with i  1, 2, . . . , N by the formulas
f,i(x1, x2, . . . , xN)  lim

Differentiation and Integration in RN
whenever the limit exists. The functions f,1, f,2, . . . , f,N are called the ﬁrst
partial derivatives of f .
We assume that the reader is familiar with the elementary processes
of differentiation. The partial derivative with respect to the ith variable
is computed by holding all other variables constant and calculating the
ordinary derivative with respect to xi. That is, to compute f,i at the value
a  (a1, a2, . . . , aN), form the function ϕ (from R1 to R1) by setting
(7.1)
ϕ(xi)  f(a1, a2, . . . , ai−1, xi, ai+1, . . . , aN),
and observe that
(7.2)
f,i(a)  ϕ′(ai).
There are many notations for partial differentiation. In addition to the
one above, the most common ones are
Dif,
∂f
∂xi
,
fxi.
Good notation is important in studying partial derivatives, since the many
letters and subscripts that occur can lead to confusion. The two “best”
symbols, especially in discussing partial derivatives of higher order, are
f,i and Dif , and we shall employ these most of the time.
We recall that the equations of a line segment in RN connecting the
points a  (a1, . . . , aN) and a + h  (a1 + h1, . . . , aN + hN) are given
parametrically by the formulas (the parameter is t)
x1  a1 + th1,
x2  a2 + th2,
. . . ,
xN  aN + thN,
0 ≤t ≤1.
The next theorem is the extension to functions from RN to R1 of the
Mean-value theorem (Theorem 4.12).
Theorem 7.1 (Extended Mean-value theorem)
Let τi be the line segment in RN connecting the points (a1,a2, . . . ,ai, . . . ,aN)
and (a1,a2, . . . ,ai + hi, . . . ,aN). Suppose f is a function from RN into R1 with
domain containing τi, and suppose that the domain of f,i contains τi. Then
there is a real number ξi on the closed interval in R1 with endpoints ai and
ai + hi such that
(7.3)
f(a1, . . . , ai + hi, . . . , aN) −f(a1, . . . , ai, . . . , aN)  hif,i(a1, . . . , ξi, . . . , aN).
Proof
If hi  0, then equation (7.3) holds. If hi ̸ 0, we use the notation of
expression (7.1) to write the left side of equation (7.3) in the form
ϕ(ai + hi) −ϕ(ai).

7.1.
Partial Derivatives and the Chain Rule
127
For this function on R1, we apply the Mean-value theorem (Theorem
4.12) to conclude that
ϕ(ai + hi) −ϕ(ai)  hiϕ′(ξi).
This formula is a restatement of equation (7.3).
Theorem 4.8, the Fundamental lemma of differentiation, has the fol-
lowing generalization for functions from RN into R1. We state the theorem
in the general case and prove it for N  2.
Theorem 7.2 (Fundamental lemma of differentiation)
Suppose that the functions f and f,1,f,2, . . . ,f,N all have a domain in RN that
contains an open ball about the point a  (a1,a2, . . . ,aN). Suppose all the f,i
i  1,2, . . . ,N, are continuous at a. Then
(a) f is continuous at a;
(b) there are functions ϵ1(x), ϵ2(x), . . . ,ϵN(x), continuous at x  0, such
that ϵ1(0)  ϵ2(0)  . . .  ϵN(0)  0 and
(7.4)

[f,i(a) + ϵi(h)]hi
for h  (h1,h2, . . . ,hN) in some ball B(0,r) in RN of radius r and center at
h  0.
Proof
For N  2. We employ the identity
(7.5)
f(a1 + h1, a2 + h2) −f(a1, a2)  [f(a1 + h1, a2) −f(a1, a2)]
+ [f(a1 + h1, a2 + h2) −f(a1 + h1, a2)].
Since f, f,1, and f,2 are deﬁned in an open ball about a  (a1, a2), this
identity is valid for h1, h2 in a sufﬁciently small ball (of radius, say, r)
about h1  h2  0. Applying Theorem 7.1 to the right side of equation
(7.5), we ﬁnd that there are numbers ξ1(h1, h2), ξ2(h1, h2) on the closed
intervals from a1 to a1 + h1 and from a2 to a2 + h2, respectively, such that
(7.6)
f(a1 + h1, a2 + h2) −f(a1, a2)  f,1(ξ1, a2)h1 + f,2(a1 + h1, ξ2)h2.
Equation (7.6) is valid for h1, h2 in the ball of radius r about h1  h2  0.
Now deﬁne
(7.7)
ϵ1(h1, h2)  f,1(ξ1, a2) −f,1(a1, a2),
ϵ2(h1, h2)  f,2(a1 + h1, ξ2) −f,2(a1, a2).
We wish to show that ϵ1 and ϵ2 are continuous at (0, 0). Let ϵ > 0 be given.
Since f,1 and f,2 are continuous at (a1, a2), there is a δ > 0 such that
(7.8)
|f,1(x1, x2) −f,1(a1, a2)| < ϵ and |f,2(x1, x2) −f,2(a1, a2)| < ϵ,

128
Differentiation and Integration in RN
for (x1, x2) in a ball of radius δ with center at (a1, a2). Comparing expres-
sions (7.7) and (7.8), we see that if h1 and h2 are sufﬁciently small (so
that (ξ1, ξ2) is close to (a1, a2)), then
|ϵ1(h1, h2)| < ϵ and |ϵ2(h1, h2)| < ϵ.
Moreover, ϵ1(0, 0)  0 and ϵ2(0, 0)  0. Substituting the values of ϵ1
and ϵ2 from equations (7.7) into equation (7.6) we obtain part (b) of the
theorem. The continuity of f at (a1, a2) follows directly from Equation
(7.4).
The proof for N > 2 is similar.
The chain rule for ordinary differentiation (Theorem 4.9) can be
extended to provide a rule for taking partial derivatives of composite
functions. We establish the result for a function f : RN →R1 when
it is composed with N functions g1, g2, . . . , gN each of which is a map-
ping from RM into R1. The integer M may be different from N. If
y  (y1, y2, . . . , yN) and x  (x1, x2, . . . , xM) are elements of RN and
RM, respectively, then in customary terms, we wish to calculate the
derivative of H(x) (a function from RM into R1) with respect to xj, where
f  f(y1, y2, . . . , yN) and
(7.9)
H(x)  f [g1(x), g2(x), . . . , gN(x)].
Theorem 7.3 (Chain rule)
Suppose that each of the functions g1,g2, . . . ,gN is a mapping from RM into R1.
For a ﬁxed integer j between 1 and M, assume that g1
,j,g2
,j, . . . ,gN
,j are deﬁned
at some point b  (b1,b2, . . . ,bM). Suppose that f and its partial derivatives
f,1, f,2, . . . , f,N
are continuous at the point a  (g1(b),g2(b), . . . ,gN(b)). Form the function
H as in equation (7.9). Then the partial derivative of H with respect to xj is
given by

i  1, 2, . . . , N.
Then, according to equation (7.9), we have

Since each ψi is continuous at bj, it follows that 4ψi →0 as h →0. We

Let f be a function from RN into R1. We deﬁne the second partial deriva-
tive f,i,j as the ﬁrst partial derivative of f,i with respect to xj. We deﬁne the
third partial derivative f,i,j,k as the ﬁrst partial derivative of f,i,j. Fourth,
ﬁfth, and higher derivatives are deﬁned similarly.
In computing second partial derivatives it is natural to ask whether
the order of computation affects the result. That is, is it always true that
f,i,j  f,j,i for i ̸ j? There are simple examples that show that the order of
computation may lead to different results. (See Problem 3 at the end of
this section.) The next theorem, stated without proof, gives a sufﬁcient
condition that validates the interchange of order of partial differentiation.

Let x  (x1, x2, . . . , xN) be any element of RN. Then the monomial xα is
deﬁned by the formula
xα  xα1
1 xα2
2 · · · xαN

Clearly, the degree of xα is |α|. Any polynomial in RN is a function f of
the form

in which α is a multi-index, the cα are constants, and the sum is taken
over all multi-indices with order less than or equal to n, the degree of the
polynomial.

The Multinomial theorem, an extension to several variables of the bino-
mial theorem, is essential for the development of the Taylor expansion for
functions of several variables. We state the result without proof, although
the formula is not difﬁcult to establish by induction. (Fix the integer n
and use induction on N.)

Let G be an open set in RN and let f : G →R1 be a function with
continuous second derivatives in G. We know that in the computation
of second derivatives the order of differentiation may be interchanged.
That is, f,i,j  f,j,i for all i and j. We may also write f,i,j  Dj[Dif ]. With any

Differentiation and Integration in RN
If α is the multi-index (α1, α2, . . . , αN), then Dα is the operator given by
Dα  Dα1
1 Dα2
2 · · · DαN
N . That is, Dαf means that f is ﬁrst differentiated with
respect to xN exactly αN times; then it is differentiated αN−1 times with
respect to xN−1, and so on until all differentiations of f are completed.
The order of the operator (7.13) is the degree of the polynomial (7.12).
By induction it is easy to see that every operator consisting of a linear
combination of maps is of the form (7.13). The differentiations may be
performed in any order. The polynomial P(ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξN) in (7.12) is called
the auxiliary polynomial of the operator (7.13).
Deﬁnitions
Let f : RN →R1 be a given function, and suppose that a ∈RN and
b ∈RN with |b|  1. The directional derivative of f in the direction
b at the point a, denoted by dbf(a), is the number deﬁned by
(7.14)
dbf(a)  lim
t→0
f(a + tb) −f(a)
t
.
Note that the difference quotient in the deﬁnition is taken by subtract-
ing f(a) from the value of f taken on the line segment in RN joining a and
a + b. The second directional derivative of f in the direction b at
the point a is simply db[dbf ](a), and it is denoted by (db)2f(a). The nth
directional derivative, (db)nf(a), is deﬁned similarly.
Lemma 7.3

order n are continuous in a ball B(a,r). Then

Proof
For n  1, we set φ(t)  f(a + tb). Then dbf(a)  φ′(0). We use the Chain
rule to compute φ′, and denoting b  (b1, b2, . . . , bN), we ﬁnd
dbf(a)  b1D1f(a) + . . . + bNDNf(a).
That is, db  b1D1 + . . . + bNDN. By induction, we obtain
(dn

Using the Multinomial theorem (Lemma 7.2), we get equation (7.15).

Theorem 7.4 (Taylor’s theorem for functions from R1 to R1)
Suppose that f :R1 to R1 and all derivatives of f up to and including order n +1

The proof of Theorem 7.4 makes use of Rolle’s theorem (Theorem 4.11)
and is deferred until Chapter 8. See Theorem 8.24. Observe that for n  0,
formula (7.16) is the Mean-value theorem. (See Problem 6 at the end of
this section and the hint given there.) The last term in (7.16) is called the
remainder.
We now use Theorem 7.4 to establish Taylor’s theorem for functions
from a domain in RN to R1.
Theorem 7.5 (Taylor’s theorem with remainder)
Suppose that f :RN →R1 and all its partial derivatives up to and including
order n + 1 are continuous on a ball B(a,r). Then for each x in B(a,r), there
is a point ξ on the straight line segment from a to x such that

that φ has continuous derivatives up to and including order n + 1, since

(7.17).
The last terms in formula (7.17) are known as the remainder.
For functions from R1 into R1 the second derivative test is one of the
most useful for identifying the maximum and minimum points on the
graph of the function. We recall that a function f with two derivatives and
with f ′(a)  0 has a relative maximum at a if its second derivative at a
is negative. It has a relative minimum at a if f ′′(a) > 0. If f ′′(a)  0, the
test fails. With the aid of Taylor’s theorem for functions from RN into R1
we can establish the corresponding result for functions of N variables.
Deﬁnitions
Let f : RN →R1 be given. The function f has a local maximum at the
value a if there is a ball B(a, r) such that f(x) −f(a) ≤0 for x ∈B(a, r).
The function f has a strict local maximum at a if f(x) −f(a) < 0 for
x ∈B(a, r) except for x  a. The corresponding deﬁnitions for local
minimum and strict local minimum reverse the inequality sign. If f
has partial derivatives at a, we say that f has a critical point at the value
a if Dif(a)  0, i  1, 2, . . . , N.
Theorem 7.6 (Second derivative test)
Suppose that f :RN →R1 and its partial derivatives up to and including order
2 are continuous in a ball B(a,r). Suppose that f has a critical point at a. For
h  (h1,h2, . . . ,hN), deﬁne 4f (a,h)  f (a + h) −f (a); also deﬁne

(c) If Q (h) has a positive maximum and a negative minimum, then 4f (a,h)
changes sign in any ball B(a,ρ) such that ρ < r.

we ﬁnd from equation (7.22) that

The expression Q1(h) is continuous for h on the unit sphere in RN. Accord-
ing to the hypothesis in part (a), Q1, a continuous function, must have a
positive minimum on the unit sphere, which is a closed set. Denote this
minimum by m. Hence,
Q(h) ≥|h|2m for all h.
Now choose |h| so small that |ϵ(h)| < m/2. Inserting the inequalities for
Q(h) and |ϵ(h)| into equation (7.23), we ﬁnd
4f(a, h) > 1

for |h| sufﬁciently small and h ̸ 0. We conclude that f has a strict local
minimum at a.

The Derivative in RN
Each partial derivative of a function f : RN →R1 is a mapping from RN
into R1. This generalization of the ordinary derivative, useful for many

The Derivative in RN

purposes, singles out a particular direction in which the differentiation is
performed. We now take up another extension of the ordinary derivative,
one in which the difference quotient tends to a limit as x →a regardless
of the direction of approach.
Let A be an open subset of RN, and suppose that f and g are functions
from A into R1. We denote by d(x, y) the Euclidean distance between two
points x, y in RN.
Deﬁnition
The continuous functions f and g are tangent at a point a ∈A if
lim
x→a
x̸a
|f(x) −g(x)|
d(x, a)
 0.
We note that if two functions are tangent at a point a, then necessarily
f(a)  g(a). Also, if f , g, and h are functions with f and g tangent at a and
with g and h tangent at a, then we verify simply that f and h are tangent
at a. To see this, observe that
|f(x) −h(x)|
d(x, a)
≤|f(x) −g(x)|
d(x, a)
+ |g(x) −h(x)|
d(x, a)
.
As x →a, the right side tends to 0, and so must the left side.

f is differentiable on a set A in RN if it is differentiable at each point of

We use the symbol f ′(a) for the derivative of f at the point a in RN.
Theorem 7.8
If f is differentiable at a point a, then f is continuous at a.
The proof is left to the reader. (Problem 5 at the end of this section.)
As we saw in Section 7.1, a function f may have partial derivatives
without being continuous. An example of such a function is given in
Problem 6 at the end of Section 7.1. Theorem 7.8 suggests that differen-
tiability is a stronger condition than the existence of partial derivatives.
The next theorem veriﬁes this point.
Theorem 7.9
If f is differentiable at a point a, then all ﬁrst partial derivatives of f exist at

Theorem 7.10
Suppose that f,i, i  1,2, . . . ,N, are continuous at a point a. Then f is

This result is most easily established by means of the Taylor expansion

The Darboux Integral in RN
The development of the theory of integration in RN for N ≥2 parallels
the one-dimensional case given in Section 5.1. For functions deﬁned on
an interval I in R1, we formed upper and lower sums by dividing I into a
number of subintervals. In RN we begin with a domain F, i.e., a bounded
region that has volume, and in order to form upper and lower sums,
we divide F into a number of subdomains. These subdomains are the

142
Differentiation and Integration in RN
generalizations of the subintervals in R1, and the limits of the upper and
lower sums as the number of subdomains tends to inﬁnity yield upper
and lower integrals. The subdomains can be thought of as hypercubes in
RN with the volume of each hypercube just N times the length of a side.
Deﬁnition
Let F be a bounded set in RN that is a domain. A subdivision of F is a
ﬁnite collection of domains {F1, F2, . . . , Fn} no two of which have common
interior points and the union of which is F. That is,
F  F1 ∪F2 ∪. . . ∪Fn,
Int(Fi) ∩Int(Fj)  ∅for i ̸ j.
We denote such a subdivision by the single letter 4.
Let D be a set in RN containing F and suppose that f : D →R1 is a
bounded function on F. Let 4 be a subdivision of F and set
Mi  sup f on Fi,
mi  inf f on Fi.
Deﬁnitions
The upper sum of f with respect to the subdivision 4 is deﬁned by the
formula
S+(f, 4) 
n

i1
MiV(Fi),
where V(Fi) is the volume in RN of the domain Fi. Similarly, the lower
sum of f is deﬁned by
S−(f, 4) 
n

i1
miV(Fi).
Let 4 be a subdivision of a domain F. Then 4′, another subdivision of
F, is called a reﬁnement of 4 if every domain of 4′ is entirely contained
in one of the domains of 4. Suppose that 41  {F1, F2, . . . , Fn} and 42 
{G1, G2, . . . , Gm} are two subdivisions of F. We say that 4′, the subdivision
consisting of all nonempty domains of the form Fi ∩Gj, i  1, 2, . . . , n,
j  1, 2, . . . , m, is the common reﬁnement of 41 and 42. Note that 4′
is a reﬁnement of both 41 and 42.
Theorem 7.12
Let F be a domain in RN and suppose that f :F →R1 is bounded on F.
(a) If m ≤f (x) ≤M for all x ∈F and if 4 is any subdivision of F, then
mV(F) ≤S−(f, 4) ≤S+(f, 4) ≤MV(F).
(b) If 4′ is a reﬁnement of 4, then
S−(f, 4) ≤S−(f, 4′) and S+(f, 4′) ≤S+(f, 4).

The Darboux Integral in RN
143
(c) If 41 and 42 are any two subdivisions of F, then
S−(f, 41) ≤S+(f, 42).
Proof
(a) The proof of part (a) is identical to the proof of part (a) in Theorem
5.1, the same theorem for functions from R1 into R1.
(b) Let 4′  {F′
1, . . . , F′
m} be a reﬁnement of 4  {F1, F2, . . . , Fn}. We
denote by F′
1, F′
2, . . . , F′
k the domains of 4′ contained in F1. Then, using
the symbols
m1  inf f in F1 and m′
1  inf f in F′
1,
i  1, 2, . . . , k,
we have immediately m1 ≤m′
i, i  1, 2, . . . , k, since each F′
i is a subset
of F1.
Because V(F1)  V(F′
1) + . . . + V(F′
k), we have
(7.28)
m1V(F1) ≤m′
1(F′
1) + . . . + m′
kV(F′
k).
The same type of inequality as (7.28) holds for F2, F3, . . . , Fn. Summing
these inequalities, we get S−(F, 4) ≤S−(f, 4′). The proof that S+(f, 4′) ≤
S+(f, 4) is similar.
(c) If 41 and 42 are two subdivisions, let 4′ denote the common
reﬁnement. Then, from parts (a) and (b), it follows that
S−(f, 41) ≤S−(f, 4′) ≤S+(f, 4′) ≤S+(f, 42).
Deﬁnitions
Let F be a domain in RN and suppose that f : F →R1 is bounded on F.
The upper integral of f is deﬁned by

F
f dV  g.l.b. S+(f, 4),
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all subdivisions 4 of F. The
lower integral of f is

F
f dV  l.u.b. S−(f, 4),
where the least upper bound is taken over all possible subdivisions 4 of
F. If

F
f dV 

F
f dV,
then we say that f is Darboux integrable, or just integrable, on F, and
we designate the common value by

F
f dV.

144
Differentiation and Integration in RN
When we wish to emphasize that the integral is N-dimensional, we write

F
f dVN.
The following elementary results for integrals in RN are the direct
analogues of the corresponding theorems given in Chapter 5 for func-
tions from R1 into R1. The proofs are the same except for the necessary
alterations from intervals in R1 to domains in Rn.
Theorem 7.13
Let F be a domain in RN. Let f ,f1,f2 be functions from F into R1 that are
bounded.
(a) If m ≤f (x) ≤M for x ∈F, then

Theorem 7.14
Let F be a domain in RN and suppose that f :F →R1 is bounded.
(a) f is Darboux integrable on F if and only if for each ε > 0 there is a
subdivision 4 of F such that
S+(f, 4) −S−(f, 4) < ε.
(b) If f is uniformly continuous on F, then F is Darboux integrable on F.
(c) If f is Darboux integrable on F, then |f | is also.
(d) If f1,f2 are each Darboux integrable on F, then f1 · f2 is also.
(e) If f is Darboux integrable on F, and H is a domain contained in F, then
f is Darboux integrable on H.
The proof of Theorem 7.14 follows the lines of the analogous theorem
in R1.
For positive functions from an interval I in R1 to R1, the Darboux
integral gives a formula for ﬁnding the area under a curve. If F is a domain
in RN, N ≥2, and if f : F →R1 is a nonnegative function, then the

7.5
The Riemann Integral in RN
The method of extending the Riemann integral from R1 to RN is similar
to the extension of the Darboux integral described in Section 7.4.
Deﬁnitions
Let A be a set in a metric space S with metric d. We deﬁne the diameter
of A as the sup d(x, y), where the supremum is taken over all x, y in A.
The notation diam A is used for the diameter of A.
Suppose that F is a domain in RN and that 4  {F1, F2, . . . , Fn} is a
subdivision of F. The mesh of 4, denoted by ∥4∥, is the maximum of the
diameters of F1, F2, . . . , Fn.
Deﬁnition
Let f be a function from F, a domain in RN into R1. Then f is Riemann
integrable on F if there is a number L with the following property: For
each ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that if 4 is any subdivision of F with
∥4∥< δ, and xi ∈Fi, i  1, 2, . . . , n, then

146
Differentiation and Integration in RN
This inequality must hold no matter how the xi are chosen in the Fi. The
number L is called the Riemann integral of f over F, and we use the
notation

F
f dV
for this value.
We recall that in R1 the Darboux and Riemann integrals are the same.
The next two theorems state that the same result holds for integrals in
RN.
Theorem 7.15
Let F be a domain in RN and suppose that f :F →R1 is Riemann integrable
on F. Then f is Darboux integrable on F, and the two integrals are equal.
The converse of Theorem 7.15 is contained in the following result.
Theorem 7.16
Let F be a domain in RN and suppose that f :F →R1 is bounded on F. Then
(a) for each ε > 0 there is an ε > 0 such that
(7.29)
S+(f, 4) <

F
f dV + ε and S−(f, 4) >

F
f dV −ε
for every subdivision of mesh ∥4∥< δ;
(b) if f is Darboux integrable on F, then it is Riemann integrable on F, and
the integrals are equal.
Proof
Observe that (b) is an immediate consequence of (a), since each Riemann
sum is between S−(f, 4) and S+(f, 4). Hence, if

F f dV 

F f dV, this value
is also the value of the Riemann integral.
We shall prove only the ﬁrst inequality in (7.29), because the proof of
the second is similar.
Since f is bounded, there is a number M such that |f(x)| ≤M for all
x ∈F. Let ε > 0 be given. According to the deﬁnition of upper Darboux
integral, there is a subdivision 40  {F1, F2, . . . , Fm} such that
(7.30)
S+(f, 40) <

F
f dV + ε
2 .
Deﬁne F(0)
i
to be the set of interior points of Fi. It may happen that F(0)
i
is empty for some values of i. For each F(0)
i
that is not empty, we select a
closed domain Gi contained in F(0)
i
such that
V(Fi −Gi) <
ε
4Mm ,
i  1, 2, . . . , m.

The Riemann Integral in RN
147
It is not difﬁcult to verify that such closed domains G1, G2, . . . , Gm can
always be found. For example, each Gi may be chosen as the union of
closed hypercubes interior to Fi for a sufﬁciently small grid size.
Since each set Gi is closed and is contained in F(0)
i
, there is a positive
number δ such that every ball B(x, δ) with x in some Gi has the property
that B(x, δ) is contained in the corresponding set F(0)
i
. Let 4 be any sub-
division with mesh less than δ. We shall show that the ﬁrst inequality in
(7.29) holds for this subdivision.
We separate the domains of 4 into two classes: J1, J2, . . . , Jn are those
domains 41 of 4 containing points of some Gi; K1, K2, . . . , Kq are the
remaining domains of 4, denoted by 40.
Denote by 4′ the common reﬁnement of 41 and 40. Because of the
manner in which we chose 4, each Ji is contained entirely in some F(0)
k .
Therefore, J1, J2, . . . , Jn are domains in the reﬁnement 4′. The remain-
ing domains of 4′ are composed of the sets Ki ∩Fj, i  1, 2, . . . , q;
j  1, 2, . . . , m. We have the inequality

Theorem 7.16 leads to the following result (stated without proof) on

Inﬁnite Series

Tests for Convergence and
Divergence
It is customary to use expressions such as
(8.1)
u1 + u2 + · · · + un + · · ·
and
∞

n1
un
to represent inﬁnite series. The ui are called the terms of the series, and
the quantities
sn  u1 + u2 + · · · + un,
n  1, 2, . . . ,
are called the partial sums of the series. The symbols in (8.1) not only
deﬁne an inﬁnite series but also are used as an expression for the sum
of the series when it converges. To avoid this ambiguity we deﬁne an
inﬁnite series in terms of ordered pairs.
Deﬁnitions
An inﬁnite series is an ordered pair ({un}, {sn}) of inﬁnite sequences in
which sn  u1 + u2 + . . . + un for each n. The un are called the terms
of the series and the sn are called the partial sums. If there is a number
s such that sn →s as n →∞, we say that the series is convergent and
that the sum of the series is s. If the sn do not tend to a limit, we say that
the series is divergent.
150

8.1.
Tests for Convergence and Divergence
151
It is clear that an inﬁnite series is uniquely determined by the se-
quence {un} of its terms. There is almost never any confusion in using
the symbols in (8.1) for an inﬁnite series. While the deﬁnition in terms
of ordered pairs is satisfactory from the logical point of view, it does re-
quire a cumbersome notation. Rather than have unwieldy proofs that
may obscure their essential features, we shall use the standard notation
u1 + u2 + · · · + un + · · · and ∞
n1 un to denote inﬁnite series. The context
will always show whether the expression represents the series itself or
the sum of the terms.
Theorem 8.1
If the series ∞
n1 un converges, then un →0 as n →∞.
Proof
For all n > 1, we have un  sn −sn−1. If s denotes the sum of the series,
then sn →s and sn−1 →s as n →∞. Hence un →s −s  0 as
n →∞.
Let
u1 + u2 + · · · + un + · · ·
be a given series. Then a new series may be obtained by deleting a ﬁnite
number of terms. It is clear that the new series will be convergent if and only
if the original series is.
Theorem 8.2
Let ∞

Inﬁnite Series
A series of the form
a + ar + ar2 + . . . + arn + · · ·
is called a geometric series. The number r is the common ratio.
Theorem 8.3
A geometric series with a ̸ 0 converges if |r| < 1 and diverges if |r| ≥1. In
the convergent case, we have

We easily verify that for each positive integer n,
sn  a + ar + ar2 + . . . + arn−1 

arn
1 −r .
If |r| < 1, then rn →0 as n →∞. Hence sn →a/(1 −r). If |r| ≥1, then
un does not tend to zero. According to Theorem 8.1, the series cannot
converge.
Theorem 8.4 (Comparison test)
Suppose that un ≥0 for all n.
(a) If un ≤an for all n and ∞
n1 an converges, then ∞
n1 un converges
and ∞
n1 un ≤∞

(b) Let an ≥0 for all n. If ∞
n1 an diverges and un ≥an for all n, then
∞
n1 un diverges.
The proof is left to the reader. (See Problem 11 at the end of this section.)
Let f be continuous on [a, +∞). We deﬁne

when the limit on the right exists. The term improper integral is used
when the range of integration is inﬁnite. We say that the improper integral

Theorem 8.5 (Integral test)
Suppose that f is continuous, nonnegative, and nonincreasing on [1, + ∞).

If this integral converges, then F(X) is a nondecreasing function that tends

now established. If the integral diverges, then F(X) →+∞as X →∞.
Therefore, F(n) →+∞. Since F(n) ≤n−1

known as the p-series, converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤1.
The proof of the corollary is an immediate consequence of the integral
test with f(x)  1/xp. For 0 < p ≤1, the terms of the p-series tend to zero
as n →∞although the series diverges. This fact shows that the converse
of Theorem 8.1 is false. The hypothesis that un →0 as n →∞does not
imply the convergence of ∞

When all the terms of a series are nonnegative, the Comparison test (The-
orem 8.4) is a useful tool for testing the convergence or divergence of an
inﬁnite series. (See also the Limit comparison test in Problem 16 at the
end of Section 8.1.) Now we show that the same test may be used when
a series has both positive and negative terms.
Deﬁnition
A series ∞
n1 un that is such that ∞
n1 |un| converges is said to be
absolutely convergent. However, if ∞
n1 un converges and ∞
n1 |un|
diverges, then the series ∞
n1 un is said to be conditionally convergent.
The next theorem shows that if a series is absolutely convergent, then
the series itself converges.
Theorem 8.6

n1 |un| converges, then ∞
n1 un converges and

Both ∞

Inﬁnite Series
A series may be conditionally convergent and not absolutely con-
vergent. The next theorem shows that ∞
n1(−1)n(1/n) is convergent.
However, the series ∞
n1 1/n, a p-series with p  1, is divergent; hence
∞
n1(−1)n(1/n) is a conditionally convergent series.
Theorem 8.7 (Alternating series theorem)
Suppose that the numbers un, n  1,2, . . ., satisfy the following conditions:
(i) The un are alternately positive and negative.
(ii) |un+1| < |un| for every n.
(iii) limn→∞un  0.
Then ∞
n1 un is convergent. Furthermore, if the sum is denoted by s, then
s lies between the partial sums sn and sn+1 for each n.
Proof
Assume that u1 is positive. If not, consider the series beginning with u2,
since discarding one term does not affect convergence. With u1 > 0, we
have, clearly,
u2n−1 > 0 and u2n < 0 for all n.
We now write
s2n  (u1 + u2) + (u3 + u4) + . . . + (u2n−1 + u2n).
Since by (ii) above |u2k| < u2k−1 for each k, each term in parentheses is
positive, and so s2n increases with n. Also,
s2n  u1 + (u2 + u3) + (u4 + u5) + . . . + (u2n−2 + u2n−1) + u2n.
The terms in parentheses are negative, and u2n < 0. Therefore, s2n <
u1 for all n. Hence s2n is a bounded, increasing sequence and therefore
convergent to a number, say s; also, s2n ≤s for each n. By observing that
s2n−1  s2n −u2n, we have s2n−1 > s2n for all n. In particular, s2n−1 > s2 
u1 + u2, and so s2n−1 is bounded from below. Also,
s2n+1  s2n−1 + (u2n + u2n+1) < s2n−1.
Therefore, s2n+1 is a decreasing sequence that tends to a limit. Since u2n →
0 as n →∞, we see that s2n and s2n+1 tend to the same limit s. Because
s2n−1 is decreasing, it follows that s2n−1 ≥s for every n. Thus s ≤sp for
odd p and s ≥sp for even p.
The least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a set were discussed
in Chapter 3. Now we introduce a related concept, one that is useful in the
study of inﬁnite series. Let a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, . . . be a bounded sequence
of real numbers. A number M is called the limit superior of the sequence
{an} and denoted by lim supn→∞an if the following two conditions hold:
(a). There is a subsequence of {an} that converges to M.

8.2.
Series of Positive and Negative Terms; Power Series
157
(b). For every ε > 0 there are at most a ﬁnite number of an such that
an ≥M + ε.
The limit inferior of {an}, denoted by lim inf n→∞an, is equal to a
number m if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a′) There is a subsequence of {an} that converges to m.
(b′) For every ε > 0 there are at most a ﬁnite number of terms of the
sequence such that an ≤m −ε.
We use the notations
M  lim sup
n→∞
an, or M  lim
n→∞an;
m  lim inf
n→∞
an, or m  lim
n→∞
an.
Examples
(1) Let an  1 + (−1)n
n
, n  1, 2, . . .. It is clear that an →1 as n →∞, and
so M  m  1. On the other hand, we note that the least upper bound of
{an} is 3
2 and the greatest lower bound is 0.
(2) The sequence an  (−1)n, n  1, 2, . . ., has the values M  1, m 
−1. The l.u.b. is 1 and the g.l.b. is −1.
In the above development we assumed that M and m are real numbers.
It is a minor modiﬁcation to add the cases where M or m are either +∞
or −∞; we leave the details to the reader.
The next test is one of the most useful for deciding absolute
convergence of series.
Theorem 8.8 (Ratio test)
Suppose that un ̸ 0, n  1,2, . . ., and that

Then
(i) if ρ < 1, the series ∞
n1 un converges absolutely;
(ii) if ρ > 1 or |un+1/un| →+∞as n →∞, the series diverges;
(iii) if ρ  1, the test gives no information.
Proof
(i) Suppose that ρ < 1. Choose any ρ′ such that ρ < ρ′ < 1. Then there
exists an integer N such that |un+1/un| < ρ′ for all n ≥N. That is,
|un+1| < ρ′|un| for n ≥N.
By induction, we have
|un| ≤(ρ′)n−N|uN| for all n ≥N.

158
8.
Inﬁnite Series
The series ∞
nN |un| converges by the Comparison test, using the geo-
metric series ∞
n0(ρ′)n. The original series converges absolutely, since
the addition of the ﬁnite sum N−1
n1 |un| does not affect convergence.
(ii) If ρ > 1 or |un+1/un| →+∞, then there is an integer N such that
|un+1/un| > 1 for all n ≥N. Then |un| > |uN| for all n ≥N. Hence un
does not approach zero as n →∞. By Theorem 8.1 the series cannot
converge.
(iii) The p-series for all values of p yields the limit ρ  1. Since the p-
series converges for p > 1 and diverges for p ≤1, the ratio test can yield
no information on convergence when ρ  1.
The next theorem provides a useful test for many series.
Theorem 8.9 (Root test)
Let ∞
n1 un be a series with either
lim
n→∞(|un|)1/n  ρ or lim
n→∞(|un|)1/n  +∞.
Then
(i) if ρ < 1, the series ∞
n1 un converges absolutely;
(ii) if ρ > 1 or if limn→∞|un|1/n →+∞, the series diverges;
(iii) if ρ  1, the test gives no information.
Proof
(i) Suppose ρ < 1. Choose ε > 0 so small that ρ + ε < 1 as well. It follows
that |un|1/n < ρ + ε for all n ≥N if N is sufﬁciently large. Therefore,
|un| < (ρ + ε)n for all n ≥N. We observe that
∞

n1
(ρ + ε)n
is a convergent geometric series, since ρ + ε < 1. The Comparison test
(Theorem 8.4) shows that ∞
n1 |un| converges. Hence (i) is established.
(ii) Suppose ρ > 1 or |un|1/n →+∞. Choose ε > 0 so small that
(ρ −ε) > 1. Therefore, in case (ii), ρ −ε < |un|1/n for all sufﬁciently
large n. We conclude that
lim
n→∞|un| ̸ 0;
and hence both ∞
n1 |un| and ∞
n1 un are divergent series.
A power series is a series of the form
c0 + c1(x −a) + c2(x −a)2 + . . . + cn(x −a)n + · · · ,

It will be established that most of the elementary functions such as the
trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions have power series
expansions. In fact, power series may be used for the deﬁnition of many
of the functions studied thus far. For example, the function log x may be
deﬁned by a power series rather than by an integral as in Section 5.3. If a
power series deﬁnition is used, the various properties of functions, such
as those given in Theorems 5.12 and 5.13 are usually more difﬁcult to
establish.
We ﬁrst state a lemma and then prove two theorems that establish the
basic properties of power series.
Lemma 8.1
If the series ∞
n1 un converges, then there is a number M such that |un| ≤M
for all n.
The proof is left to the reader. (See Problem 24 at the end of the section
and the hint given there.)
Theorem 8.10
If the series ∞
n0 cn(x −a)n converges for x  x1 where x1 ̸ a, then the
series converges absolutely for all x such that |x −a| < |x1 −a|. Furthermore,
there is a number M such that
(8.3) |cn(x −a)n| ≤M
 |x −a|
|x1 −a|
n
for |x −a| ≤|x1 −a| and for all n.
Proof
By Lemma 8.1 there is a number M such that
|cn(x1 −a)n| ≤M for all n.
Then (8.3) follows, since
|cn(x −a)n|  |cn(x1 −a)n| ·

(x −a)n
(x1 −a)n
 ≤M |x −a|n
|x1 −a|n .
We deduce the convergence of the series at |x −a| by comparison with the
geometric series the terms of which are the right side of the inequality
in (8.3).

160
8.
Inﬁnite Series
Theorem 8.11
Let ∞
n0 cn(x −a)n be a given power series. Then
(i) the series converges only for x  a; or
(ii) the series converges for all values of x; or
(iii) there is a number R such that the series converges for |x −a| < R and
diverges for |x −a| > R.
Proof
There are simple examples of series that show that (i) and (ii) may hap-
pen. To prove (iii), suppose there is a number x1 ̸ a for which the series
converges and a number x2 ̸ a for which it diverges. By Theorem 8.10
we must have |x1 −a| ≤|x2 −a|, for if |x2 −a| < |x1 −a|, the series
would converge for x  x2. Deﬁne the set S of real numbers
S  {ρ : the series converges for |x −a| < ρ},
and deﬁne R  sup S. Now suppose |x′ −a| < R. Then there is a ρ ∈S
such that |x′ −a| < ρ < R. By Theorem 8.10, the series converges for
x  x′. Hence the series converges for all x such that |x −a| < R. Now
suppose that |x′′ −a|  ρ′ > R. If the series converges for x′′, then ρ′ ∈S,
and we contradict the fact that R  sup S. Therefore, the series diverges
for |x −a| > R, completing the proof.

Therefore, the series converges for 1
2 |x −1| < 1 or for −1 < x < 3. By
noting that for x  −1 and x  3 the series is a p-series with p  2, we
conclude that the series converges for all x in the interval −1 ≤x ≤3
and diverges for all other values of x.

Uniform Convergence
Let {fn} be a sequence of functions with each function having a domain
containing an interval I of R1 and with range in R1. The convergence of
such a sequence may be examined at each value x in I. The concept of
uniform convergence, one that determines the nature of the convergence
of the sequence for all x in I, has many applications in analysis. Of special
interest is Theorem 8.12, which states that if all the fn are continuous, then
the limit function must be also.
Deﬁnition
We say the sequence {fn} converges uniformly on the interval I to the
function f if for each ε > 0 there is a number N independent of x such
that
(8.4)
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε for all x ∈I and all n > N.
Uniform convergence differs from ordinary pointwise convergence in
that the integer N does not depend on x, although naturally it depends on
ε.
The geometric meaning of uniform convergence is illustrated in Figure
8.1. Condition (8.4) states that if ε is any positive number, then for n > N
the graph of y  fn(x) lies entirely below the graph of f(x) + ε and entirely
above the graph of f(x) −ε.
Figure 8.1 Illustrating uniform convergence.
It can happen that a sequence {fn(x)} converges to f(x) for each x on an
interval I but that the convergence is not uniform. For example, consider
the functions
fn : x →
2nx
1 + n2x2 ,
I  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1}.

8.3.
Uniform Convergence
163
The graphs of fn for n  1, 2, 3, 4 are shown in Figure 8.2. If x ̸ 0, we
write
fn(x) 
2x/n
x2 + (1/n2)
and observe that fn(x) →0 for each x > 0. Moreover, fn(0)  0 for all n.
Hence, setting f(x) ≡0 on I, we conclude that fn(x) →f(x) for all x on I.
Figure 8.2 Illustrating nonuniform convergence to f(x) ≡0.
Taking the derivative of fn, we ﬁnd
f ′
n(x)  2n(1 −n2x2)
(1 + n2x2)2 .
Therefore, fn has a maximum at x  1/n with fn(1/n)  1. Thus if ε > 1,
there is no number N such that |fn(x) −f(x)| < ε for all n > N and all x
on I; in particular, |fn(1/n) −f(1/n)|  1 for all n.
The deﬁnition of uniform convergence is seldom a practical method
for deciding whether or not a speciﬁc sequence converges uniformly. The
importance of uniform convergence with regard to continuous functions
is illustrated in the next theorem.
Theorem 8.12
Suppose that fn, n  1,2, . . ., is a sequence of continuous functions on an
interval I and that {fn} converges uniformly to f on I. Then f is continuous
on I.

164
8.
Inﬁnite Series
Proof
Suppose ε > 0 is given. Then there is an N such that
(8.5)
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε
3 for all x on I and all n > N.
Let x0 be any point in I. Since fN+1 is continuous on I, there is a δ > 0
such that
(8.6)
|fN+1(x) −fN+1(x0)| < ε
3 for all x ∈I such that |x −x0| < δ.
Also, by means of (8.5) and (8.6), we obtain
|f(x) −f(x0)| ≤|f(x) −fN+1(x)| + |fN+1(x) −fN+1(x0)| + |fN+1(x0) −f(x0)|
< ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3  ε,
which is valid for all x on I such that |x −x0| < δ. Thus f is continuous
at x0, an arbitrary point of I.
The next result shows that a uniformly convergent sequence of
continuous functions may be integrated term by term.
Theorem 8.13 (Integration of uniformly convergent sequences)
Suppose that each fn, n  1,2, . . ., is continuous on the bounded interval I
and that {fn} converges uniformly to f on I. Let c ∈I and deﬁne
Fn(x) 
 x

Then f is continuous on I, and Fn converges uniformly to the function
F(x) 
 x
c
f(t)dt.
Proof
That f is continuous on I follows from Theorem 8.12. Let L be the length
of I. For any ε > 0 it follows from the uniform convergence of {fn} that
there is an N such that
|fn(t) −f(t)| < ε
L for all n > N and all t on I.
We conclude that

The next theorem illustrates when we can draw conclusions about the
term-by-term differentiation of convergent sequences.

8.3.
Uniform Convergence

Theorem 8.14
Suppose that {fn} is a sequence of functions each having one continuous deriva-
tive on an open interval I. Suppose that fn(x) converges to f (x) for each x on I
and that the sequence f ′
n converges uniformly to g on I. Then g is continuous
on I; and f ′(x)  g(x) for all x on I.
Proof
That g is continuous on I follows from Theorem 8.12. Let c be any point
on I. For each n and each x on I, we have
 x
c
f ′
n(t)dt  fn(x) −fn(c).
Since {f ′

on I, we may apply Theorem 8.13 to get
(8.7)
 x
c
g(t)dt  f(x) −f(c).
The result follows by differentiating (8.7).
Many of the results on uniform convergence of sequences of functions
from R1 to R1 generalize directly to functions deﬁned on a set A in a
metric space S and with range in R1.
Deﬁnition
Let A be a set in a metric space S and suppose that fn : S →R1,
n  1, 2, . . ., is a sequence of functions. The sequence {fn} converges
uniformly on A to a function f : A →R1 if for every ε > 0 there is a
number N such that
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε for all x ∈A and all n > N.
The next theorem is an extension of Theorem 8.12.
Theorem 8.15
Suppose that each fn is continuous on a set A in a metric space S where
fn:S →R1. If {fn} converges uniformly to f on A, then f is continuous on A.
The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 8.12.
Theorem 8.13 has a generalization to functions deﬁned in N-
dimensional Euclidean space.
Theorem 8.16
Let F be a closed region in RN and suppose that fn:F →R1, n  1,2, . . ., is
a sequence of continuous functions that converges uniformly to f on F. Then
f is continuous on F, and

The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 8.13.
Let {fn} be a sequence deﬁned on a bounded open set G in RN with
range in R1. Writing fn(x1, x2, . . . , xN) for the value of fn at (x1, x2, . . . , xN),
we recall that
fn,k and
∂
∂xk
fn(x1, x2, . . . , xN)
are symbols for the partial derivative of fn with respect to xk.
Theorem 8.17
Let k be an integer such that 1 ≤k ≤N. Suppose that for each n, the
functions fn:G →R1 and fn,k are continuous on G, a bounded open set in RN.
Suppose that {fn(x)} converges to f (x) for each x ∈G and that {fn,k} converges
uniformly to a function g on G. Then g is continuous on G, and
f,k(x)  g(x) for all x ∈G.
The proof is almost identical to the proof of Theorem 8.14.
If a sequence of continuous functions {fn} converges at every point to
a continuous function f , it is not necessarily true that

fndV →

fdV as n →∞.
Simple convergence at every point is not sufﬁcient, as the following
example shows. We form the sequence (for n  2, 3, 4, . . .)

Uniform Convergence of Series;
Power Series
Let uk(x), k  1, 2, . . ., be functions deﬁned on a set A in a metric space
S with range in R1.
Deﬁnition
The inﬁnite series ∞
k1 uk(x) has the partial sums sn(x)  n
k1 uk(x).
The series is said to converge uniformly on a set A to a function s if
the sequence of partial sums {sn} converges uniformly to s on the set A.
The above deﬁnition shows that theorems on uniform convergence
of inﬁnite series may be reduced to corresponding results for uniform
convergence of sequences.
Theorem 8.18 (Analogue of Theorem 8.12)
Suppose that un, n  1,2, . . ., are continuous on a set A in a metric space S
and that ∞
n1 un(x) converges uniformly on A to a function s(x). Then s is
continuous on A.
The proof of Theorem 8.18 as well as the proofs of the next two
theorems reduce to the proofs of the corresponding results for sequences.
Theorem 8.19 (Term-by-term integration of inﬁnite series)
Let un(x), n  1,2, . . ., be functions whose domain is a bounded interval
I in R1 with range in R1. Suppose that each un is integrable on I and that
∞
n1 un(x) converges uniformly on I to s(x). Then s is integrable on I. If c is

then ∞

Theorem 8.20 (Term-by-term differentiation of inﬁnite series)
Let k be an integer with 1 ≤k ≤N. Suppose that un and un,k, n  1,2, . . ., are
continuous functions deﬁned on an open set G in RN (range in R1). Suppose
that the series ∞
n1 un(x) converges for each x ∈G to s(x) and that the series
∞
n1 un,k(x) converges uniformly on G to t(x). Then
s,k(x)  t(x) for all x in G.
The following theorem gives a useful indirect test for uniform conver-
gence. It is important to observe that the test can be applied without any
knowledge of the sum of the series.
Theorem 8.21 (Weierstrass M-test)
Let un(x), n  1,2, . . ., be deﬁned on a set A in a metric space S with range
in R1. Suppose that |un(x)| ≤Mn for all n and for all x ∈A. Suppose that the
series of constants ∞
n1 Mn converges. Then ∞
n1 un(x) and ∞
n1 |un(x)|
converge uniformly on A.

By the Comparison test (Theorem 8.4) we know that ∞

Inﬁnite Series
The next theorem on the uniform convergence of power series is a
direct consequence of the Weierstrass M-test.
Theorem 8.22
Suppose that the series ∞
n0 cn(x −a)n converges for x  x1 with x1 ̸ a.
Then the series converges uniformly on I  {x:a −h ≤x ≤a + h} for each
h < |x1 −a|. Also, there is a number M such that
(8.8)
|cn(x −a)n| ≤M ·

h
|x1 −a|
n
for
|x −a| ≤h < |x1 −a|.
Proof
Inequality (8.8) is the inequality stated in Theorem 8.10. The series
∞

n0
M(
h
|x1 −a| )n
is a geometric series of constants that converges. Therefore, the uniform
convergence of ∞
n0 cn(x −a)n follows from the Weierstrass M-test.
Example 1
Given the series
(8.9)
∞

n0
(n + 1)xn,
ﬁnd all values of h such that the series converges uniformly on I  {x :
|x| ≤h}.
Solution. For |x| ≤h, we have |(n + 1)xn| ≤(n + 1)hn. By the ratio test,
the series ∞
n0(n + 1)hn converges when h < 1. Therefore, the series
(8.9) converges uniformly on I  {x : |x| ≤h} if h < 1. The series (8.9)
does not converge for x  ±1, and hence there is uniform convergence
if and only if h < 1.

Solution. For |x| ≤h, we have |xn/n2| ≤hn/n2. The p-series ∞
n1 1/n2
converges, and by the Comparison test, the series ∞
n1 hn/n2 converges

8.4.

171
if h ≤1. By the Ratio test, the series (8.10) diverges if x > 1. We conclude
that the series (8.10) converges uniformly on I  {x : |x| ≤1}.
Theorem 8.23
Suppose that the series
(8.11)
f(x) 
∞

n0
cn(x −a)n
converges for |x −a| < R with R > 0. Then f and f ′ are continuous on
|x −a| < R, and
(8.12)
f ′(x) 
∞

n1
ncn(x −a)n−1 for |x −a| < R.
Proof
Choose x1 such that |x1 −a| < R and then choose h such that 0 < h <
|x1 −a|. Then the series (8.11) converges uniformly on I  {x : |x −a| ≤
h}, and there is a number M such that
|cn(x −a)n| ≤M

h
|x1 −a|
n
for |x −a| ≤h.
According to Theorem 8.18, the function f is continuous on I. Also, we
obtain
|ncn(x −a)n−1| ≤n|cn|hn−1 ≤nM
h

h
|x1 −a|
n
≡un.
From the ratio test, the series ∞
n1 un converges, so that the series (8.12)
converges uniformly on I. Hence the function f ′ is continuous on I. Since
h may be chosen as any positive number less than R, we conclude that f
and f ′ are continuous for |x −a| < R.
With the aid of Theorem 8.23, we obtain the following theorem on
term-by-term differentiation and integration of power series.
Theorem 8.24
Let f be given by
(8.13)
f(x) 
∞

n0
cn(x −a)n for |x −a| < R with R > 0.
(i) Then f possesses derivatives of all orders. For each positive integer m,
the derivative f (m)(x) is given for |x −a| < R by the term-by-term
differentiation of (8.13) m times.
(ii) If F is deﬁned for |x −a| < R by
F(x) 
 x

f (t)dt,

172

Inﬁnite Series
then F is given by the series obtained by term-by-term integration of
the series (8.13).
(iii) The constants cn are given by
(8.14)
cn  f (n)(a)
n!
.
Proof
The proof of (i) is obtained by induction. We obtain (ii) by application of
Theorem 8.19. To establish (iii), differentiate the series (8.13) n times and
set x  a in the resulting expression for f (n)(x).
Combining expressions (8.13) and (8.14), we see that any function f
deﬁned by a power series with R > 0 has the form
(8.15)
f(x) 
∞

n0
f (n)(a)

(x −a)n.
A function that has continuous derivatives of all orders in a neighbor-
hood of some point is said to be inﬁnitely differentiable. It may happen
that a function f is inﬁnitely differentiable at some point a but is not rep-
resentable by a power series such as (8.15). An example of such an f is
given by
f : x →

e−1/x2
if x ̸ 0,
0
if x  0.
By differentiation, we ﬁnd that for x ̸ 0
f ′(x)  2x−3e−1/x2,
f ′′(x)  x−6(4 −6x2)e−1/x2,
...
f (n)(x)  x−3nPn(x)e−1/x2,
where Pn is a polynomial. By l’Hˆopital’s rule, it is not hard to verify that
f (n)(x) →0 as x →0 for n  1, 2, . . .. Therefore, we know that f (n)(0)  0
for every n, and so f has continuous derivatives of all orders in a neigh-
borhood of 0. The series (8.15) for f is identically zero, but the function
f is not; therefore the power series with a  0 does not represent the
function.
One of the tools for establishing the validity of power series expan-
sions for inﬁnite series is the next result, known as Taylor’s theorem with
remainder.

Theorem 8.25 (Taylor’s theorem with remainder)
Suppose that f and its ﬁrst n derivatives are continuous on an interval con-

The formula for Rn given in (8.16) is obtained by using the fact that φ′(ξ) 
0 and setting x  ξ in the above expression.
Using Theorem 8.25 we can now establish the validity of the Taylor

where ξ is between a and x. If x > a, then a < ξ < x, and so eξ < ex; if
x < a, then x < ξ < a and eξ < ea. Hence
(8.18) Rn(a, x) ≤C(a, x) |x −a|n+1
(n + 1)! , where C(a, x) 

ex

Note that C(a, x) is independent of n. By the Ratio test, the series in (8.17)
converges for all x. The form of Rn in (8.18) shows that Rn →0 as n →∞.
Therefore, the series (8.17) converges to ex for each x and a.

In many applications of Taylor’s theorem with remainder, it is impor-
tant to obtain speciﬁc bounds on the remainder term. The theorem which
follows gives the remainder Rn in an integral form and is often useful in
obtaining precise estimates.

Since f,1 is continuous on the closed, bounded set R, it is uniformly

The Derivative of an Integral
Since ε is arbitrary, the left side of the above inequality tends to 0 as
h →0. Formula (9.2) is the result.
If the function f in (9.1) can be integrated explicitly with respect to t,
then ﬁnding the derivative of φ is a straightforward computation. How-
ever, there are situations in which f cannot be integrated, but f,1 can. We
give an example illustrating this point.
Example 1
Deﬁne f : R2 →R1 by
f(x, t) →

(sin xt)/t
for t ̸ 0,
x
for t  0.
Find φ′, where φ(x) 
 π/2
0
f(x, t)dt.
Solution. We have
lim
t→0
sin xt
t
 x lim
t→0
sin(xt)
(xt)
 x · 1  x,
and so f is continuous on A  {(x, t) : −∞< x < ∞, 0 ≤t ≤π/2}.
Also,
f,1(x, t) 

(cos xt)/t
for t ̸ 0,
1
for t  0.
Hence f,1 is continuous on A. We apply Leibniz’s rule and obtain
φ′(x) 
 π/2
0
cos xt dt  sin(π/2)x
x
,
x ̸ 0,
and so φ′(0)  π/2. Observe that the expression for φ(x) cannot be
integrated.
We now take up an important extension of Leibniz’s rule. Suppose that
f is deﬁned as before and, setting I  {x : a ≤x ≤b} and J  {t : c ≤
t ≤d}, let h0 and h1 be two given functions with domain on I and range
on J. Suppose that φ : I →R1 is deﬁned by
φ(x) 
 h1(x)
h0(x)
f(x, t) dt.
We now develop a formula for φ′. To do so we consider a function F :
R3 →R1 deﬁned by
(9.6)
F(x, y, z) 
 z
y
f(x, t)dt.

Theorem 9.2
Suppose that f and f,1 are continuous on R  {(x,t):a ≤x ≤b, c ≤t ≤d}
and that F is deﬁned by (9.6) with x on I and y,z on J. Then
(9.7)

 z

F,2  −f(x, y),
F,3  f(x, z).
Proof
The ﬁrst formula in (9.7) is Theorem 9.1. The second and third formulas
hold because of the Fundamental theorem of calculus.
Theorem 9.3 (General Leibniz rule)
Suppose that f and f,1 are continuous on R  {(x,t):a ≤x ≤b, c ≤t ≤d}
and that h0 and h1 both have a continuous ﬁrst derivative on I with range on
J. If φ:I →R1 is deﬁned by
φ(x) 
 h1(x)
h0(x)
f(x, t)dt,
then
(9.8)
φ′(x)  f [x, h1(x)]h′
1(x) −f [x, h0(x)]h′
0(x) +
 h1(x)
h0(x)
f,1(x, t)dt.
Proof
Referring to F deﬁned in (9.6), we see that φ(x)  F(x, h0(x), h1(x)). We
apply the chain rule for ﬁnding φ′ and obtain
φ′(x)  F,1 + F,2h′
0(x) + F,3h′
1(x).
Now, inserting the values of F,1 and F,2 and F,3 from (9.7) into the above
formula with y  h0(x) and z  h1(x), we get the General Leibniz rule
(9.8).

Convergence and Divergence of
Improper Integrals
Suppose that a real-valued function f is deﬁned on the half-open interval
I  {x : a ≤x < b} and that for each c ∈I, the integral
 c
a
f(x)dx
exists. We are interested in functions f that are unbounded in a neigh-
borhood of b. For example, the function f : x →(1 −x)−1 with domain
J  {x : 0 ≤x < 1} is unbounded and has the integral
 c
0
(1 −x)−1dx  −log(1 −c)
for c ∈J.
As c tends to 1, the value of the integral tends to +∞. On the other hand,
for the unbounded function g : x →(1 −x)−1
2 deﬁned on J, we obtain
 c
0
(1 −x)−1/2dx  2 −2
√
1 −c
for c ∈J.
Observe that this integral has the ﬁnite limiting value 2 as c →1. With
these examples in mind we deﬁne an improper integral.
Deﬁnitions
Suppose that f is integrable for each number c in the half-open interval
I  {x : a ≤x < b}. The integral
 b

f(x)dx
is convergent if
lim
c→b−
 c

exists. If the limit does not exist, the integral is divergent. If f is bounded
on an interval J  {x : a ≤x ≤b} except in a neighborhood of an interior
point d ∈J, then

Example 1
Show that the integrals
 b
a (b−x)−pdx and
 b
a (x−a)−pdx converge for p < 1
and diverge for p ≥1.
Solution. For a < c < b and p ̸ 1 we have

1 −p

c
a
 (b −a)1−p
1 −p
−(b −c)1−p
1 −p
.
For p < 1, the expression on the right tends to (b−a)1−p/(1−p) as c →b−.
For p > 1, there is no limit. The case p  1 yields log(b −a) −log(b −c),
which has no limit as c →b−.
When the integral of an unbounded function is convergent, we say that
the improper integral exists.
In analogy with the convergence of inﬁnite series, it is important to
establish criteria that determine when improper integrals exist. The fol-
lowing result, the Comparison test, is a basic tool in determining when
integrals converge and diverge.
Theorem 9.4 (Comparison Test)
Suppose that f is continuous on the half-open interval I  {x:a ≤x < b} and
that 0 ≤|f (x)| ≤g(x) for all x ∈I. If
 b
a g(x) dx converges, then
 b
a f (x) dx
converges and

 b

Proof
First suppose that f(x) ≥0 on I and deﬁne
F : x →
 x
a
f(t) dt,
G : x →
 x
a
g(t) dt.
Then F and G are nondecreasing on I, and by hypothesis, G(x) tends to
a limit, say M, as x →b−. Since F(x) ≤G(x) ≤M on I, we ﬁnd from the
Axiom of continuity that F(x) tends to a limit as x →b−.

If f is not always nonnegative, deﬁne
f1(x)  |f(x)| + f(x)

Then f1 and f2 are continuous on I and nonnegative there. Moreover,
f1(x) + f2(x)  |f(x)| ≤g(x),
f1(x) −f2(x)  f(x).
From the proof for nonnegative functions, the integrals
 b
a f1(x)dx,
 b
a f2(x)dx exist; using the theorem on the limit of a sum, we see that

We have
xβ
√
1 −x2 
xβ
(1 −x)(1 + x) 
xβ
√1 + x g(x).
Since xβ ≤√1 + x for 0 ≤x ≤1, it follows that |f(x)| ≤g(x). By Example
1 we know that
 1
0 1/√1 −xdx is convergent, and so the original integral
converges.
We now take up the convergence of integrals in which the integrand
is bounded but where the interval of integration is unbounded.
Deﬁnitions
Let f be deﬁned on I  {x : a ≤x < +∞} and suppose that
 c
a f(x)dx
exists for each c ∈I. Deﬁne
 +∞
a
f(x)dx  lim

 c

f(x)dx
whenever the limit on the right exists. In such cases, we say that the in-
tegral converges; when the limit does not exist, we say that the integral

186
9.
The Derivative of an Integral
diverges. If f is deﬁned on J  {x : −∞< x < +∞}, we may consider
expressions of the form
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx,
which are determined in terms of two limits, one tending to +∞and the
other to −∞. Let d be any point in J. Deﬁne

 d

whenever both limits on the right exist. It is a simple matter to see that if
f is integrable for every ﬁnite interval of J, then the values of the limits
in (9.9) do not depend on the choice of the point d.
To illustrate the convergence and divergence properties of integrals
when the path of integration is inﬁnite, we show that
 +∞
a
x−pdx,
a > 0,
converges for p > 1 and diverges for p ≤1. To see this, observe that
(p ̸ 1)
 c
a
x−pdx 
1
1 −p [c1−p −a1−p].
For p > 1, the right side tends to (1/(p −1))a1−p as c →+∞, while for
p < 1 there is no limit. By the same argument, the case p  1 yields
divergence. Similarly, the integral
 b
−∞
|x|−pdx,
b < 0,
converges for p > 1 and diverges for p ≤1. In analogy with the Com-
parison test for integrals over a ﬁnite path of integration, we state the
following result.
Corollary
For continuous functions f and g deﬁned on the interval I  {x:a ≤x < +∞},
Theorem 9.4 is valid with respect to integrals

9.2.
Convergence and Divergence of Improper Integrals
187
However,
 +∞
1
(1/(2x))dx diverges, and so the integral is divergent.
The convergence of integrals with unbounded integrands and over
an inﬁnite interval may be treated by combining Theorem 9.4 and the
corollary. The next example illustrates the method.
Example 4
Test for convergence:
 +∞
0
e−x

Solution. Because the integrand is unbounded near x  0 we decompose
the problem into two parts:
 1
0
e−x
√x dx
and
 +∞
1
e−x
√x dx.
In the ﬁrst integral we have e−x/√x ≤1/√x, and the integral converges
by the Comparison test. In the second integral we have e−x/√x ≤e−x,
and once again the Comparison test yields the result, since
 +∞
1
e−xdx is
convergent. Hence, the original integral converges.
We consider the integral
 +∞
0
tx−1e−tdt,
which we shall show is convergent for x > 0. Since the integrand is
unbounded near zero when x is between 0 and 1, the integral may be
split into two parts:
 +∞
0
tx−1e−tdt 
 1
0
tx−1e−tdt +
 +∞
1
tx−1e−tdt ≡I1 + I2.
In the ﬁrst integral on the right, we use the inequality
tx−1e−t ≤tx−1
for x > 0
and 0 < t ≤1.
The integral
 1
0 tx−1dt converges for x > 0, and so I1 does also. As for I2,
an estimate for the integrand is obtained ﬁrst by writing
tx−1e−t  tx+1e−tt−2
and then estimating the function
f : t →tx+1e−t.

188
9.
The Derivative of an Integral
We ﬁnd f ′(t)  txe−t(x + 1 −t), and f has a maximum when t  x + 1.
This maximum value is f(x + 1)  (x + 1)x+1e−(x+1). Therefore,
I2 
 +∞
1
tx−1e−tdt 
 +∞

 (x + 1)x+1e−(x+1).
Hence I2 is convergent for each ﬁxed x > −1.
Deﬁnition
For x > 0 the Gamma function, denoted by H(x), is deﬁned by the
formula
H(x) 
 +∞
0
tx−1e−tdt.
The recursion formula
(9.10)
H(x + 1)  xH(x),
one of the most important properties of the Gamma function, is derived
by means of an integration by parts. To see this, we write
 c
0
txe−tdt  [tx(−e−t)]|c
0 + x
 c
0
tx−1e−tdt.
Now, letting c →+∞, we obtain (9.10).
It is easy to verify that H(1)  1, and consequently that H(n+1)  n! for
positive integers n. Note that the Gamma function is a smooth extension
to the positive real numbers of the factorial function, which is deﬁned
only for the natural numbers.

Functions of Bounded Variation
In this section we introduce the notion of the variation of a function. This
quantity is useful for problems in physics, engineering, probability the-
ory, Fourier series, and many other subjects. However, our main purpose
here is to show how this concept can enlarge enormously the class of
functions that are integrable.
Deﬁnitions
Let I  {x : a ≤x ≤b} be an interval and f : I →R1 a given function.
The variation of f over I, denoted by Vb
af , is the quantity
Vb
af  sup
n

i1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)|,
where the supremum is taken over all possible subdivisions a  x0 <
x1 < . . . < xn  b of I. If the number Vb
af is ﬁnite, we say that f is
of bounded variation on I. If f is not of bounded variation, we write
Vb
af  +∞.
We ﬁrst establish several of the fundamental properties of the variation
of a function. If the function f is kept ﬁxed, then Vb
af depends only on
the interval I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}. The following theorem shows that the
variation is additive on intervals.

Theorem 10.1
Let f :I →R1 be given and suppose that c ∈I. Then
(10.1)
Vb
af  Vc
af + Vb
c f.
Proof
(a) We ﬁrst show that Vb
af ≤Vc
af + Vb
c f . We may suppose that both terms
on the right are ﬁnite. Let 4 : a  x0 < x1 < . . . < xn  b be any
subdivision. We form the subdivision 4′ by introducing the additional
point c, which falls between xk−1 and xk, say. Then
k−1

i1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)| + |f(c) −f(xk−1)| ≤Vc
af,
n

ik+1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)| + |f(xk) −f(c)| ≤Vb
c f.
From the inequality |f(xk) −f(xk−1)| ≤|f(xk) −f(c)| + |f(c) −f(xk−1)|, it
follows that
n

i1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)| ≤Vc
af + Vb
c f.
Since the subdivision 4 is arbitrary, we obtain Vb
af ≤Vc
af + Vb
c f .
(b) We now show that Vb
af ≥Vc
af +Vb
c f . If Vb
af  +∞, then the inequality
clearly holds. Hence we may assume that all three quantities are ﬁnite.
Now let ε > 0 be given. From the deﬁnition of supremum, there is a
subdivision
41 : a  x0 < x1 < . . . < xk  c
such that
k

i1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)| > Vc

Similarly, there is a subdivision 42 : c  xk < xk+1 . . . < xn  b such
that



The Riemann–Stieltjes Integral
Example 1
Suppose that f is a nondecreasing function on I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}. Show
that Vx
af  f(x) −f(a) for x ∈I.
Solution. Let x be in I and let 4 be a subdivision a  x0 < x1 < . . . <
xn−1 < xn  x. We have

i1
|f(xi) −f(xi−1)| 


i1
[f(xi) −f(xi−1)]  f(x) −f(a),
the ﬁrst equality holding because f is nondecreasing, and the second
because all the terms except the ﬁrst and last cancel. Since the above
equalities hold for every subdivision, they hold also for the supremum.
Hence Vx
af  f(x) −f(a).
By the same argument it is clear that if f is nonincreasing on I, then
Vx
af  f(a) −f(x).
Theorem 10.2
Suppose that f is continuous on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b} and f ′ is bounded on I.
Then f is of bounded variation.
Proof
If |f ′| ≤M on I, we may apply the Mean-value theorem to obtain |f(xk) −
f(xk−1)| ≤M|xk −xk−1| for any two points xk−1, xk of I. Therefore, for any
subdivision 4,

The theorem above gives us an easy sufﬁcient condition for deter-
mining when a function is of bounded variation. Since functions may
be of bounded variation without being continuous, the set of functions
with ﬁnite variation is much larger than the set having a bounded ﬁrst
derivative.
The next theorem exhibits an important relationship between mono-
tone functions and functions of bounded variation. It shows that every
function of bounded variation is the difference of two nondecreasing
functions.
Theorem 10.3
Suppose that f is of bounded variation on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b}. Then there are
nondecreasing functions g and h on I such that
(10.2)
f(x)  g(x) −h(x)
for
x ∈I,

Functions of Bounded Variation
193
and Vx
af  g(x)+h(x)−f (a) for x ∈I. Moreover, if f is continuous on the left
at any point c ∈I, then g and h are also. Similarly, g and h are continuous
on the right wherever f is.
Proof
Choose
g(x)  1
2 [f(a) + Vx
af + f(x)],
h(x)  1
2 [f(a) + Vx
af −f(x)].
((10.3))
To show that g is nondecreasing, observe that 2g(x2) −2g(x1)  Vx2
x1 f +
f(x2) −f(x1). Since we have Vx2
x1 f ≥|f(x2) −f(x1)|, it follows that g(x2) ≥
g(x1). The proof for h is similar.
Suppose that f is continuous on the left or right at c. Then so is ϕ,
where ϕ(x)  Vx
af . The continuity result follows directly from Theorem
10.2 and the explicit formulas for g and h.
The decomposition of f given by (10.2) and (10.3) is not unique. If ψ
is any nondecreasing function on I, we also have the decomposition f 
(g+ψ)−(h+ψ). In fact, if ψ is strictly increasing, then this decomposition
of f is the difference of two strictly increasing functions.
The next result gives a sufﬁcient condition for determining when a
function is of bounded variation, and also a method for computing its
variation.

A function f may be of bounded variation without having a bounded

However, f ′ is unbounded at the origin.

The Riemann–Stieltjes Integral
We introduce a generalization of the Riemann integral, one in which a
function f is integrated with respect to a second function g. If g(x)  x,
then the generalized integral reduces to the Riemann integral. This new
integral, called the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, has many applications not
only in various branches of mathematics, but in physics and engineering
as well. By choosing the function g appropriately we shall see that the
Riemann–Stieltjes integral allows us to represent discrete as well as con-
tinuous processes in terms of integrals. This possibility yields applications
to probability theory and statistics.

The Riemann–Stieltjes Integral
Deﬁnitions
Let f and g be functions from I  {x : a ≤x ≤b} into R1. Suppose that
there is a number A such that for each ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 for which
(10.4)

n

i1
f(ζi)[g(xi) −g(xi−1)] −A
 < ε
for every subdivision 4 of mesh size less than δ and for every sequence
{ζi} with xi−1 ≤ζi ≤xi, i  1, 2, . . . , n. Then we say that f is inte-
grable with respect to g on I. We also say that the integral exists in the
Riemann–Stieltjes sense. The number A is called the R–S integral of f
with respect to g, and we write
A 
 b
a
f dg 
 b
a
f(x)dg(x).
As in the case of a Riemann integral, it is a simple matter to show that
when the number A exists, it is unique. Furthermore, when g(x)  x,
the sum in (10.4) is a Riemann sum, and the R–S integral reduces to the
Riemann integral.
It is important to observe that the R–S integral may exist when g is not
continuous. For example, with I  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1} let f(x) ≡1 on I,
g(x) 



0
for 0 ≤x < 1
2 ,
1
for 1
2 ≤x ≤1.
The quantity n
i1 f(ζi)[g(xi) −g(xi−1)] reduces to n
i1[g(xi) −g(xi−1)].
However, all these terms are zero except for the subinterval that contains
x 
1
2 . In any case, the terms of the sum “telescope,” so that its value is
g(1) −g(0)  1. Therefore, for every subdivision, the Riemann–Stieltjes
sum has the value 1, and this is the value of the R–S integral.
The R–S integral may not exist if f has a single point of discontinuity,
provided that the function g is also discontinuous at the same point. For
example, with I  {x : 0 ≤x ≤1} deﬁne
f(x) 



1
for 0 ≤x < 1
2 ,

The quantity n
i1 f(ζi)[g(xi) −g(xi−1)] reduces to the single term that
corresponds to the subinterval containing x 
1
2 . That is, we have one
term of the form
f(ζk)[g(xk) −g(xk−1)],
where xk−1 ≤
1
2 ≤xk and xk−1 ≤ζk ≤xk. Then g(xk) −g(xk−1)  1, but
the value of f(ζk) will be 1 or 2, depending on whether ζk is chosen less

2 . Since these two choices may be
made regardless of the mesh of the subdivision, the R–S integral does not
exist.
The R–S integral has properties of additivity and homogeneity similar
to those of the Riemann integral. These are stated in the next theorem.
Theorem 10.5

The next theorem shows that if g is smooth, then the R–S integral is
reducible to an ordinary Riemann integral. This reduction is useful for
the calculation of Riemann–Stieltjes integrals. We show later that the R–S
integral exists for much larger classes of functions.

The sum on the right is a R–S sum that satisﬁes (10.13). Hence the right
side of (10.14) differs from the right side of (10.12) by less than ε. But the
left side of (10.14) is the R–S sum for the left side of (10.12). Since ε is
arbitrary, the result follows.
We shall show that if f is continuous and g of bounded variation on an
interval I  {x : a ≤x ≤b}, then
 b
a f dg exists. Theorem (10.8) shows
that if the hypotheses on f and g are reversed, the R–S integral will still
exist.
We recall that any function of bounded variation may be represented
as the difference of two monotone functions. Therefore, if the existence
of the R–S integral
 b
a f dg when f is continuous and g is nondecreasing
is established, it follows that the R–S integral exists when f is continuous
and g is of bounded variation. To establish the existence of the R–S integral
for as large a class as possible, we shall employ the method of Darboux
described in Chapter 5. We begin by deﬁning upper and lower Darboux–
Stieltjes sums and integrals.
Deﬁnitions
Suppose that f and g are deﬁned on I  {x : a ≤x ≤b} and g is
nondecreasing on I. Let 4 : a  x0 < x1 < . . . < xn  b be a subdivision
of I. Deﬁne 4ig  g(xi) −g(xi−1), i  1, 2, . . . , n. Note that 4ig ≥0 for

Since g is nondecreasing, observe that the numbers Ii  4ig  g(xi) −

is a subdivision ¯4 of the interval g(b) −g(a), and if 4′ is a reﬁnement of
4, then there is induced a corresponding reﬁnement ¯4′ of ¯4.
The next result is completely analogous to the corresponding theorem
on Darboux sums.
Theorem 10.9
Suppose that f and g are deﬁned on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b} and g is nondecreasing
on I.
(a) If m ≤f (x) ≤M on I and 4 is any subdivision, then
m[g(b) −g(a)] ≤S−(f, g, 4) ≤S+(f, g, 4) ≤M[g(b) −g(a)].
(b) If 4′ is a reﬁnement of 4, then
S−(f, g, 4′) ≥S−(f, g, 4)
and
S+(f, g, 4′) ≤S+(f, g, 4).
(c) If 41 and 42 are any subdivisions of I, then
S−(f, g, 41) ≤S+(f, g, 42).

The proof of Theorem 10.10 is similar to the proof of the corresponding
results for Riemann integrals.
Theorem 10.11
Suppose that f is continuous on I  {x:a ≤x ≤b} and that g is nondecreasing
on I. Then the Riemann–Stieltjes integral
 b
a f dg exists.
Proof
Since f is uniformly continuous on I, for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0
such that
|f(x) −f(y)| <
ε
2[1 + g(b) −g(a)]
whenever |x −y| < δ. Let 4 : a  x0 < x1 < . . . < xn  b be a
subdivision of I with mesh less than δ. Deﬁne Ii  {x : xi−1 ≤x ≤xi}.
Since f is continuous on each Ii, there are numbers ηi and ζi on Ii such
that mi  f(ηi) and Mi  f(ζi). Then we have

11.1
The Implicit Function Theorem
Suppose we are given a relation in R2 of the form
(11.1)
F(x, y)  0.
Then to each value of x there may correspond one or more values of y
that satisfy (11.1)—or there may be no values of y that do so. If I  {x :
x0 −h < x < x0 + h} is an interval such that for each x ∈I there is exactly
one value of y satisfying (11.1), then we say that F(x, y)  0 deﬁnes y as
a function of x implicitly on I. Denoting this function by f , we have
F[x, f(x)]  0 for x on I.
An implicit function theorem determines conditions under which a
relation such as (11.1) deﬁnes y as a function of x or x as a function of y.
The solution is a local one in the sense that the size of the interval I may
be much smaller than the domain of the relation F. Figure 11.1 shows the
graph of a relation such as (11.1). We see that F deﬁnes y as a function
of x in a region about P, but not beyond the point Q. Furthermore, the
relation does not yield y as a function of x in any region containing the
point Q in its interior.
The simplest example of an implicit function theorem states that if F
is smooth and if P is a point at which F,2 (that is, ∂F/∂y) does not vanish,
then it is possible to express y as a function of x in a region containing
this point. More precisely, we have the following result.

The Implicit Function Theorem. Lagrange Multipliers
Theorem 11.1
Suppose that F, F,1, and F,2 are continuous on an open set A in R2 containing
the point P(x0,y0), and suppose that
F(x0, y0)  0,
F,2(x0, y0) ̸ 0.
Figure 11.1
(a) Then there are positive numbers h and k that determine a rectangle R
contained in A given by
R  {(x,y):|x −x0| < h,|y −y0| < k},
such that for each x in I  {x:|x −x0| < h} there is a unique number
y in J  {y:|y −y0| < k} that satisﬁes the equation F(x,y)  0. The
totality of the points (x,y) forms a function f whose domain contains I
and whose range is in J.
(b) The function f and its derivative f ′ are continuous on I.
Proof
(a) We assume F,2(x0, y0) > 0; if not we replace F by −F and repeat the
argument. Since F,2 is continuous, there is a (sufﬁciently small) square
S  {(x, y) : |x −x0| ≤k, |y −y0| ≤k} that is contained in A and on
which F,2 is positive. For each ﬁxed value of x such that |x −x0| < k we
see that F(x, y), considered as a function of y, is an increasing function.
Since F(x0, y0)  0, it is clear that
F(x0, y0 + k) > 0
and
F(x0, y0 −k) < 0.
Because F is continuous on S, there is a (sufﬁciently small) number h
such that F(x, y0 + k) > 0 on I  {x : |x −x0| < h} and F(x, y0 −k) < 0
on I. We ﬁx a value of x in I and examine solutions of F(x, y)  0 in the
rectangle R. Since F(x, y0 −k) is negative and F(x, y0 + k) is positive, there
is a value ¯y in R such that F(x, ¯y)  0. Also, because F,2 > 0, there is

11.1.
The Implicit Function Theorem
207
precisely one such value. The correspondence x →¯y is the function we
seek, and we denote it by f .
(b) To show that f is continuous at x0 let ε > 0 be given and suppose
that ε is smaller than k. Then we may construct a square Sε with side 2ε
and center at (x0, y0) as in the proof of part (a). There is a value h′ < h
such that f is a function on I′  {x : |x −x0| < h′}. Therefore,
|f(x) −f(x0)| < ε
whenever
|x −x0| < h′,
and f is continuous at x0. At any point x1 ∈I, we construct a square S1
with center at (x1, f(x1)) and repeat the above argument.
To show that f ′ exists and is continuous we use the Fundamental lemma
on differentiation (Theorem 7.2). Let x ∈I and choose a number ρ such
that x + ρ ∈I. Then
F(x + ρ, f(x + ρ))  0
and
F(x, f(x))  0.
Writing f(x + ρ)  f + 4f and using Theorem 7.2, we obtain
(11.2)
[F,1(x, f) + ε1(ρ, 4f)]ρ + [F,2(x, f) + ε2(ρ, 4f)]4f  0,
where ε1 and ε2 tend to zero as ρ, 4f →0. From the continuity of f ,
which we have established, it follows that 4f →0 as ρ →0. From (11.2)
it is clear that
4f
ρ
 f(x + ρ) −f(x)
ρ
 −F,1(x, f) + ε1(ρ, 4f)
F,2(x, f) + ε2(ρ, 4f) .
Since the right side tends to a limit as ρ →0, we see that
(11.3)
f ′(x)  −F,1(x, f)
F,2(x, f) .
By hypothesis the right side of (11.3) is continuous, and so f ′ is also.
The implicit function theorem has a number of generalizations and
applications. If F is a function from RN+1 to R1, we may consider whether
or not the relation F(x1, x2, . . . , xN, y)  0 deﬁnes y as a function from RN
into R1. That is, we state conditions that show that y  f(x1, x2, . . . , xN).
The proof of the following theorem is a straightforward extension of the
proof of Theorem 11.1.
Theorem 11.2
Suppose that F,F,1,F,2, . . . ,F,N+1 are continuous on an open set A in RN+1 con-
taining the point P(x0
1,x0
2, . . . ,x0
N,y0). We use the notation x  (x1,x2, . . . ,xN),
x0  (x0

N) and suppose that
F(x0, y0)  0,
F,N+1(x0, y0) ̸ 0.

R  {(x,y):|xi −x0

such that for each x in the N-dimensional hypercube

there is a unique number y in the interval
J  {y:|y −y0| < k}

may be written y  f (x). The domain of f contains IN and its range
is in J.
(b) The function f and its partial derivatives f,1,f,2, . . . ,f,N are continuous
on IN.
A special case of Theorem 11.1 is the Inverse function theorem that
was established in Chapter 4 (Theorems 4.17 and 4.18). If f is a function
from R1 to R1, written y  f(x), we wish to decide when it is true that x
may be expressed as a function of y. Set
F(x, y)  y −f(x)  0,
and in order for Theorem 11.1 to apply, f ′ must be continuous and F,1 
−f ′(x) ̸ 0. We state the result in the following corollary to Theorem 11.1.
Corollary (Inverse function theorem)
Suppose that f is deﬁned on an open set A in R1 with values in R1. Also,
assume that f ′ is continuous on A and that f (x0)  y0, f ′(x0) ̸ 0. Then there
is an interval I containing y0 such that the inverse function of f , denoted f −1,
exists on I and has a continuous derivative there. Furthermore, the derivative
(f −1)′ is given by the formula
(11.4)
(f −1(y))′ 
1
f ′(x) ,
where y  f (x).
Since f −1(f(x))  x, we can use the Chain rule to obtain (11.4). How-
ever, (11.4) is also a consequence of formula (11.3), with F(x, y)  y−f(x),
and we obtain
(f −1(y))′  −F,2
F,1
 −
1
−f ′(x) .
Observe that in Theorems 4.17 and 4.18 the inverse mapping is one-to-one
over the entire interval in which f ′ does not vanish.

Example
Given the relation
(11.5)
F(x, y)  y3 + 2x2y −x4 + 2x + 4y  0,
show that this relation deﬁnes y as a function of x for all values of x in
R1.
Solution. We have
F,2  3y2 + 2x2 + 4,
and so F,2 > 0 for all x, y. Hence for each ﬁxed x, the function F is an
increasing function of y. Furthermore, from (11.5) it follows that F(x, y) →
−∞as y →−∞, and F(x, y) →+∞as y →+∞. Since F is continuous,
for each ﬁxed x there is exactly one value of y such that F(x, y)  0.
Applying Theorem 11.1, we conclude that there is a function f on R1 that
is continuous and differentiable such that F[x, f(x)]  0 for all x.

Let D be a region in Rm and suppose that f : D →R1 is a C1 function.
At any local maximum or minimum of f(x)  f(x1, x2, . . . , xm) we know
that f,i  0, i  1, 2, . . . , m. Solving these m equations in m unknowns
yields the critical points of f . Then there are second derivative tests to
determine which among these points are maxima, minima, or points of
inﬂection. In many applications, especially in physics and engineering,
we seek not the pure maxima and minima of f , but the maximum or
minimum values of f when additional conditions are imposed. These are
usually called constraints. That is, the constraints are given by a set of
equations such as
(11.6)
ϕ1(x1, x2, . . . , xm)  0, ϕ2(x1, x2, . . . , xm)  0, . . . , ϕk(x1, x2, . . . , xm)  0.
Equations (11.6) are called side conditions. There cannot be too many side
conditions. For example, if k were larger than m, then (11.6) may not have
any solutions at all. Therefore, we suppose generally that k is less than m,
and it is easy to see that the imposition of conditions (11.6) will change
the location of the critical points of f .
The method of Lagrange multipliers employs a simple technique for
determining the maxima and minima of f when equations (11.6) hold.
The method is especially useful when it is difﬁcult or not possible to ﬁnd
solutions of the system (11.6).
The Lagrange multiplier rule is frequently explained but seldom
proved. In Theorem 11.4 below we establish the validity of this rule, which
we now describe. We introduce k new variables (or parameters), denoted
by λ  (λ1, λ2, . . . , λk), and we form the function of m + k variables
F(x, λ)  F(x1, . . . , xm, λ1, . . . , λk) ≡f(x) +

For this function F we compute the critical points when x is in D and λ in
Rk without constraints. That is, we ﬁnd solutions to the m + k equations
formed by all the ﬁrst derivatives of F(x, λ):
(11.7)
 F,i  0,
i  1, 2, . . . , m,
F,j  0,
j  1, 2, . . . , k.
We shall show that the critical points of the desired solution are among
the solutions of the system given by (11.7).

Then the function K : I →Rm deﬁned by

From the Implicit function theorem, it follows that we may solve (11.6)
for x1, . . . , xk in terms of xk+1, . . . , xm, getting
xi  µi(xk+1, . . . , xm),

then g  (g1(t), . . . , gm(t)) satisﬁes conditions (11.8) and (11.10). We have
thereby proved the following result.
Theorem 11.3
Suppose that f ,φ1,φ2, . . . ,φk are C1 functions on an open set D in Rm contain-
ing a point x0, that the vectors ∇φ1(x0), . . . ,∇φk(x0) are linearly independent,
and that f takes on its minimum among all points of D0 at x0, where D0 is the
subset of D on which the side conditions (11.6) hold. If h is any vector in Vm
orthogonal to ∇φ1(x0), . . . ,∇φk(x0), then
∇f(x0) · h  0.
The next result, concerning a simple fact about vectors in Vm, is needed
in the proof of the Lagrange multiplier rule.

12.1
Vector Functions on RN
In this section we develop the basic properties of differential and integral
calculus for functions whose domain is a subset of RM and whose range
is in a vector space VN. We shall emphasize the coordinate-free character
of the deﬁnitions and results, but we will introduce coordinate systems
and use them in proofs and computations whenever convenient.
Deﬁnition
A vector function from a domain D in RM into VN is a mapping f :
D →VN. If the image is V1 (which we identify with R1 in the natural
way), then f is called a scalar function. Vector or scalar functions are
often called vector or scalar ﬁelds. The term ﬁeld is used because we
frequently visualize a vector function as superimposed on RM. At each
point of the domain D of RM a representative directed line segment of f
is drawn with base at that point. We obtain a ﬁeld of vectors.
Let f : D →VN be a vector function where D is a domain in RM. An
orthonormal basis for VN is a set of N unit vectors e1, e2, . . . , eN such
that ei · ej  0 for i ̸ j, i, j  1, 2, . . . , N. Then for each point P ∈D, we
may represent f by the formula
(12.1)

12.1
Vector Functions on RN
215
where fi : D →R1, i  1, 2, . . . , N, are scalar functions from D into R1.
We can consider vector ﬁelds with domain in any space such as VM or EM
(Euclidean space). Equation (12.1) illustrates what is meant in that case.
We shall ordinarily assume that D is in RM. The function f is continuous
at P if each fi, i  1, 2, . . . , N, is continuous at P. We recall that the basic
properties of functions from RM into R1 were developed in Chapters 6
and 7. Properties developed there that involve linear processes are easily
transferred to functions f from RM into VN.
For simplicity we shall usually consider functions f from RN into VN,
although many of the results developed below are valid with only modest
changes if the dimension of the domain of f is different from that of its
range.
The deﬁnite integral of a vector function, deﬁned below, is similar to
the integral of a scalar function on RN as given in Chapter 7.
Deﬁnition
Let D be a domain in RN and suppose that u : D →VN is a vector
function. Let F be a subdomain in D. The function u is integrable over
F if there is a vector L in VN with the following property: For every ε > 0,
there is a δ > 0 such that if 4  {F1, F2, . . . , Fn} is any subdivision of F
with mesh less than δ, and p1, p2, . . . , pn is any ﬁnite set of points with pi
in Fi, then

where V(Fi) is the volume of Fi. We call L the integral of u over F and
we write

u dV.
If, for example, u is given in the form (12.1), so that
(12.2)
u(P) 
N

i1
ui(P)ei,
then it is clear that u is integrable over F if and only if each scalar function
ui is integrable over F. Therefore, if L exists, it must be unique. In fact, if
u is integrable and given by (12.2), we have

Each coefﬁcient on the right in (12.3) is an integral of a function from RN
into R1 as deﬁned in Chapter 7.
Let v be a vector in VN and denote by −→
p0p a directed line segment in
RN that represents v. We use the notation v(−→
p0p) for this vector.

Vector Functions on RN; The Theorems of Green and Stokes
Deﬁnitions
Let p0 be a point in RN and let a be a unit vector in VN. Suppose that
w : D →VN is a vector function with domain D in RN. We deﬁne the di-
rectional derivative of w in the direction a at p0, denoted by Daw(p0),
by the formula
Daw(p0)  lim
h→0
w(p) −w(p0)
h
,
where the point p ∈D is chosen such that v(−→
p0p)  ha. The vector func-
tion w is continuously differentiable in D if w and Daw are continuous
on D for every unit vector a in VN. We write w ∈C1(D).
In order to derive formulas for computing directional derivatives,
we require a coordinate system in RN. When we write w(p), p ∈RN,
we indicate the coordinate-free character of the function. If a Carte-
sian coordinate system (x1, x2, . . . , xN) is introduced, then we write
w(x1, x2, . . . , xN) or w(x). If e1, e2, . . . , eN is an orthonormal basis in VN,
we use coordinates to write
w(x) 

wi(x)ei,
where each of the scalar functions wi(x) is now expressed in terms of a
coordinate system.
The following theorem establishes a formula for obtaining the
directional derivative of scalar and vector ﬁelds.
Theorem 12.1
(i) Let a be a unit vector in VN. Suppose that w:D →R1 is a contin-
uously differentiable scalar ﬁeld with domain D ⊂RN. If a has the

Proof
(i) If a is a unit vector in one of the coordinate directions, say xj, then
(12.4) holds, since Daw is the partial derivative with respect to xj. In the
general case, we ﬁx a point x0  (x0
1, . . . , x0
N) and deﬁne
ϕ(t)  w(x0
1 + a1t, . . . , x0
N + aNt).

12.1
Vector Functions on RN
217
Then Daw(x0) is obtained by computing ϕ′(0) according to the Chain rule,
Theorem 7.3. The proof of (ii) is an immediate consequence of formula
(12.4) and the representation of w in the form  wiei.
The next theorem shows that the directional derivative of a scalar func-
tion may be expressed in terms of the scalar product of the given direction
a with a uniquely determined vector ﬁeld. Observe that the result is inde-
pendent of the coordinate system, although coordinates are used in the
proof.
Theorem 12.2
Let f :D →R1 be a continuously differentiable scalar ﬁeld with domain D in
RN. Then there is a unique vector ﬁeld w:D →VN such that for each unit
vector a ∈VN and for each p ∈D, the directional derivative of f is given by
the scalar product of a and w:
(12.6)
Daf(p)  a · w(p).
If e1,e2, . . . ,eN is an orthonormal set of unit vectors in VN, then w(x) may be
computed by the formula
(12.7)
w(x) 
N

j1
f,j(x)ej for each x ∈D.
Proof
From Formula (12.4), we obtain
(12.8)
Daf(x) 
N

j1
f,j(x)aj.
We now deﬁne w(x) by (12.7), and therefore the scalar product of w and
a yields (12.8). To show uniqueness, assume that w′ is another vector
ﬁeld satisfying (12.6). Then (w −w′) · a  0 for all unit vectors a. If
w −w′ ̸ 0, choose a to be the unit vector in the direction of w −w′, in
which case (w −w′) · a  |w −w′| ̸ 0, a contradiction.
Deﬁnition
The vector w deﬁned by (12.6) in Theorem 12.2 is called the gradient of
f and is denoted by grad f or ∇f .
If f is a scalar ﬁeld from RN into R1, then in general f(p)  constant
represents a hypersurface in RN. At any point p, a vector a tangent to
this hypersurface at p has the property that N
i1 f,i(p) · ai  0, where
a  N
i1 aiei. We conclude that ∇f is orthogonal to the hypersurface f (p) 
constant at each point p on the hypersurface.

and we shall show that this operator, called the divergence operator, is
independent of the coordinate system (Theorem 12.4 below).
Deﬁnitions
The support of a scalar function f with domain D is the closure of the set
of points p in D where f(p) ̸ 0. If the support of a function is a compact
subset of D, we say that f has compact support in D. If f is a Cn function
for some nonnegative integer n with compact support, we use the symbol
f ∈Cn
0(D) to indicate this fact.

Let D be an open domain in RN and suppose that f ∈C1
0(D). Then

D
f,j(x)dV  0,
j  1, 2, . . . , N.
Proof
Let S be the set of compact support of f . Then f  0 and ∇f  0 on
D −S. Let R be any hypercube that contains ¯D in its interior. We extend
the deﬁnition of f to be zero on R −D. Then integrating with respect
to xj ﬁrst and the remaining N −1 variables next, we obtain (in obvious
notation)

The next lemma, useful in many branches of analysis, shows that a
continuous function f must vanish identically if the integral of the product
of f and all arbitrary smooth functions with compact support is always
zero.

Let D be an open domain in RN and suppose that the scalar function f is
continuous on D. If

then f ≡0 on D.

Vector Functions on RN; The Theorems of Green and Stokes
Proof
We prove the result by contradiction. Suppose there is an x0 ∈D such
that f(x0) ̸ 0. We may assume f(x0) > 0; otherwise, we consider −f .
Since f is continuous and D is open, there is a ball in D of radius 3r0 and
center x0 on which f > 0. Denoting distance from x0 by r, we deﬁne the
function

which contradicts (12.9). Hence f ≡0 on D.
We now show that the divergence operator is independent of the
coordinate system.

Let D be an open domain in RN and suppose that w ∈C1(D) is a vector

0(D).
Thus v′ ≡v according to Lemma 12.2.
Deﬁnition
The scalar ﬁeld v determined by (12.10) in Theorem 12.4 and deﬁned in
any coordinate system by (12.11) is called the divergence of w. We use
the notation v  div w or v  ∇· w. We note that v is determined in
(12.10) without reference to a coordinate system, although (12.11) is used
for actual computations.
Theorem 12.5
Let D be a domain in RN and suppose that w,w1,w2, . . . ,wn are C1 vector
ﬁelds on D. Let f be a C1 scalar ﬁeld on D and suppose that c1,c2, . . . ,cn are

(b) div (f w)  f div w + ∇f · w.
The result is obtained by a straightforward computation using the rules

The vector, or cross, product of two vectors in a three-dimensional
vector space allows us to introduce a new differential operator acting on
smooth vector ﬁelds. We shall deﬁne the operator without reference to
a coordinate system; however coordinates are used in all the custom-
ary computations. If e1, e2, e3 is any orthonormal basis for V3, we may

We note that if the symbol ∇is replaced by a vector v with components
v1, v2, v3 and if the partial derivatives in (12.12) are replaced by these
components, then we obtain the usual formula for the vector product of
two vectors.
Theorem 12.6
Let D be any set in R3 and let u ∈C1(D) be a vector ﬁeld into V3. Then there
is a unique continuous vector ﬁeld w from D into V3 such that
(12.13)
div(u × a)  w · a
for every constant vector a. If e1,e2,e3 is any orthonormal basis, then the
vector w is given by (12.12).
Proof
With the orthonormal basis e1, e2, e3 given, we write a  a1e1 + a2e2 +
a3e3, u  u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3. The formula for the vector product yields
u × a  (u2a3 −u3a2)e1 + (u3a1 −u1a3)e2 + (u1a2 −u2a1)e3.
Using (12.11) for the divergence formula, we obtain

If we denote by w1, w2, w3 the coefﬁcients in the right side of (12.12),
then
div(u × a)  w1a1 + w2a2 + w3a3.
That is, div(u×a)  w·a where w  w1e1 +w2e2 +w3e3. The vector w is
unique since if w′ were another such vector we would have w · a  w′ · a
for all unit vectors a. This fact implies that w  w′.
Deﬁnition
The vector w in Theorem 12.6 is called the curl of u and is denoted by
curl u and ∇× u.
The elementary properties of the curl operator are given in the next
theorem.
Theorem 12.7
Let D be a domain in R3 and suppose that u,v,u1, . . . ,un are C1 vector ﬁelds
from D into V3. Let f be a C1 scalar ﬁeld on D and c1, . . . ,cn real numbers.

Recalling that ∇f  (∂f/∂x1)e1 + (∂f/∂x2)e2 + (∂f/∂x3)e3 and using the
formula for the vector product as given by (12.12), we see that (12.14) is
precisely
curl(f u)  f curl u + ∇f × u.
Part (d) in Theorem 12.7 states that if a vector u is the gradient of a
scalar function f , that is, if u  ∇f , then curl u  0. It is appropriate to
ask whether or not the condition curl u  0 implies that u is the gradient
of a scalar function f . Under certain conditions this statement is valid. In
any Cartesian coordinate system, the condition u  ∇f becomes

u3  ∂f

Then the statement curl u  0 asserts that the right side of (12.15) is an
exact differential.

Line Integrals in RN
Let I  {t : a ≤t ≤b} be an interval and f a vector function with
domain I and range D, a subset of VN. We consider in RN the directed
line segments having base at the origin 0 that represent the vectors f
in D. The heads of these directed line segments trace out a curve in RN,
which we denote by C. If f is continuous and the curve C has ﬁnite length,
then we say that C is a rectiﬁable path.
Let g be a continuous vector function from C into VN. If f, as deﬁned
above, is rectiﬁable, then we can determine the Riemann–Stieltjes integral
of g with respect to f. To do so we introduce a coordinate system with
an orthonormal basis e1, e2, . . . , eN in VN, although the formula we shall
obtain will be independent of the coordinate system. We write
(12.16)
g(x)  g1(x)e1 + . . . + gN(x)eN,
f(t)  f1(t)e1 + . . . + fN(t)eN,
x ∈C, t ∈I.
If f is rectiﬁable, then the functions fi : I →R1, i  1, 2, . . . , N,
are continuous and of bounded variation. Also, if g is continuous, then
the functions gi : C →RN, i  1, 2, . . . , N, are continuous. Using
the notation gi[f(t)] for gi[f1(t), . . . , fN(t)], we observe that the following
Riemann–Stieltjes integrals exist:

Vector Functions on RN; The Theorems of Green and Stokes
We now establish the basic theorem for the existence of a Riemann–

f.
Theorem 12.8
Suppose that f:I →VN is a vector function and that the range C in RN as
deﬁned above by the vector r(t)  v(−→
OP) is a rectiﬁable path. Let g be a
continuous vector ﬁeld from C into VN. Then there is a number L with the
following property: For every ε > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that for any
subdivision 4:a  t0 < t1 < . . . < tn  b with mesh less than δ and any

Let f : I →VN deﬁne an arc C in RN by means of the vector r(t)  v(−→

where −→
OP is a representation of f. It is intuitively clear that f may traverse
the arc C in one direction or its opposite direction. When we associate one
of the two possible directions to the arc C, we say that we have a directed
arc and denote it by −→
C 1. The arc directed in the opposite direction, say

If f is piecewise smooth, then the integral on the right in (12.21) may be

If a function g is continuous on a domain D in RN, then

g · dr will
depend on the path −→
C chosen in D. However, there are certain situations
in which the value of the integral will be the same for all paths −→
C in D
that have the same endpoints. Under such circumstances we say that the
integral is independent of the path. The next result illustrates this
fact.
Theorem 12.10
Suppose that u is a continuously differentiable scalar ﬁeld on a domain D in
RN and that p,q are points of D. Let −→
C be any smooth path with representation
f such that f(t) ∈D for all t on I  {t:a ≤t ≤b}, the domain of f. Suppose
that f(a)  p, f(b)  q. Then

Suppose that for every smooth arc −→

ﬁeld u on D such that ∇u(p)  v(p) for all p ∈D.

which, because of the hypothesis on v, does not depend on −→

any point of D, and −→
C 0 an arc from p0 to p1. Extend −→
C 0 at p1 by adding a
straight line segment −→
L that begins at p1 in such a way that the extended
arc −→
C 0 + −→
L is smooth. Denote by a the unit vector in the direction −→
L .
We introduce a coordinate system in RN and designate the coordinates of
p1 by x0. Then any point q on −→
L will have coordinates x0 + ta for t ∈R1.
Thus, if h > 0, we obtain

Therefore,

This procedure can be carried out for any arc −→
C 0 passing through p1
with a a unit vector in any direction. From Theorem 12.2 it follows that
∇u  v at x0, any point of D.
Suppose that u is a smooth scalar ﬁeld in R3. We saw earlier that if
v  ∇u, then it follows that curl v  0. On the other hand, if v is a given
vector ﬁeld such that curl v  0 in a domain D, it is not necessarily true
that v is the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld in D. In fact, the following example
shows that the integral of v may not be path-independent, in which case
v cannot be the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld. To see this, we set
v  (x2
1 + x2
2)−1(−x2e1 + x1e2 + 0 · e3)
with D  {(x1, x2, x3) :

However, if the integral were independent of the path, its value should
be zero, since the initial and terminal points of −→
C are the same. The

12.2
Line Integrals in RN
231
difﬁculty arises because the path −→
C encloses a singularity of v on the
line x1  x2  0, whereas the cylindrical domain D does not contain this
line.
If a smooth vector ﬁeld v is deﬁned in a domain that is not merely
connected but also simply connected, then it follows that if curl v  0,
then v is the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld u. We say (informally) that a domain
D is simply connected if any two paths situated in D that have the
same starting and ending points can be deformed continuously one into
the other without leaving D. More precisely, we state without proof the
following result.
Theorem 12.12
Suppose that v is a continuously differentiable vector ﬁeld on a simply con-
nected domain D in R3 and that curl v  0 on D. Then there is a continuously
differentiable scalar ﬁeld u on D such that v  ∇u.
Theorem 12.12 can be extended to functions v from a domain D in RN
to VN. If curl v  0 is replaced by the condition
vi,j −vj,i  0,
i, j  1, 2, . . . , N,
where v  v1e1 + . . . + vNeN, then v is the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld u
provided that the domain D is simply connected.

Green’s Theorem in the Plane
Green’s theorem is an extension to the plane of the Fundamental theorem
of calculus. We recall that this Fundamental theorem states that if I is an
interval in R1 and f : I →R1 is a continuously differentiable function
then for any points a and b in I we have the formula
(12.22)
 b
a
f ′(x)dx  f(b) −f(a).
In the extension of this theorem to the plane we suppose that F is a
domain in R2 and C is its boundary. Then Green’s theorem is a formula
that connects the line integral of a vector function over C with the double
integral of the derivative of the function taken over the domain F.
Let D be a region in R2 with a boundary that is a simple closed curve.
We denote the unoriented boundary by ∂D and the boundary oriented
in a counterclockwise direction by −→
∂D. The symbol −−→
∂D is used for the
clockwise orientation.
We shall ﬁrst establish Green’s theorem for regions in R2 that have a
special simple shape. Then we shall show how the result for these special
regions can be used to yield the same formula for general regions in the
plane.
Deﬁnitions
Suppose D is a region in R2 and v : D →V2 a vector function. We intro-
duce a coordinate system in V2 with orthonormal basis e1 and e2. There
are two possible orientations for such a basis: e2 is obtained from e1 by a

12.3.
Green’s Theorem in the Plane
233
90◦rotation in the counterclockwise direction, or e2 is obtained from e1
by a 90◦rotation in the clockwise direction. We call the plane R2 oriented
when one of these systems is introduced in V2(R2), and we use the nota-
tion −→
R
2
and −−→
R
2
for the orientations. Generally, we shall consider the
oriented plane −→
R
2
. In coordinates, we write v  P(x1, x2)e1 + Q(x1, x2)e2,
where P and Q are functions from D into R1. The scalar curl of v is the
function Q,1 −P,2; we write
curl v  Q,1 −P,2.
We recall that in V3 the curl of a vector function, is a vector function
whereas the above curl is a scalar function. To justify the above termi-
nology, observe that if v is a vector function from R3 to V3 in the special
form
v  Pe1 + Qe2 + 0 · e3,
and P  P(x1, x2), Q  Q(x1, x2), then
curl v  (Q,1 −P,2)e3.

Deﬁnitions
Let C1 and C2 be two smooth arcs that have as their only point in common
an endpoint of each of them. This point, denoted by P, is called a corner
of C1 and C2 if each of the arcs has a (one-sided) tangent line at P and if
the two tangent lines make a positive angle (see Figure 12.3). A piecewise
smooth simple closed curve is a simple closed curve that is made up
of a ﬁnite number of smooth arcs that are joined at corners.
In Lemma 12.3 we may assume that f is a piecewise continuously
differentiable (i.e., piecewise smooth) function on I consisting of a ﬁnite
number of smooth arcs joined at corners. The proof is the same.
Figure 12.3
Deﬁnition
A region D in R2 is said to be regular if (i) D is bounded, (ii) ∂D consists
of a ﬁnite number of piecewise smooth simple closed curves, and (iii) at
each point P of ∂D a Cartesian coordinate system can be constructed with
P as origin with the following properties: For sufﬁciently small a and b,
a rectangle
R  {(x1, x2) : −a ≤x1 ≤a, −b ≤x2 ≤b}
can be found such that the part of ∂D in R has the form x2  f(x1) for x1
on I  {x1 : −a ≤x1 ≤a} and with range on J  {x2 : −b < x2 < b},
where f is a piecewise smooth function (see Figure 12.4).
Of course, the values of a, b, and the function f will change with the
point P. If a rectangle R is determined for a point P, then it is clear that
any rectangle with the same value for b and a smaller value for a is also
adequate. See Figure 12.5 for examples of regions that are not regular.
If D is a regular region in −→
R
2
, a tangent vector can be drawn at any
point of ∂D that is not a corner. Let −→
T be the tangent vector at a point
P ∈∂D and construct a coordinate system in −→
R

such that e1 is parallel
to −→
T . Then ∂D may be oriented at P in two ways: The vector e2 may

point into D, or the vector e2 may point outward from D. In the ﬁrst case
we say that ∂D is oriented at P so that D is to the left; in the second case,
we say that D is to the right. It can be shown that the oriented piecewise
smooth simple closed curve −→
∂D has the property that D is always on the
left or always on the right for all points at which a tangent vector can be
drawn.
Figure 12.4
If D is a regular region in R2, then it can be shown that D can be
decomposed into a ﬁnite number of regions of the type shown in Figure
12.2. Of course, the regions will be facing various directions, but when
the integrations are performed, all those that occur twice along a straight
line segment will cancel each other. As a result, we have the following
theorem.

Vector Functions on RN; The Theorems of Green and Stokes
Deﬁnitions
Let D be a region in R2. A smooth surface element is the graph of a
system of equations of the form
(12.30)
x1  x1(s, t),
x2  x2(s, t),
x3  x3(s, t),
(s, t) ∈D ∪∂D
in which x1, x2, x3 are C1 functions with domain a region G in R2 containing
D ∪∂D. We suppose that D is a region whose boundary consists of a ﬁnite
number of piecewise smooth simple closed curves. In vector notation,
equations (12.30) may be written
v(−→

(s, t) ∈D ∪∂D,
O given.
Let σ be a smooth surface element given by
(12.31)
σ : v(−→
OQ)  r(s, t),
(s, t) ∈D ∪∂D,
with r and D satisfying the conditions stated in the deﬁnition of a smooth
surface element. If t is held constant, say equal to t0, then the graph of
(12.31) is a smooth curve on σ. Therefore, rs(s, t0), the partial derivative
of r with respect to s, is a vector tangent to this curve on the surface.
Similarly, the vector rt(s0, t) is tangent to the curve on σ obtained when
we set s  s0. The vectors rs(s0, t0) and rt(s0, t0) lie in the plane tangent
to the surface element σ at the point P0  r(s0, t0).
Deﬁnition
Let σ be a smooth surface element given by (12.31). We subdivide D into
a number of subregions D1, D2, . . . , Dn and deﬁne the mesh size ∥4∥as
the maximum diameter of all the Di. The area of the surface element
σ, denoted by A(σ), is deﬁned by the formula
A(σ)  lim

A(Di)|rs(si, ti) × rt(si, ti)|,
where A(Di) is the area of Di, and (si, ti) is any point of Di, and where
the limit exists in the same manner as that determined in the deﬁnition
of a deﬁnite integral. From this deﬁnition of area we obtain at once the
formula

When a surface σ is described by a single equation such as x3  f(x1, x2),
we say that σ is given in nonparametric form.
Unfortunately, most surfaces cannot be described in nonparametric
form; thus (12.33) cannot be used in general for the computation of sur-
face area. In fact, it can be shown that a simple surface such as a sphere
cannot be part of a single smooth surface element.
If S is a piecewise continuous surface, we can deﬁne area by decom-
position. First, if σ is a smooth surface element, a set F is a domain in
σ if and only if F is the image under (12.31) of a domain E in the plane
region D ∪∂D. The area of F is deﬁned by formula (12.32).
Deﬁnitions
Let S be a piecewise continuous surface. A set F contained in S is a do-
main if and only if F  F1 ∪F2 ∪. . . ∪Fk, where each Fi is a domain
contained in a single smooth surface element σi of S, and no two Fi have
common interior points. The area of F is deﬁned by the formula
A(F)  A(F1) + . . . + A(Fk).
We now discuss integration of a function f deﬁned on a surface F.
Suppose that F is a closed domain on a piecewise smooth surface. We
write F  F1 ∪F2 ∪. . . ∪Fk, where each Fi is a domain contained in one
smooth surface element. Then each Fi is the image of a domain Ei in R2,

The surface F is not a single smooth surface element, since the trans-

carried into the same points of F. The condition that the transformation
be one-to-one, necessary for a smooth surface element, is therefore vio-
lated. However, if we divide G into G1 and G2 as shown in Figure 12.8, the
image of each is a smooth surface element. The evaluation of the integral

The Stokes Theorem
Suppose that S is a smooth surface element represented parametrically
by
(12.39)
v(−→
OP)  r(s, t) with (s, t) ∈D ∪∂D,
where D is a region in the (s, t) plane with a piecewise smooth boundary
∂D. From the deﬁnition of a smooth surface element, we know that rs ×
rt ̸ 0 for (s, t) in a region G containing D ∪∂D.
Deﬁnition
For a smooth surface element S, the unit normal function to S is deﬁned
by the formula
n 
rs × rt
|rs × rt| ,
(s, t) ∈D.
Whenever S is a smooth surface element, the vector n is a continu-
ous function of s and t. Using Jacobian notation, n may be written in
coordinates:

It is a fact that the unit normal function is unique up to a change in
sign. That is, if n′ is another unit normal function for the same smooth
surface element, then either n′  n or n′  −n.

12.5.
The Stokes Theorem
245
Deﬁnitions
A smooth surface S is orientable if there exists a continuous unit normal
function deﬁned over all of S. Such a unit normal function is called an
orientation of S.
Since the unit normal function to S at a point P is either n(P) or −n(P),
each orientable surface possesses exactly two orientations, each of which
is the negative of the other. An oriented surface is the pair (S, n), where
n is one of the two orientations of S. We denote such an oriented surface by
−→
S . Suppose that F is a smooth surface element of the oriented surface −→
S .
The function n when restricted to F provides an orientation for F, so that
(F, n)  −→
F is an oriented surface element. We say that the orientation
of F agrees with the orientation of S if the parametric representations of
F and S yield unit normal functions on F that are identical.
If S is a smooth surface element represented parametrically by
v(−→
OP)  r(s, t),
(s, t) ∈D ∪∂D,
then the boundary ∂S is the image of ∂D. Since R2 is oriented, we say that
∂D is positively directed if it is oriented so that D is on the left as ∂D is
traversed. We write −→
∂D for this orientation and −−→
∂D when the boundary

Let −→
S be a smooth oriented surface in R3 with boundary −→
∂S and sup-
pose that r is a vector function deﬁned on S and ∂S. Stokes’s theorem is
a generalization to surfaces of Green’s theorem. We recall that Green’s
theorem establishes a relation between the integral of the derivative of
a function in a domain D in R2 and the integral of the same function
over ∂D (Theorem 12.13). The theorem of Stokes establishes an equality
between the integral of curl v · n over a surface −→
S and the integral of v
over the boundary of −→
S . The principal result is given in Theorem 12.15.
Let S be represented parametrically by
r(s, t)  x1(s, t)e1 + x2(s, t)e2 + x3(s, t)e3 for (s, t) ∈D,
where D is a bounded region in the (s, t)-plane. Then the positive unit

Suppose that v is a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on S and given in

Solution. S is a piecewise smooth surface, and we divide it into three
smooth surface elements as shown in Figure 12.9. The normal to S1 is
−e3, and therefore v · n  −x3 on S1. Since x3  0 on S1, the value of
(12.48) over S1 is 0. Since x3  x1 + 2 on S3, it follows that

The Divergence Theorem
Green’s theorem establishes a relation between the line integral of a
function over the boundary of a plane region and the double integral
of the derivative of the same function over the region itself. Stokes’s the-
orem extends this result to two-dimensional surfaces in three-space. In

12.
Vector Functions on RN; The Theorems of Green and Stokes
this section we establish another kind of generalization of the Funda-
mental theorem of calculus known as the Divergence theorem. This
theorem determines the relationship between an integral of the deriva-
tive of a function over a three-dimensional region in R3 and the integral
of the function itself over the boundary of that region. All three theorems
(Green, Stokes, Divergence) are special cases of a general formula that
connects an integral over a set of points in RN with another integral over
the boundary of that set of points. The integrand in the ﬁrst integral is a
certain derivative of the integrand in the boundary integral.
Let v  v1(x1, x2, x3)e1 + v2(x1, x2, x3)e2 + v3(x1, x2, x3)e3 be a vector
ﬁeld deﬁned for (x1, x2, x3) in a region E in R3. We recall that div v is a
scalar ﬁeld given in coordinates by the formula
div v  ∂v1
∂x1

∂x2

where ∂E is oriented by choosing n as the exterior normal to ∂E. We ﬁrst
establish (12.52) in several special cases and then show that the formula
holds generally, provided that the boundary of E is not too irregular and
that v is smooth.

The result of the lemma follows by inserting (12.57) into (12.58).
The Divergence theorem will now be established for a wide class of
regions that are called “regular.” Intuitively, a region in R3 is regular if its
boundary can be subdivided into small pieces in such a way that each
piece has a smooth representation of the form x3  f(x1, x2) if a suitable
Cartesian coordinate system is introduced.
Deﬁnition
A region E in R3 is regular if:
(i) ∂E consists of a ﬁnite number of smooth surfaces, each without
boundary;
(ii) at each point P of ∂E a Cartesian coordinate system is introduced
with P as origin. There is a cylindrical domain H  {(x1, x2, x3) :
(x1, x2) ∈D, −∞< x3 < ∞}, with D a region in the plane x3  0
containing the origin, that has the property that H ∩∂E is a surface
that can be represented in the form x3  f(x1, x2) for (x1, x2) ∈
D ∪∂D. Furthermore, f is smooth;
(iii) the set
H1  {(x1, x2, x3) : (x1, x2) ∈D, −c < x3 < f(x1, x2)}

12.6.
The Divergence Theorem
257
for some positive constant c (depending on P) is contained entirely
in E.
If E is a regular region, then each point P of ∂E is interior to a smooth
surface element except for those points on a ﬁnite number of arcs on ∂E
that have zero surface area. If a line in the direction of the unit normal to
∂E is drawn through a point P interior to a smooth surface element on ∂E,
then a segment of the line on one side of P will be in E, while a segment
on the other side will be exterior to E. Finally, we observe that n varies
continuously when P is in a smooth surface element of ∂E.
Theorem 12.16 (The Divergence theorem)
Suppose that E is a closed, bounded, regular region in R3 and that v is a
continuously differentiable vector ﬁeld on an open set G containing E ∪∂E.
Then

E
div vdV 

∂E
v · ndS,
where n is the unit normal function pointing outward from E.
Proof
With each point P ∈∂E associate a coordinate system and a cylindrical
domain H as in the deﬁnition of a regular region. Let HP be the bounded
portion of H such that −c < x3 < c (where c is the constant in the
deﬁnition of regular region; c depends on P). With each interior point
P of E, introduce a Cartesian coordinate system and a cube HP with P
as origin, with the sides of HP parallel to the axes and with ¯HP entirely
in E. Since E ∪∂E is compact, a ﬁnite number H1, H2, . . . , Hn cover E ∪
∂E. As described in the proof of Green’s theorem, the function v can be
decomposed into a ﬁnite number of functions vi, i  1, 2, . . . , n, such
that each vi is continuously differentiable on G and vanishes on G −Fi.
Also, v  n
i1 vi. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient to establish the result for
each vi. Suppose ﬁrst that Pi is an interior point of E. Then ¯Hi ⊂E, and
vi vanishes on ∂Hi. Hence

E
div vidV 

Hi
div vidV  0
because of Lemma 12.6. Also, because vi  0 on ∂E, we have

∂E
vi · ndS  0.
Thus the result is established for all such Hi. Suppose now that Pi ∈∂E.
Deﬁne Ei  Hi ∩E. Then vi  0 on the three sets (i) E −Ei; (ii) ∂E −γi,
where γi  ∂E ∩Hi; (iii) ∂Ei −γi. Now, since Ei is a region of the type
