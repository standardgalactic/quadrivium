GALOIS GROUPS
     In the early 19th - century, Abel proved that it is not possible to solve the
general polynomial equation of degree greater than four by algebraic means.
He attempted to characterize all equations that can be solved by radicals.
Abel did not solve this fundamental problem.  The problem was taken up and
solved by one of the greatest innovators in Mathematics, namely, Galois.
2.1. Solving cubic equations
The main ideas of the Galois procedure in the Theory of Equations,
and their relationship to later developments in Mathematics and Physics, can
be introduced in a plausible way by considering the standard problem of
solving a cubic equation.
Consider solutions of the general cubic equation
Ax3 + 3Bx2 + 3Cx + D = 0, where A − D are rational constants.

5
If the substitution y = Ax + B is made, the equation becomes
             y3 + 3Hy + G = 0
where
   H = AC − B2 
and
   G = A2D − 3ABC + 2B3.
The cubic has three real roots if G2 + 4H3 < 0 and two imaginary roots if G2
+ 4H3 > 0.  (See any standard work on the Theory of Equations).
If all the roots are real, a trigonometrical method can be used to obtain
the solutions, as follows:
the Fourier series of cos3u is
       cos3u = (3/4)cosu + (1/4)cos3u.
Putting
    y = scosu in the equation y3 + 3Hy + G = 0
(s > 0),
gives
    cos3u + (3H/s2)cosu + G/s3 = 0.
Comparing the Fourier series with this equation leads to
    s = 2 √(−H)
and
       cos3u = −4G/s3.
If v is any value of u satisfying cos3u = −4G/s3, the general solution is

6
            3u = 2nπ ± 3v, where n is an integer.
Three different values of cosu are given by
     u = v, and 2π/3 ± v.
The three solutions of the given cubic equation are then
     scosv, and scos(2π/3 ± v).
Consider solutions of the equation
          x3 − 3x + 1 = 0.
In this case,
       H = −1 and G2 + 4H3 = −3.
All the roots are therefore real, and they are given by solving
  cos3u = −4G/s3 = −4(1/8) = −1/2
or,
                         3u = cos-1(−1/2).
The values of u are therefore 2π/9, 4π/9, and 8π/9, and the roots are
   x1 = 2cos(2π/9), x2 = 2cos(4π/9), and x3 = 2cos(8π/9).
2.2. Symmetries of the roots
The roots x1, x2, and x3 exhibit a simple pattern.  Relationships among
them can be readily found by writing them in the complex form 2cosθ = eiθ +
e-iθ where θ = 2π/9 so that
   x1 = eiθ + e-iθ ,
   x2 = e2iθ + e-2iθ ,

7
and
   x3 = e4iθ + e-4iθ .
Squaring these values gives
           x1
2 = x2 + 2,
           x2
2 = x3 + 2,
and
           x3
2 = x1 + 2.
The relationships among the roots have the functional form f(x1,x2,x3) = 0.
Other relationships exist; for example, by considering the sum of the roots we
find
  x1 + x2
2 + x2 − 2 = 0
  x2 + x3
2 + x3 − 2 = 0,
and
  x3 + x1
2 + x1 − 2 = 0.
Transformations from one root to another can be made by doubling-the-
angle, .
The functional relationships among the roots have an algebraic
symmetry associated with them under interchanges (substitutions) of the
roots.  If  is the operator that changes f(x1,x2,x3) into f(x2,x3,x1) then
      
f(x1,x2,x3) → f(x2,x3,x1),
     
2f(x1,x2,x3) → f(x3,x1,x2),
and

8
     
3f(x1,x2,x3) → f(x1,x2,x3).
The operator 
3 = I, is the identity.
In the present case,
   
(x1
2 − x2 − 2) = (x2
2 − x3 − 2) = 0,
and
  
2(x1
2 − x2 − 2) = (x3
2 − x1 − 2) = 0.
2.3. The Galois group of an equation.
The set of operators {I, 
, 
2} introduced above, is called the Galois
group of the equation x3 − 3x + 1 = 0. (It will be shown later that it is
isomorphic to the cyclic group, C3).
The elements of a Galois group are operators that interchange the
roots of an equation in such a way that the transformed functional
relationships are true relationships.  For example, if the equation
 x1 + x2
2 + x2 − 2 = 0
is valid, then so is
 
    
(x1 + x2
2 + x2 − 2 ) = x2 + x3
2 + x3 − 2 = 0.
True functional relationships are polynomials with rational coefficients.
2.4. Algebraic fields
We now consider the Galois procedure in a more general way.  An
algebraic solution of the general nth - degree polynomial
     aoxn + a1xn-1 + ... an = 0
is given in terms of the coefficients ai using a finite number of operations (+,-
,×,÷,√).  The term "solution by radicals" is sometimes used because the

9
operation of extracting a square root is included in the process.  If an infinite
number of operations is allowed, solutions of the general polynomial can be
obtained using transcendental functions.  The coefficients ai necessarily belong
to a field which is closed under the rational operations.  If the field is the set
of rational numbers, Q, we need to know whether or not the solutions of a
given equation belong to Q.  For example, if
      x2 − 3 = 0
we see that the coefficient -3 belongs to Q, whereas the roots of the equation,
xi = ± √3, do not.  It is therefore necessary to extend Q to Q', (say) by
adjoining numbers of the form a√3 to Q, where a is in Q.
In discussing the cubic equation x3 − 3x + 1 = 0 in 2.2, we found
certain functions of the roots f(x1,x2,x3) = 0 that are symmetric under
permutations of the roots.  The symmetry operators formed the Galois group
of the equation.
For a general polynomial:
       xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + .. an = 0,
functional relations of the roots are given in terms of the coefficients in the
standard way
     x1 + x2 + x3 ..                   ..   + xn         = −a1
     x1x2 + x1x3 + .. x2x3 + x2x4 + ..+ xn-1xn     =  a2
     x1x2x3 + x2x3x4 + ..             .. + xn-2xn-1xn = −a3
     .     .

10
     x1x2x3 ..                                   .. xn-1xn  =  ±an.
Other symmetric functions of the roots can be written in terms of these
basic symmetric polynomials and, therefore, in terms of the coefficients.
Rational symmetric functions also can be constructed that involve the roots
and the coefficients of a given equation.  For example, consider the quartic
     x4 + a2x2 + a4 = 0.
The roots of this equation satisfy the equations
                   x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0
                   x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 + x2x4 + x3x4 = a2
                   x1x2x3 + x1x2x4 + x1x3x4 + x2x3x4 = 0
                   x1x2x3x4 = a4.
We can form any rational symmetric expression from these basic
equations (for example, (3a4
3 − 2a2)/2a4
2 = f(x1,x2,x3,x4)).  In general, every
rational symmetric function that belongs to the field F of the coefficients, ai, of
a general polynomial equation can be written rationally in terms of the
coefficients.
The Galois group, Ga, of an equation associated with a field F therefore
has the property that if a rational function of the roots of the equation is
invariant under all permutations of Ga, then it is equal to a quantity in F.
Whether or not an algebraic equation can be broken down into simpler
equations is important in the theory of equations.  Consider, for example, the
equation
                     x6 = 3.

11
It can be solved by writing x3 = y, y2 = 3 or
     x = (√3)1/3.
To solve the equation, it is necessary to calculate square and cube roots
 not sixth roots.  The equation x6 = 3 is said to be compound (it can be
broken down into simpler equations), whereas x2 = 3 is said to be atomic.
The atomic properties of the Galois group of an equation reveal
the atomic nature of the equation, itself.  (In Chapter 5, it will be seen that a
group is atomic ("simple") if it contains no proper invariant subgroups).
The determination of the Galois groups associated with an arbitrary
polynomial with unknown roots is far from straightforward.  We can gain
some insight into the Galois method, however, by studying the group
structure of the quartic
              x4 + a2x2 + a4 = 0
with known roots
         x1 = ((−a2 + µ)/2)1/2 , x2 = −x1,
          x3 = ((−a2 − µ)/2)1/2 , x4 = −x3,
where
 
                      µ = (a 2
2 − 4a4)1/2.
The field F of the quartic equation contains the rationals Q, and the
rational expressions formed from the coefficients a2 and a4.
The relations
         x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = 0

12
are in the field F.
Only eight of the 4! possible permutations of the roots leave these
relations invariant in F; they are
            x1 x2 x3 x4            x1 x2 x3 x4           x1 x2 x3 x4  
{ P1 =                     ,  P2 =                    , P3  =                     ,
            x1 x2 x3 x4            x1 x2 x4 x3           x2 x1 x3 x4  
            x1 x2 x3 x4           x1 x2 x3 x4            x1 x2 x3 x4  
   P4 =                      , P5 =                     , P6 =                      ,
            x2 x1 x4 x3            x3 x4 x1 x2           x3 x4 x2 x1 
            x1 x2 x3 x4           x1 x2 x3 x4   
   P7 =                      , P8  =                   }.
            x4 x3 x1 x2           x4 x3 x2 x1  
The set {P1,...P8} is the Galois group of the quartic in F.  It is a subgroup of
the full set of twentyfour permutations.  We can form an infinite number of
true relations among the roots in F.  If we extend the field F by adjoining
irrational expressions of the coefficients, other true relations among the roots
can be formed in the extended field, F'.  Consider, for example, the extended
field formed by adjoining µ (= (a2
2 − 4a4)) to F so that the relation
             x1
2 − x3
2 = µ is in F'.
We have met the relations
                    x1  = −x2  and x3  = −x4
so that
                    x1
2 =  x2
2 and x3
2 =  x4
2.
Another relation in F' is therefore
             x2
2 − x4
2 = µ.
The permutations that leave these relations true in F' are then

13
    {P1, P2, P3, P4}.
This set is the Galois group of the quartic in F'.  It is a subgroup of the set
{P1,...P8}.
If we extend the field F' by adjoining the irrational expression           
((−a2 − µ)/2)1/2 to form the field F'' then the relation
               x3 − x4 = 2((−a2 − µ)/2)1/2 is in F''.
This relation is invariant under the two permutations
   {P1, P3}.
This set is the Galois group of the quartic in F''.  It is a subgroup of the set
{P1, P2, P3, P4}.
If, finally, we extend the field F'' by adjoining the irrational           
((−a2 + µ)/2)1/2 to form the field F''' then the relation
 
                 x1 − x2 = 2((−a2 − µ)/2)1/2 is in F'''.
This relation is invariant under the identity transformation, P1 , alone; it is
the Galois group of the quartic in F''.  
The full group, and the subgroups, associated with the quartic equation
are of order 24, 8, 4, 2, and 1.  (The order of a group is the number of
distinct elements that it contains).  In 5.4, we shall prove that the order of a
subgroup is always an integral divisor of the order of the full group.  The
order of the full group divided by the order of a subgroup is called the index
of the subgroup.
Galois introduced the idea of a normal or invariant subgroup: if H is a
normal subgroup of G then

14
        HG − GH = [H,G] = 0.
(H commutes with every element of G, see 5.5).
Normal subgroups are also called either invariant or self-conjugate subgroups.
A normal subgroup H is maximal if no other subgroup of G contains H.
2.5. Solvability of polynomial equations
Galois defined the group of a given polynomial equation to be either
the symmetric group, Sn, or a subgroup of Sn, (see 5.6).  The Galois method
therefore involves the following steps:
1.  The determination of the Galois group, Ga, of the equation.
2.  The choice of a maximal subgroup of Hmax(1).  In the above case, {P1, ...P8}
is a maximal subgroup of Ga = S4.
3.  The choice of a maximal subgroup of Hmax(1) from step 2.
In the above case, {P1,..P4} = Hmax(2) is a maximal subgroup of Hmax(1).
The process is continued until Hmax = {P1} = {I}.
The groups Ga, Hmax(1), ..,Hmax(k) = I, form a composition series.  The
composition indices are given by the ratios of the successive orders of the
groups:
   gn/h(1), h(1)/h(2), ...h(k-1)/1.
The composition indices of the symmetric groups Sn for n = 2 to 7 are found
to be:
      n   Composition Indices
      2   2

15
      3   2, 3
      4   2, 3, 2, 2
      5   2, 60
      6   2, 360
      7   2, 2520
We shall state, without proof, Galois' theorem:
A polynomial equation can be solved algebraically if and only if its
group is solvable.
Galois defined a solvable group as one in which the composition indices are
all prime numbers.  Furthermore, he showed that if n > 4, the sequence of
maximal normal subgroups is Sn, An, I, where An is the Alternating Group
with (n!)/2 elements.  The composition indices are then 2 and (n!)/2.  For n >
4, however, (n!)/2 is not prime, therefore the groups Sn are not solvable for n
> 4.  Using Galois' Theorem, we see that it is therefore not possible to solve,
algebraically, a general polynomial equation of degree n > 4.

SOME ALGEBRAIC INVARIANTS
     Although algebraic invariants first appeared in the works of Lagrange and
Gauss in connection with the Theory of Numbers, the study of algebraic
invariants as an independent branch of Mathematics did not begin until the
work of Boole in 1841.  Before discussing this work, it will be convenient to
introduce matrix versions of real bilinear forms, B, defined by

16
                               B = ∑i=1
m ∑j=1
n aijxiyj 
where
                               x = [x1,x2,...xm], an m-vector,
                               y = [y1,y2,...yn], an n-vector,
and aij are real coefficients.  The square brackets denote a
column vector.
In matrix notation, the bilinear form is
                               B = xTAy
where
                                        a11 .   .   .  a1n  
                                         .   .   .   .         
                              A =     .   .   .   .      .

The scalar product of two n-vectors is seen to be a special case of a
bilinear form in which A = I.
If x = y, the bilinear form becomes a quadratic form, Q:
                               Q = xTAx.
3.1. Invariants of binary quadratic forms
Boole began by considering the properties of the binary
quadratic form
              Q(x,y) = ax2 + 2hxy + by2
under a linear transformation of the coordinates

17
                     x' = Mx
where
              x  = [x,y],
              x' = [x',y'],
and
                               i   j  
             M  =           .
                      k  l 
The matrix M transforms an orthogonal coordinate system into an
oblique coordinate system in which the new x'- axis has a slope (k/i), and the
new y'- axis has a slope (l/j), as shown:
       y

The transformation of a unit square under M.

18
The transformation is linear, therefore the new function Q'(x',y') is a
binary quadratic:
                     Q'(x',y') = a'x'2 + 2h'x'y' + b'y'2.
The original function can be written
               Q(x,y) = xTDx
where
                                        a  h  
                      D =           ,
                                        h  b  
and the determinant of D is
                  detD = ab − h2, called the discriminant of Q.
The transformed function can be written
                     Q'(x',y') = x'TD'x'
where
                                       a' h'
                     D' =           ,
                                       h' b'
and
                 detD' = a'b' − h'2, the discriminant of Q'.
Now,
                      Q'(x',y') = (Mx)TD'Mx
                = xTMTD'Mx
and this is equal to Q(x,y) if
                      MTD'M = D.

19
The invariance of the form Q(x,y) under the coordinate transformation M
therefore leads to the relation
               (detM)2detD' = detD
because
                detMT = detM.
The explicit form of this equation involving determinants is
          (il − jk)2(a'b' − h'2) = (ab − h2).
The discriminant (ab - h2) of Q is said to be an invariant
of the transformation because it is equal to the discriminant (a'b' − h'2) of Q',
apart from a factor (il − jk)2 that depends on the transformation itself, and not
on the arguments a,b,h of the function Q.
3.2. General algebraic invariants
The study of general algebraic invariants is an important branch of
Mathematics.
A binary form in two variables is
              f(x1,x2) = aox1
n + a1x1
n-1x2 + ...anx2
n
                        = ∑ aix1
n-ix2
i
If there are three or four variables, we speak of ternary forms or quaternary
forms.
A binary form is transformed under the linear transformation M as
follows
    f(x1,x2) => f'(x1',x2') = ao'x1'n + a1'x1'n-1x2' + ..
The coefficients

20
                    ao, a1, a2,..≠  ao', a1', a2' ..
and the roots of the equation
                       f(x1,x2) = 0
differ from the roots of the equation
                    f'(x1',x2') = 0.
Any function I(ao,a1,...an) of the coefficients of f that satisfies
           rwI(ao',a1',...an') = I(ao,a1,...an)
is said to be an invariant of f if the quantity r depends only on the
transformation matrix M, and not on the coefficients ai of the function being
transformed.  The degree of the invariant is the degree of the coefficients, and
the exponent w is called the weight.  In the example discussed above, the
degree is two, and the weight is two.
Any function, C, of the coefficients and the variables of a form f that is
invariant under the transformation M, except for a multiplicative factor that is
a power of the discriminant of M, is said to be a covariant of f.  For binary
forms, C therefore satisfies
 rwC(ao',a1',...an'; x1',x2') = C(ao,a1,...an; x1,x2).
It is found that the Jacobian of two binary quadratic forms, f(x1,x2) and
g(x1,x2), namely the determinant
                          ∂f/∂x1  ∂f/∂x2     
                                
                          ∂g/∂x1  ∂g/∂x2    
where ∂f/∂x1 is the partial derivative of f with respect to x1 etc., is a
simultaneous covariant of weight one of the two forms.

21
The determinant
                    ∂2f/∂x1
2    ∂2f/∂x1∂x2    
                                                  ,
                    ∂2g/∂x2∂x1  ∂2g/∂x2
2      
called the Hessian of the binary form f, is found to be a covariant of weight
two.  A full discussion of the general problem of algebraic invariants is outside
the scope of this book.  The following example will, however, illustrate the
method of finding an invariant in a particular case.
Example:
To show that
  (aoa2 − a1
2)(a1a3 − a2
2) − (aoa3 − a1a2)2/4
is an invariant of the binary cubic
  f(x,y) = aox3 + 3a1x2y + 3a2xy2 + a3y3
under a linear transformation of the coordinates.
The cubic may be written
          f(x,y) = (aox2+2a1xy+a2y2)x + (a1x2+2a2xy+a3y2)y
                   = xTDx
where
                x = [x,y],
and
                       aox + a1y  a1x + a2y    
              D =                                .
                       a1x + a2y  a2x + a3y     

22
Let x be transformed to x': x' = Mx, where
                        i  j   
               M =          
                        k  l   
then
          f(x,y) = f'(x',y')
if
               D = MTD'M.
Taking determinants, we obtain
           detD = (detM)2detD',
an invariant of f(x,y) under the transformation M.
In this case, D is a function of x and y.  To emphasize this point, put
           detD = φ(x,y)
and
           detD'= φ'(x',y')
so that
         φ(x,y) = (detM)2φ'(x',y'
                   = (aox + a1y)(a2x + a3y) − (a1x + a2y)2
                   = (aoa2 − a1
2)x2 + (aoa3 − a1a2)xy + (a1a3 − a2
2)y2
                   = xTEx,
where

23
                       (aoa2 − a1
2 )      (aoa3 − a1a2)/2    
               E =                                            .
                       (aoa3 − a1a2)/2    (a1a3 − a2
2 )      
Also, we have
      φ'(x',y') = x'TE'x'
                   = xTMTE'Mx
therefore
           xTEx = (detM)2xTMTE'Mx
so that
                E = (detM)2MTE'M.
Taking determinants, we obtain
            detE = (detM)4detE'
                   = (aoa2 − a1
2)(a1a3 − a2
2) − (aoa3 − a1a2)2/4  
                   = invariant of the binary cubic f(x,y) under the transformation
x' = Mx.

GROUPS — CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT
5.1  Some concrete examples
The elements of the set {±1, ±i}, where i = √−1, are the roots of the
equation x4 = 1, the “fourth roots of unity”.  They have the following special
properties:
1.  The product of any two elements of the set (including the same two
elements) is always an element of the set.  (The elements obey closure).
2.  The order of combining pairs in the triple product of any elements
of the set does not matter.  (The elements obey associativity).
3.  A unique element of the set exists such that the product of any
element of the set and the unique element (called the identity) is equal to the
element itself.  (An identity element exists).

38
4.  For each element of the set, a corresponding element exists such
that the product of the element and its corresponding element (called the
inverse) is equal to the identity.  (An inverse element exists).
The set of elements {±1, ±i} with these four properties is said to form
a GROUP.
In this example, the law of composition of the group is multiplication; this
need not be the case.  For example, the set of integers Z = {.., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2,
...} forms a group if the law of composition is addition.  In this group, the
identity element is zero, and the inverse of each integer is the integer with the
same magnitude but with opposite sign.  
In a different vein, we consider the set of 4×4 matrices:
                     1 0 0 0      0 0 0 1      0 0 1 0     0 1 0 0
       {M} =    0 1 0 0   ,  1 0 0 0   ,    0 0 0 1 ,  0 0 1 0 .
                     0 0 1 0      0 1 0 0      1 0 0 0     0 0 0 1
                     0 0 0 1      0 0 1 0      0 1 0 0     1 0 0 0  
If the law of composition is matrix multiplication , then {M} is found to obey:
1 --closure
and
2 --associativity,
and to contain:
3 --an identity, diag(1, 1, 1, 1),
and
4 --inverses.
The set {M} forms a group under matrix multilication.

39
5.2. Abstract groups
The examples given above illustrate the generality of the group
concept.  In the first example, the group elements are real and imaginary
numbers, in the second, they are positive and negative integers, and in the
third, they are matrices that represent linear operators (see later discussion).
Cayley, in the mid-19th century, first emphasized this generality, and he
introduced the concept of an abstract group, Gn which is a collection of n
distinct elements (...gi...) for which a law of composition is given.  If n is finite,
the group is said to be a group of order n.  The collection of elements must
obey the four rules:
1.  If gi, gj ∈ G then gn = gj•gi ∈ G ∀ gi, gj ∈ G (closure)
2.  gk(gjgi) = (gkgj)gi [leaving out the composition symbol•] (associativity)
3.  ∃ e ∈ G such that gie = egi = gi ∀ gi ∈ G (an identity exists)
4.  If gi ∈ G then ∃ gi
-1 ∈ G such that gi
-1gi = gigi
-1 = e (an inverse exists).
For finite groups, the group structure is given by listing all
compositions of pairs of elements in a group table, as follows:
             e  .  gi    gj   .  ←(1st symbol, or operation, in pair)
         e      .  .      .   .
         .       .  .      .   .
        gi .    . gigi  gigj  .
        gj      . gjgi  gjgj  .
        gk     . gkgi  gkgj  .
        .
        .

40
If gjgi = gigj ∀ gi, gj ∈ G, then G is said to be a commutative or abelian
group.  The group table of an abelian group is symmetric under reflection in
the diagonal.
A group of elements that has the same structure as an abstract group is
a realization of the group.
5.3 The dihedral group, D3
The set of operations that leaves an equilateral triangle invariant under
rotations in the plane about its center, and under reflections in the three
planes through the vertices, perpendicular to the opposite sides, forms a
group of six elements.  A study of the structure of this group (called the
dihedral group, D3) illustrates the typical group-theoretical approach.
The geometric operations that leave the triangle invariant are:
Rotations about the z-axis (anticlockwise rotations are positive)
Rz(0)     (123) → (123) = e, the identity
Rz(2π/3)(123) → (312)  = a
Rz(4π/3)(123) → (231)  = a2
and reflections in the planes I, II, and III:
         RI (123) → (123) = b
        RII (123) → (321) = c
       RIII (123) → (213) = d
This set of operators is D3 = {e, a, a2, b, c, d}.
Positive rotations are in an anticlockwise sense and the inverse rotations are in
a clockwise sense., so that the inverse of e, a, a2 are

41
e-1 = e, a-1 = a2, and (a2)-1 = a.
The inverses of the reflection operators are the operators themselves:
b-1 = b, c-1 = c, and d-1 = d.
We therefore see that the set D3 forms a group.  The group
multiplication table is:
e  a  a2  b  c  d  
    e    e  a  a2  b  c  d  
    a    a  a2  e  d  b  c
    a2    a2  e  a  c  d  b
    b    b  c  d  e  a  a2
    c    c  d  b  a2  e  a
    d    d  b  c  a  a2  e
In reading the table, we follow the rule that the first operation is written on
the right: for example, ca2 = b.  A feature of the group D3 is that it can be
subdivided into sets of either rotations involving {e, a, a2} or reflections
involving {b, c, d}.  The set {e, a, a2} forms a group called the cyclic group
of order three, C3.  A group is cyclic if all the elements of the group are
powers of a single element.  The cyclic group of order n, Cn, is
 Cn = {e, a, a2, a3, .....,an-1},
where n is the smallest integer such that an = e, the identity.  Since
       akan-k = an = e,
an inverse an-k exists.  All cyclic groups are abelian.
The group D3 can be broken down into a part that is a group C3, and a
part that is the product of one of the remaining elements and the elements of
C3.  For example, we can write

42
D3 = C3 + bC3 , b ∉ C3
              = {e, a, a2} + {b, ba, ba2}
     = {e, a, a2} + {b, c, d}
     = cC3 = dC3.
This decomposition is a special case of an important theorem known as
Lagrange’s theorem.  (Lagrange had considered permutations of roots of
equations before Cauchy and Galois).
5.4  Lagrange’s theorem
The order m of a subgroup Hm of a finite group Gn of order n is a
factor (an integral divisor) of n.

Gn = {g1=e, g2, g3, ...gn} be a group of order n, and let
Hm = {h1=e, h2, h3, ...hm} be a subgroup of Gn of order m.
If we take any element gk of Gn which is not in Hm, we can form the set of
elements
{gkh1, gkh2, gkh3, ...gkhm} ≡ gkHm.
This is called the left coset of Hm with respect to gk.  We note the important
facts that all the elements of gkhj, j=1 to m are distinct, and that none of the
elements gkhj belongs to Hm.
Every element gk that belongs to Gn but does not belong to Hm
belongs to some coset gkHm  so that Gn forms the union of Hm and a number

43
of distinct (non-overlapping) cosets.  (There are (n − m) such distinct cosets).
Each coset has m different elements and therefore the order n of Gn is
divisible by m, hence n = Km, where the integer K is called the index of the
subgroup Hm under the group Gn. We therefore write
Gn = g1Hm + gj2Hm + gk3Hm + ....gνKHm
where
gj2 ∈ Gn ∉ Hm,
gk3 ∈ Gn ∉ Hm, gj2Hm
.
gnK ∈ Gn ∉ Hm, gj2Hm, gk3Hm, ...gn-1, K-1Hm.
The subscripts 2, 3, 4, ..K are the indices of the group.
As an example, consider the permutations of three objects 1, 2, 3 ( the
group S3) and let Hm = C3 = {123, 312, 231}, the cyclic group of order
three.  The elements of S3 that are not in H3 are {132, 213, 321}.  Choosing
gk = 132, we obtain
     gkH3 = {132, 321, 213},
and therefore
         S3 = C3 + gk2C3 ,K = 2.
This is the result obtained in the decomposition of the group D3 , if we make
the substitutions e = 123, a = 312, a2 = 231, b = 132, c = 321, and d = 213.

44
The groups D3 and S3 are said to be isomorphic.  Isomorphic groups have
the same group multiplication table.  Isomorphism is a special case of
homomorphism that involves a many-to-one correspondence.
5.5 Conjugate classes and invariant subgroups
If there exists an element v ∈ Gn such that two elements a, b ∈ Gn are
related by vav-1 = b, then b is said to be conjugate to a.  A finite group can
be separated into sets that are conjugate to each other.
The class of Gn is defined as the set of conjugates of an element a ∈
Gn.  The element itself belongs to this set.  If a is conjugate to b, the class
conjugate to a and the class conjugate to b are the same.  If a is not conjugate
to b, these classes have no common elements.  Gn can be decomposed into
classes because each element of Gn belongs to a class.
An element of Gn that commutes with all elements of Gn forms a class
by itself.  
The elements of an abelian group are such that
        bab-1 = a for all a, b ∈ Gn,
so that
           ba = ab.
If Hm is a subgroup of Gn, we can form the set
{aea-1, ah2a-1, ....ahma-1} = aHma-1 where a ∈ Gn .

45
Now, aHma-1 is another subgroup of Hm in Gn.  Different subgroups may be
found by choosing different elements a of Gn.  If, for all values of a ∈ Gn
      aHma-1 = Hm
(all conjugate subgroups of Hm in Gn are identical to Hm),
then Hm is said to be an invariant subgroup in Gn.
Alternatively, Hm is an invariant in Gn if the left- and right-cosets
formed with any a ∈ Gn are equal, i. e. ahi = hka.
An invariant subgroup Hm of Gn commutes with all elements of Gn.
Furthermore, if hi ∈ Hm then all elements ahia-1 ∈ Hm so that Hm is an
invariant subgroup of Gn if it contains elements of Gn in complete classes.
Every group Gn contains two trivial invariant subgroups, Hm = Gn and
Hm = e.  A group with no proper (non-trivail) invariant subgroups is said to
be simple (atomic).  If none of the proper invariant subgroups of a group is
abelian, the group is said to be semisimple.
An invariant subgroup Hm and its cosets form a group under
multiplication called the factor group (written Gn/Hm) of Hm in Gn.
These formal aspects of Group Theory can be illustrated by considering
the following example:

46
The group D3 = {e, a, a2, b, c, d} ~ S3 = {123, 312, 231, 132, 321, 213}.  
C3 is a subgroup of S3: C3 = H3 = {e, a, a2} = {123, 312, 231}.
Now,
   bH3 = {132, 321, 213} = H3b
   cH3 = {321, 213, 132} = H3c
and
    dH3 = {213,132, 321} = H3d.
Since H3 is a proper invariant subgroup of S3, we see that S3 is not simple.
H3 is abelian therefore S3 is not semisimple.
The decomposition of S3 is
  S3 = H3 + bH3 = H3 + H3b.
and, in this case we have
         H3b = H3c = H3d.
(Since the index of H3 is 2, H3 must be invariant).
The conjugate classes are
   e = e
        eae-1 = ea = a
        aaa-1 = ae = a
  a2a(a2)-1   = a2a2 = a
       bab-1 = bab = a2
        cac-1 = cac = a2
       dad-1 = dad = a2

47
The class conjugate to a is therefore {a, a2}.
The class conjugate to b is found to be {b, c, d}.  The group S3 can be
decomposed by classes:
    S3 = {e} + {a, a2} + {b, c, d}.
S3 contains three conjugate classes.
  If we now consider Hm = {e, b} an abelian subgroup, we find
 aHm = {a,d}, Hma = {a.c},
a2Hm = {a2,c}, Hma2 = {a2, d}, etc.
All left and right cosets are not equal: Hm = {e, b} is therefore not an
invariant subgroup of S3. We can therefore write
   S3 = {e, b} + {a, d} + {a2, c}
         = Hm    +  aHm    + a2Hm.
Applying Lagrange’s theorem to S3 gives the orders of the possible
subgroups: they are
order 1: {e}
order 2: {e, d}; {e, c}: {e, d}
order 3: {e, a, a2} (abelian and invariant)
order 6: S3.
5.6 Permutations
A permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, ....,n} of n distinct elements is an
ordered arrangement of the n elements.  If the order is changed then the

48
permutation is changed.  The number of permutations of n distinct elements is
n!
We begin with a familiar example: the permutations of three distinct
objects labelled 1, 2, 3.  There are six possible arrangements; they are
123, 312, 231, 132, 321, 213.
These arrangements can be written conveniently in matrix form:
                   1 2 3             1 2 3               1 2 3     
π1 =              , π2 =              , π3 =                 ,
                   1 2 3             3 1 2               2 3 1     
                   1 2 3             1 2 3               1 2 3     
π4 =              , π5 =              , π6  =               .
                   1 3 2             3 2 1               2 1 3     
The product of two permutations is the result of performing one arrangement
after another.  We then find
π2π3 = π1
and
π3π2 = π1
whereas
π4π5 = π3
and
π5π4 = π2.
The permutations π1, π2, π3 commute in pairs (they correspond to the
rotations of the dihedral group) whereas the permutations do not commute
(they correspond to the reflections).
A general product of permutations can be written

49
  s1  s2 .  .  .sn    1  2  .  .  n          1  2   .  .  n
     =                     .
  t1  t2 .  .  .tn    s1  s2 .  .  sn          t1  t2  .  .  tn   
The permutations are found to have the following properties:
1.  The product of two permutations of the set {1, 2, 3, ...} is itself a
permutation of the set.  (Closure)
2.  The product obeys associativity:
(πkπj)πi = πk(πjπi), (not generally commutative).
3.  An identity permutation exists.
4.  An inverse permutation exists:
                    s1  s2  .  .  .  sn                 
π-1 =                          
                    1   2  .  .  .  n           
such that ππ-1 = π-1π = identity permutation.
The set of permutations therefore forms a group
5.7 Cayley’s theorem:
Every finite group is isomorphic to a certain permutation group.
Let Gn ={g1, g2, g3,  .  .  .gn} be a finite group of order n.  We choose any
element gi in Gn, and we form the products that belong to Gn:
gig1, gig2, gig3,  .  .  . gign.
These products are the n-elements of Gn rearranged.  The permutation πi,
associated with gi is therefore
                          g1        g2        .         .         gn 
              πi =                                                     .
                          gig1     gig2       .        .        gign  
If the permutation πj associated with gj is

50
                          g1        g2         .         .         gn    
              πj =                                                        ,
                         gjg1      gjg2        .         .       gjgn   
where gi ≠ gj, then
                          g1         g2         .        .        gn       
            πjπi  =                                                            .  
                        (gjgi)gi  (gjgi)g2    .        .      (gjgi)gn   
This is the permutation that corresponds to the element gjgi of Gn.
There is a direct correspondence between the elements of Gn and the n-
permutations {π1, π2, .  .  .πn}.  The group of permutations is a subgroup of
the full symmetric group of order n! that contains all the permutations of the
elements g1, g2, .  .  gn.
Cayley’s theorem is important not only in the theory of finite groups
but also in those quantum systems in which the indistinguishability of the
fundamental particles means that certain quantities must be invariant under
the exchange or permutation of the particles.

LIE’S DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION, INFINITESIMAL ROTATIONS
AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM OPERATORS
Although the field of continuous transformation groups (Lie groups)
has its origin in the theory of differential equations, we shall introduce the
subject using geometrical ideas.

51
6.1 Coordinate and vector rotations
A 3-vector v = [vx, vy, vz] transforms into v´ = [vx´, vy´, vz´] under a
general coordinate rotation R about the origin of an orthogonal coordinate
system as follows:
           v´ = R v,
where
                     i.i´    j.i´    k.i´     
           R =   i.j´    j.j´    k.j´    
                                                i.k´   j.k´   k.k´    
                                                 cosθii´   .       .            
 
                =    cosθij´   .       .            
                                                 cosθik´  .   cosθkk´      
where i, j, k, i´, j´, k´ are orthogonal unit vectors, along the axes, before and
after the transformation, and the cosθii´’s are direction cosines.
The simplest case involves rotations in the x-y plane:
             vx´      =      cosθii´   cosθji  vx
              vy´              cosθij´   cosθjj´      vy       
     =      cosφ     sinφ      vx    = Rc(φ)v
                  
            −sinφ     cosφ      vy  
where Rc(φ) is the coordinate rotation operator.  If the vector is rotated in a
fixed coordinate system, we have φ → −φ so that

52
 
                 v´ = Rv(φ)v,
where
                 Rv(φ)    =   cosφ  −sinφ  .
                                   sinφ    cosφ  
6.2  Lie’s differential equation
The main features of Lie’s Theory of Continuous Transformation
Groups can best be introduced by discussing the properties of the rotation
operator Rv(φ) when the angle of rotation is an infinitesimal.  In general,
Rv(φ) transforms a point P[x, y] in the plane into a “new” point P´[x´, y´]:
P´ = Rv(φ)P.  Let the angle of rotation be sufficiently small for us to put
cos(φ) ≅ 1 and sin(φ) ≅ δφ, in which case, we have
 Rv(δφ) =       1   −δφ   
                    δφ     1    
and
 x´ = x.1 − yδφ = x − yδφ     
 y´ = xδφ + y.1 = xδφ + y   
Let the corresponding changes x → x´ and y → y´ be written
x´ = x + δx and y´ = y +δy
so that
δx = −yδφ and δy = xδφ.
We note that
  Rv(δφ) =      1   0      +      0  −1  δφ
            0   1              1    0    

53
    = I  + iδφ
where
  i =  0   −1   = Rv(π/2).
         1     0   
Lie introduced another important way to interpret the 
operator           
i = Rv(π/2), that involves the derivative of Rv(φ) evaluated at the identity
value of the parameter, φ = 0:
dRv(φ)/dφ    =   −sinφ  −cosφ       =    0  −1   = i
       φ =0        cosφ  −sinφ               1    0    
   
            φ = 0                  
so that
                           Rv(δφ) = I + dRv(φ)/dφ .δφ,  
          φ = 0    
a quantity that differs from the identity I by a term that involves the
infinitesimal, δφ: this is an infinitesimal transformation.
Lie was concerned with Differential Equations and not Geometry.  He
was therefore motivated to discover the key equation
dRv(φ)/dφ  =      0  −1    cosφ  −sinφ     
      1    0       sinφ    cosφ     
       = iRv(φ) .
This is Lie’s differential equation.
Integrating between φ = 0 and φ = φ, we obtain
Rv(φ)                           φ
    ∫ dRv(φ)/Rv(φ)  = i ∫ dφ
    I                            0
so that

54
            ln(Rv(φ)/I) = iφ,
or
          Rv(φ) = Ieiφ , the solution of Lie’s equation.
Previously, we obtained
         Rv(φ) = Icosφ + isinφ.
We have, therefore
 
            Ieiφ = Icosφ + isinφ .     
This is an independent proof of the famous Cotes-Euler equation.
We introduce an operator of the form
     O = g(x, y, ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y),
and ask the question: does
    δx = Of(x, y; δφ) ?
Lie answered the question in the affirmative; he found
        δx = O(xδφ) = (x∂/∂y − y∂/∂x)xδφ = −yδφ
and
        δy = O(yδφ) = (x∂/∂y − y∂/∂x)y∂φ =  xδφ .
Putting x = x1 and y = x2, we obtain
   δxi = Xxiδφ , i = 1, 2
where
     X = O = (x1∂/∂x2 − x2∂/∂x1), the “generator of rotations” in the plane.
6.3 Exponentiation of infinitesimal rotations
We have seen that
   Rv(φ) = eiφ,

55
and therefore
     Rv(δφ) = I + iδφ, for an infinitesimal rotation, δφ
Performing two infinitesimal rotations in succession, we have
   Rv
2(δφ) = (I + iδφ)2
      =  I + 2iδφ to first order,
      = Rv(2δφ).
Applying Rv(δφ) n-times gives
            Rv
n(δφ) = Rv(nδφ) = einδφ = eiφ
      = Rv(φ) (as n → ∞ and δφ → 0, the
 
           product nδφ → φ).
This result agrees, as it should, with the exact solution of Lie’s differential
equation.  
A finite rotation can be built up by exponentiation of infinitesimal
rotations, each one being close to the identity.  In general, this approach has
the advantage that the infinitesimal form of a transformation can often be
found in a straightforward way, whereas the finite form is often intractable.
6.4 Infinitesimal rotations and angular momentum operators
In Classical Mechanics, the angular momentum of a mass m, moving in
the plane about the origin of a cartesian reference frame with a momentum p
is

56
          Lz = r × p = rpsinφnz
where nz is a unit vector normal to the plane, and φ is the angle between r
and p.  In component form, we have
         Lz
cl = xpy − ypx, where px and py are the cartesian
components of p.
The transition between Classical and Quantum Mechanics is made by
replacing
          px by −i(h/2π)∂/∂x (a differential operator)
and
          py by −i(h/2π)∂/∂y (a differential operator),where h
is Planck’s constant.
We can therefore write the quantum operator as
         Lz
Q = −i(h/2π)(x∂/∂y − y∂/∂x) = −i(h/2π)X
and therefore
  X = iLz
Q/(h/2π),
and
    δxi =  Xxi δφ = (2πiLz
Q/h)xi δφ, i = 1,2.
Let an arbitrary, continuous, differentiable function f(x, y) be
transformed under the infinitesimal changes
  x´ = x − yδφ
  y´ = y + xδφ .
Using Taylor’s theorem, we can write
  f(x´, y´) = f(x + δx, y + δy)

57
      = f(x − yδφ, y + xδφ)
      = f(x, y) + ((∂f/∂x)δx + ((∂f/∂y)δy)
                                          = f(x, y) + δφ(−y(∂/∂x) + x(∂/∂y))f(x, y)
      = I + 2πiδφLz/h)f(x, y)
      = e2πiδφLz/h f(x, y)
      = Rv(2πLzδφ/h) f(x, y).
The invatriance of length under rotations follows at once from this result:
  If f(x, y) = x2 + y2  then
    ∂f/∂x = 2x and ∂f/∂y = 2y, and therefore
    f(x´, y´) = f(x, y) + 2xδx + 2yδy
        = f(x, y) − 2x(yδφ) + 2y(xδφ)
        = f(x, y) = x2 + y2 = invariant.
This is the only form that leads to the invariance of length under rotations.

58
6.5 3-dimensional rotations
Consider three successive counterclockwise rotations about the x, y´,
and z´´ axes through angles µ, θ, and φ, respectively:
                      z    
                                                                  z′                  y′  
                                               µ about x
                               y                                                    y
                                        x                                                   x, x′  
               z′                 y′                                       z′′       y′, y′′
                                               θ about y´
                                        x′                                            x′′   x′

    =   −sinφcosθ   −sinφsinθsinµ + cosφcosµ        sinφsinθcosµ + sinφsinµ     
     sinθ              −cosθsinµ                                cosθcosµ                  
For infinitesimal rotations, the total rotation matrix is, to 1st-order in the δ’s:
                                                 1              δφ             −δθ    
                 Rc(δµ, δθ, δφ) =    −δφ              1                δµ   .
                                                δθ            −δµ               1     
The infinitesimal form can be written as follows:

59
                                     1  δφ  0       1   0 −δθ     1   0    0     
    Rc(δµ, δθ, δφ) =     −δφ  1   0     0   1   0     0   1  δµ  
                                     0   0   1      δθ   0   1      0 −δµ  1   
                           =    I + Y3δφ  I + Y2δθ  I + Y1δµ      
where
                           0  0  0                       0  0 −1                      0  1  0   
              Y1 =      0  0  1    ,    Y2 =     0  0  0    ,     Y3 =    −1  0  0    .

To 1st-order in the δ’s, we have
                   Rc(δµ, δθ, δφ)  = I  +  Y1δµ  +  Y2δθ  +  Y3δφ .
6.6  Algebra of the angular momentum operators
The algebraic properties of the Y’s are important.  For example, we find
 that their commutators are:
                             0   0   0   0   0 −1          0   0 −1   0   0  0   
[Y1, Y2]  =     0   0   1   0   0   0   −     0   0   0   0   0  1   
                             0 −1   0   1   0   0          1   0   0   0 −1  0    
                       =  −Y3  ,
[Y1, Y3]   =   Y2  ,
and
[Y2, Y3]   =  −Y1 .
These relations define the algebra of the Y’s.  In general, we have
  [Yj, Yk]  =  ± Yl = εjkl Yl ,
where εjkl is the anti-symmetric Levi-Civita symbol.  It is equal to +1 if jkl is
an even permutation, −1 if jkl is an odd permutation, and it is equal to zero if
two indices are the same.

60
Motivated by the relationship between Lz and X in 2-dimensions, we
introduce the operators
   Jk = −i(2π/h)Yk , k = 1, 2, 3.
Their commutators are obtained from those of the Y’s, for example
   [Y1, Y2] = −Y3 →  [2πiJ1/h, 2πiJ2/h] = −2πiJ3/h
or
    −[J1, J2](2π/h)2 = −2πiJ3/h
and therefore
               [J1, J2] = ihJ3/2π .
These operators obey the general commutation relation
               [Jj, Jk] = ihεjkl Jl /2π .
The angular momentum operators form a “Lie Algebra”.
The basic algebraic properties of the angular momentum operators in
Quantum Mechanics stem directly from this relation.
Another approach involves the use of the differential operators in 3-
dimensions.  A point P[x, y, z] transforms under an infinitesimal rotation of
the coordinates as follows
               P´[x´, y´, z´]  =  Rc(δµ, δθ, δφ]P[x, y, z]
Substituting the infinitesimal form of Rc in this equation gives
          δx = x´ − x =           yδφ − zδθ
          δy = y´ − y =  −xδφ         + zδµ
           δz = z´ − z =   xδθ − yδµ .

61
Introducing the classical angular momentum operators: Li
cl, we find that
these small changes can be written
            3
          δxi  =  ∑ δαk Xkxi 
           k = 1
For example, if i = 1
           δx1 = δx  =   δµ(z∂/∂y  −  y∂/∂z)x
                  + δθ(-z∂/∂x  +  x∂/∂z)x
                  + δφ(y∂/∂x  −  x∂/∂y)x   =  −zδθ  +  yδφ .
Extending  Lie’s method to three dimensions, the infinitesimal form
of the rotation operator is readily shown to be
        3
Rc(δµ, δθ, δφ)  =  I  +  ∑ (∂Rc/∂αi)| ⋅ δαi . 
                                 i = 1                            All αi’s = 0

For  exa mple,  we now  rec onsid er the  the  inv arian ts of rot ation s:

     dx1/x2  =  dφ, and  dx2/x1  =  −dφ,
so tha t
dx1/x2  +  dx2/x1  =  0.

The  sol ution  of thi s equ ation is

  PROPERTIES OF n-VARIABLE, r-PARAMETER LIE GROUPS
The change of an n-variable function F(x) produced by the
infinitesimal transformations associated with r-essential parameters is:
 n
          dF = ∑ (∂F/∂xi)dxi
i = 1
where
 r
 dxi = ∑ uiλ(x)δaλ , the Lie form.
λ = 1
The parameters are independent of the xi’s therefore we can write
   r        n
  dF =  ∑ δaλ{∑ uiλ(x)(∂/∂xi)F}
  λ = 1       i = 1
   r
       =  ∑ δaλ Xλ F
  λ = 1
where the infinitesimal generators of the group are
                                                n
   Xλ ≡  ∑ uiλ(x)(∂/∂xi) , λ= 1 to r.
  i = 1
The operator
     r
     I  +  ∑ Xλδaλ
    λ = 1
differs infinitesimally from the identity.
The generators Xλ have algebraic properties of basic importance in the
Theory of Lie Groups.  The Xλ’s are differential operators.  The problem is
therefore one of obtaining the algebraic structure of differential operators.
This problem has its origin in the work of Poisson (1807); he
introduced the following ideas:
The two expressions
X1f  =  (u11∂/∂x1  +  u12∂/∂x2)f
and

72
X2f  =  (u21∂/∂x1  +  u22∂/∂x2)f
where the coefficients uiλ are functions of the variables x1, x2, and f(x1, x2)
is an arbitrary differentiable function of the two variables, are termed
linear differential operators.
The “product” in the order X2 followed by X1 is defined as
X1X2f  =  (u11∂/∂x1  +  u12∂/∂x2)(u21∂f/∂x1  +  u22∂f/∂x2)
The product in the reverse order is defined as
X2X1f  =  (u21∂/∂x1  +  u22∂/∂x2)(u11∂f/∂x1  +  u12∂f/∂x2).
The difference is
X1X2f  −  X2X1f  =    X1u21∂f/∂x1  +  X1u22∂f/∂x2
  − X2u11∂f/∂x1  −  X2u12∂f/∂x2.
                         =  (X1u21  −  X2u11)∂f/∂x1  +  (X1u22  −  X2u12)∂f/∂x2
       ≡  [X1, X2]f.
This quantity is called the Poisson operator or the commutator of the
operators X1f and X2f.
The method can be generalized to include λ = 1 to r essential parameters
and i = 1 to n variables.  The ath-linear operator is then
 Xa  =  uia∂f/∂xi
   n
       =  ∑ uia∂f/∂xi , ( a sum over repeated indices).
  i = 1
Lie’s differential equations have the form
∂xi/∂aλ  =  uik(x)Akλ(a) , i = 1 to n, λ = 1 to r.
Lie showed that
    (∂ckτσ/∂aρ)uik  =  0

73
in which
        ujσ∂uiτ/∂xj  −  ujτ∂uiσ/∂xj  = ckτσ(a)uik(x),
so that the ckτσ’s are constants.  Furthermore, the commutators can be
written
          [Xρ, Xσ]  = ( ckρσujk)∂/∂xj
               = ckρσXk.
The commutators are linear combinations of the Xk’s.  (Recall the earlier
discussion of the angular momentum operators and their commutators).
The ckρσ’s are called the structure constants of the group.  They have the
properties
                      ckρσ  =  −ckσρ ,
    cµρσcνµτ  +  cµστcνµρ  +  cµτρcνµσ  =  0.
Lie made the remarkable discovery that, given these structure constants,
the functions that satisfy
              ∂xi/∂aλ  =  uikAkλ(a) can be found.
(Proofs of all the above important statements, together with proofs of
Lie’s three fundamental theorems, are given in Eisenhart’s
standard work Continuous Groups of Transformations, Dover Publications,
1961).
8.1  The rank of a group
Let A be an operator that is a linear combination of the generators
of a group, Xi:
         A  =  αiXi  (sum over i),

74
and let
         X  =  xjXj .
The rank of the group is defined as the minimum number of commuting,
linearly independent operators of the form A.
We therefore require all solutions of
    [A, X] = 0.
For example, consider the orthogonal group, O+(3); here
          A  =  αiXi  i = 1 to 3,
and
          X  =  xjXj  j = 1 to 3
so that
    [A, X]  = αixj[Xi, Xj] i, j = 1 to 3
       = αixjεijkXk .
The elements of the sets of generators are linearly independent, therefore
               αixjεijk  = 0 (sum over i, j,, k = 1, 2, 3)
This equation represents the equations
  −α2   α1  0        x1         0  
   α3   0  −α2     x2  =   0  .
   0   −α3  α2       x3           0  
The determinant of  is zero, therefore a non-trivial solution of the xj’s
exists.  The solution is given by
                 xj  =  αj  (j = 1, 2, 3)
so that
       A  =  X .
O+(3) is a group of rank one.
8.2  The Casimir operator of O+(3)

75
The generators of the rotation group O+(3) are the operators. Yk’s,
discussed previously.  They are directly related to the angular momentum
operators, Jk:
    Jk  =  -i(h/2π)Yk (k = 1, 2, 3).
The matrix representations of the Yk’s are
              0   0   0                 0   0 −1                 0   1   0  
Y1 =       0   0   1  ,   Y2  =    0   0   0  ,   Y3  =   −1   0   0 .
             0  −1   0                1   0   0                   0   0   0   
The square of the total angular momentum, J is
         3
J2  =  ∑ Ji
2
         1
     = (h/2π)2 (Y1
2 + Y2
2 + Y3
2)
     = (h/2π)2(-2I).
Schur’s lemma states that an operator that is a constant multiple of I
commutes with all matrix irreps of a group, so that
[Jk, J2]  =  0  , k = 1,2 ,3.
The operator J2 with this property is called the Casimir operator of the
 group O+(3).
In general, the set of operators {Ci} in which the elements commute
with the elements of the set of irreps of a given group, forms the set of
Casimir operators of the group.  All Casimir operators are constant multiples
of the unit matrix:
 Ci  =  a iI; the constants ai are characteristic of a
particular representation of a group.

Tji´  =  RjlRimTlm  =  RjmRilTml  =  RilRjmTlm  =  Tij´ .
If TrT ij  =  0, the n so is TrT ij´, for

To cla ssify  the  iso spin sta tes of the  nuc leon we may  use  the

12. 3  Iso spin in nuc lei.
The  con cept of iso spin,  and  of rot ation s in iso spin spa ce, ass ociat ed

nuc leons  in a bou nd sta te.  
Let  the  iso spin of the  ith -nucl eon be ti, and  let ti = 
i /2.   The 
ope rator  of a sys tem of A nuc leons  is def ined as
           T  =  ∑A
i=1  ti  =  ∑A
i=1  
i/2 .
The  eig envalue  of T3 of the  iso spin ope rator  T3 is the  sum  of the  ind ividu al
com ponen ts
                   T3  =  ∑A
i=1  t3i  =  ∑A
i=1  τ3i/2
      = (Z – N)/ 2 .
The  cha rge, QN of a nuc leus can  be wri tten
QN  =  q∑A
i=1  (τ3i + 1)/ 2
              = q(T 3 + A/2 ) .
For  a giv en eig enval ue T of the  ope rator  T, the  sta te is (2T  + 1)- fold
deg enera te.  The  eig enval ues T3 of T3 are 

117
 T3  =  −T, −T + 1,. ..0,. ..T + 1, T .
If the  Ham ilton ian H of the  nuc leus is cha rge-i ndepe ndent  the n
   [H, T]  =  0.
and  T is said  to be a goo d qua ntum num ber.  In lig ht nuc lei, whe re the 
iso spin- viola ting cou lomb int eract ion bet ween pai rs of pro tons is a sma ll

The  spi n and  par ity of the  gro und sta te of 14C, the  fir st exc ited sta te of 14N

12. 4  Iso spin and  mes ons
We hav e see n tha t it is pos sible  to cla ssify  the  cha rge sta tes of

Yuk awa’s  met hod was  a mas terfu l dev elopm ent of the  the ory of the

the  “me son wav efunc tion”  the n the  Yuk awa dif feren tial equ ation for  the

   ∂µ∂µ ψπ + (E0/hc)2ψπ  =  0.
whe re
        ∂µ∂µ  =  (1/ c2)∂2/∂t 2 − ∇2 .
The  r-d epend ent (sp atial ) for m of ∇2 is
          ∇2 → (1/ r2)d/ dr(r2d/d r)
The  sta tic (ti me-in depen dent)  sol ution  of thi s equ ation is rea dily che cked to
be
       Ψ(r)   =  (−g2/r) exp(−r/r N)

The  “ra nge of the  nuc lear for ce” is def ined by the  con ditio n
    r  =  rN  =  h/mπc ≈ 2 ×10-13  cm. 
Thi s giv es the  mas s of the  mes on to be clo se to the  mea sured  val ue.  It is
imp ortan t to not e tha t the  “ra nge of the  for ce” ∝ 1/( mass of the  fie ld

The y are  the refor e con sider ed to be mem bers of an iso spin tri plet:
