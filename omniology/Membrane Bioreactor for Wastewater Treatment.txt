Preface
Preface
There is a trend that stricter and stricter wastewater discharge standards are going to be implemented. 
Therefore, available techniques for municipal wastewater treatment need to be upgraded in order to 
meet the requirements of those standards. Meanwhile, new techniques are also under developing. 
While conventional secondary settlers are replaced by membranes for sludge and waster separation, 
the combination of reactor and membrane is called membrane bioreactor (MBR). The main benefits 
of the introduction of MBR are that much smaller footprints are required since secondary settlers are 
not required; and much better effluent qualities can be achieved due to the application of membranes. 
The main drawback of the application of MBR is that the cost of construction and operation of MBR 
is higher than conventional bioreactors. Nevertheless, MBR has been applied from 1990s and now is 
more and more popular.
This edited book tries to include the most related and practical knowledge about MBR. Detailed 
discussion about deep scientific knowledge in all fields of MBR is not addressed. The book starts from 
the introduction of biological wastewater treatment. In addition, the book focuses on knowledge of 
membrane, performance of MBR and its operation. This book is suitable for person who does not have 
any background in MBR. After reading this book, readers should be acquainted with MBR.
Please be noted that, up to now, most knowledge is about operation of MBRs for municipal wastewater 
treatment in which aerobic MBRs are applied. Regarding the application of anaerobic MBR, the operation 
experience is relatively limited. However, recent development of anaerobic MBR is also included in this 
book.

Overview of biological wastewater treatment
1	 Overview of biological 
wastewater treatment
In 2007, the development of sanitation was voted to be the greatest medical advance in the last 166 
years in a contest run by the British Medical Journal. This confirms the utterly important role of 
proper sanitation in achieving and maintaining good public health. In many industrialized countries, 
wastewater is transported safely away from the house-holds. Proper sewage treatment is however not 
always in place, in particular in many developing countries where sanitation coverage is, by far, less in 
comparison with water supply. The need for proper sanitation was made explicit in the United Nations 
Millennium development goals. Goal number 7 urges for the reduction by half of the population living 
without proper sanitation. Despite significant efforts, progress on sanitation targets is very slow and still 
lacking behind. Acknowledging the impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, economic 
and social development and the environment, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared 
2008 to be the International Year of Sanitation. The goal was to focus the world’s attention on the need 
to start implementing proper sanitation solutions for all (Mogens et al. 2008).
Important in this is to not only connect people to sanitation solutions, but to make this connection last in 
an environmentally sustainable way. Sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants have proven to be very 
efficient in conveying and removing pathogens, organic pollutants and nutrients. However, they require 
proper operation and maintenance, and a good understanding of the processes involved (Mogens et al. 2008).
The aim of this chapter is to introduce basic knowledge about wastewater treatment.
1.1	
Wastewater constituents
The constituents of wastewaters, which origin from different sources of wastewaters, vary significantly. 
Traditionally, wastewater treatment mainly includes the removal of suspended matters and organic 
matters. However, the removal of nutrient (ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, phosphate) is necessary in 
many countries.
1.2	
Organic material removal
1.2.1	
Principle of biodegradable organic material removal 
A wide variety of heterotrophic bacteria can consume organic materials, in which a lot of bioprocesses 
occur. During the bioprocess, energy is released and used to sustain activities of the bacteria. In addition, 
biopolymers are synthesized, which connects bacteria together and forms biological flocs, known as 
suspended sludge, or biofilms. The flocs can be separated from liquid by gravity settling, which promotes 
the retention of sludge. The retention of sludge is essential for biological wastewater treatment. Meanwhile, 
bacteria also undergo an endogenous respiration process, which reduces the concentration of suspended 
sludge.

1.2.2	
Classification of organic matters 
Apparently, not all organic matters are biodegradable. In order to design a wastewater treatment 
plant, it is suggested to carefully characterize the constituents of organic matters. The organic matters 
can be classified into four categories: soluble and non-biodegradable (SI), soluble and biodegradable 
(Ss), non-soluble and non-biodegradable (XI), non-soluble and biodegradable (XS). In order to know 
the characteristics of a kind of wastewater, the four kinds of constituents should be determined by 
measurements. The following determination example is based on experiences on Dutch municipal 
wastewater (Roeleveld and van Loosdrecht 2002). 
The consequence for the characterisation of wastewater is summarized below:
1.	 Determination of SI based on the inert soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the 
effluent of the wastewater treatment plant;
2.	 Determination of Ss by subtracting the fraction SI from the soluble COD in the effluent;
3.	 Determination of Xs by subtracting the fraction Ss from the biodegradable COD;
4.	 Determination of XI with the equation X=CODinfluent-SI-Ss-Xs.
1.2.3	
Calculation for organic matter removal
Based on the characterization of organic materials in wastewater, following calculation for organic matter 
removal is based on these preconditions:
1.	 The amount of volatile suspended solids (VSSs) in the plant for organic matter removal
= the amount of microorganisms + respiration residual products + non-biodegradable organic 
particles

Nitrogen removal
1.3.1	
Nitrification
The ammonium ions are produced in wastewater from the hydrolysis of urea and degradation of organic-
nitrogen compounds. Hydrolysis and degradation of organic-nitrogen compounds results in the release 
of amino groups and the production of ammonium ions (Gerardi 2002). Biological nitrification is the 
conversion or oxidation of ammonium ions to nitrite ions and then to nitrate ions. During the oxidation 
of ammonium ions and nitrite ions, oxygen is added to the ions by a unique group of organisms. 
Nitrification occurs in nature and in activated sludge processes. Nitrification in wastewater treatment is 
required because of (Tchobanoglous et al. 2004):

1.	 The effect of ammonia on receiving water on dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and fish 
toxicity;
2.	 The need to provide nitrogen removal to control eutrophication;
3.	 The need to provide nitrogen control for water-reuse applications.
Although ammonium ions and ammonia are reduced forms of nitrogen, it is the ammonium ion, not 
ammonia, which is oxidized during nitrification. The quantities of ammonium ions and ammonia in 
an aeration tank are dependent on the pH and temperature of the activated sludge. In the temperature 
range of 10 to 20 oC and pH range of 7 to 8.5, which are typical of most activated sludge processes, about 
95% of the reduced form of nitrogen is present as ammonium ions (Gerardi 2002).
The oxidation of ammonium ions and nitrite ions is achieved through the addition of dissolved oxygen 
within bacterial cells. Because nitrification or the biochemical reactions of oxygen addition occur inside 
biological cells, nitrification occurs through biochemical reactions (Gerardi 2002). Nitrification includes 
converting ammonia into nitrite which is further oxidized into nitrate. The processes are depicted by 
the two following reactions:

The above reaction shows that, while each gram of ammonia nitrogen (as N) is consumed, 4.25 g of O2 
are depleted and 7.07 g of alkalinity as CaCO3 are removed.
Factors influencing nitrification
In order to achieve a good nitrification effect, the following factors should be taken into account while 
operating a wastewater treatment plant.
1.	 Maximum ammonia oxidation bacteria growth rate (μmax) 
It is between 0.3–0.75. The value should be determined by experiments, or else a low value 
should be applied. The determination procedure can be referred to published literature (Mogens 
et al. 2008);

Denitrification
Wastewater denitrification describes the use of nitrite ions or nitrate ions by facultative anaerobes 
(denitrifying bacteria) to degrade BOD. Although denitrification often is combined with aerobic 
nitrification to remove various forms of nitrogenous compounds from wastewater, denitrification occurs 
when an anoxic condition exists (Gerardi 2002).

Overview of biological wastewater treatment
Facultative anaerobes make up approximately 80% of the bacteria within an activated sludge process. 
These organisms have an enzymatic ability to use free molecular oxygen, nitrite ions, or nitrate ions 
to degrade BOD. Facultative anaerobes prefer and use free molecular oxygen when it is available. The 
use of free molecular oxygen provides the bacteria with more energy for cellular activity, growth, and 
reproduction than does the use of nitrite ions or nitrate ions (Gerardi 2002).
Bacterial degradation of BOD is ‘respiration’. Respiration may be aerobic (oxic) or anaerobic. Aerobic 
respiration occurs when free molecular oxygen is available and is used to degrade BOD (Gerardi 2002). 
Anaerobic respiration occurs when free molecular oxygen is not available and another molecule is 
used to degrade BOD. Molecules other than free molecular oxygen that can be used to degrade BOD 
include nitrite ions and nitrate ions. The molecule used for the degradation of BOD is dependent on 
its availability, the presence of other molecules, and the enzymatic ability of the bacterial population. If 
nitrite ions or nitrate ions are used to degrade BOD, such as a five carbon sugar, this form of respiration 
is termed ‘anoxic’ (Gerardi 2002).
During anoxic respiration, nitrite ions and nitrate ions are reduced (oxygen removed from the ions) 
through several biochemical steps or reactions. The principle gaseous end product of the biochemical 
reactions is molecular nitrogen (Gerardi 2002).
Anoxic respiration or denitrification is termed ‘dissimilatory’ nitrite or nitrate reduction, because nitrite 
ions and nitrate ions, respectively, are reduced to from molecular nitrogen. The nitrogen in the nitrite 
ions or nitrate ions is not incorporated into cellular material, the nitrogen in the ions is loss to the 
atmosphere as a gas (Gerardi 2002).
There are three kinds of organic materials can be used for denitrification, i.e. organic materials from 
wastewater; products from endogenous decay; external added organic materials. Different organic donors 
would produce different denitrification rates. The following equations show how denitrification occur 
while different organic materials are used as electro donors (Tchobanoglous et al. 2004).

Overview of biological wastewater treatment
Factors influencing denitrification
In order to achieve a good denitrification effect, the following factors should be taken into account while 
operating a wastewater treatment plant.
1.	 Carbon source
If BOD5 /TN>3-carbon source is considered sufficient and external carbon source addition is 
required.
2.	 pH
It is better to control pH between 6 and 7.
3.	 DO
In general, the proteins required for denitrification are only produced under (close to) anaerobic 
conditions, and if anaerobically grown cells are exposed to O2 then the activities of the proteins 
are inhibited.
4.	 Temperature
Should be between 20–40 oC.
1.4	
Phosphate removal
1.4.1	
Principle for phosphate removal
Some bacteria can survive while anaerobic and aerobic conditions both exist. These bacteria are able to 
accumulate a large amount of phosphate in their inner bodies. The bacteria are therefore called phosphate 
accumulating organisms (PAOs). By the discharge of the bacteria from reactors, biological phosphate 
removal can be achieved. 
Unlike most other microorganisms, PAOs prefer take up carbon sources such as volatile fatty acids 
(VFAs) under anaerobic conditions, and store them intracellularly as carbon polymers, namely poly-b-
hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The energy for this biotransformation is mainly generated by the cleavage of 
polyphosphate and the release of phosphate. Reducing power is also required for PHA formation, which 
is produced largely through the glycolysis of internally stored glycogen. Aerobically, PAOs can use their 
stored PHA as energy source for biomass growth, glycogen replenishment, P uptake and polyphosphate 
storage. Net P removal from the wastewater is achieved through the removal of waste activated sludge 
containing a high polyphosphate content (Mino et al. 1998). The schematic description of biological 
phosphate removal is shown in figure 1.1.

Factors influencing phosphate removal
When operated successfully, the enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR) process is a relatively 
inexpensive and environmentally sustainable option for P removal; however, the stability and reliability of 
EBPR can be a problem. It is widely known that EBPR plants may experience process upsets, deterioration 
in performance and even failures, causing violations to discharge regulations. In some cases, external 
disturbances include:

Overview of biological wastewater treatment
1.	 high rainfall;
2.	 excessive nitrate loading to the anaerobic reactor;
3.	 nutrient limitation;
4.	 Competition between PAO and GAO. 
Microbial competition between PAOs and another group of organisms, known as the glycogen (non-
polyphosphate) accumulating organisms (GAOs), has been hypothesized to be the cause of the degradation 
in P removal. Like PAOs, GAOs are able to proliferate under alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions 
without performing anaerobic P release or aerobic P uptake, thus they do not contribute to P removal 
from EBPR systems. 
Complex substrates do not favour the growth of PAOs. However, VFA promote proliferation of PAOs. 
In addition, Low COD/P (i.e. 10–20 mg COD/P) is preferred.
It is reported that only the readily biodegradable fraction of the influent COD was used by the PAOs 
(vanLoosdrecht et al. 1997). Recent studies have suggested that propionate may be a more favourable 
substrate than acetate for successful EBPR performance. These studies suggest that a propionate feed 
source may provide an advantage to PAOs over GAOs.
Numerous studies have found that a high COD/P ratio (e.g. 450 mg COD/ mg P) in the wastewater feed 
tends to favour the growth of GAOs instead of PAOs. Thus, a low COD/P ratio (e.g. 10–20 mg COD/ 
mg P) should be more favourable to the growth of PAOs. 
Some environmental conditions also can have an impact on phosphate removal. These environmental 
conditions include: pH, temperature and Do.
1.	 pH
High pH favours the growth of PAOs and negatively influences GAOs ability to take up VFA. 
7.25 is suggested as critical pH. Many studies have shown that a higher ambient pH in enriched 
PAO sludges has resulted in a higher anaerobic P release. Aerobically, a series of batch tests 
has shown that P uptake, PHA utilization and biomass growth were all inhibited by a low  
pH (6.5), and suggested that a higher aerobic pH (7–7.5) would be more beneficial for PAOs. 
This suggests that a higher pH not only results in a higher energy demand for acetate uptake, 
but also negatively affects the ability of GAOs to take up acetate.

Overview of biological wastewater treatment
2.	 Temperature
An increase in the fraction of GAOs and decrease in the fraction of PAOs was concluded with 
an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 oC, which correlated well with a decrease in the P 
content in the sludge. The experimental evidence obtained thus far suggests that GAOs tend to 
become stronger competitors with PAOs at higher temperatures. This implies that competition 
by GAOs with PAOs in EBPR plants may be more problematic in warm climates, and during the 
summer months. Successful EBPR operation has been observed at very low temperatures, even 
5 0C, though a higher sludge age was necessary at low temperatures due to the decrease in the 
kinetics of the process at low temperatures. This improved performance has been hypothesized 
to be due to a shift in the microbial community from GAOs to PAOs.
3.	 DO
Poor P removal performance was more frequently observed at very high DO concentrations 
of 4.5–5.0 mg/L, while DO concentrations of approximately 2.5–3.0 mg/L seemed to correlate 
with a greater abundance of PAO. It has been observed that aerobic and anoxic P uptake is 
inhibited by the presence of nitrite. Thus, it seems that the presence and accumulation of nitrite 
inhibits PAOs, thereby favouring the growth of GAOs.

membranes. Figure 2.1 shows the surface of a membrane. The pores are so small that they are only can 
be seen with the help of microscopes. Due to their small sizes, the membrane pores only allow small 
particles and water to penetrate from one side of a membrane to the other side. As a result, water can 
penetrate the membranes while most particles are retained. Hence, clean water can be produced through 
the application of membranes. The clean water is then called permeate. Please be noted that there are also 
many tiny particles in the permeate of membranes. However, the amount of residual particles and their 
sizes depend on the type of applied membranes. In addition, permeate of membrane is characterized by 
much better water qualities than the effluent of conventional secondary clarifiers.

Based on the sizes of the pores, the membranes are called microfiltration (MF) membrane, ultrafiltration 
(UF) membrane, nanofiltration membrane or reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, respectively. The 
classification of membranes and their functions are shown in table 2.1. Usually, microfiltration and 
ultrafiltration membranes are applied together with bioreactors in wastewater treatment, which is termed 
membrane bioreactors (MBRs).
2.1.2	
Configurations of membranes
There are three principal membrane configurations that are currently applied in MBR e, i.e. hollow fiber, 
flat sheet and tubular membrane. Hollow fiber and flat sheet membranes are usually submerged in liquid 
while tubular membranes are usually placed outside of bioreactors.

In the hollow fiber module, large amounts of hollow fiber membranes make a bundle (figure. 2.2). In 
hollow-fiber modules, the flow is usually from outside to inside (figure 2.3). The diameters of the hollow 
fibers generally are a few hundred micrometres. The modules are installed either horizontally or vertically. 
These modules feature a high packing density and are submerged in biomass (Cornel and Krause 2008).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
The rate of water passing through membrane surface is called membrane flux. Higher flux means that 
more water can be produced by a unit membrane surface. However, during operation, under certain 
operation conditions, the membrane flux inclines to decrease, which is called membrane fouling. The 
cause of membrane fouling is that particles accumulate on membrane surface, which increases membrane 
filtration resistance. Membrane fouling is a major problem in membrane operation because it increases 
operation cost and requires membrane cleaning. Hence, certain approaches should be employed to 
prevent and remove the fouling in order to recover the membrane flux, which is called fouling control. 
Detailed contents about membrane fouling and its control are introduced in chapter 3.
Fouling control of hollow fiber membranes is usually achieved by aerators installed underneath the 
membrane module. Often coarse bubble aeration acts as a source of scour at membrane surface, but 
fine bubble aerators are also employed. Membrane operation may include periodic relaxation (pressure 
release) and/or back-flushing for removing the fouling layer from the membrane surface. In hollow-fiber 
modules, in particular, sludging and braiding of the membranes can be a major problem. Braiding is 
caused by hair and/or long fibers (e.g., additive cellulose fibers) that may loop around the membrane 
bundle, typically in the upper part of the module. Braiding is to be avoided by carefully screening the 
influent or the recirculated mixed liquor. In the lower part of the module, sludge may accumulate due 
to insufficient water and/or airflow. Especially when reducing the air scour to save energy, it should be 
kept in mind that a sufficient flow is crucial to preventing sludging of hollow-fiber bundles. Both effects 
are likely to reduce the active membrane surface area and mechanical cleaning is necessary (Cornel and 
Krause 2008).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Flat sheet membrane modules comprise of flat sheet membranes with separators. The pieces of these 
sheets are clamped onto a plate. The water flows across the membrane and permeate is collected through 
pipes emerging from the interior of the membrane module which is operated under vacuum (figure 2.4) 
(Radjenović et al. 2008). A schematic view of the operation of flat sheet membranes is shown in figure 2.5.
Plate-and-frame membrane modules are less prone to braiding. Long fibers and hair cannot loop around 
the membrane. In plate-and-frame modules, fouling may occur in the peripheral area. Also, blocking 
of the gaps occurs. At present, plate-and-frame modules are operated at high airflow rates in order to 
minimize these phenomena. Most of the commercially available plate-and-frame modules cannot be 
back-flushed, which restricts the cleaning (Cornel and Krause 2008).
Plate and fibre membranes are usually applied in municipal wastewater treatment, while the use of 
tubular membrane is relatively limited. Table 2.2 shows the advantage and disadvantages of plate and 
fibre membranes (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).

There are also membrane configurations such as tubular module, which is not widely used as the 
plate and fibre membranes. Typically, tubular membranes are encased in pressure vessels, and mixed 
liquor is pumped to tubular membranes. Tubular membranes are predominantly used for side-stream 
configurations. Tubular modules are mainly operated in the ‘inside-out’ mode, whereas hollow fiber 
and flat sheet modules are mostly immersed directly in mixed liquor with permeate drawn through the 
membranes using vacuum pumps (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Figure 2.6 tubular membrane
Figure 2.7. schematic view of a tubular membrane module (side-stream module) (Cornel and Krause 2008)
Over the years, the diameter of tubular membrane has been progressively reduced from more than 20 
mm to 5 mm in order to increase the packing density. Tubular modules can have installation lengths of 
up to 6 m. These side-stream modules are operated at flow velocities of 1–4 m/s. Arrangement may be 
vertical or horizontal. Some systems are operated with additional aeration for fouling control. Tubular 
modules provide more direct hydrodynamic control at the membrane surface. Compared to submerged 
modules, the flux per surface area is higher, however, at the cost of a higher specific energy demand 
(kWh/m3). The modules can be back pulsed or flushed to clean the membrane surface. Some tubular 
membranes and a schematic view of a tubular module are shown in figure 2.6 and figure 2.7, respectively 
(Cornel and Krause 2008).
In tubular modules, hair and/or long fibers may accumulate in or even block the inflow region where 
the mixed liquor enters the tubes. This results in a higher energy demand and/or a flux decline (Cornel 
and Krause 2008).
The difference of the three membrane configurations can be seen in table 2.3.

Membrane materials
There are two types of membrane material, i.e. polymeric and ceramic. Metallic membrane filters also 
exist but have very specific applications which do not relate to MBR technology. The membrane material, 
to be made useful, must then be formed (or configured) in such a way as to allow water to pass through 
it. A number of different polymeric and ceramic materials are used to form membranes, but generally 
nearly always comprise a thin surface layer which provides the required perm-selectivity on top of a more 
open, thicker porous support layer which provides mechanical stability (figure 2.8). Classic membrane 
is thus anisotropic in structure, having symmetry only in the plane orthogonal to the membrane surface 
(Simon et al. 2008).

Figure 2.8 cross-section of a membrane
Polymeric membranes are also usually fabricated both to have a high surface porosity, and narrow pore 
size distribution to provide a high throughput and selectivity. The membrane must also be mechanically 
strong, i.e. to have structural integrity. Lastly, the material normally have some resistance to chemical 
attack, i.e. extremes of temperature, pH and/or oxidant concentrations that normally arise when the 
membrane is chemically cleaned, and should ideally offer some resistance to fouling (Simon et al. 2008).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Whilst, in principal, and polymer can be used to form a membrane ,only a limited number of materials 
are suitable for the duty of membrane separation, the most common materials are (1) polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF), (2) polyethylsulphone (PES), (3) polyethylene (PE),  and (4) polypropylene. All the 
above polymers can be formed, through specific manufacturing techniques, into membrane materials 
having desirable physical properties, and they each have reasonable chemical resistance. However, they 
are also hydrophobic, which makes them susceptible to fouling by hydrophobic matter in the bioreactor 
liquors they are filtering. This normally necessitates surface modification of the base material to produce 
a hydrophilic surface using such techniques as chemical oxidation, organic chemical reaction, and plasma 
treatment or grafting. It is this element that, if at all, most distinguishes one membrane product from 
another formed from the same base polymer. This modification process, the manufacturing method used 
to form the membrane from the polymer, most often PVDF for many MBR membranes, and the method 
for fabricating the membrane module from the membrane are all regarded as proprietary information 
by most suppliers (Simon et al. 2008).
2.1.4	
Basis of membrane Operation 
During MBR wastewater treatment, solid–liquid separation is achieved by MF or UF membranes. 
Feed water passes over the membrane surface and the product is called permeate, whereas the rejected 
constituents form concentrate or retentate (figure 2.9).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Recovery is normally close to 100% for dead-end filtration; however, it varies significantly for cross-flow 
filtration, which depends on the nature and design of membrane process. Permeate flux (usually denoted 
as J) is the volume of water passed through a unit area of membrane per unit of time and it is often 
normalized to a standard time. The common unit for J is usually L m–2 d–1, and most available data for 
MBR is given in that manner rather than in SI units. MBR membranes generally operate at fluxes between 
10 and 100 L m–2 h–1. The flux is related to its driving force which is transmembrane pressure (TMP or 
ΔP) while the membrane performance can be estimated from the membrane permeability (K), which is 
calculated as permeate flux per unit of TMP and is usually given as L m–2 h–1 (Radjenović et al. 2008).

2.2.1	
Introduction of membrane bioreactor
The application of biological wastewater treatment dates back to the late nineteenth century. It became 
a standard method of wastewater treatment by the 1930s. Both aerobic and anaerobic biological 
treatment technologies have been extensively applied to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment. 
In these technologies, biomass needs to be separated from liquid stream by the application of secondary 
clarifiers, in order to obtain clean effluent. However, secondary clarifiers have limited capacity of solid/
liquid separation. Therefore, secondary settling clarifiers are normally large to guarantee good liquid/
sludge separation effect. Nevertheless, the limited separation capacity cannot guarantee high sludge 
concentrations in reactors, which restricts the biological capacities of bioreactors.
To eradicate the disadvantage of conventional technologies, the biological technologies can be integrated 
with membrane technology. Membrane filtration and biological technologies can be efficiently applied 
together. The biological technologies converts dissolved organic matter into suspended biomass, which 
reduces membrane fouling. On the other hand, membranes not only replace secondary clarifiers for 
solid–liquid separation but also prevent visible particle from getting into effluent, which promotes high 
sludge concentrations in reactors (Hai and Yamamoto 2011). The application of MBR in municipal 
wastewater treatment has grown widely. This is due primarily to more stringent effluent water quality 
requirements, space constraints, lower operator involvement, modular expansion characteristics and 
consistent effluent water quality capabilities (AMTA 2007).
There are two kinds of configures of MBRs. While membrane is located in reactors, MBR is called 
submerged or immersed MBR. Alternatively, while membrane is located outside of a reactor, MBR is 
called sidestream MBR. Figure 2.10 shows a secondary settler, which is usually large, and a submerged 
MBR and a sidestream MBR (only membrane is shown).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Side stream MBR
Side-stream configurations typically use tubular membranes. In the side-stream configuration, mixed 
liquid suspended sludge (MLSS) is pumped into membrane modules. Membrane fouling is controlled 
by a well-defined flow velocity, i.e. 4 m/s (Cornel and Krause 2008). 
More recently, a Dutch company has developed an external membrane configuration consisting of cross-
flow membrane modules that are mounted vertically, and relying on the combination of air and liquid 
flow to create high shear inside tubular membranes which are 5.2 mm in diameter. In this case, the liquid 
velocity is approximately 0.5 m/sec, the air flow translates to an airflow velocity in the range from 0.3 to 
0.5 m/sec and the operating TMP is typically less than 15 percent of those in the conventional external 
membrane systems. 
Recently, a German company introduced a lower velocity, lower TMP (versus conventional external 
membrane systems) configuration. The configuration consists of cross-flow, tubular membrane modules, 
which are mounted horizontally. Velocity of sludge in the tubular membranes is approximately 1.2 m/
sec, and frequent membrane back pulsing is applied to maintain flux performance. No airflow is used 
inside the tubes (Sutton 2006).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
The capital and operating costs associated with the membrane component of an MBR system are 
significantly affected by permeate flux. Conventional external membrane systems typically are operated 
at fluxes between 85 to 135 L/m2 .h and at TMPs that are higher than 210 kPa. However, the non-
conventional, back washable, lower velocity, lower pressure, air-lift systems and liquid only based systems 
(i.e., non-conventional external membrane systems), typically are operated at fluxes between 40 to 80 L/
m2 .h and at TMPs less than 30 kPa (Sutton 2006).
Submerged MBR
In the immersed or internal membrane MBR system, membranes are directly submerged in bioreactor’s 
mixed-liquor, preferably located in compartments or a separate tank coupled to the bioreactor to minimize 
membrane cleaning efforts. This configuration typically involves the use of polymeric membranes. The 
membranes are either vertically or horizontally oriented hollow fibers contained in a rectangular or 
tubular support structure, or vertically oriented flat sheets contained within a support structure. The 
mixed-liquor is located on the shell side of the membranes and the effluent is extracted into the lumen of 
the membrane. The driving force across the membrane is typically achieved by creating negative pressure 
on the lumen or permeates side of the membrane. The membrane component of this configuration 
involves substantially more membrane area per unit volume, compared to the membrane component 
of the external MBR configuration. Although the shear across the membrane fibers is increased by 
continuous or intermittent aeration and other methods are used in certain designs to minimize the build-
up of solids on the membrane surface (e.g., frequent membrane back pulsing, intermittent permeation), 
the typical mean permeate fluxes in these systems are less than 35 L/m2 .h (Sutton 2006).

1. High effluent quality
MBR systems provide high effluent quality in a greatly simplified process. This requires only head works, 
biological processes, membrane filtration and disinfection to meet the most stringent water quality 
standards. More importantly, the effluent quality is highly consistent (AMTA 2007). Membrane permeate 
quality can be seen in table 2.5.
Because membrane retains most particulate matter, permeate is very low in total suspended solids, 
turbidity, BOD, and most pathogens (Daigger et al. 2005). Particulate, colloidal and high molecular weight 
organics are retained, providing a maximum opportunity for biological degradation of these compounds. 
Non-biodegradable compounds tend to be discharged together with residual sludge rather than with 
treated water. The application of MBR also eliminates concern of varying biomass settling characteristics 
(e.g., filamentous growth) and associated cost implications (e.g., polymer addition, chlorine addition to 
control filaments) (Sutton 2006).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
2. Small footprint
One of the advantages of MBR is its compactness, because large sedimentation tanks are not required. 
An interesting parameter in this respect is the surface-overflow rates for the two systems. The overflow 
rate of a secondary clarifier is defined as the volume of water that can be treated per square meter of 
tank. In practice, values around 22 m/d are used. For an MBR filtration tank, an overflow rate can also 
be estimated from the permeate flux and the membrane-packing density within the tank. Following this 
method, with an average permeate flux of 15 L/m2 .h, the overflow rates of the membrane tanks are in 
the range 25–62 m/d which is up to 3 times higher than the overflow rate of a conventional secondary 
clarifier. Compared to an average overflow rate of 22 m/d with a secondary clarifier, the space consumption 
for sludge-water separation in an MBR is 10–60% lower when flux is 15 L/m2 .h and 50–80% lower when 
flux is 25 L/m2 .h (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Higher MLSS concentration in MBRs than that in conventional technologies results in a further reduction 
in footprint. MBR systems are highly space efficient because it combines space efficient membrane 
systems and is operated at increased mixed liquor concentrations (commonly 8,000–18,000 mg/l). This 
estimation does not take into account back flushing or relaxation periods, which reduces the overflow 
rate. Nevertheless, full-scale MBR plants also manifest these space-saving characteristics. (Hai and 
Yamamoto 2011).
3. Easy operation
MBR systems do not require any more significant operational attention, in each case much less 
than conventional activated sludge (CAS) process. With modern process-control equipment, such 
as programmable logic controllers, most of the operations can be automated (Daigger et al. 2005). 
MBR systems can operate largely unattended except for occasional routine performance checks and 
maintenance of mechanical components. A process control of an MBR system is reduced to monitoring 
the MLSS concentration, occasional adjustments of the chemical feed rates, and scheduling membrane 
recovery cleaning. Therefore, MBR is much better solution for the small plants where CAS is non-feasible 
due to its requirement for constant attention and monitoring (Radjenović et al. 2008).

4. High SRT
Largely unencumbered control of the SRT provides optimum control of the microbial population and 
flexibility in operation. Provides opportunity to consider design/operation of bioreactor at very short or 
very long SRT (e.g., 1 day or less, or greater than 30 days) as process requirements dictate versus concerns 
for achieving a flocculant biomass. A short SRT maximizes biomass production and its organic content 
which if the biomass is anaerobically processed, maximizes digester gas production and therefore its 
energy value. A long SRT favours aerobic digestion of bio-solids, which may be attractive under certain 
circumstances (Sutton 2006). High mixed liquor concentrations in the reactor allow wastewaters to be 
treated efficiently at long SRTs, minimizing biomass yield (Sutton 2006). In addition, rapid initial process 
start-up due to retention of all microbial seed material can be achieved, and slower growing organisms, 
such as nitrifying bacteria and those capable of degrading complex organics, can be readily maintained 
in MBRs (Sutton 2006).
5. Low sludge production
A low sludge organic load (F/M) ratio means that less substrate is available per unit of biomass. Part of 
the energy contained in the supplied substrate is used for maintenance functions that are independent 
of growth rate. When the energy supplied to the bioreactor is lowered, the biomass ceases to grow and 
to utilize the substrate for maintenance. In this manner, the sludge production in the process is much 
lower. Nevertheless, due to the low F/M ratio, there is a significant decrease of sludge production in MBR 
in comparison to CAS, which then decreases the cost of excess sludge handling (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Table 2.6 provides a general comparison of the sludge-production rates from different treatment processes. 
It should be noted that the primary sludge production in the case of the MBR is lower. The suited pre-
treatment for the MBR is grids and/or sieves, and in an average, screened water was observed to contain 
30% more solids than settled water. MBR sludge treatment is almost the same compared to CAS systems. 
The dewater-ability of waste-activated sludge from the MBR seems to pose no additional problem, 
compared to aerobic stabilized waste sludge from CAS (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

6. Upgrade available plants
MBRs allow for exceptional versatility in the design of new plants or the retrofitting of existing wastewater-
treatment facilities, because membranes can be added in modules (Daigger et al. 2005). Therefore, MBR 
represents an attractive technology for upgrading and/or expanding an existing activated sludge system 
plagued by clarifier performance problems or excessive operational needs, or where site constraints 
dictate against addition of new structures (Sutton 2006).
7. operation problems
Although many results from research activities have been applied in these full-scale plants, lower 
membrane permeability than anticipated was observed in many actual operations. This indicates that 
results from bench or pilot scale experiment are not always correlated to the application in full-scale 
plants. Additional research on full-scale plants in long-term operation could provide valuable insight 
on this issue. Some problems detected in practical MBRs are listed below:
1.	 Bioreactor temperature impacting performance in cross flow MBR;
2.	 Entrained air impacting suction pump operation in cross flow MBR;
3.	 Membrane fouling due to build-up of oil grease in the bioreactor;
4.	 Membrane fouling during permeate back pulsing;
5.	 entrained air impacting suction-pump operation;
6.	 Bioreactor foaming;

Evaluation of MBR potentials
At present MBR treatment can be considered to be a proven technology for wastewater treatment. In the last 
15 years significantly progress has been made in the design and operation of MBR’s. One of the reasons is the 
availability of government funding, which has made it possible to conduct extensive research on a practical scale. 
An example is the research project at the Beverwijk WWTP in the Netherlands where membrane suppliers, 
engineering firms and water boards have worked together to test several pilot MBR systems during a two year 
period (2001–2002), with additional pilot plants tested afterwards. The main results of this project were increased 
reliability of operation, increased membrane life time, reduced energy cost and a better understanding of the 
nature, prevention and removal of membrane fouling (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).
Several hundreds of small (5–50 m3.h-1) industrial installations have been built from 1990 onwards in 
Europe and North America. Also in Japan a large number (>1000) of small industrial and municipal 
MBR’s have been constructed. However, large scale application of MBR to municipal waste water lagged 
behind due to the diluted nature of this waste water. From 1998 onwards, several municipal MBR’s have 
been constructed, sometimes as a demonstration project with practical governmental funding (van 
Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).
With membrane prices decreasing, MBR is becoming more competitive compared to conventional 
treatment, but still the number of municipal installation in use is very limited. The main reasons to 
implement a MBR instead of conventional activated sludge system are (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 
2007): 
1.	 Limited availability of space;
2.	 Strict effluent limits (i.e. discharge of effluent in a vulnerable area or possible reuse of 
effluent)
3.	 Difficulties for solid/liquid separation in the final settler.

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Disadvantages of the MBR process compared to a conventional system are (van Haandel and van der 
Lubbe 2007):
1.	 Increased investment and operation cost;
2.	 Increased complexity of the system, requiring skilled operation and a considerable amount 
of automation/ instrumentation;
3.	 Ecological considerations such as the use of chemicals for cleaning and the increased 
consumption of energy (greenhouse gas emission).
As long as the effluent from a municipal waste water treatment plant has to comply with effluent limits 
similar or less stringent to those currently applicable in the Netherlands (i.e. N<10 mg N L-1), P<1mg 
P L-1, and Xte=20 mg TSSL-1), treatment with conventional activated sludge systems will be sufficient 
and in many cases more competitive. For low strength municipal wastewater, annualised investment 
cost of an MBR system are stil about fifty percent higher than those of a conventional installation. This 
is not only due to the cost of installing (and replacing) the membrane. Other factors are the need for 
more extensive pretreament, a much higher degree of automation and higher energy requirments (van 
Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007). 
The cost difference might be reduced in the future, as the continuing competition between membrane 
suppliers might cause membraen prices to decrease further, and if land prices go up. For difficult and/
or high strength industrial wastwaters,MBR reactors are often already an attractive alternative, as in this 
case the cost fraction of the membrane part will be limited compared to that of the biological treatment 
volume (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).
Should stricter effluent limits be applied in the future, MBR will certainly become more attactive. This 
may be the case in Europe as a result of the EU water framework derective. In the period from 2000 to 
2015, the membrane states will have to increase the water quality of surface and ground water. This amy 
result in stricter effluent limits. However, MBR will then have to compete with other systems capable of 
delivering the required effluent quality such as conventional treatment followed by polishing steps such 
as sand filtration (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).
If the effluent of the wastewater treatmnet plant is to be resued as a high quality water source (e.g.as 
process water, boiler feed make-up water,cooling make up water or even potable water), once again the 
MBR is an attractive alternative,as an effluent free of solids is produced, which can be directly processed 
in downstream processing operation such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis (van Haandel and van 
der Lubbe 2007).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
Finally, if available space is limited, MBR might be very interesting as well. This may be the case for 
many industrial locations, but certainly also for minicipal wastewater treatment. In a large number of 
cities ini developing countris, the rapid expansion of the population has two main effects: 
1.	 the existing conventional wastewater treatment plants are overloaded and 
2.	 there will often be no space available for expansion of the wastewater treatment plant. 
Retrofitting the old conventional treatment plant into an MBR system increases treatment 
capacity by a factor of 3–4 without any additional space requriements (van Haandel and van 
der Lubbe 2007).
2.2.4	
Side stream MBR versus submerged MBR
As mentioned above, there are two configures of MBR applied in practise, i.e. submerged MBR and side 
stream MBR. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, which results in different application potentials. 
Relevant discussion is provided below.
1. Advantages of cross flow MBR compared to submerged MBR are (van Haandel and van  
der Lubbe 2007):
The investment costs of cross flow membranes are lower than those of submerged membranes, but the 
energy consumption of cross flow membranes is much higher. This is partly compensated by the energy 
required for the aeration of the submerged membranes. 
1.	 Superior operational reliability and significantly reduced vulnerability to membrane fouling, 
which makes application to difficult waste waters easier;
2.	 The performance of cross flow membranes is less dependent on sludge characteristics than 
that of submerged membranes;
3.	 Cross flow membranes are also much more robust than submerged membranes; this allows 
application at higher temperature (up to 60 oC) and also allows more intense cleaning;
4.	 Cross flow membranes are easily accessible, which facilitates maintenance;
5.	 External MBRs have maintained interest from the research community for specific 
application areas. This is apparent from Fig. 6, as a steady number of research papers 
(around 12 per year) were published on this configuration in the last 7 years. Many of these 
papers deal with particular industrial wastewater applications or study fundamental aspects 
related to cross-flow membrane filtration (Yang et al. 2006). External MBRs were considered 
to be more suitable for wastewater streams characterized by high temperature, high organic 
strength, extreme pH, high toxicity and low filterability. Studies on the treatment of 
municipal wastewater with MBRs mostly utilized the submerged configuration (Yang et al. 
2006);
6.	 Cross flow membranes are operated at a much higher differential pressure over the 
membrane (4–7 bar) than submerged membranes (0.1–0.4 bar);

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
7.	 Cross flow membranes may be operated at higher suspended solids concentration: 15–50 kg 
TSS.m-3, compared to 12–20 kg TSS.m-3 for submerged membranes. However, operating at 
such a high biomass concentration will cause other problems: the oxygen transfer rate can 
be a limiting factor and excessive foaming may become an issue. Sometimes pure oxygen is 
used for aeration when an MBR is operated at a very high biomass concentration.
2. Disadvantages of side stream MBR compared to submerged MBR
A disadvantage of cross flow MBR is that this configuration is less suitable to deal with large fluctuation 
in feed flow rate. Submerged membranes can be operated (temporarily) at a higher flux than their normal 
operating flux by simply increasing the flow rate of the permeate pump, although this will result in an 
increase in the differential pressure over the membranes. The operational flexibility of subered membrane 
systems is very convenient for MBR reactors treating highly variable flows such as municipal sewage 
with a high ratio between rainwater flow and dry weather flow (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).
Submerged MBRs have proven to be more cost- and energy-effective than tubular side-stream modules 
(Cornel and Krause 2008). Due to the absence of a high-flow recirculation pump, submerged MBRs 
consume much lower power than external MBRs. This was the primary driver for propelling submerged 
MBRs into the purview of large-scale wastewater treatment plants in a few dozens of countries around 
the world. In the last 3 years, many more studies were performed on submerged MBRs than external 
MBRs (Yang et al. 2006). The cost of oxygen demand is superior in MBR. Energy consumption of 
MBR comes from power requirements for pumping feed water, recycling retentate; permeate suction 
(occasionally) and aeration. The two MBR configurations have substantial differences in terms of aeration. 
In the side-stream configuration, aeration is supplied by fine bubble aerators that are highly efficient for 
supplying oxygen to the biomass. In submerged MBRs, the aeration mode is turbulent and cross-flow is 
generated, which scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass. Aeration cost in the 
latter-mentioned configuration represents around 90% of the total costs, whereas in side-stream MBR, 
only~20% derives from it. However, energy consumption of the side-stream system is usually two orders 
of magnitude higher than that of submerged systems. These low costs of submerged MBRs are associated 
with low fluxes, which in turn increase capital costs and footprints. Also, packing density influences 
the final cost of MBR: low packing densities of membrane modules mean that higher specific area of 
membrane is required to produce the same flux, which increases the energy requirements (Radjenović 
et al. 2008).
Submerged membranes are operated in a constant flux variable pressure mode: i.e. the differential pressure 
over the membrane increases in time due to fouling of the membrane surface, while the membrane flux 
remains constant (as it is set by the permeate pump capacity). For cross flow membrane this is exactly 
the opposite: the applied pressure remains the same but the membrane flux decreases in time (due to 
fouling).

certainly be considered an attractive alternative to submerged MBR for small scale application (up to an 
influent flow of 10–20 m3/h) treating difficult wastewater waters (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007).

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
2.2.5	
Commercialized MBR Formats
The sidestream approaches are also divided into two formats – the long-established traditional method 
of cross flow, now used only for the most difficult feeds, and the newer concept of airlift, which uses 
air to recirculate the feed and thereby significantly reduces energy demand. Both sidestream formats 
use tubular membranes. Cross flow is more energy intensive – very high cross-flow velocities (up to 
5–6 m3 /h) may be necessary to control the fouling; but for the more difficult feeds, it may be the only 
option that works reliably. Airlift is a more cost-effective way of improving mass transfer through the 
creation of slug-flow conditions in the lumen of the membrane tubes, but there is a limit to how much 
air flow can be used while retaining slug-flow conditions. Airlift technology has a power cost similar to 
that of the submerged technology. As mentioned earlier, the energy cost of cross flow prohibits it as a 
treatment option for any application other than small scale or where there is no other treatment option. 
However, the airlift has very low energy use, and may even undercut the energy requirements of the 
submerged options, due to the advantage of containment of the feed inside the tubular membrane. Since 
airlift eliminates operator contact and has good operational characteristics, it may as well make a major 
impact on the MBR market in the long run. It was argued that the airlift format may find applications 
throughout a broader range than the submerged formats (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

Membrane Bioreactor for Wastewater Treatment

Introduction of membrane bioreactor
The submerged format is available with modules either in a flat-sheet configuration or as hollow fibers 
or capillary membranes. Originally, the favoured concept was to submerge the modules directly into the 
bioreactor for simplicity. However, in order to gain better control of the balance between the biological 
and filtration-treatment capacity, it is now more common to use the membrane in an external membrane 
tank. The external arrangement allows the size and design of the membrane tank to be optimized 
independently, with practical advantages for operation and maintenance (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
In general, submerged MBR formats based on hollow fibers have been found to provide the most 
cost-effective solution for large-scale, easy-to-treat applications. Technology has been developed with 
optimized packing density and aeration bubble size to achieve stable performance at minimum energy 
use. However, this format can experience operational difficulties due to fibers becoming matted close to 
the potted ends and therefore pre-treatment and removal of hairs and fibers is essential. Hollow-fiber 
technology hence requires more instrumentation and control (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
The submerged MBR formats based on flat sheets have been found to be cost effective for similar types of 
wastewater, but due to higher air use and lower compactness, tend to be selected for small- to medium-
scale duties. The flat-sheet format has operational advantages in terms of plugging and cleaning, and 
has been used in somewhat more difficult feeds. Flat-sheet systems have the advantage of relatively low 
manufacturing cost compared to hollow-fiber systems. However, packing density tends to be significantly 
lower than a hollow-fiber system (e.g., by a factor of 2.5–3 times). Therefore, flat-sheet systems tend to 
have a cost advantage for small to medium-scale systems, whereas hollow fiber becomes more attractive 
at large scale due to the footprint advantage. The comparison is made more complicated, however, since 
aeration costs for hollow-fiber systems are often lower (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
This means that the most cost-effective solution for total treatment costs at medium scale is closely 
contested, and both approaches are found across the size range due to site-specific circumstances, which 
could favour either solution. It is estimated that a future market share could be as follows: 
1.	 For municipal applications, it is expected that the hollow-fiber submerged configuration 
would be competitive for medium to large-size plants.
2.	 For small to medium sizes, flat-sheet technologies would have an advantage. However, 
in case of larger plants, or a plant refurbishment, the alternative membrane scheme 
(secondary/tertiary treatment followed by an MF/UF membrane filtration) is very likely 
to be cost competitive, unless high-cost land has to be purchased for the construction. 
This multi-barrier scheme will also be easier to control and to optimize because of the 
disconnection of the treatment steps. It will also be associated with the lowest risk in 
relation to the membrane operation, as the membranes will be operated under smooth 
hydrodynamic conditions in terms of particle matter, turbulence, and backwash regime. The 
airlift format has been developed as a low-energy alternative to the energy-intensive cross-
flow sidestream format, which has been used historically for the most difficult feeds (Hai 
and Yamamoto 2011).

reduction
The aim of this chapter is introduce the main problem regarding the operation of membrane bioreactor, 
i.e. membrane fouling and its control method
3.1	
Membrane Fouling
3.1.1	
Membrane fouling phenomena
Although MBR has become a reliable alternative to CAS processes and an option of choice for many 
domestic and industrial applications, membrane fouling and its consequences in terms of plant 
maintenance and operating costs limit the widespread application of MBRs. Membrane fouling can be 
defined as the undesirable deposition and accumulation of microorganisms, colloids, solutes, and cell 
debris within pores or on membrane surface (Meng et al. 2009). It results from the interaction between 
the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological 
flocs formed by a large range of living microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. 
Thus, it is not surprising that the fouling behaviour in MBRs is more complicated than that in most 
membrane applications. The suspended biomass has no fixed composition and varies with both feed 
water composition and MBR operating conditions employed. Accordingly, although many investigations 
of membrane fouling have been published, the diverse range of operating conditions and feed water 
matrices employed, and the limited information reported in most studies on the biomass composition 
in suspension or on the membrane, have made it difficult to establish any generic behaviour pertaining 
to membrane fouling in MBRs (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3.1.2	
Classifications of membrane fouling
1. Pore blockage and cake layer formation 
During initial filtration, colloids, solutes, and microbial cells pass through and deposit inside the 
membrane pores. However, during the long-term operation of MBRs, the deposited cells multiply and 
yield extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which clog the pores and form a strongly attached fouling 
layer. Chemical cleaning is usually required to remove such fouling (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
The formation of a cake layer which can be described as a porous media with a complex system of 
interconnected inter-particle voids has been reported as the major contributor to membrane fouling in 
MBRs. Such fouling is usually physically removable (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
The formation of pore blockage and cake layer can increase filtration resistance.

According to whether membrane fouling can be removed, the membrane fouling can also be classified

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Membran e fouli ng and  its reductio
As shown in figure. 3.1, the removable fouling can be easily eliminated by implementation of physical 
cleaning (e.g., backwashing) while the irremovable fouling needs chemical cleaning. The removable 
fouling is caused by loosely attached foulants; however, irremovable fouling is caused by pore blocking and 
strongly attached foulants during filtration. In general, removable fouling is attributed to the formation 
of cake layer, and the irremovable fouling is attributed to pore blocking (Meng et al. 2009).
MBR are normally operated under a constant flux. Since the fouling rate increases roughly and 
exponentially with the flux, MBR plants are operated at modest fluxes and preferably below the so-called 
critical flux. The critical flux concept assumes that there is a flux below which a decline of permeability 
with time does not occur, and above which fouling occurs. In MBR operations, critical flux is normally 
defined as the highest flux under which a prolonged filtration with constant permeability is possible. 
Critical flux is often determined by the flux step method, in which the flux is incrementally increased in 
number of steps with fixed duration, and the increase in TMP is recorded. It is then possible to observe 
the apparent flux where fouling occurs, which is observed as a significant TMP increase (Radjenović et 
al. 2008).
3. Biofouling, organic fouling, and inorganic fouling
A definition is based on fouling components. The fouling in MBRs can be classified into three major 
categories: biofouling, organic fouling, and inorganic fouling, although, in general, all of them occur 
simultaneously during membrane filtration of activated sludge. 
Biofouling
Biofouling refers to the deposition, growth, and metabolism of bacteria cells or flocs on the membranes. 
Biofouling may start with the deposition of individual cell or cell cluster on the membrane surface, after 
which the cells multiply and form a biofilm (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Organic fouling
Organic fouling in MBRs refers to the deposition of biopolymers on membrane surface. Due to their 
small sizes, soluble biopolymers deposit onto membranes readily in comparison to large particles (e.g., 
colloids and sludge flocs). Powerful analytical tools have confirmed that soluble microbial product (SMP) 
or EPS is the origin of organic fouling in MBR. Inorganic elements such as Mg, Al, Fe, Ca, Si, etc. and 
metals can enhance the formation of biofouling and organic fouling, and can together form a recalcitrant 
cake layer (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

Inorganic fouling
In general, membrane fouling in MBRs is mainly governed by biofouling and organic fouling rather 
than by inorganic fouling, although all of them take place simultaneously during membrane filtration of 
activated sludge. On inorganic membranes inorganic fouling may occur more easily. In general, a cake 
of inorganic matter can be irremovable due to the cohesive properties. Sometimes, the fouling caused 
by inorganic scaling is not easy to be eliminated even by chemical cleaning (Meng et al. 2009).
The inorganic fouling can form through two ways: chemical precipitation and biological precipitation. 
A great number of cations and anions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Fe3+, CO3
2-, SO4 2-, PO4
3-, OH- and others 
are present in MBRs. Concentration polarisation will lead to higher concentration of retained salts 
on the membrane surface. Chemical precipitation occurs when the concentration of chemical species 
exceeds the saturation concentrations due to concentration polarisation. Additionally, the fouling layer 
on membranes can protect the surface layer from shear stress as biofilm or biocake is elastic in nature 
leading to greater concentration polarisation and precipitation of inorganics. Carbonates are one kind of 
the predominant salts in inorganic fouling. The aeration and the CO2 produced by microorganisms can 
affect the super-saturation of carbonates and the pH of the sludge suspension. The carbonates of metals 
such as Ca, Mg, and Fe can increase the potential of membrane scaling (Meng et al. 2009).
Biological precipitation is another contribution to inorganic fouling. The biopolymers contain ionisable 
groups such as COO-, CO3
2-, SO4
2-, PO4
3-, OH-. Metal ions can be easily captured by these negative 
ions. In some cases, calcium and acidic functional groups (R–COOH) can form complexes and build a 
dense bio-cake layer or gel layer that may exacerbate flux decline. When the metal ions in treated water 
pass through the membranes, they could be caught by the bio-cake layer via complexing and charge 
neutralisation and then accelerate membrane fouling. Metal ions play a significant role in the formation 
of fouling layers, which can bridge the deposited cells and biopolymers and then form a dense cake layer. 
There exists a synergistic interaction among biofouling, organic fouling and inorganic fouling (Meng 
et al. 2009).
3.1.3	
Long term fouling development 
It is evident that even sub-critical operation inevitably leads to fouling. This fouling is often reported to 
follow a two-stage fouling pattern, which includes slow TMP increase over a long period of time, followed 
by a rapid increase after some critical time period. Fouling in MBR under sub-critical conditions three 
stages include (Radjenović et al. 2008): 
1.	 Initial conditioning fouling
2.	 Slow fouling
3.	 Sudden TMP jump

TMP Jump
Figure 3.2 schematic illustration of the occurrence of TMP jump (Meng et al. 2009).
Initial fouling takes place between the membrane surface and soluble components of a mixed liquor. This 
fouling is usually rapid (measured in hours. In the second stage, slow fouling, the membrane surface is 
gradually covered by biopolymers such as EPS, which changes the properties of the membrane surface 
and makes attachment of the microbial flocs to the membrane surface easier. Thus, biofilm growth on 
the membrane surface may be promoted. Over time, complete or partial pore blocking takes place. This 
blocking is expected to be inhomogeneous since the air and the liquid flow are distributed unevenly in 
MBR. With regions of membrane more fouled than others, flux locally varies, thus exceeding the critical 
flux in some areas of the membrane surface, which then leads to a sudden TMP jump characteristic for 
operation above the critical flux. The other explanation for the sudden TMP jump may be the change of 
properties of the fouling cake on the membrane surface due to its compression (Radjenović et al. 2008). 
Figure 3.2 shows the schematic illustration of the occurrence of TMP jump.

It can be concluded that the interactions between TMP jump and these operating parameters are very 
complex, and TMP jump occurs inevitably during long-term operation of MBRs. Thus, the overall goal 
of fouling control is to retard the occurrence of the TMP jump via modifying sludge characteristics or 
decreasing membrane flux (e.g., operation below critical flux) (Meng et al. 2009).

Parameters influencing MBR fouling
All the parameters involved in the design and operation of MBR processes have impacts on membrane 
fouling. While some of these parameters have a direct influence on MBR fouling, many others result 
in subsequent effects on phenomena exacerbating fouling propensity. However, three main categories 
of factors can be identified – membrane and module characteristics, feed and biomass parameters, and 
operating conditions (Hai and Yamamoto 2011). Figure 3.3 summarize a number of factors that can 
influence the membrane fouling. The factors will be further briefly discussed below.

1. Membrane characteristics
1)	 Physical parameters
• Pore size and distribution
Studies revealed that the pore size alone could not predict hydraulic performances. The effects 
of pore size (and distribution of pore size) on membrane fouling are strongly related to the 
feed solution characteristics and in particular the particle size distribution. The complex and 
changing nature of the biological suspension present in MBR systems and the large pore-size 
distribution of the membrane generally used in MBR systems are the main reasons for the 
undefined general dependency of the flux propensity on pore size. It is generally expected that 
smaller-pore membranes would reject a wider range of materials, and the resulting cake layer 
would feature a higher resistance compared to large-pore membranes. However, this type of 
fouling is easily removed during the maintenance cleaning than fouling due to internal pore 
clogging obtained in larger-pore membrane systems. The chemically removable fouling, due 
to the deposition of organic and inorganic materials onto and into the membrane pores, is 
the main cause of the poor long term performances of larger pore-size membranes. However, 
the opposite trend is sometimes reported. The duration of the experiment and other operating 
parameters such as cross-flow velocity and constant pressure or constant flux operation have a 
direct influence on the determination of the optimization of the membrane pore size and are 
responsible for contradictory reports in the literature (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
• Porosity/roughness. 
Membrane roughness and porosity along with membrane microstructure, material, and 
pore-size distribution were suggested as potential reasons for the different observed fouling 
behaviours. For instance, a track-etched membrane, with its dense structure and small but 
uniform cylindrical pores, featured the lowest resistance due to pore fouling in contrast to the 
other membranes having interwoven sponge-like highly porous network. Other studies have 
pointed out the importance of pore-aspect ratio (mean major-axis length/mean minor-axis 
length) or roughness on fouling in an MBR (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

• Membrane configuration. 
In submerged MBR processes, the membrane can be configured as vertical flat plates, vertical 
or horizontal hollow fine fibers (filtration from out to in) or, more rarely as tubes (filtration 
from in to out). Each of hollow-fiber and flat-sheet membrane types has specific footprint and 
air scouring and chemical cleaning requirement, which may favour one process over another 
for a given application. Nevertheless, hollow-fiber modules are generally more economical to 
manufacture, provide high specific membrane area, and can tolerate vigorous backwashing. 
For low-flux operation, hollow fibers are attractive due to their high packing density. A higher 
fiber-packing density would increase productivity; however, increasing the packing density may 
lead to severe interstitial blockage due to the impeded propagation of air bubbles toward the 
core, limiting their effect on fouling limitation (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

2)	 Chemical parameters.
• Hydrophobicity. 
The influence of the membrane hydrophobicity on the early stage of the fouling formation may 
be significant; however, this parameter is expected to play only a minor role during extended 
filtration periods in MBRs. Once initially fouled, the membrane’s chemical characteristics 
would become secondary to those of the sludge materials covering the membrane surface. 
Nevertheless, because of the hydrophobic interactions occurring between solutes, microbial 
cells and membrane material, membrane fouling is expected to be more severe with hydrophobic 
rather than hydrophilic membranes, although different results have also been reported. In many 
reported studies, change in membrane hydrophobicity often occurs with other membrane 
modifications such as pore size and morphology, which make the correlation between 
membrane hydrophobicity and fouling more difficult to assess (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
• Materials. 
The large majority of the membranes used in MBRs are polymeric based. A direct comparison 
between polyethylene (PE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes clearly indicated 
that the latter leads to a better prevention of physically irremovable fouling and that PE 
membrane fouled more quickly. Although featuring superior chemical, thermal, and hydraulic 
resistances, ceramic and stainless steel membrane modules are not the preferred option for 
MBR applications due to their high cost (around an order of magnitude more expensive than 
the polymeric materials) (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
2. Feed–biomass characteristics.
1)	 Nature of feed and concentration
Fouling in the MBR is mostly affected by the interactions between the membrane and the 
biological suspension rather than wastewater itself. Nevertheless, the fouling propensity of 
the wastewater has to be indirectly taken into consideration during the characterization of the 
biomass, as the wastewater nature can significantly influence the physicochemical changes in 
the biological suspensions, which in turn may aggravate fouling (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

2)	 Biomass fractionation. 
Although the relatively low fouling role played by the suspended solids (biofloc and the 
attached EPS) compared to those of the soluble and colloids (generally defined as soluble 
microbial products or SMP) is usually reported, the reported relative contribution of the 
SMP to overall membrane fouling ranges from 17% to 81%. These wide discrepancies may 
be explained by the different operating conditions and biological states of the suspension 
used in the reported studies. Although an interesting approach for studying MBR fouling, the 
fractionation experiments neglect any coupling or synergistic effects which may occur among 
the different components of the biomass (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3)	 MLSS concentration. 
Although the increase in MLSS concentration has often been reported to have a mostly negative 
impact on the MBR hydraulic performances, controversies exist. The existence of threshold 
values above or below which the MLSS concentration has a negative influence was also reported. 
Figure 3.4 depicts the influence of shift in MLSS concentration on flux as reported in different 
studies. Nowadays, information on additional biomass characteristics (e.g., composition and 
concentration of EPS) is deemed necessary to furnish a comprehensive picture. On the other 
hand, it was shown that the extent of fouling was independent of MLSS concentration itself, 
and was rather more influenced by the efficiency of the fouling prevention strategies adopted 
(Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

4)	 Viscosity. 
The importance of MLSS viscosity is that it modifies bubble size and can dampen the movement 
of hollow fibers in submerged bundles. The net result of this phenomenon would be a greater 
rate of fouling. Increased viscosity also reduces the efficiency of mass transfer of oxygen and 
can therefore affect DO; fouling, as discussed later, tends to be worse at low DO. Critical MLSS 
concentrations have been reported in the literature above which, suspension viscosity tends to 
increase exponentially with the solid concentration (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
5)	 Temperature. 
Temperature may impact membrane filtration by increasing fluid viscosity, causing 
deflocculation of biomass and higher EPS secretion, reducing biodegradation rate, etc (Hai 
and Yamamoto 2011).

6)	 Dissolved oxygen. 
The effects of DO on MBR fouling are multiple and may include changes in biofilm structure, SMP 
levels, and floc-size distribution. The average level of DO in the bioreactor is controlled by the 
aeration rate, which not only provides oxygen to the biomass but also tends to limit fouling formation 
on the membrane surface. Optimum aeration would result in lower specific cake resistance of the 
fouling layer featuring larger particle sizes and greater porosity. Therefore, in general, higher DO 
tends to lead to better filterability, and lower fouling rate (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
7)	 Floc size
The floc-size distribution obtained with the MBR sludge is lower than the results generally 
obtained from conventional activated sludge plants. Unlike in CAS systems, the effective 
separation of suspended biomass from the treated water is not critically dependent on 
aggregation of the microorganisms, and the formation of large floc. However, independent of 
their size, biological floc play a major role in the secretion of EPS and formation of the fouling 
cake on the membrane surface (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
It is generally accepted that fouling caused by suspended solids is less than that of supernatant. 
With regards to the fouling mechanism, it is generally assumed that soluble and colloid 
materials are responsible for pore blocking, while suspended solids contribute mainly to 
cake layer resistance. Again, one has to be aware of the fact that biomass itself is responsible 
for a composition of soluble and colloid material in the liquid phase, and that composition 
of supernatant is a function of the physiological state of the suspended phase, i.e., biomass 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).

8)	 Extracellular polymeric substances.
The term EPS is used as a general and comprehensive concept for different classes of 
macromolecules such as polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, (phosphor-) lipids, and 
other polymeric compounds which have been found at, or outside, the cell surface and in the 
intercellular space of microbial aggregates. EPS are the construction materials for microbial 
aggregates such as biofilms, flocs, and activated sludge liquors. The functions of EPS matrix 
are multiple and include aggregation of bacterial cells in flocs and biofilms, formation of a 
protective barrier around the bacteria, retention of water, and adhesion to surfaces. With 
its heterogeneous and changing nature, EPS can form a highly hydrated gel matrix in which 
microbial cells are embedded. Therefore, they can be responsible for the creation of a significant 
barrier to permeate flow in the membrane processes. Contemporary literature is replete with 
reports identifying EPS as a major fouling parameter. On the other hand, since the EPS matrix 
plays a major role in the hydrophobic interactions among microbial cells and thus in the floc 
formation, it was proposed that a decrease in EPS levels may cause floc deterioration and may be 
detrimental for the MBR performances. This indicates the existence of an optimum EPS level for 
which floc structure is maintained without featuring high fouling propensity. Many parameters 
including gas sparging, substrate composition, and loading rate affect EPS characteristics in the 
MBR, but SRT probably remains the most significant of them. A functional relationship between 
specific resistance, mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), TMP, and permeate viscosity, 
and EPS is believed to exist (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3. Operation conditions
1)	 Aeration, cross-flow velocity
Since the origin of the MBR, bubbling has been defined as the strategy of choice to induce flow 
circulation and shear stress on the membrane surface. Aeration used in MBR systems has three 
major roles: providing oxygen to the biomass, maintaining the activated sludge in suspension, 
and mitigating fouling by constant scouring of the membrane surface. However, an optimum 
aeration rate, beyond which a further increase has no significant effect on fouling suppression, 
has been observed on many occasions. It is also important to note that too intense an aeration 
rate may damage the floc structure reducing their size, and release EPS into the bioreactor, and 
thereby aggravate fouling (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

2)	 Solid retention time
SRT, which greatly controls biomass characteristics, is regarded as the most important operating 
parameter influencing fouling propensity in MBRs. Considering the advantages of this process 
over the conventional activated sludge process, the early MBRs were typically run at very long 
SRTs to minimize excess sludge. But unlike in bench-scale studies employing simpler synthetic 
feed, the progressive accumulation of non-biodegradable materials (such as hair and lint) in 
an MBR fed with real sewage definitely leads to clogging of the membrane module.
Operating an MBR at higher SRT leads inevitably to increase of MLSS concentration. The 
increase in aeration intensity to retain high MLSS levels in suspension and maintain proper 
oxygenation may not be a sustainable option for the treatment process. In this scenario, the 
increased shear provided to control fouling could cause biofloc deterioration as well as cell 
lysis and enhanced EPS secretion, and lead to fatal fouling. On the other hand, at infinite 
SRT, most of the substrate is consumed to ensure the maintenance needs and the synthesis of 
storage products. The very low apparent net biomass generation observed can explain the low 
fouling propensity observed for high SRT operation in certain studies. It is likely that there is 
an optimal SRT, between the high fouling tendency of very low SRT operation and the high 
viscosity suspension prevalent for very long SRT (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

3)	 Unsteady state operation
In practical applications, unsteady state conditions such as variations in operating conditions 
(flow input/HRT and organic load) and shifts in oxygen supply could occur regularly. The 
start-up phase can also be considered as unsteady operation and data collected before biomass 
stabilization (including the period necessary to reach acclimatization) may become relevant 
in the design of MBRs. Such unsteady state conditions have also been defined as additional 
factors leading to changes in MBR fouling propensity. For instance, the addition of a spike of 
acetate in the feed water significantly decreased the filterability of the biomass in an MBR due 
to the rise in SMP levels resulting from the feed spike (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3.2	
Membrane fouling reduction methods
The complex interactions between the fouling parameters complicate the perception of MBR fouling and it 
is therefore crucial to have a complete understanding of the biological, chemical, and physical phenomena 
occurring in MBRs to assess fouling propensity and mechanisms and thereby formulate mitigation strategies. 
As membrane fouling increases with increasing flux in all membrane separation processes, the operating 
flux should be lower than the critical flux. When the operating flux is below the critical flux, particle 
accumulation in the region of membranes can be effectively prevented. However, due to physicochemical 
solute-membrane material interactions, the membrane permeability decreases over time, even when MBRs 
are operated in subcritical (below critical flux) conditions (Hai and Yamamoto 2011). Some approaches, 
that can be used to reduce membrane fouling during MBR operation, are briefly discussed below.
3.2.1	
Membrane modification
1. Optimization of membrane characteristics
Many studies have shown that chemical modifications of membrane surface can efficiently improve 
antifouling properties. Recent examples comprise (1) increasing membrane hydrophilicity by NH3 and 
CO2 plasma treatments and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, (2) TiO2 entrapped membrane, and (3) applying 
precoating of TiO2, GAC, ferric hydroxide, polyvinylidene fluoride-graft-polyoxyethylene methacrylated 
(PVDF-g- POEM), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), etc. Improved performance in case of precoated membrane 
has been attributed to the adsorption of soluble organics on the precoat, limiting the direct contact 
between the organics and the membrane. Self-forming dynamic membrane-coupled bioreactors, utilizing 
coarse pore-sized substrates and allowing cake and gel layers to deposit on the surface, have been reported 
to obtain high flux and good removal in certain studies, although stable performance cannot be expected 
with such a filtration barrier (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

2. Membrane module design
The membrane module design by optimizing the packing density of hollow fibers or flat sheets, the 
location of aerators, the orientation of fibers, and diameters of fibers remains another important parameter 
in the optimization of the MBR operation. In a specially designed module in which air bubbles were 
confined in close proximity to the hollow fiber (rather than diffusing in the reactor), higher permeability 
was obtained. Two major design approaches are adopted in case of the commercially available hollow-
fiber bundles. One of these approaches relies on partitioning of bundles of fibers, which are fixed at both 
ends, to secure flow path of air bubbles introduced from the centre of the bundle at the base, thereby 
leading sludge out of the module. In another approach, bundle of one-end free fibers are allowed to 
float freely under the scouring action of air bubbles introduced from the core of the bundle to avoid 
accumulation of sludge. In order to utilize high packing density without encountering severe fouling, 
a new approach to hollow-fiber module design was explored by. Spacer was introduced within usual 
hollow-fiber bundles with the aim of minimizing the intrusion of sludge into the module. The little 
amount of intruded sludge was then backwashed through the bottom end, while the sludge deposited on 
the surface was effectively cleaned by air scouring. In this way, efficient utilization of cleaning solution 
and air for backwashing and surface cleaning, respectively, were possible. Recent approaches such as 
novel fiber sheet membrane, multi-module flat-sheet concept, and vacuum rotation membrane are also 
noticeable (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3.2.2	
Optimization of operation conditions. 
1. Aeration
As mentioned earlier, bubbling is an established strategy to induce flow circulation and shear stress on 
the membrane surface. The aeration intensity (air/permeate ratio, m3/m3) applied by MBR suppliers may 
vary between 24 and 50, depending on the membrane configuration (flat sheet vs. hollow fiber) and 
the MBR tank design (whether the membrane and aerobic zone combined into a single tank or not). 
However, recent large-scale studies revealed these original ratios are quite conservative. The specific 
design of bubble size, airflow rate and patterns, and location of aerators have been defined as crucial 
parameters in fouling mitigation. As the energy involved in providing aeration to the membrane remains 
a significant cost factor in MBR design. Therefore, the optimization of aeration both from the points of 
view of fouling mitigation and reducing energy requirement should be done. Recent developments in 
aeration design include cyclic aeration systems, intermittent aeration, air pulsing , air sparging, improved 
aerator systems, etc (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

2. Back flushing
Cleaning protocol has been studied intensively by many researchers where the key parameters of interest 
are duration and frequency of the cleaning and the back-flush flux. Less frequent, longer back-flushing 
(600 s filtration/45 s back-flushing) has been found to be more efficient then more frequent but shorter 
back-flushing (200s filtration/15 s back-flush). Membrane relaxation, which is the most common practice 
for fouling control, encourages the diffusive back-transport of foulants away from the membrane surface, 
which is enhanced by air scouring. Relaxation allows longer filtration periods between chemical cleanings, 
and despite some reports that it may not be a feasible practice for large-scale MBRs, it is widely used in 
practice. Although intensive research has been done on this subject, membrane fouling in MBRs needs 
further attention in order to understand the complex interactions among biologically active and constantly 
changing filtration media, hydrodynamic conditions of the filtration process, and the membrane itself 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).

3.2.3	
Modification of biomass characteristics.
1. Coagulant/flocculant. 
Due to back transport and shear induced fouling control mechanisms, large microbial flocs 
are expected to have a lower impact on membrane fouling. Based on this expectation, studies 
have explored addition of coagulants such as alum, ferric chloride, zeolite, etc. and have shown 
permeability enhancement. Pre-treatment of the effluent is also possible and studies based on 
the pre-coagulation/ sedimentation of effluent before its introduction in the bioreactor revealed 
the fouling limitation offered by this technique (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
A cationic polymer-based membrane performance enhancer (MPE 50) has been commercialized 
by Nalco recently. The interaction between the polymer and the soluble organics was reported 
as the main mechanism responsible for performance enhancement. The potential impacts of 
coagulants or adsorbents on biomass community or biomass metabolism need to be taken into 
account, and the discharge of some chemicals that are used as coagulants or adsorbents might 
be a potential environmental risk. Such flux enhancers are probably best suited for solving 
occasional upsets rather than their continuous addition (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
2. Adsorbent/flux enhancers
Lower fouling propensity is observed in MBR processes when biomass is mixed with adsorbents in that 
addition of adsorbents into biological treatment systems decreases the level of pollutants, and more 
particularly organic compounds. In view of saturation of PAC during long term studies, researchers have 
suggested periodic addition of PAC. Certain studies have proposed pre-flocculation and PAC addition 
(Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
3.3	
Membrane cleaning
Physical cleaning in MBRs is normally achieved either by back-flushing or by relaxation (stopping the 
permeate flow and continuing to scour the membrane with air bubbles). Physical cleaning is a simple 
and short method (usually lasting less than 2 min) of fouling suppression which demands no chemicals 
and generally it is less likely that it will affect the membrane material. The latest published data on the 
cleaning regime of full-scale plants suggests that presently most of MBR facilities use relaxation rather 
than back flushing. However, by means of physical cleaning it is not possible to remove all the material 
deposited on the membrane (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

Chemical cleaning is a more effective method, which is able to remove more strongly the adsorbed 
deposits. Chemical cleaning is carried out mostly with sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide 
for organic deposits removal, or with acidic solutions for removal of lime or other inorganic deposits. 
Cleaning is performed by soaking the membrane in the cleaning solution or by adding the cleaning agent 
into the back flush water. Most MBRs employ chemical maintenance cleaning on a weekly basis, which 
lasts 30–60 min, and recovery cleaning when filtration is no longer sustainable, which occurs once or 
twice a year (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
The effectiveness of physical cleaning tends to decrease with operation time as more recalcitrant fouling 
accumulates on the membrane surface. Therefore, in addition to physical cleaning, different types/
intensities of chemical cleaning are applied in practice. A combination of the following types of cleaning 
is usually applied (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Maintenance cleaning with moderate chemical concentration (weekly) is applied to maintain design 
permeability and it helps to reduce the frequency of intense cleaning. This may be replaced by a more 
frequent (e.g., on a daily basis) chemically enhanced backwash utilizing mild chemical concentration. 
• Intensive (or recovery) chemical cleaning (once or twice a year) is generally carried out when further 
filtration is no longer sustainable because of an elevated TMP (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
The MBR suppliers propose their own chemical cleaning recipes, which differ mainly in terms of 
concentration and methods, and often site-specific protocols are followed. Mainly, sodium hypochlorite 
(for organic foulants) and citric acid (for inorganics) are used as chemical agents (Hai and Yamamoto 
2011).
Some pitfalls of chemical cleaning are worth noting. The detrimental effect of cleaning chemicals 
on biological performance has been reported. It has also been mentioned that the level of pollutants 
(measured as total organic carbon ) in the permeate rises just after the chemical cleaning step. This 
raises concern especially in case of MBRs used in the reclamation process trains (e.g., upstream of RO). 
Chemical cleaning may also shorten the membrane lifetime and disposal of spent chemical agents causes 
environmental problems (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

rejection of a significant amount of soluble organic molecules and colloids makes their removal more 
effective due to a higher lyses activity in the reactor induced by elevated concentrations of these 
compounds. Higher sludge ages that are achieved by long SRTs allow more complete mineralization 
of biodegradable raw water organics, but also an adaptation of microorganisms to less biodegradable 
compounds. Therefore, biomass can acclimatize to wastewater without being restricted to fast-growing 
and floc-forming microorganisms (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Biological  performanc e of membr ane bioreactor
Better performance of MBR operated at long SRTs can also be explained by the presence of dispersed 
bacteria that are advantageous in the overall population competition when substrate concentration 
becomes very low, i.e., at low F/M ratio and high sludge age. Flocs in a bioreactor were found to be 
smaller, which can explain enhanced mass transfer for both oxygen and carbon, thus enabling a higher 
removal rate and more adaptability to changes in the influent quality and quantity. In another study it 
was demonstrated that the flocs were more active and displayed greater species diversity (Radjenović 
et al. 2008).
The overall capacity of biomass to degrade different carbon substrates does not change significantly at 
different SRTs, which confirms that MBR is capable of degrading a wide variety of carbon substrates in a 
similar fashion. This robustness of MBR treatment regarding turbidity and organic matter removals was 
confirmed in several studies. In another study, in spite of large fluctuations in the influent, COD effluent 
COD was always low and extremely stable, because upon the addition of organic substrates, biomass 
responded immediately with increased respiration activity. It is assumed that there is an upper limit 
for organic loading rate in an MBR under which degradation performance is independent of biomass 
concentration and organic loading rate (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Concerning turbidity removal, due to a complete retention of particulate matter by the membrane, 
there are no suspended solids found in the MBR effluent, unlike the effluent of a conventional process. 
The UF/MF membrane can capture all SS in the reactor because of its fine pore size. Therefore, non-
biodegradable organic compounds are removed through filtration of particulates and discharged with 
the sludge (Radjenović et al. 2008).
4.2	
Nitrification/Denitrification and Phosphorus Removal
An irrational use of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides and the discharge of incompletely treated 
industrial and municipal wastewater results in high nitrogen and phosphate concentration in surface 
water and groundwater. This enrichment usually leads to an excessive eutrophication of lakes and other 
water bodies, promoting an excessive growth of certain weedy species. Since both nitrates and phosphates 
are rate-limiting for the process of eutrophication (extraordinary growth of algae), their removal is of 
crucial importance for successful wastewater treatment. Nitrate and nitrite-contaminated water supplies 
are also related to several diseases such as methemoglobinemia occurring in infants, also called ‘blue 
baby disease’. Moreover, these two compounds can induce mutations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), 
causing gastric cancer (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Biological nitrification is an oxic process of conversion of ammonia to nitrite (NO2) and then to 
nitrate (NO3
-). Following nitrification, nitrogen can be removed from wastewater by reducing nitrate to 
nitrogen gas (N2) in the process of anoxic denitrification. Because of the low growth rate and poor cell 
yield of nitrifying bacteria, nitrification is generally a rate-limiting step in biological nitrogen removal 
performance. The key requirement for nitrification to occur is that the net rate of accumulation of 
biomass (and hence the net rate of withdrawal of biomass from the system) is less than the growth rate 
of nitrifying bacteria. Long SRTs applied in MBR prevent nitrifying bacteria from being washed out 
from the bioreactor, improving the nitrification capability of the activated sludge. Moreover, nitrifiers 
are less endangered by faster-growing heterotrophic bacteria, which are better competitors for the 
ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). Many studies have proven that MBR can operate as a high-rate nitrifying 
technology that can be applied in the nitrification of wastewater containing a high concentration of 
ammonia nitrogen. Chiemchaisri and Muller found that more than 80% of the influent total Kjeldahl 
nitrogen (TKN) could be nitrified to NO3
- in an MBR. On the other hand, the denitrification process 
requires anoxic conditions in order to occur. To enhance denitrification, usually an anoxic tank is added 
upstream from the aerated tank. Anoxic conditions can also be introduced by operating MBR in an 
intermittent aeration mode, even when regarding submerged MBR, which needs permanent bubbling. 
In the intermittently aerated MBR, ammonium is nitrified mostly to nitrate and most phosphates are 
removed during the aerobic period (aeration), where the accumulated nitrate is completely denitrified 
during the anoxic period (non-aeration), and phosphorus (P) is taken up. The net P removal is achieved 
by wasting sludge after the aerobic period when the biomass contains a high level of polyphosphates 
(polyP) (Radjenović et al. 2008).
P is found in wastewater as phosphates (orthophosphates, condensed phosphates, organic phosphate 
fractions), and it can be eliminated either by precipitation and/or adsorption, or by luxury uptake. Only 
a small amount of phosphorus is used for cell metabolism and growth (1–2% of the total suspended 
solids (TSS) mass in the mixed liquor). Precipitation and adsorption processes require an appropriate 
pH, the presence of iron or calcium ions, etc. In WWTPs, luxury uptake of P is accomplished by the 
introduction of an anaerobic phase in the wastewater treatment line ahead of the aerobic phase and 
recycling of sludge through the anaerobic and aerobic phase. Exposing mixed liquor to an anaerobic/
aerobic sequence selects phosphate accumulating microorganisms (PAOs) due to a competition between 
PAOs and other aerobic organisms. This competition mechanism is based on a complete anaerobic uptake 
of the lower fatty acids by the polyp organisms (i.e., PAOs), which assures that in the aerobic phase, no 
fatty acids are left. The polyP organisms use the stored internal substrate during aerobic conditions while 
other aerobic organisms are lacking substrate. This process is usually referred to as the EBPR process. 
EBPR process can be established in MBR treatment unit by operating it in intermittent aeration mode. 
Moreover, phosphorus removal will be significantly improved in an MBR by a physical retention of 
PAOs, whose size is typically larger than 0.5 μm. Since an MF membrane (0.2 μm) will act as a physical 
barrier to retain the PAOs in the reactor, sufficient biomass is provided for the EBPR mechanism to take 
place (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Intermittently aerated MBR can achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal by a simultaneous  
nitrification and denitrification, P-uptake and P-release in the same reactor in accordance with time cycle 
of aeration and non-aeration. However, even though intermittent aeration was successful in removing 
nitrogen, P removal was difficult to achieve at a higher level. This is probably due to the inhibition by 
nitrate. In the anaerobic stage, nitrate reduces phosphate release, and in the aerobic stage it diminishes 
its uptake. Denitrification has more capability than phosphorus release with respect to the competition of 
substrate. This is because nitrate will be utilized as a final electron acceptor in the growth of non-poly-P 
heterotrophs. Thereby, the amount of substrate available for poly-P organisms is reduced and hence the 
removal of phosphorus is lowered. There are some studies that confirm the ability of poly-P organisms 
for denitrification, however, not all PAOs can use nitrate as an electron acceptor (Radjenović et al. 2008).
In addition, intermittently aerated MBR showed an unstable nitrogen removal in its application to 
treat domestic sewage of rural settlements because of incomplete denitrification. Stable nitrification 
can be maintained as long as the oxygen concentration is high enough. It was found that by lowering 
the DO concentration, nitrification was significantly inhibited, although it recovered completely after 
raising the DO concentration to 1 mg/L. Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira-like bacteria were identified as 
the predominant ammonium and nitrate-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in an MBR, respectively. Both of 
these are obligate aerobic and under anoxic conditions are unable to store or utilize their substrate. The 
absence of oxygen may provoke stress and damage of their metabolism, NOB being the more sensitive 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).

Biological  performanc e of membr ane bioreactor
There is much research on the effect of SRT on MBR performance as far as nitrification/denitrification 
and phosphorus removals are concerned. There is a decrease in nitrification rate at very low SRT (2 days), 
supposedly due to a partial loss of nitrifying microorganisms. On the other side, a decreasing trend of 
nitrifiers was observed when increasing the sludge concentration, i.e., solids retention time. Another 
study confirmed a negative influence of long SRT on nitrification performance, which was explained 
by impeded oxygen and substrate transfer owing to an increase in MLSS concentration (Radjenović et 
al. 2008).
These findings indicate that a compromise should be found between a sufficiently long SRT necessary 
to prevent the washout of nitrifiers, and a negative influence of too long SRT (decreased mass transfer 
due to poor aeration, competition with GAOs, etc.). However, over 90% removal of NH3-N is usually 
achieved in MBR systems, almost independent on the SRT. The performance of an MBR system which 
start-up was done without any sludge inoculum was investigated. The system was fed on municipal sewage 
in order to favour biomass selection based on the imposed operating conditions. Biodegradation of the 
influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and complete nitrification were consistently obtained already 
in the first days of operation. The ammonium oxidation performance over the whole experiment showed 
a typical nitrification start-up curve with initial N-NO2 production followed by complete nitrification 
that occurred only 10 days after the start-up of the plant. As far as HRT is concerned, several studies 
noted a complete nitrification in an MBR operating with a HRT as low as 2 h (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Other important factors that are to be considered for nitrogen removal are alkalinity, temperature, and 
organic and nitrogen loads (C/N ratio, i.e., BOD to total nitrogen (TN) ratio). The BOD/TN ratio must 
be high enough to denitrify the nitrogen to be nitrated. Though this ratio is an important factor to be 
considered for successful nitrogen removal, it depends upon the components of organic matter that were 
readily degradable, such as volatile fatty acids. As far as temperature is concerned, it is considered that 
it has to be maintained below 40 oC to ensure sufficient nitrification. If the temperature is controlled, 
a nitrification rate usually over 99% can be gained in spite of variations of inflow TN concentration 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).
Aerated MBR offers two major advantages in the elimination of phosphorus: complete removal of all 
particles (containing usually up to 0.1 mg of P per mg of total solids (TS), and aeration, which prevents 
the phosphate release that occurs under anoxic conditions. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest 
for the application of MBR as a technology for phosphorus recycling, since the P-content of sludge is 
expected to increase when prolonging SRT (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Much research has confirmed that MBR is a highly viable wastewater treatment technology regarding 
nitrification-denitrification and phosphorus removal. With optimized design and operating parameters 
it warrants high effluent quality in terms of ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates present in wastewater. 
Current European regulation describes guidelines for total phosphorus and nitrogen in treated effluent 
to 1–2 mg L-1 and 10–15 mg L–1, respectively. More stringent regulations are expected to come into force 
soon in some countries, which fulfilment will require improvements in the existing treatments and the 
implementation of additional ones (Radjenović et al. 2008).
4.3	
Removal of trace organic compounds by a membrane bioreactor
WWTPs treating wastewater from municipalities and industries have been shown as major sources of 
many environmental pollutants. These pollutants usually originate from synthetic chemicals that have 
been used widely for industrial, agricultural, and household purposes. Compounds like pharmaceutically 
active compounds), industrial chemicals, and pesticides are produced worldwide on a 100 000 t scale. 
After their usage for the intended purpose, a large fraction of these substances will be discharged into 
the wastewater unchanged or in the form of degradation products that are often hardly eliminable in 
conventional WWTPs. Depending on the efficiency of the treatment and chemical nature of a compound, 
they reach WWTP effluents and surface waters in certain concentration. In the worst case, they are 
present in drinking water, in spite of expensive treatment steps (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Although the exact effect of consistent exposure to trace organic contaminants is still unclear, there is no 
more doubt that it has significant adverse consequences for public health. For example, antibiotics and 
their metabolites can significantly increase antibiotic resistance in the population. Synthetic hormones 
can act as endocrine disruptors by mimicking or blocking hormones and disrupting the body’s normal 
functions. Due to their polarity, they can be eliminated during wastewater treatment only incompletely. 
Polar poorly degradable compounds were detected in high and comparable concentrations in the effluents 
of numerous WWTPs all over Europe. A proper wastewater treatment as mandatory in the European 
Union due to the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive will not eliminate polar pollutants completely. 
Therefore, to avoid such contaminants, emissions with WWTP effluents would have to be reduced by 
their advanced treatment or by avoidance and replacement measures for the respective pollutant. One 
of the most promising technologies is MBR technology. The potential of MBR to efficiently remove 
hazardous substances from wastewater is often highlighted. Besides the fact that there is a physical 
retention of all the molecules larger than the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane, 
hydrophobic substances also tend to accumulate onto the sludge and therefore they are removed from 
the effluent. Furthermore, as all the bacteria are held back, there are better adapted to mineralizing of 
micro pollutants present in the reactor (Radjenović et al. 2008).

Removal of hormones
Estrogenic substances have been identified and quantified in a wide variety of environments associated 
with industrial and municipal effluents, as well as urban and agricultural runoffs. Negative adverse health 
effects on aquatic organisms which could be attributed to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are 
reported by several authors. EDCs are substances that interfere with the hormone system of animals 
and human beings. When absorbed into the body, they either mimic or block hormones and disrupt the 
body’s normal functions. This disruption can happen through altering normal hormone levels, halting 
or stimulating their production, or changing the way they travel through the body, thus affecting the 
functions that these hormones control. According to a description by the European Commission, an 
endocrine disruptor is “an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function(s) of endocrine system 
and consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub) populations”. 
Two different classes of substances causing endocrine disruption can be identified: natural substances, 
including natural sexual hormones (estrogens, progesterone and testosterone) and phytoestrogens 
(chemicals produced by plants that act like estrogens in animal cells and bodies), xenobiotic substances, 
including synthetic hormones as the contraceptive 17α- ethinylestradiole as well as man-made chemicals 
and their by-products (e.g., pesticides, cleaning agents, flame retardants, etc.) (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Membrane bioreactor technology is a possibility to enhance the removal of EDCs.Factors like high sludge 
ages and low organic loads could not yet be correlated to improved degradation capacity, although biomass 
compositions might influence hormone removal in MBRs. Generally, the micro and ultrafiltration 
membranes do not display a barrier effect to hormones, but compared to conventional secondary and 
tertiary systems, a high removal can be expected due to full particle retention promoting the adsorption 
onto the sludge flocks. Although a certain estrogenic activity could be expected in MBR effluent (due 
to the cleavage of estrogen conjugates, or dissolution of particles due to digestion process that may 
release estrogens by desorption), membrane technology represents a good combination of different 
mechanisms for removal of endocrines. On one side, smaller floc sizes and higher sludge activity enhance 
biodegradation, and on the other particle size exclusion enables retention of the adsorbed compounds 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).

5	 Operation cost of membrane 
bioreactor
Although membrane bioreactor can provide much better effluent water quality than conventional 
bioprocesses, the operation of membrane bioreactor generally requires higher energy cost. This chapter 
is to introduce the cost of the operation of membrane bioreactor.
5.1	
Energy cost 
A cost comparison in 2007 showed that MBR was 15% more expensive (15 million litters a day), whereas a 
study by Zenon in 2003 gave MBR 5% lower costs. The differences were due to the design fluxes assumed 
and the capital charge rate for the project. Neither study allocated a cost advantage from the reduced 
footprint, which could typically translate to a treated water cost saving of up to 5%. It is interesting to 
evaluate the development in cost estimates over the past several years. A cost comparison was made for 
two wastewater treatment plants, with capacities of 2350 and 37 500 p.e. Based on a assumptions (e.g., 
a membrane lifetime of 7 years), it was conclude that depending on the design capacity (i.e., 2 times 
DWF to be treated) MBR is competitive with conventional treatment up to a treatment capacity of 12 
000 m3 d-1 (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Based on a survey of conventional wastewater-treatment facilities in the US, the energy usage range was 
0.32–0.66 kW h-1m-3. Long-term monitoring of wastewater-treatment systems has shown usages as low 
as 0.15 kW h-1m-3 for activated sludge, increasing to 0.25 kW h-1m-3 if a biological aerated filter (BAF) 
stage is included (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Membrane filtration after conventional treatment is estimated to add 0.1–0.2 kW h-1m-3 to the energy. 
Table 5.1 lists typical energy-use rates of different biological based treatment combinations .Experience 
in large-scale commercial MBRs shows an energy usage of around 1.0 kW h-1m-3, although smaller-scale 
facilities typically operate at 1.2–1.5 kW h-1 m-3 or higher (Hai and Yamamoto 2011) .

Aeration demand 
Energy usage for membrane aeration is a significant operating cost for any membrane bioreactor facility. 
It was calculated the total variable operational cost of MBR by summing the decreasing sludge-treatment 
cost and increasing aeration cost (see Figure 5.1). Since minimized sludge production implies maximized 
aeration cost, and vice versa, they considered the existence of an optimum point between these two 
extreme cases, where the total operational cost is minimized. They concluded that for reasonable ranges 
of HRT and MLSS sludge treatment cost overwhelms aeration cost, so the most adequate strategy for 
MBR cost reduction would be maintenance of low sludge production conditions. High SRT in an MBR 
means a high MLSS concentration and low F/M ratio, which enables application of short HRT. However, 
sludge production is obviously inversely proportional to HRT when MLSS is mixed. The shortest HRT 
and the minimum sludge production cannot be achieved simultaneously (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Figure 5.1 aeration demands for biodegradation of organic matters as a function of target MLSS and HRT.  
Flow rate and COD of influent were 1000 m3/d and 400 mg/L, respectively (Radjenović et al. 2008).

The aim of this chapter is to introduce design considerations of MBR, which is important to ensure the 
successful operation of membrane bioreactors.
6.1	
Pre-treatment
6.1.1	
Screen
MBR suppliers normally specify fine screening requirement of <2 mm mesh or hole opening (<1 mm 
preferred), while side stream MBRs will typically have tighter requirement for fine screening. Fine 
screens are sized for peak flow with one screen out of service to prevent overflow or bypass of unscreened 
wastewater. Fine screens in many different configurations are available, each uniquely fitting a particular 
need and application. Typical fine screen configurations include rotating brush screens, internally-fed 
rotary drum screens, in-channel rotary drum screens and traveling band screens (AMTA 2007). In 
the case of hollow fiber membranes, use of 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm fine screen upstream of membranes is 
recommended to protect the membranes from hair and other stringy materials that can result in excessive 
cleaning frequencies. A fine screen of 2–3 mm is usually employed for flat sheet membrane systems 
(Radjenović et al. 2008). Hollow fiber membranes have a tendency for aggregates of hair and other 
debris to collect at the top of the membrane elements. These aggregates usually cannot be significantly 
removed by back-flushing. Flat sheet modules are somewhat less prone to such clogging, but they too 
need a feed-water pre-treatment, though with coarser screens (Radjenović et al. 2008).
In the operation of a MBR, even if a 1 mm screen was applied, two severe problems occurred (Melin 
et al. 2006):
1.	 The wedge wire sieve (slots) showed quite low removal efficiencies. Later it was replaced 
by the much better performing woven mesh type sieve. The type of sieve installed is very 
important regarding the total screening removal, especially towards hair and fibres.
2.	 After replacement of the drum, severe and frequent clogging of the mesh type sieve 
occurred, caused by an inadequate automated cleaning system. Frequent manual high 
pressure cleaning by the operators was necessary to guarantee a continuous operation. Note 
that the investment in a 1 mm pre-treatment drum screen is of little use if the bioreactor is 
open and surrounded by trees as it is the case in Schilde. After the start-up it was decided 
to cover the bioreactor completely in order to prevent leafs, needles and other debris from 
falling into the bioreactor.

6.1.2	
Oil and grease
Oil and grease in the concentrations typically found in municipal sewage have little or no impact on the 
operation of an MBR. However, free oil and grease needs to be removed as this can prematurely foul 
membranes (AMTA 2007).
6.1.3	
Equalization Tank 
As membranes are costly and the membrane surface area has to be designed for the maximum flow, it 
has to be checked whether hydraulic peaks can be levelled out. Equalization tanks and/or an aeration 
tank operation mode with alternating water levels are measures to be considered in the design phase. 
At municipal plants, the maximum storm water flow at low temperatures has to be taken in account 
(Cornel and Krause 2008).
6.1.4	
Inorganic Chemicals 
High calcium concentrations (>200 mg/L Ca2+) may cause scaling problems, depending on aeration and 
pH. With the high specific aeration at the membrane surface of submerged membranes, CO2 is stripped 
out, which leads to an increase in the pH and, as a consequence, may cause CaCO3 precipitation at or 
in the membrane; pH control helps avoid precipitation as has been demonstrated at an industrial site in 
Germany. In tubular membrane systems without scour aeration, the pressure drop across the module 
and/or the membrane can shift the solubility equilibrium and cause CaCO3 precipitation. Typically, only 
industrial applications are affected by calcium precipitation. The membranes can be cleaned with (weak) 
acids (Cornel and Krause 2008).
6.2	
Factors influencing performance
6.2.1	
Membrane selection and applied flux
An MBR membrane needs to be mechanically robust, chemically resistant to high Cl2 concentrations 
used in cleaning, and non-biodegradable. Clean-water permeability is not as important in an MBR as 
in membrane-filtration applications, since the membrane transport properties are strongly influenced 
by the accumulation of foulant particles at the membrane surface. However, process flux in treating a 
wastewater feed is important since it directly affects capital cost, due to its effect on membrane area 
and footprint, and operating costs due to the effect of membrane area on chemical and air use. Most 
MBRs operate at an average flux rate between 12.5 and 25 L m-2 h-1. The key flux rates that determine the 
number of membranes required are associated with the peak flow rates. For plants with peaking factors 
of less than two, an MBR can handle the plant flow variation without having a significantly impact on 
the average design flux rate. Otherwise, equalization needs to be provided with either a separate tank at 
the head of the facility or within the aeration basin, allowing side water depth variations during peak 
flow (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

The leading MBR providers propose several MBR designs. In each case, the process proposed is very 
specific. Not only are the membrane material and configuration used different, but the operating 
conditions, cleaning protocols, and reactor designs also change from one company to another. For 
example, the flat-sheet membrane provided by Kubota does not require backwash operation, while 
hollow-fiber membranes have been especially designed to hydraulically backwash the membrane on a 
given frequency (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
In the 1990s, PVDF became established in MBRs through the reinforced capillary fiber in Zenon’s ZW 
500 module. PVDF has impressive performance in terms of strength and flexibility, but is significantly 
more expensive as a polymer. Nevertheless, PVDF membranes can achieve substantially higher flux, 
thereby overcoming price disadvantage. Recently, MRE also developed a PVDF-based membrane system. 
This membrane, designated as SADF, promises to be very competitive in both capital and operating 
costs, and despite it having a lower packing density than the PE product, it operates at much higher 
flux. With several companies now offering PVDF products in both capillary and flat-sheet formats, this 
is the dominant membrane polymer in the MBR market (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

Design of membrane bioreactor
A significantly used membrane polymer in MBR is a reinforced PES, used by Koch-Puron. Although 
PES is an important polymer in water treatment, in wastewater applications, its lack of flexibility limits 
the possibility of using air scour. Reinforcing the capillary does allow air scour, but at the expense of 
permeability. The Puron product uses reinforced PES rather than the PVDF, favoured by its rivals. 
However, its main distinguishing feature is that the membrane fibers are potted at only one end. This 
overcomes the problem of fouling below the potting interface by hairs and fibers, which is a problem 
for the other hollow-fiber technologies (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
Norit is the one major MBR Company that offers a system based on a sidestream format with tubular 
membranes rather than a submerged format. Cross flow is only used for small scale applications, with 
feeds that are difficult to treat, whereas airlift is cost effective for larger-scale municipal applications (Hai 
and Yamamoto 2011).
6.2.2	
Sludge retention time
In the past, most MBR systems were designed with extremely long SRTs, of the order of 30–70 days, 
and very few were operated at less than about 20 days. Two reasons prompted such practice: (1) the 
drive to minimize sludge production or eliminate it all together and (2) the concern over the reduced 
flux resulting from short SRT operation, presumably due to the fouling effect of extracellular excretions 
from younger sludge. Currently, the selection of SRT is based more on the treatment requirements and 
SRTs as low as 8–10 days can now be contemplated (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
6.2.3	
Mixed liquor suspended solids concentration
From the point of view of bioreactor volume reduction and minimization of excess sludge, submerged 
MBR systems have been typically operated with MLSS concentrations of more than 12 000 mg L-1, and 
often in the range of 20 000 mg L-1. Hence, they offer greater flexibility in the selection of the design 
SRT. However, excessively high MLSS may render the aeration system ineffective and reduce membrane 
flux. A trade-off, therefore, comes into play. Current design practice is to assume the MLSS to be closer 
to 10 000 mg L-1 to ensure adequate oxygen transfer and to allow for higher membrane flux. With larger 
systems, it is more cost effective to reduce the design MLSS because of the high relative cost of membranes 
when compared to the cost of additional tank volume (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).
It is observed that the coefficient for oxygen mass transfer for clean water and waste water (a-value) 
decreases strongly with an increase of the MLSS in the aeration basin which leads at the same time to 
a higher process air demand and a higher energy consumption for aeration (Alfred and Möbius 2009). 
Our recommendation for MLSS design according to the available information is a moderate mixed 
liquor concentration of 10–12 g/l with a a-value of 0.6 for calculation of the oxygen requirement in the 
bioreactor. However, the results come from tests with municipal wastewater and have to be verified with 
papermill effluent (Alfred and Möbius 2009).

Aeration
At high MLSS concentrations, the demand for oxygen can be significant. In some cases, the demand 
can exceed the volumetric capacity of typical oxygenation systems. The oxygen transfer capacity of the 
aeration system must also be carefully analysed. Submerged membranes are typically provided with 
shallow coarse bubble air to agitate the membranes as a means to control fouling. Such aeration provides 
some oxygenation, but at low efficiency. In compact systems, fine bubble aeration may be placed at greater 
depth below the membrane aeration; however, the combined efficiency and the bubble coalescing effects 
require further consideration during design. The lower operating cost obtained with the submerged 
configuration along with the steady decrease in the membrane cost encouraged an exponential increase 
in MBR plant installations from the mid-1990s onward. Since then, further improvements in the MBR 
design and operation have been introduced and incorporated into larger plants. The key steps in the 
recent MBR development are summarized below (Hai and Yamamoto 2011):
1.	 The acceptance of modest fluxes (25% or less of those in the first generation), and the idea 
of using two-phase bubbly flow to control fouling.
2.	 While early MBRs were operated at SRTs as high as 100 days with MLSS up to 30 g L-1, the 
recent trend is to apply a lower SRT (around 10–20 days), resulting in more manageable 
MLSS levels (10–15 g L-1).
3.	 Thanks to these new operating conditions, the fouling propensity in the MBR has tended to 
decrease and overall maintenance has been simplified, as less-frequent membrane cleaning 
is necessary.
It is important to install enough aeration capacity in the first cascade (s) to avoid an oxygen deficit and 
minimise the risk (of a massive growth) of filamentous microorganism (bulking sludge) which might 
affect the operation of the membrane stage. This has to be mentioned because of the higher sludge content 
and high oxygen consumption compared to classical activated sludge systems (Alfred and Möbius 2009).
The aeration basin (and membrane containers in the case of submerged membranes) should be fit with 
spray water system for foam control. However, defoamer should only be used when required to avoid 
costs and the risk of an accumulation of substances which might affect the membranes. In addition the 
possibility of installing a skim device on the aeration surface for the evacuation of foam out of the system 
can be proved if the effluent tends to have massive foam development and the foam control requires too 
much de-foamer chemicals (Alfred and Möbius 2009).

Flow variation
Many small-scale MBR plants are purposely base loaded in order to optimize the membrane design, 
e.g. the peak day flow is limited. While this design approach has worked well for satellite facilities, most 
large scale plants are end of the line facilities and the plant must accommodate the flow fluctuation from 
both diurnal flows and storm flows. Because the membrane sizing is hydraulically driven, alternatives 
to increasing the number of membranes should be considered if the peak flow is more than twice the 
average flow as the economical upper flow limit for membranes in most MBRs is approximately 1.5 to 2 
times the average flow rate. Designing membranes to accommodate higher peak flows typically results in 
flux rates at the average flow which are below the optimized point and significantly increases equipment 
cost. Operation and management costs are also increased due to increased air scour requirements. To 
allow membrane optimization, equalization should be considered. 
There are two options for equalization: external and internal. External equalization consists of a separate 
basin ahead of the MBR basin. The external equalization basin easily satisfies design requirements, 
but if the driver behind the selection of an MBR is footprint, an additional facility may be difficult to 
incorporate on space constrained sites. Internal equalization, e.g. side water depth variation within the 
aeration tanks, can be used if the variation isn’t too large. Most plants will be limited to approximately 2 
to 4 feet of variation before the aeration blowers are significantly impacted unless less efficient positive 
displacement blowers are used. Typically internal equalization is best suited for dampening the diurnal 
pattern because the level variation required to effectively manage storm flows tends to be significant and 
could adversely impact the blower design. For some facilities a combination of both external and internal 
flow equalization provides a cost effective solution with the external equalization basin used for off-line 
storage to handle storm events and internal equalization used to handle the daily diurnal variation. If 
the expected rainwater flow / dry weather flow is smaller than three, the membrane surface area can be 
sized based on the average flow rate. In constant, the cross flow MBR system will have to be sized based 
on the peak flow rate, resulting in additional investment costs (van Haandel and van der Lubbe 2007). 
Table 6.1 shows the operation conditions for submerged MBR, which is useful to design an MBR.

membrane bioreactors operation
This chapter shows the start-up of a MBR and its cleaning in practice
7.1	
Star-up of a MBR 
A MBR pilot system was installed at the premises of the Sanitary Engineering Research and Development 
Centre. Primary treated municipal wastewater after passing through 1 mm screens was fed to a 2 m3 
equalisation tank and then to a 250 L pilot scales MBR where the membrane module was immersed. 
Permeate was filtered directly from the aeration tank. Coarse bubble aeration was supplied at a constant 
rate of 4.0 m3/h to minimise membrane fouling, while fine bubble aeration was supplied through air 
diffusers in order to maintain the DO level higher than 2 mg/L. The high DO concentration ensured that 
the DO fluctuation in the bioreactor had a minimal effect on membrane fouling. The filtration pattern 
took place at 10-min cycles during which 9.5 min of filtration was followed by 0.5 min of backwash. The 
MBR was left to develop its own biomass for a period of 3 months (start-up period) and was subsequently 
operated under steady-state conditions. The system was left for a period of at least 2×SRT to attain 
the required steady state conditions. Four experimental periods were conducted and each period was 
characterised by a different solids retention time (SRT), namely 10, 15, 20 and 33 days. The hydraulic 
retention time (HRT), filtration flux, backwash flux and membrane aeration remained constant under 
all operating conditions. The hollow fibre membrane module was supplied by GE Water and Process 
Technologies. It was made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and had a nominal pore size of 0.04 mm.

The MBR pilot system operated at SRT = 10, 15, 20 and 33 days. Figure 7.1 shows the variation of MLSS 
and MLVSS in the bioreactor. Two major sludge loss events were experienced, one on day 358 when the 
system was operating at SRT = 20 d and one on day 562 when the system was operating with SRT = 33 
d. In both cases the system was left to regain its former steady state conditions, while no experiments 
were conducted. The increase of SRT for constant HRT resulted in an increase of the MLSS concentration 
from 3 g/L at SRT = 10 days, to 11–13 g/L at SRT = 33 days (Malamis et al. 2011).

Figure 7.1 shows the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and the membrane permeability fluctuation during 
the whole operation period of the system. The gradual increase of TMP and the corresponding decrease 
of permeability occurred due to gradual membrane fouling taking place. The rapid decrease of TMP 
and the resulting increase in membrane permeability occurred due to chemical cleanings that were 
performed to restore the membrane permeability. The increase of SRT from 10 to 20 days resulted in a 
reduction of the rate of membrane permeability decrease from 2.56 L/m2.h-bar-d to 0.60 L/m2.h-bar-d 
(80% reduction), while the further increase of SRT to 33 days did not significantly impact on the fouling 
rate, which was 0.53 L/m2-h-bar-d. The system performance stabilised at SRT Z20 d, which is associated 
with lower concentration of extracellular polymeric substances (Malamis et al. 2011).
The effluent was characterised by very low COD for all operating conditions. The average effluent COD 
was lower than 30 mg/L for all operating conditions and was lower than 20 mg/L for SRT Z 20 days, 
while the percentage COD removal was higher than 95%. Organics removal was significant even during 
the first 10–15 days of system operation, despite the fact that the biomass was not fully developed. This 
is attributed to the effective filtration process which resulted in the removal of suspended solids and 
colloidal substances, since the membrane MWCO was 200 kDa. Full nitrification (100%) was observed 
for all the examined operating conditions. This was the case even at relatively low temperature (12–13 
OC) and high MLSS concentrations (11–13 g/L). After the start-up period the NH4-N concentration 
in the bioreactor and in the final effluent was negligible and high nitrate levels were always observed 
(Figure 7.1(c)) (Malamis et al. 2011).

Membrane fouling and cleaning in a long term operation 
Figure. 7.2 shows the evolution of TMP and flux in the long-term operation of a MBR. In Run 1 of 
200 d, TMP and its rising rate were in the low range of 4.6–17.6 kPa and 0.15–2.09 kPa/d respectively, 
indicating steady filtration was successfully achieved in the long-term operation. This depressed TMP 
evolution was mainly attributed to both synergistic effectiveness of chemical cleaning-in-place (CIP), 
with a TMP controlling mode, and sub-critical flux operation. Sub-critical flux operation could reduce 
the cake layer caused by sludge flocs, resulting in slow TMP rise (such as the average of 0.79 kPa/d in 
Run 1 in this study) with time. After every chemical CIP, TMP decreased almost down to the original 
value (5–7 kPa), indicating that chemical CIP could effectively remove the fouling in terms of membrane 
pore blockage and gel layer caused by colloids and soluble organic substances. Cleaning intervals were 
from 2 to 3 weeks to nearly 3 months due to fluctuation of sludge characteristics. In Run 2, TMP and its 
rising rate were also in the low range of 5.1–18.2 kPa and 0.50–1.48 kPa/d respectively under effective 
membrane fouling control by sub-critical flux operation and chemical CIP, but with a time controlling 
mode. Although TMP did not decrease to the original value after weekly cleaning with low concentration 
NaClO and rose, to some extent, in one month, TMP decreased to the original value after monthly 
cleaning with high concentration NaClO. From the low average TMP and its rising rate in Run 1 and 
Run 2 with the similar flux, steady filtration in the long-term operation could be achieved under sub-
critical flux operation and chemical CIP (with TMP or time controlling mode) (Wei et al. 2011).

Compared with Run 1 and Run 2, TMP (5.3–26.6 kPa) and its rising rate (0.39–3.05 kPa/d) between 
two cleanings in Run 3 were higher due to critical flux operation. Although filtration stability was not 
as good as in Run 1 and Run 2, TMP could be kept below 30 kPa in Run 3, showing a possible steady 
long-term filtration under critical flux operation and chemical CIP with combined TMP and time 
controlling modes. Especially TMP increase in the second half of Run 3 with flux of 29.7–35.9 L/(m2 h) 
was comparable to that in initial Run 1 with flux of 27.6–30.3 L/(m2 h), indicating the possible seasonal 
effects on membrane fouling. Both initial Run 1 and the second half of Run 3 were in summer with good 
sludge filterability. High temperature not only decreased the sludge viscosity but also affected microbial 
activity especially under low SRT, thus resulting in less fouling than low temperature. In addition, the 
relative steady filtration in Run 3 also showed that the criterion for identifying critical flux in this study 
was a little conservative (Wei et al. 2011).
In Run 4, under super-critical flux operation and chemical CIP with time controlling mode, both TMP 
and its rising rate were in the higher range of 6.7–43.2 kPa and 0.61–4.69 kPa/ d compared to Run 1–3. 
Especially at the second month of Run 4, TMP rising rate was higher than 3 kPa/d, showing characteristics 
of cake layer fouling. After weekly cleaning with low concentration NaClO, virtually no TMP decrease 
was observed. Although TMP could be depressed after monthly cleaning with high concentration NaClO, 
TMP rose up to higher than 40 kPa at the end of Run 4 and flux decreased with increased TMP due to 
the limit of suction pump. This indicated that steady filtration under super-critical flux operation could 
not be achieved even adopting chemical CIP (Wei et al. 2011).

In Run 5, variable flux operation was conducted in order to restore membrane permeability. Although 
enhanced chemical CIP (NaClO and HCl or NaOH) was performed, low TMP (less than 20 kPa) was 
only adequate under low flux (about 25 L/(m2 h)) due to accumulative fouling in Run 4. In addition, 
the relative poor filterability of activated sludge under winter temperature (10–15 OC) in Run 5 might 
be another factor for low permeability recovery (Wei et al. 2011).
Figure 7.3 TMP decrease after chemical CIP with different cleaning reagents.
In Run 6 under critical flux operation, TMP showed a gradual decrease followed by a gradual increase 
due to enhanced chemical CIP and fluctuation of sludge characteristics. In the second half, TMP was 
obviously lower than in Run 4 and Run 5 and was close to that in Run 3, indicating membrane permeability 
could be recovered from serious fouling, caused by super-critical flux operation in Run 4, to some extent 
by chemical CIP (Wei et al. 2011).
From all runs, long-term steady filtration was successfully achieved under sub-critical flux operation 
(30 L/(m2 h)) and chemical CIP with both cleaning modes. Critical flux operation (30–35 L/(m2 h)) 
appeared to be feasible for achieving long-term steady filtration under chemical CIP with combined 
TMP and time controlling mode because this combined cleaning mode could provide the more intensive 
protection for membrane. However super-critical flux operation (35–42 L/(m2 h)) was not possible 
for achieving long-term steady filtration even adopting chemical CIP. The results from the long-term 
operation of the pilot-scale SMBR in this study also demonstrated that the critical flux should be a key 
parameter for realizing long-term steady filtration for real SMBR application and the method for critical 
flux measurement through short-term constant-flux filtration test used in this study was feasible for 
long-term operation (Wei et al. 2011).

Figure.7.3 and Table 7.2 show chemical CIP performance of various cleaning reagents in terms of TMP 
decrease after cleaning under the same flux, i.e. the simple index for permeability recovery. From Table 7.2, 
average TMP decrease after cleaning for high concentration NaClO (2000-3000 mg/L), low concentration 
NaClO (500–1000 mg/L), HCl (pH=1) and NaOH (pH = 12) was 12.7 kPa, 5.1 kPa, 9.8 kPa and 6.2 
kPa respectively, indicating high concentration NaClO was the best among all of the reagents. It was 
also found that high concentration NaClO (2000 mg/L) was better than other chemicals (such as H2O2, 
NaOH, HCl, citric acid and enzymes) used in their study. The recovery of membrane permeability by 
NaClO cleaning has also been reported in many publications. HCl and NaOH showed results similar 
to that of low concentration NaClO. The combination of NaClO and HCl or NaOH appeared to be 
better than NaClO only, especially when serious fouling occurred. In addition, for the performance of 
each cleaning in terms of TMP decrease, it depended not only on cleaning reagent but also on fouling 
condition before cleaning. Under the same cleaning reagent, generally the higher TMP before cleaning 
was, the higher TMP decrease after cleaning was. Serious fouling occurred at the second half of Run 
4, Run 5 and initial Run 6, was partially the reason for the large fluctuation of cleaning performance. 
Finally, it should be noted that HCl, NaOH, combined NaClO and HCl, and combined NaClO and 
NaOH cleaning were performed only 4, 2, 3 and 3 times, respectively, in this study. Therefore, further 
investigation is necessary to optimize CIP strategies for MBR (Wei et al. 2011).

During the long-term (750 d) operation of a pilot-scale submerged membrane bioreactor for municipal 
wastewater treatment, steady filtration for at least 265 d under high flux (30 L/(m2 h)) was successfully 
achieved due to effective membrane fouling control by sub-critical flux operation and chemical CIP 
with NaClO. Sub-critical flux operation prevented rapid fouling caused by cake layer formation. NaClO 
CIP, in both a TMP controlling mode (cleaning with high concentration NaClO (2000–3000 mg/L) was 
performed when TMP rose to 15 kPa) and a time controlling mode (cleanings were performed weekly 
and monthly respectively with low concentration NaClO (500–1000 mg/L) and high concentration 
NaClO (3000 mg/L)), effectively controlled slow fouling caused by pore blockage and gel layer. Critical 
flux operation (30–35 L/ (m2.h)) under chemical CIP with combined TMP and time controlling mode 
achieved steady filtration up to 140 d and appeared promising for achieving longer steady filtration 
although it was less stable than sub-critical flux operation. However super-critical flux operation (35–42 
L/(m2.h)) was not attainable for achieving long-term steady filtration even adopting chemical CIP. In 
addition, the results also demonstrated that the method for critical flux measurement through short-
term constant-flux filtration test used in this study was feasible for long-term operation (Wei et al. 2011).

From macroscopic cleaning performance, high concentration NaClO was the best. HCl (pH = 1) and 
NaOH (pH = 12) showed results similar to low concentration NaClO. The combination of NaClO and HCl 
or NaOH appeared to be better than NaClO alone, especially when serious fouling occurred. Microscopic 
analysis on membrane fibers before and after high concentration NaClO CIP was conducted in order 
to investigate the mechanism of NaClO CIP for removing membrane fouling. SEM and Atomic force 
microscope images showed that NaClO cleaning could effectively remove the gel layer, the dominant

partially remove pore blockage fouling. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and EDS analyses 
demonstrated that protein-like macromolecular organics and inorganics were the important components 
of the fouling layer. The analysis of effluent quality before and after NaClO CIP showed no obvious 
negative effect on effluent quality (Wei et al. 2011).

bioreactors
In this chapter, the world wide applications of MBR is introduced and some full scale MRBs are also 
presented.
8.1	
Installations Worldwide 
Kubota (Japan) has installed most of the world’s MBRs while Zenon (Canada) dominates in regard to 
installed capacity having almost four times more water treated through their membranes than Kubota. 
Zenon has installed about 85% of North American installations, which comprise about 11% of the world’s 
MBR market. Asian markets (mostly in Japan and South Korea) have employed MBR technology mostly 
for small-scale domestic applications. In general, most of the MBRs in operation are medium or small 
scale plants. More than 85% of Kubota’s MBRs have flows less than 200 m3 d–1 while out of 219 MBR 
plants that treat municipal wastewater in North America, only 17 exceed 10 000 m3 d–1. The largest 
capacity plant in operation is in North America, which operates at 26 900 m3 d–1, while the largest MBR 
worldwide currently is in Kaarst, Germany (48 000 m3 d–1) with total membrane area of 84 480 m2. Both 
of these plants operate with Zenon membranes. Leading manufacturers have exponential growth in the 
number of installed MBRs and their cumulative capacity in the last decade. Although the market is still 
dominated by Zenon and Kubota, there is a wide range of MBR systems available; however most are 
still at the development stage. The photographs of typical Kubota and Zenon membranes are presented 
in Figure 8.1 and 8.2, respectively (Radjenović et al. 2008).

The side-stream MBRs that were predominant before the 1990s are still present on the market but they 
hold a smaller share. The main manufacturers of side-stream MBR systems are Norit X-Flow, Millennium 
pore and Novasep-Orelis. Most of the side-stream MBRs today treat industrial wastewaters or landfill 
(Radjenović et al. 2008).
Municipal wastewater treatment is both the earliest and largest application of MBR, and it is predicted 
that this will continue to be its primary use. Due to its small footprint and potential for reuse of high-
quality effluent, MBR is capable of coping with population growth and limited space. For industrial 
applications where more stringent regulations are imposed, it provides an effluent that can be safely 
discharged into the environment. The main applications of membrane technology reported in industry 
are for treatments of heavily loaded wastewaters such are oily wastewaters, or discharges from tanneries 
and textile industries (Radjenović et al. 2008).
Figure 8.2 Zenon hollow fiber MBR
8.2	
Plant size
Earlier MBR technology was favoured in difficult applications or those applications where compactness 
was important and reuse was the target; and it usually involved smaller plants. As the demand for MBR 
technology grows globally, both the number of installations and the capacity of the installed plants are 
increasing dramatically. The most optimistic industry estimates suggest that up to 1000 new MBR plants 
will be built annually during the survey period. The size of the constructed plants has grown from facilities 
treating hundreds to thousands of gallons of wastewater per day to those treating tens of millions of 
gallons per day in just a few years. However, the most common capacity for current worldwide MBR 
installations ranges from the 50 000 gpd (200 m3 d-1) to 500 000 gpd systems (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

The largest MBR plant in the world is set to be operational in 2010/11 in King County, Washington State. 
When completed, the facility will have an initial peak flow capacity of 495 000 m3 d-1 (average 136 000 
m3 d-1), rising to a daily 645 000 m3 (average 205 000 m3) by 2040 (Hai and Yamamoto 2011).

8.3.1.1	 Nordkanal wastewater treatment plants
When the expansion of the Nordkanal wastewater treatment plant became necessary, the original site 
had to be given up due to the spatial development of the city of Kaarst. A new plant had to be built at 
another site. The Erftverband decided on the membrane bioreactor process because positive experience 
had been acquired with this process at the Rodingen wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater 
treatment concept was developed in close coordination with the Ministry for Environment and Nature 
Conservation, Agriculture and Consumer protection of the North-Rhine Westphalia. Due to its size, 
this plant represents new planning dimensions and has demonstration character throughout Europe.

At the site of the old wastewater treatment plant, the wastewater is pre-treated by a coarse screen 
and pumped to the new Nordkanal plant, situated a distance of 2.5 km away, where the wastewater is 
mechanically pre-treated by two step screens (5 mm spacing) operated in parallel and two aerated grit 
and grease traps also operated in parallel. Then the wastewater is treated by two rotary screens operated 
in parallel with an aperture size of 0.5 mm (figure 8.3) to protect the membranes in the nitrification 
stage. The emergency circuit of the rotary screens is made safe by a fine screen with an aperture size of 
1mm, so that the membranes are protected from the input of coarse material into the activated sludge 
tank. Figure 8.4 shows the flow sheet of the Nordkanal wastewater treatment plant.

The activated sludge stage has four lines, each of which consists of upstream denitrification tanks, a 
variable tank zone for either denitrification or nitrification, and of the nitrification tanks with immersed 
membrane modules, designed as activated sludge tanks with circulating flow. The nitrification tanks are 
cased. The total volume of the activated sludge tanks is 9200 m3. The sludge is stabilized aerobically. As 
a result of flow simulations, agitators and baffles were integrated into the activated sludge tanks with 
circulating flow.
The membrane installation has been realized with eight lines and equipped with capillary membranes 
from company ZENEN (ZE 500c). A total filter surface area of approximately 85000 m3 has been installed 
because the District Government Dusseldorf demanded to provide a reserve of 25% for the membrane 
filtration. For external chemical cleaning, s separate cleaning chamber is available.

The investment for the new construction of the Nordkanal wastewater treatment plant was 21.5 million 
euro. Approximately, 6.6 million euro of this amount had been taken over by the federal state North 
Rhine-Westphalia.
8.3.1.2	 Monheim wastewater treatment plant
The wastewater treatment plant of the city of Monhelm is situated in the sensitive karstland of the district 
Donauries. It treats not only the wastewater from the city of Monheim, but also from the municipalities 
of Rogling and Tagmersheim. The treated effluent is discharged into the Gailach which infiltrates into the 
karst 6 km downstream of Monheim. In 1998 and 1999, first concepts for the discharge of wastewater 
into the karst subsoil were developed.
Within the scope of the large scale pilot project ‘wastewater treatment Gailach valley’, the Free State of 
Bavaria supported the financing of the construction of a membrane bioreactor at the site of the Monheim 
wastewater treatment plant. The investment for the membrane bioreactor was approx. 7.6 million euro, 
of which 5.8 million euro were granted as subsidy by the state Bavaria. 
The Monheim wastewater treatment plant is designed for a capacity of 9700 PE, based on a peak flow 
of 288 m3/h and an average daily wastewater flow of 2400 m3/d.

AApplication s of membr ane bioreactor
As shown in the flow sheet of the Monheim wastewater treatment plant (figuer 8.6), the mechanical 
pretreatment stage has two lines. Each line consists of a fine sieve with an aperture size of 1mm and 
a grit chamber. 75% of the maximum inflow can be treated by each line. The mechanically pretreated 
wastewater flows into the activated sludge stage with a total volume of 1660 m3, which is also built in two 
lines. Each line consistof an upstream denitrification and a nitrification tank as well as two membrane 
chambers which have been provided with a coating resistant to chemicals to protect the concrete. The 
tanks for the denitrification and nitrification have a volume of 240 m3 each, which each of the four 
membraen chambers has a volume of 75 m3. The sludge is stabilized aerobically.
The membarne stage was designed for a specific filtration capacity of 22–24 L/m2.h of combined flow. 
This volume can be increased at short notice up to 31 L/m3.h when one membrane chamber is shut down. 
According to this design, the membrane stage contains 28 module cassettes from the company ZENON 
(type ZW 500c) with a total membrane surface area of 12320 m2 filter. Filtration lines are installed in 
four separate chambers, chemical cleaning of the modules can be realized by pumping off the activated 
sludge without removing the modules (on air).
The specific energy demand of the wastewater treatment plant is about 1 kWh per m3 of wasteater. The 
manpower requriemnt corresponds to that of a conventional plant.

At present, the operation of the Monheim membrane bioreactor is accompanied by a research program. 
Main items of this study include testing and optimization of the membrane bioreactor process and 
investigating the effects of wastewater discharge on the Gailach and the groundwater.
8.3.1.3	 Markranstadt wastewater treatment plant
The Markranstadt wastewater treatment plant is situated in the southwest of Leipzig. It is one of more 
than 30 wastewater treatment plants of Kommunale Wasserwerke Leipzig (municipal waterworks). It 
was designed for 12000 PE; the actural degree of capacity utilization is approx..8000 PE.
The reason for a new construction of this plant was the planned closure of the obsolete wastewater 
treatment plant which no longer complied with the requirements. The deciding factors for the construction 
of a membrane bioreactor were the limited surface area of the site and increased demands on the effluent 
quality (table 8.3) due to a ‘weak’ receiving water.

Figure 8.8 process stages at the Markranstadt wastewater treatment. Left: inflow chamber to the membrane  
bioreactor with overflow edge to combined water treatment, right: combined water treatment tank.
The plant has a hydraulic capacity of 180 m3/h. From the intercepting sewer of the combined sewer 
system, the wastewater is fed by a lifting pump via the inflow chamber (figure 8.8, left) to the mechanical 
pre-treatment stage.
The two line mechanical pre-treatment stage consists of a step screen (3 mm spacing) (figure 8.9, left) 
and a grit and grease trap. By a distributor the wastewater flows into the two line activated sludge. It is 
operated as upstream denitrification (VDN = 2.435 m3) with downstream nitrification (VN=2.435 m3). 
All tanks are equipped with agitators. In addition, aggregates for fine bubble aeration are installed over 
the whole surface area of the bottom of the nitrification tanks.
The membrane modules for biomass separation from the company ZENON are arranged at te inner 
longitudinal sides in the upper zone of the nitrification tanks with a depth of 7 m. The total filter surface 
area of 7360 m2 is distributed in four lines, two each in both nitrification zones. Between the longwise 
arranged nitrification tanks a cleaning shaft for external module cleaning is installed. The modules can 
be removed by a fixed crane.

Besides the wastewater treatment plant, a combined water treatment plant was built in parallel at the 
same site. The wastewater quantities which exceed the capacity of the membrane stage during combined 
water flow are stored temporarily and pretreated in parallel in two tanks which serve as settling and 
storage tanks. These wastewater quantities are fed to the membrane installation during periods with 
smaller inflow volumes. Thanks to the combined water treatment plant, the necessary membrane surface 
area could be considerably reduced because it had to be designed for the maximum inflow quantity, but 
only for 1.1 QT.
Since the plant was commissioned in 2000, much knowledge has been acquired concerning the 
optimizaiton of process engineering and control. Improvement of mechanical pretreatment was especially 
important. The screen installed initally was replanced by a combinaiton of coarse screen (5 mm spacing) 
and fine sieve with a aperture size of <1 mm.

Industrial wastewater: examples from food industry
The generic term food industry is comprised of a large number of branches, such as the milk or 
meat processing industry, processing of vegetables, finished products, the beverage industry etc. 
Correspondingly, the wastewaters of the individual braches vary in their composition. They have in 
common only high organic loads.
In the following the use of membrane technology for the treatment of wastewater from the food industry 
is described for three branches: potato starch production, delicatessen production and malt production, 
and presented with the help of concrete examples.
Besides wastewater water treatment, membrane technology is also sued in the food industry for other 
purposes, such as concentration (e.g. of juice, milk, whey, egg whites), filtration (e.g. of juice, wine, 
beer) and alcohol removal from beer. The alcohol fraction resulting from alcohol removal is a suitable 
substrate for denitrification in wastewater treatment (as a methanol substitute).

8.3.2.1	 Potato starch production
In the Federal Republic of Germany, starch is produced from maize, potatoes, wheat and rice. Of these 
raw materials the potato has the highest water content. For starch production, the potatoes are carefully 
prewashed and then ground, separated from the pulp water (0.76 m3 of pulp waster per ton of potatoes) 
and washed out. The starch is produced from the ground potatoes, and the pulp water is generally used to 
produce potato protein. The residual pulp water is used for irrigation of farmland or evaporated. Potato 
pulp, which contains fine-ground peelings, cell walls, starch residues and pulp water, is dewatered. In 
Germany and the Benelux Countries, potato pulp has been used for many years as fodder for dairy cattle 
and young stock and also partly for fat stock.
The entire production process results in sweeping and washing water, pulp water and starch washing 
water. The amount of washing water is about 1.8 to 2.8 m3 per ton of starch. Characteristic constituents 
are potato pulp water ingredients, fibres and mineral components (earth sand etc).
Potato starch is only produced only during a certain season. The Fertilizer Ordinance (1996) dictates 
the storage of potato pulp and irrigation waster between 15th November and 15th January (even longer 
in the case of frost) and limits the application in autumn to a maximum of 80 kg Ntot/ha.

The concentration of the pulp water and closing of the internal water cycle are suitable measures  
to manage the production limitations defeine above. This can be obtained with the help of different 
procedures (e.g. membrane technology).
8.3.2.2	 Food industry,emsland Starke GmbH
The company Emsland Starke GmbH is the most important producer of potato starch in Germany and 
is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of finished starch products, potato protein, amino acids 
and sugar products such as glucose syrup. The parent plant in Emlichheim, established in 1928, has 405 
employees. For the production of potato starch, starch and potato protein, water with drinking water 
quality is used and ultimately disposed of as wastewater (sweeping and washing water, derivate waste 
water)
In 1997, a reverse osmosis installation from the company Stork was commissioned in the Emlichheim 
plant in order to reduce the quantity of wastewater t obe disposed of, to conserve drinking water and to 
recover more protein. The potato pulp wster from starch procution is separated in the crossflow mode 
at an operating pressur eof 40 bar. Tube modules with a total membrane surface area of 5000 m2 filter a 
feed volume flow of 140 m3/h. With daily backwashing and cleaning with commercial enzymatic cleaning 
agents, the servive life of the membrane is about 6000 hours. During the production campaign (about 
120 days per year), the instalation works 24 hours perday, so that the membranes have to be replanced 
after approx.two campains.

The permeate (about 62 m3/h) from the reverse osmosis system is used to wash the potatoes, while 
potato protein is produced from the brine. The remaining potato pulp waster is evaporated. The vapour 
condenstes are fed to a dedicated waste water treatment plant and recycled after fruther treatment at 
drinking water quality into the production process (see also figure 8.11).
Thanks to the closed water cycle, more than 500,000 m3 of water are saved per year (250,000 m3 of washing 
water by the permeate of the reverse osmosis installation and more than 250000 m3 by cosing the cycel 
with the vapour consenstes). Other advantages of the membrane installation are a dreastic reduction in 
the wastewater volume and a higher protein yield.
8.3.2.3	 Malt house
Malt is used as a raw material to produce alcohol from starch-containing materials. Today a large number 
of breweries get malt from commercial malthouse which predominantly use barley (about 2.5 million tons 
per year) and partly wheat for malt production. The malt productionprocess can be broadly subdivided 
into the steps cleaning, soaking, germinating and kilm-drying. Due to high waster consumption for 
washing and soaking, malthouses have to pay high costs for freshwater and waste water disposal.
For wastewater whose pollution load comes mainly from the production of malt from cereals and which 
is discharged directly into a receiving water. Depending on the production process applied, the wasteater 
quantities and concentration may vary significantly from one malthouse ot the other. Wastewater 
constituents include suspended substances (dust, earthy constituents, residues from cereals and husks), 
sugar, nitrogen-contaning substances (soluble protein, vegetable fibrin), inorganic matter, and possibly 
rubber and polyphenols.

For the treatment of malhouse wastewater, membrane technology can be used in various combinations 
which have to be adapted to the specific case. Besides the example described below, treatemnt by 
microfiltration in low pressure operation combined with a biological stage and a closed process water 
cycle is also possible.
The Heidelsheim company H.Durst Malzfabriken GmbH & Co.KG is specialized in malt production for 
Pilsner beear, but also furnishes special malt for other types fo brewing. 25 people are employed in the 
works in Gernsheim, one of the four plants which combined produce about 230000 tons of malt per year.
Large wasewater quantities and disposal costs were motives for Durst Malz to cooperate with Schwander 
GmbH at Bad Vilbel, which together with Frings Recycling-Anlagen GmbH developed the patented 
FriSsh-Verfahen for the treatment of process water in the malt and beverage industry.
Promoted by Hessische Landes-und Treuhandgesellschaft (HLT) Wiesbaden, today Investbank Hessen 
(IBH), an installaiton for the treatment of the malthouse wsteater was commissined in 1997 at Gernsheim. 
Since that time a daily amoutn of 700 m3 of water, consisting of the barley soaking water and the washing 
water fo the production plants, is treated.

AApplication s of membr ane bioreactor
The malthouse wastewater has a high COD content of approx 2500 to 3000 mg/L. By biological  
(SBR process) and physical-chemical (ferric chloride precipiation) treatment, followed by fine filtration, 
this concentratioin is reduced to 30 mg/L in the influent of the reverse osmosis installation. Subsequently, 
spiral-wound modules in the reverse osmosis installation (imb+frings water systems gmbh) with a total 
filter surface area of 1333 remove all undesirable malting residues from thewater at an operating pressure 
of approx 10 bar. The permeate complies with the requriments of the Drinking Water Ordinance and is 
recycled into the barley soaking process. The remaining brine (about 25–30% fo the total inflow to the 
membrane installation) is treated int the municipal wastewater treatemnt plant. In order to ensure the 
opeartion of the spiral-wound modules, and antiscaling agent is used and th emodels are backwashed 
daily with citric acid.
The employement of the memrbaen installation led to a reduction in the water demand and to considerable 
cost saving concerning the wasteater surfachge. Another advantage is the modular construciton of the 
installaiton, as it can be adapted without causing problems to varying production parameters.

AnMBR, readers should have basic understanding of anaerobic digestion. A introduction of anaerobic 
digestion is summarized in the section 9.1 (van Lier et al. 2008), and a brief introduction of AnMBR 
and one of its application are provided in the section of 9.2 and 9.3, respectively.
9.1	
Anaerobic digestion 
The anaerobic degradation pathway of organic matter is a multi-step process of series and parallel 
reactions. Methanogenic bacteria are located at the end of the anaerobic food chain and, partly thanks 
to their activity; no large quantities of organic matter accumulate in anaerobic environments, where this 
matter is inaccessible to aerobic organisms. The anaerobic digestion process involves a complex food web, 
in which organic matter is sequentially degraded by a wide variety of micro-organisms. The microbial 
consortia involved jointly convert complex organic matter and ultimately mineralize it into methane 
(CH4), carbon dioxide CO2, ammonium (NH3), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and water (H2O).
The digestion process may be subdivided into the following four phases: 
9.1.1	
Hydrolysis
Since bacteria are unable to take up particulate organic matter, the first step in anaerobic degradation 
consists of the hydrolysis of polymers. This process is merely a surface phenomenon in which the 
polymeric particles are degraded through the action of exo-enzymes to produce smaller molecules which 
can cross the cell barrier. During the enzymatic hydrolysis process, proteins are hydrolysed to amino 
acids, polysaccharide to simple sugars and lipids to long chain fatty acids (LCFA). Hydrolysis is in most 
cases, notably with (semi-) solid substrates and wastewaters with a high suspended solids (SS)/COD 
ratio, rate-limiting for the overall digestion process. Moreover, the hydrolysis process is very sensitive to 
temperature and temperature fluctuations. For that reason, the design of anaerobic digesters for (semi-) 
solid substrates and wastewaters with a high SS/COD ratio, such as distillery slops and low temperature 
sewage, is usually based on the hydrolysis step.

Hydrolysis can be defined as a process in which complex polymeric substrates, particulate or dissolved, are 
converted into monomeric and dimeric compounds which are readily accessible for the acidogenic bacteria. 
During anaerobic digestion of complex substrates hydrolysis is usually the first step. Although in some 
cases a preparatory step, i.e. physical-chemical pre-treatment, is needed to make hydrolysis possible. With 
the digestion of biological sludges, such as waste activated sludge, the hydrolysis of the sludge is preceded 
by death and lysis of the biomass. The hydrolysis is accomplished by exo-enzymes which are produced 
by the acidogenic bacteria. The products of the hydrolysis are the substrates for the acidogenic bacteria. 
As mentioned, hydrolysis is generally considered to be the rate-limiting step during the anaerobic 
digestion of complex substrates. However, usually this is not due to a lack of enzyme activity but to the 
availability of free accessible surface area of the particles and the overall structure of the solid substrate. 
Even in dilute wastewaters such as low temperature domestic sewage, hydrolysis may determine the 
overall process and thereby determining the required reactor design. It must be noted that 45–75% of 
domestic sewage, and 80% in primary sludge consists of suspended matter. The main biopolymers in 
sewage are proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. 
9.1.2	
Acidogenesis
During the acidogenesis step, the hydrolysis products (amino acids, simple sugars, LCFAs), which are 
relatively small soluble compounds, are diffused inside the bacterial cells through the cell membrane 
and subsequently fermented or anaerobically oxidized. Acidogenesis is a very common reaction and is 
performed by a large group of hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic microorganisms. About 1% of all known 
bacteria are (facultative) fermenters. The acidification products consist of a variety of small organic 
compounds, mainly VFAs, i.e. acetate and higher organic acids such as propionate and butyrate, as well 
as H2, CO2, some lactic acids, ethanol and ammonia.
Characteristically, neutral compounds such as sugars and proteins are converted into VFAs and carbonic 
acid, being the main end products. Therefore, fermentative organisms are usually designated as acidifying 
or acidogenic microorganisms, and the process is therefore indicated by acidogenesis. Table 9.1 lists 
several acidogenic reactions starting from sucrose and generating different amounts of VFAs, HCO3
-, 
H2, H+. Apparently, the type of end products depends on the conditions in the reactor medium. From 
Table 9.1 it follows that the ΔG° of the less energetic acidogenic reactions with sucrose as the substrate 
strongly depends on the prevailing H2 concentrations. If H2 is effectively removed by H2 scavenging 
organisms such as methanogens, acetate will be the main end product. However, if methanogenesis is 
retarded and H2 accumulates, more reduced products such as propionate and butyrate are likely to appear 
and possibly the even more reduced compounds lactate and alcohols. Therefore, effluents of overloaded 
or perturbed anaerobic reactors (or reactors designed as acidifying reactors in an anaerobic two-step 
process) often contain these more reduced intermediate products.

Table 9.1 Acidogenic reactors with sucrose as the substrate and the corresponding free energy change (∆GO) at oC
Table 9.2 Averaged kinetic properties of acidifiers and methanogens
Acidogenesis is the most rapid conversion step in the anaerobic food chain. The ΔG° of acidifying 
reactions is highest of all anaerobic conversions, resulting in ten to twentyfold higher bacterial growth 
rates, and fivefold higher bacterial yields and conversion rates compared to methanogens (Table 9.2). 
For that reason, anaerobic reactors are subjected to souring, i.e. a sudden pH drop, when reactors are 
overloaded or perturbed by toxic compounds. Once alkalinity is consumed by the produced acids the 
pH starts to drop, resulting in a higher concentration of non-dissociated VFAs, leading to a more severe 
inhibition of methanogens. The latter, obviously leads to an even quicker accumulation of VFAs and 
subsequent pH drop (Figure 9.1).

The fact that acidifiers are active even at low pH (4), means the reactor souring to pH 4 to 5 can and 
will occur when the methanogenic capacity of the system is trespassed. 
The acidogenic conversion of amino acids generally follows the Stickland reaction, in which an amino 
acid is de-ammonified by anaerobic oxidation yielding also VFA and H2, in conjunction with the reductive 
deammonification of other amino acids consuming the produced H2. From both reactions NH3 is released 
and subsequently acts as a proton acceptor, thus leading to a pH increase. In this reaction there is no 
net proton production and there is no chance of reactor pH drop. 
9.1.3	
Acetogenesis
The short chain fatty acids (SCFA), other than acetate, which are produced in the acidogenesis step are 
further converted to acetate, hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide by the acetogenic bacteria. The most 
important acetogenic substrates are propionate and butyrate, key intermediates in the anaerobic digestion 
process. But also lactate, ethanol, methanol and even H2 and CO2 are (homo) acetogenically converted 
to acetate as shown in Figure 9.2 and Table 9.3. LCFAs are converted by specific acetogenic bacteria 
following the so-called β-oxidation in which acetate moieties are split from the aliphatic chain (Table 
9.3). LCFAs with uneven C atoms also yield propionate next to acetate. Non-saturated LCFAs like oleate 
and linoleate are firstly saturated by H2 addition prior to the β-oxidation. The acetogenic bacteria are 
obligate hydrogen producers and their metabolism is inhibited by hydrogen, which immediately follows 
from the stoichiometric conversion reaction, such as for propionate:

and a pressure of 1 atm (101 kPa). Water is regarded as a pure liquid, and all soluble compounds have an activity of 1 mol/kg
Studies carried out on acetogenic conversions have elucidated the required narrow associations between 
the H2-producing acetogenic bacteria and the H2-consuming methanogenic bacteria, thereby regulating 
the H2 level in their environment. This is of vital importance as these reactions are thermodynamically 
unfavourable, indicated by the positive ΔG° in Table 9.3. From this table it follows that the reactions for 
ethanol, butyrate, propionate and the LCFAs palmitate will not occur under standard conditions, as the 
ΔG° is positive, and thus the bacterial energy yield is negative. 
However, under stabilised digestion conditions the hydrogen partial pressure is maintained at an 
extremely low level. This can be achieved by an effective uptake of the hydrogen by methanogens or 
sulphate reducing bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria usually utilize molecular hydrogen in the anaerobic 
digester so rapidly that the hydrogen partial pressure drops below 10-4 atm, which is enough to ensure 
the actual occurrence of the hydrogen producing acetogenic reaction (Figure 9.3).

Figure 9.3 Free energy change as a function of the H2 partial pressure.  
A negative ΔG° indicates possible occurrence of the mentioned reaction
This interdependence means that the degradation of higher fatty acids and alcohols largely depends on 
the activity of electron scavenging organisms such as methanogenic bacteria. Microbial associations in 
which a H2-producing organism can grow only in the presence of a H2-consuming organism are called 
syntrophic associations. The coupling of formation and use of H2 is called interspecies hydrogen transfer. 
In a properly functioning methane-producing installation, the partial hydrogen pressure will not exceed 
10-4 atm and is usually between 10-4–10-6 atm. At such a low hydrogen concentration, the degradation of 
ethanol, butyrate or propionate becomes exergonic and will yield energy for the acetogens. 
Similar to the other acetogenic substrates, LCFA conversion is highly endergonic and often limits the 
entire digestion process. Trials with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were only partly 
successful as LCFA tend to absorb to the sludge forming fatty clumps of biomass with little if any 
methanogenic activity. Expanded bed reactors, in which the LCFA is more evenly distributed over the 
available biomass were more successful. Other authors propose in fact to use the absorptive capacity of 
the sludge and periodically load the sludge with LCFA after which solid state digestion will convert the 
absorbed matter to CH4. Such a sequencing bed mode of operation requires multiple reactors to treat a 
continuous flow wastewater.

9.1.4	
Methanogenesis
Methanogenic bacteria accomplish the final stage in the overall anaerobic conversion of organic matter to 
methane and carbon dioxide. During this fourth and last stage of anaerobic degradation of organic matter, 
a group of methanogenic archea both reduce the carbon dioxide using hydrogen as electron donor and 
decarboxylate acetate to form CH4. It is only in this stage when the influent COD is converted to a gaseous 
form that automatically leaves the reactor system. Methanogens are obligate anaerobes, with a very narrow 
substrate spectrum. Some can only use certain determined substrates such as acetate, methylamines, 
methanol, formate, and H2/CO2 or CO. For engineering purposes, methanogens are classified into two major 
groups: the acetate converting or aceticlastic methanogens and the hydrogen utilising or hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens (Table 9.4). Generally, about 70 % of the produced methane originates from acetate as the main 
precursor. The rest mainly originates from H2 and CO2. The growth rate of the aceticlastic methanogens is 
very low, resulting in doubling times of several days or even more. The extremely low growth rates explain 
why anaerobic reactors require a very long start-up time with unadapted seed material and why high sludge 
concentrations are pursued. Hydrogenotrophic bacteria have a much higher maximum growth rate than 
the acetoclastic bacteria with doubling times of 4 to 12 hours. Because of this feature and despite the very 
delicate acetogenic reaction step discussed in the previous section, anaerobic high rate reactor systems 
exert a remarkable stability under varying conditions.

Methanosarcina spp. are characterised by a coccoid shape, appearing in small grape-like clumps, and have 
a relative wide substrate spectrum as they can convert a.o. acetate, H2/CO2, methylamines, methanol, 
and formate. They have a relatively high μmax and relative low substrate affinity. Methanosaeta spp. are 
filamentous, appear in large spaghetti like conglomerates can only convert acetate and are kinetically 
characterised by a low μmax and a very high substrate affinity. Although the μmax of the latter organism 
is significantly lower, Methanosaeta spp. are the most common acetotrophic methanogens in anaerobic 
high rate systems based on high solids retention times, such as sludge bed systems and anaerobic filters. 
The reason for this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that wastewater treatment systems always 
aim at the lowest possible effluent concentrations, while substrate concentrations inside biofilms or 
sludge granules of the mentioned anaerobic systems approaches ‘zero’ when bulk liquid concentrations 
are low. Under such conditions, Methanosaeta spp. species have a clear kinetic advantage over the 
Methanosarcina spp. (Figure 9.5).

Once the Methanosaeta spp. dominates the sludge bed, a very effective wastewater treatment system 
is obtained, reaching extremely low effluent acetate concentrations. Considering the inferior kinetic 
properties at low substrate concentrations and the inferior adherence properties of Methanosarcina spp., 
it is advised to keep the effluent acetate concentrations at a very low level during the first start-up of an 
anaerobic reactor with un-adapted seed material.

Anaerobic MBR 
The anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) process was developed and tested in the mid 1990’s and 
been used in full-scale since 2000. It was concluded that in 2008 there were fourteen full-scale AnMBR 
installations operating in Japan treating alcohol production stillage, organic wastes, septage wastewater 
treatment sludge, and a variety of residues from food processing (e.g., dairy, potato, confectionery, etc.). 
Pilot-scale AnMBR studies were also carried out on potato processing wastewater and has shown very 
favourable results providing maximum biogas production, producing less waste sludge and a superior 
effluent quality. The first full-scale AnMBR system in North America was installed at Ken’s Foods in 
Massachusetts, USA in 2008. It provides waste treatment and energy production from salad dressing 
and BBQ sauce wastewater (Liao et al. 2006).
The AnMBR process provides numerous process advantages over conventional anaerobic 
wastewater treatment processes including (Liao et al. 2006):
1.	 A superior quality effluent is produced on a consistent basis. Typically, the AnMBR effluent 
quality is sufficient to significantly reduce, and sometimes even completely avoid, aerobic 
post-treatment.
2.	 High-rate organic loading rates (10 to 15 kg COD/m3·d) are achievable, minimizing reactor 
size and footprint of the treatment plant.

3.	 Suspended solids (TSS) removal is not required ahead of the process. In some cases, fat/oil/
grease (FOG) removal is not required either. This allows TSS and FOG to be digested which 
simplifies the overall system; eliminates primary treatment; increases biogas yield; and 
reduces waste sludge production, handling and disposal, and associated costs.
4.	 Waste activated sludge from a downstream aerobic process can be digested in the AnMBR 
system. This, again, simplifies the overall process; increases biogas yield; and further reduces 
sludge production, handling and disposal, and associated costs.
5.	 Complete retention of biomass (by use of membranes) assures a consistently high degree of 
treatment with negligible effluent TSS concentrations and superior process stability.
6.	 Granular sludge is not required, eliminating costs associated with obtaining granular seed 
sludge and maintaining this type of special sludge in the system.

A application of anaerobic MBR 
An AnMBR pilot study was operated on site at Ken’s Foods from September 2007 to March 2008 to 
evaluate the AnMBR treatment process as a means of upgrading their existing anaerobic treatment 
system which was space-limited. The pilot study results concluded that the AnMBR process was suitable 
for meeting the final effluent limits on a consistent basis (without post-aerobic biological treatment for 
BOD/TSS removal). Also, the system would easily increase operating capacity with minimal additional 
footprint due its ability to operate at higher biomass concentrations and organic loading rates. Based 
on the successful pilot study, Ken’s Foods contracted ADI Systems to design and construct the full-scale 
AnMBR system in early 2008; it was commissioned in July 2008 (Christian et al. 2010).

Figure 9.6 presents a process flow diagram of the AnMBR system. The AnMBR system consists of an 
existing proprietary 8300 m3 reactor and four new anaerobic membrane tanks (each with a working 
volume of 100 m3) equipped with Kubota submerged membrane cassettes. The membrane tanks operate 
in conjunction with the existing BVF reactor and have a continuous recycle loop in between. Seed 
sludge for the four anaerobic membrane tanks consisted of effluent TSS from the existing anaerobic BVF 
reactor and was concentrated by managing sludge recycle flow from the AnMBR tanks to the existing 
BVF reactor. Using the existing anaerobic system biomass as seed sludge enabled the AnMBR to begin 
treating 100 percent organic load and flow during the first week of commissioning (Christian et al. 2010).
The overall system also includes sludge recycle and effluent pumps, biogas scour blowers, process piping 
and valving, membrane cleaning chemical system, and instrumentation and control. A removable 
geomembrane cover system on each membrane tank provides a gas tight seal with biogas collection 
capabilities (Christian et al. 2010).
The AnMBR system was commissioned in July 2008 and is operated at mesophilic conditions with an 
average operating temperature of 33 °C for all four membrane tanks. The temperature is controlled 
through a spiral heat exchanger, with heat supplied by a biogas-fuelled hot water boiler. The continuous 
recycle of biomass between the BVF and the AnMBR tanks also provides the means of maintaining the 
temperature at the mesophilic condition. The average pH in the AnMBR is maintained well at 6.9 ± 0.1 
for anaerobic sludge acclimatization (Christian et al. 2010).

The AnMBR system was designed to treat 475 m3/d of raw wastewater with wastewater characteristics 
of 39,000 mg/l COD, 18,000 mg/l BOD, and 12,000 mg/l TSS. Due to the fluctuating influent flow and 
varying wastewater characteristic, the actual influent flow is 300 ± 70 m3/d with 33,500 ± 9,350 mg/l 
COD and 10,900 ± 3,200 mg/l TSS. The AnMBR system consistently produces an effluent with non-
detectable TSS concentrations and COD and BOD concentrations of 209 ± 39 mg/l and 16 ± 5 mg/l, 
corresponding to COD and BOD removals of 99.4 and 99.9 percent, respectively (Christian et al. 2010).

Figure 9.8 influent and effluent TSS concentration (Christian et al. 2010)
The system also provides complete digestion of the raw wastewater fat, oil, and grease concentrations 
providing for further biogas generation and better management of biomass and suspended solids 
concentration (Christian et al. 2010).
The AnMBR MLSS concentration ranges from 20,000 to 45,000 mg/l with an average of 23,000 mg/l in the 
four membrane tanks. The submerged Kubota membrane units provide a near-absolute barrier to block 
all suspended solids from escaping to the effluent, resulting in a very high quality effluent compared to 
conventional anaerobic technologies that rely on gravity settling in the reactor. The MLSS concentration 
is a function of sludge viscosity. Continuous sludge recycle from the anaerobic membrane tanks to the 
pre-existing BVF reactor minimizes the occurrence of sludge thickening or rapid increases in viscosity 
in the anaerobic membrane tanks. The average viscosity of the mixed liquor in four membrane tanks is 
145 cP (Christian et al. 2010).
Since the AnMBR effluent contains no suspended solids, a waste sludge metering pump with piping 
connected to the AnMBR tanks sludge recycle piping to the final effluent discharge point allows Ken’s 
Foods to discharge anaerobic sludge to the sewer freely while keeping within its TSS discharge limit of 
less than 230 kg/d. Therefore, no sludge has been intentionally wasted from the AnMBR system to the 
existing sludge dewatering system (resulting in a significant savings in dewatering chemicals) (Christian 
et al. 2010).

The AnMBR system operating flux rate ranged from 0.06 to 0.10 m3/m2.d; the design flux is 0.10 m3/
m2.d. Figure 9.9 presents the transmembrane pressure (TMP) trend for each membrane tank over the 
past 20 months. Membrane cleaning is required when the TMP reaches 10 kPa (40 inches of water 
column). Some membranes in the system (three of four membrane compartments) were cleaned in situ 
on one occasion during the first 20 months of operation, as per scheduled maintenance activities; other 
membranes (in the fourth compartment) have still not been cleaned after 20 months of continuous 
operation. Operation to-date has resulted in an operating TMP of 12 inches of water column or less 
indicated that the membranes perform very well and that membrane fouling is not an issue (Christian 
et al. 2010).
Figure 9.9 membrane performances (TMP) for each AnMBR tank (Christian et al. 2010)
The first 20 months of AnMBR system operation resulted in over a 50 percent reduction in operating 
expenses for the wastewater treatment plant compared to the prior 12 month fiscal period. This reduction 
was directly attributable to the increased system capacity, ability to treat wastewater with higher biomass 
in the AnMBR system, and elimination of the need to dewater and dispose of dewatered solids, and 
significant reduction in aeration power requirements for the existing SBR (Christian et al. 2010).
