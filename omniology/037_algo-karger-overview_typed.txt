Goals	  for	  These	  Lectures	  
•  Further	  prac(ce	  with	  randomized	  algorithms	  
– In	  a	  new	  applica(on	  domain	  (graphs)	  
•  Introduc(on	  to	  graphs	  and	  graph	  algorithms	  
Also: “only” 20 years ago!

Graphs	  
Two ingredients 
•  Vertices aka nodes (V) 
•  Edges (E) = pairs of vertices 
•  can be undirected [unordered pair] 
or directed [ordered pair] (aka arcs) 
Examples: road networks, the Web, social networks, 
precedence constraints, etc.

Cuts	  of	  Graphs	  
Definition: a cut of a graph (V, E) is a partition of V into two 
non-empty sets A and B. 
Definition: the crossing edges of a cut (A, B) are those with: 
•  the one endpoint in each of (A, B) [undirected] 
•  tail in A, head in B [directed] 
[undirected] 
[directed]

The	  Minimum	  Cut	  Problem	  
•  INPUT:  An undirected graph G = ( V, E ). 
[ Parallel                edges allowed] 
[See other video for representation of the input] 
•  GOAL: Compute a cut with fewest number of crossing 
edges. (a min cut)

What	  is	  the	  number	  of	  edges	  crossing	  a	  minimum	  cut	  in	  the	  graph	  
shown	  below?	  

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
A	  Few	  Applica(ons	  
•  indentify network bottlenecks / weaknesses 
•  community detection in social networks 
•  image segmentation 
•  input = graph of pixels 
•  use edge weights     
[(u,v) has large weight      “expect” u,v to come from 
some object] 
hope: repeated min cuts identifies the primary objects in 
picture.
