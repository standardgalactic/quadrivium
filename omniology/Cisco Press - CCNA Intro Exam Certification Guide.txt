Dedications
Chris Cleveland is the best Development Editor I could imagine working with. So, instead of 
just the usual “Thanks Chris for doing an excellent job,” I’d like to dedicate this book to 
Chris. Chris, it’s an absolute pleasure to work with the best in the business —thanks for your 
fantastic help and support!
Acknowledgments
The technical editing team for this book and its companion volume was fantastic! Not only did they 
ﬁnd where I had simply written the wrong technical facts, but they also helped me ﬁnd new, more 
interesting, and clearer ways to convey certain facts about networking. Lynn was particular helpful 
with comments that helped keep small sections in line with the overall theme of the chapter—a skill 
I’m sure he developed as a result of having written books himself. Martin helped a lot with technical 
detail and perspectives from what customers see every day today. And Elan excelled in noticing both 
the small nit-picky errors and the signiﬁcant technical problems. (And that’s not an insult—every 
technical author loves help in ﬁnding the small problems!) Together, these three gentlemen formed 
a great team, with complementary skills. Thanks so much, guys!
The production team, headed by Patrick Kanouse, did its usual excellent job. Like the 
behind-the-scenes people in many businesses, their speciﬁc efforts may not be obvious to the 
public, but it’s no less appreciated by me. In particular, Marc Fowler, the project editor, did 
an incredible job working through these two books on a very tight schedule, with his usual 
excellent work. You folks make me look good on paper all the time—if only you could be in 
charge of my wardrobe, too—I’d look good all the time!
Brett Bartow, executive editor, did his usual New-York-Yankees-like job in helping steer these 
two projects to completion. In between talking about sports, Brett worked through the many 
changes in direction with this book and helped guide us to the right product. And, yes, so the 
whole world knows, he did pick an Atlanta Braves player, John Smoltz, for his fantasy league 
baseball team—again proving he’s a really smart guy.
Chris “develops” books for Cisco Press. What does that mean? Well, it means that he takes 
the Word documents and ﬁgures from geeky authors, and makes their writing become 
understandable. He takes the input from technical editors, and combines all the comments 
into a single word document, making the author’s life easier. He constantly ﬁnds ways to 
rephrase, reword, and improve the manuscript. He manages all the work with the authors. 
And he always works to optimize the author’s time, taking away some of the unpleasant part 
of the work, so that the author can worry about the technical details. Chris has worked with 
me on 6 projects now, and every time, he has done an excellent job. His work ethic goes far 
beyond the call of duty, and his performance is consistently excellent. To quote a few other 
authors as well: “Chris has taken all of the difﬁculty (of writing) out of the picture”, “Chris 
has absolutely spoiled me and completely amazes me”, and “He even helped me with my 
daughter’s homework”. Whatever, however, to make the book better, with an eye towards 
the least pain for the author, Chris is on top of it. Thanks, Chris, for all you do!

Introduction: Overview of Certiﬁcation and How to Succeed
Congratulations! If you’re reading far enough to look at the introduction to this book, then 
you’ve probably already decided to go for your Cisco Certiﬁed Network Associate (CCNA) 
certiﬁcation. Cisco System’s entry-level certiﬁcation, CCNA, has a reputation as one of the 
most valuable entry-level certiﬁcations in the computing industry. Although getting your 
CCNA does not guarantee you a ﬁrst networking job or a new job, it will certainly help 
convince others that you know what you are talking about. 
Cisco’s CCNA certiﬁcation proves that you have a ﬁrm foundation in the most important 
components of the Cisco product line—namely, routers and switches. It also proves that you 
have a broad knowledge of protocols and networking technologies. CCNA is not an easy 
certiﬁcation to get, but it is well worth the effort. In a booming economy, CCNA is the ﬁrst 
step toward getting a higher salary than your noncertiﬁed peers. In a difﬁcult economy, it 
could be the difference between whether a prospective employer even looks at your résumé. 
Regardless of your local economy, CCNA does improve how people in the marketplace view 
your skill level.
People ask me for career advice from time to time, and my answer is typically the same: If 
you want to be in the networking industry at all, you need to know Cisco. Cisco has some 
ridiculous market shares in the router and switch marketplace, with more than 80% market 
share in some markets. In many geographies and many markets, networking equals Cisco. If 
you want to be taken seriously as a network engineer, you need a CCNA certiﬁcation. 
Frankly, you probably also need to be working toward a more advanced Cisco certiﬁcation 
as well—but ﬁrst things ﬁrst! CCNA requires some time and effort.
Cisco’s Motivation: Certifying Partners
Cisco’s primary motivation for creating CCNA and most of the other Cisco certiﬁcations is 
to help determine the skill levels of its partners. Cisco fulﬁlls only a small portion of its orders 
through direct sale from Cisco; most often, a Cisco reseller is involved. (Cisco calls resellers 
channel partners.) Also, Cisco encourages partners to perform most consulting and 
implementation services relating to Cisco products. While working heavily with partners, 
Cisco needed to know which partners truly had the right skills. So, Cisco created many 
certiﬁcations, including CCNA.
Cisco measures the technical readiness of channel partners (resellers) and professional 
services partners in part by requiring speciﬁc numbers of Cisco certiﬁed employees. For 
instance, Premier, Silver, and Gold Channel Partners are required to have either two or four 
CCNAs on staff, along with Cisco professional- and expert-level certiﬁed individuals. 

xviii 
So, what does that mean to you? Well, if you already have some Cisco certiﬁcations on your 
résumé, you are more valuable to Cisco partners. In today’s competitive environment, every 
edge counts—so having the right Cisco certiﬁcations can help you get that next job. In 
particular, the CCNA certiﬁcation is a prerequisite for almost every Cisco certiﬁcation, so it 
is the right place to start.
The CCNA Certiﬁcation Exams: What, There’s More than One Exam?
For the ﬁrst time since Cisco announced CCNA in 1998, the CCNA certiﬁcation has an 
option for multiple exams. Before Cisco announced these latest changes around summer of 
2003, to get your CCNA certiﬁcation, you just passed a single “CCNA exam.” With this 
latest generation of the CCNA, you can either take a single exam to get your CCNA, or you 
can take two exams, with each of these exams covering a subset of the CCNA exam topics. 
Table I-1 lists the exams.
So, you either take the CCNA exam or you take both the INTRO and the ICND exam to 
pass CCNA. 
Like most Cisco certiﬁcation exams, the names of the INTRO and the ICND exams come 
from two Cisco Authorized courses. Cisco’s INTRO course covers a broad range of topics, 
from Ethernet cabling to virtual private networks (VPNs). The Interconnecting Cisco 
Network Devices (ICND) course dives more deeply into core Cisco technology and 
protocols, in particular, switching and routing. Whereas the INTRO course covers a broader 
range of topics to a small amount of depth, the ICND course covers fewer topics but to more 
depth. Like their namesakes, the INTRO and ICND exams cover similar depth and breadth.
The CCNA exam simply covers everything on both the INTRO and ICND exams. So, if you 
want to save some cash and you are conﬁdent that you are ready to answer questions across 
the whole range of topics for CCNA, you can take just the CCNA exam itself. Alternately, 
you can focus on the INTRO exam ﬁrst, master those topics, pass the exam, and then move 
on to the ICND exam.

Format of the CCNA Exams
The INTRO, ICND, and CCNA exams all follow the same general format. When you get to 
the testing center and check in, the proctor will give you some general instructions and then 
take you into a quiet room with a PC. When you’re at the PC, you have a few things to do 
before the timer starts on your exam—for instance, you can take a sample quiz, just to get 
accustomed to the PC and to the testing engine. Anyone who has user-level skills in getting 
around a PC will have no problems with the testing envinronment.
When you start the exam, you will be asked a series of questions. You answer the question 
and then move on to the next question. The exam engine does not let you go back and change 
your answer. Yes, that’s true—when you move on to the next question, that’s it for the earlier 
question.
The exam questions can be in the following format:
■
Multiple choice
■
Fill-in-the-blank
■
Drag-and-drop
■
Simulated lab
The multiple choice format simply requires that you point and click on a circle beside the 
correct answer(s). If more than one answer is required, the questions traditionally have told 
you how many answers to choose. Fill-in-the-blank questions require that you type in the 
answer, so you must get the answer exactly correct.
Drag-and-drop questions require you to left-click and hold, move a button or icon to another 
area, and release the clicker to place the object somewhere else—typically into a list. So, for 
some questions, to get the question correct, you might need to put a list of ﬁve things into 
the proper order.
Finally, the type of question that gives most people a scare before the exam is the simulated 
lab question. The exam engine actually gives you an interface into a network with several 
routers, and you must log in and troubleshoot a scenario. To solve the problem, you need to 
be able to navigate through the user interface, know several commands, and possibly 
conﬁgure something that has been misconﬁgured. You should also save your conﬁgurations, 
unless the question tells you not to save it, just in case.
The best way to prepare for simulated lab questions is to practice with real gear. You can 
actually ﬁnd sites where CCNA lab access is free over the Internet—I did a search from 
www.google.com tonight, searching for “free CCNA labs,” and the ﬁrst three hits were 
(seemingly) legitimate offers for free lab access for CCNA study. You can also use a simulator 

xx 
product, such as Cisco Press’s CCNA Router and Switch eSIM. A special version of Boson’s 
Netsim product, compiled speciﬁcally for this book, is also included on the CD that comes 
with this book. 
What’s on the CCNA Exam(s)?
Ever since I was in grade school, whenever the teacher announced that we were having a test 
soon, someone would always ask, “What’s on the test?” Even in college, people would try to 
get more infomrmation about what would be on the exams. At heart, the goal is to know 
what to study hard, what to study a little, and what to not study at all.
Cisco does want you to know what topics to study and wants you to be well prepared for 
your exams. However, Cisco does not want to be so speciﬁc that you could just memorize a 
certain set of facts and pass the exams. In short, Cisco wants you to pass the exams because 
you know your stuff, not because you memorized a set of questions that someone posted 
(possibly illegally) on an Internet site. 
So, what can be said about the content of the exams? First, Cisco posts exam topics for each 
exam. This ofﬁcial posting is the basis for what Cisco intends to put on the exams, so you 
should pay particularly close attention to this list. Also, the breadth and depth of topics on 
the exams tend to match the Cisco Authorized courses with which they are associated, so it 
is useful to know the outlines for those courses. Finally, Cisco designs the Cisco Networking 
Academy Program (CNAP) course materials with CCNA in mind. Looking at all these 
sources can help give you insight into CCNA.
INTRO Exam Topics
Carefully consider the exam topics posted by Cisco on its web site as you study, particularly 
for clues as to how deeply you should know each topic. The exam topics use action words 
that follow a quasi-standard called Bloom’s Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain. Bloom’s 
taxonomy deﬁnes a standard for word usage for when educators create objectives for 
courses. Objectives written according to Bloom’s taxonomy deﬁne what the learner (student) 
should be able to accomplish after taking the class. So, when you look at an exam topic, look 
for the action word. If you want to see a description of Bloom’s taxonomy, search the 
Internet, and you will ﬁnd a lot of matches. My favorite quick list of terms is at 
http://chiron.valdosta.edu/whuitt/col/cogsys/bloom.html. 
The action word in the exam topic gives you a good hint about the level of knowledge and 
skill you will need to have before taking the exam. For instance, a course objective that uses 
the word list as the action word then means that you should be able to list the features, but 

 xxi
an action word such as conﬁgure means that you should know all the related conﬁguration 
commands and how to use them. Troubleshoot might mean that you need to know what all 
the show and debug commands do for a particular topic.
So, what does Bloom’s taxonomy mean in terms of how you study for the exam? It means 
that you should focus on the action words in the exam topics and make sure that you can do 
those things for the stated topics. For instance, if an exam topic says something like 
“Conﬁgure RIP,” then do not study just RIP concepts, but also study the conﬁguration details 
because the exam topic speciﬁcally tells you that you need to know how to perform 
conﬁguration. 
In addition, Cisco adds a disclaimer that the posted exam topics for all of its certiﬁcation 
exams are guidelines. Cisco makes the effort to keep the exam questions within the conﬁnes 
of the stated exam objectives, but doing this for every question and every exam is difﬁcult. 
Thus, you could see questions that fall outside both the scope and the depth implied by the 
exam topics. However, if you follow the Cisco exam topic “guidelines,” you should have a 
good understanding of the breadth and depth of topics on the exam.
Table I-2 lists the exam topics for the INTRO exam. You can ﬁnd the ICND exam topics in 
the Introduction to the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide and on www.cisco.com. 
Note that although Cisco’s posted exam topics are not numbered, we do number them in the 
Cisco Press Exam Certiﬁcation Guide series for easier reference. Also note that Cisco has 
historically changed exam topics without changing the exam number, so do not be alarmed 
if small changes in the exam topics occur over time. When in doubt, go to www.cisco.com, 
click Learning and Events, and select Career Certiﬁcations and Paths.

Cross-Reference Between Exam Topics and Book Parts
Table I-3 provides a cross-reference between the exam topics and the book parts in which 
they are covered. 
CCNA Exam Topics
Interestingly, the CCNA (640-801) exam topics posted by Cisco are not simply the 
combination of the INTRO exam topics and the ICND exam topics. If you look closely, the 
CCNA exam topics match more closely to the ICND exam topics than they do to the INTRO 
exam topics. 
So, for those of you planning to take the single CCNA exam, what does that mean? Well, for 
practical purposes, the CCNA exam covers all the topics covered on both the INTRO and 
ICND exams. However, the length of the CCNA exam does not allow Cisco to ask you about

every possible fact. So, you should expect the CCNA exam to include questions that cover 
more advanced topics, many of which require that you know the more basic facts. For 
instance, rather than ask a question about how to do binary math, which is speciﬁcally 
mentioned for the INTRO exam topics, you might have to derive subnet numbers – which 
requires you to use binary math. Another example: instead of describing LAN cabling, you 
might have a question about troubleshooting a LAN topology, and need to decide if an 
incorrect type of cable was used. So, while the exam topics do not exactly match up, but you 
essentially need to know all the same concepts on both the INTRO and ICND exams in order 
to succeed on the CCNA exam.

INTRO and ICND Course Outlines
Another way to get some direction about the topics on the exams is to look at the course 
outlines for the related courses. Cisco offers the Introduction to Cisco Networking (INTRO) 
and Interconnection Cisco Network Devices (ICND) courses through its Certiﬁed Learning 
Solutions Providers (CLSP); CLSPs, in turn, work with other learning partners as well.
The INTRO course covers a much broader set of topics than does ICND, but for the topics 
it covers, ICND covers the topics to much greater detail. In particular, ICND includes a lot 
more information about commands used on routers and switches to conﬁgure and 
troubleshoot the various features.

About the CCNA INTRO Exam Certiﬁcation Guide and CCNA 
ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide 
As mentioned earlier in this introduction, you can take both the INTRO and ICND exams 
to acquire CCNA certiﬁcation, or you can take a single CCNA exam. Because of the 
signiﬁcantly expanded topics as compared with the previous CCNA exam, there was simply 
too much material for a single book. So, we simply created two books—one for the INTRO 
exam and one for the ICND exam.
The contents of the two books, however, were actually designed for both the single-exam and 
dual-exam audience. For those of you preparing just for the INTRO exam, you can read just 
this book. Similarly, if you have passed the INTRO exam and you want to study for the 
ICND exam, you can use just the other book. However, if you are studying for the CCNA 
exam, you can use both books, and alternate between reading different parts of each book 
to optomize your effort in preparing for the exam. This introduction includes a reading plan 
for anyone taking the CCNA exam, directing you on the order in which to read the chapters 
in the two books. Essentially, you would read the ﬁrst three parts of this book and then start 
alternating, reading an entire part of the other book, coming back here for a part, going back 
to the other book, and so on, for most of the parts of both books. The parts are named so 
that it is obvious which sections to read as you move between the books. By doing so, you 
complete all the coverage in a particular technical area before moving on to another.
Objectives and Methods
The most important and somewhat obvious objective of this book is to help you pass the 
INTRO exam or the CCNA exam. In fact, if the primary objective of this book were 
different, the book’s title would be misleading! However, the methods used in this book to 
help you pass the exams are also designed to make you much more knowledgeable about 
how to do your job. 
This book uses several key methodologies to help you discover the exam topics on which you 
need more review, to help you fully understand and remember those details, and to help you 
prove to yourself that you have retained your knowledge of those topics. So, this book does 
not try to help you pass the exams only by memorization, but by truly learning and 
understanding the topics. The CCNA certiﬁcation is the foundation for many of the Cisco 
professional certiﬁcations, and it would be a disservice to you if this book did not help you 
truly learn the material. Therefore, this book helps you pass the CCNA exam by using the 
following methods:
■
Helping you discover which exam topics you have not mastered
■
Providing explanations and information to ﬁll in your knowledge gaps

xxviii 
■
Supplying exercises that enhance your ability to recall and deduce the answers to test 
questions
■
Providing practice exercises on the topics and the testing process via test questions on 
the CD
Book Features
To help you customize your study time using these books, the core chapters have several 
features that help you make the best use of your time:
■
“Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes—Each chapter begins with a quiz that helps you 
determine the amount of time you need to spend studying that chapter. If you follow the 
directions at the beginning of the chapter, the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz directs 
you to study all or particular parts of the chapter.
■
Foundation Topics—These are the core sections of each chapter. They explain the 
protocols, concepts, and conﬁguration for the topics in that chapter. If you need to learn 
about the topics in a chapter, read the “Foundation Topics” section.
■
Foundation Summary—Near the end of each chapter, a summary collects the most 
important information from the chapter summarized in lists, tables, and ﬁgures. The 
“Foundation Summary” section is designed to help you review the key concepts in the 
chapter if you scored well on the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. This section is an 
excellent tool for last-minute review.
■
Q&A—Each chapter ends with a Q&A section that forces you to exercise your recall of 
the facts and processes described inside that chapter. The questions are generally harder 
than the actual exam, partly because the questions are in short-answer format instead of 
multiple choice. These questions are a great way to increase the accuracy of your 
recollection of the facts.
■
CD-based practice exam—The companion CD contains a large number of questions not 
included in the book, as well as all the questions from the “Do I Know This Already” 
quizzes. You can answer these questions by using the simulated exam feature or the 
topical review feature. This is the best tool for helping you prepare for the test-taking 
process.
■
Hands-on practice using Boson Netsim™ LE—The CD also includes the Boson Netsim 
for CCNA INTRO Learning Edition network simulator, supporting the ability to 
perform many of the commands covered in the book. In particular, you can perform 
many of the practice scenarios and hands-on lab exercises also included on the CD, as 
well as several from the book. Appendix C details how to access the simulator, and what 
lab exercises can be performed. (The version of the Boson NetSim software included 

 xxix
with this book is a limited functionality version.  In order to access all functions and 
features of the software, you must purchase a full license for the software from Boson 
Software, Inc.)
■
CD-based practice scenarios—The companion CD contains a CD-only appendix B 
(which is a totally different appendix as compared with the printed appendix B in the 
book) which has several practice scenarios. These scenarios include several problem 
statements, with solutions, in order to help you pull both concepts and conﬁguration 
commands together. These scenarios are useful for building your hands-on skills, even if 
you do not have lab gear. You can also perform some of these scenarios using the Boson 
NetSim LE network simulator, or using your own lab gear. 
■
CD-based lab exercises—The companion CD contains a CD-only appendix C (which is 
a totally different appendix as compared with the printed appendix C in the book) which 
has several lab exercises. These lab exercises guide you through the steps used to perform 
the most popular conﬁguration tasks. Like the scenarios, CD-only appendix C includes 
the answers to the labs, making it useful to just read the materials for extra reinforcement 
of the commands. You can also perform these labs using the Boson NetSim LE network 
simulator, or using your own lab gear.
■
CD-based subnetting practice—The companion CD contains an appendix that has 25 
additional subnetting practice problems. Each problem shows the solutions for the 
subnet number, broadcast address, and valid IP addresses in each subnet. With this extra 
practice, you can be ready to answer subnetting questions quickly and accurately on the 
INTRO, ICND, and CCNA exams.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains 15 core chapters—Chapters 1 through 15, with Chapter 16 including 
some summary materials and suggestions for how to approach the actual exams. Each core  
chapter covers a subset of the topics on the INTRO exam. The core chapters are organized 
into sections. The core chapters cover the following topics:
Part I: Networking Fundamentals
■
Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Networking Concepts”—This chapter provides 
a very basic introduction for those who are brand new to networking.
■
Chapter 2, “The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models”—Chapter 2 introduces the 
terminology surrounding two different networking architectures, namely Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). 
This chapters also compares the new protocol architectural models.
■
Chapter 3, “Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs”—TCP/IP and OSI both 
have several protocols and functions performed at the data link layer. This chapter 
covers the concepts and terms used for the most popular option for the data link layer 
for local-area networks (LANs), namely Ethernet. 

xxx 
■
Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of WANs”—TCP/IP and OSI both have several protocols and 
functions performed at the data link layer. This chapter covers the concepts and terms 
used for the most popular options for the data link layer for wide-area networks 
(WANs), including High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), the Point-to-Point Protocol 
(PPP), and Frame Relay.
■
Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of IP”—The Internet Protocol (IP) is the main network layer 
protocol for TCP/IP. This chapter introduces the basics of IP, including IP addressing.
■
Chapter 6, “Fundamentals of TCP and UDP”—The Transmission Control Protocol 
(TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are the main transport layer protocols for 
TCP/IP. This chapter introduces the basics of TCP and UDP. 
Part II: Operating Cisco Devices
■
Chapter 7, “Operating Cisco Routers”—The basic navigation around the user interface 
of a Cisco router is covered here. Also, some of the more common administrative tasks—
upgrading the router’s software, deleting conﬁgurations, adding conﬁgurations, and so 
on—are covered here. 
■
Chapter 8, “Operating Cisco LAN Switches”—Chapter 8 is like Chapter 7, except that 
it covers details for the Cisco 2950 series of LAN switches. Given the many similarities 
with routers, the chapter points out the similarities brieﬂy and then explains the 
differences more fully. 
Part III: LAN Switching
■
Chapter 9, “Cisco LAN Switching Basics”—This chapter focuses on the internal 
operation of a LAN switch, as well as conﬁguration of LAN switches.
■
Chapter 10, “Virtual LANs and Trunking”—Most campus networks of any size use 
virtual LANs, and if more than one VLAN is used, those same networks also use VLAN 
trunking. This chapter explains the concepts.
■
Chapter 11, “LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies”—The ﬁnal LAN-speciﬁc 
chapter in this book details LAN standards, including the cabling media, for Ethernet. 
Many of the details in this chapter are not very glamorous, but they are important.
Part IV: TCP/IP
■
Chapter 12, “IP Addressing and Subnetting”—This chapter gets into the depths of IP 
addressing and subnetting. The Boolean math operations required for analyzing IP 
addresses are explained, and several examples are used to detail how IP subnets are 
created, what IP addresses are in the same subnet, and the math required to answer exam 
questions about subnetting.

 xxxi
■
Chapter 13, “Basic Router Conﬁguration and Operation”—The most common 
commands for conﬁguring IP and examining the status of IP routing in a router are 
outlined in this chapter.
■
Chapter 14, “Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols”—Routing Protocols 
dynamically learn and advertise the routes in a network. This chapter introduces the 
TCP/IP routing protocols.
Part V: Wide-Area Networking
■
Chapter 15, “Remote Access Technologies”—Many options exist today for accessing 
the Internet. This chapter introduces the basics of four of these—analog dial using 
modems, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), 
and cable modems.
Part VI: Final Preparation
■
Chapter 16, “Final Preparation”—This chapter covers a variety of suggestions for taking 
the exam, and it provides a scenario that helps you review some of the material in the 
book.
Part VII: Appendixes
■
Appendix A,  “Answers to the “Do I Know This Already” Quizes and Q&A Sections”—
Includes the answers to all the questions from chapters 1 through 15.
■
Appendix B, “Binary to Decimal Conversion Table”—Lists decimal values 0 through 255, 
along with the binary equivalents.
■
Appendix C, “Using the Simulation Software for the Hands-on Exercises”—Provides 
instructions for accessing the NetSim network simulator that comes with the book. This 
appendix also lists the labs and scenarios from this book that can be performed using 
NetSim.
When you are ﬁnished with the core chapters, you have several options on how to ﬁnish your 
exam preparation. Additional exercises in Chapter 16 provide a method of ﬁnal preparation 
with more questions and exercises. You can review the questions at the end of each chapter, 
and you can use the CD’s testing software to practice the exam.
How to Use This Book to Prepare for the INTRO Exam
To study for the INTRO exam, you can simply use this book and start reading. The study 
plan is simple. However, if you have some experience or knowledge of Cisco products and 
networking protocols already, you might be able to save a little study time while taking only 
small risks. Figure I-1 shows the progression you should take through the books as you 
prepare for the INTRO exam.

Figure I-1
How to Approach Each Chapter of This Book
In each chapter, an assessment quiz, called the “Do I Know This Already? Quiz,” helps you 
decide whether you already know a lot of the material in the chapter. The DIKTA quiz does 
not quiz you on every topic in the chapter, but it does focus on a representative sample from 
each chapter. If you do well on the DIKTA quiz, it is an indication of how much you already 
know about the topic.
Based on your DIKTA score and your conﬁdence level, you can choose to either skip the 
“Foundation Topics” section of the chapter or not. Regardless, everyone should at least read 
the “Foundation Summary” section and answer all the questions at the end of the chapter. If you 
get a good score on DIKTA and then miss a lot of the open-ended questions at the end of the 
chapter, you might still consider reading the “Foundations Topics” section of that chapter. 
When you have completed Chapters 1–15, you can move on to your ﬁnal preparation. 
Several activities can help you make your ﬁnal preparations:
■
Read Chapter 16. It contains some exam-taking tips and some exercises that help to 
reinforce materials from all parts of the book.
■
Answer the chapter-ending questions again. These questions are generally harder than 
those on the CD because they are all open-ended questions.
■
Review the “Foundation Summary” sections of each chapter.
■
Prepare for hands-on questions on the exam. You should deﬁnitely perform all simluated 
questions using the exam engine on the CD. Also, you may want to either read or 
perform the scenario in chapter 16, the scenarios in CD-only appendix B, and the labs 
in CD-only appendix C. Appendix C in this book (not the CD-only appendix C), titled, 
“Using the Simulation Software for Hands-on Exercises”, both summarizes all the 
hands-on exercises included with the book that can be performed on the simulator.

■
Practice subnetting. If needed, use the subnetting appendix on the CD. You get 25 more 
full subnetting questions with answers worked out, most using difﬁcult subnet masks.
■
Using the exam engine on the CD, select Questions from the Book instead of Questions 
Only on the CD. By doing so, you will just be quizzed from the CD, but with questions 
that appeared in the DIKTA quizes in the chapters. Use practice mode, and drill on these 
questions until it is automatic.
■
Finally, using the CD, deselect Book Questions, and select New Questions. Then use 
exam mode and take a couple of simulated exams. This should be the ﬁnal step in 
preparation.
For any questions that you miss, make sure you read the relavent sections of the book for a 
refresher.
By this point, you should be well prepared for the INTRO exam.
How to Use These Books to Prepare for the CCNA Exam
If you are using this book to study for the INTRO exam, just follow the plan outlined in the 
last few pages. However, to use this book to study for the CCNA exam, you really should 
use both this book and the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. (By the way, if you’ve 
not bought this book yet and you want both, you can generally get the pair cheaper by 
buying a set, called the CCNA Certiﬁcation Library.) These two books were designed to be 
used together to help those who want to get their CCNA certiﬁcation by taking a single 
exam. 
Notice that the names of four of the six parts in the CCNA INTRO Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide match the names of all ﬁve parts in the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. 
Essentially, when you complete a section of the ﬁrst book, if there is a like-named section of 
the second book, you move over and read that section. After ﬁnishing that section in the 
CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, you move back to the CCNA INTRO Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. Figure I-2 outlines the process.

xxxiv 
Figure I-2
Reading Plan When Studying for CCNA Exam
Moving back and forth between books will help you to focus on one general topic at a time. 
Each time you transition to the ICND book, you will read about a lot of additional material 
about the general topic, plus a few things that seem like review. (Those review items are 
included for the readers who are using the ICND book for their ICND exam preparation.) 
As a result, you will complete the coverage of each major topic before moving on to the next.
There is one point in this reading plan for the CCNA exam for which you should consider a 
couple of options. Cisco includes one major topic, IP addressing and subnetting, on both the 
INTRO and ICND exams. So, that topic is covered in both books for those readers who are 
studying for the INTRO and ICND exams. Chapter 12 in the CCNA INTRO Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide covers subnetting, and Chapter 4 in the CCNA ICND Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide does so as well. If you are studying for the CCNA exam, you should keep 
in mind that the “Foundation Topics” of the ICND book’s Chapter 4—the core part of the 
chapter—is a subset of the INTRO book’s Chapter 12. So, there’s no need to read it twice! 
When reading the books, you should take a few minutes to look at the ICND book’s Chapter 4, 
however. There are some new questions in the DIKTA quiz and some new questions at the 
end of the chapter, which are different from the INTRO book’s Chapter 12. You might also 
make some adjustments in the order that you read the chapters. Figure I-3 outlines two 
suggested options for your IP subnetting study with these two books’

Study Plan Options for Studying IP Addressing When Studying for the CCNA Exam
By taking the ﬁrst of the two options in the ﬁgure, you can review IP subnetting after you 
have ﬁnished all the TCP/IP topics from the ﬁrst book. If you follow the second option, you 
can inundate yourself with IP addressing all at once, then ﬁnish all the TCP/IP speciﬁc 
coverage in the ﬁrst book, and then move back to the second book for the rest of the 
TCP/IP coverage. Either plan can work well; it’s just a matter of personal preference.

The CCNA certiﬁcation is arguably the most important Cisco certiﬁcation. It certainly is the 
most popular, is required for several other certiﬁcations, and is the ﬁrst step in distinguishing 
yourself as someone who has proven knowledge of Cisco.
The CCNA INTRO Exam Certiﬁcation Guide is designed to help you attain CCNA 
certiﬁcation. This is the CCNA INTRO certiﬁcation book from the only Cisco-authorized 
publisher. We at Cisco Press believe that this book certainly can help you achieve CCNA 
certiﬁcation—but the real work is up to you! I trust that your time will be well spent.

Introduction to Computer 
Networking Concepts
This chapter gives you a light-hearted perspective about networks, how they were 
originally created, and why networks work the way they do. Although no speciﬁc fact 
from this chapter happens to be on either of the CCNA exams, this chapter helps you 
prepare for the depth of topics you will start to read about in Chapter 2, “The TCP/IP 
and OSI Networking Models.” If you are brand new to networking, this short 
introductory chapter will help you get ready for the details to follow. If you already 
understand the basics of TCP/IP, Ethernet, switches, routers, IP addressing, and the like, 
go ahead and skip on to Chapter 2. The rest of you will probably want to read through 
this short introductory chapter before diving into the details. 
Perspectives on Networking
So, you are new to networking. You might have seen or heard about different topics 
relating to networking, but you are only just now getting serious about learning the 
details. Like many people, your perspective about networks might be that of a user of the 
network, as opposed to the network engineer who builds networks. For some, that 
perspective is as a dialup user of the Internet. Others might use a computer at a job or at 
school; that computer is typically connected to a network via some cable. Figure 1-1 
shows the basic end-user perspective of networking.
Figure 1-1
End-User Perspective on Networks
The top part of the ﬁgure shows a typical dialup user of the Internet. The user has a PC, 
and the user plugs in the phone line from the wall into a modem in a PC. By dialing the

right phone number, the user connects to the Internet. After connecting, the user can send 
e-mail, browse web sites, and use other tools and applications as well. 
Similarly, an employee of a company or a student at a university views the world as a 
connection through a wall plug. Typically, this connection uses a type of local-area network 
(LAN) called Ethernet. Instead of a phone cord between a PC modem and the wall plug at 
your house, you have an Ethernet cable between a PC Ethernet card and a wall plug near 
where you are sitting at work or at school. The Ethernet connection does not require the PC 
to “dial” a phone number—it’s always there waiting to be used, similar to the power outlet.
From the end-user perspective, whether at home, at work, or at school, what happens behind 
the wall plug is magic. Just as most people do not really understand how cars work, how TVs 
work, and so on, most people who use networks do not understand how they work. Nor do 
they want to! But if you have read this much into Chapter 1, you obviously have a little more 
interest in networking than an end user. By the end of this book, you will have a pretty 
thorough understanding of what’s behind that wall plug. 
The concepts, protocols, and devices covered on the CCNA exam are used to help build the 
network cloud shown in Figure 1-1. However, the CCNA exam focuses on technology that 
is used to build a network at a single company or school. These same technologies are used 
to build the Internet, but the CCNA exam topics focus on things that matter most to what 
Cisco calls “enterprise” networks—networks owned by a single enterprise or company. Figure 1-
2 shows an alternative view of the world of networking, with several enterprise networks.
Figure 1-2
Enterprise Networks and the Internet
When you go to your school or your job and connect to “the network,” you are most likely 
connecting to the private network, or enterprise network, for that school or company. That 
network, in turn, is connected to the Internet. Conversely, if you dial into some Internet

service provider (ISP) from home, you are not connected to an Enterprise network, but you 
are connected directly to the Internet. However, if you then use a web browser to browse 
some web site, the web site itself might be inside that company’s enterprise network. 
In either case, practically every company or school that uses computers also has an enterprise 
network. To communicate, many enterprise networks connect to the Internet. The Internet 
itself is really a collection of ISPs that, in turn, connect to each other. By having the various 
enterprise networks connect to the Internet, most computer users around the world can use 
applications to communicate with each other—worldwide.
The CCNA exams focus on the technology used to build enterprise networks, with some 
coverage of technology more often used in the Internet. However, a lot of the protocols and 
concepts used in an enterprise network also happen inside the Internet. Because CCNA 
topics encompass the typical features found in enterprise networks, and because a much 
larger number of people work on enterprise networks than ISP networks, most of the 
examples in this book focus on enterprise networks.
Most of the details about standards for enterprise networks were created in the last quarter 
of the 20th century. You might have gotten interested in networking after most of the 
conventions and rules used for basic networking were created—if so, you missed out on the 
opportunity to help create the standards. However, taking the time to pause and think about 
what you would do if you were creating these standards can be helpful. The next section 
takes you through a somewhat silly example, but with real value in terms of thinking through 
some of the basic concepts behind enterprise networking and some of the design trade-offs.
The Flintstones Network: The First Computer Network?
The Flintstones are a cartoon family that, according to the cartoon, lived in prehistoric times. 
Because I want to discuss the thought process behind some imaginary initial networking 
standards, the Flintstones seem to be the right group of people to put in the example.
Fred is the president of FredCo, where his wife (Wilma), buddy (Barney), and buddy’s wife 
(Betty) all work. They all have phones and computers, but they have no network because no 
one has ever made up the idea of a network before. Fred sees all his employees running 
around giving each other disks with ﬁles on them, and it seems inefﬁcient. So, Fred, being a 
visionary, imagines a world in which people can connect their computers somehow and 
exchange ﬁles, without having to leave their desks. The (imaginary) ﬁrst network is about to 
be born.
Fred’s daughter, Pebbles, has just graduated from Rockville University and wants to join the 
family business. Fred gives her a job, with the title First-Ever Network Engineer. Fred says to 
Pebbles, “Pebbles, I want everyone to be able to exchange ﬁles without having to get up from 

8     Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networking Concepts
their desks. I want them to be able to simply type in the name of a ﬁle and the name of the 
person, and poof! The ﬁle appears on the other person’s computer. And because everyone 
changes departments so often around here, I want the workers to be able to take their PCs 
with them and just have to plug the computer into a wall socket so that they can send and 
receive ﬁles from the new ofﬁce they moved to. I want this network thing to be like the 
electrical power thing your boyfriend, Bam Bam, created for us last year—a plug in the wall 
near every desk, and if you plug in, you’re on the network!”
Pebbles ﬁrst decides to do some research and development. If she can get two PCs to transfer 
ﬁles in a lab, then she ought to be able to get all the PCs to transfer ﬁles, right? She writes a 
program called Fred’s Transfer Program, or FTP, in honor of her father.
The program uses a new networking card that Pebbles built in the lab. This networking card 
uses a cable with two wires in it—one wire to send bits and one to receive bits. Pebbles puts 
one card in each of the two computers and cables the computers together with a cable with 
two wires in it. The FTP software on each computer sent the bits that comprised the ﬁles 
using the networking cards. If Pebbles types a command like ftp send ﬁlename, the software 
transfers the ﬁle called ﬁlename to the computer at the other end of the cable. Figure 1-3 
depicts the ﬁrst network test at FredCo.
Figure 1-3
Two PCs Transfer Files in the Lab
Note that because each networking card uses wire 1 to send bits and wire 2 to receive bits, 
the cable used by Pebbles connects wire 1 on PC1 to wire 2 on PC2, and vice versa. That way, 
both cards can send using wire 1, and it will enter the other PC on the other PC’s wire 2.  
Bam Bam happens by to give Pebbles some help after hearing about the successful test. “I’m 
ready to start deploying the network!” she claims. Bam Bam, the wizened one-year veteran 
of FredCo who graduated from Rockville U. a year before Pebbles, starts asking some 
questions. “What happens when you want to connect three computers together?” he asks. 
Pebbles explains that she can put two networking cards in each computer and cable each 
computer to each other. “So what happens when you connect 100 computers to the 
network—in each building?” Hmmm…. Pebbles then realizes that she has a little more work 
to do. She needs a scheme that allows her network to scale to more than two users. Bam Bam 
goes on, “We ran all the electrical power cables from the wall plug at each cube back to the 
broom closet. We just send electricity from the closet out to the wall plug near every desk. 
Maybe if you did something similar, you can ﬁnd a way to somehow make it all work.”

Perspectives on Networking     9
With that bit of input, Pebbles has all the inspiration she needs. Emboldened by the fact that 
she had already created the world’s ﬁrst PC networking card, she decides to create a device 
that will allow cabling similar to Bam Bam’s electrical cabling plan. Pebble’s solution to this 
ﬁrst major hurdle is shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4
Star Cabling to a Repeater
Pebbles follows Bam Bam’s advice about the cabling. However, she needs a device into which 
she can plug the cables—something that will take the bits sent by a PC, and reﬂect, or repeat, 
the bits back to all the other devices connected to this new device. Because the networking 
cards send bits using wire 1, Pebbles builds this new device so that when it receives bits 
coming in wire 1 on one of its ports, it will repeat the same bits—but out wire 2 on all the 
other ports, so the other PCs get those bits on the receive wire. (Therefore, the cabling does 
not have to swap wires 1 and 2—this new device takes care of that.) And because she is 
making this up for the very ﬁrst time in history, she needs to decide on a name for this new 
device: She names the device a hub. 
Before deploying the ﬁrst hub and running a bunch of cables, Pebbles does the right thing: 
She tests it in a lab, with three PCs connected to the world’s ﬁrst hub. She starts FTP on PC1, 
transfers the ﬁle called recipe.doc, and sees a window pop up on PC2 saying that the ﬁle was 
received, just like normal. “Fantastic!” she thinks—until she realizes that PC3 also has the 
same pop-up window on it. She has transferred the ﬁle to both PC2 and PC3! “Of course!” 
she thinks. “If the hub repeats everything out every cable connected to it, then when FTP 
sends a ﬁle, everyone will get it. I need a way for FTP to send a ﬁle to a speciﬁc PC!”
At this point, Pebbles thinks of a few different options. First, she thinks that she will give each 
computer the same name as the ﬁrst name of the person using the computer. She will then change 
FTP to put the name of the PC that the ﬁle was being sent to in front of the ﬁle contents. In other 
words, to send her mom a recipe, she will use the ftp Wilma recipe.doc command. So, each PC 
will receive the bits because the hub repeats the signal to everyone connected to it, but only the 
PC whose name is the one in front of the ﬁle should actually create the ﬁle. Then her Dad walks 
in: “Pebbles, I want you to meet Barney Fife, our new head of security. He’ll need a network 
connection as well—you are going to be ﬁnished soon, right?”

10     Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networking Concepts
So much for using ﬁrst names for the computers: There are now two people named Barney 
at FredCo. Pebbles, being mathematically inclined and in charge of creating all the hardware, 
decides on a different approach. “I’ll put a unique address on each networking card—a 4-
digit decimal number,” she exclaims. Because Pebbles created all the cards, she will make sure 
that the number used on each card is unique. Also, with a 4-digit number, she will never run 
out of unique numbers—she has 10,000 (104) to choose from and only 200 employees at 
FredCo. 
By the way, because she’s making all this up for the very ﬁrst time, she calls these built-in 
numbers on the cards addresses. When anyone wants to send a ﬁle, they can just use the ftp 
command, but with a number instead of a name. For instance, ftp 0002 recipe.doc will send 
the recipe.doc ﬁle to the PC whose network card has the address 0002. Figure 1-5 depicts the 
new environment in the lab. 
Figure 1-5
The First Network Addressing Convention
Now, with some minor updates to the Fred Transfer Program, the user can type ftp 0002 
recipe.doc to send the ﬁle recipe.doc to the PC with address 0002. Pebbles tests the software 
and hardware in the lab again, and only PC2 receives the ﬁle when it is sent to PC2. When 
she sends the ﬁle to 0003, only PC3 receives the ﬁle. She’s now ready to deploy the ﬁrst 
computer network.
Pebbles now needs to build all the hardware needed. She ﬁrst creates 200 network cards, each 
with a unique address. She installs the FTP program on all 200 PCs and installs the cards in 
each PC. Then she goes back to the lab and starts planning how many cables she will need 
and how long each cable should be. Then she realizes that she will need to run some cables 
a long way. Even if she puts the hub in the bottom ﬂoor of building A, the PCs on the ﬁfth 
ﬂoor of building B will need a really long cable to connect to the hub. Cables cost money, 
and the longer the cable is, the more expensive the cable is. Besides, she has not yet tested the 
network with longer cables; she has been using cables that are only a couple of meters long.

Perspectives on Networking     11
Bam Bam happens by and sees that Pebbles is stressed. Pebbles vents a little: “Daddy wants 
this project ﬁnished, and you know how demanding he is. And I didn’t think about how long 
the cables will be—I’ll be way over budget. And I’ll be running cables for weeks!” Bam Bam, 
being a little less stressed, having just come from a workout during lunch break at the club, 
knows that Pebbles already has the solution—she was too stressed to see it. Of course, the 
solution is not terribly different from how Bam Bam solved a similar problem with the 
electrical cabling last year. “Those hubs repeat everything they hear, right? So, why not make 
a bunch of hubs. Put one hub on each ﬂoor, and run cables from all the PCs. Then run a cable 
from the hub on each ﬂoor to a hub on the ﬁrst ﬂoor Then, run one cable between the two 
main hubs in the two buildings. Because they repeat everything, every PC should receive the 
signal when just one PC sends, whether they are attached to the same hub or are four hubs 
away.” Figure 1-6 depicts Bam Bam’s suggested design.
Figure 1-6
Per-Floor Hubs, Connected Together
Pebbles loves the idea. She builds and connects the new hubs in the lab, just to prove the 
concept. It works! She makes the (now shorter) cables, installs the hubs and cables, and is 
ready to test. She goes to a few representative PCs and tests, and it all works! The ﬁrst 
network has now been deployed.
Wanting to surprise Poppa Fred, Pebbles writes a memo to everyone in the company, telling 
them how to use the soon-to-be-famous Fred Transfer Program to transfer ﬁles. Along with 
the memo, she puts a list of names of people and the four-digit network address to be used 
to send ﬁles to each PC. She puts the memos in everyone’s mail slot and waits for the 
excitement to start. 

12     Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networking Concepts
Amazingly, it all works. The users are happy. Fred treats Pebbles and Bam Bam to a nice 
dinner—at home, cooked by Wilma, but a good meal nonetheless.
Pebbles thinks she did it—created the world’s ﬁrst computer network, with no problems—
until a few weeks pass. “I can’t send ﬁles to Fred anymore!” exclaims Barney Rubble. “Ever 
since Fred got that new computer, he’s too busy to go bowling, and now I can’t even send 
him ﬁles telling him how much we need him back on the bowling team!” Then it hits 
Pebbles—Fred had just gotten a new PC and a new networking card. Fred’s network address 
had changed. Or what happens if the card fails and it has to be replaced? The address 
changes.
About that time, Wilma comes in to say hi. “I love that new network thing you built. Betty 
and I can type each other notes, put them in a ﬁle, and send them anytime. It’s almost like 
working on the same ﬂoor!” she says. “But I really don’t remember the numbers so well. 
Couldn’t you make that FTP thing work with names instead of addresses?”
In a ﬁt of inspiration, Pebbles sees the answer to the ﬁrst problem in the solution to her mom’s 
problem. “I’ll change FTP to use names instead of addresses. I’ll make everyone tell me what 
name they want to use—maybe Barney Rubble will use BarneyR, and Barney Fife will use 
BarneyF, for instance. I’ll change FTP to accept names as well as numbers. Then I’ll tell FTP 
to look in a table that I will put on each PC that correlates the names to the numeric 
addresses. That way, if I ever need to replace a LAN card, all I have to do is update the list 
of names and addresses and put a copy on everyone’s PC, and no one will know that anything 
has changed!” Table 1-2 lists Pebbles ﬁrst name table.
Pebbles tries out the new FTP program and name/address table in the lab, and it works. She 
deploys the new FTP software, puts the name table on everyone’s PC, sends another memo—
and now she can accommodate changes easily by separating the physical details, such as 
addresses on the networking cards, from what the end users need to know.

Perspectives on Networking     13
Like all good network engineers, Pebbles thought through the design and tested in a lab 
before deploying the network. For the problems she did not anticipate, she found a 
reasonable solution to get around the problem. 
So ends the obviously contrived imaginary ﬁrst computer network. What purpose did this 
silly example really serve? First, you have now been forced to think about some basic design 
issues that confronted the people who created the networking tools that you will be learning 
about for the CCNA exams. Although the example with Pebbles might have been fun, the 
problems that she faced are the same problems faced—and solved—by the people who 
created the original networking protocols and products. 
The other big beneﬁt to this story, particularly for those of you brand new to networking, is 
that you already know some of the more important concepts in networking:
Ethernet networks use cards inside each computer. 
The cards have unique addresses, similar to Pebble’s networking cards. 
Ethernet cables connect PCs to Ethernet hubs—hubs that repeat each received
signal out all other ports.
The cabling is typically run in a star conﬁguration—in other words, all cables run
from a cubicle to a wiring (not broom!) closet.
Applications such as the contrived Fred Transfer Program or the real-life File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP) ask the underlying hardware to transfer the contents of 
ﬁles. Users can use names—for instance, you might surf a web site called 
www.myfavoritewebsite.org—but the name gets translated into the correct address.
Now on to the real chapters, with real protocols and devices, with topics that you could see 
on the CCNA INTRO exam.

This chapter covers the 
following subjects:
■The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture
■OSI Reference Model

C H A P T E R 2
The TCP/IP and 
OSI Networking Models
The term networking model, or networking architecture, refers to an organized 
description of all the functions needed for useful communications to occur. Individual 
protocols and hardware speciﬁcations then are used to implement the functions described 
in the networking model. When multiple computers and other networking devices 
implement these protocols, which, in turn, implement the functions described by the 
networking model, the computers can successfully communicate. 
You can think of a networking model like you think of a set of architectural plans for 
building a house. Sure, you can build a house without the architectural plans, but it will 
work better if you follow the plans. And because you probably have a lot of different 
people working on building your house, such as framers, electricians, bricklayers, 
painters, and so on, it helps if they can all reference the same plan. Similarly, you could 
build your own network, write your own software, build your own networking cards, 
and create a network without using any existing networking model. However, it is much 
easier to simply buy and use products that already conform to some well-known 
networking model. And because the products from different vendors conform to the 
same networking architectural model, the products should work well together.
The CCNA exams include detailed coverage of one networking model—the 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP. TCP/IP is the most 
pervasive networking model in the history of data networking. You can ﬁnd support for 
TCP/IP on practically every computer operating system in existence today, from mobile 
phones to mainframe computers. Almost every network built using Cisco products today 
supports TCP/IP. Not surprisingly, the CCNA exams focus on TCP/IP.
The INTRO exam, and the ICND exam to a small extent, also covers a second 
networking model, called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Historically, 
OSI was the ﬁrst large effort to create a vendor-neutral networking model that could be 
added to any and every computer in the world. Ironically, OSI might be the least-
pervasive networking model deployed today. However, because OSI was the ﬁrst major 
effort to create a vendor-neutral networking architectural model, many of the terms used 
in networking today come from the OSI model.

20     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
Foundation Topics
It is practically impossible to ﬁnd a computer today that does not support the set of 
networking protocols called TCP/IP. Every Microsoft, Linux, and UNIX operating system 
includes support for TCP/IP. Hand-held digital assistants and cell phones support TCP/IP. 
Even IBM Mainframe operating systems support TCP/IP. And because Cisco sells products 
that create the infrastructure that allows all these computers to talk with each other using 
TCP/IP, Cisco products also include extensive support for TCP/IP.
The world has not always been so simple. Once upon a time, there were no networking 
protocols, including TCP/IP. Vendors created the ﬁrst networking protocols; these protocols 
supported only that vendor’s computers, and the details were not even published to the 
public. As time went on, vendors formalized and published their networking protocols, 
enabling other vendors to create products that could communicate with their computers. For 
instance, IBM published its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking model in 
1974. After SNA was published, you could buy computers from other vendors as well as 
IBM, and they could communicate—as long as they supported IBM’s proprietary SNA.
Using only vendor-proprietary networking models allowed a business to successfully 
communicate between computers from multiple vendors. However, to talk to a computer 
using the hardware or software from vendor X, you needed to use the networking protocols 
created by vendor X. Imagine sitting at your desk in the late 1980s and needing to work with an 
IBM mainframe using SNA, a DEC minicomputer using DECnet, and a Novell server using 
NetWare, and having to transfer ﬁles with an Apple computer using AppleTalk. Believe it or not, 
it actually worked, and networks using all these different protocols were not at all uncommon. 
A better solution was to create a standardized networking model that all vendors would 
support. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) took on this task starting 
as early as the late 1970s, beginning work on what would become known as the Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking model. The ISO had a noble goal for the OSI: to 
standardize data networking protocols to allow communication between all computers across 
the entire planet. The OSI worked toward this ambitious and noble goal, with participants from 
most of the technologically developed nations on Earth participating in the process.
A second, less formal effort to create a standardized, public networking model sprouted forth 
from a U.S. Defense Department contract. Researchers at various universities volunteered to 
help further develop the protocols surrounding the original department’s work. These efforts 
resulting in a competing networking model called TCP/IP. 

The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture     21
The world now had many competing vendor networking models and two competing 
standardized networking models. So what happened? TCP/IP won the war. Proprietary 
protocols are still in use today in many networks, but much less so than in the 1980s and 
1990s. OSI, whose development suffered in part because of the slow formal standardization 
processes of the ISO, never succeeded in the marketplace. And TCP/IP, the networking model 
created almost entirely by a bunch of volunteers, has become the most proliﬁc set of data 
networking protocols ever.
In this chapter, you will read about some of the basics of TCP/IP. Although you will learn 
some interesting facts about TCP/IP, the true goal of this chapter is to help you understand 
what a networking model or networking architecture really is and how one works.
Also in this chapter, you will learn about some of the jargon used with OSI. Will any of you 
ever work on a computer that is using the full OSI protocols instead of TCP/IP? Probably not. 
However, you will often use terms relating to OSI. Also, the INTRO exam covers the basics of 
OSI, so this chapter also covers OSI to prepare you for questions about it on the exam.
The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture
TCP/IP deﬁnes a large collection of protocols that allow computers to communicate. TCP/IP 
deﬁnes the details of each of these protocols inside document called Requests For Comments 
(RFCs). By implementing the required protocols deﬁned in TCP/IP RFCs, a computer can be 
relatively conﬁdent that it can communicate with other computers that also implement TCP/IP.
An easy comparison can be made between telephones and computers that use TCP/IP. I can 
go to the store and buy a phone from one of a dozen different vendors. When I get home, I 
plug the phone in to the wall socket, and it works. The phone vendors know the standards 
for phones in their country and build their phones to match those standards. Similarly, a 
computer that implements the standard networking protocols deﬁned by TCP/IP can 
communicate with other computers that also use the TCP/IP standards.
Like other networking architectures, TCP/IP classiﬁes the various protocols into different 
categories. Table 2-2 outlines the main categories in the TCP/IP architectural model.

22     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
The TCP/IP model represented in column 1 of the table lists the four layers of TCP/IP, and 
column 2 of the table lists several of the most popular TCP/IP protocols. If someone makes 
up a new application, the protocols used directly by the application would be considered to 
be application layer protocols. When the World Wide Web (WWW) was ﬁrst created, a new 
application layer protocol was created for the purpose of asking for web pages and receiving 
the contents of the web pages. Similarly, the network interface layer includes protocols and 
standards such as Ethernet. If someone makes up a new type of LAN, those protocols would 
be considered to be a part of the networking interface layer. In the next several sections, you 
will learn the basics about each of these four layers in the TCP/IP architecture and how they 
work together.
TCP/IP application layer protocols provide services to the application software running on a 
computer. The application layer does not deﬁne the application itself, but rather it deﬁnes 
services that applications need - like the ability to transfer a ﬁle in the case of HTTP. In short, 
the application layer provides an interface between software running on a computer and the 
network itself.
The TCP/IP Application Layer
Arguably, the most popular TCP/IP application today is the web browser. Many major 
software vendors either have already changed or are changing their software to support 
access from a web browser. And thankfully, using a web browser is easy—you start a web 
browser on your computer and select a web site by typing in the name of the web site, and 
the web page appears. 
What really happens to allow that web page to appear on your web browser? These next few 
sections take a high-level look at what happens behind the scene. 
Imagine that Bob opens his browser. His browser has been conﬁgured to automatically ask 
for web server Larry’s default web page, or home page. The general logic looks like that in 
Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1
Basic Application Logic to Get a Web Page
Bob
Larry

Server
Web Browser
TCP/IP Network
Give Me Your Home Page
Here Is File home.htm

The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture     23
So what really happened? Bob’s initial request actually asks Larry to send his home page back 
to Bob. Larry’s web server software has been conﬁgured to know that Larry’s default web 
page is contained in a ﬁle called home.htm. Bob receives the ﬁle from Larry and displays the 
contents of the ﬁle in the web browser window.
Taking a closer look, this example uses two TCP/IP application layer protocols. First, the 
request for the ﬁle and the actual transfer of the ﬁle are performed according to the Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Many of you have probably noticed that most web sites’ URLs 
(Universal Resource Locators, the text that identiﬁes a web server and a particular web page) 
begin with the letters “http,” to imply that HTTP will be used to transfer the web pages.
The other protocol used is the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML deﬁnes how 
Bob’s web browser should interpret the text inside the ﬁle he just received. For instance, the 
ﬁle might contain directions about making certain text be a certain size, color, and so on. In 
most cases, it also includes directions about other ﬁles that Bob’s web browser should get—
things such as graphics images and animation. HTTP would then be used to get those 
additional ﬁles from Larry, the web server.
A closer look at how Bob and Larry cooperate in this example reveals some details about 
how networking protocols work. Consider Figure 2-2, which simply revises Figure 2-1, 
showing the locations of HTTP headers and data.
Figure 2-2
HTTP Get Request and HTTP Reply
To get the web page from Larry, Bob sends something called an HTTP header to Larry. This 
header includes the command to “get” a ﬁle. The request typically contains the name of the 
ﬁle (home.htm in this case), or, if no ﬁlename is mentioned, the web server assumes that Bob 
wants the default web page. 
The response from Larry includes an HTTP header as well, with something as simple as 
“OK” returned in the header. In reality, it includes an HTTP return code. For instance, if you 
have ever used the web, and a web page that you looked for was not found, then you received an 
HTTP 404 “not found” error, which means that you received an HTTP return code of 404. 
When the requested ﬁle is found, the return code is 0, meaning that the request is being processed.

24     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
This simple example between Bob and Larry introduces one of the most important general 
concepts behind networking models: When a particular layer wants to communicate with the 
same layer on another computer, the two computers use headers to hold the information that 
they want to communicate. The headers are part of what is transmitted between the two 
computers. This process is called same-layer interaction.
The application layer protocol (HTTP, in this case) on Bob is communicating with Larry’s 
application layer. They each do so by creating and sending application layer headers to each 
other—sometimes with application data following the header and sometimes not, as seen in 
Figure 2-2. Regardless of what the application layer protocol happens to be, they all use the 
same general concept of communicating with the same layer on the other computer using 
application layer headers. 
TCP/IP application layer protocols provide services to the application software running on a 
computer. The application layer does not deﬁne the application itself, but rather it deﬁnes 
services that applications need—like the ability to transfer a ﬁle in the case of HTTP. In short, 
the application layer provides an interface between software running on a computer and the 
network itself.
The TCP/IP Transport Layer
The TCP/IP application layer includes a relatively large number of protocols, with HTTP 
being only one of those. The TCP/IP transport layer consists of two main protocol options—
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). To get a 
true appreciation for what TCP/IP transport layer protocols do, read Chapter 6, 
“Fundamentals of TCP and UDP.” However, in this section, you will learn about one of the 
key features of TCP, which enables us to cover some more general concepts about how 
networking models behave.
To appreciate what the transport layer protocols do, you must think about the layer above 
the transport layer, the application layer. Why? Well, each layer provides a service to the layer 
above it. For example, in Figure 2-2, Bob and Larry used HTTP to transfer the home page 
from Larry to Bob. But what would have happened if Bob’s HTTP get request was lost in 
transit through the TCP/IP network? Or, what would have happened if Larry’s response, 
which includes the contents of the home page, was lost? Well, the page would not show up 
in Bob’s browser, as you might expect.
So, TCP/IP needs a mechanism to guarantee delivery of data across a network. TCP provides 
that feature by using acknowledgments. Figure 2-3 outlines the basic acknowledgment logic.
As Figure 2-3 shows, the HTTP software asks for TCP to reliably deliver the HTTP get 
request. TCP sends the HTTP data from Bob to Larry, and the data arrives successfully. 
Larry’s TCP software acknowledges receipt of the data and also gives the HTTP get request 
to the web server software. The reverse happens with Larry’s response, which also arrives at 
Bob successfully. 

The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture     25
Figure 2-3
TCP Services Provided to HTTP
Of course, the beneﬁts of TCP error recovery cannot be seen unless the data is lost. Chapter 
6 covers TCP, including error recovery, in detail. For now,  assume that if either transmission 
had been lost, that HTTP would not be concerned, and that TCP would resend the data and 
ensure that it was received successfully.
This example outlines the concepts of how adjacent layers in a networking model work 
together on the same computer. The higher-layer protocol (HTTP) needs to do something it 
cannot do (error recovery). So, the higher layer asks for the next lower-layer protocol (TCP) 
to perform the service, and the next lower layer performs the service. The lower layer 
provides a service to the layer above it.
Table 2-3 summarizes the key points about how adjacent layers work together on a single 
computer and how one layer on one computer works with the same networking layer on 
another computer.
The TCP/IP transport layer provides services to the various application layer protocols. Error 
recovery, as performed by TCP, is one feature. This layer also provides other functions, as 
detailed in Chapter 6.

26     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
All the examples describing the application and transport layers ignored many details 
relating to the physical network. The application and transport layers purposefully were 
deﬁned to work the same, way whether the endpoint host computers were on the same LAN 
or were separated by the Internet. The lower two layers of TCP/IP, the internetwork layer 
and the network interface layer, must understand the underlying physical network because 
they deﬁne the protocols used to deliver the data from one host to another.
The TCP/IP Internetwork Layer
Imagine that you just wrote a letter to your favorite person on the other side of the country 
and that you also wrote a letter to someone on the other side of town. It’s time to send the 
letters. Is there much difference in how you treat each letter? Not really. You put different 
addresses on the envelope for each letter because the letters need to go to two different places. 
You put stamps on both letters and put them in the same mailbox. The postal service takes 
care of all the details of ﬁguring out how to get each letter to the right place—whether it is 
across town or across the country.
Inside the postal service, both letters are processed. One letter gets sent to another post ofﬁce, 
then another, and so on, until the letter gets delivered across the country. The local letter 
might go to the post ofﬁce in your town and then simply be delivered to your friend across 
town, without going to another post ofﬁce. 
So what does this all matter to networking? Well, the internetwork layer of the TCP/IP 
networking model, the Internet Protocol (IP), works much like the postal service. IP deﬁnes 
addresses so that each host computer can have a different IP address, just like the postal 
service deﬁnes addressing that allows unique addresses for each house, apartment, and 
business. Similarly, IP deﬁnes the process of routing so that devices called routers (ingenious 
name, huh?) can choose where to send packets of data so that they are delivered to the 
correct destination. Just like the postal service created the necessary post ofﬁces, sorting 
machines, trucks, and personnel to deliver the mail, the internetwork layer deﬁnes much of 
the details needed to implement the necessary networking infrastructure.
Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of IP,” describes the TCP/IP Internetwork layer further, with other 
details scattered throughout the book. But to help you understand the basics of the 
internetwork layer, take a look at Bob’s request for Larry’s home page, now with some 
information about IP, in Figure 2-4. 
First, some basic information about the ﬁgure will help. The LAN cabling details are not 
important for this example, so both LANs simply are represented by the lines shown near 
Bob and Larry, respectively. When Bob sends the data, he is sending an IP packet, which 
includes the IP header, the transport layer header (TCP, in this example), the application 
header (HTTP, in this case), and any application data (none, in this case). The IP header 
includes both a source and a destination IP address ﬁeld, with Larry’s IP address as the 
destination address and Bob’s as the source.

The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture     27
Figure 2-4
IP Services Provided to TCP
Bob sends the packet to R2, which makes a routing decision. R2 chooses to send the packet 
to R1 because the destination address of the packet is 1.1.1.1, and R1 knows enough about 
the network topology to know that 1.1.1.1 (Larry) is on the other side of R1. Similarly, when 
R1 gets the packet, it forwards the packet over the Ethernet to Larry. And if the link between 
R2 and R1 fails, IP allows R2 to learn of the alternate route through R3 to reach 1.1.1.1.
IP deﬁnes logical addresses, called IP addresses, that allow each TCP/IP speaking device 
(called IP hosts) to communicate. It also deﬁnes routing—the process of how a router should 
forward, or route, packets of data. Other protocol speciﬁcations, like OSI, have different 
protocols that also deﬁne addressing and routing.
Both CCNA exams cover IP fairly deeply. For the INTRO exam, this book’s Chapter 5 covers 
more of the basics, and Chapters 12, “IP Addressing and Subnetting,” through 14, 
“Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols,” cover many of the details.
The TCP/IP Network Interface Layer
The network interface layer deﬁnes the protocols and hardware required to deliver data 
across some physical network. The term network interface refers to the fact that this layer 
deﬁnes how to connect the host computer, which is not part of the network, to the network; 
it is the interface between the computer and the network. For instance, Ethernet is one 
example protocol at the TCP/IP network interface layer. Ethernet deﬁnes the required 
cabling, addressing, and protocols used to create an Ethernet LAN. Likewise, the connectors, 
cables, voltage levels, and protocols used to deliver data across WAN links are deﬁned in a 
variety of other protocols that also fall into the network interface layer.
Chapter 3, “Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs,” and Chapter 4, 
“Fundamentals of WANs,” cover more details about the TCP/IP network interface layer.
Just like every layer in any networking model, the TCP/IP network interface layer provides 
services to the layer above it in the model. The best way to understand the basics of the TCP/
IP network interface layer is to examine the services that it provides to IP.

28     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
IP relies on the network interface layer to deliver IP packets across each physical network. IP 
understands the overall network topology, things such as which routers are connected to each other, 
which host computers are connected to which networks, and what the IP addressing scheme looks 
like. However, the IP protocol purposefully does not include the details about each of the underlying 
physical networks. Therefore, the Internet layer, as implemented by IP, uses the services of the 
network interface layer to deliver the packets over each physical network, respectively.
The network interface layer includes a large number of protocols. For instance, the network 
interface layer includes all the variations of Ethernet protocols and other LAN standards. 
This layer also includes the popular WAN standards, such as the Point-to-Point Protocol 
(PPP) and Frame Relay. The same familiar network is shown in Figure 2-5, with Ethernet and 
PPP used as the two network interface layer protocols.

To fully appreciate Figure 2-5, ﬁrst think a little more deeply about how IP accomplishes its 
goal of delivering the packet from Bob to Larry. Bob wants to send the IP packet to Larry, 
but it must ﬁrst do so by sending the packet to R2. Bob uses Ethernet to get the packet to R2. 
At R2, R2 strips the Ethernet header and trailer from the IP packet. To get the IP packet from 
R2 to R1, R2 does not need to use Ethernet—it instead needs to use the PPP serial link. To 
send the IP packet from R2 to R1, R2 needs to place a PPP header in front of the IP packet 
and a PPP trailer at the end. Similarly, after the packet is received by R1, R1 removes the PPP 
header and trailer because PPP’s job is to get the IP packet across the serial link. R1 then decides 
that it should forward the packet over the Ethernet to Larry. To do so, R1 adds a brand-new 
Ethernet header and trailer to the packet and forwards it to Larry.
In effect, IP uses the network interface layer protocols to deliver the IP packet to the next router 
or host, with each router repeating the process until the packet arrives at the destination. Each 
network interface protocol uses headers to encode the information needed to successfully deliver 
the data across the physical network, much like other layers use headers to achieve their goals.
CAUTION
Many people describe the network interface layer of the TCP/IP model as two 
layers, the data link layer and the physical layer. The reasons for the popularity of these 
alternate terms are explained in the section covering OSI because the terms originated with 
the OSI model.

The TCP/IP Protocol Architecture     29
In short, the TCP/IP Network Interface layer includes the protocols, cabling standards, 
headers and trailers that deﬁne how to send data across a wide variety of types of physical 
networks.
Data Encapsulation
The term encapsulation describes the process of putting headers and trailers around some 
data. A computer that needs to send data encapsulates the data in headers of the correct 
format so that the receiving computer will know how to interpret the received data. 
You have seen several examples of encapsulation in this chapter already. The web server 
encapsulated the home page inside an HTTP header in Figure 2-2. The TCP layer 
encapsulated the HTTP headers and data inside a TCP header in Figure 2-3. IP encapsulated 
the TCP headers and the data inside an IP header in Figure 2-4. Finally, the network interface 
layer encapsulated the IP packets inside both a header and a trailer in Figure 2-5.
You can think about the complete process of data encapsulation with TCP/IP as a ﬁve-step 
process. In fact, previous CCNA exams referred to a speciﬁc ﬁve-step process for 
encapsulation. This included the typical encapsulation by the application, transport, 
network, and network interface (referred to as data link) layers as Steps 1 through 4 in the 
ﬁve-step process. The ﬁfth step was the physical layer’s transmission of the bit stream. In case 
any questions remain in the CCNA question database referring to a ﬁve-step encapsulation 
process, the following list provides the details and explanation. Regardless, the ideas behind 
the process apply to any networking model and how it encapsulates data:
Step 1
Create the application data and headers—This simply means that the 
application has data to send.
Step 2
Package the data for transport—In other words, the transport layer 
(TCP or UDP) creates the transport header and places the data behind it. 
Step 3
Add the destination and source network layer addresses to the data—
The network layer creates the network header, which includes the 
network layer addresses, and places the data behind it. 
Step 4
Add the destination and source data link layer addresses to the data—
The data link layer creates the data link header, places the data behind 
it, and places the data link trailer at the end. 
Step 5
Transmit the bits—The physical layer encodes a signal onto the medium 
to transmit the frame. 
This ﬁve-step process happens to match the TCP/IP network model very well. Figure 2-6 
depicts the concept; the numbers shown represent each of the ﬁve steps.

30     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
Figure 2-6
Five Steps of Data Encapsulation—TCP/IP
* The letters LH and LT stand for link header and link trailer, respectively, and refer to the data link layer header 
and trailer.
When each layer encapsulates data given to it from the next higher layer, that layer does not 
really care about the details of the data. Figure 2-7 shows the encapsulated data from the 
perspective of the transport, internetwork, and data link (network interface) layers. 
Figure 2-7
Perspectives on Encapsulation and “Data”
Each layer treats the data given to it by the next higher layer simply as “data.” For instance, 
IP just wants to transport what TCP gives it—IP does not really care what is inside the data. 
So, the IP packet shown in the ﬁgure  shows the rest of the bits as data, meaning that IP does 
not care that the data ﬁeld looks like the TCP segment above it in the ﬁgure.
Also notice the speciﬁc terms used for the framing as it exists at each layer, as shown in the 
ﬁgure. Throughout this book and on the CCNA exams, the term frame deﬁnes all the 
encapsulated data. The term packet includes the IP header but not any data link headers. 
Finally, the term segment includes the TCP or UDP header but not the IP header or data link 
header or trailer.

OSI Reference Model     31
OSI Reference Model
To pass the INTRO exam, you must be conversant in a protocol speciﬁcation with which you 
are very unlikely to ever have any hands-on experience—the OSI reference model. The 
difﬁculty these days when discussing the OSI protocol speciﬁcations is that you have no point 
of reference—you simply cannot typically walk down the hall and use a computer whose 
main, or even optional, networking protocols conform to OSI.
OSI is the Open System Interconnection reference model for communications. Some 
participants in OSI’s creation and development wanted OSI to become the networking 
protocol used by all applications on all computers in the world. The U.S. government went 
so far as to require OSI support on every computer that it purchased, as of a certain date in 
the early 1990s, which certainly gave vendors some incentive to write OSI code. In fact, in 
my old IBM days, they even had charts showing how the TCP/IP-installed base would start 
declining by 1994, how OSI installations would increase, and how OSI would be the 
protocol from which the 21st-century Internet was built. 
What is OSI today? Well, OSI never succeeded in the marketplace. Some of the original 
protocols that comprised OSI are still used. The U.S. government reversed its decision to 
require OSI support on computers that it bought, which was probably the ﬁnal blow to the 
possibility of pervasive OSI implementations. So, why do you even need to think about OSI 
for the CCNA exam? Well, the OSI model now is mainly used as a point of reference for 
discussing other protocol speciﬁcations. And because being a CCNA requires you to 
understand some of the concepts and terms behind networking architecture and models, and 
because other protocols are almost always compared to OSI, you need to know some things 
about OSI.
OSI Layers 
The OSI reference model consists of seven layers. Each layer deﬁnes a set of typical 
networking functions. When OSI was in active development in the 1980s and 1990s, the OSI 
committees created new protocols and speciﬁcations to implement the functions speciﬁed by 
each layer. In other cases, the OSI committees did not create new protocols or standards, but 
instead referenced other protocols that were already deﬁned. For instance, the IEEE deﬁnes 
Ethernet standards, so the OSI committees did not waste time specifying a new type of 
Ethernet; it simply referred to the IEEE Ethernet standards.
Today the OSI model can be used as a standard of comparison to other networking models. 
Figure 2-8 shows OSI, as compared with TCP/IP and Novell NetWare.

32     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
Figure 2-8
Comparing OSI, TCP/IP, and NetWare
Because OSI does have a very well-deﬁned set of functions associated with each of its seven 
layers, you can examine any networking protocol or speciﬁcation and make some 
determination of whether it most closely matches OSI Layer 1, 2, or 3, and so on. For 
instance, TCP/IP’s internetworking layer, as implemented by IP, equates most directly to the 
OSI network layer. So, most people say that IP is a network layer, or Layer 3, protocol, 
using OSI terminology and numbers for the layer. Of course, if you numbered the TCP/IP 
model, starting at the bottom, IP would be in Layer 2—but, by convention, everyone uses the 
OSI standard when describing other protocols. So, using this convention, IP is a network 
layer protocol.
Cisco requires that CCNAs demonstrate an understanding of the functions deﬁned by OSI 
for each layer, as well as some example protocols that correspond to each OSI layer. The 
names of the OSI reference model layers, a few of the typical protocols at each layer, and the 
functions of each layer are simply good things to memorize for the INTRO exam. And 
frankly, if you want to pursue your Cisco certiﬁcations beyond CCNA, these names and 
functional areas will come up continually. 
The upper layers of the OSI reference model (application, presentation, and session—Layers 
7, 6, and 5) deﬁne functions focused on the application. The lower four layers (transport, 
network, data link, and physical—Layers 4, 3, 2, and 1) deﬁne functions focused on end-to-
end delivery of the data. Both CCNA exams focus on issues in the lower layers—in particular, 
with Layer 2, upon which switching is based, and Layer 3, upon which routing is based. 
Table 2-4 deﬁnes the functions of the seven layers, and Table 2-5 lists typical protocols 
considered to be comparable to the OSI layers.

OSI Reference Model     33
Table 2-4
OSI Reference Model Layer Deﬁnitions 
Layer 
Functional Description
7
Layer 7 deﬁnes the interface between the communications software and any 
applications that need to communicate outside the computer on which 
the application resides. For example, a web browser is an application on a 
computer. The browser needs to get the contents of a web page; OSI Layer 7 
deﬁnes the protocols used on behalf of the application to get the web page. 
6
This layer’s main purpose is to deﬁne data formats, such as ASCII text, EBCDIC 
text, binary, BCD, and JPEG. Encryption also is deﬁned by OSI as a presentation 
layer service. For example, FTP enables you to choose binary or ASCII transfer. If 
binary is selected, the sender and receiver do not modify the contents of the ﬁle. If 
ASCII is chosen, the sender translates the text from the sender’s character set to a 
standard ASCII and sends the data. The receiver translates back from the standard 
ASCII to the character set used on the receiving computer.
5
The session layer deﬁnes how to start, control, and end conversations (called 
sessions). This includes the control and management of multiple bidirectional 
messages so that the application can be notiﬁed if only some of a series of messages 
are completed. This allows the presentation layer to have a seamless view of an 
incoming stream of data. The presentation layer can be presented with data if all 
ﬂows occur in some cases. For example, an automated teller machine transaction 
in which you withdraw cash from your checking account should not debit your 
account and then fail before handing you the cash, recording the transaction even 
though you did not receive money. The session layer creates ways to imply which 
ﬂows are part of the same session and which ﬂows must complete before any are 
considered complete.
4
Layer 4 protocols provide a large number of services, as seen in Chapter 5 of this 
book. Although Layers 5 through 7 focus on issues related to the application, 
Layer 4 focuses on issues related to data delivery to the other computer—for 
instance, error recovery, segmentation of large application data blocks into smaller 
ones for transmission, and reassembly of those blocks of data on the receiving 
computer.
3
This layer deﬁnes end-to-end delivery of packets. To accomplish this, the network 
layer deﬁnes logical addressing so that any endpoint can be identiﬁed. It also 
deﬁnes how routing works and how routes are learned so that the packets can be 
delivered. Chapter 4 of this book examines Layer 3 concepts in detail. The 
network layer of OSI deﬁnes most of the details that a Cisco router considers when 
routing. For example, IP running in a Cisco router is responsible for examining the 
destination IP address of a packet, comparing that address to the IP routing table, 
fragmenting the packet if the outgoing interface requires smaller packets, and 
queuing the packet to be sent out to the interface.
2
The data link layer (Layer 2) speciﬁcations deliver data across one particular link 
or medium. These protocols are necessarily concerned with the type of media in 
question; for example, 802.3 and 802.2 deﬁne Ethernet for the IEEE, which are 
referenced by OSI as valid data link layer (Layer 2) protocols. Other protocols, 
such as High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) for a point-to-point WAN link, 
deal with the different details of a WAN link.

OSI Layering Concepts and Beneﬁts
Many beneﬁts can be gained from the process of breaking up the functions or tasks of 
networking into smaller chunks, called layers, and deﬁning standard interfaces between these 
layers. The layers break a large, complex set of concepts and protocols into smaller pieces, 
making it easier to talk about, easier to implement with hardware and software, and easier 
to troubleshoot. The following list summarizes the beneﬁts of layered protocol speciﬁcations:
■
Easier to learn—Humans can more easily discuss and learn about the many details of a 
protocol speciﬁcation.
■
Easier to develop—Reduced complexity allows easier program changes and faster 
product evolution.
■
Multivendor interoperability—Creating products to meet the same networking 
standards means that computers and networking gear from multiple vendors can work 
in the same network. 
Layer 
Functional Description
1
These physical layer (Layer 1) speciﬁcations, which are also typically standards 
from other organizations that are referred to by OSI, deal with the physical 
characteristics of the transmission medium. Connectors, pins, use of pins, electrical 
currents, encoding, and light modulation are all part of different physical layer 
speciﬁcations. Multiple speciﬁcations sometimes are used to complete all details of 
the physical layer. For example, RJ-45 deﬁnes the shape of the connector and the 
number of wires or pins in the cable. Ethernet and 802.3 deﬁne the use of wires or 
pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, to use a Category 5 cable with an RJ-45 connector for an 
Ethernet connection, Ethernet and RJ-45 physical layer speciﬁcations are used.

Modular engineering—One vendor can write software that implements higher layers—
for example, a web browser—and another can write software that implements the lower 
layers—for example, Microsoft’s built-in TCP/IP software in its operating systems.
The beneﬁts of layering can be seen in the familiar postal service analogy. A person writing 
a letter does not have to think about how the postal service will deliver a letter across the 
country. The postal worker in the middle of the country does not have to worry about the 
contents of the letter. Likewise, layering enables one software package or hardware device to 
implement functions from one layer, assuming that other software/hardware will perform the 
functions deﬁned by the other layers. For instance, a web browser does not need to think 
about what the network topology looks like, the Ethernet card in the PC does not need to 
think about the contents of the web page, and a router in the middle of the network does not 
need to worry about the contents of the web page or whether the computer that sent the 
packet was using an Ethernet card or some other networking card. 
OSI Terminology
First, remembering the names of the OSI layers is just an exercise in memorization. You 
might beneﬁt from the following list of mnemonic phrases, with the ﬁrst letters in each word 
being the same as the ﬁrst letters of the OSI layer names, in order:
■
All People Seem To Need Data Processing (Layers 7 to 1)
■
Please Do Not Take Sausage Pizzas Away (Layers 1 to 7)
■
Pew! Dead Ninja Turtles Smell Particularly Awful (Layers 1 to 7)
You also should know how to use the names of the layers when discussing other networking 
models. An example deﬁnitely helps make sense of this concept. In Figure 2-9, you see the 
OSI model, the TCP/IP model, and a third ﬁgure with some sample TCP/IP protocols shown 
at their respective layers.

36     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
As shown in the ﬁgure, the layers in the TCP/IP model correlate to particular layers in the 
OSI model. For instance, the TCP/IP internetwork layer corresponds to the OSI network 
layer. Why? Well, the OSI network layer deﬁnes logical addressing and routing, as does the 
TCP/IP internetwork layer. So, IP is called a network layer, or Layer 3, protocol. Similarly, 
the TCP/IP transport layer deﬁnes many functions, including error recovery, as does the OSI 
transport layer—so TCP is called a transport layer, or Layer 4, protocol. 
Not all TCP/IP layers correspond to a single OSI layer. For instance, the TCP/IP network 
interface layer deﬁnes both the physical network speciﬁcations and the protocols used to 
control the physical network. OSI separates the physical network speciﬁcations into the 
physical layer and the control functions into the data link layer.
Ethernet includes functions deﬁned by OSI Layers 1 and 2. So, depending on the context, you 
can refer to Ethernet as a Layer 1 or Layer 2 protocol. 
The ﬁnal OSI terms covered here all use the base term protocol data unit, or PDU. A PDU 
represents the bits that include the headers and trailers for that layer, as well as the 
encapsulated data. For instance, an IP packet, as shown in Figure 2-7, is a protocol data unit. 
In fact, an IP packet is a Layer 3 PDU because IP is a Layer 3 protocol. The term L3PDU is 
a shorter version of the phrase Layer 3 PDU. Figure 2-10 represents the typical encapsulation 
process, this time for the OSI model, with the terms used for the PDUs listed at each layer.

OSI Summary
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, you learned about how TCP/IP protocols at the various layers 
work with each other and how TCP/IP encapsulates data. Those same concepts are true of 
OSI, as well as other networking models. The basic ideas can be summed up as follows: 
■
Each layer provides a service to the layer above it in the protocol speciﬁcation.
■
Each layer communicates with the same layer’s software or hardware on other 
computers. 
■
To accomplish these tasks, the data is encapsulated progressively with new headers when 
sending the data and is de-encapsulated when receiving the data.

38     Chapter 2: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
INTRO exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
Table 2-6 summarizes the key points about how adjacent layers work together on a single 
computer and how one layer on one computer works with the same networking layer on 
another computer. These concepts are some of the most important concepts in this chapter.
Data encapsulation is another key concept discussed throughout this chapter. You can think 
about the complete process generically or with the example ﬁve-step TCP/IP encapsulation 
process shown in the following list and in Figure 2-11:
Step 1
Create the application data and headers—This simply means that the 
application has data to send.
Step 2
Package the data for transport—In other words, the transport layer 
(TCP or UDP) creates the transport header and places the data behind it. 
Step 3
Add the destination and source network layer addresses to the data—
The network layer creates the network header, which includes the 
network layer addresses, and places the data behind it. 
Step 4
Add the destination and source data link layer addresses to the data—
The data link layer creates the data link header, places the data behind 
it, and places the data link trailer at the end. 
Table 2-6
Summary: Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions
Concept
Description 
Same-layer 
interaction on 
different 
computers
Each layer of a networking model works with the same layer on another 
computer with which it wants to communicate. The protocol deﬁned by 
each layer uses a header that is transmitted between the computers to 
communicate what each computer wants to do. 
Adjacent-layer 
interaction on 
the same 
computer
A higher layer might need a particular service that is not included in that 
layer. To perform the missing function, the protocol at the higher layer 
requests that the next lower layer perform the needed function.

Step 5
Transmit the bits—The physical layer encodes a signal onto the medium 
to transmit the frame.

Data Link Layer Fundamentals: 
Ethernet LANs 
As you learned in the previous chapter, OSI Layers 1 and 2 map closely to the network 
interface layer of TCP/IP. In this chapter, you will learn more details about the functions 
of each of the two lowest layers in the OSI reference model, with speciﬁc coverage of 
Ethernet local-area networks (LANs). 
The introduction to this book mentioned that the INTRO exam covers some topics 
lightly and covers others to great depth. As implied in the title, this chapter hits the 
fundamentals of Ethernet, paving the way for deeper coverage of other topics later in the 
book. Chapter 9, “Cisco LAN Switching Basics,” and Chapter 10, “Virtual LANs and 
Trunking,” delve into a much deeper examination of LAN switches and virtual LANs. 
Chapter 11, “LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies,” increases your breadth of 
knowledge about Ethernet, including a lot of broad details about Ethernet standards, 
cabling, and topologies—all of which can be on the exam.

Foundation Topics
Ethernet is the undisputed king of LAN standards today. Fifteen years ago, people wondered 
whether Ethernet or Token Ring would become win the battle of the LANs. Eight years ago, 
it looked like Ethernet would win that battle, but it might lose to an upstart called 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) in the LAN. Today when you think of LANs, no one 
even questions what type—it’s Ethernet.
Ethernet has remained a viable LAN option for many years because it has adapted to the 
changing needs of the marketplace while retaining some of the key features of the original 
protocols. From the original commercial speciﬁcations that transferred data 10 megabits per 
second (Mbps) to the 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) rates today, Ethernet has evolved and 
become the most proliﬁc LAN protocol ever.
Ethernet deﬁnes both Layer 1 and Layer 2 functions, so this chapter starts with some basic 
concepts in relation to OSI Layers 1 and 2. After that, the three earliest Ethernet standards are 
covered, focusing on the physical layer details. Next, this chapter covers data link layer functions, 
which are common among all the earlier Ethernet standards as well as the newer standards. 
Finally, two of the more recent standards, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet, are introduced.
OSI Perspectives on Local-Area Networks
The OSI physical and data link layers work together to provide the function of delivery of 
data across a wide variety of types of physical networks. Some obvious physical details must 
be agreed upon before communication can happen, such as the cabling, the types of 
connectors used on the ends of the cables, and voltage and current levels used to encode a 
binary 0 or 1. 
The data link layer typically provides functions that are less obvious at ﬁrst glance. For 
instance, it deﬁnes the rules (protocols) to determine when a computer is allowed to use the 
physical network, when the computer should not use the network, and how to recognize 
errors that occurred during transmission of data. Part II, “Operating Cisco Devices,” and 
Part III, “LAN Switching,” cover a few more details about Ethernet Layers 1 and 2.  
Typical LAN Features for OSI Layer 1 
The OSI physical layer, or Layer 1, deﬁnes the details of how to move data from one device 
to another. In fact, many people think of OSI Layer 1 as “sending bits.” Higher layers 
encapsulate the data and decide when and what to send. But eventually, the sender of the data 
needs to actually transmit the bits to another device. The OSI physical layer deﬁnes the 
standards used to send and receive bits across a physical network.

48     Chapter 3: Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs
To keep some perspective on the end goal, consider the example of the web browser 
requesting a web page from the web server. Figure 3-1 reminds you of the point at which Bob 
has built the HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet headers, and is ready to send the data to R2.
Figure 3-1
Data Link Frames Sent Using Physical Layer
In the ﬁgure, Bob’s Ethernet card uses the Ethernet physical layer speciﬁcations to transmit 
the bits shown in the Ethernet frame across the physical Ethernet. The OSI physical layer and 
its equivalent protocols in TCP/IP deﬁne all the details that allow the transmission of the bits 
from one device to the next. For instance, the physical layer deﬁnes the details of cabling—
the maximum length allowed for each type of cable, the number of wires inside the cable, the 
shape of the connector on the end of the cable, and other details. Most cables include several 
conductors (wires) inside the cable; the endpoint of these wires, which end inside the 
connector, are called pins. So, the physical layer also must deﬁne the purpose of each pin, or 
wire. For instance, on a standard Category 5 (CAT5) unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) Ethernet 
cable, pins 1 and 2 are used for transmitting data by sending an electrical signal over the 
wires; pins 3 and 6 are used for receiving data. Figure 3-2 shows an example Ethernet cable, 
with a couple of different views of the RJ-45 connector.

The picture on the left side of the ﬁgure shows a Regulated Jack 45 (RJ-45) connector, which 
is a typical connector used with Ethernet cabling today. The right side shows the pins used 
on the cable when supporting some of the more popular Ethernet standards. One pair of 
wires is used for transmitting data, using pins 1 and 2, and another pair is used for receiving 
data, using pins 3 and 6. The Ethernet shown between Bob and R2 in Figure 3-1 could be 
built with cables, using RJ-45 connectors, along with hubs or switches. (Hubs and switches 
are deﬁned later in this chapter.)
The cable shown in Figure 3-2 is called a straight-through cable. A straight-through cable 
connects pin 1 on one end of the cable with pin 1 on the other end, pin 2 on one end to pin 
2 on the other, and so on. If you hold the cable so that you compare both connectors side by 
side, with the same orientation for each connector, you should see the same color wires for 
each pin with a straight-through cable.
One of the things that surprises people who have never thought about network cabling is the 
fact that many cables use two wires for transmitting data and that the wires are twisted 
around each other inside the cable. When two wires are twisted inside the cable, they are 
called a twisted pair (ingenious name, huh?). By twisting the wires, the electromagnetic 
interference caused by the electrical current is greatly reduced. So, most LAN cabling uses 
two twisted pairs—one pair for transmitting and one for receiving. 
The OSI physical layer and its equivalent protocols in TCP/IP deﬁne all the details that allow 
the transmission of the bits from one device to the next. In later sections of this chapter, you 
will learn more about the speciﬁc physical layer standards for Ethernet. Table 3-2 
summarizes the most typical details deﬁned by physical layer protocols.
Table 3-2
Typical Physical Layer Functions
Function
Description
Cabling
Deﬁnes the number of wires and the type of shielding used (or not used).
Connectors
Deﬁnes the shape of the connectors and the number of pins.
Pins
Deﬁnes the purpose of the pins. For instance, one pin might be used to 
signal to the other device whether it is allowed to send.
Voltage and current
Deﬁnes the electrical characteristics of the endpoint devices that use a 
cable.
Encoding
Deﬁnes how a device signals a binary 0 or 1 onto the transmit pin(s). 
For instance, +5V might mean 1, and –5V might mean 0. (Many 
encoding schemes exist and are beyond the scope of CCNA.)

50     Chapter 3: Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs
Typical LAN Features for OSI Layer 2
OSI Layer 2, the data link layer, deﬁnes the standards and protocols used to control the 
transmission of data across a physical network. If you think of Layer 1 as “sending bits,” 
you can think of Layer 2 as meaning “knowing when to send the bits, noticing when errors 
occurred when sending bits, and identifying the computer that needs to get the bits.”
Similar to the section about the physical layer, this short section describes the basic data link 
layer functions. Later, you will read about the speciﬁc standards and protocols for Ethernet.
Data link protocols perform many functions, with a variety of implementation details. 
Because each data link protocol “controls” a particular type of physical layer network, the 
details of how a data link protocol works must include some consideration of the physical 
network. However, regardless of the type of physical network, most data link protocols 
perform the following functions:  
■
Arbitration—Determines when it is appropriate to use the physical medium
■
Addressing—Ensures that the correct recipient(s) receives and processes the data that is 
sent
■
Error detection—Determines whether the data made the trip across the physical medium 
successfully
■
Identiﬁcation of the encapsulated data—Determines the type of header that follows the 
data link header 
Data Link Function 1: Arbitration
Imagine trying to get through an intersection in your car when all the trafﬁc signals are out—
you all want to use the intersection, but you had better use it one at a time. You ﬁnally get 
through the intersection based on a lot of variables—on how tentative you are, how big the 
other cars are, how new or old your car is, and how much you value your own life! 
Regardless, you cannot allow cars from every direction to enter the intersection at the same 
time without having some potentially serious collisions.
With some types of physical networks, data frames can collide if devices can send any time 
they want. When frames collide in a LAN, the data in each frame is corrupted and the LAN 
is unusable for a brief moment—not too different from a car crash in the middle of an 
intersection. The speciﬁcations for these data-link protocols deﬁne how to arbitrate the use 
of the physical medium to avoid collisions, or at least to recover from the collisions when 
they occur.
Ethernet uses the carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm 
for arbitration. The CSMA/CD algorithm is covered in the upcoming section on Ethernet.

OSI Perspectives on Local-Area Networks     51
Data Link Function 2: Addressing
When I sit and have lunch with my friend Gary, and just Gary, he knows I am talking to him. 
I don’t need to start every sentence by saying “Hey, Gary….” Now imagine that a few other 
people join us for lunch—I might need to say something like “Hey, Gary…” before saying 
something so that Gary knows I’m talking to him.
Data-link protocols deﬁne addresses for the same reasons. Many physical networks allow 
more than two devices attached to the same physical network. So, data-link protocols deﬁne 
addresses to make sure that the correct device listens and receives the data that is sent. By 
putting the correct address in the data-link header, the sender of the frame can be relatively 
sure that the correct receiver will get the data. It’s just like sitting at the lunch table and 
having to say “Hey Gary…” before talking to Gary so that he knows you are talking to him 
and not someone else.
Each data-link protocol deﬁnes its own unique addressing structure. For instance, Ethernet 
uses Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which are 6 bytes long and are represented as 
a 12-digit hexadecimal number. Frame Relay typically uses a 10-bit-long address called a 
data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI)—notice that the name even includes the phrase data 
link. This chapter covers the details of Ethernet addressing. You will learn about Frame Relay 
addressing in the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. 
Data Link Function 3: Error Detection
Error detection discovers whether bit errors occurred during the transmission of the frame. 
To do this, most data-link protocols include a frame check sequence (FCS) or cyclical 
redundancy check (CRC) ﬁeld in the data-link trailer. This ﬁeld contains a value that is the 
result of a mathematical formula applied to the data in the frame. 
An error is detected when the receiver plugs the contents of the received frame into a 
mathematical formula. Both the sender and the receiver of the frame use the same 
calculation, with the sender putting the results of the formula in the FCS ﬁeld before sending 
the frame. If the FCS sent by the sender matches what the receiver calculates, the frame did 
not have any errors during transmission. 
Error detection does not imply recovery; most data links, including IEEE 802.5 Token Ring 
and 802.3 Ethernet, do not provide error recovery. The FCS allows the receiving device to 
notice that errors occurred and then discard the data frame. Error recovery, which includes 
the resending of the data, is the responsibility of another protocol. For instance, TCP 
performs error recovery, as described in Chapter 6, “Fundamentals of TCP and UDP.” 

52     Chapter 3: Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs
Data Link Function 4: Identifying the Encapsulated Data
Finally, the fourth part of a data link identiﬁes the contents of the Data ﬁeld in the frame. 
Figure 3-3 helps make the usefulness of this feature apparent. The ﬁgure shows a PC that uses 
both TCP/IP to talk to a web server and Novell IPX to talk to a Novell NetWare server.
Figure 3-3
Multiplexing Using Data-Link Type and Protocol Fields
When PC1 receives data, should it give the data to the TCP/IP software or the NetWare client 
software? Of course, that depends on what is inside the Data ﬁeld. If the data came from the 
Novell server, PC1 hands off the data to the NetWare client code. If the data comes from the 
web server, PC1 hands it off to the TCP/IP code. But how does PC1 make this decision? Well, 
IEEE Ethernet 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) uses a ﬁeld in its header to identify the type 
of data in the Data ﬁeld. PC1 examines that ﬁeld in the received frame to decide whether the 
packet is an IP packet or an IPX packet.
Each data-link header has a ﬁeld, generically with a name that has the word Type in it, to 
identify the type of protocol that sits inside the frame’s data ﬁeld. In each case, the Type ﬁeld 
has a code that means IP, IPX, or some other designation, deﬁning the type of protocol header 
that follows. 
Early Ethernet Standards 
Now that you have a little better understanding of some of the functions of physical and data 
link standards, the next section focuses on Ethernet in particular. This chapter covers some 
of the basics, while Chapters 9 through 11 cover the topics in more detail. 
In this section of the chapter, you learn about the three earliest types of Ethernet networks. 
The term Ethernet refers to a family of protocols and standards that together deﬁne the 
physical and data link layers of the world’s most popular type of LAN. Many variations of 
Ethernet exist; this section covers the functions and protocol speciﬁcations for the more 
popular types of Ethernet, including 10BASE-T, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit Ethernet. Also, 
to help you appreciate how some of the features of Ethernet work, this section covers 
historical knowledge on two older types of Ethernet, 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 Ethernet.

Early Ethernet Standards     53
Standards Overview
Like most protocols, Ethernet began life inside a corporation that was looking to solve a 
speciﬁc problem. Xerox needed an effective way to allow a new invention, called the personal 
computer, to be connected in its ofﬁces. From that, Ethernet was born. (Look at 
inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa111598.htm for an interesting story on the history of 
Ethernet.) Eventually, Xerox teamed with Intel and Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) to 
further develop Ethernet, so the original Ethernet became known as DIX Ethernet, meaning 
DEC, Intel, and Xerox.
The IEEE began creating a standardized version of Ethernet in February 1980, building on 
the work performed by DEC, Intel, and Xerox. The IEEE Ethernet speciﬁcations that match 
OSI Layer 2 were divided into two parts: the Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link 
Control (LLC) sublayers. The IEEE formed a committee to work on each part—the 802.3 
committee to work on the MAC sublayer, and the 802.2 committee to work on the LLC 
sublayer. 
Table 3-3 lists the various protocol speciﬁcations for the original three IEEE LAN standards, 
plus the original prestandard version of Ethernet.
The Original Ethernet Standards: 10BASE2 and 10BASE5
Ethernet is best understood by ﬁrst considering the early DIX Ethernet speciﬁcations, called 
10BASE5 and 10BASE2. These two Ethernet speciﬁcations deﬁned the details of the physical 
layer of early Ethernet networks. (10BASE2 and 10BASE5 differ in the cabling details, but 
for the discussion included in this chapter, you can consider them as behaving identically.) 
With these two speciﬁcations, the network engineer installs a series of coaxial cables, 
connecting each device on the Ethernet network—there is no hub, switch, or wiring panel. 
The Ethernet consists solely of the collective Ethernet cards in the computers and the cabling. 
The series of cables creates an electrical bus that is shared among all devices on the Ethernet. 
When a computer wants to send some bits to another computer on the bus, it sends an 
electrical signal, and the electricity propagates to all devices on the Ethernet.

54     Chapter 3: Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs
Because it is a single bus, if two or more signals were sent at the same time, the two would 
overlap and collide, making both signals unintelligible. So, not surprisingly, Ethernet also 
deﬁned a speciﬁcation for how to ensure that only one device sends trafﬁc on the Ethernet at 
one time—otherwise, the Ethernet would have been unusable. The algorithm, known as the 
carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm, deﬁnes how the 
bus is accessed. In human terms, CSMA/CD is similar to what happens in a meeting room 
with many attendees. Some people talk much of the time. Some do not talk, but they listen. 
Others talk occasionally. Being humans, it’s hard to understand what two people are saying 
at the same time, so generally, one person is talking and the rest are listening. Imagine that 
Bob and Larry both want to reply to the current speaker’s comments. As soon as the speaker 
takes a breath, Bob and Larry might both try to speak. If Larry hears Bob’s voice before Larry 
actually makes a noise, Larry might stop and let Bob speak. Or, maybe they both start at 
almost the same time, so they talk over each other and many others in the room can’t hear 
what was said. Then there’s the proverbial “Excuse me, you talk next,” and eventually Larry 
or Bob talks. Or, in some cases, another person jumps in and talks while Larry and Bob are 
both backing off. These “rules” are based on your culture; CSMA/CD is based on Ethernet 
protocol speciﬁcations and achieves the same type of goal.
Figure 3-4 shows the basic logic of an old Ethernet 10BASE2 network, which literally uses a 
single electrical bus, created with coaxial cable and Ethernet cards.
Figure 3-4
Small Ethernet 10BASE2 Network
The solid lines in the ﬁgure represent the physical network cabling. The dashed lines with 
arrows represent the path that Larry’s transmitted frame takes. Larry sends a signal across 
out his Ethernet card onto the cable, and both Bob and Archie receive the signal. The cabling 
creates a physical electrical bus, meaning that the transmitted signal is received by all stations 
on the LAN. Just like a school bus stops at everyone’s house along a route, the electrical 
signal on a 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network is propagated to each station on the LAN.

Early Ethernet Standards     55
Because the transmitted electrical signal travels along the entire length of the bus, when two stations 
send at the same time, a collision occurs. The collision ﬁrst occurs on the wire, and then some time 
elapses before the sending stations hear the collision—so technically, the stations send a few more 
bits before they actually notice the collision. CSMA/CD logic helps prevent collisions and also 
deﬁnes how to act when a collision does occur. The CSMA/CD algorithm works like this: 
1.
A device with a frame to send listens until the Ethernet is not busy.
2.
When the Ethernet is not busy, the sender begins sending the frame.
3.
The sender listens to make sure that no collision occurred.
4.
Once the senders hear the collision, they each send a jamming signal, to ensure that all 
stations recognize the collision.
5.
After the jamming is complete, each sender randomizes a timer and waits that long.
6.
When each timer expires, the process starts over with Step 1.
So, all devices on the Ethernet need to use CSMA/CD to avoid collisions and to recover when 
inadvertent collisions occur.
Repeaters
Like any type of network, 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 had limitations on the total length of a 
cable. With 10BASE5, the limit was 500 m; with 10BASE2, it was 185 m. Interestingly, these 
two types of Ethernet get their name from the maximum segment lengths—if you think of 
185 m as being close to 200 m, then the last digit of the names deﬁnes the multiple of 100 m 
that is the maximum length of a segment. That’s really where the 5 and the 2 came from in 
the names.
In some cases, the length was not enough. So, a device called a repeater was developed. One 
of the problems with using longer segment lengths was that the signal sent by one device 
could attenuate too much if the cable was longer that 500 m or 185 m, respectively. 
Attenuation means that when electrical signals pass over a wire, the strength of the signal 
gets smaller the farther along the cable it travels. It’s the same concept behind why you can 
hear someone talking right next to you, but if that person speaks at the same volume and you 
are across the room, you might not hear her because the sound waves have attenuated.
Repeaters allow multiple segments to be connected by taking an incoming signal, 
interpreting the bits as 1s and 0s, and generating a brand new, clean signal. A repeater does 
not simply amplify the signal because amplifying the signal might also amplify any noise 
picked up along the way. 
NOTE
Because the repeater does not interpret what the bits mean, but does examine and 
generate electrical signals, a repeater is considered to operate at Layer 1. 

56     Chapter 3: Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs
So, why all this focus on standards for Ethernets that you will never work with? Well, these 
older standards provide a point of comparison to how things work today, with several of the 
features of these two early standards being maintained today. Now, on to an Ethernet 
standard that is still found occasionally in production networks today—10BASE-T.
10BASE-T Ethernet 
10BASE-T solved several problems with the early Ethernet speciﬁcations. 10BASE-T allowed 
the use of telephone cabling that was already installed, or simply allowed the use of cheaper, 
easier-to-install cabling when new cabling was required. 10BASE-T networks make use of 
devices called hubs, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-5
Small Ethernet 10BASE-T Network
The physical 10BASE-T Ethernet uses Ethernet cards in the computers, cabling, and a hub. 
The hubs used to create a 10BASE-T Ethernet are essentially multiport repeaters. That means 
that the hub simply regenerates the electrical signal that comes in one port and sends the 
same signal out every other port. By doing so, 10BASE-T creates an electrical bus, just like 
10BASE2 and 10BASE5. Therefore, collisions can still occur, so CSMA/CD access rules 
continue to be used.
The use of 10BASE-T hubs gives Ethernet much higher availability compared with 10BASE2 
and 10BASE5 because a single cable problem could, and probably did, take down those types 
of LANs. With 10BASE-T, a cable is run from each device to a hub, so a single cable problem 
affects only one device.
The concept of cabling each device to a central hub, with that hub creating the same electrical 
bus as in the older types of Ethernet, was a core fact of 10BASE-T Ethernet. Because hubs 
continued the concept and physical reality of a single electrical path that is shared by all 
devices, today we call this shared Ethernet: All devices are sharing a single 10-Mbps bus. 
A variety of terms can be used to describe the topology of networks. The term star refers to 
a network with a center, with branches extended outward—much like how a child might 
draw a picture of a star. 10BASE-T network cabling uses a star topology, as seen in Figure 3-
5. However, because the hub repeats the electrical signal out every port, the effect is that the

network acts like a bus topology. So, 10BASE-T networks are a physical star network design, 
but also a logical bus network design. (Chapter 11 covers the types of topologies and their 
meaning in more depth.)
Ethernet 10BASE-T Cabling
The PCs and hub in Figure 3-5 typically use Category 5 UTP cables with RJ-45 connectors, 
as shown in Figure 3-2. The Ethernet cards in each PC have an RJ-45 connector, as does the 
hub; these connectors are larger versions of the same type of connector used for telephone 
cords between a phone and the wall plate in the United States. So, connecting the Ethernet 
cables is as easy as plugging in a new phone at your house.
The details behind the speciﬁc cable used to connect to the hub are important in real life as 
well as for the INTRO exam. The detailed speciﬁcations are covered in Chapter 11, and the 
most typical standards are covered here. You might recall that Ethernet speciﬁes that the pair 
of wires on pins 1 and 2 is used to transmit data, and pins 3 and 6 are used for receiving data. 
The PC Ethernet cards do indeed use the pins in exactly that way. 
The cable used to connect the PCs to the hub is called a straight-through cable, as shown 
back in Figure 3-2. In a straight-through cable, the wire connected to pin 1 on one end of the 
cable is connected to pin 1 on the other side, pin 2 is connected to pin 2 on the other end, 
and so on. Therefore, when Larry sends data on the pair on pins 1 and 2, the hub receives 
the electrical signal over the straight-through cable on pins 1 and 2. So, for the hub to 
correctly receive the data, the hub must think oppositely, as compared to the PC—in other 
words, the hub receives data on pins 1 and 2, and transmits on pins 3 and 6. Figure 3-6 
outlines how it all works.
Figure 3-6
Straight-Through Ethernet Cable with Exaggerated RJ-45 Connectors
For example, Larry might send data on pins 1 and 2, with the hub receiving the signal on 
pins 1 and 2. The hub then repeats the electrical signal out the other ports, sending the signal 
to Archie and Bob. The hub transmits the signal on pins 3 and 6 on the cables connected to 
Archie and Bob because Archie and Bob expect to receive data on pins 3 and 6.
In some cases, you need to cable two devices directly together with Ethernet, but both devices 
use the same pair for transmitting data. For instance, you might want to connect two hubs,

and each hub transmits on pins 3 and 6, as just mentioned. Similarly, you might want to 
create a small Ethernet between two PCs simply by cabling the two PCs together—but both 
PCs use pins 1 and 2 for transmitting data. To solve this problem, you use a special cable 
called a crossover cable. Instead of pin 1 on one end of the cable being the same wire as pin 
1 on the other end of the cable, pin 1 on one end of the cable becomes pin 3 on the other end. 
Similarly, pin 2 is connected to pin 6 at the other end, pin 3 is connected to pin 1, and pin 6 
is connected to pin 2. Figure 3-7 shows an example with two PCs connected and a crossover 
cable.
Figure 3-7
Crossover Ethernet Cable 
Both Bob and Larry can transmit on pins 1 and 2—which is good because that’s the only 
thing an Ethernet card for an end user computer can do. Because pins 1 and 2 at Larry 
connect to pins 3 and 6 at Bob, and because Bob receives frames on pins 3 and 6, the receive 
function works as well. The same thing happens for frames sent by Bob to Larry—Bob sends 
on his pins 1 and 2, and Larry receives on pins 3 and 6.
Most of the time, you will not actually connect two computers directly with an Ethernet 
cable. However, you typically will use crossover cables for connections between switches and 
hubs. An Ethernet cable between two hubs or switches often is called a trunk. Figure 3-8 
shows a typical network with two switches in each building and the typical cable types used 
for each connection.

10BASE-T Hubs
Compared to 10BASE2 and 10BASE5, hubs solved some cabling and availability problems. 
However, the use of hubs allowed network performance to degrade as utilization increased, 
just like when 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 were used, because 10BASE-T still created a single 
electrical bus shared among all devices on the LAN. Ethernets that share a bus cannot reach 
100 percent utilization because of collisions and the CSMA/CD arbitration algorithm. To 
solve the performance problems, the next step was to make the hub smart enough to ensure 
that collisions simply did not happen—which means that CSMA/CD would no longer be 
needed. 
First, you need a deeper knowledge of 10BASE-T hubs before the solution to the congestion 
problem becomes obvious. Figure 3-9 outlines the operation of half-duplex 10BASE-T with 
hubs.

The ﬁgure outlines how a 10BASE-T hub creates an electrical bus. The chronological steps 
illustrated in Figure 3-9 are as follows:
1.
The network interface card (NIC) sends a frame.
2.
The NIC loops the sent frame onto its receive pair internally on the card.
3.
The hub receives the frame.
4.
The hub’s internal wiring propagates the signal to all other ports, but not back to the 
port that the signal was received upon. 
5.
The hub repeats the signal to each receive pair to all other devices. 
The ﬁgure details how the hub works, with one device sending and no collision. If PC1 and 
PC2 sent a frame at the same time, a collision would occur. At Steps 4 and 5, the hub would 
forward both electrical signals, which would cause the overlapping signals to be sent to all 
the NICs. So, because collisions can occur, CSMA/CD logic still is needed to have PC1 and 
PC2 wait and try again. 
Performance Issues: Collisions and Duplex Settings
10BASE2, 10BASE5, and 10BASE-T Ethernet would not work without CSMA/CD. 
However, because of the CSMA/CD algorithm, Ethernet becomes more inefﬁcient under 
higher loads. In fact, during the years before LAN switches made these types of phenomena 
go away, the rule of thumb was that an Ethernet began to degrade when the load began to 
exceed 30 percent utilization.
In the next section, you will read about two things that have improved network performance, 
both relating to the reduction or even elimination of collisions: LAN switching and full-
duplex Ethernet.
Reducing Collisions Through LAN Switching
The term collision domain deﬁnes the set of devices for which their frames could collide. All 
devices on a 10BASE2, 10BASE5, or 10BASE-T network using a hub risk collisions between 
NOTE
PC2 would sense a collision because of its loopback circuitry on the NIC. The hub 
does not forward the signal that PC2 sent to the hub back to PC2. Instead, each NIC loops 
the frame that it sends back to its own receive pair on the NIC, as shown in Step 2 of the 
ﬁgure. Then, if PC2 is sending a frame and PC1 also sends a frame at the same time, the 
signal sent by PC1 is forwarded by the hub to PC2 on PC2’s receive pair. The incoming 
signal from the hub, plus the looped signal on PC2’s NIC, lets PC2 notice that there is a 
collision. Who cares? Well, to appreciate full-duplex LAN operation, you need to know 
about the NIC’s loopback feature.

Early Ethernet Standards     61
the frames that they send, so all devices on one of these types of Ethernet networks are in the 
same collision domain. For instance, all the devices in Figure 3-9 are in the same collision 
domain.
LAN switches overcome the problems created by collisions and the CSMA/CD algorithm by 
removing the possibility of a collision. Switches do not create a single shared bus, like a hub; 
they treat each individual physical port as a separate bus. Switches use memory buffers to 
hold incoming frames as well, so when two attached devices send a frame at the same time, 
the switch can forward one frame while holding the other frame in a memory buffer, waiting 
to forward one frame until after the ﬁrst one has been forwarded. So, as Figure 3-10 
illustrates, collisions can be avoided.
Figure 3-10
Basic Switch Operation
In Figure 3-10, both PC1 and PC3 are sending at the same time. The switch looks at the 
destination Ethernet address and sends the frame sent from PC1 to PC2 at the same instant 
as the frame is sent by PC3 to PC4. The big difference between the hub and the switch is that

the switch interpreted the electrical signal as an Ethernet frame and processed the frame to 
make a decision. (The details of Ethernet addressing and framing are coming up in the next 
two sections.) A hub simply repeats the electrical signal and makes no attempt to interpret 
the electrical signal (Layer 1) as a LAN frame (Layer 2). So, a hub actually performs OSI 
Layer 1 functions, repeating an electrical signal, whereas a switch performs OSI Layer 2 
functions, actually interpreting Ethernet header information, particularly addresses, to make 
forwarding decisions. 
Buffering also helps prevent collisions. Imagine that PC1 and PC3 both sent a frame to PC4 
at the same time. The switch, knowing that forwarding both frames to PC4 would cause a 
collision, would buffer one frame until the ﬁrst one has been completely sent to PC4.
Two features of switching bring a great deal of improved performance to Ethernet, as 
compared with hubs:
■
If only one device is cabled to each port of a switch, no collisions occur. If no collisions 
can occur, CSMA/CD can be disabled, solving the Ethernet performance problem.
■
Each switch port does not share the bandwidth, but it has its own separate bandwidth, 
meaning that a switch with a 10-Mbps ports has 10 Mbps of bandwidth per port.
So, LAN switching brings signiﬁcant performance to Ethernet LANs. The next section covers 
another topic that effectively doubles Ethernet performance.
Eliminating Collisions to Allow Full-Duplex Ethernet
The original Ethernet speciﬁcations used a shared bus, over which only one frame could be 
sent at any point in time. So, a single device could not be sending a frame and receiving a 
frame at the same time because it would mean that a collision was occurring. So, devices 
simply chose not to send a frame while receiving a frame. That logic is called half-duplex 
logic.
Ethernet switches allow multiple frames to be sent over different ports at the same time. 
Additionally, if only one device is connected to a switch port, there is never a possibility that 
a collision could occur. So, LAN switches with only one device cabled to each port of the 
switch allow the use of full-duplex operation. Full duplex means that an Ethernet card can 
send and receive concurrently. Consider Figure 3-11, which shows the full-duplex circuitry 
used with a single PC cabled to a LAN switch.

Ethernet Data-Link Protocols     63
Figure 3-11
10BASE-T Full-Duplex Operation Using a Switch
Full duplex allows the full speed—10 Mbps, in this example—to be used in both directions 
simultaneously. For this to work, the NIC must disable its loopback circuitry. 
So far in this chapter, you have read about the basics of 12 years of Ethernet evolution. Table 3-4 
summarizes some of the key points as they relate to what is covered in this initial section of 
the chapter. 
Ethernet Data-Link Protocols
One of the most signiﬁcant strengths of the Ethernet family of protocols is that these 
protocols use the same small set of data-link protocols. For instance, Ethernet addressing 
works the same on all the variations of Ethernet, even back to 10BASE5. This section covers 
most of the details of the Ethernet data-link protocols.

Ethernet Addressing
Ethernet LAN addressing identiﬁes either individual devices or groups of devices on a LAN. 
Unicast Ethernet addresses identify a single LAN card. Each address is 6 bytes long, is usually 
written in hexadecimal, and, in Cisco devices, typically is written with periods separating 
each set of four hex digits. For example, 0000.0C12.3456 is a valid Ethernet address. The 
term  unicast addresses, or individual addresses, is used because it identiﬁes an individual 
LAN interface card. (The term unicast was chosen mainly for contrast with the terms 
broadcast, multicast, and group addresses.) 
Computers use these addresses to identify the sender and receiver of an Ethernet frame. For 
instance, imagine that Fred and Barney are on the same Ethernet, and Fred sends Barney a 
frame. Fred puts his own Ethernet MAC address in the Ethernet header as the source address 
and uses Barney’s Ethernet MAC address as the destination. When Barney receives the frame, 
he notices that the destination address is his own address, so Barney processes the frame. If 
Barney receives a frame with some other device’s unicast address in the destination address 
ﬁeld, Barney simply does not process the frame.
The IEEE deﬁnes the format and assignment of LAN addresses. The IEEE requires globally 
unique unicast MAC addresses on all LAN interface cards. (IEEE calls them MAC addresses 
because the MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.3 deﬁne the addressing details.) To ensure a 
unique MAC address, the Ethernet card manufacturers encode the MAC address onto the 
card, usually in a ROM chip. The ﬁrst half of the address identiﬁes the manufacturer of the 
card. This code, which is assigned to each manufacturer by the IEEE, is called the 
organizationally unique identiﬁer (OUI). Each manufacturer assigns a MAC address with its 
own OUI as the ﬁrst half of the address, with the second half of the address being assigned 
a number that this manufacturer has never used on another card. 
Many terms can be used to describe unicast LAN addresses. Each LAN card comes with a 
burned-in address (BIA) that is burned into the ROM chip on the card. BIAs sometimes are 
called universally administered addresses (UAAs) because the IEEE universally (well, at least 
worldwide) administers address assignment. Regardless of whether the BIA is used or 
another address is conﬁgured, many people refer to unicast addresses as either LAN 
addresses, Ethernet addresses, or MAC addresses.
Group addresses identify more than one LAN interface card. The IEEE deﬁnes two general 
categories of group addresses for Ethernet:
■
Broadcast addresses—The most often used of IEEE group MAC addresses, the broadcast 
address, has a value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (hexadecimal notation). The broadcast address 
implies that all devices on the LAN should process the frame.

Ethernet Data-Link Protocols     65
■
Multicast addresses—Multicast addresses are used to allow a subset of devices on a LAN 
to communicate. Some applications need to communicate with multiple other devices. 
By sending one frame, all the devices that care about receiving the data sent by that 
application can process the data, and the rest can ignore it. The IP protocol supports 
multicasting. When IP multicasts over an Ethernet, the multicast MAC addresses used 
by IP follow this format: 0100.5exx.xxxx, where any value can be used in the last half 
of the addresses. 
Table 3-5 summarizes most of the details about MAC addresses.
Ethernet Framing
Framing deﬁnes how a string of binary numbers is interpreted. In other words, framing 
deﬁnes the meaning behind the bits that are transmitted across a network. The physical layer 
helps you get a string of bits from one device to another. When the receiving device gets the 
bits, how should they be interpreted? The term framing refers to the deﬁnition of the ﬁelds 
assumed to be in the data that is received. In other words, framing deﬁnes the meaning of the 
bits transmitted and received over a network.  
For instance, you just read an example of Fred sending data to Barney over an Ethernet. Fred 
put Barney’s Ethernet address in the Ethernet header so that Barney would know that the 
Ethernet frame was meant for Barney. The IEEE 802.3 standard deﬁnes the location of the 
destination address ﬁeld inside the string of bits sent across the Ethernet. Figure 3-12 shows 
the details of several types of LAN frames.

LAN Header Formats
Every little ﬁeld in these frames might not be interesting, but you should at least remember 
some details about the contents of the headers and trailers. In particular, the addresses and 
their location in the headers are important. Also, the names of the ﬁelds that identify the type 
of data inside the Ethernet frame—namely, the Type, DSAP, and SNAP ﬁelds—are important. 
Finally, the fact that a FCS exists in the trailer is also vital. 
The IEEE 802.3 speciﬁcation limits the data portion of the 802.3 frame to a maximum of 
1500 bytes. The Data ﬁeld was designed to hold Layer 3 packets; the term maximum 
transmission unit (MTU) deﬁnes the maximum Layer 3 packet that can be sent over a 
medium. Because the Layer 3 packet rests inside the data portion of an Ethernet frame, 1500 
bytes is the largest IP packet allowed over an Ethernet.
Identifying the Data Inside an Ethernet Frame
Each data-link header has a ﬁeld in its header with a code that deﬁnes the type of protocol 
header that follows. For example, in the ﬁrst frame in Figure 3-13, the Destination Service 
Access Point (DSAP) ﬁeld has a value of E0, which means that the next header is a Novell 
IPX header. Why is that? Well, when the IEEE created 802.2, it saw the need for a protocol 
type ﬁeld that identiﬁed what was inside the ﬁeld called “data” in an IEEE Ethernet frame.

802.2 SAP and SNAP Type Fields
The IEEE called its Type ﬁeld the destination service access point (DSAP). When the IEEE 
ﬁrst created the 802.2 standard, anyone with a little cash could register favorite protocols 
with the IEEE and receive a reserved value with which to identify those favorite protocols in 
the DSAP ﬁeld. For instance, Novell registered IPX and was assigned hex E0 by the IEEE. 
However, the IEEE did not plan for a large number of protocols—and it was wrong. As it 
turns out, the 1-byte-long DSAP ﬁeld is not big enough to number all the protocols. 
To accommodate more protocols, the IEEE allowed the use of an extra header, called a 
Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header. In the second frame of Figure 3-13, the DSAP 
ﬁeld is AA, which implies that a SNAP header follows the 802.2 header, and the SNAP 
header includes a 2-byte protocol type ﬁeld. The SNAP protocol type ﬁeld is used for the 
same purpose as the DSAP ﬁeld, but because it is 2 bytes long, all the possible protocols can 
be identiﬁed. For instance, in Figure 3-13, the SNAP type ﬁeld has a value of 0800, signifying 
that the next header is an IP header. RFC 1700, “Assigned Numbers” (www.isi.edu/in-notes/
rfc1700.txt), lists the SAP and SNAP Type ﬁeld values and the protocol types that they imply.
Table 3-6 summarizes the ﬁelds that are used for identifying the types of data contained in a 
frame.
Some examples of values in the Ethernet Type and SNAP Protocol ﬁelds are 0800 for IP and 
8137 for NetWare. Examples of IEEE SAP values are E0 for NetWare, 04 for SNA, and AA 
for SNAP. Interestingly, the IEEE does not have a reserved DSAP value for TCP/IP; SNAP 
headers must be used to support TCP/IP over IEEE Ethernet.

Layer 2 Ethernet Summary
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, physical layer protocols deﬁne how to deliver data 
across a physical medium. Data-link protocols make that physical network useful by deﬁning 
how and when the physical network is used. Ethernet deﬁnes the OSI Layer 1 functions for 
Ethernet, including cabling, connectors, voltage levels, and cabling distance limitations, as 
well as many important OSI Layer 2 functions. In this section, four of these data link features 
were emphasized, as shown in Table 3-7.
Recent Ethernet Standards
In most networks today, you would not use 10BASE2 or 10BASE5—in fact, you probably 
might not have many 10BASE-T hubs still in your network. More recently created 
alternatives, such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet, provide faster Ethernet options at 
reasonable costs. Both have gained widespread acceptance in networks today, with Fast 
Ethernet most likely being used on the desktop and Gigabit Ethernet being used between 
networking devices or on servers. Additionally, 10 Gb provides yet another improvement in 
speed and performance and is covered brieﬂy in Chapter 11.
Fast Ethernet
Fast Ethernet, as deﬁned in IEEE 802.3u, retains many familiar features of 10-Mbps IEEE 
802.3 Ethernet variants. The age-old CSMA/CD logic still exists, but it can be disabled for 
full-duplex point-to-point topologies in which no collisions can occur. The 802.3u 
speciﬁcation calls for the use of the same old IEEE 802.3 MAC and 802.2 LLC framing for 
the LAN headers and trailers. A variety of cabling options is allowed—unshielded and 
shielded copper cabling as well as multimode and single-mode ﬁber. Both Fast Ethernet 
shared hubs and switches can be deployed.

Recent Ethernet Standards     69
Two of the key features of Fast Ethernet, as compared to 10-Mbps Ethernet, are higher 
bandwidth and autonegotiation. Fast Ethernet operates at 100 Mbps—enough said. The 
other key difference, autonegotiation, allows an Ethernet card or switch to negotiate 
dynamically to discover whether it should use either 10 or 100 Mbps. So, many Ethernet 
cards and switch ports are called 10/100 cards or ports today because they can autonegotiate 
the speed. The endpoints autonegotiate whether to use half duplex or full duplex as well. If 
autonegotiation fails, it settles for half-duplex operation at 10 Mbps.
The autonegotiation process has been known to fail. Cisco recommends that, for devices that 
seldom move, such as servers and switches, you should conﬁgure the LAN switch and the 
device to use the identical desired setting instead of depending on autonegotiation. Cisco 
recommends using autonegotiation for switch ports connected to end-user devices because these 
devices are moved frequently relative to servers or other network devices, such as routers.
Gigabit Ethernet
The IEEE deﬁnes Gigabit Ethernet in standards 802.3z for optical cabling and 802.3ab for 
electrical cabling. Like Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet retains many familiar features of 
slower Ethernet variants. CSMA/CD still is used and can be disabled for full-duplex support. 
The 802.3z and 802.3ab standards call for the use of the same old IEEE 802.3 MAC and 
802.2 LLC framing for the LAN headers and trailers. The most likely place to use Gigabit is 
between switches, between switches and a router, and between a switch and a server. 
Gigabit Ethernet is similar to its slower cousins in several ways. The most important 
similarity is that the same Ethernet headers and trailers are used, regardless of whether it’s 
10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps. If you understand how Ethernet works for 10 and 100 
Mbps, then you know most of what you need to know about Gigabit Ethernet.
Gigabit Ethernet differs from the slower Ethernet speciﬁcations in how it encodes the signals 
onto the cable. Gigabit Ethernet is obviously faster, at 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gbps.

Fundamentals of WANs
In the previous chapter, you learned more details about OSI Layers 1 and 2, and how 
Ethernet LANs perform the functions deﬁned by the two lowest OSI layers. In this 
chapter, you will learn about how wide-area network (WAN) standards and protocols 
also implement OSI Layers 1 and 2. The OSI physical layer details are covered, along 
with two popular WAN data link layer protocols, High-Level Data Link Control 
(HDLC) and Frame Relay. 
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The ten-question quiz, derived from the major sections in “Foundation Topics” portion 
of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.
Table 4-1 outlines the major topics discussed in this chapter and the “Do I Know This

OSI Layer 1 for Point-to-Point WANs     81
Foundation Topics
As you read in the previous chapter, the OSI physical and data link layers work together to 
deliver data across a wide variety of types of physical networks. LAN standards and 
protocols deﬁne how to network between devices that are relatively close together—hence 
the term local in the acronym LAN. WAN standards and protocols deﬁne how to network 
between devices that are relatively far apart—in some cases, even thousands of miles apart—
hence the term wide-area in the acronym WAN.
LANs and WANs both implement the details of OSI Layers 1 and 2. Some details are 
different, but many of the concepts are the same. In this chapter, because you just ﬁnished 
reading about LANs, I will compare WANs to LANs whenever possible, to point out the 
similarities and differences.
In the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, you will read more about the details of 
WANs, including the conﬁguration details on Cisco routers. 
OSI Layer 1 for Point-to-Point WANs
The OSI physical layer, or Layer 1, deﬁnes the details of how to move data from one device 
to another. In fact, many people think of OSI Layer 1 as “sending bits.” Higher layers 
encapsulate the data, as described in Chapter 2, “The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models.” 
No matter what the other OSI layers do, eventually the sender of the data needs to actually 
transmit the bits to another device. The OSI physical layer deﬁnes the standards and 
protocols used to create the physical network and to send the bits across that network.
A point-to-point WAN link acts like a trunk between two Ethernet switches in many ways. 
For perspective, look at Figure 4-1, which shows a LAN with two buildings and two switches 
in each building.
As a brief review, remember that Ethernet uses a twisted pair of wires to transmit and another 
twisted pair to receive, to reduce electromagnetic interference. You typically use straight-
through Ethernet cables between end user devices and the switches. For the trunk links 
between the switches, you use crossover cables because each switch transmits on the same 
pair, so the crossover cable connects one device’s transmit pair to the other device’s receive 
pair. The lower part of the ﬁgure reminds you of the basic idea behind a crossover cable.

82     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
Figure 4-1
Example LAN, Two Buildings
Now imagine that the buildings are 1000 miles apart instead of right next to each other. You 
are immediately faced with two problems:
■
Ethernet does not support any type of cabling that allows an individual trunk to run for 
1000 miles.
■
Even if Ethernet supported a 1000-mile trunk, you do not have the rights of way needed 
to bury a cable over the 1000 miles of real estate between buildings.
The big distinction between LANs and WANs relates to how far apart the devices can be and 
still be capable of sending and receiving data. LANs tend to reside in a single building or 
possibly among buildings in a campus using optical cabling approved for Ethernet. WAN 
connections typically run longer distances than Ethernet, across town or between cities. 
Often, only one or a few companies even have the rights to run cables under the ground 
between the sites. So, the people who created WAN standards needed to use different 
physical speciﬁcations than Ethernet to send data 1000 km or more (WAN).
To create such long links, or circuits, the actual physical cabling is owned, installed, and 
managed by a company that has the right of way to run cables under streets. Because a 
company that needs to send data over the WAN circuit does not actually own the cable or 
line, it is called a leased line. Companies that can provide leased WAN lines typically started 
NOTE
Besides LANs and WANs, the term metropolitan-area network (MAN) is 
sometimes used for networks that extend between buildings and through rights-of-ways. 
The term typically implies a network that does not reach as far as a WAN, generally in a 
sinle metropolitan area. The distinctions between LANs, MANs, and WANs are blurry—
there is no set distance that means a link is a LAN, MAN, or WAN link.

life as the local telephone company, or telco. In many countries, the telco is still a 
government-regulated or government-controlled monopoly; these companies are sometimes 
called public telephone and telegraph (PTT) companies. Today many people use the generic 
term service provider to refer to a company that provides any form of WAN connectivity, 
including Internet services.  
Point-to-point WAN links provide basic connectivity between two points. To get a point-to-
point WAN link, you would work with a service provider to install a circuit. What the phone 
company or service provider gives you is similar to what you would have if you made a 
phone call between two sites but you never hung up. The two devices on either end of the 
WAN circuit could send and receive bits between each other any time they want, without 
needing to dial a phone number. And because the connection is always available, a point-to-
point WAN connection sometimes is called a leased circuit or leased line because you have 
the exclusive right to use that circuit, as long as you keep paying for it.
Now back to the comparison of the LAN between two nearby buildings versus the two 
buildings that are 1000 miles apart. The physical details are different, but the same general 
functions need to be accomplished, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2
Conceptual View of Point-to-Point Leased Line
Keep in mind that Figure 4-2 provides a conceptual view of a point-to-point WAN link. In 
concept, the telco installs a physical cable, with a transmit and a receive twisted pair, between 
the buildings. The cable has been connected to each router, and each router, in turn, has been 
connected to the LAN switches. As a result of this new physical WAN link and the logic used 
by the routers connected to it, data now can be transferred between the two sites. In practice, 
the telco does not actually run a cable between the two buildings. In the next section, you 
will learn more about the physical details of the WAN link.
NOTE
Ethernet switches have many different types of interfaces, but all the interfaces are 
some form of Ethernet. Routers provide the capability to connect many different types of 
OSI Layer 1 and 2 technologies. So, when you see a LAN connected to some other site 
using a WAN connection, you will see a router connected to each, as in Figure 4-2.

84     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
WAN Connections from the Customer Viewpoint
The concepts behind a point-to-point connection are simple. However, to fully understand 
what the service provider does to build his network to support your point-to-point line, you 
would need to spend lots of time studying and learning. However, most of what you need to 
know about WANs for the INTRO exam relates to how WAN connections are implemented 
between the telephone company and a customer site. Along the way, you will need to learn 
a little about the terminology used by the provider. 
In Figure 4-2, you saw that a WAN leased line acts as if the telco gave you two twisted pairs 
of wires between the two sites on each end of the line. Well, it’s not that simple. Of course, 
a lot more underlying technology must be used to create the circuit, and telcos use a lot of 
terminology that is different from LAN terminology. The telco seldom actually runs a 1000-
mile cable for you between the two sites. Instead, it has built a large network already and 
even runs extra cables from the local central ofﬁce (CO) to your building. (A CO is just a 
building where the telco locates the devices used to create its own network.) However the 
telco works out the details, what you receive is the equivalent of a four-wire leased circuit 
between two buildings. 
Figure 4-3 introduces some of those key concepts and terms relating to WAN circuits.
Figure 4-3
Point-to-Point Leased Line: Components and Terminology
Typically, routers connect to a device called an external channel service unit/digital service 
unit (CSU/DSU). The router connects to the CSU/DSU with a relatively short cable, typically 
less than 50 feet, because the CSU/DSUs typically get placed in a rack near the router. The 
much longer four-wire cable from the telco plugs into the CSU/DSU. That cable leaves the 
building, running through the hidden (typically buried) cables that you always see phone 
company workers ﬁxing by the side of the road. The other end of that cable ends up in

something called a central ofﬁce (CO), which is simply a building where the phone company 
puts its equipment. The actual physical line terminates in a device generically called a WAN 
switch, of which there are many types.
The same general physical connectivity exists on each side of the point-to-point WAN link. 
In between the two COs, the service provider can build its network with several competing 
different types of technology, all of which is beyond the scope of either CCNA exam. 
However, the perspective in Figure 4-2 remains true—the two routers can send and receive 
data simultaneously across the point-to-point WAN link.
From a legal perspective, two different companies own the various components of the 
equipment and lines in Figure 4-3. For instance, the router cable and typically the CSU/DSU 
are owned by one company, and the wiring to the CO and the gear inside the CO are owned 
by the telco. So, the telco uses the term demarc, which is short for demarcation point, to refer 
to the point at which the telco’s responsibility is on one side and the customer’s responsibility 
is on the other. The demarc is not a separate device or cable, but instead a concept of where 
each company’s responsibilities end. 
In the United States, the demarc is typically where the telco physically terminates the set of 
two twisted pairs inside the customer building. Typically, the customer asks the telco to 
terminate the cable in a particular room, and most, if not all, the lines from the telco into 
that building terminate in the same room. 
The term customer premises equipment (CPE) refers to devices that are at the customer site, 
from the telco’s perspective. For instance, both the CSU/DSU and the router are CPE devices 
in this case. 
The demarc does not always reside between the telco and all CPE. In some cases, the telco 
actually could own the CSU/DSU, and the demarc would be on the router side of the CSU/
DSU. In some cases today, the telco even owns and manages the router at the customer site, 
again moving the point that would be considered the demarc. Regardless of where the 
demarc sits from a legal perspective, the term CPE still refers to the equipment at the telco 
customer’s location. 
WAN Cabling Standards
Cisco offers a large variety of different WAN interface cards for its routers, including 
synchronous and asynchronous serial interfaces. For any of the point-to-point serial links or 
Frame Relay links in this chapter, the router uses an interface that supports synchronous 
communication.  

86     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
Synchronous serial interfaces in Cisco routers use a variety of proprietary physcial connector 
types, such as the 60-pin D-shell connector shown in Figure 4-4. The cable connecting the 
router to the CSU uses a connector that ﬁts the router serial interface on the router side, and 
a standardized WAN connector type that matches the CSU/DSU interface on the CSU/DSU 
end of the cable. Figure 4-4 shows a typical connection, with some of the serial cabling 
options listed.
Figure 4-4
Serial Cabling Options
The engineer who deploys a network chooses the cable based on the connectors on the router 
and the CSU/DSU. Beyond that choice, engineers do not really need to think about how the 
cabling and pins work—they just work! Many of the pins are used for control functions, and 
a few are used for the transmission of data. Some pins are used for clocking, as described in 
the next section. Table 4-2 summarizes the variety of standards that deﬁne the types of 
connectors and physical signaling protocols used on WAN interfaces.

These cables provide connectivity to the external DSU/CSU, as shown in Figure 4-4. The 
cable between the CSU/DSU and the telco CO typically uses an RJ-48 connector to connect 
to the CSU/DSU; the RJ-48 connector has the same size and shape as the RJ-45 connector 
used for Ethernet cables. 
The cables and physical connector types each have differing limits on the speed of serial data 
transmission. Generally, the shorter the length of the cable is, the closer it can get to the 
maximum speed allowed for that cable and connector. From a practical perspective, this just 
means that you typically locate the CSU/DSU relatively close to the routers so that the cables 
can be kept short. Table 4-3 lists the speeds that can be used for certain cables and 
connectors, based on the lengths of the cables.
Many Cisco routers support serial interfaces that have an integrated DSU/CSU. With an 
internal CSU/DSU, the router does not need a cable connecting it to the CSU/DSU because 
the CSU/DSU is internal to the router. The line from the telco is connected to a receptacle on 
the router, typically an RJ-48 receptacle, in the router serial interface card.

Clock Rates, DCE, and DTE
When a network engineer needs to add a point-to-point leased line between two routers, he 
contacts a service provider and orders the circuit. As part of that process, the customer speciﬁes 
how fast the circuit should run, in kilobits per second (kbps). While the circuit is being set up by 
the telco, the engineer purchases two CSU/DSUs, installs one at each site, and conﬁgures each 
CSU/DSU. He also cables each router to the respective CSU/DSU using the cables shown in the 
previous section. Eventually, the telco installs the new line into the customer premises, and the 
line can be connected to the CSU/DSUs, as shown in Figure 4-3. (Note: In some countries, the 
telco owns the CSU/DSU, so it orders, installs, and conﬁgures the CSU/DSUs.)
The terms clock rate and bandwidth both refer to the speed of the circuit. You will also hear 
the speed referred to as the link speed. When you order a circuit that runs at a particular 
speed, the two CSU/DSUs are conﬁgured to operate at that same speed. The CSU/DSUs 
provide a clocking signal to the routers so that the routers simply react, sending and receiving 
data at the correct rate. So, the CSU/DSU is considered to be clocking the link.
A couple of other key WAN terms relate to the process of clocking. The device that provides 
clocking, typically the CSU, is considered to be the data communications equipment (DCE). The 
device receiving clocking, typically the router, is referred to as data terminal equipment (DTE). 
On a practical note, when purchasing serial cables from Cisco, you can pick either a DTE 
or a DCE cable. You pick the type of cable based on whether the router is acting like a DTE or a 
DCE. If the router is a DTE, with the CSU providing the clocking, you need a DTE cable. If 
the router was clocking the CSU/DSU, which can be done, you would need a DCE cable—
but that almost never happens. 
However, DCE cables do have an important practical use. When building a lab to study for 
any of the Cisco exams, you do not need to buy DSU/CSUs. You can buy two routers, a DTE 
serial cable for one router, and a DCE serial cable for the other and connect the two cables 
together. The router with the DCE cable in it can be conﬁgured to provide clocking—
meaning that you do not need a CSU/DSU. So, you can build a WAN in your home lab, 
saving hundreds of dollars by not buying CSU/DSUs. The DTE and DCE cables can be 
connected to each other and to the two routers. (The DCE cable has a female connector, and 
the DTE has a male connector, so they can be connected.) With one additional conﬁguration 
command on one of the routers (the clock rate command), you have a point-to-point serial 
link. This type of connection between two routers sometimes is called a back-to-back serial 
connection.

OSI Layer 1 for Point-to-Point WANs     89
Figure 4-5 shows the cabling for a back-to-back serial connection and also shows that the 
combined DCE/DTE cables reverse the transmit and receive pins, much like a crossover 
Ethernet cable allows two directly connected devices to communicate.
Figure 4-5
Serial Cabling Uses a DTE and a DCE Cable
As you see in the ﬁgure, the DTE cable, the same cable that you typically use to connect to a 
CSU/DSU, does not swap the Tx and Rx pins. The DCE cable swaps transmit and receive, 
so the wiring with one router’s Tx pin connected to the other router’s Rx, and vice versa, 
remains intact.
Link Speeds Offered by Telcos
No mater what you call them—telcos, PTTs, service providers—these companies do not 
simply let you pick the exact speed of a WAN link. Instead, standards deﬁne how fast a point-
to-point link can run.
For a long time, the telcos of the world made more money selling voice services. That is no 
longer the case for any of these companies in the United States, except for the companies that 
provide local residential telephone service. So, years ago, the telcos of the world developed a 
standard for sending voice using digital transmissions. Digital signaling inside their networks 
allowed for the growth of more proﬁtable data services, such as leased lines. It also allowed 
better efﬁciencies, making the build-out of the expanding voice networks much less 
expensive.
The original standard for converting analog voice to a digital signal is called pulse code 
modulation (PCM). (There are alternatives, but for the exam, you should just be aware of 
PCM.) PCM deﬁnes that an incoming analog voice signal should be sampled 8000 times per 
second, and each sample should be represented by an 8-bit code. So, 64,000 bits were needed 
to represent 1 second of voice.

90     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
When the telcos of the world built their ﬁrst digital networks, the baseline transmission speed 
was 64 kbps because that was the necessary bandwidth for a single voice call. The term 
digital signal level 0 (DS0) refers to the standard for a single 64-kbps line.
Later the telcos starting selling data services—in other words, leased lines. The phone 
companies could sell a DS0 service at 64 kbps. However, when it ﬁrst came out, they typically 
offered 56-kbps service. Why? Well, it turned out that the telcos needed some bits for some 
management overhead. They found that if they used a bit inside the actual DS0 channel 
occasionally, the voice quality did not suffer, so they deﬁned a standard in which a switch 
regularly could use one of every 8 bits in the DS0 channel for its own purposes. That worked 
ﬁne for voice. But for data, having something else in the telco network change the bits that 
you sent does not work very well. At best, it can cause retransmissions; at worst, it doesn’t 
work. So, the telco decided to just sell 7 of every 8 bits that could be sent over a DS0—and 
7/8 of 64 kbps is 56 kbps. Today many telcos do not use that bit, so they can offer the full 
64-kbps channel.
The telco offers speciﬁc increments of the DS0 channel. In the United States, the digital signal 
level 1 (DS1) standard deﬁnes a single line that supports 24 DS0s, plus an 8-kbps overhead 
channel, for a speed of 1.544 Mbps. (A DS1 is also called a T1 line.) It also deﬁnes a digital 
signal level 3 (DS3) service, also called a T3 line, which holds 28 DS1s. Other parts of the 
world use different standards, with Europe and Japan using standards that hold 32 DS0s; 
this type of line often is called an E1.
Table 4-4 lists some of the standards for WAN speeds. Included in the table are the type of 
line, plus the type of signaling (for example, DS1). The signaling speciﬁcations deﬁne the 
electrical signals that encode a binary 1 or 0 on the line. You should be aware of the general 
idea, and remember the key terms for T1 and E1 lines in particular, for the INTRO exam.

OSI Layer 2 for Point-to-Point WANs     91
Later in the chapter, the text explains the Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) 
standards, which include yet another range of types of WAN lines and speeds.
OSI Layer 2 for Point-to-Point WANs
WAN protocols used on point-to-point serial links provide the basic function of data delivery 
across that one link. The two most popular data-link protocols used on point-to-point links 
are High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). You should 
also remember the names of some other serial data-link protocols.
HDLC
HDLC performs OSI Layer 2 functions, so a brief review of the OSI Layer 2 functions 
covered in Chapter 3, “Data Link Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs,” will be helpful:
■
Arbitration—Determines when it is appropriate to use the physical medium
■
Addressing—Ensures that the correct recipient(s) receives and processes the data that is 
sent
■
Error detection—Determines whether the data made the trip across the physical medium 
successfully
■
Identifying the encapsulated data—Determines the type of header that follows the data-
link header 
HDLC is very simple as compared with Ethernet. For instance, with Ethernet, the CSMA/CD 
algorithm arbitrates which device gets to send a frame next and how to recover when frames 
collide. In a point-to-point serial link, each router can send over the four-wire (two-pair) 
circuit at any time, so there is no need for any kind of arbitration.
HDLC deﬁnes framing that includes an address ﬁeld, a frame check sequence (FCS) ﬁeld, and 
a protocol type ﬁeld. These three ﬁelds in the HDLC frame help provide the other three 
functions of the data link layer. Figure 4-6 outlines the framing.
Figure 4-6
HDLC Framing
HDLC deﬁnes a 1-byte address ﬁeld, although on point-to-point links, it is not really needed. 
Having an address ﬁeld in HDLC is sort of like when I have lunch with my friend Gary, and 
only Gary. I don’t need to start every sentence with “Hey Gary…”—he knows I’m talking to 
him. On point-to-point WAN links, the router on one end of the link knows that there is only 
one possible recipient of the data —the router on the other end of the link—so the address 
does not really matter.

92     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
Historically, HDLC includes an address ﬁeld because, in years past, the telco would sell you 
a multidrop circuit. With a multidrop circuit, one central site device could send and receive 
frames with multiple remote sites. HDLC deﬁned the address ﬁeld to identify the different 
remote sites on a multidrop link. Because routers use HDLC only for point-to-point links, 
the address ﬁeld really is not needed to identify the other router. However, because the 
address ﬁeld still is deﬁned by HDLC, it is included in the header by routers. By the way, 
routers put the decimal value of 3 in the address ﬁeld.
HDLC performs error detection just like Ethernet—it uses an FCS ﬁeld in the HDLC trailer. 
And just like Ethernet, if a received frame has errors in it, the frame is discarded, with no 
error recovery performed by HDLC.
HDLC performs the function of identifying the encapsulated data just like Ethernet as well. 
When a router receives an HDLC frame, it wants to know what type of packet is held inside 
the frame. Cisco’s implementation of HDLC includes a Protocol Type ﬁeld, as seen in Figure 
4-6, that identiﬁes the type of packet inside the frame. Cisco uses the same values in its 2-
byte HDLC Protocol Type ﬁeld as it does in the Ethernet Protocol Type ﬁeld. 
The original HDLC standards did not include a Protocol Type ﬁeld, so Cisco added one; by 
adding something to the HDLC header, Cisco made its version of HDLC proprietary. So, 
Cisco’s HDLC will not work when connecting a Cisco router to another vendor’s router. 
Figure 4-6 does not show the Cisco proprietary protocol type ﬁeld; it sits between the control 
ﬁeld and the data ﬁeld in the frame.
HDLC is very simple. There simply is not a lot of work for the point-to-point data link 
protocols to perform.
Point-to-Point Protocol
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), then known as the Consultative 
Committee for International Telecommunications Technologies (CCITT), ﬁrst deﬁned 
HDLC. Later, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) saw the need for another data-link 
protocol for use between routers over a point-to-point link. In RFC 1661, the IETF created 
the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
Comparing the basics, PPP behaves exactly like HDLC. The framing looks identical. There 
is an address ﬁeld, but the addressing does not matter. PPP does discard errored frames that 
do not pass the FCS check. And PPP uses a 2-byte Protocol Type ﬁeld—although PPP’s Protocol 
Type ﬁeld is deﬁned by the protocol, as opposed to being a Cisco proprietary feature added later.
PPP was deﬁned much later than the original HDLC speciﬁcations. As a result, the creators 
of PPP included many additional features that had not been seen in WAN data-link protocols 
up to that time. As a result, PPP has become the most popular and feature-rich of WAN data 
link layer protocols.

OSI Layer 2 for Point-to-Point WANs     93
PPP-unique features fall into two main categories: 
■
Those needed regardless of the Layer 3 protocol sent across the link 
■
Those speciﬁc to each Layer 3 protocol 
So, the PPP speciﬁcations actually include several different protocols. One protocol, the PPP 
Link Control Protocol (LCP), focuses on the features that apply regardless of the Layer 3 
protocol used. LCP performs most of its work when the line comes up, so it has a lot more 
work to do with dialed links, which come up and down a lot, versus leased lines, which 
hopefully seldom fail. 
PPP also deﬁnes several control protocols (CPs), which are used for any special purposes for 
a particular Layer 3 protocol. For instance, the IP Control Protocol (IPCP) provides for IP 
address assignment over a PPP link. When a user dials a new connection to an ISP using a 
modem, PPP typically is used, with IPCP assigning an IP address to the remote PC. 
Each link that uses PPP has one LCP per link and one CP for each Layer 3 protocol deﬁned 
on the link. If a router is conﬁgured for IPX, AppleTalk, and IP on a PPP serial link, the router 
conﬁgured for PPP encapsulation automatically tries to bring up the appropriate control 
protocols for each Layer 3 protocol.
LCP provides a variety of optional features for PPP besides just managing the link. You 
should at least be aware of the concepts behind these features, as summarized in Table 4-5.

This allows multiple parallel serial links to be

Particularly useful for dial-up links, PPP initiates an 
authentication process to verify the identity of the 
device on the other end of the serial link.

94     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
Other Point-to-Point WAN Data-Link Protocols
WAN data-link protocols can be compared relative to two main attributes. First, some 
protocols do support multiprotocol trafﬁc by virtue of having a deﬁned protocol type ﬁeld. 
Also, some protocols actually perform error recovery—so when the receiving end notices 
that the received frame did not pass the FCS check, it causes the frame to be resent. Protocols 
that were developed more recently tend to have a protocol type ﬁeld and do not perform 
error recovery. Instead, they expect a higher-layer protocol to perform recovery. Table 4-6 
lists the protocols, with comments about each.
*Cisco’s implementation of LAPB and HDLC includes a proprietary Protocol Type ﬁeld. 
Synchronization
One additional feature of HDLC and PPP not mentioned so far is that they are both 
synchronous. Synchronous simply means that there is an imposed time ordering at the link’s 
sending and receiving ends. Essentially, the sides agree to a certain speed, but it is expensive 
to build devices that truly can operate at exactly the same speed. So, the devices operate at 
close to the same speed and listen to the speed of the other device on the other side of the 
link. One side makes small adjustments in its rate to match the other side.
Synchronization occurs by having one CSU (the slave) adjust its clock to match the clock rate 
of the other CSU (the master). The process works almost like the scenes in spy novels in

which the spies synchronize their watches; in this case, the watches or clocks are

Point-to-Point WAN Summary
Point-to-point WAN leased lines and their associated data-link protocols use another set of 
terms and concepts beyond those covered for LANs. Table 4-7 lists the terms.
Packet-Switching Services 
So far, this chapter has covered technologies related to a permanent point-to-point leased 
line. Service providers also offer services that can be categorized as packet-switching services. 
In a packet-switched service, physical WAN connectivity exists, similar to a leased line. 
However, the devices connected to a packet-switched service can communicate directly with 
each other, using a single connection to the service.
Table 4-7
WAN Terminology
Term
Deﬁnition 
Synchronous
The imposition of time ordering on a bit stream. Practically, a device tries 
to use the same speed as another device on the other end of a serial link. 
However, by examining transitions between voltage states on the link, the 
device can notice slight variations in the speed on each end and can adjust 
its speed accordingly.
Asynchronous
The lack of an imposed time ordering on a bit stream. Practically, both 
sides agree to the same speed, but there is no check or adjustment of the 
rates if they are slightly different. However, because only 1 byte per 
transfer is sent, slight differences in clock speed are not an issue. A start bit 
is used to signal the beginning of a byte.
Clock source
The device to which the other devices on the link adjust their speed when 
using synchronous links.
DSU/CSU
Data service unit/channel service unit. Used on digital links as an interface 
to the telephone company in the United States. Routers typically use a 
short cable from a serial interface to a DSU/CSU, which is attached to the 
line from the telco with a similar conﬁguration at the other router on the 
other end of the link. 
Telco
Telephone company.
Four-wire circuit
A line from the telco with four wires, comprised of two twisted-pair wires. 
Each pair is used to send in one direction, so a four-wire circuit allows full-
duplex communication.
T1
A line from the telco that allows transmission of data at 1.544 Mbps. 
E1
Similar to a T1, but used in Europe. It uses a rate of 2.048 Mbps and 32 
64-kbps channels.

96     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
Two types of packet-switching service are very popular today—Frame Relay and ATM. Both 
are covered in this chapter. At the end of the chapter, a summary section compares these types 
of networks with other types of WAN connectivity.
Frame Relay
Point-to-point WANs can be used to connect a pair of routers at multiple remote sites. 
However, an alternative WAN service, Frame Relay, has many advantages over point-to-
point links, particularly when you connect many sites via a WAN. To introduce you to Frame 
Relay, I focus on a few of the key beneﬁts compared to leased lines. One of the beneﬁts is 
seen easily by considering Figures 4-7.
Figure 4-7
Two Leased Lines to Two Branch Ofﬁces
In Figure 4-7, a main site is connected to two branch ofﬁces, labeled BO1 and BO2. The main 
site router, R1, requires two serial interfaces and two separate CSUs. But what happens when 
the company grows to 10 sites? Or 100 sites? Or 500 sites? For each point-to-point line, R1 
needs a separate physical serial interface and a separate CSU/DSU. As you can imagine, 
growth to hundreds of sites will take many routers, with many interfaces each and lots of 
rack space for the routers and CSU/DSUs.
Now imagine that the phone company salesperson talks to you when you have two leased 
lines, or circuits, installed as in Figure 4-7: “You know, we can install Frame Relay instead. 
You will need only one serial interface on R1 and one CSU/DSU. To scale to 100 sites, you 
might need two or three more serial interaces on R1 for more bandwidth, but that’s it. And 
by the way, because your leased lines run at 128 kbps today, we’ll guarantee that you can 
send and receive that much to and from each site. We will upgrade the line at R1 to T1 speed 
(1.544 Mbps). When you have more trafﬁc than 128 kbps to a site, go ahead and send it! If 
we’ve got capacity, we’ll forward it, with no extra charge. And by the way, did I tell you that 
it’s cheaper than leased lines anyway?”
You consider the facts for a moment: Frame Relay is cheaper, it’s at least as fast (probably 
faster) than what you have now, and it allows you to save money when you grow. So, you 
quickly sign the contract with the Frame Relay provider, before the salesman can change his 
mind, and migrate to Frame Relay. Does this story seem a bit ridiculous? Sure. But Frame 
Relay does compare very favorably with leased lines in a network with many remote sites. In

the next few pages, you will see how Frame Relay works and realize how Frame Relay can 
provide functions claimed by the ﬁctitous salesman.
Frame Relay Basics
Frame Relay networks provide more features and beneﬁts than simple point-to-point WAN 
links, but to do that, Frame Relay protocols are more detailed. Frame Relay networks are 
multiaccess networks, which means that more than two devices can attach to the network, 
similar to LANs. To support more than two devices, the protocols must be a little more 
detailed.
Figure 4-8 introduces some basic connectivity concepts for Frame Relay.
Figure 4-8
Frame Relay Components
Figure 4-8 reﬂects the fact that Frame Relay uses the same Layer 1 features as a point-to-
point leased line. For a Frame Relay services, a leased line is installed between each router 
and a nearby Frame Relay switch; these links are called access links. The access links run the 
same speeds and use the same signaling standards as do point-to-point leased lines. However, 
instead of extending from one router to the other, each leased line runs from one router to a 
Frame Relay switch.
The difference between Frame Relay and point-to-point links is that the equipment in the 
telco actually examines the data frames sent by the router. Each frame header holds an 
address ﬁeld called a data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI). The WAN switch forwards the 
frame, based on the DLCI, through the provider’s network until it gets to the router on the 
other side of the network. 
Because the equipment in the telco can forward one frame to one remote site and another 
frame to another remote site, Frame Relay is considered to be a form of packet switching. 
However, Frame Relay protocols most closely resemble OSI Layer 2 protocols; the term 
usually used for the bits sent by a Layer 2 device is frame. So, Frame Relay is also called a 
frame-switching service.

98     Chapter 4: Fundamentals of WANs
The terms DCE and DTE actually have a second set of meanings in the context of any 
packet-switching or frame-switching service. With Frame Relay, the Frame Relay switches 
are called DCE, and the customer equipment—routers, in this case—are called DTE. In this 
case, DCE refers to the device providing the service, and the term DTE refers to the device 
needing the frame-switching service. At the same time, the CSU/DSU provides clocking to the 
router, so from a Layer 1 perspective, the CSU/DSU is still the DCE and the router is still the 
DTE. It’s just two different uses of the same terms.
Figure 4-8 depicts the physical and logical connectivity at each connection to the Frame 
Relay network. In contrast, Figure 4-9 shows the end-to-end connectivity associated with a 
virtual circuit.
Figure 4-9
Frame Relay PVC Concepts
The logical path between each pair of routers is called a Frame Relay virtual circuit (VC). In 
Figure 4-9, a single VC is represented by the trio of parallel lines. Typically, the service 
provider preconﬁgures all the required details of a VC; these VCs are called permanent 
virtual circuits (PVCs). When R1 needs to forward a packet to R2, it encapsulates the Layer 
3 packet into a Frame Relay header and trailer and then sends the frame. R1 uses a Frame 
Relay address called a DLCI in the Frame Relay header. This allows the switches to deliver 
the frame to R2, ignoring the details of the Layer 3 packet and caring to look at only the 
Frame Relay header and trailer. Just like on a point-to-point serial link, when the service 
provider forwards the frame over a physical circuit between R1 and R2, with Frame Relay, 
the provider forwards the frame over a logical virtual circuit from R1 to R2.
Frame Relay provides signiﬁcant advantages over simply using point-to-point leased lines. 
The primary advantage has to do with virtual circuits. Consider Figure 4-10 with Frame 
Relay instead of three point-to-point leased lines.
Frame Relay creates a logical path between two Frame Relay DTEs. That logical path is 
called a VC, which describes the concept well. A VC acts like a point-to-point circuit, but 
physically it is not, so it’s virtual. For example, R1 terminates two VCs—one whose other 
endpoint is R2 and one whose other endpoint is R3. R1 can send trafﬁc directly to either of 
the other two routers by sending it over the appropriate VC, although R1 has only one 
physical access link to the Frame Relay network.

Figure 4-10
Typical Frame Relay Network with Three Sites
VCs share the access link and the Frame Relay network. For example, both VCs terminating 
at R1 use the same access link. So, with large networks with many WAN sites that need to 
connect to a central location, only one physical access link is required from the main site 
router to the Frame Relay network. If point-to-point links were used, a physical circuit, a 
separate CSU/DSU, and a separate physical interface on the router would be required for 
each point-to-point link. So, Frame Relay enables you to expand the WAN but add less 
hardware to do so. 
Many customers of a single Frame Relay service provider share that provider’s Frame Relay 
network. Originally, people with leased-line networks were reluctant to migrate to Frame 
Relay because they would be competing with other customers for the provider’s capacity 
inside the cloud. To address these fears, Frame Relay is designed with the concept of a 
committed information rate (CIR). Each VC has a CIR, which is a guarantee by the provider 
that a particular VC gets at least that much bandwidth. You can think of CIR of a VC like 
the bandwidth or clock rate of a point-to-point circuit, except that it’s the minimum value—
you can actually send more, in most cases.
It’s interesting that, even in this three-site network, it’s probably less expensive to use Frame 
Relay than to use point-to-point links. Now imagine an organization with a hundred sites 
that needs any-to-any connectivity. How many leased lines are required? 4950! Besides that, 
you would need 99 serial interfaces per router. Or, you could have 100 access links to local 
Frame Relay switches—1 per router—and have 4950 VCs running over them. Also, you 
would need only one serial interface on each router. As a result, the Frame Relay topology is 
easier for the service provider to implement, costs the provider less, and makes better use of

the core of the provider’s network. As you would expect, that makes it less expensive to the 
Frame Relay customer as well. For connecting many WAN sites, Frame Relay is simply more 
cost-effective than leased lines.
ATM and SONET
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) together 
provide the capability for a telco to provide high-speed services for both voice and data over 
the same network. SONET deﬁnes a method for transmitting digital data at high speeds over 
optical cabling, and ATM deﬁnes how to frame the trafﬁc, how to address the trafﬁc so that 
DTE devices can communicate, and how to provide error detection. In short, SONET 
provides Layer 1 features, and ATM provides Layer 2 features over SONET. This short 
section introduces you to the basic concepts.
SONET
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) deﬁnes an alternative Layer 1 signaling and 
encoding mechanism, as compared with the line types listed in Table 4-4. The motivation 
behind SONET was to allow the phone companies of the world to connect their COs with 
high-speed optical links. SONET provides the Layer 1 details of how to pass high-speed data 
over optical links.
Optical cabling has ﬁberglass in the middle, with a light signal being sent over the ﬁber-
glass. Optical cabling is more expensive than copper wire cables, and the devices that 
generate the light that crosses the cables are also more expensive—but they allow very high 
speeds. 
During the same time frame of the development of SONET, the telcos of the world wanted 
a new protocol to support data and voice over the same core infrastructure. SONET was 
built to provide the Layer 1 high-speed links, and ATM was created to provide the capability 
to mix the voice and data. Both voice and data trafﬁc could be broken into cells; by using 
small ATM cells, the delay-sensitive voice trafﬁc could be interleaved with the data trafﬁc, 
without letting any congestion caused by the bursty nature of data get in the way of high-
quality voice.
Outside the United States, the term Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) represents the 
same standards as SONET. Also, the term optical carrier (OC) represents the preﬁx in the 
names for SONET links that use a variety of different link speeds. Table 4-8 lists the different 
speeds supported by SONET.

ATM
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) provides data link layer services that run over SONET 
Layer 1 links. ATM has a wide variety of applications, but its use as a WAN technology has 
many similarities to Frame Relay. When using ATM, routers connect to an ATM service via 
an access link to an ATM switch inside the service providers network. For multiple sites, each 
router would need a single access link to the ATM network, with a VC between sites as 
needed. ATM can use use permanent VCs (PVCs) like Frame Relay. In fact, the basic concepts 
between Frame Relay and ATM are identical.
Of course, there are differences between Frame Relay and ATM—otherwise, you wouldn’t 
need both! First, ATM relies on SONET for Layer 1 features instead of the traditional 
twisted-pair speciﬁcations such as T1 and DS0. The other big difference is that ATM does 
not forward frames—it forwards cells. Just like packets and frames refer to a string of bits 
that are sent over some network, cells are a string of bits sent over a network. Packets and 
frames can vary in size, but ATM cells are always a ﬁxed 53-bytes in length.
ATM cells contain 48 bytes of payload and a 5-byte header. The header contains two ﬁelds 
that together act like the DLCI for Frame Relay by identifying each VC. The two ﬁelds are 
named Virtual Path Identiﬁer (VPI) and Virtual Channel Identiﬁer (VCI). Just like Frame 
Relay switches forward frames based on the DLCI, devices called ATM switches, resident in 
the service provider network, forward cells based on the VPI/VCI pair.
The users of a network typically connect using Ethernet, and Ethernet devices do not create 
cells. So, how do you get trafﬁc off an Ethernet onto an ATM network? When a router 
receives a packet and decides to forward the packet over the ATM network, the router 
creates the cells. The creation process involves breaking up a data link layer frame into 48-
byte-long segments. Each segment is placed in a cell along with the 5-byte header. Figure 4-11 
shows the general idea, as performed on R2.

Figure 4-11
ATM Segmentation and Reassembly
As you will read more about in Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of IP,” routers forward IP packets, 
but they must add a data-link header and trailer to the packet before sending it. R2 takes the 
packet, adds a data-link header appropriate for ATM, and then also segments the frame into 
cells before sending any data. R2 takes the ﬁrst 48 bytes of the frame and puts them in the 
payload ﬁeld of a new cell. Next, it takes the next 48 bytes and puts them in another cell, 
and so on. The cell header includes the correct VPI/VCI pair so that the ATM switches in the 
ATM network know to forward the cells to R1.
R1 actually reverses the segmenation process after receiving all the cells—a process called 
reassembly. The entire concept of segmenting a frame into cells, and reassmebling them, is 
called segmentation and reassembly (SAR).
Cisco routers use specicalized ATM interfaces to support ATM. The ATM cards include 
special hardware to perform the SAR function quickly. They also often include specical 
hardware to support SONET.
Because of its similar function to Frame Relay, ATM also is considered to be a type of packet-
switching service. However, because it uses ﬁxed-length cells, it more often is called a cell-
switching service.
WAN Terminology Related to Packet Switching
You have already read about how both Frame Relay and ATM are considered to be packet-
switching services but how, more often, Frame Relay is called a frame-switching service and 
ATM is called a cell-switching service. Table 4-9 lists the key terms about WANs, plus a few 
related terms and a brief explanation.

Service in which each DTE device connects to a telco using a single

Frame switching
In concept, it is identical to packet switching. However, when the 
protocols match OSI Layer 2 more than any other layer, it is called frame 
switching. Frame Relay is a frame-switching technology.
Cell switching
In concept, it is identical to packet switching. However, because ATM 
DTEs break frames into small, ﬁxed-length cells, these services are also 
called cell switching. ATM is a cell-switching technology.
Circuit switching
A circuit is a point-to-point link between only two sites, much like a 
leased line. However, circuit switching refers to the process of dialing, 
setting up a circuit, and then hanging up—in other words, the circuit is 
switched on and off. Dialed lines using modems and ISDN, as covered in 
Chapter 15, are examples of circuit switching.

C H A P T E R 5
Fundamentals of IP
The OSI model assigns the functions of path selection and logical addressing to the OSI 
network layer (Layer 3). Path selection includes the process of learning all the paths, or 
routes, in a network and then forwarding packets based on those paths or routes. Often 
the terms path selection and routing are used interchangeably. In most Cisco 
documentation and in this book, routing is the more popular term.
In this chapter, you will learn about the core concepts behind OSI Layer 3. Because 
CCNA focuses on TCP/IP, you also will learn about the main Layer 3 protocol used by 
TCP/IP—namely, the Internet Protocol (IP). This coverage includes IP addressing, IP 
routing, and some protocols useful to IP’s effort to deliver packets end to end through a 
network.

114     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
Foundation Topics
OSI Layer 3–equivalent protocols use routing and addressing to accomplish their goals. The 
choices made by the people who made up addressing greatly affect how routing works, so 
the two topics are best described together.
This chapter begins with an overview of the functions of routing and network layer logical 
addressing. Following that, the text moves on to the basics of IP addressing, relating IP 
addressing to the OSI routing and addressing concepts covered in the ﬁrst section. The 
chapter ends with an introduction to IP routing protocols.
Typical Features of OSI Layer 3
A protocol that deﬁnes routing and addressing is considered to be a network layer, or Layer 3, 
protocol. OSI does deﬁne a unique Layer 3 protocol called Connectionless Network Services 
(CLNS), but, as usual with OSI protocols, you rarely see it in networks today. However, you 
will see many other protocols that perform the OSI Layer 3 functions of routing and 
addressing, such as the Internet Protocol (IP), Novell Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), 
or AppleTalk Dynamic Data Routing (DDR).
The network layer protocols have many similarities, regardless of what Layer 3 protocol is 
used. In this section, network layer (Layer 3) addressing is covered in enough depth to describe 
IP, IPX, and AppleTalk addresses. Also, now that data link layer and network layer addresses 
have been covered in this book, this section undertakes a comparison between the two.
Routing (Path Selection)
Routing focuses on the end-to-end logic of forwarding data. Figure 5-1 shows a simple 
example of how routing works. The logic seen in the ﬁgure is relatively simple. For PC1 to 
send data to PC2, it must send something to R1, when sends it to R2, then on to R3, and 
ﬁnally to PC2. However, the logic used by each device along the path varies slightly. 
PC1’s Logic: Sending Data to a Nearby Router
In this example, PC1 has some data to send data to PC2. Because PC2 is not on the same Ethernet 
as PC1, PC1 needs to send the packet to a router that is attached to the same Ethernet as PC1. The 
sender sends a data-link frame across the medium to the nearby router; this frame includes the 
packet in the data portion of the frame. That frame uses data link layer (Layer 2) addressing in the 
data-link header to ensure that the nearby router receives the frame. 

Typical Features of OSI Layer 3     115
Figure 5-1
Routing Logic: PC1 Sending to PC2
The main point here is that the originator of the data does not know much about the 
network—just how to get the data to some nearby router. In the post ofﬁce analogy, it’s like 
knowing how to get to the local post ofﬁce, but nothing more. Likewise, PC1 needs to know 
only how to get the packet to R1.
R1 and R2’s Logic: Routing Data Across the Network
R1 and R2 both use the same general process to route the packet. The routing table for any 
particular network layer protocol contains a list of network layer address groupings. Instead 
of a single entry in the routing table per individual destination address, there is one entry per 
group. The router compares the destination network layer address in the packet to the entries 
in the routing table, and a match is made. This matching entry in the routing table tells this 
router where to forward the packet next. The words in the bubbles in Figure 5-1 point out 
this basic logic.

116     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
The concept of network layer address grouping is similar to the U.S. ZIP code system. 
Everyone living in the same vicinity is in the same ZIP code, and the postal sorters just look 
for the ZIP codes, ignoring the rest of the address. Likewise, in Figure 5-1, everyone in this 
network whose IP address starts with 168.1 is on the Token Ring on which PC2 resides, so 
the routers can just have one routing table entry that means “all addresses that start with 
168.1.”
Any intervening routers repeat the same process. The destination network layer (Layer 3) 
address in the packet identiﬁes the group in which the destination resides. The routing table 
is searched for a matching entry, which tells this router where to forward the packet next. 
Eventually, the packet is delivered to the router connected to the network or subnet of the 
destination host (R3), as previously shown in Figure 5-1.
R3’s Logic: Delivering Data to the End Destination
The ﬁnal router in the path, R3, uses almost the exact same logic as R1 and R2, but with one 
minor difference. R3 needs to forward the packet directly to PC2, not to some other router. 
On the surface, that difference seems insigniﬁcant. In the next section, when you read about 
how the network layer uses the data link layer, the signiﬁcance of the difference will become 
obvious. 
Network Layer Interaction with the Data Link Layer
In Figure 5-1, four different types of data links were used to deliver the data. When the 
network layer protocol is processing the packet, it decides to send the packet out the 
appropriate network interface. Before the actual bits can be placed onto that physical 
interface, the network layer must hand off the packet to the data link layer protocols, which, 
in turn, ask the physical layer to actually send the data. And as was described in Chapter 3, 
“Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” the data link layer adds the appropriate header and 
trailer to the packet, creating a frame, before sending the frames over each physical network.
The routing process forwards the packet, and only the packet, from end-to-end through the 
network, discarding data link headers and trailers along the way. The network layer 
processes deliver the packet end-to-end, using successive data-link headers and trailers just 
to get the packet to the next router or host in the path. Each successive data link layer just 
gets the packet from one device to the next. Figure 5-2 shows the same diagram as Figure 5-
1 but includes the concepts behind encapsulation.

Typical Features of OSI Layer 3     117
Figure 5-2
Network Layer and Data Link Layer Encapsulation
Because the routers build new data-link headers and trailers (trailers not shown in ﬁgure),and 
because the new headers contain data-link addresses, the PCs and routers must have some 
way to decide what data-link addresses to use. An example of how the router determines 
which data-link address to use is the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). ARP is used to 
dynamically learn the data-link address of an IP host connected to a LAN. You will read 
more about ARP later in this chapter.
In short, the process of routing forwards Layer 3 packets, also called Layer 3 protocol data 
units (L3 PDUs), based on the destination Layer 3 address in the packet. The process uses 
the data link layer to encapsulate the Layer 3 packets into Layer 2 frames for transmission 
across each successive data link.

118     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
Network Layer (Layer 3) Addressing
One key feature of network layer addresses is that they were designed to allow logical 
grouping of addresses. In other words, something about the numeric value of an address 
implies a group or set of addresses, all of which are considered to be in the same grouping. 
In TCP/IP, this group is called a network or a subnet. In IPX, it is called a network. In 
AppleTalk, the grouping is called a cable range. These groupings work just like U.S.P.S. ZIP 
codes, allowing the routers (mail sorters) to speedily route (sort) lots of packets (letters).
Just like postal street addresses, network layer addresses are grouped based on physical 
location in a network. The rules differ for some network layer protocols, but the grouping 
concept is identical for IP, IPX, and AppleTalk. In each of these network layer protocols, all 
devices on opposite sides of a router must be in a different Layer 3 group, just like in the 
examples earlier in this chapter.
Routing relies on the fact that Layer 3 addresses are grouped together. The routing tables for 
each network layer protocol can have one entry for the group, not one entry for each 
individual address. Imagine an Ethernet with 100 TCP/IP hosts. A router needing to forward 
packets to any of those hosts needs only one entry in its IP routing table. This basic fact is 
one of the key reasons that routers can scale to allow tens and hundreds of thousands of 
devices. It’s very similar to the U.S.P.S. ZIP code system—it would be ridiculous to have 
people in the same ZIP code live somewhere far away from each other, or to have next-door 
neighbors be in different zip codes. The poor postman would spend all his time driving and 
ﬂying around the country! Similarly, to make routing more efﬁcient, network layer protocols 
group addresses together. 
With that in mind, most network layer (Layer 3) addressing schemes were created with the 
following goals:
■
The address space should be large enough to accommodate the largest network for 
which the designers imagined the protocol would be used.
■
The addresses should allow for unique assignment.
■
The address structure should have some grouping implied so that many addresses are 
considered to be in the same group.
■
Dynamic address assignment for clients is desired.
The U.S. Postal Service analogy also works well as a comparison to how IP network numbers 
are assigned. Instead of getting involved with every small community’s plans for what to 
name new streets, the post service simply has a nearby ofﬁce with a ZIP code. If that local 
town wants to add streets, the rest of the post ofﬁces in the country already are prepared 
because they just forward letters based on the ZIP code, which they already know. The only 
postal employees who care about the new streets are the people in the local post ofﬁce. It is 

Typical Features of OSI Layer 3     119
the local postmaster’s job to assign a mail carrier to deliver and pick up mail on any new 
streets. 
Also, you can have duplicate local street addresses, as long as they are in different ZIP codes, 
and it all still works. There might be hundreds of Main streets in different ZIP codes, but as 
long as there is just one per ZIP code, the address is unique. Layer 3 network addresses 
follow the same concept—as long as the entire Layer 3 address is unique compared to the 
other Layer 3 addresses, all is well.
Example Layer 3 Address Structures
Each Layer 3 address structure contains at least two parts. One (or more) part at the 
beginning of the address works like the ZIP code and essentially identiﬁes the grouping. All 
instances of addresses with the same value in these ﬁrst bits of the address are considered to 
be in the same group—for example, the same IP subnet or IPX network or AppleTalk cable 
range. The last part of the address acts as a local address, uniquely identifying that device in 
that particular group. Table 5-2 outlines several Layer 3 address structures.
*Consecutively numbered values in this ﬁeld can be combined into one group, called a cable range.
Routing Protocols
Conveniently, the routing tables in the example based on Figure 5-2 had the correct routing 
information already in their routing tables. In most cases, these entries are built dynamically 
by use of a routing protocol. Routing protocols learn about all the locations of the network 
layer “groups” in a network and advertise the locations of the groups. As a result, each 
router can build a good routing table dynamically. Routing protocols deﬁne message formats 
and procedures, just like any other protocol. The end goal of each routing protocol is to ﬁll 
the routing table with all known destination groups and with the best route to reach each 
group.

The terminology relating to routing protocols sometimes can get in the way. A routing 
protocol learns routes and puts those routes in a routing table. A routed protocol is the type 
of packet forwarded, or routed, through a network. In Figures 5-1 and 5-2, the ﬁgures 
represent how IP packets are routed, so IP would be the routed protocol. If the routers used 
the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) to learn the routes, then RIP would be the routing 
protocol.
Later in this chapter, the section titled “IP Routing Protocols” shows a detailed example of 
how routing protocols learn routes. 
IP Addressing Fundamentals
No one reading this book should be shocked to hear that IP addressing is one of the most 
important topics for passing the the INTRO and ICND exams. In fact, IP addressing is the 
only major topic that is covered speciﬁcally on both the INTRO and ICND exams. Plus, you 
need a comfortable, conﬁdent understanding of IP addressing and subnetting for success on 
any Cisco certiﬁcation. In other words, you had better know addressing and subnetting!
This section introduces IP addressing and subnetting, and also covers the concepts behind the 
struture of an IP address, including how it relates to IP routing. In Chapter 12, “IP 
Addressing and Subnetting,” you will read about the math behind IP addressing and 
subnetting.
IP Addressing Deﬁnitions
If a device wants to communicate using TCP/IP, it needs an IP address. When the device has 
an IP address and the appropriate software and hardware, it can send and receive IP packets. 
Any device that can send and receive IP packets is called an IP host.
IP addresses consist of a 32-bit number, usually written in dotted-decimal notation. The 
“decimal” part of the term comes from the fact that each byte (8 bits) of the 32-bit IP address 
is converted to its decimal equivalent. The four resulting decimal numbers are written in 
sequence, with “dots,” or decimal points, separating the numbers—hence the name dotted-
decimal. For instance, 168.1.1.1 is an IP address written in dotted-decimal form, but the 
actual binary version is 10101000 00000001 00000001 00000001. (You almost never need 
to write down the binary version—but you will need to know how to convert between the 
two formats in Chapter 12, “IP Addressing and Subnetting.”)
Each of the decimal numbers in an IP address is called an octet. The term octet is just a 
vendor-neutral term instead of byte. So, for an IP address of 168.1.1.1, the ﬁrst octet is 168, 
the second octet is 1, and so on. The range of decimal numbers numbers in each octet is 
between 0 and 255, inclusive. 

IP Addressing Fundamentals     121
Finally, note that each network interface uses a unique IP address. Most people tend to think 
that their computer has an IP address, but actually their computer’s network card has an IP 
address. If you put two Ethernet cards in a PC to forward IP packets through both cards, 
they both would need unique IP addresses. Similarly, routers, which typically have many 
network interfaces that forward IP packets, have an IP address for each interface.
Now that you have some idea about the basic terminology, the next section relates IP 
addressing to the routing concepts of OSI Layer 3.
How IP Addresses Are Grouped Together
To fully appreciate IP addressing, you ﬁrst must understand the concepts behind the grouping 
of IP addresses. The ﬁrst visions of what we call the Internet were for connecting research 
sites. A typical network diagram might have looked like Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3
Sample Network Using Class A, B, and C Network Numbers
The conventions of IP addressing and IP address grouping make routing easy. For example, 
all IP addresses that begin with 8 are on the Token Ring on the left. Likewise, all IP addresses 
that begin with 130.4 are on the right. Along the same lines, 199.1.1 is the preﬁx on the serial 
link. By following this convention, the routers build a routing table with three entries, one 
for each preﬁx, or network number. 
So, the general ideas about how IP address groupings can be summarized are as follows: 
■
All IP addresses in the same group must not be separated by a router.
■
IP addresses separated by a router must be in different groups. 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, IP addressing behaves similarly to ZIP codes. Everyone 
living in my ZIP code lives in my town. If some members of my ZIP code were in California, 
some of my mail might be sent out there (I live in Georgia, by the way). Likewise, IP routing

122     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
counts on the fact that all IP addresses in the same subnet are in the same general location, 
with the routers in the network forwarding trafﬁc to addresses in my subnet to a router 
connected to my subnet. 
Classes of Networks
In Figure 5-3 and the surrounding text, I claimed that the IP addresses of devices attached to 
the Token Ring all started with 8 and that the IP addresses of devices attached to the Ethernet 
all started with 130.4. Why only one number for the “preﬁx” on the Token Ring and two 
numbers on the Ethernet? Well, it all has to do with IP address classes.
RFC 790 deﬁnes the IP protocol, including multiple different classes of networks. IP deﬁnes 
three different network classes, called A, B, and C, from which individual hosts are assigned 
IP addresses. TCP/IP deﬁnes Class D (multicast) addresses and Class E (experimental) 
addresses as well.
By deﬁnition, all addresses in the same Class A, B, or C network have the same numeric value 
network portion of the addresses. The rest of the address is called the host portion of the 
address. 
Using the post ofﬁce example, the network part of an IP address acts like the ZIP code, and 
the host part acts like the street address. Just as a letter-sorting machine three states away 
from you cares only about the ZIP code on a letter addressed to you, a router three hops 
away from you cares only about the network number that your address resides in. 
Class A, B, and C networks each have a different length for the part that identiﬁes the 
network: 
■
Class A networks have a 1-byte-long network part. That leaves 3 bytes for the rest of the 
address, called the host part. 
■
Class B networks have a 2-byte-long network part, leaving 2 bytes for the host portion 
of the address. 
■
Class C networks have a 3-byte-long network part, leaving only 1 byte for the host part.
For instance, Figure 5-3 lists network 8.0.0.0 next to the Token Ring. Network 8.0.0.0 is a 
Class A network, which means that only 1 byte is used for the network part of the address. 
So, all hosts in network 8.0.0.0 begin with 8. Similarly, Class B network 130.4.0.0 is listed 
next to the Ethernet; because it is Class B, 2 bytes deﬁne the network part, and all addresses 
begin with those same two bytes. When written down, network numbers have all decimal 0s 
in the host part of the number. So, Class A network “8” is written 8.0.0.0, Class B network 
130.4 is written 130.4.0.0, and so on.

IP Addressing Fundamentals     123
Now consider the size of each class of network. Class A networks need 1 byte for the 
network part, leaving 3 bytes, or 24 bits, for the host part. There are 224 different possible 
values in the host part of a Class A IP address. So, each Class A network can have 224 IP 
addresses—except for two reserved host addresses in each network, as shown in the last 
column of Table 5-3. The table summarizes the characteristics of Class A, B, and C networks. 
*There are two reserved host addresses per network.
Network numbers look like actual addresses because they are in dotted-decimal format. 
However, network numbers are not actually IP addresses because they cannot be assigned to 
an interface as an IP address. Conceptually, network numbers represent the group of all IP 
addresses in the network, much like a ZIP code represents the group of all addresses in a 
community. Based on the three examples from Figure 5-3, Table 5-4 provides a closer look 
at the numerical version of the three network numbers: 8.0.0.0, 130.4.0.0, and 199.1.1.0.
Two numbers inside each Class A, B, or C network are reserved, as mentioned at Table 5-3. 
One of the two reserved values is the network number itself. For instance, each of the 
numbers in Table 5-4 is reserved. The other reserved value is the one with all binary 1s in the 
host part of the address—this number is called the network broadcast or directed broadcast 
address. Also, because the network number is the lowest numerical value inside that network 
and the broadcast address is the largest, all the numbers between the network number and 
the broadcast address are the valid, useful IP addresses that can be used to address interfaces 
in the network.

The Actual Class A, B, and C Network Numbers
Many different Class A, B, and C networks exist. If your ﬁrm connects to the Internet, it must 
use registered, unique network numbers. To that end, the Network Information Center 
(NIC) assigns network numbers so that all IP address are unique. By assigning one company 
a particular network number, and not assigning that same network number to any other 
company, all IP addresses can be unique throughout the Internet. Table 5-5 summarizes the 
possible network numbers, the total number of each type, and the number of hosts in each 
Class A, B, and C network.
*The Valid Network Numbers column shows actual network numbers. There are several reserved 
cases. For example, networks 0.0.0.0 (originally deﬁned for use as a broadcast address) and 
127.0.0.0 (still available for use as the loopback address) are reserved. Networks 128.0.0.0, 
191.255.0.0, 192.0.0.0, and 223.255.255.0 also are reserved.
Memorizing the contents of Table 5-5 should be one of the ﬁrst things you do in preparation 
for the CCNA exam(s). Engineers should be able to categorize a network as Class A, B, or C 
with ease. Also memorize the number of octets in the network part of Class A, B, and C 
addresses, as shown in Table 5-4.
IP Subnetting
One of the most important topics on both the INTRO and ICND exams is the topic of 
subnetting. You need to know how it works and how to “do the math” to ﬁgure out issues 
when subnetting is in use, both in real life and on the exam.
Chapter 12 covers the details of subnetting concepts, motivation, and math, but you should 
have a basic understanding of the concepts before covering the topics between here and 
Chapter 12. So, this section describes the basics.
IP subnetting creates vastly larger numbers of smaller groups of IP addresses, compared with 
simply using Class A, B, and C conventions. The Class A, B, and C rules still exist—but now, 
a single Class A, B, or C network can be subdivided into many smaller groups. Subnetting 
treats a subdivision of a single Class A, B, or C network as if it were a network itself. By doing 
so, a single Class A, B, or C network can be subdivided into many nonoverlapping subnets.

IP Addressing Fundamentals     125
Comparing a single network topology using subnetting with the same topology without 
subnetting drives home the basic concept. Figure 5-4 shows such a network, without 
subnetting.
Figure 5-4
Backdrop for Discussing Numbers of Different Networks/Subnetworks
The design in Figure 5-4 requires six groups, each of which is a Class B network in this 
example. The four LANs each use a single Class B network. In other words, each of the LANs 
attached to routers A, B, C, and D is in a separate network. Additionally, the two serial 
interfaces composing the point-to-point serial link between routers C and D use the same 
network because these two interfaces are not separated by a router. Finally, the three router 
interfaces composing the Frame Relay network with routers A, B, and C are not separated 
by an IP router and would compose the sixth network. 
Each Class B network has 216 – 2 hosts addresses in it—far more than you will ever need for 
each LAN and WAN link. In fact, this design would not be allowed if it were connected to 
the Internet. The NIC would not assign six separate registered Class B network numbers—
150.1.0.0
150.2.0.0

126     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
in fact, you probably would not even get one Class B network because most of the Class B 
addresses already are assigned. You more likely would get a couple of Class C networks, and 
the NIC would expect you to use subnetting.
Figure 5-5 illustrates a more realistic example that uses basic subnetting.
Figure 5-5
Using Subnets
As in Figure 5-4, the design in Figure 5-5 requires six groups. Unlike Figure 5-5, this ﬁgure 
uses six subnets, each of which is a subnet of a single Class B network. This design subnets 
Class B network 150.150.0.0, which has been assigned by the NIC. To perform 
subnetting,the third octet (in this example) is used to identify unique subnets of network 
150.150.0.0. Notice that each subnet number in the ﬁgure shows a different value in the third 
octet, representing each different subnet number. In other words, this design numbers or 
identiﬁes each different subnet using the third octet.

Network Layer Utilities     127
When subnetting, a third part of an IP address appears between the network and host parts 
of the address—namely, the subnet part of the address. This ﬁeld is created by “stealing” or 
“borrowing” bits from the host part of the address. The size of the network part of the 
address never shrinks—in other words, Class A, B, and C rules still apply when deﬁning the 
size of the network part of an address. The host part of the address shrinks to make room 
for the subnet part of the address. Figure 5-6 shows the format of addresses when subnetting.
Figure 5-6
Address Formats When Subnetting Is Used
Now, instead of routing based on the network part of an address, routers can route based on 
the combined network and subnet parts. In fact, most people do not even bother 
distinguishing between the network part and the subnet part—they just call both ﬁelds 
together the subnet part of an address.
Finally, IP addressing with subnetting uses a concept called a subnet mask. A subnet mask 
helps deﬁne the structure of an IP address, as shown in Figure 5-6. Chapter 12 explains the 
details.
Network Layer Utilities
The TCP/IP network layer uses several utility protocols to help it complete its task. For 
instance, in the ﬁrst section of this chapter, you read that the Address Resolution Protocol 
(ARP) could be used to discover the MAC address of another IP host. In this section, you will 
learn about some basic IP utilities, using other protocols beside IP that together help IP 
deliver packets end to end through an IP network.  
Address Resolution Protocol and the Domain Name System 
Network designers should try to make using the network as simple as possible. At most, users 
might want to remember the name of another computer with which they want to 
communicate, such as remembering the name of a web site. They certainly do not want to 
remember the IP address, nor do they want to try to remember any MAC addresses! So, TCP/

128     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
IP needs to have protocols that dynamically discover all the necessary information to allow 
communications, without the user knowing more than a name.
You might not even think that you need to know the name of another computer. For instance, 
when you open your browser, you probably have a default home page conﬁgured that the 
browser immediately downloads. You might not think of that URL string as a name, but the 
universal resource locator (URL) for the home page has a name embedded in it. For instance, in 
a URL such as www.skylinecomputer.com/Train_Welcome.asp, the www.skylinecomputer.com 
part is actually the name of the web server for the company that I work for. So, whether you 
type in the name of another networked computer or it is implied by what you see on your 
screen, the user typically identiﬁes a remote computer by using a name. 
So, TCP/IP needs a way to let a computer ﬁnd the IP address of another computer based on 
its name. TCP/IP also needs a way to ﬁnd MAC addresses associated with other computers 
on the same LAN subnet. Figure 5-7 outlines the problem. 
Figure 5-7
Hannah Knows Jessie’s Name, Needs IP Address and MAC Address
Hannah knows her own name, IP address, and MAC address because those things are 
conﬁgured in advance. What Hannah does not know are Jessie’s IP and MAC addresses. To 
ﬁnd the two missing facts, Hannah uses the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Address 
Resolution Protocol (ARP). Hannah knows the IP address of a DNS server because the 
address was preconﬁgured on Hannah’s machine. Hannah now sends a DNS request to the 
DNS, asking for Jessie’s IP address. The DNS replies with the address, 10.1.1.2. Figure 5-8 
shows the simple process.

DNS Request and Reply
Hannah simply sends a DNS request to the server, supplying the name jessie, or 
jessie.skylinecomputer.com, and the DNS replies with the IP address (10.1.1.2, in this case). 
Effectively, the same thing happens when you surf the Internet and connect to any web site. 
Your PC somehow knows the IP address of the DNS; that information can be preconﬁgured 
or learned using Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP), which is covered later in 
this chapter. Your PC sends a request, just like Hannah’s request for Jessie, asking the DNS 
to resolve the name into an IP address. After that happens, your PC can start requesting that 
the web page be sent.
Back to the example with Hannah. Hannah still needs to know the Ethernet MAC address 
used by 10.1.1.2, so Hannah issues something called an ARP broadcast. An ARP broadcast 
is sent to a broadcast Ethernet address, so everyone on the LAN receives it. Because Jessie is 
on the LAN, Jessie receives the ARP broadcast. Because Jessie’s IP address is 10.1.1.2 and the 
ARP broadcast is looking for the MAC address associated with 10.1.1.2, Jessie replies with 
her own MAC address. Figure 5-9 outlines the process.
Figure 5-9

Now Hannah knows the destination IP and Ethernet addresses that she should use when 
sending frames to Jessie, and the packet in Figure 5-7 can be sent successfully.

ICMP Echo and the ping Command
IP needs to have a way to test basic IP connectivity, without relying on any applications to 
be working. Hannah, being a great network troubleshooter (in spite of being my 2-year-old 
daughter), can test basic network connectivity using the ping command. ping (Packet 
INternet Groper) uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), sending a message 
called an ICMP echo request to another IP address. The computer with that IP address 
should reply with an ICMP echo reply. If that works, you successfully have tested the IP 
network. ICMP does not rely on any application, so it really just tests basic IP connectivity—
Layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI model. Figure 5-10 outlines the basic process.
Figure 5-10
Sample Network, ping Command
ICMP contains many features, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 13, “Basic Router 
Conﬁguration and Operation.”
RARP, BOOTP, and DHCP
Over the years, three protocols have been popular to allow a host computer to discover the 
IP address it should use:
■
Reverse ARP (RARP)
■
Boot Protocol (BOOTP) 
■
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP)
RARP and BOOTP work using the same basic process. To use either protocol, a PC needs a 
LAN interface card. The computer sends a LAN broadcast frame announcing its own MAC 
address and requests that someone assign it an IP address. Figure 5-11 outlines the process 
for both RARP and BOOTP.

RARP and BOOTP
RARP and BOOTP requests sent to the LAN broadcast address simply ask for an IP address 
assignment. Both protocols allow for IP address assignment, but that is all that RARP can 
ask for—it can’t even ask for the subnet mask used on the LAN. RARP is deﬁned in RFC 
903, whereas BOOTP was deﬁned later in RFC 1542, including several improvements over 
RARP. So, BOOTP allows many more tidbits of information to be announced to a BOOTP 
client—its IP address, its subnet mask, its default gateway IP addresses, its other server IP 
addresses, and the name of a ﬁle that the computer should download.
Both RARP and BOOTP were created with the motivation to allow a diskless workstation 
to come up and start operating. With RARP, the creators of the protocol just wanted to get 
the machine an IP address so that a knowledgeable user could type in commands and copy 
the correct ﬁles from a server onto the diskless computer’s RAM memory so that they could 
be used. The creators of BOOTP, anticipating a less sophisticated user in the future, wanted 
to automate as much of the process as possible—including the dynamic assignment of a 
default gateway (router) IP address.
BOOTP’s name really comes from the feature in which BOOTP supplies the name of a ﬁle to 
the BOOTP client. Typically, the diskless workstations had enough permanent memory to 
boot a very simple operating system, with the expectation that the computer would use a 
simple protocol, such as the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), to transfer a ﬁle containing 
a more sophisticated operating system into RAM. So, with the ultimate goal being to let a 
diskless computer complete the processing of initializing, or booting, a full operating system, 
BOOTP was aptly named.

132     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
Neither RARP nor BOOTP is used much today. (They are possible topics for the INTRO 
exam, though.) One of the problems with both RARP and BOOTP is that they required a 
computer to act as a server, and the server was required to know the MAC address of every 
computer and the corresponding conﬁguration parameters that each computer should be 
told. So, administration in a network of any size was painful.
DHCP, which is very popular in real networks today, solves some of the scaling and 
conﬁguration issues with RARP and BOOTP, while supplying the same types of information. 
The main protocols for DHCP are deﬁned in RFC 2131, but a couple of dozen additional 
RFCs deﬁne extensions and applications of DHCP for a variety of other useful purposes.
Like BOOTP, DHCP uses the concept of the client making a request and the server supplying 
the IP address to the client, plus other information such as the default gateway, subnet mask, 
DNS IP address, and other information. The biggest advantage of DHCP compared to 
BOOTP and RARP is that DHCP does not require that the DHCP server be conﬁgured with 
all MAC addresses of all clients. DHCP deﬁnes a process by which the server knows the IP 
subnet in which the DHCP client resides, and it can assign an IP address from a pool of valid 
IP addresses in that subnet. So, the DHCP server does not need to know the MAC address 
ahead of time. Also, most of the other information that DHCP might supply, such as the 
default router IP address, is the same for all hosts in the same subnet, so DHCP servers simply 
can conﬁgure information per subnet rather than per host and save a lot of administrative 
hassle compared to BOOTP.
The basic DHCP messages for acquiring an IP address are shown in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12
DHCP Messages to Acquire an IP Address
DHCP has become a very proliﬁc protocol, with most end-user hosts on LANs in corporate 
networks getting their IP addresses and other basic conﬁguration via DHCP.

IP Routing and Routing Protocols     133
IP Routing and Routing Protocols 
In the ﬁrst section of this chapter, you read about the basics of routing using a network with 
three routers and two PCs. Armed with more knowledge of IP addressing, you now can take 
a closer look at the process of routing IP. Figure 5-13 repeats the familiar network diagram, 
this time with subnets of network 150.150.0.0 used.
Figure 5-13
Simple Routing Example, with IP Subnets
First, a few detail about the ﬁgure need to be explained. The subnet numbers are shown, with 
the whole third octet used for the subnet part of the addresses. The actual IP addressed for 
PC1 and PC2 are shown. However, the full IP addresses of the routers are not shown in the 
ﬁgure. Many times, to reduce clutter, only the host part of the address is listed in a ﬁgure. For 
instance, R2’s IP address on the serial link to R1 is 150.150.2.7. The subnet is 150.150.2.0, 
and the .7 shown beside R2 in the ﬁgure represents the host part of the address, which is the 
fourth octet in this case.

134     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
A detailed examination of the routing logic used by PC1, R1, R2, and R3 is listed earlier in 
this chapter. That same logic is repeated here, using the more detailed information contained 
in the ﬁgure:
Step 1
PC1 sends the packet to R1—PC1 ﬁrst builds the IP packet, with a 
destination address of PC2’s IP address (150.150.4.10). PC1 needs to 
send the packet to R1 because it knows that its default router is 
150.150.1.4. PC1 ﬁrst checks its ARP cache, hoping to ﬁnd R1’s 
Ethernet MAC address. If it is not found, PC1 ARPs to learn R1’s 
Ethernet MAC address. Then PC1 places the IP packet into an Ethernet 
frame, with a destination Ethernet address of R1’s Ethernet address. 
PC1 sends the frame onto the Ethernet.  
Step 2
R1 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to R2— 
Because the incoming Ethernet frame has a destination MAC of R1’s 
Ethernet MAC, R1 copies the frame off the Ethernet for processing. If 
the FCS passes, meaning that the Ethernet frame did not have any errors 
in it, R1 looks at the Protocol Type ﬁeld to discover that the packet 
inside the frame is an IP packet. R1 then discards the Ethernet header 
and trailer. 
Next, R1 looks for the routing table entry that matches the destination 
address in the packet, 150.150.4.10. The routing table entry is listed in 
the ﬁgure—a route to subnet 150.150.4.0, with outgoing interface 
Serial0 to next-hop router R2 (150.150.2.7). 
Now R1 just needs to build an HDLC frame and send it out its Serial0 
interface to R2. As mentioned earlier, ARP is not needed on a point-to-
point HDLC WAN link. R1 knows all the information necessary to out 
the packet inside an HDLC frame and send the frame.
Step 3
R2 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to R3—R2 
repeats the same general process as R1 when it receives the HDLC 
frame. After stripping the HDLC header and trailer, R2 also needs to 
ﬁnd the routing table entry that matches destination 150.150.4.10. R2’s 
routing table has an entry for 150.150.4.0, outgoing interface serial1, 
to next-hop router 150.150.3.1, which is R3.
Before R2 can complete the task, the correct DLCI for the VC to R3 
must be decided. The details of how R2 knows the right DLCI are 
covered in Chapter 11, “Frame Relay,” of the CCNA ICND Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. With that mapping information, R2 can complete 
the Frame Relay header and send the frame to R3.

IP Routing and Routing Protocols     135
Step 4
R3 processes the incoming frame and forwards the packet to PC2—
Like R1 and R2 before it, R3 checks the FCS in the data-link trailer, 
looks at the type ﬁeld to decide whether the packet inside the frame is 
an IP packet, and then discards the Frame Relay header and trailer. The 
routing table entry for 150.150.4.0 shows that the outgoing interface is 
R3’s Ethernet interface, but there is no next-hop router because R3 is 
connected directly to subnet 150.150.4.0. All R3 has to do is 
encapsulate the packet inside a Ethernet header and trailer, and forward 
the frame. Before R3 can ﬁnish building the Ethernet header, an IP 
ARP broadcast must be used to ﬁnd PC2’s MAC address (assuming that 
R3 doesn’t already have that information in its IP ARP cache).
The routing process relies on the rules relating to IP addressing. For instance, why did 
150.150.1.10 (PC1) assume that 150.150.4.10 (PC2) was not on the same Ethernet? Well, 
because 150.150.4.0, PC2’s subnet, is different than 150.150.1.0, which is PC1’s subnet. 
Because IP addresses in different subnets must be separated by some router, PC1 needed to 
send the packet to some router—and it did. Similarly, all three routers list a route to subnet 
150.150.4.0, which, in this example, includes IP addresses 150.150.4.1 to 150.150.4.254. 
What if someone tried to put PC2 somewhere else in the network, but still using 
150.150.4.10? The routers then would forward packets to the wrong place. So, Layer 3 
routing relies on the structure of Layer 3 addressing to route more efﬁciently. 
IP Routing Protocols
IP routing protocols ﬁll the IP routing table with valid, (hopefully) loop-free routes. Each 
route includes a subnet number, the interface out which to forward packets so that they are 
delivered to that subnet, and the IP address of the next router that should receive packets 
destined for that subnet (if needed). 
Before examining the underlying logic, you need to consider the goals of a routing protocol. 
The goals described in the following list are common for any IP routing protocol, regardless 
of its underlying logic type:
■
To dynamically learn and ﬁll the routing table with a route to all subnets in the network.
■
If more than one route to a subnet is available, to place the best route in the routing table.
■
To notice when routes in the table are no longer valid, and to remove those routes from 
the routing table.
■
If a route is removed from the routing table and another route through another 
neighboring router is available, to add the route to the routing table. (Many people view 
this goal and the preceding one as a single goal.)

136     Chapter 5: Fundamentals of IP
■
To add new routes, or to replace lost routes, with the best currently available route as 
quickly as possible. The time between losing the route and ﬁnding a working 
replacement route is called convergence time.
■
To prevent routing loops.
Routing protocols can become rather complicated, but the basic logic that they use is 
relatively simple. Routing protocols take the routes in a routing table and send a message to 
their neighbors telling them about the routes. After a while, everyone has heard about all the 
routes.
Figure 5-14 shows a sample network, with routing updates shown. Table 5-6 lists Router B’s 
routing table before receiving the routing updates, and Table 5-7 lists Router B’s routing table 
after receiving the routing updates.

IP Routing and Routing Protocols     137
Router B adds routes for directly connected subnets when the interfaces ﬁrst initialize. In fact, 
no routing protocols are needed for a router to learn routes to the directly connected subnets. 
So, before Router B receives any routing updates, it knows about only two routes—the two 
connected routes—as listed in Table 5-6.
After receiving the update from Router A, Router B has learned three more routes. Because 
Router B learned those routes from Router A, all three of B’s routes point back to Router A 
as the next hop router. That makes sense because it is obvious from the ﬁgure that B’s only 
path to the other subnets lies through Router A.
Router A learned about subnets 162.11.5.0 and 162.11.9.0 because A is connected directly 
to those subnets. Router A, in turn, learned about subnet 162.11.10.0, the subnet off Router 
C’s Ethernet, from routing updates sent by Router C.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
The routing process forwards the packet, and only the packet, from end to end through the 
network, discarding data-link headers and trailers along the way. The network layer 
processes deliver the packet end to end, using successive data-link headers and trailers just to 
get the packet to the next router or host in the path. Figure 5-15 shows the concepts behind 
encapsulation used by routers.

Foundation Summary     139
Table 5-8 outlines several Layer 3 address structures.
*Consecutively numbered values in this ﬁeld can be combined into one group, called a cable range.
The general ideas about how IP address groupings can be summarized as follows: 
■
All IP addresses in the same group must not be separated by a router.
■
IP addresses separated by a router must be in different groups. 
Table 5-9 summarizes the characteristics of Class A, B, and C networks. 
*There are two reserved host addresses per network.
Network numbers look like actual addresses because they are in dotted-decimal format. 
However, network numbers are not actually IP addresses because they cannot be assigned to 
an interface as an IP address.

Table 5-10 summarizes the possible network numbers, the total number of each type, and 
the number of hosts in each Class A, B, and C network.
*The Valid Network Numbers column shows actual network numbers. There are several reserved 
cases. For example, networks 0.0.0.0 (originally deﬁned for use as a broadcast address) and 
127.0.0.0 (still available for use as the loopback address) are reserved. Networks 128.0.0.0, 
191.255.0.0, 192.0.0.0, and 223.255.255.0 also are reserved.
When subnetting, the host part of the address shrinks to make room for the subnet part of 
the address. Figure 5-16 shows the format of addresses when subnetting.

■Typical Features of OSI Layer 4
■The Transmission Control Protocol
■The User Datagram Protocol

C H A P T E R 6
Fundamentals of TCP and UDP
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are the 
two most popular TCP/IP transport layer protocols. These TCP/IP protocols deﬁne a 
variety of functions considered to be OSI transport layer, or Layer 4, features. Some of 
the functions relate to things you see every day—for instance, when you open multiple 
web browsers on your PC, how does your PC know which browser to put the next web 
page in? When a web server sends you 500 IP packets containing the various parts of a 
web page, and 1 packet has errors, how does your PC recover the lost data? This chapter 
covers how TCP and UDP perform these two functions, along with the other functions 
performed by the transport layer. 
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The ten-question quiz, derived from the major sections in “Foundation Topics” portion 
of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.
Table 6-1 outlines the major topics discussed in this chapter and the “Do I Know This

Typical Features of OSI Layer 4     149
Foundation Topics
As in the last two chapters, this chapter starts with a general discussion of the functions of 
an OSI layer—in this case, Layer 4, the transport layer. Two speciﬁc transport layer 
protocols—the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol 
(UDP) are covered later in the chapter. This chapter covers OSI Layer 4 concepts, but mostly 
through an examination of the TCP and UDP protocols. So, this chapter brieﬂy introduces 
OSI transport layer details and then dives right into how TCP works.
Typical Features of OSI Layer 4
The transport layer (Layer 4) deﬁnes several functions, the most important of which are error 
recovery and ﬂow control. Routers discard packets for many reasons, including bit errors, 
congestion and instances in which no correct routes are known. As you have read already, 
most data-link protocols notice errors but then discard frames that have errors. The OSI 
transport layer might provide for retransmission (error recovery) and help to avoid 
congestion (ﬂow control)—or it might not. It really just depends on the particular protocol. 
However, if error recovery or ﬂow control is performed with the more modern protocol 
suites, the functions typically are performed with a Layer 4 protocol.
OSI Layer 4 includes some other features as well. Table 6-2 summarizes the main features of 
the OSI transport layer. You will read about the speciﬁc implementation of these protocols 
in the sections about TCP and UDP. 
Table 6-2
OSI Transport Layer Features
Feature
Explanation
Connection-oriented 
or connectionless
Deﬁnes whether the protocol establishes some correlation between 
two endpoints before any user data is allowed to be transferred 
(connection oriented), or not (connectionless).
Error recovery
The process of noticing errored or lost segments and causing them to 
be resent.
Reliability
Another term for error recovery.
Flow control
Processes that control the rates at which data is transferred between 
two endpoints.
Segmenting 
application data
Application layer protocols may need to send large chunks of data—
much larger than can ﬁt inside one IP packet. The transport layer is 
responsible for segmenting the larger data into pieces, called segments, 
that can ﬁt inside a packet.

150     Chapter 6: Fundamentals of TCP and UDP
The Transmission Control Protocol
Each TCP/IP application typically chooses to use either TCP or UDP based on the 
application’s requirements. For instance, TCP provides error recovery, but to do so, it 
consumes more bandwidth and uses more processing cycles. UDP does not do error recovery, 
but it takes less bandwidth and uses fewer processing cycles. Regardless of which of the two 
TCP/IP transport layer protocols the application chooses to use, you should understand the 
basics of how each of the protocols works.
TCP provides a variety of useful features, including error recovery. In fact, TCP is best known 
for its error-recovery feature—but it does more. TCP, deﬁned in RFC 793, performs the 
following functions:
■
Multiplexing using port numbers
■
Error recovery (reliability)
■
Flow control using windowing
■
Connection establishment and termination
■
End-to-end ordered data transfer
■
Segmentation
TCP accomplishes these functions through mechanisms at the endpoint computers. TCP 
relies on IP for end-to-end delivery of the data, including routing issues. In other words, TCP 
performs only part of the functions necessary to deliver the data between applications, and 
the role that it plays is directed toward providing services for the applications that sit at the 
endpoint computers. Regardless of whether two computers are on the same Ethernet, or are 
separated by the entire Internet, TCP performs its functions the same way.
Figure 6-1 shows the ﬁelds in the TCP header. Not all the ﬁelds are described in this text, but 
several ﬁelds are referred to in this section. The Cisco Press book, Internetworking 
Technologies Handbook, Fourth Edition, lists the ﬁelds along with brief explanations.

TCP Header Fields
Multiplexing Using TCP Port Numbers
TCP provides a lot of features to applications, at the expense of requiring slightly more 
processing and overhead, as compared to UDP. However, TCP and UDP both use a concept 
called multiplexing. So, this section begins with an explanation of multiplexing with TCP 
and UDP. Afterward, the unique features of TCP and UDP are explored.
Multiplexing by TCP and UDP involves the process of how a computer thinks when receiving 
data. The computer might be running many applications, such as a web browser, an e-mail 
package, or an FTP client. TCP and UDP multiplexing enables the receiving computer to 
know which application to give the data to.
Some examples will help make the need for multiplexing obvious. The sample network 
consists of two PCs, labeled Hannah and Jessie. Hannah uses an application that she wrote 
to send advertisements that display on Jessie’s screen. The application sends a new ad to 
Jessie every 10 seconds. Hannah uses a second application, a wire-transfer application, to 
send Jessie some money. Finally, Hannah uses a web browser to access the web server that 
runs on Jessie’s PC. The ad application and wire-transfer application are imaginary, just for 
this example. The web application works just like it would in real life.

Figure 6-2
Hannah Sending Packets to Jessie, with Three Applications
Jessie needs to know which application to give the data to, but all three packets are from the 
same Ethernet and IP address. You might think that Jessie could look at whether the packet 
contains a UDP or a TCP header, but, as you see in the ﬁgure, two applications (wire transfer 
and web) both are using TCP. 
TCP and UDP solve this problem by using a port number ﬁeld in the TCP or UDP header, 
respectively. Each of Hannah’s TCP and UDP segments uses a different destination port 
number so that Jessie knows which application to give the data to. Figure 6-3 shows an 
example.
Multiplexing relies on the use of a concept called a socket. A socket consists of three things: 
an IP address, a transport protocol, and a port number. So, for a web server application on 
Jessie, the socket would be (10.1.1.2, TCP, port 80) because, by default, web servers use the 
well-known port 80. When Hannah’s web browser connected to the web server, Hannah 
used a socket as well—possibly one like this: (10.1.1.1, TCP, 1030). Why 1030? Well, 
Hannah just needs a port number that is unique on Hannah, so Hannah saw that port 1030 
was available and used it. In fact, hosts typically allocate dynamic port numbers starting at 
1024 because the ports below 1024 are reserved for well-known applications, such as web 
services.

In Figure 6-3, Hannah and Jessie used three applications at the same time—hence, there were 
three socket connections open. Because a socket on a single computer should be unique, a 
connection between two sockets should identify a unique connection between two 
computers. The fact that each connection between two sockets is unique means that you can use 
multiple applications at the same time, talking to applications running on the same or different 
computers; multiplexing, based on sockets, ensures that the data is delivered to the correct 
applications. Figure 6-4 shows the three socket connections between Hannah and Jessie.

154     Chapter 6: Fundamentals of TCP and UDP
Port numbers are a vital part of the socket concept. Well-known port numbers are used by 
servers; other port numbers are used by clients. Applications that provide a service, such as 
FTP, Telnet, and web servers, open a socket using a well-known port and listen for 
connection requests. Because these connection requests from clients are required to include 
both the source and the destination port numbers, the port numbers used by the servers must 
be well known. Therefore, each server has a hard-coded, well-known port number, as deﬁned 
in the well-known numbers RFC. 
On client machines, where the requests originate, any unused port number can be allocated. 
The result is that each client on the same host uses a different port number, but a server uses 
the same port number for all connections. For example, 100 Telnet clients on the same host 
computer would each use a different port number, but the Telnet server with 100 clients 
connected to it would have only 1 socket and, therefore, only 1 port number. The 
combination of source and destination sockets allows all participating hosts to distinguish 
between the source and destination of the data. (Look to www.rfc-editor.org to ﬁnd RFCs 
such as the well-known numbers RFC 1700.) 
Popular TCP/IP Applications
Throughout your preparation for the CCNA INTRO and ICND exams, you will come 
across a variety of TCP/IP applications. You should at least be aware of some of the 
applications that can be used to help manage and control a network.
The World Wide Web (WWW) application exists through web browsers accessing the 
content available on web servers, as mentioned earlier. While often thought of as an end-user 
application, you can actually use WWW to manage a router or switch by enabling a web 
server function in the router or switch, and using a browser to access the router or switch.
The Domain Name System (DNS) allows users to use names to refer to computers, with DNS 
being used to ﬁnd the corresponding IP addresses. DNS also uses a client/server model, with 
DNS servers being controlled by networking personnel, and DNS client functions being part 
of most any device that uses TCP/IP today. The client simply asks the DNS server to supply 
the IP address that corresponds to a given name.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application layer protocol used 
speciﬁcally for network device management. For instance, the Cisco Works network 
management software product can be used to query, compile, store, and display information 
about the operation of a network. In order to query the network devices, Cisco Works uses 
SNMP protocols.
NOTE
You can ﬁnd all RFCs online at www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfcxxxx.txt, where xxxx is 
the number of the RFC. If you do not know the number of the RFC, you can try searching 
by topic at www.rfc-editor.org/cgi-bin/rfcsearch.html.

The Transmission Control Protocol     155
Traditionally, in order to move ﬁles to and from a router or switch, Cisco used Trivial File 
Transfer Protocol (TFTP). TFTP deﬁnes a protocol for basic ﬁle transfer – hence the word 
“trivial” to start the name of the application. Alternately, routers and switches can use File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is a much more functional protocol, for transferring ﬁles. 
Both work well for moving ﬁles into and out of Cisco devices. FTP allows many more 
features, making it a good choice for the general end-user population, whereas TFTP client 
and server applications are very simple, making them good tools as imbedded parts of 
networking devices.
Some of these applications use TCP, and some use UDP. As you will read later, TCP performs 
error recovery, whereas UDP does not. For instance, Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) 
and Post Ofﬁce Protocol version 3 (POP3), both used for transferring mail, require 
guaranteed delivery, so they use TCP. Regardless of which transport layer protocol is used, 
applications use a well-known port number, so that clients know to which port to attempt to 
connect. Table 6-3 lists several popular applications and their well-known port numbers.
Error Recovery (Reliability)
TCP provides for reliable data transfer, which is also called reliability or error recovery, 
depending on what document you read. To accomplish reliability, TCP numbers data bytes 
using the Sequence and Acknowledgment ﬁelds in the TCP header. TCP achieves reliability 
in both directions, using the Sequence Number ﬁeld of one direction combined with the 
Acknowledgment ﬁeld in the opposite direction. Figure 6-5 shows the basic operation.
In Figure 6-5, the Acknowledgment ﬁeld in the TCP header sent by the web client (4000) 
implies the next byte to be received; this is called forward acknowledgment. The sequence 
number reﬂects the number of the ﬁrst byte in the segment. In this case, each TCP segment 
is 1000 bytes in length; the Sequence and Acknowledgment ﬁelds count the number of bytes.

Figure 6-5
TCP Acknowledgment Without Errors
Figure 6-6 depicts the same scenario, but the second TCP segment was lost or was in error. 
The web client’s reply has an ACK ﬁeld equal to 2000, implying that the web client is 
expecting byte number 2000 next. The TCP function at the web server then could recover 
lost data by resending the second TCP segment. The TCP protocol allows for resending just 
that segment and then waiting, hoping that the web client will reply with an acknowledgment 
that equals 4000. 
Figure 6-6
TCP Acknowledgment with Errors
(Although not shown, the sender also sets a re-transmission timer, awaiting 
acknowledgment, just in case the acknowledgment is lost, or in case all transmitted segments 
are lost. If that timer expires, the TCP sender sends all segments again.)
Flow Control Using Windowing
TCP implements ﬂow control by taking advantage of the Sequence and Acknowledgment 
ﬁelds in the TCP header, along with another ﬁeld called the Window ﬁeld. This Window ﬁeld 
implies the maximum number of unacknowledged bytes allowed outstanding at any instant

in time. The window starts small and then grows until errors occur. The window then 
“slides” up and down based on network performance, so it is sometimes called a sliding 
window. When the window is full, the sender will not send, which controls the ﬂow of data. 
Figure 6-7 shows windowing with a current window size of 3000. Each TCP segment has 
1000 bytes of data.
Figure 6-7
TCP Windowing
Notice that the web server must wait after sending the third segment because the window is 
exhausted. When the acknowledgment has been received, another window can be sent. 
Because there have been no errors, the web client grants a larger window to the server, so 
now 4000 bytes can be sent before an acknowledgment is received by the server. In other 
words, the Window ﬁeld is used by the receiver to tell the sender how much data it can send 
before it must stop and wait for the next acknowledgment. As with other TCP features, 
windowing is symmetrical—both sides send and receive, and, in each case, the receiver grants 
a window to the sender using the Window ﬁeld.
Windowing does not require that the sender stop sending in all cases. If an acknowledgment 
is received before the window is exhausted, a new window begins and the sender continues 
to send data until the current window is exhausted. (The term, Positive Acknowledgement 
and Retransmission [PAR], is sometimes used to describe the error recovery and windowing 
processes used by TCP.)

Connection Establishment and Termination
TCP connection establishment occurs before any of the other TCP features can begin their 
work. Connection establishment refers to the process of initializing sequence and 
acknowledgment ﬁelds and agreeing to the port numbers used. Figure 6-8 shows an example 
of connection establishment ﬂow.
Figure 6-8
TCP Connection Establishment
This three-way connection-establishment ﬂow must complete before data transfer can begin. 
The connection exists between the two sockets, although there is no single socket ﬁeld in the 
TCP header. Of the three parts of a socket, the IP addresses are implied based on the source 
and destination IP addresses in the IP header. TCP is implied because a TCP header is in use, 
as speciﬁed by the protocol ﬁeld value in the IP header. Therefore, the only parts of the socket 
that need to be encoded in the TCP header are the port numbers.
TCP signals connection establishment using 2 bits inside the ﬂag ﬁelds of the TCP header. 
Called the SYN and ACK ﬂags, these bits have a particularly interesting meaning. SYN 
means “synchronize the sequence numbers,” which is one necessary component in 
initialization for TCP. The ACK ﬁeld means “the acknowledgment ﬁeld is valid in this 
header.” Until the sequence numbers are initialized, the acknowledgment ﬁeld cannot be very 
useful. Also notice that in the initial TCP segment in Figure 6-8, no acknowledgment number 
is shown; this is because that number is not valid yet. Because the ACK ﬁeld must be present 
in all the ensuing segments, the ACK bit continues to be set until the connection is 
terminated.
TCP initializes the Sequence Number and Acknowledgment Number ﬁelds to any number 
that ﬁts into the 4-byte ﬁelds; the actual values shown in Figure 6-8 are simply example 
values. The initialization ﬂows are each considered to have a single byte of data, as reﬂected 
in the Acknowledgment Number ﬁelds in the example.
Figure 6-9 shows TCP connection termination. This four-way termination sequence is 
straightforward and uses an additional ﬂag, called the FIN bit. (FIN is short for “ﬁnished,” 
as you might guess.) One interesting note: Before the device on the right sends the third TCP 
segment in the sequence, it notiﬁes the application that the connection is coming down.

It then waits on an acknowledgment from the application before sending the third segment 
in the ﬁgure. Just in case the application takes some time to reply, the PC on the right sends 
the second ﬂow in the ﬁgure, acknowledging that the other PC wants to take down the 
connection. Otherwise, the PC on the left might resend the ﬁrst segment over and over.
Figure 6-9
TCP Connection Termination
Connectionless and Connection-Oriented Protocols
The terms connection-oriented and connectionless have some relatively well-known 
connotations inside the world of networking protocols. The meaning of the terms is 
intertwined with error recovery and ﬂow control, but they are not the same. So, ﬁrst, some 
basic deﬁnitions are in order:
■
Connection-oriented protocol—A protocol either that requires an exchange of messages 
before data transfer begins or that has a required pre-established correlation between 
two endpoints
■
Connectionless protocol—A protocol that does not require an exchange of messages and 
that does not require a pre-established correlation between two endpoints
TCP is indeed connection oriented because of the set of three messages that establish a TCP 
connection. Likewise, Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX), a transport layer protocol from 
Novell, is connection oriented. When using permanent virtual circuits (PVCs), Frame Relay 
does not require any messages to be sent ahead of time, but it does require predeﬁnition in

the Frame Relay switches, establishing a connection between two Frame Relay–attached 
devices. ATM PVCs are also connection oriented, for similar reasons.
Many people confuse the real meaning of connection-oriented with the deﬁnition of a 
reliable, or error-recovering, protocol. TCP happens to do both, but just because a protocol 
is connection-oriented does not mean that it also performs error recovery. Table 6-4 lists 
some popular protocols and tells whether they are connected or reliable.
Data Segmentation and Ordered Data Transfer
Applications need to send data. Sometimes the data is small—in some cases, a single byte. In 
other cases, for instance, with a ﬁle transfer, the data might be millions of bytes. 
Each different type of data link protocol typically has a limit on the maximum transmission 
unit (MTU) that can be sent. MTU refers to the size of the “data,” according to the data link 
layer—in other words, the size of the Layer 3 packet that sits inside the data ﬁeld of a frame. 
For many data link protocols, Ethernet included, the MTU is 1500 bytes.
TCP handles the fact that an application might give it millions of bytes to send by segmenting 
the data into smaller pieces, called segments. Because an IP packet can often be no more than 
1500 bytes, and because IP and TCP headers are 20 bytes each, TCP typically segments large 
data into 1460 byte (or smaller) segments. 
The TCP receiver performs re-ssembly when it receives the segments. To reassemble the data, 
TCP must recover lost segments, as was previously covered. However, the TCP receiver must 
also reorder segments that arrive out of sequence. Because IP routing can choose to balance 
trafﬁc across multiple links, the actual segments may be delivered out of order. So, the TCP 
NOTE
Some documentation refers to the terms connected and connection-oriented. 
These terms are used synonymously. You will most likely see the use of the term 
connection-oriented in Cisco documentation.

receiver also must perform ordered data transfer by reassembling the data into the original 
order. The process is not hard to imagine: If segments arrive with the sequence numbers 
1000, 3000, and 2000, each with 1000 bytes of data, the receiver can reorder them and no 
retransmissions are required.
You should also be aware of some terminology related to TCP segmentation. The TCP 
header, along with the data ﬁeld, together are called a TCP segment. This term is similar to 
a data link frame and an IP packet, in that the terms refer to the headers and trailers for the 
respective layers, plus the encapsulated data. The term L4PDU also can be used instead of 
the term TCP segment because TCP is a Layer 4 protocol.
TCP Function Summary
Table 6-5 summarizes TCP functions.
The User Datagram Protocol
UDP provides a service for applications to exchange messages. Unlike TCP, UDP is 
connectionless and provides no reliability, no windowing, and no reordering of the received 
data. However, UDP provides some functions of TCP, such as data transfer, segmentation, 
and multiplexing using port numbers, and it does so with fewer bytes of overhead and with 
less processing required.
UDP multiplexes using port numbers in an identical fashion to TCP. The only difference 
in UDP (compared to TCP) sockets is that, instead of designating TCP as the transport 
protocol, the transport protocol is UDP. An application could open identical port numbers 
on the same host but use TCP in one case and UDP in the other—that is not typical, but it

certainly is allowed. If a particular service supports both TCP and UDP transport, it uses the 
same value for the TCP and UDP port numbers, as shown in the assigned numbers RFC 
(currently RFC 1700—see www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1700.txt).
UDP data transfer differs from TCP data transfer in that no reordering or recovery is 
accomplished. Applications that use UDP are tolerant of the lost data, or they have some 
application mechanism to recover lost data. For example, DNS requests use UDP because the 
user will retry an operation if the DNS resolution fails. The Network File System (NFS), a 
remote ﬁle system application, performs recovery with application layer code, so UDP 
features are acceptable to NFS.
Table 6-6 contrasts typical transport layer functions as performed (or not performed) by 
UDP or TCP.
Figure 6-10 shows TCP and UDP header formats. Note the existence of both Source Port and 
Destination Port ﬁelds in the TCP and UDP headers, but the absence of Sequence Number 
and Acknowledgment Number ﬁelds in the UDP header. UDP does not need these ﬁelds 
because it makes no attempt to number the data for acknowledgments or resequencing.

UDP gains some advantages over TCP by not using the Sequence and Acknowledgment 
ﬁelds. The most obvious advantage of UDP over TCP is that there are fewer bytes of 
overhead. Not as obvious is the fact that UDP does not require waiting on acknowledgments 
or holding the data in memory until it is acknowledged. This means that UDP applications 
are not artiﬁcially slowed by the acknowledgment process, and memory is freed more 
quickly.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
The terms connection-oriented and connectionless have some relatively well-known 
connotations inside the world of networking protocols. The meaning of the terms is 
intertwined with error recovery and ﬂow control, but they are not the same. Some basic 
deﬁnitions are in order:
■
Connection-oriented protocol—A protocol either that requires an exchange of messages 
before data transfer begins or that has a required pre-established correlation between 
two endpoints
■
Connectionless protocol—A protocol that does not require an exchange of messages and 
that does not require a pre-established correlation between two endpoints

Operating Cisco Routers
To conﬁgure a Cisco router to route TCP/IP packets, you need to give each interface on 
the router an IP address and subnet mask. You also typically conﬁgure a dynamic routing 
protocol, which discovers the routes in a network. That’s typically all the conﬁguration 
that is required to make a Cisco router route IP packets.
However, Cisco covers many details of router operation on the INTRO exam beyond just 
conﬁguring a few IP addresses and an IP routing protocol. So, before you even get into 
the details of conﬁguring IP on a Cisco router, you need some background information 
on Cisco routers—this chapter covers those details. If you support Cisco routers as part 
of your job, most things in this chapter will be things that you do every day.
Some Cisco switches use a CLI such as Cisco IOS Software—for instance, the 1900 
and 2950 series switches. This chapter covers the IOS CLI on a router, and Chapter 8, 
“Operating Cisco LAN Switches,” covers some details of the IOS CLI on 2950 LAN switches.

The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The ten-question quiz, derived from the major sections in the “Foundation Topics” 
portion of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.

Foundation Topics
The Cisco IOS Software Command-Line Interface
The majority of Cisco routers run Cisco IOS Software. IOS supplies several features, 
including basic connectivity for a variety of protocols, security features for those protocols, 
plus reliable and scalable network services. In short, IOS supplies network services to 
computers that use networked applications.
The exam topics covered in this section will become second nature to you as you work with 
Cisco routers more often.  In this chapter, you will learn about the following three main 
features of Cisco IOS Software: 
■
You must know about the Cisco IOS Software command-line interface (CLI), which is 
the text-based user interface to a Cisco router. 
■
You need to understand the process of how to conﬁgure a router, even though you might 
not know all the commands that you can use to conﬁgure a router. (Later chapters cover 
a variety of conﬁguration commands.) 
■
You need to know about upgrading Cisco IOS Software in a router; upgrading requires 
a reboot of the router, so you also need to know what happens during the boot process. 
By the time you are ﬁnished with your CCNA study, the router CLI and conﬁguration topics 
in this chapter will be second nature, for the most part.
Access to the CLI
Cisco uses the acronym CLI to refer to the terminal user command-line interface to the IOS. 
The term CLI implies that the user is typing commands at a terminal, a terminal emulator, 
or a Telnet connection. 
To access the CLI, use one of three methods, as illustrated in Figure 7-1.
You access the router through the console, through a dialup device through a modem 
attached to the auxiliary port, or by using Telnet. The router has RJ-45 receptacles for both 
the console and the auxiliary port. The cable from the console to a PC requires a special 
eight-wire cable, called a rollover cable, in which pin 1 connects to pin 8 on the other end of 
the cable, pin 2 connects to pin 7, and so on. Figure 7-1 shows the cable pinouts. The modem 
connection from the auxiliary port uses a straight-through cable.

The Cisco IOS Software Command-Line Interface     177
Figure 7-1
CLI Access
From any of the three methods of accessing the router, you enter user exec mode ﬁrst. User 
exec mode, also sometimes called user mode, enables you to look around, but not break 
anything. The passwords shown in Figure 7-1 are not defaults—those passwords would be 
required if the conﬁguration used in Table 7-2 were used. The console, auxiliary, and Telnet 
passwords all are set separately.
Passwords are required for Telnet and auxiliary access as of Cisco IOS Software Release 
12.0, and the exams are based on Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2. However, there are no 
preconﬁgured passwords—therefore, you must conﬁgure passwords for Telnet and auxiliary 
access from the console ﬁrst. 
All Cisco routers have a console port, and most have an auxiliary port. The console port is 
intended for local administrative access from an ASCII terminal or a computer using a 
terminal emulator. The auxiliary port, which is missing on a few models of Cisco routers, is

intended for asynchronous dial access from an ASCII terminal or terminal emulator; the 
auxiliary port often is used for dial backup.
This chapter focuses on the process of using the CLI instead of a particular set of commands. 
However, if you see a command in this chapter, you probably should remember it. In the last 
column of Table 7-2, the ﬁrst command in each conﬁguration is a context-setting command, 
as described later in this chapter. But, as you see, the second and third commands would be 
ambiguous if you did not supply some additional information, such as whether the password 
command was for the console, aux, or Telnet. The login command actually tells the router 
to display a password prompt. The password commands specify the text password to be 
typed by the user to gain access. Sometimes network engineers choose to set all three 
passwords to the same value because they all let you get into user mode.
Several concurrent Telnet connections to a router are allowed. The line vty 0 4 command 
signiﬁes that this conﬁguration applies to vtys (virtual teletypes/terminals) 0 through 4. 
Originally, IOS allowed for only these ﬁve vtys, unless the router was also a dial access server, 
such as a Cisco AS5300. At IOS Version 12.2, 16 vtys are allowed by default on all models 
of routers. Regardless, all the conﬁgured vtys typically have the same password, which is handy 
because users connecting to the router through Telnet cannot choose which vty they get. 
User exec mode is one of two command exec modes in the IOS user interface. Enable mode 
(also known as privileged mode or privileged exec mode) is the other. Enable mode is so named 
because the enable command is used to reach this mode, as shown in Figure 7-2; privileged mode 
earns its name because powerful, or privileged, commands can be executed there.
Figure 7-2
User and Privileged Modes
NOTE
On occasion, a network engineer might set the last vty to use a different password 
that no one else knows; that way, when all the other vtys are in use and that network 
engineer Telnets to the router, he can use the password only he knows—and always get 
access to the router.

CLI Help Features
If you printed the IOS Command Reference documents, you would end up with a stack of 
paper several feet tall. No one should expect to memorize all the commands—and no one 
does in real life, either. Several very easy, convenient tools can be used to help you remember 
commands and then also save you time typing. As you progress through your Cisco 
certiﬁcations, the exams will cover progressively more commands. However, you should 
know the methods of getting command help. 
Table 7-3 summarizes command-recall help options available at the CLI. Note that, in the ﬁrst 
column, “Command” represents any command. Likewise, “parm” represents a command’s 
parameter. For instance, the third row lists command ?, which means that commands such as 
show ? and copy ? would list help for the show and copy commands, respectively.
When you type the ?, IOS’s CLI reacts immediately; that is, you don’t need to press the Enter key or 
any other keys. The router also redisplays what you typed before the ?, to save you some keystrokes. 
If you press Enter immediately after the ?, IOS tries to execute the command with only the parame-
ters that you have typed so far.
“command” represents any command, not the word command. Likewise, “parm” represents a com-
mand’s parameter, not the word parameter.
The information supplied by using help depends on the CLI mode. For example, when ? is 
typed in user mode, the commands allowed only in privileged exec mode are not displayed. 
Also, help is available in conﬁguration mode; only conﬁguration commands are displayed in 
that mode of operation.
IOS stores the commands that you type in a history buffer, storing ten commands by default. 
You can change the history size with the terminal history size x user exec command, where 
Table 7-3
Cisco IOS Software Command Help
What You Type
The Help You Get
?
Help for all commands available in this mode.
help
Text describing how to get help. No actual command help is given.
Command ?
Text help describing all the ﬁrst parameter options for the command.
com?
A list of commands that start with “com.”
command parm?
This style of help lists all parameters beginning with “parm.” 
(Notice that no spaces exist between parm and the ?.)
command parm<Tab>
If you press the Tab key midword, the CLI either spells the rest of 
this parameter at the command line or does nothing. If the CLI does 
nothing, it means that this string of characters represents more than 
one possible next parameter, so the CLI does not know which to 
spell out.
command parm1 ?
If a space is inserted before the question mark, the CLI lists all the 
next parameters and gives a brief explanation of each.

180     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
x is the number of commands for the CLI to recall; this can be set to a value between 0 and 
256. You then can retrieve commands so that you do not have to retype the commands.  
Table 7-4 lists the commands used to manipulate previously typed commands.
The key sequences in Table 7-4 are part of what Cisco calls enhanced editing mode. IOS 
enables enhanced editing mode by default and has for a long time. However, you can turn 
off these keystrokes with the no terminal editing exec command, and turn them back on with 
the terminal editing command. Why would you bother? Well, occasionally, you might be 
using a scripting language to run commands automatically on the router through a Telnet 
session, and enhanced editing mode sometimes can interfere with the scripts. For the exam, 
just remember that you can enable and disable enhanced editing mode. 
Table 7-4
Key Sequences for Command Edit and Recall
Keyboard Command
What You Get
Up arrow or Ctrl-p
This displays the most recently used command. If it is 
pressed again, the next most recent command appears until 
the history buffer is exhausted. (The p stands for previous.)
Down arrow or Ctrl-n
If you have gone too far back into the history buffer, these 
keys will go forward to the more recently typed commands. 
(The n is for next.)
Left arrow or Ctrl-b
This moves the cursor backward in the currently displayed 
command without deleting characters. (The b stands for 
back.)
Right arrow or Ctrl-f
This moves the cursor forward in the currently displayed 
command without deleting characters. (The f stands for 
forward.)
Backspace
This moves the cursor backward in the currently displayed 
command, deleting characters.
Ctrl-a
This moves the cursor directly to the ﬁrst character of the 
currently displayed command.
Ctrl-e
This moves the cursor directly to the end of the currently 
displayed command.
Esc-b
This moves the cursor back one word in the currently 
displayed command.
Esc-f
This moves the cursor forward one word in the currently 
displayed command.
Ctrl-r
This creates a new command prompt, followed by all the 
characters typed since the last command prompt was 
written. This is particularly useful if system messages 
confuse the screen and it is unclear what you have typed so 
far.

Conﬁguring Cisco IOS Software     181
The debug and show Commands
By far, the most popular single IOS command is the show command. The show command 
has a very large variety of options, and with those options, you can ﬁnd the status of almost 
every feature of IOS. Essentially, the show command lists facts about the router’s operational 
status that the router already knows.
Another less popular command is the debug command. The debug command actually tells 
the router to spend some CPU cycles to do things besides its normal functions, to provide the 
user with more information about what the router is doing. It requires more router CPU 
cycles, but it lets you watch what is happening in a router while it is happening.  
When you use the debug command, IOS creates messages when different events occur and, 
by default, sends them to the console. These messages are called syslog messages. If you have 
used the console of a router for any length of time, you likely have noticed these messages—
and when they are frequent, you probably became a little frustrated. You can view these same 
messages when you have Telnetted to a router by using the terminal monitor command.
Be aware that some debug options create so many messages that the IOS cannot process them 
all, possibly crashing the IOS. You might want to check the current router CPU utilization 
with the show process command before issuing any debug command. You also should know 
that the no debug all command disables all debugs. Before enabling an unfamiliar debug 
command option, issue a no debug all and then issue the debug that you want to use; then 
quickly retrieve the no debug all command using the up arrow or Ctrl-p key sequence. If the 
debug quickly degrades router performance, press Enter immediately, executing the no debug 
all command, to try to prevent the router from crashing. 
Conﬁguring Cisco IOS Software
You must understand how to conﬁgure a Cisco router to succeed on the exam—or to succeed 
in supporting Cisco routers. This section covers the basic conﬁguration processes, including the 
concept of a conﬁguration ﬁle and the locations in which the conﬁguration ﬁles can be stored.
Conﬁguration mode is another mode for the Cisco CLI, similar to user mode and privileged 
mode. User mode allows commands that are not disruptive to be issued, with some 
information being displayed to the user. Privileged mode supports a superset of commands 
compared to user mode, including commands that might harm the router. However, none of 
the commands in user or privileged mode changes the conﬁguration of the router. Conﬁguration 
mode is used to enter conﬁguration commands into the router. Figure 7-3 illustrates the 
relationships among conﬁguration mode, user exec mode, and privileged exec mode.

182     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
Figure 7-3
CLI Conﬁguration Mode Versus Exec Modes
Commands typed in conﬁguration mode update the active conﬁguration ﬁle. These changes 
to the conﬁguration occur immediately each time you press the Enter key at the end of a 
command. Be careful when you type in a conﬁguration command!
Conﬁguration mode itself contains a multitude of subcommand modes. Context-setting 
commands move you from one conﬁguration subcommand mode to another. These context-
setting commands tell the router the topic about which you will type the next few 
conﬁguration commands. More important, they tell the router what commands to list when 
you ask for help. After all, the whole reason for these contexts is to make online help more 
convenient and clear for you. So, if you are confused now, hang on—the next sample will 
clarify what I mean.
The interface command is the most commonly used context-setting conﬁguration command. 
As an example, the CLI user could enter interface conﬁguration mode after typing the 
interface ethernet 0 conﬁguration command. Command help in Ethernet interface 
conﬁguration mode displays only commands that are useful when conﬁguring Ethernet 
interfaces. Commands used in this context are called subcommands—or, in this speciﬁc case, 
interface subcommands. If you have signiﬁcant experience using the CLI in conﬁguration 
mode, much of this will be second nature. From an INTRO exam perspective, recalling 
whether popular commands are global commands or subcommands will be useful, but you 
really should focus on the particular commands covered here. As a side effect, you will learn 
whether the commands are global conﬁguration commands or subcommands. 
NOTE
Context setting is not a Cisco term—it’s just a term used here to help make sense 
of conﬁguration mode.

No set rules exist for what commands are global commands or subcommands. Generally, 
however, when multiple instances of a parameter can be set in a single router, the command 
used to set the parameter is likely a conﬁguration subcommand. Items that are set once for 
the entire router are likely global commands. For instance, the hostname command is a 
global command because there is only one host name per router. The interface ethernet 0 
command is a global conﬁguration command because there is only one such interface in this 
router. Finally, the ip address command is an interface subcommand that sets the IP address 
on the interface; each interface has a different IP address.
Use Ctrl-z from any part of conﬁguration mode (or use the exit command from global 
conﬁguration mode) to exit conﬁguration mode and return to privileged exec mode. The 
conﬁguration mode end command also exits from any point in the conﬁguration mode back 
to privileged exec mode. The exit command backs you out of conﬁguration mode one sub-
conﬁguration mode at a time.
Example Conﬁguration Process
Example 7-1 illustrates how the console password is deﬁned; gives host name, prompt, and 
interface descriptions; and shows the ﬁnished conﬁguration. The lines beginning with ! are 
comment lines that highlight signiﬁcant processes or command lines within the example. The 
show running-conﬁg command output also includes comment lines with just a ! to make the 
output more readable—many comment lines in the examples in this book were added to 
explain the meaning of the conﬁguration. You should remember the process as well as these 
particular commands for the INTRO exam.

The preceding example illustrates the differences between user and privileged modes and 
conﬁguration mode. The conﬁgure terminal command is used to move from priviledged 
mode into conﬁguration mode. The command prompt changes when moving into 
conﬁguration mode, and it also changes based on what you are doing in conﬁguration mode. 
Plus, typing a ? in conﬁguration mode gives you help just on conﬁguration commands.

When you change from one conﬁguration mode to another, the prompt changes. Example 7-2 
repeats the same example as in Example 7-1, but with annotations for what is happening.
IOS also can change the contents of a conﬁguration command that you type. For instance, if 
you type a command and set only default values, IOS typically does not add the command 
to the conﬁguration ﬁle because it is not needed. Also, some commands include passwords 
that the router encrypts for display purposes, so the show running-conﬁg command lists only 
the encrypted form of the password. Example 11-3 shows a couple of examples of commands 
that show up differently in the show running-conﬁg output, as compared to the command 
typed in conﬁguration mode.

When moving from user mode to enable mode, you must type the enable command and 
supply a password. If the enable password command has been used to conﬁgure the 
password, you should type that password. If the enable secret command has been used, as in 
Example 7-3, you should use the enable secret password. If both are conﬁgured, you use the 
enable secret password.
IOS automatically encrypts the enable secret password, as seen in the output of the show 
running-conﬁg command in Example 7-3. The password set with the enable password 
command can be encrypted, but someone wrote a program to decrypt the password back to 
the original clear-text password. Technically, the algorithm used to change the enable secret 
password performs a one-way hash instead of simple encryption, which means that the 
password cannot be decrypted.
The banner motd command is the other command that IOS changes in Example 7-3. The 
banner motd (motd stands for “message of the day”) command causes a text banner to 
display when someone accesses the router from the console, Telnet, or an auxiliary port. The 
banner can span many lines; to know when you stop typing the banner text, the command 
uses a delimeter character. In the example, the # character was used as a delimeter. At the end 
of the line, the Return key was pressed. Then the router added the line that says to keep 
typing the banner and end it with a #. Two more banner lines were added, with the last line 
ending in the delimiter character, telling the router that the banner command was ﬁnished.

The show running-conﬁg output conﬁrms that a three-line banner was added to the 
conﬁguration, but note that the delimeter has been set to ^C. ^C represents Control+c, which 
is an ASCII code that cannot be displayed. The router automatically changes the banner 
command to use ^C as the delimiter.
Router Memory, Processors, and Interfaces
The conﬁguration ﬁle contains the conﬁguration commands that you have typed, as well as 
some conﬁguration commands entered by default by the router. The conﬁguration ﬁle can be 
stored in a variety of places, including two inside a router. The router has a couple of other 
types of memory as well:
■
RAM—Sometimes called DRAM for dynamic random-access memory, RAM is used by 
the router just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage. The running or 
active conﬁguration ﬁle is stored here.
■
ROM—This type of memory (read-only memory) stores a bootable IOS image, which 
typically is not used for normal operation. ROM contains the code that is used to boot 
the router until the router knows where to get the full IOS image or as a backup bootable 
image, in case there are problems.
■
Flash memory—Either an EEPROM or a PCMCIA card, Flash memory stores fully 
functional IOS images and is the default location where the router gets its IOS at boot 
time. Flash memory also can be used to store any other ﬁles, including conﬁguration ﬁles. 
■
NVRAM—Nonvolatile RAM stores the initial or startup conﬁguration ﬁle.
All these types of memory, except RAM, are permanent memory. No hard disk or disk 
storage exists on Cisco routers. Figure 7-4 summarizes the use of memory in Cisco routers.
Figure 7-4
Cisco Router Memory Types
For the sake of consistency, Cisco IOS Software always uses the term interfaces to refer to 
the physical connections to a network. By being consistent, IOS commands familiar on one 
type of Cisco router will be familiar on another. Some nuances are involved in numbering the 
interfaces, however. In some smaller routers, the interface number is a single number. 
However, with some other families of routers, the interface is numbered ﬁrst with the slot in 
which the card resides, followed by a slash and then the port number on that card. For 
example, port 3 on the card in slot 2 would be interface 2/3. Numbering starts with 0 for

card slots and 0 for ports on any card. In some cases, the interface is deﬁned by three 
numbers: ﬁrst the card slot, then the daughter card (typically called a port adapter), and then 
a number for the physical interface on the port adapter. 
Managing Conﬁguration Files
IOS on a router uses a conﬁguration ﬁle for the initial conﬁguration at router startup and the 
active, running conﬁguration ﬁle. The startup conﬁguration ﬁle is in NVRAM; the other ﬁle, 
which is in RAM, is the one that the router uses during operation. When the router ﬁrst 
comes up, the router copies the stored conﬁguration ﬁle from NVRAM into RAM, so the 
running and startup conﬁguration ﬁles are identical at that point. Also, exterior to the router, 
conﬁguration ﬁles can be stored as ASCII text ﬁles anywhere using TFTP or FTP.
Example 7-4 demonstrates the basic interaction between the two ﬁles. In this example, the 
show running-conﬁg and show startup-conﬁg commands are used. These commands display 
the currently used, active, running conﬁguration and the stored, startup conﬁguration used 
when the router boots, respectively. The full command output is not shown; instead, you can 
see only a brief excerpt including the host command, which will be changed several times. 
(Notes are included inside the example that would not appear if you were doing these 
commands on a real router.)

Conﬁguring Cisco IOS Software     189
If you reload the router now, the host name would revert back to hannah. However, if you 
want to keep the changed host name of jessie, you would use the command copy running-
conﬁg startup-conﬁg, which overwrites the current startup-conﬁg ﬁle with what is currently 
in the running conﬁguration ﬁle.
The copy command can be used to copy ﬁles in a router, most typically a conﬁguration ﬁle 
or a new version of the IOS Software. The most basic method for moving conﬁguration ﬁles 
in and out of a router is to use the copy command to copy ﬁles between RAM or NVRAM 
on a router and a TFTP server. The ﬁles can be copied between any pair, as Figure 7-5 
illustrates.
Figure 7-5
Locations for Copying and Results from Copy Operations
The commands can be summarized as follows:
ccccooooppppyyyy    {ttttffffttttpppp    | rrrruuuunnnnnnnniiiinnnngggg----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg    | ssssttttaaaarrrrttttuuuupppp----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg} {ttttffffttttpppp    | rrrruuuunnnnnnnniiiinnnngggg----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg    | ssssttttaaaarrrrttttuuuupppp----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg}
The ﬁrst parameter is the “from” location; the next one is the “to” location. (Of course, 
choosing the same option for both parameters is not allowed.)
The copy command always replaces the existing ﬁle when the ﬁle is copied into NVRAM or 
into a TFTP server. In other words, it acts like the destination ﬁle was erased and the new ﬁle 
completely replaced the old one. 
When the copy command copies a conﬁguration ﬁle into RAM, the conﬁguration ﬁle in 
RAM is not replaced. Effectively, any copy into RAM works just as if you typed the 
commands in the “from” conﬁguration ﬁle in the order listed in the conﬁg ﬁle. In other 
words, it works as if the RAM conﬁguration ﬁle and the newly copied ﬁles were merged.

190     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
So, who cares? Well, we do. If you change the running conﬁg and then decide that you want 
to revert to what’s in the startup-conﬁg ﬁle, the only way to guarantee that is to issue the 
reload command, which reloads, or reboots, the router. 
Three key commands can be used to erase the contents of NVRAM. The write erase and 
erase startup-conﬁg commands are older, whereas the erase nvram: command is the more 
recent, and recommended, command. All three commands simply erase the contents of the 
NVRAM conﬁguration ﬁle. Of course, if the router is reloaded at this point, there is no initial 
conﬁguration.
Viewing the Conﬁguration and Old-Style Conﬁguration Commands
Once upon a time, commands that were used to display and move conﬁguration ﬁles among 
RAM, NVRAM, and TFTP did not use easy-to-recall parameters such as startup-conﬁg and 
running-conﬁg. In fact, most people could not remember the commands or got the different 
ones confused. Figure 7-6 shows both the old and the new commands used to view 
conﬁgurations.
Figure 7-6
Conﬁguration show Commands
Initial Conﬁguration (Setup Mode)
Setup mode leads a router administrator to a basic router conﬁguration by using questions 
that prompt the administrator for basic conﬁguration parameters. Instead of using setup 
mode, a Cisco router can be conﬁgured using the CLI in conﬁguration mode. In fact, most 
networking personnel do not use setup at all, but new users sometimes like to use setup 
mode, particularly until they become more familiar with the CLI conﬁguration mode.
Figure 7-7 and Example 7-5 describe the process used by setup mode. Setup mode is used 
most frequently when the router boots, and it has no conﬁguration in NVRAM. Setup mode 
also can be entered by using the setup command from privileged mode.

Router Setup Conﬁguration Mode (Continued)

194     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
When you are ﬁnished with setup, you select one of three options for what to do next. Option 
2 tells the router to save the conﬁguration to NVRAM and exit; this option is used in 
Example 7-5. The router places the conﬁg in both NVRAM and RAM. This is the only 
operation in IOS that changes both conﬁguration ﬁles to include the same contents based on 
a single action by the user. Options 0 and 1 tell the router to ignore the conﬁguration that 
you just entered and to either exit to the command prompt (option 0) or start over again with 
setup (option 1). You can also abort the setup process before answering all the questions, and 
get to a CLI prompt by pressing CNTL-C.
Upgrading Cisco IOS Software and the Cisco IOS Software Boot 
Process
Engineers need to know how to upgrade the IOS to move to a later release. Typically, a router 
has one IOS image in Flash memory, and that is the IOS that is used. (The term IOS image 
simply refers to a ﬁle containing the IOS.) The upgrade process might include steps such as 
copying a newer IOS image into Flash memory, conﬁguring the router to tell it which IOS image 
to use, and deleting the old one when you are conﬁdent that the new release works well. 
A router decides what IOS image to use when the router boots. Also, to upgrade to a new 
IOS or back out to an older IOS, you must reload the router. So, it’s a convenient time to 
cover the boot sequence and some of the related issues.
Upgrading a Cisco IOS Software Image into Flash Memory
IOS ﬁles typically are stored in Flash memory. Flash memory is rewriteable, permanent 
storage, which is ideal for storing ﬁles that need to be retained when the router loses power. 
Also, because there are no moving parts, there is a smaller chance of failure as compared with 
disk drives, which provides better availability. As you will read soon, IOS can be placed on 
an external TFTP server, but using an external server typically is done for testing—in 
production, practically every Cisco router loads an IOS stored in the only type of large, 
permanent memory in a Cisco router and that is Flash memory.
As Figure 7-8 illustrates, to upgrade an IOS image into Flash memory, you ﬁrst must obtain 
the IOS image from Cisco. Then you must place the IOS image into the default directory of 
a TFTP server. Finally, you must issue the copy command from the router, copying the ﬁle 
into Flash memory. You also can use an FTP server, but the TFTP feature has been around a 
long time and is a more likely topic for the exam.

196     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
During this process of copying the IOS image into Flash memory, the router needs to discover 
several important facts:
1.
What is the IP address or host name of the TFTP server?
2.
What is the name of the ﬁle?
3.
Is space available for this ﬁle in Flash memory?
4.
Does the server actually have a ﬁle by that name?  
5.
Do you want the router to erase the old ﬁles?
The router will prompt you for answers, as necessary. Afterward, the router erases Flash 
memory as needed, copies the ﬁle, and then veriﬁes that the checksum for the ﬁle shows that 
no errors occurred in transmission. The show ﬂash command then can be used to verify the 
contents of Flash memory (see Example 7-7). (The show ﬂash output can vary among router 
families.) Before the new IOS image is used, however, the router must be reloaded.
In some cases, Flash memory can be in read-only mode. That is the case when a router loads 
only part of the IOS into RAM, to conserve RAM. Other parts of the IOS ﬁle are kept in 
Flash memory (Flash memory access time is much slower than RAM’s). In this case, if Flash 
memory must be erased to make room for a new image, the IOS could not continue to run.

Upgrading Cisco IOS Software and the Cisco IOS Software Boot Process     197
So, if the router is running from a portion of IOS in Flash memory, the router must must be 
booted using IOS in ROM. Then the Flash memory is in read/write mode and the erase and 
copy processes can be accomplished. The copy tftp ﬂash command in later releases of the IOS 
actually performs the entire process for you. In earlier releases, you had to boot the router 
from ROM and then issue the copy tftp ﬂash command.
When using the limited-function IOS in ROM, the router is in a mode called Rxboot mode. 
Routers cannot route packets while in Rxboot mode, but it can send and receive IP packets 
like an IP host. So, one of two things must be true for the router to be capable of sending 
packets to the TFTP server. First, the TFTP server could reside on the same subnet as one of 
the interfaces on the router. Alternately, you could conﬁgure a default route on the router, 
pointing to another router that is on one of the same subnets as the router in Rxboot mode.
The name of the IOS ﬁle identiﬁes some basic information about that IOS image, so it is a 
good idea to keep the same ﬁlename when copying the ﬁle into ﬂash. In particular, the ﬁrst 
part of the name implies the router hardware platform. The second part identiﬁes the feature 
set, with individual letters identifying different options—for instance, “j” means the IOS has 
the Enterprise feature set, which contains most features. Finally, the last few digits tell us 
some information about the run-time features—for instance, a “z” means that the ﬁle is 
compressed, and need decompression when being loaded. See www.cisco.com/warp/
customer/620/4.html#image for more information.
The Cisco IOS Software Boot Sequence
Cisco routers perform the same types of tasks that a typical computer performs when you 
power it on or reboot (reload) it. Of course, most of us do not think about these details very 
often. The router performs some somewhat obvious steps, with one of those being tricky—
namely, the process of choosing the location of the software to load and use in the router. 
And that software might not be IOS.
The boot process follows this basic litany:
1.
The router performs a power-on self-test (POST) to discover and verify the hardware.
2.
The router loads and runs bootstrap code from ROM.
3.
The router ﬁnds the IOS or other software and loads it.
4.
The router ﬁnds the conﬁguration ﬁle and loads it into running conﬁg.
All routers attempt all four steps each time that the router is powered on or reloaded. The 
POST code and functions cannot be changed by the router administrator. The location of the 
bootstrap code, the IOS to load, and the conﬁguration ﬁle can be changed by the 
administrator—but you almost always use the default location for the bootstrap code 

198     Chapter 7: Operating Cisco Routers
(ROM) and for the initial conﬁguration (NVRAM). So, the location of IOS or other software 
is the only part that typically is changed. 
Three categories of operating systems can be loaded into the router: 
■
The full-function IOS image that you have already been introduced to in this chapter. 
■
A limited-function IOS that resides in ROM. 
■
A different non-IOS operating system that also is stored in ROM. This operating system, 
called ROM Monitor, or ROMMON, is used for two purposes—for low-level 
debugging and for password recovery. Unless you are performing password recovery, 
you seldom will use ROMMON mode. 
Table 7-5 lists the three operating system categories and their main functions.
You need to tell the router whether to use ROMMON, the limited-function IOS, or the full-
featured IOS. Of course, most of the time you use the full-featured IOS in Flash memory. 
However, you might want to use IOS that resides on a TFTP server, or there could be multiple 
IOS images in Flash memory—and all of these options are conﬁgurable. 
Two conﬁguration tools tell the router what OS to load:
■
The conﬁguration register
■
The boot system conﬁguration command
First, the conﬁguration register tells the router whether to use a full-featured IOS, 
ROMMON, or the limited-feature IOS, which also is called RXBOOT mode. The 
conﬁguration register is a 16-bit software register in the router, and its value is set using the 
conﬁg-register global conﬁguration command. (Some older routers had a hardware 
conﬁguration register with jumpers on the processor card, to set bits to a value of 0 or 1.) 
On most Cisco routers, the default Conﬁguration Register setting is hexadecimal 2102.

Upgrading Cisco IOS Software and the Cisco IOS Software Boot Process     199
Figure 7-9 shows an example binary breakdown of the default value for the conﬁguration 
register, which is hexadecimal 2102.
Figure 7-9
Binary Version of Conﬁguration Register, Value Hex 2102
The boot ﬁeld is the name of the low-order 4 bits of the conﬁguration register. This ﬁeld can 
be considered a 4-bit value, represented as a single hexadecimal digit. (Cisco represents 
hexadecimal values by preceding the hex digit[s] with 0x—for example, 0xA would mean a 
single hex digit A.) If the boot ﬁeld is hex 0, ROMMON is loaded. If the boot ﬁeld is hex 1, 
RXBOOT mode is used. For anything else, it loads a full-featured IOS. But which one?
The second method used to determine where the router tries to obtain an IOS image is 
through the use of the boot system conﬁguration command. If the conﬁguration register calls 
for a full-featured IOS (boot ﬁeld 2-F), the router reads the startup-conﬁguration ﬁle for boot 
system commands. If there are no boot system commands, the router takes the default action, 
which is to load the ﬁrst ﬁle in Flash memory. Table 7-6 summarizes the use of the 
conﬁguration register and the boot system command at initialization time, when the boot 
ﬁeld’s value implies that the router will look for boot commands.

Routers have four types of memory:
■
RAM—Sometimes called DRAM for dynamic random-access memory, RAM is used by 
the router just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage. The running or 
active conﬁguration ﬁle is stored here.
■
ROM—This type of memory (read-only memory) stores a bootable IOS image, which 
typically is not used for normal operation. ROM contains the code that is used to boot 
the router until the router knows where to get the full IOS image or as a backup bootable 
image, in case there are problems.

■
Flash memory—Either an EEPROM or a PCMCIA card, Flash memory stores fully 
functional IOS images and is the default location where the router gets its IOS at boot 
time. Flash memory also can be used to store conﬁguration ﬁles on some Cisco routers.
■
NVRAM—Nonvolatile RAM stores the initial or startup conﬁguration ﬁle.
The copy command is used to move conﬁguration ﬁles among RAM, NVRAM, and a TFTP 
server. The ﬁles can be copied between any pair. The commands can be summarized as 
follows:
ccccooooppppyyyy    {ttttffffttttpppp    | rrrruuuunnnnnnnniiiinnnngggg----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg    | ssssttttaaaarrrrttttuuuupppp----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg} {ttttffffttttpppp    | rrrruuuunnnnnnnniiiinnnngggg----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg    | ssssttttaaaarrrrttttuuuupppp----ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg}

C H A P T E R 8
Operating Cisco LAN Switches
Cisco’s LAN switch revenue surpassed router revenues about the time that the CCNA 
certiﬁcation was ﬁrst announced back in 1998, so there is little doubt about the 
importance of LAN switches to Cisco. Also, the vast majority of end-user devices connect 
to a network by connecting to a LAN switch. So, it’s no surprise that the CCNA 
certiﬁcation exams cover switching concepts extensively. 
Cisco uses two major alternatives for LAN switch operating systems. Also, each model 
series of switches from Cisco has several differences in the commands used, as compared 
with other Cisco switches that even use the same operating system. Conversely, Cisco 
routers all use a single operating system, called Cisco IOS Software, and the commands 
work the same on every router. So, Cisco can easily cover router conﬁguration on the 
CCNA exams, without having to force everyone studying for the CCNA certiﬁcation to 
use a particular model of router. However, covering such a wide variety of switch product 
lines, each with its own quirks for conﬁguration, makes testing about LAN switch 
conﬁguration difﬁcult.
This chapter covers the basics of conﬁguring 2950 series LAN switches. The 2950 uses a 
CLI IOS-like, with several commands in common with router IOS. However, many 
commands differ, and a few of the processes of how to do things on the 2950 differ from 
a router. So, this chapter points out the similarities with routers, but only brieﬂy because 
Chapter 7, “Operating Cisco Routers,” already covered those details. Where 2950s act 
differently, this chapter goes into more depth.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
NOTE
For those of you still working on the outdated 1900 series switches, the ICND 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Appendix E, contains coverage of the 1900 series switch 
CLI and commands.

The goal of self-assessment is to gauge your mastery of the topics in this 
chapter. If you do not know the answer to a question or are only partially sure of the 
answer, you should mark this question wrong for purposes of the self-assessment. Giving 
yourself credit for an answer that you correctly guess skews your self-assessment results 
and might provide you with a false sense of security.

Foundation Topics
Navigating Through a Cisco 2950 Switch
You can buy a Cisco 2950 switch or any other model of Cisco switch, turn on the power, and 
plug in the Ethernet cables to your computers, and the LAN you just created typically works 
just ﬁne. There is no need to ever perform any speciﬁc conﬁguration on the switch. However, 
you will probably want to conﬁgure the switch and possibly investigate and troubleshoot 
problems when they occur. So, knowing how to conﬁgure and troubleshoot a switch can help 
you in almost any networking job.
The nice advantage when learning about the 2950 series of Cisco switches is that many of 
the details of how they operate are just like those of a router. Of course, a switch does things 
differently than a router, but the basics—how to access the switch, how to conﬁgure it, and 
so on—pretty much work like a router. So, this chapter covers the similarities with routers 
only brieﬂy, but gives you more detail about anything unique to using the switches. 
The ﬁrst section of this chapter focuses on the features, functions, and processes used to 
install, conﬁgure, and operate a 2950 switch. It starts with the basic 2950 series of switches 
and how to perform some simple initial conﬁguration. After that, you will learn how to 
access the switch command-line interface (CLI). When you are in the CLI, you can conﬁgure 
the switch, issue commands to ﬁnd out how the switch is working, and update the software 
in the switch. 
The second section of this chapter focuses on the basic commands used to conﬁgure and 
operate the 2950 series of switches.  
2950 Series Features and Functions
Cisco produces a wide variety of switch families. Inside each family are several speciﬁc 
models of switches. Cisco positions the 2950 series of switches as a full-featured, low-cost 
wiring closet switch. That means that you would expect to use this switch as the connection 
point for end-user devices, with cabling running from desks to the wiring closet. You would 
also use a couple of Ethernet ports to connect to other switches to provide connectivity 
between the wiring closet and the rest of the network.
Figure 8-1 shows one model of a 2950 switch, the 2950-24-EI switch, which provides 24 
10/100 Ethernet interfaces and two Gigabit interfaces.

214     Chapter 8: Operating Cisco LAN Switches
Figure 8-1
2950-24-EI Switch
This particular model comes with 24 built-in 10/100 ports using RJ-45 connectors. Any of 
the ports can be used to connect to end-user devices or to other switches. This switch also 
includes two Gigabit Ethernet slots, on the right side of the ﬁgure, into which you can put 
the appropriate Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC). You will read more about GBICs in 
Chapter 11, “LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies.”
Switch commands refer to the the physical RJ-45 Ethernet connectors on a 2950 as 
interfaces. Each interface has a number in the style x/y, where x and y are two different 
numbers. On a 2950, the number before the / is always 0. The ﬁrst interface is numbered 0/1, the 
second is 0/2, and so on. 
2950 Switch Operating System
Cisco switch operating systems can be categorized into two types: Internetwork Operating 
System (IOS) switches, and Catalyst Operating System (Cat OS) switches. When Cisco ﬁrst 
entered the LAN switching arena, it did so by acquiring Crescendo Communications, which 
at the time, sold a line of switches called Catalyst switches. At the time of acquisition, Cisco 
already had sold a lot of routers, and, not surprisingly, those routers had a different user 
interface compared to Crescendo’s switches. So, Cisco was faced with a dilemma: Should it 
update all the Crescendo Catalyst switches to use a user interface like the routers? Should it 
just continue to use the Crescendo Catalyst OS, now typically called the Cat OS, and that 
alone, on all future switches? The answer: Some Cisco switches use the Cat OS CLI, and 
some use the IOS CLI.
Cisco IOS switches use the same CLI as the router IOS. Even though the switches have a 
similar look and feel to the router IOS, they do not actually run the same IOS as the routers 
because switches and routers do not share a lot of the same functions and features. For 
instance, Cisco calls the 2950 operating system the 2950 switch software instead of IOS. 
However, because the look and feel of the user interface resembles the router IOS interface, 
most people simply call the 2950, and other switches that use the same CLI, IOS-based 
switches.  

Navigating Through a Cisco 2950 Switch     215
Accessing the Cisco 2950 Switch CLI
The 2950 CLI works just like the router IOS CLI. Some of the commands you use are 
different because switches perform different tasks than routers, but the process and the look 
and feel are the same. For instance:
■
It uses user exec and priviledged (enable) exec modes.
■
It uses the enable and disable commands to move between the two.
■
It uses a console password and telnet (vty) password, conﬁgured just like a router.
■
It uses an enable secret or just plain enable password, with the enable secret password 
taking precedence if both are conﬁgured.
■
It uses the same editing keystrokes that allow you to retrieve previous commands and 
change the commands.
Only a few minor differences exist between 2950 switches and routers relating to how to 
access the switch and use the CLI. The ﬁrst difference is that there is no auxiliary port on a 
switch. Figure 8-2 shows the two basic access methods—console and Telnet.
Figure 8-2
2950 CLI Access
Notice that the same console cable (rollover cable) is used for the switch as well as the router.
The only other big difference between the CLI in a router and a 2950 switch is that the 
commands listed when you ask for help are different. The process is the same—type a ? 
whenever you need help, and commands and parameters are listed, depending on where you 
are when you type the ?.

Switch Initialization
A switch initializes when it is powered on. Like all computers, it performs some basic checks 
to discover what kind of hardware is installed, what is working, and what is not, and then it 
proceeds to load the operating system if enough of the hardware is in working order.
You should be aware of a couple of different things that can happen at switch initialization. 
First, you should at least know the basics of how a 2950 switch tells you its status during 
initialization by lighting the LEDs on the front panel of the switch. This process differs from 
what a router does at initialization. Second, you should be aware of the initial conﬁguration 
dialogue, which works very similarly to the router initial conﬁguration dialogue, with some 
minor differences.
Switch LEDs During POST
Power-On Self Test (POST) deﬁnes the series of steps that a device goes through to test the 
hardware and ﬁnd out what is working before moving on to loading the operating system. 
POST processing is performed by boot code that is loaded into ROM. 
Because a full operating system has not yet been loaded when the switch performs POST, it 
needs a way to tell the human user if POST worked well, if it failed partly, or if the switch is 
totally unusable. To communicate the status, the switch uses the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
on the front panel of the switch. During POST, these LEDs have one set of meanings; during 
normal operation, the LEDs are used for other purposes.
Figure 8-3 shows a representation of the front left part of a 2950 switch, with LEDs shown.
Figure 8-3
2950 Front Panel and LEDs
During POST, the switch varies the lights on the LEDs to imply what is happening. For 
instance, as do most devices, the switch starts by turning all the LEDs green for a moment, 
just so you can know whether the LEDs are working. On the 2950, if the system LED turns 
amber, the switch failed POST, meaning that it has a problem that prevents it from even 
bringing up the switch operating system. (Solid green on the system LED means all is well.)

Switch Initialization     217
The redundant power supply (RPS) LED identiﬁes whether an RPS is installed, whether it is 
working, and so on. The 2950 does not have space inside the switch for an RPS, but it does 
allow the switch to connect to an external RPS. The LED color (green or amber), plus 
whether the LED is either on or ﬂashing, tells you the status of an RPS.
Each physical port has a single LED associated with it. The meaning of those LEDs depends 
on which of the four port mode LEDs are lit—the stat, util, duplex, and speed LEDs. The 
mode button toggles the switch among the four settings, each time changing the mode from 
stat to util, or util to duplex, and so on. For instance, if the stat LED is on, each port LED 
shows a solid green light if the respective Ethernet links are working, and a ﬂashing green 
when trafﬁc is being sent across the links. If the duplex LED is lit, then the port LEDs are 
green if the port is using full duplex, and are not lit if using half duplex.
Table 8-2 lists the LEDs and some of their meanings.
Table 8-2
2950 Switch LEDs and Meaning
LED
Use and Meaning
System
OFF: Powered off
GREEN: Up and working
AMBER: POST failure
RPS
This signals the existence of RPS, the status of RPS, and the status of main 
power.
Port LEDs
Each port has a single LED, whose meaning is interpreted based on which of 
the four MODE leds is lit.
Mode button
When pressed, this button changes from one of four states: stat, util, duplex, 
and speed. The current mode is shown by the green LED beside only one of 
the four words stat, util, duplex, and speed.
Stat
When stat is green, each port LED shows the working status of the port. 
Green means functional, off means not functional, and ﬂashing green shows 
link activity.
Util
This uses the combined port LEDs to give an indication of overall switch 
utilization. The more port LEDs are lit, the more switch utilization is 
occurring.
Duplex
The port LEDs show solid green if full duplex, and off if half duplex.
Speed
For 10/100 ports, the LED shows solid green if running 100 Mbps, and off if 
running 10 Mbps.

218     Chapter 8: Operating Cisco LAN Switches
Initial Conﬁguration Mode
The 2950 switch OS uses the same concepts of an initial conﬁguration dialogue as does a 
router. When the switch initializes and ﬁnds no conﬁguration ﬁle in NVRAM, it presents the 
console user with a question, asking whether to enter the initial conﬁguration dialogue.
The only real difference between the router initial conﬁguration dialogue and the 2950 
switch initial conﬁguration dialogue is in the things the switch lets you conﬁgure. Otherwise, 
the process is identical. Example 8-1 shows an example dialogue.

As you can see from the example, the process works very much like router setup mode.
Conﬁguring 2950 IOS Software
The conﬁguration process and the conﬁguration ﬁles used are identical when comparing the 
router IOS behavior and a 2950 switch. So there is nothing more to learn compared with 
the router IOS. In other words, the following are true:
■
You use the conﬁgure terminal command from enable mode to enter conﬁguration 
mode.
■
Your conﬁguration commands change the conﬁguration of the switch the instant you 
press Enter at the end of each command.
■
The help shown in conﬁguration mode changes, depending on what conﬁguration 
submode you are in.
■
The copy running-conﬁg startup-conﬁg exec command saves the conﬁguration to the 
permanent conﬁguration ﬁle in NVRAM.
■
The startup-conﬁg ﬁle is stored in NVRAM, and the switch OS is stored in Flash.
■
All the variations of the copy command work just like they do on a router.
If you do not remember these details, just turn back to Chapter 7 and review the major 
heading titled, “Conﬁguring Cisco IOS Software,” for more information.

Foundation Summary     221
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
INTRO exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
The 2950 CLI works just like the router IOS. Some of the commands that you use are 
different because switches perform different tasks than routers, but the process and the look 
and feel are the same. For instance:
■
It uses user exec and priviledged (enable) exec modes.
■
It uses the enable and disable commands to move between the two.
■
It uses a console password and Telnet (vty) password, conﬁgured just like a router.
■
It uses an enable secret or just plain enable password, with the enable secret password 
taking precedence if both are conﬁgured.
■
It uses the same editing keystrokes that allow you to retrieve previous commands and 
change the commands.
Only a few minor differences exist between 2950 switches and routers relating to how to 
access the switch and use the CLI. The ﬁrst difference is that there is no auxiliary port on a 
switch. The other is that the commands used on the switch can be different from those used 
on a router because switches perform different functions than do routers. 
To access the 2950 switch CLI, you can use one of two methods, as illustrated in Figure 8-4.

Cisco LAN Switching Basics
Cisco switches can perform the functions detailed in this chapter without any 
conﬁguration. You can buy several switches, turn on the power, and cable the devices to 
the switch—and everything works! So, if the CCNA INTRO exam wanted to test you 
about only things you have to do to a switch to get it working, you would not even need 
this chapter.
Of course, Cisco wants you to know how switches work. Not only is that necessary for 
the CCNA exams, but it also helps you in a job as a network engineer. So, in this chapter, 
you will learn about bridges and switches and how they are both similar and different. 
You will learn how switches operate. You will also learn about a few related concepts, 
such as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which is used to prevent Ethernet frames from 
looping around the network.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The 12-question quiz, derived from the major sections in “Foundation Topics” portion 
of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.

The Case for Bridging and Switching
To appreciate the need for LAN switches and the logic behind LAN switches, you must learn 
about devices called transparent bridges. Vendors began offering transparent bridges in the 
marketplace long before switches. And because switches act like bridges in many ways, it 
helps your understanding of switches to ﬁrst understand how bridges work and why they 
were created in the ﬁrst place. 
To appreciate the need for bridges, you must be reminded of the state of Ethernet networking 
before bridges came along. Once upon a time, there was no such thing as an Ethernet LAN. 
Then Ethernet was created, using a single electrical bus, and was cabled using coaxial cables 
between the Ethernet cards in the devices that needed to attach to the Ethernet. 
As mentioned in Chapter 3, “Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs,” 10BASE-T 
was the next step in the development of Ethernet. 10BASE-T improved the availability of a 
LAN because a problem on a single cable did not affect the rest of the LAN, which did 
happen on 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 networks. 10BASE-T allowed the use of unshielded 
twisted-pair (UTP) cabling, which is much cheaper than coaxial cable. Also, many buildings 
already had UTP cabling installed for phone service, so 10BASE-T quickly became a popular 
alternative to 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 Ethernet networks. 
Figure 9-1 depicts the typical topology for 10BASE2 and for 10BASE-T.
Figure 9-1
10BASE2 and 10BASE-T Physical Topologies
When transparent bridges ﬁrst were introduced, Ethernet networks were either 10BASE5, 
10BASE2, or 10BASE-T. Each of these three types of Ethernet had some common 
characteristics that drove the need for a bridging device:

The Case for Bridging and Switching     235
■
Any device sending a frame could have the frame collide with a frame sent by any other 
device attached to that LAN segment.
■
Only one device could send a frame at a time, so the devices were sharing the 10-Mbps 
bandwidth.
■
Broadcasts sent by one device would be heard by all other devices on the LAN.
When these three types of Ethernet ﬁrst were introduced, a shared 10-Mbps of bandwidth 
was a huge amount of bandwidth! Before the introduction of LANs, people often used dumb 
terminals, with a 56-kbps WAN link being a really fast connection to the rest of the 
network—with that 56-kbps being shared among everyone in the building. So, getting to put 
your computer on a 10BASE-T Ethernet LAN was like getting a Gigabit Ethernet connection 
for your PC at your desk at work today—it was more bandwidth than you could imagine 
that you would need.
Over time, the performance of many Ethernet networks started to degrade. People developed 
applications to take advantage of the LAN bandwidth. More devices were added to each 
Ethernet. Eventually, an entire network became congested. The devices on the same Ethernet 
could not send (collectively) more than 10 Mbps of trafﬁc because they were all sharing the 
10 Mbps of bandwidth. However, with the increase in trafﬁc volumes, collisions also 
increased. Long before the overall utilization approached 10 Mbps, Ethernet began to suffer 
because of increasing collisions. 
Bridges solved the growing Ethernet congestion problem in two ways. First, they reduced the 
number of collisions that occur in a network. They also add bandwidth to the network. 
Figure 9-2 shows the basic premise behind an Ethernet transparent bridge.
The top part of the ﬁgure shows a 10BASE-T network before adding a bridge, and the lower 
part shows the network after it has been “segmented” using a bridge. The bridge creates two 
separate collision domains—two different sets of devices for which their frames can collide. 
For instance, Fred’s frames can collide with Barney’s, but they cannot collide with Wilma’s 
or Betty’s. If one LAN segment is busy, and the bridge needs to forward a frame, it simply 
holds the frame until the segment is no longer busy. By reducing collisions and assuming no 
signiﬁcant change in the number of devices or the load on the network, network performance 
is greatly improved.
By adding a bridge between two hubs, the bridge really creates two separate 10BASE-T 
networks, one on the left and one on the right. So, the 10BASE-T network on the left has its 
own 10 Mbps to share, as does the network on the right. So, in this example, the total 
network bandwidth was doubled to 20 Mbps.

236     Chapter 9: Cisco LAN Switching Basics
Figure 9-2
Bridge Creates Two Collision Domains, Two Shared Ethernets
In summary, before bridges were created, 10BASE-T (and 10BASE2 and 10BASE5) network 
performance degraded as more stations and more trafﬁc were introduced into the network. 
With the addition of bridges, an Ethernet network can add more capacity and increase 
performance.
Switches and bridges use the same core logic, as described in the next section of this chapter. 
Instead of using “bridges and switches” every time, I just refer to the devices as “bridges,” 
but switches work the same way. 
Transparent Bridging 
Transparent bridges connect two or more Ethernet networks. By separating the network into 
multiple Ethernets, or multiple LAN segments, transparent bridges overcome some of the 
performance issues covered in the ﬁrst section of this chapter. 
Transparent bridging is called “transparent” because the endpoint devices do not need to 
know that the bridge(s) exist(s). In other words, the computers attached to the LAN do not 
behave any differently in the presence or absence of transparent bridges. Before diving into 
bridging and switching logic, a quick review of a couple of terms about MAC addresses is 
helpful. The following list deﬁnes three terms covered earlier in Chapter 3. These different 
types of MAC addresses can be treated differently by a bridge or switch.

Transparent Bridging     237
The IEEE deﬁnes three general categories of MAC addresses on Ethernet:
■
Unicast addresses—A MAC address that identiﬁes a single LAN interface card. Today 
most cards use the MAC address that is burned in on the card.
■
Broadcast addresses—The most often used of IEEE group MAC address, the broadcast 
address, has a value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (hexadecimal notation). The broadcast address 
implies that all devices on the LAN should process the frame.
■
Multicast addresses—Multicast addresses are used to allow a subset of devices on a LAN 
to communicate. Some applications need to communicate with multiple other devices. 
By sending one frame, all the devices that care about receiving the data sent by that 
application can process the data, and the rest can ignore it. The IP protocol supports 
multicasting, and when IP multicasts over an Ethernet, the multicast MAC addresses 
used by IP follow this format: 0100.5exx.xxxx, where any value can be used in the last 
half of the addresses. 
Transparent bridges forward frames when necessary and do not forward when there is no 
need to do so, thus reducing overhead. To accomplish this, transparent bridges perform three 
actions:
1.
Learning MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each frame received 
by the bridge
2.
Deciding when to forward a frame or when to ﬁlter (not forward) a frame, based on the 
destination MAC address
3.
Creating a loop-free environment with other bridges by using the Spanning Tree Protocol
The Forward Versus Filter Decision
Transparent bridges reduce collisions by forwarding trafﬁc from one segment to the other 
only when necessary. To decide whether to forward a frame, the bridge uses a dynamically 
built table, called a bridge table. The bridge examines the bridging table to decide whether it 
should forward a frame. For example, consider the simple network shown in Figure 9-3, with 
Fred ﬁrst sending a frame to Barney and then one to Wilma.

238     Chapter 9: Cisco LAN Switching Basics
Figure 9-3
Example Transparent Bridging Forwarding and Filtering Decision
The bridge decides to ﬁlter (not forward) the frame that Fred sends to Barney. Fred sends a 
frame with the destination MAC address of 0200.2222.2222, which is Barney’s MAC 
address. The bridge overhears the frame because it is attached to Hub1. The bridge then 
decides what common sense tells you from looking at the ﬁgure—it should not forward the 
frame because Barney, attached to Hub1 as well, already will have received the frame. But 
how does the bridge know to make that decision? The bridge decides to ﬁlter—in other 
words, not forward—the frame because it received the frame on port E0, and it knows that 
Barney’s MAC also is located out E0. 
Conversely, the bridge decides to forward the frame that Fred sends to Wilma in the lower 
part of the ﬁgure. The frame enters the bridge’s E0 interface, and the bridge knows that the 
destination address, 0200.3333.3333, is located somewhere out its E1 interface. So, the 
bridge forwards the frame.

Bridge Table

Transparent Bridging     239
The rules for hub behavior have not changed—whenever a frame is sent toward a hub, the 
hub repeats the frame out every other port.
How Bridges Learn MAC Addresses
Bridges perform three main functions, as mentioned earlier. One of those key functions is to 
learn the MAC addresses in the network to build its bridging table. With a full, accurate 
bridging table, the bridge can make accurate forwarding and ﬁltering decisions.
Bridges build the bridge table by listening to incoming frames and examining the source 
MAC address in the frame. If a frame enters the bridge and the source MAC address is not 
in the bridge table, the bridge creates an entry in the table. The MAC address is placed into the 
table, along with the interface in which the frame arrived. Bridge learning logic is that simple.
Figure 9-4 depicts the same network as Figure 9-3, but before the bridge has built any bridge 
table entries. In the ﬁgure, the ﬁrst two frames sent in this network are shown—ﬁrst a frame 
from Fred, addressed to Barney, followed by Barney’s response, addressed to Fred.
Figure 9-4
Bridge Learning: Empty Table and Adding Two Entries
As seen in the ﬁgure, after Fred sends his ﬁrst frame to Barney, the bridge has an entry for 
0200.1111.1111, Fred’s MAC address, associated with interface E0. When Barney replies at 
Step 2, the bridge adds a second entry, this one for 0200.2222.2222, Barney’s MAC address. 
Learning always occurs by looking at the source MAC address in the frame.

Forwarding Unknown Unicasts and Broadcasts
What do you suppose the bridge did with Fred’s ﬁrst frame in Figure 9-4, the one that 
occurred when there were no entries in the bridging table? As it turns out, when there is no 
matching entry in the table, bridges forward the frame out all interfaces. Bridges were 
designed to forward what are called unknown unicast frames (frames whose destination 
MAC addresses are not yet in the bridging table), with the hope that the unknown device will 
be on some other Ethernet segment and will reply, and the bridge will build a correct entry 
in the bridging table. For instance, in Figure 9-4, the bridge forwards the ﬁrst frame over to 
the right-side Ethernet, even though Barney is not on the right side of the bridge. Later, the 
bridge will ﬁlter a frame sent from Fred to Barney because the bridge would have an entry in 
the bridging table telling the bridge that Barney is also off port E0. 
Bridges also forward LAN broadcasts. LAN broadcasts, by deﬁnition, need to be received by 
all devices on the same LAN. So, the bridge simply forwards broadcasts. Generally, bridges 
also forward LAN multicast frames out all ports, just like they do for broadcasts. However, 
a few multicast features in switches limit the ﬂooding of multicasts, such as Internet Group 
Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping. Bridges never forward trafﬁc out the same interface 
it came in—so, broadcast, multicast, and unkown unicast frames are actually sent out all 
interfaces except the incoming interface.
LAN Switching
Before bridges were created, a 10BASE-T network might have begun to suffer from 
performance problems. As described in the previous section, to improve performance, you 
might have added a two-port bridge, created two LAN segments, doubled the bandwidth, 
reduced collisions, and improved performance.
Now take a step back and think about what might happen to that network with the bridge 
6 months later. More devices have been added to the segments on each side of the bridge. 
More bandwidth-hungry applications have been added. Eventually, both LAN segments 
might become as congested as the original single Ethernet segment was 6 months earlier.
What’s the solution? What about a four-port bridge? The engineer adds the four-port bridge, 
converting the two segments to four segments, again doubling bandwidth, and again 
reducing collisions. A few months later, the number of devices has increased, more 
bandwidth-hungry applications have been added, and you need an eight-port bridge! You 
can see a vicious cycle beginning to occur.
From one perspective, switches are bridges with lots of ports. Switches behave identically to 
transparent bridges in terms of forwarding and learning, but switches typically have many 
more ports and much faster internal processing. So, if a campus network needed to be broken 
into 100 different segments, you could use a switch with 100 ports in it. It would break the 

LAN Switching     241
Ethernet into 100 different collision domains, or segments, and create 100 different sets of 
10-Mbps bandwidth (or more, if Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet were used). It again 
would reduce collisions, just like bridges. In short, switches do the same thing as bridges, 
only faster and better. In fact, an old saying says it best: “Switches are bridges on steroids.”
So, if bridges and switches do the same things the same way, why have two names? There 
were many reasons, none of which matters for the CCNA exams. Today you do not even 
have to choose between buying a bridge or a switch—vendors sell only switches.
The following list provides a quick review of the basic forwarding logic used by a switch or 
bridge: 
1.
A frame is received.
2.
If the destination is a broadcast or multicast, forward on all ports except the port in 
which the frame was received.
3.
If the destination is a unicast and the address is not in the address table, forward on all 
ports except the port in which the frame was received.
4.
If the destination is a unicast and the address is in the address table, and if the associated 
interface is not the interface in which the frame arrived, forward the frame out the one 
correct port.
5.
Otherwise, ﬁlter (do not forward) the frame.
For instance, in Figure 9-5, the network has been migrated to use a switch. The switch’s 
bridging table already has been populated with all the MAC addresses in the network. Fred 
sends another frame to Barney. The switch knows that Barney is located off his E1 port, so 
the switch forwards the frame out E1.

242     Chapter 9: Cisco LAN Switching Basics
Although the basic operation of bridges and switches is identical, switches do differ from 
transparent bridges in some regards. Some of the differences exist just because newer features 
were introduced to the market around the same time that switches became popular. Other 
features, such as the optimized internal processing on switches, do create a signiﬁcant 
advantage to switches over bridges. Practically, the differences do not really matter because 
vendors continue to improve and develop features for switches, whereas it is hard to ﬁnd 
vendors that offer products called bridges anymore. 
Full-Duplex Ethernet
Full-duplex Ethernet was explained back in Chapter 3. Brieﬂy, when a switch port has only 
a single device attached to it, no collisions could possibly occur because there is only one 
connected device. So, the device cabled to that switch port disables its NIC loopback logic, 
allowing the device to both send a frame and receive a frame at the same time.
If a hub with multiple devices is connected to a switch port, collisions still can occur, so half-
duplex operation must be used. Figure 9-6 summarizes the concept.
Figure 9-6
Full Duplex and Half Duplex 
Internal Processing on Cisco Switches
Switches use a couple of different types of internal processing variations. Almost of the more 
recently released switches use store-and-forward processing, but all three types of switching 
are supported in at least one type of currently available Cisco switch. 
Some switches, and transparent bridges in general, use store-and-forward processing. With 
store-and-forward, the entire frame is received by the switch before the ﬁrst bit of the frame 
is forwarded. However, Cisco also offers two other internal processing methods for switches, 
called cut-through and fragment-free.

LAN Switching     243
With store-and-forward processing, the switch must wait for the entire frame to be received. 
However, because the forwarding/ﬁltering logic is based on the destination address, which is 
inside the header, the switch can make the forwarding decision before the entire frame has 
been received. With cut-through processing, the switch starts sending the frame out the 
output port before the whole frame has been received. In other words, as soon as the 
incoming switch port receives enough of the frame to see the destination MAC address, the 
forwarding decision is made and the frame is transmitted out the appropriate outgoing port 
to the destination device. So, each frame might experience slightly less latency. 
Cut-through processing reduces latency, but it also propagates errors. Because the frame 
check sequence (FCS) is in the Ethernet trailer, a cut-through forwarded frame might have 
bit errors in it that the switch will not notice before sending most of the frame. 
Fragment-free processing works similarly to cut-through, but it tries to reduce the number of 
errored frames that it forwards. One interesting fact about Ethernet CSMA/CD logic is that 
collisions should be detected within the ﬁrst 64 bytes of a frame. Fragment-free processing 
works like cut-through logic, but it waits to receive the ﬁrst 64 bytes before forwarding a 
frame. The frames experience less latency than with store-and-forward logic and slightly 
more latency than cut-through—but frames that have errors as a result of collisions are not 
forwarded.
With many links to the desktop running at 100 Mbps, uplinks at 1 Gbps, and faster ASICs, 
today’s switches typically use store-and-forward processing. 
The internal processing algorithms used by switches vary among models and vendors; 
regardless, the internal processing can be categorized as one of the methods listed in Table 9-2.
Table 9-2
Switch Internal Processing
Switching Method
Description
Store-and-forward
The switch fully receives all bits in the frame (store) before forwarding 
the frame (forward). This allows the switch to check the FCS before 
forwarding the frame. (The FCS is in the Ethernet trailer.) 
Cut-through
The switch performs the address table lookup as soon as the 
destination address ﬁeld in the header is received. The ﬁrst bits in the 
frame can be sent out the outbound port before the ﬁnal bits in the 
incoming frame are received. This does not allow the switch to 
discard frames that fail the FCS check. (FCS is in the Ethernet trailer.)
Fragment-free
This performs like cut-through switching, but the switch waits for 64 
bytes to be received before forwarding the ﬁrst bytes of the outgoing 
frame. According to Ethernet speciﬁcations, collisions should be 
detected during the ﬁrst 64 bytes of the frame, so frames in error 
because of a collision will not be forwarded.

244     Chapter 9: Cisco LAN Switching Basics
Speed and Autonegotiation
Ethernet autonegotiation uses a process by which a switch and an Ethernet NIC together 
determine the best combination of parameters for that particular link. To support 
autonegotiation, the switch and the NIC must support multiple speeds, and they also probably 
support both half and full duplex. So, a 10/100 card connected to a switch can negotiate to use 
full-duplex 100 Mbps. If the next switch port is connected to a 10-Mbps-only card that does not 
even support autonegotiation, the switch will use 10 Mbps, half duplex.
Interestingly, a minor debate still pops up in the networking trade press occasionally about 
how reliable the Ethernet autonegotiation process really works. Many people recommend 
that you set the speed and duplex settings on any switch port for which you know the settings 
desired by the device on the other end of the cable. You should understand autonegotiation, 
but in real life, you should consider statically conﬁguring these parameters for switch ports 
connected to servers, switches, and routers.

LAN Segmentation     245
LAN Segmentation
LAN segmentation simply means breaking one LAN into parts, with each part called a 
segment. The term LAN segment comes from the original use of a physical bus with 
10BASE2 and 10BASE5. A single Ethernet segment consisted of the devices connected 
serially with coaxial cable. When 10BASE-T came along, the term segment still was used, this 
time to identify a hub with multiple devices connected to it.
Figure 9-7 repeats an earlier ﬁgure, but with the term segment noted on the ﬁgure.

Segments and Segmentation with a Bridge
With a single hub, or multiple hubs but no bridges, switches, or routers, you have a single 
segment. When you separate the network with a bridge, switch, or router, you create multiple 
segments. So, in Figure 9-7, you can say that the bridge separates the network into two 
separate segments. Many people use the term Ethernet segment very loosely, but for the 
CCNA exams, you can think of segment as meaning the same thing as collision domain.
As mentioned earlier, a collision domain is the set of LAN interfaces whose frames could 
collide with each other, but not with any other devices in the network. The bridge in Figure 9-7 
creates two separate Ethernet segments, and each is a separate collision domain. Figure 9-8 shows 
a typical example of the deﬁnition of collision domains.

Figure 9-8
Collision Domains
Each separate segment, or collision domain, is shown with a dashed-line circle in the ﬁgure. 
The switch on the right has a separate collision domain for each port. The hub near the center 
of the network does not create multiple collision domains because it repeats all frames out 
all ports. Routers also separate LANs into separate collision domains (although that was not 
covered earlier in this chapter.)
Just like the concept of a collision domain relates to where a frame can be sent and where it 
can cause collisions, the concept of a broadcast domain relates to where broadcasts can be 
forwarded. Bridges and switches forward broadcasts and multicasts on all ports. Because 
broadcast frames are sent out all ports, a bridge or switch creates only a single broadcast 
domain. A broadcast domain is the set of devices for which, when one of the devices sends a 
broadcast, all the other devices receive a copy of the broadcast.
Only routers stop the ﬂow of broadcasts. Figure 9-9 provides the broadcast domains for the 
same network depicted in Figure 9-8.
Broadcasts sent by a device in one broadcast domain are not forwarded to devices in another 
broadcast domain. In this example, there are two broadcast domains. For instance, the 
router will not forward a LAN broadcast sent by a PC on the left to the segment on the right. 
In the old days, the term broadcast ﬁrewall described the fact that routers did not forward 
LAN broadcasts.

LAN Segmentation     247
Figure 9-9
Broadcast Domains
General deﬁnitions for a collision domain and a broadcast domain are as follows:
■
A collision domain is a set of network interface cards (NICs) for which a frame sent by 
one NIC could result in a collision with a frame sent by any other NIC in the same 
collision domain.
■
A broadcast domain is a set of NICs for which a broadcast frame sent by one NIC will 
be received by all other NICs in the same broadcast domain.
In short, hubs do not actually segment an Ethernet into multiple segments. Bridges and 
switches do segment an Ethernet into different collision domains, and routers segment an 
Ethernet into different collision and broadcast domains.
The INTRO exam actually might phrase questions in terms of the beneﬁts of LAN 
segmentation instead of just asking for the facts related to collision domains and broadcast 
domains. Table 9-4 lists some of the key beneﬁts. The features in the table should be 
interpreted within the following context: “If I migrated from a single Ethernet segment to a 

248     Chapter 9: Cisco LAN Switching Basics
network with two segments separated by a bridge/switch/router, and if trafﬁc loads and 
destinations stayed constant, the result would be _______.”
*Switches today support several methods to optimize multicast forwarding, such as Internet Group 
Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping
The Need for Spanning Tree
Without the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), frames would loop for an indeﬁnite period of 
time in networks with physically redundant links. To prevent looping frames, STP blocks 
some ports from forwarding frames so that only one active path exists between any pair of 
LAN segments (collision domains). The result of STP is good: Frames do not loop inﬁnitely, 
which makes the LAN usable. However, the network uses some redundant links in case of a 
failure, but not for balancing trafﬁc. 
To avoid loops, all bridging devices, including switches, use STP. STP causes each interface 
on a bridging device to settle into a blocking state or a forwarding state. Blocking means that 
the interface cannot forward or receive data frames. Forwarding means that the interface can 
send and receive data frames. By having a correct subset of the interfaces blocked, a single 
currently active logical path will exist between each pair of LANs.
STP behaves identically for a transparent bridge and a switch. So, the terms bridge, switch, 
and bridging device all are used interchangeably when discussing STP. 
A simple example makes the need for STP more obvious. Remember, switches forward 
frames sent to both unknown unicast MAC addresses and the broadcast address, out all 
interfaces (except the incoming interface). Figure 9-10 shows that a single frame, sent by 
Larry, loops forever because the network has redundancy but no STP.

Figure 9-10
Network with Redundant Links but Without STP: Frame Loops Forever
Larry sends a single unicast frame to Bob’s MAC address, but Bob is powered off, so none 
of the switches has learned Bob’s MAC address yet. Bob’s MAC address would be an 
unknown unicast address at this point in time. Therefore, frames addressed to Bob’s MAC 
address will be forwarded by each switch out every port. These frames will loop forever—or 
at least until time is no more! Because the switches never learn Bob’s MAC address 
(remember, he’s powered off and can send no frames), they keep forwarding the frame out 
all ports, and copies of the frame go around and around. 
Similarly, bridges and switches forward broadcasts on all interfaces, so if any of the PCs sent 
a broadcast, the broadcast would loop indeﬁnitely as well.
One way to solve this problem is to design the LAN with no redundant links. However, most 
network engineers will not design a multiswitch campus LAN without physical redundancy 
between the switches, similar to the network in Figure 9-10. Eventually, a switch or a link 
will fail, and you want the network to still be available. The right solution includes bridged/
switched networks with physical redundancy, using STP to dynamically block some 
interface(s) so that only one active path exists between two endpoints at any instant in time.
How Spanning Tree Works
The Spanning Tree Algorithm places each bridge or switch port into either a forwarding state 
or a blocking state. All the ports in the forwarding state are considered to be in the current 
spanning tree. The collective set of forwarding ports creates a single path over which frames 
are sent between Ethernet segments. Switches can forward frames out ports and receive 
frames in ports that are in a forwarding state; switches do not forward frames out ports and 
receive frames in ports that are in a blocking state.

Figure 9-11 shows a simple STP tree with one port on SW3 in a blocking state.
Figure 9-11
Network with Redundant Links, with STP
Now when Larry sends a frame to Bob’s MAC address, the frame does not loop. SW1 sends 
a copy to SW3, but SW3 does not forward the frame to SW2 out its port 0/27 because that 
interface is blocking. STP’s job is to ﬁgure out how to put the correct interfaces into blocking 
and forwarding states to prevent loops but allow frames to be sent between every segment. 
The process itself is not too difﬁcult. First, STP uses Hello messages, also called Bridge 
Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). Each switch and bridge claims to be the root bridge, and the 
one with the lowest bridge ID is elected root. The 8-byte bridge ID is the combination of a 
priority (2-byte) and a MAC address on the switch (6-byte). STP places all ports on the root 
switch into a forwarding state. In Figure 9-11, SW1 became the root switch.
The root bridge continually sends Hello BPDUs. Each nonroot switch receives the Hellos, 
changes a few ﬁelds, and forwards out all ports. One of the ﬁelds that is changed is called 
cost. This cost ﬁeld, in which each switch increments before forwarding the Hello message, 
helps the nonroot bridges decide how good a particular path is to the root bridge. A switch 
that receives a Hello that has been forwarded by ten other switches probably has a higher 
cost than a Hello received directly from the root switch, for instance.
Each switch decides which of its interfaces is this switch’s root port. The root port of each 
switch is placed into a forwarding state. To decide which port is the root port, the switch 
compares the cost value in all the Hello messages that it receives via different physical paths to 
the root bridge. The interface that received the least-cost Hello message is that switch’s root port. 
In Figure 9-11, SW2's 0/26 interface and SW3's 0/26 interface became their respective root ports.
Finally, each LAN segment has an STP designated bridge on that segment. Many switches 
can attach to the same Ethernet segment. The switch with the lowest administrative cost from 
itself to the root bridge, as compared to the other bridges attached to the same segment, is the 
designated bridge for that segment. The interface that the switch uses to connect to that segment 
is called the designated port for that segment; that port is placed into a forwarding state. In Figure 
9-11, SW2's 0/27 interface became the designated port on the segment between SW2 and SW3.

STP places all other ports into a blocking state. In Figure 9-11, the only port that had not 
been placed into a forwarding state was SW3's 0/27 interface, so it was placed into a 
blocking state.
Table 9-5 summarizes the reasons why STP places a port in forwarding or blocking state.
STP uses a couple of port states besides forwarding and blocking. 
■
Listening—Listens to incoming Hello messages to ensure that there are no loops, but 
does not forward trafﬁc or learn MAC addresses on the interface. This is an interim state 
between blocking and forwarding.
■
Learning—Still listens to BPDUs, plus learns MAC addresses from incoming frames. It 
does not forward trafﬁc. This is an interim state between blocking and forwarding.
■
Disabled—Administratively down. 
Under normal operation, when a port needs to change from blocking to forwarding, it ﬁrst 
transitions to listening, then learning, and then forwarding. This process, with default timers, 
takes around 50 seconds.
STP might seem a bit overwhelming at this point. You should key on the general concepts, 
and the interface states, for the INTRO exam. Refer to Chapter 2, “Spanning Tree Protocol,” 
of the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide for a detailed discussion on STP.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
Transparent bridges forward frames when necessary and do not forward when there is no need 
to do so, thus reducing overhead. To accomplish this, transparent bridges perform three actions:
1.
Learning MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each frame received 
by the bridge
2.
Deciding when to forward a frame or when to ﬁlter (not forward) a frame, based on the 
destination MAC address
3.
Creating a loop-free environment with other bridges by using the Spanning Tree Protocol
The following list provides a quick review of the basic logic used by a switch or bridge: 
1.
A frame is received.
2.
If the destination is a broadcast or multicast, forward on all ports except the port in 
which the frame was received.
3.
If the destination is a unicast and the address is not in the address table, forward on all 
ports except the port in which the frame was received.
4.
If the destination is a unicast and the address is in the address table, and if the associated 
interface is not the interface in which the frame arrived, forward the frame out the one 
correct port.
5.
Otherwise, ﬁlter (do not forward) the frame.
The internal processing algorithms used by switches vary among models and vendors; 
regardless, the internal processing can be categorized as one of the methods listed in Table 9-6.

General deﬁnitions for a collision domain and a broadcast domain are as follows:
■
A collision domain is a set of network interface cards (NICs) for which a frame sent by 
one NIC could result in a collision with a frame sent by any other NIC in the same

Switch Internal Processing
Switching Method
Description
Store-and-forward
The switch fully receives all bits in the frame (store) before 
forwarding the frame (forward). This allows the switch to check the 
FCS before forwarding the frame. (The FCS is in the Ethernet trailer.) 
Cut-through
The switch performs the address table lookup as soon as the 
destination address ﬁeld in the header is received. The ﬁrst bits in the 
frame can be sent out the outbound port before the ﬁnal bits in the 
incoming frame are received. This does not allow the switch to 
discard frames that fail the FCS check. (The FCS is in the Ethernet 
trailer.)
Fragment-free
This performs like cut-through switching, but the switch waits for 64 
bytes to be received before forwarding the ﬁrst bytes of the outgoing 
frame. According to Ethernet speciﬁcations, collisions should be 
detected during the ﬁrst 64 bytes of the frame, so frames in error 
because of a collision will not be forwarded.

Virtual LANs and Trunking
It’s hard to be a networker today and not work with virtual LANs (VLANs) and VLAN 
trunking. Almost every campus LAN uses VLANs, and almost every campus LAN with 
more than one switch uses trunking. In short, you have to know these topics.
VLANs allow a switch to separate different physical ports into different groups so that 
trafﬁc from devices in one group never gets forwarded to the other group. This allows 
engineers to build networks that meet their design requirements, without having to buy 
a different switch for each group. Also, multiple switches can be connected together, with 
trafﬁc from multiple VLANs crossing the same Ethernet links, using a feature called 
trunking.

Virtual LAN Concepts     263
Foundation Topics
Virtual LAN Concepts
Before understanding VLANs, you must ﬁrst have a very speciﬁc understanding of the 
deﬁnition of a LAN. Although you can think about LANs from many perspectives, one 
perspective in particular will help you with understanding VLANs:
A LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. 
As described in Chapter 9, “Cisco LAN Switching Basics,” a broadcast domain includes the 
set of all LAN connected devices that can send a broadcast frame, and all the other devices 
in the same LAN get a copy of the frame. So, you can think of a LAN and a broadcast domain 
as being basically the same thing.
Without VLANs, a switch treats all interfaces on the switch as being in the same broadcast 
domain—in others words, all connected devices are in the same LAN. With VLANs, a switch 
can put some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another. Essentially, the 
switch creates multiple broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by 
the switch are called virtual LANs. 
This chapter focuses on VLANs and the concepts and conﬁguration required to implement 
VLANs on Cisco switches. This chapter covers VLAN concepts, including VLAN trunking. 
Also, you will read about what types of devices can be used to forward trafﬁc between 
different VLANs. 
VLAN Basics
A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a broadcast domain created by one or more switches. The switch 
creates a VLAN simply by putting some interfaces in one VLAN and some in another. So, 
instead of all ports on a switch forming a single broadcast domain, the switch separates them 
into many, based on conﬁguration. It’s really that simple. 
The ﬁrst two ﬁgures in this chapter compare two networks. First, before VLANs existed, if 
a design speciﬁed two separate broadcast domains, two switches would be used—one for 
each broadcast domain, as shown in Figure 10-1.

264     Chapter 10: Virtual LANs and Trunking
Figure 10-1
Example Network with Two Broadcast Domains and No VLANs
Alternately, you can create multiple broadcast domains using a single switch. Figure 10-2 
shows the same two broadcast domains as in Figure 10-1, now implemented as two different 
VLANs on a single switch.
Figure 10-2
Example Network with Two VLANs Using One Switch
In a network as small as the one in Figure 10-2, you might not really need to use VLANs. 
However, there are many motivations for using VLANs, including these:
■
To group users by department, or by groups that work together, instead of by physical 
location
■
To reduce overhead by limiting the size of each broadcast domain
■
To enforce better security by keeping sensitive devices on a separate VLAN
■
To separate specialized trafﬁc from mainstream trafﬁc—for example, putting IP 
telephones on a separate VLAN from user PCs
Creating VLANs
Switches normally deﬁne VLANs in terms of which ports are in each VLAN. You literally 
conﬁgure something as simply as “interface 0/1 is in VLAN 1” and “interface 0/2 is in VLAN 33.” 
Port-based VLANs, the typical choice for conﬁguring VLANs in a switch, can be done very

Trunking with ISL and 802.1q     265
easily, without needing to know the MAC address of the device. However, you need good 
documentation to make sure that you cable the right devices into the right switch port, 
thereby putting them in the right VLANs.
A rarely used alternative for creating VLANs is to group devices into a VLAN based on MAC 
address. The engineer would discover all the MAC addresses of all the devices and then 
would conﬁgure the MAC addresses in the various switches, associating each MAC address 
with a VLAN. When a device moves to a different switch port and sends a frame, the device 
stays in the same VLAN. This allows devices to move around more easily. However, the 
administrative overhead of conﬁguring the MAC address of the devices can be a large 
administrative chore, so this option is seldom used.
Trunking with ISL and 802.1q
When using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, you need to use 
VLAN trunking between the switches. When sending a frame to another switch, the switches 
need a way to identify the VLAN from which the frame was sent. With VLAN trunking, the 
switches tag each frame sent between switches so that the receiving switch knows which 
VLAN the frame belongs to. Figure 10-3 outlines the basic idea.
Figure 10-3
VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches
With trunking, you can support multiple VLANs that have members on more than one 
switch. For instance, when Switch1 receives a broadcast from a device in VLAN1, it needs 
to forward the broadcast to Switch2. Before sending the frame, Switch1 adds another header 
to the original Ethernet frame; that new header has the VLAN number in it. When Switch2 
receives the frame, it sees that the frame was from a device in VLAN1, so Switch2 knows 
that it should forward the broadcast only out its own interfaces in VLAN1.

266     Chapter 10: Virtual LANs and Trunking
Cisco switches support two different trunking protocols, Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE 
802.1q. They both provide basic trunking, as shown in Figure 10-3. They do have some 
differences, as will be covered next.
Cisco ISL
Cisco created ISL before the IEEE standardized a trunking protocol. Because ISL is Cisco 
proprietary, it can be used only between two Cisco switches. ISL fully encapsulates each 
original Ethernet frame in an ISL header and trailer, with the encapsulated original Ethernet 
frame being unchanged. Figure 10-4 shows the framing for ISL.
Figure 10-4
ISL Header
The ISL header includes several ﬁelds, but most important, the ISL header VLAN ﬁeld 
provides a place to encode the VLAN number. By tagging a frame with the correct VLAN 
number inside the header, the sending switch can ensure that the receiving switch knows 
which VLAN the encapsulated frame belongs to. Also, the source and destination addresses 
in the ISL header use MAC addresses of the sending and receiving switch, as opposed to the 
devices that actually sent the original frame. Other than that, the details of the ISL header 
are not that important.  
IEEE 802.1q
The IEEE standardizes many of the protocols relating to LANs today, and VLAN trunking 
is no exception. Years after Cisco created ISL, the IEEE completed work on the 802.1q 
standard, which deﬁnes a different way to do trunking.
802.1q uses a different style of header than does ISL for tagging frames with a VLAN 
number. In fact, 802.1q does not actually encapsulate the original frame—instead, it adds an 
extra 4-byte header to the middle of the original Ethernet header. That additional header 
includes a ﬁeld with which to identify the VLAN number. Because the original header is now 
longer, 802.1q encapsulation forces a recalculation of the original FCS ﬁeld in the Ethernet 
trailer because the FCS is based on the contents of the entire frame. Figure 10-5 shows the 
802.1q header and framing of the revised Ethernet header.

Trunking with ISL and 802.1q     267
Figure 10-5
802.1q Trunking Header
ISL and 802.1q Compared
Both ISL and 802.1q provide trunking. The header used by each varies, and only ISL actually 
encapsulates the original frame, but both allow the use of a 12-bit-long VLAN ID ﬁeld. So, 
either works ﬁne and supports the same number of VLANs as a result of both using a 12-bit 
VLAN Number ﬁeld. 
ISL and 802.1q both support a separate instance of spanning tree for each VLAN. ISL 
supported this feature much earlier than did 802.1q, so in years past, one of the stated 
differences between the two trunking protocols was that 802.1q did not support multiple 
spanning trees. To appreciate the beneﬁts of multiple spanning trees, examine Figure 10-6, 
which shows a simple network, with two VLANs and three interconnected switches.
Figure 10-6
ISL Per VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)
You can tune STP parameters in each VLAN so that when all links are up, different interfaces 
block for different VLANs. In the ﬁgure, only one of the six switch interfaces connecting the 
switches needs to block to prevent loops. STP can be conﬁgured so that VLAN 1 and VLAN 
2 block different interfaces on SW3. So, SW3 actually uses the available bandwidth on each 
of its links to the other switches because, on SW3, trafﬁc in VLAN 1 uses the link to SW1, 
and trafﬁc in VLAN 2 uses the link to SW2. Of course, if a link fails, both STP instances can 
converge so that a path is still available.

268     Chapter 10: Virtual LANs and Trunking
Passing Trafﬁc Between VLANs
At the beginning of this chapter, a VLAN was deﬁned as a broadcast domain. To take that 
concept a bit further, the same devices that comprise a VLAN are also in the same TCP/IP 
subnet. So, devices in the same VLAN are in the same subnet, and devices in different VLANs 
must be in different IP subnets. Although the concept of a VLAN and a subnet are indeed 
different concepts, they have a one-to-one relationship.
This section covers some of the terminology regarding possibilities for passing packets 
between devices in different VLANs.
Layer 2 Switching
The term Layer 2 switching (L2 switching) refers to the typical switch-processing logic 
covered in Chapter 9. A switch receives a frame and looks at the destination MAC address. 
If the MAC table has an entry for that destination, it forwards the frame; if not, or if the 
frame is a broadcast, it forwards the frame out all ports, except the port in which the frame 
entered the switch. 
When VLANs are used, an L2 switch uses the same logic, but per VLAN. So, there is a MAC 
address table for each VLAN. Because the MAC address tables are separate, unicasts sent 
inside one VLAN cannot be forwarded out ports in another VLAN. Likewise, broadcasts in 
one VLAN cannot be forwarded out ports in another VLAN.
In short, L2 switches cannot forward trafﬁc between VLANs. The last few pages of this 
chapter cover a few alternatives for how you can forward trafﬁc between VLANs.
Layer 3 Forwarding Using a Router 
Switches do not forward frames between different VLANs. So, when you have multiple 
VLANs, what do you do when the hosts in each VLAN want to communicate with each 
other? Well, you use a router. Figure 10-7 outlines the general idea in a network with one 
switch and three VLANs.
Although the switch cannot forward frames between two VLANs, a router can. First, notice 
that three VLANs are shown, and each VLAN corresponds to a different subnet. The router 
needs an interface in each subnet to forward trafﬁc between the subnets—that is true even 
without VLANs being used. So, in this case, the router has three interfaces, each cabled to 
the switch. The switch conﬁgures the corresponding interfaces to be in VLAN1, VLAN2, and 
VLAN3. Hosts in VLAN1, when they want to send packets to hosts in VLAN2 or VLAN3, 
send their packets to the router, which then forwards the packets out another interface into 
the other VLAN.

Passing Trafﬁc Between VLANs     269
Figure 10-7
Routing Between VLANs
You might be thinking that using three interfaces on the router in Figure 10-7 seems 
wasteful—and it is. Alternately, you can use a router with a Fast Ethernet port that supports 
trunking and use a single physical connection from the router to the switch (trunking is not 
supported on 10 Mbps Ethernet interfaces). Figure 10-8 shows the same network as Figure 
10-7, but with a trunk between the router and the switch.
Figure 10-8
Example of a Router Forwarding Between VLANs over a Trunk
Chapter 8, “Advanced TCP/IP Topics” in the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide shows 
an example conﬁguration for the router in this example. The process works the same as in Figure 
10-7, except that the actual frames go to the router and leave the router over the same cable.

Layer 3 Forwarding Using a Layer 3 Switch
The term Layer 3 switch (L3 switch) refers to a switch that also has routing features. So, 
instead of requiring a router external to the switch, as in Figure 10-8, the router internal to 
the switch performs the same routing function.
The only difference between routing using a router, as in Figure 10-8, and using a Layer 3 
switch lies in the internal processing. Outwardly, nothing is different. For instance, Figure 
10-9 shows routing and L3 switching between two interfaces in two different VLANs. If you 
were to put a LAN analysis tool at the points shown in each of the two topologies and 
compare the packets being forwarded between the two, you would see no difference.
Figure 10-9
Analysis Points Showing No Difference Between L3 Switching and Routing
By tracing the two similar networks at the points shown, you can conﬁrm that there are no 
differences to the effect of the external router versus the L3 switch. The L3 switch runs 
routing protocols and builds an IP routing table, and the switch makes the forwarding 
decision based on destination IP address. The L3 switch even discards the only Ethernet data 
link header and builds a new one, as described in Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of IP.”
The differences between the two options relates to what happens inside the L3 switch. L3 
switches used specialized hardware to make the forwarding process run very fast. The switch 
ASICs (Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits) on an L3 switch have been built so that the 
normal, very fast L2 forwarding path can also be caused to perform the forwarding for Layer 
3. In other words, the actual receipt, changing of headers, and forwarding of the packets uses 
the same high-speed internal processing of the L2 switch. The L3 switch also includes the 
software used to run other processes, such as routing protocols, which are used to populate 
the tables used by the specialized forwarding hardware. You do not need to know the 
speciﬁcs of how any one single L3 switch works internally; just know that the difference 
between L3 switching and routing is based on what happens inside the L3 switch.

Layer 4 Switching
The term Layer 4 switches (L4 switches) refers to a type of switching in which the switch 
considers the information in the Layer 4 headers when forwarding the packet. In some cases, 
the forwarding decision is based upon information inside the Layer 4 headers. In other cases, 
L3 forwarding is used, but the switch does accounting based on the Layer 4 headers. Both 
are considered to be Layer 4 switching.
The key to understanding L4 switching is to remember the function of TCP and UDP port 
numbers, as covered in Chapter 6, “Fundamentals of TCP and UDP.” Port numbers identify 
the application process of the sender and the receiver of a packet. An L4 switch can make the 
decision of where to forward the packet based on the information in the TCP or UDP header, 
typically the port numbers. Alternately, it can also simply keep track of the numbers of 
packets and bytes sent per TCP port number, while still performing Layer 3 forwarding.
Figure 10-10 shows an example with an L4 switch making its forwarding decisions based on 
the TCP port number. The ﬁgure shows a server farm, with two servers that have replicated 
web content, meaning that either server can be used to server any user. The third server 
processes all FTP trafﬁc—so when a user of the web server clicks something to start an FTP 
download, the download comes from SVR-3.
Figure 10-10
L4 Switching Based on TCP Port Numbers
All requests for the web servers or for FTP services would be directed to the server farm via 
a single IP address that represents all three servers. Upon seeing the ﬁrst packet in a new TCP 
connection going to the web destination port (port 80), the L4 switch would pick either SVR-
1 or SVR-2. After this choice, all packets for that individual TCP connection would be 
switched to that same server. Similarly, when a new TCP connection was requested, with 
destination port 21 (FTP), the switch would know to just forward the request to SVR-3.

272     Chapter 10: Virtual LANs and Trunking
To perform L4 switching, the switch must keep track of every individual Layer 4 ﬂow. If you 
had 1000 concurrent TCP connections into the server farm, you would now need 1000 
entries in the L4 forwarding table. Comparing that to L3 switching, you would need only 
one route in the L3 routing table to support forwarding packets to the subnet of the server 
farm. So, L4 switching does require more switching capacity than does the equivalent with 
L3 switching.
Finally, L4 switching does not always imply a change in how packets are forwarded. A switch 
can perform accounting to track the volumes of trafﬁc per TCP and UDP port number but 
still make the decisions based on L3 switching logic. With Cisco switches, you can enable a 
feature called NetFlow switching, which performs the accounting based on Layer 4 
information while forwarding trafﬁc like a Layer 3 switch.
Layer 5–7 Switching
The TCP/IP application layer closely correlates to OSI Layers 5 through 7. In the last several 
years, the terms Layer 5–7 switching, Layer 7 switching, and application layer switching 
have all become common terms, meaning basically the same thing. A switch could look past 
the Layer 4 header, into the application layer headers, to make switching decisions—and that 
is what an L5-L7 switch does. Layer 5-7 switching typically falls into a category of features 
and products that Cisco calls Content Delivery Networks (CDN).
Multilayer Switching
A switch does not have to just perform switching at one layer or another. For instance, for 
trafﬁc between ports in the same VLAN, L2 switching is needed. For trafﬁc between two 
different VLANs, L3 switching is needed. So, often a switch performs switching at multiple 
layers. These switches are called multilayer switches. Most of the time today, when you hear 
of a Layer 3 switch, it is really a multilayer switch because it almost always is also a Layer 2 
switch.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
Figure 10-11 shows the general idea of a VLAN, showing two different VLANs/broadcast 
domains.

With VLAN trunking, the switches tag each frame sent between switches so that the receiving 
switch knows what VLAN the frame belongs to. Figure 10-12 outlines the basic idea.

This chapter completes the Ethernet puzzle for this book, in relation to the requirements 
of the INTRO exam. Ethernet was covered in several other chapters of this book—
speciﬁcally, Chapter 3, “Data Link Layer Fundamentals: Ethernet LANs,” Chapter 9, 
“Cisco LAN Switching Basics,” and Chapter 10, “Virtual LANs and Trunking.” The 
topics in those chapters laid the foundation of a relatively broad knowledge of Ethernet. 
However, to keep those chapters ﬂowing and not get bogged down in some long tangents 
(in some cases, relatively unimportant tangents), those earlier chapters did not cover all 
the details of Ethernet that might be on the INTRO exam. 
For those of you studying for the CCNA exam—in other words, the single-exam method 
of getting your CCNA certiﬁcation—you are probably following the reading plan 
outlined in the introduction. For you, after this chapter, you should move on to the ﬁrst 
three chapters of CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The eight-question quiz, derived from the major sections in “Foundation Topics” portion 
of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.
AUTHOR’S NOTE
While they may be on the CCNA exam, the topics in this chapter 
are less likely to be on the CCNA exam than most other topics in this book. For those 
of you that are planning to take the CCNA exam, instead of taking both the INTRO 
and ICND exams, you might consider skipping this chapter. Refer to the introduction 
to this book for more perspectives on the CCNA exam topics.

Network Topologies     283
Foundation Topics
This chapter begins with a description of different topologies that you might ﬁnd in different 
types of networks, including Ethernets, but also including other types of networks. Next, 
Ethernet standards and cabling options are detailed. Finally, the chapter closes with a brief 
description of wireless technology and wireless LANs.
Network Topologies
You already have been introduced to several different network topologies as you have read 
through this book. For instance, 10BASE2 networks use a physical bus topology, whereas 
10BASE-T networks use a physical star topology. This section introduces you to several other 
types of network topologies. 
Figure 11-1 shows the different types of Ethernet topologies covered earlier in the book, with 
some speciﬁc terms used to describe the topology for each design.
Figure 11-1
Different Types of Network Topologies for Ethernet So Far in This Book
The ﬁgure shows a 10BASE5 network, a 10BASE-T network using a shared hub, and a 
switch with 10/100 links. Physically, the topologies with the hub and the switch look a little 
like how a child might draw a star, or the sun, with a center (the hub or switch) and with 
beams of light pointing outward (like the Ethernet cables to the PCs in the ﬁgure). Star 
topologies also are called hub-and-spoke topologies. 
Physical bus topologies transmit the electrical signal from one end of a cable to the other, 
with the signal being picked up at each connection point. 
The term logical topology refers to how the network behaves. For instance, from Chapter 3, 
you know that a 10BASE-T hub repeats an incoming signal out every other port on the hub.

284     Chapter 11: LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies
So, logically, it also causes the electrical signals to be sent to every connection on the 
network—more like a bus in logic. So, people might describe a network using a hub as a 
physical star, but a logical bus. The logical topology for the switch network is a star because, 
unlike a hub, a switch does not repeat the signal out every port, but just to the appropriate 
device.
Figure 11-2 shows three other types of network topologies, which could be used for 
interconnecting Ethernet hubs and switches.
Figure 11-2
Extended Star, Full Mesh, and Partial Mesh
The extended star is characterized by parts of the topology that look like a star, which, in 
turn, are connected in star fashion to some other node. For instance, the three switches with 
PC attached, taken alone, form a star topology. By connecting to another switch in the 
middle, another star is formed, so this topology would be characterized as an extended star. 
Extended star topologies are rare for Ethernets.

Network Topologies     285
If you pursue your CCDA certiﬁcation, you will come across many designs in which you see 
the full mesh and partial mesh topologies shown in the ﬁgure. A full mesh is typical of 
switches that collectively form the core and distribution layers of a campus LAN design that 
includes Layer 3 switching. The partial mesh design often is found between distribution layer 
and access layer switches. If you want to learn more about LAN design concepts, pick up the 
CCDA Exam Certiﬁcation Guide and read more. For our purposes, you should just know 
that a full mesh means that all the respective nodes in the network have a direct connection. 
A partial mesh means that some of the nodes in a network have a direct connection, but 
others do not. 
Frame Relay networks often are described as being full mesh or partial mesh. For instance, 
consider Figure 11-3, with a Frame Relay network.

286     Chapter 11: LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies
Frame Relay networks use a physical star topology because each Frame Relay DTE device 
connects to a central Frame Relay network. However, depending on which sites have VCs 
connecting them, the logical design is either full mesh or partial mesh. When you study for 
the ICND exam, you will see many Frame Relay examples with full- and partial-mesh 
designs. Practically, no one really refers to Frame Relay as using a physical star design, but 
many people do refer to a Frame Relay design as either full mesh or partial mesh. 
Figure 11-4 shows the ﬁnal topology covered here—the ring topology.
Figure 11-4
Single-Ring and Dual-Ring Topologies
The left-most ﬁgure depicts a concept in which each device is cabled to the next, with the 
signal transmitted in a single direction. By doing so, the signal starts with one device, and 
eventually, the signal makes it all the way back to the original sender of the data. With one 
physical path, the topology is called a single ring, and with two physical paths, the topology 
is called a dual ring.
Dual rings are useful for failover. With dual rings, one ring is used to transmit data under 
normal operations, with the second ring for failover. If the physical path between two 
adjacent devices fails, the two devices on either side of the problem simply can loop the signal 
on one ring onto the other—and another physical loop has been created. This dual-ring 
topology was used with the now outdated Token Ring and Fiber Distributed Data Interface 
(FDDI) LANs. The same concept is used in optical networking today.
Finally, on the right side of Figure 11-4, you see an example of how Token Ring was cabled—
back when anyone cared. Each device had a cable connecting it to a hub, with a transmit wire 
and a receive wire inside the cable. The electrical signal was sent down each wire and was 
repeated back up the wire to the hub; then the hub repeated the process with the next device,

and so on. Electrically, a single ring was created, so Token Ring uses a logical ring topology, 
but physically, it uses a star topology. 
Table 11-2 summarizes the types of physical topology covered in this chapter.
Cabling and Connectors
Practically every other Cisco certiﬁcation exam ignores the topic of cabling; those exams just 
assume that you can read the manuals and ﬁgure out what cables are needed. Interestingly, 
a well-designed cabling plan, with the right cables, can be a big component of making a LAN 
more manageable and available. So, cabling is indeed important in real networks.
The cables themselves contain different components inside the cable—you just have to cut 
one open to look inside to see internal components. Also, each type of cable might allow for 
a variety of connectors at the end of the cable. So, in this section, you will read about the 
types of cables, what’s inside them, and what connectors can be used to terminate them.
General Features of Metallic Cabling
The term cable refers to a combination of plastics, metal wires, optical ﬁbers, possibly rubber, 
and other materials molded into a cord of varying lengths. Well, that’s at least a formal 
deﬁnition. People see cables every day. The power cords that go from the electrical wall 
socket to each of your electrically powered appliances and lamps at home are all cables. 
There are cables protruding from the back of your PC. And for networking, the phone cord 
stretching from the wall outlet to your phone is actually a networking cable.
Most networking cables use either copper wires inside the cable to transfer an electrical 
signal, or glass ﬁber inside the cable to transfer optical light signals. So, many people refer to 
Table 11-2
Physical Topology Types
Term
Deﬁnition
Bus
This is a linear topology, with all devices connected to the cable.
Star
Each device is connected to a central point. Sometimes called hub-and-spoke.
Extended star
A star topology is in the center, but instead of each point being a single 
device, it can be the center of another star topology.
Full mesh
Each device has a direct connection to each other device.
Partial mesh
Each device does not have a direct connection to each other device.
Single ring
Each device is connected directly to two others so that the signal is repeated 
in one direction, creating a ring or loop.
Dual ring
Two rings go through the same set of devices, allowing loops to be made 
upon failure, which continues the operation of a ring.

288     Chapter 11: LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies
cabling as wiring just because the vast majority of networking cables are actually copper wire 
cables. The wire cables also sometimes are called copper cabling, just because the most 
popular metal to use in the cable is copper. 
When sending an electrical signal over a cable, the signal introduces a magnetic ﬁeld and also 
introduces radio frequency interference. Translation: When the cable is in use, it emits 
radiation that can interfere with other signals in other wires or signals that pass through the 
air. When one wire affects another in this manner, it is commonly referred to as crosstalk. So, 
the various national governments tend to regulate how much of these unwanted physics 
effects are allowed. These metallic wire cables are designed to reduce the effects of the 
radiation and interference.
The wires can be affected by outside interference as well. Nearby cables can interfere with 
the transmission on the cable, actually changing the electrical signal and causing bit errors. 
So, electrical cables create their own emissions and are susceptible to problems from the 
emissions from other sources, particularly nearby cables.
The most popular way today to reduce the effects of emissions is to transmit over a pair of 
wires and twist those two wires together. By using an opposite current on each wire, each 
wire produces an identical magnetic ﬁeld, but in an opposite direction. It’s sort of like having 
two equal-power magnets of the same polarity, both trying to pull things toward them. If you 
put a paper clip between them at equal distances, with equal strength for the magnets, the paper 
clip should not move. If only one magnet were there, it would attract the paper clip. Essntially, 
twisting the wires has a similar effect—the two magnetic ﬁelds cancel each other out.
Twisted-pair wiring is used in today’s most popular electrical (wire) networking cables.
The other popular way to reduce the emissions of copper cabling is to shield the wires. That 
means that the wires have some material placed around them, using a material that blocks 
most of the electromagnetic radiation. The concept is similar to when you need to get an x-
ray, and the person taking the x-ray leaves the room or stands behind a screen made of lead—
the x-rays (which are a form of electromagnetic raditaion) do not pass through the lead 
screen. Similarly, by shielding the cables, the cables emit less raditation.
Unfortunately, shielding the wires makes the cable more expensive and less ﬂexible. The need 
to add more materials to a cable to shield the cable increases materials and manufacturing 
costs for the cables. You need a lot of cables to build a typical enterprise network, so the extra 
cost does add up. If the cable does not bend easily, you might not be able to run it in tight 
spaces behind walls, in ceilings, into where the wall plate sits behind the wall, and so on. So, 
inﬂexible cabling could require you to open walls in the building to make a new space for the 
cables to run—costing time and money.

Cabling and Connectors     289
Unshielded Twisted-Pair and Shielded Twisted-Pair Cabling and Connectors
The Telecommunications Information Associatation (TIA) deﬁnes standards for LAN 
cabling. For copper-wire LAN cabling, two main branches have been deﬁned: 
■
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) 
■
Shielded twisted pair (STP) 
Figure 11-5 shows a conceptual diagram of each type of cable. The ﬁgure shows a side view 
of each cable and a straight-on view of a UTP cable. All the parts of the ﬁgure show the cable 
cut open so that you can see the internal components of the cables. 
Figure 11-5
UTP and STP Cable Components
The ﬁgure shows most of the pertinent details of both types of cables. Working from the 
outside in, the UTP cable has an outer jacket—its main purpose is to hold all the interior 
cabling together. Inside, you have some number of twisted pairs of cables. From the lowest 
part of the ﬁgure, looking straight at the end of the cable, you can see that each wire does 
not simply sit inside the outer jacket—instead, each wire has some colored plastic insulation 
attached to it. Copper, when spun to such a small diameter, would break very easily without 
some support. So, the thin plastic insulation provides some strength for each individual wire. 
Each wire’s thin plastic insulation also is colored differently, either a solid color or a stripe 
against a white background. The colors help when making individual cables by cutting a

length of cable off a large cable spool and adding connectors, such as an RJ-45 connector, on 
the end of a cable. Each wire can be identiﬁed by the color of the plastic insulation at each 
end of the cable. Also, each twisted pair uses the same color—one wire with the solid color 
and one striped.
The STP cable diagram on the right of Figure 11-5 just shows the additional components of 
an STP cable as compared with an UTP cable. Each pair is covered with insulating material, 
with another insulator covering all pairs combined. The extra materials cause the relative 
lack of ﬂexibility in the cable and, of course, add the beneﬁt of less interference.
UTP Standards
The TIA deﬁnes several standards for UTP cabling. The UTP cable types are deﬁned in 
different categories—but no one would really use the term UTP category in normal speech—
instead, you would say something like “Are you using CAT5 cables?” Table 11-3 lists the 
characteristics of the different categories of UTP cable as deﬁned by the TIA.
UTP Connectors
UTP cables use Regulated Jack 45 (RJ-45) connectors. Some cables need only two twisted 
pairs, typically using pairs 2 and 3, as speciﬁed by the TIA. Figure 11-6 shows a picture of 
an RJ-45 connector, with some details of the eight pins on the connector. Figure 11-7 shows 
the pinouts on a typical four-pair UTP cable using an RJ-45 connector, according to the TIA 
speciﬁcations.

Four-Pair UTP Cable: Pinouts Using RJ-45
The wiring diagram shows four-pair cabling that uses all eight pins on an RJ-45 connector. 
Some Ethernet standards require only two pairs and typically use the pair on pins 1 and 2 
and the pair on pins 3 and 6.
Coaxial Cabling
Coaxial cabling was used for 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 Ethernet in years past. 10BASE5 was 
referred to as thicknet, and 10BASE2 was referred to as thinnet because 10BASE5 used 
thicker coaxial cable.
Even 10 years ago, newly installed Ethernet networks most often were not 10BASE2 or 
10BASE5 networks, but rather were 10BASE-T. I personally have not seen a 10BASE2 
or 10BASE5 Ethernet NIC available for sale from a vendor for at least 5 years. So, the 
relative importance of remembering the details of coaxial cabling for your job is pretty small. 

292     Chapter 11: LAN Cabling, Standards, and Topologies
Coaxial cables are shielded. They have a single copper wire in the center, with plastic 
insulation and copper shielding surrounding the copper wire. 
For 10BASE5, the network consisted of a length of coaxial cable of up to 500 m in length. 
In fact, the “5” in 10BASE5 represents the maximum length of a single cable segment. To 
connect to the segment, a vampire tap was used. The vampire tap is a piece of metal in the 
shape of a cylinder when closed. By closing the tap around the cable, the tap actually pushed 
through the shielding to let the metal in the vampire tap touch the copper wire inside the 
cable. I’m sure it is now obvious where the name vampire tap came from! From the vampire 
tap, a short cable, called an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) cable, connected the tap to the 
Ethernet card on the PC. 
Running individual shielded, heavy, relatively inﬂexible coaxial cable for 500 m for a long 
10BASE5 network was, to say the least, a lot of work. For 10BASE2, which was developed 
after 10BASE5, instead of a single length of cable, the bus was created by a series of cables. 
10BASE2 used thinner, more ﬂexible coax cabling as well. The cables used a British Naval 
Connector (BNC) connector, which was a lot easier to work with than the vampire taps. To 
connect a computer, a T-connector was used, with one end plugged into the Ethernet card, 
another into a cable from the upstream cable, and another cable connecting to the next 
device downstream. Figure 11-8 shows a picture of the BNC connector, and Figure 11-9 
shows the typical cabling options for 10BASE2 and 10BASE5.
Figure 11-8
BNC Connector on a Coaxial Cable
The one component shown in Figure 11-9 that was not already discussed is the term 
transceiver. This term was created by melding the terms transmitter and receiver. Instead of 
having the Ethernet card itself include the electronics that sent and received the signal on the 
Ethernet cable, the original Ethernet designs used an external device to actually encode the 
bits. The concept is not terribly different from having an external CSU/DSU on a WAN 
circuit, as covered in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of WANs.”

Cabling and Connectors     293

10BASE5 and 10BASE2 Connectors
For the purposes of networking, coaxial cable has some advantages. It allows for longer 
network segments—500 m, with longer distances allowed using repeaters. However, the cons 
of coaxial cabling include the fact that it is more expensive, heavier, larger (takes up more 
room in conduits), and relatively inﬂexible. Also, when used for Ethernet, a single break in 
the cable takes down the entire Ethernet segment! All of these factors add up to some of the 
reasons that coaxial cabling is not a popular option for network cabling today.
Fiber-Optic Cabling and Connectors for Ethernet
Fiber cabling, also called optical cabling or ﬁber optics, provides another option for cabling 
Ethernet. The main differences, in terms of function, between optical cabling for Ethernet 
and electrical cabling are as follows:
■
Longer distances supported by optical cabling
■
Greater monetary cost
■
Less magnetic interference, making it slightly more secure
■
Only type of cabling supported by 10 Gig Ethernet
For instance, network engineers might choose to use optical interfaces and cabling for 
Ethernet when building a campus LAN when the buildings happen to be a few miles apart 
because optical cables allow longer cables to be used. If the company has the right of way, it 
can run optical cable between the sites and still build a campus LAN.

Also, if you want to use Ethernet between two buildings that are a few miles apart but you 
do not have the right of way, you might be able to lease what is called dark ﬁber from a 
service provider. Dark ﬁber is just optical cabling run by the service provider, which it can do 
because it owns the right to run the cable under the streets. The service provider typically 
runs a lot of different optical ﬁbers and then just leases to you the number of optical ﬁbers 
you need.
In other cases, you might choose to use optical cabling to help protect highly sensitive trafﬁc. 
Because of the emissions coming from electrical cabling, with the right tools, you actually 
can tell what signals are being sent across a cable. So, when an Ethernet cable might become 
accessible to someone who wants to listen in, the use of optical cabling can thrwart that 
person’s efforts, because unlike electrical cabling, optical cabling does not emit 
electromagnetic radiation.
The key component of optical cabling is the ﬁberglass center of the cable. The devices on the 
end of the cable, such as Ethernet switches, generate an optical light signal. The signal travels 
down the optical ﬁber in the center of the cable. No electricity is used across the cable—just 
light is used.
Optical cabling can be divided into two general categories:
■
Multimode (MM) 
■
Single-mode (SM)
SM ﬁber uses a very small-diameter optical ﬁber, with MM ﬁber using a larger size. SM 
cables require more precision in the manufacturing process and more precision by the 
hardware that generates the light that crosses the cable, so SM cables and cards tend to be 
more expensive. However, SM cables typically allow for much longer distances and data rate 
than does MM ﬁber. MM cable still allows longer distances than copper cabling. 
Often Ethernet cards use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate light for MM cable, and 
other more expensive interfaces use a laser to generate the light for SM cables. The LEDs 
actually generate more than one wavelength of light, which, in part, is where the name 
multimode comes from. The actual terms multimode and single-mode refer to the fact that 
LEDs generate multiple wavelengths of light, whereas lasers generate a single speciﬁc 
wavelength.

Figure 11-10 shows a side view of an optical cable,  including a view of the optical ﬁber itself.
Figure 11-10
Components of a Fiber-Optic Cable
Yes, the center of the cable is made from glass, so it is fragile—but it is sturdy enough to work 
with the cable without worrying every second that you will break it. First, it is ﬁberglass, 
which does not break as easily as the glass in the windows of your house. The plastic adds 
some strength to the ﬁberglass. Most important for strength, a Kevlar coating is applied—
Kevlar is the stuff that most bullet-proof vests are made from today. 
The right side of the ﬁgure shows an example of how the light signal actually bounces off the 
interior walls of the glass ﬁber. The ﬁber has an inner part, called the core, and an outer part, 
called the cladding. The cladding has a different refractive index than the core, meaning that 
when the light hits the outer wall of the core, which is also the inner wall of the cladding, the 
light is reﬂected back into the core. This might be a bit oversimpliﬁed, but it’s like having a 
mirror on the inside wall of the cladding so that the light keeps getting reﬂected back into the 
core—the light eventaully makes it to the other end of the cable.
Optical Connectors for Ethernet
To transmit data over a ﬁber cable, you need a single strand of ﬁber. The term strand refers 
to the center of the cable, the glass part, as shown in Figure 11-10. To transmit data in both 
directions, you need a pair of strands—one for each direction of data transmission. However, 
because there are no emissions to speak of, there is no need to twist the strands together. So, 
to connect two devices using ﬁber cabling, you just need two strands, or ﬁbers, and the 
correct connector on each end.
A variety of connectors can be used for terminating optical cable when used for Ethernet. 
One type, called an ST connector, terminates each ﬁber strand with a barrel connector, much 
like a BNC connector. You place the connector onto a cylindrical male connector on the 
Ethernet interface (typically a switch) and twist to make the connector secure. Figure 11-11 
shows another type of connector, called an SC connector.

Figure 11-11
Fiber-Optic SC Connector
The ﬁgure shows two cables, each of which has a single ﬁber strand inside, attaching into a 
single connctor. Upon close examination, you can see that each strand terminates into a piece 
of plastic, with a larger, rectangular piece of plastic holding the two together. The larger piece 
of plastic holds the two internal connectors the the same distance from each other as the two 
receptacles on a card on a switch so that you can plug the whole connector into an Ethernet 
port at the same time. So, you have either both ﬁbers connected or neither.
A newer type of connector, called an MT-RJ connector, has become more popular in recent 
years. The MT-RJ connector uses the same plastic mold as an RJ-45 connector, which makes 
it easy to install. Two ﬁbers connect into the single connector, similar in concept to an SC 
connector. Figure 11-12 shows an MT-RJ connector.
Figure 11-12
MT-RJ Connector
Optical cabling costs more than copper cabling, and the Ethernet cards that can use optical 
cabling also cost more. However, there are several advantages to using optical cabling for 
Ethernet. You can have Ethernet segments that stretch over 10 km in length and have 
Ethernet speeds up to 10 Gbps, with little conduit space consumed due to the small diameter 
of the cable. Also, ﬁber cabling is more secure than copper wiring, because of the absence of 
emissions.

Summary: Ethernet Cabling
Ethernet networks can be built with a variety of cabling types, as covered in this chapter. 
Table 11-4 summarizes the types of cable and main features, with some comments about 
disadvantages and advantages of each. 
Ethernet Standards
Back in Chapter 3, this book introduced you to the most important Ethernet standards. 
Those included the IEEE 802.3 standard, including the Media Access Control (MAC) 
sublayer, which deﬁnes the 6-byte Ethernet addresses. Ethernet also uses IEEE 802.2, which 
deﬁnes a sublayer called Logical Link Control (LLC). 802.2 includes the DSAP ﬁeld, which 
identiﬁes the type of packet held in an Ethernet frame. Also in that chapter, you learned the 
main IEEE standards for Fast Ethernet (802.3u) and Gigabit Ethernet (802.3z and 802.3ab).
This short section describes several other Ethernet standards and summarizes all the salient 
points of the various Ethernet standards.

Ethernet Framing
All types of Ethernet use either the IEEE-deﬁned framing or the older Ethernet Version 2 
framing that predated the standardization of Ethernet by the IEEE. With 802.3 Ethernet, 
there are two main variations of framing—one without the use of a SNAP header and one 
with the use of a SNAP header. Figure 11-13 shows the three variations of headers.
Figure 11-13
Ethernet Framing
One of Ethernet’s greatest strengths is that each newly deﬁned Ethernet standard has used 
the same MAC and LLC headers and trailers, including the same address formats. So, when 
a new type of Ethernet is developed, engineers have very little new information to learn 
before supporting the new type.
Ethernet Cabling Standards
Each IEEE Ethernet standard deﬁnes the details for supporting a particular speed over a 
particular type of cabling. Also, each of these deﬁnitions speciﬁes the maximum cable length 
and the required features of the cabling. Tables 11-5, 11-6, and 11-7 list the pertinent details 
of the standards, and the cabling.

Ethernet Standards     299
10-Gigabit Ethernet
Tens years ago, compared to when I was writing this chapter in April 2003, Ethernet technology 
was just getting to the point that 10BASE-T networks were becoming common. Those networks 
shared 10 Mbps between all devices. On the horizon at that time was the promise of Ethernet 
switching, with which you could actually have 10 Mbps on each port of the switch.
Ethernet has gone from being one of many competing LAN technologies, with several 
competitors, to the king of the LAN in 10 years. With “10 Gig E,” as it is commonly called, 
Ethernet has increased its speed a thousandfold in 10 years and has won the war in terms of LAN 
technologies. Just as the last 10 years have seen the emergence of TCP/IP as the most proliﬁc 
Layer 3 protocol, Ethernet has become the most proliﬁc Layer 1 and Layer 2 LAN standard.
10 Gig Ethernet, deﬁned in IEEE 802.3ae, runs at 10 Gbps—it would be poorly named if not! 
It uses the same 802.3 MAC and 802.2 LLC as the other types of Ethernet. But it does have 
some differences with the other types:
■
It allows only a point-to-point topology because it is intended for connectivity between 
switching devices.
■
It allows only full-duplex communication.
■
It speciﬁes only optical ﬁber—no copper cabling. (Support for copper wiring might be 
added later.)

It will be a while before 10 Gig E becomes a cost-effective alternative for the wiring closet, 
but it is becoming a part of high-speed core enterprise networks already. Also, 10 Gig E has 
some very interesting applications for service providers as a trunking mechanism between 
switching locations. And with support for 10 Gig E using SM ﬁber for up to 40 km, 10 Gig 
E might help Ethernet continue its movement from a LAN technology into the WAN arena.
Wireless Communications
Wireless LANs enable users to communicate without any cabling. However, devices on 
these wireless LANs need to communicate with the devices on the “wired LANs,” so this 
seemed like an appropriate place to cover the basics of wireless LANs.
Wireless communication happens all around us—literally. Cordless phones are relatively 
common, with commmunications between the phone and the base unit happening using 
radio waves. Similarly, mobile phones use radio waves to communicate to a transmitter and 
receiver on a cell tower nearby. Your TV remote control even performs some basic wireless 
communication using infrared waves.
Wireless communication uses some form of electromagnetic energy that passes through 
space. The energy propagates through the air at varying wavelengths. Depending on the 
wavelength of the energy, the energy might be visible or not. Given the large number of 
applications for wireless in the world, different wavelengths of energy are given different 
names, such as infrared for one range, radio frequency for another, and so on.
Electromagnetic energy actually can pass through matter, but often the matter reﬂects the 
energy to some degree and absorbs part of the energy as well. Some wavelengths require a 
line-of-sight for communication to happen because the wavelengths do not pass through 
matter well. For instance, a TV remote control using infrared typically requires a line-of-
sight. Others, such as the wavelengths used for your cell phone, do not require line-of-sight 
but are affected to some degree by the number, thickness, and materials in the obstructions 
the phone and the cell tower. Many of you have probably walked around a building trying 
to ﬁnd a place with good reception for your mobile phone—the problems are caused in part 
to the building absorbing and reﬂecting some of the energy.
Wireless LANs have become hugely popular in companies as well as in the home. The beauty 
of all wireless communication, including wireless LANs, is the lack of wires. No cables are 
required, and there’s no need to open up walls, get a ladder to get up in the ceiling, or pay 
$100 plus per cable to get new cables run. The downsides relate to the speeds (generally less 
than those of wired LANs today), security risks (anyone nearby can attempt to eavesdrop), 
and the extra engineering effort to make sure you have enough coverage in the area in which 
you allow people to roam with their wireless devices.

Wireless Communications     301
IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs
The most popular type of wireless LAN today is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which 
is known informally as Wi-Fi. The 802.11 speciﬁcation deﬁnes what happens on the wireless 
network to let two or more devices send and receive data.
Wireless LAN communication is really a shared LAN because only one station effectively can 
transmit at one time, at least in a particular constrained geography. 802.11 signals effectively 
might reach another device as far as 300 feet away. So, you can have lots of people around 
the planet using the airwaves for 802.11 at any one point in time, but only one device can 
send at a time when within range of the wireless signals.
Wireless LANs typically include one or more computers that have a wireless 802.11 LAN 
card, plus one or more wireless access points (APs). Access points bridge or route trafﬁc from 
the wireless LAN to the “wired” LAN and vice versa. Figure 11-14 depicts the general idea.
Figure 11-14
Wireless Access Point and 802.11 Framing
The AP shows two antennae protruding from the corners—indeed, a component of wireless 
communications is the antennae used to receive and transmit wireless radio signals. The two 
PCs at the top of the ﬁgure also have antennae, typically connected to the end of the 802.11 
LAN card and protruding out from the PC.
Note that 802.11 calls for the use of IEEE 802.2 LLC, as well as the same format of addresses 
deﬁned in 802.3. 802.11 does use a different MAC header than 802.3, however. So, to bridge 
the trafﬁc, the access point simply swaps an 802.11 header for an 802.3 header, and vice 
versa, using the same MAC addresses. Some wireless APs route trafﬁc from the wireless 
network to the wired network.

802.11 includes several standards. 802.11b transmits at 11 Mbps using the 2.4 GHz 
frequency band, but it is shared, with the maximum throughput capped at about 7 Mbps. 
802.11a, which runs in the 5 Ghz frequency band, now can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps, as 
can 802.11g, which uses the 2.4 Ghz band, like 802.11b. When this book was published, 
there was still debate in the industry as to which of the higher-speed wireless standards would 
emerge as the more popular technology in the marketplace.

Deﬁnition
Bus
This is a linear topology, with all devices connected to the cable.
Star
Each device is connected to a central point. Sometimes called hub-and-
spoke.
Extended star
A star topology is in the center, but instead of each point being a single 
device, it can be the center of another star topology.
Full mesh
Each device has a direction connection to each other device.
Partial mesh
Each device does not have a direct connection to each other device.
Single ring
Each device is connected connected to two others so that the signal is 
repeated in one direction, causing a ring or loop.
Dual ring
Two rings go through the same set of devices, allowing loops to be made 
upon failure, which continues the operation of a ring.

IP Addressing and Subnetting 
In Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of IP,” you learned about the basic concepts and 
terminology relating to IP addressing. These concepts were introduced early in the book 
because your understanding of many basic networking concepts depends on a base 
knowledge of IP addressing.
In this chapter, you will learn about the concepts and mathematics that let you analyze 
IP addresses and subnets. IP addressing is the only major topic that happens to get 
coverage on both of the INTRO and ICND exams. To answer questions on either CCNA 
exam, you will need to discover the structure of IP addresses, list the addresses in the 
same subnet, list the other subnets of that same network, identify the numbers of hosts 
in a subnet, and identify other information about addresses and subnets. This chapter 
describes the math and processes used to answer these questions.
This chapter also happens to cover a few topics related IP address scalability issues 
related to Internet growth. 
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The purpose of the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz is to help you decide whether you 
really need to read the entire chapter. If you already intend to read the entire chapter, you 
do not necessarily need to answer these questions now.
The 14-question quiz, derived from the major sections in the “Foundation Topics” 
portion of the chapter, helps you determine how to spend your limited study time.
Table 12-1 outlines the major topics discussed in this chapter and the “Do I Know This

The goal of self-assessment is to gauge your mastery of the topics in this 
chapter. If you do not know the answer to a question or are only partially sure of the 
answer, you should mark this question wrong for purposes of the self-assessment. Giving 
yourself credit for an answer that you correctly guess skews your self-assessment results 
and might provide you with a false sense of security.

IP Addressing Review     319
Foundation Topics
This chapter begins with a brief review of IP addressing and subnetting. Following that, the 
text takes a thorough look at several types of IP addressing questions and the math you can 
use to ﬁnd the answers.
IP Addressing Review
Chapter 5 explained the concepts behind IP addressing; Class A, B, and C networks; and 
subnetting. Before looking at the math behind IP addressing, a quick review will be helpful.
Many different Class A, B, and C networks exist. Table 12-2 summarizes the possible network 
numbers, the total number of each type, and the number of hosts in each Class A, B, and C 
network.
*The “Valid Network Numbers” row shows actual network numbers. There are several reserved 
cases. For example, networks 0.0.0.0 (originally deﬁned for use as a broadcast address) and 
127.0.0.0 (still available for use as the loopback address) are reserved. Networks 128.0.0.0, 
191.255.0.0, 192.0.0.0, and 223.255.255.0 also are reserved.
Without subnetting, a different IP network must be used for each physical network. For 
example, Figure 12-1 shows three example IP addresses, each from a different network. One 
address is in a Class A network, one is in a Class B network, and one is in a Class C network.

Figure 12-1
Example Class A, B, and C IP Addresses and Their Formats
By deﬁnition, an IP address that begins with 8 in the ﬁrst octet is in a Class A network, so 
the network part of the address is the ﬁrst byte, or ﬁrst octet. An address that begins with 
130 is in a Class B network; by deﬁnition, Class B addresses have a 2-byte network part, as 
shown. Finally, any address that begins with 199 is in a Class C network, which has a 3-byte 
network part. Also by deﬁnition, a Class A address has a 1-byte host part, Class B has a 2-
byte host part, and Class C has a 1-byte host part.
Humans simply can remember the numbers in Table 12-2 and the concepts in Figure 12-1 
and then quickly determine the network and host part of an IP address. Computers, however, use 
a mask to deﬁne the size of the network and host parts of an address. The logic behind the mask 
results in the same conventions of Class A, B, and C networks that you already know, but the 
computer can deal with it better as a binary math problem. The mask is a 32-bit binary number, 
usually written in dotted-decimal format. The purpose of the mask is to deﬁne the structure of an 
IP address. In short, the mask deﬁnes the size of the host parts of an IP address, representing the 
host part of the IP address with binary 0s in the mask. Class A mask has its last 24 bits as binary 
0, which means that the last three octets of the mask are 0s. Table 12-3 summarizes the default 
masks and reﬂects the sizes of the two parts of an IP address.

IP Addressing Review     321
IP Subnetting
IP subnetting creates vastly larger numbers of smaller groups of IP addresses, compared with 
simply using Class A, B, and C conventions. The Class A, B, and C rules still exist—but now 
a single Class A, B, or C network can be subdivided into many smaller groups. Subnetting 
treats a subdivision of a single Class A, B, or C network as if it were a network itself. By doing 
so, a single Class A, B, or C network can be subdivided into many nonoverlapping subnets.
Figures 12-2 and 12-3 show the basic differences between a network that does not use 
subnetting and one that does use subneting. First, look at Figure 12-2, which uses six 
different IP networks.
Figure 12-2
Network Topology Using Six IP Networks
The design in Figure 12-2 requires six groups, each of which is a Class B network. The four 
LANs each use a single Class B network. In other words, the LANs attached to Routers A, 
B, C, and D are each a separate network. Additionally, the two serial interfaces composing

the point-to-point serial link between Routers C and D use the same network because these 
two interfaces are not separated by a router. Finally, the three router interfaces composing 
the Frame Relay network with Routers A, B, and C are not separated by an IP router and 
would compose the sixth network. 
As in Figure 12-2, the design in Figure 12-3 requires six groups. Unlike Figure 12-2, 
Figure 12-3 uses six subnets, each of which is a subnet of a single Class B network.
Figure 12-3
Same Network Topology, Using One IP Network, with Six Subnets
This design subnets Class B network 150.150.0.0. The IP network designer has chosen a 
mask of 255.255.255.0, the last octet of which implies 8 host bits. Because it is a Class B 
network, there are 16 network bits. Therefore, there are 8 subnet bits, which happen to be 
bits 17 through 24—in other words, the third octet. 
CAUTION
Other Frame Relay IP addressing options would require one or two more IP 
network numbers for this physical network.

Note that the network part (the ﬁrst two octets in this example) all begin with 150.150, 
meaning that each of the six subnets is a subnet of Class B network 150.150.0.0. 
When subnetting, a third part of an IP address appears in the middle of the address—namely, 
the subnet part of the address. This ﬁeld is created by “stealing” or “borrowing” bits from 
the host part of the address. The size of the network part of the address never shrinks—in 
other words, Class A, B, and C rules still apply when deﬁning the size of the network part of 
an address. However, the host part of the address shrinks to make room for the subnet part 
of the address. Figure 12-4 shows the format of addresses when subnetting.
Figure 12-4
Address Formats When Subnetting Is Used
Analyzing and Interpreting IP Addresses and Subnets
No one reading this book should be shocked to hear that IP addressing is one of the most 
important topics on both  exams. You need a comfortable, conﬁdent understanding of IP 
addressing and subnetting for success on any Cisco certiﬁcation. You should be prepared to 
answer questions about the following: 
■
An interpretation of an address
■
Its network number
■
Its subnet number
■
The other IP addresses in the same subnet
■
The broadcast address
■
The other subnets that could be used if the same mask were in use
In other words, you had better know IP addressing and subnetting!
Besides just answering questions on the CCNA exams, network engineers need to understand 
subnetting very well to do their jobs. Engineers who work with multiple networks must 
decipher IP addresses quickly, without running off to use a subnet calculator tool. For 
example, someone with a problem might call and tell you his IP address. After ﬁnding out 
the mask that’s used, you do a show ip route command on a router, but that typically lists

subnets—so you need to be able to easily ﬁgure out the subnet of which the address is a 
member. And not all networks will be using nice, easy subnet masks.
No matter how useful this book is in helping you with a real networking job, the primary 
goal of this book is to help you pass the exam. So, the rest of this chapter is geared toward 
helping you understand how to interpret and analyze IP addresses. 
Math Operations Used to Answer Subnetting Questions
Computers, especially routers, do not think about IP addresses in terms of the conventions 
shown in Table 12-2. They think in terms of 32-bit binary numbers, which is ﬁne because, 
technically, that’s what IP addresses really are. Also, computers use a mask to deﬁne the 
structure of these binary IP addresses. A full understanding of what that means is not too 
difﬁcult. However, getting accustomed to doing the binary math in your head is challenging 
for most of us, particularly if you don’t do it every day. 
In this section, you will read about two key math operations that will be used throughout the 
discussion of answering CCNA addressing and subnetting questions. One operation converts 
IP addresses from decimal to binary and then back to decimal. The other operation performs 
a binary math operation called a Boolean AND.
Converting IP Addresses from Decimal to Binary, and Back Again  
If you already know how binary works, how binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary 
conversion works, and how to convert IP addresses from decimal to binary and back, skip 
to the next section, “The Boolean AND Operation.” 
IP addresses are 32-bit binary numbers, written as a series of decimal numbers, separated by 
periods. To examine an address in its true form, binary, you need to convert from decimal to 
binary. To put a 32-bit binary number in the decimal form that is needed when conﬁguring 
a router, you need to convert the 32-bit number back to decimal, 8 bits at a time.
One key to the conversion process for IP addresses is remembering these facts: 
When converting from one format to the other, each decimal number represents 8 bits. 
When converting from decimal to binary, each decimal number converts to an 8-bit 
number. 
When converting from binary to decimal, each set of 8 consecutive bits converts to 
one decimal number.
Consider the conversion of IP address 150.150.2.1 to binary for a moment. The number 150, 
when converted to its 8-bit binary equivalent, is 10010110. How do you know that? For 
now, look in the conversion chart in Appendix B, “Binary to Decimal Conversion Chart. The 

Analyzing and Interpreting IP Addresses and Subnets     325
next byte, another decimal 150, is converted to 10010110. The third byte, decimal 2, is 
converted to 00000010; ﬁnally, the fourth byte, decimal 1, is converted to 00000001. The 
combined series of 8-bit numbers is the 32-bit IP address—in this case, 10010110 10010110 
00000010 00000001.
If you start with the binary version of the IP address, you ﬁrst separate it into four sets of 
eight digits. Then you convert each set of eight binary digits to its decimal equivalent. For 
example, writing an IP address as follows is correct but not very useful: 
10010110100101100000001000000001
To convert this number to a more conveneint decimal form, ﬁrst separate it into four sets of 
eight digits: 
10010110 10010110 00000010 00000001
Then look in the conversion chart in Appendix B and ﬁnd that the ﬁrst 8-bit number converts 
to 150, and so does the second set. The third set of 8 bits converts to 2, and the fourth 
converts to 1—giving you 150.150.2.1.
Using the chart in Appendix B makes this much easier—but you will not have the chart on 
the exam, of course! So you can do a couple of things. First, you can learn how to do the 
conversion. The book does not cover it, but a couple of web sites referenced at the end of this 
section can help. The other alternative is to use the chart when studying, and study the 
examples that show you how to manipulate IP addresses and ﬁnd the right answers to the 
test questions without doing any binary math. If that works for you, you actually do not need 
to be speedy and proﬁcient at doing binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversions.
One last important fact: When subnetting, the subnet and host parts of the address might 
span only part of a byte of the IP address. But when converting from binary to decimal and 
decimal to binary, the rule of always converting an 8-bit binary number to a decimal number 
is always true. However, when thinking about subnetting, you will need to ignore byte 
boundaries and think about IP addresses as 32-bit numbers without speciﬁc byte boundaries. 
But that is explained more later in the section titled ”Finding the Subnet Number.“
Interestingly, you should actually be prepared to do basic binary, decimal, and hexadecimal 
conversions if taking the INTRO exam. While the shortcuts that can help you perform 
subnetting quickly are still very valuable, make sure you can convert numbers between all 
three types. Some sites that might help you if you want more information are as follows:

The Boolean AND Operation
George Boole, a mathemetician who lived in the 1800s, created a branch of mathematics that 
came to be called Boolean math, after the name of its creator. Boolean math has many 
applications in computing theory. In fact, you can ﬁnd subnet numbers, given an IP address 
and subnet mask, but using a Boolean AND. 
A Boolean AND is a math operation performed to a pair of one-digit binary numbers. The 
result is another one-digit binary number. The actual math is even simpler than those ﬁrst 
two sentences! The following list shows the four possible inputs to a Boolean AND and the 
result:
■
0 AND 0 yields a 0.
■
0 AND 1 yields a 0.
■
1 AND 0 yields a 0.
■
1 AND 1 yields a 1.
In other words, the input to the equation consists of two one-digit binary numbers, and the 
output of the equation is one single-digit binary number. The only time the result is a binary 1 is 
when both input numbers are also binary 1; otherwise, the result of a Boolean AND is a 0.
You can perform a Boolean AND on longer binary numbers, but you are really just 
performing an AND on each pair of numbers. For instance, if you wanted to AND together 
two four-digit numbers 0110 and 0011, then you would perform an AND of the ﬁrst digit 
of each number and write down the answer. Then you would perform an AND on the second 
digit of each number, and so on, through the four digits. Table 12-4 shows the general idea.

The table separates the four digits of each original number to make the point more obvious. 
Look at the column holding the ﬁrst digit’s values. The ﬁrst digit of the ﬁrst number is 0, and 
the ﬁrst digit of the second number is also 0. 0 AND 0 yields a binary 0, which is listed as 
the Boolean AND result in that same column. Similarly, the second digits of the two original 
numbers are 1 and 0, respectively, so the Boolean AND result in the second digit column 
shows a 0. For the third digit, the two original numbers’ third digits were 1 and 1, so the 
AND result this time shows a binary 1. Finally, the fourth digits of the two original numbers 
were 0 and 1, so the Boolean AND result is 0 for that column in the table.
When you Boolean AND two longer binary numbers together, you actually perform what is 
called a bitwise Boolean AND. This term simply means that you do what the previous 
example showed: You AND together the ﬁrst digits from each of the two original numbers, 
then the second digits, and then the third, and so on, until the each pair of single-digit binary 
numbers has been ANDed.
IP subnetting math frequently uses a Boolean AND between two 32-bit binary numbers. The 
actual operation works just like the example in Table 12-4, except that it is longer.
To discover the subnet number in which a particular IP address resides, you perform a bitwise 
AND between the IP address and the subnet mask. Humans sometimes can look at an IP 
address and mask in decimal and derive the subnet number, but routers and other computers 
use a Boolean AND between the IP address and the subnet mask to ﬁnd the subnet number, so 
you should understand the process. In this chapter, you also will read about a process by which 
you can ﬁnd the subnet number without using any binary conversion or Boolean ANDs. 
An example of the derivation of a subnet number is shown in Table 12-5.  
First, focus only on the third column of the table. The binary version of the IP address 
150.150.2.1 is listed ﬁrst. The next row shows the 32-binary version of the subnet mask 
(255.255.255.0). The last row shows the results of a bitwise AND of the two numbers—in 
other words, the ﬁrst bit in each number is ANDed, then the second bit in each number, then

the third pair, and so on, until all 32 bits in the ﬁrst number have been ANDed with the bit 
in the same position in the second number.
The resulting 32-bit number is the subnet number in which 150.150.2.1 resides. All you have 
to do is convert the 32-bit number back to decimal, 8 bits at a time. So, the subnet number 
in this case is 150.150.2.0.
If you understand the basic idea but would like additional examples to make it more clear, 
read on. In the next section, you will use Boolean ANDs to answer basic questions about IP 
subnetting. Also, on the CD, look for the chapter titled “Subnetting Practice: 25 Subnetting 
Questions,” where 25 IP addressing practice questions are available, each with the binary 
math worked out for performing the Boolean AND.
Preﬁx Notation
Finally, any Cisco-oriented IP addressing coverage would be incomplete without a discussion 
of preﬁx notation. 
In this chapter, you will get more comfortable using subnet masks. The masks can be written 
in decimal form, or they can be written as a 32-bit binary number. However, there is a third 
alternative, called preﬁx notation, which allows a router to display mask information more 
succinctly. 
To understand preﬁx notation, it is important to know that all subnet masks have some 
number of consecutive binary 1s, followed by binary 0s. In other words, a subnet mask 
cannot have 1s and 0s interspersed throughout the mask—the mask always has some number 
of binary 1s, followed only by binary 0s.
Preﬁx notation simply denotes the number of binary 1s in a mask, preceded by a /. In other 
words, for subnet mask 255.255.255.0, whose binary equivalent is 11111111 11111111 
11111111 00000000, the equivalent preﬁx notation would be /24 because there are 24 
consecutive binary 1s in the mask. When talking about subnets, you can say things like “That 
subnet uses a slash 24 preﬁx” or “That subnet has a 24-bit preﬁx” instead of saying 
something like “That subnet uses a mask of 255.255.255.0.” 
Preﬁx notation makes talking about subnet masks a little easier, and it makes the information 
displayed by the router a little briefer as well. For instance, just try saying “255.255.255.0” 
out loud a few times, and imagine that the network is down while you’re saying it, and you 
will hear the beneﬁt. 
Now that the basic math tools have been covered, the speciﬁcs on how to use them to ﬁnd 
the right answers to subnetting questions are covered next. 

Analyzing and Interpreting IP Addresses and Subnets     329
How Many Hosts, and How Many Subnets?
You also should know how to ﬁgure out how many network, subnet, and host bits are used with 
that subnetting scheme. From those facts, you easily can ﬁgure out how many hosts exist in the 
subnet and how many subnets you can create in that network using that subnet mask. 
You already have learned that Class A, B, and C networks have either 8, 16, or 24 bits in 
their network ﬁelds, respectively. Those rules do not change. You also already have read that, 
without subnetting, Class A, B, and C addresses have 24, 16, or 8 bits in their host ﬁelds, 
respectively. With subnetting, the network part of the address does not shrink or change, but 
the host ﬁeld shrinks to make room for the subnet ﬁeld. So, the key to answering these types 
of questions is to ﬁgure out how many host bits remain after applying subnetting, which then 
can tell you the size of the subnet ﬁeld. The rest of the answers follow from those two facts.
The following facts tell you how to ﬁnd the sizes of the network, subnet, and host parts of 
an IP address:
■
The network part of the address always is deﬁned by class rules.
■
The host part of the address always is deﬁned by the mask; binary 0s in the mask mean 
that the corresponding address bits are part of the host ﬁeld.
■
The subnet part of the address is what’s left over in the 32-bit address. 
Table 12-6 lists these three key facts along with the ﬁrst example. If you have forgotten the 
ranges of values in the ﬁrst octet for addresses in Class A, B, and C networks, refer to Table 
12-2 earlier in the chapter.
In this example, there are 8 network bits because the address is in a Class A network, 8.0.0.0. 
There are 16 host bits because, when you convert 255.255.0.0 to binary, there are 16 binary 
0s—the last 16 bits in the mask. (If you do not believe me, look at Appendix B, in the binary-
to-decimal conversion chart. 255 decimal is eight binary 1s, and 0 decimal is eight binary 0s.) 
The size of the subnet part of the address is what’s left over, or 8 bits.

330     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Two other examples with easy-to-convert masks might help your understanding. Consider 
address 130.4.102.1, with mask 255.255.255.0. First, 130.4.102.1 is in a Class B network, 
so there are 16 network bits. A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 has only eight binary 0s, 
implying 8 host bits, which leaves 8 subnet bits in this case. 
For another example, consider 199.1.1.100, with mask 255.255.255.0. In fact, this example 
does not even use subnetting. 199.1.1.100 is in a Class C network, which means that there 
are 24 network bits. The mask has eight binary 0s, yielding 8 host bits, with no bits 
remaining for the subnet part of the address. In fact, if you remembered that the default mask 
for Class C networks is 255.255.255.0, you might have realized already that no subnetting 
was being used in this example.
Most of us can calculate the number of host bits easily if the mask uses only decimal 255s 
and 0s because it is easy to remember that decimal 255 represents 8 binary 1s, and decimal 
0 represents 8 binary 0s. So, for every decimal 0 in the mask, there are 8 host bits. However, 
when the mask uses other decimal values besides 0 and 255, deciphering the number of host 
bits is more difﬁcult. Examining the subnet masks in binary helps overcome the challenge. 
Consider the following addresses and masks, along with the binary version of the masks, as 
shown in Table 12-7.
The number of host bits implied by a mask becomes more apparent after converting the mask 
to binary. In the ﬁrst mask, 255.255.252.0, there are ten binary 0s, implying a 10-bit host 
ﬁeld. Because that mask is used with a Class B address (130.4.102.1), implying 16 network 
bits, there are 6 remaining subnet bits. In the second example, the mask has only ﬁve binary 
0s, for 5 host bits. Because the mask is used with a Class C address, there are 24 network 
bits, leaving only 3 subnet bits. The process so far is straightforward: 
■
The class rules deﬁne the network part.
■
The mask binary 0s deﬁne the host part. 
■
What’s left over deﬁnes the size of the subnet part. 
The only big problem occurs when the mask is tricky, which is true in the last two examples. 
When the mask is tricky, you have two alternatives for deciding how many host bits are 
deﬁned:
Table 12-7

■
Convert the mask to binary, using any method for conversion at your disposal, and count 
the number of zeros.
■
Convert the mask to binary after memorizing the nine decimal and binary values in Table 
12-8. These are the only nine valid decimal values used in a subnet mask. Converting a 
mask to binary without having to convert from decimal to binary will be much faster.
Table 12-8 lists the only valid decimal values in a mask and their binary equivalents. 
Memorizing these values will help you convert masks from between their decimal and binary 
forms more quickly on the exam.
Without the use of a calculator, PC, or decimal-to-binary conversion chart, binary 
conversion of a subnet mask becomes easy after memorizing this chart. The binary 
equivalents of 255 and decimal 0 are obvious. The other seven values are not. But notice the 
values in succession: Each value has an additional binary 1 and one less binary 0. Each mask 
value, in succession, shows a mask value that reduces the number of host bits by 1 and adds 
1 to the size of the subnet ﬁeld. If you simply memorize each decimal value and its binary 
equivalent, converting masks from decimal to binary will be a breeze. In fact, you could sit 
down to take the exam, and before starting, go ahead and write down the information in the 
table so you could easily refer to it during the exam.
So far, the book has not told you how to answer a question like this: 
Given an address and mask, how many subnets are there? And how many hosts are 
there in a single subnet?
Well, two simple formulas provide the answers, and the formulas are based on the 
information that you just learned how to derive:

332     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Number of subnets = 2number-of-subnet-bits – 2
Number of hosts per subnet = 2number-of-host-bits – 2
The formulas calculate the number of things that can be numbered using a binary number 
and then subtract 2 for two special cases. IP addressing conventions deﬁne that two subnets 
per network should not be used and that two hosts per subnet should not be used.
One reserved subnet, the subnet that has all binary 0s in the subnet ﬁeld, is called the zero 
subnet. The subnet with all binary 1s in the subnet ﬁeld is called the broadcast subnet—and 
it also is reserved. (Well, in fact, you can use both these subnets on a Cisco router, but it is 
recommended that you avoid using them. On the exam, the “right” answer is that you do 
not use them—hence the “minus 2” part of the 2number-of-subnet-bits – 2 formula.) In fact, the 
courses upon which CCNA is based now use the term discouraged instead of reserved, 
meaning that although those two subnets can be used, you should avoid it. 
IP addressing conventions also reserve two IP addresses per subnet: the ﬁrst (all binary 0s in 
the host ﬁeld) and last (all binary 1s in the host ﬁeld) addresses. No tricks exist to make these 
two addresses usable—they are indeed always reserved.
Table 12-9 summarizes the ﬁve examples used so far in this chapter.
The details of the algorithm used to answer subnetting questions about the number of hosts 
and subnets are summarized in the following list: 
Step 1
Identify the structure of the IP address.
Step 2
Identify the size of the network part of the address, based on Class A, 
B, and C rules.

values to convert the mask to binary more quickly.

What Is the Subnet Number, and What Are the IP Addresses in the Subnet?
One of the most common things you need to ﬁgure out is that after you know an IP address 
and subnet mask, you must answer questions about them. The question might be 
straightforward, such as “What is the subnet number?”, or it might be more subtle, such as 
“Which of the following IP addresses are in the same subnet as the stated address?” In either 
case, if you can dissect an IP address as described in this chapter, you can answer any 
variation of this type of question. 
In the next several sections, you will learn how to derive the subnet number and the subnet 
broadcast address. After deriving these two values, you easily can ﬁnd the range of valid IP 
addresses in the subnet. 
Finding the Subnet Number
Earlier, you learned that computers perform a Boolean AND of the address and mask to ﬁnd 
the subnet number. The following tables (Tables 12-10 through 12-14) show the Boolean 
AND process for the ﬁve examples used in the previous section of this chapter:

334     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Although the tables show the answers, they do not show the process. The steps taken to 
complete the tables are as follows:
Step 1
To begin, you start with a decimal address and mask stated in the 
question. 
Step 2
Then you must convert the two numbers to binary, as seen in all ﬁve 
examples. 
Step 3
Next, each bit is ANDed with the bit in the same position in the other 
number (in other words, a bitwise Boolean AND), giving the result of 
the Boolean AND. 
Step 4
Finally, the Boolean AND result must be converted back to decimal.
The last step in this process, conversion of the binary number back to decimal, is the step 
that causes most of the problems for people new to subnetting. In some cases, the conversion 
is simple. For instance, in the ﬁrst example, the subnet mask is 255.255.0.0. Because the 
mask has only 255s or 0s in decimal, the boundary between the subnet and host ﬁelds is on 
a byte boundary as well—between the second and third bytes, in this case. So, the conversion 
from binary back to decimal for the result of the Boolean AND—0000 1000 0000 0001 
0000 0000 0000 0000—typically does not pose a problem.
The confusing typically arises when the boundary between the subnet and host part of the 
address is in the middle of a byte, which occurs when the subnet mask has some value besides

0 or 255 decimal. For example, with 130.4.102.1, mask 255.255.252.0, the ﬁrst 6 bits of the 
third octet comprise the subnet ﬁeld, and the last 2 bits of the third octet, plus the entire 
fourth octet, comprise the host ﬁeld. The problem that some people experience is that they try to 
convert the 6-bit subnet part from binary to decimal, and the 10-bit host part to decimal. 
However, when converting binary to decimal to ﬁnd the dotted decimal IP address, you always 
convert the entire octet—even if part of the octet is in the subnet part of the address and part is 
in the host part of the address. 
So, in this example, the subnet number (130.4.100.0), in binary, is 1000 0010 0000 0100 
0110 0100 0000 0000. The entire third octet is shown in bold, which converts to 100 in 
decimal. When converting, each set of 8 bits is converted to decimal, giving 130.4.100.0. 
Finding the Subnet Broadcast Address
The subnet broadcast address, sometimes called the directed broadast address, can be used 
to send a packet to every device in a single subnet. However, few tools and protocols use the 
subnet broadcast address anymore. However, by calculating the subnet broadcast address, 
you easily can calculate the largest valid IP address in the subnet, which is an important part 
of answering subnetting questions.
There is a binary math operation to calculate the subnet broadcast address. However, there 
is a much easier process, especially if you already have the subnet number in binary: 
Change all the host bit values in the subnet number to binary 1s. 
You can examine this simple math behind calculating the subnet broadcast address in the ﬁve 
tables (Tables 12-15 through 12-19) that follow. The host parts of the addresses, masks, 
subnet numbers, and broadcast addresses are in bold.

336     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Simply by examining the subnet broadcast addresses in binary, you can see that they are 
identical to the subnet numbers, except that all host bits have a value of binary 1 instead of 
binary 0. (Look for the bold digits in the examples.)
Finding the Range of Valid IP Addresses in a Subnet
You also need to be able to ﬁgure out which IP addresses are in a particular subnet and which 
are not. You already know how to do the hard part of ﬁnding that answer. You know that 
in any subnet, two numbers are reserved. The two reserved numbers are the subnet number 
itself and the subnet broadcast address. The subnet number is the numerically smallest 
number in the subnet, and the broadcast address is the numerically largest number. So, the 
range of valid IP addresses starts with one more than the subnet number and ends with the 
address that is one less than the broadcast address. It’s that simple!

NOTE
For those of you who just want to know, to derive the broadcast address using 
Boolean math, ﬁrst start with the subnet number and mask, in binary. Invert the mask 
(“invert” means change all 1s to 0s, and all 0s to 1s). Then do a bitwise Boolean OR 
between the two 32-bit numbers. (An OR yields a 0 when both bits are 0 and yields a 1 in 
any other case.) The result is the subnet broadcast address.

Analyzing and Interpreting IP Addresses and Subnets     337
A formal deﬁnition of the “algorithm” to ﬁnd the ﬁrst and last IP addresses in a subnet after 
the subnet number and broadcast addresses are known is as follows:
■
For the ﬁrst valid IP address: Copy the subnet number, but add 1 to the fourth octet.
■
For the last valid IP address: Copy the subnet broadcast  address, but subtract 1 from 
the fourth octet.
■
The range of valid IP addresses starts with the ﬁrst number and ends with the last.
Tables 12-20 through 12-24 summarize the answers for the ﬁve examples used in this section.

Finding the Answers Without Using Binary
You actually can derive the subnet number and broadcast addresses without ever converting 
to and from binary, or performing Boolean math. Using the binary math required to ﬁnd the 
subnet number and broadcast address really does help you understand subnetting to some 
degree. To get the correct answers faster on the exam, you might want to avoid all the 
conversions and binary math.
If you can ﬁnd the subnet number and broadcast address, you easily can ﬁnd the range of 
valid addresses in the subnet. So, the easy math described in this section focuses on helping 
you ﬁnd the subnet number and broadcast address.
Easier Math with Easy Masks
Of all the possible subnet masks, three masks, 255.0.0.0,  255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0, 
use only 255s and 0s. I call these masks “easy” masks because you can ﬁnd the subnet 
number and broadcast address easily, without any real math tricks. In fact, some of you

might have realized already how to ﬁnd the answers when an easy mask is used—if so, go 
ahead and skip to the section titled “Easier Math with Difﬁcult Masks.”
In fact, of these three easy masks, 255.0.0.0 does not actually cause any subnetting. So, this 
section worries about only how to use the two easy masks that can be used for subnetting—
255.255.0.0 and 255.255.255.0.
The process is simple. To ﬁnd the subnet number, when given an IP address and a mask of 
255.255.0.0 or 255.255.255.0, do the following:
Step 1
Copy the ﬁrst two (mask 255.255.0.0) or ﬁrst three (mask 
255.255.255.0) octets from the original IP address.
Step 2
Write down 0s in the last two octets (mask 255.255.0.0) or the last 
octet (mask 255.255.255.0).
Yep, it’s that easy! Finding the subnet broadcast address is just as easy:
Do the same thing that you did for ﬁnding the subnet, but instead of writing down 
0s in the last octet or two, write down 255s.
When you know the subnet number and broadcast address, you easily can ﬁnd the ﬁrst and 
last IP addresses in the subnet, using the same simple logic covered earlier:
■
To ﬁnd the ﬁrst valid IP address in the subnet, copy the subnet number, but add 1 to the 
fourth octet.
■
To ﬁnd the last valid IP address in the subnet, copy the broadcast address, but subtract 
1 from the fourth octet.
Easier Math with Difﬁcult Masks
When the subnet mask is not 255.255.0.0 or 255.255.255.0, I consider the mask to be a 
difﬁcult mask. Why is it difﬁcult? Most people cannot easily derive the subnet number and 
broadcast address without using binary math. You can use the same binary processes exactly 
the same way, whether the mask is easy or difﬁcult. However, these binary processes take 
time to do when you cannot use a calculator. So, a quicker method for ﬁnding the same 
answers can help.  
The following process helps you ﬁnd the subnet number and broadcast address without 
binary math when using a difﬁcult mask. You also can ﬁnd 25 more problems with solutions 

340     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
on the CD chapter titled, “Subnetting Practice: 25 Subnetting Questions.” The process uses 
something I call a subnet chart, as shown in Table 12-25.
With the type of question this shortcut is helping you to answer, the question supplies the 
address and subnet mask. So, you would simply record the IP address and mask in the table, 
putting each octet in a different column.
The unusual part of this shortcut begins when you draw a box around the “interesting” octet 
in the table. I call a mask octet that’s not a 255 or a 0 the interesting octet because it is the 
octet that gives everyone heartburn when ﬁrst learning subnetting. The box draws attention 
to the tricky part of the logic used in this shortcut.
For example, consider 130.4.102.1, with mask 255.255.252.0. Because the third octet of the 
mask is not a 0 or a 255, the third octet is where the interesting part of the shortcut takes 
place. So, you would create a subnet chart, ﬁll in the address and mask, and draw a box 
around the third octet, as shown in Table 12-26.

Next, you should complete the chart for everything to the left of the box. To complete the 
chart, look at the original IP address octets to the left of the box, and copy those into the 
subnet, ﬁrst valid address, broadcast, and last valid address ﬁelds. Note that only octets fully 
to the left of the box should be copied—the interesting octet, which is inside the box, should 
not be copied. Table 12-27 shows the same example, after this step. 
To ﬁnd the subnet number, you have a couple of steps. The ﬁrst step is easy. In the subnet 
number, for any octets fully to the right of the box, write down a 0. That should leave you 
with one octet of the subnet number missing—the interesting octet.
Next comes the tricky part of this shortcut, which gives you the value of the subnet number 
in the interesting octet. First, you ﬁnd what I will call the magic number—which is 256 minus 
the mask’s interesting octet. In this case, you have 256 – 252, or a magic number of 4. Then 
you ﬁnd the multiple of the magic number that is the closest to the address’s interesting octet, 
but less than or equal to it. In this example, 100 is a multiple of the magic number (4 ∗ 25), 
and this multiple is less than or equal to 102. The next-higher multiple of the magic number, 
which is 104, is, of course, more than 102, so that’s not the right number. The multiple of 
the magic number closest to but not more than the address’s interesting octet is the subnet’s 
interesting octet value. The following items summarize this important step:
Step 1
Find the magic number, which is 256 minus the value of the mask’s 
interesting octet.
Step 2
Find the multiple of the magic number that is closest to, but not greater 
than, the address’s interesting octet.
Step 3
Write down that multiple of the magic number as the value of the 
subnet number’s interesting octet.
In this example, simply plug in 100 for the third octet of the subnet number in Table 12-27.

When you know the subnet number, you easily can ﬁnd the ﬁrst valid IP address in the 
subnet: 
To ﬁnd the ﬁrst valid IP address in the subnet, copy the subnet number, but add 1 
to the fourth octet. 
That’s all! Table 12-28 shows the same example, but with the subnet number and ﬁrst valid 
IP address shown
To review, in Table 12-28, the ﬁrst two octets of the subnet number and ﬁrst valid address 
already were ﬁlled in because they are to the left of the box around the third octet—the 
interesting octet, in this case. In the subnet number, the last octet is 0 because it is to the right 
of the box. To ﬁnd the interesting octet value, compare the IP address’s interesting octet to 
ﬁnd the closest multiple of the magic number that’s not larger, which is 100 in this case. To 
get the ﬁrst valid address, just add 1 to the last octet of the subnet number, giving you 
130.4.100.1.
The ﬁnal step in the shortcut ﬁnds the broadcast address, from which you easily can ﬁnd the 
last valid address in the subnet. First, in the broadcast address, write down a decimal 255 for 
all octets to the right of the line or the box. Do not write down a 255 in the octet inside the 
box. Remember, the octets to the left of the box in the subnet chart already should have been 
ﬁlled in, leaving a single octet with no value—the interesting octet. To ﬁll in the interesting 
octet of the broadcast address, you again use the magic number. The magic number is 256 
minus the mask’s interesting octet. In this case, you have 256 – 252, or a magic number of 4. 
Then you add the magic number to the interesting octet value of the subnet number and 
subtract 1. The result is the broadcast address’s value in the interesting octet. In this case, the 
value is as follows: 
100 + 4 (magic number) – 1 = 103

When you know the broadcast address, you easily can ﬁnd the last valid IP address in the 
subnet: 
To ﬁnd the last valid IP address in the subnet, copy the broadcast address, but 
subtract 1 from the fourth octet. 
To summarize the tricky part of this shortcut algorithm:
To ﬁnd the broadcast address’s interesting octet value, take the subnet number’s 
interesting octet value, add the magic number, and subtract 1.
Table 12-29 shows the completed answers, with annotations.
The entire process for dissecting IP addresses that use difﬁcult masks is now complete. The 
following list summarizes the tasks in each step:

Becoming proﬁcient at this shortcut will take some practice. To make sure you have the 
process down, review the examples in the CD chapter, “Subnetting Practice: 25 Subnetting 
Questions,” which has 25 different examples, including the Boolean AND and shortcut 
methods of ﬁnding the subnet number.
What Subnet Masks Meet the Stated Design Requirements?
So far in this chapter, the text has explained how to answer questions that provide the subnet 
number. However, some questions do not supply the subnet number, but instead ask you to 
choose the “correct” subnet mask, given a set of requirements. The most common of these 
questions reads something like this: 
You are using Class B network X, and you need to have 200 subnets, with at most 
200 hosts per subnet. Which of the following subnet masks can be used? (followed 
by some subnet masks that you can pick from for the answer)
The ﬁnd the correct answers to these types of questions, you ﬁrst need to decide how many 
subnet bits and host bits you need to meet the requirements. Basically, the number of hosts 
per subnet is 2x – 2, where x is the number of host bits in the address. Likewise, the number 
of subnets of a network, assuming that the same subnet mask is used all over the network, is 
also 2x – 2, but with x being the number of subnet bits. When you know how many subnet 
bits and host bits are required, you can ﬁgure out what mask, or masks, meet the stated 
design goals in the question.
Examples certainly help; the ﬁrst example question reads like this:
Your network can use Class B network 130.1.0.0. What subnet masks meet 
the requirement that you plan to allow at most 200 subnets, with at most 
200 hosts per subnet?

Analyzing and Interpreting IP Addresses and Subnets     345
First, you need to ﬁgure out how many subnet bits allow for 200 subnets. You simply can 
use the formula 2x – 2 and plug in values for x, until one of the numbers is at least 200. In 
this case, x turns out to be 8—in other words, you need at least 8 subnet bits to allow for 
200 subnets.
If you do not want to keep plugging in values into the 2x – 2 formula, you can instead 
memorize Table 12-30.
As you can see, if you already have the powers of 2 memorized, you really do not need to 
memorize the table—just remember the formula.
As for the ﬁrst example question, 7 subnet bits are not enough because that allows for only 
126 subnets. You need 8 subnet bits. Similarly, because you need up to 200 hosts per subnet, 
you need 8 host bits.
Finally, you need to decide somehow what mask(s) to use, knowing that you have a Class B 
network and that you must have at least 8 subnet bits and 8 host bits. Using the letter N to 
represent network bits, the letter S to represent subnet bits, and the letter H to represent host 
bits, the following text shows the sizes of the various ﬁelds:
NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN SSSSSSSS HHHHHHHH

346     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
All that is left is to derive the actual subnet mask. Because you need 8 bits for the subnet ﬁeld 
and 8 for the host ﬁeld, and the network ﬁeld takes up 16 bits, you already have allocated 
all 32 bits of the address structure. So, only one possible subnet mask works. To ﬁgure out 
the mask, you need to write down the 32-bit subnet mask, applying the following fact and 
subnet masks:
The network and subnet bits in a subnet mask are, by deﬁnition, all binary 1s. 
Similarly, the host bits in a subnet mask are, by deﬁnition, all binary 0s.
So, the only valid subnet mask, in binary, is this:
11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
When converted to decimal, this is 255.255.255.0.
A second example shows how the requirements stated in the question might allow for 
multiple possible subnet masks. For instance:
Your network can use Class B network 130.1.0.0. What subnet masks meet the 
requirement that you plan to allow at most 50 subnets, with at most 200 hosts per 
subnet?
For this design, you still need at least 8 host bits, but now you need only at least 6 subnet 
bits. Six subnet bits would allow for 26 – 2, or 62, subnets. Following the same convention 
as before, but now using an x for bits that can be either subnet or host bits, the format of the 
address struture would be as follows:
NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN SSSSSSXX HHHHHHHH
In other words, the addresses will have 16 network bits, at least 6 subnet bits, and at least 8 
host bits. This example actually allows for three valid subnet masks, whose strcuture are as 
follows:
NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN SSSSSSSS HHHHHHHH—8 subnet, 8 host
NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN SSSSSSSH HHHHHHHH—7 subnet, 9 host
NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN SSSSSSHH HHHHHHHH—6 subnet, 10 host 
So, based on the requirements in the question, three different valid subnet masks meet the 
requirements. The three values are as follows:
11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000  255.255.255.0 
11111111 11111111 11111110 00000000  255.255.254.0
11111111 11111111 11111100 00000000  255.255.252.0
The 2 bits that could be subnet bits or host bits, based on the requirements, are shown in bold.

What Are the Other Subnet Numbers?
The ﬁnal general type of IP addresing and subnetting question covered in this chapter asks 
you to list all the subnets of a particular network. You could use a long process, which requires 
you to count in binary and convert many numbers from binary to decimal. However, because 
most people would either learn the shortcut or use a subnet calculator in their normal jobs, I 
decided to just show you the shortcut method for this particular type of question.
First, the question needs a better deﬁnition—or, at least, a more complete one. The question 
might be better stated like this: 
If the same subnet mask is used for all subnets of this Class A, B, or C network, 
what are the valid subnets? 
IP design conventions do not require the engineer to use the same mask for every subnet. 
Unless speciﬁcally stated, the question “What are all the subnets?” probably assumes that the 
same mask is used for all subnets, unless the question speciﬁcally states that different masks 
can be used on different subnets.
The following easy decimal process lists all the valid subnets, given the network number, and 
the only mask used on that network. This three-step process assumes that the size of the 
subnet part of the address is, at most, 8 bits in length. The same general process can be 
expanded to work when the size of the subnet part of the address is more than 8 bits, but 
that expanded process is not described here. 
The three-step process uses a chart that I call the subnet list chart. I made up the name just 
for this book, simply as another tool to use. Table 12-31 presents a generic version of the 
subnet list chart. 
You list the known network number and subnet mask as the ﬁrst step in the process. If the 
question gives you an IP address and mask instead of the network number and mask, just

348     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
write down the network number of which that IP address is a member. (Remember, this 
three-step process assumes that the subnet part of the addresses is 8 bits or less.) 
For the second of the three steps, copy the network number into the row labeled “Subnet 
Zero.” Subnet zero, or the zero subnet, is numerically the ﬁrst subnet, and it is one of the two 
reserved subnet numbers in a network. (You can use the zero subnet on a Cisco router if you 
conﬁgure the global conﬁguration command ip zero-subnet.) Interestingly, a network’s zero 
subnet has the exact same numeric value as the network itself—which is one of the reasons 
that it should not be used. For the purposes of answering questions on the exam about the 
number of valid subnets in a network, consider the zero subnet unusable unless the question 
tells you that using it is ok. In real life, do not use the zero subnet if you do not have to.
The third step in the process will be covered after Tables  12-32 and 12-33, which list two 
familiar examples, with the ﬁrst two steps completed. 
The last step in this process, Step 3, is repeated many times. This last step uses  the magic 
number, which is 256 minus the mask octet value in the interesting octet. With this process 
of ﬁnding all the subnet numbers, the interesting octet is the octet that contains all of the 
subnet part of the addresses. (Remember, the process assumes 8 or fewer subnet bits!) In both 
Tables 11-32 and 11-33, the interesting octet is the third octet.
The third and ﬁnal step in the process to ﬁnd all the subnet numbers goes like this: Starting 
with the last row that’s completed in the table, do the following:
a. Because this process assumes 1 byte or less in the subnet part of the addresses, on 
the next row of the table, copy down the three octets that are not part of the subnet 
ﬁeld. Call the octet that is not copied down the “subnet octet” or “interesting 
octet.”

b. Add the magic number to the previous subnet octet, and write that down as the 
value of the subnet octet.
c. Repeat the last two tasks until the next number that you would write down in the 
subnet octet is 256. (Don’t write that one down—it’s not valid.)
The idea behind the process of ﬁnding all the subnets becomes apparent by reviewing the 
same two examples used earlier. First, Table 12-34 lists the example with the easy mask. Note 
that the magic number is 256 – 255 = 1 in this case, and that the third octet is the interesting 
subnet octet.
The logic behind how the process works might be better understood by looking at the ﬁrst few 
entries and then the last few entries. The zero subnet is found easily because it’s the same number 
as the network number. The magic number is 256 – 255 = 1, in this case. Essentially, you 
increment the third octet (in this case) by the magic number for each successive subnet number.
In the middle of the table, one row is labeled “Skipping a Bunch.” Instead of making the book 
even bigger, I left out several entries but included enough that you could see that the subnet 
number’s third octet just gets bigger by 1, in this case, for each successive subnet number.
Looking at the end of the table, the last entry lists 255 in the third octet. 256 decimal is never 
a valid value in any IP address, and the directions said to not write down a subnet with 256 
in it, so the last number in the table is 130.4.255.0. The last subnet is the broadcast subnet, 
which is the other reserved subnet number. The subnet before the broadcast subnet is the 
highest, or last, valid subnet number.

350     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
With a simple subnet mask, the process of answering this type of question is very simple. In 
fact, many people might even refer to these subnets using just the third octet. If all subnets 
of a particular organization were in network 130.4.0.0, with mask 255.255.255.0, you 
might say simply “subnet ﬁve” when referring to subnet 130.4.5.0.
The process works the same with difﬁcult subnet masks, even though the answers are not as 
intuitive. Table 12-35 lists the answers for the second example, using a mask of 
255.255.252.0 The third octet is again the interesting subnet octet, but this time the magic 
number is 256 – 252 = 4.
The ﬁrst subnet number numerically, the zero subnet, starts the list. By adding the magic 
number in the interesting octet, you ﬁnd the rest of the subnet numbers. Like the previous 
example, to save space in the book, many subnet numbers were skipped.
Most of us would not guess that 130.4.252.0 was the broadcast subnet for this latest 
example. However, adding the magic number 4 to 252 would give you 256 as the next subnet 
number, which is not valid—so, 130.4.252.0 is indeed the broadcast subnet.
The three-step process to ﬁnd all the subnet numbers of a network is shown here:
1.
Write down the network number and subnet mask in the ﬁrst two rows of the subnet list 
chart.
2.
Write down the network number in the third row. This is the zero subnet, which is one 
of the two reserved subnets.

Scaling the IP Address Space for the Internet     351
3.
Do the following two tasks, stopping when the next number that you would write down 
in the interesting column is 256. (Don’t write that one down—it’s not valid.)
a. Copy all three noninteresting octets from the previous line.
b. Add the magic number to the previous interesting octet, and write that down as the 
value of the interesting octet.
Scaling the IP Address Space for the Internet
The original design for the Internet required every organization to ask for and receive one or 
more registered IP network numbers. The people administering the program ensured that 
none of the IP network numbers was used by multiple companies or organizations. As long 
as every organization used only IP addresses inside their own registered network numbers, 
then IP addresses would never be duplicated and IP routing could work well. 
Connecting to the Internet using only a registered network number or several registered 
network numbers worked very well for a while. In the early and mid-1990s, it became 
apparent that the Internet was growing so fast that all IP network numbers would be 
assigned by the mid-1990s. Concern arose that all the network numbers would be assigned, 
so some organizations would not be capable of connecting to the Internet. It would have been 
the equivalent of calling the local phone company to ask for a new phone line to be installed 
and being told that the company ran out of numbers; you would have to wait until someone 
didn’t want a phone number any more!
This last section covers several features that together have allowed the Internet to grow, 
without letting us run out of IP addresses. Network Address Translation (NAT), along with 
a feature called private addressing, allows organizations to use unregistered IP network 
numbers internally and still communicate well with the Internet. Classless Interdomain 
Routing (CIDR) allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to reduce the wasting of IP 
addresses, by assigning a company a subset of a network number instead of the entire 
network. CIDR also reduces the size of Internet routing tables, allowing the Internet to grow. 
Also, a new version of IP, IP Version 6, uses much larger addresses, 128-bit long addresses, 
which allow for (hopefully) enough IP addresses so that we will never possibly run out again. 
CIDR
CIDR is a convention deﬁned in RFC 1817 (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1817.txt) that calls for 
aggregating multiple network numbers into a single routing entity. CIDR actually was 
created to help the scalability of Internet routers—imagine a router in the Internet with a 
route to every Class A, B, and C network on the planet! There are actually a little more than 
two million Class C networks alone! By aggregating the routes, Internet routers have a 
signiﬁcantly smaller number of routes in their routing tables. 

352     Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Figure 12-5 shows a typical case of how CIDR might be used to consolidate routes to 
multiple Class C networks into a single route.
Figure 12-5
Typical Use of CIDR
Imagine that ISP 1 owns Class C networks 198.0.0.0 through 198.255.255.0 (they might 
look funny, but they are valid Class C network numbers). Without CIDR, all other ISPs’ 
routing tables would have a separate route to each of the 216 Class C networks that begin 
with 198. With CIDR, as the illustration shows, the other ISPs’ routers will have a single 
route to 198.0.0.0/8—in other words, a route to all hosts whose IP address begins with 198. More 
than two million Class C networks alone exist, but CIDR has helped Internet routers reduce their 
routing tables to a more manageable size, in the range of 120,000 routes by mid-2003.
By using a routing protocol that exchanges the mask as well as the subnet/network number, 
a classless view of the number can be attained. In other words, routers treat the grouping as 
a math problem, ignoring the Class A, B, and C rules. For instance, 198.0.0.0/8 (198.0.0.0, 
mask 255.0.0.0) deﬁnes a set of addresses whose ﬁrst 8 bits are equal to decimal 198. This 
route is advertised by ISP 1 to the other ISPs, which need a route only to 198.0.0.0/8. In its 
routers, ISP 1 knows which Class C networks are at which customer sites. This is how CIDR 
gives Internet routers a much more scalable routing table, by reducing the number of entries 
in the tables.
For CIDR to work as shown in Figure 12-5, ISPs need to be in control of consecutive network 
numbers. Today IP networks are allocated by administrative authorities for various regions 
of the world, which, in turn, allocate consecutive ranges of network numbers to particular 
ISPs in those regions. This allows summarization of multiple networks into a single route, as 
shown in Figure 12-5.

CIDR also helps to reduce the chance that we will run out of IP addresses for new companies 
connecting to the Internet. CIDR also allows an ISP to allocate a subset of a Class A, B, or 
C network to a single customer. For instance, imagine that ISP 1’s Customer 1 needs only 10 
IP addresses and that Customer 3 needs 25 IP addresses. So, ISP 1 does something like this: 
It assigns IP subnet 198.8.3.16/28, with assignable addresses 198.8.17 to 198.8.30, to 
Customer 1. For Customer 3, ISP 1 suggests 198.8.3.32/27, with 30 assignable addresses 
(198.8.3.33 to 198.8.3.62). (Feel free to check the math with the IP addressing algorithms 
listed earlier.)
CIDR helps prevent the wasting of IP addresses, thereby reducing the need for registered IP 
network numbers. Instead of the two customers consuming two whole Class C networks, 
each consumes a small portion of a single Class C network. At the same time, CIDR, along 
with the intelligent administration of consecutive network numbers to each ISP, allows the 
Internet routing table to support a much smaller routing table in Internet routers than 
otherwise would be required. 
Private Addressing
Some computers will never be connected to the Internet. These computers’ IP addresses could 
be duplicates of registered IP addresses in the Internet. So, when designing the IP addressing 
convention for such a network, an organization could pick and use any network number(s) 
that it wanted, and all would be well. For instance, you can buy a few routers, connect them 
together in your ofﬁce, and conﬁgure IP addresses in network 1.0.0.0 and make it work. The 
IP addresses that you use might be duplicates of real IP addresses in the Internet, but if all 
you want to do is learn on the lab in your ofﬁce, all is well.
When building a private network that will have no Internet connectivity, you also can use IP 
network numbers called private internets, as deﬁned in RFC 1918, “Address Allocation for 
Private Internets” (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt). This RFC deﬁnes a set of networks that 
never will be assigned to any organization as a registered network number. Instead of using 
someone else’s registered network numbers, you can use numbers in a range that are not used 
by anyone in the public Internet. Table 12-36 shows the private address space deﬁned by 
RFC 1918.

In other words, any organization can use these network numbers. However, no organization 
is allowed to advertise these networks using a routing protocol on the Internet.
Many of you might be wondering, “Why bother reseverving special private network 
numbers when it doesn’t matter whether the addresses are duplicates?” Well, as it turns out, 
you can use private addressing in a network and use the Internet at the same time, as long as 
you use the next feature covered in this chapter—Network Address Translation (NAT). 
Network Address Translation
NAT, deﬁned in RFC 1631, allows a host that does not have a valid registered IP address to 
communicate with other hosts through the Internet. Of course, if you do not have to use a 
registered IP address, you can help avoid the day when we run out of available IP addresses! 
NAT allows these addresses that are not Internet-ready to continue to be used but still allows 
communication with hosts across the Internet. The ICND exam covers NAT in more detail, 
including conﬁguration.
To conserve addresses, NAT uses an additional feature called Port Address Translation 
(PAT). PAT takes advantage of the fact that a server really does not care whether it has one 
connection each to three different hosts, or three connections to a single host IP address. So, 
to support lots of private IP addresses with only one or a few publicly registered IP addresses, 
NAT/PAT translates the private IP address into a valid public address as the packet exits the 
private IP network. However, instead of just translating the IP address, it also translates the 
port number. Figure 12-6 outlines the logic.

Scaling the IP Address Space for the Internet     355
The NAT router keeps a NAT table entry for every unique combination of private IP address 
and port, with translation to the public IP address and a unique port number associated with 
the public IP address. Because the port number ﬁeld has 16 bits, NAT/PAT can support more 
than 64,000 connections using one public IP address, which helps the IP address space scale. 
IP Version 6 Addressing
The short-term solution to the problem of depleting the entire IPv4 address space included 
NAT and private addressing. CIDR provider a short-term solution to the growing size of IP 
routing tables. The long-term solution to both problems, at least according to some, is to use 
a new version of the IP protocol—Version 6 (IPv6). (The version discussed in this book is 
Version 4. Version 5 was deﬁned for experimental reasons and never was deployed.) 
IPv6 calls for a much larger address structure so that the convention of all organizations 
using unique groupings (networks) of IP addresses still would be reasonable—the numbers 
of IPv6-style networks would reach into the trillions and beyond. That solution is still 
technically viable and possibly one day will be used. However, many people believe that the 
short-term solutions have made IPv4 viable for a long time, and they see no reason to 
upgrade. Others think that IPv6 is inevitable. Cisco simply supports both options, so 
whatever happens, it will still be able to sell products.
IPv6 uses a 128-bit IP address written in hexadecimal notation, with colons between each 
quartet of symbols. How many addresses can you possibly have with a 128-bit number? The 
only answer that matters in real life is “more than you can possibly ever need.” The number 
is around 3.4 × 1038—yes, that’s a 39-digit decimal number. It’s huge! You could have a 
million IP addresses per every person who ever has lived and still not have run out. So, a 
migration to IPv6 certainly looks like it solves the IP address scalability problem—the only 
question is whether the other short-term solutions, such as NAT and CIDR, have solved 
IPv4’s problems so well that no one wants to migrate to IPv6.
Table 12-37 summarizes some of the pertinent information comparing IPv4 addresses with IPv6.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam(s), a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the 
details in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
The thought process used to answer questions about the number of hosts and subnets in a 
network, based on a network number and a subnet mask, is summarized in the following list: 
Step 1
Identify the structure of the IP address.
Step 2
Identify the size of the network part of the address, based on Class A, 
B, and C rules.
Step 3
Identify the size of the host part of the address, based on the number of 
binary 0s in the mask. 
Step 4
The size of the subnet part is what’s left over; mathematically, it is 
32 – (number of network + host bits).
Step 5
Declare the number of subnets, which is 2number-of-subnet-bits – 2.
Step 6
Declare the number of hosts per subnet, which is 2number-of-host-bits – 2.
A formal deﬁnition of the “algorithm” to ﬁnd the ﬁrst and last IP addresses in a subnet when 
the subnet number and broadcast addresses are known is as follows:
■
For the ﬁrst valid IP address: Copy the subnet number, but add 1 to the fourth octet.
■
For the last valid IP address: Copy the broadcast address, but subtract 1 from the fourth 
octet.
■
The range of valid IP addresses starts with the ﬁrst number and ends with the last.
To ﬁnd the subnet number, perform a Boolean AND between the address and the subnet 
mask. For example, see Table 12-38.
Table 12-38
Bitwise Boolean AND Example
Decimal

Result of AND

1001 0110 1001 0110 0000 0010 0000 0000

Foundation Summary     357
To ﬁnd the subnet broadcast address, take the subnet number in binary and change all the 
host bits to binary 1s.
The following three-step process lists all the subnet numbers of a network. The process refers 
to the chart that follows the three-step list:
Step 1
Write down the network number and subnet mask in the ﬁrst two rows 
of the subnet list chart.
Step 2
Write down the network number in the third row. This is the zero 
subnet, which is one of the two reserved subnets.
Step 3
Do the following two tasks, stopping when the next number that you 
would write down in the interesting column is 256. (Don’t write that 
one down—it’s not valid.)
a.
Copy all three noninteresting octets from the previous line.
b.
Add the magic number to the previous interesting octet, and write that 
down as the value of the interesting octet. (See Table 12-39).

Q&A
As mentioned in the introduction, you have two choices for review questions. The questions 
that follow give you a bigger challenge than the exam itself by using an open-ended question 
format. By reviewing now with this more difﬁcult question format, you can exercise your 
memory better and prove your conceptual and factual knowledge of this chapter. The 
answers to these questions are found in Appendix A.
For those of you who want more questions and practice with subnetting, you have a couple 
of options. You can look at the appendix on the CD titled “Subnetting Practice: 25 
Subnetting Questions.” Also, if you bought the two-book set and you already own the 
CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, you can look at the questions at the end of Chapter 
4 of that book. Chapter 4 of the other book repeats what is inside this chapter, for readers 
who buy just that book. However, more than half of the questions at the end of that chapter 
are different than the ones in this chapter, so you can get some more practice.
For more practice with exam-like question formats, including questions using a router 
simulator and multiple-choice questions, use the exam engine on the CD.

Basic Router Conﬁguration 
and Operation
To conﬁgure a Cisco router to route TCP/IP packets, you typically conﬁgure an IP 
address and subnet mask on each interface. You also typically conﬁgure a dynamic 
routing protocol, which discovers the routes in a network. That’s all the conﬁguration 
that is required to make a Cisco router route IP packets.
In this chapter, you will read about the basic commands to conﬁgure IP addresses and IP 
routing on a Cisco router. You also will read about a variety of commands that you can 
use to discover how the router is working. By the end of this chapter, you will know how 
to conﬁgure Cisco routers to implement a simple IP network—with the exception that 
you will not yet have seen how to conﬁgure IP routing protocols. Chapter 14, 
“Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols,” covers many of the concepts behind 
routing protocols, and chapters in the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide will show 
you how to conﬁgure several routing protocols.

Conﬁguring IP Addresses 
You easily can conﬁgure a Cisco router to forward IP trafﬁc when you understand IP 
addressing and the IOS conﬁguration process described in Chapter 7, “Operating Cisco 
Routers.” This chapter shows you examples of a variety of commands used to conﬁgure and 
troubleshoot the routing of IP packets in a Cisco router. Tables 13-2 and 13-3 summarize 
many of the most common commands used for IP conﬁguration and veriﬁcation.
You can refer to other sources for more information about basic IP conﬁguration on Cisco 
routers. The Cisco IOS documentation is an excellent reference for additional IP commands 
(see www.cisco.com/univercd/home/home.htm). Also, the Cisco Press book Interconnecting 
Cisco Network Devices is an excellent reference, particularly if you are not able to attend the 
instructor-led version of the class. This chapter focuses on the most common commands—
the ones most likely to be on the CCNA exams.

Most of the examples in this chapter refer to the routers in Figure 13-1. The ﬁgure shows a

Basic Administrative Conﬁguration
Chapter 7 focused on the conﬁguration process more than the actual conﬁguration 
commands that happened to be in the chapter. Before you conﬁgure IP, this short section 
reviews some of the basic commands you typically will conﬁgure on any router.
On most routers, you would conﬁgure at least the following:
■
A host name for the router
■
Reference to a DNS so that commands typed on the router can refer to host names 
instead of IP addresses
■
Set a password on the console port
■
Set a password for those Telnetting to the router
■
Set the enable secret password to protect access to privileged mode
■
Create a banner stating an appropriate warning, depending on the security practices at 
that company

Conﬁguring IP Addresses     371
Example 13-1 shows the output of the show running-conﬁg command on Albuquerque. The 
functions described in the list have been conﬁgured using the commands that are highlighted 
in the example.
None of the commands highlighted in Example 13-1 is required for the router to route IP, 
but the commands are generally useful in real networks. Of note, to make the router ask for 
a password at the console, you need the login console subcommand; the password console

subcommand tells the router what password is required at the console. Similar logic applies 
to the login and password vty subcommands. And although you do not have to refer to a 
name server, when you do, you typically refer to at least two because most networks have at 
least two name servers for redundancy and availability.
When conﬁguring the enable secret command, you type the password just like you want the 
user to type it when logging in to the router; however, the IOS changes the value that is saved 
in the conﬁguration. For instance, for Example 13-1, I typed enable secret cisco, and the 
router changed cisco to a hashed value that cannot be converted back to cisco.
Two other things that you might want to conﬁgure habitually on routers are the console 
timeout and the synchronization of unsolicited messages. In some cases, you want the router 
to exit the user from the console after a period of inactivity. In other cases, you do not want 
the console disabled at all because of inactivity. The exec timeout minutes seconds command 
sets the inactivity timeout. Also, unsolicited informational messages and output from the IOS 
debug command both show up at the console by default. These same messages can be seen 
at the aux port or when Telnetting into a router by using the terminal monitor command. 
The logging synchronous line subcommand tells the router not to interrupt the output of a 
show command with these unsolicited messages, letting you read the output of the command 
that you typed before the router displays the other messages. logging synchronous can make 
your life a lot easier when using a router.
Conﬁguring IP Addresses
Before you conﬁgure IP address, you ﬁrst must decide what IP addresses to conﬁgure. Figure 
13-1 not only outlined the network diagram, but it also listed the IP addresses chosen for the 
network. In this case, network 10.0.0.0 hs been subnetted with six subnets and a mask of 
255.255.255.0.
After you have chosen the IP addresses and masks, conﬁguration is simple. Examples 13-2, 
13-3, and 13-4 show the IP conﬁguration details for the three routers in Figure 13-1. The full 
conﬁguration for Albuquerque is shown in Example 13-2, with a briefer version of the 
conﬁgs of the other two routers in Examples 13-3 and 13-4.

Conﬁguring IP Addresses     375
The ip address interface subcommand conﬁgures the IP address for each interface, as seen in 
the highlighted portions of the examples. Because each interface has an IP address, the 
interface conﬁguration command precedes each ip address command, identifying to IOS the 
interface to which the IP address should be assigned. It’s that simple!
Preﬁx Notation
At the end of Example 13-2 (Albuquerque), you also see the results of the show ip route 
command. The output of the command lists the network (10.0.0.0), followed by the notation 
of /24. This notation, called preﬁx notation, denotes the subnet mask in terms of the number 
of 1 bits in the subnet mask. The number of bits of value binary 1 in the mask is considered 
to be the preﬁx. For instance, mask 255.255.255.0, used in the examples, translates to a 
preﬁx of /24 because 255.255.255.0 has 24 binary 1s. Preﬁx notation is simply a shorter way 
to write the mask.
If you prefer to see the subnet masks instead of the preﬁx, simply use the terminal ip netmask-
format decimal exec command, as shown at the end of Example 13-2. Note that the show ip 
route command issued after the terminal command shows the subnet mask instead of the 
preﬁx. 
Seeding the Routing Table with Connected IP Routes
The Cisco IOS routes IP packets by default—in other words, you do not need to type any 
commands to tell the router to enable IP routing. Before the router will route packets in or 
out an interface, the interface must have an IP address, as shown in the earlier examples. So, 
as conﬁgured, each of the three routers can route packets on three different interfaces.

376     Chapter 13: Basic Router Configuration and Operation
The problem with the conﬁgurations shown so far is that the routers do not know routes to 
all the subnets in the network. The ultimate solution to this problem is to conﬁgure a 
dynamic routing protocol. However, in this chapter, you will learn about how the router 
learns some routes by virtue of the conﬁguration of IP addresses on the interface. Chapter 14 
introduces the different IP routing protocols, and the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide covers the detailed concepts and conﬁguration for several IP routing protocols.
Routers add routes to their routing tables for the subnets associated with their own physical 
interfaces. To get a better appreciation of this fact, examine Example 13-5, which shows 
several commands from the Seville router.

Seville Router Routing Table and Interface Status Commands (Continued)

378     Chapter 13: Basic Router Configuration and Operation
First, here is a quick introduction to the four commands in the example. The show ip route 
command lists routes to the three subnets connected to the Seville router, namely 10.1.130.0, 
10.1.129.0, and 10.1.3.0, all with mask 255.255.255.0 (preﬁx /24). The output from the 
command lists a C in the ﬁrst column, which, according to the notes at the beginning of the 
command output, means “connected.” In other words, this router is connected directly to 
these subnets.
Following the show ip route command, the example contains three commands that list 
information about the interfaces in the router. The show ip interfaces brief command lists 
one line per interface, with IP address information and interface status. Next, the show 
interfaces serial 0 command lists more details about a single interface, with most of those 
details about the interface itself. Finally, the show ip interfaces serial 1 command shows 
detailed information about the IP protocol running over interface serial 1. 
IOS adds connected routes to the routing table that meet the following requirements:
■
The interface has been conﬁgured with a valid IP address.
■
The interface is in an up and up status according to the various interface-oriented show 
commands.
All three of the show commands in Example 13-5 that list interface status information use 
two designations of up and up. The ﬁrst status keyword (the ﬁrst of the two ups in this case) 
generally refers to OSI Layer 1 status. For instance, if there is no cable plugged in, the ﬁrst 
status word would be down instead of up. The second status word generally refers to the 
status of OSI Layer 2. For instance, if Seville defaulted to use HDLC on serial 0, but 
Albuquerque conﬁgured PPP as the data-link protocol on its serial 1 interface on the other 
end of the link, the interface status on each end would show up and down. 
Another instance in which a router might put an interface in status up and down is when the 
router does not receive keepalive messages on a regular basis. Cisco routers send, and expect 
to receive, proprietary keepalive messages on each interface. The purpose of the keepalives 
is to know whether the interface is usable. For instance, on a point-to-point link between 
Albuquerque and Yosemite, each router sends a keepalive every 10 seconds. As long as they 
each receive a keepalive every 10 seconds, they think the link is up and up. If Yosemite did 
not hear a keepalive for three times the keepalive interval (default 10-second interval, for a 
total of 30 seconds), Yosemite would put the interface into an up and down status. You can 
disable keepalives with the no keepalive interface subcommand, or you can change the timer 
with the keepalive interval interface subcommand.
Those comments aside, as long as an interface status is up and up, the router believes that the 
interface is usable, so the router can add the associated connected IP route to the routing table.

Conﬁguring IP Addresses     379
In some cases, you want an interface to be down for administrative reasons, but you do not 
want to have to unconﬁgure it or pull out the cable to keep the interface from being up and 
up. To bring down an interface for administrative reasons and, as a side effect, remove the 
connected route from the routing table, you can use the shutdown interface subcommand, as 
shown in Example 13-6.
In the example, after the shutdown command under interface serial 1, the route connected 
to serial 1 (10.1.129.0, mask 255.255.255.0) was removed from the routing table, leaving 
only two entries. Also, the output of the show ip interfaces brief command lists a status of 
administratively down and down. (The show ip interfaces and show interfaces commands 
would show the same status for serial 1.) At the end of the example, the no shutdown 
command brings the interface back up.

Bandwidth, Clock Rate, and Serial Lines in the Lab
As mentioned back in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of WANs,” you can build a WAN link in a 
lab without using a CSU/DSU. The lab network that I used to build the examples in this 
chapter used three “back-to-back” serial cables, essentially a DTE and DCE cable pair 
connected together.
To use a back-to-back WAN connection, one router must supply the clocking. Example 13-7 
shows an example conﬁguration for Seville, with a couple of important commands related to 
WAN links.
The clock rate command sets the rate in bits per second on the router that has the DCE cable 
plugged into it. In this case, Seville was supplying clocking on both serial interfaces. If no 
cable has been plugged in, the IOS accepts the command. If a DTE cable has been plugged 
in, IOS rejects the command. If you do not know which router has the DCE cable in it, you 
can ﬁnd out by using the show controllers command, as shown at the end of the example. In 
the example, you can see that the output identiﬁes the type of serial cable.  
Also notice the bandwidth 128 command on serial 1. The bandwidth command tells IOS the 
speed of the link, in kilobits per second, regardless of whether the router is supplying

clocking. The bandwidth setting does not change anything that the router does at Layer 1; 
instead, this setting is used by IOS software for other purposes. For instance, IGRP and 
EIGRP both use bandwidth to calculate a metric for routing protocols; they use the 
bandwidth setting on the interfaces. bandwidth defaults to T1 speed on serial interfaces. 
There is no default for clock rate, even with a DCE cable plugged in—it must be conﬁgured.
IP Troubleshooting Features
Cisco includes coverage of basic troubleshooting commands and concepts on the CCNA 
exams. These commands are contained in several places in this book, as well as in the CCNA 
ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. This section covers some of the tools and commands 
speciﬁc to troubleshooting IP. 
Internet Control Message Protocol
Earlier in this chapter, you read about how to conﬁgure IP addresses and how to perform 
some basic troubleshooting. For troubleshooting, you have seen how to look at the routing 
table with the show ip route command, how to look at interface status with several options 
on the show interfaces command, and how to use standard and extended ping commands for 
basic troubleshooting.
TCP/IP includes a protocol speciﬁcally to help manage and control the operation of a 
TCP/IP network, called the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The ICMP protocol 
provides a wide variety of information about the health and operational status of a network. 
Control Message is the most descriptive part of the name—ICMP deﬁnes messages that helps 
control and manage the work of IP and, therefore, is considered to be part of TCP/IP’s 
network layer. Because ICMP helps control IP, it can provide useful troubleshooting 
information. In fact, the ICMP messages sit inside an IP packet, with no transport layer 
header at all–so it is truly just an extension of the TCP/IP network layer.
RFC 792 deﬁnes ICMP and includes the following excerpt, which describes the protocol well:
Occasionally a gateway (router) or destination host will communicate with a source 
host, for example, to report an error in datagram processing. For such purposes, 
this protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), is used. ICMP uses 
the basic support of IP as if it were a higher level protocol; however, ICMP is 
actually an integral part of IP and must be implemented by every IP module.
ICMP uses messages to accomplish its tasks. Many of these messages are used in even the 
smallest IP network. Table  13-4 lists several ICMP messages. 

382     Chapter 13: Basic Router Configuration and Operation
ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply
The ICMP echo request and echo reply messages are sent and received by the ping command. 
In fact, when people say that they “sent a ping packet,” they really mean that they sent an 
ICMP echo request. These two messages are very self-explanatory. The echo request simply 
means that the host to which it is addressed should reply to the packet. The echo reply is the 
ICMP message type that should be used in the reply. The echo request includes some data 
that can be speciﬁed by the ping command; whatever data is sent in the echo request is sent 
back in the echo reply.
Example 13-8 shows two ping commands testing IP connectivity from Albuquerque to 
Yosemite. Figure 13-2 precedes the example, as a reminder of the topology and IP addresses 
in the network.
Table 13-4
ICMP Message Types
Message
Purpose
Destination unreachable 
This tells the source host that there is a problem delivering a 
packet.
Time exceeded
The time that it takes a packet to be delivered has expired; the 
packet has been discarded.
Redirect
The router sending this message has received some packet for 
which another router would have had a better route; the message 
tells the sender to use the better route.
Echo
This is used by the ping command to verify connectivity.

The ping command sends a packet to the stated destination address. The TCP/IP software at 
the destination then replies to the ping packet with a similar packet. The ping command 
sends the ﬁrst packet and waits on the response. If a response is received, the command 
displays an exclamation mark (!). If no response is received within the default timeout of 2 
seconds, the ping command displays a period (.). The IOS ping command sends ﬁve of these 
packets by default.
In Example 13-8, the ping 10.1.128.2 command works, but the ping 10.1.2.252 command 
does not. The ﬁrst ping command works because Albuquerque has a route to the subnet in 
which 10.1.128.2 resides (subnet 10.1.128.0). However, the second ping to 10.1.2.252 does 
not work because the subnet in which 10.1.2.252 resides, subnet 10.1.2.0, is not connected 
to Albuquerque, so Albuquerque does not have a route to that subnet. So, none of the ﬁve 
ping packets works, resulting in ﬁve periods in the output of the ping command. (The ping 
would have worked if a routing protocol had been implemented successfully in this 
network.) Had these routers been using a routing protocol, the correct routes would have 
been known, and the second ping would have worked.
The ping command itself supplies many creative ways to use echo requests and replies. For 
instance, the ping command enables you to specify the length as well as the source and 
destination addresses, and it also enables you to set other ﬁelds in the IP header.

 Destination Unreachable ICMP Message
The ICMP Destination Unreachable message is sent when a message cannot be delivered 
completely to the application at the destination host. Because packet delivery can fail for 
many reasons, there are ﬁve separate unreachable functions (codes) using this single ICMP 
unreachable message. All ﬁve code types pertain directly to an IP, TCP, or UDP feature. The 
network shown in Figure 13-3 helps you understand them.
Figure 13-3
Sample Network for Discussing ICMP Unreachable Codes
Assume that Fred is trying to connect to the web server, called Web. (Web uses HTTP, which 
in turn uses TCP as the transport layer protocol.) Three of the ICMP unreachable codes can 
possibly be used by Routers A and B. The other two codes are used by the web server. These 
ICMP codes are sent to Fred as a result of the packet originally sent by Fred.
Table 13-5 summarizes the more common ICMP unreachable codes. After the table, the text 
explains how each ICMP code might be needed for the network in Figure 13-3.

There is no match in a routing table 
for the packet’s destination.

386     Chapter 13: Basic Router Configuration and Operation
The following list explains each code in Table 8-8 in greater detail using the network in 
Figure 13-3 as an example:
■
Network unreachable—Router A uses this code if it does not have a route telling it where 
to forward the packet. In this case, Router A needs a route to subnet 10.1.2.0. Router A 
sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable message with the code “network 
unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
■
Host unreachable—This code implies that the single destination host is unavailable. If 
Router A has a route to 10.1.2.0, the packet is delivered to Router B. However, if the 
web server is down, Router B does not get an ARP reply from the web server. Router B 
sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable message with the code “host 
unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
■
Can’t fragment—This code is the last of the three ICMP unreachable codes that a router 
might send. Fragmentation deﬁnes the process in which a router needs to forward a 
packet, but the outgoing interface allows only packets that are smaller than the 
forwarded packet. The router can break the packet into pieces. However, if Router A or 
B needs to fragment the packet but the Do Not Fragment bit is set in the IP header, the 
router discards the packet. Router A or B sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable 
message with the code “can’t fragment” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 
10.1.2.14.
■
Protocol unreachable—If the packet successfully arrives at the web server, two other 
unreachable codes are possible. One implies that the protocol above IP, typically TCP or 
UDP, is not running on that host. This is highly unlikely, because most operating systems 
that use TCP/IP use a single software package that provides IP, TCP, and UDP functions. 
But if the host receives the IP packet and TCP or UDP is unavailable, the web server host 
sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable message with the code “protocol 
unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
Unreachable Code
When It Is Used
What It Typically Is 
Sent By
Protocol unreachable
The packet is delivered to the 
destination host, but the transport 
layer protocol is not available on 
that host.
Endpoint host
Port unreachable
The packet is delivered to the 
destination host, but the 
destination port has not been 
opened by an application.
Endpoint host
Table 13-5
ICMP Unreachable Codes (Continued)

IP Troubleshooting Features     387
■
Port unreachable—The ﬁnal code ﬁeld value is more likely today. If the server is up but 
the web server software is not running, the packet can get to the server but cannot be 
delivered to the web server software. The web server host sends Fred the ICMP 
Destination Unreachable message with the code “port unreachable” in response to Fred’s 
packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
One key to troubleshooting with the ping command is understanding the various codes the 
command uses to signify the various responses it can receive. Table 13-6 lists the various 
codes that the Cisco IOS software ping command can supply.
IP Naming Commands 
When using the IOS CLI, you will want to refer to names instead of IP addresses. Particularly 
for the trace, ping, and telnet commands, the IP address or host name must be supplied. This 
section describes the use of host names on an IOS-based device. Along the way, some nuances 
of the use of Telnet are covered.
IOS can use statically conﬁgured names as well as refer to one or more DNSs. Example 13-9 
shows some names statically conﬁgured, with conﬁguration pointing to two different DNSs.

Router Cooperstown will use any of the three statically conﬁgured host name–to–IP address 
mappings. Three names are conﬁgured statically in this case—Mays, Aaron, and Mantle. 
Any command referring to Mays, Aaron, or Mantle will resolve into the IP addresses shown 
in the ip host command.
Router Cooperstown also will ask a DNS for name resolution if it does not know the name 
and IP address already. The DNS conﬁguration is shown toward the end of the conﬁguration. 
The IP addresses of the name servers are shown in the ip name-server command. Up to six 
DNSs can be listed; they are searched for each request sequentially, based on the order in the 
command. Finally, the ip domain-lookup command enables IOS to ask a name server. IP 
domain lookup is the default; no ip domain-lookup disables the DNS client function. For 
names that do not include the full domain name, the ip domain-name command deﬁnes the 
domain name that should be assumed by the router.
The show ip host command lists the static entries, in addition to any entries learned from a DNS 
request. Only the three static entries were in the table, in this case. The term perm in the output 
implies that the entry is static. Also note that when short names are used—in other words, the 
name does not include the DNS domain name—the router adds the domain name of 
gileadfoundation.org, as conﬁgured in the ip domain-name gileadfoundation.org command.
Table 13-7 summarizes the key naming commands in IOS.

Telnet and Suspend
The telnet IOS exec command enables you to Telnet from one Cisco device to another; in 
practical use, it is typically to another Cisco device. One of the most important features of 
the telnet command is the suspend feature. To understand the suspend function, you should 
to refer to the network diagram in Figure 13-4.
Figure 13-4
Telnet Suspension
In the ﬁgure, the router administrator is using Bench to Telnet into the Cincy router. When 
in Cincy, the user Telnets to Milwaukee. When in Milwaukee, the user suspends the Telnet 
by pressing Ctrl-Shift-6, followed by pressing the letter x. The user then Telnets to New York 
and again suspends the connection. The example begins with Bench already logged into 
Cincy. Example 13-10 shows example output, with annotations to the side.

IP Troubleshooting Features     391
The play-by-play notes in the example explain most of the details. Example 13-10 begins 
with the Cincy command prompt that would be seen in Bench’s Telnet window because the 
user at Bench Telnetted into Cincy ﬁrst. After Telnetting to Milwaukee, the Telnet connection 
was suspended. Then, after Telnetting to New York, that connection was suspended. The two 
connections can be suspended or resumed easily. The resume command can be used to 
resume either connection; however, the resume command requires a connection ID, which is 
shown in the show sessions command. (The where command provides the same output.) 
Also, instead of using the resume command, you can just use the session number as a 
command. For instance, just typing the command 2 does the same thing as typing the 
command resume 2.
The interesting and potentially dangerous nuance here is that if a Telnet session is suspended 
and you simply press Enter, Cisco IOS Software resumes the connection to the most recently 
suspended Telnet connection. That is ﬁne, until you realize how much you tend to press the 
Enter key occasionally to clear some of the clutter from the screen. With a suspended Telnet 
connection, you also just happened to reconnect to another router. This is particularly 
dangerous when you are changing the conﬁguration or using potentially damaging exec 
commands—be careful about what router you are actually using when you have suspended 
Telnet connections.
If you want to know which session has been suspended most recently, look for the session 
listed in the show session command that has an asterisk to the left of the entry. That session 
was the most recently suspended session.

The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) discovers basic information about neighboring routers

supports any LAN, HDLC, Frame Relay, and ATM interface—in fact, it supports any 
interface that supports the use of SNAP headers. The router or switch can discover Layer 2 
and Layer 3 addressing details of neighboring routers without even conﬁguring that Layer 3 
protocol—this is because CDP is not dependent on any particular Layer 3 protocol.
When Cisco ﬁrst developed the proprietary CDP, it was used mainly between routers. Today 
most Cisco products support CDP, including Cisco switches and Cisco IP Phones. 
Devices that support CDP advertise their own information and learn information about 
others by listening for their advertisements. On media that support multicasts at the data link 
layer, CDP uses multicast; on other media, CDP sends a copy of the CDP update to any 
known data-link addresses. So, any CDP-supporting device that shares a physical medium 
with another CDP-supporting device can learn about the other device.

CDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring device:
■
Device identiﬁer—Typically the host name
■
Address list—Network and data-link addresses
■
Port identiﬁer—Text that identiﬁes the port, which is another name for an interface
■
Capabilities list—Information on what type of device it is—for instance, a router or a switch
■
Platform—The model and OS level running in the device
CDP is enabled in the conﬁguration by default. The no cdp run global command 
disables CDP for the entire device, and the cdp run global command re-enables CDP. 
Likewise, the no cdp enable interface subcommand disables CDP just on that interface, and 
the cdp enable command switches back to the default state of CDP being enabled. 
A variety of show cdp command options are available. Example 13-11 lists the output of the 
commands, with some commentary following.

lists the detailed information is the show cdp neighbor detail command, which is in the same 
format as show cdp entry but lists the information for every neighbor. 
You actually can draw a network diagram by using CDP, exercising a little patience, and 
issuing the right commands on all the devices in a network. Whether you are using the briefer 
output of show cdp neighbor or the more complete output of show cdp neighbor detail or 
show cdp entry, the output lists both the local interface and the port ID. The port ID is the 
interface number, as designated by the other device. For instance, the switch uses port 0/4 to 
connect to this device. So, you literally could piece together the network diagram from the 
CDP output. 

Foundation Summary     397
Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” before going to take the exam.
The ip address interface subcommand assigns an IP address and mask to an interface. If the 
associated interface is also in an up and up status, the router adds a connected route to the 
routing table for the subnet connected to that interface. Example 13-12 shows an example 
conﬁguration with the resulting connected routes.

Q&A
As mentioned in the introduction, you have two choices for review questions. The questions 
that follow give you a bigger challenge than the exam itself by using an open-ended question 
format. By reviewing now with this more difﬁcult question format, you can exercise your 
memory better and prove your conceptual and factual knowledge of this chapter. The 
answers to these questions are found in Appendix A.
For more practice with exam-like question formats, including questions using a router 
simulator and multiple-choice questions, use the exam engine on the CD.
1.
Create a minimal conﬁguration enabling IP on each interface on a 2501 router (two 
serial, one Ethernet). The NIC assigned you network 8.0.0.0. Your boss says that you 
need, at most, 200 hosts per subnet. You decide against using VLSM. Your boss also says 
to plan your subnets so that you can have as many subnets as possible rather than allow 
for larger subnets later. When choosing the actual IP address values and subnet numbers, 
you decide to start with the lowest numerical values. Assume that point-to-point serial 
links will be attached to this router.
2.
In the previous question, what would be the IP subnet of the link attached to serial 0? If 
another user wanted to answer the same question but did not have the enable password, 
what command(s) might provide this router’s addresses and subnets?
3.
What must be done to make the output of the show ip route command list subnet masks 
in decimal format instead of preﬁxes? In what mode would you use the command?
4.
What are the differences between the clock rate and bandwidth commands?
5.
Compare and contrast the commands used to set the enable, console, and telnet 
passwords on a router.
6.
In the output of show ip route, when a C shows up in the left side of the output on a line 
for a particular route, what does that mean?
7.
Deﬁne the term preﬁx notation. Give two examples.
8.
What does ICMP stand for? To which OSI layer would you consider this protocol to 
apply most closely?
9.
Identify two methods to tell a router to ask for name resolution from two different name 
servers. 
10.
What keyboard sequence suspends a Telnet session in a Cisco router? 

Q&A     401
11.
What two commands, and what part the command output, tells you which suspended 
Telnet connection will be reconnected if you just press the Enter key, without any 
characters typed on the command line? 
12.
Imagine that you typed a ping command and got 5 “!” back. What type of messages were 
sent through the network? Be as speciﬁc as possible. 
13.
How do you make a router not ask for DNS resolution from a name server? 
14.
Imagine that you are just logged in at the console of R1, and you Telnet to routers R2, 
R3, and R4 in succession, but you suspended your Telnet connection each time—in other 
words, all three Telnet connections go from R1 to the other three routers, respectively. 
What options do you have for reconnecting to R2? 
15.
Imagine that you are just logged in at the console of R1, and you Telnet to routers R2, 
R3, and R4 in succession, but you suspended your Telnet connection each time—in other 
words, all three Telnet connections go from R1 to the other three routers, respectively. 
What options do you have for reconnecting to R4? 
16.
List the ﬁve key pieces of information that can be gathered using CDP, as mentioned in 
the chapter. 
17.
Imagine a network with Switch1, connected to Router1, with a point-to-point serial link 
to Router2, which, in turn, is connected to Switch2. Assuming that you are logged into 
R1, what commands could be used to ﬁnd the IP addresses of Router2 and Switch1 
without logging in to either device? 
18.
Imagine that a network with Switch1 is connected to Router1, with a point-to-
point serial link to Router2, which, in turn, is connected to Switch2. You can log in only 
to Switch1. Which of the other devices could Switch1 learn about using CDP? Why? 
19.
What command lists a brief one-line description of CDP information about each 
neighbor?

Introduction to Dynamic 
Routing Protocols 
The United States Postal Service routes a huge number of letters and packages each day. 
To do so, the postal sorting machines run fast, sorting lots of letters. Then the letters are 
placed in the correct container and onto the correct truck or plane to reach the ﬁnal 
destination. However, if no one programs the letter-sorting machines to know where 
letters to each ZIP code should be sent, the sorter can’t do its job. Similarly, Cisco routers 
can route many packets, but if the router doesn’t know any routes, it can’t do its job.
This chapter introduces the basic concepts behind IP routing protocols and lists some of 
the key features of each of the IP routing protocols covered on the INTRO exam. Cisco 
expects CCNAs to demonstrate a comfortable understanding of the logic behind the 
routing of packets and the different but related logic behind routing protocols—the 
protocols used to discover routes. To fully appreciate the nuances of routing protocols, 
you need a thorough understanding of routing—the process of forwarding packets. You 
might even want to review the section “IP Routing and Routing Protocols,“ in Chapter 5, 
“Fundamentals of IP,“ for a review of routing, before proceeding with this chapter.
For those of you studying for the CCNA exam, if you are following the reading plan 
outlined in the introduction, you will move to the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide after this chapter. For those of you studying just for the INTRO exam, this chapter 
completes the coverage of topics related to IP and IP routing.

Routing Protocol Overview     407
Foundation Topics
To pass the INTRO exam, you need to know some basic information about several IP routing 
protocols. For the ICND exam, you will need to know distance vector concepts, as well as 
how to conﬁgure two distance vector IP routing protocols—the Routing Information 
Protocol (RIP) and the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP). You will also need to 
know the concepts behind Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP), as well as Open Shortest Path First 
(OSPF)—two other IP routing protocols. 
This chapter provides overview of routing protocols and the underlying logic used by these 
protocols. 
Routing Protocol Overview
IP routing protocols have one primary goal—to ﬁll the IP routing table with the current best 
routes it can ﬁnd. The goal is simple, but the process and options can be complicated. 
Terminology can get in the way when you’re learning about routing protocols. This book’s 
terminology relating to routing and routing protocols is consistent with the authorized Cisco 
courses, as well as with most Cisco documentation. So, just to make sure you have the terminology 
straight before diving into the details, a quick review of a few related terms might be helpful:
■
A routing protocol ﬁlls the routing table with routing information. Examples include RIP 
and IGRP.
■
A routed protocol is a protocol with OSI Layer 3 characteristics that deﬁne logical 
addressing and routing. The packets deﬁned by the network layer (Layer 3) portion of 
these protocols can be routed. Examples of routed protocols include IP and IPX.
■
The term routing type has been used in other Cisco courses, so you should also know 
this term. It refers to the type of routing protocol, such as link-state or distance vector.
IP routing protocols ﬁll the IP routing table with valid, (hopefully) loop-free routes. Although 
the primary goal is to build a routing table, each routing protocol has a very important 
secondary goal of preventing loops. The routes added to the routing table include a subnet 
number, the interface out which to forward packets so that they are delivered to that subnet, and 
the IP address of the next router that should receive packets destined for that subnet (if needed). 
An analogy about routing protocols can help. Imagine that a stubborn man is taking a trip 
to somewhere he has never been. He might look for a road sign referring to the destination 
town and pointing him to the next turn. By repeating the process at each intersection, he 
eventually should make it to the correct town. Of course, if a routing loop occurs (in other 
words, he’s lost!) and he stubbornly never asks for directions, he could drive around 
forever—or at least until he runs out of gas. In this analogy, the guy in the car is like a routed 

408     Chapter 14: Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
protocol—it travels through the network from the source to the destination. The routing protocol 
is like the fellow whose job it is to decide what to paint on the various road signs. As long as 
all the road signs have correct information, the guy in the car should make it to the right town 
just by reading the road signs. Likewise, as long as the routing protocol puts the right routes in 
the various routing tables, the routers should deliver packets successfully.
All routing protocols have several general goals, as summarized in the following list: 
■
To dynamically learn and ﬁll the routing table with a route to all subnets in the network.
■
If more than one route to a subnet is available, to place the best route in the routing table.
■
To notice when routes in the table are no longer valid, and to remove those routes from 
the routing table.
■
If a route is removed from the routing table and another route through another 
neighboring router is available, to add the route to the routing table. (Many people view 
this goal and the preceding one as a single goal.)
■
To add new routes, or to replace lost routes with the best currently available route, as 
quickly as possible. The time between losing the route and ﬁnding a working 
replacement route is called convergence time.
■
To prevent routing loops.
So, all routing protocols have the same general goals. Cisco IOS Software supports a large 
variety of IP routing protocols. IP’s long history and continued popularity have resulted in 
the speciﬁcation and creation of several different competing routing protocol options. So, 
classifying IP routing protocols based on their differences is useful.
Comparing and Contrasting IP Routing Protocols
Routing protocols can be categorized in several ways. One distinction is whether the 
protocol is more useful between two companies or inside a single company. Only one IP 
routing protocol that is popular today, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is designed 
speciﬁcally for use between two different organizations. In fact, BGP distributes routing 
information between ISPs worldwide today and between ISPs and their customers as need be.
Routing protocols that are best used to distribute routes between companies and 
organizations, such as BGP, are called exterior routing protocols. Routing protocols designed 
to distribute routing information inside a single organization are called interior routing 
protocols. The comparison is like the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) versus the 
local government’s transportation department. The U.S. DOT plans the large interstate 
highways, but it could care less that someone just sold a farm to a developer and the local 
government has given the developer the approval to pave a new street so that he can build 
some houses. The U.S. DOT could be compared to exterior routing protocols—they care 
about overall worldwide connectivity, but they could care less when a single company adds 

Routing Protocol Overview     409
a new LAN and a new subnet. However, the interior routing protocols do care, so when the 
packet gets to the company, all the routers will have learned about any new subnets, and the 
packet can be delivered successfully.
This section focuses on how to compare the interior IP routing protocols because there are 
several on the INTRO exam and there are many points of comparison. Table 14-2 lists some 
of the major comparison points.
Table 14-2
Major Comparison Points Between Interior Routing Protocols
Point of Comparison
Description
Type of routing 
protocol
Each interior routing protocol covered in this chapter can be characterized 
based on the underlying logic used by the routing protocol. This 
underlying logic often is referred to as the type of routing protocol. The 
three types are distance vector, link-state, and hybrid. 
Full/partial updates
Some interior routing protocols send their entire routing tables regularly, 
which are called full routing updates. Other routing protocols send only a 
subset of the routing table in updates, typically just the information about 
any changed routes. This subset is referred to as partial routing updates. 
Partial routing updates require less overhead in the network.
Convergence
Convergence refers to the time required for routers to react to changes 
(for example, link failures and router failures) in the network, 
removing bad routes and adding new, better routes so that the current 
best routes are in all the routers’ routing tables.
Metric
The metric refers to the numeric value that describes how good a 
particular route is. The lower the value is, the better the route is. Some 
metrics provide a more realistic perspective on which routes are truly 
the best routes.
Support for VLSM
Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) means that, in a single Class 
A, B, or C network, multiple subnet masks can be used. The advantage 
of VLSM is that it enables you to vary the size of each subnet, based on 
the needs of that subnet. For instance, a point-to-point serial link needs 
only two IP addresses, so a subnet mask of 255.255.255.252, which 
allows only two valid IP addresses, meets the requirements but does 
not waste IP addresses. A mask allowing a much larger number of IP 
addresses then can be used on each LAN-based subnet. Some routing 
protocols support VLSM, and some do not.
Classless or classful
Classless routing protocols transmit the subnet mask along with each 
route in the routing updates sent by that protocol. Classful routing 
protocols do not transmit mask information. So, only classful routing 
protocols support VLSM. To say that a routing protocol is classless is 
to say that it supports VLSM, and vice versa.

410     Chapter 14: Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
The next few sections take you through the basics of each of the types of interior routing 
protocols, as well as give you a short description of each routing protocol.
Routing Through the Internet with the Border Gateway Protocol
ISPs use BGP today to exchange routing information between themselves and other ISPs and 
customers. Whereas interior routing protocols might be concerned about advertising all 
subnets inside a single organization, with a large network having a few thousand routes in 
the IP routing table, exterior routing protocols try to make sure that advertising routes reach 
every organization’s network. Exterior routing protocols also deal with routing tables that, 
with a lot of work done to keep the size down, still exceed 100,000 routes.
BGP advertises only routing information to speciﬁcally deﬁned peers using TCP. By using TCP, a 
router knows that any routing updates will be re-sent if they happen to get lost in transit. 
BGP uses a concept called autonomous systems when describing each route. An autonomous 
system (AS) is a group of devices under the control of a single organization—in other words, 
that organization has autonomy from the other interconnected parts of the Internet. An AS 
number (ASN) is assigned to each AS, uniquely identifying each AS in the Internet. BGP includes 
the ASNs in the routing updates to prevent loops. Figure 14-1 shows the general idea.

Routing Protocol Overview     411
Notice that in the ﬁgure, the BGP updates sent to each successive AS show the ASNs in the 
route. When R1 receives the BGP update from R4, it notices that its own ASN in found inside 
the AS path and ignores that particular route.
BGP does not use a metric like internal routing protocols. Because BGP expects to be used 
between different ISPs and between ISPs and customers, BGP allows for a very robust set of 
alternatives for deciding what route to use; these alternatives are called policies. Routing 
policy can be based on the fact that an ISP might have a better business relationship with a 
particular ISP. For instance, in Figure 14-1, packets from Enterprise B toward Enterprise A 
can take the “high” route (from ASN 3, to ASN 2, and then to ASN 1) if ISP3 has a better 
business relationship with ISP2, as compared with ISP4.
In the next section, you will learn about interior routing protocols and how they use some 
more obvious metrics.
Distance Vector Protocols: RIP and IGRP
Distance vector protocols advertise routing information by sending messages, called routing 
updates, out the interfaces on a router. These updates contain a series of entries, with each 
entry representing a subnet and a metric. The metric represents how good the route is from 
that router’s perspective, with a smaller number being a better route.
Any routers that receive a copy of a distance vector routing update receive that information 
and possibly add some routes to their routing table. The receiving router adds the routes only if 
the routing update described a route to a subnet that it did not already know about or if it 
described a route that already was known, but the newly learned route has a better (lower) 
metric.
Figure 14-2 depicts the basic process.

412     Chapter 14: Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
Note that Router A advertises the route to its LAN subnet to Router B. The update includes 
only the subnet number and a metric. Router B then adds a route to its routing table, but the 
route has more information in it than did the routing update itself. When B received the 
update, it came in interface Serial0, so Router B considers Serial0 to be the correct outgoing 
interface. The update came from IP address 10.1.2.1, so Router B considers that IP address 
to be the next-hop IP address. Also, if the distance vector update does not include the subnet 
mask, as in the ﬁgure, Router B assumes that Router A uses the same mask that it does. As 
it turns out, these routers would not support VLSM because if Router A used a different 
subnet mask than Router B, B would make a wrong assumption about the mask. The fact 
that the routing protocol in this example does not transmit mask information also makes it 
a classful routing protocol. For these examples, assume that all routers are using the same 
subnet mask in this network—speciﬁcally, 255.255.255.0.
If it seems simple, then you understand it well—distance vector protocols ﬁrst were created 
about 20 years ago, when the processor in a routing device was probably less powerful than 
the processor in your cell phone today. It had to be simple so as not to overburden the router’s 
processor, and also not to overload the network with overhead trafﬁc.
The following list formalizes the basic distance vector logic and introduces a few important 
concepts that are explained over the next several pages:
■
Routers add directly connected subnets to their routing tables, even without a routing 
protocol.
■
Routers send routing updates out their interfaces to advertise the routes that this router 
already knows. These routes include directly connected routes as well as routes learned 
from other routers.
■
Routers listen for routing updates from their neighbors so that they can learn new routes.
■
The routing information includes the subnet number and a metric. The metric deﬁnes 
how good the route is; lower metric routes are considered better routes.
■
When possible, routers use broadcasts or multicasts to send routing updates. By using a 
broadcast or multicast packet, all neighbors on a LAN can receive the same routing 
information in a single update. 
■
If a router learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the router chooses the best route 
based on the metric. (If the metrics tie, there are a variety of options, which are described 
in Chapter 6, “OSPF and EIGRP Concepts and Conﬁguration,” of the CCNA ICND 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.) 
■
Routers send periodic full updates and expect to receive periodic updates from 
neighboring routers. 
■
Failure to receive updates from a neighbor in a timely manner results in the removal of 
the routes previously learned from that neighbor.
■
A router assumes that, for a route advertised by Router X, the next-hop router in that 
route is Router X.

Routing Protocol Overview     413
Routing Information Protocol Version 1
RIP Version 1 (RIP-1) has been around for a long time—longer than 15 years for use with IP 
networks. It has many shortcomings compared to some of the relatively newer IP routing 
protocols, but it does work and is an easy tool to use for comparison with the other routing 
protocols.
RIP uses hop count for a metric. That means that, from an individual router’s perspective, if 
there are two routers between itself and a subnet, its metric for that subnet is 2. Figure 14-3 
outlines the concept.
Figure 14-3
RIP’s Use of Hop Count as Metric
Only a part of the routing table for each router is shown in the ﬁgure, but from those shown, 
you can see what is meant by the hop count. Router B’s metrics for its locally attached 
subnets are both 0 because there are no routers between B and those subnets. Similarly, 
Router A’s metric for 162.11.8.0 is 0. Because Router B separates Router A from subnet 
162.11.7.0, Router A’s metric for subnet 162.11.7.0 is 1. Finally, Router C’s metric for 
subnet 162.11.7.0 is 2 because two routers separate it from that subnet.
You will learn much more about RIP and the underlying distance vector logic used by RIP as 
you prepare for the ICND exam. For now, this short list of RIP-1 features can help you 
compare RIP-1 to some of the other IP routing protocols covered in this overview:

Based on distance vector Logic

Uses hop count for the metric

RIP Version 2
RIP Version 2 (RIP-2), as currently deﬁned in RFC 2453, deﬁnes several enhancements to the 
original RIP protocol. RIP-2 uses distance vector logic; uses hop count for the metric; sends 
full, periodic updates; and still converges relatively slowly. 
RIP-2 does add support for VLSM, as compared with RIP-1, making it a classless routing 
protocol, with RIP-2 including the subnet mask for each subnet in the routing updates. Table 14-3 
outlines the improvements made to RIP with the creation of RIP-2.
The most important feature comparing the two is that RIP-2 supports VLSM. Today, when 
choosing a routing protocol, RIP-1 would not be the best choice—in fact, the RIP-1 RFC has 
been designated for historic status. Both protocols work well, but RIP-2 is more functional. 
If you want a routing protocol that uses a public standard and you want to avoid the 
complexity of link-state protocols, RIP-2 is your best choice.
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
IGRP is a Cisco-proprietary IP routing protocol created by Cisco more than 10 years ago. 
Cisco created IGRP to provide a better distance vector protocol to its customers, as 
compared with RIP-1.
Table 14-3
Improvements Made to RIP by RIP V2
Feature
Description
Transmits subnet mask with 
route
This feature allows VLSM by passing the mask along with 
each route so that the subnet is deﬁned exactly. It allows 
VLSM, making RIP-2 a classless routing protocol.
Provides authentication
Both clear text (RFC-deﬁned) and MD5 encryption (Cisco-
added feature) can be used to authenticate the source of a 
routing update.
Includes a next-hop router IP 
address in its routing update
A router can advertise a route but direct any listeners to a 
different router on that same subnet. 
Uses external route tags
RIP can pass information about routes learned from an 
external source and redistributed into RIP. Another router 
then can pass these external tags to that same routing 
protocol in a difference part of the network, effectively 
helping that other routing protocol pass information.
Uses multicast routing 
updates
Instead of broadcasting updates to 255.255.255.255 like 
RIP-1, the destination IP address is 224.0.0.9, an IP multicast 
address. 224.0.0.9 is reserved speciﬁcally for use by RIP-2. 
This reduces the amount of processing required on non–RIP-
speaking hosts on a common subnet.

Routing Protocol Overview     415
The most obvious difference between RIP-1 and IGRP is the metric. IGRP advertises up to 
ﬁve parameters that describe the metric for each route, although, practically, only two ever 
are used—bandwidth and delay. The bandwidth part of this more complex metric describes 
the constrained link speed. For instance, if a route to a subnet contained all Fast Ethernet 
links, the bandwidth in the update would be 100 Mbps; however, if a single 56-kbps link 
were in the path, the bandwidth would be listed as 56 kbps. The delay component includes a 
cumulative number—for instance, a route going over ten Fast Ethernet links would have its delay 
part of the metric ten times bigger than a route with a single 100-Mbps link in the path.
IGRP calculates the metric based on a mathematical formula that you do not really need to 
know for the exam. The formula uses bandwidth and delay as input and results in an integer 
value, the metric, between 1 and 4,294,967,295.
Figure 14-4 shows the beneﬁt of this better metric.
Figure 14-4

choose the two-hop route through Router C when using IGRP because the bandwidths of the 
two links in the route are much higher than that of the single-hop route. In the top trio of 
routers, the engineer let the bandwidth command default to 1544 on each link because RIP 
does not consider the bandwidth. On the bottom trio, the engineer correctly conﬁgured 
bandwidth to match the actual link speeds, thereby allowing IGRP to choose the faster route. 
(The bandwidth interface subcommand does not change the actual physical speed of the 
interface–it just tells the IOS what speed to assume the interface is using.)
IGRP and RIP-1 were the main options for routing protocols back in the early 1990s. RIP-2 
came later, but only after two better alternatives, OSPF and EIGRP, had become better 
options for most networks. Table 14-4 summarizes some of the key comparison points 
between these three protocols.
Link-State Protocols: OSPF and Integrated IS-IS
Link-state and distance vectors share a common goal—to ﬁll the routing tables with the 
current best routes. They differ signiﬁcantly in how they each accomplish the task. The 
largest difference between the two is that distance vector protocols advertise sparse 
information; in fact, distance vector protocols know only that other routers exist if the other 
router broadcasts a routing update to them. When a distance vector protocol in a router 
hears a routing update, the update says nothing about the routers beyond that neighboring 
router that sent the update. Conversely, link-state protocols advertise a large amount of 
topological information about the network, and the routers perform some CPU-intensive 
computation on the topological data. They even discover their neighbors before bothering to 
exchange routing information. 
To ﬁgure out the current best routes, a router processes the link-state topology database 
using an algorithm called the Dijkstra Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm.  This detailed 
topology information, along with the Dijkstra algorithm, helps link-state protocols avoid 
loops and converge quickly.

Routing Protocol Overview     417
Link-state protocols prevent loops from occurring easily because each router essentially has 
a complete map of the network. If you take a trip in your car and you have a map, you are 
a lot less likely to get lost than someone else who is just reading the signs by the side of the 
road. Likewise, the detailed topological information helps link-state protocols easily avoid 
loops. As you will read later, the main reasons that distance vector protocols converge slowly are 
related to the loop-avoidance features. With link-state protocols, those same loop-avoidance 
features are not needed, allowing for fast convergence—often in less than 10 seconds.
Open Shortest Path First
OSPF is the most popular link-state IP routing protocol today and is likely to be the most 
popular one for some time. It works well, is widely deployed, and includes a wide variety of 
features that have been added over the years to accommodate new requirements. 
The basic operation of OSPF differs from that of the distance vector protocols. For the ICND 
exam, you will need to know a few more details, of course, but for now, a brief look at how 
OSPF works will help you compare it with distance vector protocols. 
One difference relates to how and when OSPF actually sends routing information. A router 
does not send routing information with OSPF until it discovers other OSPF-speaking routers 
on a common subnet. The following list gives you some idea of the process:
1.
Each router discovers its neighbors on each interface. The list of neighbors is kept in a 
neighbor table.
2.
Each router uses a reliable protocol to exchange topology information with its 
neighbors. 
3.
Each router places the learned topology information into its topology database.
4.
Each router runs the SPF algorithm against its own topology database to calculate the 
best routes to each subnet in the database.
5.
Each router places the best route to each subnet into the IP routing table.
Link-state protocols do require more work by the routers, but the work is typically worth 
the effort. A router running a link-state protocol uses more memory and more processing 
cycles than do distance vector protocols. The topology updates require a large number of 
bytes to describe the details of every subnet, every router, and which routers are connected 
to which subnets. However, because OSPF does not send full updates on a regular short 
interval (like RIP), the overall number of bytes sent for routing information is typically 
smaller. Also, OSPF converges much more quickly than do distance vector protocols—and 
fast convergence is one of the most important features of a routing protocol.  

418     Chapter 14: Introduction to Dynamic Routing Protocols
OSPF uses a concept called cost for the metric. Each link is considered to have a cost; a 
route’s cost is the sum of the cost for each link. By default, Cisco derives the cost value for a 
link from the bandwidth, so you can think of the metric as being based on cumulative link 
bandwidth. (IGRP’s metric is based on delay and bandwidth, but it does not treat bandwidth 
as a cumulative value; it considers only the slowest link in a path.)
The following list points out some of the key features of OSPF:
■
Converges very quickly—from the point of recognizing a failure, it often can converge 
in less than 10 seconds.
■
Supports VLSM.
■
Uses short Hello messages on a short regular interval (the Hello interval), with 
the absence of Hello messages indicating that a neighbor is no longer reachable.
■
Sends partial updates when link status changes, and ﬂoods full updates every 30 minutes. 
The ﬂooding, however, does not happen all at once, so the overhead is minimal.
■
Uses cost for the metric. 
Integrated IS-IS
Once upon a time, the world of networking consisted of proprietary networking protocols 
from the various computer vendors. For companies that bought computers from only that 
one vendor, there was no problem. However, when you used multiple vendor’s computers, 
networking became more problematic. 
One solution to the problem was the development of a standardized networking protocol, 
such as TCP/IP. Skipping a few dozen years of history, you get to today’s networking 
environment, where a computer vendor couldn’t sell a computer without it also supporting 
TCP/IP. Problem solved!
Well, before TCP/IP became the networking protocol standard solving all these problems, the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) worked hard on a set of protocols that 
together ﬁt into an architecture called Open System Interconnection (OSI). As you recall 
from Chapter 2, “The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models,“ OSI deﬁned its own protocols 
for Layers 3 through 7, relying on other standards for Layers 1 and 2, much like TCP/IP does 
today. OSI did not become commercially viable, whereas TCP/IP did—the victory going to 
the nimbler, more ﬂexible TCP/IP.
So, why bother telling you all this now? Well, OSI deﬁnes a network layer protocol called the 
Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). It also deﬁnes a routing protocol—a routing 
protocol used to advertise CLNP routes, called Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System 
(IS-IS). IS-IS advertises CLNP routes between “intermediate systems,“ which is what OSI 
calls routers. 

Routing Protocol Overview     419
Later in life, IS-IS was updated to include the capability to advertise IP routes as well as 
CLNP routes. To distinguish it from the older IS-IS, this new updated IS-IS is called 
Integrated IS-IS. The word integrated identiﬁes the fact that the routing protocol can 
exchange routing information for multiple Layer 3 routed protocols. 
Integrated IS-IS has an advantage over OSPF because it supports both CLNP and IP route 
advertisement, but most installations could not care less about CLNP. Table 14-5 outlines the 
key comparison points with all Interior routing protocols for both Integrated IS-IS and OSPF.
Balanced Hybrid Protocols: Enhanced IGRP
EIGRP does not use distance vector or link-state logic, but instead it uses a whole new 
category of routing protocol. This new category has some features similar to link-state 
protocols, others similar to distance vector protocols, and yet others unlike either of the two. 
Cisco sometimes categorizes EIGRP as a balanced hybrid protocol, so you should remember 
the term. 
The internal workings of EIGRP depend on an algorithm called the Diffusing Update 
Algorithm (DUAL). DUAL exchanges more topology information than a distance vector 
routing protocol, but it does not transmit full topology information like a link-state protocol. 
Also, the computations used by DUAL require far less processing than the computation-
intensive Dijkstra SPF algorithm. 
DUAL deﬁnes a method for each router not only to calculate the best current route to each 
subnet, but also to calculate alternative routes that could be used if the current route fails. 
An alternative route, using what DUAL calls a feasible successor route, is guaranteed to be 
loop-free. So, if the current best route fails, the router immediately can start using the feasible 
successor route instead so that convergence can happen very quickly.

The following list points out some of the key similarities to some of the other protocols 
covered in this introduction:
■
Like OSPF and Integrated IS-IS, it converges quickly, often in less than 3 seconds after a 
failure is recognized.
■
Like OSPF, EIGRP discovers neighbors before sending them routing information.
■
Like RIP and IGRP, EIGRP requires very little design effort. (Link-state protocols require 
some design work in medium to larger networks).
■
Like IGRP, EIGRP is Cisco proprietary.
■
Like IGRP, EIGRP uses a metric based on bandwidth and delay. EIGRP uses the same 
metric as IGRP, except that EIGRP scales the metric by multiplying by 256. 
■
Like link-state protocols, EIGRP does not send full updates on a periodic interval, but 
rather sends partial updates only as links or routers go up and down.
■
Like link-state protocols, EIGRP builds some topology tables in addition to the IP routing table.
Summary of Interior Routing Protocols
Before ﬁnishing your study for the ICND or CCNA exam, you will learn a lot more about 
RIP-1, IGRP, EIGRP, and OSPF. This chapter has introduced you to some of the key terms

exterior routing protocol, between one of its routers and a router inside 
an ISP.
Interior routing 
protocol
A routing protocol designed for use within a single organization. For 
example, an entire company might choose the IGRP routing protocol, 
which is an interior routing protocol.
Distance vector
The logic behind the behavior of some interior routing protocols, such 
as RIP and IGRP.
Link state
The logic behind the behavior of some interior routing protocols, such 
as OSPF.
Balanced hybrid
The logic behind the behavior of EIGRP, which is more like distance 
vector than link state but is different from these other two types of 
routing protocols.
Dijkstra Shortest 
Path First (SPF) 
algorithm
Magic math used by link-state protocols, such as OSPF, when the 
routing table is calculated.
Diffusing Update 
Algorithm (DUAL)
The process by which EIGRP routers collectively calculate the routes to 
place into the routing tables.
Convergence
The time required for routers to react to changes in the network, 
removing bad routes and adding new, better routes so that the current 
best routes are in all the routers’ routing tables.
Metric
The numeric value that describes how good a particular route is. The 
lower the value is, the better the route is.

Foundation Summary
The “Foundation Summary” section of each chapter lists the most important facts from the 
chapter. Although this section does not list every fact from the chapter that will be on your 
CCNA exam, a well-prepared CCNA candidate should know, at a minimum, all the details 
in each “Foundation Summary” section before going to take the exam.
All routing protocols have several general goals, as summarized in the following list: 
■
To dynamically learn and ﬁll the routing table with a route to all subnets in the network.
■
If more than one route to a subnet is available, to place the best route in the routing table.
■
To notice when routes in the table are no longer valid, and to remove those routes from 
the routing table.
■
If a route is removed from the routing table and another route through another 
neighboring router is available, to add the route to the routing table. (Many people view 
this goal and the preceding one as a single goal.)
■
To add new routes, or to replace lost routes with the best currently available route, as 
quickly as possible. The time between losing the route and ﬁnding a working 
replacement route is called convergence time.
■
To prevent routing loops.
The following list summarizes a few very important terms related to routing and routing 
protocols: 
■
A routing protocol ﬁlls the routing table with routing information. Examples include RIP 
and IGRP.
■
A routed protocol is a protocol with OSI Layer 3 characteristics that deﬁne logical 
addressing and routing. The packets deﬁned by the network layer (Layer 3) portion of 
these protocols can be routed. Examples of protocols include IP and IPX.
■
The term routing type has been used in other Cisco courses, so you also should know 
this term. It refers to the type of routing protocol, such as link-state or distance vector.
Table 14-8 lists some of the major comparison points between interior routing protocols.

Foundation Summary     423
Table 14-8
Major Comparison Points Between Interior Routing Protocols
Point of Comparison
Description
Type of routing 
protocol
Each interior routing protocol covered in this chapter can be 
characterized based on the underlying logic used by the routing 
protocol. This underlying logic often is referred to as the type of 
routing protocol. The three types are distance vector, link state, and 
hybrid. 
Full/partial updates
Some interior routing protocols send their entire routing tables 
regularly, which is called full routing updates. Other routing 
protocols send only a subset of the routing table in updates, 
typically just the information about any changed routes. This is 
called partial routing updates. Partial updates require less overhead 
in the network. 
Convergence
Convergence refers to the time required for routers to react to 
changes (for example, link failures and router failures) in the 
network, removing bad routes and adding new, better routes so that 
the current best routes are in all the routers’ routing tables.
Metric
The numeric value that describes how good a particular route is. 
The lower the value is, the better the route is. Some metrics provide 
a more realistic perspective on which routes are truly the best 
routes.
Support for VLSM
Variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) means that, in a single 
Class A, B, or C network, multiple subnet masks can be used. The 
advantage of VLSM is that it enables you to vary the size of each 
subnet, based on the needs of that subnet. For instance, a point-to-
point serial link needs only two IP addresses, so a subnet mask of 
255.255.255.252, which allows only two valid IP addresses, meets 
the requirements but does not waste IP addresses. A mask allowing 
a much larger number of IP addresses then can be used on each 
LAN-based subnet. Some routing protocols support VLSM, and 
some do not.
Classless or classful
Classless routing protocols transmit the subnet mask along with each 
route in the routing updates sent by that protocol. Classful routing 
protocols do not transmit mask information. So, only classful routing 
protocols support VLSM. To say that a routing protocol is classless is 
to say that it does support VLSM, and vice versa.

Remote Access Technologies
Earlier in this book, you learned about Ethernet LANs, point-to-point WAN links, and 
Frame Relay. All of these technologies can be used to connect a corporate site to the 
Internet. However, none of these options is cost-effective for connecting the typical 
home-based user to the Internet.
In this chapter, you will learn about several different technologies used for Internet access 
from the home. Some of these same technologies can be used to remotely access corporate 
networks as well. This chapter covers the most common remote access technologies—
namely, analog modems, DSL, ISDN, and cable.

Perspectives on the PSTN     435
Foundation Topics
Many companies like the idea of letting workers telecommute, working out of their houses. 
To gain access to applications residing at the corporate site, companies can support various 
types of dynamic access to the corporate network for the home user. For instance, a home-
based worker might use a modem to dial into the corporate site.
At the same time, most corporations today connect to the Internet using a leased WAN 
connection of some kind, typically one or more T1 circuits, or possibly even T3 circuits. If 
their home-based users have access to the Internet, the users could be allowed to access the 
necessary corporate applications and data through their Internet connection. Depending on 
the geography, fees for Internet access, and other factors, allowing access through the 
Internet might be cheaper than providing the capability for users to connect directly into the 
corporate network.
This chapter begins by covering some background information about the Public Switched 
Telephone Network (PSTN). Most remote access technologies use the PSTN for basic 
physical access. The chapter continues with coverage of each of the four types of remote 
access technologies—modems, ISDN, DSL, and cable. 
Perspectives on the PSTN
The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) was built to support trafﬁc between 
telephones—in other words, voice trafﬁc. Three of the four access technologies covered in 
this chapter happen to use the PSTN, so a basic understanding of the PSTN can help you 
appreciate how modems, ISDN, and DSL work. If you already know a fair amount about the 
PSTN, feel free to jump ahead to the section titled “Analog Modems.”
Sound waves travel through the air by vibrating the air. The human ear hears the sound 
because the ear vibrates as a result of the air inside the ear moving, which, in turn, causes the 
brain to process the sounds that were heard by the ear. 
The PSTN, however, cannot forward sound waves. Instead, a telephone includes a 
microphone, which simply converts the sound waves into an analog electrical signal. The 
PSTN can send the electrical signal between one phone and another. On the receiving side, 
the phone converts the electrical signal back to sound waves using a speaker that is inside the 
part of the phone that you put next to your ear. 
The analog electrical signals used to represent sound can be shown on a graph, as in Figure 15-1.

436     Chapter 15: Remote Access Technologies
Figure 15-1
Analog Electrical Signal: Frequency, Amplitude, and Phase
The graph represents the three main components of the signal:
■
Frequency—Frequency is deﬁned as how many times the signal would repeat itself, from 
peak to peak, in 1 second (assuming that the sound didn’t change for a whole second.) 
The ﬁgure shows a frequency of 3 Hertz (Hz). The greater the frequency of the electrical 
signal is, the higher the pitch is of the sound being represented.
■
Amplitude—The amplitude represents how strong the signal is; a higher amplitude peak 
represents a louder sound.
■
Phase—Phase refers to where the signal is at a point in time—at the top, going down, at 
the bottom, going up, and so on. 
The goal of the original PSTN was to create a circuit between any two phones. Each circuit 
consisted of an electrical path between two phones, which, in turn, supported the sending of 
an analog electrical signal in each direction, allowing the people on the circuit to have a 
conversation. Remember, the original PSTN, built by Alexander Graham Bell’s new company, 
predated the ﬁrst vacuum tube computers, so the concept of support data communication 
between computers wasn’t a consideration for the original PSTN. It just wanted to get these 
analog electrical signals, which represented sounds, from one place to the other.
To set up a circuit, when the PSTN ﬁrst got started, you picked up your phone. A ﬂashing 
light at a switchboard at the local phone company ofﬁce told the operator to pick up the 
phone, and then you told the operator who you wanted to talk to. If it was a local call, the 
operator completed the circuit literally by patching the cable at the end of the phone line 
connected to your house to the end of the phone line connected to the house of the person 
you were calling. Figure 15-2 depicts the basic concept.

Figure 15-2
Human Operator Setting Up a Circuit at a Switchboard
In the ﬁgure, Sarah, the operator, picks up the phone when she sees a light ﬂashing telling her 
that someone at Andy’s house has picked up the phone. Andy might say something like, 
“Sarah, I want to talk to Barney.” Because Andy, Sarah, and Barney probably all knew each 
other, that was enough. In a larger town, Andy might simply say, “Please ring phone number 
555-1212,” and Sarah would connect the call. In fact, patching the call on the switchboard 
is where we got the old American saying “patch me through.”
Over the years, the signaling to set up a circuit got more sophisticated. Phones evolved to 
have a rotary dial on them, so you could just pick up the phone and dial the number you 
wanted to call. Later, 12-digit keypads replaced the dial so that you could simply press the 
numbers. For those of you who do not remember phones with dials on them, it would have 
taken you 20 seconds to dial a number that had lots of 8s, 9s, and 0s in them, so a keypad 
was a big timesaver! 
The PSTN also evolved to use digital signals instead of analog signals inside the core of the 
PSTN. By using digital signals instead of analog, the PSTN could send more voice calls over 
the same physical cables, which, in turn, allowed it to grow while reducing the per-call-
minute cost.
So, what is a digital signal? Digital signals represent binary numbers. Electrically, digital 
signals use a deﬁned set of both positive and negative voltages, which, in turn, represent

either a binary 0 or a binary 1. Encoding schemes deﬁne the rules as to which electrical 
signals mean a binary 0 and which ones mean a binary 1. The simplest encoding scheme 
might be to represent a binary 1 with +5V and a binary 0 with —5V; much more 
sophisticated encoding schemes are used today. Figure 15-3 shows an example of a graph of 
a digital signal over time, using the basic encoding scheme that was just described.
Figure 15-3
Example of a Digital Signal with a Simple Encoding Scheme
The sender of the digital signal simply varies the signal based on the encoding scheme. The 
receiver interprets the incoming signal according to the same encoding scheme, re-creating 
the digits. In the ﬁgure, if the receiver examined the signal at each point with an asterisk, the 
binary code would be 100101011. 
So, if a device wanted to somehow send a set of binary digits to another device and there was 
a digital circuit between the two, it could send the appropriate digital signals over the circuit. 
To achieve a particular bit rate, the sender would make sure that the voltage level was at the 
right level at regular intervals, and the receiver would sample the incoming signal at the same 
rate. For instance, to achieve 28 kbps, the sender would change (as necessary) the voltage 
level every 1/28,000th of a second. The receiver would sample the incoming digital signal 
every 1/28,000th of a second as well.
Converting Analog Voice to Digital Voice
The last step in understanding how the PSTN supports voice across a digital PSTN relates to 
how the PSTN converts the analog electrical signals to digital signals, and vice versa. To see 
the need for the conversion, examine Figure 15-4.

Figure 15-4
Analog Voice Calls Through a Digital PSTN
When Andy calls Barney in Raleigh, the circuit is set up by the telco. (Yes, Barney moved to 
Raleigh since the last example.) And it works! It works because the phone company switch 
in the Central Ofﬁce (CO) in Mayberry performs analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion of 
Andy’s incoming voice. When the switch in Raleigh gets the digital signal, before sending it 
out the analog line to Barney’s house, it reverses the process, converting the digital signal 
back to analog. The analog signal going over the local line to Barney’s house is roughly the 
same analog signal that Andy’s phone sent over his local line.
The original standard for converting analog voice to a digital signal is called pulse-code 
modulation (PCM). PCM deﬁnes that an incoming analog voice signal should be sampled 
8000 times per second by the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. A/D converters that are used 
speciﬁcally for processing voice are called codecs (meaning encoder/decoder). For each 
sample, the codec measures the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the analog signal. PCM 
deﬁnes a table of possible values for frequency/amplitude/phase. The codec ﬁnds the table 
entry that most closely matches the measured values. Along with each entry is an 8-bit binary 
code, which tells the codec what bits to use to represent that single sample. So PCM, 
sampling at 8000 times per second ﬁnds the best match of frequency/amplitude/phase in the 
table, ﬁnds the matching 8-bit code, and sends those 8 bits as a digital signal.  
The PCM codec converts from digital to analog by reversing the process. The decoding 
process re-creates the analog signal, but not quite exactly. For instance, if the original

frequency was 2139.3, the decoded frequency might be 2140. For normal speech, the quality 
is great. If you were trying to listen to DVD-quality sounds over the telephone, it probably 
wouldn’t sound as good as it would if you were actually there, but it's pretty close.
If you do the math, you will notice that a single voice call requires 64 kbps of bandwidth in 
the digital part of the PSTN. PCM says that you need to sample the analog signal 8000 times 
per second, and each sample needs 8 bits to represent it. A bright fellow at Bell Labs, 
Nyquist, did some research that showed this sampling rate was needed for digitized voice. 
He noticed that the human voice could create sounds between 300 Hz and 3300 Hz, and that 
the sampling rate needed to be twice that of the highest frequency. So, to overcome some 
other physics problems, Nyquist and the team at Bell Labs decided to round that range of 
frequencies for the human voice to 0 Hz to 4000 Hz. So, because Nyquist’s theorem states 
that you need twice the number of samples as the highest frequency, you need 8000 samples. 
To make sure the voice sounded good after being decoded, they decided to use 256 different 
binary values, each representing a different combination of amplitude, frequency, and phase. 
To represent the 256 values, they needed 8 bits; for 8000 samples per second,  64 kbps is 
needed for a PCM-encoded voice call.
Because a single call needs 64 kbps, the digital PSTN ﬁrst was built on a basic transmission 
speed of 64 kbps. A single 64-kbps channel was dubbed a Digital Signal Level 0—or DS0. In 
the United States, the phone company (American Telephone and Telegraph [AT&T] by that 
point in its history) decided to create hardware that could multiplex 24 DS0s onto a single 
line, so it called that type of line a Digital Signal Level 1—or DS1. The more popular name 
for a DS1 today, of course, is T1. Some parts of the world followed AT&T’s lead for DS1 
with 24 DS0 channels, and other parts of the world, mainly Europe and Australia, chose 
instead to combine 32 different 64-kbps DS0 channels onto a single line, which is the basis 
for today’s E1s. As you might imagine, even faster digital facilities are deﬁned as well, such 
as a T3-line, which has 28 T1s in it. 
Finally, this small history lesson comes to an end. Most of the work on modems and ISDN, 
and some of the work for DSL, occurred with the expectation that these technologies needed 
to work over the PSTN. 
In summary:
■
The telco switch in the CO expects to send and receive analog voice over the physical 
line to a typical home (the local loop).
■
The telco converts the received analog voice to the digital equivalent using a codec.
■
The telco converts the digital voice back to the analog equivalent for transmission over 
the local loop at the destination.
■
The voice call, with PCM in use, uses 64 kbps through the digital part of the PSTN.

Analog Modems     441
Analog Modems
Analog modems allow two computers to send and receive a serial stream of bits, with no 
physical changes required on the typical analog local loop between a residence and the telco 
CO. Because the switch in the CO expects to send and receive analog voice signals over the 
local loop, modems simply send an analog signal to the PSTN and expect to receive an analog 
signal from the PSTN. However, that analog signal represents some bits that the computer 
needs to send to another computer, instead of voice created by a human speaker. Similar in 
concept to a phone converting sound waves into an analog electrical signal, a modem 
converts a string of binary digits on a computer into a representative analog electrical signal.
Modems encode a binary 0 or 1 onto the analog signal by varying the frequency, amplitude, 
or phase. Changing the analog signal is referred to as modulation. For instance, one of the 
earliest standards called for a modem to send an analog signal of 2250 Hz for a binary 1, 
and 2100 Hz for binary 0. A modem would modulate, or change, between the two frequency 
levels to imply a binary 1 or 0. 
To achieve a particular bit rate, the sending modem would modulate the signal at that rate. 
For instance, to send 9600 bps, the sending modem would change the signal (as necessary) 
every 1/9600th of a second. Similarly, the receiving modem would sample the incoming 
analog signal every 1/9600th of a second, interpreting the signal as a binary 1 or 0. (The 
process of the receiving end is called demodulation. The term modem is a shortened version 
of the combination of the two words modulation and demodulation.)  
Modems must work over the existing PSTN. Figure 15-5 outlines the basic process.

First, a circuit (call) must be established. One modem signals the phone number for the call 
in the same way that a telephone does today, by sending the tones associated with the keys 
on a telephone keypad. The CO switch interprets these tones, called dual-tone 
multifrequency (DTMF) tones, just like it would for a voice call. 
When the circuit has been established by the telco, the two modems must agree to what 
modem standard they will use. As long as the two modems use the same rules for how they 
perform modulation and demodulation, the modems can communicate. Many modem 
standards exist, and many modems support several standards. Modems can probe and 
negotiate to ﬁnd the best modem standard that both endpoint modems support. These 
standards are explained brieﬂy and listed later in the chapter.
Note that the PSTN still converts the analog signals to and from PCM using a codec. In 
effect, the data ping-pongs between different states as it passes through the network:
1.
The bits start out stored in digital form on a computer.
2.
The bits are converted to an analog signal by the modem.
3.
The analog signal is converted into a different digital format by a switch in the PSTN, 
using a PCM codec.
4.
The CO switch near the receiving end using a PCM codec to convert back to an analog 
signal.
5.
The receiving modem converts the incoming analog signal to the correct set of bits.
Modems work well and have been around for a long time, so the conversion steps do not 
pose a problem.
Modulation and Demodulation
Most people can fully appreciate the concept of the speed of a dialed circuit in terms of bits 
per second. However, another term, baud, often is used to describe the speed of a modem. In 
fact, some people say things like “That modem runs at 33 kilo baud per second,” really 
meaning 33 kilobits per second (kbps), thinking that “bits per second” and “baud per 
second” are the same thing. But the two terms are not synonymous, as you will read shortly.
Modems create an analog signal when sending data. As mentioned earlier, analog electrical 
signals can be analyzed in terms of frequency, amplitude, and phase. So, modem standards 
deﬁne that particular values for these three parts of the signal imply a 1 or a 0. To appreciate 
what that means, consider the two parts of Figure 15-6.

Analog Modems     443
Figure 15-6
Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase Modulation
The ﬁgure depicts some very simple ways that a modem could be used to create an analog 
signal that can be interpreted by the receiver as a set of binary digits. In Graph A, a low 
amplitude means a binary 0, and a high amplitude means a binary 1. All the sending modem 
has to do is modulate (change) the amplitude of the signal to imply a 1 or a 0. For instance, 
if the modem was running at 28 kbps, then every 1/28,000th of a second, it would make the 
amplitude of the signal low or high, to encode a binary 0 or 1. 
The process of changing, or modulating, the amplitude is called amplitude modulation. 
Modulation, as deﬁned by www.dictionary.com, is “the variation of a property of an 
electromagnetic wave or signal, such as its amplitude, frequency, or phase,” which is exactly 
what amplitude modulation does, speciﬁcally for the amplitude.
Graph B in Figure 15-6 depicts frequency modulation. In this simple example, the higher 
frequency (the part with the curved lines closer together) means 0, and the lower frequency means 
1. Notice that the amplitude stays the same in that case, so this modem standard simply changes 
the frequency to imply a 1 or a 0. So, if the modems are running at 28 kbps, then every 1/28,000th 
of a second, the modem would make the frequency high or low to encode a binary 0 or 1.
Graph C in Figure 15-6 depicts phase modulation. Phase modulation changes the phase of the 
signal—instead of the signal following its normal pattern of rising to the highest positive voltage, 
gradually lowering to the lowest voltage and back again, the signal changes directions—which 
changes the phase. Modems can modulate the phase to imply a binary 0 or 1 as well.
Finally, Graph D in Figure 15-6 shows a combination of frequency modulation and 
amplitude modulation. With this ﬁnal scheme, each signal represents 2 bits. For instance, a

low-amplitude and low-frequency signal might mean 00, whereas a low-amplitude but high-
frequency signal might mean 01. Table 15-2 lists the four combinations possible with this 
example combined modulation scheme.
The modulation scheme in Graph D of Figure 15-6 provides a good context from which to 
understand the term baud. To achieve higher bit rates, modems tend to use modulation 
techniques that encode more than 1 bit in the signal, as in this example. For instance, to 
achieve 28 kbps with this last modulation scheme, the modems would need to change 
(sender) or sample (receiver) the analog signal only every 1/14,000th of a second, because 
each sample represents 2 bits.
The term baud refers to a single encoded energy signal that can represent 1 or more bits. In 
this ﬁnal example, a baud happens to represent 2 bits. Baud is not an acronym; it is taken 
from the name of the inventor (Baudot) of one of the ﬁrst modulation schemes that implied 
more than 1 bit. So, the modem running at 28,000 bps, with a modulation scheme that sends/
receives 2 bits per baud, is running at 14,000 baud per second.
Point-to-Point Protocol Features with Modems
Most computers today use PPP as the data-link protocol when using modems. Modems 
essentially provide an OSI Layer 1 service, supporting the transmission and reception of a 
serial bit stream. In fact, a dialed circuit between two modems creates a physical network 
that has a lot of similarities with a leased point-to-point circuit. Also, analog modems 
typically transmit trafﬁc asynchronously. PPP supports both synchronous communication, as 
typically is done over leased point-to-point lines, as well as asynchronous communication, 
which typically is done over dialed circuits using modems. So, PPP is the logical choice for a 
data-link protocol when using modems today.
PPP includes some features that are important when using modems to dial into an ISP. PPP 
includes the capability of dynamically assigning an IP address to a device on the other end of 
the PPP link. So, when you dial into an ISP, the ISP dynamically assigns an IP address to your 
computer. Also, PPP supports that Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), 
which popularly is used to allow the dial-in user to supply a username and password to gain 
access to the ISP network. (CHAP is covered in the CCNA ICND Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.)

Modem Installation and Cabling
PC modems can be located internally or externally. Internal modems are placed inside the PC 
itself, whereas external modems are external to the PC. Laptops might come with a modem 
built in or simply might use a convenient type of internal modem called a PCMCIA card, or 
simply PC card. PC cards are roughly the size of a credit card and easily can be inserted 
and removed from a PC.
Most PC hardware comes with either a serial communications port, called a COM port, or 
a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. Both USB and COM ports are intended to support external 
devices that communicate using a serial bit stream. So, External modems can be connected 
to a PC using either a COM port or a USB port. Figure 15-7 depicts the typical topology.
Figure 15-7
Modem Installation Options and Concepts
COM ports usually consist of either a female RS-232 connector, which is a D-shell connector 
with 25 pins, or a DB-9 connector, which uses 9 pins. USB ports are rectangular female

connectors about one quarter inch by 1 inch long. In either case, the computer sends a serial 
bit stream to the external modem over the cable, expecting the modem to send the data. At 
the same time, the modem forwards bits received from the phone line back to the PC.
Internal modems do not require the use of an RS-232, DB-9, or USB cable—they simply 
connect directly to the phone line. In the United States, that means using the same type of 
cable that is used to connect to an analog phone, with an RJ-11 connector. However, the 
installation of an internal modem still uses the logical concept of a COM port. That is true 
of internal modems that are installed in an expansion card slot and of PCMCIA modems that 
simply can be inserted into the convenient PC card slot in the side of a laptop computer. The 
operating system in the computer still uses the concept of sending data serially, but instead 
of it physically being sent over a cable to an external modem, it simply goes to the internal 
modem card.
Modem Standards
Modems have been around for more than 30 years, so as you might imagine, a lot of 
standards have evolved. Table 15-3 summarizes some of the modem standards.
*“bis” simply means “version 2.”
Note that for some standards, the speed differs depending on the direction of transmission. 
Most applications today cause a lot more data to be sent toward the client side of the 
connection. For instance, when you sit at a PC and browse a web page, the web server sends

many more bytes to you than you send to it. By using modem standards that use asymmetric 
rates, the maximum rate can be increased for the direction of data that needs the additional 
bandwidth.
V.92, the latest of these standards, has some very interesting features. You can conﬁgure it to 
transfer data at symmetric (48-kbps) rates or asymmetric rates equivalent to V.90’s 56 kbps 
downstream and 33 kbps upstream. It also allows the modem to recognize “call waiting” 
signals from the telco, letting you take or make a call while keeping your modem connection 
up for a short time. Technically, you are not sending data and talking at the same time 
because data transmission is put “on hold,” but it is a very convenient feature.
Analog Modem Summary
Modems have the great advantage of being the most pervasively available remote access 
technology. The history of modems is long, with modems growing to be a very reliable choice 
for remote access. Speeds have improved over the years, with compression technology 
increasing the effective throughput to beyond 100 kbps.
Modems provide a Layer 1 service of delivering a bit stream between the two endpoints on the 
dialed circuit. To pass IP trafﬁc, an appropriate data-link protocol must be used, typically PPP.
The biggest negatives about using modems include their relatively low speed and the fact that 
you cannot use the phone at the same time as you send data.
Integrated Services Digital Network
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) provides switched (dialed) digital WAN services 
in increments of 64 kbps. Before ISDN, the only widely-available method to dial a circuit for 
data communication between two computers was to use analog modems. When ISDN was 
created, analog modem speeds typically did not even exceed 9600 bps. The phone companies 
of the world wanted to have a dialed service that not only allowed faster transmission rates, 
but also was pervasive as a simple analog line used for voice. 
Today one could argue that the collective phone companies of the world were ultimately 
successful with this goal, but not totally successful. ISDN is widely available. It is still a 
popular technology for dial backup between business sites when a point-to-point or Frame 
Relay link fails. ISDN was created more than 20 years ago, and it began being widely 
deployed in the United States by the early 1990s. However, competing technologies, such as 
DSL and cable, have usurped ISDN in the marketplace for home access to ISPs. However, 
ISDN remains a popular choice for dial backup. 

448     Chapter 15: Remote Access Technologies
ISDN requires that the two endpoint computers have the ISDN equivalent of an analog 
modem. There are many variations of these ISDN devices, mainly as a result of the fact that 
ISDN was created as a worldwide standard, so many options were needed to meet the 
differing needs of the telcos in different parts of the world. Figure 15-8 shows the required 
ISDN hardware for a typical connection.
Figure 15-8
ISDN Local Loops and Equipment
Notice that both the home PCs and the router at the ISP use ISDN gear. Routers often use 
ISDN cards that can be connected directly to the ISDN circuit supplied by the telco. PCs 
typically use an ISDN device called an ISDN terminal adapter (TA), which often is called an 
ISDN modem. Because ISDN uses digital signals across the local loop, it does not actually do 
any modulation or demodulation. However, the term ISDN modem emerged because it was 
cabled and installed similarly to an external analog modem. So, for the consumer 
marketplace, the marketing people started calling TAs by the technically wrong but easy-to-
understand term ISDN modem.
Note that the local loop from the home and the CO now connects to a device called an ISDN 
switch. Local phone lines typically connect to a voice switch in the CO. ISDN uses digitial 
signals, so the telco actually must terminate the line from your house in a telco switch that 
expects digitial signals that conform to ISDN speciﬁcations.

ISDN Channels
ISDN includes two types of lines: Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and Primary Rate Interface 
(PRI). Both BRI and PRI provide multiple digital bearer channels (B channels) over which 
data can be sent and received. Because both BRI and PRI have multiple B channels, a single 
BRI or PRI line can have concurrent digital dial circuits to multiple sites. Alternately, you can 
create multiple circuits to the same remote site to increase available bandwidth to that site. 
B channels transport data. They operate at speeds of up to 64 kbps, although the speed might 
be lower, depending on the service provider, or might be based on standards in some parts of 
the world. For instance, some national standards outside the United States call for 56-kbps 
B channels. 
ISDN uses another channel inside the same single physical line to ask the telco to set up and 
tear down circuits. The signaling channel, called the D channel, signals new data calls. When 
a router wants to create a B-channel call to another device using a BRI or PRI, it sends the 
phone number that it wants to connect to inside a message sent across the D channel. The 
phone company’s switch receives the message and sets up the circuit. Signaling a new call 
over the D channel is effectively the same thing as when you pick up the phone and dial a 
number to create a voice call.
The different types of ISDN lines often are descirbed with a phrase that implies the number 
of each type of channel. For instance, BRIs are referred to as 2B+D, meaning two B channels, 
and one D channel. PRIs based on T/1 framing, as in the United States, are referred to as 
23B+D, and PRIs based on E/1 framing, typically found in Europe, are referred to as 30B+D. 
E/1s have 32 DS0 channels, with 1 reserved for framing and 1 used for the D channel when 
used as a PRI—that leaves 30 DS0 channels as B channels. Table 15-4 lists the number of 
channels for each type of ISDN line and the terminology used to describe them.
ISDN Call Setup and Data Link Protocols
Call setup differs between ISDN and modems. With a telephone call and with analog 
modems, DTMF tones are sent across the analog local loop to the telco. The telco switch at 
the local CO interprets the dialed digits and sets up the call. However, with ISDN, there is 
no analog local loop over which the analog DTMF tones can be sent.

450     Chapter 15: Remote Access Technologies
ISDN devices send and receive signaling messages to and from the local ISDN switch to 
which it is connected. In telco terminology, signaling refers to any type of request to establish 
a circuit. So, punching keys on your telephone is considered signaling to set up a circuit over 
an analog local line. Instead of DTMF tones, ISDN deﬁnes a set of messages that are sent 
over the D channel to the local CO. As a result, the PSTN sets up a circuit to the ISDN device 
whose phone number was put inside the signaling message. Figure 15-9 outlines the process 
and the result.
Figure 15-9
D Channel Call Setup Signaling and Resulting B-Channel Call
The service provider can use anything it wants to set up the call inside its network. ITU 
Q.931 messages are used for signaling between the ISDN device and the CO; typically, 
Signaling System 7 (SS7) is used between the two telco switches—the same protocol used 
inside phone company networks to set up circuits for phone calls.
When the call is established, a 64-kbps circuit exists between a B channel on each of the two 
routers in the ﬁgure. The routers can use High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), but they 
typically use PPP as the data-link protocol on the B channel from end to end. As on leased 
lines and dialed circuits using modems, the switches in the phone company do not interpret 
the bits sent inside this circuit—they just help create a serial bit stream in each direction.
The D channel remains up all the time so that new signaling messages can be sent and 
received. Because the signals are sent outside the channel used for data, this is called out-of-
band signaling.

Typical Uses of ISDN
Routers frequently use ISDN to create a backup link when their primary leased line or Frame 
Relay connection is lost. Although the leased line or Frame Relay access link seldom fails, 
when it does, a remote site might be completely cut off from the rest of the network. 
Depending on the business goals of the network, long outages might not be acceptable, so 
ISDN could be used to dial back to the main site.
The ICND exam covers ISDN as well, including the features and conﬁguration used by 
routers. The scenarios in Figure 15-10 show some of the typical situations in which ISDN 
can be used, described as follows:
■
Case 1 shows dial-on-demand routing (DDR). Logic is conﬁgured in the routers to 
trigger the dial when the user sends trafﬁc that needs to get to another site.
■
Case 2 shows a typical telecommuting environment.
■
Case 3 shows a typical dial-backup topology. The leased line fails, so an ISDN call is 
established between the same two routers.
■
Case 4 shows where an ISDN BRI can be used to dial directly to another router to replace 
a Frame Relay access link or a failed virtual circuit (VC).
Figure 15-10
Typical Occasional Connections Between Routers
PRIs allow for larger-scale ISDN because they support far more B channels on a single 
physical line. Imagine an ISP that supports ISDN, with 1000 customers. If that ISP wanted 
to support up to 230 concurrent ISDN customers, each using a single B channel, that ISP

would need 10 PRIs (assuming that it was in the United States). Also, each user might want 
to use both B channels at the same time, doubling the speed to the Internet; to support 2 B 
channels each for 230 concurrent users, that ISP would need 460 B channels, or the 
equivalent of 20 PRIs. However, if it just used BRI lines, it would need 230 different physical 
BRI lines, which probably would be much more expensive, would require more equipment, 
and would be a cabling hassle.
ISDN supports voice as well as data circuits. ISDN BRI circuits do not support analog voice, 
but they do support digital voice. You might recall that a single PCM voice call requires 64 
kbps and that a single B channel provides 64 kbps. So, ISDN devices, like a terminal adapter, 
perform the PCM encoding and decoding features and send the voice trafﬁc over a B channel. 
In fact, most ISDN modems have two RJ-11 ports that can be used to connect a normal 
analog phone. Figure 15-11 depicts the cabling and some important concepts about how it 
all works.
Figure 15-11
ISDN Support for Voice
The analog phone works just like it normally works. You pick it up and punch in some digits, 
generating DTMF tones. The ISDN TA can’t send the tones, so it interprets the tones and 
generates a signaling message over the D channel. After the telco sets up a circuit over one of 
the B channels, the TA begins using its PCM codec to convert the incoming analog voice from

the phone into PCM digits, sending them across the B channel. In the Figure 15-11 example, 
the other phone is an analog phone connected to the PSTN at Helen’s house. So, the voice switch 
connected to Helen’s phone line converts the incoming digital signal from the back to analog 
voice using a PCM codec, just like it normally does for a call between two analog phone. 
Finally, ISDN supports multiple concurrent data bearer channels. For instance, you can use 
your PC to dial two different sites at the same time. You can make two calls to the same ISP, 
increasing the speed. You also can use one B channel for data and make a voice call using the 
other B channel. 
ISDN Installation and Cabling
ISDN installation for a home-based PC works much like it does for modems. The most 
popular option uses an external ISDN modem, or terminal adapter. Figure 15-12 depicts the 
typical cabling.
Figure 15-12
Cabling a PC to an ISDN TA
In this case, a COM port (shown) or a USB port (not shown) connects to the TA. The TA 
terminates the ISDN cable from the telco. 
The cable from the telco uses an RJ-45 connector, the same type used for Ethernet cables. 
However, the pins used inside the cable are different than those for Ethernet, so do not just 
grab any old cable with an RJ-45 connector. Piins 3 and 6 are used for transmit and pins 4 and 
5 used for receive.
ISDN Summary
ISDN supports a BRI service with 2 B channels, and a PRI service with either 23 (T1) or 30 
(E1) B channels. Signaling for call setup and teardown occurs over an out-of-band D channel.

454     Chapter 15: Remote Access Technologies
After a circuit has been established over a B channel, ISDN provides a Layer 1 service, 
delivering a serial bit stream between the two endpoints of the circuit.
ISDN’s advantages include the capability to support voice calls concurrently with a data call. 
Also, ISDN can be used over the local telco loop, with no signiﬁcant distance limitations. 
And it provides more bandwidth than do modems, particularly with both B channels dialed 
to the same remote site.
ISDN does have a few disadvantages, with the biggest disadvantage being the lower speeds 
than DSL or cable.
Digital Subscriber Line
Any two computers using compatible modems could communicate with each other. Those 
computers might just be two PCs, a PC dialing into a router or access server at one of the 
business ofﬁces, or a PC dialing into a router or access server at an ISP. As long as both 
endpoints have a compatible modem, the two can communicate.
By the time DSL came around in the mid- to late 1990s, the main goal for remote access was 
not the capability to connect to any site anywhere, but to connect to either the Internet or a 
corporate IP network. In years past, modems were used to dial a large variety of different 
computers, which was useful. Today you can think of the Internet like you think of the 
electric company, the gas company, and so on—it’s a utility that provides IP connectivity to 
the rest of the world. 
Because most people today just want access to the utility—in other words, the Internet—DSL 
can be deﬁned a little differently. In fact, DSL was designed to provide high-speed access 
between a home or business and the local CO. By removing the requirement to allow 
connection between any two endpoints, DSL can be deﬁned to reach much higher speeds.
Because DSL really just deﬁnes how to transmit data between a customer site and the local 
CO, the expectation with DSL is that the data would not ﬂow through DS0 channels inside 
the PSTN. Instead, it would be forwarded through some IP network. By removing the need 
to be compatible with the entirety of the core of the PSTN, DSL can be deﬁned to provide 
some nice services and better transmission speeds.
DSL’s basic services have some similarities, as well as differences, when compared to analog 
modems and ISDN lines. Some of the key features are as follows:
■
DSL allows analog voice signals and digital data signals to be sent over the same local 
loop wiring.

Digital Subscriber Line     455
■
Similar to ISDN, the local loop must be connected to something besides a traditional 
voice switch at the local CO: a device called a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM).
■
DSL allows for a concurrent voice call to be up at the same time as the data connection. 
■
Unlike modems and ISDN, DSL’s data component is always on—in other words, you 
don’t have to signal to set up a data circuit.
DSL really does provide some great beneﬁts—you can use the same old phones that you 
already have, you can keep the same phone number, and you can just sit down at your PC at 
home and start using the Internet. Figure 15-13 shows some of the details of a typical DSL 
connection.
Figure 15-13
DSL Connection from the Home
In the home, a DSL modem or DSL-capable router is connected to the phone line (the local 
loop) using a typical telephone cable. The cable uses RJ-11 connectors, as is typical for a 
cable for an analog phone or a modem, with pin 3 for transmit and pin 4 for receive. The 
DSL modem understands the Layer 1 encoding details for DSL and encodes the data 
correctly. DSL routers might include the DSL modem feature, as well as providing other

features, such as IP routing, allowing the home user to connect multiple PCs in the home to 
the Internet at the same time.
DSL allows a concurrent voice call at the same time as allowing an always-on Internet 
connection. The ﬁgure shows an analog phone and a DSL modem connected to a single wall 
plate with two receptacles. Physically, you connect your DSL modem to a wall socket just 
like any of the phones in your house. The phone generates an analog signal at frequency 
ranges between 0 and 4000 Hz; the DSL modem uses frequencies higher than 4000 Hz so 
that they do not interfere with each other very much. You typically need to put a ﬁlter 
between each phone and the wall socket (not shown) to prevent interference. 
The same wiring can be used in the local loop as was used for normal telephone service, but 
now the CO connects the local loop wiring to a device called a DSLAM. The DSLAM splits 
the data and voice signals from the local loop. The DSLAM gives the analog voice signal—
the frequency range between 0 Hz and 4000 Hz—to a voice switch. The voice switch treats 
that signal just like any other analog voice line—the switch listens for DTMF tones, creates 
a circuit, and does PCM encoding to convert the analog signal. 
The DSLAM does not pass the data trafﬁc into the PSTN, however. The DSLAM forwards 
the data trafﬁc to a router owned by the ISP providing the service in this ﬁgure. Alternately, 
the DSLAM can forward the data trafﬁc over an IP network, ultimately reaching a router 
inside a corporate network.
Notice that the ISP’s router actually is depicted as being resident in the local telco’s CO—that 
is true in many cases. However, many people use an ISP that does not happen to be the local 
telco. To support DSL, the ISP works with the local telco to install some of the ISP’s gear in 
the CO—a process called co-location, or co-lo for short. The local telco DSLAM forwards 
and receives the IP packets to and from the ISP router, while the telco maintains control over 
the local voice trafﬁc. 
Typically, the consumer requests high-speed Internet access using DSL from an ISP; the ISP 
charges the customer for the service, and then the ISP pays the local telco some cut of the fee.
DSL Standards
DSL comes in many ﬂavors to meet different needs. For instance, DSL has limits on how long 
the local loop can be (the length of the local loop is simply the length of the combined cables 
that stretch from a house to the CO). Some DSL variants allow the local loop to be much 
longer, while others allow for only a shorter local loop. For the standards with a shorter local 
loop, the transmission rates tend to be much higher—a simple design trade-off. ADSL and 
SDSL tend to be the most popular option in the United States today. 

Digital Subscriber Line     457
Another architectural difference among the different speciﬁcations is that some DSL variants 
use asymmetric transmission rates, while others use symmetric rates. 
Table 15-5 lists the major DSL variants, the standard deﬁning that variant, the speeds, the 
distance limitations, and encoding.
A wide variety of standards bodies and vendor consortiums helped develop these standards. 
As you might imagine, with so many standards, many different organizations pushed for 
standards that best met their needs. Over time, the number of differing standards will 
stabilize.

DSL Protocols
DSL itself provides a Layer 1 transmission path between two endpoints, in some ways like 
the Layer 1 service that analog modems and ISDN modems provide. However, DSL uses 
some additional protocols to support data transfer. For instance, DSL uses ATM as the Layer 
2 protocol between the DSL router or DSL modem in the home and the ISP router. 
Additionally, DSL uses a protocol called PPP over ATM (PPPoA). PPP and ATM are both 
data-link protocols, but they serve different purposes. PPP provides dynamic address 
assignment by the ISP for the DSL modem and some basic authentication with Challenge 
Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). (CHAP is covered in the CCNA ICND Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide and the ICND exam.) Also, depending on the gear installed at a site, DSL 
might require PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) for trafﬁc between a PC in the home and the DSL 
modem/router in the home. 
Figure 15-14 shows a typical installation using an ADSL router, like the Cisco 827H series. 
The 827H acts as both a router and a DSL modem.

Any PCs at the home can connect to the DSL router using Ethernet. In fact, as is common with 
many DSL routers, the Cisco 827H DSL router includes a four-port Ethernet hub built into 
the router, so you can just cable a PC directly to the 827H. Alternately, you can create an 
Ethernet any way you want, as long as there is Ethernet connectivity from the PC to the DSL 
router. A straight-through Ethernet cable would be used to connect the PC directly to the 
DSL router.
The PC can be conﬁgured just like it would be on any other Ethernet, thinking of the DSL 
router like any other router. The PC would point to the DSL router’s Ethernet IP address as 
its default gateway. The PC even can use DHCP to acquire an IP address, with the DSL router 
providing the DHCP server feature.
DSL provides the Layer 1 encoding features for high-speed transmission over the local loop, 
but it also references ATM as the data-link protocol to use over the DSL link. Back in 
Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of WANs,” you read about the basic features of ATM and 
SONET, and how ATM sends and receives ATM cells at Layer 2, with SONET providing the 
Layer 1 transmission details. DSL deﬁnes how you can use ATM cells over DSL lines, instead 
of over SONET, with the ATM cells being forwarded over the DSL connecting from the home 
to the DSLAM.
The ISP’s router needs to receive the data trafﬁc, not the DSLAM in the local CO. So, the 
DSLAM forwards the ATM cells over the link to the ISP router, probably using an optical 
cable and Sonet at Layer 1. The receiving ISP router can reassemble the cells and extract the 
IP packet.
DSL Summary
DSL provides OSI Layer 1 and Layer 2 services to the home. The goal of DSL is to deliver IP 
packets from the remote user to a router—a router owned by an ISP, or a router resident 
inside a corporate network. To do so, DSL provides a digital Layer 1 service—serial bit 
streams in each direction—between the remote site and the local CO. On top of that, DSL 
uses a combination of ATM, Ethernet, and PPP to help deliver IP packets between the home 
and a router at an ISP. 
DSL brings high-speed remote access capabilities to the home. Depending on the distance to 
the local CO and the DSL standard supported by the local telco, DSL can support over 1 
Mbps. It supports concurrent voice and data, with the data service always being turned on—
no dialing is required. And the service speed does not degrade when more users are added to 
the network.

460     Chapter 15: Remote Access Technologies
DSL has some obvious drawbacks. DSL simply will not be available to some people, 
particular those in rural areas, based on the distance from the home to the CO. The local 
telco must have DSL equipment in the CO before it, or any ISP, can offer DSL services. Also, 
even when the home is close enough to the CO, sites farther from the CO might run slower 
than sites closer to the CO. 
Cable Modems
Of all the access technologies covered in this chapter, cable modems are the only one not 
using a phone line from the local telco for physical connectivity. Many homes also have a 
cable TV service supplied by an analog electrical signal entering the home over a coaxial 
cable—in other words, over the cable TV cabling. Cable modems provide an always-on 
Internet access service, while allowing you to surf the Internet over the cable and make all 
the phone calls you want over your telephone line—and you can watch TV at the same time! 
Cable modems use some of the bandwidth that otherwise might have been allocated for new 
TV channels, using those frequency bands for transferring data. It’s a little like having an 
“Internet” channel to go along with CNN, TBS, ESPN, The Cartoon Network, and all your 
other favorite cable channels.
To appreciate how cable modems work, you need a little perspective on some cable TV 
terminology. Cable TV traditionally has been a one-way service—the cable provider sends 
electrical signals down the cable for all the channels. All you have to do, after the physical 
installation is complete, is choose the channel you want to watch. While you are watching 
The Cartoon Network, the electrical signals for CNN still are coming into your house over 
the cable—your TV is just ignoring that part of the signal. If you have two TVs in your house, 
you can watch two different channels because the signals for all the channels are being sent 
down the cable.
Cable TV technology has its own set of terminology, just like most of the other access 
technologies covered in this chapter. Figure 15-15 outlines some of the key terms.
The cable head-end site is a main site that receives the programming. Programming typically 
is received via a satellite receiver dish. The head end converts the signals to match the correct 
encoding and frequencies used on the cable and transmits the signals. It also might scramble 
channels that require an extra fee from subscribers so that you have to get a descrambler—
typically called a set-top box—from the CATV company.

Cable Modems     461
Figure 15-15
Cable TV Terminology
Essentially, the CATV signal is broadcast over the rest of the cable plant, being ampliﬁed 
along the way. A drop cable taps into the distibution cable that runs near your house and 
then enters your home and connects to the back of a wall plate near your TV. You just need 
to run the short coax cable from the back of your TV to the wall plug, and the cabling is 
complete.
Because most people will want to watch TV as well, possibly multiple TVs, the drop cable 
must be split. Splitting does not mean literally taking the wire out of the cable and cutting it 
in half—instead, it means that you use a small device that passively lets the signal coming in 
from the street pass through to other cables in your house. You can use the same kind of line 
splitter when using a cable modem that you use when you connect two TVs to the cable TV 
line at the same time. In the ﬁgure, the splitter connects to the drop cable, as well as the two 
cables connecting to the cable modem and the TV. The splitter just takes the incoming signal

from the drop cable and passes it out both of the other lines. Note that the connector, the 
round connector common on most CATV cabling, is called an f-connector.
When using a cable modem, the CATV company becomes your ISP. Everything between your 
house and the router at the head end is a single physical and data link. The PC in your home 
uses a router owned by the cable company, housed at the head-end site, as its default 
gateway. In fact, the PC typically uses DHCP to discover its IP address and the IP address of 
its default gateway; the DHCP server would be inside the cable company’s IP network, 
typically at the head-end site. 
Conceptually, what happens between the home and the cable head end is similar to a single 
LAN segment. The details, of course, are different, but the cable installation provides a 
combination of Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols to let a PC deliver IP packets to a router inside 
the cable network. So, as you read about the details of what happens between the home and 
the router at the head end, keep in mind that the goal is simply to deliver IP packets between 
the home and the head-end router, and vice versa. 
Layer 1 and Layer 2 between the Home and the Head End 
Cable TV systems originally were built to send TV video and audio signals to lots of places, 
with no need to receive a signal back. In other words, the idea of having someone’s TV send 
some information back to the cable company was not even under consideration. Because the 
original CATV architecture allowed for sending signals from the head end outward, and the 
capability for two-way communication was added later, data over cable standards treats data 
going toward the home differently than data coming from the home. In fact, CATV 
terminology refers to the data going toward the home as downstream data, and data from 
the home as upstream data.
Downstream data uses standards that are consistent with some of the standards for sending 
digital video over cable. In fact, you can think of the downstream data as being sent over 
another TV channel. For downstream data, the data over cable standards takes advantage of 
the fact that the signals are broadcast to all subscribers in a section of the cable plant. Just 
like the TV channels’ signals go to every home, the signals for the downstream data go to 
every home. In many ways, the concepts are similar to an Ethernet broadcast domain: When 
a broadcast Ethernet frame is sent, everyone in the broadcast domain receives the frame. 
With downstream cable transmissions, not just broadcast frames, but all data, is broadcast 
to all receivers. Yes, the data that you receive over the web actually could be captured with 
a network analysis tool by one of your neighbors. 
Because every home in a part of the cable network receives the same data channel, some form 
of addresses must be used so that only the correct device tries to process incoming data. For 

Cable Modems     463
instance, your PC does not need to process any data being sent to your neighbor’s PC. So, 
CATV standards call for the use of a data-link protocol called Multimedia Cable Network 
Systems (MCNS) MAC. (You might remember that MAC stands for Media Access Control.) 
MCNS is similar to Ethernet’s MAC, as deﬁned in the IEEE 802.3 speciﬁcation, including the 
use of Ethernet MAC addresses. So, although all downstream data is sent to all drops in the 
cable system, only those with a cable modem know that data has been received, and only the 
PCs with the correct MAC address process the data. 
MCNS also deﬁnes the physical encoding details. MCNS calls for the use of a modulation 
method called quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Two options can be used for 
downstream data, one called QAM-64 and the other called QAM-256. QAM-64 represents 
6 bits per baud, and QAM-256 represents 8 bits per baud.
Table 15-6 summarizes some of the key reference information about downstream data over 
cable.
Upstream Data
The upstream data channel uses a totally separate frequency range than the downstream 
channel, so no collisions occur between downstream and upstream data. However, all 
upstream data from multiple cable subscribers does share the same frequency range—the 
same channel, essentially—so collisions can occur between data sent toward the Internet by 
the different home users.
Noticing that a collision has occurred in an upstream cable channel is much more difﬁcult 
than with an Ethernet. Cables inside the CATV cable plant might be miles long, which means 
that a device would have to wait longer for the electrical signal from a collision to return. So, 
the CSMA/CD algorithm used by Ethernet does not work well on the upstream channel. 
Instead, MCNS deﬁnes the use of a multiplexing method called time-division multiple access 
(TDMA), in which each home user is granted regular time periods during which to send 
upstream data. These time slots happen multiple times per second. By using TDMA, most 
collisions can be avoided.

The upstream channel uses the same data-link protocols as the downstream channel, with 
MAC addressing, but it uses different modulation schemes. The upstream channel uses 
quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) or QAM-16. QPSK modulates the signal using phase 
shifts, while QAM uses amplitude modulation. 
Both the downstream and upstream channels compete with other users for the use of the 
channel. So, as more subscribers are added, the actual throughput of the connection actually 
can slow down.
Table 15-7 summarizes some of the key points about the upstream data channel.
Cable Modem Summary
Like DSL, cable modems bring high-speed remote access capabilities to the home. The speeds 
might seem astounding—30 to 40 Mbps downstream is indeed impressive. In fact, I had a 
cable modem a few years ago and was one of the ﬁrst people in my neighborhood to get it. I 
surfed the web much faster from home than I did from the local Cisco Systems ofﬁce! The 
data service is always on, even when someone is watching TV. Because it doesn’t use the 
telephone line at all, you also can use the phone at the same time.
Cable modems do have a few drawbacks. The per-user data rates degrade as more users are 
added to the network. Also, because the network broadcasts all downstream trafﬁc, anyone 
can put a network-analysis tool in their home and get a copy of what their neighbor is 
receiving. 
Comparison of Remote Access Technologies
This chapter scratches the surface of how modems, ISDN, cable, and DSL work. Consumers 
choose between these options for Internet access all the time, and network engineers choose 
between these options for supporting their work-at-home users as well. So, it seems 
appropriate to close the chapter by listing some of the key comparison points for these 
options.

The remote access technologies in this chapter provide services at Layer 1, and possibly Layer 
2, of the OSI reference model. TCP/IP and all the associated higher-layer protocols (TCP, 
UDP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, and so on) can run over any of these access 
technologies; the differences lie in what is done at Layers 1 and 2. Figure 15-16 outlines the 
protocols used by each.

The remote access technologies in this chapter provide services at Layer 1, and possibly Layer 2, 
of the OSI model. TCP/IP and all the associated higher-layer protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, 
Telnet, DNS, DHCP, and so on) can run over any of these access technologies; the differences lie 
in what is done at Layers 1 and 2. Figure 15-21 outlines the protocols used by each.

PART VI: Final Preparation
Chapter 16: Final Preparation


C H A P T E R16
Final Preparation 
So, you have made it through most of the book, and you have probably either scheduled 
your INTRO exam or CCNA exam, or at least thought about when you want to try to 
take it. Congratulations for getting this far! You will soon have ﬁnished your ﬁrst step 
toward building your networking career résumé.
This chapter provides some tips on your ﬁnal preparation for the exam. It also provides 
an example scenario, which helps you to pull many of the hands-on skills together into 
a single review section.
Suggestions for Final Preparation
Everyone has their own study habits, and you should know what works well for you. 
However, here are a few suggestions you can try in the week or two before you take the exam:
■
Reread the “Foundation Summary” sections of each chapter. 
■
When reviewing tables and deﬁnitions, you should cover up portions of summary 
tables with a piece of paper, forcing yourself to try to remember the details instead 
of just glancing at them.
■
Answer all the questions from inside the book again. You should strive to master 
these questions so that you can answer the questions quickly.
■
If you are still slow in answering subnetting questions, practice until you can ﬁnd the 
subnet number and broadcast address when the mask is “difﬁcult” within 1 minute. 
You can use the CD-based chapter with 25 subnetting practice questions for this 
exercise.
■
Before using the CD for general questions, use the mode that lets you perform a 
simulated exam. This will help you prepare for the exam experience.
■
Repeat answering all the questions on the CD until you can answer most of them 
almost automatically.

480     Chapter 16: Final Preparation
■
Using a real set of routers and switches, or using a simulation product (such as Netsim, 
which is included on the accompanying CD), practice these basic skills:
— Accessing a switch and a router
— Conﬁguring basic administrative settings (passwords, host name, IP 
addresses)
— Practice conﬁguring IP, static routes, and RIP
— Refer to Appendix C for a list of labs from this book that can be performed 
using the NetSim simulator that is included on the accompanying CD.
Preparing for the Actual Exam Experience
For some of you, either the INTRO exam or the CCNA exam will be your ﬁrst experience 
with a proctored computer-based exam for Cisco certiﬁcation. Do not be alarmed—it's not 
terribly different than using the exam software on the CD that came with the book. However, 
you should go into the exam day with the following in mind:
■
You typically need two forms of ID, at least one of which is a picture ID. A driver's 
license, a passport, and a military ID are all valid. 
■
The testing center is probably just an extra room inside the ofﬁces of a company that 
does something else for its primary business. Often training companies are also testing 
centers. The proctor usually has other responsibilities besides monitoring the exams. The 
proctor seldom enters the testing room, other than to bring in another person who has 
an exam scheduled. So, do not worry about someone staring at you and making you 
nervous. However, most testing centers do have video cameras for monitoring—just 
because you cannot see them, it does not mean that they are not watching.
■
You will need to turn off all electronics that you bring with you—phone, pager, and 
secret decoder rings. I typically just leave them in the car. They may ask you to leave your 
pager or phone at the front desk as well.
■
You cannot bring any of your own paper into the room, either. The proctor will give you 
something to write on, either paper or a dry-erase board and marker. In either case, you 
should return these to the proctor when you are done.
■
You will take the exam using a PC. The proctor will start the software for you; all you 
have to do is follow the instructions. You will not be forced to start the exam the instant 
that you sit down because you will typically be allowed to take a four- to ﬁve-question 
practice test. The practice exam asks you questions in different formats about a totally 
unrelated topic, just to let you get used to the interface. Cisco often adds an optional 

Suggestions for Final Preparation     481
survey before the exam as well, just to gather demographic information about who is 
taking the exam. If you've never taken a Cisco exam, take the extra few minutes to take 
the practice test, just to get completely comfortable with the environment.
■
You can actually write on your scratch paper before the exam begins, if you like. For 
instance, some people like to write down the list of all the valid subnet masks, the 
corresponding preﬁxes, and possibly even the binary equivalents for the decimal 
numbers used inside subnet masks. I've heard of some people writing down hard-to-
memorize information that they were cramming for in the lobby of the testing center! 
Personally, I do not ﬁnd it helpful to write down the hard-to-memorize things right 
before the exam begins, but for some people, it does help. Many people ﬁnd it helpful to 
write down the subnetting information just mentioned.
■
The exam engine does not let you go back and change an earlier answer. So, read each 
question thoroughly and read every answer thoroughly. When you move on to the 
next question, you can't go back.
■
Some questions require that you drag and drop the answers into the correct slots in an 
answer area. Exam question writers like to use this type of question for lists or sequences 
in particular. Like all questions, you can answer and then change the answer, as long as 
you have not moved on to the next question yet. For drag-and-drop questions, many 
people beneﬁt from moving the answers they are conﬁdent about into the (presumably) 
correct place, and then they ﬁt in the others in; a lot of times, that helps complete the 
answers correctly. Just don't forget, when you move on to the next question, you can't 
go back!
■
For simulated lab questions, you should go back and conﬁrm that any new 
conﬁgurations are working. For instance, if the question asks that you conﬁgure RIP, but 
you do not see any routes when you use a show ip route command, then you have not 
ﬁnished the question correctly. The simulator used on the exam does work so that the 
show commands reﬂect what should actually be happening. Many of the simulated lab 
questions require that you conﬁgure something, but it will also be helpful if you know 
the pertinent show commands to verify the correct operation. Also, just for good 
measure, save your conﬁguration unless the question tells you not to.
That's a long list, but hopefully it will help you prepare for taking the exam. The most 
important tip is to simply relax. A good night's rest is better than a night full of cramming 
for most people. 

482     Chapter 16: Final Preparation
The following list gives a short reminder of the things you might want to keep in mind as you 
prepare to walk in the door at the testing center:
■
Bring two pens.
■
Bring two IDs, one with a picture.
■
Turn off your electronics before going to the exam room.
■
Relax!
A Final Lab Scenario
The current CCNA exams include simulated lab questions. The best way to prepare for those is 
to work with live networks using Cisco routers and switches. You should also make sure to do 
all the questions in the testing engine on the CD, as it contains a large number of simulated lab 
questions. You can also use the NetSim network simulator on the CD, or rent time via online labs. 
Regardless of how much time and effort you spend with hands-on practice, the following lab 
scenario can help you with your ﬁnal preparation if you simply read through the scenario. 
Throughout the book, the portions that covered how to do something on a switch or a router 
focused on the speciﬁc topics covered in that chapter. The scenario in this chapter touches on 
many of the topics in this book that are in some way related to conﬁguration or operation of 
a router or switch. So, you can use this scenario as part of your strategy for ﬁnal preparation 
for the exam. 
If you have enough time, review all the parts of the scenario. If you have time, try to perform 
all the tasks outlined in Steps A, B, and C. However, if you have limited time, you might want 
to review the problem statements and then review the answers for each of the three parts. At 
least you will get a good review of some of the more important commands that could be on 
the exam. 
If you are reading this chapter as your ﬁnal review before taking the exam, let me take this 
opportunity to wish you success. Hopefully, you will be relaxed and conﬁdent for your 
exam—and hopefully, this book will have helped you build your knowledge and conﬁdence.
Scenario, Part A: Planning
This scenario has three parts, listed as Parts A, B, and C. Part A begins with some planning 
guidelines that mainly consist of planning an IP addressing scheme for a network. After you 
complete Part A, Part B of the scenario asks you to conﬁgure the three routers and one switch 
to implement the planned design. Finally, Part C asks you to examine router command 
output and answer questions about the details of current operation of the network. Part C 
also lists some questions related to the user interface and protocol speciﬁcations.

Scenario, Part A: Planning     483
Your job is to deploy a new network with three sites, as shown in Figure 16-1. The decision 
to use point-to-point serial links has already been made, and the products have been chosen. 
For Part A of this scenario, perform the following tasks:
1.
Plan the IP addressing and subnets used in this network. Class B network 163.1.0.0 has 
been assigned by the NIC. The maximum number of hosts per subnet is 100. 
2.
Assign IP addresses to the PCs as well. 
3.
Assign addresses for the switches near R1 for management purposes. 
Assume that a single VLAN is used on the switches near Router 1 (R1).
Tables 16-1 and 16-2 are provided as a convenient place to record your IP subnets and IP 
addresses when performing the planning tasks for this scenario.

Scenario, Part A: Planning     485
Solutions to Part A: Planning
It's a good idea to keep the design as simple as possible, without making it so simple that it 
will not be useful as the network evolves. In this case, any subnet mask with at least 7 host 
bits would work, including the easy mask of 255.255.255.0. Any choice of mask between 
255.255.224.0 and 255.255.255.128 would have allowed for 6 subnets and 100 hosts per 
subnet.
Table 16-3 shows one solution for the subnet numbers chosen, using mask 255.255.255.128, 
with Table 16-4 showing some sample IP address assignments.

486     Chapter 16: Final Preparation
As long as the numbers are in the right subnet, the actual IP addresses that you chose for your 
answer are ﬁne. I just picked numbers between 200 and 209 for the last octet for router 
addresses, and between 210 and 239 for the switches and PCs. For the servers, I made the 
last octet match the server number. In real networks, you might reserve particular ranges of 
last octet values in each subnet for network overhead devices. For instance, all of your 
routers' LAN interface IP addresses might always be between 1 and 5.
Scenario Part B: Conﬁguration
The next step in your job is to deploy the network designed in Part A. Perform the following 
tasks:
1.
Conﬁgure IP addresses based on the design from Part A.
2.
Although this book did not cover RIP conﬁguration, assume that someone else who 
knows how to conﬁgure RIP will conﬁgure the routers to support RIP.
3.
Use PPP as the data-link protocol on the link between R2 and R3. Use the default serial 
encapsulation elsewhere.
4.
Conﬁgure basic administrative settings for SW3, assuming that it is a 2950 series switch. 
Set the host name, IP address, default gateway, enable password, telnet password, and 
console password. Save the conﬁguration as well.
Solutions to Part B: Conﬁguration

Which of the following terms is used speciﬁcally to identify the entity that is created 
when encapsulating data inside data-link headers and trailers? 
Answer: D
Q&A
1.
Name the seven layers of the OSI model.
Answer: Application (Layer 7), presentation (Layer 6), session (Layer 5), transport 
(Layer 4), network (Layer 3), data link (Layer 2), and physical (Layer 1). Some 
mnemonics to help you recall the names of the layers are: All People Seem To Need Data 
Processing (Layers 7 to 1), Please Do Not Take Sausage Pizzas Away (Layers 1 to 7), and 
the ever-popular Pew! Dead Ninja Turtles Smell Particularly Awful (Layers 1 to 7).
2.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 7?
Answer: Layer 7 (the application layer) provides standardized services to applications. 
The deﬁnition for this layer is typically ambiguous because it varies. The key is that it 
does not deﬁne a user interface, but instead it is a sort of toolbox used by application 
developers. For example, a web browser is an application that uses HTTP, as deﬁned as 
a TCP/IP application layer protocol, to transfer the contents of web page between a 
server and client.
3.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 6?
Answer: Layer 6 (the presentation layer) deﬁnes data formats, compression, and possibly 
encryption.
4.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 5?
Answer: Layer 5 (the session layer) controls the conversation between two endpoints. 
Although the term used is session, the term conversation more accurately describes what 
is accomplished. The session layer ensures that not only communication, but also useful 
sets of communication between endpoints is accomplished.

Chapter 2     501
5.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 4?
Answer: Layer 4 (the transport layer) provides end-to-end error recovery, if requested.
6.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 3?
Answer: Layer 3 (the network layer) deﬁnes logical addressing and routing as a means 
of delivering data across an entire network. IP and IPX are two examples of Layer 3–
equivalent protocols.
7.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 2?
Answer: The data link layer deﬁnes addressing speciﬁc to a particular medium as part of 
the means of providing delivery of data across that medium. It also includes the 
protocols used to determine what device(s) accesses the media at any point in time.
8.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 1?
Answer: Layer 1 (physical layer) is responsible for encoding energy signals onto the 
medium and interpreting a received energy signal. Layer 1 also deﬁnes the connector and 
cabling details.
9.
Describe the process of data encapsulation as data is processed from creation until it 
exits a physical interface to a network. Use the OSI model as an example.
Answer: Data encapsulation represents the process of a layer adding a header (and 
possibly a trailer) to the data as it is processed by progressively lower layers in the 
protocol speciﬁcation. In the context of OSI, each layer could add a header so that—
other than the true application data—there would be six other headers (Layers 2 to 7) 
and a trailer for Layer 2, with this L2PDU being encoded by the physical layer onto the 
network media.
10.
Name three beneﬁts to layering networking protocol speciﬁcations.
Answer: Some examples of beneﬁts to layering networking protocol speciﬁcations 
include reduced complexity, standardized interfaces, modular engineering, interoperable 
technology, accelerated evolution, and simpliﬁed teaching and learning. Questions such 
as this on the exam require some subjective interpretation of the wording on your part. 
11.
What header or trailer does a router discard as a side effect of routing?
Answer: A router discards the data-link header and trailer as a side effect of routing. This 
is because the network layer, where routing is deﬁned, is interested in delivering the 
network layer (Layer 3) PDU from end to end. Routing uses intermediate data links 

502     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes and Q&A Sections
(Layer 2) to transport the data to the next routers and eventually to the true destination. 
The data-link header and trailer are useful only to deliver the data to the next router or 
host, so the header and trailer are discarded by each router.
12.
What OSI layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer?
Answer: The data link layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer. The 
trailer typically includes a frame check sequence (FCS), which is used to perform error 
detection.
13.
What terms are used to describe the contents of the data encapsulated by the data link, 
network, and transport layers, respectively?
Answer: Frame, packet, and segment, respectively.
14.
Explain the meaning of the term L5PDU.
Answer: PDU stands for protocol data unit. A PDU is the entity that includes the headers 
and trailers created by a particular networking layer, plus any encapsulated data. For 
instance, an L5PDU includes Layer 5 headers and the encapsulated data.
15.
Explain how Layer x on one computer communicates with Layer x on another computer.
Answer: Each layer of a networking model works with the same layer on another 
computer with which it wants to communicate. The protocol deﬁned by each layer uses 
a header that is transmitted between the computers to communicate what each computer 
wants to do.
16.
List the terms behind the acronym TCP/IP.
Answer: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol.
17.
List the terms behind the acronym OSI.
Answer: Open Systems Interconnection.

Q&A
1.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 2?
Answer: The data link layer deﬁnes addressing speciﬁc to a particular medium as part of 
the means of providing delivery of data across that medium. It also includes the 
protocols used to determine what device(s) accesses the media at any point in time.

2.
What is the main purpose(s) of Layer 1?
Answer: Layer 1 (the physical layer) is responsible for encoding energy signals onto the 
medium and interpreting a received energy signal. Layer 1 also deﬁnes the connector and 
cabling details.
3.
What does MAC stand for?
Answer: MAC stands for Media Access Control.
4.
Name three terms popularly used as a synonym for MAC address.
Answer: NIC address, card address, LAN address, hardware address, Ethernet address, 
Token Ring address, FDDI address, and burned-in address are all synonymous with 
MAC address. All of these names are used casually and in formal documents, and they 
refer to the same 6-byte MAC address concept as deﬁned by IEEE.
5.
What portion of a MAC address encodes an identiﬁer representing the manufacturer of 
the card?
Answer: The ﬁrst 3 bytes, called the Organizationally Unique Identiﬁed (OUI), comprise 
the portion of a MAC address that encodes an identiﬁer representing the manufacturer 
of the card.
6.
Are MAC addresses deﬁned by a Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol?
Answer: MAC addresses are deﬁned by a Layer 2 protocol. Ethernet and Token Ring 
MAC addresses are deﬁned in the 802.3 and 802.5 speciﬁcations.
7.
How many bits are present in a MAC address?
Answer: MAC addresses have 48 bits. The ﬁrst 24 bits for burned-in addresses represent 
a code that identiﬁes the manufacturer.
8.
Name the two main parts of a MAC address. Which part identiﬁes which “group” this 
address is a member of?
Answer: There are no parts, and nothing deﬁnes a grouping concept in a MAC address. 
This is a trick question. Although you might have guessed that the MAC address has two 
parts—the ﬁrst part dictated to the manufacturer, and the second part made up by the 
manufacturer—there is no grouping concept.
9.
What OSI layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer?
Answer: The data link layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer. The 
trailer typically includes a frame check sequence (FCS), which is used to perform error 
detection.

Chapter 3     505
10.
If a Fast Ethernet NIC currently is receiving a frame, can it begin sending a frame?
Answer: Yes, if the NIC is operating in full-duplex mode.
11.
What are the two key differences between a 10-Mbps NIC and a 10/100 NIC?
Answer: The obvious beneﬁt is that the 10/100 NIC can run at 100 Mbps. The other 
beneﬁt is that 10/100 NICs can autonegotiate both speed and duplex between itself and 
the device that it is cabled to, typically a LAN switch.
12.
What is the distance limitation of a single cable for 10BASE-T? For 100 BASE-TX?
Answer: 10BASE-T allows 100 m between the device and the hub or switch, as does 100 
BASE-TX.
13.
How fast is Fast Ethernet?
Answer: 100 million bits per second (100 Mbps).
14.
How many bytes long is a MAC address?
Answer: 6 bytes long, or 48 bits.
15.
Deﬁne the difference between broadcast and multicast MAC addresses.
Answer: Both identify more than one device on the LAN. Broadcast always implies all 
devices on the LAN, whereas multicast implies some subset of all devices. Multicast is 
not allowed on Token Ring; broadcast is allowed on all LAN types. Devices that intend 
to receive frames addressed to a particular multicast address must be aware of the 
particular multicast address(es) that they should process. These addresses are dependent 
on the applications used. Read RFC 1112, “The Internet Group Message Protocol 
(IGMP),” for related information about the use of Ethernet multicast in conjunction 
with IP multicast. For example, the broadcast address is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF, and one 
sample multicast address is 0100.5e00.0001.
16.
Explain the function of the loopback and collision-detection features of an Ethernet NIC 
in relation to half-duplex and full-duplex operations.
Answer: The loopback feature copies the transmitted frame back onto the receive pin on 
the NIC interface. The collision-detection logic compares the received frame to the 
transmitted frame during transmission; if the signals do not match, a collision is 
occurring. With full-duplex operation, collisions cannot occur, so the loopback and 
collision-detection features are purposefully disabled, and concurrent transmission and 
reception is allowed.

Q&A
1.
Are DLCI addresses deﬁned by a Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol?
Answer: DLCI addresses are deﬁned by a Layer 2 protocol. Although they are not 
covered speciﬁcally in this chapter, Frame Relay protocols do not deﬁne a logical 
addressing structure that can usefully exist outside a Frame Relay network; by deﬁnition, 
the addresses would be OSI Layer 2–equivalent.
2.
What OSI layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer?
Answer: The data link layer typically encapsulates using both a header and a trailer. The 
trailer typically includes a frame check sequence (FCS), which is used to perform error 
detection.
3.
Deﬁne the terms DCE and DTE in the context of the physical layer and a point-to-point 
serial link.
Answer: At the physical layer, DTE refers to the device that looks for clocking from the 
device on the other end of the cable on a link. The DCE supplies that clocking. For 
example, the computer is typically the DTE, and the modem or CSU/DSU is the DCE. 
At the data link layer, both X.25 and Frame Relay deﬁne a logical DTE and DCE. In this 
case, the customer premises equipment (CPE), such as a router and a CSU/DSU, is the 
logical DTE, and the service provider equipment (the Frame Relay switch and the CSU/
DSU) is the DCE.
4.
Which layer or layers of OSI are most closely related to the functions of Frame Relay? 
Why?
Answer: OSI Layers 1 and 2. Frame Relay refers to well-known physical layer 
speciﬁcations. Frame Relay does deﬁne headers for delivery across the Frame Relay 
cloud, making it a Layer 2 protocol. Frame Relay does not include any routing or logical 
addressing speciﬁcations, so it is not a Layer 3 protocol.
5.
What is the name of the ﬁeld that identiﬁes, or addresses, a Frame Relay virtual circuit?
Answer: The data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI) is used to identify a VC. 
6.
True or False: “A leased line between two routers provides a constant amount of 
bandwidth—never more and never less.” Defend your answer.
Answer: True. A leased line creates the cabling equivalent of having a cable between the 
two routers, with the speed (clock rate) deﬁned by the telco. Even when the routers have 
no data to send, the full bandwidth is available to be used.

508     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes and Q&A Sections
7.
True or False: “Frame Relay VCs provide a constant amount of bandwidth between two 
devices, typically routers—never more and never less.” Defend your answer.
Answer: False. The provider assigns a guaranteed bandwidth, or CIR, for a VC, but the 
routers on either end of the VC can send more than the CIR of data. As long as the service 
provider has enough capacity to support it, the frames are forwarded over the VC.
8.
Explain how many DS0 channels ﬁt into a T1, and why the total does not add up to the 
purported speed of a T1, which is 1.544 Mbps.
Answer: Each DS0 channel runs at 64 kbps. With 24 in a T1, the T1 speed seemingly 
would be 24 * 64 kbps, or 1.536 Mbps. T1 also includes 8 kbps for management, which, 
when added to the 1.536 Mbps total, gives you the full T1 rate—1.544 Mbps.
9.
Deﬁne the term synchronous.
Answer: The imposition of time ordering on a bit stream. Practically, a device will try to 
use the same speed as another device on the other end of a serial link. By examining 
transitions between voltage states on the link, the device can notice slight variations in 
the speed on each end and can adjust its speed accordingly.
10.
Imagine a drawing with two routers, each connected to an external CSU/DSU, which 
each is connected with a four-wire circuit, as seen in this chapter. Describe the role of the 
devices in relation to clocking and synchronization.
Answer: The routers receive clocking from their respective CSU/DSUs. One of the two 
CSU/DSUs is conﬁgured as the master. The other CSU/DSU, as the slave, adjusts its 
clock to match the speed of the master CSU/DSU.
11.
Imagine a drawing with two routers, each connected to an external CSU/DSU, which 
each is connected with a four-wire circuit, as seen in this chapter. List the words behind 
the acronyms DTE and DCE, and describe which devices in this imagined network are 
DTE and which are DCE. 
Answer: DTE stands for data terminal equipment, and DCE stands for data 
communications equipment. The routers are DTEs, and the CSU/DSUs are DCEs. 
12.
Imagine a drawing with two routers, each connected to a Frame Relay switch over a local 
access link. Describe which devices in this imagined network are Frame Relay DTEs and

13.
Do HDLC and PPP, as implemented by Cisco routers, support protocol type ﬁelds and 
error detection? Explain your answer. 
Answer: Both protocols support a protocol type ﬁeld and an FCS ﬁeld to perform error 
detection. PPP has both ﬁelds based on the protocol speciﬁcation; Cisco added the 
protocol type ﬁeld to the standard HDLC header.
14.
Imagine a point-to-point leased line between two routers, with PPP in use. What are the 
names of the protocols inside PPP that would be used on this link? What are their main 
functions? 
Answer: The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) controls and manages the link. The IP 
Control Protocol (IPCP) also would be used because you need a CP for each Layer 3 
protocol. IPCP can assign IP addresses to devices on the other end of a link.
15.
What are some of the main similarities between Frame Relay and ATM? 
Answer: Both use an access link to access the service provider. Both use the concept of a 
virtual circuit between DTE devices. And both allow multiple VCs to cross a single 
access link.
16.
Compare and contrast ATM and SONET in terms of the OSI model. 
Answer: SONET deﬁnes the Layer 1 details of passing trafﬁc over optical cabling, 
whereas ATM provides the Layer 2 functionality, including link-speciﬁc addressing,  
framing, and error detection.
17.
Besides HDLC and PPP, list the other four serial point-to-point data-link protocols 
covered in this chapter. 
Answer: SDLC, LAPB, LAPD, and LAPF.

Answer: A
Q&A
1.
What are the two main functions of each OSI Layer 3–equivalent protocol?
Answer: Path selection, which is also called routing, and logical addressing.
2.
Assume that PC1 sends data to PC2, and PC2 is separated from PC1 by at least one 
router. Are the IP addresses of the PCs in the same IP subnet? Explain your answer.
Answer: They must be in different subnets. IP addressing rules require that IP hosts 
separated by a router be in different subnets.
3.
Assume that PC1 sends data to PC2, and PC2 is not separated from PC1 by at least one 
router. Are the IP, addresses of the PCs in the same IP subnet? Explain your answer.
Answer: They must be in the same subnet. IP addressing rules require that IP hosts not 
separated by a router be in the same subnet.
4.
How many bits are present in an IP address?
Answer: IP addresses have 32 bits: a variable number in the network portion, and the 
rest of the 32 in the host portion. IP Version 6 uses a 128-bit address!
5.
How many bits are present in an IPX address?
Answer: IPX addresses have 80 bits: 32 bits in the network portion and 48 bits in the 
node portion.

Name the two main parts of an IPX address. Which part identiﬁes which group this 
address is a member of?
Answer: Network number and node number are the two main parts of an IPX address. 
Addresses with the same network number are in the same group. On LAN interfaces, the 
node number is made to have the same value as the LAN MAC address.
8.
Name the two main parts of an IP address. Which part identiﬁes which group this 
address is a member of?
Answer: Network and host are the two main parts of an IP address. As described in 
Chapter 5, technically there are three portions of the IP address: network, subnet, and 
host. However, because most people think of the network and subnet portions as one 
portion, another correct answer to this question, using popular terminology, would be 
subnet and host. In short, without subnetting, the network part identiﬁes the group; with 
subnetting, the network and subnet part together identiﬁes the group.
9.
PC1 sends data to PC2 using TCP/IP. Three routers separate PC1 and PC2. Explain why 
the statement “PC1 sends an Ethernet frame to PC2” is true or false.
Answer: False. Packets are delivered from end to end across a network, whereas frames 
simply pass between devices on each common physical network. The intervening routers 
discard the original Ethernet header, replacing it with other data-link headers as needed. 
A truer statement would be “PC1 sends an IP packet to PC2.”
10.
In IP addressing, how many octets are in 1 byte?
Answer: One. Octet is a generic word to describe a single byte. Each IP address is 4 bytes, 
or four octets, long.
11.
Describe the differences between a routed protocol and a routing protocol.
Answer: The routed protocol deﬁnes the addressing and Layer 3 header in the packet 
that actually is forwarded by a router. The routing protocol deﬁnes the process of 
routers exchanging topology data so that the routers know how to forward the data. A 
router uses the routing table created by the routing protocol when choosing where to 
route a packet.
12.
Name at least three routed protocols.
Answer: TCP/IP (IP), Novell (IPX), OSI (CLNP), DECnet (CLNP), AppleTalk (DDP), 
and VINES are some examples of routed protocols.

Imagine an IP host on an Ethernet, with a single router attached to the same segment. In 
which cases does an IP host choose to send a packet to this router instead of directly to 
the destination host, and how does this IP host know about that single router?
Answer: Typically an IP host knows to what router to send a packet based on its 
conﬁgured default router. If the destination of the packet is in another subnet, the host 
sends the packet to the default router. Otherwise, the host sends the packet directly to 
the destination host because it is in the same subnet and, by deﬁnition, must be on the 
same data link.
15.
Name three items in an entry in any routing table.
Answer: A number that identiﬁes a group of addresses, the interface out which to forward 
the packet, and the Layer 3 address of the next router to send this packet to are three items 
that you will always ﬁnd in a routing table entry. For instance, IP routes contain subnet 
numbers, the outgoing interface, and the IP address of the next-hop router.
16.
Name the parts of an IP address when subnetting is used.
Answer: Network, subnet, and host are the three parts of an IP address. However, many 
people commonly treat the network and subnet parts of an address as a single part, 
leaving only two parts, the subnet and host parts. On the exam, the multiple-choice 
format should provide extra clues as to which terminology is used. 
17.

23.
When subnetting a Class B network, do you create the subnet ﬁeld by taking bits from 
the network part of the address or the host part?
Answer: Host part.
24.
When subnetting a Class B network, using the entire third octet for the subnet part, 
describe the number of possible subnets created.
Answer: The subnet part consists of a full octet, which is 8 bits long. You can number 
28 things with 8 bits, or 256. However, 2 subnet numbers are reserved, leaving 254 
subnets.
25.
When subnetting a Class A network using the entire second octet for the subnet part, 
describe the number of hosts in each subnet.
Answer: The host part consists of two entire octets in this case, which is 16 bits long. 
You can number 216 things with 16 bits, or 65,536. However, 2 subnet numbers are 
reserved, leaving 65,534 hosts per subnet.
26.
When a router hears about multiple routes to the same subnet, how does it choose which 
route to use?
Answer: Routing protocols use a metric to describe how good each route is. The lower 
the metric is, the better the route is.
27.
What is the primary purpose of a routing protocol?
Answer: Routing protocols discover the routes in network and build routing tables.
28.
True or false: “Routing protocols are required to learn routes of directly connected 
subnets.”
Answer: False. Routers add routes to directly connected subnets when the interfaces 
initialize. No routing protocols are needed.

List the similarities and differences between RARP and BOOTP. 
Answer: Both protocols send broadcasts looking for a server, and they hope to have the 
server assign them an IP address. BOOTP also can be used to assign other parameters, 
such as the subnet mask, default gateway, DNS address, and ﬁlenames for downloading 
an operating system.
31.
List the similarities and differences between DHCP and BOOTP. 
Answer: Both protocols send broadcasts looking for a server, and they hope to have the 
server assign them an IP address. Both can be used to assign a large variety of 
parameters, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, DNS address, and ﬁlenames for 
downloading an operating system. DHCP does not require that the server be 
preconﬁgured with the MAC addresses of all the DHCP client PCs, making it much more 
scalable.
32.
List the similarities and differences between ARP and DNS. 
Answer: Both protocols send messages with one bit of information, hoping to learn 
another bit of information. The similarities do not go beyond that fact. DNS requests 
are unicast IP packets sent speciﬁcally to the DNS server, whereas ARP uses a LAN 
broadcast frame. DNS queries supply a name, expecting to hear the corresponding IP 
address back from the server. ARP requests supply an IP address, hoping to hear a 
corresponding MAC address not from a server, but from the host that uses that IP 
address.

they deﬁne error recovery.

Chapter 6     517
3.
Describe the features required for a protocol to be considered connection oriented.
Answer: Either the protocol must exchange messages with another device before data is 
allowed to be sent, or some pre-established correlation between the two endpoints must 
be deﬁned. TCP is an example of a connection-oriented protocol that exchanges 
messages before data can be sent; Frame Relay is a connection-oriented protocol for 
which a pre-established correlation between endpoints is deﬁned.
4.
In a particular error-recovering protocol, the sender sends three frames, labeled 2, 3, 
and 4. On its next sent frame, the receiver of these frames sets an Acknowledgment ﬁeld 
to 4. What does this typically imply?
Answer: Frames through number 3 were received successfully. The receiver might have 
not received Frame 4, or Frame 4 might not have passed the FCS check.
5.
Name three connection-oriented protocols.
Answer: TCP, SPX, LLC Type 2, and X.25 are some examples of connection-oriented 
protocols that provide error recovery. ATM and Frame Relay are also connection 
oriented, but without error recovery.
6.
Describe how TCP performs error recovery. What role do the routers play?
Answer: TCP numbers the ﬁrst byte in each segment with a sequence number. The 
receiving host uses the Acknowledgment ﬁeld in segments that it sends back to 
acknowledge receipt of the data. If the receiver sends an acknowledgment number that 
is a smaller number than the sender expected, the sender believes that the intervening 
bytes were lost, so the sender resends them. The router plays no role unless the TCP 
connection ends in the router—for example, a Telnet into a router. A full explanation is 
provided in the section “Error Recovery (Reliability).”
7.
How many TCP segments are exchanged to establish a TCP connection? How many are 
required to terminate a TCP connection? 
Answer: A three-way connection-establishment sequence is used, and a four-way 
connection-termination sequence is used.
8.
Describe the purpose of the Port Number ﬁeld in a TCP header. Give one example.
Answer: The port numbers are used to help computers multiplex received data. For 
instance, a PC with two web browsers open can receive an IP packet. The destination 
TCP port number identiﬁes which of the two browsers should receive the data.

or UDP), and the TCP or UDP port number.
10.
How many TCP segments must be sent to establish a TCP connection? How many are 
used with normal TCP connection termination?
Answer: Three TCP segments are needed to establish the connection, and four are 
needed to tear it down under normal operation.
11.
How many UDP segments must be sent to establish a UDP connection? How many are 
used with normal UDP connection termination?
Answer: UDP does not establish connections because it is not connection oriented.

1.
In which of the following modes of the CLI could you conﬁgure a description of 
Ethernet0? 
Answer: E. The description command is an interface subcommand.
2.
In which of the following modes of the CLI could you issue a command to reboot the 
router? 
Answer: B. The reload command is an exec command, so it cannot be issued from any 
conﬁguration mode. User mode does not allow the use of the reload command.
3.
What type of router memory is used to store the conﬁguration used by the router when 
it is up and working? 
Answer: A. The IOS loads the conﬁg from NVRAM into RAM during the boot 
sequence; therefore, the router uses the conﬁguration in RAM for normal operations.
4.
What type of router memory is used to store the operating system used for low-level 
debugging and not for normal operation?
Answer: B. The ROMMON operating system is stored in ROM.
5.
What command copies the conﬁguration from RAM into NVRAM?
Answer: F. The ﬁrst parameter identiﬁes the source of the conﬁg, and the last parameter 
identiﬁes the destination.

Chapter 7     519
6.
What mode prompts the user for basic conﬁguration information?
Answer: D
7.
Which of the following could cause a router to change the IOS that is loaded when the 
router boots?
Answer: D and F. The boot command is a conﬁguration command that identiﬁes the 
source and possibly the name of the IOS to load. The conﬁguration register tells the 
router the source from which to ﬁnd the ﬁle containing the IOS.
8.
Which of the following hexadecimal values in the last nibble of the conﬁguration register 
would cause a router to not look in Flash memory? 
Answer: A and B. A 0 makes the router load ROMMON code; a 1 makes the router load 
the RXBOOT IOS image.
9.
Imagine that you have conﬁgured the enable secret command, followed by the enable 
password command, from the console. You log out of the router and log back in at the 
console. Which command deﬁnes the password that you had to type to access the router 
again from the console?
Answer: C. The password subcommand, under the line console 0 command, sets the 
console password.
10.
Imagine that you have conﬁgured the enable secret command, followed by the enable 
password command, from the console. You log out of the router and log back in at the 
console. Which command deﬁnes the password that you had to type to access privileged 
mode?
Answer: B. If both are conﬁgured, the enable secret password is required to gain access 
to privileged mode.
Q&A
1.
What are the two names for the same CLI mode in a router, that when accessed, enables 
you to issue exec commands that could be disruptive to router operations? 
Answer: Enable mode and privileged mode. Both names are commonly used and are 
found in Cisco documentation.
2.
What are three methods of logging on to a router?
Answer: Console, auxiliary port, and Telnet. All three cause the user to enter user exec 
mode.

520     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes and Q&A Sections
3.
What is the name of the user interface mode of operation used in which you cannot issue 
disruptive commands?
Answer: User exec mode.
4.
Can the auxiliary port be used for anything besides remote modem user access to a 
router? If so, what other purpose can it serve?
Answer: Yes. For direct attachment of a terminal, and dial for the purpose of routing 
packets. Although it originally was created to support remote administration access, 
many customers use an auxiliary port for dial backup, particularly when analog lines are 
desired or when that is all that is available.
5.
What command would you use to receive command help if you knew that a show 
command option begins with a c but you cannot recall the option?
Answer: show c?. Help would appear immediately after you typed the ? symbol. You 
would not need to press Enter after the ?. If you did so, the router would try to execute 
the command with only the parameters that you had typed after the ?.
6.
While you are logged in to a router, you issue the command copy ? and get a response of 
“Unknown command, computer name, or host.” Offer an explanation for why this error 
message appears.
Answer: You were in user mode. You must be in enable/privileged mode to use the 
copy command. When in user mode, the router does not provide help for privileged 
commands, and it treats the request for help as if there is no such command.
7.
Is the number of retrievable commands based on the number of characters in each 
command, or is it simply a number of commands, regardless of their size?
Answer: The number of commands. The length (that is, the number of characters) of 
each command does not affect the command history buffer.
8.
How can you retrieve a previously used command? (Name two ways.)
Answer: Ctrl-p and up arrow (literally the up arrow key on the keyboard). Not all 
terminal emulators support Ctrl-p or the up arrow, so recalling both methods is useful.
9.
After typing show ip route, which is the only command that you typed since logging in 
to the router, you now want to issue the show ip arp command. What steps would you 
take to execute this command by using command-recall keystrokes?
Answer: Press the up arrow, press Backspace ﬁve times, and type arp. The up arrow key 
retrieves the show ip route command. Backspace moves the cursor backward and erases 
the character. Typing inserts the characters into the line.

Chapter 7     521
10.
After typing show ip route 128.1.1.0, you now want to issue the command show ip route 
128.1.4.0. What steps would you take to do so, using command-recall and command-
editing keystrokes?
Answer: Press the up arrow or Ctrl-p, then press Ctrl-b (or the left arrow) twice, and 
press Backspace once; and type 4. The Ctrl-b and left arrow keys back up one character 
in the line, without deleting the character. The Backspace key deletes the 1, in this case. 
And newly typed characters appear where the cursor sits in the command line.
11.
What conﬁguration command causes the router to require a password from a user at the 
console? What conﬁguration mode context must you be in? (That is, what command[s] 
must be typed before this command after entering conﬁguration mode?) List the 
commands in the order in which they must be typed while in conﬁg mode.
lllliiiinnnneeee    ccccoooonnnnssssoooolllleeee    0000
login 
Answer: The line console 0 command is a context-setting command; it adds no 
information to the conﬁguration. The command can be typed from any part of 
conﬁguration mode. The login command, which follows the line console 0 command, 
tells IOS that a password prompt is desired at the console. 
12.
What conﬁguration command is used to tell the router the password that is required at 
the console? What conﬁguration mode context must you be in? (That is, what 
command[s] must you type before this command after entering conﬁguration mode?) 
List the commands in the order in which they must be typed while in conﬁg mode.
lllliiiinnnneeee    ccccoooonnnnssssoooolllleeee    0000
password xxxxxxx
Answer: The password command tells IOS the value that should be typed when a user 
wants access from the console. This value is requested by IOS because of the login 
command. The password xxxxxxx must be typed while in console conﬁguration mode, 
which is reached by typing line console 0.
13.
What are the primary purposes of Flash memory in a Cisco router? 
Answer: To store IOS and microcode ﬁles. In most routers, only IOS is stored in ﬂash. If 
microcode is upgraded, the ﬁles also reside in Flash memory.
14.
What is the intended purpose of NVRAM memory in a Cisco router?
Answer: To store a single conﬁguration ﬁle, used at router load time. NVRAM does not 
support multiple ﬁles.

522     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes and Q&A Sections
15.
What does the NV stand for in NVRAM?
Answer: Nonvolatile. NVRAM is battery powered if it is really RAM. In some routers, 
Cisco has (sneakily) used a small portion of Flash memory for the purpose of NVRAM, 
but Cisco would not ask such trivia on the test.
16.
What is the intended purpose of RAM in a Cisco router?
Answer: RAM is used as IOS working memory (storing such things as routing tables or 
packets) and for IOS code storage. (In some router models, not all IOS is copied into 
RAM. Some of IOS is left in Flash memory so that more RAM is available for working 
memory.) It also holds the currently-in-use conﬁguration ﬁle called running-conﬁg.
17.
What is the main purpose of ROM in a Cisco router? 
Answer: To store a small, limited-function version of IOS and to store bootstrap code. 
Typically, this type of IOS is used only during maintenance or emergencies.
18.
What conﬁguration command would be needed to cause a router to use an IOS image 
named c2500-j-l.112-14.bin on TFTP server 128.1.1.1 when the router is reloaded? If 
you forgot the ﬁrst parameter of this command, what steps must you take to learn the 
correct parameters and add the command to the conﬁguration? (Assume that you are not 
logged in to the router when you start.) 
boot system tftp c2500-j-l.112-14.bin 128.1.1.1
Answer: As for the second part of the question: Log in from con/aux/telnet, type the 
enable command, type the enable password, type the conﬁgure terminal command, and 
type boot ?. Help appears for the ﬁrst parameter of the boot command.
19.
What command sets the password that would be required after typing the enable 
command? Is that password encrypted by default?
Answer: enable password or enable secret. The password in the enable command is not 
encrypted, by default. The enable secret password is encrypted using MD5.
20.
To have the correct syntax, what must you add to the following conﬁguration command? 
banner This is Ivan Denisovich’s Gorno Router--Do Not Use 
Answer: This command does not use a delimiter character at the beginning and end of 
the text. The correct syntax follows:
banner # This is Ivan.... Do Not Use #
Answer: As typed, IOS would think that the letter T was the delimiter character, so the 
banner actually would be “his is Ivan Denisovich’s Gorno Rou”. The motd parameter is 
not shown because it is not required. An alternate correct command would be this: 
banner motd # This is Ivan.... Do Not Use #

Name two commands that affect the text used as the command prompt.
Answer: hostname and prompt.
22.
When using setup mode, you are prompted at the end of the process for whether you 
want to use the conﬁguration parameters that you just typed in. Which type of memory 
is this conﬁguration stored in if you type yes? 
Answer: Both NVRAM and RAM. Setup is the only IOS feature that modiﬁes both the 
active and the startup conﬁguration ﬁles as the result of one action by the user.
23.
What two methods could a router administrator use to cause a router to load IOS stored 
in ROM? 
Answer: Setting the conﬁguration register boot ﬁeld to binary 0001, or adding boot 
system rom to the conﬁguration ﬁle and copying it to the startup conﬁguration ﬁle. To 
set the conﬁguration register to hex 2101, which would yield binary 0001 in the boot 
ﬁeld, the conﬁg-register 0x2101 global conﬁguration command would be used. A third 
method, not mentioned in the chapter, includes removing the Flash memory in a router 
and then reloading.
24.
What is the process used to update the contents of Flash memory so that a new IOS in a 
ﬁle called c4500-d-mz.120-5.bin on TFTP server 128.1.1.1 is copied into Flash memory? 
Answer: copy tftp ﬂash. The other details—namely, the IP address of the TFTP server 
and the ﬁlename—are requested through prompts to the user.
25.
Name three possible problems that could prevent the command boot system tftp c2500-
j-l.112-14.bin 128.1.1.1 from succeeding. 
Answer: The possible reasons include: 128.1.1.1 is not accessible through the network, there 
is no TFTP server on 128.1.1.1, the ﬁle is not in the TFTP default directory, the ﬁle is 
corrupted, a different boot command could precede this boot command in the conﬁguration 
ﬁle, meaning that the IOS referenced in the ﬁrst boot command would be used instead.
26.
Two different IOS ﬁles are in a router’s Flash memory: one called c2500-j-l.111-3.bin 
and one called c2500-j-l.112-14.bin. Which one does the router use when it boots up? 
How could you force the other IOS ﬁle to be used? Without looking at the router 
conﬁguration, what command could be used to discover which ﬁle was used for the latest 
boot of the router?
Answer: The ﬁrst IOS ﬁle listed in the show ﬂash command is the one used at reload 
time, unless a boot system command is conﬁgured. The conﬁguration command boot 
system ﬂash c2500-j-l.112-14.bin would override the IOS’s decision to look for ﬁles in 
order in Flash memory. show version is the command used to display the ﬁlename of IOS 

524     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes and Q&A Sections
for the latest reload of a router. The show version output tells you the version as well as 
the name of the ﬁle that was used at last reload time. It is particularly difﬁcult to ﬁnd in 
the output of the command.
27.
Is the password required at the console the same one that is required when Telnet is used 
to access a router?
Answer: No. The Telnet (virtual terminal) password is not the same password, although 
many installations use the same value.
28.
Which IP routing protocols could be enabled using setup?
Answer: RIP and IGRP.
29.
Name two commands used to view the conﬁguration to be used at the next reload of the 
router. Which one is a more recent addition to IOS?
Answer: show conﬁg and show startup-conﬁg. show startup-conﬁg is the newer one and, 
hopefully, is easier to remember.
30.
Name two commands used to view the conﬁguration that currently is used in a router. 
Which one is a more recent addition to IOS?
Answer: write terminal and show running-conﬁg. show running-conﬁg is the newer 
command and, hopefully, is easier to remember.
31.
True or false: The copy startup-conﬁg running-conﬁg command always changes the 
currently used conﬁguration for this router to exactly match what is in the startup 
conﬁguration ﬁle. Explain.
Answer: False. Some conﬁguration commands do not replace an existing command but 
simply are added to a list of related commands. If such a list exists, the copy startup-
conﬁg running-conﬁg command simply adds those to the end of the list. Many of these 
lists in a router conﬁguration are order dependent.

Imagine a network with three switches, each with an Ethernet segment connecting it to 
the other two switches. Each switch has some PCs attached to it as well. Which of the 
following frames would cause loops if the Spanning Tree Protocol were not running? 
Answer: A and C. Without STP, any frame that a switch would forward out all ports 
would loop for an indeﬁnitely long period of time. Switches always forward broadcasts 
out all ports. Likewise, unicast frames to MAC addresses that are not in the MAC 
address table are ﬂooded out all ports.

Q&A
1.
Name two of the methods of internal switching on typical switches today. Which 
provides less latency for an individual frame? 
Answer: Store-and-forward, cut-through, and Fragment Free switching. Cut-through 
switching has less latency per frame but does not check for bit errors in the frame, 
including errors caused by collisions. Store-and-forward switching stores the entire 
received frame, veriﬁes that the FCS is correct, and then sends the frame. Cut-through 
switching sends out the ﬁrst bytes of the frame before the last bytes of the incoming 
frame have been received. Fragment Free switching is similar to cut-through switching 
in that the frame can be sent before the incoming frame is totally received; however, 
Fragment Free processing waits to receive the ﬁrst 64 bytes, to ensure no collisions, 
before beginning to forward the frame.
2.
Describe how a transparent bridge decides whether it should forward a frame, and tell 
how it chooses the output interface.
Answer: The bridge examines the destination MAC address of a frame and looks for the 
address in its bridge (or address) table. If found, the matching entry tells the bridge 
which output interface to use to forward the frame. If not found, the bridge forwards 
the frame out all other interfaces (except for interfaces blocked by spanning tree and the 
interface in which the frame was received). The bridge table is built by examining 
incoming frames’ source MAC addresses.
3.
Deﬁne the term collision domain.
Answer: A collision domain is a set of Ethernet devices for which concurrent 
transmission of a frame by any two of them will result in a collision. Bridges, switches, 
and routers separate LAN segments into different collision domains. Repeaters and 
shared hubs do not separate segments into different collision domains.
4.
Name two beneﬁts of LAN segmentation using transparent bridges.
Answer: The main beneﬁts are reduced collisions and more cumulative bandwidth. 
Multiple 10- or 100- Mbps Ethernet segments are created, and unicasts between devices 
on the same segment are not forwarded by the bridge, which reduces overhead. Because 
frames can be sent over each segment at the same time, it increases the overall bandwidth 
available in the network.
5.
What routing protocol does a transparent bridge use to learn about Layer 3 addressing 
groupings?
Answer: None. Bridges do not use routing protocols. Transparent bridges do not care 
about Layer 3 address groupings. Devices on either side of a transparent bridge are in 
the same Layer 3 group—in other words, the same IP subnet or IPX network.

If a Fast Ethernet NIC currently is receiving a frame, can it begin sending a frame?
Answer: Yes, if the NIC is operating in full-duplex mode.
7.
Why did Ethernet networks’ performance improve with the advent of bridges?
Answer: Before bridges and switches existed, all devices were cabled to the same shared 
Ethernet. The CSMA/CD algorithm was used to determine who got to send across the 
Ethernet. As the amount of trafﬁc increased, collisions and waiting (because CSMA/ 
CD) increased, so frames took longer to send. Bridges separated the network into 
multiple collision domains, reducing collisions and allowing devices on opposite sides of 
the bridge to send concurrently.

What are two key differences between a 10-Mbps NIC and a 10/100 NIC?
Answer: The obvious beneﬁt is that the 10/100 NIC can run at 100 Mbps. The other 
beneﬁt is that 10/100 NICs can autonegotiate both speed and duplex between 
themselves and the device that they are cabled to—typically a LAN switch.

Assume that a building has 100 devices attached to the same Ethernet. These users then 
are migrated onto two separate shared Ethernet segments, each with 50 devices, with a 
transparent bridge between them. List two beneﬁts that would be derived for a typical 
user. 
Answer: Fewer collisions due to having two collision domains. Also, less waiting should 
occur because twice as much capacity exists.

Assume that a building has 100 devices attached to the same Ethernet. These devices are 
migrated to two different shared Ethernet segments, each with 50 devices. The two 
segments are connected to a Cisco LAN switch to allow communication between the two 
sets of users. List two beneﬁts that would be derived for a typical user.
Answer: Two switch ports are used, which reduces the possibility of collisions. Also, 
each segment has its own 10- or 100-Mbps capacity, allowing more throughput and 
reducing the likelihood of collisions. Furthermore,  some Cisco switches can reduce the 
ﬂow of multicasts using the Cisco Group Message Protocol (CGMP) and IGMP 
snooping.

How fast is Fast Ethernet?
Answer: 100 million bits per second (100 Mbps).
13.
How does a transparent bridge build its address table?
Answer: The bridge listens for incoming frames and examines the source MAC address. 
If it is not in the table, the source address is added, along with the port (interface) by 
which the frame entered the bridge. The bridge also marks an entry for freshness so that 
entries can be removed after a period of disuse. This reduces table size and allows for 
easier table changes in case a spanning tree change forces more signiﬁcant changes in the 
bridge (address) table.
14.
How many bytes long is a MAC address?
Answer: 6 bytes long, or 48 bits.
15.
Does a bridge or switch examine just the incoming frame’s source MAC, the destination 
MAC, or both? Why does it examine the one(s) that it examines?
Answer: The bridge or switch examines both MAC addresses. The source is examined 
so that entries can be added to the bridge/address table. The destination address is 
examined to determine the interface out which to forward the frame. Table lookup is 
required for both addresses for any frame that enters an interface. That is one of the 
reasons that LAN switches, which have a much larger number of interfaces than 
traditional bridges, need to have optimized hardware and logic to perform table lookup 
quickly.
16.
Deﬁne the term broadcast domain.
Answer: A broadcast domain is a set of Ethernet devices for which a broadcast sent by 
any one of them should be received by all others in the group. Unlike routers, bridges 
and switches do not stop the ﬂow of broadcasts. Two segments separated by a router 
each would be in different broadcast domains. A switch can create multiple broadcast 
domains by creating multiple VLANs, but a router must be used to route packets 
between the VLANs.

Chapter 9     533
17.
Describe the beneﬁts of creating 3 VLANs of 25 ports each, versus a single VLAN of 75 
ports, in each case using a single switch. Assume that all ports are switched ports (each 
port is a different collision domain).
Answer: Three different broadcast domains are created with three VLANs, so the 
devices’ CPU utilization should decrease because of decreased broadcast trafﬁc. Trafﬁc 
between devices in different VLANs will pass through some routing function, which can 
add some latency for those packets. Better management and control are gained by 
including a router in the path for those packets.
18.
Explain the function of the loopback and collision-detection features of an Ethernet NIC 
in relation to half-duplex and full-duplex operations.
Answer: The loopback feature copies the transmitted frame back onto the receive pin on 
the NIC interface. The collision-detection logic compares the received frame to the 
transmitted frame during transmission; if the signals do not match, a collision is 
occurring. With full-duplex operation, collisions cannot occur, so the loopback and 
collision-detection features are purposefully disabled, and concurrent transmission and 
reception is allowed.
19.
Describe the beneﬁt of the Spanning Tree Protocol as used by transparent bridges and 
switches.
Answer: Physically redundant paths in the network are allowed to exist and be used 
when other paths fail. Also, loops in the bridged network are avoided. Loops are 
particularly bad because bridging uses LAN headers, which do not provide a mechanism 
to mark a frame so that its lifetime can be limited; in other words, the frame can loop 
forever.
20.
Name the three reasons why a port is placed in forwarding state as a result of spanning 
tree.
Answer: First, all ports on the root bridge are placed in forwarding state. Second, one 
port on each bridge is considered its root port, which is placed in forwarding state. 
Finally, on each LAN segment, one bridge is considered to be the designated bridge on 
that LAN; that designated bridge’s interface on the LAN is placed in a forwarding state.

21.
Name the three interface states that the Spanning Tree Protocol uses other than 
forwarding. Which of these states is transitory?
Answer: Blocking, Layer 2 listening, and learning. Blocking is the only stable state; the 
other two are transitory between blocking and forwarding.

Answer: B. By deﬁnition, a VLAN includes all devices in the same LAN broadcast 
domain.
2.
Imagine a switch with three conﬁgured VLANs. How many IP subnets would be 
required, assuming that all hosts in all VLANs want to use TCP/IP? 
Answer: D. The hosts in each VLAN must be in different subnets.
3.
Which of the following fully encapsulates the original Ethernet frame in a trunking 
header?
Answer: B. ISL fully encapsulates the original frame, whereas 802.1q simply adds an 
additional header inside the original Ethernet frame.

5.
Imagine a Layer 2 switch with three conﬁgured VLANs, using an external router for 
inter-VLAN trafﬁc. What is the least number of router Fast Ethernet interfaces required 
to forward trafﬁc between VLANs? 
Answer: B. You can use one Fast Ethernet interface and use trunking between the router 
and the switch. A router is required to forward trafﬁc between the VLANs.

Chapter 10     535
6.
Which of the following terms refers to a function that can forward trafﬁc between two 
different VLANs?
Answer: B and C. Layer 2 switching forwards frames only inside a single VLAN. Layer 
3 switching and Layer 4 switching forward trafﬁc between VLANs, either based on the 
Layer 3 destination address (Layer 3 switching) or the Layer 4 port numbers (Layer 4 
switching).
7.
Imagine a small campus network with three VLANs spread across two switches. Which 
of the following would you expect to also have a quantity of 3? 
Answer: B and C. By deﬁnition, a VLAN is a set of devices in the same broadcast 
domain. An IP subnet on a LAN is typically comprised of devices in the same VLAN.
8.
Which of the following are considered to be ways of conﬁguring VLANs?
Answer: A and B. 
Q&A
1.
Deﬁne the term collision domain.
Answer: A collision domain is a set of Ethernet devices for which concurrent 
transmission of a frame by any two of them will result in a collision. Bridges, switches, 
and routers separate LAN segments into different collision domains. Repeaters and 
shared hubs do not separate segments into different collision domains.
2.
Deﬁne the term broadcast domain.
Answer: A broadcast domain is a set of Ethernet devices for which a broadcast sent by 
any one of them should be received by all others in the group. Unlike routers, bridges 
and switches do not stop the ﬂow of broadcasts. Two segments separated by a router 
would each be in a different broadcast domain. A switch can create multiple broadcast 
domains by creating multiple VLANs, but a router must be used to route packets 
between the VLANs.
3.
Deﬁne the term VLAN.
Answer: Virtual LAN (VLAN) refers to the process of treating one subset of a switch’s 
interfaces as one broadcast domain. Broadcasts from one VLAN are not forwarded to 
other VLANs; unicasts between VLANs must use a router. Advanced methods, such as 
Layer 3 switching, can be used to allow the LAN switch to forward trafﬁc between 
VLANs without each individual frame being routed by a router.

4.
If two Cisco LAN switches are connected using Fast Ethernet, what VLAN trunking 
protocols could be used? If only one VLAN spanned both switches, is a VLAN trunking 
protocol needed?
Answer: ISL and 802.1q are the trunking protocols used by Cisco over Fast Ethernet. If 
only one VLAN spans the two switches, a trunking protocol is not needed. Trunking or 
tagging protocols are used to tag a frame as being in a particular VLAN; if only one 
VLAN is used, tagging is unnecessary.
5.
Must all members of the same VLAN be in the same collision domain, the same 
broadcast domain, or both?
Answer: By deﬁnition, members of the same VLAN are all part of the same broadcast 
domain. They might all be in the same collision domain, but only if all devices in the 
VLAN are connected to hubs.
6.
What is the acronym and complete name of Cisco’s proprietary trunking protocol over 
Ethernet?
Answer: Inter-Switch Link (ISL).
7.
Consider the phrase “A VLAN is a broadcast domain is an IP subnet.” Do you agree or 
disagree? State your reasons.
Answer: From one perspective, the statement is false because an IP subnet is a Layer 3 
protocol concept, and a broadcast domain and VLAN are Layer 2 concepts. However, 
the devices in one broadcast domain comprise the exact same set of devices that would 
be in the same VLAN and in the same IP subnet.
8.
What ﬁelds are added or changed in an Ethernet header when using 802.1q? Where is 
the VLAN ID in those ﬁelds?
Answer: A new 4-byte 802.1q header, which includes the VLAN ID, is added after the 
source MAC address ﬁeld. The original FCS ﬁeld in the Ethernet trailer is modiﬁed 
because the value must be recalculated as a result of changing the header.
9.
Compare and contrast the use of a Layer 3 switch versus an external router connected 
to a Layer 2 switch using a trunk for forwarding between VLANs.
Answer: Functionally, the end result of each process is identical. However, L3 switches 
optimize the internal processing of the switch, using a very fast forwarding path, 
typically using ASICs. The end result is that L3 switches forward trafﬁc between VLANs 
at much higher speeds than do externally attached routers.

Chapter 11     537
10.
Compare and contrast a Layer 3 switch with a multilayer switch. Describe in what cases 
the terms could be used synonymously.
Answer: A Layer 3 switch forwards packets based on their destination IP address, much 
like a router, but with the forwarding logic performed quickly inside hardware in the 
switch. A multilayer switch performs switching at multiple layers. Many Layer 3 
switches also perform Layer 2 switching for frames destined to another device in the 
same VLAN, and Layer 3 switching for packets destined to another subnet/VLAN. The 
terms are often used synonymously because many people assume that a LAN switch can 
always perform L2 switching, with L3 switching being an additional function.

Which of the following IEEE standards deﬁne framing used when transmitting wireless 
LAN trafﬁc? 
Answer: A and D. Wireless LANs use the IEEE 802.11 standard instead of 802.3 for the 
MAC sublayer header, and also use IEEE 802.2 for the LLC sublayer header.
Q&A
1.
Describe why a 10BASE-T network using a hub is considered to be a logical bus 
topology.
Answer: A physical bus causes the transmitted electrical signal to be propagated to all 
devices connected to the bus. A 10BASE-T hub repeats a signal entering one port out all 
the other ports, ensuring that all devices receive the same signal. Hubs do not have any 
logic to prevent some frames from being sent out ports (all signals are repeated), creating 
a single collision domain, just like a physical bus.
2.
Compare and contrast full-mesh versus partial-mesh topologies, in relation to physical 
topologies.
Answer: In a full mesh, for a particular set of networking devices, a direct cable connects 
each pair of devices. For a partial mesh, some pairs of devices are not directly connected.
3.
Compare and contrast full-mesh versus partial-mesh topologies, in relation to logical 
topologies.
Answer: Regardless of the physical topology, a topology is considered a logical full mesh 
if each pair of devices can communicate directly, and is considered a partial mesh if some 
pairs cannot communicate directly. A Frame Relay network uses a star physical 
topology. Depending on what VCs have been deﬁned, it might use a logical full mesh or 
a logical partial mesh.
4.
What is the main motivation for using a dual-ring physical topology versus a single ring? 
Why?
Answer: For better network availability. With dual rings, if a cable or a device fails, the 
devices near the failure can loop the signals from the two different cables together, 
thereby creating a single phyiscal path that loops to each node.

Chapter 11     539
5.
What two methods are used to reduce the amount of electromagnetic emissions 
emanating from copper Ethernet cabling? Why do they help reduce emissions?
Answer: By using two pairs of wires for transmission, with differing currents, and 
twisting the wires, the magnetic ﬁelds generated when the electrical current ﬂows are 
cancelled. The other method is to put insulating material around the wires, which shields 
the emissions to a great degree.
6.
Which wires are used by a typical Ethernet CAT5 cable? Which ones are used for 
transmit, and which ones are used to receive, by an Ethernet card?
Answer: Ethernet cards transmit on the pair using pins 1 and 2, and receive on the pair 
at pins 3 and 6.
7.
Which TIA standards for UTP cabling support 10BASE-T?
Answer: CAT3, 5, 5e, and 6.
8.
What are the maximum lengths for coaxial cables as used by 10BASE5? 10BASE2?
Answer: 500 m and 185 m, respectively.
9.
What are key differences between multimode and single-mode optical cabling?
Answer: Multimode cabling typically supports shorter distances than single-mode. 
Single-mode uses a much smaller diameter for the glass ﬁber, which allows for the greater 
distances.
10.
What types of cabling are least susceptible to having someone eavesdrop and somehow 
discover what is being transmitted over the cable?
Answer: Optical cables do not emit any EM radiation outside the cable, as do metallic 
copper cables. So, you cannot simply sense what signal is crossing over an optical cable 
without physically breaking into the cable, which makes the cable unusable.
11.
What are the IEEE standards for 10BASE-T, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10-
Gigabit Ethernet?
Answer: 802.3, 802.3u (Fast Ethernet), 802.3z and 802.3ab (Gigabit Ethernet), and 
802.3ae (10 Gigabit).

Answer: All of them.
14.
What were some of the differences between 10-Gigabit Ethernet, as compared with other 
types of Ethernet, as outlined in this chapter? 
Answer: The speed, of course, is the obvious difference. Additionally, 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet is allowed to be used in a point-to-point topology only, it supports full-duplex 
only, and today it supports only optical cabling.
15.
What IEEE standards are used by an 802.11 access point? 
Answer: The access point uses 802.11 standards for communication across the wireless 
LAN, including 802.2 LLC. It also connects to a wired LAN, so it uses 802.3 for its 
wired Ethernet.
16.

7.
Which of the following subnet masks would allow a Class B network to allow subnets 
to have up to 150 hosts and allow for up to 164 subnets?
Answer: C. You need 8 bits to number up to 150 hosts because 27 – 2 is less than 150, 
but 28 – 2 is greater than 150. Similarly, you need 8 subnet bits. The only valid Class B 
subnet mask with 8 host and 8 subnet bits is 255.255.255.0.
8.
Which of the following subnet masks would allow a Class A network to allow subnets 
to have up to 150 hosts and would allow for up to 164 subnets?
Answer: B. You need 8 host bits and 8 subnet bits. Because the mask is used with a class 
A network, any mask with the entire second octet as part of the subnet ﬁeld and with 
the entire fourth octet as part of the host ﬁeld meets the requirement.

Q&A
1.
Name the parts of an IP address.
Answer: Network, subnet, and host are the three parts of an IP address. However, many 
people commonly treat the network and subnet parts of an address as a single part, 
leaving only two parts, the subnet and host parts. On the exam, the multiple-choice 
format should provide extra clues as to which terminology is used. 
2.
Deﬁne the term subnet mask. What do the bits in the mask whose values are binary 0 
tell you about the corresponding IP address(es)?
Answer: A subnet mask deﬁnes the number of host bits in an address. The bits of value 
0 deﬁne which bits in the address are host bits. The mask is an important ingredient in 
the formula to dissect an IP address; along with knowledge of the number of network 
bits implied for Class A, B, and C networks, the mask provides a clear deﬁnition of the 
size of the network, subnet, and host parts of an address.

Given the IP address 220.8.7.100 and the mask 255.255.255.240, what are all the 
subnet numbers if the same (static) mask is used for all subnets in this network?
Answer: The answer is not as obvious in this question. The Class C network number is 
220.8.7.0. The mask implies that bits 25 through 28, which are the ﬁrst 4 bits in the 
fourth octet, comprise the subnet ﬁeld. The answer is 220.8.7.16, 220.8.7.32, 
220.8.7.48, and so on, through 220.8.7.224. 220.8.7.0 is the zero subnet, and 
220.8.7.240 is the broadcast subnet. The following table outlines the easy decimal 
algorithm to ﬁgure out the subnet numbers.

How many IP addresses could be assigned in each subnet of 220.8.7.0, assuming that a 
mask of 255.255.255.240 is used? If the same (static) mask is used for all subnets, how 
many subnets are there? 
Answer: There will be 2hostbits, or 24 hosts per subnet, minus two special cases. The 
number of subnets will be 2subnetbits, or 24, minus two special cases.

You design a network for a customer, and the customer insists that you use the same 
subnet mask on every subnet. The customer will use network 10.0.0.0 and needs 200 
subnets, each with 200 hosts maximum. What subnet mask would you use to allow the 
largest amount of growth in subnets? Which mask would work and would allow for the 
most growth in the number of hosts per subnet?
Answer: Network 10.0.0.0 is a Class A network, so you have 24 host bits with no 
subnetting. To number 200 subnets, you will need at least 8 subnet bits because 28 is 
256. Likewise, to number 200 hosts per subnet, you will need 8 host bits. So, you need 
to pick a mask with at least 8 subnet bits and 8 host bits. 255.255.0.0 is a mask with 8 
subnet bits and 16 host bits. That would allow for the 200 subnets and 200 hosts, while 
allowing the number of hosts per subnet to grow to 216 – 2, quite a large number. 
Similarly, a mask of 255.255.255.0 gives you 16 subnet bits, allowing 216 – 2 subnets, 
each with 28 – 2 hosts per subnet.

Answer: Router A’s Ethernet interface and Fred’s Ethernet should be in the same subnet, 
but they are not. Fred’s conﬁguration implies a subnet with IP addresses ranging from 
10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.62; Router A’s Ethernet conﬁguration implies a subnet with 
addresses between 10.1.1.65 and 10.1.1.126. Also, Router A’s two interfaces must be in 
different subnets; as conﬁgured, they would be in the same subnet. So, the solution is to 
change Router A’s Ethernet IP address to something between 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.62, 
making it be in the same subnet as Fred.
21.
Referring to Figure A-1, Fred has been conﬁgured with IP address 10.1.1.1, mask 
255.255.255.0; Router A’s Ethernet has been conﬁgured with 10.1.1.100, mask 
255.255.255.224; Router A’s serial interface uses 10.1.1.129, mask 255.255.255.252; 
Router B’s serial uses 10.1.1.130, mask 255.255.255.252; Router B’s Ethernet uses 
10.1.1.200, mask 255.255.255.224; and the web server uses 10.1.1.201, mask 
255.255.255.224. Is anything wrong with this network? What is the easiest thing that 
could be done to ﬁx it? You can assume any working interior routing protocol.
Answer: Fred’s conﬁguration implies a subnet with a range of addresses from 10.1.1.1 
through 10.1.1.254, so he thinks that Router A’s Ethernet interface is in the same subnet. 
However, Router A’s conﬁguration implies a subnet with addresses from 10.1.1.97 
through 10.1.1.126, so Router A does not think that Fred is on the same subnet as 
Router A’s Ethernet. Several options exist for ﬁxing the problem. You could change the 
mask used by Fred and Router A’s Ethernet to 255.255.255.128, which makes them 
both reside in the same subnet. 
22.
Referring to Figure A-1, Fred has been conﬁgured with IP address 10.1.1.1, mask 
255.255.255.240; Router A’s Ethernet has been conﬁgured with 10.1.1.2, 
mask 255.255.255.240; Router A’s Serial interface uses 10.1.1.129, mask 
255.255.255.252; Router B’s serial uses 10.1.1.130, mask 255.255.255.252; Router B’s 
Ethernet uses 10.1.1.200, mask 255.255.255.128; and the web server uses 10.1.1.201, 
mask 255.255.255.128. Is anything wrong with this network? What is the easiest thing 
that could be done to ﬁx it? You can assume any working interior routing protocol.
Answer: Router B’s conﬁguration implies a subnet with a range of addresses from 
10.1.1.129 to 10.1.1.130 on the serial link, and 10.1.1.129 to 10.1.1.254 on the 
Ethernet. So, the subnets overlap. One solution would be to conﬁgure Router B and the 
web server’s masks to 255.255.255.192, which would change the subnet so that the 
valid addresses would be between 10.1.1.193 and 10.1.1.254.

Answer: 128 bits long.
25.
How does CIDR help reduce the size of Internet routing tables? 
Answer: By using a routing protocol that exchanges the mask as well as the subnet/
network number, a classless view of the number can be attained. By advertising 
many networks as a single route, the routing table can be shortened. For instance, 
198.0.0.0/8 (198.0.0.0, mask 255.0.0.0) deﬁnes a set of addresses whose ﬁrst 8 bits are 
equal to decimal 198. Instead of the more than 65,000 routes needed to list a route for 
each class C network that starts with 198, CIDR allows those routes to be represented 
by a single route.

Imagine that a PC is attached to the same Ethernet as a router. The PC makes a DNS 
request for host name Fred, and the PC gets a reply showing IP address 10.1.1.1. What 
command could be issued on the router to list the information learned in that DNS 
request and reply?
Answer: D. The show hosts command lists the host name conﬁgured in the router or 
names learned by the router from the DNS as a result of a command on the router using 
the name. The router does not learn about names as a result of DNS requests from an 
end user.

ip address 8.0.3.1 255.255.255.0 
Answer: The zero subnet was not used in this solution. If desired, the ip subnet-zero 
global command could have been used, enabling subnet 8.0.0.0/24 as well as subnets 
8.0.1.0/24 and 8.0.2.0/24 to be used as the three subnets in the conﬁguration.
2.
In the previous question, what would be the IP subnet of the link attached to serial 0? If 
another user wanted to answer the same question but did not have the enable password, 
what command(s) might provide this router’s addresses and subnets?
Answer: The attached subnet is 8.0.2.0, 255.255.255.0. The show interface, show ip 
interface, and show ip interface brief commands would supply this information, as 
would show ip route. The show ip route command would show the actual subnet 
number instead of the address of the interface.
3.
What must be done to make the output of the show ip route command list subnet masks 
in decimal format instead of preﬁxes? In what mode would you use the command?
Answer: You must use the terminal ip netmask-format decimal command in enable 
mode.
4.
What are the differences between the clock rate and bandwidth commands?
Answer: clock rate sets the physical (Layer 1) actual transmission rate, in bits per second, 
and only when a DCE cable has been plugged into that interface. The bandwidth 
command, with units of kbps, does not affect Layer 1 transmission rates. Instead, it is 
used by Cisco IOS Software as its understanding of the Layer 1 rate, for purposes such 
as calculation of routing protocol metrics.
5.
Compare and contrast the commands used to set the enable, console, and telnet 
passwords on a router.
Answer: The password command sets the console and telnet password. When used as a 
line console 0 subcommand, it sets the console password; under line vty 0 4, it sets the 
telnet password. The enable password can be set with the enable password or enable 
secret commands, with the enable secret password taking precedence if both are 
conﬁgured.

In the output of show ip route, when a C shows up in the left side of the output on a line 
for a particular route, what does that mean?
Answer: C means “connected.” This means that the route was learned by this router 
because it has an operational interface that is connected directly to that subnet.
7.
Deﬁne the term preﬁx notation. Give two examples.
Answer: The representation of a subnet mask with a slash character (/), followed by a 
number that represents the number of binary 1s in the mask. For example, /16 means 
the same thing as 255.255.0.0, and /22 means the same thing as 255.255.252.0.

R1, what commands could be used to ﬁnd the IP addresses of Router2 and Switch1 
without logging in to either device? 

Chapter 14     555
Answer: On Router1, you could use either the show cdp neighbor detail command or 
the show cdp entry command. Both commands list IP addresses of the neighboring 
devices, assuming that CDP is up and working.

quickly?
Answer: EIGRP, OSPF, and Integrated IS-IS.
4.
Compare distance vector and link-state protocols in terms of what information is sent in 
routing updates.
Answer: Distance vector protocols send sparse information, typically describing a subnet 
and a metric for each route. Link-state protocols send much more detailed topology 
information, describing each router and each link so that every router knows a full 
conceptual picture of the network.
5.
List three similarities between EIGRP’s balanced hybrid logic and link-state logic.
Answer: Fast convergence, neighbor discovery before sending routing information, not 
sending of full updates on a regular period, some topology tables built in addition to the 
IP routing table.

Chapter 14     557
6.
Explain the basic concept behind why some routing protocols support VLSM and some 
do not.
Answer: VLSM implies that different subnet masks are used for different subnets of the 
same network. To advertise subnets that have different sizes, the routing protocol must 
include the subnet mask information for each subnet in the routing updates. Routing 
protocols that do not support VLSM do not include the mask in the routing updates.
7.
Explain the difference between interior and exterior routing protocols.
Answer: Interior routing protocols are designed to advertise detailed routing 
information about each subnet, typically inside a single company or organization. 
Exterior routing protocols are designed to advertise information about how to reach 
different organizations’ networks through the Internet, and they purposefully try to 
reduce the detailed routing information to reduce the number of routes in Internet 
routers’ routing tables.
8.
Explain the difference between full and partial routing updates.
Answer: Full routing updates include information about each subnet during each update 
interval. Partial updates just include changed routes, such as newly learned subnets and 
subnets whose routes have failed.
9.
Deﬁne the term balanced hybrid in relation to the terms distance vector and link state.
Answer: Balanced hybrid is a term used to refer to the logic used by EIGRP. The logic 
can be viewed as a combination of features like those of distance vector protocols and 
link-state protocols.
10.
Compare and contrast the types of information sent in distance vector routing updates 
versus link-state routing updates.
Answer: Distance vector routing updates contain a subnet number and a metric for each 
route. Link-state updates deﬁne much more detailed information, such as the identity of 
each router and which subnets each router is connected to. Therefore, the information 
in link-state updates is much more detailed than the equivalent information with 
distance vector updates. The more detailed information allows a link-state protocol to 
build a mathematical representation of the network topology, whereas distance vector 
protocols simply know that subnets exist and where to send packets to reach those 
subnets.
11.
What term describes the underlying logic behind the OSPF routing protocol?
Answer: Link state.

signals into a 64-kbps digital data stream? 
Answer: D
2.
How many DS0 channels are in a DS1 in the United States? 
Answer: E
3.
Which of the following best describes the function of demodulation by a modem? 
Answer: D. Modems demodulate an analog signal sent by the phone company. The goal 
is to re-create the original bits sent by the other modem, so the demodulation function 
converts the analog signal into the bits that it was intended to represent.
4.
Which of the following modem standards do not support 56-kbps speeds downstream?
Answer: A, B, C, F, G, and H
5.
Which of the following terms best describes features of an ISDN PRI in Europe?
Answer: E. PRIs in Europe are based on E1 circuits, which have 32 DS0 channels. One 
channel is reserved for framing, and one channel is used for a D channel, leaving 30 B 
channels.
6.
Imagine that you plug an analog phone into an ISDN modem and call a friend at her 
house, where she uses an analog phone using plain-old telephone service (POTS). At 
which of the following points in a network will a voice codec be used?
Answer: B and D. Because the ISDN modem sends only digital signals over the local 
loop, it must convert the analog voice from the phone connected to it into digital voice 
using a voice codec. 
7.
What does the letter B stand for in the ISDN term B channel?
Answer: A
8.
Which of the following DSL standards has a limit of 18,000 feet for the length of the 
local loop?
Answer: C

Chapter 15     559
9.
Imagine a local phone line from a house to a local telco CO. When the customer at that 
house requests DSL service, what type of device does the telco move the CO end of the 
local line to?
Answer: A. The CO uses a DSLAM to terminate local loops that use DSL. A DSL router 
or DSL modem is connected to the local loop at the subscriber (home) location.
10.
Which of the following protocols are used by DSL modem and routers for data link layer 
functions? 
Answer: A, B, and C. DSL calls for the use of PPP over ATM (PPPoA) over the DSL part 
of the network. PPP can extend to the PCs at the home location using PPP over Ethernet 
(PPPoE).
11.
Which of the following protocols is used by cable modems for data link layer functions?
Answer: E. Multimedia Cable Network Services (MCNS) deﬁnes a MAC layer that also 
uses IEEE 802.2 as part of the data link layer.
12.
Which of the following protocols are used by a cable modem for the upstream data?
Answer: B and E
13.
Which of the following remote access technologies uses ATM, Ethernet, and PPP as data-
link protocols? 
Answer: C
14.
Which of the following remote access technologies support speciﬁcations that allow both 
symmetric speeds and asymmetric speeds?

asymmetric speeds.
15.
Which of the following remote access technologies, when used to connect to an ISP, is 
considered to be an “always on” service? 
Answer: C and D. Analog modems and ISDN lines must signal or dial to set up a circuit 
before any data can be passed, whereas DSL and cable modems do not do this.
Q&A
1.
What do ISDN, BRI, and PRI stand for?
Answer: ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital Network. BRI stands for Basic Rate 
Interface. PRI stands for Primary Rate Interface.

2.
How many bearer channels are in a BRI? What about a PRI in North America? What 
about a PRI in Europe?
Answer: BRI uses two bearer channels and one signaling channel (2B+D). PRI uses 
23B+D in North America and 30B+D in Europe. The signaling channel on BRI is a 16-
kbps channel; on PRI, it is a 64-kbps channel.
3.
Deﬁne what a voice codec does, and explain why a PCM codec needs 64 kbps for a single 
voice call.
Answer: Voice codecs code and decode voice signals, converting from analog to digital, 
and digital to analog. A PCM codec samples the analog signal 8000 times per second, 
generating an 8-bit code to represent each sample. So, 64,000 bits are needed for a single 
second of voice.
4.
Two terms were shortened and combined to ﬁrst create the word modem. Identify those 
two words and describe what each word means.
Answer: The term modem is formed as a combination of the words modulation and 
demodulation. Modulation means to vary or change a wave form to encode information. 
A modem varies an analog electrical signal to encode information, representing binary 
digits, onto an analog signal. Modulation refers to the creation of the analog signal 
based on a string of bits, and demodulation simply refers to a modem performing the 
reverse process upon receiving the analog signal.
5.
Deﬁne what the terms symmetric and asymmetric mean in relation to modem 
speciﬁcations. Also explain why asymmetric might be a better option.
Answer: Symmetric means that the speed in each direction of ﬂow is the same, whereas 
asymmetric means that the speed in one direction is faster than the other. Asymmetric 
speeds might be a good choice because typical trafﬁc ﬂows require a much greater 
amount of data to ﬂow in one direction, typically from a server to a client. Asymmetric 
speeds allow the speed in one direction to be faster than it could be with symmetric 
speeds, accommodating the need for more bandwidth in one direction.
6.
Compare the V.90 and V.92 modem speciﬁcations.
Answer: Based on this chapter, V.92 is an improvement over the V.90 standard. V.92 
supports symmetric and asymmetric speeds, whereas V.90 supports only asymmetric 
speeds. The upstream speed has been increased from 33 kbps up to 48 kbps.  It supports 
modem-on-hold, which allows the user to accept a voice call in response to a call-waiting 
signal, putting the modem connection on hold. It also senses the correct operational 
speed more quickly than V.90.

7.
Compare analog modems, ISDN BRIs, DSL, and cable modems in terms of concurrent 
support for voice and data.
Answer: Analog modems do not support concurrent voice and data transmission. ISDN 
and DSL both support simultaneous voice and data over the same local loop (local 
phone line). Cable allows simultaneous data, voice, and TV reception.
8.
Compare analog modems, ISDN BRIs, DSL, and cable modems in terms of whether the 
data service is always on.
Answer: Analog modems and ISDN BRIs must signal to set up a circuit, so any data 
capabilities, such as Internet connectivity, are not “always on.” DSL and cable do not 
require any signaling to set up a circuit—in fact, no circuit is needed in the PSTN to 
support these technologies, so these services are “always on.”
9.
List some of the pros and cons regarding the use of analog modems for remote access.
Answer: Modems have the great advantage of being the most pervasively available 
remote access technology. The history of modems is long, with modems growing to be 
a very reliable choice for remote access. Speeds have improved over the years, with 
compression technology increasing the effective throughput to beyond 100 kbps. The 
biggest negatives about using modems include their relatively low speed and the fact that 
you cannot use the phone at the same time as you send data.
10.
List some of the pros and cons regarding the use of ISDN for remote access.
Answer: ISDN’s advantages include the capability to support voice calls concurrently 
with a data call. Also, ISDN can be used over the local telco loop, with no signiﬁcant 
distance limitations. And it provides more bandwidth than do modems, particularly 
with both B channels dialed to the same remote site. ISDN does have a few 
disadvantages, with the biggest disadvantage being the lower speeds than DSL or cable.
11.
List some of the pros and cons regarding the use of DSL for remote access.
Answer: DSL provides high-speed Internet access to the home, exceeding downstream 
speeds of 1 Mbps. It supports concurrent voice and data, with the data service always 
being turned on—no dialing is required. And the service speed does not degrade when 
more users are added to the network. However, DSL simply will not be available to some 
people, based on the distance to the local CO or the availability of DSL services from the 
local telco. Also, even when the home is close enough to the CO, sites farther from the 
CO might run slower than sites closer to the CO.

12.
Deﬁne what the acronym DSLAM stands for, and explain the concept behind how a 
DSLAM allows voice and data to ﬂow over the same local loop phone line.
Answer: DSLAM stands for DSL access multiplexer, with DSL meaning digital 
subscriber line. The DSLAM is connected to the local loop, splitting off the voice 
frequencies (0 to 4000 Hz) for the voice switch in the CO. It also interprets the higher 
frequencies as encoded digital signals, receiving the ATM cells sent over that digital 
signal, and forwards those ATM cells to the appropriate router.
13.
Which of the DSL standards is the most common in the United States today? What is the 
range of upstream and downstream speeds for that type of DSL, as well as the maximum 
distance of the local loop?
Answer: ADSL, meaning asynchronous DSL, is the most popular. The downstream 
speeds range from 1.5 to 8 Mbps, with upstream speeds from 64 to 800 kbps. The 
maximum distance is 18,000 feet (approximately 5500 meters).
14.
What protocols are used by DSL at the data link layer?
Answer: ATM, Ethernet, and PPP.
15.
Imagine that Andy and Barney are neighbors, and they both use cable modems. Describe 
the type of trafﬁc that they could generate that could cause collisions, and tell what is 
done to help prevent those collisions.
Answer: Downstream data never can cause a collision with upstream data because the 
two are sent in different frequency ranges. Because only the head end sends downstream 
data, no collisions can occur. Upstream data from all subscribers uses the same 
frequency range, so data sent to the head end by Andy and Barney could collide. Cable 
standards use a feature called time-division multiple access (TDMA) to assign time slots 
to each subscriber. This prevents most collisions so no collisions should occur.
16.
Name the four different Layer 1 encoding methods deﬁned for use by cable modems. For 
each one, list whether it is used for upstream data, downstream data, or both.
Answer: QAM-64 and QAM-256 are both available for use as downstream encoding 
methods. QAM-16 and QPSK are both available for upstream encoding.
17.
Which of the four different remote access technologies support IP, TCP, UDP, and the rest 
of the higher-layer TCP/IP protocols?

Compare and contrast the cabling used by an analog modem and a DSL router/modem 
when connecting to the local phone company line. Identify the purpose of each pin on 
the connector.
Answer: Both use a cable with two wires, using an RJ-11 connector. Pin 3 is used for 
transmit; pin 4 is used for receive.
19.
Compare and contrast the cabling used by an ISDN modem and a cable modem when 
connecting to the local phone company line or cable drop line. Identify the purpose of 
each pin on the connector.
Answer: ISDN uses a four-wire cable using an RJ-45 connector. The pinouts: pins 3 and 
6 for transmit, and pins 4 and 5 for receive. Cable modems use coaxial cable with a 
single conductor, so there are no pins. The round connector on the end of the cable is 
called an f-connector.
20.
List four standards bodies that have been involved in the development of DSL standards.
Answer: ANSI, IEEE, ETSI, ITU.

Using the Simulation Software 
for the Hands-on Exercises
One of the most important skills required for passing the INTRO, ICND, and CCNA 
exams is the ability to conﬁgure Cisco routers and switches with conﬁdence. In fact, one 
of the reasons that this book is relatively long is the effort put into explaining the 
commands, the output of show commands, and how the commands work together. 
Many CCNA candidates simply do not get a lot of hands-on experience, so this book is 
designed to help those who do not have real gear.
Another way to practice and develop hands-on skills is to use a simulator. A company 
called Boson Software, Inc. (www.boson.com) produces a network simulation product called 
NetSim™. The full NetSim product, available over the Internet from Boson, contains a 
large number of lab exercises and support for a large number of devices. You can even 
design your own network topology from scratch! It is a very impressive product.
The CD included with this book has a version of NetSim built speciﬁcally for this book. 
This version of NetSim includes support for several lab exercises and lab scenarios that 
were written just for this book. Although the software lets you work through these 
exercises, it is a limited-feature demo version of the actual NetSim software, which 
requires paid registration for full functionality. The full-feature version of NetSim 
includes a large set of other labs, including labs appropriate for the CCNP exams. You 
can also build a network topology with the full version of the product, so you can try any 
of the examples in this book or to experiment with networks.
This short appendix explains the following:
■
How to get to the NetSim user interface on the CD
■
What hands-on exercises in the book can be performed using this special edition of 
NetSim

572     Appendix C: Using the Simulation Software for the Hands-on Exercises
Accessing NetSim from the CD
Accessing NetSim from the CD is relatively simple. Put the CD in the CD drive, and the 
software on the CD starts. (If it doesn’t, run the command autorun.exe that is on the CD’s 
root directory.) After logging in, select the Hands-on Practice Exercises and NetSim Demo 
Software link in the main menu. Another menu opens that allows you to view the CD-only 
appendixes of labs and to start the NetSim software.
NetSim lets you pick which lab topology to load. You pick a lab topology, and you next see 
the NetSim user interface.
You can think of what you see next as a real lab, with real routers and switches. The cabling 
topology and interface numbers match the labs and scenarios in this book. So you can access 
the devices and start entering commands!
The NetSim software includes the NetSim user guide, which helps you ﬁgure out how to 
navigate and use the NetSim product. (Just select “help“ and “User guide” from NetSim.) 
However, the user manual does not tell you anything about the hands-on exercises you can 
do with this special version of NetSim! You can always just experiment using NetSim, trying 
all the commands you can think of, but remember that this is a limited-use version of the 
software, so not all commands are enabled. If you want some instructions on good things to 
try to do with the simulator, read the next section. It lists all the labs and scenarios in this 
book that can be performed using NetSim!
Hands-on Exercises Available with NetSim
This book includes two main types of exercises that can be duplicated using real gear or the 
special NetSim network simulator—scenarios and labs. You can improve your hands-on 
skills whether you perform these exercises using real gear, perform them using NetSim, or 
just read through the exercises.
Scenarios
In this Cisco Press Exam Certiﬁcation Guide series, scenarios include some form of a problem 
statement, asking you to solve the problem. Then a suggested solution is shown, with an 
explanation of some of the pitfalls you might have encountered with your answer. Many of 
these scenarios include conﬁguration and EXEC commands, but some do not. These 
scenarios are designed so that if you don’t have access to real hardware, you can still learn 
more about the commands on routers and switches. These same scenarios can also be 
performed using NetSim!

Hands-on Exercises Available with NetSim     573
Labs
This book also includes lab exercises, which follow a format typical of labs used in 
networking courses. These labs give you more guidance than do the scenarios. For instance, 
the scenarios simply state a goal, such as “Conﬁgure these three routers to support a full 
mesh of PVCs,” whereas a lab gives you instructions for each step you need to take to 
conﬁgure the network. You simply read the lab instructions, and the lab guides you through 
the steps required to conﬁgure a network based on a stated set of requirements.
As with the scenarios, you can perform these labs on real gear or using the special NetSim 
build included with the CD that comes with this book. You can also just read through the 
labs and their solutions if your time is limited, but you might want to at least try to write 
down the solution before looking at the answer!
Listing of the Hands-on Exercises
To best use NetSim, you should ﬁrst pick a particular lab or scenario. You might even want 
to print a copy if the lab or scenario is in one of the CD-only appendixes. Then you can bring 
up NetSim and select the corresponding NetSim lab topology that matches the lab or 
scenario. NetSim creates a simulated network that matches the lab or scenario, so all you 
have to do is start entering commands, just as if it were a real network with real gear!
The scenarios and labs are located in a couple different places. First, Chapter 18, “Final 
Preparation,” includes one scenario. It covers a lot of different topics from the book. The CD 
contains a scenarios appendix (CD-only Appendix B, “Scenarios”) and a lab appendix (CD-
only Appendix C, “Hands-on Lab Exercises”). These scenarios and labs focus on a more 
speciﬁc set of topics. If you plan to use NetSim frequently, you should probably print the CD-
only Appendixes B and C.
In CD-only Appendix B, the scenarios are numbered in a way to help remind you of the 
corresponding chapter in the book. For instance, Scenario 1 reinforces topics covered in 
Chapter 7, “Operating Cisco Routers,” and Scenario 3 covers the same commands covered 
in Chapter 8, “Operating Cisco LAN Switches.”
Table C-1 lists the different scenarios and labs from this book that can be performed using 
NetSim. Note that some of the scenarios in CD-only Appendix B cannot be performed on the 
simulator, mainly because those scenarios do not ask you to implement anything on a 
network, making the simulator unnecessary. So Table C-1 lists the scenarios and labs that 
can be performed using NetSim.

574     Appendix C: Using the Simulation Software for the Hands-on Exercises
* Labs with an asterisk can be performed with the limited-function version of NetSim included 
with this book. To perform the other lab scenarios, you will need to purchase the full version of 
NetSim.
How You Should Proceed with NetSim
You can bring up NetSim and dive right in. However, here a a few suggestions before you are 
ready to do all the labs:
■
Bring up NetSim now, and make sure you can at least get to a router command prompt, 
using the PC you will most likely use when studying. That way, when you are ready to 
do your ﬁrst lab or scenario, you know you have worked out any installation issues.
■
If you intend to do most of the labs and scenarios, you might want to print CD-only 
Appendixes B and C.
■
Decide if you prefer to do the labs and scenarios after reading the book or as you go 
along.
■
If you want to do the labs as you progress through the book, refer to Table C-2 for my 
suggestions on the best time to do the labs and scenarios.

Considerations When Using NetSim     575
Considerations When Using NetSim
NetSim is a wonderful product, and you can certainly get a lot of good hands-on experience 
using the NetSim product that is included with the book. However, like any simulator 
product, it does not mimic a network with 100% accuracy. Some situations are difﬁcult to 
simulate. For instance, it is very challenging to simulate the output of debug commands, 
because the simulator is not actually running IOS. If you intend to use NetSim, please 
download the latest list of hints, tips, and caveats from www.ciscopress.com/1587200945.

G L O S S A R Y
10BASE-T
The 10-Mbps baseband Ethernet speciﬁcation using two pairs of twisted-
pair cabling (Categories 3, 4, or 5): One pair transmits data and the other receives data. 
10BASE-T, which is part of the IEEE 802.3 speciﬁcation, has a distance limit of 
approximately 100 m (328 feet) per segment.
802.1Q
The IEEE standardized protocol for VLAN trunking.
AAA
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. Authentication conﬁrms the 
identity of the user or device. Authorization determines what the user or device is allowed 
to do. Accounting records information about access attempts, including inappropriate 
request. 
accounting
In security, the recording of access attempts. See AAA. 
ADSL
Asymmetric digital subscriber line. One of many DSL technologies, ADSL is 
designed to deliver more bandwidth downstream (from the central ofﬁce to the customer 
site) than upstream. 
AppleTalk DDP
The AppleTalk Data Delivery Protocol (DDP) is the AppleTalk 
equivalent of the IP protocol. It deﬁnes a 24-bit address, with 16 bits deﬁning the 
network and 8 bits deﬁning the node.
ARP
Address Resolution Protocol. An Internet protocol used to map an IP address to 
a MAC address. Deﬁned in RFC 826.
asynchronous
The lack of an imposed time ordering on a bit stream. Practically, both 
sides agree to the same speed, but there is no check or adjustment of the rates if they are 
slightly different. However, because only 1 byte per transfer is sent, slight differences in 
clock speed are not an issue. A start bit is used to signal the beginning of a byte.
ATM
Asynchronous Transfer Mode. The international standard for cell relay in which 
multiple service types (such as voice, video, or data) are conveyed in ﬁxed-length (53-
byte) cells. Fixed-length cells allow cell processing to occur in hardware, thereby reducing 

578 
transit delays. ATM is designed to take advantage of high-speed transmission media, such as 
E3, SONET, and T3.
authentication
In security, the veriﬁcation of the identity of a person or a process. See AAA.
authorization
In security, the determination of a user or devices rights in a network. See 
AAA. 
auxiliary port
A physical connector on a router that is designed to be used to allow a 
remote terminal, or PC with a terminal emulator, to access a router using an analog modem.
balanced hybrid
A term that refers to a third general type of routing protocol algorithm, 
the other two being distance vector and link state. EIGRP is the only routing protocol that 
Cisco classiﬁes as using a balanced hybrid algorithm. 
Boolean AND
A math operation performed to a pair of one-digit binary numbers. The 
result is another one-digit binary number. 1 AND 1 yields 1; all other combinations yield a 0.
BRI
Basic Rate Interface. An ISDN interface composed of two bearer (B) channels and one 
data (D) channel for circuit-switched communication of voice, video, and data.
broadcast address
An IP address in each subnet is considered to be the broadcast address 
for that subnet. It is the highest numerical value in the range of numbers for the subnet; the 
broadcast address cannot be assigned as an IP address to a computer. Packets sent to this 
address are delivered to all hosts in the subnet.
broadcast domain
A set of all devices that receive broadcast frames originating from any 
device within the set. Devices in the same VLAN are in the same broadcast domain. 
broadcast subnet
When subnetting a Class A, B, or C network, two subnet numbers are 
“discouraged” from use; one of those two subnets is the broadcast subnet. It is the subnet 
number for which the subnet bits all have a value of binary 1.
bus
A common physical signal path composed of wires or other media across which signals 
can be sent from one part of a computer to another. Also called a highway.
CDP
Cisco Discovery Protocol. A media- and protocol-independent device-discovery 
protocol that runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment, including routers, access servers, 
bridges, and switches. Using CDP, a device can advertise its existence to other devices and 
receive information about other devices on the same LAN or on the remote side of a WAN. 
Runs on all media that support SNAP headers, including LANs, Frame Relay, and ATM 
media.
ATM

579
CHAP
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol. A security feature supported on 
lines using PPP encapsulation that prevents unauthorized access. CHAP does not itself 
prevent unauthorized access; it merely identiﬁes the remote end. The router or access server 
then determines whether that user is allowed access.
CLI
Command-line interface. An interface that enables the user to interact with the 
operating system by entering commands and optional arguments.
clock source
The device to which the other devices on the link adjust their speed when using 
synchronous links.
codec
Coder-decoder. An integrated circuit device that transforms analog voice signals into 
a digital bit stream and then transforms digital signals back into analog voice signals.
collision domain
A set of network interface cards (NICs) for which a frame sent by one 
NIC could result in a collision with a frame sent by any other NIC in the same collision 
domain.
conﬁguration mode
Inside the Cisco IOS Software CLI, a user can move among various 
modes. Conﬁguration mode enables the user to enter conﬁguration commands but not any 
EXEC commands—for instance, the user can conﬁgure an IP address, but cannot show the 
status of any router features.
conﬁguration register
In Cisco routers, a 16-bit, user-conﬁgurable value that determines 
how the router functions during initialization. In software, the bit position is set by specifying 
a hexadecimal value using conﬁguration commands.
console port
A component of a router or switch through which commands are entered into 
a host.
convergence
The time required for routers to react to changes in the network, removing 
bad routes and adding new, better routes so that the current best routes are in all the routers’ 
routing tables.
CPE
Customer premises equipment. Any equipment related to communications that is 
located at the customer site, as opposed to inside the telephone company's network.
CPE

580 
CSMA/CD
Carrier sense multiple access collision detect. A media-access mechanism in 
which devices ready to transmit data ﬁrst check the channel for a carrier. If no carrier is 
sensed for a speciﬁc period of time, a device can transmit. If two devices transmit at once, a 
collision occurs and is detected by all colliding devices. This collision subsequently delays 
retransmissions from those devices for some random length of time. 
CSU/DSU
Data service unit/channel service unit. Used on digital links as an interface to the 
telephone company in the United States. Routers typically use a short cable from a serial 
interface to a DSU/CSU, which is attached to the line from the telco with a similar 
conﬁguration at the other router on the other end of the link. 
demarc
The demarcation or separation point between carrier equipment and CPE.
Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)
The process by which EIGRP routers collectively 
calculate the routes to place into the routing tables.
Dijkstra Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
Magic math used by link-state protocols, such 
as OSPF, when the routing table is calculated.
directed broadcast address
Same thing as broadcast address.
distance vector
The logic behind the behavior of some interior routing protocols, such as 
RIP and IGRP. Distance vector routing algorithms call for each router to send its entire 
routing table in each update, but only to its neighbors. Distance vector routing algorithms 
can be prone to routing loops but are computationally simpler than link-state routing 
algorithms. Also called Bellman-Ford routing algorithm.
DNS
Domain Name System. A system used on the Internet for translating names of 
network nodes into addresses.
DSL
Digital subscriber line. Public network technology that delivers high bandwidth over 
conventional copper wiring at limited distances. The most common types of DSL are ADSL, 
HDSL, SDSL, and VDSL. Because most DSL technologies do not use the complete 
bandwidth of the twisted pair, there is room remaining for a voice channel.
E1
Similar to a T1, but used in Europe. It uses a rate of 2.048 Mbps and 32 64-kbps 
channels.
CSMA/CD

581
enable mode
Inside the Cisco IOS Software CLI, a user can move among various modes. 
Enable mode, also called enable EXEC mode, allows the user to use the most powerful and 
potentially disruptive commands on a router.
encapsulation
The wrapping of data in a particular protocol header. For example, an IP 
packet could be encapsulated in an Ethernet header and trailer before being sent over an 
Ethernet. 
encryption
Applying a speciﬁc algorithm to data to alter the appearance of the data, 
making it incomprehensible to those who are not authorized to see the information.
error recovery
The process of noticing when some transmitted data was not successfully 
received and resending the data until it is successfully received.
Ethernet
A baseband LAN speciﬁcation invented by Xerox Corporation and developed 
jointly by Xerox, Intel, and Digital Equipment Corporation. Ethernet networks use CSMA/
CD and run over a variety of cable types.
exterior routing protocol
A routing protocol designed for use between two different 
organizations. These typically are used between ISPs or between a company and an ISP. For 
example, a company would run BGP, an exterior routing protocol, between one of its routers 
and a router inside an ISP.
FCIP
Fibre Channel over IP. A protocol for sending Fibre Channel protocols over an IP 
network.
Fibre Channel
A technology for transmitting data between computer devices at data rates 
from 100 MBps to 400 MBps over optical ﬁber or copper. Fibre Channel is optimized for 
connecting servers to shared storage devices and for interconnecting storage controllers and 
drives.
ﬁlter
Generally, a process or a device that screens network trafﬁc for certain characteristics, 
such as source address, destination address, or protocol, and determines whether to forward 
or discard that trafﬁc based on the established criteria.
ﬁrewall
A device or a software package that separates more secure network components 
from less secure components, protecting the more secure network from inappropriate access. 
Flash
A type of permanent memory, implemented either with a EEPROM chip or with a 
PC card that can be easily removed. Routers use ﬂash instead of disk drives for storing large 
ﬁles, particularly the IOS.
Flash

582 
ﬂow control
The process of regulating the amount of data sent by a sending computer 
towards a receiving computer. Several ﬂow control mechanisms exist, including TCP ﬂow 
control which uses windowing.
forward
To send a frame received in one interface out another interface, toward its ultimate 
destination. 
four-wire circuit
A line from the telco with four wires, composed of two twisted-pair wires. 
Each pair is used to send in one direction, so a four-wire circuit allows full-duplex 
communication.
Frame Relay
An industry-standard, switched data link layer protocol that handles multiple 
virtual circuits using LAPF encapsulation between connected devices. Frame Relay is more 
efﬁcient than X.25, the protocol for which it generally is considered a replacement.
frame
A logical grouping of information sent as a data link layer unit over a transmission 
medium. Can also be called an L2PDU.
full mesh
A term describing a network in which devices are organized in a mesh topology, 
with each network node having either a physical circuit or a virtual circuit connecting it to 
every other network node. A full mesh provides a great deal of redundancy, but because it 
can be prohibitively expensive to implement, it usually is reserved for network backbones.
hash
A mathematical formula applied to some input value for which it is difﬁcult to 
recreate the input value even if you know the results of the formula. Hashes are useful for 
transmission of passwords because, even if intercepted, the hashed representation of a 
password cannot easily be used to ﬁnd the original password. 
HDLC
High-Level Data Link Control. A bit-oriented synchronous data link layer protocol 
that speciﬁes a data encapsulation method on synchronous serial links using frame characters 
and checksums.
head end
The upstream, transmit end of a CATV installation.
holddown
A state into which a route is placed so that routers neither advertise the route 
nor accept advertisements about the route for a speciﬁc length of time (the holddown period). 
Holddown is used to ﬂush bad information about a route from all routers in the network. A 
route typically is placed in holddown when a link in that route fails.
host address
The IP address assigned to a network card on a computer.
flow control

583
host
A computer system on a network. Similar to a node, except that host usually implies 
a computer system, whereas node generally applies to any networked system, including 
access servers and routers.
HTML
Hypertext Markup Language. A simple hypertext document-formatting language 
that uses tags to indicate how a given part of a document should be interpreted by a viewing 
application, such as a web browser.
HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The protocol used by web browsers and web servers 
to transfer ﬁles, such as text and graphic ﬁles.
ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol. A network layer Internet protocol that reports 
errors and provides other information relevant to IP packet processing. Documented in RFC 
792.
IEEE 802.2
An IEEE LAN protocol that speciﬁes an implementation of the LLC sublayer 
of the data link layer. IEEE 802.2 handles errors, framing, ﬂow control, and the network 
layer (Layer 3) service interface. Used in IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.5 LANs.
IEEE 802.3
An IEEE LAN protocol that speciﬁes an implementation of the physical layer 
and the MAC sublayer of the data link layer. IEEE 802.3 uses CSMA/CD access at a variety 
of speeds over a variety of physical media. 
IEEE
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. A professional organization that 
develops communications and network standards, among other activities.
IGRP
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol. Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) developed by 
Cisco to address the issues associated with routing in large networks.
interior routing protocol
A routing protocol designed for use within a single organization. 
For example, an entire company might choose the IGRP routing protocol, which is an 
interior routing protocol.
IOS
Cisco operating system software that provides common functionality, scalability, and 
security for all Cisco products. Cisco IOS Software allows centralized, integrated, and 
automated installation and management of internetworks while ensuring support for a wide 
variety of protocols, media, services, and platforms.
IP
Internet Protocol. The network layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack offering a 
connectionless internetwork service. 
IP

584 
IP address
A 32-bit address assigned to hosts using TCP/IP. Each address consists of a 
network number, an optional subnetwork number, and a host number. The network and 
subnetwork numbers together are used for routing, and the host number is used to address 
an individual host within the network or subnetwork. 
IPX
Internetwork Packet Exchange. A Novell NetWare network layer (Layer 3) protocol 
used for transferring data from servers to workstations. IPX is similar to IP and XNS.
iSCSI
IP SCSI. A protocol for sending and receiving SCSI commands over an IP network, 
providing ﬁle-level access to shared storage devices. 
ISDN
Integrated Services Digital Network. A service offered by telephone companies that 
permits telephone networks to carry data, voice, and other source trafﬁc.
ISL
Inter-Switch Link. The Cisco proprietary VLAN trunking protocol. 
ISO
International Organization for Standardization. An international organization that is 
responsible for a wide range of standards, including those relevant to networking. The ISO 
developed the OSI reference model, a popular networking reference model.
L4PDU
The data compiled by a Layer 4 protocol, including Layer 4 headers and 
encapsulated high-layer data, but not including lower-layer headers and trailers.
Layer 3 protocol
A protocol that it has characteristics like OSI Layer 3, which deﬁnes 
logical addressing and routing. IP, IPX, and AppleTalk DDP are all Layer 3 protocols. 
learn
The process of discovering MAC addresses, and their relative location by looking at 
the source MAC address of all frames received by a bridge or switch.
link-state
A type of routing protocol which sends full topology information about the 
network to all routers, so they all have a consistent view of the network topology and status. 
Link-state algorithms create a consistent view of the network and, therefore, are not prone 
to routing loops; however, they achieve this at the cost of relatively greater computational 
difﬁculty and more widespread trafﬁc.
LLC

Modulator-demodulator. A device that converts digital and analog signals for the 
purpose of communicating over analog telephone lines. At the source, a modem converts 
digital signals to a form suitable for transmission over analog communication facilities. At 
the destination, the analog signals are returned to their digital form. Modems allow data to 
be transmitted over voice-grade telephone lines.

addresses.
network
A collection of computers, printers, routers, switches, and other devices that can 
communicate with each other over some transmission medium.

Authentication Protocol (CHAP), PAP passes the password and the host name or username 
in the clear (unencrypted).
partial mesh
A network in which devices are organized in a mesh topology, with some 
network nodes organized in a full mesh but others that are connected only to one or two 
other nodes in the network. A partial mesh does not provide the level of redundancy of a full-

used for the subnet part of the address. Sometimes referred to simply as the mask.
subnet
Subnets are subdivisions of a Class A, B, or C network, as conﬁgured by a network 
administrator. Subnets allow a single Class A, B, or C network to be used instead of multiple 
networks, and still allow for a large number of groups of IP addresses, as is required for 
efﬁcient IP routing.
subnetting
The process of subdividing a Class A, B, or C network and into smaller portions 
called subnets.
switch
A network device that ﬁlters, forwards, and ﬂoods frames based on the destination 
address of each frame. The switch operates at the data link layer of the Open System 
Interconnections (OSI) reference model.
synchronous
The imposition of time ordering on a bit stream. Practically, a device will try 
to use the same speed as another device on the other end of a serial link. However, by 
examining transitions between voltage states on the link, the device can notice slight 
variations in the speed on each end and can adjust its speed accordingly.
socket

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol. A connection-oriented transport layer TCP/IP 
protocol that provides reliable data transmission.

construction of worldwide internetworks. TCP and IP are the two best-known protocols in 
the suite.
telco
A common abbreviation for telephone company.
Telnet
The standard terminal emulation protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Telnet is

a packet takes to a destination. It is used mostly to debug routing problems between hosts. 
A traceroute protocol also is deﬁned in RFC 1393.
transparent bridge
A device that forwards frames between LAN segments based on the 
destination MAC address.  Transparent bridging is so named because the presence of bridges 
is transparent to network end nodes.
trunking
Also called VLAN trunking. A method (using either Cisco’s ISL protocol or the 
IEEE 802.1q protocol) to support multiple VLANs that have members on more than one 
switch. 
twisted pair

protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without 
acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery.
update timer
A timer used by a router to indicate when to send the next routing update.
user mode
A mode of the user interface to a router or switch in which the user can type 
only nondisruptive EXEC commands, generally just to look at the current status, but not to 
change any operational settings.
user mode

590 
UTP
Unshielded twisted pair. A four-pair wire medium used in a variety of networks. UTP 
does not require the ﬁxed spacing between connections that is necessary with coaxial-type 
connections. Five types of UTP cabling are commonly used: Category 1 through Category 5 
cabling.
VLAN
A group of devices on one or more LANs that are conﬁgured (using management 
software) so that they can communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when, in 
fact, they are located on a number of different LAN segments. Because VLANs are based on 
logical instead of physical connections, they are extremely ﬂexible.
VoIP
Voice over IP. The capability to carry voice over an IP-based Internet. VoIP enables a 
router to carry voice trafﬁc (for example, telephone calls and faxes) over an IP network. 
well-known port
A port number reserved for use by a particular application. The use of 
well-known ports allows a client to send a TCP or UDP segment to a server, to the correct 
destination port for that application. 
windowing
The term window represents the number of bytes that can be sent without 
receiving an acknowledgment. Windowing is the dynamic raising and lowering of the 
window to control the ﬂow of data in a network.
WWW

hypertext and other services (based on HTML and HTTP) to terminals running client 
applications, such as a browser.
zero subnet
When subnetting a Class A, B, or C network, two subnet numbers are 
“discouraged” from use; the zero subnet is one of these two subnets. It is the subnet number 
for which the subnet bits all have a value of binary 0.
